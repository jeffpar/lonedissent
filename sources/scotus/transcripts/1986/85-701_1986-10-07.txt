Mr. Chief Justice and may it

This case comes forward on appeal from the

purpose is to foster respect for human life and to

It has carried out its purposes by raising

The question before this Court is whether

1

2

Congress can require that the funds used for such

3

advocacy can be separate — can be required tc be

4

separate and

5

only of voluntary contributions.

segregated from the funds which consist

The court below concluded that the statute in

6
7

question restricted the simplest method by which

8

Massachusetts Citizens for Life could achieve its

9

advocacy.

It said that there was a burden on the rights

10

of speech and association because of the requirement of

11

establishing the separate segregated fund.

12

Before going on to the reasonina of the court,

13

I would like to note explicitly three things that it did

14

not decide;
It did not decide tha t the statute prohibited

15
16

the speech in question, but only that it burdened it;
It did not decide

17

that the statute prohibited

18

the distribution of voting r ecords, nor even that the

19

statute required that voting records be distributed

20

through the mechanism of a separate, segregated fund;
/

21

And it did not prohibit this organization or

22

any other similar organization from distributing in a

23

newsletter to its members voting records which advocated

24

the election and the defeat of candidates.
i

25

What it did hold was that Congress cannot for

1

express advocacy in elections require that any material

2

that is disseminated tc the general public, not

3

distributed in the way that a message ordinarily is by

4

an organization, can be required to be frcm a separately

5

segregated fund, from a fund which apprises everyone

6

that the contributions to it will be used in connection

7

with specific federal elections -QUESTION*

8

9

I take it it’s the organization

that apprises the people, not the fund?

10

MR. STEELE;

Yes, the organization in making

11

the solicitations -- those can be done by the

12

organization, would be done by the organization,

13

they would be the ones that apprised them of that.

and

14

There are three policies underslying the Act

15

which we think that the court's decision goes against.

16

First of all, if the court's decision stands the

17

disclosure aspects of the Act are substantially

18

undercut.

19

forward by the statute.

Again, there are really three purposes put
One of them is the disclosure.

It has been argued here that the section in

20
21

question, Section 441(b), whose antecedent gees tack tc

22

the Federal Corrupt Practices Act, is not a disclosure

23

statute.

24

the corporations' and labor organizations* separate

25

segregated funds are political committees and subjects

It dees, however,

specifically set forth that

(202) 628-9300

1

them therefore to the same requirements that all

2

political committees are required under the

3

Election Campaign Act regarding disclosure.

Federal

4

And if the court's decision were to stand,

5

that disclosure of where money is spent and where it

6

comes from would be considerably lessened .

7

The second policy —

8

QUESTION*

9
10

Could Congress require that the

publisher of a newspaper along with every edition of the
newspaper list all the stockholders of the newspaper?
MR. STEELE:

11

I think Congress felt that it

12

would not do that and, in light of the First Amendment,

13

did not do that, and there was an explicit statutory

14

exception.

15
16
17
18

QUESTION:

But suppose it changed its mind?

Would a requirement like that be constitutional?
MR. STEELE:

I think that would be a very

difficult requirement to uphold.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. STEELEt

Why is that different from this?
Because here the purposes of the

21

organization are — again, I think one of the questions

22

here would be, if the purpose of this organization had

23

been to distribute newsletters by subscription and so

24

forth and that was its regular business,
*■

25

that there

i

would be that question there.
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

This, however, seems to us crosses ever the

2

line from the operation of a newspaper in that sense to

3

pure election advocacy, and

4

Congress is balancing there between two different

5

issues, cne of those issues being whether election

6

advocacy in the sense of urging the election or defeat

7

of particular individuals can be financed directly from

8

a corporation’s funds.

9

that in that.sense the

They did not prohibit that speech.

They

10

merely said that that should be dene through a separate,

11

segregated fund and prescribed the methods fer having

12

that fund operated and required the public disclosure.

13

But again, that is not a prohibition of that.

14

Now, whether the same disclosure for a

15

newspaper — again, I think

16

substantial question there, but I think that it could be

17

argued that disclosure of the sources of a newspaper’s

18

funding was constitutionally permissible so long as it

19

involved no particular restriction on what the newspaper

20

would do.

21

that there would be a

Laws of general application, going back to the

22

Grosjjean case and other cases of that applied to

23

newspapers, would be, could be upheld.

QUESTION:

Tc print the list of their

5

advertisements, political advertisements, and what they

6

cost ?
ME. STEELE;

7

The federal election campaign

8

statute does require, on ads placed, where the source of

9

that is.

That is not a direct requirement on the

10

newspaper, but I think that there is the possibility,

11

again, that such a statute could be upheld as a

12

disclosure statute as long as it did not limit the

13

newspaper's right to publish those.
QUESTION;

14

But if an ordinary organization,

15

say the Jim Brown Patriotic Society, publishes a list of

16

voting records of all of the Congressmen, that's

that if voting records were published in a ncn-p artisan

2

fashion it would not consider those to be in con nection

is not the publication of ;such voting records, b ut

(202) 628-9300

1

we've said, we think the fact that it is an 80 year old

2

statute which has been passed tack and forth through

3

Congress many times gives some weight to it.

4

But if you go back to the '47 debates which we

5

have set forth, we think that the debates there and the

6

eventual results, and indeed the legislative hearings

7

that led up to that statute, make it quite clear that

8

the sponsors of that Act, particularly Senator Taft,

9

were focusing on this question of all corporations.

10

^We have set forth

in footnotes to cur briefs

11

several organizations with which the 1946 hearings had

12

been concerned, which were quite clearly non-profit

13

ideological organizations in that sense.

14

in discussing the legislation on the floor of the Senate

15

was asked numerous questions.

16

were set out in this Court's decision in United States

17

versus CIO.

18

Senator Taft

A large number of those

A number of those clearly relate to

19

organizations.

He spoke, as we've noted, of churches

20

that were incorporated, that would have no right to

21

spend the money of their members in that fashion.

22

they were drawing, in that sense, and Senator Taft was

23

drawing in the discussions a very precise line relating

to the existence or not or whether it was a corporation

it isn’t clear.

MB. STEELE:

8

I think it is clear, in the sense

9

that that question was — it was resolved again by the

10

Congress after this Court’s decision in Buckley versus

11

Valeo.

12

the statute requires the disclosure of independent

13

expenditures by individuals under a separate section of

14

the statute,

15

but that individuals are required to disclose under the

16

statute independent expenditures that they make exprelly

17

advocating the election or defeat of candidates.

There is different disclosure required, but that

QUESTION;

There’s no -- you’re not saying

that they don’t follow the law?

6

MR. STEELE;

No.

My phrasing was meant to say

7

that I think that the question of their tax status --

8

I’m less clear of their tax status under the federal

9

laws.

But we have no quarrel with the fact that they
s.

10

are a non-profit corporation.

11

QUESTION:

Mr. Steele, I think you said

12

earlier that the — is it 441(h) has its source in the

13

old Corrupt Practices Acts?

MR. STEELE:

MR. STEELE;

Yes.

1907 was the first passage cf it,

yes.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. STEELE;

20

QUESTION:

That’s 80 years ago, believe me.
Yes,

it is.

The corruption which prevoked that

/

21

statute at the time, is it the sort of thing that’s

22

ordinarily even associated with non-profit

23

corporations ?

24

MR. STEELE:

I think that at the time it was
»•

25

(

passed that was certainly so.

Of course, the corporate

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20

F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

structure then was considerably different.

2

response to Justice O'Connor, I think it clear when

3

Congress reconsidered the statute as it did in 1947 when

4

it added labor organizations that it envisaged that.

5

As I said in

And I think that it was clear again in

1971,

6

when the statute was re-amended in light of this Court's

7

decisions in the CIO case and the UAH case, that Mr.

8

Hansen, who introduced the bill there, was saying that

9

the purpose of that bill was to codify the pre-existing

10

understanding of the law; and that it had been clear

11

throughout that period, I think, that Congress was

12

seeking a rule that dealt -- used the term

13

"corporations ."

14
15
16

The term in the statute, is "any corporation
whatever."
QUESTION;

Well, even assuming that's what the

17

statute says and that it may embrace non-profit

18

corporations, I suppose the First Amendment.question is

19

whether it can be constitutional as applied to a

20

non-profit corporation like"this, isn't that right?

21

22
23
24

MB. STEELE;

I think that is the question, and

that was the question —
QUESTION;

Well, that’s why I wondered.

Certainly the kind of corrupt practices which gave us

2

corporations?

3

I mean, non-profit corporations don't have

4

these accumulations of wealth that were the seed for for

5

the problem.

6

MR. STEELE;

Well, some of them do not.

This

7

is quite a small one, tut I

8

again of the federal revenue code, one finds non-profit

9

corporations, particularly the ones that are not merely

10

12

think that in the context

Of course, they are not, in the sense of

Well, do you recognize that the

First Amendment problem is rather more difficult as

addressed to a non-profit corporation than it is to a

19

MR. STEELE;

Well, I think that the concern

20

that this Court should have about that I certainly

understand and concede.

QUESTION*

Mr. Steele, what is the threat of

8

corruption that's involved here, even from regular

9

business corporations?

You're not talking about

10

business corporations getting together money and giving

11

it to a candidate, or even expending the money in the

12

way that the candidate directs.

13

These are independent expenditures.

14

there's any connection with the candidate, if they say,

15

you know, in exchange for our doing this would you vcte

MR. STEELE;

Congress feared was that you could get large

expenditures where the sources would be known, where the

2

help would be known, and even though there was no overt

3

cooperation before that a rule that would allow those

4

kinds of expenditures would result in the same kind of

5

indebtedness; that even without prior coordination, that

6

it thought that a prophylactic rule saying that

7

expenditures would result in the same thing -- again,

8

the Taft-Hartley Act was where that question was first

9

debated very strongly with regard to the expenditures,

10

when they put in expenditures, because of the

11

Congressional feeling that expenditures serve much of

12

the same kind of role as contributions.

13

And as we have noted in our brief, those were

14

not said to be or alleged to be or said necessary to be

15

in any of this Court’s decisions ones that were

16

coordinated; that the feeling was that expenditures

17

themselves would result in the same kind cf debt.

18

same kind of problem was potentially there. .
QUESTION;

19

The

There’s something wrong with that?

20

There is something wrong with a political candidate not

21

making any commitment to people that work hard for that

candidate ?

MR. STEELE;

I think that the judgment of

of time, particularly with
i

regard to corporations, has been, yes, there is that

very strong danger there
QUESTION:

2

Oh, I understand there's the

3

danger, but I wouldn't describe that as corruption.

4

would describe that as the normal workings cf the

5

political process, that candidates who get elected tend

6

to favor the interests of these who worked hard for

7

their election.
If that's corruption, we're in a let of

8

9

I

trouble.
MR. STEELE*.

10

Well, I think that the

11

Congressional judgment is that it’s not merely the

12

working hard, that it is the relationship of the money

13

that increases that indebtedness, and that there is in

14

their mind a very similar relationship there between the

15

actual contribution under control and the expenditure of

16

money for the same purposes.

,

And indeed, that was the purpose of the *47

17
18

legislation, was to reach that.

And they were very

19

clear, and I think that in regard to that that in this

20

case, in canvasing the CIO and the UAW cases, recognized

21

there that these were not alleged to be coordinated

22

expenditures, but that those were expenditures that came

23

within the meaning of the Act, and upheld in the UAW

24

case the indictment there.

The cases that this Court has

propensity for corruption.

As to the constitutional arguments. Section

441 implicates freedom of expression, freedom of

association, and freedom of the press:

freedom of

expression because speech concerning the qualification

of candidates or elected officials gees tc the heart of

12

the First Amendment’s concerns and supports an

enlightened electorate; freedom of association because

14

the ability of like-minded individuals to gather

together and communicate to the outside world, enhancing

16

the weak voices of the members, goes to the heart of the

American way of life and American history, especially

18

where the message concerns those who would be our

19

leaders.

20

Freedom of the press is implicated because

4

legislation which implicates those three concerns to the

extend that I have articulated will only be allowed to

survive strict scrutiny from this Court, and indeed

8

serve that substantial evil in the least restrictive

manner .

Now, with respect

to corruption, the Court, as

11

I have indicated, has implicated — has said, has held

12

loudly, that contributions do give rise to that

13

propensity because the candidate my repay out of the

14

public trust, but independent expenditures do not.

15

Now, if this Court were to recognize another

16

purpose to be served, a compelling purpose that will

17

allow quantitative restrictions on speech -- that is

18

what this is, a quantitative restriction cn speech by a

19

quantitative restriction on money.

20

If this Court were to find that the

21

requirement of keeping business money out of elections

22

were, despite the previous holdings of this Court, a

23

compelling purpose, it can be served by statutes less

24

restrictive than this, because this statute prohibits

existence.

A statute could be articulated

that would try

to keep out business money by disclosure.

to make an independent expenditure, Hr. Charitable

Lesser' restrictive, but still intrusive, methods could

11

be devised.

12

But these blanket prohibitions that prohibit

13

the independent expenditure of this organization that

14

never had any business money cannot be justified.

15

Now, the disclosure that the FEC says is tc be

16

served here justifies this intrusion into the heart cf

17

the First Amendment on the grounds of disclosure.

18

say three things on that;

19

1*11

One, Section 441(b) is not a disclosure

20

statute; two, there is disclosure already required in

21

the statutes; three, further disclosure more burdensome

Section 441(b) says:

8

poison; they must be walled off from the political

Section 441(b) says, as the FEC points out:

11

If you wish to set up a committee, and if that committee

then solicits special contributions from your members,

13

not from people who may be sympathetically inclined but

14

from people whose names appear in your card index, then

15

you may use that money for independent expenditures, but

16

you may not use your corporate till "fee pay for your

the amount.

This cannot be squared with freedom of

But the purpose of keeping business money out

of the electoral process is not served by this statute

9

because of its underinclusive impact.

A business

partnerships, a joint venture, need not have any limit

12

on the amount of money that it can spend independently,

13

no limit.

True, it must disclose if it spends more than

15

considers all the election law cases that this Court has

had in the last 40 years — UAW, CIO, the Pipefitters in

the seventies, NCPAC, National Right to Wcrk — this

18

case involving a £9800 expenditure to publish a

19

newsletter containing 492 candidates* positions, £2C

20

apiece, constitutes the most insignificant, the most

21

puny threat of any case that has come before this

22

Court.

23

But when you consider the fundamental

24

principles that bind us together — freedom of

2

freedom of the press; freedom of speech — this perhaps

3

is the mcst significant of all.

4

The idea that even now, in the last two

decades of the twentieth century, an organization like

Mass Citizens must stand before this bar and justify

having produced a newsletter containing voting records

is appalling.
