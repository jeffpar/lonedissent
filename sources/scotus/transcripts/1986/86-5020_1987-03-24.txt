ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE E. BURNS, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. BURNS:

9

10

Mr.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The issue in this case is whether the State of

12

Maryland may constitutionally execute a defendant based

13

on a public opinion poll.

14

This Court has repeatedly -- most recently in

15

this term in California versus Brown — said there are

16

two relevant considerations in a capital sentencing.

17
18

First,

tie defendant’s background.

Obviously

that's not at issue in victim impact statements.
The second thing are the circumstances of the

19

20

crime.

21

normal way are also not involved.

22

that the victims wno testified were at the crime scene,

23

were involved with the crime, but that the crime was

24

instituted against them as opposed to the actual victims.

25

The circumstances of the crime, of course, in a
There's no contention

The State, however, argues that this is still

part of the circumstances of the crime.

2

really comes down to no more than saying, "If I cast a

3

pebble into the ocean, the ripples just go on forever.”

4

The arg ument

The problem with that, I think, is not only

5

has it never been used as a basis for criminal

6

sentencing, it’s probably not even a good basis for tort

7

law.

8

9

The implications are simply staggering,
because I think it's fair to say that each and every one

10

of us is offended by violent crime.

11

case, there's no reason every citizen who is offended by

12

this shouldn't come in and express that view.

13
14
15

That being the

Indeed, we might have an 830 number linked up
to the courtroom.

People could call in.

More specifically, lawyers and judges who are

16

involved in these cases are certainly offended by the

17

facts that they have to deal with, the crime that they

18

have to deal

19
20
21

22

23

with.

It would seem that it would be fair to call
them in as also —
Q U E ST I ON';

What exactly was introduced in

evidence here, Mr. Burns?
MR. BURNS:

Here we have the testimony of, or

24

the statements of the immediate family; that is, the

25

mother -- excuse me, son, daughter of the victims — the

2

actual victims
I use the victims in two words — two ways.

3

"Victims" obviously meaning

4

as included in tnis case included those people, family

5

members, who obviously were upset by the crime, as

6

anyone would be, but were not present in any way at the

7

crime, and at whom the crime was not actually aimed at.

8
9

the murder victims, victims

So that was what we had in this case.

That is

the complaint.

10

The State, in short --

11

QUESTION;

You'd allow it to be introduced, I

12

presume, if as one of the aggravating circumstances, it

13

was shown that the victim was tortured to death in front

14

of his wife or something like that, wouldn’t you?

15

HR. BURNS;

16

QUESTION;

17
18

I think there are circumstances -Then the fact that the wife was so

much aggrieved by it you think would be relevant?
MR. BURNS;

Well,

I think it would be relevant

19

in a slightly different way, Justice Scalia.

20

circumstances it is a crime.

21

horrible, if

22

a citizen that had to stand here and watch this.

23

In that

The crime does become more

it were not just the wife, if it were just

I do think that is aggravating that you put

24

someone through that.

So I

think it is an aggravating

25

circumstance of the crime, as opposed to someone who is

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

not present at the crime.
So I agree --

2
3

My answer is;

yes, but perhaps

for a slightly iifferent reason than you suggest.
QUESTION;

4

I don't understand why in principle

5

you say simply the fact that the crime does more harm is

6

not a valid aggravating factor.
Let’s assume that I’m pulling a bank robbery

7

8

and I aim at a guard intending to kill him.

9

to kill him,

10

If I happen

I'm liable foe much graver punishment than

if my aim is bad and he’s only wounded; correct?
MR. BURNS;

11

I'm not sure, Your Honor, because

12

in one case you have murder and in one attempted murder,

13

except if there is the aggravating factor of capital

14

crime.

15

You have ia Maryland at least life in each case.
QUESTION;

Well, I think you certainly would

16

not deny that a State can have different punishments,

17

and considerably different,

18

and one that is actually committed.

19

MR. BURNS:

20

QUESTION;

for a murder that goes awry,

I agree, Your Honor.
Although the evil of the person who

21

pulls the trigger, the blackness of his soul, is exactly

22

the same; right?

Re's just as bad a person.

23

MR. BURNS:

24

QUESTION:

25

I agree, Your Honor.
So somehow the harm that is

inflicted upon society is a perfectly valid factor.
6

(202) 628-9300

1

Now, why does it just have to be the harm upon the

2

victim ?
MR. BURNS:

3

If that's true, Your Honor, we

4

eliminate reasons for foreseeability, because I think in

5

Your Honor's hypothetical, we do have the foreseeability

6

problem .

7

If I point a gun in a bank and shoot it, I

8

surely am aware that anyone there may be injured.

I am

9

not likely to be aware that the victim that gets hit,

10

for example, has a loving family and children as opposed

11

to a victim who may be hated by everyone.

12
13
14

That's very unlikely that I'm going to be
aware of that.
&nd I would agree, Justice Seal ia , if we have

15

a case, for example,

16

of Mr. Smith.

17

hate his family.

18

by killing Mr. Smith.”

19

of someone saying, "I'm very fond

I’ve liked Mr. Smith for ten years, but I
I'm goin?

to get even with his family

Well, in that case I would agree that the

20

circumstance of the crime is precisely that.

21

ordinary situation is, there certainly may be all these

22

ripple effects, but it really has nothing to do with the

23

blackness of

24

defendant isn't aware, and in most instances, to nut it

25

bluntly, is indifferent to all these things.

But the

QUESTION:

But why is the blackness of the

2

soul of the defendant, as you and Justice Scalia have

3

been saying,

4

evidence about?

5

the only thing

that the State may produce

Certainly our cases have given the broadest

6

latitude to the defendant, to show anything in the

7

defendant’s background that may make the jury have a

8

feel for and be sympathetic to him.

9

Why can’t the State at the same time be

10

entitled to make tne victim human and make the family

11

human, to get across to the

12

this act was?

13

KB. BURNS:

Well,

jury just what the impact of

Chief Justice, I think one

14

clear thing is presumably the defendant’s background is

15

relevant, why he’s here.

16

The victim —

MR. BURNS:

the victims were relevant.

So the question is:

What reason

particular crime?
Certainly defendant's background does.

2

Does

3

it have any effect on the crime, for example, if one

4

sees two people that both look like they’re from Skid

5

Bow, shoots one.

6
7

It turns out he’s a Skid Row person, and no
one much cares.
Ha shoots another person, and it turns out

8
9

this person was actually a renowned surgeon, and he

10

happened to be dressed that way.

11

a thousand lives will be lost because he'll be unable to

12

be the surgeon in those cases.

13

But again --

14

QUESTION:

?.nd, indeed, probably

Mr. Burns, do you suppose that it’s

15

possible for a State to make it an aggravating

16

circumstance to murder someone who is a policeman?
MR. BURNS;

17
18

if I may add one tiing.
I think it would have to be that you would

19
20

I think it is, Justice O’Connor,

have reason to know it is a policeman as opposed to not.

21

QUESTION:

Well, maybej maybe not.

22

Do you think the State can make it an

23

aggravating circumstance to murder the parent of minor

24

children?

25

MR. BURNS;

I think if the State tied it to a

(202) 628-9300

1

knowledge and specific purpose for doing that
QUESTION:

2
3

Kell, maybe; maybe not.

That's the

issue.
Does the defendant's knowledge of

4

that have to

5

be a component, or is it possible to take into

6

consideration the scope of harm to society?
MR. BORNS;

7

That's the question, Your Honor.

8

But I think the difficulty is if we open this and

9

prevent scope of society arguments is, again, we're not

10

really focusing on culpability of the defendant.
It's hard for the defendant to be -- judge his

11

12

culpability in light of what not only he does not know

13

in many cases, but could not conceivably know.
So that we have -- and I think this goes to

14
15

the arbitrary factor.

We have two defendants who have

16

both acted in a horrible way, society would agree.
One, purely by fortuitous circumstances, has

17
18

caused all these additional harms, not because he's

19

worse or batter than the other defendant, but simply by

20

chance .

21

I think it's difficult to see how that cannot

22

have an arbitrary result, because we're not looking at

23

what this criminal did, what he deliberately caused to

24

be done, but merely fortuitous circumstances of again

25

the ripple effect for society.
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

QUESTION;

1

Is that any more arbitrary than

2

Justice Scalia’s example of the attempted murderer who

3

aims for the forehead, misses and gets ten years, as

4

opposed to the man who hits and is executed?
MR. BURNS;

5

I don’t think that is arbitrary at

6

all, Your Honor, ajain because when I point the gun at

7

someone, I surely must know — I mean, I think it’s the

8

basis of the criminal law -QUESTION;

9

When you know you’re going to

10

miss?

I mean, the hypothesis is you intend to hit him

11

square in the forehead, and

in one case you miss.

12

MR. BURNS;

Precisely, Judge Scalia.

13

I may ha/e benefited from that.

My point is;

14

The defendant who hits the victim and is punished

15

greater can hardly complain because someone else missed

16

him.
In that circumstances, both of them knew, or

17
18

should have known, the consequences.

I surely know, if

19

I point a gun at someone and I intend to kill them, that

20

I may well do that.
If I don't, I may have been lucky.

21

But it has

22

nothing to do with fortuitous circumstances in the sense

23

that I don’t have control of.

24

QUESTIQN;

25

unlucky.

I could say if you do, you’re

1

MR. BURNS;

2

QUESTION:

Maybe very unlucky.
-- which direction you want to look

3

at it from.

4

talking about culpability as though the only elements

5

that go into culpability are how wicked is your intent,

6

number one, and perhaps, perhaps —

7

that's it.

10

It seems to me you're

Well, I guess

How wicked is your intent?
It seems to me that another quite independent

8
9

But the point is;

element of culpability is simply how great is the harm
you did.

How great is the harm that you did?
MR. BORNS:

11

The difficulty, Justice Scalia, is

12

that I think we're going to have to simply change what

13

we’ve said about criminal law for at least the last 200

14

years.

15

Culpability has been the hallmark of criminal

16

law, unlike tort law, because again we're punishing

17

people for their bad acts, what they consciously are

18

doing, not what other circumstances may, quite beyond

19

their acts, cause.

20

If you're trying to use this -- and I suppose

21

deterrence is a factor in all of criminal law — if

22

you're trying to deter someone, you may deter someone by

23

saying, "If this happens, if you do this and you kill

24

someone, we're going to punish you in this wav."

25

It’s hard to deter someone by simply saying,
12

QUESTION:

Call it vindication, if you like.

10

MR. BURNS:

11

QUESTION;

12

MR. BURNS:

Pardon?

Call it vindication, if you like.
Well,

I think that — if I may —

13

leads us to a second problem.

14

to link that up by saying:

15

I’m sorry.

The State has attempted

It goes to retribution.

And certainly there are opinions by Justices

16

of this Court talking about retribution in capital

17

punishment.

18

However, those opinions are dealing with the

19

question of whether there should be capital punishment

20

or not, not the procedures to carry out retribution.

21

And I think the point is significant.

For

22

example, if the State is right, and all I have to show

23

is that this procedure is consistent with retribution,

24

then it’s obvious that defendant should be tortured

25

during sentencing.
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

It's difficult to think of anything that could

1
2

better serve retribution.

3

one could at least bound, gag and chain him during it.

4

Again, it serves as retribution.
The point is:

5

Or if one doesn't like that,

Retribution has a legitimate

6

basis, if one accepts it, in deciding whether or not we

7

apply the ultimate punishment, but it doesn’t help at

8

all to say, "Is the procedure fair,” because it would

9

seem to me that the less fair the procedure, the greater

10

retrib ution.

11

If

one uses that argument, it militates in

12

favor of having the most unfair procedure.

13

this may be an example.

14

procedure, certainly an unfair one in this particular

15

case .
QUESTION:

16

If

And I think

not the most unfair

Mr. Burns, aren't there a number of

17

States with capital punishment laws that look to, as an

18

aggravating circumstance, the extent to which other

19

people might have been endangered by the conduct?
MR. BURNS:

20

I think, Justice O'Connor — the

21

ones I'm familiar with -- are ones where you're talking

22

about -- and Maryland has that, too,

23

than one person.
But, once again, the defendant certainly

For example, if yo u put a bomb in this

And again I think

10

that is easy to tie to

11

foreseeability, as opposed t o the si tua tion wher e no one

12

can possibly foresee.
So I’m learning my answer, because I'm not

13
14

terribly familiar with all t hese statutes, but I think

15

you can distinguish them in that way.

But again you don't know how extreme, and

That may be reasonably likelihood,

MR. BURNS

there are going to be extremes.
QUESTION;

that kind of reasonable concern, do you think that's

inherently improper, viewed in the light of the other

aggravating circumstances that States have adopted?
MR. BURNS;

I don't think so, Justice

O'Connor.

11

additional problems with this, because not only are we

talking about leaving these victims, we're also talking

13

about a very personalized thing.

5

but it turns on the specific

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Burns, hasn’t tort law

6

for a long time distinguished between intentional torts

7

and negligent torts in this respect, that with respect

8

to intentional torts, you take the conseguences as you

9

find them, and you're responsible for even fairly

10
11
12

unforeseeable con sequences.
It’s just in the negligence areas that the
foreseeability guestion comes in.

13

MR. BURNS:

14

Justice, there's a difference.

15

QUESTION:

I certainly agree, Mr. Chief

So that an intentional killer is

16

really not in a position as applying traditional tort

17

laws to complain that he killed someone who had a far

18

more bereaved family than the next person.

19

MR. BURNS:

Mr. Chief Justice, I certainly

20

agree with you that the family could successfully sue

21

the killer.

22

I think in our brief we make clear, one of the early

23

divisions between tort law and criminal law was just

24

that, is to take tne victim

as you find the situation.

25

And the idea, obviously, of

tort law is to put people,

We’ll hear now from you Hr. Monk.

Thank you, Hr. Burns.

10

ORAL ARGUM EM T OF CHARLES 0. MONK, II, ESQ.,

11

ON 3EHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MONK;

12
13

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court!
The issue in this case is whether victim

14
15

impact evidence can be introduced at the sentencing

16

phase of a capital case consistent with the Eighth

17

Amendment.
We believe that it can under Maryland’s

18
19

carefully devised capital sentencing process.
The Maryland General Assembly has chosen to

20
21

include victim impact evidence in the death penalty

22

process.

23

In doing so, however, Maryland has not

24

undermined the substantial safeguards of its process

25

that guide the discretion of the sentencer and insure
24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that the death penalty is not imposed in an arbitrary or

2

capricious manner .

3

In fact, I suggest that Maryland's bifurcated

4

death penalty procedure contains many more procedural

5

safeguards than other sentencing procedures already

6

approved by this Court.

7

8
9

Maryland has ten limited circumstances where
the death penalty may be appropriate.
With the exception of a person that contracts

10

for murder, only a principal in the first degree, that

11

is, one that actually commits the murder or kills the

12

victim, is subject to capital punishment in Maryland.

13

The aggravated murderers, where the death

14

penalty can be imposed, include such things as victim --

15

as the victim was a law enforcement officer.

16

stop here, Justice Scalia.

17

And let me

In Maryland, the defendant would not have to

18

know that the victim was a law enforcement officer.

19

would be sufficient that the -- that the victim was a

20

law enforcement officer on duty to constitute an

21

aggravated circumstance unier the Maryland Statute.

It

22

Another -- another example of the aggravated

23

circum stances reguired by the Maryland Statute is that

24

the victim was taken or attempted to be taken in the

25

course of a kidnapping or abduction.
25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

In this rase, the aggravating circumstance is

1

2

that the defendant committed the murder while committing

3

robb ery.
Under Maryland's death penalty law, if no

4
5

aggravating circumstance is found, then life

6

imprisonment is the sentence.
However, if one or more aggravating

7

8

circumstances are found to exist and the standand is

9

beyond a reasonable doubt, then we shift to mitigating

10

circumstances for consideration.
In addition to Stat. 7, statutorily defined

11
12

mitigating circumstances, Maryland also permits the

13

defendant wide discretion to present other facts in

14

mitigation.
Mitigating circumstances under the Maryland

15
16

procedure must only be proved by a preponderance of the

17

evidence.

18

A single mitigating circumstance is sufficient

19

under the Maryland procedure to outweigh whatever

20

aggravating circumstances are found and indicate that

21

life sentence is appropriate.

22

In this case, the jury found and noted on the

23

verdict sheet under the open-ended-other-facts category

24

that the defendant's family environment, child neglect,

25

and lack of strong father image were mitigating factors.
26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

I think, this is important because it indicates

2

that the jury was, in fact, listening to the evidence

3

and understanding what the defendant was presenting,

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Monk, I think the question I

5

have I’d like you to address, frankly, is that the

6

Maryland sentencing scheme,

7

and as the record discloses, is very specific.

as you’ve been describing it

8

In fact, the jury is actually given a form --

9

M3. MONK;

10

QUESTION;

-- and it lists the aggravating

11

circumstances, and the jury is told to check off on the

12

form what ones it finds.

13

put the mitigating circumstances.

14

say what they are.

And the form includes space to
And they're asked to

15

And then they’re told that if they find that

16

the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating,

17

they are to return the sentence of death.

18

M3. M0!<K;

That’s correct.

19

QUESTION;

Now, the use of the Victim Impact

20

Statement is not described on the form for sentencing.

21

It’s doesn’t fit into this very precise procedural

22

scheme at all.

23

And it appears to me that the Victim Impact

24

Law was, perhaps, gassed later and is kind of an add-on,

25

and that the

form nas never been adjusted to reflect how
27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

2

the jury is to use it.
And, indeed, in this case it was just the

3

subject of argument by the Prosecutor, I suppose, after

4

the Statement had been admitted.

5

And I*m concerned about what you see about the

6

kind of guidance that would meet Federal constitutional

7

standards in a death-sentencing scheme is required for

8

the use of victim impact statements.

9

MR. MONK;

Justice O'Connor, I would agree

10

with you that there is no place on the form for the jury

11

directly to consider victim impact evidence.

12
13
14

But I disagree with you that is not clearly a
part of the process.
The Maryland Court of Appeals in this case, I

15

think, addressed exactly your concern when it said the

16

victim impact evidence reflects the gravity or

17

aggravating circumstances of the crime.

18

There’s no place on the form, I might say, for

19

a description of the heinous nature of the crime, the

20

fact that the Bronsteins were bound and gagged and

21

stabbed numerous times.

22

for the jury to look at that evidence either.

23

QUESTION;

There's no place on the form

Well, I think if I'd been a juror,

24

I might have been quite confused about what use to make

25

of the Victim Impact Statement in a scheme like
23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Maryland's that has been made so specific.

2

And that's why I’m asking you for help.

3

MR. MONK;

Well, I suggest to you, Justice

4

O'Connor, that the process,

5

to do in this case and I think was Maryland's process

6

calls for, is that once the jury finds the threshold of

7

an aggravated murder, that it was committed in the case

8

in connection with a robbery, then they take into

9

consideration the circumstances of the crime, the victim

what the jury was supposed

10

impact, the defendant's criminal record, in considering

11

the aggravating gualitiy of the crime, and then weigh

12

that against the mitigating circumstances presented by

13

the defendant .
It's -- it's not there on the form, but it is

14
15

part of the process.

16
17
18

QUESTION;

Nowhere are they told to do that

MR. MONK;

Well, I think there could be an

instruction if there was not a request for such an

20

instruction in this case.

21

There was an instruction, however that say —

22

that said that you weigh — that gave -- the suggestions

23

to the jury about what an aggravating circumstance meant

24

and what a mitigating circumstance meant.

25

And I think that that kind of instruction is

16

MR. MONK:

That’s right.

17

The Statute — til e General Assembly has

18

defined what evidence is admissible in a capital case.

19

And among that list is a pre-sentence report including

20

the Victim Impact Statement.

21

And that’s how it comes into the process.

HR. HONK:

determine whether the sentence of death was imposed

under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other

2

arbitrary factor.
In this rase, the Court of Appeals concluded

3
4

that the introduction of the victim impact evidence did

5

not present an arbitrary factor.

6

As a final consideration, the Court of Appeals

7

undertakes a proportionality review to determine whether

8

the sentence is excessive or disproportionate to the

9

penalty imposed in a similar case, considering both the

10

crime and the defendant.
It is, I suggest to you, in the face of this

11
12

carefully devised statutory scheme, that Petitioner

13

would have this Court rule that victim impact evidence

14

cannot be introduced consistent with the Eighth

15

Amendment.

16
17
18
19

20

We submit to do so would be improper extension
of the Eighth Amendment jurisprudence of this Court.
It has long been recognized that retribution
is a valid rationale for the death penalty.
In non-capital cases, it is typical in

21

assessing a punishment to be imposed to consider the

22

impact of the crime upon the victim.

23

As Justice Marshall noted earlier, Maryland

24

just suffered through a savings and loan crisis.

And I don't think it offended the Eighth
Amendment in any way, shape,

or form to do so.

Indeed, we recognize in our system of legal

8

process, to paraphrase the words of Justice Stewart in

9

Gregg, that channeling the instinct for retribution

10

through the administration of criminal justice is

11

essential in an ordered society that asks its citizens

12

to rely upon legal processes rather than self-help to

13

vindicate their wrongs.

14

Consequently, it is entirely consistent with

15

this long-recognized precept of criminal justice that

16

Maryland provide the sentencer in capital cases with a

17

victim impact information that can be used in

18

considering what retribution should be exacted as a

19

consequence of tie defendant's conduct.

20

Significantly the Maryland Court of Appeals in

21

this case held that there is a reasonable nexus between

22

the impact of the crime upon the victim's family and the

23

facts and circumstances surrounding the crime,

24

especially as I said before, as to the gravity or

aggravating quality of the offense.

Thus, the Maryland Court appropriately gives

2

deference to the Maryland statutory scheme and holds

3

that victim impact evidence is admissible simply as

4

another circumstance of the crime.

5

It is not, and let me emphasize this, indeed

6

it cannot be, under the Maryland law, a call for the

7

death penalty.

8

This is not private vengeance.

9

Instead, it simply provides additional

10

probative information that the sentencer can use in

11

weighing the aggravating nature of the crime against

12

whatever mitigating circumstances it has found.

13

The introduction of this victim impact

14

evidence is not as Petitioner suggests "wholly

15

arbitrary."

16

Under the Maryland statutory scheme, it must

17

be admitted in every case whether it is traumatic or

18

inconsequential.

In

No, it could not as far as I can

MR. MONK;
see, Justice Powell.

I was speaking about the foreseeability of
this, and let me just finally make my points on that.
Indeed, if you — if we accept the premise

6

that the defendant knows or should have known that

7

there’s a family to be harmed when he commits the

8

murder, then

9

it is called upon to recognize whether he felt any

as the sentencer judges his moral capacity,

10

concern or remorse for the harm caused to the victim and

11

the victim’s family.

12

In this case, the evidence showed the

13

defendant was particularly callous to the grave harm he

14

caused others when he described to his cohorts that they

15

should pay no mind to the brutally murdered bodies of

16

Mr. and Mrs. Eroistein when

17

to ransack and steal more property.

18

they returned to the house

He, ob/iously, was totally unconcerned

that

19

the Bronstein family would suffer greatly from his

20

brutal acts.

21

22
23

He was simply concerned about taking their
property without getting caught.
Nevertheless, I suggest to you that it was or

24

should have been completely

foreseeable to Booth,

25

especially considering he lived two houses down the
50
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

street, that the family would suffer greatly as a direct

2

result of his conduct.
Consequently, it is not at all unfair to

3
4

require that the sentencer consider victim impact

5

evidence in making a moral judgment regarding Booth's

6

crimes.

7

One other point that I want to respond to that

8

the Petitioner has made is the emotional impact of this

9

evidence.

10

Petitioner claims that victim impact evidence

11

is so emotionally charged as to introduce an arbitrary

12

factor that will disrupt the exercise of the guided

13

discretion of the sentencer.

14

Victim impact evidence may well be emotional.

15

However, by itself, this should not be a

16
17

problem of constitutional dimension.
First, the trial court can instruct the jury

18

upon the use of victim impact evidence, although as I

19

have said here, he was not requested to do so.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
Initially, one technical problem:

The State,

4

very confidently, aas said the Maryland Statute doesn’t

5

matter whether you know it’s a police officer or not.

6

The Court of Appeals has disagreed with that

7

in a case cited by the State and in the briefs -- I

8

won’t give you the cite -- the Court of Appeals did

9

think it mattered

10
11

So I don’t think that it supports the State’s
position whatsoever.

12

Also, —

13

QU ESTION:

14

MR. BURNS:

(Inaudibles.) — is it a defense?
Yes, Your Honor.

15

that the Court of Appeals --

Yes, Your Honor.

Loiowski versus State just cites

in the State’s brief -- it’s 302 Md. 691.
So that has been decided in a contrary way.

1

I think, it »as intriguing that the State took

2

the position

that, to Justice Stevens* question, that

3

you could have an aggravating factor that a defendant

4

had children, three children presumably.
Well, if that's true, I think you can go a

5

6

step farther.

7

could say, it's an aggravating factor if you have four,

8

not it you have two.

9

good idea that people didn't have children and wanted to

10

control our population, presumably the State could under

11

those circumstances say, then it's only an aggravating

12

factor if there are no children.

And under this theory is, for example, we

In short,

13

Or perhaps, if we thought it was a

I think what the State's done is

point out the completely arbitrary nature of these

things that have really nothing to do with the crime

itself.

factor.

(Inaudibles. ) -- aggravating

Why is that more -- (Inaudibles. )
HR. BURNS:

Well,

Your Honor, I think all the

20

other aggravating factors are things that are focusing

21

on precisely what the defendant did.

If you assume that the only thing

relevant is how evil is the defendant.

to introduce anything but the most arbitrary standard.

QUESTION:

You may think that the difference

don’t.

And I don’t think your law states that.

MR. BURNS:

I’ve never suggested that was arbitrary.

On the contrary, I think it’s --

MR. BURNS:

if we accent that, if we accept that, then I think it

becomes reasonable to weigh is, who is this victim in

the community?

that way.
And the guestion is:
