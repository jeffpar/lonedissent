We will hear

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. PHELAN.

Mr. Chief Justice» and nay it

please the Courts
This case is here today on a petition — or

11

for a writ» rather» of certiorari to the Colorado

12

Supreme Court» which did suppress a statement made by

13

the defendant.

14

I will very briefly summarize the facts» and

15

then 1*11 explain why the court below misconstrued this

16

Court's decision in Miranda v. Arizona.

17

And 1 would like to point out that in my

18

opening brief in this Court I really did not go into alt

19

of the facts that supported the trial court's conclusion

20

that this waiver was knowing and voluntary.

21

really my opportunity to get those facts out.

22

So this is

Again» the case involves the validity of this

23

Miranda waiver.

agreed to sell some stolen guns to Federal agents.

25

were Alcohol» Tobacco and Firearms agents working

The facts are that the defendant here

He was arrested during the sale*

He was put

3

into a police car* and he was given his Miranda warnings

4

at this tine*

5

In addition» he was also given an additional

6

warning that he had the right to stop questioning at any

7

time; and he also had the right to stop questioning for

8

the purpose of obtaining counsel at any time.

9

He was then driven down to the local ATF

10

offices — this was in Kansas City — and he was again

11

given the warnings» and again» given the additional

12

warnings»

13

At that tine» he signed a written waiver» and

14

this written waiver is included in the record*

15

very specific*

16

attorney at this timet that he was willing to answer

17

questions; that he understood what he was doing; and

18

that no promises» threats» pressure or force had been

19

placed upon him.»

20

It's

It states that he did not want an

Soae of the additional factors showing that

21

this waiver was voluntary is the fact that this

22

defendant was 23 years old» and at the time of this

23

transaction* had quite a lot of prior involvement with

24

the criminal justice system*

25

He had murdered his aunt when he was 10 years

old* and shot another aunt at the same time*

2

when he was 18 and first released from his juvenile

3

detention* he wias convicted in Iowa of a robbery*

And then

About two weeks later* he was convicted also

5

in Iowa of a forgery case*

at the age of 20* convicted again in Iowa of robbery

There's nothing in the record to show that
this defendant was anything less than average

There's no indication of any sort of

QUESTION*

21

MS* PHELAN*

Yes* Your Honor*
That's a pretty brilliant statement.
The fact — the other factors

22

would also show there was no long* intensive

23

interrogation in this case*

24

quite freely with the officers when he did agree to

25

speak *

He spoke quite readily and

1

This interrogation did occur during normal

2

business hours*

3

afternoon*

4

It was at 3*00 o'clock in the

He was asked during this interrogation about

5

the gun charges» where he had obtained the guns» things

6

of that nature*

7

several questions concerning a homicide in Colorado*

8
9

And at the end of it» he was asked

The ATF agents knew about this homicide
because the Informant who had told then about the gun

10

transactions had also told then that this defendant had

11

admitted to then that — or had adnltted to hin» the

12

informant» that he had murdered soneone in Colorado*

13

Based on ail of these factors» the trial court

14

found that the defendant here was properly advised» that

15

he was aware of his rights* that he respondeo freely»

16

voluntarily and inte11 igentIy$ and specifically found

17

that there was no elenent of duress or coercion used

18

against hi a*

19

The Colorado Supreme Court» however» agreed

20

with the defendant that his waiver could not have been

21

knowing and intelligent*

22

What the Colorado Supreme Court did was apply

23

the totality of the circumstances test» and they held

24

that his awareness that they might question hin — or

25

rather» actually* his lack of awareness that they night

question him about this Colorado murder was one factor

2

to consider in the totality of the circumstances*

3

However* then the Colorado Supreme Court took

4

that one step further and held that this was a

5

determinative factor* because

6

the possible subjects of interrogation* then he couldn't

7

be aware of the consequences of his waiver*

if he didn't know all of

3

And in fact* the Colorado Supreme Court took

9

the entire analysis another step further and held that

10

this factor* his lack of awareness of the possible

11

subjects of interrogation* is such an important factor

12

that the totality of the circumstances test has to

13

actually be applied to that sole factor*

14

And so it must be determined now* in Colorado*

15

apparently In each case* whether or not the defendant

16

understands all of the possible subjects that he could

17

be interrogated upon after he agrees to speak with the

18

poI Ice*

19

So based upon this* the- Colorado Supreme Court

20

held that this waiver was not knowing* intelligent and

21

voluntary*

22

And 1 would insert at this time that the

23

defense has tried to raise an issue here of

24

voluntariness*

25

Court's opinion is written in that classic formula of*

And although the Colorado Supreme

May I proceed* Your Honor?

Before the break* I was discussing the Miranda
rule* and the balance that that rule was trying to
obtain.
Of course the two competing societal concerns

12

have been discussed many times now since Miranda.

13

have the very compelling societal interest in finding

14

and punishing criminals.

15

We

But we have* on the opposite end of that

16

scale* the passible risk that police will go too far in

17

their efforts and compel admissions in violation of the

18

Fifth Amendment..

19

So the Miranda case aid try* despite this —

20

QUESTION*

Ms. Phelan* may I ask you* if the

21

respondent had told police that he was willing to talk

22

to them about the firearms offense —

QUESTION;

could the officers have then

asked him about an unrelated offense* do you suppose?
NS. PHELANS

No* Your Honor* I think that that

would be a partial waiver.
QUESTIONS

Do we have any concern that that

6

was implicitly what the defendant did here» or at least

7

his understanding?

8

NS. PHELANS

9

QUESTIONS

No* Your Honor.
And what if the trial court were to

10

find» or to think* that implicitly the defendant

11

understood and intended to waive his rights only as far

12

as the firearms was concerned?

13

NS. PHELANS

Then I'm sure the trial court

14

would find only a partial waiver* and suppress any

15

statements concerning anything else.

16

QUESTIONS

And do you think that the mere fact

17

that all he is told about and all that* as far as the

18

circumstances indicate* he would think about was the

19

firearms —

So that's pretty ciear» that whatever we start

13

if you

say something that can be used

The balance which was struck by Miranda was to

give the defendant sose control» as you pointed out» so

that the defendant has the power

2

intend to question hits not about charge A but about

charge B * the waiver is ineffectual*

4

MS* PHELAN*

Weil* Your Honor» this Court

5

Could» of course» adopt that rute» and add on that fifth

Miranda requirement*

7

the Court would then be opening up the floodgates*

8

Because the theoretical underpinnings for that rule

9

would have to be that the consequences that he would

But there would be — in a sense»

10

have to be aware of are all those consequences that go

11

to his self-interest.

12

The next hypothetical case I could see before

13

this Court would be one where they told him the nature

14

of the charges but they didn't tell him ali the

15

elements*

16

The next one after that would be one where

17

they didn't explain the possible severity of the

18

punIshment*

19

QUESTICN;

Well» Ms. Phelan» is that really a

20

fair treatment of Justice Scalia's suggestion?

21

there is language in Miranda» and I think you've

22

acknowledge this» that if there's trickery involved* or

23

something like that» that then that would make waiver

24

invalid*

25

Because

I suppose at least it'd be theoretically

possible to say that in order to avoid trickery there is

2

an obligation to give some information about the extent

CRAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS, ESQ.,

8

AS AMICUS CURIAE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

11

MR. ROBBINS.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
I'd like to begin my remarks by addressing the

12

questions regarding deception that were posed at the

13

tail end of my co-counsel's argument a few moments ago.

14

First, a factual question raised by Justice

15

O'Connor about what it Is exactly the Supreme Court of

16

Colorado said.

17

As I recollect the opinion, Your Honor, what

18

they said was that there's some suggestion that the

19

police may have told respondent that their questions

20

would be in connection with a particular subject matter.

21

The Colorado Supreme Court, I don't think,

22

goes further than to say that that might be reflected in

23

the record.

24
25

My reading of the record suggests that there's
no — not even a whisper of that.

In point of fact, the

22

1979*

3

particular crime.

is not even in the slightest tied

4

in to a

And that written waiver* which acknowledged

5

the receipt of the rights* the understanding of the

6

rights* and the decision to waive the rights* which

7

respondent signed* and which this Court in North

8

Carolina v. Butler said is strong evidence that the

9

waiver

10

is valid* was in no respect — did

in no respect

incorporate any specific crine.

11

There's no testlnony that the agents* the ATF

12

agents*

13

hin that it would be

14

crine.

In proposing the waiver to the responoent told

I suggest that that is sinpiy an

18

Mr. Spring* by the way* did not testify at the

19

suppression hearing* so that point couldn't have energed

20

from his testimony either.

21

22
23

There's sinpiy nothing to suggest that kind of
trickery.
More fundanenta11y* however — and this

24

addresses* I think* the questions posed by Justices

25

Scatia and Stevens — it does not seen to the United
23

1

States that trickery and deception within the meaning of

2

Miranda could possibly comprehend the kind of deception

3

and trickery that the Supreme Court of Coloraco may have

4

been averting to*

5

In point of fact» respondent suggests in his

6

brief that the agents structured their questions in such

7

a way as to enshroud their real agenda*

8

sees it» the agents tricked him into believing that they

9

were simply Investigating a f irearms case» not a

As respondent

10

homicide casei and so deceived» the respondent

11

involuntarily waived his rights*

12

Well» there's no disputing that under Miranda

13

a waiver cannot be the product of trickery or

14

deception*

There's no quarrel about that*

15

But even if the failure» the simple failure»

16

to disclose the topics of interrogation were part of a

17

calculated effort by the agents to deceive the

18

respondent —a conclusion» by the way» which the triai

19

court flatly rejected» and which neither appellate court

20

disturbed in the slightest — that is simply not the

21

kind of deception that Miranda is talking about*

22

As this Court held last term in Moran v*

23

Burbine the kind of trickery that can vitiate a waiver

24

is conduct» "that deprives a defendant of knowledge

25

essential to his ability to understand the nature of his

2

m

I suggest that questions posed of a suspect*

3

even if structured in such a way as to camouflage the

4

officers* true agenda* cannot fit within this closely

5

cabined rubric of deception as proscribed by Miranda*

6

QUESTION *

Why wouldn*t it affect the

consequence of abandoning his rights?

8

9

the—ti_EJLax.ms offense* and it turns out he*s giving

16

But I think as Moran against Burbine

It doesn't refer to every consequence that may

The only consequence — the only consequence

17

— that Miranda is intended to inform the suspect about

18

is the simple and single consequence that anything he

19

says can be used against him*

21

that* he's not entitled to know*

QUESTIONS

Well» Mr* Robbins» does that mean

3

that for example if the police officers falsely told him

4

they had a fat of evidence that Implicated him» and it

5

was just totally contrived» that wouldn't affect his

would not be the kind of deception that would be

HR* BENEZRA*

The Colorado Supreme Court's

decision is also supported by this Court's decision in

Fare v* Michael C*

In Fare* this Court* in upholding

10

the validity of the respondent's Miranda waiver* noted

11

that the respondent was aware that he was to be

12

questioned about a murder*

13

Fare suggests that a suspect's awareness of

14

the nature of the offense is a relevant factor under the

15

totality of the circumstances*

16

Petitioner asserts that the ruling of the

17

Colorado Supreme Court would* in practice* require the

18

police to take or the role of counsel*

According to petitioner* police officers would

It is also Important to note that while a

7

number of Jurisdictions have adopted the totality of the

9

Court in Spring* they have similarly rejected waiver

10

challenges on the grounds suggested by petitioner*

In Moran v* Burbine* this Court described
