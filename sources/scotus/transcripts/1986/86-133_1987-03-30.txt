THE APPELLANTS

the California Coastal Commission that they dedicate an

2

accessway covering approximately one-third of their

3

property, for public use.

4

6

QUESTION:

Hr.

Best, may I ask you to' address

a preliminary question that

is troubling me.

The allegation of California is that the

7

Nollans went ahead during the litigation and rebuilt the

8

house, and that under California law, that amounts to a

9

waiver of their right to challenge the constitutionality

10
11
12

13

of the permit.
How is that dealt

with below?

And what is

your response to that problem?
HR. BEST:

The issue was never raised below,

14

Justice O’Connor, so it was not decided by the courts

15

below in this case.

16

QUESTION:

Was the construction -- is it a

17

fact that the construction was carried out pending this

18

litigation?

19

HR. BEST:

20

without the permit.

21

QUESTION:

22
23

Yes.

The house was constructed

Was that after the matter was heard

by the Court of Appeal in the California courts?
MR. BEST:

The construction was going on

24

during the time this case was on appeal.

And our point

25

here, on that particular argument, is that the

presentation by the Attorney General and our response to

2

that in our -- our response to the second motion to

3

dismiss is, that that is not California law; that what

4

California law provides --

5

6
7

QUESTION:

Well, what do you expect us to do?

To decide the California law question here?
HR. BEST:

No, I don't believe it’s necessary

8

to decide that question here, because I think California

9

law on the point is very clear.

10

QUESTION;

Well, we'd have to decide that then.

11

MR. BEST;

I don’t believe so.

I guess to the

12

extent, if this Court believes there is a question as to

13

whether or not a waiver of a right to follow a judicial

14

proceeding has occurred.

15

Our point is that

16

already decided that point,

17

that mandamus is always available.

18

the courts below have
and the courts have said

There was a recent California Supreme Court

19

decision in the Candid Enterprises case, which is cited

20

in our response,

21

the same issue and expressly said that, although a

22

waiver may occur as to past

23

that had occurred, preceding -- in reliance -- not

24

challenging the permit, that the remedy of mandamus is

25

always available.

where the Court essentially dealt with

expenditures, as to damages

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001
’

(202) 628-9300

1

And that has been California's proceeding all

2

along the line.

Otherwise, without the remedy, you put

3

the permit applicant in essentially this oroblem of

4

having to swallow an unconstitutional provision'.
And one of the things that were very --

5

6

concerning us, in terms of the argument that is being

7

made by the Atto-rney General here, is to suggest that

8

the permit processes may be used as an exaction

9

mechanism without regard to the facts of the case,

10

because it shifts the whole burden onto the property

11

owner.

12

Whenever the government wants a piece of

13

property, if they're lucky enough to have jurisdiction

14

over the owner for any reason where a regulatory permit

15

is involved --

16

QUESTION;

You would agree, would't you, Mr.

17

Best, that your client proceeds at his peril in this

18

respect; that if he loses here, he's then bound by the

19

California Coastal Commission requirement?

20

MR. BEST;

Absolutely, Your Honor.

He must --

21

if this case — if the decision of the Court of Appeal

22

is not reversed, the Nollans are obligated to make the

23

dedication of the property for the public right of way.

24
25

QUESTION;

Could you tell me precisely what

the access right would be?

Is it just across the rear

MR. BEST:

That's correct --

QUESTION;

It's lot through -- from outside

The Commission —

No, it is not an access from the
It is an access along the beach.

It's between the high water mark

and what?

10

MR. BEST;

And the seawall.

11

QUESTION;

And how far is that?

12

MR. BEST;

There's some dispute as to how far

13

it is.

14

at this time, we're talking about approximately 35 feet.

15

But according to the property records that exist

QUESTION:

And that is — and you have title

MR. BEST:

The Nollans have title tothat.

— if -- if you lose

the

19

case, then people nay not only cross — cross that

20

piece, but they could just use it?

MR. BEST:

No.

The dedication provision is

Honor.

access, your ability to go out and say, well, sure you

8

can walk up and down, but you can't stand and talk, the

9

Nollans feel that once the door is opened, the ability

10

to interject any sort of effective control is going to

11

be lost.

That would be passing and repassing?

QUESTION-.

Yes.

16

MR. BEST:

Yes, sir, they do surf there now.

17

They can surf there without the accessway, and this is a

18

popular surfing araa.

20
21

QUESTION;

Well, not when it's at high tide.

What happens when -MR. 3EST;

Well, surfers — as a surfer, they

22

go in at the — at the open public access areas that

23

exist a few hundred yards to the north, and a few

24

hundred yards to the south of the Nollans' property.

25

And than, of course, they can paddle their surfboards

3

And if they surf in, they turn around and go
back out again.

4

So it doesn’t really have a significant impact

5

currently.

6

without the access provision that’s there, is the point

7

I’m trying to make.

Best, would it be a

taking under your view of the case if they insisted on

10

— if the regulation was not in the form it is, but

11

said, you may not build a fence along the side to

12

interrupt with the passage?

13

MR. BEST:

No, Your Honor.

14

QUESTION:

That would not be --

15

MR. BEST:

He think there's a very important

16

distinction with this case,

regulation of use, as the prohibition on building

18

anything would be a regulation on use.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

is that it is not a

Why is it different in practical

effect from a prohibition against putting up a fence?
MR. BEST:

It's different in a practical

22

effect because what is happening is, you are actually

23

transferring a property to the government, and other

24

people are obtaining an interest in your property.

25

QUESTION:

Well, that’s a difference in legal

2

for a person living there?

3

But what's the difference in practical effect,

HR. BEST;

It's a

difference in practical

4

effect specifically in they have no -- they lose their

5

ability to go out and ask people not to be there.

That's true, but if the fences

They don't lose their ability to

13

That is correct.

17

MR. 3EST;

That is correct.

18

QUESTION;

It seems to me that's the practical

19

equivalent of a fence.

20

MR. BEST;

Which of course --

That's all a fence does.

No, I think it's the opposite of a

21

fence.

22

to put up a fence, then they would not have a physical

23

barrier, but they could still go out and say, don't

24

cross, you know -- don't cross the beach.

25

In other words, if they were denied the ability

Put Up a fence?

2

MR. BEST:

Well, you couldn’t put up a fence

3

without a coastal development permit.

4

that they’re not going to approve that.

5
6
7

And again, you see, that would be a regulation
of use .
QUESTION;

Most people don’t trespass even

8

without a fence, I take it?

9

people in California, don’t you?

10
11

MR. BEST;

13

fence; other people do.

in California.

to stop them from trespassing?

And there’s clear

Some people do not trespass without a

open access for anybody.
QUESTION:

Can you put a -- if you win this

case, can you put up a sign, private beach?
MR. BEST:

If you

have a coastal development

permit, you can put up a sign.
QUESTION;

Will you get one?

Can you get one,

if you lose this case?
MR. BEST:

I doubt very seriously that it

would be approved.

24

QUESTION:

Hold your breath.

25

MR. BEST;

But again, you see, that’s a

line on the seawall:

Point B?

QUESTION:

You couldn’t even do that?

8

NR. BEST:

That’s correct.

6

9

permit.

And, again, you --

again, the Nollans ace not disputing that.

And Justice

10

Stevens, I want to go back to that and emphasize, the

11

Nollans feel there is a big difference between being

12

told -- their being told not to do something on their

13

property, and being told to allow somebody else to do

14

something on their property.
And whether that is being told not to put up a

15
16

fence, or not to put up a sign, that -- or being told

17

not to build on the beach area, they concede that the

18

state has that authority.
QUESTION:

19

But if you win this case, you could

20

have a -- you could hire two people, one in one chair at

21

one end of the private property, and one in the other

22

end, and say, sorry, don’t go beyond this point?

23
24
25

MR. BEST:

Well, let’s look at in a practical

QUESTION:

I mean that wouldn’t require a

sense.

MR . BEST:

That could be hired

that could

be done without a permit.

4

QUESTION:

What would you do about the

surfboard that came in?

6

somebody on each end, you can't stop that man from

7

coming in?

8
9

MR. BEST:

If you do assign — put

That's correct.

A man can come in

Faria Beach is a variable beach.

The sand

20

the Nollans to be able to exclude the public; times

QUESTION;

Mr. Best, the -- the other side,

21

California constitution.

24
25

They

HR. BEST:

the state already

I cannot believe they made that

argument, Your Honor.
Again,

in our reply brief, we point out that

the constitutional provision has been -- has been

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

interpreted several times by the California

2

Court and by several Courts of Appeal, and it has never

3

been interpreted — in fact,

4

opinion on this natter says

5

has never been interpreted to allow the public a right

6

of access across private lands.

7

Supreme

the Attorney General's own
that these — that provision

I simply -- and the case they cited in their

8

brief do not stand for that proposition.

9

very cases reinforce that private land is private land.

10
11
12

In fact, those

The Malians' fee title is no less than anybody
else's fee title.
QUESTI3M;

Well, one would think that if that

13

were the constitution of California, the Court of Appeal

14

would have said sone thing about it.

15

MR. BEST;

And you would think there would be

16

no need for even asking for

17

place, because the right would already exist.

18

the exaction in the first

The Commission had never believed

that they

19

had this right without this.

20

reference to maybe there are prescriptive rights, or

21

maybe there was an implied dedication, although none of

22

those matters were ever decided either by the Commission

23

or the courts below, but never referred to the fact that

24

we have an absolute right under the California

25

constitution for access.

The Commission made

(202) 628-9300

1

2
3

I simply don’t know where that argument came
from .
Now, on this case, we would like to emphasize

4

that since it is not a regulation abuse, since ‘what we

5

are dealing with here is not a prohibition on the

6

Nollans, and

7

this property is stringently regulated.

I mean, recognize this.

You have a very small

8

piece of property that is only allowed for single family

9

residential use, and it is very stringently regulated in

10

terms of health and safety standards as to what you can

11

build there.

12

And the Nollans are complying with all of

13

that, and not challenging any of that.

14

really a land use issue, in the sense that nobody’s

15

asked to change the approved land use, a land use which

16

has been in effect for over half a century.

17

rfhat tie question

This is not

here is, in essence, the

18

19

second level

Nollans had to acquire from

21

governments.

22

the county and local

So the controlling factor in a takings

23

analysis when applied to this type of case is the

24

character of the governmental action being involved

25

here; the fact that, indeed, what we have here is the
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

government engaged in an acquisition program.

2

3
4

There is an established state program to
develop a roadway along the beach.

It's set forth

preliminary in tie statute, and then the Commission, in

5

its policy guidelines, adopted for the whole state,

6

expressly says they're going to take this kind of an

7

accessway from any kind of development, without regard

8

to what it is, as long as it's not expressly exempted in

9

the statute.

10

The guidelines go so far as to say, look at

11

the need for access, and look at the property's ability

12

to give that access, and don't — don't look at what the

13

property owner is doing when you decide to take that

14

access.

15

In the staff report, in making the decision,

16

the Commission refers to the comprehensive program right

17

at Faria Beach itself to obtain this kind of an

18

access way.

19

QUESTION:

Well, what -- could the — suppose

20

you had applied for this right to rebuild this house,

21

and you are making it larger?

22

MR. BEST*.

Yes, sir.

REBUTTAL ABSUMENT 3F ROBERT K. BEST, ESQ.,

2

SON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

3

MR. BEST;

4

I’d like to address quickly two concessions

Irll bs brief, Your Honor.

5

made by counsel in her presentation, conceding that

6

there must be the reasonable relationship test applied

7

in this case, and also earlier, a concession that if the

8

case is limited to an evluation of the facts of the

9

Nollans, she would concede that they were in trouble.

10

So in essence what their argument is is that

11

there must be a reasonable relationship test, but the

12

reasonable relationship is between their legislative

13

findings, or their statewide program, and what they are

14

doing, and not on the facts of the case.

15

And that’s our fundamental concern here, is

16

that this taking analysis should be performed on the

17

facts of the case.

18

20

QUESTION;

But Mr. Best, let me just ask you

right there.
Suppose well in advance of this conveyance

21

they had passed a law that said, there shall be no

22

further development of property that improves —

23

increases the interruption of visibility unless this

24

action is granted.

25

Just a

flat rule across the board.

Would you

1

then say that each time a piece was granted, you have to

2

test the particular property?

3

general basis?

Or could you test it on a

4

I don't Know is that question is clear or not.

5

KR. BEST:

6

general basis,

7

a taking and

8

I think you could try to do it on a

QUESTION!

No, no, my question is, if they can

9

justify it as a whole, would that mean that any

10

particular property owner could get in effect an

11

exemption from it by saying, yes, but the reason for the

12

rule really doesn't apply to my property, because I'm

13

only slightly enlarging the house?

14

SR. BEST:

That would be our position, Your

15

Honor, that they would have to have that exemption

16

because of the takings clause.

17

He can justify it in a police powers sense,

18

and having a

19

if the effect of that is to take the property, each

20

individual property owner is entitled to show on the

21

facts of his or her case that that would be the result.

22

rational basis for what they're doing.

When you look at the facts of this case,

23

they're relying on this visual access concept.

24

know, quite frankly, that's strictly a made-up

25

proposition.

In otiar words, they decided to take this

access befor e it was remanded to them.

And when it was

But if yoa look at the facts of the case, if

5

you look at the picture on page 267 of the Joint

6

Appendix, you have a picture taken from the road across

7

a one-story house almost — very similar to what used to

8

exist on the fiollans* property, toward the ocean, and

9

what do you see?

10
11

You see no beach.

You see no surf.

You see no ocean.
The fact of

the matter is here, from the

12

roadway, if you look at the beach, anything that is more

13

than about six feet high, if that's how tall you are,

14

blocks your view.

15

There was no visual access with the old

16

development on the property.

pictures in the record, and

a declaration in which he

18

described the pictures, and

says, look it, I've stood at

19

all these points and looked

at the ocean and you can't

20

see anything.

21

Mr. ffollan submitted

It's just simply the Commission's legislative

22

finding that anytime you build a bigger house you're

23

going to block visual access which they're relying on.

24
25

They won't look at the facts of the case.
They won't lock at what is happening to the Nollans.

And I think that’s a particular concern when

2

we’re dealing with a question of is there sufficient

3

information in tie record to make a decision in this

4

case.

5

6

The facts in this case are relatively simple,
and they’re all clearly in the record.

You had a house that was there.

8

It was being

It blocked all view of

The only thing the Nollans did was to build

a bigger house.
They had to go above the 10 percent, because

12

as the trial coact said in its original findings, 10

13

percent on the oLd louse wasn’t enough to add a decent

14

closet to the house;

15

was not acceptable for a family dwelling.

16

And so the Nollans were caught.

17

caught in a situation where they were a member of a

18

trust before this permit process ever --

Was the house longer from side to

side that it was?
MR. 3EST;
in all ways.

Justice White, the house is bigger

It’s wider, it’s deeper, and it's taller.

23

Toe reason it doesn’t block view, though, is

24

because in the older house there were fences that went

25

out from the house to the property lines which blocked
