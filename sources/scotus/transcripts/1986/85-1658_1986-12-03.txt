ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,

OS BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

13

MR. WALLACE;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court;
The Pole Attachments Act of 1978,

which the

14

Court of Appeals held unconstitutional in this case, was

15

enacted in response to a particular concern expressed in

16

the Congressional committee reports and hearings, and in

17

a staff report of the Federal Communicaticns Commission

18

that was submitted to Congress.

19

That concern is properly understood against

20

the familiar backdrop of State public utility

21

regulation, under which electric and telephone companies

22

are granted monopoly power through franchising, and are

23

allowed to use public rights of way for their poles, or

24

to acquire easements across private property for that

25

purpose, sometimes by use of power of eminent domain.
3

(202) 628-9300

1

And in return for

these monopoly privileges,

2

State public utilities commissions regulate the rates

3

that the utilities can charge their customers to assure

4

that they are just and reasonable, and provide a fair

5

rate of return.

6

The particular concern that was the focus cf

7

Congressional attention was that a new class of

8

customers of these utilies, cablecasters, who were

9

renting excess space on the utility poles, were very

10

frequently being omitted from the protection of rate

11

regulation by the State public utilities commission

12

while being subjected to the superior bargaining

13

position of the utilities companies that resulted from

14

their government-conferred monopoly power.

15

And the committee reports on the till, in

16

describing the testimony before Congress, are replete

17

with references to such phrases as "superior bargaining

18

position,” "exorbitant rental fees," "extract monopoly

19

rents," "virtual contracts of adhesion," and at one

20

point pointing out that once the cablecaster has strung

21

his wires on the pole, then

22

substantial increases in rates without explanation cr an

23

opportunity fcr negotiation.

24
25

he could be subjected to

So Congress* solution to this problem that had
been brought to it was to give the Federal

2

State commissions asserted jurisdiction over these

rates, authority to resolve disputes between the

10

So the Act applies only when there has been an

13

QUESTION;

Mr. Wallace, does the act and does

14

the FCC permit a utility company to terminate a pole

15

attachment lease?

16

MR. WALLACE;

There is no doubt that if the

17

contracts, as they typically do and as these do, give

18

the utility company the right to reclaim the space for

19

its own purposes, that it can do that.

20

If there is no such term in the contract, then

21

it is an open question whether the utility company

22

could, under

the act, terminate.

23

There has been no attempt to terminate.

24

QUESTION:

25

But is that a condition to their

11

asserting that this is not a voluntary arrangement, as

12

you're maintaining it is?
What is the regulations had said the same

thing?

The FCC has done this by adjudication/ but could

15

as well have said in the regulation, anybody who's in a

16

contract shall not be able to get out simply because

17

we're requiring a lower rate?
If

18

it said that in the regulation, I don't

19

think we would require the utility to try to get out of

20

the contract before it could come before us and say --

21

and say, this is not a voluntary agreement that we're

22

in.

23

We're in an involuntary agreement.
MR. WALLACE;

We're not saying that they

Wallace, before you go on, if

QUESTION;

Right.

And that's essentially what

the FCC has been using, right?
MR. WALLACE;

No, Your Honor, they have taken

20

the position that if they are reducing the rate from the

21

contract rate, they can only reduce it to the maximum

22

allowable under the statute, which is the so-called

23

fully allocated cost.

24
25

And that includes a component for the
so-called cost of capital, and namely, a component for a

8

rates, and not being allowed to adhere to the

9

contractual rates, rather than about the attachment

10

itself, what we have here is an objection to the statute

11

which, while it's in the form of a takings complaint,

12

the objection is at bottom a complaint of loss of a

That would follow under that

10

The statutory formula is quite malleable, and

11

can be expanded in application to include elements that

12

a reviewing court would believe required in order to

13

afford just compensation.

QUESTION:

Do we have to approve the entire

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY E. RICKS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
HP. RICKS:

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I’m appearing on behalf of the cable company
and cable association parties that participated in the
proceeding below.
In regard to the questions that were
propounded to Hr. Wallace, let me Just add that only the
State of California requires access to utility poles for
purposes of cable television.
No other State has such a statute, although a
number of States do regulate this acitivity.

And when

they regulate this activity, under the Federal statute,
there is an automatic preemption by

the States.

There is no Federal requirement of access.
In this case, there was no local compulsion of
access.

The utility voluntarily licensed -- in fact,

has licensed cable systems for over 20 years, to use

2

excess space on its poles.
I would to just make this observation, that

3

the very purpose of the Pole Attachment Act was to

4

prevent utilities such as Florida Power from charging a

5

rate for the cable attachment that was based cn the

6

scarcity value or the hold-up value of the pole.

7

As Hr. Wallace noted, Congress found that

8

utilities controlled a critical gateway tc the provision

9

of an important interstate communication service^ that

10

the utilities were seeking tc exact a monopoly profit

11

for the use of the gateway;

and that the regulation of

12

the gateway was required in

the public interest.

13

The statute, we believe, is thus similar to

14

the regulation of a grain elevator in Munn v. Illinois,

15

or other efforts by government or States to regulate an

16

essential — the use of an essential gateway in the

17

public interest.

18
19

20

The Eleventh Circuit, we believe, pushed the
loretto analogy far beyond the facts of this case.
In Loretto, as distinguished from this case,

21

the Hew York statute mandated that the cable come cn the

22

premises of an unwilling property owner.

23

Here, the FCC -- neither the FCC nor the

24

statute vests in th cable company any right to have

25

access to utility property.

QUESTION:

Mr. Ricks, did the contract give

the utility the right to simply go out of the business

8

MR. RICKS:

9

Mr. Chief Justice, the contract

10

renewable, six months or year increments after that; at

11

which time, presumably, it could, if it wished to, go

12

out of that business.

13

The Congress observed, in not creating a right

14

of access, that it didn't think that would ever be a

15

problem, because under the statutory provision of

16

compensation, the utility was getting a positive benefit

17

for an otherwise unproductive use of its property; and

18

therefore, it .would strain credulity to say, why would a

19

utility not wish to lower the revenue requirement for

20

its public subscribers and gc out of the use of --

MB. RICKS:

MR. RICKS;

Would the FCC stop that?

The FCC is not presented with that

And under the act, it would have, in my judgment,

That's a -- perhaps it's a hole in the act, a

And there has never been a case that I'm aware

20

of, at least, in which a cable operator successfully has

21

argued that I should have access to those pcles because

22

they're there.

23

They made a rational decision to exclude

cable, and the FCC and States have not interfered with

that decision.

1

Turning to the issue of compensation, we agree

2

with Mr. Wallace that there's no taking here under the

3

decisions of this Court.

4

But we also believe that even if ycu accept a

5

taking under the Loretto model, this statute provides

6

for just compensation.

7

Interestingly, Florida Power did not claim

8

that this statute was unconstitutional before the

9

Eleventh Circuit, but that the order of the FCC

10

constituted a taking of its property without just

11

compensation, because, Florida Power argued, the FCC set

12

the compensation on the basis of fully allocated cost,

13

rather than on the value to the cable system, which is

14

what Florida Power wanted.

15

The Eleventh Circuit, on a point that was not

16

briefed by any party, held that the statute was facially

17

unconstitutional because it prevented the FCC from

18

determining just compensation.

19

But in Alabama Power v. FCC, in a case before

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN J. TOPOL, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. TOPOL:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
At the outset,

11

I'd like to be clear as to what

12

it is that this case is about, and what the defect is

13

that we see in the statute.

14

Congress prescribed a binding formula for the

15

determination of the rates that utilities cculd charge

16

cable companies.

17

because Mr. Hallace indicated that the statute is mushy;

18

that it could expand -- the scheme was "malleable," his

19

term -- it could expand to provide just ccmpensaticn.

And this is an important point,

With all due respect, I believe that's

20
21

incorrect.

being the term that's tossed around in the triefs as

2

3

And in our view, herein lies the defect in

this statutory situation.

5

6

the same body which has fixed the compensation.

Congress, which has taken the

cable people who have a monopoly in their area, and the

17

utilities who have a monopoly for utility service, it

18

can address the problem.

19

But having decided to take, having decided tc

20

have utility customers subsidize, in essence, CATV

21

the judgment cf Article III courts to be compensatory,

2

it's all right.

3

MR. TOPOL;

I don't think it can, Ycur Honor.

4

Because I think the question of just compensation is a

5

case-by-case determination.
And as this Court said in the Mcncngahela

6

7

Navigation case is, once the Congress takes, the court

8

has to determine.
Nov the question is, how in each case is the

9
10

court going to determine what's just compensation?

11

cases of this Court, for example, the 564 Acres case,

12

says, the standard for just compensation is what will

13

put the party in the same pecuniary situation as he

14

would have been had there been no taking.

15

That's $6 for us in this situation.

16

The Olson case says, the standard of just

The

17

compensation is fair market value.

It explicitly says

18

in Olson, which we quote in cur brief, that it's net

19

enough to look at costs and to look at investment.

The

20

inquiry as to just compensation has to be broader.

And

21

QUESTION;

22

But why can't the Court of Appeals,

23

reviewing a decision of the FCC, make just that sort of

24

inquiry?

25

MR. TOPOL;

MR. TOPOL;

12

Well,

what the Eleventh Circuit

13

was saying in this case, Your Honor, is that the

14

statutory scheme is such that that kind of evidence can

15

never end up being presented before the FCC.

the fact that the FCC was operating with such a very,
very narrow inquiry and a narrow record, in this
statutory scheme, that is simply impossible for a
reviewing court to make a determination on.
And that's what bothered the Eleventh
Circuit.

very broadly, the FCC should

make a determination of just compensation in a
Constitutional sense, and that decision would be
reviewed by an appellate court, then we would have no
difficulty with that scheme.
But our difficulty is the fact that the FCC
isn't given the broad latitude to make a determination,
and indeed, tc make a record, even, with respect to just
compensation in a Constitutional sense.
QUESTION;

Then your position here is somewhat

different than that taken by the Eleventh Circuit, isn’t
it?
MB. TOPOL:

I don't believe so, Ycur Honor.

I

mean, I believe that what the Eleventh Circuit said the
defect in this statute was, and they quoted specifically
from the Monongahela Navigation case, if I may, to read
just two sentences, because I think

that's the essence.

It's the key quote in the Eleventh Circuit and it's the
essence cf our argument, is the court -- this Court, in

make the kind of broad-ranging inquiry; it doesn't

permit that kind of factual determination before the FCC

14

to permit that kind of record.

If we rewrote the statute and we said, the FCC may make

the compulsory aspects of Loretto, as to whether we put

the question of, can we take them off?
