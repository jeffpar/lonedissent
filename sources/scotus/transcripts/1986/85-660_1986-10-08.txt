MR. COATS.

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please the

16

we are here on a writ of certiorari to the Colorado

17

respondent* who Is the criminal defendant in the case

2

defendant as welt that he didn't have to talk to him*

but the defendant said It would be all right* that his

conscience had been bothering him and he wanted to talk

to him*
