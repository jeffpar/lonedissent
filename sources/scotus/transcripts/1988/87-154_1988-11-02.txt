ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD JAMES SULLIVAN
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. SULLIVAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We are here contending today not for a broad
constitutional mandate to the states to do all good
things to all people, nor do we contend for a broad
constitutional duty to prevent all harm or all sadness,
nor do we contend for a broad constitutional duty to
protect all children in all cases.
QUESTION:

(Inaudible) narrow one

MR. SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

(inaudible).

None in those situations --

Oh.

MR. SULLIVAN:

-- Justice White.

We do suggest that there is one and only one
exquisitely narrow circumstance where there is an
affirmative duty.

I would suggest that there are two

primary elements to the one and only one circumstance
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

for which we argue.
The first is the existence of a child/parent

relationship.

state in a particular circumstance which would have
three characteristics:

15
16

actual knowledge on the part of the agents of the state;
and the third, an actual undertaking by the state to
protect the child.
QUESTION:

19
20

You derive all this from the

language of the due process clause?
MR. SULLIVAN:

Indeed, Your Honor.

We think

it arises from that and from the nature of the
relationship and from the way the Court has -- has
accorded the relationship.

If I may -- if I may explain.

It is my view -- it is our view that the

17
18

the first, an extreme danger to

a particular individual child; the second, abundant

13
14

is what I term enmeshment,

intricate intimacy, enmeshment of the agents of the

The other

protector of the child,

the raiser of the child,

the

person with the right and the power and the authority
and the duty to educate the child,

teach the child,

provide medical care, all those parental things,
21

including setting bedtime,

is the parent and not the

22

state .
23
24
25

The -- the other side of that coin is that
there is one and only one circumstance where when the

family unit -- and I don't care whether it's a married
family or a step-parent or whatever, but when the child
is at home and the door is closed to the world, the
people with whom that child is locked in, his natural
and his inherent protectors, from those individuals
alone, whether it's a father, a step-mother, a live-in
girlfriend of what have you -- from those protectors
alone he has no protection.

And in that one and only

one circumstance, I think that's appropriate.
And I would further respond to your question,
Mr. Chief Justice, by saying this.

It is only in that

one circumstance, as I understand the cases -- it is
only in that one circumstance that the Court has already
interposed any aspect of the Constitution.
want that changed.

And I don't

I don't ask that that be applied to

a different circumstance.
What I'm saying is this.

Take the situation

where the child is locked behind the door with his
protector and the protector becomes the predator, and a
proceeding is brought at the extreme end of the child
protection spectrum to terminate the parental rights.
The Court has already said that the Constitution governs
that relationship.

The Court has already recognized it

in the relationship between the adult and the child that
the Constitution prevails and it prevails both

substantively and procedurally.
What I mean is this.

We know that any parent

has a constitutionally recognized right to the -- if I
may simplify it, to the possession of the child, care,
custody, companionship, all those -- all those kinds of
things that go with being a parent.

We also know that

that right of parenthood cannot be terminated except by
procedural due process protections.

So, I'm saying to

the Court that in that most intimate relationship, the
Court has already recognized that the Constitution has
application.
The Court additionally has recognized, I
believe, that a child -- indeed, any of us -- has a
constitutionally protected right to physical integrity,
to bodily protection.
QUESTION:

What I'm suggesting -A -- a right against the state.

MR. SULLIVAN:

And a right that -- that arises

out of the Constitution to remain alive, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

Well, but -- but it's protected

only against the state.

It's not protected against

private individuals.
MR. SULLIVAN:

Well, I think that's part of

22

what the Court is going to have to address in this case.
23

QUESTION:

Well, why don't we start with the

24
25

language of the Fourteenth Amendment which says that a
6

state shall not -- what does it state -- deprive any
person of life, liberty or property without due process
of law.

20

Now, certainly we've held in many

cases that the state may not deprive someone of life,
but we've never held that that provision protects in the
constitutional sense a private -- a private attack on
another person.
MR. SULLIVAN:

10
11

Yes, sir.

I agree with that, Mr. Chief

Justice.
And I would further agree that in the -- in
the context in which prior to today that question has
been addressed by the Court, I agree that that's the
correct holding.

For example, if you were to hold

otherwise, then the police department would have an
obligation to prevent the mugging and a whole host of
things that are simply unworkable and are not to be
found in the Constitution.
What I -- what I'm suggesting to you is that,
first of all, this is a question in the most intimate
relationship.

That has not been addressed, to my

knowledge, by the Court before.

And I think that it's

consistent with the nature of the circumstance that
we're dealing with, and I think it's consisterit with the

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

other constitutional applications the Court has afforded
to the child/parent relationship.
If you have -- if you have the parent and

child in an intimate relationship and the Constitution
properly lies in -- in that setting, and if the rights
of the parent with all of his natural powers in addition
-- if the rights of the parent are recognized, why
should the rights of the child be less recognized?
-- it seems to me that it's simply a balancing in -QUESTION:

are recognized to the extent that the state may not
interfere with it.

I think that's entirely true.

And -QUESTION:

And the -- and the question here is

the extent to which you impose a mandatory duty on the
state to act affirmatively to protect the child.
MR. SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

That's right, Justice --

And the fact that it's -- that

other cases are not workable seems to me not the point.
The question is where do you derive the duty.
MR. SULLIVAN:

Well, it occurs to me that you

22

derive the duty first and foremost from the nature of
23

the -- of the relationship that you're -- that you're
24
25

analyzing in a -- in a constitutional setting, and

admittedly apply in that relationship.
QUESTION:

Well, the only -- the only cases in

which the Court has found an affirmative duty on the
part of the state to provide basic services is in a
setting like a prison or a state institution where the
state has already deprived the individual of the
individual's liberty and institutionalized them.
MR. SULLIVAN:

Justice O'Connor, I -- I

generally -QUESTION:

This is certainly a step far beyond

that that you're asking us to take.
MR. SULLIVAN:

The only word I would -- I

would differ with you is -- is the word "far."

It

occurs to me -- obviously, the prison cases are in an
Eighth Amendment context, so they are not -- they are
not the identical setting.

The institutionalized,

hospitalized settings like Youngberg is the other
category to which -- to which I think you refer.
And I think that -- I think that's what the
notion of enmeshment -- and that's not a phrase that I'm
aware the Court has used.

That's -- that's a -- that's

a word that I use for my own understanding and the
clarity -- I hope the clarity of my own thinking -- that
I think that's what's described there is to what extent

in the life of this

If I may give an example.
QUESTION:

If -- if your theory were to be

accepted, it seems to me it would have a real deterrent
effect on state child abuse programs.

Why would a state

want to undertake a child abuse program at all if they
face liability if they guess wrong?

I can't -- I think

you're asking the Court to take a step that is perhaps
quite unwarranted and quite dangerous.
MR. SULLIVAN:

If -- if the circumstance were

as you -- as you phrased it, Justice O'Connor, I would
agree. If -- and the Seventh Circuit addressed that in
its razor's edge argument.

The Seventh Circuit said you

would put child protection authorities in a damned if we
do, damned if we don't situation.
But this Court relatively recently decided
Daniels and decided Davidson, and I think solves that
problem entirely because I understand under -- under
those cases that even if we guess wrong, we are safe
from liability.

And that's -- that's vitally important

here. I understand Daniels and Davidson -- again, to
21

simplify in -- in paraphrasing -- to say even if you're
22

negligent, it's okay in a 1983 setting.

And the Court

23

reserved for another occasion -- I think this may well
24
25

be the occasion -- the -- the question of something more
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

aggravated than -- than negligence.
But what I'm saying is this.

range of state action dealing with children, all conduct
that is -- let's assume that we can recognize some
standard.

All conduct that is negligent is not

actionable.
And it has never been in contest that if we
had the circumstance where the police officer or the
child protection worker or someone else were inflicting
a beating -- you know, that's not the kind of case we're
talking about.

And the next topic, obviously, that we

have to address is the question of whether it's gross
negligence, deliberate indifference or what have you.
So, I -- I respectfully and very strongly

15
16

All conduct that is proper, obviously, is not

actionable.

In the whole

suggest that it's not a question of do we guess wrong at
our peril.

Court, which I do not ask the Court to change, we've
already said to the child protection agency it's okay to
guess wrong.

brethren.
MR. SULLIVAN:

Yes.

The -- the -- the hangup that -- that I think
I've seen in reading the colloquy in our briefs on the
notion of intent -- we do not argue -- we certainly do
not argue that the case worker or the supervisor or the
county wanted this child dead.

That would be

irresponsible, and we don't make that claim.

But we do,

based on the record that's in -- in front of you -- and
I think the joint appendix at 109 to 160 is the -- is
the DSS case file itself, and that I find shocking -quite candidly, I find shocking.
We know that there were -- and Justice
Brennan, you alluded to this.

There are black and white

absolute mandates in the state statute that -- that say
when you receive a report from a doctor or from a nurse
or from an outside social worker or from a police agency
suggestive of child abuse, you shall investigate.

It

doesn't go into you got to do it this way or that way,
but you got to make a real investigation.

You got to do

it in a timely manner.
On the first occasion in January of 1982 that

the police reported suspected child abuse, they made an
investigation which was cursory but I can't fault them
at that point.

In January of 1983, they had a doctor report

that was, but I am prepared to say that the next
incident was.

The very next time she was in the house all of
the things that she had insisted on, all of the things
that had been guaranteed by the birth father, all of the
things that were necessary for the child's protection
had been absolutely thrown out the window.
For example, the father told the county that

We believe this case involves an attempt by
the Petitioners to transform the private wrongdoing of a
natural father into state action for purposes of
invoking the Fourteenth Amendment.

The primary issue

presented is whether a county's failure to prevent the
infliction of harm by a third party upon a person at
liberty constitutes a due process violation of the
Fourteenth Amendment.
We believe that there was no state deprivation

of a constitutionally protected right for three main
reasons.

First, the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of

liberty does not include a right to basic protective
services from the state.

Secondly, there is no state

action in a constitutional sense which caused a
deprivation in this case.

Third, we believe that the

23

actions of the social worker did not evince the state of
24
25

mind necessary to invoke the Fourteenth Amendment.

In addition, we believe that there are two
independent reasons for urging affirmance of the Seventh
Circuit's decision.

First, with respect to the

municipal Respondents, there was no policy or custom
which led to a deprivation and with respect to the
individual Respondents, we believe they are clearly
entitled to the defense of qualified immunity.
QUESTION:

The lower courts didn't reach any

of those issues, did they, because they found there was
no constitutional duty?
MR. MINGO:

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

It seems to us that what Petitioners are
attempting to do is use Section 1983, on one hand, and
the Fourteenth Amendment on the other hand to
affirmatively compel the states to act to protect.

Yet,

in analyzing the -- the legislative history and intent
of Section 1983, it's quite clear that the statute was
not designed for those purposes.
Section 1983 is remedial in nature.
Therefore, we must look to the -- the constitutional
right that the Petitioners seek to invoke by way of use
of Section 1983, which brings us precisely to the
Fourteenth Amendment.
The Fourteenth Amendment has been viewed by
this Court as imposing no constitutional duty upon the

states to provide substantive services to its citizens.
The Court also has held that if the state chooses to
provide some form of protective services, the Fourteenth
Amendment does not tell the state how far they must go
in providing those services.
QUESTION:

Mr. Mingo, if this child had been

in foster care placed by the state or the county, would
there be potential liability?
MR. MINGO:

Justice O'Connor, in that

instance, we believe there may well be potential
liability because in that case we have, at least
arguably, state action in the sense that the state took
a child out of his natural surroundings, arguably put
him in state-controlled surroundings and thereby
increased the risk of harm to that child.

In that

instance, I believe we may well have a case somewhat
analogous to the prison setting and perhaps more
analogous to the mental institution setting that was
present in Youngberg v. Romeo.

MR. MINGO:
QUESTION:

In January of 1983 -Because they had custody of the

child for a few days.
MR. MINGO:

-- the hospital had custody of the

child because of the fact that the juvenile court — not
the social workers, not the Department of Social
Services, but Wisconsin juvenile court -- through its
intake worker placed the child in the temporary custody
of a hospital.
QUESTION:

All right.

And assume, having done

that, the hospital now learns if we return the child to
his father, the father has the knife and is about the
abuse the child, do you say the state can go ahead and
return the child?
MR. MINGO:

Although that is certainly not the

case before this Court, in that instance, I believe from
a constitutional standpoint only a county or a
department of social services could return the child
without facing constitutional liability.
QUESTION:

Even with knowledge that there's --

even with knowledge of extreme danger and almost certain
serious abuse of this kind?
MR. MINGO:

Even with that knowledge, Your

QUESTION:

That's exactly what happened here.

MR. MINGO:

No, that's quite different from

what happened here.

Here we have a child being taken

out of his home for three days by the juvenile court and
then, because no petition was filed by the Corporation
Council which was -- had nothing to do with the decision
of the social worker, but the Corporation Council failed
to filed a petition.

QUESTION:

You --

you don't think the state or this agency had custody of
the child during that period?
14R. MINGO:

The agency I believe definitely

did not have custody of the child.
this was a state-run institution.

I also don’t believe
The reason that the

child was placed in this hospital was for -- primarily
for -- for observation and secondly because his father
could not be located.
The child was examined.

After the three days

in the hospital, it was the concurrence by the hospital
personnel and by the Corporation Council that evidence
of abuse could not be substantiated.

That automatically

triggered Wisconsin's statute coming into play which
required that the child automatically be returned to the
parent in the event a petition was not filed -QUESTION:

And the statute required whom to --

to return the child?
MR. MINGO:
QUESTION:

Pardon me?
Who was it that had the duty to

return the child?
MR. MINGO:

Wisconsin's statutes say that the

juvenile court -- not the social worker, but that the
juvenile court must return the child to the home in the

(Inaudible) state action too.
I don't believe in that instance

we would have state action because we have not done
anything to increase the risk of harm to that child,
whereas in Justice O'Connor's example, we certainly can
be said to have increased the risk of harm to the child
because we took that child away from his or her natural
surroundings and put that child into an arguably more
dangerous set of surroundings.

And we believe that's

what triggers state action.

Would the state have any

MR. MINGO:

Justice Scalia, I believe in that

set of circumstances there well may be liable -liability because we have state action -QUESTION:

So, what you're saying is what

makes a difference is whether you're just returning him
to the status he was in before you took over the
temporary custody.
MR. MINGO:

Is that -- is that the difference?
I believe that the important

factor to be looked at is whether or not the state
action can fairly be said to have increased the risk of
harm to that child.

If the answer to that threshold

question is yes, then I believe we have state action in
a constitutional sense.
QUESTION:

Increased it from what?

From what

it was before the state took custody or from what it was

QUESTION:

Poor Joshua.

QUESTION:

It's the -- I -- I guess the -- the

malfeasance was by the person who didn't file the
petition to change custody.
MR. MINGO:

If there was any malfeasance, that

certainly would be an argument.

The record is quite

clear, though, that all of the professionals in this
case, the pediatrician, the child psychologist, the
police officer who investigated the case -- they all
believed that abuse could not be substantiated.

Every

one of the professionals involved concurred, and the
record is absolutely clear in that regard.

They all

concurred that there was no evidence to substantiate a
claim for child abuse.

20

QUESTION: . Well, except the social worker.

MR. MINGO:

I'm now talking about the January

22

custody was placed with -- with the hospital.

At that

24

time there was an initial suspicion of child abuse which

after the three-day stay in the hospital, all

3

11

appears to us that state action has been found primarily
in two settings:

state goes out and directly inflicts harm upon an
individual; secondly, state action has been found in a
custodial setting where the state by its intentional act
deprives a person of liberty, and by depriving that
person of liberty, assumes a degree of control over that
individual such that they have a reasonable means of
protecting that individual, such as in a prison setting,
and where they assume some responsibility for that
individual's welfare.

There's

no doubt that the social worker was a state actor.

She

was a -- she was a public employee doing this, and her
acts were those of the state.

Your point really is that

she was not under a constitutional duty to do certain
things that your opponent says she was under a duty to
do.

correct.

Yes, Your Honor, you're quite

I use the term "state action," I'm trying to use it in a
constitutional sense which necessarily implies a
deprivation of a constitutionally protected right.
QUESTION:

And under your theory, I take it if

two policemen see a rape and watch it just for their own
amusement, no violation of the Constitution.
MR. MINGO:

We would concede that there is no

constitutional violation in that particular case.
QUESTION:

You're not -- you're arguing it as

well as conceding it.
(Laughter.)
MR. MINGO:

That's correct.

In this case it is undisputed by both sides
that there was no direct deprivation or direct
infliction of harm upon the Petitioners nor was the
Petitioner in the custody of the state at the time of
the alleged wrongdoing.
In order to circumvent the -- the state action
or constitutional deprivation requirement, counsel has
proposed in their brief a special relationship theory

20

which today they appear to call an enmeshment theory.
21

No matter what it is, this theory would hold states
22

liable wherever they have expressed a desire to afford
23

protection to an individual and where they have some
24
25

generalized knowledge of the victim's plight.

that such a theory has no support in the language of the
Fourteenth Amendment, no support in Section 1983, nor
does it have any support in any prior decision of this
Cour t.
What their theory would do is open up local
governments to massive new areas of exposure precisely
because of the fact that the states, if we were to
accept Petitioners' theory, become liable for the acts
of private wrongdoers.

There are numerous governmental

agencies other than social services departments which
seek to afford some degree of protection to the public.
Certainly police departments, fire
departments, emergency ambulance services fall into that
very same category.

It seems to us that if Petitioners

are to prevail in these types of cases, the effect will
be to greatly expand the financial drain on local
governments thereby making the very services that
Petitioners claim they wish to encourage less available

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

In fact, his --

No -- no barrier between

child/parent relationship?

MR. MINGO:

That -- that immunity was done

away in Wisconsin some 10 or 15 years ago.

And, in

fact, I might note that Randy DeShaney, the father, was
in fact a party defendant to this action when it was
first -- when the complaint was first filed.

He was

subsequently dismissed on a voluntary basis by counsel.
So, he was in fact a party defendant, and there was no
objection on the basis of immunity.
Again, we wish to emphasize that the problem
with this special relationship or enmeshment theory is
that it fails to distinguish between privately inflicted
harm and state action.

On the other hand, we believe

that the Court's adherence to the traditional state
action or constitutional deprivation requirement
provides a bright line standard which would separate
actions of,private wrongdoing from actions which can
fairly or truly be attributed to the states.
We also believe that the Petitioners cannot
prevail upon their Fourteenth Amendment claim because
the social workers in this case did not evince the state
of mind necessary to support a Fourteenth Amendment

21

action. This Court has recently told us in Daniels and
22

Davidson that negligence certainly is not enough.

And

23

the Court also indicated to us that traditionally the
24
25

due process clause has been applied to deliberate
44
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

2

decisions by government officials to deprive a person of
life, liberty or property.
This case we believe is even less

3
4
5

6
7

8
9

constitutionally compelling than Daniels and Davidson
because we are not dealing with a custodial setting, and
we are faced with claims of inaction versus action.

such circumstances, we have proposed that the requisite
state of mind must be that of deliberate indifference or
a failure to act.
And the reason we propose this heightened

10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17

state of mind requirement is twofold.

20
21

22
23
24
25

First, we believe

it avoids trivializing the Constitution by allowing
individuals to bring ordinary tort claims in the name of
the Fourteenth Amendment.

And we also believe that this

heightened state of mind requirement recognizes the
real-life dilemma which front-line social workers and
many other governmental workers face on a daily basis.
As the Seventh Circuit indicated below, social

18
19

In

workers truly do operate on a razor's edge.

First, a

social worker must respect the constitutional rights of
a parent to the care, custody and management of their
children.

Secondly, where a social worker's involvement

is on a purely voluntary basis, such as it was in this
particular case, she must walk a fine line to avoid
having the door slammed in her face thereby preventing
45

worker was -- was disregarding her duty under state law?
MR. MINGO:

clear.

22

The

only report of abuse which the department ever received
in this case was the initial report of suspected abuse.
Immediately following that report, there was an
investigation.

The child was placed in the hospital for

three days and then, since there was no filing of a
petition at the end of three days, the child was
automatically returned to the home.
After that first incident, there was
absolutely no further reports of abuse.
QUESTION:

Yes, but there was further

information received by the social worker, wasn't there?
MR. MINGO:

20
21

The only duty she had under state law was to

investigate when she received a report of abuse.

We certainly do not agree with

that position, and we believe the record is quite

state law, it's quite clear that the only duty that the
social worker had was to investigate.

And she only had

a duty to investigate when she received formal reports
of abuse.

Well, what -- what was the purpose
Wasn't there -- didn't the law --

doesn't the law say, well, and if you find out certain

MR. MINGO:
QUESTION:
MR. MINGO:

You keep saying

What's the difference?

The only formal investigation -Well, what is the difference?
A formal investigation is an

investigation triggered by the statute.

And the statute

only triggers a duty to investigate when the social
worker receives a report of abuse.
QUESTION:

Well, what's the difference in what

the social worker does?
MR. MINGO:

investigation is any investigation triggered by the
statute, 48

The only way I can answer that

So, you really are drawing the

distinction between a formal report and an informal
investigation.

No matter how much she uncovers, if no

-- there is no resulting formal report, no possible
liability.
MR. MINGO:

That's not the basis of our -- our

— our position is.
QUESTION:

I thought that's just what you've

been arguing.
MR. MINGO:

What I've been attempting to argue

is that a formal report is required to trigger an
investigation.

If she receives a formal report, then

she does have some affirmative duties imposed upon her
by the statute.

The statute says she shall investigate.

please the Court:
I want to address the -- the due process -the deprivation of due process analysis briefly if I
could, but before I do, I'd like to say a few words
about the relationship between federal and state
government and the role of the federal Constitution
because I think it is reasonably clear that the area of
child protection is not one that is crying out for
federal constitutional oversight.
First of all, it is not an area where there is
any sort of history of hostility between the state and
the interests that we're talking about trying to
protect. Quite the contrary.

There being no

constitutional right to this protection in the first
place, it's clear I think that the state programs that
have been set up have all been set up as a matter of
state and local government initiative born of exactly
the same sentiments and concerns that everyone feels
toward children who are exposed to the kinds of abuse
and hazards that we're sadly reviewing in this case.
So, we don't have -- we don't have a -- a

21

22

state actor who there is a need to step in front of and
stop in any sort of habitual way.

Quite the contrary.

23

The state is actively intervening to do all that it
24
25

reasonably can do.

Second of all, I think there's no reason to
think that federal oversight, federal constitutional
oversight, is going to add very much to the handling of
these sensitive and difficult problems.

There is I

think little reason to think that federal courts have
any special expertise in the reviewing of what is at
least in some sense a balance between interests of
parents, respect for the interest of parents in
controlling their children, as opposed to the priority
of intervening when you -- when you need to and must in
order to protect the child.
It's the kind of a sensitive situation that
requires close, on-the-scene involvement, the exercise
of discretion and the exercise of a great deal of care
and concern.

It's an area of -- of traditional state

law involvement and local government handling.

And the

idea that at a federal court review engrafted on top of
what is already in place, machinery that has been put in
place by the state and local governments -- the idea
that that is going to help rather than hurt I think is
-- is really a misguided one.
We're talking about a number of things.

We're

talking about, number one, creating another layer of
judicial action, judicial review, which itself will
result in delay.

It will divert resources from the -51

the real everyday problems and the handling of these
personal situations.
We are talking possibly not only about
awarding damages and creating a -- a chill and a
discouraging factor which Justice O'Connor alluded to
being involved at all, also a day-to-day possible, I
suppose, injunctive role for the federal courts coming
involved not only after the fact when something has
happened to award damages, but becoming involved as
these cases evolve. You go to the local court.
to your local social service agency.

You go

You go to the

local court, and then you go to federal court.
The idea that that is somehow going to help
the resolution of these problems seems to be -- seems to
be misguided, and I think there is a good reason to fear
that it may well just primarily discourage the
involvement of local agencies for fear that they're
going to be facing an unmanageable and very expensive
situation.
All of that is basically irrelevant unless it
is wholly consistent with the law and what the
Constitution requires.

And very briefly I'd like to say

that I think it's quite clear that when you take to
heart the Court's statements that the due process clause
is not to be a font of tort policy which will evolve as

tort policy does in response to various economic and

comes and goes with -- with social concerns and the

to a complaint of a neighbor goes into a house and sees

the beating goes on?

It might

power which is a moving force behind the harm that is
taking place.

Well, it might be possible to write

a statute in a way that created a procedural due process
interest.

I don't know quite how you'd do that, but

you'd have to link -- the words would have to be fairly
mandatory and would have to link rather closely to the
harm that you're talking about now occurring.

And if

that happened, the question would then be about the
adequacy of the remedy that was provided for -- for the
harm when it did in fact occur.

circumstances if he had a duty to act and didn't.

And, of course, the point I guess I was

making earlier in summary is that there is no reason why
we can't rely on the mechanisms of state and local
government to create the remedies that are appropriate
in these circumstances.
QUESTION:

Well, my only purpose of asking the

question is that I --- I take it that -- that you had to
answer that way and -- but also it makes irrelevant how
much the social worker knew.
MR. AYER:

decide -- if we -- if we decide for the state, it -- it
really does mean that it's irrelevant how -- how much
the social worker knew or -MR. AYER:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

state law or anything else.

QUESTION:

-- even though there is a duty to

provide equal protection of the law.
MR. AYER:

That's right.

That's right.

And

-- and I think -- I think the way that one -- what one
would have to do to violate equal protection of the law
is -- is useful in thinking about how to think about a
violation of due process in the sense that there the
denial of equal protection which could, in fact, be
other than an affirmative act or -- or the government
being a moving force behind the harm, nonetheless it
must be intentional.

It must be an act which intends

the result -- the denial of the protection that they
otherwise would be entitled to.

way to decide this case, I would suggest that an intent

QUESTION:

If the state had -- well, let's

assume the state had a lot of knowledge at the time the
child was returned to his father.

Would you consider

that to be enough affirmative state action to -MR. AYER:

Well, I -- I -- I would think not

and the reason would be that the removal in this case
was a temporary removal for specific purposes.

The

father remained the legal custodian of the child.

No

affirmative action had been taken to determine that the
-- the father was unfit and that the expiration of this
temporary period, absent further action, the child was
going to go back to -- to the parent.

And the fact that

it did not take that affirmative action, but rather let
the status quo continue, I think is not the kind of
affirmative action that you've got to have in order to
have the state be the moving force -- its abuse of power
be the moving force behind the injury that occurred.
Thank you very much.
