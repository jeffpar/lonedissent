CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

next in No. 87-826, Goldberg v. Sweet.

5

Mr. Smith, we'll wait just a moment --

MR. SMITH:

All right.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER A. SMITH, JR.

13

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

14

MR. SMITH:

15

it please the Court:

16

You may

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, may

This case involves a State tax on the act or

17

privilege of engaging in interstate phone calls, a form

18

of interstate commerce that by its very nature occurs in

19

more than one State at once, simultaneously, that

20

introduces into two States at once substantial economic

21

activities and involves the delivery of services in two

22

States at once, and in fact can become the subject of a

23

tax in at least two States at once.

24
25

Nevertheless, in this case, Illinois has
levied a tax on the whole of all interstate phone calls
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

that originate or terminate in Illinois and that are

2

charged to an Illinois service address.

3

The question these circumstances raise, we

4

believe, is whether or not this violates the interstate

5

Commerce Clause.

6

violates all three of the elements of this Court's

7

Complete Auto decision.

8
9
10

And in our view it does.

QUESTION:

In fact, it

And what I --

Why -- why is it you say that they

levy it on the whole of the -- of the service?
The initial obstacle I confront is I don't see

11

how this is different from any sales tax, let's say, on

12

a piece of tangible goods that -- that is manufactured

13

in a number of other States.

14

from --from Iowa.

15

and whatnot.

16

to that item that's sold is taxed by the State that

17

imposes a sales tax.

18

that also taxes activities in other States?

19

The raw materials come

The manufacturing is done is Ohio,

Yet, the whole value that has been added

MR. SMITH:

Why can't you say that -- that

No, Your Honor, because the State

20

courts have held already that the tax is, in fact,

21

levied on the entirety of the call.

22

taxable event is the origination or the receipt, but

23

both lower courts have construed the statute to levy the

24

tax on the entirety of the phone call.

25

sales tax, which this Court has often reviewed, where it

It is true that the

And unlike a

5

1

can be isolated in a single taxing jurisdiction, in this

2

particular circumstance, it -- the interstate phone call

3

cannot be isolated in a single taxing jurisdiction

4

because economic activity by definition is occurring in

5

two different States at once.

6

Moreover, unlike a sales tax situation, here

7

the delivery of goods occurs partly outside the State,

8

and by the definition of its own statute whether or not

9

the call is billed for or paid for in Illinois, Illinois

10

nevertheless taxes the call.

11

multiple taxation.

And the result is we risk

In our view, the tax violates all three of the

12
13

Complete Auto requirements for slightly different

14

reasons.

15

three elements are violated, and that is because this

16

tax reaches outside Illinois' borders to tax the whole

17

of the call as both lower courts found when they

18

rejected the proposition that what was being taxed was

19

only in state in commerce.

20

But at bottom, there's one reason why all

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Smith, to get back to

21

Justice Scalia's question, do you think Illinois could

22

have imposed a gross receipts tax on all of the charges

23

charged in Illinois on the call --

24

MR. SMITH:

25

QUESTION:

Well, this --- the totality of the charge?
6

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

MR. SMITH:

1

2

Honor.

If it had been apportioned, Your

This is not -QUESTION:

3

Don't you think under our

4

precedents, under sales tax generally, that a tax

5

imposed by Illinois on the totality of the charge would

6

be upheld?
MR. SMITH:

7

Not whereas here, Your Honor, part

8

of the commerce by definition occurs outside the taxing

9

State.

It is true that in a case like Moorman, the

10

Court upheld a gross receipts tax, but that's because an

11

apportionment formula was used.

12

adopted to measure that part of the commerce that had

13

occurred within the taxing State.

Some methodology was

Here that has not been done.

14

Illinois has

15

elected to tax the entirety of the call even though by

16

definition, a portion of the call necessarily occurs

17

outside the taxing State.
QUESTION:

18

It seems to me that everything you

19

have said so far, if you transfer it to our case in D.

20

H. Holmes that we had last year involving the catalogs,

21

means that we were wrong in reaching the decision we

22

reached in the catalog case.
MR. SMITH:

23
24
25

No, Your Honor, I would say not

because

The transaction takes place in part

out of state.

There is very significant economic

2

activity that's outside the state.

3

sustained a tax based wholly on the sales price in the

4

State of, I believe, Mississippi.
MR. SMITH:

5

And yet, we

No, Your Honor.

The distinction

6

between Holmes and this case is that in Holmes the tax

7

had been apportioned, as the Court pointed out in its

8

opinion.

distribution of the catalogs, and it very carefully had

11

In addition, in --

12

QUESTION:

13

Well, but it -- it was a use tax

based on the value of the catalogs.
MR. SMITH:

14

And the use tax, Your Honor, was

15

levied only upon the in-state distribution of the

16

catalogs.

17

of the State were subject to the use tax.

No catalogs that had been distributed outside

QUESTION:

Well, here no call that's not

billed to Illinois is taxed.
QUESTION:

Mr. -- is -- doesn't the --

Illinois taxes any call that's billed there.

22

MR. SMITH:

23

QUESTION:

Illinois -But it -- but it -- but -- but

24

--and it -- and it taxes it even though it happens to be

25

paid in another State.

3

MR. SMITH:

That's right, Your Honor.

Under

the language -QUESTION:

So, a gross receipts tax would not

4

cover a call that is billed to an Illinois number but

5

sent to Washington and is paid there.

6

MR. SMITH:

Is that right?

Your Honor, the construction of

7

this statute is that the tax is levied only upon calls

8

that are charged to an Illinois service address --

9
10
11

QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

But it may not --- irrespective of -- right

--irrespective of where it's --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SMITH:

Of where it's paid.
-- of where it's paid for or where

14

it's billed, which means that another state could also

15

tax the same interstate phone call.

16

For example, Illinois elects to tax the

17

origination of a call, on the whole of the call, because

18

it happens to be charged to an Illinois service address.

19

But another State may choose to tax the termination of

20

the call because it's billed and paid for in that State.

21

22
23

QUESTION:

Has any State, in fact, done that

in this case?
MR. SMITH:

The Washington State tax, as it

24

reads, Your Honor, suggests that any call that

25

originates or terminates in Washington and is billed and
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

paid there will, in fact, be taxed by the State of

2

Washington.

3

QUESTION:

4

to some taxpayer in Illinois?
MR. SMITH:

5

Has that -- has that been applied

We're unaware that any particular

6

taxpayer in Illinois has had that tax applied to him,

7

Your Honor, but under this Court's Armco and Container

8

Corporation and Scheiner decisions, it is not our burden

9

to prove that the tax is actually being imposed on an

10

Illinois taxpayer today because, as the Court pointed

11

out, to have such a rule would require the Court to be

12

monitoring what all the other States are doing.
And I might add that today the State's taxing

13
14

of interstate telecommunications is in a state of flux

15

and changing.
QUESTION:

16

Well, certainly the States are

17

going to be entitled to tax this sort of activity in

18

some way. I mean, there isn't any doubt about that, is

19

there?

20

MR. SMITH:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

No doubt about that.

No doubt.

And so, why isn't the Illinois way

a relatively reasonable way to approach it?
MR. SMITH:

Well because, Your Honor, it

24

violates three of the important Complete Auto

25

requirements.
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

QUESTION:

1

2

Don't forget that Illinois would

allow the credit for the Washington tax.
MR. SMITH:

3

Well, that isn't altogether clear,

4

Your Honor, how the credit provision would work.

5

let me just address that because that's one of the major

6

arguments that the State is making here, that even

7

though we have a completely unapportioned tax, that the

8

credit provision that's in the statute will be effective

9

to set it right and cure it.
In our view it will not.

10

And

Indeed, in our view

11

this Court has never approved a credit provision on the

12

ground that it will say they wholly unapportioned the

13

tax.

14

that was not the case because the tax was already

15

apportioned when the credit provision was looked to.

16
17
18

And in the Holmes case mentioned by Your Honor,

QUESTION:

Well, why shouldn't we approve it

now if it accomplishes the same result as apportionment?
MR. SMITH:

Well, in our view, Your Honor, it

19

couldn't accomplish apportionment for two reasons.

One

20

is that it would do so only fortuitously.

21

credit provision on a wholly unapportioned tax and hope

22

that the States and the participants -- interstate

23

commerce will be able to sort it out, there's no

24

guarantee that the sorting out will ever occur.

25

certainly it will not under this credit provision, and

To tack on a

11
ALDERSOIM REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

And

1

let me explain why that's true.
In our view there are approximately -- in

2
3

fact, not approximately -- there are only three

4

circumstances that could occur under this credit

5

provision.

6

call.

7

other end of the call.

8

will, at the other end of the call, will attempt to tax

9

the Illinois taxpayer.

One is that no other State will tax the

Another is that the other State will tax the
And the third is that the State

In our view, though, in none of

10

these circumstances will fair apportionment be brought

11

about, and let me explain why that's true.
If no other State taxes the call, fair

12
13

apportionment will not be brought about.

14

still have taken more than its fair share of the

15

commerce.

16

and preempted the choice of the State at the other end

17

of the call not to tax the interstate commerce.

18

Illinois will

And at the same time, it will have subverted

The second possibility is that the State at

19

the other end of the call will tax its own taxpayer.

20

But by the terms of this statute, its credit provision,

21

no credit will be permitted in that circumstance because

22

this credit provision grants a credit only where

23

Illinois' own taxpayer is taxed twice.

24
25

So, those are the two -- two of the
circumstances, and in neither of those will fair
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

apportionment be brought about.
Now, the third circumstance is where the other

2
3

State attempts to tax the Illinois taxpayer.

4

view, even in that circumstance, fair apportionment will

5

still not be brought about, and there are two reasons

6

for that.

7

But in our

First of all, the credit provision by its own

8

terms grants a credit to the Illinois taxpayer only

9

where the other State taxes the same event that Illinois

10

has already taxed.

But by the terms of the statute, as

11

construed by the lower court, the event that is taxed is

12

the origination or termination of the call that is

13

charged to an Illinois service address.

14

other state taxes termination where a call is billed or

15

paid, while Illinois has taxed origination where the

16

call is charged, two different events will be taxed and

17

no credit will be permitted.

18

Furthermore --

19

QUESTION:

So that if the

Mr. Smith, I -- I don't understand

20

the whole need for apportionment.

We've required

21

apportionment where -- where what you're taxing is the

22

net income of a -- of a unitary business because there

23

if you -- if -- there's only 100 percent of the net

24

income, and if you allow every -- every State to assume

25

a different percentage attributable to that State, you
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

end up taxing more than the whole.

2

that we've required apportionment where what is being

3

taxed is not a -- a single event, but two separate

4

events.

5

But I'm not aware

For example, we allow one State to impose a

6

sales tax and another State to impose a use tax.

7

don't -- we don't -- they're taxing two separate things.

8

One is taxing the sale; the other is taxing the use.

9

And there's no constitutional requirement that -- that

10

one give a credit for the other.

11

that there's no such requirement.

12
13

MR. SMITH:

We

We've explicitly said

That may be true for the sale-use

tax situation, Your Honor.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SMITH:

Why is that different from this?
But here what we have is a -- what

16

you've just called a unitary event.

We have an -- a tax

17

being laid on the act or privilege of participating in

18

an interstate phone call.

19

two different States can tax that event.

20

is true, this Court's decisions require that the tax be

21

apportioned so that each State tax that part of the

22

event that's occurring within in its borders because

23

otherwise, if each State says we will tax 100 percent,

24

the result will be -- and I think this is the basis of

25

the apportionment requirement -- multiple taxation on

There is simply no doubt that
And since that

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

interstate commerce.
QUESTION:

2

Why do we have to regard it that

3

way?

Why can't we regard the tax as a tax on the

4

placing or receiving of a phone call in -- in Illinois,

5

and another State can place a tax on the -- on the

6

placing or receiving of a phone call in that State?
MR. SMITH:

7

Well, you could, Your Honor, but

8

if each tax said -- if each State says we will tax the

9

placing of the call in our State, and then taxes the

10

entirety of the call -QUESTION:

11
12

Right?

That's how they measure the tax.

Right?
MR. SMITH:

13

-- as the measure of the tax -- as

14

the measure of the tax, it is inevitable that the call

15

will be taxed at least twice, and if there's a third

16

State participating, could be taxed all over again -QUESTION:

17

Just as in the sales and use tax

18

situation.

19

it's sold and another time when it's used.

20

You tax the value of the thing once when

MR. SMITH:

So what?

That is right, Your Honor, and in

21

each case the Court held that only one jurisdiction

22

could levy the sales or the use tax.

23

QUESTION:

And -- and here only one

24

jurisdiction is taxing the receipt, and only one

25

jurisdiction will be taxing the placement.
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

MR. SMITH:

1

True.

True, Your Honor, but it's

2

measuring the tax by the entirety of the call, including

3

the portion of the call that does not occur within the

4

taxing State's borders which -- let me just add -- which

5

is not the case in a sales-use tax situation.

6

Court has always held that sales taxes are permitted as

7

an unapportioned tax only where only one jurisdiction

8

could tax the sale.

9

that use tax because only one jurisdiction could have

This

And in Holmes, the Court upheld

10

taxed the unapportioned -- the apportioned amount of the

11

use occurring within Louisiana.
QUESTION:

12
13

Mr. Smith, may -- may I interrupt

you and ask you a question?

14

MR. SMITH:

15

QUESTION:

Sure.
Supposing Illinois charges 5

16

percent on calls within the State of Illinois, and then

17

it charged 2 and a half percent on all calls going

18

across the State line.

19

apply to every call received whether or not billed

20

within the State and every call originating within the

21

State.

22
23
24
25

The 2 and a half percent would

Would that be constitutional in your view?
MR. SMITH:

That would come, in our view, a

lot closer to a constitutional -QUESTION:

Many of your arguments would apply

to that situation too because the 2 and half percent
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

would be on the entire transaction.
MR. SMITH:

2

But it would be apportioned.

The

3

result, Your Honor, would not be that, in fact, Illinois

4

was taxing commerce outside its borders.

5

apportionment would have been a way to measure that part

6

of the commerce you've just described that's occurring

7

only within Illinois' borders.

8

be taxing outside its borders -QUESTION:

9
10

The

Illinois would still not

Let me be sure I -- is your view

that that tax would be permissible or not?
MR. SMITH:

11

Two and a half percent on all

12

interstate phone calls and 5 percent on intrastate phone

13

calls -- if, Your Honor, the apportionment formulas of

14

the kind we have suggested may be permissible in our

15

brief --

16

QUESTION:

Because the reason I ask is that

17

your opponent argues this is the functional equivalent

18

of that tax because although it's 100 percent taxed,

19

they really only tax half the calls because they tax

20

those that are billed in Illinois and those that are not

21

billed in Illinois are just not taxed at all.

22

what's the difference between 50 percent of 100 percent

23

of the calls and 100 percent of 50 percent?

24
25

MR. SMITH:
chose to do.

So,

Because that isn't what the State

Illinois -- the Illinois legislature did
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

not decide to tax all calls within its borders, as your

2

hypothetical just put it.

3

percent of certain calls, those calls that were charged

4

to an Illinois service address.

5

decided to use the apportionment formula you just

6

described.

7

QUESTION:

It decided only to tax 100

The legislature never

No, but if they could demonstrate

8

-- I don't know whether they could or not -- that this

9

resulted in a functional equivalent because the same

10

number of tax dollars would be collected, what's wrong

11

with it in terms of burdening interstate commerce?

12

MR. SMITH:

Because, as I think the Scheiner

do that.

Now, explain to me why they didn't do that.
MR. SMITH:

I would say on the face of the

3

statute, Section 4 of this Act, the Illinois legislature

4

determined to tax only one set of interstate commerce,

5

calls that were charged to an Illinois service address,

6

and by the statute it decided to exempt from taxation

7

altogether the other kinds of calls you're describing.

8

I'm saying that was a judgment the Illinois legislature

9

was entitled to make.

10

If it had wanted to do what you have just

11

said, it would have passed a statute saying we tax all

12

calls that originate and terminate in Illinois

13

irrespective of whether they are charged to an Illinois

14

service address, and we will apportion the tax by

15

levying 100 percent on some calls and zero on others.

16

But that is not the statute the Illinois legislature

17

passed, Your Honor.

18

And further, even if it had, I would submit to

19

you that the fact that the right amount of revenues that

20

are received by the State of Illinois doesn't begin to

21

offer any assurance that individual taxpayers will be

fairly treated.

In our tax cases, we've talked

about a rough approximation being sufficient.
MR. SMITH:

And we agree a rough approximation

would be sufficient, Your Honor, but we would submit

11

that using a service address as a proxy for measuring

12

what part of economic activity occurred in the State is

arbitrary.

14

It is not a rough approximation.
QUESTION:

I -- I don't even think we require

points out, that fair apportionment can be a rough

approximation.

And it's true, as the Chief Justice

But at the very least in drawing a fair

apportionment formula, albeit a rough approximation, the

8

Court has always required that whatever formula is used,

both on its face and in practice, can be expected to

measure the part of interstate commerce that occurs

11

within the taxing State's borders.

12

And this apportionment formula -- and I still

beg to differ, Justice Stevens -- a formula not adopted

14

by the State of Illinois, but even if it had, there is

15

nothing to suggest that it will in practice effect an

apportionment both for the reason Justice Stevens says

17

that you can't -- I think you cannot assume without some

data base to suppose it -- that each caller within

Illinois is going to have half of his calls charged to

his serve address -- service address and the other half

not.

hearing my adversary's argument, I think the Court does,

First of all, I think it's important that the

2

there may be a nexus problem.
Now, the classical situations where

3
4

apportionment has been required are, for example, in the

5

case of a net income tax on the operations of a unitary

10

which the tax is being applied -- is activity occurring

the taxing State gets only its fair share, and normally

That pie has to be sliced so that

that the legislature didn't make clear what it was doing

because I think Justice Stevens is completely right.

21

The statute does what it does, and what it does is to

22

slice the pie by taxing calls charged to an Illinois

number and not taxing calls charged to a non-Illinois

number.

And the way Illinois has sliced this

Now, I don't know whether you call this

1

apportionment or you don't call it apportionment.

But

2

what you do call it is something that fully satisfies

3

the Commerce Clause purpose of apportionment.

4

seems to me that there is that fundamental fallacy.

5

Now, let me come back to a point that was

6

involved in Justice Scalia's first question because

7

there are sort of two different ways you can look at

8

this tax.

So, it

We argue that, first of all, you can look at

9
10

it as being like a sales tax on the purchase of an

11

interstate telephone service in Illinois or like a gross

12

receipts tax on the revenues from interstate carriers

13

doing business in Illinois.

14

Now, I am told, of course, that that is not

15

what this tax is because the Illinois court said it's

16

actually a tax on the interstate phone call.

17

Court has made crystal clear in numerous cases that if

18

the tax is exactly equal in its operation to some other

19

kind of clearly lawful tax -- and that's exactly what

20

was involved in Moorman -- it will be upheld; that is,

21

you will look at the economic substance of the tax.

But this

Now, what is the economic substance of this

22
23

tax?

The substance is that the Illinois purchaser who

24

purchases a phone call pays a tax of 5 percent of the

25

cost of that purchase charged to his Illinois service

that existed before Complete Auto.

6

substance it is something that happens -- what is being

7

taxed is exactly like a sales tax.

to

In economic

It is also exactly like a gross receipts tax;

8
9

It sounds a lot like a sales tax for me

that is, the amount of tax that Illinois collects is

10

exactly the same as if Illinois said we will tax

11

interstate carriers on their gross receipts from

12

interstate phone calls and we will measure that tax by

13

the unapportioned gross receipts that they receive in

14

Illinois.

15

Unapportioned gross receipts taxes have been

16

repeatedly upheld by this Court.

They were upheld in

17

Standard Pressed Steel.

18

Tyler Pipe two years ago said they were good.

19

that in Moorman, Justice Brennan in his dissent

20

questioned the propriety of unapportioned gross receipts

of the pie, which I hope to demonstrate momentarily does

interstate sales, they're perfectly all right in the

2

telephone context.

3

Now, the Appellants have argued that a gross

4

receipts tax is different from a tax on the phone call

5

because the incidence of this tax falls on the retail

6

customer rather than on the carrier.

7

substance, I think it's generally recognized and I think

8

it's obvious that a gross receipts tax has the same

9

economic effect as a sales tax.

But in economic

It's different in form,

10

but not in substance.

11

because the cost to the purchaser of purchasing the

12

taxed service will be

thesame.

will not be separately stated, but

14

it will obviously be incorporated in the price of the

15

good or service that is sold.

It has the same economic effect

In the case of a

Now, even if you view it as a tax on the

17

interstate phone call themselves, which we agree one or

18

more States -- other States would have nexus to tax

depending on where the other parties, the non-Illinois

20

parties are located -- the Illinois scheme fully

satisfies apportionment objectives.

22

I would agree that in

the absence of a credit, if

Illinois tried to tax

100 percent of all calls to which

I think the Court should appreciate how
inconsistent the Appellants' arguments are because they

10

start off by saying you can't treat this like a sales

11

tax; that is, you can't look only at the transactions

12

that are sold in Illinois because the Illinois Supreme

13

Court said it's a tax on the interstate phone calls, not

14

a tax on the sales.

then what's wrong with treating this as a sales tax.

2

They have really tried to pull a little shell game on

3

the Court I believe.

4

Now --

5

QUESTION:

Before you leave that, Mr. Frey,

6

they -- they -- as I understand your opponent, he said,

7

well, but in order to take that position, you have to

8

mix up your taxpayers and lump them all together in a

9

way that Scheiner prohibits.
MR. FREY:

10

11

I'm -- Scheiner is one of my very

favorite cases.

12

QUESTION:

Well, I would think it would be.

13

MR. FREY:

But I can't say that I'm -- that I

14

understand what it is that he is referring to in

15

Scheiner.

16

In Scheiner, the problem was that the

17

structure of the tax inherently and in empirical

18

experience as well discriminated by causing the

19

out-of-state business to pay more tax -- and remember,

20

Scheiner was a use tax for the use of the State's roads

21

-- than the in-state operator had to pay.

22

I'll note parenthetically that the objection

23

in this tax is -- and this is a little -- perhaps a

24

little bit complicated to understand, but the objection

25

is that the Illinois caller

is being discriminated

It's the Illinois caller who's paying the tax

on the full call.

3

4

getting the benefit of the fact that Illinois is not

5

trying to tax that call.

The person in Nevada who makes a call

So, this is a rather odd Commerce Clause claim

6
7

because the in-state people are the victims of this

8

discrimination and the out-of-state people are the

9

beneficiaries of this discrimination.

10

I'm not sure that

the Commerce Clause reaches that situation.

argument is that the -- is that it doesn't make any

that Illinois has for it.

telephone caller.

one thing clear, was that the relationship didn't have

the taxpayer.
Now, what is a better way to measure the

3

in-state activity of making an interstate phone call

5

than the value -- than the price that the taxpayer is

willing to pay for the phone call?

7

that is a completely fair way and that the Court should

not measure the tax that a State can impose on a

You're saying it's the same price

Right.

21

QUESTION:

So, every sales tax has that effect.

22

MR. FREY:

Yes.

I mean, as we said in our

23

brief I believe, if -- if -- if there are two cars

24

manufactured in Michigan and brought into Illinois to

25

the same showroom and sold, and one is a Cadillac and

3

thing with respect to both of those cars.

unquestioned that it can tax twice as much for the more

5

expensive one.

Yet, it's

6

I don't -- I would rather -- although if there

7

are more questions about fair relation, I'll be happy to

8

talk about them, but I think the main thrust of the

9

Appellants' argument is in the apportionment area.

I

10

think there's a fundamental point about apportionment,

11

and the Court made this point in the Container Corp.

case quite clearly.
There are two requirements to satisfy yourself

that the State is getting a fair share of the total

17

requirement that you determine by looking at the

18

structure of the tax, and what you ask yourself is

19

whether -- if this formula were applied by every

20

jurisdiction, would it result in more than all of the

21

interstate transactions being taxed.

22

clear that the Illinois tax passes internal

The first is what's known as internal

It is crystal

The only argument I've seen to suggest
otherwise is GTE's argument that if other States had

5

purpose of the internal consistency inquiry.

6

But, of course, that would make no tax pass
That is, it totally defeats the

Now, the internal consistency inquiry is very

7

important because it means that the tax looked at on its

8

own terms does not carry with it any inherent risk of

9

multiple taxation of interstate transactions.

10
11

Scheiner,

of course, was totally different in that regard.
Now, there is a second requirement, and that

12

has been called external consistency.

13

consistency means -- and I'm quoting from Container

14

Corp. where it was called the more difficult requirement

15

-- is that "the factor or factors used in the

16

apportionment formula must actually reflect a reasonable

17

sense of how income is generated."

18

look at the way the pie has been sliced, you must ask

19

yourself whether the State has taken a slice that

20

reasonably reflects the in-state component of the

21

interstate activity being taxed.

22

And what external

That is, when you

But the Court is very hands-off in applying

23

external consistency; that is, the Court has made clear

24

that what you need is a method of allocation or

25

attribution to the State that is -- and I quote -- "out

that from common sense it's probably generally going to

be the case.

5

Well, first of all, I think we know

But in any event, what is clear is that this

6

factual question -- this is a question about whether

7

external consistency is satisfied, not internal

8

consistency.

9

unequivocally the Appellant has the burden of proof.

And in Container Corp., the Court said

10

And there is not one iota of evidence in the record in

11

this case -- there's no attempt to prove that the tax

12

doesn't pass internal consistency.

13

attempt to force the Court to take this narrow focus and

look only at the calls that are actually taxed, but at

15

the same time not treat it as a sales tax or a gross

There is only an

Now, let me turn to something else because the

18

Scheiner case I think is quite helpful to us in a number

19

of respects, and one of the respects in which it's

20

helpful is that it recognizes that where it is

21

administratively difficult or impossible to tax a

22

transaction appropriately by a non-discriminatory tax,

23

maybe a discriminatory tax would be permissible.

24

don't for a minute agree that this is in the least a

discriminatory tax, but any scheme of call-by-call

Now, let

If you're going to apportion an individual

call, you can apportion it, it seems to me, either

6

--let's take, first, the possibility that you look on

7

the basis of mileage, which has been suggested in their

8

briefs, and each State gets to tax the share that

9

represents the miles through that State that a

10
11

straight-line signal between the two points would pass.
I think it's clear from MCI's brief and from

12

what anybody knows about the telephone business, that

13

this is impossible.

14

There is no way to determine which intervening States

15

are involved.

16

would have nexus simply because the signal passed

17

through its borders or even touched a microwave relay

18

tower that's within its borders, which the State ought

19

to tax through a property tax it seems to me.

20

There is no record of the signals.

I question whether an intervening State

But even if you could determine this, it would

21

be a nightmare to administer on a call-by-call basis

22

that kind of apportionment.

23

Appellants have essentially receded from the suggestion

24

that that should be done.

25

And I -- and I think the

Now, there is a second possibility which is
44
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

that you can impose -- and this is the -- the only thing

2

that they have alleged they have the technological

3

capacity to do.

4

in California, they have suggested that when they send

5

me the bill, they -- they have the capacity to tax half

6

of that call -- to impose the Illinois tax on half of

7

that call, the California tax on half of that call.

8

they would -- I'm in Illinois.

9

the California tax and the Illinois tax.

If I'm in Illinois and I call someone

They have the

10

technological capacity to do that, but I have two

11

observations.

So,

First of all, that's unconstitutional unless

13

you're going to overrule National Bellas Hess.

14

I do not have nexus with California.

15

tax me simply because I make a phone call from outside

16

California into California.

17

I conduct a mail order business with extensive

18

advertising and so on as long as I don't have a physical

19

presence in California.

20

That is,

California cannot

Indeed, it can't tax me if

And the second observation is to what end are

21

we going through this exercise when it is essentially

22

going to end up in the State's getting the same amount

23

of tax dollars and the generality of taxpayers paying

24

the same amount of tax dollars.

25

And I might mention that neither Mr. Goldberg

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

nor Mr. McTigue has suggested that they have paid a

penny more in tax than they would pay under any one of

3

their apportionment schemes except --

4

QUESTION:

Assuming what you have just said is

5

true, assuming everybody adopts the same scheme, right,

6

as Illinois?

7

Is -- is that -- is that a likelihood?

MR. FREY:

No, I don't -- I don't care -- let

8

me -- let me get to that because that is a point that

9

has come up several times.

10

First of all, essentially nobody has

11

inconsistent schemes.

12

that was mentioned in the Illinois Supreme Court is

13

itself not internally consistent and, therefore,

14

probably unconstitutional.

16

unconstitutional.

17

This Wheat Ridge, Colorado scheme

And certainly the Illinois

But beyond that, let's postulate the situation

18

in which a State takes into its head for some reason to

19

tax the party who -- who doesn't pay for the call.

20

California says we're going to tax the party who

21

doesn't. If somebody in California doesn't pay for the

22

call, we'll tax them.

23

that is administratively impossible because there's no

24

way of identifying who such a person is.

25

So,

I wanted to make the point that

Even if -- even if that were possible and
46
ALDERSOIM REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

California did it, the result would be that -- that it

2

would be an advantage -- an advantage -- to interstate

3

commerce, not a disadvantage because if the call was

4

billed in California, nobody would pay any tax.

5

would be zero.

6

tax would be on 200 percent.

7

so that the generality of taxpayers would be paying a

8

tax on 100 percent.

9

commerce -- if I am calling my branch office in

The tax

If the call was billed in Illinois, the
That would still even out

But people who are in interstate

10

California, I have the choice to charge the call in a

11

way that reduces my tax down to zero in that situation.

12

So, I don't see how the Commerce Clause can be

13

violated when these various schemes actually provide an

14

advantage to interstate callers who -- who would want to

15

arrange their affairs to avoid the tax and for the

16

generality a caller would wash out in the end.

17

Now -- now, suppose some person came along and

18

said, you know, the only long distance calls I make are

19

to my grandchildren and I charge them all to my phone

20

and the result is that I'm paying more than my fair

21

share of tax.

22

that, and I know my time is running out.

23

I want to remind the Court of something that it said in

24

Moorman. And maybe this is back on this -- on this

25

question of different tax schemes producing multiple

I guess I have several observations about

In footnote 12 in Moorman, the Court was

2
3

concerned with whether the Iowa scheme created multiple

4

tax burdens when it was juxtaposed with the Illinois

5

scheme.

6

whatever disparity may have existed by these

7

inconsistent statutes is not attributable to the Iowa

8

statute which treats both local and foreign concerns

9

with even hand. The disparity can only be the

And the Court said the simple answer is that

consequence of the combined effect of the Iowa and

12

latter.

simply a way of describing the potential consequences of

14

the use of different formulas by two States.

Secondly, there's no showing that anybody has

if that should happen, if he should be so foolish as to

So, I think the risk of multiple tax

Let -- let me close with -- with an example on

the discrimination point.

11

and you charged a dollar when you got on the bridge.

20

Now, if I understand the burden of my

21

opponent's argument, it is that that system is unfair

22

and discriminatory against interstate commerce, that you

23

must apportion the toll that is paid on the trip between
