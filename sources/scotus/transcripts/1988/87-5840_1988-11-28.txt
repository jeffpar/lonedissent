MR* SUTHERLANDS

10
11

you

Mr* Chief Justice* and may it

please the Court*
This case

12

Is a case

involving the complete and

13

irrevocable

termination of an unwed father's parental

14

rights to associate with his natural child as contrasted

15

to a custody or

even a visitation dispute which would be

16

the province of

the state domestic relations courts and

17

would have to be handled there If Mr* McNamara prevails*
This appeal

18

presents equal protection claims

19

by the father who was deprived of that most precious of

20

fundamental rights* the right

21
