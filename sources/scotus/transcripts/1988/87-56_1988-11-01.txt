This suit was filed 22

Petitioners moved to dismiss on the

grounds of the statute of limitations contending that a
one-year statute of limitations should have been
applied.

Both the District Court and the Second Circuit

rejected our position.

The case came up here presumably

because of the conflict with the Eleventh, Sixth and
Fifth Circuits.
I might mention that prior to the time that he
filed this suit, Respondent had sought recovery from -in the New York Court of Claims based on a 1983 action
against the State, but that was dismissed because 1983

In -- in Wilson, this Court decided that a

12

single statute of limitations should be borrowed under

13

Section 1988 for each state for purposes of 1983 cases,

14

and that the proper choice would be a personal injury

15

statute of limitations of general applicability.

22

Wilson involved the State of New Mexico which
has only one such personal injury statute of
limitations. Now, in the course of its decision in
Wilson, the Court rejected two other possible statute of
limitations.
One was the one relating to remedies for
wrongs committed by public officials and that was viewed

23

as inconsistent with the purposes of 1983 since one of

24

the very purposes of the Act was that the state remedies

25

were insufficient.

And the other statute of limitations
considered were for suits arising under statutory
claims.

But the Court pointed out that back in 1871

when 19 -- Section 1983 was enacted as Section 1 of the
Ku Klux Klan Act, that there were few such claims, such
statutory claims.
The difficulty has arisen since Wilson because
more than half the states, including New York, have more
than one personal injury statute of limitations that are
generally applicable.

And it is our position that the

statute of limitations, consistent with Wilson, should
be used as the one applies to intentional personal
torts, at least particularly those that encompass
assault, battery and false imprisonment.
Now, the reason we make this argument is that,
as the Court explained in Wilson, the very catalyst of
the Ku Klux Klan Act was the campaign of violence and
deception in the South that had been fomented by the
Klan which was denying decent citizens their political
and civil rights.

Now, that was being accomplished by

the Klan through acts of violence, whippings, shootings,
murders and so forth.
And it is for this reason that three of the
circuits, initially Judge Johnson in the Eleventh
Circuit, concluded that the logic was that therefore the

personal injury statute of limitations which dealt with

those subject matters was the most appropriate to be

borrowed.

Now, our opponents suggest in their brief that
the -- Section 1 of the Klan Act was not directed
against violations by the clansmen themselves, but
rather against -- suits against the local and state
officials who were not coping with the reign of terror
being perpetrated by the Klan.
That argument assumes that everyone sued under
1983 must be a state official.

That simply isn't true

under the decisions of this Court.

To be sure, there is

a need that the action be under color of law.

But this

Court's decisions in Annex v. Cress, 1970; Dennis v.
Sparks, 1980, have made it clear that it is enough that
the defendant be a willful participant in joint action
with the state or its agents.
Private persons jointly engaged with state
officials in a challenged action are, indeed, acting
under color of law for Section 1983 purposes.

And this

would be true, as the Court explained in the Dennis
case, even if the state actor who provides the basis for
the action himself or herself might be immune from suit
such as a judge, prosecutor, law enforcement officials.
Now, this Court recognized in Annex that state

1

involvement might result from the police intentionally

2

tolerating violence directed at those seeking to assert

3

6

their civil rights.

And that's exactly the kind of

situation that we think Congress did envision in 1871
when it enacted the Ku Klux Klan Act.

The Klan was then

viewed by the Republican supporters of the Act as a

7

group designed to aid the Democratic Party and to deter

8

the supporters of that party, both black and white, from

9

voting.

And the -- excuse me -- there are references
in the debates, which have been discussed by this Court
on numerous occasions, to persist in discriminatory
refusals, to enforce the laws by state officials in some
parts of the postbellum South.

This showed a belief

that the Klan was acting with the deliberate acceptance
of local law enforcement officials.
Indeed, the Congressional Record -Congressional Globe showed the belief that the Klan was
acting in collusion.

There were signals passed between

members of the Klan and law enforcement officials with
people in the jury box and so forth.
So, we believe that there is every reason to
believe that Section 1 of the Klan Act, Section 1983,
certainly viewed by the Congress in 1871 as one tool to
be used to permit suits with respect to the violent acts

of the Klan members themselves.
QUESTION:

2
3

What does that have to do with the

present time?
MR. SCHIFF:

4

Well, we think that the analysis

5

of this Court in Wilson was in large measure a historic

6

analysis not totally, but in large measure a historic

7

analysis as which would be the most appropriate statute

8

to use.

9

intentional torts.

The 1983 actions essentially are all or mostly
Now, they're not all violent torts,

10

but they certainly mostly involve intention.

There are

11

still some open questions as to whether wanton

12

misconduct or perhaps a high level of negligence -- and

13

certainly simple negligence is not sufficient for a 1983

14

cause of action.

15

So, we think that the historical context shows

16

a -- the reason why where there's more than one personal

17

injury statute of limitations in the state, that the

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

state -- that the one that should be chosen is the one
that does relate to the kind of acts that were being
considered back in 1871.
We -- Respondents argue in their brief that
our position would result in further litigation because
of alleged difficulties in choosing among intentional
tort statutes in states where there is more than one
such statute.
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

We think that the contention -- the assertion

1

2

of confusion is really not well-founded.

3

own Appendix A to their brief, which lays out the

4

various statutes of limitations, shows that in general

5

where there is more than one, the reason for being more

6
7

than one is that there's a separate statute of
limitations, usually shorter, for libel and slander.
Now, it's pretty clear that this history I've

8
9

Indeed, their

just recounted simply doesn't provide a basis for

10

picking libel and slander statutes.

It's the ones that

11

involve the more assault directed torts.

12

The — I'd also point out that looking at the

13

New York statute of limitations, which is not atypical,

14

that if you choose a statute for which they contend, the

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

one that essentially applies to all personal injury
statute -- has a -- all personal injuries other than
those listed in other statutes, which includes a series
of other provisions.

There's a separate one for

malpractice and then the intentional tort and some other
ones.
But the bulk of those actions brought under
that statute of limitations would relate to negligence
actions, product liability cases, the very types of
cases that this Court has indicated simply would not
give rise to a 1983 cause of action.

It would be really

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

2

quite anomalous to pick the negligence statute.
Respondents also make an argument historically

3

that the division that we have made is allegedly

4

inconsistent with the way statutes of limitations

5

reviewed at that time, referring to a text of Professor

6

Prosser, among others -- we think that their discussion

7

there between direct and indirect force kind of torts,

8

while interesting historically, wasn't even valid by

9
10
11
12

1871 as Prosser's text itself shows.
And, indeed, if one looks at Appendix B in
their brief, it will appear that the kind of dichotomy
between assault, battery, false imprisonment, malicious

13

prosecution and so forth and other kind of personal

14

injuries, the kind that is -- exists in today's statute,

15

was pretty much true at that time.

16

The Second Circuit seemed to -- seemed to hold

17

and our Respondents argue that a one-year statute of

18

limitations is inconsistent with federal law.

19

think there's absolutely no merit to this.

Now, we

20

This Court, as far as I can read the cases,

21

has never decided inconsistency of a state statute of

22

limitations solely on the basis of the length of time.

23

It has looked -- as in the Burnett v. Grattan case, it

24
25

has rejected a state statute of limitations on a
functional basis.

There that related to administrative

1

discrimination proceedings, and the Maryland statute is

2

not directed to general litigation.

3

rejected.

4

So, that was

However, it is of interest that three of the

5

Justices of this Court in Burnett in a concurring

6

opinion pointed to the one-year statute of limitations

7

that relates to Section 1986, which was Section 7 of the

8

Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which does include a one-year

9

statute of limitations.

10

And the concurring opinion noted that one year

11

would certainly be appropriate for 1983 actions.

12

think that is surely true since the kind of proceedings

13

are not that different.

14

to be obtained in the great bulk of the cases is not

15

materially different.

16
17
18
19

20
21

22

24
25

And we

The type of evidence that needs

We also think it's important that there -- a
one-year statute of limitations has been recognized as
being appropriate in many 1983 cases.

And, of course,

four jurisdictions, including California, apply a
one-year statute of limitations to personal injuries
generally so that any determination that one year was
somehow inconsistent would pose serious problems as to
the applicability of Wilson to those -- those states.
QUESTION:

Mr. -- Mr. Schiff, it may work well

in New York where it's easy enough, as you say, although
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

I guess there's some contest on the point, to pick out

2

what is the -- the intentional tort statute.

3

don't know how such a line would -- would play in -- in

4

other states where you may have a general personal

5

injury statute, but then one statute for a few personal

6

torts, another statute for a few others, another statute

7

for still a few others.

8
9

But I

This isn't the kind of an issue I'm anxious to
have a lot of litigation about.

Why shouldn't we have a

10

-- a clear line?

11

personal injury statute is a -- is a clearer line than

12

what you're urging upon us, maybe not clearer in -- any

13

clearer in New York State, but we're talking about all

14

the courts having to apply this in 50 states and with

15

changing statutes in 50 states over the years.

16
17
18
19

20
21

And it seems to me the general

MR. SCHIFF:

Well, our position is that the --

the line that should be chosen is -- is not solely to
try to determine whether a statute applies to all
intentional torts.

Our position is that the one that

should be chosen in a state -- and I think it's not too
difficult if when you do examine this appendix -- is the

22

one that encompasses assault, battery and false

23

imprisonment. Now, that -- that -- there is one that

24
25

includes that plus others in at least 24 of the
jurisdictions.
12

But Alabama is a

I -- I think the debate below as to whether

7

Look at Alabama.

New York statute was general or — or not general is
somewhat misconceived and -- because however you look at

9

it, the New York statute admittedly covers the -- the

10

important personal intentional torts in -- in view of

11

the history of the Klan Act.

12

I'm not sure that I would agree either that --

simple solution if you decide to pick so-called general

13
14
15
16

pointed out in her dissent in Wilson that the Tenth
Circuit -- again, the case arising from Colorado -- I
don't quite remember the name -- Mishmash or something
like that.

19

20
21

22

The Court did not choose either personal

injury statute, but chose one that applied residually.
And as I say, one of the difficulties with

17
18

I believe Justice O'Connor

applying a -- the general personal injury statute that
you would be picking a statute that essentially is
covering torts that would not possibly give rise to 1983
actions.
And we don't have good statistics, but there

23

are statistics listed in the appendix to the District

24

Court opinion in the Hobson case in the District of

25

Columbia, which is cited in our -- in Respondent's
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

brief. And if you look at the actual statistics that

2

Judge Oberdorfer had developed in the District of

3

Columbia, I suggest that it shows -- that there isn't a

4

great deal left of the suits although it's not entirely

5

easy to tell if you carve out the negligence and product

6

liability cases.
I'd like to turn to the issue of whether the

7

8
9

decision here should be applied prospectively only.

It

is our position that since this Court would be making a

10

new decision as to the appropriate statute of

11

limitations to be chosen, that the principle described

12

by this Court in Stovall v. Denno in 388 U.S. should

13

apply, and that since this Court only decides concrete

14

cases, it would have to apply the decision here to this

15

case because otherwise there would be no case.
The last term there were two cases involving

16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

the statute of limitations under Section 1981.

Those

decisions are perfectly consistent with our position
here.

In Goodman v. Lukens Steel, the statute of

limitations was applied retroactively, but not
necessarily on this analysis.

However, the reason in

that case at least or the facts in that case show that
the statute of limitations would not have been fully
dispositive of the case, but it simply determined the
length of time for which damages would be awarded.
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

There was also injunctive relief so that there was a

2

concrete case regardless of what the decision was in the

3

stature of limitations.
The other case is St. Francis College.

4
5

6
7

8
9
10
11
12
13
14

case -- both of those cases, Goodman and St. Francis
College, both came from the Third Circuit, a -- but they
were decided in reverse order by this Court from the way
they were decided by the Third Circuit.

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

In the Third

Circuit -- the Third Circuit had first decided that the
personal injury statute of limitations should apply to
1983 actions in Goodman.

Then the St. Francis College

case came along, and they said we are now applying the
Goodman rule to a later case and therefore Chevron Oil
v. Huson applied.

And that certainly was correct.

But when it got to this Court, this Court

15
16

That

simply assumed for the purpose of St. Francis that -that the personal injury statute would apply and it
wasn't -- didn't make that decision.

So, it applied the

same principle and it actually decided the merits of the
19 — 1981 statute of limitations and the later Goodman
case.

In these circumstances, neither of those cases in

any way departs from our view that the decision here
should be applied in this case.
Unless you have further questions, I'd like to
reserve the rest of my time.

Thank you, Mr. Schiff.

We'll hear now from you, Mr. Kimerling.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH KIMERLING

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KIMERLING:

5

6

please the Court:
What Petitioners seek here will undermine

7

8
9
10
11
12

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

everything that this Court sought to accomplish in
Wilson v. Garcia.

The explicit motivating purpose of

the Wilson decision was to provide some uniformity and
provide some certainty to the question of the statutes
of limitations under 1983 actions and therefore avoid

13

unnecessary and time consuming litigation in 1983

14

claims.

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

At that time, the lower courts followed a
myriad of different practices in determining the
appropriate state statute of limitations.

Some courts

looked at the specific factual allegations in a
complaint and tried to match them with state common law
and statutory claims.

Other courts took a particular

statute of limitations and said this applies in all 1983
claims, but these decisions varied from panel to panel
and from circuit to circuit.
What Petitioners seek here will recreate that
type of unnecessary and time-consuming litigation
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

because there is not but one statute of limitations that

2

covers intentional torts, but two in 32 or 33 states

3

that we've looked at and put in our appendix.

4

is no clear, bright line to deciding among them.

5

And there

In New York, for example, if a prisoner has an

6

Eighth Amendment claim against a prison doctor, do you

7

use the two and a half year statute of limitations that

8

applies for personal injury claimants against doctors,

9

or do you use the one-year provision that applies to

10

certain specific torts?

Well, if -- if you go along and

11

say, well, chose the one that -- that specifies

12

intentional torts, what do you do in Alabama where

13

there's a six-year provision that specifies three

14

intentional torts and a two-year provision that

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

specifies three or more intentional torts?

MR. KIMERLING:

That's — I think that's

important misconception of what 1983 was concerned

about. Nineteen eighty-three was not concerned about the

6

There's a quote that we provide in our brief

In Monroe v. Pape says:

MR. KIMERLING:

I -- I think that -- that when

you try to take the word "intentional tort" and use that
word "intent" and apply it in a constitutional context,
you have two different words with two different
meanings. Certainly when you talk about one of the
primary concerns of 1983, which was the denial of equal
protection and you talk about intent, you're not talking

1

3

And it's -- and it really is a question of
statutory interpretation -- excuse me -- statutory
interpretation.

And if you look back at 1871 and you

4

look back at the statutes of limitations in effect at

5

that time, you see that they retained a lot of their

6

English roots in that they were divided between statutes

7

of limitations that covered trespass claims, assault,

8

battery and false imprisonment and statutes of

25

limitations that covered action on a case, which were
the general personal injury provisions of the time.
And the difference between trespass and action
on the case is not the difference between intent and
non-intent.

Rather, it's the difference between direct,

physical force, which is a trespass, and indirect
injury. One of the classic examples that the courts used
and continue to use to describe that difference is a
situation where someone throws a log onto the highway.
If you're hit by that log, you have a claim for trespass
because it's a direct, physical force injury.

If you

come along the highway later and trip over it, you have
an action on the case.
And if you look at -- at what was at issue in
-- in 1871, it wasn't these tortuous acts of the Klan.
Yes, they were the catalyst, but what they were trying
to do was to insure that the state provided an adequate

if the state failed to do that, that would be an

indirect injury because there would be no direct,

Congress would have designated at that time.

appropriateness, as this Court defined in Burnett v.
Grattan, means that a statute of limitations must take
into account the goals and policies underlying Section
1983 and as well take into account the practicalities of
litigation.

It was a unique remedy, one -- one

that didn't exist and they wanted to ensure that the
rights under the Bill of Rights passed on to -- to
everyone through the Fourteenth Amendment were being
enforced.

It would be totally inappropriate and totally

inconsistent to attach that broad remedy to some
truncated statutory period.
The -- if you look at New York's statutory
scheme, for example, you see that there's a one-year
provision for some of these specified intentional torts,
a three-year provision for the general remedy for
personal injury, a three-year provision for civil -rights
claims against state actors, and a six-year provision
for certain constitutional claims.

That's New York's

own view of the -- of the relative importance of those
different types of claims.
This -- this Court has pointed out that
statutes of limitations ‘are a weighing process.

Is this derived from Wilson v.

Yes, it is.

By that I

mean under Section 1988, which is the section that you

MR. KIMERLING:

That's correct, and I think

that's why it is inconsistent with 1983.
Section 1986 was the Sherman Amendment.

That

was the most controversial element of 18 -- of the 1871

5

legislation.

6

That's the provision that everybody was

debating and fighting over, and it was the subject of

7

numerous compromises.

went back to conference twice, and it was only coming

9

out of the conference, the joint conference, the second

That bill, the Sherman Amendment,

time that it had this one-year provision.
At that time, if you had looked at the action

12

on the case, statutes of limitations, which were the

13

ones that Congress said should be the form of action,

14

every state I think except four had more than one year

if we choose that, I don't think not on a -- on a -- on

But --

No, not at all.

I think — I

think that -- that you've gone far down the road to

11

questions as to whether or not a one-year provision is

And I don't have to tell you the names.

But they came out of the Senate Judiciary.
But the -- the -- the -- the -- the one-year
provision I think the fact that it was attached to
Section 1986, the most controversial provision of this
legislation, one in which the sponsor of that
legislation, Senator Thurmond and his chief opponent,
Senator Thurmond, both concurred after it had gone
through this amendment process, one of which was the
attachment of this truncated statutory period, that it
wasn't worth the paper it's written on.

And if you look

probably back in -- in -- in the annotations, there are
very, very few 1986 cases ever been brought.
And I think there's substantial basis to
reject it, but again I don't think you have to reach
that question here, obviously, because here you have a
choice. And the choice is between a general personal

that's consistent with the purposes of 1983 and
