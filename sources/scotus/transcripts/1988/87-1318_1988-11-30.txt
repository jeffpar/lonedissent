This case concerns the effect of a contractual

12

13

choice-of-law clause on feoeral pree11ptlon of a state

1•

statute that conflicts with the Federal Arbitration Act.

1s

The ease presents several discrete Issues that

1s

have been raised In br lef by the parties.

11

Include I

18

Tnese Issues

First• th• question of whether the state court

19

of appeal was correct In construing the choice-of-law

20

clause to exclude any application of federal

21

case and thus to shlelo the stat• statute against

22

pr •••Pt.I on;

D

law to this

Second• whether the choice-of-law clause
should be held Invalid and unenforceable as a vlolatlon

25

Ano third, th• Question raised by Stanford's

•

content Ion t hat the state statute at Issue here .. oul d

s

not be pree•pted by the Federal Arbitration Act even In

6

the event th at t he con tra ct hao contained no

1

ehotce-ot-lu• clause.

s

ln addition to these three s ub stantive Issues,

9

th• ease presents a -- a fourth Issue that was raised Dy

10

the Court ltsel t In Its or11er postponing eonslderatl on

11

of the Question of Its Jurisdiction, and that Issue, at

12

least as the parties have discerned It fro11 the Court's

13

order, Is 10hether the Court has Jurisdiction to

1•

reexaaln• the court of appeal's Interpretation of the

15

ehol ce-of-111,. c I ause or 10hathe r , on the other hand, that

16

lnterpretatl on rests upon an acequate and I nd ependent

11

state ground that preoludes review of that Iss ue by this

18

Court.

19

Under th• rules of the Court, I a• of course

20

required to discuss the Jurlsdlctlonal Issue at the

21

outset of ay argu11ento and I w 111 therefore proceed

22

directly to an ••••lnatlon of that Issue, leavlng the

23

2

enu111erated In our orlefs no less tnan eight alternative

3

reasons why this Court, lnoeeo, possesses jurisdiction

•

to deter•lne the effect of the choice-of-law clause In

5

th Is case ano why this Court's examination of that Issue

s

Is not for•c loseo by an adequate and lndepenoent state

grcund.

1, of course, won't recapl tu late all of these
reasons here.

Rather 1 want to e•phaslze only two of

10

th•• that 1 oee,. to I>•

the

11

first of th••• because It would per111lt the Court to

12

sustain Its Jurisdiction In this case on a pertlcularly

13

narrow grouno, If It shouto so des Ire; and the other,

1•

because It would allow the Court to provide significant

15

further gu ldance for the devetopeent of th• law

1&

concerning the general question of the effect of a -- of

11

a choice-of-law clause on the scooe of federal

1s

preemption and the appllceblltty of feoerat law.
The f lrst ano probably the narrowest grouno on

20

which the Court •l11ht sustain Its Jurisdiction In this

21

case Is pro•lded by

choice-of-la• clause Itself.
