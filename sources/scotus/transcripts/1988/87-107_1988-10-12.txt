ORAL ARGUMENT OF JULIUS LeVONNE CHAMBERS

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

12

MR. CHAMBERS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court.
The Court's order of April 25, 1988 directed

13

that the parties address the issue of whether the Court

14

should reconsider its decision in Runyon v. McCrary.

15

Runyon held that 42 U.S.C. 1981 applies to private

16

contractual relations and in that case prohibited a

17

private school from discriminating on the basis of race

18

in its admission practices.

19

I will first show that the doctrines of

20

congressional ratification and stare decisis preclude

21

reconsideration of Runyon.

22

the remaining half of my argument that Runyon was

23

correctly decided.

24

revisit Runyon, I submit that Runyon was correctly

25

decided and should be reaffirmed.

I will then demonstrate in

Thus, even if the Court decides to

1

Congressional ratification and stare decisis,

2

as adopted and applied by this Court, require that

3

Runyon be followed and not reversed.

4

1981 have become a significant part of the web of joint

5

congressional and judicial efforts to rid the country of

6

public and private discrimination.

7

under these circumstances would not only reject

8

congressional reliance and decisions of the Court but

9

legislation specifically designed by Congress

Runyon and Section

Reversing Runyon

10

incorporating the Court's decision and attempting to

11

encourage the use and enforcement of Section 1981.

12

would virtually abandon stare decisis as a fundamental

13

doctrine of a court.

14

It

Legislative efforts of Congress since Runyon

15

and its precursor, Jones v. Mayer, show a consistent

16

pattern of congressional adoption and ratification of

17

the Court's holdings that Section 1981 prohibits public

18

and private discrimination in contractual dealings.

19

Three months after the decision in Runyon, Congress

20

passed a law providing attorney fees to encourage

21

enforcement or use of Section 1981.

22

The Attorney Fees Act is highly significant.

23

It is not simply that the Congress was aware of Runyon.

24

It is not merely that the Attorney Fees Act shows that

25

Congress approved of Runyon.

Both points are true, but

there's more.

Runyon and Jones were the foundation building

3

blocks for the Attorney Fees Act and its applicability

4

to Section 1981.

5

law that would have made no sense had Runyon not been

6

decided.

7

that Sections 1981 and 1982 permitted an individual to

8

use those acts to challenge private discrimination.

9

Jones and Runyon are now reversed, there would be no

10

basis for lawsuits based on Section 1981 and 1982 in

11

which attorney fees could be awarded if one is

12

successful.

13

Congress built on Runyon by passing a

That is true because Runyon and Jones held

If

The Fees Act applies the private attorney

14

general theory under which Congress encouraged private

15

attorneys to use civil rights statutes to vindicate a

16

policy of Congress by providing a fee for litigants who

17

bring Jones and Runyon types of proceedings.

18

asserted that the people who litigate those claims

19

vindicated congressional policy and Congress wanted --

20

QUESTION:

Congress

But the fee-setting, Mr. Chambers

21

-- you would still have been able to recover against

22

public bodies in a suit under 1981, wouldn't you?

23

MR. CHAMBERS:

That's correct, Your Honor, but

24

we also would have been able to recover under 1983.

25

what Congress was doing was building on the Court's

And

1

decisions in Runyon and Jones which permitted one to

2

challenge private discrimination.

3

and without Jones, 1981 and 1982 would be of little

4

value at all.

5

under 1983 in challenging public bodies, and it wanted

6

to encourage the use of 1981 and 1982 to encourage

7

lawsuits challenging private discrimination.

So, Congress noted that one could recover

This is of direct congressional endorsement

9

And without Runyon

and ratification of Runyon and Jones.

And I don't know

10

of anything else that Congress could do to tell the

11

Court that it accepted and ratified and wanted to use

12

the Court's decisions to encourage enforcement of 1981

13

and 1982.

14

decision in Jones and Runyon, and we want to build upon

15

it, and we want to encourage private litigants to use

16

this Act.

17

that Act effective is to provide attorney fees so that

18

private parties can use it.

Congress expressly said we endorse your

provision.

make that Act a part of the civil rights provisions that

23

would permit one to challenge public and private

24

discrimination.

25

circumstances would in our opinion fly right in the face

It endorsed, it encouraged, and it wanted to

And reversing Runyon under those

1

of Congress' efforts to use your decision to prohibit

2

public and private discrimination.

3

And the way the Court and Congress has worked

4

in this area, where Congress has built on what the Court

5

has decided, to try to rid the country of discriminatory

6

practices would be contrary to decisions that this Court

7

has rendered and every precedent that I know of.

8

don't think that under these circumstances it would be

9

appropriate for the Court to strike that building block

10

that Congress had built to remove Runyon as a means for

11

now challenging private discrimination in contractual

12

matters.
QUESTION:

13

And I

Counsel, in this phase of the

14

argument where we are talking about stare decisis, I

15

take it we assume arguendo the premise that you disagree

16

with, that the case was wrongly decided in the first

17

instance.

18

the premise for the stare decisis argument.

19

20
21

You disagree with that, but that's part of

MR. CHAMBERS:

Well, Your Honor, I submit that

the case was correctly decided, which I'll address.
QUESTION:

I know you do, and I think that

22

that's a very arguable point and there's a lot of merit

23

to that position.

24

we're assuming the case is wrongly decided, yet we

25

should retain it in any event.

But in this phase of the argument,

Isn't that the point?

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

MR. CHAMBERS:

1

Your Honor, I go a bit further.

2

I say that the 1976 Attorney Fees Act creates another

3

step that the Court should not overlook.

4

something stronger than stare decisis.

5

Congress has spoken in 1976.

And it's

It has done

6

everything it could do except expressly adopt that

7

statute .
QUESTION:

8
9

Well, it didn't change -- it didn't

change the word "right."

It didn't say that private

10

persons can recover.

And the President, when he signed

11

the bill, did not necessarily endorse the legislative

12

history.

13

MR. CHAMBERS:

14

QUESTION:

Your Honor --

So, I think that's -- I think you

15

make a legitimate argument.

16

conclusive.
MR. CHAMBERS:

17

I do not think it's

All right.

My point is that

18

the Court said that one could use 1981 to challenge

19

private discrimination.
QUESTION:

20

Congress adopted that --

I recognize that, but I'm asking

21

you if we're not assuming that even if we have questions

22

about Runyon, that we should retain it for reasons of

23

stare decisis.

24

argument?

25

Isn't that the first prong of your

MR. CHAMBERS:

That is one prong, Your Honor,
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

but my -QUESTION:

2

Are you aware of any precedent in

3

the jurisprudence of this Court in which we proceed on

4

the assumption that a statute which creates a right has

5

been wrongly construed and yet we continue that

6

precedent on the books?

7

MR. CHAMBERS:

Your Honor, you have a number

8

of precedents that say that unless you find that the

9

case is clearly wrong on the findings, and unless you

10

find the other exceptions that you apply in deciding not

11

to follow stare decisis, that you will follow stare

12

decisis.

13

If you find, for example, that the Court's

14

interpretation is clearly wrong, egregiously wrong, and

15

is causing problems -- for example, the Flood case

16

dealing with the antitrust laws.

17

Congress has shown that it approves of what the Court

18

has done and isn't changing it.

19

QUESTION:

There you say that

Of course, the Flood case was

20

isolated to baseball.

21

interstate commerce and antitrust.

22

order to create further rights.

23

Baseball is not part of
We did not use it in

And that's my point.

Do you have any precedent to show us that a

24

case which is arguably wrongly construed should remain

25

the seminal case for the enforcement and the
9

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

interpretation of the statute?

2

precedent for that?
MR. CHAMBERS:

3

Do you have any

Again, Your Honor, I'm saying

4

that the Court -- the decisions that the Court has

5

followed in this area where Congress has spoken, and I'm

6

referring, for example, to cases like Bob Jones.

7

referring to cases like Patsy v. Florida Board.

8

have looked at decisions, and you questioned whether

9

those decisions are arguably wrong -- the precedents

I'm
You

10

that were being considered.

You questioned whether

11

there are other precedents or exceptions that would

12

warrant the Court deviating from that prior decision.
And in this case, what I'm saying is that the

13
14

record demonstrates that the original decision was wrong

15

-- was right -- that is, the Runyon decision was

16

correctly decided.
And even if you had any question about it,

17
18

what has transpired since Runyon?

19

immediately after your decision in Runyon I submit

20

forecloses the Court now setting aside the Runyon

21

decision.

22

QUESTION:

What Congress did

Mr. Chambers, let me ask also since

23

we're talking about what Congress has done.

If Mrs.

24

Patterson is correct that any lawsuit affecting terms

25

and conditions of employment that alleges discrimination
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

can be filed under Section 1981, then why do you suppose

2

it is Congress established the EEOC and passed Title

3

VII? They've become a dead letter.

4

needed if Section 1981 is available for every such

5

action.
Do you think Congress has spoken at all by

6
7

passing Title VII?
MR. CHAMBERS:

8
9

They're not even

Your Honor, I think Congress

did, and I think that in 1972 Congress made it clear

10

that it wanted to make both remedies available for

11

challenging discrimination in employment.

12

effort, as the Court knows, by Senator Hruska to make

13

Title VII and the Equal Pay Act the exclusive remedies

14

for challenging private discrimination.

15

then and said that it wanted to continue both remedies.

ago, in 1976.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. CHAMBERS:

20

Your Honor.

25

Congress spoke more than that,

Thirty-three/33 and 33 abstaining,

I guess.
MR. CHAMBERS:

23
24

Congress spoke 33 to 33.

After the 33 to 33 vote, the bill --

QUESTION:

21

22

Congress spoke

And Congress spoke again, as I said a moment

17

There was an

QUESTION:

That was just in the Senate.
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

MR. CHAMBERS:

1

The Senate voted larger than

2

that on reconsideration and decided that it wanted to

3

preserve both remedies.
Additionally, I would point out that in 1976

4
5

Congress spoke again and said that it wanted to preserve

6

both remedies and wanted to encourage the use of both

7

remedies.

8

I think that those acts of Congress foreclose the Court

9

from now -- for now reconsidering the Runyon decision.

10

So, again, under congressional ratification,

Additionally, I would point out that in

11

applying the doctrine of stare decisis, none of the

12

exceptions that the Court has used is applicable here.

13

What has happened since Runyon, not only in

14

Congress but in other acts of private entities and

15

governmental bodies, demonstrate that the public accepts

16

and wants to perpetuate the use of the Runyon and the

17

Jones decision.

18
19

20

QUESTION:
Public acceptance?

I'm not sure what this argument is.
I mean --

MR. CHAMBERS:

I'm saying that the Runyon

21

decision is consistent with public mores, that the

22

Runyon decision is what the Congress and what the States

23

and what private individuals like to use.

24

25

QUESTION:

And they are

Well, if that were entirely -12

entirely dispositive, it wouldn't be very important what

2

we do on the subject because Congress would simply

3

remedy whatever mistake we might make.

4

-- if there is that overwhelming acceptance, Congress

5

would simply repass -- repass 1981 saying very clearly

6

that it applies to all private actions.
MR. CHAMBERS:

I mean, if they

Your Honor, in this area,

operated.

Yes.

MR. CHAMBERS:

They have worked with each

other and built a body of law to prohibit

QUESTION:

18

I find some inconsistency between

19

two arguments that are made to us:

one being that

20

everybody has accepted it and the society wants it; and

21

the other being that -- made by -- in one of the amicus

22

briefs that if we should go back on Runyon, Congress

23

wouldn't be able to pass a statute to replace the effect

24

of Runyon.

25

could be true.

I mean, it seems to me strange that both

MR. CHAMBERS:

1

Well, Your Honor, I don't think

2

that the brief that the Court is referring to poses an

3

inconsistency.

4

would impose a burden.

5

Congress to have to go back and enact a law to replace

6

Section 1981 if you reversed it.
QUESTION:

What the brief suggested was that it
It would be time consuming for

Do you think they would enact 1981

in its current form?
MR. CHAMBERS:

9

Well, Your Honor, I don't -- I

10

don't want to speculate on that.

I think that we would

11

have -- we have demonstrated Congress' interest in

12

preserving 1981, and we have demonstrated that this

13

Court has respected that act by Congress.

14

encouraging the Court here to follow the precedents in

15

this civil rights area affecting race and as the Court

16

has done in other areas.

And we are

Turning then to the legislative history, as I

17
18

suggested, Runyon was correctly decided in 1976.

First,

19

let me address the defendant's or Respondent's position

20

that the 1970 -- 1874 codification of 1981 in some way

21

made 1981 a Fourteenth Amendment act.
We have shown in our brief that the defendant

22
23

relies here on a headnote and some notes that appeared

24

in a codification of 1981 after Congress had codified

25

the Act.

But more particularly, the legislative history
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

clearly demonstrates that Congress in codifying Section

2

1981 in 1874 was codifying both the 1886 Act as well as

3

the 1870 Act.
QUESTION:

4

If we had -- if we had had to

5

interpret the Act in 1874 and had it been interpreted at

6

that date, would we have even looked at the legislative

7

history?
MR. CHAMBERS:

8
9

or -- ?

I think the Court would have.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. CHAMBERS:

12

QUESTION:

13

The legislative history of 1866

Really?
Because, Your Honor, the --

In the 19th century, we looked at

legislative history in interpreting statutes?
MR. CHAMBERS:

14

I think if the Court had a

15

question about the meaning of 1981, if the Court wanted

16

to fortify a decision that 1981 applied to private

17

discrimination, it would look at what Congress was

18

trying to address in 1866.
QUESTION:

19

I think you'll find, Mr. Chambers,

20

that until probably the 1920s, we wouldn't have looked

21

at it in anywhere near -- if at all -- in anywhere near

22

the detail that was used to render our decision in

23

Runyon.

24

1974 on the meaning of this statute would have been

25

different even assuming that the use of the legislative

So, almost inevitably the decision rendered in

2

would have been different in 1874 than it would have

3

been when Runyon was decided.

4

MR. CHAMBERS:

Almost inevitably it

Well, Your Honor, I -- I would

5

differ with the Court.

But the point is in 1988 when

6

we're looking at Runyon, we look at what Congress meant

7

with the enactment in 1866.

8

in 1874, and we know that Congress was trying to address

9

a pervasive problem of enslaving blacks who were

The statutory words prohibit

20

discrimination in the making and enforcement of

contracts, and that covers the type of conduct that we

22

have involved here with Ms. Patterson.

23

That's the point.

And as we look at the legislative history, we

24

see a Congress that saw blacks, freed blacks, harassed

25

in the work place, denied pay, and that's the kind of

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

conduct that this Congress was trying to reach.

This

2

case is typical of the conduct that Congress was trying,

3

to address in 1866.
So, I don't think there's a problem about

applying this statute to cover harassment in the work

Looking at the legislative history, I think we

go back to look at where Congress was trying to address

QUESTION:

10
11

One more question on this, counsel,

and then I'll let you proceed.
I assume that the answer would be the same in

12
13

1866.

When Congress passed the statute in 1866, it

14

thought that it was forbidding the use of racial

15

epithets in the work place?

16

MR. CHAMBERS:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. CHAMBERS:

Your Honor --

Or is this an evolving standard?
I think that in 1866 Congress

19

had egregious conduct and practices that it wanted to

20

correct that were perpetuated by private individuals.
QUESTION:

21

22

And do we measure those egregious

standards by the changing standards of society?
MR. CHAMBERS:

23

I think we apply the law to the

24

facts and at the time that we are looking at the

25

situation.

I think that Congress meant to reach this
21

kind of conduct.

It might be a different type of employer.
We're working in the

And that's what Congress meant

Again, going back looking at the conditions

10

that Congress was addressing in 1866, we had not only

pervasive practices by private individuals who were

12

placing blacks back in slavery as before, but we had

13

also some governmental legislation.

We all concede that in

the country of the slavery that we had just enacted the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROGER S. KAPLAN

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4
5

MR. KAPLAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.

6

I think the basic problem in the presentation

7

of the Petitioner's arguments in this case is that they

8

start from the wrong baseline.

9

-- the 1960s or 1970s, I think the proper point of

Instead of looking to 19

10

departure is really much earlier date, 1883, when the

11

Court handed down the civil rights cases and indicated

12

in a opinion, which was generally respected for a long

13

time thereafter, that this statute would not reach

14

private acts of discrimination.

15

Many years go by.

The Nation matures.

We

16

encounter other types of problems, particularly in the

17

area of racial discrimination.

18

and early 1960s, there's a movement in Congress that

19

something has to be done.

20

angst and anger and controversy, Congress comes up with

21

the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

22

And in the late 1950s

And after four years or so of

I think what we are dealing with here is

23

really the force that sets in motion a pattern of

24

congressional action, a decision that it is the

25

legislative branch which must take control of these
23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

things, which must provide the remedies, since none

2

apparently exist, and must control how our society is to

3

develop in terms of meeting racial equality in the work

4

place and elsewhere.
The problem that I see with these decisions,

5
6

Runyon in particular, is they threaten this -- this

7

orderly development and this appropriate, I think,

8

allocation of authority to Congress to deal with these

9

-- with these measures.
Title VII, for example, which is the primary

10
11

statute where these cases really come up, has a

12

different thrust, a different emphasis, than Section

13

1981.

QUESTION:

14

Mr. Kaplan, I'm sure that's always

15

true whenever we come out with the wrong interpretation

16

of a statute.

17

the function of the Congress and violated to a degree

18

the separation of powers, which is the point you're

19

making I suppose.

To some extent, we have interfered with

But surely you wouldn't say that we should

20
21

have no stare decisis whatever in the field of statutory

22

construction, would you?
MR. KAPLAN:

23
24
25

No, I would not say that,

certainly.
QUESTION:

So, what are the special factors
24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

that should -- should urge us to disregard stare

2

decisis?

3

Why is this case special?
MR. KAPLAN:

I think that what has to be

4

focused on is the impact of this kind of legislation or

5

rule-making evident in Runyon on the operation of Title

6

VII itself.

7

noted, and I think it bears repeating that what that

8

statute is emphasizing is a conciliatory approach

9

involving a government involvement by the EEOC which is

And I think this has been discussed and

10

a congressional determination as to how things should

11

operate, and also a specific congressionally determined

12

judicial remedy if that fails, which basically is

13

equitable and remedial, back pay, reinstatement.

14

This rule, the rule of Runyon, allows for

15

punitive damages, for compensatory damages.

16

17

-- to shape the scope of investigations and determine

18

how broad the remedies should be made.

19

20

settlement of these problems.

21

It cuts the

It doesn't allow it to escape

It doesn't

But it also disregards something else in Title

22

VII which is federalism.

And that statute specifically

23

encouraged the States to pass laws and create agencies

24

to take care of these problems and solve it in its own

25

jurisdiction through the deferral procedure.

This also

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

threatens that procedure and that concern.

9

What we're dealing with is

basically a congressionally --

5

6

Mr. Kaplan, may I ask a question?

Yes.
Of course, Runyon wasn't an

employment case, and what we're really focusing on today

10

is whether Runyon, which was a denial of an opportunity

11

to go to school case -- whether that should be

overruled.

that all.

Yes.
-- after the legislation that your

opponent stressed in his opening part of his argument?

6

MR. KAPLAN:

7

QUESTION:

Pardon me?
Your opponent made quite a point of

8

the fact that Congress did act after Runyon was decided.

9

So, I don't think you have a decision of Congress not to

10

act in the private school area.

MR. KAPLAN:

13

Well -Or do you?

How do -- explain that

to me.
MR. KAPLAN:

14

Well, I -- I think in the -- at

MR. KAPLAN:

9

Well, it cited I think the Santa

10

Fe Trail case, which is a companion.

11

there was some knowledge of it.

I presume that

But I think the focus of Congress in doing

12
13

that was not so much to place its imprimatur on 1981 as

14

a reexamination and approval of everything that had

15

happened there, but simply as a broad gesture, a sort of

16

a exercise in judicial parity, if you will, to create an

17

equality.

18

QUESTION:

My only point is to question your

19

statement that Congress has affirmatively decided not to

20

act in the school discrimination context.

21

MR. KAPLAN:

Well, I think at least it has not

22

acted, and if it has not acted, that too is an

23

appropriate aspect for the Court to respect whether or

24

not it acts is also part of the congressional judgment.

25

It doesn't mean that the Court steps in if Congress
28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

hasn't simply acted in a particular area.
QUESTION:

2

Once again, that's always the case

3

where the Court makes a mistake in statutory

4

construction and Congress does not act to remedy the

5

mistake.

That's always the case.
What's distinctive in this case that would

6
7

justify our disregarding the normal rules of stare

decisis?

MR. KAPLAN:

17

You see we've gotten the law wrong,
That's the hypothesis in all of

We may have gotten it wrong, but we've gotten it.

MR. KAPLAN:

Why is this

The -- again, having notice --

18

noting that the Court has made its decisions, the fact

19

remains that when Congress addresses these problems, it

20

has an option to address particular issues or not to

21

address particular issues.

22

don't think it's the -- it's the function of the Court

23

to step in there and fill in all these -- all these gaps.

24
25

QUESTION:

And if it doesn't, then I

I don't know what to say there.

You're not answering my question.

case.

Every time we come out with a statutory

interpretation that is wrong and Congress doesn't turn

around and set it right you can always make that

argument.

the proposition that we should not have any doctrine of

the argument that the Petitioner was making that any

terms and conditions of employment, can fit into this

If -- what is happening here is that the

language of a statute which was designed for some other

purpose, a more limited purpose, has been used now as a

that there's a great deal of legislative history that

25

MR. KAPLAN:

I would suggest to you, sir, that

the history, if read in toto, strongly suggests that

-- and quite widespread incidents

of private discrimination, but that the means that was

selected for dealing with the problem was to try to

remove these disabilities and incapacities that were

arising from the legislation in the South.

8

it was expected that once this was cleaned up, the

normal processes of State court adjudication and

administration would avail the freedman of his rights

under this particular statute.

does the statute acquire any new meaning on its own

terms?

And I think that's

And I think that's really why this statute

21

should be interpreted as applying to a narrower field

than it has presently been given effect to, and that the

relies on, for example, the Johnson Railway Express case

here involving coverage in terms, for example, of the

The Court has had to have at

What I find concerns me, though, is -- and I'm

getting back to the Title VII issue because I think that

is the -- has to be the primary focus because that's

9

where it's primarily being used.

Approximately, from

10

what we could tell, three-quarters or more of the 1981

11

cases come in the employment area.

12

think you can ignore that particular focus on this

13

statute.

And so, I don't

14

And what is happening, as we began to mention

15

before, is that it's beginning to push out Title VII as

16

a remedy and, in fact, what it's doing is creating an

17

overlay of additional remedies which Congress did not

18

decide to give.

19

should be in the position of furthering that, and

20

certainly Congress can consider its -- the effectiveness

of this legislation in that area and also determine

whether or not the need is there in other areas.

I don't -- I don't think that the Court

If that's all you have, Mr. Kaplan,

I'm afraid it's nothing because that's always the case

when we interpret a statute incorrectly.

What you have

5

MR. KAPLAN:

6

Well, I think Runyon was based on

an incomplete analysis of the statute.

It had no

independent analysis of its own.

It would not just affect the

up are specific and deal with -- with problems that I

think are better suited to legislative judgments in

MR. CHAMBERS:

No, Your Honor.

We're talking

14

about a black person trying to work and make a living.

15

That's what Congress was trying to reach in 1866.

When Congress looked at the Runyon decision

talked about harassment on the job, again, a proving of

the decisions that the Courts had rendered.

the applicability of a statute designed to make it

In 1976 -- 1972 and 1964 when Congress was

enacting the Title VII or the Civil Rights Act of that

13

time, it was looking at pervasive practices of

discrimination, and it wanted to provide a remedy.

it said it wanted to provide multiple remedies to make
