We know what abuse of process Is In thl s

14

is the Issuance of a summons In Dad faith

for an 11 legltlmate purpose that is not encompassed by

15 the congresslonal grant of authority and the other is

,Ind that's why there Is a su1111ons

In this case, and In most cases, the court

11

Jn the La Sa 11 e c a se, cf course, there was a

12 enforced there because of the danger at that time
13 Information would Immediately Infringe on crl11lnal

d lscovery and the role of the grand jury because there

15 had already been a criminal referral In effect.

there Is no way to draw a I 1ne between the kind of
