CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We will hear

4

argument now in No. 88-605, William L. Webster versus

5

Reproductive Health Services.

By General Webster.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L. WEBSTER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. WEBSTER:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the court, this case represents a direct appeal

10

that involves a 1986 Missouri statute defining the

11

rights of the unborn and regulating abortion in

12

Missouri.

13

for this court's review:

14

boundaries on the limitations of public funding; the

15

second, the effect of and the facial constitutionality

16

of legislation declaring that life begins at conception;

17

and, third, the ability of a state to require a

18

physician to perform tests and to make and record

19

findings when determining viability.

20

asked this court to reconsider the standard of review to

21

be applied to state abortion regulation.

22

Missouri's appeal involves three basic areas
The first, the constitutional

Finally, we have

Since 1973 this court has reaffirmed Roe

23

versus Wade's mandate, state and lower Federal courts

24

have repeatedly interpreted that mandate, frequently

25

strictly against the states.

One result is that the

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

states have effectively been forbidden, not only to

2

prohibit abortion but usually to regulate abortion in

3

any significant way.

4

We would begin with the public funding area

5

where the Eighth Circuit upheld that portion of

6

Missouri's law which declared unlawful the expenditure

7

of public funds for the purpose of performing or

8

assisting in an abortion but struck down three

9

subsequent sections.

The court declared first of all

10

Section 188.205 relating to the expenditure of public

11

funds for abortion advocacy, facially unconstitutional.

12

We would contend to the court as we have at every level

13

that this particular section, which we have appealed,

14

does not go to the speech but rather is directed at the

15

entities responsible for expending public funds.

16
17

QUESTION:

Mr. Webster, is that the argument

you made below?

18

MR. WEBSTER:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

There were three sections.

Yes I know.

Is that the argument

you made with regard to this section?
MR. WEBSTER:

Yes.

Yes.

We have suggested

22

throughout that this language is directed towards those

23

individuals responsible for the expenditure of public

24

funds, that it is not directed to any physician or any

25

health care provider.

We would note that much of

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Appellees brief treats it as if the subsequent two

2

sections are still before the Court dealing with public

3

employees and other health care providers and speech in

4

public facilities.
But that's not what we have brought here.

5

We

6

contend the government is certainly not obligated in and

7

of itself to become an advocate for abortion.

8

court was very explicit in Meyer when it concluded that

9

a state is not required to show a compelling interest

This

10

for its policy choice to favor child birth, normal child

11

birth over advocacy of abortion.
QUESTION:

12

13

So some part of the decision below

you don't appeal, especially in the speech area?

14

MR. WEBSTER:

There are two provisions in the

15

speech area that are not before this court.

16

with the speech of public employees and the other the

17

speech in public facilities.

18

remains —

QUESTION:

The only issue that

So you don't challenge the judgment

20

below in that respect?

21

MR. WEBSTER:

We have not challenged those.

22

We have not brought those before this court.

We also

23

deal with the question of public funding in hospitals

24

and the use of public employees.

25

the Eighth Circuit struck down Missouri's prohibition of

3

of this court in Poelker and Maher.

4

the state is defending are clearly within the authority

5

recognized by the abortion funding decisions of this

6

court and especially by Poelker.

7

We suggest that they ignored the language
These statutes that

The lower court chose to rely on its own

8

precedent of Nyberg versus City of Virginia.

9

that that is clearly wrong.

We contend

In essence, the court in

10

Nyberg has contorted Roe to create an abortion right in

11

public hospitals, requiring those public facilities to

12

provide abortions if, in fact, the patient has the

13

capacity to pay.

14

to suggest that if you can afford an abortion, we have

15

to provide one for you in a public facility but if you

16

lack the financial capacity to provide an abortion, that

17

the state and other public governmental entities are not

18

obligated to provide those services for you.

19

And it seems to us a convoluted result

General Webster, can I ask you one

clarifying question?

10

11

MR. WEBSTER:

To my knowledge there is no

sanction for violation.
QUESTION:

It is not a misdemeanor?

What is

the state's method of enforcement then?
MR. WEBSTER:

The language here is directed

towards those bodies that expend the public funds.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. WEBSTER:

Right.
Public funds whether it's

14

related to encouraging or counseling or the expenditure

15

of public funds for the performance of abortion.

16

would presume that the remedy would be injunctive relief

17

to prevent either the facilities from performing those

18

services or to prohibit the expenditure of the funds

19

themselves to be appropriated to that facility.

QUESTION:

in a public hospital went ahead and performed in the

first trimester, performed an abortion.

carries a general Class A misdemeanor penalty for

1

violations of the initial sections, but there is no

2

operative language in the 1986 statute.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. WEBSTER:

5

8

9

Arguably it would be a

misdemeanor.
QUESTION:

6

7

So it would be a misdemeanor then?

What is your opinion?

Don't you

know?
MR. WEBSTER:

My opinion is that there is no

language in that section which was adopted here which

10

would suggest that it would make it a criminal offense,

11

only that it is directed to those bodies expending the

12

public funds themselves.

13

QUESTION:

Is it your opinion as the chief law

14

enforcement officer of the state that it would not be a

15

misdemeanor?

16
17

MR. WEBSTER:

We wouldn't view that violation

as a misdemeanor, no.

18

QUESTION:

19

other than injunctive relief?

20

and did it and you don't enjoin him in time, that would

21

be the end of it?

22

Is there any enforcement provision

MR. WEBSTER:

If the doctor went ahead

That is the only enforcement

23

power that we would presume contained in the language

24

which was enacted in the 1986 statute.

25

QUESTION:

Wouldn't it be grounds for

MR. WEBSTER:

2

It is conceivable the hospital

board could if somebody violated the policy of that

facility, seek to discharge that particular employee.

QUESTION:

I might also be the official who

11

expends the funds knowing they are going to be used in

12

violation of the statute is liable for the funds.

13

would assume so.

14

Federal level, that if you make an unauthorized

15

expenditure, it comes out of your pocket.

16

That is certainly the case at the

MR. WEBSTER:

That certainly would be one of

17

the appropriate remedies.

18

those bodies that are responsible for the expenditure of

19

the funds themselves and merely say as a matter of the

20

public policy of the state of Missouri that we are not

21

going to appropriate those funds for the purpose of

22

encouraging, counseling, performing and assisting or in

23

this case the use of public facilities.

25

But the directives here go to

We believe that the result of Nyberg is
contrary to the precedent of this court in both Poelker

1

and Maher and also in Harris where it has been suggested

2

that governmental bodies do not have to appropriate

3

their funds in that manner.

4

lower court has also, challenged what we contend to be a

5

preamble of this particular statute, a declaration that

6

life begins at conception which is found in Section

7

1.205.1.
The District Court held this preamble was in

8

9

The court has also, the

conflict with the essence of Roe.

We believe this is

10

clearly wrong.

11

language in Akron which suggested a state cannot adopt

12

one theory of life, at least when life begins, for the

13

purpose of justifying its regulation of abortion.

14

have suggested from the outset in this case that these

15

findings are part of the statutory preamble and do not

16

serve as any substantive right.

17

substantive responsibility.

18

The District Court also relied on

We

They impose no

And I believe it is worth noting that there

19

were a number of sections in this chapter that were also

20

enacted in 1986 which have not been challenged, that

21

affect tort law, affect the criminal law.

22

we contend they do not affect is the regulation of

23

abortion.

24
25

The one area

There is specific language which suggests that
abortion conduct would be exempt because this exempts

from the ambit of the preamble any area that has been

2

declared subject to the rights, privileges and

3

immunities of the U.S. Constitution, decisional law and

4

the Missouri Constitution.

The operative sections which do have effect

remain unchallenged by the Appellees, but the findings

areas without violating anyone's constitutional rights

States have historically

does not in any way affect a woman's constitutional

12

right to choose abortion over child birth.

13

does specifically exclude abortion and the court seems

14

to be attempting here to try and divine what the

15

legislators' motivations might have been with language

16

which we contend has no operative effect.

17

The statute

The statute

The Eighth Circuit has invalidated an

18

abstract, philosophical statement of the legislature

19

because apparently they don't agree with it and that

20

seems to be the type of direction that we are seeing in

21

a number of the lower courts.

22

We contend this declaration doesn't affect

23

anyone, that it was clearly improperly struck down at

24

the lower court level and that legislative bodies around

We have said at the outset under Roe that

2

Missouri and every other state has an important and

3

legitimate interest in the fetus throughout pregnancy.

4

And even adopting the Roe standard, certainly that

5

interest becomes compelling at viability.

6

has said so.

This court

7

We contend the states should be permitted to

8

protect viable unborn children by requiring physicians

9

in their best medical judgment to undertake such tests

10

as are necessary to provide findings of gestational age

11

and weight.
The lower court's result would make this

12

13

obligation of the state to protect that viable fetus

14

frankly mere verbiage.

15

to make and record findings in the process of

16

determining if a child is viable, then, frankly, they

17

have very little opportunity to determine whether

18

viability has actually been found.

19

points we want to make here —
QUESTION:

20

If the state cannot be required

There are two other

Could I interrupt for a minute?

It

21

is not just age and weight as you mention, but also lung

22

maturity.

23

MR. WEBSTER:

24

QUESTION:

25

There are three facts.

And there is a good deal of

evidence that that is, number one, useless information
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

and, number two, very difficult to find without some

2

risk to the pregnant woman.
MR. WEBSTER:

3

Your Honor, there are three

4

factors and lung maturity is one of them:

gestational

5

age, fetal weight and lung maturity.

6

suggested in our brief and to the lower court, we feel

7

there are two distinguishing characteristics that

8

separate this from Colautti.

9

imposes on physicians a standard of care.

But as we have

The first is that this
It says they

10

are supposed to use the ordinary care, degree of care,

11

skill and proficiency commonly exercised by skillful,

12

careful and prudent physicians under same or similar

13

circumstances, and to the extent a particular test would

14

be inappropriate, it would not comply with that standard

15

of care.

16

We also suggest in the language that they are

17

only supposed to perform such tests as are necessary to

18

make findings of gestational age, weight and fetal lung

19

maturity, and to the extent a test would not be

20

necessary, to the extent it would show nothing, and we

21

have conceded at 20 weeks amniocentesis would not be

22

appropriate, it would clearly not be a necessary test.

1

MR. WEBSTER:

2

We believe, we believe it

3

clearly is a common sense reading of this, a common

4

sense construction, to say that if a test would not

5

demonstrate anything, it would not be in the normal

6

standard of care which this statute in the section which

7

remains upheld imposes on that physician.

8

suggesting which test they use, first of all.

9

merely suggesting that they make and record findings.

We are not
We are

10

And to the extent one test can make

11

determinations for the first two areas, gestational age

12

and fetal weight, and we believe the uncontroverted

13

record below is that ultrasound after 20 weeks can

14

benefit in making such findings, that at least those two

15

findings are relevant and should be upheld.

16

really not at the point to concede fetal weight because

17

we believe the language does distinguish for those tests

18

that are necessary.

19

QUESTION:

We are

Let me be sure I understand.

You

20

are saying the doctor if he thinks it is unnecessary

21

doesn't have to perform the lung test?
MR. WEBSTER:

22

We are contending, Your Honor,

23

that if that test would not be dispositive, if it

24

wouldn't tell them anything by definition, it cannot be

25

a necessary test.

I am assuming the doctor who makes

a determination, doesn't think the second or third tests

12

are necessary.

13

Does he have to perform them anyway?

MR. WEBSTER:

Well, this statute would require

14

them to make findings, not necessarily record tests but

15

make findings, and the language in the lower court —

The language of the lower court

What is your view on what the

statute means?
MR. WEBSTER:

My view, first of all, is that

23

the ultrasound technology which was discussed at the

24

lower court can make a finding for both gestational age

25

and fetal weight.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

QUESTION:

1

I understand that.

My question is

2

if the doctor doesn't think it is necessary, does the

3

statute require him to make the finding on A, weight,

4

and B, lungs?

MR. WEBSTER:

QUESTION:

7

MR. WEBSTER:

No.

On neither?
I don't believe that it requires

8

an unnecessary test.

To the extent they can determine

9

that a fetus is viable with the first finding, I don't

10

think their ordinary skill would require them to go

11

beyond that.

12

that point the fetus is viable, I don't believe they

13

need to go beyond that.

requires the physician to perform any tests that would

15

be unnecessary.

16

We would finally suggest in this area that if

17

Roe is the standard that is to be applied to the states,

18

and if the dependence — viability is going to be that

19

bright line that states are supposed to depend on, then

20

at a minimum we believe states should have a right to

21

ensure a reasonable effort to determine viability and in

22

this area we are not telling the physician what kind of

23

test to require, we are not even requiring him to use

24

these tests and have them to be determinative of

25

viability.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES FRIED

7

9

Very well, General

Mr. Fried?

6

8

I would reserve the balance of my time.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. FRIED:

Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and

may it please the court.

Today the United States asks

10

this court to reconsider and overrule its decision in

11

Roe v. Wade.

12

clear how limited that submission is.

13

asking the Court to unravel the fabric of unenumerated

14

and privacy rights which this court has woven in cases

15

like Meyer and Pierce and Moore and Griswold.

16

we are asking the Court to pull this one thread.

17

the reason is well stated by this Court in Harris and

18

McRae; abortion is different.

19

At the outset, I would like to make quite
First, we are not

Rather,
And

It involves the purposeful termination, as the

20

Court said, of potential life.

And I would only add

21

that in the minds of many legislators who pass abortion

22

regulation, it is not merely potential life but actual

23

human life.

24

Amendment takes any position on that question, we think

25

it is an utter non sequitur to say that, therefore, the

And though we do not believe that the 14th

1

organized community must also take no position in

2

legislation and may not use such a position as a premise

3

for regulation.
QUESTION:

4

Your position, Mr. Fried, then is

5

that Griswold versus Connecticut is correct and should

6

be retained?

7

MR. FRIED:

8

QUESTION:

9

Exactly, Your Honor.
Is that because there is a

fundamental right involved in that case?
MR. FRIED:

10

In Griswold against Connecticut,

11

there was a right which was well established in a whole

12

fabric of quite concrete matters, quite concrete.

13

It involved not an abstraction such as the

14

right to control one's body, an abstraction such as the

15

right to be let alone, it involved quite concrete

16

intrusions into the details of marital intimacy.

17

that was emphasized by the Court and is a very important

18

aspect of the Court's decision.

19

And

Does the case stand for the

QUESTION:

20

proposition that there is a right to determine whether

21

to procreate?
MR. FRIED:

22

23

that proposition.

24
25

Griswold surely does not stand for

QUESTION:

What is the right involved in

Griswold?

1

MR. FRIED:

2

QUESTION:

3

I beg your pardon?
What is the right involved in

Griswold?

4

MR. FRIED:

The right involved in Griswold as

5

the court clearly stated was the right not to have the

6

state intrude into, in a very violent way, into the

7

details, inguire into the details of marital intimacy.

8

There was a great deal of talk about inquiry into the

9

marital bedroom and I think that is a very different

10

story from what we have here.

11

QUESTION:

12

Do you say there is no fundamental

right to decide whether to have a child or not?

13

MR. FRIED:

14

QUESTION:

15

I think that that question —
A right to procreate?

Do you deny

that the Constitution protects that right?

16

MR. FRIED:

I would hesitate to formulate the

17

right in such abstract terms and I think the Court prior

18

to Roe v. Wade quite prudently also avoided such

19

sweeping generalities.

20

Griswold.

21

QUESTION:

That was the wisdom of

Do you think that the state has the

22

right to, if in a future century we had a serious

23

overpopulation problem, has a right to require women to

24

have abortions after so many children?

25

MR. FRIED:

I surely do not.

That would be

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

quite a different matter.

2

QUESTION:

What do you rest that on?

3

MR. FRIED:

Because unlike abortion, which

4

involves the purposeful termination of future life, that

5

would involve not preventing an operation, but violently

6

taking hands on, laying hands on a woman and submitting

7

her to an operation and a whole constellation —
QUESTION:

8

9

And you would rest that on

substantive due process protection?

10

MR. FRIED:

11

QUESTION:

12

Absolutely.
How do you define the liberty

interests of the woman in that connection?

13

MR. FRIED:

The liberty interest against a

14

seizure would be involved.

15

analyzed the matter in Griswold.

16

Harland analyzed the matter in his dissent in Poe v.

17

Ullman which is, in some sense, the root of this area of

18

law.

19
20

21

QUESTION:

That is how the Court
That is how Justice

How do you define the interest —

the liberty interest of a woman in an abortion case?
MR. FRIED:

Well, I would think that there are

22

liberty interests involved in terms perhaps of the

23

contraceptive interest, but there is an interest at all

24

points, however the interest of the woman is defined, at

25

all points it is an interest which is matched by the
22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

state's interest in potential life.
QUESTION:

2

3

I understand it is matched but I

want to know how you define it?

4

MR. FRIED:

I would define it in terms of the

5

concrete impositions on the woman which so offended the

6

court in Griswold and which are not present in the Roe

7

situation.
Finally, I would like to make quite clear that

8

9

in our view, if Roe were overruled, this Court would

10

have to continue to police the far outer boundaries of

11

abortion regulation under a due process rational basis

12

test and that that test is muscular enough, as Chief

13

Justice Rehnquist said in his dissent in Roe, to strike

14

down any regulation which did not make adequate

15

provision —

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Fried do I correctly read what

17

your brief says at page 12, footnote 9, that Griswold is

18

a Fourth Amendment case?

19

MR. FRIED:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. FRIED:

Is, I beg your pardon?
Is a Fourth Amendment case?
It is a case which draws on the

22

Fourth Amendment.

23

case.

24

emphasize that the Court would have ample power under

25

our submission to strike down any regulation which did

It is not itself a Fourth Amendment

It is a 14th Amendment case.

But I would like to

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

not make proper provision for cases where the life of

2

the mother was at risk.

3

I think the important thing to realize is that

4

when Roe was decided, it swept off the table regulations

5

in the majority of American jurisdictions, including

6

regulations recently promulgated by the American Law

7

Institute, and declared a principle which said that it

8

was unfair and unreasonable to regulate abortion in ways

9

that most western countries still do regulate abortion.
We are not here today suggesting that the

10

11

Court would, therefore, allow extreme and extravagant

12

and bloodthirsty regulations and that it would lack the

13

power to strike those down if they were presented to

14

it.

15

government institutions —

16

But it is a mistake to think that alone, among

QUESTION:

Mr. Fried, is there a difference

17

between the court's power in the case of an abortion

18

that would be life threatening to the woman and an

19

abortion that would merely cause her severe and

20

prolonged disease?

21

difference?

22

Is there a constitutional

MR. FRIED:

I think that is a matter of degree

23

and it is perfectly clear that severe health effects

24

shade over into a threat to the life and I cannot

25

promise the court that our submission would dispense the
24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Federal courts from considering matters like that, but I

2

also very much doubt that the Court would be presented

3

with many such situations.

4

What is necessary is for the Court to return

5

to legislatures an opportunity in some substantial way

6

to express their preference, which the Court says they

7

may express, for normal childbirth over abortion, and

8

Roe v. Wade stands as a significant barrier to that.

9

QUESTION:

Does your submission suggest that a

10

public hospital, in a state that permits abortion, could

11

not allow abortions?

12

MR. FRIED:

It is quite clear that a public

13

hospital may under this court's decision in Maher and in

14

Harris and McRae, may do as Missouri has here done and

15

say that public funds cannot be expended.

16

QUESTION:

Suppose there is a state that

17

permits abortions and they are done in public

18

hospitals.

19

is human life involved, that is destroyed in abortions?

20

Is there some problem about the state permitting

21

abortions?

22

Do you think that is a — you say that there

MR. FRIED:

Oh, no, I think there is not.

As

23

I have indicated, I think the Constitution takes no

24

position on this point.

25

some of the provisions which say that there should be,

There is a certain logic in

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

that there should be protection further back.

2

country's experience and the court's experience under

3

the constitutionalization of that issue has been so

4

regrettable that I could not in conscious recommend that

5

it be constitutionalized in some other way at another

6

point in the spectrum.

7

But the

Now, if the Court does not in this case in its

8

prudence decide to reconsider Roe, I would ask at least

9

that it say nothing here that would further entrench

10

this decision as a secure premise for reasoning in

11

future cases.
On the issue of stare decisis, it seems

How can — can you derive it that way here

MR. SUSMAN:

It is very hard to say it just

MR. SUSMAN:

The conclusion to which it leads

me is that when you have an issue that is so divisive

do you bend over backwards to accommodate that

He says it just applies to appropriation committees and
funding agencies, they shall not set up a program; and
that a physician — he says this, if we agree with it,
this is how I understood him — if a physician should
give such advice, that would not violate this section.
That is what he says.

If that's true, why haven't you

MR. SUSMAN:

If his interpretation is correct,

then I think it remains almost a total mystery as to
what this section does mean or how it will be applied.
QUESTION:

It just applies to fiscal officers

who are drafting programs on how to spend state money.
They just should not adopt a program advocating abortion
and if that's all it means, I don't see how it can be
unconstitutional.
MR. SUSMAN:

I would agree, but when I read

the section and I read the two that follow, that's not
what it says to me.

But I agree with you.

the section a fiscal officer when he approves a program
has to make sure that there are directives issued that

definition of when human life begins, which they have,

14

clearly there is nothing to prevent a second state from

QUESTION:

So this is unique to Roe?

4

MR. SUSMAN:

I think this is somewhat unique.

5

I think the adoption of Section 205, first of all, it

6

clearly is not necessary in order to requlate abortion

7

or to grant property rights or tort rights to fetuses.

8

It is not necessary to have that proposition to do so.

9

Other states have clearly done so without making these

10

types of purported legislative findings.
And, therefore, if it is totally unnecessary

11
12

to do that, which we maintain that it is, then what they

13

really have done is to adopt a particular religious

14

belief about which there is clearly no consensus and

15

placed it into the law of the land of the state of

16

Missouri.

17

It really does serve no purpose.
I would point out that the Solicitor General

18

in its brief agrees that the impact of this on abortion

19

is quite uncertain at page 8 at footnote 5, does not

20

quite buy entirely the state's position that this has no

21

impact whatsoever.

22

The lower courts address mainly in the point

23

of impact as to whether or not the additional clause,

24

the additional section that says anything we do here

25

must be subject to the supremacy clause, to the
