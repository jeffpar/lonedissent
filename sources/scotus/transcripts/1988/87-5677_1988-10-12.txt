ORAL ARGUMENT OF KIMBALL R. ANDERSON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. ANDERSON:

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court.

I am here today to urge that the

11

Court apply the plain statement rule of Michigan v. Long

12

to Federal habeas review of state court convictions

13

under 28 USC Sec. 2254.
I suggest that if a state court plainly relies

14
15

on a procedural default, then Federal habeas review

16

should ordinarily be foreclosed, absent cause and

17

prejudice.

18

On the other hand, if, as in this case, the

19

state court is ambiguous or obscure concerning whether

20

it relied on the procedural default, then I suggest that

21

that ambiguity should be resolved in favor of preserving

22

the Federal issue for habeas review.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Anderson --

24

QUESTION:

Do you think that -- excuse me.

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Anderson, if the state court
3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

opinion says there has been a procedural default here

2

and we need not reach this question, nonetheless, you

3

know, for guidance, or whatever, then they go ahead and

4

express an opinion on it -- how does that come out under

5

your rule?
MR. ANDERSON:

6

Well, this Court has said on

7

several occasions that merely noting a procedural

8

default is not the same as actually relying on the

9

procedural default.

Oftentimes state courts -- and

10

indeed, in Illinois, the state court will note a

11

procedural default but then go on to excuse it, and

12

consider and dispose of the case on the merit.

13

QUESTION:

And that is your view, as to how

14

this ought to be handled too?
MR. ANDERSON:

15

Yes.

My view is that absent a

16

plain statement clearly invoking the procedural default,

17

as opposed to merely noting it, that absent a plain

18

statement invoking the default and finding the issue

19

waived, then the Federal issue that's been discussed by

20

the appellate court ought to be preserved for review by

21

the

22

QUESTION:

So in order to rely on procedural

23

default, the state court opinion must say nothing about

24

the merits of the question?

25

MR. ANDERSON:

Oh, no.

In order to -- the

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

rule would be the same as this Court has articulated in

2

Michigan v. Long, and also in the context of a

3

procedural default that Caldwell v. Mississippi.

4

If the state court plainly relies on a

5

procedural default, then that would foreclose --

6

QUESTION:

Alone.

7

QUESTION:

But -- okay.

8

MR. ANDERSON:

9

they -- yes.

Alone.
So --

No, not necessarily alone.

If

If they do that, then Federal habeas

10

review is foreclosed absent cause and prejudice, even if

11

they go on to discuss the Federal issue in dicta.

12

QUESTION:

Okay.

13

QUESTION:

So if the Court says, we have two

14

reasons here for decision: one, a procedural default,

15

two, you haven't got anything on the merits anyway.
MR. ANDERSON:

16
17

That's correct, Your Honor.

And that is --

18

QUESTION:

Then what?

19

MR. ANDERSON:

Then what?

Well, that's the circumstances

20

that arises occasionally where you have alternative

21

reliance.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

Well, there's no question if they

say they are relying on the procedural default.
MR. ANDERSON:

And in that instance, habeas

--the Sykes test would apply, habeas review would be
5

foreclosed absent cause and prejudice.

2
3

QUESTION:
is it?

MR. ANDERSON:

4
5

course,

6

rule has --

7

8
9

That isn't quite Michigan v. Long,

Well, Michigan v. Long, of

is a direct review case, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

I know.

And the

But you say you're -- you

want the Michigan v. Long rule.
MR. ANDERSON:

That is the rule in Michigan v.

10

Long, Your Honor, as I understand it.

11

in Caldwell v. Mississippi, that if the State Court, if

12

the highest Court of the State plainly relies on a

13

procedural default, then that will preclude direct

14

review by the Supreme Court, regardless of whether the

15

State Court also discusses the merits of a Federal issue.

1§

QUESTION:

It's also applied

You mean Caldwell would obtain

17

reversal for you here, because the Illinois Appellate

18

Court did not say anything about procedural default in

19

its opinion?

20

MR. ANDERSON:

It noted the procedural

21

default, but instead of invoking the default and finding

22

the issue waived, Your Honor, the Court went on to

23

address the merits of Mr. Harris'

24

of counsel claim.

25

QUESTION:

ineffective assistance

Well, how does a court invoke the
6

ALDERSOIM REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

procedural default in its opinion?
MR. ANDERSON:

2

Well, any number of ways, but I

3

suggest that the same rules that would govern in

4

Michigan v. Long would govern here, and there the Court

5

has, has said that a simple statement that the Court

6

finds a matter waived or barred because of procedural

7

default would suffice.
The Court said that that claims statement rule

8
9

would serve interests of comity and uniformity and in

10

the systemic interests, and I suggest that all of those

11

policy considerations are equally well-served here in

12

the context of habeas review.

13

would afford due respect to a decision by a state court

14

to plainly invoke its procedural rules.
QUESTION:

15

The plain statement rule

And you say that it ought to be the

16

plain statement by the appellate court, the federal

17

court shouldn't try to imagine whether they relied on it

18

or not? They should say, they should, just an objective

19

test --

20

MR. ANDERSON:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

I'm sorry?

-- (inaudible) the opinion of the

appellate court?
MR. ANDERSON:

Precisely Your Honor, and for

24

all of the good reasons that were articulated in

25

Michigan v. Long.
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

This ad hoc method of guessing at, at what the

2

appellate court meant lends itself to error.

3

disserves the comity interest, and I think the --

4

QUESTION:

It

It makes a lot of sense where you

5

have a written appellate court decision, but what do you

6

do, I mean, a lot of state appellate courts that, that

7

have mandatory appeals don't write full opinions.

8

most of them, they just say "appeal denied."

9

MR. ANDERSON:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. ANDERSON:

12

Yes.

Sometimes it --

Right.
Sometimes this issue does arise

in the context of summary --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. ANDERSON:

15

QUESTION:

Suppose you have --- affirmants.

Right.

And suppose you have a

16

lower court opinion that rested its decision on

17

procedural default.

18

MR. ANDERSON:

19

QUESTION:

20

In

Well --

And all that the appellate court

says is appeal denied.

21

MR. ANDERSON:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. ANDERSON:

Yeah.

What, what obtains there?
Well, the plain statement rule

24

should be applied in the context of summary affirmances,

25

because here's the danger that's going to arise if you
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

don't.

You have a case where the procedural default is,

2

is, let's say, questionable, both as a matter of state

3

law and as the facts.

4

Constitutional issue.

You also have an arguable

5

The prosecutor argues on appeal that the,

6

makes a very weak claim that the procedural default

7

should be invoked.

8

his strong Constitutional error ought to be reviewed,

9

and then the appellate court just summarily affirms

10

The defendant argues on appeal that

without a decision.

11

The danger of not applying the plain statement

12

rule in that context is that the state court, you may be

13

in one of those States like Illinois where procedural

14

defaults are excused, and here we've got a busy Court

15

that has not taken the time to articulate its real

16

intent.

17

procedural default, because that's a weaker questionable

18

argument, and rely on the merits.

19

the Federal -- and then the plain statement rule is not

20

applied, the federal court runs the risk of guessing

21

incorrectly about the meaning or the intent of the state

22

court.

It -- its real intent may be to excuse the, the

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. ANDERSON:

25

QUESTION:

If that happened, and

How about -And that kind of --

How about the second part of
9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Justice Scalia's (inaudible), maybe you're coming to

2

that, the Illinois appellate court rests its decisions

3

solely on procedural fault, appeal to, leave to appeal

4

to the Supreme Court denied without opinion.
MR. ANDERSON:

5

Well, if leave to appeal is

6

denied, then there, then there's really -- it's like

7

denial of certiorari.

8

So I think then you would look at the appellate court

9

decision --

There's really been no opinion.

10

QUESTION:

Illinois?

11

MR. ANDERSON:

Yes, and you'd look to see

12

whether the appellate court had plainly relied on the

13

procedural default.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Anderson, in this case, the

15

Illinois Court said that, except for the alibi

16

witnesses, all the matters raised in the Petitioner's

17

ineffectiveness claim could have been raised on direct

18

appeal.

19

merits, the alibi witness question.

And then it went on, and dealt with, on the

Now, in all fairness, shouldn't that be read

20
21

as, as procedurally barring everything but the alibi

22

witnesses?

23

MR. ANDERSON:

Well, in fairness, that is a

24

reasonable interpretation of the decision, but I would

25

point out that reasonable minds have disagreed all the
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

way up through here.

2

below who have disagreed concerning the meaning of the

3

decision.

4

that the Appellate Court had intended to excuse the

5

waiver issue, because the Appellate Court discusses not

6

only the alibi witness issue, but also some of the other

7

ineffective assistance of counsel claim issues that Mr.

8

Harris had raised.

9

We've had four Federal judges

As you know, the District Court concluded

Two judges in the Seventh Circuit Court of

10

Appeals also said that the order was ambiguous, but they

11

-- and then they tried to ascertain the intent of the

12

Court, and they disagreed with the District Court.

13

And then we have Judge Cudahy, who wrote a

14

concurring opinion, and he said: Gee, the order is

15

ambiguous, and I don't think we ought to be trying to

18

divine the unspoken intent.

17

So I think that the, the best evidence,

18

really, that this, that this order is a good candidate

19

for the plain statement rule is the fact that we've now

20

had four lower judges below who have been unable to

21

agree at the meaning of it.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. ANDERSON:

24
25

And of course the parties --

Well, maybe --- have spent a lot of time

briefing it as well.
QUESTION:

Maybe on Federal habeas, our
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Federalism concerns are somewhat greater than on direct

2

review, so that we could give the benefit of the doubt

3

to the state's position of, of procedural bar.
MR. ANDERSON:

4

Well, the plain statement rule

5

certainly is not going to preclude the state courts from

6

invoking or applying a procedural rule.

7

plain statement rule really does is provide the lower

8

Federal courts with guidance concerning whether or not

9

to afford habeas review when the state courts have been

10

So, all the

obscure.
QUESTION:

11

Yes, but are the considerations on

12

Federal habeas any different at all than on direct

13

review, do you think?

14

for the Federal courts to reach out and decide these

15

cases?

16

MR. ANDERSON:

I mean, should we be less eager

I think that, Your Honor, in

17

the context of habeas review, the Court has noted that

18

its jurisdiction is really broader than on direct

19

review, and I think you also have to keep in mind the

20

historic office of the great writ here, in that it is

21

the ultimate protection against un-Constitutional

22

detention, and this Court has noted that a procedural

23

default does not bar a habeas court from, from

24

exercising jurisdiction and, and affording review.

25

So I think that all of the reasons that Your
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Honor articulated in Michigan v. Long apply with equal,

2

if not greater, force here in the habeas context, in

3

terms of promoting uniformity, in terms of promoting

4

comity, and protecting the systemic interests that were

5

articulated in Wainwright.

6

QUESTION:

What -- what is, on what basis does

7

a Federal court refuse habeas corpus when there's been a

8

procedural default that the state court relies on?

9

MR. ANDERSON:

Well, as Justice Rehnquist

10

wrote in Wainwright v. Sykes, comity interest would

11

ordinarily preclude a court from affording habeas review

12

if there has been an adequate and independent state

13

grounds for the state court's decision.

14

And that rule was explained in terms of

15

affording proper due respect for the decision of the

16

state courts to enforce their procedural rules.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

But this is a, this is a court made

consideration, I take it?
MR. ANDERSON:

It is a court made

20

consideration. I'm sure Your Honor is familiar with the

21

history of it. In Fay v. Noia, the Court said that

22

absent a deliberate bypass, Federal habeas review would

23

be allowed.

24

States and Fay v. Henderson, which began developing this

25

cause and prejudice test, and then the Court finally

And then we have the Daniels v. United

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

adopted the cause and prejudice test in Wainwright v.

2

Sykes, emphasizing the, the systemic interest of

3

finality and efficiency and the comity interests of --

4

QUESTION:

So Federal habeas is really, as has

5

been suggested, is a different kettle of fish than a

6

directed review, I suppose?

7

presumption in favor of the, in an ambiguous situation,

8

a presumption in favor of the state grounds?

9

MR. ANDERSON:

Why shouldn't there be a

Well, for all of the reasons

10

that we discussed.

11

have a presumption in favor of default, for example, you

12

are not going to give the appropriate, the respect that

13

is due when, for example, a state court without being

14

clear decides not to apply its procedural rules.

15

state court decides not to invoke its procedural rules,

16

and instead to reach the merits of a Federal issue, it

17

has necessarily made a determination that the policies

18

underpinning its procedural rules aren't worthy of

19

indication in that particular case.

20

In part because if you have, if you

When a

And a Federal court, I think, ought to give

21

proper respect for that determination as well as the

22

determination to invoke the rules where appropriate.

23

QUESTION:

Well, in the ambiguous case, the

24

State Court hasn't said that.

25

do you know whether they relied on it or not?

The State Court is, how

-- in our instance what they

intended.
QUESTION:

They just want lawyers to know what

the Federal rule is.
MR. ANDERSON:

Maybe, but maybe they thought

15

that their procedures -- the policies underpinning their

16

procedural rules didn't merit the vindication given the

17

important issues in this case, and the importance of

18

this particular issue to this particular defendant.

19

You don't know, and the danger of presuming in

20

favor of default is that you're going to guess wrong,

21

and the danger --

22

QUESTION:

This argument, your argument now

23

sounds like even if the state court relies solely on

24

procedural default in a particular case, the habeas, the

25

habeas corpus court should sit and entertain the claim
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

if it finds that there has been an uneven application of

2

procedural default.
MR. ANDERSON:

3
4

No, I haven't said that at all,

Your Honor .

5

QUESTION:

Well, you did.

6

MR. ANDERSON:

Not here today or on the

7

briefs.

I said that if the state court plainly relies

8

on the procedural default as the basis for its decision

9
10
11

QUESTION:

Regardless of whether it does it

every day or not?

12

MR. ANDERSON:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

Correct.

Isn't part of the problem with

adopting an ambiguity rule?

It's not a clear line rule.

I'm helping you -- don't -- I mean, if you

16

could tell me how that could be a clear line rule, I'll

17

be happy to rule against you.

18

whether it's ambiguous until you inquire into state law.

19

MR. ANDERSON:

20

QUESTION:

But you don't know

That's right.

You have to inquire into what the

21

State law procedure is.

22

MR. ANDERSON:

23

QUESTION:

That's right --

You really don't know that there's

24

an ambiguity until you've made the Federal habeas court

25

conduct an inquiry into state procedural law.

5

MR. ANDERSON:

Which, as this Court said in

Michigan v. Long, was not a good procedure.
QUESTION:

But we usually rely on the court of

appeals judges to tell us what state law is.
MR. ANDERSON:

Yes, but there are going to be

6

instances where the state court hasn't told you, they've

7

been obscure as to the whether or not there is a

8

procedural default, either legally or factually in the

9

context, and the danger of presuming in favor of default

10

in those instances, as I said, is that important

11

individual rights may be lost simply because the state

12

court judge was obscure about his intent.

13

when you're dealing with individual liberty, that kind

14

of ambiguity or obscurity just should not be tolerated,

15

should not block Federal review of the habeas issue.

16

And I think

And I think that this Court -- if you look at

17

the Court's decisions in this area over the years,

18

you've seen the rule developed in the direct review

19

cases, of about the plain statement rule, but you've

20

also seen the rule develop in the habeas cases that if

21

the state court has disposed of the Federal issue, then

22

the Federal courts have an unflagging duty to resolve or

23

to review the correctness of the state court's decision

24

on the Federal issue.

25

Going back, way back to Brown v. Allen -17
ALDERSOIM REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Brown v. Allen said that if there's an adequate and

2

independent State grounds, then habeas review is going

3

to be foreclosed.

4

exceptions to that, and one of those exceptions is right

5

on point here. In Brown v. Allen, they said, well, if

6

the state court indicates that state collateral review

7

is permissible despite a procedural default, then the

8

Federal court can afford habeas review of the Federal

9

issue that has been disposed of by the state court in

10
11

But they went on to give some

the state collateral proceeding.
That's really what we have here.

We have, we

12

have a situation where the state court indicated that

13

state collateral review may be permissible.

14

Court disposed of Mr. Harris' ineffective assistance

15

claim on the merits, and then we get up in the appellate

16

QUESTION:

The Circuit

Mr. Anderson, may I ask you a

22

question about your reliance on Michigan v. Long?

23

Generally speaking, not exclusively, the Michigan v.

24

Long line of cases deal with situations in which the

25

state is contending that the state courts have given
18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

more protection to a Federal Constitutional claim than

2

the Constitution actually warrants.
In the habeas situation, it's the exact

3
4

reverse. Typically the defendant is claiming that he was

5

deprived of protection the Constitution would provide

6

him.

7

and which way does it cut?

Do you think that distinction has any significance

MR. ANDERSON:

8
9

I don't think it has a

significance, because I would call Your Honors'

10

attention to the fact that that Michigan -- although

11

that was the context of Michigan v. Long, that plain

12

statement rule has been applied subsequently in a

13

procedural default case, in Caldwell v. Mississippi,

14

where the defendant failed to, failed to raise his

15

Constitutional issue on appeal, and his conviction was

16

affirmed.

17

Court, which raised the issue sua sponte, split four to

18

four over it, and then it went to this Court on

19

certiorari, and I, I think Justice Marshall was writing

20

for the majority..

21

And then it went to the Mississippi Supreme

He made it very clear there that the mere

22

existence of a procedural bar is not going to foreclose

23

this Court's direct review jurisdiction.

24

contrary, the state court actually had to have relied

25

upon the procedural bar before this Court will decline

On the

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

jurisdiction.
So I think, Your Honor is right.

2
3

context of Michigan v. Long.

4

gone the other way in subsequent cases.

5

think the distinction is important.

That was the

But I think it is,

it's

So I don't

I do think that all of the reasons for the

6
7

application of the plain statement rule in the context

8

of direct review apply equally well in the habeas

9

context,

10

in the context of habeas review.
QUESTION:

Well, in the Caldwell case, we

11

found that the State Court's ruling was not ambiguous,

12

and that they had not invoked the procedural bar.

13

MR. ANDERSON:

That's true.

14

The defendant had --

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. ANDERSON:

17

QUESTION:

So the --- defaulted --

So the inference, that, or the

18

language in the opinion that procedural bars are treated

19

the same way as state substantive grounds was really

20

unnecessary to that decision?

21

22
23

MR. ANDERSON:

I'm not following you there,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

In Caldwell, we found that the

24

State Supreme Court's order was clear, and that it had

25

not relied on the state procedural ground.
20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

MR. ANDERSON:

1

As I recall, the Court in

2

Caldwell said that the reference to the waiver issue in

3

the prevailing opinion is somewhat cryptic, but then

4

went on to note that the Michigan Supreme Court had

5

requested briefs on the Constitutional issue, had

6

requested oral argument, and had in fact attempted to

7

decide it, four to four.
So I can't agree with Your Honor that the

8
9

decision was crystal clear, because Justice Marshall did

10

note that the Mississippi Supreme Court had referred to

11

the waiver issue, and that the Court's reference, as he

12

put it, was "somewhat cryptic."
QUESTION:

13

Well, assuming that we made a clear

14

holding, that procedural grounds are subject to the

15

Michigan Long, v. Long rule in direct review cases, if

16

we apply it in the context of a habeas proceeding, I

17

assume that in most of the cases such as Justice Scalia

18

puts, where there is simply a one-line order affirmed,

19

we won't need cause and prejudice anymore because we

20

simply rely on a presumption that procedural bar was not

21

invoked?

22

MR. ANDERSON:

Well, I have urged in my

23

briefs, and here today, that you don't adopt that

24

presumption because that presumption is contrary to the

25

rationale set forth in Michigan v. Long, and it also
21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

runs the risk that the Federal District Court is simply

2

going to guess wrong at the meaning of the State Court,

3

and fundamental rights will be lost simply because the

4

State Court's opinion was obscured.

5

QUESTION:

Well, you mention the Illinois

6

practice, really as an empirical matter.

7

that most state courts respect their procedural bar

8

rules. They're designed to tell the state courts that

9

these are not litigatible issues --

10

MR. ANDERSON:

11

QUESTION:

12
13

I should think

I have no --

-- and you're asking us to presume

the opposite.
MR. ANDERSON:

Oh, no.

Oh, no.

I have no

14

quarrel with that as a general proposition, Your Honor.

15

Illinois State, Illinois State Courts as a general rule

16

do invoke their procedural default rules.

17

instances where they also excuse them, and you see the

18

most frequent, that arises most frequently in the

19

context that we're here today in, namely, cases under

20

our Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act.

21

But there are

If, if you look at our reply brief, we list a

22

number of cases where cases arising under the Illinois

23

Post-Conviction Act have excused a procedural default,

24

particularly when, when ineffective assistance of

25

counsel is at issue.
22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

And all I'm saying is, if the, if the state

1

2

court wants to foreclose Federal review, all they have

3

to do is plainly rely on and invoke the procedural

4

default.
On the other hand, if they're going to be

5

6

ambiguous about it, then in order to preserve the

7

vitality of the great writ, and to protect the comity

8

and systemic interests, you've got to preserve the

9

Federal issue for review by the Federal court.
QUESTION:

10

And that is not -- or is it based

11

on an inference that the state court probably did ignore

12

the procedural bar?

13

MR. ANDERSON:

14

QUESTION:

15

It's --

Or is that just irrelevant, as far

as you're concerned?
MR. ANDERSON:

16

Well, you just can't tell, and

17

when you can't tell, all of the policy reasons we've

18

discussed, I think, in the context of habeas, even more

19

so than direct review compel preservation of the Federal

20

issue for Federal review.

make an inference one way or the other.

22

you'll be able to make an inference.

23

won't.

I'm not saying you have to
In some cases,

Some cases you

In this case, there are several reasonable
inferences that you can make from the order, but it
23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

still boils down to the fact that you're guessing at

2

what the appellate court really intended to do.

3

saying when you're guessing in the context of individual

4

liberty, it's -- it's a dangerous game to play, and it's

5

the wrong game to play.

6

QUESTION:

And I'm

Well, Mr. Anderson, speaking of the

7

Illinois practice, it wouldn't be a matter of presuming

8

that they've ignored the bar, but rather because of the

9

broad exception in the Illinois Post Conviction Act for

10

a case of fundamental unfairness, that they think

11

there's enough substance to the claim alleged in the

12

petition that they are concerned that it might meet that

13

test, and in the case of doubt, they go ahead and decide

14

it on the merit.

15

16

But I don't think it's -- you're really
arguing they were simply unaware of the procedural bar?

17

MR. ANDERSON:

18

QUESTION:

Oh, no --

They just don't think it might

19

apply, given the allegations of Federal Constitutional

20

violations.

Absolutely.

We'll hear now from you, Mr. Shuff.

3

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT V. SHUFF, JR.

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SHUFF:

5

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

6

please the Court.

The Respondents here respectfully

7

submit that when a state court opinion is unclear

8

whether it rests on adequate and independent state

9

grounds or the merits of a Federal Constitutional claim,

10

that that ambiguity should be resolved in favor of the

11

state grounds, so that habeas review is unavailable,

12

absent the showing of cause and prejudice.
In effect, we're asking that this Court form a

13
14

presumption that the state courts have followed their

15

own procedural rules, and therefore an adequate and

16

independent state grounds exists in such cases.
There are strong cases, strong interests of

17
18

both the states and public which make this presumption

19

desirable.

20

Constitutional considerations, under our Federal system,

21

the interests of comity, which allows us the fair

22

opportunity to review, allows us a degree of finality,

23

reduces our states' ability to -- I'm sorry, increases

24

our states' ability to decide our own future, and to

25

bring order to our criminal justice --

These interests are grounded in

MR. SHUFF:

That's correct.

2

The Federal claim should be decided that it is

3

barred.

4

favor of the State Courts' following their rules.

5

Finality is one of the main reasons that we propose

6

this. Habeas is after all a collateral attack, not like

7

the direct appeal.

8

already further removed from the direct appeal, from the

9

trial, from what should be, as this Court has stated,

10
11

The Respondent's proposal is a presumption in

When it's a collateral attack, it is

the main event.
It allows the state to have order, and that

12

order allows us to punish criminals, and that that

13

ability to punish criminals allows us to have the rule

14

of law and order, and the rule of law and order allows

15

us to guarantee the individual liberties by the use of

16

the great writ of habeas corpus.

17

The role of the trial cannot be

18

overemphasized. If we lose or obscure evidence by a

19

review after review after review, the state's ability to

20

protect the integrity of that trial is in fact, in many

21

cases, lost.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Shuff, I'm -- I happen to think

23

that the silliest thing to spend a lot of time

24

litigating about, and for judges to have to spend a lot

25

of time inquiring into, is, is whether they have
27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

jurisdiction, that the jurisdictional issues ought to be

2

clear.

3

Now, Mr. Anderson has given us a clear line.

4

You can tell right away -- you look at the opinion of

5

the State Court.

6

holding or as, as a sole holding, "we rely on the

7

procedural default,"

8

it doesn't say that, there's Federal jurisdiction; if it

9

does say it there isn't.

10

11
12

If it says, either as an alternative

that's the end of the matter.

What clear line do you give us?

You say where

it's ambiguous. How do I know when it's ambiguous?
MR. SHUFF:

Well, I would submit that it would

13

be ambiguous if it didn't say "we rely solely on the

14

State ground."

15

QUESTION:

I don't have anything except a

16

court of appeals, a state court of appeals order that

17

says: affirmed.

18

If

That's all I have.

MR. SHUFF:

In that instance, Your Honor, we

19

would suggest that the Court assume that the State

20

followed its rules and if the state followed its rules

21

and procedural default was argued, that it would be a

22

matter of procedural default, and habeas would not lie.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Well, I'd have to look to see

whether procedural default was argued?
MR. SHUFF:

Right?

Under that circumstances, you

MR. SHUFF:

QUESTION:

Well -I just don't consider that a very

14

clear line.

I don't like to -- to, you know, I'd much

15

rather have Federal judges figuring out what Federal law

16

is, than figuring out what the State procedural law is.

17

That seems to me an utterly useless exercise for Federal

18

judges to engage in.

19

MR. SHUFF:

Well, it is not a, a useless

20

exercise when you look to some of the ideas such as

21

comity and what the burden is in the habeas on the

22

States.

23

If you look at the, the habeas practice in

24

Illinois, for example, 300 cases a year, you then think

25

about how you, how you would apply this rule to 300

cases.

That is not a great number of cases, but is a

2

significant number of cases, and the burden to the

3

States -- you should look at it possibly back that way,

4

rather than the burden on the Federal court looking at

5

that question.

one that is systemic.

11

13

sorry, this is in their reply brief -- they have -- "We

have found that there is in fact a default, but we are

15

choosing to waive that default and go to the merits."

16

The cases, for example, that are

That was a very small number of cases.

QUESTION:

Instead of that, you want to have

MR. SHUFF:

QUESTION:

MR. SHUFF:

I'm sorry.
Yes.
That's a class where you have a

6

procedural default and you're talking of possibly of

7

something like incompetency of counsel or misconduct of

8

the judiciary, because when you take those through the

9

Illinois system, you're going to go up two different

10

lines: either on direct appeal, where you talk about a

11

plain error, or a, a post conviction proceeding where

12

you're talking about a fundamental fairness.

13

you then come to the habeas review, if the Court were to

which those questions would be decided.

MR. SHUFF:

1

Well, there's a post conviction

2

direct appeal route, okay, and there we have a rule of

3

plain error, okay, which is simply almost a one, a

4

one-step rule.

5

on a post conviction proceeding, which is the normal

6

place where matters off the record in the direct appeal

7

would be brought if they raise a Constitutional claim.
And those rules are different than the rule

10

And then we have a fundamental fairness

that you would obtain in a habeas case, if in fact you
granted the habeas under the proposed rule.
QUESTION:

11

But what difference does that -- I

12

think the Chief Justice's question is, is not going to

13

the, to that point, the effect of a habeas decision.

14

It's going to the question of whether there's some

15

category of case where it would be difficult or

impossible for the state court to say "procedural

default."

Is there any?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KIMBALL R. ANDERSON

MR. ANDERSON:

16

My opponent argues that there should be a

presumption that the State Courts have followed their

procedural rules.

19

with that, but the presumption should recognize that the

20

State Courts, in following their procedural rules,

21

sometimes invoke procedural default and sometimes excuse

22

it.

23

that fact.

24
25

I certainly don't have any quarrel

I think the plain statement rule would recognize

My opponents also argue that there should be a
presumption in procedural default whenever there's

11

And now my opponents are arguing basically for

12

the reverse presumption in the context of habeas review,

13

but have identified no good reasons that I've heard here

14

today

15

QUESTION:

Well, I take it, I take it then

16

that your position, the state would never be able to,

should never be allowed to raise procedural default in

MR. ANDERSON:

default was ever made in the state courts --

MR. ANDERSON:

Well, I think that -- I think

that's settled, Your Honor, and that was -- that was,

4

that was settled in the County Court of Ulster case, and

MR. ANDERSON:

9

So the answer is the state may not

That's right.

It's not -- it

cannot be raised in the first instance in the Federal

10

court, because the state court didn't give any

11

indication that, that its review of the Federal issue

12

was barred because of the procedural default, and I

13

think Justice Stevens said in County Court of Ulster

14

that if a state court doesn't indicate that, that review

15

of the Federal issue is precluded by the state's

16

procedural bar, then the Federal Court certainly implies

17

no disrespect for the state courts by entertaining the

18

issue.

19

My opponents also say that the cause and

20

prejudice rule provides some kind of safety net here,

21

but the cause and prejudice test was never intended as a

22

safety net for obscure state court opinions.

There is

23

certainly no authority for that proposition.

In

24

Wainwright v. Sykes, the Court didn't charge ahead to

25

determine whether or not there was cause and prejudice.

1

Instead, they first, the Court first addressed in detail

2

whether or not there was in fact an adequate and

3

independent State grounds for the state court decision.

4

You don't just jump over that and rely on the,

5

rely on the, rely on the cause of prejudice test as some

6

kind of safety net here.

7

Finally, I think that maybe I should conclude

8

with an analogy to a baseball rule, since I know noted

9

the Court's reliance on baseball precedent this morning,

10

and since we are approaching the seventh game of the

11

National League series tonight.

12

context of direct review that a tie between the

15

procedural default and the Federal issue goes to the

16

Federal issue.

It's settled in

I think it's equally settled in the

17

And now, I think, what we have here is the

18

state is trying to change the rules of the ball game

19

just because we're here on habeas review instead of

20

direct review.

21

briefs, there really isn't any different -- there isn't

22

any good reason to treat ambiguity in the context of

23

direct review any differently than in habeas review.
