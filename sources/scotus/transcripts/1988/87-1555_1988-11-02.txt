ORAL ARGUMENT OF DICK THORNBURGH

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

11

MR. THORNBURGH:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:

12

This is a case about railway safety, about the

13

need to protect railroad employees, the traveling public

14

and the communities through which railroads travel from

15

the hazards created by the use of drugs and alcohol by

16

those in charge of trains, and from the risks posed by

17

their impairment.

18

The case involves the legality of

testing for the presence of drugs and alcohol among

19

railroad employees while on duty and, in particular,

20

subsequent to certain types of railroad accidents.

21

The American railroad industry and its

22

employees have a long history of safety regulation by

23

government, beginning with the Safety Appliance Act in

24

1893 running through the Comprehensive Railway Safety

25

Act of 1970 and thereafter.

Regulation of rolling

1

stock, equipment, track and signals and employees has

2

been authorized to protect fellow employees, citizens

3

and communities throughout the United States.

4

The Hours of Service Act in 1907 was the first

5

legislation to deal with employees by imposing limits on

6

the number of hours that they could work.

7

legislation, as noted by this Court in language we

8

suggest to be equally applicable here, was -- and I

9

quote -- "induced by reason of the many casualties in

10

railroad transportation which resulted from requiring

11

the discharge of arduous duties by tired and exhausted

12

men whose power of service and energy had been so

13

weakened by overwork as to render them inattentive to

14

duty or incapable of discharging the responsible labors

15

That

of their positions."

16

The 1970 Act --

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General -- Mr.

18

Attorney General, does that legislation and those

19

regulations prohibit the use of alcohol by railroad

20

employees?
MR. THORNBURGH:

21

22
23
24
25

The 1907 Act did not deal

with that problem, and I would propose to walk us
through briefly, as briefly as I can, what led up to
what I submit is an authority to carry out that kind of
testing

No, I'm not asking about the

2

testing.

3

employees forbidden to use alcohol the night before they

4

get on -- they go to work?
MR. THORNBURGH:

5

6

I mean, just -- are -- are -- are railroad

They are, indeed, by

operating rules adopted by nearly all railroads, Rule G,

7

which states forth -- sets forth in no uncertain terms

8

the prohibition against working or showing up for work

9
10

under the influence of alcohol or drugs and provides for
dismissal in those cases.
QUESTION:

11
12

What is the period of time between

arrival at work and the last time they can have alcohol?

Adopt the statement by Mr.

Justice Marshall.

It would include all in the

I

can't answer that because --

I'm not sure, Your Honor.

Yes.

Not just those charged with running

the train.
MR. THORNBURGH:

Well, specifically and most

importantly those charged with running the train.
QUESTION:

But the others as well.

MR. THORNBURGH:

That's my understanding.

Firemen.

There's no firemen

That sort of thing.
QUESTION:

13

Yes, brakeman, fireman, yes.

But do we take it as a given in the

14

case that the regulation covers some employees that are

not engaged in safety-sensitive tasks?

all of those employees are engaged in safety-sensitive
tasks?

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

QUESTION:

I'm not sure I followed this.

you're saying the regulation does not cover dining car
employees, not the prohibition on use of alcohol.
You're saying the testing regulation doesn't cover that.
MR. THORNBURGH:

Rule G and the regulations here at issue operate.

Are they covered?

Pullman car employees.

Well, they're on the train.

MR. THORNBURGH:

Well, the thrust and the

focus of this regulation and the regulatory scheme that
has been generally promulgated with regard to railroad
employees relates to those employees that have a clear
and palpable relationship to the safety of the protected
persons, fellow employees, traveling public, citizens
and communities around it.
I am not going to palm myself off on this
Court as an expert upon where that line is drawn because
I think the essence of the argument that the government
is making here on behalf of the Federal Railway
Administration is that what has been promulgated meets
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the needs of protecting those designated classes of

2

persons.
I would agree in the premise that underlies

3
4

the questions that if there is a spare category out

5

there that has no relationship whatsoever to the safety

6

of those individuals or classes of persons, that it

7

would be an overreaching.

8

such a category, however.
QUESTION:

14

I am not aware that there is

No.

I —

You just say you don't think it

does -MR. THORNBURGH:

Again, with respect to those

employees, there might be a -- a question.
QUESTION:

I think that's part of your

opponent's argument, that it's broader than necessary
even on your own rationale.
MR. THORNBURGH:

Well, I think when you look

at the regulation in its gross operation -- and again, I
-- I don't want to represent to this Court that there
may not be somewhere out there an employee or two or
category that has -- with respect to which Your Honor's
concerns might be justified.

What I am saying is that

9

1

given the extensive review process that was undertaken

2

in the promulgation of this legislation by those who are

3

far more expert than I and most of this Court probably

4

in the categories that have a direct relationship to

5

safety, I know of no such group that is -- with respect

6

there may be an overreaching taking place.
QUESTION:

7

Is any such group pointed out in

8

your opponent's briefs, do you recall?

9

it.

10

12
13

I guess we can ask them.
MR. THORNBURGH:

QUESTION:

General Thornburgh, as long as

you're interrupted, may I change the focus of the -MR. THORNBURGH:

I don't, but I suspect that

my opponent will scour his brief for such a designation.

I don't recall

Certainly.

-- questioning a minute to inquire

about what happens to the reports that are received
after the drug testing?

For instance, would the FRA

turn them over to police for any criminal negligence
prosecutions? What happens to -- to the evidence that is
gathered in these drug tests?
MR. THORNBURGH:

They could be used in either

civil or criminal proceedings.

There is no bar under

the statute.
QUESTION:

Does that raise any concerns under

this Court's holding in Schmerber that the evidence
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

gathered after the crash is turned over for a subsequent

2

criminal prosecution?

3

MR. THORNBURGH:

I don't think so because what

4

you're dealing with here is not some ruse to carry on a

5

criminal investigation under the guise of an

6

administrative proceeding, but a set of regulations that

7

has an independent rationale and an independent basis

8

for carrying out the responsibilities of the Federal

9

Railway Administration to investigate accidents and to

10

enforce the rules that are promulgated against drug and

11

alcohol abuse.

12

QUESTION:

Well, is the purpose to discipline

13

the employee involved and get them out of the business

14

of operating a dangerous instrumentality while under the

15

influence of drugs?

16

MR. THORNBURGH:

That is one of a number of

17

purposes that are identified in the regulations deriving

18

their authority from the Railway Safety Act.

19

QUESTION:

How would it affect that goal if

20

there were some prohibition against turning the evidence

21

over to the police for criminal prosecution?

22
23
24
25

MR. THORNBURGH:

I don't know that it

necessarily would, Your Honor, because the purpose and
focus of the FRA, as Your Honor suggests, is toward the
safety portion of the Act which obviously would be
11
ALDERSOIM REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

enhanced by removing or in some cases rehabilitating

through programs that the railroads carry out those

3

employees who have drug and alcohol problems.

undertaking that --

QUESTION:

10

It is not

But in any event --- law enforcement criminal

But as this particular program is

designed, there are no restrictions on turning the
evidence over to the police I take it.

11

MR. THORNBURGH:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. THORNBURGH:

No, there aren't.

Okay.
And my suggestion is that

14

that is a concern that is not before the Court in this

15

case if the Court accepts the designation that has been

16

adopted all the way through of the concern about railway

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

safety, which doesn't necessarily turn upon the civil or
criminal exposure of any individual using, abusing or
being under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
I would like to turn to the basis for the
Federal Railway Administration's adoption for these
regulations because I think it etches the severity of
the problem in a way that indicates the reasonableness
of the response.
In the hearings held with respect to these
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

regulations, or what culminated in these regulations,

2

the FRA found that alcohol and drug impairment had

3

contributed to a number of accidents and fatalities.

4

From 1975 to 1983, at least 45 train accidents and

5

incidents that involved some 34 fatalities, 66 non-fatal

6

injuries, and $28 million in property damage.

They further noted that these figures were
likely to be understated due to what they identified as
a conspiracy of silence resulting from the fear of
employees to come forward on account of their concern
about tort liability or the loss of the job if accurate
reporting was forthcoming.
All of this existed -- these conditions and
these difficulties -- despite the existence for decades
of operating Rule G referred to before which literally
prohibits employees from using, possessing or being
under the influence of drugs or alcohol while on duty
and subjecting them to dismissal for violation.
The procedures adopted are two in number:
mandatory on all railroads, and the other optional.

23

periodic random testing procedures.

I

think it's significant to note that the regulations did

They were tied

instead to specific events and particular groups of
employees, both defined by objective standards.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

Subpart C mandates the taking of blood and

2

urine samples from covered employees in three instances:

3

first, following a major train accident, that is, one

involving a fatality, the release of hazardous material

5

accompanied by evacuation or a reportable injury, or

6
7

8
9
10

damage to railroad property exceeding a half a million
dollars; secondly, an impact accident resulting in a
reportable injury or damages to railroad property
exceeding $50,000; and third, a fatality to an on-duty
railroad employee.
The samples are to be taken as soon as

11
12

possible at an independent medical facility and

13

subjected to laboratory analysis using state of the art

14

methods.

months.
QUESTION:

Now, Mr. Attorney General, I gather

there have to be both a blood test and a urine test.
MR. THORNBURGH:

That's under Subpart C

required, yes.
QUESTION:

Well, what does the urine test

produce in the way of information that you don't get
from the blood test?

Why do you need both?

MR. THORNBURGH:

The urine tests act as a

propensity to reach back over a period of up to 30 days

indicated.

And if the urine test produces

nothing, you still give the blood test.

is the test?

MR. THORNBURGH:

No, it would not be.

And I think the point about these tests is

they have to be viewed in the context of the totality of

case where drug or alcohol abuse shows up in one or more
of the covered employees, then further investigation and
the accumulation of observations that may have been made
contemporaneously would be suggested. But as in any case
where evidence is divined to produce a conclusion, the
process is uncertain and cumulative in its nature.

Subpart -- the other subpart of the

2

regulations is a -- it permits the railroad to do more

3

than required in Part C and involves other mixes of

4

urine, breath and -- and blood tests.
These regulations, as the Court knows, were

5

6

sought to be enjoined.

The district court granted

7

summary judgment denying same, and the Ninth Circuit

8

Court of Appeals reversed.

That brings us here today.

And I would like, if the Court please, to move

9
10

to a discussion of what we suggest are the relevant

11

questions of constitutional law that are involved here.
Under the Fourth Amendment, the rights of

12
13

people to be secure in their persons against

14

unreasonable searches and seizures is not to be

15
16
17

25

violated.

In the normal criminal investigation case,

both probable cause and a warrant are generally
necessary to render a search reasonable.

In certain

criminal and most non-criminal cases, neither is
required or has been required by this Court.
The circuit court found neither to be
necessary here.

And we would urge the same finding on

this Court; that is, this is not a case where probable
cause or a warrant are necessary.
This Court in determining the reasonableness
of searches and seizures has adopted a balancing test

which requires balancing the intrusion of the
individual's Fourth Amendment interests against the
promotion of legitimate governmental interests.

The

court of appeals did not apply such a test.
It found instead that the procedures set forth
in the regulations were deficient because they failed to

7

require a particularized suspicion as a trigger for the

8

testing procedures offering the observation -- and I

quote -- that "accidents, incidents, or rule violations
by themselves do not create reasonable grounds for
suspecting the tests will demonstrate alcohol or drug
impairment in any one railroad employee much less an
entire train crew," a conclusion which we submit assumes
much of what is in issue.
The circuit court reached this conclusion
because of its mistaken premise that finding a search
justified at its inception requires a determination that
there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the
search will turn up the evidence sought.

The court, in

short, failed to undertake the balancing test because it
presumed the need for a particularized suspicion.
This Court has stated that the Fourth
Amendment protects only an expectation of privacy that
society is prepared to considerable reasonable and that
what is reasonable depends upon the context within which
20

such a search takes place.

2

resolution of those balancing questions.

3

I would like to move to that

New Jersey v. T.L.O. emphasizes that

4

exceptions to the requirement of individualized

5

suspicion relied upon by the Ninth Circuit may be made

6

-- and I quote, "where the privacy interests implicated

7

by a search are minimal and where other safeguards are

8
9
10
11

available to assure that the individual's reasonable
expectation of privacy is not subject to the discretion
of the officer in the field."
In applying this test here, first, it's

12

readily apparent that the search authorized by the

13

regulations at issue manifestly takes place in an

14

atmosphere of diminished expectations of the privacy of

15
16
17

24

the employee. They take place in the context of an
ongoing employment relationship, circumscribed by
longstanding concern for the employee's mental and
physical wellbeing.

They take place during employment

in an historically highly regulated industry, and they
take place in an industry which has a history of
imposing health and fitness requirements, including in
some cases the taking of blood and urine samples and
testing similar to that prescribed here.

is forthcoming on the part of the individual employee,
must look at the characteristics of the employment
relationship and of the history of the regulation of
that relationship, not just the industry, but of that
relationship, for whose ever benefit that may be.
The other safeguards in the test from T.L.O.
that are available is that the testing is not of a
random kind or is it subject to the discretion of
supervisors who might target or harass particular
employees, but is triggered by objective events and, in
the case of Subpart C, is required of all covered
employees involved in the incident in question.
testing must take place as soon as possible at an

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE M. MANN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. MANN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The purpose of the regulations cannot be
complied with under the scheme that's devised in the
federal regulation because -- and I read -- "the purpose
of this part is to prevent accidents and casualties in
railroad operations that result from impairment of
employees by alcohol or drugs."
The record is clear that neither the alcohol

nor the drug test by urine nor by blood can demonstrate

2

impairment.

3

of a drug that's in the system.

4

in the regulation itself, the Federal Railroad

5

Administration recognizes that in some cases it can

6

remain in the system up to 60 days.

A urine test only can show the metabolites
And in the -- indeed,

Now, we have no problems in the railroad

7

8

unions that one who is using alcohol or drugs should not

9

be working in the railroad system.

That's not the issue

10

here.

The issue is whether or not one in his sole

11

privacy of their homes 60 days ago on a vacation may

12

have used drugs -- I'm not suggesting that we condone

13

it, but the mere fact that they used drugs does not in

14

any way have any nexus that while that employee is

15

working that he or she may have used drugs on the job

16

because the tests don't demonstrate it.
QUESTION:

17

Do you assert that a blood test

18

cannot show current extent of impairment from alcohol or

19

drugs?

In the drug area, it can show an

Well, there is one case, Your

Honor, the Rushton case, that the Court held that that
