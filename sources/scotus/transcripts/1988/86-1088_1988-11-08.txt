ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Canton, Ohio is a relatively small city in the

13

Northeastern part of the State of Ohio whose fame

14

heretofore has been based largely on William McKinley

15

and the professional football hall of fame.

16

Unfortunately, unfortunately today we have a

17

new reason for fame, you're right, Mr. Chief Justice.

18

It is before this Court because the Sixth Circuit has

19

ordered it to face a new trial under 42 USC Section 1983

20

for failure to provide adequate medical care to a

21

detainee in the city's jails.

22

The legal issue in this case, one this Court

23

has confronted somewhat often in recent years,

24

what circumstances the city is liable for the

25

Constitution torts committed by its employees?
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

is under

The case arises out of the arrest of the

1

2

Respondent, Mrs. Geraldine Harris, on April 26th, 1978.

3

Mrs. Harris was stopped for speeding by a Canton police

4

officer.

5

There is no question that the stop at that

6

time was a perfectly lawful act by the city.

7

upset by her sense that others around her were also

8

speeding, she became quite agitated and refused to

9

provide the police officer with information necessary to

10
11

Apparently

allow him to fill out his ticket.
Consistent with the standard practice in the

12

State of Ohio and the City of Canton at the time, the

13

officer decided that the best response was to place Mrs.

14

Harris under arrest and to have her transported to the

15

police station in the hopes that she might calm down and

16

provide the officers with the necessary information.

17

And there's never been any challenge to the

18

lawfulness of the city's action in having Mrs. Harris

19

brought to the police station at that time.

20

Mrs. Harris became quite agitated, as a

21

consequence of this decision, and apparently became

22

unable to walk without assistance.

23

assisted by two police officers into a patrol wagon and

24

taken to the police station.

25

She was therefore

At the station Mrs. Harris was asked about her
4

1

medical condition, whether she had a medical condition,

2

whether she needed any medicine.

3

that question, as well as' all other questions that were

4

provided to Mrs. Harris, was that she wanted to see her

5

son, Ronny, and she wanted to see him immediately.

And her response to

6

The reason Mrs. Harris was asked that question

7

is that the City of Canton has a specific written policy

8

which provides that the officer who's assigned as the

9

jailer "shall when a prisoner is found unconscious or

10

semi-conscious or when he or she is unable to explain

11

his or her condition, or who complains of being ill, has

12

such person taken to a hospital for medical treatment,

13

with the permission of a supervisor before admitting a

14

person to the city jail."

15

Although Mrs. Harris' behavior was extreme

16

under the circumstances, the testimony is undisputed

17

that it was not uncommon for inmates to become

18

hysterical as a consequence of being brought to the

19

police station, especially if they'd never been there

20

previously.

21

For that reason the decision was made that the

22

best course of action was simply to try to find Mrs.

23

Harris' son and have him brought to the police station

24

as quickly as possible.

25

Because Mrs. Harris refused to sit in a seat

1

in the police station at the time, or was unable to --

2

it's not clear exactly what the circumstances were --

3

she was placed into a cell until her son was able to

4

arrive within 20 to 30 minutes and to arrange for Mrs.

5

Harris' release.
QUESTION:

6

Is there anything in the record

7

that anybody at any time nad the vaguest thought of

8

taking her to a hospital?
MR. PHILLIPS:

9

Yes.

There is a direct

10

testimony on a number of instances that the immediate

11

question was, did she require medical assistance and was

12

she ill?

13

QUESTION:

I mean, that they asked her.

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

They asked her that to see

15

whether that, which is one of the things that you're

16

supposed to do under regulations.

17

QUESTION:

What I'm asking is did they -- they

18

could have taken her to the hospital without her

19

consent, couldn't they?

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, they could take her to

21

the hospital.

Of course, they could not require her to

22

submit to the medical treatment without her consent.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

They could?
They could not require her to

submit to medical treatment without her consent.

I'm trying to --

Couldn't they have taken her

without her consent?
MR. PHILLIPS:

They couldn't have taken her

without her consent because she was in custody.
But there are two parts to the answer to your

20

question, Justice Marshall.

The first part is that

21

their first reaction was to ask her whether she needed

22

medical assistance.

23

The second part of the answer was that there

24

was testimony from the head jailer that if Mrs. Harris

25

was likely to remain in the jail for much longer he was,
7

1

he was at a point in time where he was thinking about

2

sending her to the hospital.

3

son would be coming almost immediately.

But he believed that her

So it wasn't even in this case a situation

4
5

where somebody said, I'm going to completely ignore Mrs.

6

Harris' condition.

They took into account the

possibility of sending her to the hospital, and decided
8

that under the regulation, and under the circumstances

9

of the case, the better course of action was to allow

10

her to remain there until her son was able to arrive.
QUESTION:

11

Mr. Phillips, in the posture that

12

we have to consider the case, are we concerned only with

13

the liability of the city?

14

that the jail supervisor violated this woman's

15

Constitutional rights?
MR. PHILLIPS:

16

And do we take it as a given

Yes.

In the posture of this

17

case, we have to assume that there was deliberate

18

indifference by someone.
The testimony that I cited didn't happen to be

19

20

But in the posture of the case, you're

QUESTION:

Well, we, we assume, for purposes

of deciding this, that there was some deliberate

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

indifference and a violation of her Constitutional

2

rights.

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's correct.

That's

4

accepted for purposes of this argument, Justice

5

0'Connor.
QUESTION:

6

Can a failure on the part of the

7

city to adequately train its personnel ever amount to a

8

violation of the Constitution, Mr. Phillips?
MR. PHILLIPS:

9

Well, I would say it is

10

counter-intuitive, and as the plurality opinion

11

indicated in Oklahoma City, almost difficult to accept

12

as a submission that someone has a policy of inadequate

13

training.
And so I would think it almost inconceivable

14
15

that a policy of inadequate training exists in a way

16

that would make it -QUESTION:

17

But here there was a clear policy

18

that the city had adopted, to the effect that if someone

19

in these circumstances needs medical attention they're

20

to take them to the hospital.
MR. PHILLIPS:

21

22

Right?

That's absolutely correct,

Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION:

custom?

25

liability?

So, what do we have left?

I mean, what are we dealing with on the city's

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

MR. PHILLIPS:

1

Well, the Respondents — it

2

depends on who you ask and at what point in time, I

3

suspect.
If you ask the Sixth Circuit what we're

4
5

dealing with here, the Sixth Circuit identifies the

6

policy as delegating discretion to police officers

7

without providing adequate training.
Now Respondents in this Court don't really

8
9

defend the Sixth Circuit's policy, the policy it

10

recognized, the delegating discretion, I think in large

11

measure because of this Court's decision last term in

12

Praprotnik .
Respondents now are saying that there is a

13
14

"policy of inadequate training" that has given rise in

15

some respect to the injury in the particular case.
QUESTION:

16
17

In the sense of a custom, or a

practice?
MR. PHILLIPS:

18

They also argue in the

19

alternative that there is a custom at issue in this

20

case.

21

As we suggest in our brief that it's not

22

clear, frankly, that the issue of custom has been

23

preserved up to this point.

24

did not hold that there was any kind of a custom in this

25

case, and we would submit that there is certainly no

The Sixth Circuit certainly

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

evidence from which one could infer the existence of a

2

custom.

3

Respondents' only evidence on the issue of

4

custom is a single statement by a single police officer,

5

not a policymaker, that he personally in situations of

6

dealing with emotionally-disturbed would wait until the

7

person appeared to be a threat to herself, him or

8

herself, before he would be obliged to take that person

9

to the hospital.

10

That is the only evidence.

There is no

11

indication in the record of this case of anyone ever

12

being denied medical care, either for emotional or

13

medical or physical injuries.

14

Indeed, the testimony of the chief of police

15

in office in 1978 when the incident took place was that

16

he had never even been, he had never received even a

17

complaint about a failure to provide medical assistance

18

in this case.

19

Under those circumstances, I don't think

20

there's any basis frankly for saying that there is such

21

a subtle custom of depriving people of medical care

22

within the community, that it could be regarded as law

23

for the City of Canton.

24
25

QUESTION:

Going back just one step, is there

any evidence in the record from which a tryer of fact
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

could infer deliberate indifference on the part of the

2

individual officers?

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Personally, I would have been

4

in a position to argue that a directed, I would have

5

argued that a directed verdict was appropriate in this

6

case, frankly.

7

But we didn't, we didn't win that, and we

8

didn't preserve it on appeal, and therefore we had to

9

take it as a given that there was deliberate

10
11
12
13

indifference.
But if you ask me for a personal judgment on
the record, I'd say no, there is no evidence.
QUESTION:

Again backing up just one moment,

14

is there any evidence that the woman was abused?

15

she struck or pushed?

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

Was

She testified to the effect

17

that she was struck, pushed, and the jury found against

18

her on all of those claims.

19

20
21

QUESTION:

Were there special findings,

special verdicts?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

So that it's clear that

22

there was, that at least with respect to the assessment

23

of this record in this case, on all elements, save for

24

the provision of medical care, the city has acted

25

perfectly reasonably, and in no way -- I mean the city
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

and all of its

2

QUESTION:

Do we infer that just because the

3

officers were found non-liable?

4

findings that the woman was not mistreated?
MR. PHILLIPS:

5

6

Or were there specific

No, that they were found

non-liable.
But I take it, at least, it's going to be

7

8

difficult in a -- I mean, the argument of the defense at

9

trial was that none of those acts were committed.

It

10

was not so much that they had a qualified immunity to

11

abuse her .

12

And, in fact, there were common law tort

13

actions brought, and all of those were rejected, and so

14

there wouldn't have been a qualified immunity for those

15

common law tort actions.

16

Therefore, I think the inference is

17

inescapable that what the jury found was that this woman

18

was in no way abused as a consequence of her actions,

19

and a consequence of that particular arrest.

20

At the end of the trial, after Mrs. Harris had

21

sued her arresting officer, the officer who is the

22

backup officer, the person who drove the patrol wagon,

23

the assistant jailer, the head jailer, the chief of

24

police, and the mayor of the city, and including the

25

City of Canton itself, the jury rejected all of the
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

findings against all of the defendants except for the

2

one against the City of Canton.
And the one against the City of Canton

3
4

involved exclusively the question of whether the city

'5

failed to provide her with adequate medical assistance

6

during the period of her detention.

7

was awarded $200,000.
Now, that award was set aside by the Sixth

8
9

And for that she

Circuit because there was clearly an improper

10

instruction given to the jury with respect to the

11

liability of the city.
The Sixth Circuit, however, went ahead and

12

13

remanded the case for a new trial on the basis that

14

liability could properly be found in this case "on the

15

fact that the police had an established policy of

16

allowing shift commanders unfettered discretion to make

17

the decision to refer a prisoner to the hospital based

18

on their personal judgment and perception coupled with

19

the fact that these commanders were given no training or

20

guidelines for making this decision."

21

It is that holding which is at issue in this

22

case, although as I indicated a moment ago Respondents

23

essentially have abandoned defense of that specific

24

holding.

25

They do not argue that the policy of
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

conferring the discretion is the "policy" for purposes

2

of liability under Section 1983.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, just, the portion of

4

the instruction that the Sixth Circuit felt was proper,

5

not the part that reversed that, who submitted that?

6

Did you agree to that, the city?

7

to that?
MR. PHILLIPS:

8
9

The city objected to that,

Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

10
11

Or did the city object

different one.

They did.

But they also objected to one --

MR. PHILLIPS:

12

I know they submitted a

And we objected to the

13

instruction as given, as a glorified version of

14

respondeat superior.

15

that we preserve the jury instruction issue in this

16

case .

17

So I don't think there's any doubt

Looking at the holding of the Sixth Circuit,

18

vis-a-vis this Court's decisions in Monell and its

19

progeny interpreting --

20

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

22

QUESTION:

42 USC Section 1983 --

Mr. Phillips, you confuse me with

23

saying that there were two, two bases and they've

24

abandoned the one.

25

I took, I took them to be two parts of a
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

single basis for the lower court's assessment of

2

liability.

3

not have been a violation unless you are conferring

4

discretion upon the people that you fail to train.

5

That is to say, the failure to train would

It would be okay not to train the supervisors,

6

if it isn't ultimately their decision, if they have a

7

guidebook that says you do this, this, and this.

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

The basis for my inference

9

about the submission of the Respondents -- obviously I'd

10

be in a better position to clarify that point -- is that

11

if you look at the specific evidence that they identify

12

on the issue of whether there was a policy within the

13

meaning of Monell that could give rise to liability

14

here, they don't say anything about conferring

15

discretion at that point.

16

The only evidence they turn to was the

17

evidence of the chief of police, although I should note

18

that that was the chief of police in 1980 as opposed to

19

1978 when the events took place, but his evidence to the

20

effect that they did not have additional training or any

21

specific training with respect to emotional injuries.

22

I inferred from that they are not really

23

supporting particularly the specific basis of the Court,

24

and I assumed that on the basis of what this Court said

25

in Praprotnik that you cannot identify as an actionable
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

policy under 1983 the decision to confer discretion upon

2

employees.

3

policy, and that policy they style as inadequate

4

training.

5

So they've now gone in search of a new

Again, I say Respondents are certainly in a

6

position to argue to the contrary.

7

would be, take it as either the conferring of discretion

8

or inadequate training, it doesn't get you any further

9

than the policy of inadequate training in any event,

10

since conferring discretion is a necessary function.

11

QUESTION:

My position here

Let me pursue that just a second.

12

Would you say that it would never violate, be a policy

13

of a city conferred discretion to make arrests and

14

interrogate people, do everything the police do on a

15

person who was totally untrained?

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

17
18
19

20

You mean, can, the conferring

of discretion on someone who's not trained?
QUESTION:

Can that, could that constitute a

policy that would be actionable?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think that the problem

21

with analyzing it that way, Justice Stevens, is that the

22

1983 isn't concerned with, with who makes decisions, or

23

even how well trained those individuals are.

24

Section 1983 is concerned with whether there's

25

been a violation of someone's Constitutional rights, and
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

under what circumstances the city should be
responsible.
QUESTION:

Well, of course, you have to

assume, I mean to take it a step further, that if one
calls it a policy, that the policy is one that
foreseeably led to the violation of someone's
Constitutional rights.
For example, if you took a bunch of
9

ex-convicts and said, we'll make you the police officers

10

from now on, it might be fairly predictable that

11

somebody's rights would be violated.
MR. PHILLIPS:

12

But see, I think the flaw, I

13

mean the problem in that hypothetical is not the

14

conferring of discretion.

15

clear inference that the policy of the city is to act in

16

deliberate disregard of the individual's Constitutional

17

rights.

18

It is what ultimately is the

And so I think to look at what the basis for

19

the decision on training and the conferring of

20

discretion does is take you away from looking at the

21

real issue in the case, and that is has the city's

22

fathers or the policymakers of the city decided that we

23

don't care about the Constitutional rights of individual

24

citizens within our community.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Now, it may well be that the

2

action is evidence of that kind of a policy, but the

3

hypothetical you pose is certainly a very extreme one.

4

QUESTION:

Well, what if the policy was to

5

save money, they don't want to spend unnecessary money,

6

and they hire the lowest-paid police officers they could

7

find, who happened also to have no training in areas

8

that police officers are normally trained in?

9

that -- and then say they predictably, a Constitutional

10
11

Could

violation ensues.
Could you say, could you characterize that as

12

a policy of giving discretion to people who are not

13

trained to carry out their duties?

14
15
16

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think that's an inappropriate

policy to examine.
I think what you say is that that is a policy

17

of manifest indifference, deliberate indifference to the

18

Constitutional rights of the citizens, that the

19

assumption underlying a process by which you decide to

20

put those people out on the streets is that they will in

21

fact violate Constitutional rights.

22

And when they do in fact violate

23

Constitutional rights that that's really taken pursuant

24

to the authorization inherent in what the, in what the

25

policymakers did.
19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (2021 628-9300

1

I think that's a better way to analyze that

2

question than to focus on the issue of whether the

3

policy of inadequate training and policy of conferring

4

discretion are problematic in a particular case.

5

QUESTION:

But the reason you say it would be

6

a violation is because it is so clearly foreseeable that

7

Constitutional violations would result, as I understood

8

your response.

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think -- I think that

10

you might find a circumstance where you could infer from

11

that deliberate indifference.

12

My basic position here is, is that, Justice

13

Stevens, the hypothetical you pose is not a realistic

14

one, for the simple reason that no community is going to

15

go out and seek to find the lowest common denominator

16

person to protect them.

17

The average citizens of the community are not

18

going to accept that kind of situation.

19

you're just not going to have the situation where you

20

free up the prisons and make them, police officers --

21

QUESTION:

And therefore

Well, perhaps my example is an

22

extreme one.

But I don't think it's totally implausible

23

to suggest that there are in fact, there have in fact

24

been untrained police officers who've been given such

25

responsibilities.
20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

MR. PHILLIPS:

1

But a specific instance of an

2

untrained police officer being given responsibility

3

seems to me an inappropriate basis for inferring that

4

the city has a policy of deliberate indifference toward

5

Constitutional rights.
And that's why I get back to the point that

6
7

that's the reason you have to analyze it in terms of the

8

city's policy with respect to the violation of

9

Constitutional rights, because the hypothetical you pose

10

is never going to happen in real life.
And it seems to me inappropriate to focus on

11
12

inadequate training and conferring of discretion, which

13

are absolutely unquestioned appropriate decisions by

14

policymakers to deal with a one in a billion likelihood

15

that somebody would act in the way that you've

16

described.

17

It seems to me it's much more sensible to

18

analyze the case across the generality of situations and

19

to focus on the protection of the Constitutional rights

20

themselves, rather than trying to make Section 1983 into

21

a statute designed to provide uniform training for all

22

municipalities and counties throughout the United

23

States, which I think there's no evidence that 1983 was

24

ever intended to be.

25

QUESTION:

Do you agree, Mr. Phillips, that if

1

the city officials take steps or act in a way that would

2

support an inference of deliberate indifference to

people's Constitutional rights, that could be described

Could you infer that policy from

Yes.

Please, go ahead.
You wouldn't -- I don't think

you can find that from a single incident.
For instance in this case, did the city act to

22

provide additional training for medical determinations?

24

No, it didn't.

So you could say there's a failure to

concerns?

that.

I think absolutely not.

There's no basis for

19

Suppose guns are

where the holster is, and that's it.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Kennedy, I'm sort of

20

reminded of the old television program, Mayberry R.F.D.,

21

or whatever, where the, where you have a single sheriff

22

and he has a gun, and the question is, is the city under

23

all circumstances required to provide a certain minimum

24

amount of 400 hours of training in that kind of a

25

situation, where there's no reason in the world to
23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

\

believe that the person's ever going to need to use that
gun, there has never been any instance where a gun has
ever been drawn in the past.
And I don't think that -- I think the problem
with looking at this as a training case is that what
you're saying is that every community has to face up to
this problem and provide a certain amount of training,
even when it isn't — it may be foreseeable in the
abstract sense, but it's very unlikely.
QUESTION:

Suppose with a particular

community, it's reasonably foreseeable that lack of
training would lead to serious violations of
Constitutional rights?
MR. PHILLIPS:

I think that that, that the

foreseeability standard is an inappropriate one under
Section 1983.

You're talking about the policies of the

city —
QUESTION:

Without reference to what city it

is.
MR. PHILLIPS:
it is.

Without reference to what city

I think you have to have a different causal link

between the policy of the city that you identify and the
injury that ultimately arises out of that.
The Court said in Praprotnik last term that
you cannot use simple proximate cause standards when
24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

you're dealing with Section 1983.

2

something more.

3

There's got to be

You have to find that it is pursuant to, that

4

it is the moving force, that it an affirmative link.

5

And I don't think that foreseeability is a sufficient

6

standard to satisfy all of those, to satisfy any of

7

those descriptions of what causation is required under

8

Section 1983.

9

QUESTION:

Well, maybe you shouldn't have

10

bought on to gross indifference then.

11

you can measure gross indifference without measuring the

12

foreseeability.

13

I don't know how

I mean, whenever you say you're grossly

14

indifferent it depends upon how certain it is that

15

something will happen if you don't do something else.

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

17

QUESTION:

But I — Justice --

It seems to me you cannot embrace

18

gross indifference as a standard and at the same time

19

reject foreseeability --

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think that you can reject

21

mere foreseeability as tantamount to gross

22

indifference.

23

If it is unforeseeable it clearly isn't

24

grossly indifferent.

But I don't think it follows that

25

simply because something is foreseeable and you don't
25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

take action in response to that, that you act with gross

2

indifference.
I'll go back to my hypothetical involving a

3
4

small community that has a single sheriff.

In that

5

situation it certainly may be foreseeable that some

6

incident will arise in a local high school where the

7

police officer suddenly pulls out his gun and starts to

8

shoot.

That may happen.

9

But what I submit to you is that 400 hours of

10

training and the refusal to provide that to that police

11

officer is not a gross indifference to the

12

Constitutional rights of those high school students.

13

one anticipated that that would happen.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

No

Mr. Phillips, my question earlier

was deliberate indifference.
Now, maybe there's, it's fine shades of nuance

17

between gross indifference and deliberate indifference.

18

Deliberate always to me has connoted an element of

19

recklessness, that comes closer to intent than what

20

might be -- I've never heard the term "gross

21

indifference" used up till now.

22
23

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I was merely going along

with Justice Scalia on that.

24

QUESTION:

You have no choice.

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

My preference frankly -26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

QUESTION:

Whatever.

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

Can I just finish?

My

3

preference, frankly, is deliberate indifference, because

4

I think it even connotes more than simply recklessness.

5

I think what it connotes is some kind of

6

volition, and I think that’s terrible important in

7

situations where you're trying to hold the city liable.
Prosser and Keaton, in their analysis of gross

8
9

negligence and reckless indifference and deliberate

10

indifference, say that gross negligence and recklessness

11

all tend to shade toward the negligence side based on

12

conduct.

13

Deliberate indifference is a standard that

14

tends to provide a certain amount of volition, which I

15

think is again a central element of what should be

16

required as part of the policy prong under Monell.

17
18
19

20

If there are no further questions, I think
I'll reserve the balance of my time.

Thank you, Mr. Phillips.

Rudovsky, we'll hear now from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID RUDOVSKY

22

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

23
24
25

Mr.

MR. RUDOVSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As a threshold matter, I wish to call this
27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Court's attention to the fact that the issue that the

2

city says is properly before this Court, as they say, a

3

failure to train can never amount to a policy, as that

4

term is defined in Monell, is not properly before this

5

Cour t.

6

Not only did the city not appeal from the

7

underlying judgment that there was a 14th amendment

8

violation here in the sense that Mrs. Harris was denied

9

a right to necessary medical care, and the record does

10

support that judgment, but at trial, this case was tried

11

on a simple negligence theory because the city

12

pre-trial, in its pre-trial brief, and I've cited it at

13

page nine of our brief, on the merits, conceded that if

14

the Plaintiff proved that the actions of the city as the

15

result of misfeasance and nonfeasance by failing to

16

adequately train, supervise, or discipline members of

17

the police offices, proximally caused the injury in this

18

case, the city could be held properly liable.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

Mr. Rudovsky, did you make this

point in your brief in opposition to certiorari?
MR. RUDOVSKY:

I personally was not on the

22

case at that point, but in the opposition to certiorari,

23

and I will get to that point, even at the stage of

24

opposition of certiorari, the city's submission on the

25

certiorari petition was not that training can never

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

2

amount to a policy under Monell.
This question submitted, on which this Court

3

granted cert, was whether or not Monell liability could

4

be found where violations of Constitutional rights might

5

foreseeably result from inadequate training.

6

That is, in this petition for certiorari

7

itself, the city reaffirmed the position it took in the

8

trial court that negligence alone could be a basis for

9

finding that a failure to train amounts to a policy

10
11

under Monell.
Not only did the city make that position clear

12

pre-trial, and therefore this case was tried, and the

13

evidence was produced, on a theory of simple negligence,

14

but in the Court of Appeals, in its petition for

15

rehearing before the Court of Appeals, the city stated,

16

and we quoted the page 11 of our brief, in its petition

17

for rehearing, the city says, the majority opinion of

18

the Court of Appeals "quite correctly, in our view,

19

states that grossly inadequate training may be a basis

20

for a city's liability under 42 Section U.S. 1983."

21

So that the position of the city consistently,

22

pre-trial, on appeal in the Court of Appeals, in it's

23

petition for certiorari to this Court, which is why we

24

didn't make the response that would normally be called

25

for under Tuttle, to point out to this Court that the
29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

issue is not properly before it, the city's consistent

2

position is diametrically opposed to what it suggests to

3

this Court today.
Now, the two reasons this Court has

4
5

traditionally given for not deciding issues which are

6

not properly preserved below, both strongly counsel

7

against this Court deciding this case on the submission

8

of the city.
Number one, you have the possibility -- and

9

10

we're not certainly accusing the city of doing it here

11

-- of preserving an is'sue for appeal by suggesting an

12

erroneous legal standard at trial.
They say at trial mere inevidence is

13
14

sufficient, and now they say both the trial court and

15

the Court of Appeals were wrong for adopting that

16

position.

17

themselves suggested that position.

18
19

20

Well, they can't have it, when they

QUESTION:

Did you say this in your opposition

to the petition for cert?
MR. RUDOVSKY:

As I said to Justice White, the

21

opposition, which I did not file, I did not become part

22

of this case until the brief on the merits, that point

23

was not made in the opposition brief, but it was not

24

made, as in Kibbe, the same reason, because the brief

25

for certiorari, the petition for certiorari, itself
30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

expressed this issue in terms of inadequate training,

2

which was the same position as taken by the court below.
Secondly, the city now says that we didn't

3
4

adduce sufficient proof to meet the standard they

5

suggest of, as best I can tell its intentionality, its,

6

we don't state a claim under Monell unless we show that

7

the failure to train was done with the intent to violate

8

citizens' rights.
The city now says that we haven't adduced

9
10

enough proof, if that's the proper standard.

Well, of

11

course we haven't.

12

standard, but this case was tried under a simple

13

negligence theory.

We think the proof could meet that

There was no burden on the Plaintiff at trial,

14
15

given the very position of the city, to adduce proof

16

that would meet deliberate indifference or

17

intentionality.
And so both issues that are supposedly before

18
19

this Court, number one, the question of what standard

20

applies under a failure to train, and the question, the

21

underlying question -- because a new trial has already

22

been granted in this case, the city will have another

23

chance.

24
25

The question of whether there was sufficient
proof to meet whatever standard this Court would
31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

announce controls the question of failure to train, the

2

Plaintiff didn't have a proper opportunity to provide

3

that proof, because we tried it under the theory that

4

the city made.

5

In Tuttle, as Justice White's question

6

suggests, this Court said, properly so.

7

ought to point out to this Court where an issue has not

8

been properly preserved.

9

The Respondent

I've explained why we didn't do that.

This is

10

the fourth time in as many years that this Court has

11

taken a case concerning municipal liability on a city's

12

petition where there have been substantial questions

13

over whether the issue was properly preserved in the

14

lower courts.

15

Tuttle, Praprotnik, Kibbe, and now this case,

16

and indeed Newport, the City of Newport case, had the

17

same problem as well.

18

Respondent, you should point it out.

19

because it wasn't properly posed.

20

It's one thing to say to the
Here we didn't

We think as a corollary to the Tuttle rule a

21

petitioner as an officer of this Court ought to at least

22

in its petition for certiorari point out what might be

23

arguable grounds, and here they were abundant, as to why

24

the issue was not properly preserved.

25

QUESTION:

Do you agree, Mr. Rudovsky, that
32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the questions actually presented and worded in the

2

petition are properly before the Court?

3

MR. RUDOVSKY:

As worded, they are.

But, as

4

worded, as I read it, and it's a little unclear to me

5

exactly what the point was, it seems to repeat this

6

simple negligence question.

7

That is, the city says, in this question

8

presented, is negligence, which is the foreseeability

9

standard that's suggested here, and inadequate training

10
11

sufficient to state municipal liability under Monell.
Well, we think the answer to that is yes,

12

simple negligence is that.

13

they are currently making.

14

But that is not the argument

They are now trying to ratchet up the

15

culpability requirement all the way up to intentionality

16

when throughout this case they have said simple

17

negligence, or at one point under a motion for directed

18

verdict they used the term gross negligence, would be

19

sufficient.

20

QUESTION:

But do you think at least the

21

questions presented in the, as worded in the petition --

22

I know that the wording is somewhat different in the

23

brief -- are properly before the Court?

24
25

Because, your motion, your brief in opposition
did not raise any question about it.
33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
20 F ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

MR. RUDOVSKY:

1

I certainly concede that, and

2

the brief in opposition didn't, I think, for the reason

3

that it appeared that the city was taking the same

4

position in its petition for certiorari that it took in

5

the lower court, that is whether simple negligence, would

6

be sufficient.
That issue is before the Court, and there's

7

8

certainly abundant evidence, as I will get to in a

9

moment, to support the judgment of the Court of Appeals

10

remanding for a new trial on a theory that negligence in

11

terms of training, which foreseeably would raise a risk

12

of a violation of Constitutional rights, and would raise

3

a risk of danger to the public, would be sufficient.

4

Now, this Court has debated the underlying

5

issue in several opinions.

6

Court, all the city properly preserved was that lower

7

threshold issue.
And we think because the facts were not fully

8
9

But as presented to this

developed -QUESTION:

20

Haven't they, haven't'they at least

21

preserved the question of whether inadequate training

22

can ever be a policy or a custom for purposes of

23

Monell?

24
25

Haven't they raised that?
MR. RUDOVSKY:

Not in those terms, because

they have conceded -34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

QUESTION:

1

Well, the question on cert is

2

whether inadequate training can be found to be a policy

3

or a custom within the meaning of Monell.
MR. RUDOVSKY:

4

That's true.

But given their

5

position in the court below, where they expressly

6

conceded, indeed at a petition for rehearing in the

7

Court of Appeals, they expressly conceded that issue.

8

We are -QUESTION:

9

Well, but it seems to me they

10

raised it here and that we can answer that question.

11

Can't we?

12
13
14

QUESTION:

You, you should have raised that in

your motion in opposition.
MR. RUDOVSKY:

We raised it as they did in

15

Kibbe, at the first opportunity where it became clear to

16

us that they are now changing their position.

17

Kibbe was the same situation.

In Kibbe the

18

argument by the Respondent that cert was improperly

19

granted was raised for the first time on the merits

20

brief, because that's the first time it became clear to

21

the Respondent that the petition was changing grounds,

22

and a majority of this Court dismissed cert as

23

improperly granted in Kibbe.

24
25

This is even stronger than Kibbe, because at
least in Kibbe the city had by motion for directed
35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

/

1

verdict preserved, or attempted to preserve that issue

2

in the lower court.
And remember, in Kibbe, when this Court

3
4

dismissed cert, it meant the city was held liable.

5

There wasn't a new trial situation in Kibbe.

6

the judgment of damages was affirmed.

That meant

Here there's going to be a new trial under any

7

And we think that you don't have a full

8

circumstances.

9

record on which to decide, in this case, because of what

10

the city did, this very important question, which has

11

pretty broad ramifications in terms of municipal

12

liability.
If I may, I will turn, however, assuming this

13
14

Court reaches the merits of this case -QUESTION:

15
16
17

We should dismiss as improperly

granted?
MR. RUDOVSKY:

That's correct, Your Honor.

18

For the same reason that the Court did in Kibbe, we

19

think it's —

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. RUDOVSKY:

22

discretionary.

23

you haven't.

And other cases.
And obviously it's

Sometimes you have dismissed, sometimes

24

But we think of the five cases in the past

25

seven years that have raised this issue, this is the

1

strongest case of the clearest change in position by a

2

petitioner from the trial court to this Court.

3

there's no basis on which to hear this particular

4

issue.
QUESTION:

5

And

But the rule you're talking about,

6

is it just a rule of the court that we normally don't

7

hear cases that -- hear issues that weren't presented

8

below?

9
10
11

MR. RUDOVSKY:

It's certainly discretionary in

this Court.
But the factors the Court has pointed to in

12

deciding whether we hear it or whether we don't, Tuttle

13

v. Kibbe for example, Tuttle you heard it, Kibbe you

14

didn't, when you look at those factors they counsel most

15

strongly against hearing this particular case.

16

that's our basic submission on that point.

17

And

But I do want to move to the merits, because

18

the Court certainly can address the merits, and we

19

differ quite sharply with opposing counsel, both on the

20

facts in this case and on the submission we make with

21

respect to the proper legal principle that controls.

22

Two significant facts that have to be kept in

23

mind, because we are arguing both a custom of denying

24

medical care to a certain class of prisoners, and a

25

failure to train police that led to this particular
37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

2

violation.
We're arguing both and we will submit in

3

conclusion that the confluence of those doctrines

4

clearly established municipal liability here.

5

predicate, there are two significant facts that we

6

produced at trial which are quite important.

7

But as a

Number one, with respect to our submission

8

that there is a practice and custom in the City of

9

Canton of withholding medical care for persons who the

10

police think are emotionally disturbed, as opposed to

11

suffering from physical ailments, the custom was

12

established not by a series of incidents that we proved

13

but by testimony of a police officer, not that he

14

withheld care in these cases, but Officer Norsia, as we

15

cite in our brief, testified that he was trained not to

16

provide medical care to persons who the officer believed

17

was suffering from emotional distress unless that person

18

became seriously dangerous to herself.

19

20
21

22
23

25

QUESTION:

Well, is that by itself supposed to

be a violation of the equal protection clause?
MR. RUDOVSKY:
protection matter.
QUESTION:

I don't think it's an equal

I think when the city —
Treating mentally disturbed people

differently than physically -MR. RUDOVSKY:

No, no.

We don't make an equal

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

protection argument.

We say that someone who is

2

mentally disturbed, as Mrs. Harris, was, and in fact

3

was, as the jury finding mandates in this case, was

4

denied necessary medical attention.
The policy -- not the policy, the practice' and

5

6

custom of denying medical care to people in that

7

situation, until they became literally dangerous to

8

themselves, which she wasn't, she wasn't trying to

9

commit suicide, she wasn't trying to hurt herself, means

10

that in a class of cases persons who are in need of

11

medical attention will not be given that medical

12

attention.
And we don't seek to support the verdict on a

13
14

single incident theory.

15

16

agree --

QUESTION:

If this was just a single

What Constitutional right do you

say was violated by -MR. RUDOVSKY:

Her right, ultimately her right

20

under the 14th amendment to necessary medical care as a

21

person in custody, pre-trial custody.

22

The violation under Monell is that the custom

23

of the city, the practice of the city which ultimately

24

caused this officer to withhold medical care, as he

25

said, the reason we withheld medical care is that we
39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

were trained, don't seek medical care to someone in Mrs.

2

Harris' condition.

3

testimony was not that -QUESTION:

4

That's the basic testimony.

And his

If that was the custom, I suppose

5

it was based on a notion that people who are just

6

emotionally, sort of emotionally disturbed, they don't

7

need medical care.
MR. RUDOVSKY:

9

though, the facts in this case.
QUESTION:

10
11

Well, you have to remember,
This is --

Well, isn't that -- that must have

been the opinion.
MR. RUDOVSKY:

12

It, it may have been the

13

opinion.

14

case, where Mrs. Harris, when she gets to the police

15

station, is disoriented, she's incoherent, she's

16

hyperventilating, and she literally cannot even sit on a

17

chair.

18

one point, in fact.

19

But when you apply it to the facts of this

She continues to fall to the floor, faints at

Someone in that condition, and I'll get to

20

this point, number one, may not be just emotionally

21

disturbed, they could be suffering a heart attack.

22

if the officer makes the judgment, well, this is just a

23

nervous arrestee, that person will never receive medical

24

care in the City of Canton, until as in this case her

25

son has to come to the police station -- this question
40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

But

1

of who provided medical care, Justice Marshall -- her

2

son comes and says to the officer, my mother is lying on

3

this dirty cell, she's hyperventilating, she's

4

hysterical, would you call a doctor?

5

And they said no.

You call the doctor.

He

6

calls a doctor, the doctor comes or the ambulance comes,

7

they put her on a stretcher, they're taking her out in

8

this condition, and what do the police do?

9

her transportation to the hospital because they say we

10
11

They delay

have to fingerprint her.
This was a callous disregard of this woman's

12

rights to medical care.

13

critical question here, was it caused by the city?

14

Remember language of 1983, subjects or causes to be

15

subjected to un-Constitutional deprivations.

16
17
18
19

20

QUESTION:

And it was caused, which is a

In your view, is there a difference

in a custom and a policy?
MR. RUDOVSKY:

There is.

And I will get to

the policy in one moment.
The custom, though, which this Court as a

21

legal matter has clearly recognized in Monell and

22

Adickes, is established by the officer's testimony, not

23

that I do it but that this is the way the police

24

department is trained.

25

QUESTION:

Well, why is that any different
41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

than a policy?
MR. RUDOVSKY:

2

In effect, Justice Kennedy,

3

this custom and practice becomes the policy.

4

written regulation that we have now has been superseded,

5

at least in cases with respect to emotionally disturbed

6

persons.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. RUDOVSKY:

9

This

So in this case it is a policy?
I think it amounts to a policy,

although this Court, and the reason I hesitate to say

10

blanketly it's a policy, is that this Court has used the

11

terminology "practice and custom" where you have a

12

written regulation which is supposedly the policy, and

13

then over time officers by lack of training or

14

supervision adopt a different practice.
And that's why I use the term "custom and

15
16

practice," and I will get to the policy of lack of

17

training.

18
19

20
21

QUESTION:

What do you have besides this one

officer's testimony?
MR. RUDOVSKY:

That is the testimony.

But the

important —

22

QUESTION:

What else do you have?

23

MR. RUDOVSKY:

Oh, the other factor I want to

24

mention in terms of the other piece of evidence is the

25

testimony of the chief of police, who at least at the
42
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
20 F ST.. N.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

time he testified was the chief of police, who testified

2

that we give no training -- we're not talking about

3

inadequate training -- we give no training to police to

4

help them distinguish between symptoms that may just be

5

symptoms of an emotional disturbance, as opposed to

6

physical problems.

7

No training with respect to symptoms of

8

someone in emotional distress, no training with respect

9

to symptoms of someone who may be having a heart attack,

10

no training with respect to symptoms of someone who has

11

respiratory problems.

12

Now, that fits into the lack of training

13

policy prong of our argument.

14

underlying custom, which has now become

15

un-Constitutional, but it gets aggravated by the fact

16

that the police are not even trained to distinguish

17

properly between emotionally disturbed people and those

18

suffering physical ailments.

19

Not only do you have this

That is, in this case it may have turned out

20

to be a physical ailment.

But if this case was a heart

21

attack, if this case was a heart attack, which it well

22

could have been, given her symptoms, the officer for two

23

reasons would have been caused not to act by the city's

24

policy, one, he's made a determination that it's a

25

mental instability and therefore we won't get training,
43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

and two, he's made that decision incorrectly because he

2

hasn't even been given the rudimentary training that's

3

necessary for a police officer in that situation.
And we're not talking about 400 hours of

4

training in this case.

We're not talking about the most

officials in the station decisions that could be in some

circumstances life or death, you have to give them at

It's the point I think that Justice Stevens

13

made in his question to opposing counsel.

o'clock, which was two hours after she was arrested.

inference, given that we were the verdict winner in the

But any police officer who in his normal

10

course, or her normal course, exercises powers of

11

arrest, exercises powers sometimes of lethal force, at a

12

minimum consistent with this Court's opinions, have to

13

know when to use it and when not.

14

And it certainly is not counter-intuitive to

15

suggest that one who is not properly trained, who

16

receives no instructions that you cannot use lethal

17

force against a fleeing pickpocket, is not as readily

18

going to cause or commit a violation of Constitutional

19

rights than the very policy in Garner, which this Court

20

condemned, which just permitted the use of deadly force

21

in that kind of situation.

22

Either one can as readily cause the underlying

23

Constitutional violation as the other.

And that's why

24

we suggest that the proper standard, the proper standard

25

in determining whether or not failure to train amounts

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

to a violation of Section 1983 is best determined on a

2

theory of gross negligence.

3

That theory would require the Plaintiff to

4

pro^e, and it's ultimately the burden of proof of the

5

Plaintiff, to demonstrate that the failure to train in a

6

particular situation --

7

QUESTION:

You, you pick gross negligence from

8

our cases, or from the statute, or just because you

9

think it would be a good idea?

10

MR. RUDOVSKY:

No.

I think that gross

11

negligence has a basis both in some of the opinions of

12

this Court, and certainly some of the opinions of the

13

lower court.

14

what Monell requires.

15

But more important, we think it satisfies

20

MR. RUDOVSKY:

That always struck me as a

I have some law students who I

21

teach in the courtroom and, they've been unsatisfied

22

with some of my definitions, as we go along the

23

continuum of culpability.

24
25

I'm not going to stand before this Court and
say, I can give a precise formulation as to when
47
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

negligence folds into gross negligence, when gross

2

negligence folds into deliberate indifference, when

3

deliberate indifference folds into intentionality.

4

But gross negligence as understood, and

5

certainly in terms of agency principles, which are

6

well-established,

7

if you adopt a policy, and this is a deliberate choice,

8

you either train or you don't train, that's certainly a

9

choice made by a city official, that creates a high-risk

it is not unfair to say to a city that

10

and a high degree of foreseeability, which is gross

11

negligence, to the citizens of the community in that

12

particular area where you don't train, and in fact a

13

Constitutional violation occurs, a jury can find, a jury

14

can find both causation and we also have fault.

15

I'm not suggesting a no-fault standard here.

16

Monell says we need causation, and we need fault.

17

negligence meets the fault standard, and indeed when you

18

think about the notion of causation, you can have

19

causation whether or not you have fault.

20

Gross

Whether in fact an officer doesn't get trained

21

under Garner deliberately, or the city just forgets to

22

train that officer, the result can be the same, the

23

person gets shot regardless of the question of fault.

24
25

But we recognize that fault is a component of
Monell, and indeed as Justice O'Connor noted in her
48
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

opinion in dissent, in the Kibbe case, she would require

2

some higher level of culpability to ensure that there

3

was in fact causation, that a jury's not speculating.

4

I think where I disagree somewhat with that

5

analysis is to the level of culpability you require.

6

Remember, to the degree it was suggested in that

7

dissenting opinion, that we don't know whether the

8

officer acted because of lack of training or because of

9

predisposition or because of some kind of malice toward

10

the Plaintiff, we're concerned about a jury speculating

11

on, on, on causation, and then we get into the

12

respondeat superior situation.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

I'm also concerned about a jury

speculating about what is gross negligence.
Why shouldn't we adopt a much higher standard,

16

to the extent, to the extent we miss something as a

17

policy, which you think should have been considered a

18

bad policy, you get the city under a practice anyway.

19

If indeed they've adopted a policy of not

20

training people, it is very bad, because it's absolutely

21

foreseeable that these officers are not, are going to be

22

making mistakes.

23

have a practice of providing inadequate medical care,

24

which will enable the city to be held liable.

25

They will make mistakes, and you will

QUESTION:

it's as foreseeable as you say it is?
MR. RUDOVSKY:

4
5

Why wouldn't you inevitably, if

Well, but I think that's the

definition of gross negligence.

6

Gross negligence suggests a high degree of

7

foreseeability and a high degree of risk in terms of

8

danger.

Once you get -QUESTION:

9

Yes, but I'm a little worried about

10

having the jury guess about that, whereas a practice you

11

can look out there and say, here are ten instances of

12

adequate, inadequate medical care.
MR. RUDOVSKY:

13

I think the response to that,

14

Justice Scalia, in part is that to the degree you're

15

worried that the jury may be deciding on some other

16

basis, and maybe the officer acted not because of lack

17

of training but because of predisposition, say, and how

18

do we know?
Well, the city can call that officer at

19

20

trial.

21

in this case, did you not provide medical care because

22

of lack of training, or was it some other

23

predisposition?

24
25

They city can call the officer and say, officer,

This officer might have said, look, I wasn't
trained properly.

We had a custom of denying medical

care.

But that's not the reason I didn't send her to

2

the hospital.

3

didn't send her because she gave my fellow officer a

4

hard time out on the street.

I knew she needed medical attention.

I

5

Well, if the jury accepts that testimony, and

6

it can be produced by the city, then there's a question

7

on causation.
QUESTION:

8
9

That's a realistic hypothetic

you're giving us?

10

MR. RUDOVSKY:

11

QUESTION:

Not only is it realistic --

The realistic hypothetical is going

12

to be what happens here, that the officer gets off and

13

the deep pockets, the city, gets held liable.

14

the realistic -MR. RUDOVSKY:

15

That's

I have seen it happen in the

16

qualified immunity context, where the officer in fact

17

says, I acted the way I acted because I wasn't properly

18

trained.

19

And in these cases, remember, municipalities

20

are different defendants from the individual, and

21

sometimes they have different lawyers, and sometimes

22

they're at odds.

23

All I'm suggesting is that to the degree

24

you're worried that the failure to train didn't cause

25

the violation, that it may have been something else,
51
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

that's a matter, that's a matter for evidence.
When you look at principles of agency -- now

2
3

we're not dealing with respondeat superior -- a basic

4

principle of agency which was established in 1871 when

5

this act was passed, and which is now codified in the

6

restatement, is that a principle, the employer, is

7

generally responsible for failure to control, supervise,

~8

and discipline employees, a simple negligence standard

9

which we're not suggesting here.
The courts have not had trouble adjudicating

10
11

that principle.

They haven't had trouble deciding when

12

in fact the employer's failure to control was the

13

causation factor for the ultimate violation.
These are settled principles that common law

14
15

courts have applied for decades without much difficulty,

16

and we don't think that a Federal court in a civil

17

rights action properly charged, a jury that's properly

18

charged, will have difficulty.
Nor do we think that error is a one-way

19

20

street, that is that a jury will always find causation

21

when causation didn't occur, as opposed to the other

22

problem.

23

There will be situations where, under the

24

standard, a jury perhaps will find, even under gross

25

negligence, will not find causation, where maybe in fact
52
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

2

it existed.
Causation obviously is a very elusive

3

concept. ' But we're stuck with it as a matter of tort

4

principle, and certainly as a matter in this Court's

5

jurisprudence on Section 1983, the statute itself talks

6

about, subjects, or causes to be subjected.

7

If you look for the most analogous principle

8

in common law tort, and certainly this Court time and

9

again has said, we look to common law tort principles on

10

occasion in fleshing out 1983, the agency principle of

11

an employer controlling an employee certainly has

12

sufficient bite, has sufficient experience, and has

13

sufficient general acceptance in the jurisprudence of

14

this country for it to be the standard here.

Mr. Rudovsky --

16

MR. RUDOVSKY:

17

QUESTION:

Yes.

Your time's almost up.

And when

18

you raised your point about this, the main issue that

19

we're now discussing not having been raised, I tended to

20

agree with you on the manner in which the question was

21

presented in the statement of question presented.

22

But I've been looking through the petition

23

seems to me do raise the question, including the

statement that the fundamental issue in Kibbe is

And in your reply to the petition, you didn't

2

deny that, by saying, oh no, this was all acknowledged

below.

that Kibbe involves un-Constitutional conduct arising

6

out of gross negligent failing, as opposed to a

7

regulation coupled with inadequate training.
You just completely failed to make the point

You distinguish Kibbe in a quite different way,

you're making.

Counsel who filed that did not

that that issue was not properly preserved either.

I think, in retrospect, if I had written that

But given this almost right-hand turn the city

has now taken from the trial court here, you're left

with a totally imperfect record.

have met the standard they now say should be the

theory, we think that the Court of Appeals' judgment in

The case can be retried

If the Court of Appeals had the

wrong standard in mind, the case will be retried on the

MR. RUDOVSKY:

10

Not necessarily.

A lot of

water has gone over the dam since the Court of Appeals

spoke.

MR. RUDOVSKY:

It's certainly a problem in

20

terms of this tension between a record that is not

21

properly preserved and an issue you want to decide, and

22

we agree, ought to be decided at some point.

23

But an issue of this importance, and this

24

Court has done this before when -- negligence, it took

you three times finally to decide that, in terms of

whether negligence states a cause of action in 1983, we

2

don't think it, it should not be decided.
We think on this record it's difficult,

police officer may well not suffice to meet that

standard.
MR. RUDOVSKY:

Justice O'Connor, just in quick

response, I think unrebutted testimony of the police

officer, when the city could have presented a witness to

rebut that testimony, I think under evidentiary rules,

should be sufficient to establish -QUESTION:

19

Well, there's going to be a new

trial in this case no matter what we decide.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PHILLIPS:

3

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

4

Justice White, I'd like to, I'd like to respond to the

5

last statement that you made to counsel.
If this Court concludes that there is no

6
7

evidence from which a policy as a basis for liability

8

under 1983 exists, there is no reason for a new trial in

9

this case.

10

At a minimum, one of the things this Court is

11

obliged to do at this stage is to decide whether or not

12

the standards employed by the Sixth Circuit are an

13

appropriate basis for a new trial, and we say that's

14

clearly wrong, and I don't still hear Respondents'

15

counsel to defend the standards employed by the Sixth

16

Circuit in this case.
QUESTION:

17

Respondent says it's not fair to

18

him.

19

known that the standard that you're now contending

20

before us is the standard he v/as going to be held to.

21

He might have produced additional evidence, had he

He produced lesser, or evidence to satisfy a

22

lesser standard because you conceded the lesser standard

23

in the trial.

24
25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Scalia, the truth is

that the evidence in this case doesn't meet any standard
57
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

with respect to the city.
You can use simple negligence, and there's not

2
3

enough evidence to go to the jury.
QUESTION:

4
5

in.

That's the evidence that was put

But he's saying I might have put in more if I -MR. PHILLIPS:

6

But even, even in the worst of

7

circumstances, he knew he was obliged to put in enough

8

evidence to demonstrate that the city was negligent.

9

And he hasn't even done that.
So he's hardly in a position to say here that

10
11

we've sandbagged him with respect to the evidence he

12

wants to put in on the issue of a policy in this case.
QUESTION:

13
14

the Court of Appeals was wrong on its standard.
MR. PHILLIPS:

15
16

Both of you, I take it, think that

Yes.

And we believe -- but the

standard the Court of Appeals -QUESTION:

17

And so the question is, if we just

18

dismiss as improperly granted an admittedly wrong

19

decision, the Court of Appeals is going to govern in a

20

new trial?
MR. PHILLIPS:

21

Yes.

That's absolutely

22

correct.

23

anything different other than say that it thinks that

24

the standard of the Sixth Circuit --

25

The District Court's not in any position to do

QUESTION:

But you just said that you haven't
58

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

heard your opponent defend the --

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's correct.

I still don't

3

think I've heard him defend that standard, and all I'm

4

saying is that under any standard there's no basis for

5

going back for a trial in this case.
Because if you examine the custom, or excuse

6
7

me, the policy issue in this case, there's one, no issue

8

that any policymaker ever, ever made a decision with

9

respect to the adequacy of training in this case.
The chief of police that he cites was the

10
11

chief of police in 1980, not in 1978 when the events

12

took place.
Second of all, there's no deliberate choice

13
14

among alternatives in this case, because there's no

15

evidence whatsoever of what alternative levels of

16

training could possibly have been adequate in this

17

case.

18

And finally, there is no evidence on the issue

19

of causation.

20

what level of training would have been satisfactory to

21

stop Mrs. Harris from suffering the injuries she

22

suffered, and I submit to you that a physician in this

23

particular case could well have made exactly the same

24

mistake that the officers made.

25

There's not a single expert testify as to
