ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. GUSTAFSON

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11
12
13

MR. GUSTAFSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
This case concerns whether the Fourteenth

14

Amendment requires dismissal of a state criminal

15

conviction for the alleged failure of police to properly

16

preserve and to test certain materials obtained from a

17

rape victim.

18

The Respondent was convicted by a jury of

19

crimes involving the rape of a boy.

The Arizona Court

20

of Appeals found that the Respondent was denied due

21

process because of police inaction in two areas:

22

that police did not perform certain tests on materials

23

they had obtained from the rape victim.

24

were properly preserved as they were refrigerated.

25

secondly, the police did not refrigerate the victim's

first,

These materials

And

1

undergarments that they bad obtained when the victim

2

went to tbe hospital.

3

The lower court found that these inactions on

4

tbe part of the police constituted a due process

5

violation requiring reversal of tbe jury's verdicts and

6

dismissal of the prosecution.

7

It is tbe State's position that the lower

8

court has substituted speculation about the evidentiary

9

value of these materials for the constitutional standard

10

of materiality and in doing so, has obviated the role of

11

the jury as the trier of fact.

12

The circumstances regarding the collection of

13

the evidence in question are as follows.

14

the 10 year old boy was kidnapped and raped.

15

the details of tbe crime, he was taken to the hospital

16

shortly after the offense.

17

On October 29,
Omitting

At tbe hospital tbe boy was treated for his

18

injuries and, in addition, the treating physician used

19

what is known as a sexual assault kit.

20

It's a device -- it's a kit that collects evidence from

21

different areas.

22

physician used a swab, swabbed the boy's rectum, made a

23

microscopic slide of tbe contents of tbe smear, gave it

24

to police who refrigerated it.

25

thing to do.

It's a device.

But in this particular instance, the

And that was the proper

At the time, the police also gathered the

2

boy's undershirt and his underpants.

3

in a bag and placed in property, and they were not

4

refrigerated.

5

Those were placed

About nine days after the gathering of that

6

evidence, the police criminologist examined the

microscope slide obtained at the hospital.

that there was spermatozoa present on the slide, but

9

found only a small portion of it.

QUESTION:

Mr. Gustafson, did the defense ask

for any Brady materials in this case?
MR. GUSTAFSON:

No, and they don't need to.

13

Under the Arizona Rules of Criminal Discovery, we're

14

obligated to give that to them.

15

QUESTION:

We have to --

What does the record show, if

16

anything, that the State disclosed to the defense about

17

the existence of the swab and the clothing?

MR. GUSTAFSON:

The record shows -- there's an

19

absence in the record on this part.

MR. GUSTAFSON:

Thank you.

1

State's disclosure in this case is its formal police

2

reports which are given directly to defense counsel.

3
4

QUESTION:

The police report shows that there

was a rectal swab and some clothing of the victim?

5

MR. GUSTAFSON:

Yes.

6

Now, what's clear is that 10 days after his

7

arraignment -- we will bring this to December 20 --

8

there was supposed to be a preliminary hearing which

9

wasn't held.

10
11
12

That is at the time that the State had to

issue its disclosure.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gustafson, could you speak up a

little bit?

13

MR. GUSTAFSON:

QUESTION:

16

Okay.

Yes.

little higher. You're a tall Scandinavian there.
MR. GUSTAFSON:

We --

But I cannot say at the exact

17

time that they knew about the existence of -- because

18

there was a continuing process of disclosure.

QUESTION:

Did the defense ever ask to examine

these items to do their own testing?

21

MR. GUSTAFSON:

22

QUESTION:

24
25

No, they did not.

The --

Why didn't the State conduct tests

on the clothing for the blood group do you suppose?
MR. GUSTAFSON:

The -- they eventually -- to

put it in a nutshell, they were put into property and no

over a year.

QUESTION:

They were not examined.
When you say they were put into

property, what do you mean?

Yes, in a paper bag.

evidence.
After the police criminologist examined the

12

microscope slide, which was nine days after the crime,

13

some six weeks or five weeks after that examination, the

14

Respondent was arrested.

15

called into question.

That was

When the case first came to trial, which was

22

in December of 1984, the defense called the

23

criminologist who did not examine any of the evidence,

24

either the rectal swab slide or the underwear.

25

2

materials.

3

as an attempt to create a reasonable doubt in the jury's

4

mind.

The defense at trial used this to create --

The police criminalist had -- had tested the

rectal swab shortly before trial and determined that it

did not have --

MR. GUSTAFSON:
QUESTION:

14

It was.

-- it had been refrigerated, wasn't

it?
MR. GUSTAFSON:

12
13

That was a year or so after --

That's correct.

It was a year

after.
QUESTION:

And I gather there were some signs

15

after that test that perhaps, if it were accurate, the

16

accused would be exonerated, wasn't there?

17

MR. GUSTAFSON:

There wasn't -- contamination

18

wasn't shown on the sample that was refrigerated.

19

defense expert stated -- eliminated -- since it was

20

refrigerated, eliminated the possibility of bacterial

21

contamination because it had been refrigerated.

22

The

In fact, at the lower court, the Respondent

23

had asked in his opening brief that the case be remanded

24

for possible retesting of that refrigerated thing.

25

I don't think it was established that that was

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

But

1

contaminated.

There was some speculation as to that.

At trial the Respondent's position about the

2
3

testing was this.

4

sexual assault kit determined that there was no blood

5

type on it, that raised two possibilities.

6

either that that sample was insufficient when it was

7

gathered, or that the true assailant -- this is

8

according to the Respondent -- was part of 20 to 25

9

percent of the population who do not secret their blood

type into their other bodily fluids.
At that trial the defense expert also

11
12

questioned about the underwear, essentially that that

13

would be a good place to look, or it -- frequently, in

14

his experience, that semen would be found upon it.

15

trial resulted in the hung jury.

That

Following that trial, the police had obtained

16
17

a new test, which is called the P-30 test.

18

had been used in only -- it was of recent vintage and

19

had been used by about 50 percent of the crime

20

laboratories in the country.

21

Department obtained that test, and then they tested that

22

sample in January.

And the Tucson Police

What did they test then?
In January they tested the

underwear.

QUESTION:

with the P-30 test?

9

Yes.

That's correct.

Why didn't the State test the swab

MR. GUSTAFSON:

Either the police criminalist

10

-- it doesn't appear in the record.

11

asked to do so, or in his opinion the sample was just

12

too small to get a result from that test.

13

Either he was not

Now, the -- at the second trial, although this

14

was all in question at the first trial -- at the second

15

trial, the Respondent used the former trial testimony of

16

his expert.

17

at all of the evidence.

18

They didn't do any retesting or any testing

It's the State's position that in a situation

19

like this, we have to look at, as this Court did in

20

California v. Trombetta, to two focus points as to the

21

constitutional standard of materiality.

22

whether or not the evidence had exculpatory value that

23

was apparent before it was destroyed; and two, whether

24

or not the defendant had a comparable means, a

25

reasonably available alternative.

First is

Now, in the instant case, the apparent value

1

of that evidence is contingent upon technology, the

3

existence of the technology.

4

the Respondent made to the jury was that the material

5

gathered was exculpatory because something would not be

6

found within it.

7

is the absence of something.

get an inclusive result, they have to use another test,

MR. GUSTAFSON:

14

They didn't have -- there's

15

three types of tests that they could quantify.

16

not have the P-30 test, which measures a constituent of

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Gustafson, can I ask you a

question because it's kind of hard to piece all these

tests together?

14

saying two things?

15

But am I -- just see -- am I correct in

One, that if they had preformed the test that

16

showed that the semen samples were the product of a

17

person who was a nonsecretor, that would have been a

18

complete defense for the defendant.

19

MR. GUSTAFSON:

20

QUESTION:

Yes.

And secondly, what I want to know

21

is did you at the time you had these samples and before

22

the second trial, have tests available that could have

23

been performed to determine that?

24
25

MR. GUSTAFSON:

Between the first and the

second trial?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

QUESTION:

1

No.

At any time before the second

2

trial, could you have performed tests which would have

3

determined whether or not the donor was a nonsecretor?

4

MR. GUSTAFSON:

QUESTION:

6

And then the case boils down to whether you

had any obligation to do that.

8

MR. GUSTAFSON:

Yes.

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

10

QUESTION:

Well, does the record indicate that

11

those tests would have achieved a valid result if there

12

was enough of a sample to make a conclusion?
MR. GUSTAFSON:

13

They would have -- it wouldn't

14

be conclusive was the expert's testimony.

15

make an estimate based upon the different constituents.
QUESTION:

16

They could

And the thing that was being

17

estimated was whether or not there was a sufficient

18

quantity to go ahead and make the test for the blood

19

group?

20

MR. GUSTAFSON:

21

QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, what test could you have

22

performed before the second trial that you were

23

referring to Justice Stevens?

24
25

MR. GUSTAFSON:

It's because there's -- there

were two samples.

MR. GUSTAFSON:

QUESTION:

6

What tests could you have performed?
The P-30.

On whom?

On what?

On the sexual assault kit.

I know, but you would have been

performing a test on the swab?

7

MR. GUSTAFSON:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. GUSTAFSON:

Yes.

To do what?

To determine whether?

If there was sufficient

quantity of semen present, to then later use an ABO

blood type test.

12
13
14

QUESTION:

But you would have had to go and

have a blood type test.
MR. GUSTAFSON:

Yes. . They had already

15

obtained that and got an inclusive result.

16

blood type test in the case simply showed no blood type.

17

QUESTION:

The ABO

I'm confused by your answers to

18

Justice Stevens and Justice Kennedy and Justice White.

19

And it may well not be your fault.

20

that the Pima County criminologist said that the P-30

21

was not in practice in Pima County.

22

MR. GUSTAFSON:

23

QUESTION:

At one time you said

That's correct.

But now I thought you answered

24

Justice Stevens that the State could have performed a

25

P-30 test before the second trial.

1

MR. GUSTAFSON:

2

QUESTION:

3

Yes.

Well, bow do you reconcile those

two answers?
MR. GUSTAFSON:

4

They didn't have them -- the

5

P-30 test at the time of the first trial.

After the

6

first trial, they did the P-30 test.

7

they get the P-30 test, they test the clothing.

8

don't test the sexual assault kit with the P-30 test.

9

Then we have the second trial.

They then -- when
They

That's what happened.

So, in other words, when I'm asked is there a

10
11

test that they had that they didn't do, the answer is

12

yes.

13

sexual assault kit.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. GUSTAFSON:

They had the P-30 that they didn't do on the

Why did the State not do it?
It was either the police

16

criminalist didn't think there was enough sample there

17

-- and he did testify that he didn't think that there

18

was enough there -- or that he could go back and try,

19

but it was a very small sample.

20
21

QUESTION:

So, he rendered his opinion that it

would not have been useful in producing evidence.

22

MR. GUSTAFSON:

23

QUESTION:

Yes.

But as far as that's concerned,

24

even at the time of the second trial, it still was not

25

too late to do the P-30 on the swab.

It was too late to

MR. GUSTAFSON:

Yes.

The point I think I'd

like to make here is that the Respondent did have

alternative means by which he could establish this, and

that he did not use the tests basically because he had

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL F. DAVIS

15

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18

MR. DAVIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
The Court of Appeals did not tell the State of

19

Arizona that they needed to preserve or to test this

20

evidence because nobody had to tell the police of the

21

need to preserve and test this evidence.

22

if that clothing had been placed in the refrigerator, in

23

accordance with the normal practice of the Tucson Police

24

Department investigating an ordinary sexual assault,

25

that the defense could then test that evidence, and it

They knew that

2

The defense did not make the tactical decision

3

not to test that clothing.

4

made for them when the police failed to follow their

5

ordinary routine procedures in preserving that evidence

6

for later testing.

QUESTION:

You made the tactical decision not

to test the swab.

10

The tactical decision was

MR. GUSTAFSON:

No, sir.

Test -- yes, sir.

We did, in fact.

11

Testing the swab under -- for the P-30 protein

12

would be a meaningless exercise even today.

13

criminalist, Edward Heller, testified that in only about

14

10 percent of the cases do these rectal swabs ever

15

contain any semen at all.

The police

16

In addition, he had already tested it once by

17

a destructive test to determine the presence or absence

18

of blood markers, ABO specifically, which of the four

19

major blood groups the semen donor belonged to.
When questioned about doing further testing,

20
21

he said, "I suppose it would be possible.

I don't

22

know."

23

today we performed the destructive P-30 protein test and

24

found that on the swab today there is an adequate amount

25

to test.

But if we were to test it today, suppose that

That does not tell us that the amount removed

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

or not.

3

any further testing because we have elected to do the

P-30 protein test and have thereby destroyed the

5

evidence.

It would tell us that we can no longer perform

Had the defense made the tactical decision to

perform that test and destroyed that last bit of semen,

8

I would expect that we would be hearing today that it is

the defense's fault that the evidence was not preserved.

10

QUESTION:

Well, in any event, when did the

11

defense know that the victim's clothing had been

12

obtained by the police and that a swab had been taken?

13

MR. DAVIS:

I don't know the precise date,

14

Your Honor, and I was not trial counsel.

15

know that it was after December 10, 1983.

16

Youngblood was arrested December 10, 1983, six weeks to

17

the day after the assault occurred.

However, I do

that these items existed and presumably could have made

a demand to have them tested.

would have been meaningless.

Q-tip. It has already been subjected to some testing.

14

But I agree today that it may be a viable product for

15

testing, but it is most unlikely that there is anything

16

in there worthy of testing.

17

QUESTION:

It is merely the size of a

But certainly an objection was made

18

and an argument to the jury that it was -- the State

19

should have done this testing, and that there was a

reasonable doubt because it wasn't done.

that worked to the advantage of the defendant.

QUESTION:

What's the other part of your

that we could perform the tests.

immediately, the breath, and then disposed of.

the reliable test results were available.

not make that choice for us, but rather merely place the

clothing or not.

In order to get anything out of

1

MR. DAVIS:

The other testimony, the other

2

evidence at trial consisted solely of the testimony of

3

the victim. At the first trial, we got a lot of

4

information about what this victim had described at the

5

time that the attack was vivid in his mind, that very

night.

19

moves away from the initial description that he gave to

20

the police and more toward a description focused toward

Mr. Youngblood.
The police told him at the time of Mr.

QUESTION:

Well, surely you were entitled to

3

impeach the victim at the second trial by showing -- and

4

the jury was entitled to credit or not credit as it

5

chose.

6

MR. DAVIS:

I agree.

And not only is that

7

important for the jury, but because -- as this Court

8

held in Bagley, what we are concerned about is our level

9

of confidence in the jury's final holding.

That's the

10

reason why the Court of Appeals asked itself whether the

11

evidence was so conclusive, so overwhelming that the

12

loss of the semen sample is meaningless or that the loss

13

of the semen sample could not have given anything to the

14

defense of this case.

and the situation Justice Stevens poses in which the

11

station just burns down.

12

logical line for us to draw between those two instances.

13
14
15

MR. DAVIS:

I assume that would be a

I think that the line is going to

be drawn at a number of other points as well.
The Court of Appeals did not hold -- and I do

16

not advocate a position -- that the loss of evidence

17

automatically results in any particular sanction.

18

the evidence is lost through inadvertence, that in and

19

of itself is some evidence that perhaps that bit of data

20

was not material or significant in any particular way

21

because the police didn't bother to gather it, the

22

defense didn't draw the police attention to it.

23

that would come into play there.

24
25

If

And so,

But if the police are exercising reasonable
care in following their procedures and the evidence is
48
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

still lost, that is of small benefit to the accused who

2

finds that he cannot put on his defense as a result of

3

the loss of that evidence.

4

And for those reasons, I would urge that good

5

faith and bad faith not enter into the question at this

6

stage, but that instead, unless -- if the defense can

7

prove bad faith, then I would say that that is a

8

different case and it's not worthy of the same standard

9

here.

But when we have -- when everybody intended to

10

gather the evidence, intended to test the evidence and

11

intended to preserve the evidence, and then simply

12

failed to do so, we must look at the -- our conviction

13

in --regarding the fairness of the trial and our

14

certainty that the outcome is a reliable one.

15

And because those should be the guiding

16

principles as far as fashioning the remedy, the courts

17

should be given broad latitude in providing remedies

18

ranging from absolutely nothing at all to jury

19

instructions to instructions that certain facts must be

20

presumed to the contrary of the position taken by the

21

spoliator.

22

And finally, in some cases, in order to

23

preserve the integrity of the judicial process, after

24

the court, as the Arizona Court of Appeals did,

25

considered all other sanctions, the court may find that
49

That sanction should be available to the

The Court of Appeals on the record before this

is only a dismissal of the charges that can protect Mr.

this record, that after six weeks, the samples on the

clothing had deteriorated so that a useful test could

not be made?

MR. GUSTAFSON:

No.

There's so many different

20

acid phosphatase test, which their expert said stayed

21

stable over a period of years.

There is at least one test that would have

about the reasonable doubt to the jury, by doing an acid

But there is at least -- he could have

(Inaudible) the only thing that can

MR. DAVIS:

What he -- as to that one piece,

but there were several pieces and he won't examine any
of them.

And that one evidence is --

Mr. Gustafson, do you agree that

the P-30 test doesn't do anything except tell you how

MR. GUSTAFSON:

MR. GUSTAFSON:

MR. GUSTAFSON:

Yes.

-- how much semen you have.
That's it.

It's a useless test, isn't it?
It is except it was of

20

importance here.

When there was no ABO blood group

21

typing, then the claim is the real assailant is a

22

nonsecretor.

23

P-30 test can come in to tell you the additional

24

information that the -- if there was a large amount of

25

semen present, then you do have a nonsecretor.

Otherwise it's not important.

Well, I suppose when the tests --

when the evidence was gathered, they had no suspect.

That's correct.

And so, they may or may not ever

That's correct.

So, I guess the claim is that the
