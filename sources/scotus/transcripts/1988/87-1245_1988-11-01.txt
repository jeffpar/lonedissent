CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

4

now in Number 87-1245, Texas Monthly versus Bob

5

Bullock.

Mr. George, you may proceed whenever.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROGER JAMES GEORGE, JR.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. GEORGE:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
Texas Monthly is a general interest magazine

11

published by a commercial corporation in Texas with

12

circulation of roughly 280,000 copies.

13

various topics of interest to people in Texas ranging

14

from politics to religion, to sports, to food, to social

15

occasions, to all sorts of things, to humor.

16

published by a religious faith, and it is not a

17

religious magazine.

18

It covers

It is not

It is simply a commercial magazine.

It brought this lawsuit in the Travis County

19

District Court in Travis County, Texas, to recover

20

$149,107 in sales tax that it had paid in protest under

21

the applicable Texas procedure for subscription sales

22

during a period in 1985 when the state legislature had

23

imposed a tax on subscription sales of magazines.

24

Now, the Texas sales and use tax system is a

25

system similar to sales and use tax systems throughout

the country.

Generally, any tangible personal property

2

that someone purchases or uses in Texas is subject to

3

the tax.
Thus, if I go across the street from my office

and buy a paid of socks, I have to pay 6.125 percent of

6

the purchase price to the State of Texas.

supposed to pay a use tax when she puts it on because

If I buy a

10

she owes 6.125 percent of the purchase price for using

11

it in the state of Texas.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. GEORGE:

Is that down there?
Well, that was one of the issues

14

that raised in the court below, in the District Court,

15

and our contention was that that was a provision that

16

was ignored and ignored involving sales and use taxes

17

generally.
There are a plethora of exemptions from this

18
19

tax.

20

draft animals are exempt.

21

drill stem bits for drilling equipment, all drilling

22

equipment is exempt from the tax.

23

items are exempt from the tax ranging from fertilizer to

24

airplanes to certain shrimp boats.

25

Horses and mules, for example, that are used as
As one might expect in Texas,

And various other

Now, two of the exemptions that exist in this

tax are relevant to the case this court has before it

2

today.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. GEORGE:

Why aren't the others?
Well, the others may be relevant

5

and if so that there is a system of general exemptions

6

or random system of exemptions but two are most relevant

7

to the court's consideration today.
QUESTION:

8
9
10
11

So, you don't claim that there's an

unconstitutional distinction between mules and this
magazine?
MR. GEORGE:

Well, I suppose that would be an

12

interesting case, Your Honor, but I don't have to make

13

that contention today, and I'm not here trying to make

14

that contention.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. GEORGE:

17
18

Yes.
I am here concerning only two of

the exemptions, really one of the exemptions.
The first exemption is one to -- is an

19

illustration, and that is there is an exemption -- and

20

I'll refer to them by the last three digits of these

21

code numbers -- Section 310 of the statute -- which is a

22

general exemption from tax for charitable, religious,

23

civic organizations, volunteer fire departments, the Boy

24

Scouts, and the Chamber of Commerce.

25

institutions -- Goodwill Industries, for example -- buys
5

If any of those

1

something -- the Methodist Church -- when my church buys

2

something and uses it, it does not have to pay the tax.
There is no exemption for the sale of goods

3
4

that is generally applicable to those institutions.

5

that if the St. Vincent de Paul Store down on Third and

6

Brazos Street in Austin or the Goodwill store sells my

7

magazine or sells a used bicycle or sells a used book,

8

they have to collect the tax and remit it to the state.

9

And if the tax isn't collected, the state comes after

10

So

them for the tax.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. GEORGE:

If they buy it, they are exempt?
Yes.

It's the use of the tax --

13

you have -- the tax works so that people who use it are

14

subject to tax except for religious, charitable,

15

educational, the Boy Scouts and all those people.

16

if those institutions sell anything -QUESTION:

17

But

How about the sale by a church of a

18

religious item, a Bible or a crucifix or something of

19

that sort?

20

Is there an exemption?
MR. GEORGE:

Now, we come to the subject of

21

this lawsuit, which is the exemption.

The statutes of

22

the state of Texas tax the crucifix.

tax from the taxpayer.

2

The regulation specifically provides that if

3

they sell sheet music -- for example, if someone sells

4

the Methodist hymnal, if my church sells a Methodist

5

hymnal, that's sheet music, and I suppose the

6

Comptroller of the State of Texas requires them to

7

collect the tax and remit it to the State of Texas.
Now, the exemption that we're here about today

8
9

reads that exempt from these taxes are periodicals that

10

are published or distributed by a religious faith and

11

they consist wholly of writings promulgating the

12

teachings of the faith and books that consist wholly of

13

writings sacred to a religious faith are exempt from the

14

taxes imposed by this statute.
QUESTION:

15

Mr. George, if you prevail on this

16

argument, do you get your money back?

17

refund?
MR. GEORGE:

18
19

That's right.

Do you get a

court —

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. GEORGE:

Is there any question about that?
No, sir.

In the trial court we

22

won the judgment for $149,107.73, I believe, plus

23

interest, and that's what we're trying to recover here

24

today.

25

QUESTION:

Why is that?
7

I mean, why wouldn't

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

it be possible, at least, if you were to prevail that

2

the tax would be extended by Texas to religious

3

periodicals -MR. GEORGE:

4
5

ma'am.
QUESTION:

6
7

-- so that you wouldn't benefit

from it?
MR. GEORGE:

8
9

Because the court -- excuse me,

Excuse me, Justice O'Connor.

The

system that this court has recognized, and it's every

10

court except the courts of Arkansas and Tennessee and I

11

can find, recognize the rule that courts can't impose

12

taxes.

13

exempted these publications, period.

14

other court can change that decision.

15

that as taxpayers of under-inclusive statutes have, for

16

generations have is that they don't have to pay the tax

17

until the legislature changes the law and taxes all the

18

people that are similarly situated.

19

20
21

22
23

The legislature of the state of Texas has

QUESTION:

Its only remedy

And that's --

Well, does the state concede that

you get your money back if you prevail?
MR. GEORGE:

No, no, they do not.

They have

contended that the rule ought to be otherwise.
Now, the rule in Texas has, since 1885, been

24

in my favor under state law.

QUESTION:

1

2

But the state appellate court did

not reach this issue, just the state trial court?
MR. GEORGE:

3

The state trial court said. The

t

appellate court, of course, ruled that the statute that

r

I contend is unconstitutional wasn't unconstitutional

6

and hadn't reached that issue.
QUESTION:

7

8

This dissenting --

So, I should think that's an issue

of state law that's not before us and that's still open?
MR. GEORGE:

9

Well, I believe that's an issue

10

that -- well, I suppose that the state -- a possible

11

remand to the court would be possible.

12

court did not reach that issue.

13

Judge Carroll, in that court, did say that in course the

14

remedy was that we don't have to pay the tax.
QUESTION:

15
16

Technically that

The sitting judge,

But so, then, we're not certain

that you're going to get your money back?
MR. GEORGE:

17

Well, we have some -- I believe

18

every court in the state of Texas to rule on that has

19

ruled in my favor.

20

of the State of Texas take a contrary position in this

21

case.

QUESTION:

Well, in any event, you have to get

over this hurdle first before you can get the -MR. GEORGE:

I've got to win the merits before

I would get to that issue, but -9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

QUESTION:

1

2

And why is it relevant for us at

all?
MR. GEORGE:

3

Well, I don't believe it is

4

relevant.

This court addressed this very argument in

5

the Arkansas Writers' Project case.
QUESTION:

6
7

that have no meaning?

8

MR. GEORGE:

9

Well, do we often make decisions

No, you don't, and that's the

reason why you decided in the Arkansas Writers' Project,

10

the Arkansas Times got its money back.

11

get money back it had paid under the Arkansas statute,

12

and this court entered a judgment allowing it to recover

13

that money.
QUESTION:

14
15

Well, that was treated as a

question of standing, though, wasn't it, in Writers'?
MR. GEORGE:

16
17

I suppose it's either -- its

standing or remedy is a two-sided coin, obviously.
QUESTION:

18

Now, Ragland treated the question

19

as one of standing, did it not?

20

MR. GEORGE:

21

It was suing to

Yes.

Well, the Supreme Court of

Arkansas in that case --

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. GEORGE:

No, at this court.
-- decided that the remedy wasn't

24

available, and this court dealt with it as a standing

25

issue.

Do you have standing to bring it?
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

And it was exactly the same fact situation in

1

2

exactly the same pattern; that is, the Arkansas

3

magazine, the Arkansas Times sought to recover taxes it

4

had paid and tried to get back, and the Arkansas Supreme

5

Court said you're wrong on the Constitution, but if you

6

were right, you couldn't get your money back because

7

that's not the appropriate remedy.
This court in its opinion in April of '87 said

8
9

no, that's wrong, you have standing to bring it.

Now, I

10

think that given the court's decision in the Supreme

11

Court of Arkansas that, in fact, this court has decided

12

that issue; that at least as a matter of law of the

13

United States that my client is entitled to bring this

14

action and seek this remedy and if it is entitled to get

15

it back.
Now, again, Arkansas decided the remedy wasn't

16
17

available.

18

the taxpayer, and I believe that case is directly on

19

point.

20

likely to see in this court.

21

This court reversed and rendered in favor of

Now -- it's as on point as any case you're

Now, my client brought this action raising

22

three basic kind of arguments.

The first were under the

23

-- the first two were under the Minnesota Star issue

24

that we raised:

25

Texas was discriminatory against in-state magazines,
11

One, that the statute as applied in

ALDERSOIM REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

that there was a policy of not collecting the tax if the

2

magazine was distributed in Texas by somebody who wasn't

3

a Texas resident, and that as applied the system

4

discriminated against subscription sold magazines.

5

The District Court chose not to find any facts

6

or deal with those issues at all and simply determined

7

that the statute was unconstitutional because it

8

constituted a discrimination based upon the content of

9

the speech; that is, if a magazine contained, in the

10

words of the statutes, "It consisted wholly of writings

11

promulgating the teachings of the faith," the taxpayer

12

didn't have to pay the tax.

13

And that was unconstitutional under the line

14

of cases that includes this court's decisions from

15

Police versus Mosley through FCC versus the League of

16

Women Voters to Kerry versus Brown and a whole series of

17

cases that say that the government cannot discriminate

18

and impose regulations upon speech based upon the

19

content of that speech.

20

QUESTION:

This is a subsidy rather than a

21

regulation.

What do you think, Mr. George, about the

22

Post Office granting of specially lower rates to

23

educational materials?

24

MR. GEORGE:

25

QUESTION:

That's one category of speech.
Justice Scalia, that --

Why shouldn't amusement materials
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

get the same exemption?
MR. GEORGE:

2

Justice Scalia, that is a logical

3

conclusion, the dissent that you reached in those cases,

4

in the Arkansas Writers' case, was a logical

5

conclusion.

6

can support the Kennedy Center, using your example, from

7

that case.
The problem is history not logic.

8
9

This is simply a subsidy and obviously we

And if this

court will review the history of the imposition of

10

penalties involving speech from the Stamp Acts imposed

11

upon the English press through Grosjean versus American

12

Publishing Company, you will see that we have had a

13

history where sometimes legislatures impose taxes and

14

where there is a suspicion, at least, that it was

15

because they want to either silence or in some way chill

16

speech.

17

QUESTION:

But you're talking there -- you

18

must distinguish between a tax that just taxes a

19

particular activity and an exemption for a particular

20

activity from a general tax.

21

between those two in our cases?

22

MR. GEORGE:

Is there no difference

Well, if you will look back at

23

the English example of the Stamp Act taxes, the Stamp

24

Act was a general tax, and it was applied to

25

newspapers.

And if you will review the court's reciting
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

of Justice Sutherland's opinion in Grosjean, you will

2

see that that was indeed the case.

3

Stamp Act was applied to all sorts of things, including

4

newsprint, and there was a great outcry about that.

5

It wasn't -- the

But, in fact, the problem is intrusiveness in

6

my judgment.

The problem with the logical position

7

about subsidy versus history is that my magazine, for

8

example, my client contends every two years the

9

legislature of the state of Texas meets, and in those

10

sessions they have all kinds of statutes.

11

had my clients were exempt.

12

weren't exempt.

13

are exempt, but newsstand sales aren't exempt.

14

that back and forth, back and forth occurs in this area.

15

One time they

The next session they

And now they are.

Subscription sales
Now,

Now, each year my client writes an article,

16

write the ten best and ten worst legislators, and there

17

is a great interest in that because it is a widely

18

circulated magazine.

19

careers who believe that they have been seriously

20

damaged by being on the ten worst and some that have

21

been greatly enhanced by being on the ten best.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. GEORGE:

And there is some political

(Inaudible)
Right.

My problem is I cannot

24

prove that Stan Sludder, a representative who was

25

chairman of the committee in 1978, took that exemption
14

ALDERSOIM REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

out because he didn't like being on the "ten worst"

2

list.

3

inquiring into that.

I can't prove that.

And the courts should not be

That's why we need' and why the court's

4
5

majority in Arkansas Writers' Project have a salutary

6

rule that because while exemptions from tax and

7

subsidies have a logical symmetry -- we have Justice

8

Brennan's dissent in the Walz case involving exemption

9

from church property -- they are some similar, but not

10

the same.

And the lack of sameness comes from history

11

as much as logic.
QUESTION:

12

And the threat, the threat that

13

you're worried about would be eliminated if Texas

14

provided that this, this tax would apply uniformly to

15

all magazines including those sold by religious

16

organizations and dealing with religion provided,

17

however, that every religious organization that pays

18

such a tax will receive a subsidy from the state in the

19

amount of that tax that they've paid.

20

right?

21

MR. GEORGE:

That would be all

Well, you rapidly -- from

22

breaking this case down into its logical components, the

23

part of the First Amendment that deals with the press

24

and the speech you would have solved.

25

with the speech that you deal with the establishment

clause, you certainly wouldn't have solved because it's

2

clear there is one fundamental message.
If you start back with Everson, run through

3
4

Lindlin, run throw the Bowen case from last term about

5

establishment clause cases, and that, is the state cannot

6

subsidize delivery of religious message.

7

O'Connor's concurrence in that case says if there's

8

nothing else clear about this area of the law about

9

establishment clause law, you can't do that.

Justice

Now, you could not have a system that said

10
11

every time I pay a dollar to the First Methodist Church

12

in Austin, Texas, for the Methodist Layman that comes

13

every week, that they give that church six and a quarter

14

cents for delivering that message to me.

15

it is a direct, it violates every tenet of the Lemon

16

test, and it goes to the heart of the establishment

17

clause.

QUESTION:

special mail rates?

MR. GEORGE:

QUESTION:

MR. GEORGE:

Now, because

Religious organizations do not get

I don't know the answer to that.
I think they do.

That's granted.

MR. GEORGE:

That's true.

Church, to the volunteer fire department, to hospitals,

13

to libraries, and you give those, all those good works

or good institutions a special kind of benefit, a tax

break, a subsidy, as in the Bowen case.

16

basic -- basis of the court's opinion was the religious

17

organizations weren't singled out for special treatment.

One of the

The problem with this statute is that only

18
19

whatever religious faiths are, are singled out for the

20

treatment.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. George, I take it, then, if the

22

exemption here applied also to publications sold by

23

charitable and educational institutions as well as

24

religious, you think that Walz would be satisfied?

MR. GEORGE:

got there, however, because it seems to me that any

equal protection analysis requires the achievement of a

legitimate stadient and to achieve a legitimate

stadient, it cannot be a law respecting the

establishment of religion.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

6

MS. BURKE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
It is the position of the State of Texas in

7

this appeal that there's been no violation of the

8

establishment clause; that in judging this exemption,

9

Section 151.312, it should be viewed on a violation of

10

an equal protection standard and not a standard

11

involving violation of First Amendment rights.

12

The test to be applied should be one of a

13

rational basis test.

14

asserts is that, one, it seeks to accommodate religion

15

in the sense of being neutral towards religion and

16

helping effectuate the free distribution of religious

17

messages by a religious faith.

18

The rational basis that the state

The second rational basis is that the

19

exemption seeks to avoid any violation of the

MS. BURKE:

17

MS. BURKE:

18

QUESTION:

19

MS. BURKE:

The state does not --- based on content.
The way the state reads Arkansas

20

Writers' Project is that to have a First Amendment

21

violation, there must be a tax that singles out the

22

press as a whole and targets the press for that tax, or

23

it must target a small group within the press.

24

then, beyond that, you look to content-based

discrimination.

I'm not sure that I understand

You're saying that this is not a press tax as was

10

MS. BURKE:

11

QUESTION:

This is a general sales tax.
Yes.
And, therefore, the public harmed

12

by the exemption is not just the rest of the press, but

13

rather the entire body politic.

14

MS. BURKE:

Yes, Your Honor.

That's the way

15

the state views it.

16

it in that manner and determines that a strict scrutiny

17

approach should be applied in this case, the compelling

18

state interests are the same that I have enunciated as

19

being rational basis to sustain the exemption.

20

However, if the Court does not view

I would like to point out that if the Court so

21

determines that there has been a constitutional

22

violation, the state would request the court to

23

invalidate the exemption, leave Texas Monthly subject to

24

the tax, and remand the case to the trial court level to

25

determine whether or not religious periodicals would

then become subject to the tax under Texas Law.
QUESTION:

Texas Monthly would not get its

3

money back under that, is that right?

4

wouldn't get its money back?

5

MS. BURKE:

Texas Monthly

Not at that point in time, Your

6

Honor, until a decision was made as to whether religious

7

periodicals become subject to the tax because under the

8

current tax structure, all sales of tangible personal

9

property are taxable.

All property brought into the

10

state for use or shipped into the state are presumed to

11

be subject to the tax.

12

Therefore, we think in arguing before the

13

state courts that the intent of the legislature is quite

14

clear that if the legislation is invalidated, this

15

exemption falls, that these sales will become

16

automatically subject to the tax, and everyone will be

17

treated equally under the Texas tax structure.

18

QUESTION:

Ms. Burke, what if I think it's

19

unconstitutional for the Texas courts to say after the

20

fact, after the years have passed, we are retroactively

21

going to subject religious periodicals to taxes?

22

wouldn't have to remand to the Texas courts at all if I

23

thought there's no power in the Texas courts whatever?

Then I

24

Isn't that a strange procedure to decide after

25

the fact that prior sales have been subject to tax, even

2

can Texas do that?
MS. BURKE:

3

How

It's an unusual procedure, Your

4

Honor.

I haven't seen this argued before, but it's no

more unusual than invalidating, striking down the entire

tax system here just because you have one exemption from

this exemption weren't in effect compared as a matter of

percentage with the amount of revenue brought in by the

state sales tax?

14

MS. BURKE:

No, Your Honor, there is nothing

The exemption in Section 151.312 I have heard

6

Well, that's what I'm asking.
-- to impose the tax.

Can the state impose its sales tax

on the sale of candles in a Catholic church, too?

7

MS. BURKE:

QUESTION:

9

MS. BURKE:

Yes, Your Honor, it could.
Okay.
And the state is certainly not

10

asserting that it would be an absolute violation of

11

either the establishment clause or the free exercise

12

clause if the exemption were not in place.

13

recognize that rational bases have to meet -- be drawn

14

under the statute.

They

With regard to the Arkansas tax, Texas again

15
16

does see a distinction there because Arkansas did tax

17

only general interest periodicals and exempted

18

everything else from the terms of the tax including

19

newspapers.

20

It taxed all publications, including newspapers, but

21

exempted only religious periodicals from the terms of

22

the tax.

23

Texas tax structure is just the reverse.

If the exemption were not in place, as I have

24

said, the state is not saying that the rational basis is

25

that there would be a violation of the establishment

1

clause, but without the exemption there would be a

2

greater involvement between the church and the state in

3

the sense that the church would have the authority to be

4

subject to paying the tax, have an obligation and duty

5

to pay the tax, and if it did not, then the state could

6

go in and file liens against church property if there

7

was a delinquency.

8

property and sell it to pay a tax debt, and it also

9

could freeze church bank accounts.

10

It could seek to seize the church

This is certainly a greater involvement

11

between the church and the state than if the exemption

12

were not present.

13

This also pertains with regard to the free

14

exercise of religion.

15

present, there's a possibility of a violation under the

16

free exercise clause in that it has previously been held

17

that Jehovah's Witnesses, for example, going out and

18

disseminating their religious messages by selling

19

publications containing their religious messages when

20

they were required to pay a tax and obtain a license

21

before they could engage in these activities, this was

22

held to be a violation of their free speech rights and

23

also a violation of their free exercise rights.

If the exemption were not

Without the exemption in place there is a

possibility of a violation of the free exercise clause

of the First Amendment.

QUESTION:

Ms. Burke, I'm not sure -- were you

10

saying that one of our cases we have a Jehovah's Witness

11

case that rested on establishment clause grounds?

MS. BURKE:

QUESTION:

Yes, which was Murdock versus

Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

QUESTION:

Murdock.

And you're saying just as

17

we, just as the state couldn't -- must make an exemption

18

from a general licensing law for the sale of those pub

— was it clear that that was a sale case?

20

MS. BURKE:

Yes, Your Honor, they were

publications, and sometimes they were receiving

for a consideration.
And under that particular case, as I said, it

was a general regulatory-type situation, but it also was

a tax that was being imposed upon the sale of these

magazines.

also had to obtain a license, and this is pretty much

the same structure under the Texas Sales and Use Tax Act.

11

The state, therefore, feels that it has
asserted either rational basis or compelling state
interest to sustain the exemption in this case.
Texas Monthly has also raised the fact that

12

Section 151.312 does not or -- they say it does

13

constitute a law respecting establishment of religion.

14

The position of the state is that the lower court

15

correctly determined that this exemption does not fall

16

under that category; that it meets a three-part test in

17

Lemon versus Kurtzman:

18

secular legislative purpose in that it restricts the

19

physical relationship between church and state, and this

20

is what the Court of Appeals in Texas so determined.

21

also held that its primary purpose was not to advance or

22

inhibit religion.

23

permit religious periodicals, religious organizations in

24

effect to be free from state sponsorship or support.

25

excessive entanglement with religion.
QUESTION:

Do you think the Lemon test is the

exclusive test?
MS. BURKE:

I think it's a test that should be

5

applied, Your Honor, in this case.

6

should not be so rigidly applied in this type of

7

context, but I think it should be applied.

8
9

I think it probably

And I think the exemption meets all elements
of the test because I feel that it doesn't constitute

10

excessive entanglement with religion in the respect that

11

it doesn't create the appearance of an ongoing

12

partnership between church and state that, like, say, a

13

direct aid or subsidy would, even though you might refer

14

to an exemption as being a subsidy.

15

Certainly it has been held in the past that

16

determining in the Walz case that real property being

17

exclusively used for religious purposes didn't

18

constitute an excessive entanglement with religion and

19

also determine whether secular books that were to be

20

given to students of parochial schools, there had to be

21

a determination made there as to whether it contained

22

religious material or whether it was secular in nature.

23

That was held not to constitute excessive entanglement

24

with religion.

25

What the state is doing here is being mutual
39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

towards religion.

It is trying to accommodate religion

2

by allowing for the free distribution of religious

3

teachings and materials.

4

inhibiting religion, it is a secular, legislative

5

purpose, and it does not foster an excessive

6

entanglement with religion.

It is not advancing or

In the past in that area on advancing

7

8

religion, just going back to that for a minute, it has

9

already been held that time-release programs where

10

students that were released from public schools to go

11

off school grounds to attend religious instruction, that

12

this type of program did not create a symbolic union

13

between church and state so as to constitute an

14

advancement of religion.
I think this same sort of approach can be

15
16

applied to tax case in that the voluntary sale and

17

purchase of these types of religious periodicals

18

likewise does not constitute excessive entanglement,

19

does not advance religion.
It has been pointed out that under the Texas

20
21

tax structure that what we have here is an exemption

22

exempting the sales of religious periodicals based on

23

content.

24

whole exemption is really content-based.

25

status-based and activity-based.

We previously said we don't feel that the
It's more

40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

There are other exemptions, however, in the

1

2

Texas Sales and Use Tax Act, one of which is an

3

exemption that allows religious organizations and other

4

organizations to make one-day sales in a calendar year

5

of any items that they so desire to sell.
And I realize that is broader based than just

6
7

the religious aspect.

But, there's another exemption

8

that permits the sale of food, food products by church

9

or the church function, and that can occur any time

10

during the church year.

So there are other exemptions

11

that are basically religious-based in the Texas Sales

12

Tax Act.
The state perceives this, as I've said earlier

13
14

and submits to the Court that what we have here is a

15

nondiscriminatcry tax.

16

this as a situation where there is content-based

17

discrimination, a strict scrutiny test should be applied

18

and the exemption should be upheld under this type of

19

test because what we have here is two competing

20

constitutional interests, the right to free speech by

21

the press and the right to free speech by religion.

22

to avoid any violation of the free exercise clause or

23

the establishment clause in which we feel a compelling

24

state interest, we submit that the exemption should be

25

upheld.

If the Court, however, perceives

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. GEORGE:

5

Two points.

First, the Arkansas

Writers' Project case involved an Arkansas general sales

7

tax statute.

8

property, according to the court's opinion, in the state

9

of Arkansas, and there were a series of exemptions, like

It provided a taxation of all tangible

10

in Texas, for mules and various things, but there was

11

only an exemption for religious, trade, sports, and

12

professional journals.
So, there were a lot of -- or media, I

13
14

suppose.

The agricultural magazines, magazines about

15

the oil and gas industry or other things were subject to

16

tax, along with general interest magazines.

Well, all newspapers were exempted.

And there the evidence was, according to this

2

court's opinion, one to three magazines paid the tax.

3

In our evidence, the Comptroller's people testified that

4

20 to 30 paid the tax.

5

Arkansas and Texas, I think that's a distinction without

6

a difference in that we, in fact, have as few as 20 of

7

the hundreds and hundreds of magazines that are

3

circulated in Texas are subject to tax -- not because of

9

the exemptions, because of the enforcement policy.

QUESTION:

MR. GEORGE:

Given the relative size of

Because of what?
Our enforcement policy argument

that was part of the trial court evidence.
Finally, let me point to the question of does

15

the taxpayer get his money back.

look at this court's opinions about taxpayers contending

17

statutes or schemes were unconstitutional for interstate

18

commerce reasons, a whole range of reasons.

2

make sure they're all treated equal.
MR. GEORGE:

3

Well, I suppose the state has to

-- if it has a statute, it can repeal it and then solve

5

the problem, and you can't repeal -- I suppose you could

6

repeal the -- there is no equal protection in commerce

clause.

Obviously you can't tax it because in commerce
