ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL K. KELLOGG

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KELLOGG:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court.
Every employee of the National Security Agency

11
12

has to have a high level security clearance.

13

statutory requirement for employment at NSA.

That is a

The question at issue in this case is not what

14
15

happens to an employee who loses his clearance, for it

16

is clear that he has to be removed.

17

whether the clearance decision itself is subject to

18

judicial review.

19

decisions in Egan and Webster v. Doe will remain open on

20

remand.

21

Nor is the question

The application of this Court's

The question at issue today is simply what

22

procedures are to be followed by the agency in removing

23

an employee who loses his clearance.

24

After briefly stating the background of this

25

case, I will argue that there are three different ways

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

to remove the employee, and the agency is charged with

2

choosing the appropriate procedure in light of the

3

individual circumstances.

4

First, the employee can be removed for cause

5

for failure to maintain a required clearance after

6

following all the ordinary procedures afforded to

7

Federal employees dismissed for cause, including MSPB

8

review if the employee is a preference eligible veteran.

9

Second, the employee can be suspended and then

10

removed under the summary procedures of 5 U.S.C. 7532

11

following notice in a hearing if the Secretary of

12

Defense determines that the suspension and the removal

13

are in the interests of national security.

14

Finally, the employee can be removed without

15

any procedures whatsoever under 50 U.S.C. 833 if the

16

Secretary of Defense determines that that action is in

17

the interest of the United States and that none of the

18

other procedures can be invoked consistently with

19

national security.

20

Well, Respondent was employed at the National

21

Security Agency from 1968 until 1984.

In 1982 he

22

disclosed to NSA security officials that while on

23

vacation in foreign countries, he had engaged in

24

homosexual relations with foreign nationals.

25

subsequently received a notice of proposed removal on

the grounds that his continued access to classified

2

information was no longer clearly consistent with the

3

national security.
Pursuant to NSA regulations governing

for-cause removals, he was advised that he had a right

to respond, to obtain counsel.

access to classified information.

He was kept on paid

Respondent requested and received a

10

psychiatric evaluation in an effort to demonstrate that

11

he did not pose a security risk.

12

was convened to consider his case.

13

psychiatric report and Respondent's own statements, the

14

board concluded that Respondent had shown poor judgment,

15

that he was emotionally unstable and that he was living

16

beyond his means.

17

he was a poor security risk and recommended that his

18

clearance be revoked.

MR. KELLOGG:

Yes.

circumscribing its otherwise uncircumscribed authority -QUESTION:

And that is what they were acting

Their own regulations?
MR. KELLOGG:

18

That's correct.

NSA has

19

provided by regulation that NSA employees can only be

20

removed for cause, and it has provided procedural

21

protections to be used for for-cause removals including

22

notice and opportunity to respond and be represented by

23

counsel.

24

this case.

25

It is those procedures that were invoked in

QUESTION:

Mr. Kellogg, would you tell me what
6

ALDERSOIM REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

is the NSA regulation that required that the removal be

2

for cause?

3

MR. KELLOGG:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. KELLOGG:

Chapter 370 --

It's 370.
-- of the NSA regulations says

6

that removals are to be for such cause as will promote

7

the efficiency of the service.
QUESTION:

8
9

And is that -- is 370 in the

appendix of the cert petition?

10

MR. KELLOGG:

11

QUESTION:

Yes, it is.

Mr. Kellogg, doesn't Chapter 371 of

12

the regulations say that it applies to actions to limit

13

access to classified information and to suspend or

14

terminate personnel for reasons of national security?

15

MR. KELLOGG:

16

QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice O'Connor.

It looked to me reading through it,

17

frankly, like this was a 371 proceeding or should have

18

been.

19

violating their own regulations in doing that?

Maybe they proceeded under 370, but were they

MR. KELLOGG:

20

No, they were not, Justice

21

O'Connor.

Chapter 371 implements procedures for

22

clearing access of employees to classified information.

23

And it's correct that the clearance portion of what

24

happened to Respondent took place pursuant to Chapter

25

371.

But once the clearance is revoked, the question is
7

ALDERSOIM REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

how is the employee to be removed.

2

QUESTION:

Then it becomes cause.

3

MR. KELLOGG:

And then it becomes cause

4

because possession of a clearance is a statutory

5

requirement of employment at NSA.

6

an alternative mechanism for removing the employee.

7

implements 5 U.S.C. 7532, which permits the employee to

8

be summarily suspended without pay and then subsequently

9

removed if the director or if the head of the agency

Chapter 371 provides

10

determines that it's in the interest of national

11

security.
QUESTION:

12

I was a little troubled because

13

reading the regulations, it did seem to me that they

14

just didn't follow their own regulations.
MR. KELLOGG:

15

It

Well, I think that's not

16

correct. They were, in fact, very careful to state

17

precisely which portion of the regulations they were

18

following.

19

path you take depends upon the language you use in

20

notifying the employee.

21

suspend and remove you in the interest of national

22

security pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 7532, then they would have

23

had to follow 371.

24
25

There are different paths here and which

QUESTION:

If they had said we propose to

So, you say this is not a national

security case as defined in the preamble to the
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

regulations.
MR. KELLOGG:

2

That's correct.

It's certainly

3

true that national security is implicated.

4

he lost his clearance is that it was no longer clearly

5

consistent with the national security for him to have a

6

clearance.

7

for failure to satisfy his statutory condition of his

8

employment.

9

The reason

But the reason he was removed was for cause

Now, the Court of Appeals held that the

10

authority of the Director of NSA to remove employees for

11

cause is circumscribed by 5 U.S.C. 7532 which the court

12

says expressly controls terminations in the interest of

13

national security.

14

reversed the proper relation between 7532 and ordinary

15

for-cause procedures.

16

And we think the Court of Appeals

Seventy-five thirty-two by its own terms is an

17

optional, not a mandatory, procedure.

18

the Secretary may suspend and remove an employee

19

pursuant to its procedures, but it does purport to lay

20

down a mandatory procedure for every case.

21

It states that

It also says that 7532 can be used

22

notwithstanding other statutes, but nothing precludes

23

actions taken pursuant to other statutes.

24

reference to other statutes only makes sense -- is

25

referring to provisions like the CSRA that provide

2

available under the summary procedures of 7532.

Does it -- is every 7532 suspension

That's correct.

Well, I don't think it would

have to be.

Because this one was not.

indicate that the suspension is what starts the whole

16

process going.

17

For example, in part B, it says you remove -- you
And that would seem to

But if the agency were to choose to suspend

18

him with pay or merely to suspend access to classified

19

information, I don't think anybody would object.

20
21

22

QUESTION:

They might not object, but they

wouldn't be following the statute if they did that.
It seems to me that this is something -- and

23

doesn't the agency head himself have to do the -- invoke

24

this procedure?

25

MR. KELLOGG:

That's correct.

The head of the

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

agency has to make the decision himself.

2

QUESTION:

Well, okay.

3

MR. KELLOGG:

The point is that Section 7532

4

is not an employee protection statute.

5

standards to be used in suspending and removing

6

employees.

7

using 7532 is an open question, but not particularly

8

germane to the question at issue.

14

Under 7532, isn't the ultimate

decision the Secretary rather than the agency?

11

Whether the agency could go beyond those in

QUESTION:

9

It sets minimum

No, that's correct.

The

Secretary does not.
Subsequent to the Court of Appeals' decision

19

20

in this case, the Director of NSA was designated by

21

executive order as the head of an agency for purposes of

22

7532.

23

would be making the decision, not the Secretary of

24

Defense.

25

So, in any subsequent cases, the Director himself

under 7532.

2

MR. KELLOGG:

3

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Of course, he did that because

4

under the Court of Appeals' holding, that's all he could

5

do

6

MR. KELLOGG:

7

QUESTION:

8

That's correct.

-- because they eliminated the

avenue of discharge that you rely on.
MR. KELLOGG:

9
10

QUESTION:

11

MR. KELLOGG:

That's correct.

Yes.
And so, it would have to go back

12

and he would have to do it again under 7532 or under

13

833.

That's an option as well.
QUESTION:

14

But 833 has got that condition on

15

its use that none of the other procedures would be

16

adequate.
MR. KELLOGG:

17

That's correct.

It states --

18

it's sort of the most extreme, the most restrictive

19

provision.
QUESTION:

20

But what has happened here already

21

would seem to indicate you never could satisfy that

22

condition.
MR. KELLOGG:

23
24
25

Not that you could never satisfy

it.
QUESTION:

Yes.

in which 833 would be appropriate.
QUESTION:

4

There could certainly be cases
For example --

Well, I agree with that, but in

this case, I don't see how you could ever use 833.
MR. KELLOGG:

5

Oh, I don't think 833 would be

6

appropriate in this case.

7

would be appropriate either unless -QUESTION:

8
9

Well, 833 is really an emergency

dismissal provision.

10

MR. KELLOGG:

11

QUESTION:

12

I don't really think 7532

That's correct, as is --

And we don't -- that's why it's not

applicable here.

13

MR. KELLOGG:

No, we do not have an emergency.

14

Section 7532 is an emergency provision as

15

well.

The legislative history of 7532 focused on the

16

Lloyd-La Follette Act and the Veteran's Preference Act

17

and the procedures provided to Federal employees

18

dismissed for cause under that statute.

19

procedure is necessary in certain extreme and emergency

20

circumstances to cut through --

QUESTION:

22

MR. KELLOGG:

23

QUESTION:

It said this

You are speaking now of 7532.
That's correct.

And your position is that it also

24

is only an emergency provision that's not applicable

25

here.
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

MR. KELLOGG:

1

Well, I'm not saying that it

2

couldn't have been used here.

Certainly NSA's mission

3

is so sensitive that any employee for whom it is not

4

clearly consistent with the national security for him to

5

have a clearance, it is probably also in the interest of

6

national security to remove that employee.

7

But I think the three provisions --

QUESTION:

9
10

What were you suggesting when you

answered Justice White earlier?

That there might have

to be a remand for reconsideration under 7532?
MR. KELLOGG:

11
12

upheld.

13

do it again under 7532.

That's what they said.

QUESTION:

14

If the Court of Appeals were
You have to go back and

But really there's a different

15

standard under 7532 than there is under the National

16

Security Agency.

17

not the super emergency, 833, but the regular emergency

18

-- it has to be necessary in the interest of national

19

security.

In order to invoke that emergency --

20

MR. KELLOGG:

21

QUESTION:

That's correct.

But you can deny a security

22

clearance without meeting that standard.

23

to find is it's not clearly consistent with national

24

security that this man have access to NSA materials.

25

MR. KELLOGG:

All you have

QUESTION:

2

MR. KELLOGG:

3

But they're different standards.
And once that you find that it's

not clearly consistent, the statute --

4

QUESTION:

Then you have cause.

5

MR. KELLOGG:

-- requires the employee be

6

removed.

But that doesn't necessarily mean that you

7

have to invoke Section -QUESTION:

8
9

Mr. Kellogg, you know you're going

to be arguing in another case that it's not consistent

10

with national security to give access to classified

11

information to someone as to whom it is not clearly

12

consistent that he can have that information.

13

the two really boil down to the same.
MR. KELLOGG:

14

I mean,

Well, no, I don't think they do.

15

For example, in a number of agencies, you don't even

16

have to have a clearance necessarily to work in that

17

agency.

clearance.

19

Every employee at NSA has to have a security

QUESTION:

Yes, but where you have a security

20

clearance, I'm sure you would say that unless someone

21

clearly can be trusted with access to the classified

22

information, it's not -- it's necessary in the interest

23

of national security not to let him have that classified

24

information.

25

MR. KELLOGG:

Well, I think that might well

follow, Justice Scalia.
The three statutory procedures for removing

2
3

employees in these circumstances form sort of a pyramid

4

where the for-cause procedures are the base and cover

5

the broadest ground.

6

finally the smallest compass and the most extreme case,

7

Section 833.
The lines of demarcation between those

8
9

Then comes Section 7532, and

procedures are not clear-cut, and much is left to the

10

discretion of the agency to choose which one is

11

appropriate in an individual case, but as a general

12

principle, the for-cause procedures are to be used

13

unless there's some reason why they shouldn't be used

14

such as, for example, the employee can't be told the

15

precise reasons why he's being removed.

16

would reveal a source of information that must remain

17

secret.

18

Perhaps it

In those circumstances, Section 7532 would be

19

appropriate because it provides for a statement of

20

reasons only to the extent that national security

21

permits; whereas, under the for-cause procedures you

22

have to give him a complete statement of reasons.

23

The premise of the Court of Appeals' decision

24

and of Respondent's argument appears to be that he would

25

have received more procedures under 7532 than he

QUESTION:

(Inaudible)

MR. KELLOGG:

Secretary's decision.

That's correct.

The Secretary

4

of Defense, under the prior procedures would have been

5

involved if 7532 had been invoked, but he would also

6

have been suspended without pay for 16 months.

7

have received notice only to the extent consistent with

the national security.

He would

He would have had no right to

He would have had a single hearing of

unspecified scope.

11

remove him, he would have been ineligible for any other

12

position in the Department of Defense and for any other

13

job elsewhere in government without OPM specifically

14

saying that he's eligible.

15

And if a decision were made to

Now, that contrasts sharply with what he

16

actually received, which was 16 months of pay, notice

17

and opportunity to respond, counsel, several layers of

18

intra-agency review,

19

the Director of NSA and a recommendation that the agency

20

try to find his employment elsewhere where a clearance

21

was not required.

including a personal meeting with

QUESTION:

When did his pay stop?

23

MR. KELLOGG:

His pay stopped on the date of

his removal when the final decision was made by the

1

The only person who would be better off if

2

Section 7532 became the standard means for removing

3

people who lose their security clearance is Respondent

4

because he got all the other procedures.

5

would be worse off.

6

Everybody else

There are any number of reasons why the agency

7

might determine that someone's access to classified

8

information is no longer clearly consistent with the

9

Section 7532 or even Section 833 would be appropriate.

But it's important to note that it's in the

agency's own interest to provide its employees with as

much protection as possible to avoid any arbitrary or

5

unnecessary removals and to give the employee himself a

sense that he's being treated fairly because a

disgruntled ex-employee with classified information

poses a grave security risk.
The ultimate irony of the Court of Appeals'

MR. GILL:

18
19
20

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court.
We respectfully submit that the decision by

21

the District of Columbia Circuit be affirmed because of

22

the plain language of the statute, its legislative

23

history, a pertinent executive order, the pertinent

24

Department of Defense directive, NSA's own regulations,

25

and the clear mandate of this Court's trilogy of

First of all, I need to emphasize that the

4

mandatory procedures that are at issue in this case are

6

keyed to removal or termination.

7

government's papers about suspension, and that, indeed,

8

11

Much is made in the

But -- and I think this is the answer to

12
13

Justice Stevens' question about was he suspended without

15

rights.

16

The suspension is discretionary, but once you

17

get to removal, these procedures are mandatory.

18

mere fact that the government paid him for some more

19

months should not, we submit, obviate his

is the only option if it's truly an interest of national

QUESTION:

14

I understand that's your position.

15

All I'm saying is the plain language of the statute

16

doesn't say that.
MR. GILL:

17

That's all.
Well, we point out in the -- most

started out:

"This is a notice to remove you from your

23

24

25

Our point is that it was

The government's entire for-cause argument

2

depends on Chapter 370, which is their inherent

3

authority for-cause procedures.

4

simplest answer to this, as Justice O'Connor has already

5

pointed out, is it -- they didn't use the 370

standards.

7

Court of Appeals' Appendix 67, Subsection 3-2 reads:

8

Now, this is very important language because

3

the government's argument seems to intertwine cause with

4

the taking away of a security clearance, the taking away

5

of access to classified information.

6

371 says 371 applies when you either terminate or

7

circumscribe someone's access to classified information.

8

So, by NSA's own regulation, this is the procedure

9

that's to be used, and this procedure later on mandates

My point is that when you use 371,

you get your 7532 procedures.

That's in that

10

regulation, and it mandates review at the Secretary of

11

So, the fact that they used the 371 standard

is very important.
