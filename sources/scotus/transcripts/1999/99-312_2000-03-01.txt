CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Dedra Shanklin.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PHILLIPS:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
7 years ago in CSX v. Easterwood this Court held

11

12

that when the provisions of 23 C.F.R. 646.213(b)(3) and

13

(b)(4), which from now on I am going to refer to as (b)(3)

14

and (b)(4), because otherwise I won't get any of my

15

argument out, quote, are applicable, State tort law is

16

preempted.

17

Specifically, the Court identified the sine qua

18

non of preemption as whether, quote, Federal funds

19

participate in the installation of warning devices at the

20

particular site.

21

appropriate in that context because the determination of

22

what type of warning device to be installed at a

23

particular crossing is in those circumstances, quote,

24

subject to the Secretary's approval.

25

Preemption, the Court held, was

The Court expressly recognized that under that

1

particular regulatory scheme the Secretary has decided the

2

means by which railroads are to participate in the

3

selection of a particular device and thus, when

4

applicable, the Secretary's regulations cover the subject

5

matter of tort law regarding the adequacy of the

6

particular devices within the meaning --

7

QUESTION:

Well, has the Secretary determined

8

the devices to be installed here, or is it just some

9

minimum program we're dealing with?
MR. PHILLIPS:

10

This is not a minimum program,

11

Justice O'Connor.

12

(b)(3) refers specifically to any project, which means

13

that if Federal funds are involved it is subject to the

14

approval of the Secretary on the same standards as any

15

other project that happens to be submitted for the

16

Secretary's approval, and on the same standards.

17

QUESTION:

All of -- the program is the program.

I somehow had the impression that we

18

were dealing here with a crossing that had crossbucks

19

installed under the minimum program for a State.

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

21

QUESTION:

22

I think it's important --

In this case, Tennessee.

Is that

right?

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

No, okay.
That's absolutely wrong, Justice

1

O'Connor, on two counts, one a matter of law, and one is a

2

matter of fact.

3

there is no such thing as a minimum protection program

4

that is distinct under (b)(1) from the projects, from the

5

any projects that are referenced in (b)(3).

6

specifically has the heading, adequate warning devices,

7

and it is designed to ensure that all projects that

8

receive Federal funds are in fact approved, and that the

9

Secretary has at least available the option to say no,

The legal problem with the argument is,

10

additional safety is required in a particular

11

circumstance.

12

(b)(3)

The fact that the Secretary doesn't do that

13

routinely is simply a reflection of the respect that the

14

Secretary has in the way the States operate --

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

17

21

Mr. Phillips --- the section 130 program.

I'm

sorry, Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

Where do we find (b)(1) and (b)(3)

set out in the -- in your brief, or somewhere else?
MR. PHILLIPS:

It's in the appendix to the

petition, Mr. Chief Justice, at pages 46a and 47a.

22

QUESTION:

Thank you.

23

QUESTION:

Is it your position that preemption

24

occurs when the devices are installed and the -- pursuant

25

to the Federal program, and the money's paid?

MR. PHILLIPS:

1
2

5

I think both of those are

probably required in any given circumstance.
QUESTION:

3
4

Yes.

That's the point at which preemption

occurs?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

At that point, preemption

6

occurs, and at that point as well, of course, that

7

particular crossing we now know is part of this global 130

8

program that is designed to systematically,

9

comprehensively collect data, analyze each of the

10

crossings throughout the State, and make a determination

11

on a regular basis as to whether or not those crossings

12

are adequate on a going-forward basis.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, you started with

14

discussion of the Easterwood case, and that was a case

15

that held there was no preemption, yet you're using it to

16

support your position that there is preemption.

17

doubt that case held Federal assistance is necessary to

18

preemption, but it never homed in on the kind of crossing

19

protection involved here, that is, simply the sign.

20

was -- the Court was looking at an upgraded -- was it not?

21

It wasn't a simple sign, but it was some kind of a gate

22

that was involved?

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, Justice Ginsburg.

Now, no

There

What was

24

actually involved there, there was no evidence as to any

protections at the Cartersville -7

Yes, but the -There was --

It was originally a proposal not for

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

QUESTION:

Then that was transferred

No --

All -- my only point is that the

10

Court was not looking at what we have before us today.

11

That is, funding simply of a sign.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

Okay.

Again, there are two

13

answers to that, Justice Ginsburg.

14

not funding of a sign.

15

Tennessee -- Tennessee has a program, a quote, minimum

16

program that is Tennessee-specific, that is different,

17

that is unique to Tennessee.

18

has a project, but Tennessee decided to upgrade over what

19

is required specifically under section 130.

20

First of all, this is

What actually happened in

Every other State basically

Section 130 says, yeah, everybody should have a

21

sign at a crossing.

Tennessee went beyond that and said,

22

you have to have reflectorized crossbucks, and you have to

23

have a warning sign at every crossing.

24

beyond the Federal minimum, and that is exactly what was

25

placed on all of the projects that were involved in the

That is above and

2

1987 Federal funding.
That's the scheme in place here.

Now, that's

3

the factual distinction which says, this is not -- even if

4

you want to work off of a notion that there's a minimum

5

sign program, which I don't think is incorporated into

6

this regulatory scheme, it wouldn't apply here.

7

more -- but over and above that, it's clear that this

8

regulatory scheme envisions that the Secretary will pay

9

money and then be responsible, along with the State on a

But the

10

prospective basis for ensuring the safety and the

11

protection of the citizens who have to make -- who have to

12

go across those particular crossings, and the Court

13

understood that when it set out the legal framework to be

14

applied in this particular context.

15
16
17

To be sure, the Court held there was no Federal
funding at that particular site.
QUESTION:

It held there was no preemption, and

18

I'm a little troubled at the idea of taking a case that

19

held there was no preemption in that case to establish

20

beyond question that there is preemption in a case that

21

was not before the Court.

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I wouldn't be so bold as to

23

tell you that there's no basis for rethinking the wisdom

24

of the basic analysis in Easterwood, but the reality of

25

what happened in Easterwood is, the Solicitor General

1

described this exact scheme and said that this is a --

2

that this prospective approach will work perfectly well,

3

it is exactly what Congress wanted, but the key is to make

4

sure that each individual grade crossing is embraced by

5

this scheme, and you can only be assured of that once you

6

have Federal funding, or that Federal moneys participate

7

in the installation of the devices for any project under

8

(b) (3) .
QUESTION:

9

If the Secretary decided that it

10

would be desirable to have every crossing meet at least a

11

minimum standard, there would be no way to do that without

12

affecting preemption, in your view?
MR. PHILLIPS:

13

I think if the Secretary spends

14

the money under the program that's set up today, under the

15

(b)(3),

16

Secretary would necessarily have to review the moneys that

17

are being spent and ensure that those projects are being

18

done in a safe fashion, and then rely on the States,

19

subject to Federal approval as well, because it's all

20

federally funded, to ensure the future safety of them.

(b)(4) program that exists today, then the

QUESTION:

21

But he couldn't -- the Secretary

22

couldn't say, in your view, we don't want to engage in

23

that kind of detailed analysis, we just want to say

24

universally every crossing will have at least the minimum

25

sign?

MR. PHILLIPS:

1

I think the answer to that

2

problem would be that the Secretary ought to change the

3

regulations so that they no longer define adequate warning

4

devices at all projects for which Federal funds are

5

involved.

6

8

QUESTION:

Under these regulations the

Secretary -MR. PHILLIPS:

I think if they want to get out

of that they could do that.
10

QUESTION:

-- the Secretary could not do that.

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

12

QUESTION:

I'm sorry?

Under these regulations, the

13

Secretary could say -- couldn't say, without looking at

14

any particular crossing, we are going to require every

15

crossing to have at least the minimum.

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's correct.

The way this is

17

set up at this point, it specifically says any project,

18

and I think that language necessarily means that if you're

1

allowing Federal funds to participate, regardless of how

20

you do it, you preempt State law.

21

I want to be clear about this, though, and it's

22

the reason why Easterwood is a sensible approach to this

23

problem, is, it doesn't mean that people are left

24

unprotected.

25

Solicitor General and the respondent in this case.

That's the suggestion made by both the

The point here is that the States have a

1

2

continuous obligation, and the railroads have a continuous

3

obligation to update information about each one of these

4

grade crossings, the information that they have available.

probably harsh.

approval of the Secretary of Transportation, and then you

2

get the benefit of the entire -QUESTION:

3

So you're saying that having

4

persuaded us that that was correct, the Solicitor General

5

now wants to persuade us that it's not correct?
MR. PHILLIPS:

6

I think the Solicitor General

7

could fairly be described as having come up the hill to

8

ask you to come back down the hill -QUESTION:

9

Well, it's a different Solicitor

10

General, too, isn't it?

11

General?
MR. PHILLIPS:

QUESTION:

MR. PHILLIPS:

16

My -- yes, Your Honor, there is a

different Solicitor General.

14
15

Isn't it a different Solicitor

Well, I -- no question about

that, Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

18

Yes.

May I ask just sort of a basic

19

question?

Normally when we have sort of a preemption here

20

the railroads contribute something.

21

money to do something, and in exchange they get the

22

exemption from tort liability, but here it's rather odd,

23

because as I understand from your brief the incentive to

24

put in the safety devices for the railroads isn't -- is

25

not -- tort liability doesn't provide a sufficient

They pay a lot of

13

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

1

incentive, because the cost of installation exceeds their

2

potential liability.

You say that in your brief.

And here it's rather unusual because the

3
4

Government provides the money and with it provides total

5

preemption and protection for the railroads, and the

6

railroads get two benefits at no cost.

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

But that -- and the reason for

8

that -- I mean, it's not as though this is -- I mean, the

9

reason why there's no cost to the railroads is that

10

there's no real benefit to the railroad because first of

11

all, you know, having grade crossings does no benefit to

12

the railroad.

13

close those roads so they don't go across the railroad, so

14

that part of it, allowing them to keep going across

15

doesn't provide any benefit.

16

If the railroad had its choice, it would

The safety that you're trying to provide -- and

17

that's why the Federal Government doesn't require, and

18

expressly limits the amount the railroads can be made to

19

pay for these particular projects, because they recognize

20

the beneficiary of this particular program are the people,

21

are the users of the highway, not the users of the

22

railroad.

23

But the reason why it ends up with the

24

particular situation you've described, Justice Stevens, is

25

the nature of the relatively unique statutory preemption

1

under 201.06 in title 49.

There, Congress made it clear

2

that when the Secretary has adopted a requirement, then

3

that preempts State law, and all that the Solicitor

4

General's position and the Court held in CSX was that in

5

this particular context, with the funding that we've made,

6

it was subject to the approval, that creates a requirement

7

that triggers covering the subject matter under the

8

preemption provision, which is how you end up there.
I think in that -- I'm sorry.

9

QUESTION:

10

Just on this, go back for a second to

11

the regulation,

(b)(4).

I take it that the problem has

12

arisen because most of the time you're telling me

13

everywhere but Tennessee.

14

Secretary gives money, or at least a lot of the time,

15

they'll use it to make signs, or they'll use it to make

16

bells, or they use it to make gates or tunnels or

17

something, and normally somebody in authority, whether

18

it's Federal or State, considers that to be adequate.

Most of the time that the

But sometimes money is taken where we're just

19
20

going to do this quickly, a quick sign, and we're not

21

saying it's adequate, we're saying it's minimum, and here

22

it's Tennessee that says that, and maybe they're the only

23

ones ever to say it.

24

it right?

25

That's true, isn't it?

MR. PHILLIPS:

wanted to have a minimum protection program -QUESTION:

Okay, so maybe nobody else ever does,

3

but our problem is, it makes tremendous sense to preempt

4

something, where somebody in authority has said this is

5

adequate, so keep the private plaintiffs out of it.

6

doesn't seem to make very much sense to do it when they're

the Secretary's approval, and if the Secretary's not

MR. COLEMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Why should we allow a preemption if you're just putting in

crossbucks without any independent determination of

10
11

The main concern here is, what are you doing?

whether that's good enough?
And the reason that that should not be a concern

12

to this Court is that the respondents and the United

13

States are attempting to get the Court to look at this

14

particular aspect of the crossings program, when you go

15

through and make sure that all the crossings have at least

16

crossbucks.

What they're forgetting about is the rest of

Part 924 requires the States to have a

19

prioritization scheme which collects astounding amounts of

20

data about each of these crossings.

Where do we find 924?

22

MR. COLEMAN:

It's in the same -- 23 C.F.R. 6 --

part 924 generally describes the process by which you

24

create, or collect the data about the crossings and then

25

crunch it through, and you have a prioritization scheme.

really look at it, it's not a great crossing, and people

have been hurt there, and somebody would like to sue the

railroad because they think the railroad should have done

11

a better job itself, and why should the fact that you

happen to put a crossbucks up when the plaintiff is going

to say, that's woefully inadequate, stop the plaintiff

from suing just because maybe 15 years from now you're

MS. MILLETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
For 25 years, the Secretary has administered the
minimum warning sign requirement in section 130(d), a

10

congressional mandate, as a distinct program separate and

11

apart from its regulatory scheme under (b)(3) and (b)(4)

12

that determines what level of protection is adequate at an

13

individual crossing to make it safe.

QUESTION:

Ms. Millett, would this have been

minimum program -- it was a situation where individual

The exception is the minimum protection program.
QUESTION:

3

All right.

Now, the problem that I

4

have in drawing the distinction that you're drawing is

5

this, and it's essentially the problem that I have with

6

your argument from 25 years of administrative experience.

7

In Easterwood, which was what, 7 or 8 years ago,

8

this Court laid down -- wisely or unwisely it laid down a

9

preemption rule, and the preemption rule turned on the

10

participation of Federal funds, and the formulation that

11

the Court used, if I remember correctly, was just about

12

exactly what the Solicitor General at the time said was

13

the formulation we ought to use.

14

It seems to me that at that point the Federal

15

Highway Administration had some kind of an obligation to

16

say, if the Court means what it says in adopting the

17

language which we told it to adopt, there's no longer a

18

distinction between minimum programs under (d), whatever

19

it is (d), and the subsection (3) and subsection (4)

20

programs.

simple rule, announced by this Court for 7 or 8 years ago,

2

and I don't know why that does not trump the

3

administrative experience that you refer to that preceded

4

it.
MS. MILLETT:

5

Two answers.

First is, we don't

6

read Easterwood as making everything turn on Federal

7

funding and, in fact, the Court didn't.

8

funding of the crossing.

9

The question is -- the question in Easterwood that this

10

Court adopted I think was a quite pragmatic and correct

11

rule that was consistent with our position here, and that

12

is, was money spent to make an individual crossing safe?

13

They tried to argue in Easterwood, well, there

14

was a grouping here of crossings, and that was enough to

15

make it safe, and this Court said the program cast doubt

16

on that, that the individual crossing hadn't been made

17

safe with the Federal funds.

QUESTION:

Ms. Millett --

QUESTION:

Do you distinguish between making a

crossing safe and making it less unsafe?
MS. MILLETT:

12

Well, what -- for purposes of

13

(b)(3) and (b)(4) what adequate warning devices are, are

14

designed to address what makes an individual crossing safe

15

in the same way that State law had for hundreds of years

16

before.

17

The question is whether that has been displaced.

18

When -- in Easterwood you set up a rule that said, when

1

there's been Federal funding on a particular crossing that

20

makes that crossing safe, we will not allow -- we'll have

21

preemption because you don't want a jury second-guessing

If there is this two-

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

6

Obviously concerned that the Court may actually

7

conclude that what it said is what it meant in Easterwood,

8

the Government and the respondents have asked you to

9

create an entirely different regulatory scheme, and that

10
11

is a scheme that no one has ever seen or identified.
There is no regulatory footprints.

There are no

12

regulatory fingerprints that even remotely suggest that

13

there is a distinction between a minimum safety program

14

and the (b)(3)-(b)(4) adequate warning program which is

15

the basis on which this Court decided preemption would

16

turn in Easterwood.

17

And I would ask the Court to look at 130(d),

18

which is the basis for the minimum safety program the

19

Government identifies, and recognize that the language of

130(d), which is at 42a of the appendix to the petition,

21

at a minimum such a schedule -- it doesn't say anything

-- that the floor is in the

8

regulations, that there's no lack of statutory authority

9

for the Secretary to do what Mr. Goldstein contends the

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think there's clearly statutory

12

authority, and I think it's important to recognize that

13

(b)(3) and (b)(4) are designed to implement 109, which is

14

what's going to preserve the Government's ability to

15

decide what State, and what it's going to fund, and if the

16

Secretary chooses to apply that in a different way, that's

17

fine, but that's not the system that the Secretary

employed in this particular case, and it's not the system

19

the Court identified in Easterwood.

QUESTION:

What do you do with the argument that

109 only applies to Federal aid highways?
MR. PHILLIPS:

109 -- well, first of all,

23

there's a serious question about whether they intend that,

24

but the bottom line about 109 is, the regulation still

25

implements 109.

Adequate is adequate for both of those,
