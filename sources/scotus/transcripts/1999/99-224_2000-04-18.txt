ORAL ARGUMENT OF JON LARAMORE

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS MILLER, ET AL.

12

MR. LARAMORE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The case addresses the automatic stay provision

13

of the Prison Litigation Reform Act.

14

United States Code section may be found at page 1 of the

15

appendix to our certiorari petition.

The full text of the

The automatic stay is designed to effectuate
other provisions of the PLRA -QUESTION:

Mr. Laramore, let me ask you one

19

procedural question.

The State's motion to terminate this

20

injunction was filed in 1997?

21

MR. LARAMORE:

22

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

And in your brief you say it's set

23

for hearing on the merits in June of 2000.

24

explanation for the 3-year delay in that?

25

MR. LARAMORE:

Is there any

That hearing date was then -- the initial

15

December, and it's now been extended until June of this

16

year.

QUESTION:

Did you request --

18

QUESTION:

Why didn't you ask for mandamus?

19

MR. LARAMORE:

Our -- our appeal was pending at

20

that point in -- on the merits of the automatic stay

21

issue, and we chose not to go the mandamus route given how

22

procedurally complex that would have made the case at that

23

point.

24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Laramore, did you ask the

district court to proceed during the pendency of the

appeal to the Seventh Circuit?
MR. LARAMORE:

2

We did not formally make that

3

request of the district court.

4

QUESTION:

You didn't ask the district court.

5

You truly have no basis for going to mandamus a court to

6

do something that you didn't ask it to do.

7

MR. LARAMORE:

Well, that's right, and we -- it

8

was our understanding that the district court -- without

9

it having made a formal request, that the district court

10

wanted to wait until the appeal was concluded.
QUESTION:

11
12

Well, I suppose you had no interest

in having the case mooted, did you?

13

MR. LARAMORE:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. LARAMORE:

20

That would have perhaps mooted

this case -QUESTION:

18
19

Which would have been the situation I

suppose if the district court had proceeded --

16
17

Well, we are interested in --

-- and -- and had given you what you

wanted.
MR. LARAMORE:

That would have perhaps mooted

21

this automatic stay issue, although perhaps not under the

22

doctrine of capability of repetition but evading review.

23

At any rate, the automatic stay is designed to

24

give district courts incentives to move quickly on motions

25

to terminate injunctions in prison cases.

The Seventh

1

Circuit invalidated the automatic stay, found it violating

2

-- found it to violate separation of powers concepts.

3

the automatic stay is constitutional for several reasons.

But

First, the automatic stay does not affect the

4
5

underlying judgment.

6

way district courts' prospective equitable power, and it

7

only does so after the district court already has had 90

8

days to act on the motion to vacate or the motion to

9

terminate.

10

QUESTION:

It merely addresses in a temporary

Mr. Laramore, I didn't -- I know

11

that's your argument, but I didn't follow it entirely

12

because it seems to me if you suspend the decree and it

13

doesn't become operative again until all the findings that

14

have been made -- all the findings required by the new act

15

had been made, how is that different from just starting

16

fresh and making those findings?

17

suspended is kind of a euphemism for terminated because

18

you don't get it back again unless you establish what you

19

would have to establish to get a decree under the new law

20

in the first place.

21

MR. LARAMORE:

It seems to me to say

It is correct that the injunction

22

only continues if the district court finds that it's

23

necessary to correct an ongoing constitutional violation.

24

So, you're correct in that sense.

25

And -- and the point I'm making is a -- a

1

formalistic point in a sense that it's -- that the

2

judgment is not -- that the automatic stay does not act

3

directly on the judgment, but acts only on the district

4

court's prospective equitable powers.

the prisoners are not able to take advantage of the

And the rest is remediation.

11

MR. LARAMORE:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

What it prescribes to remedy that

13

violation is -- is not -- is not part of the judgment.

14

It's part of the remedy I assume.

15

MR. LARAMORE:

16

QUESTION:

It is part of the remedy, yes.

But it's part of the judgment too.

17

That's what the judgment is.

18

doesn't it?

MR. LARAMORE:

QUESTION:

It includes the injunction,

I never heard of this suggested

you agree with that, then -- then you must retract your

position is that Congress has the power to change the

judgment is quite accurate here.

A judgment traditionally

2

-- it's -- you get a money judgment from -- from a common

3

law court.

4

court of equity, which -- you know, that's more like the

5

Rufo case --

I think traditionally you get a decree from a

6

MR. LARAMORE:

7

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- which came up from the First

8

Circuit, rather than like the Plaut case which I think was

9

a -- a j udgment.
MR. LARAMORE:

10
11

Yes, I think that's exactly

right.

12

And -- and --

13

QUESTION:

But just to explore this a little

14

further, let's suppose the lawsuit was brought by the

15

prisoners and it was determined by the court that the

16

prison was putting six people in a single cell room that

17

would properly hold only two and that it was a violation

18

of the Constitution, making it cruel and unusual

19

punishment, and further, that the prison was providing

20

only 1,000 calories of food a day, whereas to sustain

21

normal weight and life, 2,000 calories a day were

22

required.

Now, let's just take that as an example.

23

Finding a constitutional violation and entering

24

a decree that that must be remedied by reducing it to two

25

people to a cell and increasing the food.

1

Now, you say that Congress can come in and

2

automatically end that order for relief based on the

3

motion by the State, that that's okay, that that does not

4

invoke the concerns that the Court expressed in Plaut with

5

interference with the judgment of a court in a decided

6

case.

7

MR. LARAMORE:

Justice O'Connor, I -- I think I

8

would describe our position somewhat differently than

9

that.

We say that it's appropriate for Congress to -- to

10

change the remedial law as it has done here and to require

11

the courts to apply the changed remedial law to existing

12

decrees.

13

And how that would apply in -- in the case that

14

you describe is that the State would make a motion and it

15

would say, we no longer need to have this injunction that

16

says we can only have two people in a cell and -- and

17

2,000 calories --

18

QUESTION:

Well, you don't have to say anything.

19

You -- all you have to do is file a motion under this PLRA

20

and say, we file a motion to terminate the ongoing relief.

21

Right?

22

MR. LARAMORE:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. LARAMORE:

25

Right.

Okay.
And that shifts the burden.

That's where the substantive change has occurred in this

case.
QUESTION:

2

Well,

in -- in your answer to Justice

3

O'Connor that -- that you just gave explaining the

4

authority of the Congress to,

5

modify the terms of the decree,

6

use the term prospective.

7

not to do that.

8

this is --

for want of a better term,
I kept waiting for you to

And you seemed almost careful

I -- I thought you were going to say that

MR. LARAMORE:

No.

I certainly didn't avoid

that on purpose.

11

QUESTION:

-- this is a prospective --

12

MR. LARAMORE:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- operation of -- of a statute.

It

14

does not undo previously adjudicated rights in the sense

15

that a money judgment would be --

16

MR. LARAMORE:

17
18

That's exactly right, Justice

Kennedy.
And -- and, of course, this is a prospective

19

statute in that it applies to any decrees entered in the

20

future as -- and -- and Congress has also set up the

21

mechanism to apply the same standards to decrees that are

22

already in existence --

23

QUESTION:

But, Mr. Laramore, it seems to me

24

that in order for you to prevail, you have to establish

25

the initial proposition that constitutional issues aside,

1

which Congress lets the court resolve during that

0-day

2

period -- constitutional issues aside, Congress has the

3

power to eliminate a remedy that has been prospectively

4

imposed by a court.

5

doesn't contain a constitutional problem.

Let me pose a simple example that

Suppose Congress passes a law that says that

6

7

Federal courts will not have authority to impose

8

injunctions against competition in any cases under Federal
statutes alleging violation of some -- some business --

10

business rights, that in the future, Federal courts will

11

not have the power to enjoin competition.

12

MR. LARAMORE:

13

QUESTION:

All right?

Yes.

And the statute specifically says,

14

any injunctions already in effect, enjoining competition

15

for the future, will be dissolved.
MR. LARAMORE:

16

Is that law valid?

Plainly I think the prospective

17

portion of it applying to injunctions not yet issued is

18

valid.

1

QUESTION:

20

MR. LARAMORE:

21

Oh, sure.
And then the question I think

becomes --

22

QUESTION:

Come on.

23

MR. LARAMORE:

Answer the hard question.

-- a formalistic one whether --

24

whether Congress may pass a law that says those

25

injunctions are no longer valid as -- as it did in the

Telecommunications Act as to some of the existing

2

injunctions, or whether it must do what it did in this

3

case, which is to say, courts must evaluate those

4

injunctions and apply the new standards to those

5

injunctions but -QUESTION:

6

Well, I don't think it has the power

to give the courts 90 days and say, if you don't do it in

Period.

That's -- that's my --

that's my point.

11

MR. LARAMORE:

12

QUESTION:

Well --

And you're not willing to say that it

13

has the power to invalidate them.

14

MR. LARAMORE:

It has the power to tell the --

15

and again, this is -- is perhaps too technical a way to

16

express it.

17

courts that they can no longer enforce those injunctions,

18

which may be the same as invalidating the injunctions.

But it has the power to tell the district

QUESTION:

19

You answered my question to say that

20

it was, once it's suspended, apart from the label.

21

like starting the case all over again.

It's

But to -- to continue Justice Scalia's line of

22

23

questioning, does the 30 days, extendable to 90 days, mean

24

anything?

25

have simply said, as of the day this new law goes into

effect, all bets are off, any prison litigation has to

2

start anew with a fresh complaint and meet the standards

3

that we set in this new law?

4
5
6

MR. LARAMORE:

Yes, as a matter of separation of

powers.
QUESTION:

So, is there anything on -- anything

7

that's constitutionally required by giving the district

8

court any time at all in your judgment?
MR. LARAMORE:

Well, Judge Easterbrook says in

10

-- in his dissent that there may be a due process element

11

involved here, although I suggest that that is not such an

12

issue here as long as there are other methods that

13

prisoners can use outside of this injunctive --

14

QUESTION:

Well, I --

15

MR. LARAMORE:

16

QUESTION:

-- to vindicate their rights.

-- prison litigation where the

17

finding has been made not just that there is a violation

18

of the Eighth Amendment, but that there is a violation of

1

the Eighth Amendment in this and that and the other

20

particular --

21

MR. LARAMORE:

Yes.

22

QUESTION:

23

And a court has made that finding, that it

-- as Justice O'Connor spelled out.

24

violates the Eighth Amendment in these particulars and

then Congress can say, never mind that.

I don't think that

6

anyone has questioned, at least in this litigation, the

7

(e)(1) of the statute that says, district courts, act

8

promptly and if you don't act promptly, you can be
mandamused by the court of appeals.

10

MR. LARAMORE:

QUESTION:

case is, you have 30 days or

Yes.

Is there anything -- any

There's no other statute that

we've found that acts in that way on an existing judgment.

17

QUESTION:

Yes.

18

MR. LARAMORE:

There are, of course, other

provisions with time limits that have consequences such as

Yes, but the result of the Speedy

from them.
MR. LARAMORE:

2

But I do want to highlight two

3

portions of the statute that seem to be missing from the

4

example that -- that you've given and that Justice

5

O'Connor maybe began.

Two things.

One is that this statute only applies at this

point to injunctions that are quite old.

8

is.

All of them must

time.

13

the prisoners would be back in court seeking enforcement,

14

seeking contempt and that sort of thing.

We would expect that either the prison has

QUESTION:

15

Yes, but that doesn't really answer

16

that, Justice Stevens, is that the standard of conduct is

MS. UNDERWOOD:

10

statement to deprive a court of its traditional equitable

11

powers, the PLRA's automatic stay,

12

remove a court's traditional equitable power to prevent

13

irreparable harm while an action is pending.

officials move under the PLRA to terminate prospective

15

relief, the

16

case if the termination motion can't be resolved in 30 or,

17

on extension,

purports to strip a court of its power to grant

19

extraordinary interim relief to either party if it finds

judgment of an Article III court without giving the court

2

any role in the process.

3

support this interpretation.

4

Several features of the statute

First, the words, automatic stay and the motion

5

shall operate as a stay, are commonly used to describe a

6

default rule for the normal case, the rule that governs

7

unless a court decides otherwise, not a rule that courts

8

can't change.

9

The bankruptcy stay was apparently the model for this.

There are other automatic stays in the law.

10

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure establish an automatic

11

10-day stay of judgment in many cases, and as one Senator

12

noticed in discussing this provision, it's common under

13

State law for the State to get an automatic stay pending a

14

government appeal.
QUESTION:

15

But none of -- none of these other

16

examples that you allude to were enacted for the very

purpose of inducing the court to which the stay applied to

litigation out of the way quickly.

MS. UNDERWOOD:

No.

the language, automatic stay, or the term, a motion shall

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, while we think it's

difficult, on balance, as we've said in our -- in our

21

brief, we think that it can be constitutionally defended

22

because it operates only on prospective relief and this

in answer to that question.

One is that the -- there are

The other thing I want to say about this notion

position -- if you don't want us to treat this as a -- as

We're also assuming in the 2-year example that

What's wrong with that?

I think that would be purely retroactive in the

Yes.

That -- that would be your

Well, I -- I don't agree with that.
MR. FALK:

And in light of that, we think this

18

is a violation of the separation of powers under Plaut

1

because Congress has commanded the reopening of a judgment

20

in violation of the separation of powers.

21

Also from a separation of powers standpoint, as

22

I indicated, this statute does invade the central

prerogative of the court, the ability to rule and decide

24

upon cases subject only to review by superior courts.

MR. FALK:

Isn't that correct?

It would wipe out the remedy that had
