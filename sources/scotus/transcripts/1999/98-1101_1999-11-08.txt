ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. TRAYLOR

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. TRAYLOR:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, members of the

Court, may it please the Court:
For our Socratic dialogue I am armed with a

12

13

borrowed Gideon and the fruit.

This is -- these aids go

14

right to the jugular of this case, and the genesis of the

15

case, which is Chapter 3 of Genesis.

16

What we have here is, when the serpent extended

17

the fruit to the offeree, free will said that the offeree

18

had a right to accept or reject the gift.

19

that offeree was a tax delinquent, the Government's

20

position is that their 6321 Federal tax lien attached at

21

the moment that the serpent extended the fruit.

MR. TRAYLOR:

1

that is where the case

I'm

starts, is with the idea of free will, that people have a

right to accept or reject a gift.

I don't believe that that's the law of this

Court, as announced by this Court.
QUESTION:

9

The Government don't

I don't believe --

Mr. Traylor, the Government is not

10

relying on the Good Book, but it is relying on title 26 of

11

the Internal Revenue Code and there the matter of

12

disclaimer is dealt with in the estate and gift tax

13

context, but it isn't -- the permission for a disclaimer

14

appears expressly in the estate and gift tax.
There is no such provision for the Tax Lien Act,

15
16

so the Government is saying, Congress did not choose to

17

provide for disclaimer in that context, so there is none.
MR. TRAYLOR:

18

What Congress said was that for

19

their tax lien to attach, the taxpayer must have property

20

or rights to the property.

21

instant of her death, the Government's position is that

22

Mr. Drye acquired a right to property, or property in her

23

estate.

24

it is not the law that this Court has pronounced.

When Mrs. Drye died, at the

at least the Eighth Circuit felt that way, that under

2

Arkansas law your client acquired a property interest upon

3

death, because he didn't remit it for a number of months

4

afterwards.

MR. TRAYLOR:

MR. TRAYLOR:

The law is very clear that the

You don't think, in the case of real

property, that the title went to the beneficiary --

MR. TRAYLOR:

Absolutely not.

Absolutely not.

Let me ask you this.

Did Mr. Drye

have a right to transfer whatever right he had to his

mother's estate before he acquired it --

MR. TRAYLOR:

He would acquire --

-- under Arkansas law?
-- acquire that right if, and only

if, he accepted, took a bite of the apple.

You don't think there's any way,

under Arkansas law, that before all of this happened, even

QUESTION:

That never happened.

Mr. Traylor, the district judge who,

10

I'm sure, must have been an Arkansas practicing lawyer

11

before he was appointed to the bench, found against you on

12

this point, and the court of appeals, which certainly

13

knows more about Arkansas law than we do, found against

14

you, saying that there was a property interest under

15

Arkansas law, so you have kind of a heavy burden to

16

persuade us otherwise.

17

MR. TRAYLOR:

18
19

Well, very simply, Judge Howard in

the Eighth Circuit got it backwards.
QUESTION:

They don't realize it, though.

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. TRAYLOR:

They will when this Court

22

instructs them what the fact of the matter is, and the

23

fact of the matter is that the Fifth -- the Fifth Circuit

24

and the Ninth Circuit on -- I'm on all fours in near

25

identical facts -- found just the opposite, on very recent

I don't think, Your Honor.

I

7

think that they found that the taxpayer in both States

8

never acquired an interest sufficient for a tax lien to
attach.

This is not really about the disclaimer and the

10

relation back.

11

in property, or property itself, that under Federal law is

12

sufficient.

It's whether anything ever vested, a right

Let me ask you this.

If the

administrator had announced that he was going to liquidate

15

the estate and take the money and go to Las Vegas and have

a good time, would you have had the right to do anything

MR. TRAYLOR:

Well,

administrator --

Would he have sat back and said, too

The administrator

Can he do anything about it?

Yes.

What?
He can accept -- he can take a

7

bite of the apple and go to State court and say, enjoin

8

that administrator from going to Las Vegas.
QUESTION:

9

And he would say, when he got to

10

court, would he not, I have a right to inherit that

11

property if I want to, and therefore he can't go to Las

12

Vegas with it?
MR. TRAYLOR:

14

He's bitten the apple, and he's --

the tax lien has attached.
QUESTION:

15

Let's assume you are representing

16

him, and he says, I'm not biting the apple, I am simply

17

asserting a right to bite the apple, haven't bitten yet.

18

Can he stop?
MR. TRAYLOR:

19

I believe that by -- that that

would be an act of acceptance by going to court and saying

that I am protecting my interest.

MR. TRAYLOR:

In their identical qualified

disclaimer for gift and generation -QUESTION:

that they didn't say it with respect to tax liens.

It's in the same book.

QUESTION:

It's not in the same subchapter.

11

MR. TRAYLOR:

A different subchapter.

I'm not a

tax expert, but I can tell you for sure that the model

13

probate code of which Arkansas, Texas, Arizona, North

14

Dakota, and by my count 30 other States have said that you

You have a vested interest.

Oh, I don't have a vested interest.

I have an ability --

QUESTION:

Because --

-- to assert an interest by agreeing

13

to exercise the option, but I don't have to agree to

14

exercise it.

15

MR. TRAYLOR:

Assuming the options are not

16

underwater, then that stock option is property or rights

17

to property for 6321 because it's transferable and has

18

pecuniary value.

1

QUESTION:

20

MR. TRAYLOR:

21

Transferable?
You could transfer the option to

another.

22

QUESTION:

No.

23

MR. TRAYLOR:

This is a nonassignable option.
The Government says

24

transferability, and I really don't care about -- but it

has pecuniary value.

Government would have sued us under the Federal Debt

By definition, a

In fact, that is what Judge Howard has called

MR. TRAYLOR:

2

He's solely in control.

Your Honor, it's been the common

3

law of England and this country, codified by statute in

4

Arkansas, until you take that bite of the apple, you do

5

not have a vested interest in her estate.
QUESTION:

6

That's, you say is the Arkansas law.

7

There are States, are there not, where a person in the

8

position of Mr. Drye would be deemed to have had the
property and then given it up.

10

MR. TRAYLOR:

11

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

And then -- so if we took your view

12

of it, it would depend which State you come from whether

13

the tax lien would attach.

14

MR. TRAYLOR:

That is correct, and one of the

15

beauties of our Federal system that different States

16

define their interest a little bit different.

MR. TRAYLOR:

This Court answered that question

very clearly in the National Bank of Commerce case, which

4

I believe to be the leading case on the question, and

States can't define what is or is not property.

MR. TRAYLOR:

10

For purposes of the Federal tax law.
Yes.

or is not property for purposes of Federal tax law?

11

MR. TRAYLOR:

12

QUESTION:

They cannot.

I thought our cases held just the

13

opposite, that the statute says if you have property the

14

Government can get it, but whether or not you have

15

property is up to State law.

16

MR. TRAYLOR:

You look at the interest under

17

State law, and then under National Bank of Commerce you

18

then look to see if that interest is property or rights to

1

property, and the definition primarily is, does it have

20

pecuniary value.

21

QUESTION:

The State law defines your rights,

22

but whether that bundle of rights, whatever it is, rises

23

to the level of being property under the Internal Revenue

24

Code is a matter of Federal law.

9

That's irrelevant, is that right?
MR. TRAYLOR:

My best answer is, you look in

depth at State law to ascertain what is the nature of the

10

interest or right under State law, and if you'll do that

11

in this example, you will find that Mr. Drye never

12

acquired an interest sufficient to be defined under

13

Federal law as property, or rights to property.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Traylor, I'm just curious about

This case does not involve an offer of a gift.

This case -- an offeree doesn't have any legal rights in

the proposed gift.

He can't enforce the offer.

This case

With that background, I'd like to now talk about

15

what the legal issue is.

16

scope of the Federal tax lien?

17

Internal Revenue Code creates a Federal lien in all

18

property and rights to property of any delinquent

19

taxpayer, and in a long series of cases, beginning with

20

the Glass City Bank case in 1945, the Court has plainly

questions.

QUESTION:

1

It's true that this is a little

2

unusual in that here you have the Arkansas statute, which

3

says for all purposes, once it's disclaimed, it

4

disappears.

5

which I guess for a lot of purposes of State law, even

6

after the expiration date, State law might have had some

7

bite.

I mean, there are all kinds of State laws.
So I looked up the bankruptcy law to see how

8

9

It's not like a stock option in that sense,

Federal law treats it.

It seems to me that under the

10

bankruptcy provisions this would not count as an interest

21

about it in much depth at all, I mean, what we're dealing

QUESTION:

15

MR. JONES:

Yes.
The reason that the disclaimers are

allowed if they're made within this window under -- for

17

purposes of the gift and estate tax, is to avoid imposing

18

a double tax on what's essentially a single flow-through.

19

But the reason that the Federal tax lien reaches

20

this property is because the taxpayer had that legally

21

enforceable right to decide what he wanted to do with it,

22

which was a valuable right, and the fairness interest that

23

I think Congress is concerned about under the Tax Lien Act

24

is the fairness of requiring taxpayers B, C, D, and E, to

25

pay more than their fair share to make up for the fact

in view of the comprehensive nature of the statutory

language that Congress employed, that this lien reaches

QUESTION:

MR. JONES:

-- if the testator revokes.
Right, so I mean, it would be very

3

hard to figure out what would be the value that the lien

4

would attach to.

5

But what I want to -- the point I keep heading

6

toward is that in National Bank of Commerce what the Court

7

said was that nothing more than common sense is required

8

to conclude that a right to receive property is itself a

9

interest in property that the lien attaches to, and that

10

is precisely the nature of the interest that the taxpayer

11

in this case has-.

12

13
14

QUESTION:

What is the legal error of the Fifth

Circuit right?
MR. JONES:

The Fifth Circuit in Leggett was

15

wrong exactly for the reasons I've just described.

16

Leggett, the Court said that the Federal lien doesn't

17

attach to this right to receive property because under

18

State law that is just a personal privilege, and it's not

19

a property interest for purposes of State law.

In

20

And that's flatly inconsistent with the two

21

fundamental holdings of the Court in National Bank of

22

Commerce, the first of which is that Federal law, not

23

State law, governs in deciding what's property under the

24

tax lien and, secondly, that the right to receive property

25

is property under the tax lien.

That's exactly what the Court held

What was the interest under Texas

Was it Texas the Fifth Circuit was deciding?
MR. JONES:

13

Yes.

It was -- I -- it was interest

14

under a will, but the principles of property that govern

15

the disposition of that interest are the same, whether

16

it's intestate or testate and, indeed, as we pointed out

17

in our brief, the State court -- I mean, I'm sorry, the

18

Fifth Circuit in Leggett seems to us to have erred in its

description of how State law operates, to say all they had

16

Indeed, you don't have to look further than the State's

disclaimer provisions to see that an assignment -- that

this interest can be assigned, because once you've

19

assigned it, you can then no longer disclaim it.

I see no

difference in the two cases, and I don't -- in other

property the assets of the estate, or is it, rather, this

6

The easiest way to answer it is by

7

reference to the Court's decision in the Phelps case.

The

Federal lien attaches to the property and to -- however it

9

is transferred, and to anything substituted for it, and

10

because of that, the lien exists at all phases of this --

I'm sorry, at all phases of this --

QUESTION:

MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

Well --- factual pattern.
But it seems to me that's too fast to

15

say the lien attaches to the property.

I agree, but what

1

transferred to the trust, and because it continued to

2

exist in these properties, the properties were lawfully-

3

seized for collection of taxes.

4

That's the fact pattern.

There was one other opinion of the court of

5

appeals that I do need to discuss, the Mapes decision in

6

the Ninth Circuit, which reached a similarly incorrect as

7

Leggett, but did it by a different route.

8

9

What the Court held in the Mapes case was that
the Federal lien doesn't attach to the taxpayer's right to

10

receive the estate, because once the taxpayer renounces

11

the interest, it's said to be renounced for all purposes

12

under State law, and the Court said, therefore the

13

taxpayer should be treated as if he never owned an

14

interest in the property.

15

The clear error in that decision is, the court

16

didn't cite any of this Court's decisions and, in

17

particular, didn't cite the Mitchell case, where this

18

Court held that a retroactive renunciation of a property

19

interest -- and I'm quoting -- should not be

20

misinterpreted as an indication that the taxpayer never

21

owned an interest in the property.

22

This Court has consistently held that you look

23

to the realizable economic value of the taxpayer's rights,

24

and you don't look to the State law fictions of

25

retroactive renunciations and disclaimers.

As the Court

1

held in the Irvine case, Federal tax law is not struck

2

blind by the State's legal fiction of a retroactive

3

disclaimer.
The lien attached to the rights at the time that

4
5

it arose, and subsequent dispositions of that, of the

6

interest could not destroy the Federal lien.

7

Unless the Court has further questions --

8

QUESTION:

9

I do, actually.

I might -- I have

one, and you're probably not going to have an answer,

10

because we haven't looked it up, and I haven't, either,

11

but as I was looking at the bankruptcy law, the reason

12

that I was concerned is the following.

13

Imagine the taxpayer in this case had done just

14

what he did, but he did it 30 days before going bankrupt.

15

What -- if I'm right about the bankruptcy law, the

16

interpretation would mean, if we got yours, is that his

17

creditors, who were private, couldn't get at the money,

18

and the reason is, it would not be a, quote, interest in

19

property, but the Government, as taxpayer, would be able

20

to get at the money, and the reason would be because it

21

is, quote, a right to property.

22

MR. JONES:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

Well -Now, that seemed, you know, a little

odd.
MR. JONES:

That is possible.

I'm not in a

I

1

position to say yea or nay, but I can say it's a very

2

common situation that the Federal tax lien applies in a

3

situation where private creditors have no opportunity

4

to -- I mean, that's what the Best case was precisely

5

about.

6

And the courts held that it doesn't matter

7

whether under other law, State law in that case, whether

8

you have a -- whether other creditors could seize it.

9

This is a question of Federal law under section 6321, and

10

under the Federal law, if the Federal law provides a lien,

11

that's the answer to the question.

12

QUESTION:

And --

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, can I pursue -- you said

14

that the lien attaches to his right to get the property.

15

If he exercises that right, it attaches to the property

16

which is the product.

17

But if he doesn't exercise the option, and

18

somebody else gets the property, that -- I don't see it as

19

being the product of his option any more.

20

MR. JONES:

How can you --

I don't -- what do you mean by
