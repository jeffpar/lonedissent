ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH H. BOHR

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MS. BOHR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This Court has held that Social Security

10

proceedings are intended to be simple and informal,

11

nonadversarial, nontechnical, and accessible even to the

12

layman claimant.

13

attend Social Security administrative hearings do not have

14

attorney representation.

15

Social Security Act is intended to be unusually protective

16

of claimants.

17

Indeed, almost half of all claimants who

This Court also noted that the

Consistent with congressional intent, the Social

18

Security Administration has promulgated and created a

19

panoply of regulations, rules, forms, and notices which

20

embody that simplicity, that informality, and that

21

claimant-supportive process mandated by Congress.

22

conceded by the commissioner, the statute and regulations

23

do not require that claimant specifically delineate any

24

claims of error or specific issues when seeking review by

25

the appeals council from an administrative law judge

QUESTION:

I thought the forms contain spaces in

which you're supposed to state the reason for your appeal.

4

MS. BOHR:

The form in question contains three

5

lines of space, and it states, my reasons for disagreement

6

are.

7

QUESTION:

Right.

8

MS. BOHR:

It doesn't state any warning on it

9

that you must list specific issues.

There's nothing in

10

the notice of decision that is sent to the claimant when a

11

claim is denied that warns the claimant that if they do

12

not delineate specific issues in their appeal they will

3

waive that right in Federal court and,

4

significantly, Justice Scalia, the notice of decision, the

5

one issued in this case, contains many other warnings.

6

warns a claimant that if they file a new application it's

7

not the same thing as appealing.

this claimant was represented

by counsel.

21

MS. BOHR:

Yes,

she was.

22

QUESTION:

At every stage, no?

Now, the point

23

you're making now, that there's no warning,

24

would have some force in a case where you're dealing with

25

a layman.

I suppose

1

But where you're dealing with a lawyer who knows

2

the usual rule in administrative cases that you have --

3

indeed, any case, judicial or administrative, that you

4

have to have complained about what you're appealing, and

5

if you don't specify what it is, you abandon it.

6

that the usual rule throughout the law?

7

MS. BOHR:

Isn't

Your Honor, in Social Security

8

proceedings the scheme is different.

We have set up a

9

very -- Congress has established an informal,

10

nonadversarial system of decisionmaking.

Social

11

Security's own regulations and rules do not require that a

12

claimant specify issues.

13

In fact, the regulations provide that the review

14

is plenary, meaning that all issues are before the Appeals

15

Council unless the Appeals Council notifies the claimant

16

that they intend to limit the issues, so the

17

regulations --

18

QUESTION:

But --

19

MS. BOHR:

-- provide for a plenary review.

20

QUESTION:

-- that doesn't help you I don't

21

think, Ms. Bohr, because we're talking here about whether

22

you have to raise it before the Appeals Council.

23

Granted, you can take anything that happened

24

before, before the Appeals Council.

We're talking about

25

whether you can take something that you didn't take to the

MS. BOHR:

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

3

QUESTION:

So why don't you have to --

4

QUESTION:

Were you the counsel below --

5

MS. BOHR:

Not at the Appeals Council level.

6

QUESTION:

-- Ms. Bohr, at the Appeals Council

8

MS. BOHR:

No, we were not.

9

QUESTION:

Why wouldn't it be helpful to raise

level?

10

issues that the claimant thinks are important before the

11

Appeals Council?

12

MS. BOHR:

Well, certainly --

13

QUESTION:

It just strikes me as rather odd that

14
15

the claimant wouldn't want to raise them.
MS. BOHR:

Well, certainly in this case the

16

record does reflect that Ms. Sims' counsel raised many

17

matters in her -- in the appeal, but --

18

QUESTION:

Some, but apparently never claimed

19

that the administrative law judge should have ordered a

20

consultative examination.

That was never raised --

21

MS. BOHR:

No, it was not.

22

QUESTION:

-- anywhere down the line until the

23
24
25

district court, was it?
MS. BOHR:

No, it was not.

I think certainly it

can assist the process for claims to identify issues, and

same as for a district court and a court of appeals.

you don't raise an issue, you lose it.

9

Now, there can be exceptions to that, but I

10

mean, unless there's something that says there's an

11

exception, I don't know why we'd assume there was one.
MS. BOHR:

That is certainly a rule, and many

agencies follow that rule --

With exceptions.

MS. BOHR:

But you have to look at what are the

19

prudential considerations for the application of common

20

law issues of exhaustion, which is what you're describing.

21

QUESTION:

No, I'm just saying I never saw a

22

case that didn't follow that rule, and then what they

23

usually argue about is whether there's an exception, and

24

there are many.

25

that would say -- there may be many things that would take

you out of what I'd call the hornbook rule, or maybe I'm

2

wrong about the hornbook rule.

3

that's what it was.

4

MS. BOHR:

I'm just saying, I thought

The hornbook rule you're referring

5

about is the -- is a rule that claimants may be required

6

to list issues, but you have to look at the whole

7

statutory scheme we're talking about.

8

You can't just look at these things in a vacuum,

9

and Congress, as this Court pointed out in the McCarthy v.

10

Madigan case and the Darby v. Cisneros case, you have to

11

look with consistency with the actual underlying

12

congressional intent, and any applicable statutory and

13

regulatory scheme, in determining whether exhaustion

14

should be required at all, and issue exhaustion is part of

15

the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.

16

And courts have also set forth certain

17

exceptions from that rule, and they should not be applied,

18

though, blindly.

19

prudential considerations are served, and the two primary

20

ones identified in the McCarthy v. Madigan case were

21

protection of agency autonomy and also judicial economy.

22

Those were the two reasons why you would require someone

23

to exhaust administrative remedies.

24
25

You have to look at whether the

Now, in this context we submit that those
purposes are simply not served, because you have an agency

that specifically talks about its proceedings are

2

informal, they're nontechnical, they're -- they are

claimant-supported, you have a process that doesn't advise

QUESTION:

Now, why?

That's exactly what I --

6

I'm glad -- thank you for getting into this, because

7

that's -- why does the fact that it's informal make a

8

difference?

9

more reason to bring up the things, or it's at least no

10

less of a reason, so why does that make a difference?
MS. BOHR:

11
12

QUESTION:

MS. BOHR:

19

-- all those factors make a

difference.

17
18

Well, all that could say, let's bring

it up.

16

It's a combination of being informal,

being simple, being nonadversarial, being --

20

21

talking about agencies where people come to hearings and

QUESTION:

We're not

I absolutely agree with you that

there is that difference.

And now what my question is, is

1

why should that make a difference in terms of whether

2

you'd have to bring it up or not?

3

MS. BOHR:

Because it makes a difference in

4

terms of how the agency announces -- the agency has, as I

5

said earlier, a whole panoply of regulations, rules,

6

forms, and notices, and all those --

7
8

QUESTION:
change that.

Well, they can change that.

They can

I mean --

9

MS. BOHR:

But they haven't changed it.

10

QUESTION:

Well, I know they haven't, but what

11

you're driving us to is to say that although SSA has been

12

very -- very liberal in saying, you don't have to mention

13

whatever your claim is, we'll look at it, and if there's

14

anything that's wrong we'll correct it.

15

They may well be willing to do that internally,

16

but if we now tell them that if you adopt this approach,

17

they are going to be able to come to the courts and

18

reverse you for something that you didn't see, and that

19

the claimant before you didn't bring to your attention,

20

they're going to say, now, wait a minute.

21

to require people to set forth the reasons that they're

complaining.

Maybe we ought

In other words, I don't think it makes sense to

their decisions more reviewable than the decisions of

1

other agencies simply because they've decided to be more

2

generous to the claimants.
MS. BOHR:

3

I don't see that it follows.

Your Honor, when you appeal a case to

4

the Appeals Council, the -- I think it's significant that

5

they don't advise people that you have to raise issues.

6

You look at the Veterans Administration, which is a

7

similar kind of agency like Social Security -QUESTION:

10

issues.

I agree that they don't have to raise

They don't have to raise issues.

The Appeals

Council is willing to consider issues that are not raised.
But that's quite a separate question from

11

12

whether, if you don't raise it and the Appeals Council

13

doesn't see it, you can then haul the Appeals Council into

14

court.

15

makes sense to say that because they're generous, they

16

should be more readily suable in district court than other

17

agencies.

18

That's a separate question, and I don't see why it

MS. BOHR:

Well, first of all, in the Social

19

Security context, when the Appeals Council denies review,

20

it's the ALJ decision that goes into Federal court, not

21

the Appeals Council denial.

22

QUESTION:

And if it went just to the ALJ and

23

then directly to court, as Congress -- that has been

24

proposed, to cut out this Appeals Council altogether.

25

it went from the ALJ to the court, then you would agree

If

1

that you would have to raise in the district court any

2

issue in order to get it on appeal?

3

MS. BOHR:

Certainly.

There is a point that we

4

concede that the informal, nonadversarial, claimant-driven

5

process changes to a more formal setting, and we contend

6

that the way this scheme is currently set up, that point

7

happens in Federal court.

8

Federal court, despite the fact that we have a very simple

9

kind of system for claimants, when you get to Federal

10

When you file a claim in

court you have to raise all your issues.
QUESTION:

11

You spend about -- the Appeals

12

Council is the fourth rung or the third rung within the

13

agency?

14

MS. BOHR:

It is the fourth rung.

You apply

15

initially, there is a decision made, then the claimant

16

requests reconsideration, then, if they're dissatisfied,

17

the third step is a hearing before an administrative law

18

judge, and then if they're denied they must go through the

19

fourth rung, which is the Appeals Council.

20

Now, this is a huge number of claims.

115,000

21

cases are filed there in the last fiscal year, and they

22

have just 20 judges, and there is information we provided

23

in our brief that there have been studies done which show

24

that the average judge spends 15 minutes looking at a

25

claim, they issue boiler-plate denials -- in fact, in 1995

1

they admitted that they no longer were going to even

2

address the issues that claimants raised in their

3

decisions.

4

So one of the main purposes of requiring people

5

to exhaust a step is to look at -- is to help the courts.

6

Well, how does it help the courts if they don't even tell

7

you in their decisions why they have denied the case?
QUESTION:

8

9

Ms. Bohr, it's also very -- it's to

help the agency I think, to let them correct a mistake,

10

and it will be much easier for them to correct it if it's

11

called to their attention than if it's not, if they're

12

simply bypassed and it's raised for the first time in

3

court.
MS. BOHR:

4

Certainly we do not -- Chief Justice,

5

we certainly agree that the agency could set up a system

6

like this if it wanted to.

7

QUESTION:

8

a system like this.

9

MS. BOHR:

20

Well, it has set up -- it has set up

They haven't set up a system where

they are requiring claimants to raise specific issues.

Don't --

1

nothing here suggests that they're treating it otherwise.
They're not saying, as I understand it, that you

2

3

must have raised an issue before you get to the Appeals

4

Council in order to get it -- in order to bring it to the

5

Appeals Council.

6

raised it in the Appeals Council before you can go into

7

court.
MS. BOHR:

8

9

What they're saying is, you have to have

Yes, that is what the agency is

doing, and this is not an -- this is not something that's

10

provided for within the regulatory scheme.

11

litigating position now that Social Security is taking in

12

court matters is, they are raising this requirement, or

13

this objection to claimants in Federal court to seek to

14

bar them from raising issues when the vast majority of

15

claims were never even notified of the need to raise the

16

issues.

17

QUESTION:

It is a

It says in the notice that they gave

18

you, I take it, you have a right -- not you, but your

19

client, if you do not agree with the ALJ's decision, you

20

may file an appeal with the Appeals Council.

21

not appeal, and the council does not review the ALJ's

22

decision on its own, you will not have a right to court

23

review.

If you do

24

MS. BOHR:

Yes.

25

QUESTION:

So a lawyer receives that.

Now, when

1

a lawyer receives that, I think that lawyer would know, I

2

better appeal it if I want to go to court, and if a

3

lawyer -- you know, had a -- a lawyer who knows the basic

4

ground rules I think might also think, I better raise the

5

issues.
MS. BOHR:

6

Justice Breyer, that provision you're

7

referring to does certainly advise you of the need to

8

exhaust, and there's no dispute you have to exhaust that
step.

You have to go to the Appeals Council in order to

10

get -- go into Federal court, but it doesn't advise you

11

and give you warnings.

12

says, you have a right to file a new application at any

13

time, but filing a new application is not the same as

14

appealing.

Note in the following paragraph it

15

QUESTION:

What --

16

MS. BOHR:

You might lose benefits.

17
18

It doesn't

warn you about it with the Appeals Council.
QUESTION:

What is the point of requiring you to

1

go to the Appeals Council, as you concede they do, if you

20

don't have to raise issues there that you later want to

21

take to court?

22

MS. BOHR:

Certainly people do raise issues, as

23

I said, but the problem is, their own regulations don't

24

mandate that you specify your specific issues, and when

25

you're looking at imposing on a claimant this exhaustion

1

requirement you have to look at the prudential

2

considerations.

3

QUESTION:

So are you saying, Ms. Bohr, that if

4

the agency were simply to adopt a rule that you must

5

exhaust your issues before the Appeals Council in order to

6

raise them in court, that would suffice?

7

MS. BOHR:

Mr. Chief Justice, certainly we

8

contend this is a matter for the agency and not for the

9

court.
QUESTION:

10

Well now, I asked you a rather

11

specific question.

12

and then explain if you want to.

13

MS. BOHR:

I think it can be answered yes or no

Yes, I think the agency could seek to

14

do that.

They could seek to promulgate a regulation to

15

require issue exhaustion, but, of course, it would have to

16

be consistent with the congressional intent I've described

17

earlier.

18

It would have to be consistent with the intent

19

of the Social Security Act to be protective of claimants

20

and the like.

21

about whether this is appropriate step, but at least at

22

that point it would be subject to all the discussions that

23

need to occur within the agency.

24
25

It would have to subject to public debate

The agency has conceded that this should not
apply to unrepresented claimants, for example, this

MS. BOHR:

The problem is that -- I believe what

you're asking, then, if you've been denied review and they

haven't given any reasons, you want them to go back and

readdress the reasons?
QUESTION:

I'm saying, assuming we think there's

12

an exhaustion rule, since there's already a 4-year period

MR. STEWART:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The requirement that a claimant exhaust

12

administrative remedies, and the proposition that we

13

espouse that particular issues not raised at the Appeals

14

Council should ordinarily be deemed waived, are

15

technically distinct, but they serve similar purposes.

16

Both requirements reflect a recognition that

17

judicial review of Federal agency action imposes

18

significant costs on both the executive branch and the

19

Federal courts, and those costs should not be imposed

20

unless it's clearly necessary, and in particular, courts

21

should not intrude upon agency processes until the agency

22

has had a chance to take its best shot at solving the

correspond pretty closely to the normal standards for

and I think our interpretation of that regulation is best

The agency is currently conducting

an experiment in which, in selected States, we will

dispense with the requirement that the claimant seek

7

review in the Appeals Council as a prerequisite to seeking

MR. STEWART:

It would be directed to whether

MR. STEWART:

I mean, it varies a lot depending

on the sort of issue you've raised, you want to raise.

In

Richardson v. Piralis, for instance, this Court recognized

But the fee for the administrative

The agency monitors

Well, I think the scheme is

21

certainly such that if a claimant believed that the

that's not the way the system operates, that even though

MR. STEWART:

Now --

It may be that in some instances

this will cause the filing of over-long requests for

QUESTION:

1

The kind of thing I think you would

2

say normally you don't have to present to the ALJ, is a

3

claim that, for example, this regulation that you're

4

following is contrary to the statute, or the -- a statute

5

is contrary to the Constitution, something that there

6

would be a principle within the agency that he's not

7

supposed to make that decision.

8

so

9

MR. STEWART:

That's my understanding,

That's absolutely correct, and

10

that would be true of the Appeals Council as well, because

11

the Appeals Council is not a policy-making body.

12

is to apply established SSA policy to individual cases,

13

and so a claim, for instance, that the regulation was

14

violative of a statute, or the statute was violative of

15

the Constitution, couldn't be presented either to the ALJ

16

or the Appeals Council.

the court of appeals reviewing the agency action, if

22

there's a failure to exhaust, does the Article III court

MR. STEWART:

QUESTION:

MR. STEWART:

I mean

-- a great deal written about this?
There's not a great deal written

4

about this, although the bulk of the cases, or really all

5

of the court of appeal cases that I have seen that have

6

applied the rule that claims not raised before the agency

7

will thereafter be deemed waived, have simply ignored or

8

dismissed the claim once it was raised.

9

That is, presumably if you had a good reason for

10

not raising the claim before the agency, the court would

11

then consider it on the merits, but if you

12

good reason for not raising it, the court typically

13

wouldn't remand to the agency to give you a second shot.

14

QUESTION:

But suppose you had a good reason.

16

this area, such that it's exactly the same as when a case

17

comes up to a court of appeals from the district court.

MR. STEWART:

1

I mean, I think certainly it is

2

entirely appropriate for the court to entertain the

3

question, was there a good reason for not raising this

4

before the agency, but I think here, the question would

5

have to be answered in the negative, because on top of

6

everything else, not only was the claimant represented by

7

counsel, but there was a published opinion within the

8

Fifth Circuit some 18 months previously that had said in

9

the clearest possible language, issues not raised before

10

the Appeals Council, absent extraordinary circumstances,

11

can't be raised in court.

12

So I think perhaps for that reason the

13

petitioner didn't attempt to argue in the court of appeals

14

that yes, there would ordinarily be a waiver principle,

15

but it was inapplicable here for good cause.

16

petitioner argued that there was not properly -QUESTION:

17

Rather, the

Well, but you have the same scenario

18

in the Seventh Circuit, and when it reached the Seventh

19

Circuit they overruled their previous cases, unanimously,

20

MR. STEWART:

21

They overruled them, but they

22

certainly didn't -- I don't think they could reasonably

23

have overruled them on the ground that there was a lack of

notice.

MR. STEWART:

That's basically what they

They thought it was inconsistent

5

with the -- I mean, they made an argument much like

petitioner is making --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. STEWART:

9

Right.
-- that it was inconsistent with

the manner in which the Appeals Council operates.
QUESTION:

10

And also, from the experience in the

11

courts, that is, in a number of these cases there are

12

hassles in the district court about whether you in fact

13

raised the issue, because you've got only these three

14

lines on the form.
In fact, in this very case, wasn't one of the

15
16

issues the Fifth Circuit said hadn't been raised debated

17

between the parties as to whether it was raised or not

18

raised?

19

MR. STEWART:

That's correct, and I think you

20

are correct that that is an inevitable cost of default

21

rules in any context, whether it be administrative

22

default, default issues that are not -- issues not raised

23

before the district court are waived on appeal, habeas,

there are a lot of situations in which in particular cases

2

merits of the claim.

3

QUESTION:

Yes, and in fact didn't it happen

4

in -- well, both the Eighth Circuit and the Seventh

5

Circuit case said in the end the claimant lost on the

6

merits, and the court thought it was not worthwhile

7

hassling over whether it was waived or not, since it had

8

no merit in any event.

9

MR. STEWART:

I agree that that is a possible

10

outcome, but I think when we argue for administrative

11

default in these cases our purpose is not to get the

12

individual claim kicked out of court.

13

once these principles become established, claimants and

14

their representatives will realize that in order to

15

preserve claims for judicial review they must be raised

16

before the agency, and the Appeals Council will be given a

17

better opportunity to fix mistakes in a way that avoids

18

the need for --

QUESTION:

Our hope is that

But you may get rid of the Appeals

you set up the experiment and 10 States don't have it.

Is there also any consideration in the agency

about revising the form so that people will know what

they're expected to do?

Definitely the agency has

avoid claims being kicked out unnecessarily, or perhaps a

better answer would be, the agency as well as the courts

19

that the Appeals Council is given the best possible

the Court 3 months later came out with a decision that

said, we find this sort of rule to be fundamentally

inconsistent with the nature of the Appeals Council and

QUESTION:

Mr. Stewart, one question.

Are the

members of the Appeals Council lawyers?
MR. STEWART:

I believe some are lawyers and

some are not lawyers.
QUESTION:

I hope that in this experiment that

14

they're doing they take into account not only whether more

15

district court cases are filed without the appeal, but

16

also whether uniformity is produced by having all of these

17

appeals go -- not get dumped right into Federal court.

18

I always thought the whole advantage of an

19

administrative agency was to assure uniformity of

20

decisionmaking, which --

21

MR. STEWART:

I think that's correct, and in a

22

certain category of cases the Appeals Council will remand

the case to the ALJ for further explanation or

clarification of the opinion, and sometimes the ALJ will

QUESTION:

Mr. Stewart on the question of

7

uniformity, it's been said that the Appeals Council does

8

not follow case law, that it's -- that each case is set up

9

on its own, and they don't follow precedent.

10

MR. STEWART:

I think it's something of an

11

overstatement to say the Appeals Council doesn't follow

12

case -- can't look at case law.

The Appeals Council is

3

bound by SSA policy, and the Appeals Council cannot use a

4

published decision as a justification for deviating from

established SSA policy.

6

itself to change.

7

It has to wait for the policy

But if there is a question that is not

8

controlled by any specific published SSA policy, the

Appeals Council can look to case law to clarify that.

QUESTION:

Well, the reason that they -- is that

if you allow people to avoid exhaustion in several

have all these new reasons hitting them that nobody's even

unnecessarily.
