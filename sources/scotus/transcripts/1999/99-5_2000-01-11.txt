ORAL ARGUMENT OF JULIE GOLDSCHEID

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER BRZONKALA
MS. GOLDSCHEID:

9
10

Mr. --Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Congress enacted the civil rights remedy of the

11
12

Violence Against Women Act to remove one of the most

13

persistent barriers to women's full equality and free

14

participation in the economy:

15

based violence.

16

discriminatory gender-

A bipartisan Congress concluded that gender-

17

based violence substantially affects the national economy

18

based on a 4-year legislative record through which it

19

found that gender-based violence and the fear of that

20

discriminatory violence deters women's travel interstate,

21

restricts women's choice of jobs and ability to perform

22

those jobs, reduces national productivity, and increases

23

medical and other costs.

24
25

Each of these findings was fully supported by
evidence.

For example, Congress heard from women whose

batterers kept their partners from working, who wouldn't

2

let them leave home if they did work, or who inflicted

3

visible injuries so that they were afraid to go to work or

4

were physically unable to show up.

6

QUESTION:

Ms. Goldscheid, were all of these

instances instances of gender-based violence?

7

MS. GOLDSCHEID:

QUESTION:

9

As I understand it, this law doesn't

apply to any -- to any rape or any -- any violence against

10

women.

11

because of her sex.

12

Not --

It is only when the woman is -- is selected

MS. GOLDSCHEID:

That is absolutely correct.

13

The statute limits each individual case to claims in which

14

a woman could --

15

QUESTION:

Now, all of these -- all of these

16

instances that you're referring to that have such an

17

effect on interstate commerce, are they all instances in

18

which you have somebody who just hates women and is doing

19

it for that reason?

MS. GOLDSCHEID:

instance, but Congress --

of violence motivated by gender have a substantial adverse

2

effect on interstate commerce.
QUESTION:

3

Well, that's nice, but -- but the

4

instances on which that finding was based that you're now

alluding to don't -- aren't limited to -- to gender-based

6

violence.

The finding that Congress made

I'm not talking about the

I'm talking about the evidence that supports the

MS. GOLDSCHEID:

The evidence that supports the

13

finding was in the record.

14

found that some acts of discriminatory violence could, in

15

fact, be discriminatory.

Congress also specifically

-- a similar question.

It -- it

follows from my last one.
If indeed non-gender-based violence against

21

women or, for that matter, against men also has a

22

substantial effect on interstate commerce, I suppose

23

Congress could enact a general criminal statute against -

24

- against violence, a Federal -- a Federal rape law, a

25

Federal robbery law.

Right?

A Federal murder law?

from the hypothetical that you propose because by -QUESTION:

3

Oh, I'm aware of that.

I'm -- but

that's why I posed the hypothetical.
MS. GOLDSCHEID:

5
6

This case is entirely distinct

By requiring discriminatory --

a showing of discriminatory motivation in each instance,

7

the Congress specifically removed these cases from the

8

kind of constitutional shoals that the Court in Griffin v.

9

Breckenridge was worried about.
QUESTION:

10

But the justification for the statute

11

that you're now giving us is a justification that would

12

allow general Federal criminal laws on all subjects

13

because all crime affects interstate commerce.

14

MS. GOLDSCHEID:

15

QUESTION:

16

MS. GOLDSCHEID:

As we --

Is that not -- is that not so?
It's entirely possible that all

17

crime might affect interstate commerce, but that does not

18

lead necessarily to the conclusion that --

QUESTION:

MS. GOLDSCHEID:

21

24
25

-- a general tort law of the

type you suggest would be constitutional.

22

23

Well --

As we set forth in our briefs, there are other
factors -QUESTION:

I don't see why.

I don't see why.

If all that is necessary is that there be some effect,

1

even though these are not economic matters we're talking

2

about, but that there be some effect on interstate

3

commerce, you have a Federal Government that can legislate

4

in the entire realm of criminal law, which is certainly

5

not what the Founders thought they were creating.

6

very clear that they didn't think the Federal Government

7

had general police powers.

8

MS. GOLDSCHEID:

9

Congress would have that authority.
QUESTION:

10

It's

And we are not suggesting that

Oh, I think you are suggesting that.

11

That's the point of my question.

12

suggesting it.

13

general does not substantially affect interstate commerce,

14

although this little narrow category of violence, namely

15

not just violence against women but violence motivated by

16

hatred of women, that little area, substantially affects

commerce.

affect interstate commerce much more than that.

21

Tell me why you are not

Is it because you think that violence in

My goodness, certainly murder, rape, robbery

MS. GOLDSCHEID:

Two responses to your question,

Your Honor.
The first is that this Court long has held that

22

especially when -- when Congress is looking at a general

23

social problem of the type with which it was concerned

24

here, Congress can regulate one step at a time, and that's

25

what it did.

So, by regulating a subset of the general

1

activity that it was looking at, it's consistent with this

2

Court's holdings.

3

In addition --

4

QUESTION:

That -- that would be a good response

5

to an objection that Congress was being discriminatory in

6

selecting only this area of -- of crime and not the entire

7

area of crime.

8

is, if they can do this, surely a fortiori they could

9

enact a general Federal robbery law.
MS. GOLDSCHEID:

10
11

My question

And that point goes to the

second part of my response to your earlier question.
QUESTION:

12
13

But that wasn't my question.

Good.

It should have been your

first.

14

MS. GOLDSCHEID:

I'm sorry.

15

Which is that, as we set forth in our brief,

16

there are other considerations to assessing whether or not

17

a law that regulates intrastate non-commercial activity is

18

constitutional.

19

or not the law intrudes on an area of traditional State

20

concern.

21

And the heart of that inquiry is whether

And we simply don't have that here.

This law -

QUESTION:

Where do you get that principle from?

24

You see, I had thought that we had a Supremacy Clause in

25

the Federal Constitution so that if Congress does have

power under the Commerce Clause to pass a law, it

2

automatically has power to sweep away all State laws that

3

-- that interfere with it.

4

MS. GOLDSCHEID:

Congress certainly does have

5

the authority to -- to preempt State law in areas in which

6

it has power.

7

QUESTION:

So then what difference does it make

8

that this exercise of Commerce Clause power happens not to

9

preempt State law?

It seems to me it makes no difference

10

at all.

11

Clause power, they can preempt State law.

12

If -- if it is a valid exercise of Commerce

MS. GOLDSCHEID:

The inquiry derives from this

13

Court's concern in the Lopez decision about obliterating

14

the distinction between what is truly national and what is

15

truly local.

16

our brief identifying issues such as what was presented to

17

Congress here, the fact that the problem with which

18

Congress was concerned is discrimination, which is

19

uniquely and traditionally an area of Federal concern, the

20

fact that in this case the States have come forward and

21

have said that they need Federal help in resolving the

22

problem -- Attorneys General from 38 States testified to

23

Congress that the Violence Against Women in general, and

24

the civil rights remedy in particular, was a law that

25

would help them resolve this problem that they found to be

very serious and entrenched and perplexing.

And, of

2

course, you know that nearly three-quarters of the States'

3

Attorneys General filed briefs with this Court in support

4

of this law here.
And the law itself works no usurpation of any

area of traditional State concern.

7

traditional areas of divorce, child custody, equitable

distribution expressly and entirely undisturbed.
QUESTION:

9

It leaves the

Well, presumably Congress could also,

10

under your theory at least, legislate in those areas too.

11

If -- if there's bias against women and they're not

12

receiving adequate alimony or it's not enforceable in

13

court in the States, then it would also have an effect on

14

commerce.

Would it not?
MS. GOLDSCHEID:

15

It might have an effect on

16

commerce, although that scenario -- if you're suggesting a

17

scenario that -- where the Federal Government would

18

propose to overtake, say, wholeheartedly a divorce law,

19

that would be stepping into the shoes -QUESTION:

discrimination which is historically within the realm of

the Federal Government.

What the law here regulates -- it builds on this

laws through which Congress has provided means of redress

But the -- but the case of marital

distribution would also be based on discrimination, that

10

is, a documented legislative history that shows that women

11

are getting the short end of the stick in marital property

12

distribution.

13

MS. GOLDSCHEID:

And if there were such a

14

legislative record, that would certainly be a closer case

15

to what we have here than an over-arching, overall

16

regulation of divorce law.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

17

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
MR. WAXMAN:

18
19

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The innovation of this Court's decision in

20
21

United States v. Lopez was to reiterate that under the

22

Commerce Clause there are judicially enforceable limits on

23

Congress' authority and to explicate what those limits

24

are.

25

satisfies those limits in the following respects.

And we think that the statute at issue in this case

QUESTION:

1

General Waxman, is the Government

2

supporting this -- the constitutionality of this

3

legislation both on Commerce Clause grounds and on section

4

5 of the Fourteenth Amendment?

5

MR. WAXMAN:

Indeed, we are, Mr. Chief Justice,

6

and I'm prepared to make the Government's argument with

7

respect to both.

8

just to fill in some of the many questions that were

9

answered.
QUESTION:

10
11

I thought I would start on the commerce

Let me just comment.

Your colleague

had a very brief time to answer our questions.

And it --

12

it seemed to me that when she was being pressed upon

13

whether or not a murder statute could be enacted, she

14

would immediately talk about discriminatory animus going

15

to the -- to the Fourteenth Amendment question.

Just confining yourself to the Commerce
Clause --

MR. WAXMAN:

20

address the questions the Court was asking about murder

21

statutes and why this should be different?

22

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes.

QUESTION:

MR. WAXMAN:

When Congress -- as this Court explained -- in

2

explaining -- the explanation for why it's different

3

requires a somewhat long answer, but I have - - I do have

4

the question firmly in mind.

5

(Laughter.)

6

MR. WAXMAN:

7

Believe it or not, I had the

question firmly in mind weeks before I came up here.

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. WAXMAN:

My answer with respect to -- let me

10

just get to the chase and then give you the explanation.

11

A murder statute would be far more difficult to defend

12

under Lopez, but without knowing what Congress found and

13

what the factual premises were for such a statute and

14

whether it was preemptive or -- or complementary I'm not

15

able to say, as an a priori matter, constitutional or

16

unconstitutional.

17

rely on a conclusion that that would be constitutional for

18

the following reasons.

19

But our defense of this statute doesn't

In Lopez, this Court explicated what we take to

20

be a four-part test in judicial scrutiny of legislation

21

that Congress passes under the substantial effects prong

22

of the Commerce Clause, but which is not itself either

23

economic or commercial or part of a legislative effort to

24

regulate or protect the specific market.

25

the first such case that this Court considered, and this

And Lopez was

1

one is quite arguably the second.
And what the Court said in Lopez, as we

2

3

understand it in both the majority opinion, joined by five

4

Justices, and in the concurring opinion that you -- that

5

you authored, was that Congress must -- the Court must

6

independently find four things:

7

act to protect interstate commerce.
In Lopez, it was not at all clear that that was

8

9

first, that Congress did

true.

The act didn't even regulate violence.

It

10

regulated possession and only within a school.

11

much more like an effort to regulate what schools should

12

be doing.

13

Secondly, the Court --

QUESTION:

15
16

It looked

Whereas this one is squarely directed

at commerce.
MR. WAXMAN:

This one is squarely directed at

17

violent conduct as -- okay.

18

of the test.

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. WAXMAN:

I'm coming to the next part

The Court has to find also

21

independently -- and -- and this was first I think

22

explicated in Wirtz v. Maryland.

23

Congress had a rational basis to conclude that the

24

regulated activity substantially affected commerce.

25

The Court must find that

Third, the Court itself must find independently

1

-- and this I think is an innovation of Lopez -- that the

2

harm on Congress was direct and not attenuated when the

3

activity being regulated is not itself economic.
And fourth -- and this is, I think, what gets

4
5

most to the question about the -- the murder hypothetical.

6

Fourth, the Court has to find that upholding the

7

regulation at issue does not require the Court to embrace

8

a rule that would create what the Court said in -- in

9

Jones

Sc

Laughlin, a completely centralized Government by

10

obliterating the distinction between national concerns and

11

those that are truly local.

12

Now, the difficulty in -- in other words, when

13

Congress is -- is acting with its Commerce Clause

14

authority in this unique area where the underlying

15

activity is not itself economic, the Court undertakes an

16

evaluation that is not characteristic of the type of

17

evaluation that it takes in the ordinary Commerce Clause

18

situation where Congress is seeking to regulate a channel

19

or an instrumentality or an activity that's inherently

20

economic in itself, and it looks to the Federal versus the

21

local side of the balance.

22

And here, unlike the --

23

QUESTION:

Well, the Court has been helped many

24

times by finding some kind of jurisdictional hook that the

25

conduct that took place was carried out in -- in

1

interstate commerce.
MR. WAXMAN:

2

There is no such hook here.
There is no such hook here and

3

quite deliberately on Congress' part.

And let me answer

4

that question and then explain the essential distinction

5

with the murder statute.
Here Congress could have put a jurisdictional

6
7

requirement that the act of gender-motivated violence

8

affect commerce or substantially affect commerce.

9

under Lopez, there would be no question of Congress'

10

And

constitutional authority to do that.
But we submit that it is both not

11
12

constitutionally necessary under Wirtz and the -- Perez

13

and the other cases that suggest that under the

14

substantial effects test, it is appropriate for Congress

15

we think that a jurisdictional element in this case as,

MR. WAXMAN:

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

1

MR. ROSMAN:

2

3

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

4

The question in this case is whether the

5

enumeration of congressional powers in the Constitution

6

provides principled, substantive limits to those powers.

7

For each of the two powers that are at issue today,

8

petitioners ask this Court to go beyond its previous

9

holdings and to enlarge those already substantial powers

10

even further.
With respect to the Commerce Clause, this Court

11
12

has not yet held that Congress can regulate any violent

13

crime non-economic in scope and without any jurisdictional

14

element tying it to interstate commerce in the specific

15

instance.

16

With respect to section 5, this Court has not

17

yet held that Congress can remedy violations of the

18

section 1 prohibition against State denials of equal

19

protection by regulating purely private behavior that

20

could not possibly violate section 1.

21

Under these theories, Congress could justify

22

laws -- virtually any laws -- in domestic relations law,

23

crime, tort, areas that are traditionally governed by

24

State law.

25

the power to regulate is the power to preempt, Congress

And as Justice Scalia noted earlier, because

28

1

could occupy the fields in these areas and relegate the

2

States to a trivial and unimportant role in our Federal

3

structure.

4

With respect to the Commerce Clause --

5

QUESTION:

The Government argues, Mr. Rosman,

6

that -- that we're in a new regime after Lopez and that

7

what we should do for non-economic matters is not to say

8

that absolutely the Commerce Clause power exists or

9

doesn't exist, but rather it may exist so long as the

10

Government doesn't go too far in displacing State

11

activity.

12

What -- what's wrong with that regime?
MR. ROSMAN:

Because it's been -- as you noted

13

earlier and -- and as I just mentioned, it's been the

14

traditional jurisprudence of this Court that the power to

15

regulate is the power to preempt.

16

Congress has the power to regulate, it can displace State

17

law to the extent it chooses.

18

QUESTION:

That is to say, if

But what if the Federal statute

19

expressly says, this will not preempt State laws

20

whatsoever?

21

MR. ROSMAN:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

This statute, Your Honor?
What if -- what if a Federal statute

had that provision in it?
MR. ROSMAN:

Well, the Gun-Free School Zones Act

had that provision and it was still unconstitutional.

So,

I would not think that would be of significance.

2

What the Court focused on --

3

QUESTION:

Well, if that's not significance,

4

then the question of whether there's preemption or not is

5

not significant either.

8

MR. ROSMAN:

9

That -- that's correct.
Oh, okay.
It's not significant.

QUESTION:

10

12

history of trying to draw some kind of line, as you are,

13

between local and interstate effects.

14

failed.

15

Most of those have

What's your line?
MR. ROSMAN:

Well, we think that Lopez best drew

16

the line between economic conduct -- that is to say,

17

conduct which is connected to or arises out of a

18

commercial transaction -- and other conduct.

19

QUESTION:

So, then your view is that if it

20

turns out that, to use one of the Government's examples,

21

people are in their own houses cooking up biological

22

warfare or it turns out that in their own fireplaces, they

warming, swamp the east coast -- or, you know, use any of

Well, with respect to the first

5

Well, you see my point.

My point is

6

that there are many, many, many instances of non­

7

commercial activity, when you collect them all together,

8

that could have overwhelming effects on interstate

9

commerce.

And so I want to know if you think in any of

10

those myriads of examples -- I won't be too far-fetched -

11

- the Congress is powerless to act simply because the

12

cause of the major economic impact is itself not economic.

MR. ROSMAN:

Yes, Justice Breyer.

14

is the best reading of Lopez.

Then the drug laws are also

have to be non-economic --

Mr. Rosman, on that point, you're not

challenging, are you, any of the findings that Congress

made that this is, indeed, a problem that affects the

national economy because it impedes women's mobility, it

impedes the jobs that they can take, the times of day that

are you?

20

You're not challenging any of those findings,

MR. ROSMAN:

I think we're challenging them,

21

Justice Ginsburg, in the sense that Justice Scalia

22

suggested earlier on today, in the sense that all of the

23

studies that were done to support that finding are much

24

broader and don't really relate to the specific conduct,

Well, it regulates a -- a subset of

it, the animus kind of violence.

And -- and I would

suppose that -- I don't know that the Government made this

argument, but I would suppose that it could reasonably be

argued that from a finding that gender-based violence

resulted in a -- in a $3 billion effect on -- on the

economy, loss in gross product, that -- that one could

also infer that probably the substantial or -- or a very

no State shall do that.

Yes, in your hypothetical I believe

QUESTION:

MR. ROSMAN:

But you're saying -Assuming that States were acting -

QUESTION:

-- that Congress is so limited in the

7

remedies that it can choose, that it cannot create a

8

private cause of action, which is really in a sense --we

9

can argue about this, but in one sense less intrusive on

10
11

that States?
MR. ROSMAN:

Well, the Fourteenth Amendment is

12

intrusive on the States, Justice Kennedy, and this Court

13

specifically considered statutes along the lines of what

14

you're describing in United States v. Harris and the civil

15

rights cases.

16

Congress --

QUESTION:

I wouldn't think they made the

17

argument that Justice Kennedy advanced; that is, as I

18

understood his question, there is a clear finding that the

19

State in its courts or in its legal system says where a

20

black man and a white man are fighting it out in our legal

21

system, the white man always wins, for example.

22

to remedy that situation, to remedy that -- nothing to do

23

with the white man who's always winning -- to remedy the

24

failure of the court system to apply the law equally, we

25

create an optional Federal remedy.

And so,

That's what I took as

his basic question.
And my response to your answer would be could

you explain it.

for a State's failure to follow the Equal Protection

5

Clause?

6

Why isn't that a perfectly good remedy

MR. ROSMAN:

First, as we've set forth in our

7

brief, we think that's exactly the situation that existed

8

in the civil rights cases.

9

QUESTION:

That may be.

If it is, they didn't

10

address the argument, and therefore, I would like to know

11

the reasoning as to why that isn't a remedy for the

12

State's deprivation of equal protection of the law.

13

MR. ROSMAN:

Because the text of the statute

says that Congress will enforce the prohibitions -QUESTION:

Protection Clause.

Therefore, we enforce that by

I don't believe that would be

21

enforcement litigation because it would be doing --

22

legislation -- it would be doing nothing to the States to

23

get them to comply with the Fourteenth Amendment.

24

would be as if Congress decided that instead of having

schools in the south to segregate in the 1950's, they

interpretation of section 5 is that Congress must do

something so that the States are no longer engaging in the

conduct which violates section 1.

QUESTION:

That would not be

The proper -- proper

You're saying section 5 does not

provide, as a remedy for the State's failure to abide by

the Constitution, the Federal Government's abolition of

the Federal system.

12

MR. ROSMAN:

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

That's a very succinct way of putting it.
QUESTION:

Yes.

Mr. Rosman, can -- can I ask why, if

13

we have in so many fields involving discrimination,

14

parallel State and Federal regulation, public

15

accommodations, employment, we don't say that that's a

16

traditional area for the States just because they got

17

there first, which they did?

18

State legislation before Federal.

19

harmonious legislation for public accommodations, for

20

employment, then why not here?

MR. ROSMAN:

In both areas there was

Commerce Clause, Justice Ginsburg.

to your question is because this isn't commerce.

This is violence.

This is not

This is interpersonal

violence, the kind of thing the States have always had the
exclusive province of regulating since the start of our
country.
QUESTION:

Going -- going back to section 5, I

take it on -- on your view any civil remedy provided by
Congress exceeds the section 5 power then.
MR. ROSMAN:
QUESTION:
MR. ROSMAN:
QUESTION:

Any civil remedy -Yes.
-- against private individuals?
That -- that may be brought by a

private individual against a perpetrator.
MR. ROSMAN:
Yes.

Against a private perpetrator.

The answer to your question is yes.
QUESTION:

Okay.

QUESTION:

Well, a private perpetrator who was

engaged in a conspiracy that was acting under color of
law?
MR. ROSMAN:

I had understood Justice Souter's

question to refer to someone who was not acting under
color of State authority.
QUESTION:

You're quite correct.

But any private individual who -- who

is participating in a State's violation of an individual's
rights can be sued privately.
