ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD M. FALK

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FALK:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
18 U.S.C. 844(i) makes arson a Federal crime if

11
12

it damages property used in interstate commerce or

13

property used in any activity affecting interstate

14

commerce.

15

The question here is whether petitioner's arson

16

of a private residence comes within the statute because

17

that home received natural gas and was mortgaged and

18

insured by out-of-state firms, and if so, whether that

19

application of the statute to that crime is

20

constitutional.

21

In the Government's view, the power to regulate

22

interstate commerce enables Congress to make a Federal

23

crime out of any act that threatens or damages property

24

having connections to interstate commerce or that

25

interrupts or disrupts an ongoing commercial relationship

with out-of-state parties.

2

Clause would enable Congress to enact general Federal

3

protections for virtually all property, including real

4

property, although the general protection of property is

5

one of the most basic core elements of an area of

6

traditional state concern and competence.

7

That view of the Commerce

In the Government's view of the Federal

8

protection of property, the -- Congress can make Federal

9

crimes out of things like scrawling graffiti or breaking a

10

window, and Congress has in -- in the Government's view

11

made Federal crimes out of setting fire to a gas barbecue

12

grill or perhaps a television.

13

Government has prosecuted as a Federal crime, the arson of

14

a private residence.

And here, of course, the

15

The Government has not identified any limit on

16

the Federal power to prohibit arson, although arson is a

17

quintessentially local crime.

QUESTION:

Mr. Falk, are you conceding in your

19

argument that the statute does apply?

20

arguing the constitutional issue first.

21

MR. FALK:

You seem to be

No, we do not concede that the

22

statute applies.

We do not believe it -- it applies.

23

believe, however, that in reading the statute in this

24

case, it is important to look at the constitutional

25

considerations that would ensue from applying the statute

We

1

in this case, and that in light of those considerations,

2

the statute should be construed to avoid what we view as

3

difficult, indeed, doubtful at best, constitutional

4

issues.
QUESTION:

5

Do you think if -- if we did not have

6

the constitutional concerns in the background, do you

7

think the statutory language is clearly with you or

8

against you?

9

MR. FALK:

We believe the statutory language is

10

with us even without the constitutional considerations in

11

the background.

12

the statute and the understanding of -- of the statute,

13

when you look at the normal sense of what it means for

14

property to be used in an activity affecting commerce,

15

which is the subset that was applied in this case, we

16

believe that it requires an active use of the physical

17

property, which after all, it is the damage to the

18

physical property that's supposed to provide the link to

19

interstate commerce here.

20

quite telling that there was some concern among some

21

Members of Congress that this statute did not reach

22

private residences.

23

QUESTION:

When you look at the plain language of

And we think, in fact, it's

Would it torture the words of the

24

statute to say that the home was used to obtain a

25

mortgage?

MR. FALK:

1

Well, I don't know if I'd go so far

2

as to say that it tortures the words of the statute,

3

Justice Kennedy, but it certainly twists them a bit.

4

is not -- it may be used in a -- in an abstract sense, but

5

it is not a use of the physical property and it is the

6

physical property that is really at issue here.
And it's not a use in an activity.

7

It

Getting a

8

mortgage is a -- is a single transaction rather than an

9

activity.

And this is -- this Court has a long history

10

and Congress has a long history of using the word activity

11

affecting interstate commerce to mean an enterprise -QUESTION:

12

I -- I acknowledge that in the

13

ordinary sense you use the mortgage to get the house.

14

don't use the house to get the mortgage.

15

that.

16

us to reach that result.

17

You

I can understand

But I'm not sure the statute necessarily requires

MR. FALK:

Well, we believe that -- that in the

18

normal diction, in the normal, ordinary understanding of

19

those words, when they're read entirely in context,

20

property used in an activity affecting interstate

21

commerce, that is required, and we think that's reinforced

22

by the -- by the -- the sense that the Congress that

23

passed this statute apparently had.

24

people that were concerned that this statute should reach

25

residences, but no one --

As I said, there were

QUESTION:

1

How do you distinguish -- excuse me.

2

How do you distinguish this case from the Russell case,

3

Mr. Falk?
MR. FALK:

4

Well, we think this case is -- is

5

quite clearly distinct from the Russell case because in

6

that case, the landlord was using the property -- was

7

bartering the occupancy of the property for a generation

8

of income, very much like -- like what was going on in --

9

in the Smith case where you were trading something to get

10

income, allowing people to come in and occupy the

11

property.

12

We think that -- that is -- is a difference and it's a

13

recognized difference in common speech.

14

And those people were paying for the privilege.

QUESTION:

Well, what if the house is used --

15

the property is put up to get a mortgage to get money to

16

go into an interstate trucking business?

17

MR. FALK:

Even so

18

QUESTION:

The homeowner does.

19
20

He needs money.

So, has he used

the house in -- in the sense contemplated by the statute?
MR. FALK:

We do not believe so, Justice

21

O'Connor, because the -- subjecting the house to a

22

security interest is not the kind of activity affecting

23

interstate commerce, the continuous sort of activity

24

affecting interstate commerce, that this Court and -- and

25

Congress in its other statutes has -- has repeatedly taken

And no one --we would point out no one in -- in

these debates where people said let's apply this to

residences, how can we do it.

6

mortgage is being used in an activity affecting interstate

commerce.

8

activity affecting interstate commerce, and any house that

9

receives utilities is being used in such an activity.

No one said, oh, the

Of course, any house with a

Any house that is insured is being used in an

10

Nobody -- nobody in the Congress thought that, not even

11

the most -- most fervent believers in applying this

12

statute to residences, they could find a way.

13

QUESTION: So, with respect to the mortgage, are

14

you conceding that it is used but simply saying that use

15

is irrelevant because it's not used in an activity?

16

that your argument?

17

MR. FALK:

Is

Well, we are conceding that -- that

it is not torturing the language, in Justice Kennedy's

19

words, to say that it is used in some sense.

20

using the house to get a mortgage.

21

QUESTION:

You are

That is --

Well, in -- in answer to Justice

22

O'Connor's question, do you concede that it is used within

23

the meaning of the statute, but that the use is not a use

24

in an activity within the meaning of the statute?

25

thought that was the argument that you were making, but I

I

1

want to get clear on it.
MR. FALK:

2

No.

Let me -- I don't believe you

3

can parse word by word in a statute without taking the

4

word -- the words in context together.

5

there is meaning to say it is used but not used in an

6

activity.

7

8

that -- used but not used in an activity.

9

use in an activity counts here.

I don't think

It is either used in an activity affecting
It can't be used or not in
It's -- only a

So that we don't think it

10

-- it is not the kind of use that the statute covers, and

11

that is our argument.
QUESTION:

-- have to admit it's a very peculiar

3

statute if it -- it reaches someone who sets fire to a

4

private residence that is owned by the occupant -- I'm

5

sorry.

6

but it does apply if -- if you set fire to a

7

that is rented by the occupant.

That's just a very

8

strange -- strange distinction.

I don't know why Congress

9

would draw that kind of a line.

And we're talking here

It does not, as you would say, apply in that case,

constitutional limitation.

2

MR. FALK:

Well, Justice Scalia --

3

QUESTION:

If it's owned by the occupant, we

4

don't have to worry.

5

MR. FALK:

If it's, you know --

It's not a Federal crime.
Well, Justice Scalia, when you get

6

back to the attempt to draw some nexus between this very

7

basic State common law crime in interstate commerce, when

8

a building is being rented out, it is being used in what

9

is recognized as a commercial activity.

As in Russell,

10

you could take a commercial tax deduction for it.

QUESTION:

13

private home ownership market, is a -- is one of the

14

foundations of the American economy I suppose.

15

MR. FALK:

It is a foundation of the American

16

economy.

17

is not -- is about as local an activity as you can get and

18

has -- has never been considered to be an activity

19

affecting interstate commerce.

20

21

activities affecting interstate commerce.

23

That may be.

However, the home ownership itself

statute, that because, at least in this case, which is an

2

easy case in our view, you can avoid substantial

3

constitutional issues, substantial constitutional concerns

4

when Congress appears -- at least Congress and the

5

executive and the lower -- some of the lower courts

6

together appear to be asserting what amounts to pretty

7

much plenary jurisdiction over one of the most basic

8

common law crimes that drawing a line that is permitted by

9

the words of the statute and that at least accords with

this Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence to some extent

The constitutionality of the statute

was not challenged in theie.

4

QUESTION:

Now, certainly --

But you would think -- you would

5

think Congress would not have the power to -- to prohibit

6

the arson of, say, skyscrapers.

7

MR. FALK:

Well, certainly not under the current

-- under the current articulation of this Court's Commerce

9

Clause jurisprudence.
Now, skyscrapers -- I mean, it depends what's

10
11

going on in the skyscraper.
QUESTION:

12

It seems to us --

They -- they have mortgages.

They

rent offices out, and they -- and they buy utilities

14

through interstate commerce.

15

the three activities, but it's in an 18-story skyscraper

that you have here.

MR. FALK:

Just -- say, there are just

Well, that would be a stretch beyond

18

the current -- this Court's current Commerce Clause

19

decisions.

20

to protect property pursuant to the Commerce Clause only

21

in the case of instrumentalities of interstate commerce

22

and in the case of persons or things -- things, for

23

property moving in interstate commerce.

25

This Court has recognized congressional power

It would be a stretch to say that Congress also
can protect property because it is commercially used.

1

That, we believe, goes beyond the current state of

2

Commerce Clause jurisprudence.

3

commercial property can be protected, if it's actively in

MR. FALK:

That's pretty

That was not a challenge in the court

of appeals, nor is it dependent on the 844(i) conviction.

5

So, Mr. Jones --

6

QUESTION:

What is your view of that?

7

MR. FALK:

Well, my view of that is that it is

8

justified -- it -- it may be constitutional as a --

9

basically as a sort of channels -- channels regulation, as

10

part of a licensing scheme which ensures that explosives

11

that travel in interstate commerce are taken care of in a

12

particular way.

13

that licensing scheme, the best argument for the

14

constitutionality of -- of this provision is that Congress

15

can require people who make these things to be licensed.

16

Mr. Jones was not licensed, and as a result, he would be

17

subject to a -- to a Federal punishment.

18

And as part of that -- rational part of

QUESTION:

Are these devices excluded from --

19

from the channels of interstate commerce if they have been

not licensed, if they've been made by somebody who's not

21

licensed?

MR. FALK:

Well --

QUESTION:

I mean, what you've just said makes

24

sense if, in fact, Congress has said we don't want any

undoubtedly has the -- has the power to enact, we're going

to punish anyone who makes one without having been

But you have to start with

Has it been excluded from interstate commerce?
MR. FALK:

6

Well, not all -- I don't believe all

7

the items that are covered within the destructive devices

8

definition have been excluded from interstate commerce.

9

don't believe that one can get a license to transport the

10

particular destructive device in this case, a Molotov

11

cocktail, and in that sense it -- it is rational.

12

can be -- and I believe it -- this could be justified

I

And it

3

because even if the devices are not excluded from

interstate commerce, their transport is regulated and

their trade is regulated.

that if you read used in an activity in the statute to

would argue a vehicle is used in interstate commerce if it

drives across the State line and so forth.

8

wouldn't argue that it's a vehicle used in an activity

affecting commerce because it burns gas, would you?

MR. DREEBEN:

I think that the gas theory would

cover all -- all vehicles.

If the Court disagreed with

10

the gas theory, then cars that aren't subject to

covered.

-- that they were certainly

was built locally, but for most automobiles that would not

be the case.

20

MR. DREEBEN:

That's true, but this statute

21

doesn't base jurisdiction on the fact that the home was

22

manufactured with out-of-state parts or out-of-state

23

materials, and it doesn't depend on the fact that the car

24

was manufactured with out-of-state parts or materials.

25

does look to the uses of the property in question.

MR. DREEBEN:

It should have read whoever

And it's really redundant,

It would have meaning as to the

11

other two segments of the statute, but I think that you're

12

right, Justice Scalia, that it would apply to all vehicles

13

because of the gas and the movement of the gas in

14

interstate commerce.

15

Again, this Court's decision in Russell makes

16

clear that it's not simply the activities of the occupants

17

of the house that are relevant to determining whether it's

18

used in an activity affecting interstate commerce.

19

the economic distinction between renting property and

20

mortgaging property is not likely one that would have

21

prompted Congress to exclude the coverage of houses that

22

are mortgaged while covering houses that are subject to

rental agreements.

they set up the Federal system, which is to allow people

Here the sentence was for 30 years.

It's not

clear in the record why this -- this crime happened, but

7

the homeowner himself argued before the sentencing court,

as I understand it, that the sentence was too -- too

strong.

And yet, this very remote Federal sentencing

10

scheme comes into play in what is ordinarily a common law

11

crime.

12

none of the questions we have asked, seemed to recognize

13

that there is a strong, local interest here that's just

simply being ignored.

15

And none of the responses you've given, perhaps

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I don't think that they're

16

in any sense being ignored, Justice Kennedy.

17

local authorities called upon the ATF to investigate this

18

crime and actually requested that we take it over for

19

prosecution because it involved a destructive device, a

Molotov cocktail, in which the Federal resources and

Federal experience was far greater and, therefore, was

22

resolved in that manner.

There is

there's agreement upon which body is the better to

There's cooperation, and in the norm,

And the fundamental issue I think here in

Federal law enforcement and criminal law enforcement is

not one of usurping the States or taking away from them

States' desire to punish and prosecute crime with the

MR. DREEBEN:

If there's some

substantial ability of the Federal Government to regulate

Now, these jurisdictional links are not

3

artificial in the sense that they are neither genuine,

they do clearly allow the Federal Government and the

Now, what I think that the Court should do is

recognize that when Congress has put a jurisdictional

there would be any real serious debate that the Federal

There was, of course, an eye

But when it is asserted that the Federal

10

Government has power to protect property, not

11

instrumentalities or items in interstate commerce, but all

12

property, based on a conception that was developed for

13

ways of regulating ways of doing business that have

14

intermingled effects on interstate commerce, and then it

15

is justified because there is a jurisdictional element,

16

which serves as a sort of logic puzzle that if the Federal

17

Government and the prosecutors can figure out a way to get

18

past a compliant lower court, it's just a way of putting

19

the pieces together on everything in the most basic State

crime -- areas of the State crime and the State power come

under Federal power, then it's okay.

Well, one thing it could not have meant to get by drafting

that language is the sort of idea that the mortgage

company is using the house, because if the mortgage

company or the insurer or the utility company or any of

using them for business purposes, and there would have

been absolutely no need to draft this -- draft this

language at all.
