ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BISHOP:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The preference amount of forage adjudicated

11
12

under the Taylor Grazing Act as necessary to the proper

13

use of a permittee's base property must be adequately

14

safeguarded by the Secretary.

15

QUESTION:

That's our contention.

Mr. Bishop, I think you've described,

16

and I think perhaps your opponents have described, the

17

proceeding you've brought here as a, quote, facial attack,

18

end quote, on the Secretary's regulations that are

19

challenged, and your opponents say, well, you -- except in

20

a First Amendment case you can't bring a facial challenge,

21

and are you using the term, facial challenge, in the same

22

sense we're use it in the First Amendment jurisprudence?

23

That is, that you can challenge a law even though it

24

doesn't affect you adversely if it affects someone else

25

adversely?

MR. BISHOP:

If, in all applications, the

regulation is unlawful because it is not authorized by the
statute, then it is facially invalid, and our position
is
QUESTION:

And it affects you adversely

automatically.
MR. BISHOP:

And it affects you adversely

automatically, that's right.
Our position is that we are entitled to the
protection, the adequate safeguarding of adjudicated
forage, and that by eliminating adjudicated forage from
the regulations it's no longer possible for the Secretary
to safeguard it.
QUESTION:

But --

QUESTION:

In other words --

QUESTION:

-- counsel, I never saw the word

adjudicated forage used in any regulation.

It seems to be

a term that you constantly use, but tell me what
regulation refers to adjudicated forage.
MR. BISHOP:

It doesn't appear in the statute.

Let me start with the statute.

It doesn't appear in the

statute in terms, but the concept is clearly in the Taylor
Grazing Act.
Congress recognized that in designating grazing
districts they would be oversubscribed.

It contemplated a

process in which the Secretary would determine who would

2

be able to graze in those districts, and it set out some

parameters, and the most important one,. in section 3 of

the grazing act, says preference shall be given in the

MR. BISHOP:

I'm sorry, Justice Scalia.
QUESTION:

7

What I don't understand is, you

acknowledge that it's within the power of the Secretary to

9

reduce you below that.

10

MR. BISHOP:

QUESTION:

Oh, absolutely, Justice Scalia.
So then I don't understand what

you're asking for.

of that you want to be given?

to this --

17

MR. BISHOP:

It -What is it the Secretary deprived you
You don't assert any right

We do assert rights to the

18

adjudicated amount, preference amount of forage.

19

argument is not about freezing actual grazing use at the

20

levels that the Secretary adjudicated after 1934, but

21

there are things that the preference amount does for us,

22

and just let me mention those.

2

use can be reduced below the preference amount.

3

when the preference was first adjudicated the active use

4

was often below the preference amount, right from the

5

beginning.

6

Now, we have no dispute that the active
In fact,

We have no dispute that the preference itself

7

can be readjudicated, and we have no dispute that the

8

grazing district can be readjudicated and the use given

9

over to something else, but as long as the land is

10

designated as a grazing district, then my preference gives

11

me a claim to more forage if it becomes available, so

12

under the Range Code 4110.3-1, for example, which is at

13

page 9a to 10a of the addendum to the blue brief,

14

permanent --

MR. BISHOP:

MR. BISHOP:

Page what?

Page what, Mr. Bishop?

9a to 10a of the blue brief.
Thank you.
And this is reflected in earlier

19

versions of the Range Code as well in different forms, but

20

permanent increases in forage were first allocated to

21

existing permittees up to the preference amount, and if

22

you look back to the 1942 code, the language is that

23

increases in carrying capacity will be participated in by

24

existing permittees to the extent of their respective

25

qualifications, but that idea has always been in there.

Well, if I understand what you're

13

saying, you're saying, well, we had claims to these

14

things, and you -- I accept that.

15

and you had a procedure to try to perfect that claim, but

16

there is no member of your association that I understand,

17

as I understand it, who at this time can say, I had a ripe

claim that was cut off.

19

old regs had been left in place, I might have had a claim

to pursue if further forage had -- land had become

available, and that claim as such is gone, as I understand

it.

distinct from the old regulation.
MR. BISHOP:

3

Am I wrong in that?

Well, it's a facial challenge, Your

4

Honor.

5

this record a history of the application of the 1995

6

regulations and, in fact, while the litigation has been

7

pending, and particularly because we won in the district

court, the agency really hasn't been doing anything under

9

the 1995 regulations.

everyone in your association is worse off --

Everyone is worse off because prior

amount of forage, labeled --

QUESTION:

Every single

No, I -- I don't mean to cut you off,

20

but I think you have made that clear.

But so far as the

21

forage which you are entitled to enjoy at any given

22

moment, now or a year from now, as I understand it, you

23

can't say that any member of your association is going to

be worse off a year from now under the new regs than he

would have been under the old ones, is that correct?

QUESTION:

We -- well, we are -We have a whole brief here saying,

cows, him 300 cows, her 200 cows, and that's it, 500, 300,

I would hope would preserve that issue, if someone is

2

inclined to go that way, is that at the end of our brief

3

we did say that on the Chevron stage 2 we don't think that

4

there's an adequate justification.
QUESTION:

5

I don't see what Chevron stage 2 has

6

to do with it.

I see what State Farm has to do with it.

7

That's the agency has to provide a good reason for

8

changing its mind in an important matter, but I don't see

9

what Chevron stage 2 has to do with it.
MR. BISHOP:

10

Well, what we have -- I mean,

11

the -- our argument, Your Honor, is that the statute

12

requires this, the Secretary's been doing it for a long

13

time, that Congress revisited this area without changing

14

the Secretary's regulations, that Congress in 1993

15

specifically refused to enact these regulations when the

16

affirmative defense asked them to, and that there has been

17

no -- and certainly there has been no explanation of -- as

18

to why the Secretary --

of that.
QUESTION:

I'm very puzzled by your, Congress

you preserve, but Congress didn't enact that --

2

MR. BISHOP:

3

QUESTION:

Well --- and it seems to me that that --

4

what Congress didn't do in 1946 and 1953 is much more

5

relevant than what you're urging about a tack-on to an

6

appropriations bill.

7

MR. BISHOP:

Well, now, Congress didn't need to

8

do that, because it had already provided in the Taylor

9

Grazing Act that adjudicated privileges that grazing

10

privileges, including this adjudicated amount of forage,

11

should be adequately safeguarded, and Congress was

12

concerned that that not ripen into a right to the land,

13

which is why the no right, title, or interest that the

14

Court addressed in Fuller is in there.
But Congress did, in saying that necessary,

15
16

adjudicated necessary amounts of forage should be

17

adequately safeguard, adequately safeguarded, intend that

18

the Secretary continue to recognize and provide protection

19

for those forage amounts.
QUESTION:

So --

But the amounts you conceded the

21

actual amounts you can use the Secretary not only can but

MR. BISHOP:

The Secretary must adjust that, and

2

if I can just get back to Justice Scalia's initial

3

question, I'd just like to finish my list of what it is

4

that we think we do get from the preference.

5

I mean, first of all we get the claim to

6

additional permanent forage when it becomes available.

7

The preference amount has always been the baseline for

8

measuring suspended use, and the permit, every permit

9

preference, a line for preference, a line for suspended

10

use, a line for active use.

11

listed, and that's the difference between active use and

12

the preference amount, and it becomes available under the

regulations to the permittee --

Does this claim --- if the forage is increased.

MR. BISHOP:

I think that those are ways in

which the Secretary has adequately safeguarded the
preference in the past.
Now, I'm not suggesting that all of those in

12

their detailed ways as set out in the regulations

13

necessary -- necessarily have to continue.

14

adequately safeguarded doesn't have a determinate meaning,

15

but it clearly does mean that the Secretary must continue

16

to recognize and deal with the preference, so if I can

17

give one other example, the preference amount establishes

18

claims relative to the claims to forage of a permittee's

19

neighbors on the allotment and to new applicants, so it

20

prevents the BLM from shifting AUM's at will among

21

permittees and applicants.

22

I think that

In the McNeil v. Seaton case, which we cited in

23

our briefs as an example of that, where the Secretary

24

tried to give forage to a new applicant when there were

QUESTION:

But as I understand that, they

couldn't do that under the present regulation, either,

because they do say they protect their priority over other

Under the current rules, the permitted use rule

4

will allow the Secretary to set the permitted use

5

essentially in his discretion, without constraints.

6

QUESTION:

Well, in a sense that's true already.

7

The Secretary has felt free to lower the number of cattle,

8

for instance, to be grazed on a particular piece of land

9

for some time.

10

MR. BISHOP:

Are you talking about active,

11

active use, Justice O'Connor?

MR. BISHOP:

Yes.
Through active use, that is true,

and we have no objection to that.

clearly require that the -- that on an individualized

basis, in a site -- using a site-specific analysis, that

Our claim is that the preference itself, the

19

preference amount that the Secretary has recognized for 60

20

years, which is always higher than the active use, and

21

which gives us certain claims, has to be recognized.

22

QUESTION:

What claims would it give you?

me an example, a concrete example of how you would be

better off if you had this supplemental preference which

MR. BISHOP:

Well, I mean, my argument is this,

that the statute, and a look at the history since the

statute was passed, mandates that preference amounts of

forage be adequately safeguarded.

safeguarded ceases to mean anything at all if the

They have fallen far

In fact, the regulations reflect a reasonable

that the regulation would be beyond the Secretary's

8

authority in all of its applications.

9

But as I understand petitioner's fundamental

10

point, it is that in the land use planning process, which

11

is based on principles of multiple use, that the grazing

12

that they have previously been permitted to engage in will

13

not be adequately respected, or taken into account, or

weighed into the balance.

for grazing.

2

existing ranchers tries to take 1 acre more than his

3

proportionate share, he cannot get it, in no circumstance.

4

That's the old system, and on that system they can get

financing.

6

Then there is a new system which more or less

7

agrees you have total right to control the amount of

grazing, but as to apportionment and new ranchers, it's up

for grabs, and that, it seems to me, is what they're

First, what they are describing is a prior

QUESTION:

MR. KNEEDLER:

123a of the petition appendix.

123, thank you.
And if you put them side-by-

4

side, there is actually essentially no change in the

5

allocation of additional forage as it becomes available,

6

and the same is correspondingly true with respect to a

7

decrease in forage.

8

Those regulations say, for example, if you look

9

at the petition appendix under the current regulation, on

10

123a, additional forage may be apportioned to qualified

11

applicants.

12

That's temporarily available livestock grazing.

14

Paragraph (a) is essentially irrelevant.

QUESTION:

(b) is

I understood the basic argument was

2

that was referred to here will be given to the ranchers

3

who already have suspended use.

4

QUESTION:

But not former adjudicated use.

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, it is -- that is essentially

6

what it is, because the current permits carry forward the

7

amount of, the number of AUM's that a person has been able

8

to graze under a permit, and the new permitted use

9

regulation requires that the number of AUM's be specified

10
11

in the permit.

That has not changed.

QUESTION:

And you insist that henceforth the

12

permits that are given will still reflect the original

13

adjudicated AUM's?

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, unless they are changed,

15

because what -- and this comes about as -- essentially as

16

a matter of the way the administrative process works.

17

somebody has an existing permit for, let's say, 100 AUM's

18

19

the permit, and BLM is going to say no, it should only be

80, well, the challenge will arise by comparing what it

21

used to be with what it now is, and therefore under the

why the conditions on the range require a lessening of the

But as petitioners have acknowledged, it's not

2

realistic to think that those historical uses are going to

3

get up to what they had been, and one of the purposes of

4

the Secretary's new approach here not to allow new

5

suspended -- the next time there's a permanent, more or

6

less long-term reduction to put that into the suspended

7

use category is that it doesn't reflect reality.

MR. KNEEDLER:

And it's better to have the

10

system reflect the present-day reality of what the active

11

grazing -- and lenders will know what the active -- the

12

permitted use under the permit is, the rancher will know

13

what the permitted use under the permit is, those involved

14

in the land use planning and BLM and the public will know,

not paper cows put into a suspended use account, but what

16

is actually going on on the range.

QUESTION:

Well, but that's their objection.

I

18

think that's their objection, and they say that the -- and

19

when I read the comments in the, you know, the rule-

20

making, they raised the objection and they said that the

21

change is going to be that this suspended use will

22

disappear and instead their potential future right, which

23

may never come about, will depend on the land use plan,

24

and the response to that I think was, the land use plan

25

allows adjustment of the AUM amount.

in the rule-making process that it was his judgment that

for example, the provision of FLPMA that deals with

grazing permits, 1752, and if one looks at -- if you look

4

at page 114a of the petition appendix --

There's a whole section of FLPMA that deals with

QUESTION:

5

Well, then, that -- is grazing a

6

specific use in another law, specifically Taylor Grazing

7

Act?

8

9

I didn't understand how to interpret that.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, it is clear that Congress

intended to bring grazing under the multiple use

10

requirements of FLPMA, and the regulations promulgated by

11

the Secretary of the Interior in 1978, right after FLPMA,

12

the same set of regulations that petitioners wish we would

13

go back to, made clear the Secretary's understanding that

14

FLPMA required grazing to be regulated.

15

And if you look on subsection (c) on page 114a,

16

where it talks about first priority for the renewal of an

17

existing permit, so it is talking about grazing that is

18

already occurring, it says, so long as the lands for which

19

the permit is issued remain available for domestic

20

livestock grazing in accordance with land use plans

21

prepared pursuant to section 1712.

22

So it's clear that -- if it wasn't clear before

23

that the Taylor Grazing Act wasn't just a grazing statute

24

but also a multiple use statute, these provisions of FLPMA

25

make clear, and in fact this section also makes clear that
44

1

there is certainly no statutory right to a permanent

2

entitlement to the amount of grazing that may have been

3

adjudicated many years ago when the range was originally

4

being apportioned under very different circumstances.

5

Because it says even the right of renewal of a

6

permit, something that a person has a preference to, is

7

present after FLPMA only if the Secretary chooses to make

8

the lands available for grazing, the permittee is in

9

compliance with the rules and regulations and terms and

10

conditions, and he accepts the new terms and conditions of

11

the new permit, thereby once again making clear that the

12

Secretary of the Interior has the authority to prescribe

13

the terms an\d conditions for grazing on the public lands.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, what has the Secretary

15

actually done with respect to land use plans following the

16

enactment of this law, or has it been in suspense because

17

of the litigation?

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

As we -- the land use plan

19

requirement came into effect in 1978, and as we point out

20

in our brief, all grazing covered by the Taylor Grazing

21

Act is now covered by land use plans, either prior, what

22

were called framework plans, or the new resource

24

anything to this Court that suggests that that land use

1

stability in the areas covered by those plans, has failed

2

to take into account existing grazing.

3

And as we also point out in our brief, the

4

Taylor Grazing Act -- excuse me, FLPMA and implementing

5

regulations refer to existing uses of the range, the

6

dependence of local properties and private property and

7

local communities on the range, so the land use planning

8

process, which also has broad public participation and

9

allows for grazing permittees to participate in the

10

planning process and to appeal, affords ranchers, as

11

others who have a stake in the use of the public domain,

12

it assures them protection for their interests.

13

If I could also point out that in the rule-

14

making, in response to your question, Justice Breyer, I

15

realize it hasn't been challenge on a failure to

16

articulate, but pages 9921 to 9923 of 60 Federal Register

17

and the proposed notice at 59 Federal Register at 9928

18

explain the Secretary's reasons for what he explained was

19

essentially a change in terminology between the

20

permitted -- the new definition of permitted use, which

21

corresponds to sentence 4 of the Taylor Grazing Act

22

dealing with the numbers of livestock from time to time,

23

separating that from preference, which is governed by

24

sentence 3 of section 3 of the Taylor Grazing Act, which

Taylor Grazing Act, as may be necessary, again was a way

2

of apportioning up the land at the time the act went into

3

effect, but it's important to notice that the renewal

4

permit provision of FLPMA makes it clear that there is not

5

an ongoing entitlement to a certain amount of public

6

rangeland in order to satisfy whatever the base properties

7

ranching requirements are, because all there is is a

8

preference to renewal of the permit for a particular
allotment, but the land use planning process or other

ecological determinations may conclude that that

11

particular allotment can only sustain 50 percent of the

12

grazing that it previously allowed.

13

That may be less public land than would be

necessary to sustain the full ranch on the base property,

nothing after FLPMA, would allow a rancher to say, I have

It also says, grazing privileges recognized and

provisions of the Taylor Grazing Act itself and

regulations that allow the Secretary to reduce grazing to

just exercising the authority that any landlord or any

added to the land.

16

That simplifies it.

to arcane rules of fixtures under property law.

18

19

ownership of improvements will be, which greatly

20

simplifies the administration of what are after all public

21

lands, so that there will not be private stakeholdings,

22

private fixtures on public lands, and after all, if they

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BISHOP:

9

Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.

I just don't see the broad

discretion in the TGA that Mr. Kneedler does.

Preference

was adjudicated according to what was necessary for the

11

proper use of the base property and the statute says that

12

the privileges, including that adjudicated amount of

13

forage, have to be adequately safeguarded.
The reason that this is a facial challenge is

14
15

that the 1995 regulations define permitted use by

16

reference to a land use plan, and without any reference

17

whatsoever to the preference amount adjudicated as

18

necessary.

Well, I don't really concede that.

10

absence of this suspended use, but you're not complaining

11

about what the Secretary did as far as active use is

12

concerned?

13

MR. BISHOP:

That's right.

I mean, active use

14

is varied according to the condition of the range.

15

we are complaining about is the loss of a claim to more

16

active use, based on our preference, and it's not the land

17

use plan.

18

Mr. Kneedler suggests that that has changed everything.

Land use planning for sustained yield and multiple use

preference amount continued side-by-side.
