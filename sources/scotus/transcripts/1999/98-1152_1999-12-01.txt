ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. SETH P. WAXMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
GEN. WAXMAN:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Following the most extensive rulemaking in its

12

history, the Food and Drug Administration concluded that

13

nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco is highly

14

addictive and has three other strong pharmacological

15

effects on the body as a sedative, a stimulant, and an

16

appetite suppressant.

17

manufacturers know this, that they know that consumers

18

predominantly use their products to obtain these effects,

1

and indeed that they engineer their products to deliver

20

the precise doses of nicotine that consumers need to

21

obtain its powerful effects.

22

The FDA found that the

The question presented in this case is, whether

23

given those findings, the FDA validly concluded that these

24

products are drug-delivery devices under the Food, Drug

25

and Cosmetic Act.

The Act defines drugs and devices to

3

the FDA found that nicotine is intended to do so in four

4

quintessentially drug-like ways.

5

acts as a stimulant.

Like Dexatrim, it suppresses appetite, and like Methadone,

7

it's used to satisfy an addiction.

"...articles (other than food) intended to

doesn't fit.

The -- the FDA is --

Okay.
-- and explain why?

Yeah.

GEN. WAXMAN:

The Act requires that with respect

11

to devices -- and what we're talking about here is a

12

combination product which the FDA, beginning with the 1

13

amendments, was authorized to regulate, that is, a product

14

that -- that combines drug components and device

15

components, but this combination product regulated under

16

the agency's device authorities must be found and marketed

17

under conditions, distributed under conditions that the

18

FDA finds to be reasonably safe and effective for its

1

intended uses.

20

With respect to devices that preexisted the

21

enactment of the 1 76 device amendments and the 1

22

combination product amendments, the Act contemplates and

23

requires that after the FDA asserts jurisdiction and

24

regulation over a particular device, but not before, the

25

FDA will engage in a classification process for the

devices which is explained in great detail in the Act at

2

Section 360(c), 360(d), and 360(e), and in that

3

classification process, which will take place with respect

4

to these products, the agency will be required to

5

determine what controls and under what conditions these

6

articles may be marketed and distributed with reasonable

7

assurances of safety and effectiveness.

8

9

Now, at this point --we have not gotten to the
classification point yet, but at this point, where the

10

agency has determined in response to petitions and in

11

response to the overwhelming scientific data that it can

12

and should assert certain regulatory controls, it has

13

determined to -- to regulate these products as restricted

14

devices under its authority given to it in 1976 and

15

reflected in Section 360(j)(E).

GEN. WAXMAN:

The answer is the agency --

We don't know.
The agency --

That's basically what you're saying.
The agency has made -- and the

agency is required to make --

such a statement

GEN. WAXMAN:

3

QUESTION:

4

The agency --

-- under any classification that this

stuff is safe?

5

GEN. WAXMAN:

The agency not only thinks, but

6

the agency has explained in very considerable length in

7

its Final Rule that it -- it believes at this point that

8

it will be able to make determinations with respect to

9

both effectiveness and safety.
With respect to effectiveness, it has found that

10
11

for at least one of the four known pharmacological

12

effects, that is, addiction, that cigarette smoke and the

13

nicotine in cigarettes is in fact quite effective for

14

sustaining addiction, and it may also find through the

15

classification process that it is effective for the other

16

chemical effects, that is, to -- to provide sedation,

17

stimulation, and

18

weight --

19

QUESTION:

It does have all of the harmful

20

effects that -- that is the purpose of -- of its

21

distribution.

GEN. WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

24

GEN. WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

There -- there is no question.

Right.

What about the second?

No question.

What about the safety?

1

GEN. WAXMAN:

Now, with respect to safety, the

2

Act requires that safety or, with the case of device,

3

reasonable assurance of safety be determined in the

4

classification process by means of a weighing process that

5

is specified in the statute and was outlined by this Court

6

in Rutherford in which the agency weighs not with respect

7

to the world at large, as the Respondents claim, but with

8

respect to the -- the public that consumes these products,
the risks versus benefits of using -- of making these

10
11

products available versus taking them off the market.
Now, in its rulemaking, the agency was careful

12

to say that it was not making a final determination about

13

this, but based on all of the evidence that it had

14

reviewed to date, both the scientific data with respect to

15

the properties of nicotine and the properties of these

16

devices and the epidemiological and behavioral science

17

data about why people use it and at what stage they use

18

it, it made a determination that on balance, the

1

appropriate means of regulating this product was twofold.

20

One, because almost all people who become

21

addicted smokers or addicted users of smokeless tobacco

22

begin when they are children or adolescents -- and the

23

data is overwhelming on this -- the -- the distribution or

24

sale to those people should be prohibited.

25

likely to be unsafe for those people for all purposes -8

GEN. WAXMAN:

but with all due respect, Mr. Chief Justice, the agency

made a determination with respect --

Well, yeah, but --

QUESTION:

-- to two categories of people.

But when -- when a member of the

Court asks you a question, it's better to give the answer

18, the agencies made a preliminary safety-ness or

2

reasonable assurance of safety-ness determination that a

3

ban was required.
With respect to persons over 18, the majority of

4
5

whom the agency found are in fact addicted to these

6

products, the agency concluded that a ban would be more

7

dangerous to these people than allowing these people, most

8

of whom are addicted, to continue to use the products
pending a

10

QUESTION:

But it's --

11

GEN. WAXMAN:

12

QUESTION:

-- final review.

It -- it just -- it -- it strains

13

credibility to say that these products can be safe in

14

light of the findings.

15

anybody could stand here and say fine, they're safe, so

16

we'll permit them to be used.

I just don't understand how

I think the conclusion under the statute is if
they are covered, they have to be -- it has to be banned.
GEN. WAXMAN:

Well, but with all respect,

20

Justice O'Connor, the agency, first of all, has made only

21

a preliminary determination with respect to safety, and it

22

has made it clear that if during the classification

23

process, which requires the convening of panels, including

24

representatives of the manufacturers and the scientific

25

industry, that there are no controls or restrictions that

could make it safe, taking into account the balance, a ban

may be required of these products, and you may have the

result that the agency, which has concluded that that

might --

QUESTION:

And do you think --do you think it's

clear that Congress intended that under this Act?

7

GEN. WAXMAN:

8

QUESTION:

9

What I --

I mean, we certainly operated for a

long time with the understanding that it wasn't covered --

10

GEN. WAXMAN:

11

QUESTION:

Well, the --

-- and this is a very recent

12

phenomenon, and it just -- it doesn't fit very well under

13

the structure of the statute.

14

QUESTION:

An understanding, I might add, that

15

-- that had been conveyed to Congress by -- by the heads

16

of the FDA on numerous occasions when Congress had various

17

pieces of legislation dealing with tobacco before it.

18

seems to me Congress enacted these statutes on the

19

assumption of the state of the law that -- that they had

20

been assured by the agency itself existed at the time.

21

GEN. WAXMAN:

It

Well, with respect to the prior

22

statements and the long assumption or assumption that

23

didn't exist, I think in order to go back and understand

24

what the Congress may or may not have concluded in 1938 --

25

and this Court has said many times that this is a statute

1

that was not directed at particular articles, but rather

2

laid out general principles and definitions and intended

3

the agency to apply its regulatory authorities to those

4

definitions where appropriate -- the agency, to be sure,

5

has stated repeatedly before Congress and in the courts

6

and in the public many times for a long period up until

7

1995, that it did not believe that it had sufficient

8

jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products absent claims

9

made about the effects that those products would have on

10

the body, and in order to understand why that was so, I

11

think it's -- it's probably best to look at what caused

12

the agency to change its mind.

13

This is an agency that is required to act on the

14

basis, first of all, of scientific data, not general

15

understandings, and, second of all, an agency that is

16

required to act with respect to not uses, but intended

17

uses, and since 1938, the agency has had in place a

18

regulation that explains that -- that the manufacturer's

19

intent is to be determined based on the totality of the

20

circumstances and it is the intent that a reasonable

21

fact-finder would impute to the manufacturer based on all

22

of the objective evidence.

23

Now, in 1995, the agency heard overwhelming

24

evidence and concluded, number one, that there was an

25

absolute scientific consensus that nicotine is a highly

QUESTION:

That certainly wasn't the first time

that that scientific consensus evolved, was it?

Well, it -- it actually --

The Surgeon General's warning date --

GEN. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, in 1994, the

8

chief executive officers of virtually all of the

9

Respondents sat 500 yards from this courtroom and

10

testified under oath that -- that nicotine in cigarette

11

products and smokeless products was not addictive and that

(Laughter.)

19

GEN. WAXMAN:

At the -- with all due respect, at

20

the time the Surgeon General issued his report in 1994,

21

the Surgeon General found that there was not sufficient

22

evidence to conclude that nicotine was addictive.

23

only in 1988 that the Surgeon General did find that it was

24

addictive, and it was largely in the early and mid-'90s

25

that there became a consensus that this product was

It was

2

The agency also found and acted in 1996 --

3

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

What -- why is the

4

addictiveness alone necessary for the FDA's jurisdiction?

5

Wasn't it clear from the early '60s?

6

clear in 1938?

7

States began -- some States had -- a number of States

8

banned cigarettes as early as 1900, and -- and those other

9

harmful effects, whether the addiction was obvious or not,

Indeed, wasn't it

Wasn't it clear much earlier than that?

10

were surely well known, and wouldn't they alone have been

11

enough to require the FDA to come in?

effect is achieved, but certainly from the beginning,

2

there couldn't have been any doubt that people were taking

3

these things for their effect on the body and that they

4

were being sold for people for that purpose.
GEN. WAXMAN:

5

Well, I -- with all due respect,

6

Justice Souter, there were -- I -- I -- I can't place

7

myself back in -- in 1938, but reading some of the

8

materials that the Respondents have submitted and others,

9

there were -- it was generally understood that people

10

smoked because it was soothing or because it gave them

11

status or --

QUESTION:

That's an effect on the body.

13

GEN. WAXMAN:

14

QUESTION:

15

GEN. WAXMAN:

Yes.

It's an effect on the body.
And with respect to that, again,

16

I -- without repeating myself, this is an agency that is

17

mandated and expected to act on the basis of scientific

18

evidence.

Suppose the studies show that?

GEN. WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

GEN. WAXMAN:

Well, Justice O'Connor --

I mean --- no -- no one has ever seriously

suggested that the FDA exercise regulatory jurisdiction

But --

--no one would have suggested they

exercise jurisdiction over cigarettes.
GEN. WAXMAN:

And -- and they would not

16

reasonably have done so.

17

what the agency does in response to a petition when

18

deciding to exercise its regulatory controls, is to look

19

at the language of the statute and see whether it's

covered and then to do what all other administrative

I -- I don't

think there's any dispute about that.
The agency -- in response to the horror movie

question and the gun question, the agency looks first to

16

the language of the Act, the definitional sections and the

17

operative provisions, to see whether or not this is

18

something that with respect to subsection (c) is intended

19

to affect the structure or any function of the body.

20

then does what all agencies do and what all courts do,

21

which is to look at the practice, that is, does this

22

article and do its intended effects resemble the kinds of

23

articles and intended effects that have always been

regulated, the same process that this Court 150 years ago

regulated and permitted to be marketed a drug, I think,

called fenfluradine, which was used to reduce weight in

became known to the FDA that it was commonly being used

with another drug that also starts with "fen" and was

producing an alarming incidence of mitral heart valve

certain studies.

with respect to any one of the technical problems that

2

have been raised and I think in -- in large part answered

by you, but in the totality of them.
Number one, there's -- there's no question that

4
5

the paradigm examples of FDA regulation is regulation of

6

substances that are put forward for purposes of -- of

7

health or -- or curing disease or whatnot, even though

8

there are exceptions.
Number two, it seems to me the paradigm way that

9
10

the FDA goes about it is on a claims-made basis.

There

11

are exceptions to it, and you're entirely right under --

12

under intended use, but most of the time what's going on

13

is a response to a claims-made kind of scheme.
Number three, for a long period of time, the

14
15

agency, for whatever reason, said we have no jurisdiction

16

over this.

17

the fact that they could certainly bring cigarettes within

18

the definition of "drug" even if they weren't sure of the

19

mechanism.

It said that despite, at least in my judgment,

20

Number four, the agency at this point at least

21

is saying we will regulate, but right now it seems to us

22

that there is a balance of goodness in favor of

23

cigarettes, so we're not going to ban, and that seems in

24

traditional practice to be a kind of unusual analysis.

absence of FDA jurisdiction, the Congress has gone in, not

2

with a global regulatory scheme, but with a lot of

3

congressional statutes that attack various parts of the

4

cigarette problem.

5

When you take all of that together, what bothers

6

me about the Government's position is that it does not

7

seem to me that it is reasonable at this point for the

8

Government to construe its statutes in a way that asserts

9

regulation.

It's the -- it's the global problem, not the

technical problems, that bother me.
GEN. WAXMAN:

Justice Souter, I think in the

12

time remaining, I guess the best way that I can answer the

13

question is to posit the following.

14

The tobacco company's principal submission is

15

that their product, contrary to the testimony they gave a

16

few years ago, is so dangerous, that if the FDA has to

17

regulate it -- and they concede that there is nothing in

18

-- in the statute or in any of these later specific

19

statutes that either precludes or preempts the FDA from

20

exercising the authority that it has, but it is now so

21

dangerous that if the FDA regulates, it will have to ban,

22

and that is a ridiculous public health result that

23

Congress never could have intended.

to the body, like a cigarette or a syringe, there is no

2

problem applying the literal meaning, but in any event,

3

the FDA went way beyond applying a literal meaning and

4

looked at great length to the extent to which these

5

devices -- and their intended effects resembled things

6

over which they already regulated.

7

they are right, if these products, because they are

8

dangerous, must be banned, and the FDA cannot work with

9

Congress to -- to accomplish an amendment to the statute

But my point is if

10

that would, like so many other product-specific

11

amendments, like saccharine, that have been enacted to

12

enable the FDA to continue to regulate in accordance with

13

its public health mandate, then two things will happen.

14

One, we will have an inability of this agency with the

15

paradigmatic responsibility to, for example, require them

16

to use a filter or add a substance that would make these

17

things less causing -- less able to cause cancer or less

18

addictive, and, number two, we would have them remain as

19

if not the only -- virtually the only finished product

20

that is ingested in the body that is regulated and

inspected by no Federal agency and yet is so dangerous.

MR. COOPER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Solicitor General was not entirely accurate

4
5

in stating our position.

We do contend that the

6

tobacco-specific statutes preclude FDA from exercising

7

jurisdiction, and that's an argument independent of the

8

Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act arguments.
I want to pick up on the answers to the

9
10

questions from Justice O'Connor and Justice Scalia.

the scope of FDA jurisdiction and the need for addiction,

12

I'm going to read from the passage in the Final Rule, page

15

nontherapeutic, beneficial or adverse, thus, does not

any function of

that any effect, even an adverse one, brings a product

No, there's not an intent here.

again, the tobacco-specific statutes would preclude FDA

jurisdiction.

QUESTION:

So you think there had been a partial

repeal of the FDA?
MR. COOPER:

No.

I think when the -- I think

jurisdiction had not been determined favorably -- in favor

22

of jurisdiction prior to the enactment of the

QUESTION:

2

Your position, if I understand it, is

3

that although there may have been Chevron play in the

4

joints originally in the statute after there's other

5

legislation which has to be taken into account, step one

6

of Chevron is no longer passed.

7

MR. COOPER:

Yes, with an addendum that there

8

are then multiple statutes, most of which are not

9

administered by FDA, so that deference under Chevron would

10

not be appropriate, and even at Chevron step one, before

11

the enactment of the tobacco-specific statutes, we still

12

have the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act not being able to

13

accommodate these products.
QUESTION:

14

But I still want to know.

Do you

15

think that those statutes amended the Food, Drug -- the

16

Food Act?

17

MR. COOPER:

18

QUESTION:

They did not amend it.
So your basic position is that even

19

if none of those statutes had been passed, you would still

20

not be subject to the statute because you did not have the

21

requisite intent because you didn't advertise the

22

cigarettes as being addictive.

23

MR. COOPER:

but I thought the heart of your argument was that there's

no intent because there's no claim that had these -- these

positions.

4

MR. COOPER:

Our argument has multiple parts.

5

I would submit that the tobacco-specific

6

statutes are the most relevant because they're the ones

7

that tell us how Congress has dealt with tobacco and

8

health, how Congress wants these products --

9

QUESTION:

Yes, but the problem with that -- let

10

me just get it right on the table.

11

is it seems to me at least theoretically possible that

12

until 1990, say, you had no intent to make this stuff

13

addictive and there was no evidence, objective evidence of

14

such an intent, but in 1994 or '95, such evidence -- you

15

changed your minds, and you then decided on a new

16

marketing strategy with this intent, and then -- and then

17

for the first time became under the statute.

me, that's at least theoretically possible.

And on your view, the FDA could not

they could not regulate it; isn't that right?
MR. COOPER:

thought the claim, of course, is always present with

10

that we do have a product that everybody knows what it

11

does, and that's why I ask whether claim isn't really

12

indicative of intent rather than the other way around.

13

Why do you need the word "claim" which isn't in the

statute --

You need --- when in fact you have the product

As part of your discussion, perhaps you could

Give you one other example.

FDA acknowledges

that the cigarette and smokeless statutes prevented from

products.

These are products sold over the counter.

11

Health information on drugs and devices sold over the

12

counter is the predominant way that FDA ensures that these

13

products are safe and effective.

14

from FDA, as Congress did with respect to tobacco

15

products, there's no way to ensure as a practical matter

16

that these products be safe and effective.

17

no sense for Congress to delegate to FDA authority to

GEN. WAXMAN:

Lawless.

The agency has made a

reasoned determination about a statute that this Court has

16

always given it great deference to, and this -- which this

17

Court has uniformly said must be given a broad reading to

2

we've cited many of the instances in our -- in our brief

3

-- nonetheless, intended use has to be meant to read -- to

read claim.

5

That -- if this Court were to construe the FDCA to have

6

intended use mean market claims would revolutionalize the

7

way this agency has done business for more than 60 years,

8

and it would create the largest regulatory hole in

existence by allowing anyone, no matter how dangerous or

it provides satisfaction, or it's ibuprofen, we're not
