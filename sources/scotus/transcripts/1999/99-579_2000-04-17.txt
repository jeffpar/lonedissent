ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LONG:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

The issue in this case is whether ERISA provides

12

a cause of action for appropriate equitable relief against

3

a party in interest who engages in a prohibited

4

transaction with an ERISA plan.

5

provides that such actions are available for two reasons,

6

and they correspond to our two arguments today.

7

The text of ERISA

First, based on all the relevant statutory

8

language, ERISA's prohibited transaction provisions apply

9

to parties in interest as well as to fiduciaries and,

20

second, ERISA's carefully crafted civil enforcement

21

provisions in section 502 authorize actions for

22

restitution of plan assets transferred in a prohibited

23

transaction without regard to whether the party in

24

interest is itself deemed a violator of ERISA.

25

QUESTION:

If the provision allows suit against

1

parties in interest, why wouldn't it also allow suits

2

against persons who are not parties in interest?

3
4
5

MR. LONG:

Well, again, we make two arguments,

QUESTION:

Because I mean, the provision you're

Justice --

6

relying on doesn't say, parties in interest.

7

says fiduciaries nor parties in interest, and if you're

8

going to say that it doesn't matter who it says is the

9

defendant, then I guess we have to say the defendants

10

11

It neither

could be anybody.
MR. LONG:

Well, our first argument is that

12

outside of section 502(a)(3) ERISA does say in section 406

13

and section 502 (i) and section 4975 that parties in

14

interest are not to engage in prohibited transactions.

15

they do, they're subject to punitive penalties and taxes,

16

so that distinguishes the party-in-interest transactions

17

from other sorts of nonfiduciary activity.

18

QUESTION:

True, but those are not the sections

19

that create the cause of action.

20

the cause of action doesn't say whom it's against.

The section that creates

21

MR. LONG:

Well, and that --

22

QUESTION:

You say that it doesn't matter

23

whether it says whom it's against.

QUESTION:

-- whenever it's equitable to get the

2

money out of somebody's hide.

3

MR. LONG:

And that is our second argument, and

4

under our second argument, looking to the language of

5

502(a)(3), the plain language, it -- you're correct, it

6

does not matter when there is a violation of -- any

7

violation of any provision of title I, the plain language

8

of 502(a)(3)

9

action for appropriate, equitable relief to redress the

10

11

is that there shall be a civil cause of

violation, and the -QUESTION:

Any other instance where, you know,

12

the United States Code, or even a State code, creates a

13

cause of action without saying whom it's against?

14

MR. LONG:

Well, I think, I mean, Congress --

15

the Court has said several times that this is a very

16

carefully crafted provision and the Court will not tamper

17

with its language, and it's -- what Congress did here was

18

deliberate.

19

preceding subsection 502(a)(2), that's limited to

20

fiduciaries.

It's -- if you look at other provisions, the.

If you look at the preceding section --

QUESTION:

Where is that set forth in the

briefs, 502(a)(2)?
MR. LONG:

24

Chief Justice, in the joint appendix, and 502(a)(2) is on

25

page 254 of the joint appendix.

QUESTION:

Thank you.

2

MR. LONG:

And that provision provides for an

3

action by the Secretary or by a participant beneficiary or

4

fiduciary for appropriate relief under section 409, and

5

section 409, in turn, is limited to fiduciary breaches,

6

and two other examples, if you look to section -QUESTION:

Excuse me.

Make the point again.

You're saying --

9

MR. LONG:

The point --

10

QUESTION:

-- 502(a)(2)

11

MR. LONG:

The point very simply, Justice

--

12

Scalia, is that if Congress had meant to limit 502(a)(3)

3

to any fiduciary who violates any provision of ERISA or

4

any person who violates any provision of ERISA, it would

5

have said so.

fiduciaries.

that is modeled directly on 502(a)(3).

502(a)(2) is an example of a limitation to
Another good example is the Federal Employee

of our reply brief.

That is a provision
Congress picked up

20

precisely the language of 502(a)(3) with an important

21

change.

footnote.

2

QUESTION:

Thank you.

3

MR. LONG:

And that provision says that a civil

4

action may be brought by the Secretary of Labor or any

5

participant beneficiary or fiduciary against any fiduciary

6

to enjoin any act or practice which violates any

7

provision, or to obtain any other appropriate equitable

8

relief, so when Congress wanted to limit the cause of

9

action to any fiduciary or any person, it knew how to do

10

it.
Another provision which is not cited in our

11
12

brief, and I apologize for this, section 501 of ERISA that

13

precedes 502, that section provides that any person who

14

wilfully violates any provision of the reporting and

15

disclosure requirements is liable, so Congress was very

16

deliberate about the language it used.

17

limit liability to any person or any fiduciary, it said

18

so.

When it wanted to

19

QUESTION:

Or any person who's violated, so you

20

really think that the best --

21

MR. LONG:

Well --

22

QUESTION:

-- reading of this provision is that

23

you can bring the action against anyone, even someone who

24

has not been in violation of the law.

25

MR. LONG:

Yes, Your Honor.

It says any act or

1

practice which violates a provision of ERISA, and then it

2

says, for appropriate equitable relief to redress the

3

violation, and that dovetails with the reference to any

4

act or practice, because appropriate equitable relief

5

certainly includes a constructive trust, and the nature of

6

a constructive trust is that it follows the assets.

7

doesn't look to whether the person in possession of the

8

assets was a violator.
QUESTION:

9

It

Well, but it doesn't say just

10

constructive -- I mean, it's an extraordinary,

11

extraordinary intent to attribute to Congress, that it

12

essentially left it up to the courts to decide who is

13

liable.

14

MR. LONG:

Well, it is based --

15

QUESTION:

Because I mean, a court could say,

16

somebody who knew of this violative transaction, who has

17

no other connection with the thing at all, just knew about

18

it and did not blow the whistle, presumably a court could

19

say that person should cough up some money.

20

MR. LONG:

Well, first, this is in the language

21

of the statute.

We're attributing this to Congress

22

because Congress expressly referred to appropriate

23

equitable relief.

24

QUESTION:

That's right.

25

MR. LONG:

And second, it is a self-limiting

type of relief.

2

limited situations where --

3

The constructive trust only applies in

QUESTION:

Well, a constructive trust is pretty

4

much of a gimmick, isn't it, that courts have made up to

5

do something that they wanted to do and couldn't find any

6

other reason for it?

7

(Laughter.)
MR. LONG:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice.

Well, I wouldn't call it a gimmick,
It's expressly referred to by the

10

Senate in the report that created this appropriate

11

equitable relief provision.
QUESTION:

12

3

It's a well-established --

I thought you were seeking -- your

client was seeking restitution.

4

MR. LONG:

Well, restitution pursuant to a

5

constructive trust is a classic form of equitable relief,

6

so that is -- that's how a constructive trust gets into

7

it.

8

QUESTION:

Where you allege unjust enrichment --

9

MR. LONG:

Yes.

20

QUESTION:

-- on the basis that the respondent

21

was employed as the investment advisor for this plan --

MR. LONG:

Yes.

back to -- we have the narrower argument and the broader

argument.

transaction what Congress expressly said, parties in

4

interest are not to engage in these transactions.

5

do, they are subject to punitive taxes and civil --

Certainly in the context of a prohibited

QUESTION:

6

If they

Well, it doesn't say that exactly,

7

does it?

It says a fiduciary shall not cause the plan to

8

engage in a transaction if he knows --

9

MR. LONG:

Yes.

10

QUESTION:

-- and so forth.

11

MR. LONG:

That is correct, Your Honor, but the

12

Court has always refused, in construing ERISA and other

13

statutes as well, to look simply to any single phrase, and

14

when you look not only to 406 but to other provisions such

15

as 3003, that's a provision of ERISA that says -- it

16

refers expressly to a part -- a violation of section 406

17

by a party in interest, so there's an express statement in

18

the text of the statute that a party in interest can

19

violate section 406.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. --

21

QUESTION:

It provides penalties by the

22

23

Secretary of Labor, doesn't it?
MR. LONG:

Well, section 3003 simply is a

24

reporting provision coordinating between the Labor and

25

Treasury Departments.

It says whenever the Secretary of
10

(800) FOR DEPO

1

Labor has information that a party in interest is

2

violating section 406, it shall report the information to

3

the Secretary of the Treasury.

4

But Mr. Chief Justice, there are also section

5

502(i) and section 4975, which just as you say, impose on

6

parties in interest these heavy taxes or civil penalties,

7

which are really designed not only to keep the party in

8

interest from entering into the transaction but, if it

9

does, it's supposed to give the money back to the plan.

10

There's an incentive to correct the transaction.

11

That's a defined term that means, give the money back, so

12

certainly in the narrow context of a prohibited

3

transaction allowing a participant or a beneficiary or a

4

fiduciary to sue for precisely that, that is, to get back

5

the plan's --

6

QUESTION:

But Mr. Long, why does that follow,

7

because in other schemes -- take title VII, for example,

8

of the Fair Labor Standards Act.

9

create both a private right of action and an executive

When Congress means to

20

enforcement scheme it provides specifically for a private

21

right of action, not in the air, but against the employer

22

in the case of title VII and in the case of the Fair Labor

23

Standards Act.

24

So the normal pattern, when Congress wants to

25

create a private right of action against the person who

1

could be subject to executive action, Congress makes that

2

clear.

3

MR. LONG:

Well, and our submission is that

4

Congress did make it clear here in these carefully crafted

5

provisions of section 502.
QUESTION:

6

Well, the conspicuous absence is,

7

here it says, executive, you can go after the party in

8

interest.

9

MR. LONG:

That's correct.

10

QUESTION:

It doesn't say, private plaintiff,

11

you can go against the party in interest, and that is what

12

these other statutes that have dual enforcement schemes do

13

say.
MR. LONG:

14

Well, but in this statute, I mean, in

15

each case the court's obligation, of course, is to follow

16

the plain language as Congress wrote it, unless there's

17

some strong reason to depart from it, and here the

18

language of 502(a) (3) and 502(a) (5), which is a parallel

19

provision that gives the Secretary of Labor authority to

20

bring an action for appropriate equitable relief for any

21

violation of ERISA, both of those provisions are broadly

22

written.

23

What Congress did here was, it provided some

24

specific -- they're not really remedies, but taxes and

25

civil penalties, and it also provided a general catch-all

1

provision.

2

the fact that Congress has addressed it narrowly does not

3

mean that we shouldn't give the full effect to its broad

4

language as well.

5

The Court addressed this in Varity and said

QUESTION:

Mr. Long, with respect to the catch­

6

all I've been assuming, and tell me whether my

7

assumption's right, that but for ERISA and its preemptive

8

effect, you would be entitled to seek this kind of

9

equitable remedy in a State court under its equity

10

jurisdiction.

11

MR. LONG:

That's correct.

12

QUESTION:

And so the real reason -- I guess one

13

of your reasons for saying you've got to find it in the

14

catch-all here is that it would have been very odd for

15

Congress in effect to take away a remedy for the benefit

16

of the ERISA beneficiaries by preemption without allowing

17

it under the Federal jurisdiction created by the statute.

18

MR. LONG:

Yes, that's absolutely correct, but

19

our argument is not simply that we don't think Congress in

20

any respect could have cut back on any rights that

21

participants or beneficiaries had pre-ERISA, and our

22

argument is again based on the language of the statute,

23

this carefully crafted language in section 502, and when

24

you see how the pieces dovetail together it's just clear

25

that Congress did not limit this to any person who

2

violates ERISA, or any fiduciary who violates ERISA.
QUESTION:

But if you're right -- what -- the

3

thing -- I'm having trouble with the case, and maybe it's

4

only tangentially relevant, but if you're right, I thought

5

stockbrokers are always selling investments to people, and

6

companies hire stockbrokers and so do plans, and why

7

wouldn't you do this.

8

9

If you ran a plan, you'd buy a lot of
investments and then the ones that went up you'd keep, and

10

then as soon as some went down you'd ask the stockbroker

11

or the investment manager to give you your money back.

12

mean, that would be a very good way of running a fund.

13

You couldn't lose.

14

MR. LONG:

Well --

15

QUESTION:

So there's something I'm missing in

16
17

how this statute works.
MR. LONG:

Well, I think -- a few points.

One

18

is, I mean, certainly there are the excise taxes and the

19

civil penalties which apply to all these prohibited

transactions, so to the --

No, I mean, I think in part you're

quite right, and it shows how serious Congress was about

these prohibited transaction provisions.

6

wanted -- it really was a shift.

prohibited transaction is appropriate equitable relief.
The penalty and tax provisions of ERISA make

3

clear that the preference is for disgorgement of such

4

assets from a party in interest who receives such assets.

5

To enforce those provisions, the Secretary of Labor goes

6

to court under a virtually identical provision, 502(a)(5)

7

to enforce the restitution, and under (a)(6) to enforce

8

the penalties.

Justice Breyer, you had been inquiring about the

there's a general exemption for contracting or making

reasonable arrangements with a party in interest for

things like office space, legal, accounting or other

Why isn't what you've just said the

answer to the problem that I earlier raised, or that we

That is to say, if we decide with you now on

this threshold issue, let's take a different case and get

8

out of the case the problem as to whether you're a party

9

in interest, imagine that a fiduciary or somebody else

10

gives about a billion dollars of the trust's assets to a

11

crooked employer, and the employer runs off with the

12

billion, and what the trustee would like to do is to get

3

the billion dollars back from the employer, who's in

Mexico, or wherever.

Now, you're saying that Congress didn't want

that to happen.

Justice Breyer, let me address you in

There was a compromise, and it's very clear that

1

2

what happened is that the conference committee staff, and

3

it's in the appendix, recommended that the House position

4

be accepted on the issue of liability, that there should

5

not be civil liability of parties in interest.

6

Congress did continue with the excise tax provisions that

7

the Senate had proposed, providing an administrative

8

sanction.

9

However,

And the Government argues here that, well, they

10

need the right to sue under (a)(5) as well, and that

11

private parties have to have the right to sue under (a)(3)

12

as well, but when one thinks about it, the logical

13

consequence here of the Government's position -- because

14

the Government says that the excise tax and civil penalty

15

mechanism is all set up to procure the restitution of the

16

assets to the plan.

17

That's the whole purpose of it.

But if that is the case, then on the

18

Government's theory and on petitioner's theory, if you

19

allow an action under (a)(3) for a private party, or under

20

(a)(5) for the Secretary to compel the restitution

21

directly, as opposed to going through the administrative

22

penalty and excise tax regime that Congress provided for,

23

if you allow for the action directly, you basically render

schemes where Congress has said, like the Fair Labor

MR. HEIN:

Justice Ginsburg, you're correct that

12

they're not inconsistent.

13

the Government's theory of what the purpose of excise tax

14

and the penalty scheme is, i.e. to force restitution to

15

the plan from the party in interest, in effect, if they

16

can sue directly to compel that restitution, then this

17

complex administrative scheme becomes essentially

18

superfluous.

19

QUESTION:

However, here, if one accepts

The difference here is that it is not

20

just the allowance of suits by private individuals, but it

21

is also an allowance of a suit by the Secretary herself

22

for the restitution, which would make the other

23

administrative remedies that the Secretary has available

24

in order to coerce restitution superfluous.

25

MR. HEIN:

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

QUESTION:

1

So it's -- 502(a)(5), you say these

two travel together, and the Secretary no more than the

private individual can bring a suit against anyone other

than the fiduciary.

MR. HEIN:

Is that -That's correct, with the caveat that

you do have the excise tax and the civil penalty scheme,

identical to the private person's right, and that is, it's

11

that -MR. HEIN:

12

That's I think substantially correct.

3

There are minor differences in the language of the two

provisions and, of course,

(a)(5) is not at issue here.

The second part of --

QUESTION:

position.

that's right, the Secretary can't sue the party in

21

I thought you would answer that with a firm,

lie under 50 (a)(3) or (a)(5) is the fiduciary.
MR. HEIN:

That is correct in this situation.

22

There are a number of situations where suits could be

23

brought against a nonfiduciary under (a)(3).

24

if an employer, acting as a nonfiduciary, fired someone to

25

deprive them of benefits, 5 0 of ERISA says that that is

Potentially one could be suing

violated the terms of a plan by refusing to make a

reimbursement to the plan for medical expenses that they

6

were paid and then got reimbursed for in a lawsuit, and

7

that suit may be brought under (a)(3), so --

8

9

QUESTION:

But I want --my question really was,

you see the same limits on (a)(5) as (a)(3)?

That is,

10

whatever a private individual could sue for under (a)(3),

11

the Secretary can, but the Secretary can't sue anyone who

12

would not be amenable to suit by a private party under

13

(a)(5), as distinguished from (a)(6)?

14

MR. HEIN:

Yes.

That is correct, and as I said,

15

Justice Ginsburg, I don't mean to quibble, but there are

16

minor differences in the language of the two and, for

17

example, a suit to enforce the terms of a plan is under

18

(a)(3) but not (a)(5), but for purposes of this case I

19

think Your Honor's analysis is correct, but the two are

substantially comparable.

Our position is that if Salomon, for

QUESTION:

14

But if you are a party in interest,

MR. HEIN:

15

Then I think, Your Honor, there may

be a closer question, because under Pilot Life there's a

17

recognition that Congress -- if Congress set up a remedial

scheme to deal with parties in interest and the remedial

scheme was to rely on administrative enforcement, the

I think that was

Just going back to Justice Breyer's question in

case illustrates many of the pitfalls -- apart from

11

vindicating the congressional intent, many of the pitfalls

12

about private suits.

For example, if one can sue under

3

(a)(3) you have the specter of the fiduciaries who

4

themselves violated the statute, who themselves caused the

knowingly participated in that conduct, being the ones who

themselves are plaintiffs.

1

But you have other doctrines that can

2

take care of it, like the clean hands doctrine, if this

3

was to be an equitable remedy, that would bar some people

4

in the situation you're describing.

5

MR. HEIN:

That may be, but Mr. Chief Justice, I

6

would go back to the fact -- and this is central here,

7

that under 502(a)(3) there has to be -- and this Court

10

Equitable relief.

Relief is a remedy, and as a

QUESTION:

But Mr. Hein, why isn't it -- if this

15

is -- the Secretary of the Treasury can get these stiff

16

penalties against the party in interest specifically, why

17

isn't it clear from that that this transaction is

prohibited as to the party in interest, otherwise how

19

could the -- how could Congress say, Secretary, you can

20

hit them with 100 percent?

proves my point.

In 4975 Congress was explicit that there

would be an excise tax imposed on a disqualified person

who participates in a prohibited transaction.

4

knew how to use the words, participate in a prohibited

QUESTION:

6

Congress

But I'm just trying to clarify the

7

argument that you were making before, which seemed to say

8

that the person, the party in interest is out of it, and

9

that is certainly not the case, because 4975 puts the

10

party in interest right into the position of being a

11

violator of the 406 prohibited transaction.
MR. HEIN:

12

No, Justice Ginsburg, because

1

With regard to certain parties in

provisions, and 4975 in creating the excise tax mechanism,

disqualified person, which is most parties in interest, if

tax.

QUESTION:

And -- but in effect and in purpose,

to get that party in interest to disgorge and return to

of the thing that Congress clearly wanted to prohibit was

assets by buying properties from someone who might be

close to one of the trustees, or something like that, and

a new set of trustees come in, they find out about the

it doesn't matter in terms of getting money back from the

number 2 is if you want rescission.

10

don't mean to get into the merits of it.

All I'm saying

11

is, as you looked -- if you were looking around for whom

12

to sue, you would pick the person who got the gain.

13

MR. HEIN:

But you can --

14

QUESTION:

And then of course you would have to

15

show that it was indeed a prohibited transaction, that you

16

are dealing with a party in interest.

17

MR. HEIN:

But you could also sue the fiduciary.

18

And one other point I would like to stress in

19

this regard is, under the common law a trustee could

20

transact with the service provider, with the trust, and

21

there would not be any liability by the trustee.

22

would not be liability by the service provider.

creation.

MR. HEIN:

That's correct.

That --

3

QUESTION:

Well, is that so, because if you

posit a common law situation in which there -- let's leave

ERISA out of it.

6

case to keep it simple.

7

Let's just assume you had a State law

If you assume that there was, in fact, a State

8

law that prohibited a transaction, a State equity court

9

presumably would have authority to award the kind of

10

relief that in fact is being claimed here, and it would do

11

so, number 1, because there was a State law violation and

12

number 2, the relief that it was awarding would in fact be

13

for the benefit of those intended to be benefited by the

14

State law.

15

So what you're saying is, well, there's --

16

nothing is being displaced here simply because ERISA

17

preempts any State law -- I think you're assuming that

18

ERISA preempts any State law jurisdiction to protect the

19

benefited parties.

MR. HEIN:

Well, Justice Souter, what I was

21

referring to is here the act of a trustee for a trust

that trust was not a breach by the trustee and was not a

breach by the service provider under the common law, and I

QUESTION:

Well, nobody's claiming it is.

I

2

mean, the whole point here is that there was -- the

3

allegation is that there is a breach of the statutory

4

duty, and equity ought to be in a position in effect to

5

limit the harm by ordering restitution or rescission.

6

MR. HEIN:

And Justice Souter, again I would

7

point to this Court's opinion in Mertens, echoed the next

8

year in Central Bank, where this Court indicated that

9

there has to be a substantive duty and liability under

10

ERISA, that there was no provision of ERISA that

11

prohibited participation in the fiduciary breach --

12

QUESTION:

Well, that gets us perhaps back to

3

Justice Ginsburg's question, but it -- I guess the bottom

4

line of your argument is the one that came out in your

5

earlier answer to Justice Breyer.

circumstances in which people on your theory in effect can

walk off with the money and no one can make a direct claim

in equity to keep the money from being dissipated.

what it boils down to.

20

There are certain

That's

You can't do it -- you can't do it under -- in

21

State law, because there's preemption.

22

under ERISA because, in fact, the section does not

23

expressly mention parties in interest versus trustees, and

24

that's the bottom line, right?

You can't do it

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

Thank you, Mr. Hein.

MR. LONG:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

9

There was a question earlier about what

10

exemption Salomon is relying on here.

11

transaction exemption 75-1, and that actually I think

12

answers the question.

13

It's prohibited

It is cited in respondent's brief -- let's

14

see -- yes, it's in the Federal Register, but basically it

15

shows how many of these transactions are clearly subject

16

to an exemption, and it's not going to cause great

17

difficulties.

18

Basically, under this exemption, if a security

19

is sold at the market price you're basically in a safe

20

harbor.

21

and if the security goes down to a low level, as some have

22

been doing recently, that's -- the plan is out of luck.

23

You can show that the plan didn't get a bad deal,

This case is different.

These purchase fee

24

agreements are sort of special things.

difficult to value them, and that's exactly the situation

where Congress wanted the parties in interest to be very

2

careful.

3

And there are problems the other way.

That

4

is -- well, the other thing I'll say is, we've been living

with this system now for years, and it has not caused

great problems.

Seventh Circuit they have been subject to these suits by

the Secretary and by fiduciaries, and by parties,

11

participants and beneficiaries, and it has not caused

12

great problems, so we've been essentially running an

13

experiment with this, and it's been -- it's not been a

14

problem.

15

There are problems the other way.

16

you were to hold 502(a)(3) and 502(a)(5) don't apply

17

according to their terms -- you were exploring the issue

about the billion dollars of assets that walks off.

Another situation that comes up is if assets are paid by

QUESTION:

Would it be reasonable to say, this

7

is equitable relief, so in an instance where the only

8

violation of this reg you cited that makes it a prohibited

9

transaction is a technical matter like failing to keep

10

adequate records --

11

MR. LONG:

Oh, yes.

12

QUESTION:

-- then it is not equitable to get

13
14

back the money?
MR. LONG:

That's very important, and I mean,

15

equity itself is self-limiting.

16

that the party in interest knew or should have known, and

17

if it's -- might very well be unreasonable for parties in

18

interest to inquire whether the fiduciary is keeping all

19

the records, I would think it would be, and in that case

20

this sort of equitable relief would not be available.

21

would not be appropriate.

QUESTION:

It has to be something

How would (a)(3) cover the situation

MR. LONG:

That is a prohibited transaction,

Justice Scalia.

When a service provider provides services

to the plan and is paid excessive compensation, which

means truly excessive, not just something over the market

rate, that is a prohibited transaction, and it could be

subject to equitable restitution.
