ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR H. BRYANT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

11

MR. BRYANT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The petitioners claim that the 1987 Honda Accord

12

in this case was defectively designed under District of

13

Columbia common law because it did not have an airbag in

14

addition to a manual lap belt and shoulder harness.

15
16
17

There are two primary reasons why these common
law claims are not preempted here.
First, Secretary Dole viewed these common law

18

claims as furthering, rather than frustrating, the

19

policies underlying standard 208.

20

Second, even if Secretary Dole had wanted to

21

preempt these common law claims, Congress expressly denied

22

her the power to do so.

23

Now, the reason I say that petitioners' claims

24

were seen by Secretary Dole as furthering the policies

25

under standard 208 is because she herself said that.

In

1

explaining the rationale for adopting the rule, she said

2

that she would rely on, quote, the potential liability for

3

deficient systems, end quote, to make sure that the

4

manufacturers did not all put in the cheaper passive

5

restraint, automatic seatbelts, and instead started

6

putting in more of the more expensive passive restraint

7

airbags.

In addition, under the section entitled Product

That is her statement.

Liability --

QUESTION:

MR. BRYANT:

12

brief at page 10.

Where does -- where does that appear?
That is in -- in our -- the blue

It is --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. BRYANT:

15

QUESTION:

16

purpose for the rule?

17

MR. BRYANT:

And it's -- it's taken from what?
49 Federal Register 29,000.
Which is the statement of basis and

Yes.

It is in the preamble to the

18

rule under the heading -- under the heading Rationale for

19

Adopting the Rule.
QUESTION:

20

21

22

I -- I find the -- the statement you

just quoted a -- a troubling one for the other side, I -I agree.

But I -- I still have difficulty in accepting

23

it as -- as the -- with -- as having the significance for

24

your side that you want because it seems to me that if, in

25

making that statement, she in effect was alluding to the

1

significance or the power of the common law to, in effect,

2

adopt the very rule that she was declining to adopt --

3

i.e., you got to have the airbags -- then she was, in

4

effect, saying I'm relying upon the common law to thwart

5

the very judgment that I am making now.

6

very odd.

7

And that seems

What -- what do you make of that?
MR. BRYANT:

Well, I don't think she saw it that

8

way at -- at all.

9

understanding that Secretary Dole found and all of the

I -- I think we have to start with the

10

manufacturers admitted that the safest, best system was

11

exactly the one that we seek to have installed in this

12

case, an airbag plus a manual lap belt and shoulder

13

harness.

14

She also was facing this Court's decision

15

remanding the last rule that was issued as arbitrary and

16

capricious because it didn't consider requiring airbags in

17

all cars.

18

because she was concerned about cost considerations.

19

was concerned about manufacturer resistance, public

20

acceptability, technological problems, and stifling

21

innovation.

22

Yet, she chose not to order airbags in all cars
She

The reason she wanted tort liability to kick in,

23

however, was because she knew -- and she said it clearly

24

-- that if she simply required passive restraints

25

generally, almost all the manufacturers would put in

1

automatic seatbelts.

2

because of the cost differences and these other factors

3

I've mentioned.

4

QUESTION:

She did not seek tort liability

That seems like a very great weight

5

to put on a -- a single sentence in -- in a preamble,

6

particularly when the Government takes the other position

7

here.

8

9
10

MR. BRYANT:

Well, I don't put the weight solely

on that sentence.
QUESTION:

Well, maybe you shouldn't put any

11

weight on it.

I mean, she does say that competition --

12

potential liability for any deficient systems.

13

she may be saying, you know, I don't know any more about

14

whether there's preemption than the Supreme Court does.

15

We'll have to have a lawsuit.

16

(Laughter.)

17

QUESTION:

There -- there is potential liability

18

for deficient systems.

19

about today, isn't it?

20
21
22

MR. BRYANT:

I mean,

That's exactly what we're arguing

Well, that is what we're arguing

about today.
But I think when the Government's argument is,

23

as it is here, that the sole reason for preemption is a

24

frustration of one of the Secretary's purposes and the

25

Secretary herself refers to this as something she is

1

relying on as creating an incentive towards doing the

2

installation of airbags, I think it is -- it carries great

3

weight.

4

I -QUESTION:

Well, what if we -- what if we get

5

away from that statement and just look at the statutes?

6

Do you want to address where we are then, disregarding

7

that statement of Secretary Dole?

8

9

MR. BRYANT:

Well, disregarding the statement, I

still think, in terms of frustrating the policies

10

underlying standard 208, there is no concern about

11

frustrating the type of policies as Justice Souter was

12

talking about.

13

the enormous cost differences and the other factors I've

14

talked about, not only did the Secretary -- the Secretary,

15

leaving common law liability in place, still thought the

16

manufacturers were not likely to install airbags enough,

17

and that's why she did two other things as further

18

incentives to prompt them to put in airbags.

Because of the factual circumstances of

19

First of all --

20

QUESTION:

Well, I wish you'd get back to my

21

question, though, and stop speculating on what Secretary

22

Dole was thinking and tell us what the statutes mean

23

because I think that will be very strongly part of our

24

necessary decision making in the case, and you can help us

25

by focusing on what these two statutes read together mean

because it's so unusual to have the subject dealt with in

2

two separate sections rather than one.

3

circumstance where the natural reading of standard in

4

section 1392(d) would include State common law standards

5

of care, and yet, several sections down, we find section

6

1397(k).

And in a

And what do we make of that --

7

MR. BRYANT:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. BRYANT:

Well, I think --- and how do we deal with it?
I think what we make of that is, as

10

the United States itself has said, there is no express

11

preemption whatsoever of common law claims by the statute.

12

And the reason I was going to standard 208 is because I

13

agree with the United States' position here.

14

that 1397(k) by its very terms -- and it was the second

15

argument I was pointing to -- denies -- expressly denies

16

Secretary Dole the power to preempt common law claims.

17

says, in plain and unequivocal terms, compliance with any

18

Federal motor vehicle safety standard does not exempt any

19

person from any liability under common law.

20

basic central argument in this case is compliance with

21

this Federal standard does exempt this person from this

22

liability under common law.

MR. BRYANT:

1

Because Congress intended there to

2

be preemption and there would not be the kind of direct

3

conflict, that is, an order requiring the defendant to

4

break Federal law, that this Court has found preempted.

5

QUESTION:

I -- I'm not sure I understand your

6

-- your response.

It seems to me that the problem is that

7

-- that the preemptive -- strike that -- the non-

8

preemptive effect that you attribute to the later

9

statutory provision which preserves the common law is so

10

broad that if we accept your argument, it means that even

11

when the Federal standard says you shall install airbags,

12

a State common law provision can say you shall not install

13

airbags.

Federal law --

And that common law would prevail over the

Well --- if we read that provision the way

you want us to.

MR. BRYANT:

I do believe that that is what it

says.

I also believe it is absolutely unnecessary for

20

this Court to resolve that question here.

necessary, and the reason is because this case is about

2

frustration of purposes, not a direct conflict.

3

QUESTION:

I understand, but to accept your

4

categorical reading of that provision, if I see that that

5

reading is going to lead to this absurd conclusion, I

6

might look around for a different reading.

(Laughter.)

8

MR. BRYANT:

9

things.

I agree, but I would say two

The only absurdity, to use your term, Justice

10

Scalia, that you focused on is the absurdity of ordering

11

someone to do something that Federal law prohibits.

12

there is no question that in this case what we are seeking

13

to hold the defendant liable for is for failing to do

14

something that Federal law both permitted and encouraged,

15

but more importantly, the basic assumption of absurdity is

16

not something that this Court has agreed with in the past.

17

And

In the Cipollone case, under the 1965 act, this

18

Court held plaintiffs under common law could sue for

19

failure to warn even though the warning label was mandated

20

by the Federal Government.

21

implied conflict preemption should not be looked at.

22

it also held that the '69 act did differently and it could

23

understand Congress taking up both approaches.

25

QUESTION:

And this Court held that

That's -- that's not my hypothetical.

1

-- if the Federal Government said you shall not warn and

2

the State held them liable for not warning.

3

MR. BRYANT:

Well, as I understood your

4

hypothetical, it was that the basis of liability was that

5

the defendant should not have done something that Federal

6

law required.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. BRYANT:

9

Required him to do.
Yes, and that was that one of the

theories of liability permitted under the '65 act in

10

Cipollone, that it was a failure to warn because they did

11

what Federal law required them to do, put on these warning

12

labels, instead of something else.

MR. BRYANT:

QUESTION:

MR. BRYANT:

Well -First of all, I don't believe --

7

and I don't think Congress believed -- that the common law

claim would actually require you to do anything other than

9

pay money.

And that is, there is no physical

10

impossibility possible here.

11

between a requirement that you pay money and change your

conduct.

The question is whether Congress

QUESTION:

11

The only thing I can get out of what

12

you're saying is the answer would be let the manufacturer

13

pay for all airbag related accidents, whatever the cause,

whatever the inconsistency, and that will put cost

pressure on the manufacturer to figure out the best

system.

this is, for better or for worse, I did start question

Yes.
Direct conflict I think we both now

Now, the answer to that has to

I thought the answer is yes, preempt.

Then I get to question two, and question two is,

10
11

why would interference in any significant way with the

12

purpose of a regulation be treated differently?

13

the answer to that question is it isn't, I get to question

14

three, which is what is the purpose here.
All right?

15

And if

I expose my thinking on this so that

you can tell me whether I'm -- you already said I'm wrong

And that was the point I was trying to
That is, the Congress did not

And I believe section 1397(k) has to be read fairly

to include that kind of decision.
That's why I was saying I don't think this Court

needs to answer question one.

13

But question two is, and I believe 1397(k) answers

question two and it answers question two by saying, no,

there is no preemption on this kind of an approach.

4

There is -- this Secretary not only made the

5

comment that I started my conversation with, but also made

6

no comment whatsoever anywhere suggesting in any place

7

that she intended to eliminate a common law claim.

8

Indeed, the entire structure of her approach was to not

9

impose airbags on everyone, but rather to create -- to

10

trust it to the market.

11

trusting was the tort liability system to internalize both

12

the costs and the benefits of airbags versus automatic

13

restraints of other types versus anything else that might

14

come along in the future.

15

reasonable regulatory approach, but there is nothing to

suggest whatsoever either that she considered preempting

common law claims or suggested it.

point is concerned, that this combination of -- of

8

that's a fair reading.

I think when the Secretary acts,

9

first of all, in the face of a savings clause like this

10

one, and in the face of the presumption against

11

preemption, and she starts there and then she says that

12

she intends to rely on potential liability for deficient

13

systems to help her achieve her goals of pushing people

14

away from automatic seatbelts and towards airbags, then

15

later on in her rationale she actually quotes and

16

describes -- using her terms, she -- she calls it another

17

potential source of liability for the manufacturers.

18

specifically refers to no airbag claims again.

19

she says nothing whatsoever to suggest that she's

20

eliminating common law claims, but several times says that

21

her concern with leaving it to the market, without any

22

additions from her, is that even with the tort liability,

23

there will not be enough airbags installed and people will

24

put in automatic seatbelts because they're so much

25

cheaper.

she's also phasing in the system over several years

2

because she explains that will prompt more manufacturers

3

to put in airbags.

4

And she gives them an extra credit for putting

in cars with airbags; that is, she says, I would rather

have 500 -- 50,000 cars on the road with airbags than

She hasn't simply thrown up her
She has put together a quite

10

cohesive structure, which is I'm not going to impose this

11

on high, but I am going to create an incentive system to

12

prompt more airbags in cars and I'm going to leave it to

13

the marketplace, including tort liability, to ultimately

14

drive the manufacturers to the right decision, whatever

15

that decision may be.

16

Now, the Federal Government's response to this

17

-- and they concede there is no conflict here.

18

response to this is that this frustrates the Secretary's

19

desires to have a diversity of passive restraints.

don't think that's -- that's wrong for five reasons.

First, that wasn't the Secretary's view.

But I

The

Secretary viewed tort liability as enhancing diversity

And so, this would actually enhance the

Second, it ignores what happened.

The entire

4

theory the Government advances here is that if the

5

manufacturers had had reason to believe they could have

been held liable, then they all would have put in airbags.

7

Well, they did have reason to believe they could have been

held liable.

1984 that they couldn't have been held liable.

In fact, they had no reason to believe in
There was

10

never, at that time, even a court case finding preemption.

11

And the Secretary had said everything she said.

12

what did they do?

13

And yet,

They did not put airbags in most cars.

Third, it assumes that tort liability leads to

14

everybody putting in airbags.

15

as a logical matter because once you preserved all tort

16

liability, the manufacturers are going to look at

17

different cars and say, for these cars the cost and

benefit calculation may be worth it; for these cars the

19

cost and benefit calculation may not be worth it.

going to look at all of the kinds of cases that we read

about in the newspaper of people suing saying, the airbags

QUESTION:

2

since this accident occurred?

3

MR. BRYANT:

How has the regulatory scheme changed

Well, I think the single biggest

4

change was that in 1991 Congress amended the act to

5

require the Secretary to install airbags in all cars as of

6

19 -- all new cars as of 1998.

7

looking at it in sort of the practical effect from here

8

forward, no one can seriously argue the practical effect,

9

even if now all the manufacturers ran out and retrofitted

And so, even if you're

10

their cars with airbags in response to this case, would be

11

anti-safety.
QUESTION:

12

And under the current regime, you

13

would say that there still could be a State common law

14

suit because the airbag had been installed and it damaged

15

someone.

16
17

MR. BRYANT:

I'm sorry.

I didn't -- I did not

understand the question.

18

QUESTION:

I guess under the present regulatory

19

scheme requiring the airbags, you would still argue that a

20

State or the District of Columbia could in its common law

21

find negligence by virtue of the installation of the

22

airbag, by virtue of having it because it damaged

someone --

MR. BRYANT:

1

As

as I said

I'm sorry.

Are

2

you talking about a theory of liability that the airbag

3

shouldn't have been there at all as opposed to defective

4

design of the airbag or something like that?

5

Yes.

As I said, I do believe Congress preserved

6

those.

I also believe this Court does not have to resolve

7

that at all to get there.

8

the real world, it is a total red herring because people

9

will not bring those suits.

And I also believe, in terms of

The courts and the States do

10

not allow those suits.

The practical reality is that's

11

not something anybody needed to fear.
Now, one of the questions is, well, all right,

12

13

even putting that aside, why would Congress do what it did

14

and treat these differently?

15

that Congress was interested in helping to protect

16

potential victims of crashes, and it knew it couldn't

17

prevent all of the -- prevent injury to all of those

18

victims.

19

question is whether you're going to hurt those people or

20

help them.

21

the people who were hurt at the end would actually have

22

been hurt by Congress' actions as well.

approach as to that tension, leaving both in place, needs

to be respected or not.

will mean that there will be a total adoption of seatbelts

MR. WHEELER:

Not necessarily, Your Honor.

What

13

it means -- what would happen is that the manufacturers

would be driven toward investing their efforts in airbags

The

In fact, as of

10

1984, Mercedes Benz had implemented airbags on an optional

11

basis into its largest S class vehicles.

12

Ford Motor Company had already entered into a contract

13

with the United States Government, the Government Services

14

Administration, to install airbags in 5,000 Tempo/Topaz

15

vehicles.

16

Secretary was very well aware of that, but was very

17

concerned, as she expressed in great detail in her

rulemaking, that to push it any faster than she was doing

MR. WHEELER:

Pushing manufacturers to go beyond

that is what the frustration would be.
QUESTION:

What was her purpose -- what was her

4

purpose then in counting the airbag one and a half as

5

against the seatbelt, only one?

6

MR. WHEELER:

Because, Your Honor, again it's a

7

very complex rulemaking, and what she was concerned about

8

was that manufacturers, if she didn't do that, would be

9

trying to put a larger number of passive seatbelts into a

10

larger number of cars as opposed to airbags.

By giving

11

one and a half credits, she was enabling the manufacturers

12

to focus some of their resources on airbag research and

13

development for some cars, while at the same time moving

14

forward to install a variety of other kinds of seatbelt

15

systems into other cars, thereby providing the public with

16

a diversity that she thought was necessary.

-- most importantly perhaps, to obtain the field data to

answer the question which --

MR. WHEELER:

You -- you -- that seems to

Your Honor, the Court -- this

there something odd about calling a common law standard a

MR. WHEELER:

Your Honor, I fully agree, by the

2

way, that there in fact is no tension between section

1392(d) and 1397(k) but for a very different reason.

4

the reason is that 1397(k) begins with two words,

5

compliance with, that defined the narrowness of its scope.

6

It is not an anti-preemption provision.

7

has been no decision by this Court interpreting a

10

The fact is if you look at the 13 cases cited in the

11

petitioners' own brief at footnote 2 of their opening

13

that manufacturers raised whether compliance with a

Federal motor vehicle safety standard that did not address

15

the specific type of defect that plaintiff was asserting

nevertheless constituted an affirmative defense.

17

appellate courts, including many Federal circuit courts,

said the compliance provision prevents that.

the next paragraph, she refers to that manufacturers will

In the preceding

And later on in

The Perry case that I've referred to already in

The Secretary wanted to use product liability law to

certainly misstates the position of the Government.

3

The -- I'd like to speak to the issue of 1397(k)

4

again and -- and the differences between it and typical

5

anti-preemption provisions.
In the typical anti-preemption provisions in

6

7

this very statute, in section 1392(d), there are two antiÂ­

8

preemption provisions, and they use the language that

9

Congress always uses when it intends to limit preemption.

10

They begin with the language that says, nothing in this

11

section shall prevent the States from or nothing in this

12

statute shall prevent the States from.

13

with, compliance with a standard shall not affect -- or

14

not exempt, and that is language that this Court has never

held to effect an anti-preemption result.

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace?
-- all of which were necessary.

Mr. Wallace, would you agree that she

7

was building in some incentive to increase the number of

8

airbags by counting them one and a half?

9

MR. WALLACE:

We -- we describe that, and we

10

think accurately, in context as a reasonable incentive to

11

ensure that airbags would be in the mix of passive

12

restraints since she did not impose a requirement.

13

One of the concerns was that seatbelts often

14

were not buckled in those days, and if airbags were the

15

restraint someone was relying on, they might actually be

16

in greater danger because they'd be riding without their

17

seatbelt buckled, and they'd be vulnerable to other kinds

18

of accidents in which the airbag would not deploy.

19

was one of the advantages of the passive seatbelt

restraint against the airbags.

So, we're

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR H. BRYANT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

And

MR. BRYANT:

Thank you, Your Honor.

10

There might be frustration of purposes here if

11

the Secretary had placed a ceiling on the number of cars

12

with passive restraints generally or airbags specifically,

13

discouraged manufacturers from installing passive

14

restraints generally or airbags specifically, or suggested

15

in any way that tort liability would conflict with her

16

policies and that she intended to create some sort of

17

liability-free zone.

18

None of those are true.

The opposite is true.

She placed no limit on

19

the number of passive restraints.

20

the number of airbags, and she said she wanted to

21

encourage both of them.

22

She placed no limit on

In addition, I think, Justice Breyer, the fact

23

that you noted that this particular car had no passive

24

restraints is critical.

25

passive restraints and an airbag claim conflicting with

The argument about diversity of

that could theoretically apply if we were arguing it

2

should have had an airbag instead of an automatic

3

seatbelt.

4

all, to say they should have put an airbag in it cannot,

5

as a matter of pure, practical logic, in any way affect

6

the diversity of what's put in cars that have automatic -

7

- I'm sorry -- that have passive restraints in them.

8

it doesn't get to the Government's theory at all.

But when the car had no passive restraints at

So,

9

And the response that Mr. Wheeler gave you

10

about, well, she was wearing her seatbelt would make

11

preemption turn on whether a person was wearing a seatbelt

12

or not and actually make them worse off via preemption

3

because they were wearing the seatbelt than they would be

4

if they weren't wearing the seatbelt.

5

we're trying to encourage people to wear seatbelts.

6

And, of course,

I think the basic issue here is whether Congress

7

or Secretary Dole ever intended the manufacturers to be

8

free from liability for failing to install the precise

9

system that the Secretary of Transportation found and the

20

manufacturers admitted was the best and safest system, an

2

airbag plus a manual lap belt and shoulder harness.

22

such result and the Secretary's entire statement and

24

structure of the standard makes clear she intended no such

25

result.

And the notion that somehow a finding that the

2

manufacturers can't be held liable for failing to install

3

what the Secretary herself said was the best system

4

because that would somehow frustrate the Secretary's

5

policies is, we submit, nonsensical on its face.

Thank you very much.
