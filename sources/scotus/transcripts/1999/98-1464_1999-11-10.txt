ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
GENERAL WAXMAN:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We live in an age in which data bases of

11
12

personal information are widely used in the national

13

economy.

14

to national marketing, yet their dissemination threatens

15

personal privacy and sometimes safety.

16

They are bought and sold, and they're critical

The Driver's Privacy Protection Act is one of a

17

series of laws in which Congress has balanced the benefits

18

to commerce of disseminating personal information against

19

the costs of that dissemination to personal security.

20

Beginning with the Privacy Act and the Fair Credit

21

Reporting Act in the early 1970's, up until the Financial

22

Services Act that was enacted just last week, Congress has

23

acted on a sector by sector basis as new uses of personal

24

data and new threats emerge.

25

In this case, Congress heard testimony that,

1

while motor vehicle data bases are of particular value in

2

commerce, their dissemination poses unique risk to

3

personal safety and privacy.

4

Once disseminated, motor vehicle data bases are

5

things in commerce, just as surely as are data bases that

6

belong to financial institutions, cable operators, health

7

care providers, and Congress may therefore regulate a

8

State's discharge of data into the national economy just

9

as it restricts a State discharge of pollutants or other

10

State activities that have a substantial effect on

11

interstate commerce, like operating airports, or issuing

12

municipal bonds.
QUESTION:

13

As I understand it, General Waxman,

14

the Government says it's the Commerce Clause authority

15

here, not anything to do with the Fourteenth Amendment.
GENERAL WAXMAN:

16

That is correct.

We have not

17

sought this Court's review on the Fourteenth Amendment

18

question.

19

QUESTION:

And what are the other examples of

20

Congress' choice to regulate States alone, exclusively

21

under the Commerce Clause power, rather than general

22

legislation?

23

GENERAL WAXMAN:

I think Justice O'Connor, that

24

there are few examples of Congress' attempt to regulate

25

States alone directly, as actors as opposed to the

1

traditional preemption doctrine, because ordinarily what

2

States do in interstate commerce is similar to what other

3

people do, and in this case I think it's very important to

4

recognize that this act, the Driver's Privacy Protection

5

Act, is one of a series of laws that stretches from the

6

1970's until last week, in which of necessity Congress has

7

been dealing with this kind of evolving information age on

8

a sector-by-sector basis.

QUESTION:

Well, that could be the case, but I

still have my question, if there are other examples --

GENERAL WAXMAN:

12

QUESTION:

13

Well --

-- of Congress' choice under the

Commerce Clause power to regulate exclusively the States.

14

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well, I think the best example

15

that I've come up with, and it's in our brief, is, for

16

example, the regulation of the operation of commercial

17

airports.

18

are all operated by State or municipal entities, and yet

19

Congress has the authority and has given the FAA the

20

authority to say --

21

QUESTION:

22

predicate for that statement?

23

private airports that are operated by private parties.

24
25

All commercial airports are -- I believe they

principle that when States act in interstate commerce,

2

when they attempt to regulate an instrumentality or a

3

thing in commerce, or they engage in an activity that

4

substantially affects interstate commerce, Congress has

5

the authority to direct or limit their activities just as

6

it does with respect to anyone else.

7

If one or more States in this -- with the

8

example of this statute decided to contract out their

9

motor vehicle data base function to EDS or some other

10

information services company, it can't make a

11

constitutional difference if one commercial airport

decide -- you know, becomes privately operated, and in

this case, the act --

QUESTION:

Mr. Waxman, this case differs, it

15

seems to me from the airport cases you're talking about

and from the pollution emission example you alluded to

GENERAL WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

Well

It's a purely governmental -- now,

3

maybe this is a Garcia-type concern I'm raising, but I

think that is really what is --

GENERAL WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

7

GENERAL WAXMAN:

8

I --

-- troubling me about the case.
I think it is, but let me

address your concern, Justice Scalia, as best I can.
First of all, the act applies not only to

9
10

States, but also to contractors and people who receive the

11

information from the State.

It acts on the data base.

And the critical point I want to make in

12

13

response to your question is, the -- although I think

14

Congress could take over licensing and motor vehicle

15

permit issuances, Congress has not attempted to interfere

16

in any way with the State's ability to issue licenses,

17

issue motor vehicle registrations, to regulate how those

18

laws are administered or enforced.

economy.
QUESTION:

It -- this act takes

But we answered that argument in the

Printz case.

In the Printz case, you made the same

argument.

This is allowing the States to regulate.

It's much better

licensing, or took over weapons regulations.
But in Printz we said, the point is, we want to

3

make clear who is regulating, is it the Federal

4

Government, or is it the States, and this blurs the line,

5

and this you may not do.

6

GENERAL WAXMAN:

With all respect, Justice

7

Kennedy, I don't -- I think this is Baker and Fry and not

8

Printz, because the Federal legislation is not using State

9

employees or State governments to regulate third parties,

10
11

or to act on its behalf.
In Printz, as this Court explained, as in New

12

York -- and I think this is very -- it's certainly

13

important to our case.

14

cannot -- the Congress can't use its sovereignty to govern

15

private conduct through another sovereign.

16

require States to legislate a solution to a problem that

17

Congress has --

18

QUESTION:

What this Court said is, you

It can't

But here -- here, the act certainly

19

does in effect impose duties on people in the Motor

20

Vehicle Division, where you get a request for information.

21

I mean, it's not a categorical prohibition.

22

the Motor Vehicle Division have to be very familiar with

23

this Federal statute to know whether to issue the thing or

24

whether to deny it.

1

that is certainly true.

It is just as true as it was in

2

Fry with respect to wage controls,

3

to the issuance of bonds,

4

rates and employment laws, and in -- with respect to the

5

pollution laws.

in Baker with respect

in Garcia with respect to wage

6

There are a lot of things that Congress requires

7

the States to do or prohibits them from doing with respect

8

to interstate commerce that requires that they do things.

9

In Baker, this Court said that a State wishing to engage

10

in certain activity must take administrative and sometimes

11

legislative action to comply with Federal standards

12

regulating that activity is a commonplace that presents no

13

constitutional defect.

14

QUESTION:

General Waxman, your -- the

15

connection with commerce that you rely on here is, as you

16

stated at the outset,

17

these lists, once they are released, are an article of

18

commerce, and I suppose that would apply to any

19

information possessed by a State,

20

also -- the Federal Government could also regulate the

21

State's use of its tax information and any other State

22

records,

23

simply the fact that information,

so the Government could

I assume.
GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well, Justice Scalia,

I think

24

first of all there would have to be a showing with respect

25

to the particular type of information that was being

regulated, that it did -- that its dissemination did, in

2

fact, have what this Court has reiterated to be a

3

substantial effect in interstate commerce, a point that's

4

not contested here.

5

And I think -- and I would concede to you that

6

we would have a different case if the Federal Government

7

were trying to do something that the principle articulated

8

in Coyle, and recognized in Garcia and Baker, were to

9

apply.

10

If the Federal Government prohibited the State

11

from issuing to the public information about how it

12

operates, if it interfered with the State's ability to

13

structure its fundamental mechanisms of self-government,

14

but this --

15

QUESTION:

Well, suppose the Federal Government

16

has a change of heart, and it -- which it does.

17

10, 20 years from now, they say the problem is not

18

excessive dissemination of information, the problem is,

19

not enough dissemination of information, and we think all

20

the States should have a Freedom of Information Act, just

21

like the Federal Government.

22

GENERAL WAXMAN:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

I mean,

Well, again --

Could it pass such a law, that any

information in the States' records have to be released?
GENERAL WAXMAN:

I don't -- I think that would

Justice Scalia, as we

4

to have a commission that has 11 and not 12 people on it,

or maybe even that they have to reveal information that it

is essential to the State's function not to reveal.

7

That's head number 1.

You can't tell them they can't move their State

Head number 2 is the principle that the Court

8

That's

articulated in -- well, in Garcia,

in which the protection

10

of the States is largely left to the national legislative

11

process, but there may be procedural defects in which one

12

or a few States are subject to an undue burden or

13

discrimination by reason of some defect in the legislative

14

process.

15

And the third, of course,

is reflected in the

16

anticommandeering principle that this Court has

17

articulated in the legislative context in New York, and in

18

the executive context in Printz, and if any one of

1

they all -- they wouldn't even come into play unless the

2

Court were to find, or Congress were to find that it were

3

acting under one of its enumerated powers.

4

I mean, if it's not acting under an enumerated

5

power, the Tenth Circuit prohibits it by its very terms,

6

because that power is reserved.

7

These three independent constraints that the

8

Court has articulated over the years apply even if there

9

is a finding that the Congress is exercising a legitimate

10

authority in interstate commerce.
In this case, for example, Mr. Chief Justice, if

11
12

this data base were being in fact a data base from a

13

financial institution, or a health care provider, or a

14

video store, all of which Congress has separately

15

regulated, there would be no question that Congress would

16

have authority to regulate or limit the dissemination so

17

long as there was some substantial effect on interstate

18

commerce.

19

So we get to the Tenth Amendment question in

20

this case, because Congress is concededly operating to

21

regulate something, an article in interstate commerce, and

22

the question is whether this law, unlike the law in Printz

23

or in Coyle, violates some independent prohibition of the

24

Tenth Amendment, and Justice Kennedy --

mechanisms of State government that State employees and

2

State officers are accountable to their voters, to their

3

citizens for what they do, and this completely blurs that

line?

5

GENERAL WAXMAN:

6

QUESTION:

Well, I think I would --

In fact, suppose you have a State

7

which is so insensitive that it's selling this information

8

right and left, by the Federal statute you make it

9

unnecessary to the State voters to control that conduct.

10

GENERAL WAXMAN:

11

QUESTION:

Well, Justice Kennedy --

It seems to me -- and just to finish

12

the thought -- here the class affected, i.e., the people

13

that have driver's licenses, is congruent almost precisely

14

with those who vote and control their State officials.

15

Federal intervention is (a) unneeded and (b) intrusive on

16

this governmental mechanism.

Actually, I originally had three, but I've now

20

(Laughter.)

21

GENERAL WAXMAN:

I'd like to make two points

22

with respect to this.

First of all, the information that

23

is being restricted here is not information about how the

24

Government works, or how the Government structures its

25

operations, the type of information that this Court was

1

concerned with in Reporter's Committee, and that would

2

pose a different problem.

3

But the second point I want to make is that the

4

same point -- that is, well, you know,

5

South Carolina want more protection for their privacy,

6

they can vote, you know, they can elect,

7

different Attorney -- they'd never find a better Attorney

8

General --

if the people of

GENERAL WAXMAN:

-- but they could elect a

11

different Attorney General, or they can move.

12

move to North Carolina, or some State that has a

13

protection that's even stronger than the national

14

legislature.

15

They could

But the same could be said with respect to the

16

child labor laws, the surface mining laws that were at

17

issue in Hodel -- the people of South Carolina are, of

18

course, also citizens of the United States, and they have

19

the right to call upon either Government for the

20

protection of their liberties.

21

point I think that you made about the double protection of

22

liberty in the compound republic.

23

That, after all, was the

And what's particularly significant here is that

24

Congress was asked,

in testimony by the Association of

25

State Motor Vehicle Operators, expressly to enact a law

that, quote, must apply uniformly on a national basis

2

because of the ubiquity of this information and the ease

3

of accessing this information on computer modems from

4

anywhere in the world.

5

The stalker who killed Rebecca Schaefer could

6

just as easily have come from Nevada or Utah as from

7

California, where she lived, and that's -- I'm not

8

suggesting that when the States ask for something, that

9

makes it constitutional.

In New York, this Court made it

10

clear that if all 50 States agree with the Federal

11

Government that it can do something that violates an

12

independent prohibition of the Constitution,

13

up to nothing.

14

it still adds

QUESTION:

What is the sanction, then, in the

appropriations -GENERAL WAXMAN:

5

Well, there is -- I mean, there

6

is no -- the appropriations law, which of course is

7

1-year legislation in any event, doesn't include a

8

sanction, but it incorporates all of the provisions of the

9

Driver's Privacy Protection Act, which itself has

10

11

sanctions.
And presumably also we think, if a State took

12

the money -- and the law does not even apply to the State

13

of South Carolina until after this Court issues, quote, a

14

final decision in Reno v. Condon -- we think that the

Federal Government could, if, contrary to an assumption

16

that we have to make, which is that the States would

comply, it didn't, we could presumably seek injunctive or

18

declaratory relief.

But we did indicate to the Court in our

supplemental brief that this intervening legislation does

21

lend somewhat of an academic tone to this discussion, but

22

it doesn't moot the case, and it doesn't really change any

23

of the substantive issues in the case, because the law

24

doesn't apply to South Carolina, presumably because the

necessary and proper, which must include in it the

prerogative that all legislatures have to tailor their

laws to the problems at hand.

9

And the Tenth -- for purposes of the Tenth

10

Amendment, if a particular State activity affecting

11

commerce is within reach of the national legislature,

12

it also applies to some private parties, then it seems to

me that the power to address that activity by the State

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well, it's even more solicitous

2

of the State motor vehicle operators, because it allows

3

them to disseminate it for any purpose, provided that they

4

have in place a system -- and this is reflected in section

5

(b)(11) of 2721, provided that they have a system that

6

permits people to, quote, opt out of the legislation, so

7

it is certainly true that the State, any State that puts

8

in place a system that allows people to just check off if

9

they want to opt out can otherwise sell this data base as

10
11

they have before.
QUESTION:

General Waxman, you know, you

maybe it's -- maybe it comes -- falls under one or the

were purporting to restrict the State from making

striking in the testimony before Congress was the

testimony about how vulnerable people become when this

GENERAL CONDON:

9

QUESTION:

Correct, but --

May I ask you a question about your

central theory?

As I understand it, your central theory

11

is that unless the statute regulates both private conduct

12

and State conduct, it's invalid under a Tenth Amendment

13

concern.

14

And that's supported by the fact that as far as

15

you can say, and I don't think the -- your opponents have

16

found anything -- historically, it just hasn't been done,

17

and so you say that we must assume that there is this

18

constitutional limitation on the power of Congress to

19

regulate States.

20

Now, does that principle mean, for example, that

21

Congress could not pass a statute the obverse of this,

22

requiring States to send their -- all of the information

23

about criminal conduct, finger prints, missing children,

24

and so forth, to a central bureau in Washington for review

and use and for Federal purposes?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

6

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

7

I'd like to make three points in my 3 minutes, if I may.

8

First of all, with respect to the Usery-Garcia

9

point, Judge Easterbrook, writing the majority opinion in

10

Travis, which is the companion case in the Seventh

11

Circuit, found correctly, we think, and for the reasons we

12

articulate in our reply brief at page 8, footnote 6, that

13

this case, in any event, wouldn't be decided differently

14

even under the regime in Usery.

15

And I commend the Court's attention to Judge

16

Easterbrook's majority opinion and our analysis, which

17

essentially takes off from the Chief Justice's concurrence

18

in South Carolina v. Baker, where the Chief Justice

19

emphasized that the more expansive conception of the Tenth

20

Amendment espoused in Usery recognized that congressional

21

action that, quote, operates to displace the State's

22

freedom to structure integral operations in areas of

23

traditional Government functions runs afoul of the

24

authority granted by Congress.

25

Justice Scalia's hypothetical, where there was a

1

bar on releasing any information that is in a State

2

record, probably would raise very serious concerns under

3

Usery, but a release in commerce on information that is

4

personal and private that is provided by citizens we think

5

doesn't implicate Usery.

6

With respect to the -- Justice Kennedy's point

and Justice Stevens point about the category of one, I --

8

if one looks at the environmental laws, for example, that

9

Congress has regulated sludge and solid waste systems that

10

are operated, if not exclusively, overwhelmingly by

11

municipalities, and Congress -- and it has regulated in a

12

way that is different than it regulates other types of

13

environmental issues, and the fact that Congress

14

distinguishes --

Well, if it doesn't, Mr. Chief

Justice, I'd sure like to take another shot at United

States v. Printz, which involved sheriffs and --

(Laughter.)

GENERAL WAXMAN:

I don't mean to be facetious.

construed its Tenth Amendment jurisdiction to include not

2

only States but subordinate sovereign entities, or

3

subordinate governmental entities.

4

I just want to point out, with respect to South

5

Carolina v. Baker, which is always cited as a statute of

6

general applicability, and perhaps in one sense correctly

7

so, but only in the sense that this is, too, the section

8

that -- the statute that was at issue in Baker,

9

310(b)(1) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act

section

10

applied only to State and local governments.

11

tax exemption to unregistered bonds, a tax exemption that

12

only applied to -- ever only applied to State and local

13

governments.

14

It denied a

The Court pointed out in its opinion that this

15

was part of a general system of law, a general law that

16

did away with -- it tried to address the problem of tax

17

fraud through the use of unregistered bonds.

18

with respect to the Federal Government in a different way,

and the same is true here.
