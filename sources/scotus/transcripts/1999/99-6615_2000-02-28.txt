ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. BLUME

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. BLUME:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:

11

My client, Michael Wayne Williams, was convicted

12

of capital murder and sentenced to death in the

13

Commonwealth of Virginia.

14

Court is confronted with the meaning of the phrase, the

15

applicant failed to develop,

16

Antiterrorism & Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, or

17

AEDPA.

18

This morning,

In Mr. Williams' case,

in section 2254(e)(2)

this

of the

I intend to first discuss why the

19

strict liability interpretation of

20

Attorney General of Virginia is wrong, second, offer a

21

more plausible interpretation of

22

consistent with the statutory language, the decision of

23

this Court from which the language was borrowed, other

24

provisions in AEDPA and the incentive structures

25

underlying AEDPA and, third, demonstrate why my client is

(e)(2)

offered by the

(e)(2) which is

1

entitled to an evidentiary hearing under the appropriate

2

standard.

3

In any case of statutory construction, this

4

Court has repeatedly said that this inquiry should begin

5

with an examination of the language itself, and the

6

relevant part of 2254(e)(2) for our case reads, if the

7

applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a

8

claim in State court proceedings, the court shall not hold

9

an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless the applicant

10

shows that the claim relies on either -- and now I'm

11

paraphrasing -- a new rule of constitutional law, a

12

factual predicate that could not have been previously

13

discovered through the exercise of due diligence,

14

accompanied by a showing of innocence, or a clear and

15

convincing demonstration that no rational fact-finder

16

would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying

17

offense.

18

QUESTION:

As I understand it, Mr. Blume, you

19

agree that your client could not meet the very last of

20

those specifications in the event that the Court found

21

that that was necessary for you to prevail.

22

MR. BLUME:

That's correct, Your Honor.

23

It seems that if Congress were drafting a strict

24

liability statute it would not likely have chosen the

25

language of (e)(2), if the applicant has failed to develop

of the claim, or whether there's an evidentiary -QUESTION:

Yes, but typically if you're the

petitioner in a State collateral review, you're seeking to
develop the facts, are you not?

4

MR. BLUME:

Yes.

I mean, often that is the

5

case.

6

applicant will, but the phrase, if the applicant has

7

failed to develop the facts, seems to indicate, clearly to

8

me to indicate that the applicant must somehow be at

9

fault.

It's just a

1

factual statement.
MR. BLUME:

2

Well, I mean, in some situations it

3

is.

4

failed denotes some type of fault, some expectation left

5

undone, and it seems if you tether failed with the

6

applicant, if the applicant failed to develop, that

7

certainly seems to encompass, I think, some type of fault.

8

9

In many usages, and I think the most common usage,

A strict liability statute is often worded much
differently.

I mean, a strict liability statute you would

10

think most plausibly say, if the facts were not developed,

11

which was a usage which was in play in habeas before this

12

under the old Townsend five.

13

QUESTION:

If you're correct in your

14

interpretation, what function, other than surplusage, does

15

(2)(A)(ii) have, which says that a factual predicate could

16

not have been previously discovered through the exercise

17

of due diligence?

18

MR. BLUME:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

I -- Justice Kennedy, that really -Do we just kind of write that out of

the statute as surplusage?
MR. BLUME:

No, I don't think so at all.

I

22

think if you look at the statutory language itself, if the

23

applicant has failed to develop, that looks at the conduct

24

of counsel, what did counsel do?

25

factual predicate that could not have previously been

1

discovered through the exercise of due diligence, looks at

2

the character of the evidence.

3

In other words, I think the rule and the

4

exception envisions a situation in which the applicant did

5

fail, did leave something left undone, didn't reasonably

6

develop the facts, but nevertheless is able to demonstrate

7

that even if he or she had acted with due diligence they

8

would not have discovered the evidence.

9

QUESTION:

Why do you put the choices between a

10

strict liability matter and the word fail, connoting

11

fault?

12

mean, for example, this provision might not apply at all

13

where there is no State proceeding.

14

rule, we don't have a State proceeding, all right.

15

isn't a matter of them failing anything.

Aren't there a lot of intermediate positions?

I

Suppose a State has a

On the other hand, there are a lot of State

proceedings where -- State situations where the State

gives you the possibility of an evidentiary hearing and

failed to produce it, and the next part, due diligence

defendant, of course he's excused.

25

I mean, that's the due

So the failure part takes out some situations,
like the situation where the State doesn't even have a

1

proceeding, and it talks about the thing, you know, the

2

possibility is there for him to develop it, and then the

3

next part, the due diligence part says, by the way, he has

4

to have been at fault here, otherwise he's excused.

5
6

7

I mean, that's how I read the natural flow of
this.

Now, is that wrong?
MR. BLUME:

Well, I think it is, because -- for

8

several reasons.

One, that would for all practical

9

purpose eliminate hearings in most cases even when the

10

applicant did absolutely nothing wrong, because the due

11

diligence under this language has to be accompanied by a

12

clear and convincing demonstration of innocence.

13

QUESTION:

Well, that itself I thought, and read

14

in other briefs in earlier cases, presents quite a

15

difficult question of interpretation, and that's why I was

16

rather sorry to hear you concede that point, since I think

17

lots of interpretation can go into that particular

18

provision as to just what it means, and that is an issue

19

that I don't think this Court has considered.

20

MR. BLUME:

But I think logically to fail to

21

develop would envision, both in its language and in its

22

usage -- I mean, Keeney v. Tamayas-Reyes is where this

23

came from, I think most logically.

It's hard to say it just did not come out of

1

person fail to develop, and Keeney was clearly talking

2

about situations in which the applicant failed, was

3

negligent, in which the applicant did not take advantage

4

of opportunities to develop the facts in the State court

5

proceedings, and this is the language that Congress chose.

To some --

7

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Blume, I wondered if the

8

language directs us to some kind of an exhaustion

9

requirement, trying to make sure that State -- people

10

convicted in State proceedings try to raise their claims

11

first in State court and get the facts developed.

could possibly, I think, have that meaning.

Virginia courts and develop it there?

Is there no post

no -- but that does raise the question.

4

certainly the AEDPA wants people to, as did this Court's

5

decisions prior to that, to exhaust their claims in state

court, to encourage --

QUESTION:

Yes.

It's one of the harshest newly-

I mean, I think

It's very helpful to have the

8

facts developed in the State courts, and I wondered

9

whether that wasn't what Congress was trying to impose

10
11

here, some kind of exhaustion requirement.
I don't know how that should play out in a

12

circumstance as you allege, that a State won't permit any

13

development, so it would be futile.

14

MR. BLUME:

Well, not only will they not permit,

15

but if you look at the character and the nature of the

16

claims in this case, they are withholding claims, evidence

17

where the petitioner alleges the facts were within the

18

possession and control of the State and were not

19

disclosed, despite a pretrial motion which requested this

type of information.

answer the -- to go back, there were requests for more

10

specific questions which were denied.

question the trial court would allow in this particular

case, but I just think it's a very hypertechnical view of

4

That's a classic situation under Townsend, where

the Federal court will grant a hearing, and I thought

6

possibly in such a circumstance this whole section doesn't

apply, because it is a reason for giving a hearing, but it

has nothing to do with the failure of someone, the

QUESTION:

Why?

Because under the successor

So it means it would be easier to have a second petition

5

Once the court decided to reach the merits,

6

their interest in comity and federalism are significantly

less advanced by a Federal court hearing the facts

diligence requirement and the innocence requirement.

That is indisputable.

portion of (e)(2) requires that he show a probability of

innocence.

4

MR. CURRY:

That's right.

That's -- his whole

5

case is, he's got to get out from under the statute

6

entirely because of what he admitted in the first 15

7

seconds today.

8

and so his tactic throughout this has been to try to break

that link that Congress made, and I don't see how it can

He cannot show the innocence requirement,

10

be disputed that Congress made that link, due diligence

11

and innocence.

Now --

12

QUESTION:

Well -- well, look --

13

QUESTION:

He also has another way of getting

14

out from under it, and that is to say that the word fail

is importing a fault requirement as against, as he

characterizes it, your position, a kind of strict

17

liability requirement.

18

MR. CURRY:

QUESTION:

20
21

Right.
What is -- to what extent are you

advancing a strict liability requirement?
MR. CURRY:

That's his term, and I don't know

what he means by strict liability.

You can't have a hearing unless you show both

requirements.

2

this case before us, but I want to take an extreme case

3

for the sake of argument.

4

Let's assume that we've got a case in which by

5

any standards, including those of State law, there should

6

have been discovery allowed at the State post conviction

7

proceeding, but the State opposed discovery and the trial

8

court didn't order it and, as a result of that, there

9

were, in fact, all sorts of evidentiary materials that

10

never got into the record.

11

did not entitle the individual to any State post

conviction relief, so he now comes into Federal court.

MR. CURRY:

Because of what they said in -In other words, no Federal habeas,

State is at fault for thwarting discovery, unless the

prisoner is innocent?

15

MR. CURRY:

All of the concerns that you're

16

talking about, Justice Souter, are the concerns which this

17

Court, when it was up to this Court in making the policy

judgments, channeled into the cause requirement.

QUESTION:

You're in effect assuming that our

QUESTION:

That is

No, but this is a case in which it

could have been satisfied with the exercise of due

diligence, and due diligence in fact was expended.

12

reason it wasn't is not that it couldn't have been, but

Can you -- let me tell you exactly

12

what's bothering me about the third part, the part about

13

the standard of clear and convincing evidence, et cetera,

14

and that I take it is what's putting the pressure on the

15

word fail, on his side of it.
Suppose a case has some evidence against the

defendant, but much of the evidence consists of his own

18

confession, and suppose it turns out later, through no

fault of his own, much later, too late for a State

innocence.

QUESTION:

Mr. Curry, we're now moving from the

20

argument -- there was a concession that if you get to

22

only whether fault is required in that first part.

On the third objection that was made.

MR. CURRY:

10

Well, this to me is the weakest of

11

all claims.

First of all, it's a 2254(d) claim.

12

a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court,

13

so you never get to 2254(e)(2), unless it gets passed

14

2254(d), and the State court clearly was reasonable in

15

rejecting this claim, because there is no evidence to

support it.

There was no evidence in State court.

State can show that it was my shot that caused the death,

I can't be convicted of capital murder?

QUESTION:

You should always go in with a

MR. BLUME:

11

MR. BLUME:

-- that was a lethal wound, so he's

QUESTION:

Is the legal point of Virginia law

MR. BLUME:

Yes.

Just --

According to what he just read, it

says according to medical evidence presented, any of the

three gunshot wounds -- any -- could have been potentially

20

lethal, and all three definitely contributed to his death,

21

with a lot of citations, so what is the issue?

MR. BLUME:

she said any wound is contributory.
