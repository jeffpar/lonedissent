CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN P. HALBROOK

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. HALBROOK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
From the time of the enactment of the amendment

11

to section 924(c) in 1986, which added various firearm

12

types to the section, it was the common practice in the

13

Federal courts to allege in the indictment and to submit

14

to the jury for determination beyond a reasonable doubt

15

the firearm type.

16

Federal and State law under which firearm type was an

17

element of the offense, of the various offenses.

18

This reflected a long tradition in both

Firearm type

is frequently contested at trial,

19

and is the kind of issue that juries normally resolve.

20

Based on its reading of legislative history, the lower

21

court in this case found for the first time that, in

22

essence, the jury is a lower level gatekeeper in the sense

23

that it finds facts justifying a 5-year period of

24

incarceration, but opening the door to factual findings by

25

the sentencing court according to the preponderance-of3

1

evidence standard that justify a 30-year sentence, as in

2

this case, or, in the case of a second conviction, life

3

imprisonment.

4

The section in question, the first part of the

5

section, sets forth elements for the lower level offense

6

in some 83 words.

7

years you'll find the various elements, you'll find the

8

Federal jurisdictional nexus, and we submit that Congress,

9

in a very concise manner, instead of repeating all of that

10

wording, simply set forth the concise way of speaking that

11

if the firearm is, and then to give a list of firearm

12

types, then the punishment is of another --

13
14

QUESTION:

If you looked at from whoever to 5

Well, what are the basic elements of

the offense, the 5-year thing, Mr. Halbrook?
MR. HALBROOK:

15

The elements of the offense is

16

that a person carried or used a firearm therein and in

17

relation to a Federal crime of violence -- in this case

18

there's also drug-trafficking, and other cases.

19

be something that is prosecutable in a Federal court,

20

and - -

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. HALBROOK:

It has to

The crime of violence?
A crime of violence, yes, Your

23

Honor.

So those are basically the elements, and when

24

Congress amended the law in 1986 to include other firearm

25

types, it simply sets forth the wording that if the

1

firearm is, and in this case in '86 the amendment was a

2

machinegun or a firearm that's equipped with a firearm

3

silencer or firearm muffler, and those were treated as

4

elements of the offense up until basically this case.
That was the practice in the Federal courts.

5
6

There were at least three circuits that adopted the rule

7

that those are offense elements.
QUESTION:

8

9

Well, do you take the position that

if a person is charged with a crime of violence or drug­

10

trafficking and with using or carrying a firearm, that

11

that is an indictable offense, and sets out elements of a

12

crime?

13
14

MR. HALBROOK:

Yes, Your Honor, we do think

that, and I -- this Court first held -QUESTION:

15

Because I would think your position

16

might lead to the conclusion that that doesn't even set

17

out the elements of a complete offense.

18
19

MR. HALBROOK:

Oh, because it doesn't start by

saying it shall be unlawful.
The way this was adopted originally back in the

20
21

1968 Gun Control Act was, it was a floor amendment and

22

section 924(c) had penalties but also elements were put

23

in.

24
25

QUESTION:

But you do agree that that states out

the elements of an offense?

MR. HALBROOK:

1

Yes, Your Honor, we do agree with

2

that.

It says, whoever shall do this, and it doesn't say

3

it's unlawful, but then when you get to the penalty clause

4

it's obviously by inference.

5

in the Jones case about the Federal carjacking law that it

6

characterized the initial part of the statute as

7

describing some pretty obnoxious behavior without saying

8

that it's unlawful, but then you get to the penalty clause

9

and then it's obvious that that's an offense.

I think this Court indicated

And this Court first held in the Simpson case

10
11

back in the post '68 period that 924(c) is an offense and

12

it's not just a sentencing factor for some other crime,

13

because -QUESTION:

14

Mr. Halbrook, are you making both a

15

statutory argument and a constitutional argument with

16

the - -

17

MR. HALBROOK:

Well, we're not arguing the

18

statute's unconstitutional.

19

statute should be interpreted such that the different

20

firearm types are offense elements.

21

QUESTION:

We're arguing that the

But you have an alternative argument

22

that if the statute is interpreted as the Government

23

urges, then it would be unconstitutional?

MR. HALBROOK:

We don't make that argument, and

the reason we don't make that argument -- we do appeal to

1

the doctrine of constitutional doubt, but when the

2

decision was first made that these are sentencing factors,

3

it was the universal practice in the Federal courts that

4

they were elements, and then we had several circuit

5

opinions saying that these are offense elements, and we

6

didn't think, and don't think to this day that it would be

7

a service to this Court in a loose way to say that

8

something's unconstitutional when it can so easily be

9

interpreted in the narrow way to avoid the

10

unconstitutional result or according to the rule of

11

lenity --

12

13
14

QUESTION:

And if we don't agree with you on

that, you're prepared to lose the case.
MR. HALBROOK:

Well, we might not be prepared to

15

lose the case, Your Honor --

16

QUESTION:

Well, but you don't make a

17

constitutional argument.

18

set forth in this statute, these matters were meant to be

19

elements of the offense, if we think that they were meant

20

to be sentencing factors, you're content to lose.

21

MR. HALBROOK:

22

QUESTION:

25

If we disagree with you that, as

That's --

And you will not make the argument

that the statute would be unconstitutional.
MR. HALBROOK:

We haven't made that argument.

It was not in our statement of issues, and the reason we

1

didn't make it, once again, is that so many times it seems

2

that, like defense lawyers very quickly at the drop of a

3

hat say some law's unconstitutional when there's no need

4

to make that argument.

5
6

QUESTION:

But you know there is a case pending

before this Court, Apprendi --

7

MR. HALBROOK:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes, Your Honor.

-- that does make the argument that

anything that enhances a sentence beyond the maximum, that

10

that must be given to the jury.

That argument would be

11

equally available in your case, but you say you're not

12

making it.

QUESTION:

(Laughter.)

15

MR. HALBROOK:

16

the rule of constitutional doubt.

17

case the statute explicitly declares that it's not an

18

element, that the judge makes the determination at

19

sentencing, and it's based on the preponderance-of-

20

evidence standard, and this statute doesn't say that.

21

QUESTION:

He said it three times, I think.

We're making it in the sense of
I mean, in the Apprendi

I find it a strange argument you're

22

making, that you say there's -- it's constitutionally

23

doubtful, and therefore we should interpret it this way,

24

but if we don't interpret it that way, well, you don't

25

have any constitutional argument.

1

MR. HALBROOK:

2

QUESTION:

Well

If you don't have any constitutional

3

argument, I guess it's not constitutionally doubtful.

4

mean, I find it extraordinary that you --

5

MR. HALBROOK:

6

QUESTION:

I

Oh, no -- no, Your Honor --

-- can make the statutory argument

7

you're making without reaching the conclusion that if it's

8

rejected there's at least a constitutional issue that we
ought to consider, but you don't want it consider it,

10

that's okay.

You're right, you've said it three times.

MR. HALBROOK:

11

Well, we appealed to the doctrine

12

of constitutional doubt in the sense of the statutory

13

interpretation.

14

There may be --

QUESTION:

What is your basis for saying there's

15

any constitutional doubt about the validity of the

16

statute?

17

MR. HALBROOK:

Well, because the jury finds

18

facts that result in a 5-year period, and the maximum is

1

increased sixfold, up to 30 years, or even to life

20

imprisonment, and it's not determined by the jury, and

21

it's not in the indictment.

22

Footnote 6 in the Jones case is why we think

23

that the rule of constitutional doubt applies here.

24

fact other than recidivism that is to be determined by the

25

jury and put in the indictment is in accord with the Fifth

1

2

and Sixth Amendment guarantees in that respect.
So it's our position that when you look at the

3

statute it would be very difficult to say that reasonable

4

minds could conclude only that it would be interpreted in

5

the more stringent way, because that was not the way it

6

was ever interpreted up until this case, and the general

7

rule is that when there's two interpretations, and when

8

the one interpretation raises the constitutional doubt,
and is also the more stringent interpretation, then the

10
11

rule of lenity also applies.
So when Congress enacted this, there's nothing

12

in the legislative record, although we think that

13

legislative history is a -- not something that overcomes

14

the doctrine of constitutional doubt or the rule of

15

lenity, but when you actually look at the legislative

16

history, it does not state that these are sentencing

17

factors and not offense elements.

18

references to the fact that these are mandatory sentences.

1

You simply have

The provision as adopted in 1 68 had

20

mandatory -- a mandatory sentence for carrying and use of

21

a firearm, and with the 1 86 amendment you have a

22

mandatory sentence for machineguns and firearms equipped

23

with silencers, and then over the years you have other

24

amendments which put in short-barrel shotguns and rifles,

25

and destructive devices, and there simply was no

1

legislative history -- you'll see two paragraphs of

2

legislative history in the Fifth Circuit opinion, and it

3

in no way makes clear that these are offense elements.

4

The statute is written in a way such that there

5

are 83 words in the first clause which gives the offense

6

elements, and in a very concise way it doesn't repeat all

7

of the Federal jurisdictional nexus.

8

not redundant in other words, and it was set forth in a

9

way that there was never any question in the -- either in

It does not -- it's

10

the legislative history or in the way that this law was

11

administered in the Federal courts up until this case was

12

decided that indicated in any way that the firearm types

13

are not offense elements.

14

We think that by making the jury in essence a

15

lower level gatekeeper which finds facts resulting in a 5-

16

year period of incarceration, and then giving it to the

17

sentencing judge to find by a mere preponderance, that

18

those do implicate the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, the

19

Indictment Clause of the Fifth Amendment as well as the

20

Due Process Clause and the right to jury trial and the

21

right to be informed of the nature of the accusation in

22

the Sixth Amendment, and by interpreting the law to mean

23

that these are offense elements, there is no

24

constitutional doubt.

25

doubt against an interpretation that raises that issue.

That resolves the constitutional

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005

1

If you want to go back in history, this long

2

tradition of both Federal and State law under which these

3

are offense elements, as far as Federal law goes we go

4

back to the National Firearms Act of 1934, and for the

5

first time Congress made it unlawful to possess or to

6

receive unregistered machineguns and the short-barreled

7

shotguns and some other types of firearms, and it was an

8

offense element then.

9

In the 1968 act, there are various offenses

10

under title I of the act related to machineguns, short -

11

barreled shotguns and other -- and destructive devices,

12

and those are invariably elements of the offense, and so

13

if we were to take respondent's position we would assume

14

that Congress simply did not make these elements without

15

any indication that these were nonelements and without any

16

structural provision.

17

in a way that these are not elements.

18

In other words, it was not written

In the carjacking case resolved by this Court in

19

Jones, you'll see the same identical structure in this

20

statute as exists with section 924(c), namely that whoever

21

engages in certain action, in that case takes a car by use

22

of a firearm, using intimidation or force or violence,

23

shall be sentenced to a certain amount and, in the case of

24

this statute, whoever uses or carries a firearm in a crime

25

of violence prosecutable in a Federal court will receive a

1

certain sentence.
And in Jones, as in this case,

2

it says, and if,

3

the and-if clause exists.

4

if there's bodily injury then the sentence is of a

5

different type, and in this case, and if the firearm is a

6

machinegun or destructive device, then there's another

7

sentence.

8

So --

9

QUESTION:

Now,

In other words, with Jones, and

if you're correct,

I guess it

10

would require setting aside the conviction and sentence,

11

and sending it back, or what?

12

MR. HALBROOK:

Not the conviction, Your Honor.

13

Only the sentence.

14

5 years imprisonment, and so we're asking that the Court

15

reverse only the portion of the lower court's opinion that

16

relates to the sentence.

17

The mandatory penalty in this case is

QUESTION:

Is there any data that tells us how

18

many defendants currently serving in prison as a result of

19

an offense under this section would be affected by going

20

along with your view?

21

22

MR. HALBROOK:

think the number is not very high yet, and in fact --

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. HALBROOK:

25

There's no statistics, but I

Why is that?
Well, because the statute was

uniformly administered from 1986 when it was amended with
13

1

these other provisions, up until the Branch decision in

2

this case, and during that time it was invariable that the

3

type of firearm was alleged in the indictment, so none of

4

those cases would reopen.

5

It would not be like the Bailey situation, where

6

the term use was subjected to an overbroad interpretation

7

by many of the appellate courts.
QUESTION:

8

9

What would happen here,

Mr. Halbrook -- if we rule for you, you say the conviction

10

wouldn't have to be set aside, but suppose the Government

11

wants to show again that this was one of the kind of

12

firearms that would justify a sentence greater than

13

5 years, does the Government have to prove just that?

14

would have to prove it to a jury, I suppose.

15

MR. HALBROOK:

It

It would, Your Honor, yes, so we

16

don't see that the Government would have any opportunity

17

to do that, but -- that would be double jeopardy.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. HALBROOK:

It would be double jeopardy?
To -- well, these petitioners

20

were indicted for and convicted of use of a firearm, a 5-

21

year offense, and since the machinegun, or whatever the

22

other types, were not in the indictment or found by the

23

jury, they could not be tried again on these charges.

24

The --

1

were not adequately set forth in the indictment, why

2

wouldn't the Government be entitled to a new trial?

3

conviction is set aside, and there's a second trial.

4

That's not double jeopardy.

5

MR. HALBROOK:

The

Well, I think they've had their

6

bite at the apple, Justice Kennedy.

7

a person is tried for a certain crime arising out of

8

certain facts, and the jury makes a determination, and the

9

Government's not satisfied with that, they're not entitled

In other words, once

to go back and re-indict the crime again.
QUESTION:

You mean that if they don't, in a

12

murder case, indict for deliberation and premeditation and

13

he's found guilty of first degree they can't retry him for

14

first degree?

15

MR. HALBROOK:

That's correct, Your Honor.

You

16

couldn't -- let's say you convicted someone of

manslaughter, you couldn't go back and charge him again

I see your point is, is that they

MR. HALBROOK:

7

Yes, Your Honor, and yours --

8

your hypothetical is, you've got the higher offense being

9

alleged in the indictment without a certain element of it.
QUESTION:

10

You're saying that if we find it's an

11

element, the crime charge is a product of the elements

12

charged, and if an element necessary to make it a graver

13

as opposed to a lesser included offense was omitted, then

14

it's only the lesser included offense --

Yes, Your Honor.

of the conviction.

I could answer that maybe and respond more completely to

20

Justice O'Connor's earlier question, because it's only

21

been in the last couple of years or so that the First

the law would have been administered in a way consistent

2

with that opinion, so we don't think there's that many

3

who -- circuits where this will be a problem, and in those

4

circuits we don't think that there would be a large number

5

of cases to reopen, and I have a suspicion -- I cannot

6

verify it, but probably in the Fifth Circuit and these

7

other circuits where now that's the rule, I would be

8

willing to guess that many times the type of firearm is

9

alleged in the indictment.
Traditionally, an indictment, if you use this as

10
11

an example, would say something like, the defendant did

12

use or carry a firearm, to wit a machinegun, and you would

13

have a description of the model number and the serial

14

number and all of that.
QUESTION:

MR. HALBROOK:

That's correct, and it --

Is there some general instruction

MR. HALBROOK:

10

-- those elements.

So it seems to me that you -- if you

11

prevail, and this becomes precedent in other cases, the

12

jury would have to have been specifically instructed in

13

each case that this is an element that they must find.

14

MR. HALBROOK:

15

QUESTION:

That's correct.

The mere fact that it's in the

16

indictment would be insufficient.

17

MR. HALBROOK:

That's correct, and you would

18

have to have the specific definition of the specific

19

firearm that you're talking about, because when you start

20

looking at the definitions under machinegun or destructive

21

device, you'll find many different kinds of definitions,

22

and there has to be some kind of allegation that the

23

firearm type is of the type described in whatever the

24

specific definition is.

25

When you look at the court decisions as to

1

whether elements were properly charged in regard to

2

machineguns, destructive devices and what-not, and also

3

cases involving sufficiency of evidence, the courts look

4

at each and every one of the definitional elements, so

5

that if a short-barreled rifle is charged, part of the

6

definition of rifle is that it has a barrel with a bore

7

that's rifled, and if there's no evidence in the case

8

about it being rifled, that's not enough to sustain a

9

conviction.

10

So by the same token, here, in 924(c) a properly

11

charged indictment would allege a firearm, to wit, for

12

example, destructive device or machinegun, and it would

13

have some kind of definition that they're hanging their

14

hat on as to which definition of destructive device, for

15

example, is being alleged in the indictment, because the

16

definitions run the course from a rifle over 50 caliber to

17

a grenade or a bomb, or I mean, many diverse kinds of

18

things are called destructive devices, so a properly

19

worded indictment would have this information.

20

We think this case implicates the constitutional

21

values that go back to the Winship case, for example, the

22

idea that each and every element of the offense has to be

23

in the indictment, and it has to be proven to the jury

24

beyond a reasonable doubt.

crime and what can it declare a sentencing factor, we

2

think that that is further doctrine that supports our

3

position here in terms of interpreting the statute to

4

avoid constitutional doubt, that the Court has been

5

grappling with that in other decisions, and in the

6

Apprendi case, and it's our position that to avoid these

7

issues, that the statute ought to be interpreted in a way

8

to avoid any constitutional doubt, and that means that it

9

has to be construed narrowly.

10

The case of Mullaney v. Wilbur, which had to do

11

with the shifting of burdens, I think is relevant here in

12

terms of avoiding constitutional doubt, and I'd like to

13

say that in those kinds of cases where the burden would

14

shift, it was still the jury that determined whether the

15

defendant proved by a preponderance -- a lack of malice,

16

for example.

MR. HALBROOK:

1

It was at sentencing, Your Honor.

2

It was right before sentencing.

The Government filed a

3

brief arguing that the judge would be entitled to impose

4

the 30-year sentences.

It was never part of the case.

5

These petitioners were charged with far more

6

serious crimes than 924(c), and the Government put its

7

case into trying to prove those crimes, and the jury

8

acquitted them under count 1, conspiracy to murder Federal

9

officers.

Count 2 was aiding and abetting murder of

10

Federal agents, and they were acquitted of those crimes.

11

They were convicted of aiding and abetting voluntary

12

manslaughter.

13

So it was really never part of the case until it

14

came around to sentencing, and then the Government filed a

15

brief saying that we think that this is a sentencing

16

factor and not an offense element, also raising for the

17

first time the Pinkerton case and trying to apply it to

18

sentencing issues as opposed to the type of Pinkerton

instruction that you give to the jury.

2

gave rise to the indictment on February 28 of 1993, but

3

after the tragic end on April 19, in which there was a

4

fire and everything was destroyed, there were alleged

5

machineguns found on the premises.
But aside from that there was -- I mean, the

6

7

evidence in regard to most of these petitioners is that

8

they did have conventional firearms, and that -- but they

9

did not fire any -- there was evidence that one of the

10

petitioners did, but there's no evidence that ties a

machinegun to any of these petitioners.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES K. ROBINSON

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18

MR. ROBINSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
For purposes of sorting offense elements from

19

sentencing factors in this case, we believe the Court

20

should view section 924(c)(1) as much more like the

21

reentry after deportation statute reviewed in Almendarez-

22

Torres than the carjacking statute reviewed in Jones, and

23

we believe this for three major reasons.

24
25

First, the sentencing-enhancing- factors in
section 924(c) are very different from the carjacking

statute, particularly in their importance compared to the

2

core elements of the offense.

3

Second, the sentence-increasing factor of

4

serious bodily injury in the carjacking statute was found

5

by the Court in Jones to have been traditionally treated

6

as an offense element of aggravated robbery.

7

comparable history or tradition for treating firearm type

8

in connection with a crime of violence.

9

There is no

And third, the legislative history of section

10

924(c) is far more indicative than was the carjacking

11

statute of an attempt by Congress to treat the sentencing-

12

enhancing factor of firearm type --

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Robinson --

14

MR. ROBINSON:

15

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- one of the cases relied on by the

16

majority in Almendarez-Torres was McMillan v.

17

Pennsylvania, which sustains some sentencing factors like

18

this, but it also said in that case that one of the

19

limitations was that the tail couldn't wag the dog.

imprisonment, but you have judicial sentencing factor

22

findings that can go up to 30 years.

when the machinegun clause provision was initially-

2

inserted into the statute in 1986, the original jump was

3

from 5 to 10, admittedly a substantial one, and then it

4

was later that this graduated scheme was put in place.

5

But I think what's important here to keep in

6

mind is that the predicate offenses, the predicate

7

offense, a crime of violence, is one of the elements of

8

this crime, and a jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt

9

that in fact the defendants used a firearm, used or

10

carried a firearm in connection with that predicate

11

offense and it seems to us that, while there is a

12

substantial increase here, that it is an -- it's

13

appropriate under these circumstances that the judge

14

determine the gradation of the firearm type that has been

15

found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.

sentences will be affected by a conclusion by this Court

that the petitioner is correct in his reading?

6

there's not a lot of those at the moment and, of course,

the current vision -- version of 924(c) increases the

qualitative difference between handling a machinegun or a

When you go back to the

way, Justice Breyer.

And that they did so carrying or

using a firearm, and it's clear from the architecture of

the statute that those are the two key elements which

makes up initially a 5-year sentence, and then we're

6

talking about determining the means by which that has been

accomplished, and the means here, according to the way

Congress has set out the statute, is to differentiate the

punishment based upon the dangerousness of the

instrumentality.
QUESTION:

Well, it's vastly different in terms

of results if the firearm is a machinegun, and according

to petitioner's counsel the evidence isn't all that clear

But it didn't go to the jury, and you

2

don't find it strange that what goes to the jury is a

finding that they have to make beyond a reasonable doubt,

4

which accounts for only 5 years of the individual

protection of a jury, and just on the basis of a

preponderance -- it's more likely than not that they had

10

MR. ROBINSON:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. ROBINSON:

Well, I --

That doesn't seem strange to you?
I think it goes again to a

13

question of what's before the Court in this case, and that

14

is the construction of 924 (c) .

Court, but I think in the first instance our obligation is

to look at the language of the section and ask, what did

Congress intend and it seems to us that, looking at the

language and the structure of the statute, Congress

20

intended there to be two essential elements of this

There was no mandate from Main

QUESTION:

And was there a variety of approaches

among U.S. Attorneys?
MR. ROBINSON:

7

Yes, leading to the split that's

been mentioned in the circuits for how this has been

9

handled.

10

QUESTION:

Isn't there any coordinating

11

mechanism in the Justice Department for deciding what --

presumably means the same thing in all the districts of

the United States, and --

MR. ROBINSON:

Oh, we certainly try to figure

out what these mean and provide advice, but having been

20

both a United States Attorney and now at Main Justice,

21

United States Attorneys' Offices have a fair amount of

ability to frame these things, and there was no mandate

QUESTION:

5

we're all obviously struggling with the way to approach

6

these cases, but I -- and thinking of looking at the

7

underlying crime and asking, faced with ambiguous

8

statutory structure and language, is there a tradition, a

9

tradition of using this kind of factor as a sentencing

10

factor in respect to the underlying crime, or is there

11

legislative history, or does it put the defense in some

12

kind of impossible situation, i.e., to have to prove, for

13

14

you see -- you have my point.

15

MR. ROBINSON:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Yes.

Are any of those things in your

favor?
MR. ROBINSON:

I think so.

I mean, it seems to

19

me that, much like the Court identified in McMillan, it

20

seems to me where visible possession of a firearm in

21

connection with a violent crime, a violent felony was

22

considered to be an appropriate sentencing factor, it

23

seems to me the gradation, the dangerousness of the means,

24

the instrumentality, is often considered by the courts.

MR. ROBINSON:

QUESTION:

Well, the --

The underlying crime here is this new

4

statutory invention, called possessing a gun in relation

5

to, or during the crime of violence.
MR. ROBINSON:

6

Well, but remember, Justice

7

Breyer, one of the elements of this crime is proving

8

beyond a reasonable doubt the commission of a violent

9

crime, and all of its elements.

That's part -- if you

10

don't -- if the Government does not prove, in this case

11

conspiracy to murder Federal agents, it as not made out

12

the elements of the crime.
QUESTION:

13
14

On top --

Is that a separate trial, or are all

of these taken up in the same indictment, same trial?
MR. ROBINSON:

15

Taken up in one trial, in which

16

the Government must prove first that the defendants

17

conspired to murder Federal agents, as charged in count 3,

18

and in addition, the other element, requiring that the

19

Government prove that the defendants, in doing so, in

20

relation to that crime of violence carried or used a

21

firearm.

22

Those are the two essential elements, and if

23

that happens, it's our view that the structure, language,

24

and architecture of the statute makes out a completed

MR. ROBINSON:

I would think that often it

oftentimes it can be.

3

and we're certainly not arguing that there should be a

lesser standard than a preponderance standard for the

judge, the same standard that's used in the sentencing

guidelines to make sentencing determinations, very similar

7

in many respects to the kind of sentencing consideration

8

we're talking about here.

QUESTION:

I think the Court has indicated,

But you know, you're putting stress

10

on the fact that the statute says, and if it is a

11

machinegun, shall be sentenced to, and if it is a rifle,

12

shall be sentenced to.

13

because it says that with regard to the basic, what you

14

say is the basic underlying crime as well.

15

says, it is criminal to use, to carry a firearm in the

commission of these offenses.

as in Jones, Your Honor, in Jones, even the Jones majority-

2

looked at the carjacking statute, which admittedly has a

similar structure and said,

these things to sentencing factors, and then the Court I

think,

the carjacking statute and the reentry statute is critical

in deciding how to come out in this case, is taking a look

at the means or instrumentality -- type of firearm here --

and the reason why I think the distinction between

and saying,

in our view it's very different to the kinds

10

of things that were involved in Jones, which included

11

serious bodily injury or death, on the one hand.
And also it seems to us there was a much

12

13

stronger tradition of treating those kinds of things as

necessarily elements of aggravated robbery, which is not

the case -- there's no long tradition of treating means or

2

of firearm, namely the means or instrumentalities of

3

committing the underlying offense, as, in fact, sentencing

4

considerations rather than elements.

5

QUESTION:

Is there a difference between the

6

legislative history in respect to these add-on -- the

7

machinegun from what the legislative history was when they

8

created the basic crime?

That is, it seemed to me that in

both places what they say in effect is, we're going to be
10

sure that people who have these guns when they commit

11

crimes will be in prison for a long time, and if the first

12

creates a separate crime, why doesn't the second, third,

and fourth?

15

Is there a qualitative difference in the

references to this as increasing prison terms, increasing

punishment.

history that there was any intent to create multiple,

separate offenses under these statutes.

There's no indication in the legislative

And I think the other thing that's important is

that, unlike the Jones case, where I think you cannot

easily say that serious bodily injury or death was

same record in which there was strong evidence of the use

of machineguns and destructive devices, making a finding

of the type of sort of firearms being used --

QUESTION:

But you can say the same thing about,

evidence that a jury could have found manslaughter or

could have found second degree murder, or could have found

years and the other gets executed.

MR. ROBINSON:

Well, as a -- the fact of the

14

matter is, though, that in the context -- as the Court

15

said in McMillan, that as the -- the type or means of

instrumentality of the commission of the crime is a

17

traditional sentencing consideration for determining how

18

much punishment should be imposed after the jury has found

guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on the basis of core

elements that are clearly -- stand on their own bottom as

an offense, namely, the predicate crime of violence and

2

QUESTION:

No, but isn't it also --

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Robinson, you recognized in your

4

brief that if Apprendi is interpreted -- if the Court

5

there should hold that the -- increasing the maximum is a

6

matter that can't be determined by the judge but must be

7

determined by the jury and beyond a reasonable doubt, you

8

recognize that that would impact on this case even though

9

Mr. Halbrook clarified three times that he didn't make

10

that constitutional argument, but I was confused by what

11

you said should happen.

12

You said something about, in the event that

13

Apprendi should determine that an increase in the maximum

14

must go -- must be a question to the jury, then what

15

follows in this case?

16

MR. ROBINSON:

Well, I think that if that were

to be the case, then -- and if the Court were to limit the

18

exception, if it should, to recidivism in Almendarez-

19

Torres, it would make -- the Court would have --be

confronted with a situation in which this sentence

enhancement would be constitutionally problematic.

me to be problematic with respect to it.

MR. ROBINSON:

No, I think not.

I certainly

3

agree with Mr. Halbrook that it wouldn't invalidate the

and obviously we think that then the question would be, if

this was an element -- if the Court were to determine this

was an element, read 924(c) as requiring this to be an

8

element, then it seems to me what would have to happen is

9

that there would be a remand for a determination of

It would have a -- an impact on the sentence,

10

whether the failure to charge this element in this case

11

was harmless error.

12

QUESTION:

Well, could the Court make it an

13

element if Congress has, as you said, written a statute in

14

which it is not an element but a sentencing factor?

15

mean, do we have the power, by finding that a sentencing

factor would be unconstitutional, to convert it from a

17

sentencing factor to an element?

18

MR. ROBINSON:

I

I would say in the first instance

my answer would be no, you don't have that power, except

20

you do have the power to interpret a statute to avoid an

unconstitutional result, and if it was clear --

MR. HALBROOK:

If the Court may please, I'd like

16

to return to an earlier question by Justice Breyer about

17

why, if firearm is an offense element, that the other

all of these are sentencing enhancements.

I'd like to direct the Court's attention to the

21

second sentence in the statute which refers to a second or

22

subsequent conviction under this subsection.

sentence calls the first sentence, refers to being

provision, and if you want to talk about legislative

history, when in 1986 Congressman Volkmer introduced this

statute he said that this imposes mandatory sentences for

firearms including machineguns, so you get that term,

mandatory sentencing, used a lot.
In fact, you even have that in '68, when

Congressman Poff first introduced that amendment on the

House floor for the 1968 legislation, so the fact that

it's a mandatory sentence doesn't tell you anything about

sentence constitutes an element versus a mere sentencing
