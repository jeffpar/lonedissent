CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT MASTROCOLA

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MASTROCOLA:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

This case involves the Interstate Agreement on

11

Detainers, or IAD, which establishes a set of procedures

12

for the interjurisdictional transfer of prisoners from --

13

who are facing charges in the other jurisdiction.

It's

14

our position that a defendant cannot be permitted to

15

expressly agree to a trial date which is beyond the time

16

period prescribed by the IAD and then turn around and, on

17

the basis of that very violation of the right, because

18

it's been conducted after the time period, have his

19

charges dismissed.
QUESTION:

20

Now, you say -- you say expressly

21

agree.

22

-- do you say that is the same thing as the defendant

23

agreeing?

24
25

The defendant's counsel expressly agreed.

MR. MASTROCOLA:

Do you

Well, it is proper for the

defense attorney in these circumstances to make those

decisions.

And therefore, yes, a waiver --

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. MASTROCOLA:

4

And ---by defense counsel is

sufficient for the court to rely on.

5

QUESTION:

In this case, respondent was

6

transferred from Ohio to New York to face murder and

7

robbery charges, and following the completion of pretrial

8

proceedings, the parties met in court for the express

9

purpose of setting a trial date.

10

the court.

11

that would be fine.

12

13
14

A date was proposed by

Defense counsel expressly agreed to that, said
So, the date was set.

Now, that date happened to be beyond the 180day period.

Once that --

QUESTION:

It's just a matter of -- as a matter

15

of convenience for everyone, I wonder why the prosecutor

16

didn't point out that it was beyond the 180 days.

17

MR. MASTROCOLA:

18

QUESTION:

I mean, it would certainly have

19

avoided a lot of problems.

20

ought to do that normally?

21
22

MR. MASTROCOLA:

Wouldn't you think prosecutors

They -- they certainly can do

that, and frankly, the courts can do that as well.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. MASTROCOLA:

25

I don't know that either --

Well, it should.
But I think the question here

then is, is that an absolute requirement?

QUESTION:

1

Probably not, but I just wonder about

2

the kind of practice if the lawyer doesn't point it out to

3

the court.
MR. MASTROCOLA:

4

Well, I think, on the other

5

hand, Your Honor, you could also posit that in fact you

6

would assume that all the parties are aware of the rights

7

and aware of the time provisions and they don't need to

8

expressly discuss those provisions at the time.

9

they're setting a trial date, if it happens to be outside

When

10

the period, that's understood.

11

wants to agree to that, that's fine, and if he doesn't, he

12

can say he doesn't want for -- because it's outside the

13

period or for any other reason.

14

And if defense counsel

So, there's no obligation to conduct a full

15

colloquy regarding the Interstate Agreement on Detainers

16

and the particular trial provisions.

17

from any other statutory speedy trial right, for that

18

matter.

19

In this case --

20

QUESTION:

It's no different

You said it's no different from any

21

statutory speedy trial, but as I understand, at least the

22

Federal Speedy Trial Act is different in that you can't

23

waive the time limits apart from the express provisions in

24

-- in the statute for waiver.

25

MR. MASTROCOLA:

The Federal Speedy Trial Act,

1

unlike the IAD, does contain an express waiver provision,

2

and it also has been interpreted, because of its

3

legislative history which specifically indicates that the

4

intent was that a defendant could not waive that, and

5

therefore the Federal courts of appeals have held that

6

that is not waivable by a defendant.

7

You don't have any express language in the IAD

8

regarding waiver.

You have nothing in the legislative

9

history of the IAD indicating that waiver was meant to be

10

precluded.

11

background presumption, that statutory rights are normally

12

waivable.

13
14

And in fact, the IAD was enacted, against this

QUESTION:

So, you -- you started out to say

it's just like the Speedy Trial Act, but it isn't.

15

MR. MASTROCOLA:

Well, I apologize.

Yes, the

16

Federal Speedy Trial Act would be distinguishable on that

17

basis.

18

basis for most typical State speedy trial statutes

19

throughout the Nation.

I'm referring to what my understanding is of the

20

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question about your

21

position?

22

this was a necessary and reasonable continuance within the

23

meaning of Article III(a).

24

relying entirely on waiver.

25

I don't understand you to argue that this --

MR. MASTROCOLA:

You're just -- you're just

That's correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

1

You do not contend that it was a --

2

that you could -- you could prevail by arguing that that

3

-- this was just a necessary and reasonable continuance.

4

MR. MASTROCOLA:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. MASTROCOLA:

No.

Why not?
It's our position that the

7

necessary and reasonable continuance provisions,

8

specifically in the statute -- that also includes a good
cause standard, and it also has to be done in open court.

10

And it's our position --

11

QUESTION:

Well, this was done in open court.

12

MR. MASTROCOLA:

13

QUESTION:

But there was no --

If two lawyers say to the judge, it's

14

inconvenient to go to trial on such and such a day, we'd

15

like a later date, why isn't that good cause for a trial

17

opponent this, but I'm just puzzled that you didn't make

18

this argument.

1

I mean, I know this -- I should be asking your

MR. MASTROCOLA:

Well, I believe because it was

20

in the nature of the colloquy here and there was no

21

discussion about the reasons why that was done, because

22

there was no need for the -- any discussion.

23

date was proposed and the counsel agreed to it, there was

24

no need for a discussion as to why that was or was not

25

appropriate.

Once the

that that was
QUESTION:

2

The mere fact that the judge and both

3

lawyers think the case ought to be put over is not good

4

cause.

That's not a showing --

5

MR. MASTROCOLA:

6

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

The mere fact that the trial judge

7

and counsel on both sides think a later date is -- would

8

be -- would be better -- would justify a continuance, that

9

would not be good cause in your view.
MR. MASTROCOLA:

10

I think if there's some

11

articulation as to what the reason was, other than just

12

indicating, as you typically do in trial practice, when

13

the parties get together and a date is selected.

14

times, unless there is a problem with that date, you don't

15

get any discussion as to why or why -- why it's not good.

16

The parties just agree and -- and it's understood that

17

that's going to work out for everybody and it's

18

acceptable.

19

QUESTION:

That's the point.

20

that -- that's the point.

21

MR. MASTROCOLA:

A lot of

I mean, why isn't

Why isn't that good cause?
It's our position that that

22

provision of the IAD really applies for when the

23

government is seeking a continuance over the defendant's

24

objection.

25

of waivability.

That's why we have the statutory presumption

1

that's fine, but if the government needs a continuance and

2

the defendant wants to object, the court can go ahead and

3

find good cause.

4
5

And I think --

QUESTION:

I thought the term continuance is --

is used when a date has already been set and you want to

6

extend the date.

7

about setting an initial date as being a continuance for

8

good cause.

9

It would seem to me strange to talk

MR. MASTROCOLA:

I think under a very strict

10

interpretation of that term, that's correct.

11

over the years, though, have basically treated it as -QUESTION:

set.

I wouldn't disagree with that,

Your Honor, but I believe the courts --

That's why you didn't argue it.

Because it wouldn't have made much sense to argue

2

MR. MASTROCOLA:

That's correct, Your Honor.

3

The courts use both the good cause continuance provision,

4

as well as a separate provision in the IAD, which says

that you don't count time when the defendant is unable to

over the 180-day period.

That's also been interpreted as allowing

QUESTION:

When you're calculating the

The -- the question you brought here,

11

Mr. Mastrocola, though you might not have realized it from

12

all the questions, is, does the defendant's express

13

agreement to a trial date beyond the 180-day period

14

required by the IAD constitute a waiver of his right to

15

trial within the period?

16

MR. MASTROCOLA:

That's correct, Your Honor.

17

And that's exactly what we're saying because that is a

18

tactical decision, a case management decision in terms of

19

the trial date, which counsel is entitled to make.

20

is no need for any kind of specific on-the-record inquiry

21

of counsel about this.

22

the fact that the counsel is managing the case properly.

23

And therefore, when he agrees to that trial date, he is

24

not entitled then to come in and await the statutory

25

period to run and say, aha, I got you.

dismiss the case.
QUESTION:

The court -And that is because the court can

reasonably interpret the counsel's act -- specific
agreement as a waiver of the IAD.
MR. MASTROCOLA:

That's right because counsel

has done something on behalf of the defense that is
contrary to or inconsistent with relying on those rights
under the IAD.
The court of appeals here made the distinction
that even though the right is waivable and the defense
counsel merely concurred in the trial date -- he didn't
actually ask for the date -- and on the basis of that
distinction, they said there was no waiver.

In other

words, even though the defense had fully agreed to be
treated in a fashion contrary to the IAD, he didn't
actually ask to be treated in such a contrary fashion.
And that was the basis for the finding that there was no
waiver of the IAD, and on that basis, they set aside the
convictions and the sentence.
QUESTION:

Well, and they directed the dismissal

of a murder indictment, did they not?
MR. MASTROCOLA:

That's correct.

This defendant

was convicted of murder and robbery and received up to a
life sentence.

And the court, on that distinction, which

we submit is an improper and obviously a very fine

distinction, found that there was no waiver.
We believe that once -- again, the standard

3

about acting contrary to or inconsistent with your rights

4

under the statute, in this case the IAD, is a workable

5

standard for a court to rely on.

6

determine that under those -- under that standard when a

7

defendant has, in fact, waived his rights.

8
9

And therefore, they can

It's important I think to remember also that the
IAD, like other speedy trial statutes -- and again,

referring to the particular State speedy trial statutes -

11

- it's not intended to be a trap that the defense can

12

spring on the court.

QUESTION:

All he has to do,

I mean, the statute requires him to

request it twice, not just once.
MR. MASTROCOLA:

He has -- well, no, he has to

refrain from doing something to indicate to the court that

7

he's no longer relying on those rights.

8

specifically, instead of forcing a date on counsel, when a

10

that decision and if the date proposed happens to be

11

outside that, at that point there is an obligation for the

12

defendant to speak up.

13

Now, it may be --

14

QUESTION:

15
16

The court of appeals thought the

obligation was on the prosecutor.
It seems very likely that both lawyers

overlooked the point, and then the question is who should

1

where at least at a minimum he's given the opportunity to

2

decide whether he's going to continue to rely on those

3

rights or not, it's fair then, when he indicates that he's

4

not, for the court to reasonably rely on that.

5

Obviously, in a perfect world, it would --

6

everybody would be aware of their rights.

There would be

7

a discussion of their rights probably every time they come

8

into court and that would all be well and good.

question now is when that doesn't happen, is it fair then

what representations came from the respondent's side.

proceedings began is my understanding.

Is there any indication that this

of documents are provided during the course of pretrial

9

discovery.

I don't believe there is, but there is no
Again, my understanding,

And there also is -- and again, counsel

10

certainly was aware that this defendant was being

11

transferred from Ohio to New York and that he was

12

imprisoned in Ohio.

13

certainly can be assumed that counsel was aware of that.

as soon as possible?

MR. MASTROCOLA:

Well, in the normal course of

things, the 180-day period, as with most speedy trial

5

statutes, is not a chronological period.

6

that you're not actually going to have a trial within the

7

180 days because of all these pretrial proceedings.

8

it's not that the case -- they can honestly expect that

9

they're going to get this defendant back within 180 days.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. MASTROCOLA:

It's understood

So,

Well -Now, they may have an interest

12

in getting that prisoner back, but that interest is

13

secondary to this prisoner's interest and what he wants to

14

do facing these charges in the case that he's facing on

the matter that he's been transferred on.

think important to note that whatever interest the sending

MR. MASTROCOLA:

The sending State cannot

The IAD reserves exclusively to the prisoner the absolute

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

10

MS. BLATT:

12

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Respondent waived his speedy trial right under

13

Article III of the IAD when his counsel consented to a

i
15

trial date falling beyond the statutory period.

16

This Court has held that statutory rights are

17

presumptively subject to waiver as a clear indication that

18

the legislature intended to depart from that presumption.

19

There is nothing in the text or history of the Interstate

20

Agreement on Detainers that indicates that either Congress

21

or the adopting States intended to preclude prisoners from

22

waiving their rights under the agreement.

23

the prisoner may invoke the speedy trial right under

24

Article III by requesting disposition of an outstanding

detainer.

But if you say the prisoner is the

MS. BLATT:

Well, I understand that, but here you

have a statute, which you just emphasized the point, that

invoked the right for him.
MS. BLATT:

Could he?

That's correct.

The decision is up

-- the prisoner initiates the transfer by filing the
request, but generally speaking, and certainly something
like a trial date, the decisions by counsel are usually
binding on the client.

And there's no reason to depart

from that here.

MR. SHIFFRIN:

Actually I do not agree with

that.

I believe most speedy -- most speedy trial statutes

are written in a manner similar to the Federal Speedy

Trial Act, which -- which places a burden of compliance on

that there is an explicit provision for waiver and two

10

situations in which you can ask for waiver.

from that that that's it, where opposing counsel started

12

out here with the point that ordinarily it's presumed that

a statutory right is waivable.

In Mezzanatto,

A few -- a few answers are needed

IAD period and the January 9th appearance, no -- and none

The statute doesn't have to say so.
We're not disagreeing at all.

argue that -- that with respect to this statute and these

statutory rights, the line for waiver should be with

continuances at the request of the defense is -- is again

the Court went through a very lengthy analysis of the

22

public interests served by that rule because this Court

23

recognized that, depending on the public interests that

24

are served, there -- there could be limits on -- on the

25

presumption of waivability.

QUESTION:

1

Yes, but in Mezzanatto, the statute

in fact -- I forget whether it was the statute or the

3

legislative history now -- articulated that public

interest.

6

between this case and the Federal speedy trial statute.

And -- and that's what we don't have in -- in

MR. SHIFFRIN:

The statute itself, in the IAD,

8

has a provision, Article IX, saying liberally construe

9

this statute to effectuate its purposes.

The purposes

10

were -- for the IAD were set forth in a number of

11

documents which are -- are incorporated in this Court's

12

decision in Mauro.

that prisoners released to stand trial in -- in another

jurisdiction will be returned to that jurisdiction

QUESTION:

Well, do you think there's no public

19

interest in seeing to it that the defendant is tried of

20

these very serious crimes in New York?

21

MR. SHIFFRIN:

22

QUESTION:

I think there's --

I -- I would think that may be an

23

overriding public interest here where you can find

24

circumstances in which you can say there was a waiver by

25

the defense counsel of the -- the period of time.

I would

think the public interest would fall on the side of

2

allowing New York to conduct those proceedings.

3

MR. SHIFFRIN:

I -- I agree that receiving

4

States have a very strong interest in the speedy

5

disposition of their --of their charges, which is why

6

under this statute, just like the New York speedy trial

7

statutes, there's a strong incentive for prosecutors to

8

comply with speedy trial --

9

QUESTION:

Well, not just a speedy disposition,

10

but a disposition.

12

pretty strong medicine.

13

interest in bringing to trial, in a fair trial and

reasonable time, a person charged with murder, and getting

15

a verdict from the jury either guilty or not guilty.

You know, to say that if you don't get

MR. SHIFFRIN:

Certainly New York has an

I would suggest that strong

17

interest is reflected in the legislative determination in

18

New York, that by dismissing an occasional case, they will

19

achieve that goal in more -- in many more cases of speedy

disposition of cases.

allowing time periods to go unnoticed.

if the line is something else, if New York or any other

But there is no indication the New

9

higher standard.

10
11

The cases it cited are all Federal cases

from other States.
MR. SHIFFRIN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

My

12

point in this regard is if -- if a State wished -- in

13

fact, wanted -- wanted to do so, that would be proper

14

because what's required for uniformity is a floor as to

15

what circumstances are not -- are not permitted.

16

QUESTION:

Well, yes.

If the New York Court of

17

Appeals had said, we think this is a State law question,

18

not a Federal question, and we are therefore going to say

19

that it can't -- it is not waived under these

20

circumstances, we would then have before us the question

21

of whether -- the IAD, being a Federal statute, as we've

22

held in a case -- New York can do that.

23

that question here because New York didn't try to do that.

the opportunity to determine under New York's version of
the IAD, they want to impose a higher obligation upon
themselves -QUESTION:

They had that opportunity before and

didn't choose to take it.
MR. SHIFFRIN:

I -- I would suggest that their

decision -- setting a standard of request reflects a
determination of New York policy that their -- New York's
interests, as well as the interests of the sending State
and Mr. Hill, are served best by having strict time
requirements to be strictly -- strictly applied.
QUESTION:

If we did what you ask, wouldn't we

have to first decide that, yes, New York can do this
compatibly with the Federal legislation?

been argued and briefed.
MR. SHIFFRIN:

That argument has been abandoned.

What's left here is in a situation where the

petitioner has chosen not to rely on the statute, is

seeking -- is seeking to rely on waiver analysis, and it's

6

our position that waiver analysis, with respect to the

7

IAD, exists and occur -- and -- and must exist in a

8

limited fashion in order to ensure that not only the
interests of Mr. Hill and other defendants are met, but

10
11

also the interests of the -- of the two States.
The interests of not only -- I've discussed the

12

sending State, but the interests of the receiving State

13

are not always adequately represented by trial

14

prosecutors.

15

that allow for dismissal, even when there's no objection

by defendants, as a means to ensure that the prosecutors

know that they have a burden of compliance.

apparently neglected its burden and chooses not to rely on

statutory language, but instead is hoping that the -- that

The reason I say that it has no limits, it's not

clear from the petitioner is he's saying is consent the

test.

What constitutes consent?

Is it concurrence?

I would suggest an easy test which assures that

10

the goals of the IAD are met as a test adopted by New York

11

State which is if there was not a defense requested or

initiated continuance, then consider whether the -- the

13

continuance that was granted was a good cause showing

14

continuance which would justify extending the statutory

time periods.

With respect to the questions about what if Ohio

notice in the joint appendix there are a series of forms

See, one of the -- I think the strongest

argument against your position is that if you had a form,

you always get the lawyer to sign the form, you won't have

this argument again about whether there's a waiver.
