ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. Q. WOLFSON

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT RENO

11

MR. WOLFSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965

12

prevents a covered jurisdiction from implementing any new

13

voting practice that has the purpose to discriminate

14

against racial minorities even if that purpose is not

15

retrogressive.

16

to an intent to make matters worse for minorities, and

17

section 5 also places the burden of proof on the covered

18

jurisdiction to show that its new voting practice does not

19

have the purpose to discriminate.

20
21

22

Section 5's purpose prong is not limited

The text and the Court's decisions and the
background of section 5 also support those points.
QUESTION:

Well now, of course,

if you relied on

23

section 2 instead, and the Government brought some

24

challenge or some private citizen,

25

burden of proof would be on the plaintiff,

it would be - - the

I suppose,

to

prove a discriminatory purpose.
MR. WOLFSON:

That's correct, but I think it's

3

important to understand section 5 does not render section

it would for all practical

purposes in a section 5 jurisdiction.

I don't agree with that --

I don't see that you ever resort to

it, probably.

I must disagree with that, Justice

12

O'Connor.

13

applied by the Attorney General and by the preclearance

14

courts this way for 30 years, not limited to a

15

retrogressive purpose, and yet there are many section 2

16

cases brought in the covered jurisdictions.

17

has had several.

18

Rogers v. Lodge was a section 2 case.

19

Gingles was a section 2 case, even though parts of North

20

Carolina are covered.

First of all, after all, section 5 has been

This Court

Mobile v. Bolden was a section 2 case.
Thornburgh v.

There are at least two very important areas

22

where section 2 remains vital.

23

the challenged practice predates the Voting Rights Act,

24

and in many covered jurisdictions in that area there are

25

at-large voting practices and multimember voting practices

is where

and what-have-you that predate 1 65.
Section 2 also remains very important for fact

2

3

patterns like Beer and like Thornburgh v. Gingles, that

4

is, where there was not a retrogressive effect, and the

5

evidence does not indicate anything to show that the

6

jurisdiction had a discriminatory purpose but nonetheless

7

the plan has a very serious, relatively adverse impact on

8

minorities.
There are many reported section 2 cases in

10

covered jurisdictions on the books, and I think it, given

11

the history -- this is not a new interpretation of section

12

5 that we are advancing here.

13

applied, and it's consistent with Arlington Heights.

14

since this Court decided Arlington Heights in 1 76,

15

almost -- just after it decided Beer, the Attorney General

16

has followed the Arlington Heights factors to determine

17

whether an enactment has a retro - - has a discriminatory

18

purpose.

It's the one that has been
Ever

The preclearance court in the District of

20

Columbia, as far as we know, other than this case, has

21

never limited its search to a retrogressive purpose.

22

addition, there are at least two cases in this Court where

23

we submit, where the Court has rendered decisions that are

24

fundamentally irreconcilable with the construction of

25

section 5 that the board advances today.

1

Mr. Wolfson, before you go on with

2

that,

I just wanted to make sure that I understood you

3

correctly to say that section 2 often works when there is

4

a dilutive effect, even though you can't prove any

5

malevolent purpose.

6

MR. WOLFSON:

7

QUESTION:

Correct.

Correct.

And under the section 5

8

interpretation that you're urging, a dilutive effect would

9

not suffice.

10

MR. WOLFSON:

11

QUESTION:

That's --

You would have to have this

12

malevolent purpose, so that would leave a great office for

13

section 2 in dilutive effect cases.

14
15
16

MR. WOLFSON:

That's exactly the point I was

trying to make.
In addition, the Court's precedents really

17

foreclose the proposition that is relied on today.

18

of Pleasant Grove in particular is irreconcilable with the

19

submission that section 5 is limited to a retrogressive

20

purpose, as opposed to a discriminatory purpose more

21

broadly conceived.

that was made by the City of Pleasant Grove in this case

2

was exactly the one that is made today, which is, we know

3

there is no retrogressive effect, so the effect is not bad

4

under section 5.

5

We know that there could not have been a

6

retrogressive effect because the city officials were not

7

aware of any black residents of the town at the time, so

8

how can it possibly be said that there is a discriminatory

9

purpose.

Congress go in this area - -

MR. WOLFSON:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, Congress can --

-- pursuant to the Constitution?
Well, first of all, Mr. Chief

15

Justice, let me say the question about how far the

16

Congress can go beyond the Fourteenth and Fifteenth

17

Amendment really is not implicated in this case, because

18

this case involves a core discriminatory purpose, or at

19

least that is what is in contention.

20

Now, whatever -- however far Congress can go,

21

the question about whether -- the issue about a core

22

discriminatory purpose against racial minorities is

23

fundamentally what the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment

24

is about, so we're not talking about going --

But how far can the Congress go in

directing the Attorney General to supervise those States

2

which are under the Voting Rights Act, under preclearance

3

orders?

4

question, but I was -- it seems to me that if you depart

5

from retrogression as the baseline that the Attorney

6

General must follow, then the Attorney General has vastly

7

greater discretion and vastly greater responsibilities in

8

preclearance procedures, and that may put the

constitutionality of the intervention in State Voting

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, there's certainly no

question that section 5 is an un unusual statute, and it

22

of the interest which is at stake, which is the right to

2

Now,

in South Carolina v. Katzenbach, there was

3

certainly no suggestion that the kind of purpose that was

4

at issue there was limited to a retrogressive purpose, and

5

each time Congress has looked at this act again, and it's

6

reenacted it three times, it has considered these

7

constitutional questions very carefully - - they are

8

serious ones -- and it has said, the interests at stake

9

are serious enough that the preclearance remedy is still

10

necessary.

If it meant what you say it means. If

it meant what you say it means.

you say it means, Congress didn't make that judgment, and

in coming to that decision, I was going to ask you when

16

you said this case involves core purposeful

17

discrimination, well, that may well be true, but in

18

deciding what the statute means, what it means as applied

19

to all situations, we have to take into account the fact

20

that it would apply to noncore purpose discrimination as

MR. WOLFSON:

Understood, and section 5 has been

3

understood to have two independent prongs or protections.

4

The purpose prong addresses those enactments that violate

5

the Constitution itself, and the effect prong does go

6

beyond it, and it inhibits the enforcement of those

7

enactments which, although not animated by a

8

discriminatory purpose, nonetheless present the risk of

eroding those gains that have been made, and that was the

issue before the Court in City of Rome.
In City of Rome, the court said, section 5 has

12

two functions.

13

the other is to prevent against further erosion.

14

these arguments, many of these serious concerns about

15

section 5 have been aired in City of Rome and in

16

Katzenbach, and there's no doubt, as I've said, that

17

section 5 is unusual, but -- but the question about

18

whether it reaches what the Constitution itself prohibits

19

is not a question -- it does not implicate the concerns

20

about whether the outer reaches of section 5 might present

21

some constitutional difficulties.

One is to ameliorate discrimination, and

What Congress intended above all was to enforce

23

what it called the explicit commands of the fifteenth

Amendment, and to make sure that new enactments did not

violate the Constitution, and that's what this is about.

QUESTION:

Well, you know, you're talking now

2

quite properly in response to questions about the

3

substantive extent of section -- but the preclearance

4

requirement and that sort of thing are quite different.

5

mean, those are procedural things that are highly unusual,

6

regardless of the substantive extent.

7

MR. WOLFSON:

I

They are unusual, and they're

8

unusual in a number of ways, one of which is that the

9

burden of proof is placed on the covered jurisdiction, as

10

we've argued, to show that the enactment does not have a

11

discriminatory purpose, but the procedural requirements

12

are not -- they're not -- it's important not to exaggerate

13

their onerousness.

14

of fact in the preclearance court in this case makes a

judgment as to whether -- as to where the risk of

nonpersuasion should lie.

MR. WOLFSON:

Is that right?
Not exactly, which is to say

that - -

10

QUESTION:

Why?

11

MR. WOLFSON:

Which is to say, really what the

12

jurisdiction does is, it says, here is our intent.

13

is what we -- here is why we enacted this particular

14

legislation.

15

last term, that there's a State policy of court

16

consolidation because it's inefficient to have all of

17

these various courts, and so we're doing this for

18

efficiency purposes.

For example,

Here

it could be that as in Lopez

19

And that may, as the preclearance court said in

20

this case, establish its prima facie reason, a legitimate

21

nondiscriminatory reason, and then it's up to the Attorney

22

General to show that there's some evidence that cast doubt

23

on that reasoning, or some evidence that rebuts it.

just discount the covered jurisdiction's proof.

have the burden of proof, it's very --as Justice O'Connor

3

says, it's very, very difficult to prove a negative.

4

Well, unless the covered

5

jurisdiction's reason, proffered reason is totally

6

implausible on its face, Mr. Chief Justice, it would seem

7

to me that if they come forward with what seems to be a

8

facially credible reason, and it's supported by some

9

evidence, then -- and the Attorney General simply stands

10

mute, then perhaps the preclearance court would enter

11

j udgment.

12

i

MR. WOLFSON:

I mean, after all, under the Court's decisions

13

like St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, it's recognized

14

that the other side generally doesn't stand mute in

15

response to what the suggested reason is, and the general

16

rules of summary judgment do apply to preclearance cases,

17

just as they do to other civil litigation, so --

18

QUESTION:

How do we know how this statute has

19

been applied as a practical matter by the Attorney General

in the past?

But the Attorney General has reviewed many, many

MR. WOLFSON:

3,071 times, and a majority of

15

those are purpose cases, and as far as we are able to tell

16

from reviewing, they certainly do not distinguish between

17

discriminatory purpose and retrogressive purpose, and we

18

have cases like City of Pleasant Grove, where one can

19

easily look to it and say well, there's no -- it couldn't

have been a retrogressive purpose, and Busbee v. Smith is

21

another example.

QUESTION:

Mr. Wolfson, I certainly agree with

5

you that the Attorney General's regulations couldn't be

6

clearer, when they say discriminatory purpose or

7

retrogressive effect.

8
9

That is absolutely clear.

Unfortunately, that is not what the statute
says.

The statue says, whether the proposed change does

10

not have the purpose, and will not have the effect of

11

denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race

12

or color, and we have clearly held, and you do not contest

13

that the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote

14

on account of race or color means the effect of being

15

retrogressive.

16

I just find it impossible to know how you can

17

use the English language to say that it will not have this

purpose or effect, or the purpose or effect of burning the

sanctions than an effect.

2

we're not talking about what's possible for the law to do.

3

We're talking about just the plain language.

4

how you can say that it will not have this purpose or

5

effect, and this means one thing for purpose and another

6

for effect.

7

That's certainly true, but

I don't see

It --

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, certainly if one were to

8

look at the language for the first time and see that it

9

prohibits a purpose of denying or abridging the right to

10

vote on account of race, one would not find any language

11

in there that would suggest retrogression.

And the same for effect.
But --

But we've held that, and you don't

contest that holding.

17

MR. WOLFSON:

But the concept of effect was

18

construed by the Court in Beer in light of the particular

19

constitutional considerations similar to the ones that

were discussed earlier, which is - - and concern,

uncertainty about how far Congress intended to go beyond

MR. WOLFSON:

A section 2 suit could be brought,

section 5, and one of the reasons why it enacted it, was

7

to prevent the necessity of the Attorney General going

constitutional framework for assessing discriminatory-

2

intent .

3

If I might begin on the point Justice Scalia

4

asked toward the end of Mr. Wolfson's argument with

5

respect to the plain language of section 5, there's an

6

important countervailing principle of statutory

7

interpretation that would be violated by reading effect in

8

the statute to mean only retrogression and purpose to mean

9

only retrogression, and that is that the purpose prong

10

would become virtually meaningless in practical impact.

11

The only voting changes that would be reached by section 5

12

and could be touched by section 5, no matter how

13

outrageously flagrant the racism that underlie them, would

14

be retrogressive ones.

15

QUESTION:

No, but there are two situations,

16

number 1 where you -- where in fact the jurisdiction has a

17

retrogressive purpose, but the plan it adopts in fact

18

doesn't achieve that.

19

other situation,

20

That may be fluky enough, but the

it seems to me,

is quite substantial.

It would not be necessary for the Attorney

21

General to show a retrogressive effect so long as the

22

Attorney General shows that the purpose -- in fact, rather

23

the jurisdiction has to show that the purpose wasn't

24

retrogressive, and if the jurisdiction cannot show that

25

the purpose was not retrogressive, the game's over.

MS. BRANNAN:

There are some voting changes clearly covered by

section 5 that don't lend themselves to numerical analysis

the Court has said that when a covered

that could be flagrantly discriminatory if a jurisdiction

always let employees off taking leave time to campaign,

but the first black candidate appeared on the scene and

21

suddenly the leave policy was cancelled, and people said

you'll never go out and campaign for that guy.

Is that how the Justice Department

has administered this statute in those hundreds of cases?

4

MR. CARVIN:

The Justice Department has

5

misinterpreted the retrogression standard both in

6

Bossier I and in Beer and in this case as well, and this

7

Court has not given deference to the Justice Department's

8

misinterpretation of the retrogression standard in any of

9

those cases, nor should it in this one as well, and that's

10

because it does raise the very substantial federalism

concerns that were addressed in the prior argument.

13

QUESTION:

That

depends on whether one reads the retrogressive modifier to

No,

I must respectfully disagree,

whether abridge means the same thing in the same sentence.

Abridge modifies both purpose and effect, and abridge

means retrogress, so if you don't have a purpose to

I have to answer that on three

levels, Justice Breyer.
First of all, I agree with you that the real

â–º

MR. CARVIN:

I think that generally the cases in the 2000
redistricting cycle are going to be close cases, with very

10

difficult, if you go too far, do you violate Shaw, so

11

maybe the burden of persuasion will be outcome -

12

determinative in those cases more typically than they

13

would in other kinds of circumstances, because we all

14

recognize that in redistricting you are considering race

15

at some level of abstraction.

16

Whether that's a discriminatory consideration or

17

not is a question that's bedeviled this Court in the

18

gerrymandering cases, and I think would bedevil the lower

19

courts as well.

20

My third point is, if they are close cases, of

21

course, that is the kind of burden that you particularly

22

don't want to put on the covered jurisdiction, because if

23

it's a close case where a trial judge could go one way or

We know that for three reasons.

There's a record indication in this case that the so-

You're -- it seems to me

contrary to the record in this case.
MR. CARVIN:

10

No, no,

I think that the covered

jurisdiction has the burden to disprove retrogression, but

Well, actually, no, the court found

that we're not, that they didn't have a discriminatory

Wasn't the Department of Justice at

that time ignorant that there had a plan, that there had

been the very real possibility of creating at least one,

perhaps more, majority-minority districts?
MR. CARVIN:

8

As I understand it, all of the

9

evidence produced by the black community was communicated

10

to the Justice Department when they precleared the police

11

jury plan in 1991, that they were not in any way misled,

12

or and a mistake made, and I think the best evidence of

that, Your Honor, is nobody's ever sued the 1991 police

have brought a case against the identical police jury

evidence is that they were not, and --

QUESTION:

3

MR. CARVIN:

But that decision was made later.
No, actually, the evidence in the

record is that they knew at the time that these people in

the pairs were not going to run against each other, but

6

indeed the school board was in a worse position than the

police jury, because the school board was prohibited by

law from splitting precincts, whereas -QUESTION:

in doing so.

irrational because it was more costly and created voter

this is a very clear case of discriminatory purpose.

They failed to do something that was admittedly

That will give you an idea of the dilemma that

1

2

covered jurisdictions will face in 2000 when they have to

3

create yet another minority-majority district or the

4

Justice Department will say, you didn't have a compelling

5

Government interest for not doing so, ergo you've got to

6

do it, which will lead to a Shaw lawsuit in the wake of

7

that.
If this is a close case, or if this is a clear

8

9

case of discriminatory purpose, then no covered

10

jurisdiction can get through the Justice Department

11

without committing a Shaw violation.
QUESTION:

12

May I ask you one sort of basic

13

question?

14

the intent, that the meaning of the Department of Justice

15

regulations that distinguish between effect and purpose

16

have been perfectly clear ever since the beginning?

17

Do you agree with Justice Scalia's comment that

MR. CARVIN:

I think it's been their practice.

18

I think -- these are not regulations.

19

guidelines on how they will enforce the law, and --

20

QUESTION:

These are

So we're really deciding whether or

21

not the practice that they've been following for 35 years

22

may continue or not.

23

MR. CARVIN:

And I think you should give that

24

the same deference that was given to it in Bossier I and

25

Presley, which is none, because, as in Bossier I, their

1

practice is contrary to both the Beer retrogression

2

principle and to the statutory language.

3

I would also point out that,

if you adopt the

4

Justice Department position, you will be overturning the

5

learned opinion of the section 5 district court in the

6

District of Columbia, and they were the ones, as this

7

Court made clear in City of Port Arthur, who were given

8

primary responsibility for interpreting a violation of

9

section 5, so if there's a choice between deferring to the

10

section 5 court and the Justice Department,

11

Chevron deference could be given to the section 5 court in

those circumstances.

Redistricting presents the most obvious example.
