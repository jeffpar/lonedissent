ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. McDOWELL:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case concerns when a Federal criminal

11
12

defendant's term of supervised release begins.

The

13

unambiguous text of 18 U.S.C. 3624(e) provides the answer.

14

That section states that a defendant's term of supervised

15

release commences on the day he is released from

16

imprisonment.
It further states that a term of supervised

17
18

release does not run during any period in which the

19

defendant is imprisoned, except for a period of less than

20

30 days.

21

prison, his supervised release does not begin.

22

statute provides --

suppose that just in violation of his rights the prison

2

keeps him in for 3 years after the -- his term of proper

3

conviction had actually expired.

4

obliged to have him serve his term of 3 years' supervised

5

release after those 3 years of wrongful imprisonment had

6

already occurred?

7

MS. McDOWELL:

Do you think we'd be

Yes, Your Honor.

He would have

8

no remedy that's based on his supervised release term that

9

would be automatic.

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. McDOWELL:

Well -He could, however, move under

12

section 3583 for reduction in his term of supervised

13

release.

QUESTION:

Which would be discretionary, with

approval?

16

MS. McDOWELL:

QUESTION:

18

That would be discretionary, yes.

Well, I -- it doesn't seem to me this

ought to be discretionary.

Well, that would still be

QUESTION:

7
8

That seems to contemplate actual release,

What is -- is there a statute that

governs the service of consecutive sentences?
MS. McDOWELL:

9

Yes, there is.

There's a statute

10

that provides that for administrative purposes all

11

sentences will be aggregated.

12

believe.

13

QUESTION:

That's section 3584, I

And all sentences shall be

14

aggregated, what does that mean?

15

MS. McDOWELL:

That has the effect of, if one

16

sentence happens to be vacated defendant will

17

automatically receive credit against a subsequent

18

consecutive sentence.

19

QUESTION:

Suppose the statute didn't read that,

20

and suppose that a person is serving consecutive sentences

21

under a provision either in the statute or in the judicial

22

sentence which says his time for the second conviction

23

shall not begin to run until the service of his time for

24

the first conviction has expired, all right, and then it

25

turns out that the first conviction was improper.

MS. McDOWELL:

20

We

There could conceivably be a due

21

process problem with that.

The courts haven't addressed

22

that particular issue, perhaps because the United States

23

Government has this aggregation provision and States have

24

similar provisions as a result of statute, or court

25

decision.

The due process question has come up typically

1

2

in the context of whether a vacated State sentence has to

3

be credited against a Federal sentence still to be served,

4

or vice versa, and the courts have held there's no due

5

process problem in those circumstances because of the dual

6

sovereignty.

7

QUESTION:

8

MS. McDOWELL:

9

Right.

This could conceivably be a

different situation.
QUESTION:

10

11

Right.

But if it were the same sovereign

there might be a due process problem?

12

MS. McDOWELL:

13

QUESTION:

There could conceivably be.

Why might there not be a due process

14

problem where the second sentence is a sentence to

15

supervised release?

16

MS. McDOWELL:

Because supervised release serves

17

different purposes than a term of imprisonment.

18

supposed to assist the defendant's transition into society

19

and to protect the community.

20

QUESTION:

It's

But you're not -- I mean, it may

21

serve different purposes, but you're not entitled to force

22

someone to undergo it except as punishment for a crime,

23

right?

MS. McDOWELL:

That's true, but in this case, in

the case I conceive we're talking about, the defendant

We wouldn't, of course, insist that a

Oh, but --- serve a term of supervised

release otherwise.
QUESTION:

-- you say there may be a due process

8

problem in forcing him to serve the second conviction.

9

Why wouldn't there be a due process problem in forcing him

10

to serve the supervised release that is a punishment for

11

the second conviction?

12

purposes as well, but it's a punishment.

13

MS. McDOWELL:

14

QUESTION:

It may serve rehabilitative

It may be --

And if there is a due process

15

problem, why shouldn't we strain to interpret this statute

16

in order to avoid the due process problem?

17

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, the only conceivable due

18

process problem would be in the context of two terms of

19

imprisonment.

20

supervised release are so different, and because they are

21

so much less intrusive on a defendant, and because a

22

defendant has an opportunity to get out of the term of

23

supervised release after 1 year, based on his behavior and

24

the interest of justice, that it's not the same situation.

We conceive that since the purposes of

That's correct, Your Honor, but

7

in this case there are still valid convictions to which

8

the term of supervised release was attached.

QUESTION:

Now, here, the supervised release was

ordered in connection with the drug offenses which --

MS. McDOWELL:

QUESTION:

13

That's correct.

-- were not the offenses, the gun-

related offense that was wrongfully imposed?

14

MS. McDOWELL:

That's correct, Your Honor.

15

There were in fact two drug offenses, each of which

16

carried a mandatory term of supervised release of at least

17

3 years.

The

20

Government has in a number of cases involving similar

21

Bailey defendants not opposed a motion for early

22

termination.

23

The court of appeals relied on another section

24

of the same statute, section 3624(a), to hold that this

25

statute is ambiguous.

We disagree.

Section 3624(a) says

1

nothing about supervised release.

Much less does it

2

suggest that a defendant is entitled to a remedy of a

3

credit against his term of supervised release if he ends

4

up spending more time in prison than in retrospect he

5

should have spent.
Indeed, section 3624(a), which states simply

6

7

that the Bureau of Prisons should release -- shall release

8

a prisoner at the expiration of his term of imprisonment,
is not even violated in this circumstance, where the

10

Bureau of Prisons releases the defendant on the very day

11

specified under the sentence imposed by the district

12

court.

13

QUESTION:

What of the argument that you have to

14

give credit for even periods of liberty erroneously

15

granted, that that counts against the sentence if they let

16

you out by mistake, and then you get it all back, the time

17

that you were out counts as part of your sentence, and the

18

anomaly that you don't get credit for time wrongfully

1

served in prison?

20

MS. McDOWELL:

It's questionable, Your Honor,

21

whether the doctrine that you're referring to, the common

22

law doctrine, has any continuing validity.

section 3624(e) supersedes the common law in this regard.

2

Also, this doctrine --

3

QUESTION:

You could argue that that rule is

4

thoroughly in accord with the rule that you're arguing

5

for.

6

Government of incarceration time to which it is entitled,

7

just as the position you're arguing for deprives the

8

defendant of freedom time to which he's entitled, so maybe

9

there's a certain equity in that, I guess.

10

That gives the Government, that deprives the

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, the doctrine has been

applied only in circumstances where the Government is

12

negligent or at greater fault.

13

circumstances, where a defendant has been held under a

14

valid conviction that was correct under Sixth Circuit law

15

until Bailey, it's difficult to find any fault on the part

16

of the Government similar to those in the constructive

parole cases.

comment that this statute has a punitive -- that

At least there is an element of

that ordinary citizens don't have, isn't that right?

Your Honor, that's part of it.

Standard conditions of supervised release, and one of

2

those imposed in this case, is the defendant work

3

regularly at gainful employment.

4

working with the defendant, will put him in touch with

5

potential employers, or with job placement agencies, and

This provides a

Similarly, a condition --

It's a lot like parole, then?

aspect, to parole.

15

That's why this issue didn't come up during the parole

era.

Parole was different in that it was

QUESTION:

It was

If this defendant were to violate his

18

terms of supervised release, what would be the maximum

19

liability that he would have for that violation?

20

MS. McDOWELL:

Conceivably, at least 4 years.

21

The period of -- to which a defendant can be sentenced to

22

imprisonment for a violation of supervised release is set

23

forth in the statute.

24

appeals that terms of imprisonment upon revocation of

25

supervised release can run consecutively, even if the

1

terms of supervised release themselves run concurrently.
So in this case, since there was supervised

2

3

release imposed on the two drug counts, conceivably

4

Mr. Johnson could be subject to 4 years.

5

The Bureau of Prisons has, in fact, construed

6

the crediting statute, 3585, to give a defendant whose

7

supervised release has been revoked credit against his

8

subsequent sentence for any time that he erroneously spent

9

in prison previously.
If there are no further questions, I'll reserve

10
11

the remainder of my time.

Yes, Justice Scalia.

If he's incarcerated incorrectly for

MR. SCHAD:

No, Justice Scalia.
So it seems fair to give him the time

crime A.

That's a somewhat different situation, isn't it?

12

MR. SCHAD:

13

QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice Scalia.
The only way to give him the 5 years

out of his life back is not to have the incarcerated

MR. SCHAD:

Yes, Justice Scalia, and as a matter

of fact there is no other way in this particular case,

1

crime is not a factor in the term of supervised release,

2

but rather the characteristics of the defendant.
MR. SCHAD:

3

Well, Justice Ginsburg, in fact,

4

when imposing a term of supervised release under the

5

guidelines, the court is to look at the severity of the

6

offense.

7

A, B, C, and D type class felonies, and depending upon the

8

severity of the felony, that in turn makes the minimum

9

supervised release term larger.

10

There's classes of felonies that are -- there's

So in fact the sentence itself, or the crime

11

itself does have a bearing on supervised release, and

12

although the respondent would admit that there are some

13

rehabilitative aspects of supervised release, that doesn't

14

mean that the converse is not also true, in that

15

incarceration, although it's punitive in nature, does also

16

have aspects of rehabilitation.

17

In the Bureau of Prisons a defendant can obtain

18

his GED while he's incarcerated, he can obtain a trade, he

19

can work in UNICOR and obtain a trade that way, or he can

20

go to a specialized vocational school, he can take classes

21

such as family parenting and different classes like that,

22

so in fact incarceration is also rehabilitative in and of

23

itself also, so the mere fact that supervised release is

24

not solely punishment does not mean that you cannot give

25

credit one for the other in this case.

1

QUESTION:

But there's certainly a difference in

2

degree at least, isn't there, from the rehabilitative

3

aspects of supervised release as opposed to a prison?

4

MR. SCHAD:

Yes.

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and in

5

fact in this case I am confident that the defendant would

6

have certainly wanted to take the 2-1/2 years and served

7

it on supervised release rather than be wrongfully

8

incarcerated in this case.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Schad, the difficulty I have with

10

your position is this.

If I thought we were writing on a

11

totally clean or unwritten slate here, I would say yes, we

12

ought to try to tinker with the mechanism of supervised

13

release in order to give at least as much credit as can be

14

given for what the Government wrongfully exacted from him.

15

But the slate isn't clean, and when I look at

16

the supervised release scheme in the statute I see that

17

Congress in effect has said, there are two ways you can

18

tinker with it.

19

term down to a year, and you can, in fact, remove or

20

eliminate some of the customary conditions of supervised

21

release during the period in which it runs.

22

You can reduce the supervised release

And that seems to suggest to me that Congress is

23

saying, this is the only kind of tinkering you can do.

24

you find equitable grounds to do these things, you can do

them, but equitable grounds do not give you a basis for

doing anything more than this, so it sounds to me as

though Congress has in effect circumscribed and intended

3

to circumscribe the court's discretion here.

4

Is there an answer to that problem that I have?

5

MR. SCHAD:

Justice Souter, in this particular

6

case, and with these particular facts, I would agree that

7

Congress has spoken in those two particular areas, but in

8

fact Congress presupposes -- when it writes as to those

9

issues it presupposes both a valid conviction and a valid

10

11

term of supervised release.
If you look at 3624(a) and 3624 (e) , both of

12

those presuppose that there is a valid term of conviction

13

and a valid term of supervised release.

14

that Congress never considered, and in fact the Sixth

15

Circuit also agreed with this --

16

QUESTION:

I would submit

But isn't it true that we do have a

17

valid conviction and a valid term of supervised release?

18

He's already served the time on the valid conviction, but

19

we do have a valid conviction.

20

MR. SCHAD:

As to the -- yes, as to the drug

21

offenses he does have a valid conviction, but as to the

22

924 (c) counts, it was not a valid conviction when it was

23

originally imposed by the sentencing court.

MR. SCHAD:

There's an administrative snafu in the prison, and he's

Does the supervised release time begin to run?

Yes, they would, until the

Yes.
So if he's walking around free for a

MR. SCHAD:

The bottom line in this case is that the

That's correct, Your Honor, yes.

22

court -- the United States is reading 3624(e) and reading

that sentence alone, and states that the Congress was

24

clearly unambiguous when it wrote 3420 -- 3624(e).

25

If you look at petitioner's appendix 26a, where

1

it puts the entire 3624 (e)

in,

if you look at the last

2

sentence of -- of 3624(e),

it states that no prisoner

3

shall be released on supervision unless such petitioner --

4

prisoner agrees to adhere to an instalment schedule, not

5

to exceed 2 years except in special circumstances, to pay

6

for any fine imposed for the offense committed by such

7

prisoner.
Under a literal reading of that portion of

3 624 (e) , a defendant would not be released by the Bureau

10

of Prisons until it agreed to this -- until it agreed to

11

this fine schedule, regardless of whether their sentence

of imprisonment had already run.

And that,

MR. SCHAD:

That's correct.
The excess time.
That's correct, and with regards --

4

one item that we haven't looked at is the -- how 18 U.S.C.

5

section 3742 plays out, and how in the case where a

6

defendant is -- where we're not looking at a retroactive

7

application of Bailey, but we're looking at a guideline

8

sentence that was imposed erroneously, if a defendant

9

receives a term of, let's say, 3 years imprisonment and a

10

1-year term of supervised release, then if he -- if that

11

defendant does not get through the appellate process by

12

the time the 3 years imprisonment have occurred, then the

13

case is mooted and the defendant in that case is not

14

entitled to any relief.

15

QUESTION:

Why is that so?

Aren't there

16

collateral consequences to a criminal conviction that

17

would still entitle the defendant to appeal?

18

MR. SCHAD:

Well, the question would be whether

19

or not in that case there is enough to obtain

20

jurisdiction.

21

of the cases that I've cited to talks about, there's two

22

consequences that they say are a result of that.

23

The only collateral consequence that some

One of those is the fact that supervised release

24

can be credited against for the wrong term of

25

imprisonment, and then the second part of that is in the

1

situation where, if a future crime is committed, that the

2

length of this sentence could have impact on the length of

3

the future sentence.
But then you're getting, if the only collateral

4
5

consequence is that particular matter, the length of the

6

sentence affecting the length of a future sentence that

7

may occur somewhere down the road, then you're getting to

8

the point where there might not be a case or controversy

9

sufficient enough for a court of appeals to decide the

10

matter.
So that collateral consequence is the only one

11
12

that's discussed.

13

consequence that we're talking about, I would have a

14

question as to whether or not the court of appeals could

15

even have the case, or whether it would be mooted at that

16

point.

17

If that's the only collateral

In the case where a defendant received a term of

18

under a year, then conceivably that part of it wouldn't

19

even make a difference, because it might not make any

20

difference on his future sentence, so you have a situation

21

where you have a defendant who's obtained a wrongful

22

guidelines sentence and has no way to vindicate that

23

wrongful sentence under 3742, which Congress clearly

24

intended to be allowed.

concerned, wasn't there a change made in response to

2

whatever was the court of appeals decision to say that you

3

can't go back any further than time served?

4

MR. SCHAD:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

That was in

5

response to the United States v. Blake case, which was one

6

of the cases that we cited, and I would submit that that's

7

further evidence that the Sentencing Commission believed

8

that you could provide credit against supervised release,

9

otherwise they wouldn't have made the change in the

10

sentencing guidelines to take care of that particular

11

problem.

12

QUESTION:

Why not?

If they have one -- had

13

precedent going the other way they'd want to remove any

14

doubt on this subject.

15

MR. SCHAD:

That would be the case if, in fact,

16

that particular guideline was made retroactive, which it

17

was not under 1B1.10.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Schad, would the apparent

19

unfairness of this thing -- at least I consider it

20

apparently unfair -- be remedied if we held that it would

21

be an abuse of discretion for a judge not to exercise his

22

option to remit the supervised release time?

MR. SCHAD:

but couldn't we say it would be an abuse in these

Scalia, is that --

11

MR. SCHAD:

You still get 1 year.
-- first you have to serve a year.
You still get 1 year.
Before you can even ask.

So you

12

have that problem, and in this particular defendant's case

13

it would make a difference, because he only had 6 months

14

to go at the time that he was released, if he would have

15

gotten the full credit, so he would have had to serve an

16

additional 6 months before he could --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. SCHAD:

Before he could even ask, right.
And then we still have the problem

19

with the judge's discretion, and even if it's under abuse

20

of discretion standard, by the time a particular defendant

21

could get it up to the court of appeals, then we -- he

22

would more than likely serve a lot of his term anyway.

Well, on the other hand, if the

MS. McDOWELL:

He might well, Your Honor,

12

because under the wording of the statute his term of

supervised release would have commenced upon his first

release from prison.

interpretation and the rationale for being literal seem to

be at odds with each other in that situation.

4

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, the district court would

still have the opportunity, if it appeared necessary to

However, if it was a case where there was a

maximum time of supervised release that the defendant

8

QUESTION:

9

May I ask kind of one -- just ask you

to comment on one thing?

One of the things that's

10

troubling all of us, I think, is the extent to which the

11

supervised release is really the functional equivalent of

12

what -- the time he's already served, or its -- in its

13

punitive aspects, and one of the provisions of the statute

14

that provides what goes into the supervised release is the

15

kind of a catch-all provision that the judge can impose

16

any other condition it considers to be appropriate.

17

Is there -- is that as unlimited, in your view,

18

as it sounds?

release that should be imposed in most cases, and that

2

provides a little more clarity to what's in the statute.

4

QUESTION:

Do the standard conditions include a

consent to warrantless searches and that sort of thing?

5

MS. McDOWELL:

Essentially it's a consent that

the probation officer may visit the defendant's home and

seize whatever he happens to find there.
QUESTION:

Unannounced visits and that sort of

thing.

10

MS. McDOWELL:

That's correct.

11

On the point that a term of imprisonment may

12

serve some of those same rehabilitative purposes as

13

supervised release, that may be true, but supervised

14

release is, indeed, different, because the defendant is

15

living in the community.

17

outpatient drug counseling that he may need, to meet his

child support and other family obligations.

It's one thing, for example, for a defendant to

20

influences and temptations that got him into trouble in

2

the first place.

3

supervised release is different, and why it is necessary

4

as a rehabilitative measure.

5

That's one of the many reasons why

On the point that Mr. Schad raised about the

6

possible mooting of the case, the court of appeals held

7

that the defendant's term of supervised release had

8

terminated upon the issuance of the court of appeals

9

decision.

At that point, he still had approximately 9

10

months to serve on supervised release.

11

appeals opinion, it would be incorrect to assume that the

12

defendant was still continuing in some manner to serve his

13

term of supervised release, albeit without any sort of

14

supervision by the probation office.

15

Given the court of

In terms of holding defendant if he fails to

16

agree to the payment, to a fine schedule, it's our

17

understanding that the Bureau of Prisons indeed will hold

as dealt with that problem much more directly in 18 U.S.C.

That, of course,

is available only in particular

8

circumstances where the defendant is not a threat or a

9

risk of flight, and where he has some likelihood of

prevailing on his appeal.

11

Finally, Justice Scalia had inquired whether an

12

abuse of -- it might be held to be an abuse of discretion

13

if a district court refuses to release a defendant in

14

these circumstances after 1 year.

15

doesn't seem to allow that sort of rule, because it

16

requires the district court to consider not only the

interests of justice but also the conduct of the
