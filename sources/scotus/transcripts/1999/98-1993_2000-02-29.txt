ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. NEIMAND

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

13
14

MR. NEIMAND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue before the Court today is whether an

15

anonymous tip that provides a specific location and a

16

specific description of individuals, and one of the

17

individuals is carrying a gun, provides a reasonable

18

suspicion to make a Terry stop and frisk when only the

19

innocent details, that is, the location and the identity

20

of the individuals, are immediately verified.

21

The Florida supreme court held that under such

22

facts that would never provide reasonable suspicion to

23

allow for the stop.

24

further verification of either future predictive behavior

25

or observation of criminal activity in order for the stop

The Florida supreme court requires

to be effectuated.
QUESTION:

Court,

4

position?

What's the closest case in this

in your view, that you think supports your

5

MR. NEIMAND:

Well, the closest case that we

6

have is Alabama v. White, where on facts similar to this

7

the Court held that it was a close call, but in fact there

8

was a reasonable suspicion.

In that case,

it was a drug

case, the police officers acted upon a little more than we
10

had here.

11

and a small amount of the predictive activity did occur,

12

but that predictive activity was innocent.

13

Some of the predictive activity did not occur,

QUESTION:

Well,

I thought the court there said

14

that standing alone the tip in the Alabama case would not

15

warrant someone of reasonable caution in the belief that a

16

stop was appropriate, but in this case, there is more than

17

the tip, and it went on to articulate other factors.

18

MR. NEIMAND:

Yes, Your Honor, that is the

1

closest case, but also,

20

White, this Court said that that question of the anonymous

21

tip,

22

be decided another day.

23

if you -- when we read Alabama v.

in and of itself, was left open and would be left to

QUESTION:

Well,

it may have said that

24

elsewhere, but it also said what I read to you,

25

standing alone,

it wouldn't be enough,

that

so to accept your

view we would have to move a step beyond Alabama.
MR. NEIMAND:

I believe so, Your Honor, and I

3

believe under the facts and circumstances in this case,

4

where we're dealing with a dangerous weapon, a firearm,

5

the public/officer safety concerns come into effect.

6

9

QUESTION:

Are you arguing, then, for a firearm

exception on the anonymous tip doctrine?
MR. NEIMAND:

No, not at all, Your Honor.

A

firearm exception would basically say any time a tip says

10

a firearm, that's all that's needed.

What the State is

11

arguing here is that when there is a firearm involved,

12

then that is one of the circumstances that we look at

13

under the totality of the circumstances to determine

14

whether the anonymous tip is valid.

16

QUESTION:

Is it even illegal in Florida to

carry a concealed firearm, or can people --

But one does not assume in Florida

QUESTION:

4

MR. NEIMAND:

5

Correct.

And this person was a minor?
Correct,

0 days shy of his

6th

birth date.
QUESTION:

6

The red brief says that you in effect

7

are arguing for a gun exception to the anonymous tip rule,

8

and it seems to me that the red brief is in essence fair

9

when it characterizes your argument that way, because I

10

think what you're telling us that the nature of the tip,

11

i.e., that there is a gun, somehow makes the tip more

12

reliable.

3

MR. NEIMAND:

4

QUESTION:

5

It -- that would depend --

And I -- that doesn't seem to me

logical.

6

MR. NEIMAND:

7

QUESTION:

That would depend --

It seems to me there may be good

8

arguments for your position, but it's not because it makes

the tip somehow more reliable.

here, does it?

Your Honor, that would depend upon

It certainly doesn't.

looking at reliability that someone who had seen what was

2

going on made a phone call to the police, that they

described the individuals, and that information contained

a description, a location, and the fact that one of the

individuals was carrying a firearm.

6

QUESTION:

But that could be true of a tip that

7

the person was carrying drugs.

8

it's much more dangerous to society if this person is not

9

picked up, he could do more harm with a gun than he could

10

with a cache of drugs, isn't it?

MR. NEIMAND:

QUESTION:

reliability.

Your argument here is that

Correct, Your Honor.

And therefore you don't need as much

Isn't that your argument?

14

MR. NEIMAND:

15

QUESTION:

Correct.

Â»
Your argument is not that the tip is

more reliable.

It's that you don't -- we will not insist

upon the same degree of reliability when the argument is

that the guy has a gun.

arsenal in his basement.

2

MR. NEIMAND:

3

QUESTION:

Well,

I --

Because I mean, the degree of public

4

harm is enormous, or, you know,

5

don't do that for search and seizures.

6

there's any more justification for doing it for stop and

7

frisk than there is for doing it for search and seizure.

9

MR. NEIMAND:

Well,

is making bombs -- now, we
I don't see why

in the search and seizure

area the State has cited numerous cases where we do look

10

at officer safety in extending searches and frisks.

11

look at the New York v. Belton, where we have an ability

12

to search the car for weapons after the individual is

13

already in the police car.

14

QUESTION:

We

Well, that's fine, but not to conduct

15

a search on the basis of less probable cause than would

16

normally be necessary.

17

serious threat to the public involved you don't need the

18

same degree of probable cause.

19

MR. NEIMAND:

We don't say,

if there's a really

We haven't said that.

Well, the intrusions between

20

probable cause and a reasonable-suspicion Terry frisk are

21

a little bit different.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. NEIMAND:

QUESTION:

25

Oh,

I understand that.
And that --

But if the principle is valid I don't

know why it wouldn't apply to one as to the other.

1

MR. NEIMAND:

Well, because the intrusions are

2

different, and you would need more for a full-scale arrest

3

and search when there's probable cause, because you have

4

to establish probable cause, and probable cause I don't

5

believe is as fluid a situation as reasonable suspicion,

6

because in a reasonable suspicion situation we are in fact

7

looking at a totality of the circumstances.

8

QUESTION:

But in all events --

9

QUESTION:

You're getting back on the notion

10

that I thought we put that to rest and don't have to go

11

over the same ground again.

12

nothing to do with whether the suspicion is reasonable or

13

not.

MR. NEIMAND:

Well we've -If I did, I misspoke, Your Honor.

17

I think that the fact of the matter is that when there is

18

that firearm in that situation, and in a particularly

19

described situation, not in a situation where you would,

20

say, get a tip that there is 100 people on the corner all

21

wearing plaid shirts, and one of those individuals has a

22

firearm.

23

officer then could go and search each and every one of the

24

individuals.

25

That would be the firearm exception, if the

2

possession of a marijuana cigarette standing on the

3

corner.

4

MR. NEIMAND:

I do not believe at that point in

5

time the public safety, or the officer's safety would be

6

affected, and therefore we would have to wait to see

7

whether or not there was --

8

9

QUESTION:

Well, the tip here is, there's a

weapon, and the officer is nowhere near it, but you say

10

that that's enough to assume that the officer's safety is

11

in jeopardy?

MR. NEIMAND:

MR. NEIMAND:

He's not there.
Correct, but once he goes there,

18

what is the officer supposed to do at that point in time,

19

and that's where the --

20

QUESTION:

Well, one would have thought nothing,

21

unless we extend the anonymous tip doctrine to cover it.

22

I mean, I would have though that -- our cases would

23

suggest the anonymous tip, with nothing more than somebody

24

in a plaid shirt on a street corner has a concealed

25

weapon, I wouldn't have though that was enough, unless we

somehow extend the doctrine.
MR. NEIMAND:

2

Well,

in that situation what would

3

be proper police -- it might not be what is under the case

4

law, but what would be proper police investigation in that

5

situation, and you would have to give the officer's

6

experience,

7

area -QUESTION:

8
9

and the -- based upon the neighborhood, the

Counsel, the officer's experience is

that guns are often mixed up with drugs,

so the anonymous

10

tip is, three guys standing on a street corner, and one of

11

them in a plaid-like shirt has crack, and the police

12

officer knows from his experience that people who engage

3

in selling crack often have guns,

4

what you say, the police having an anonymous tip about

5

crack can therefore frisk for a weapon?

6

MR. NEIMAND:

No.

so does it follow,

from

In that situation, once again

7

the tip is the knowledge that there are drugs, or the idea

8

that there might be drugs present, and I believe that the

9

requirement there is to wait until there is actual sale or

20

use of the drugs, and then you have the -QUESTION:

21

But he's not -- the officer's

concern,

but the gun.

in this case she, her concern is not the drugs

1

couldn't she say, well, the tip was about drugs, but I

2

know from experience that he's probably carrying a gun, so

3

I'm going to, for my safety, frisk him?

4

MR. NEIMAND:

Well, the first thing is that the

5

tip would have come in, and an officer getting a tip of

6

that nature would have surmised that the person had seen

7

the individuals, where they were located, described them,

8

and had seen the gun, and therefore, without the drugs

9

being involved -- and the tip would have said the gun, and

10
11

that's the difference.
In the other situation Your Honor gives us, we

12

don't know that there are drugs.

13

surmise of the officer that there could be a gun, but the

14

information that was gotten was the drugs, and that is

15

part of the totality of the circumstances --

16

QUESTION:

We're using the basic

Well, in your public safety argument,

17

as I understand it you're not arguing just for the safety

18

of the policeman, but that more damage can result to some

19

member of the public in a confrontation with somebody with

20

a gun than a confrontation with somebody who has a cache

21

of drugs, isn't that correct?

22

MR. NEIMAND:

Correct, Your Honor.

In that

23

situation, that's why we say the officer/public safety,

24

because if the officer does not act, then the

QUESTION:

But there's one thing I don't

2

understand.

3

it's perfectly all right in Florida, unless you're a

4

juvenile -- and I don't know how this officer knew this

5

young person was a juvenile based on the tip, but except

6

for juveniles, is it not lawful for persons in Florida to

7

carry concealed weapons?

10

At the very beginning I think you said that

There is a privilege that if they

go through the permitting -QUESTION:

But the mere fact that you suspect

11

someone of having a gun doesn't mean he doesn't have that

12

privilege, he doesn't have a permit.

13

MR. NEIMAND:

14

QUESTION:

No, but we can --

I would think that it's more jeopardy

15

if you say they're a drug dealer, because that's

16

definitely illegal, but if you just say he's got a gun,

17

well, you presume that the person obeys the law.

18

MR. NEIMAND:

It's a presumption that they

19

legally got the gun, but not a presumption that they will

20

legally use the gun.

21

Well, we reached a different result

in Adams v. Williams, did we not?

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

Mr. Neimand, I thought a frisk in

stop and frisk, a frisk is incidental to the stop.

7

we said is, when you see somebody behaving suspiciously,

8

what the policeman is authorized to do is to stop the

9

person and make inquiry -- Why are you hanging around on

10

this street corner?

11

here?

Where do you come from?

What

In this case, by contrast, the whole reason for

the policeman going up to this person is to frisk him.

would satisfy him that in fact he is not the suspicious

character that he had reason to believe?

criminality, was he carrying a concealed firearm, we are

you ascertain whether a crime has been committed puts the

police officer in harm's way at that time, and if you fail

harm's way, because you do not know when that individual

anonymous tip, and someone who, in fact, was on a street

10

MR. GORNSTEIN:

The totality of the

11

circumstances consists of the following four things:

12

tip, the confirmation of the verifiable details of the

13

tip, the absence of any observations that led the officer

14

to conclude that there was -- that his suspicions should

15

not be aroused when he got to the scene, and the fact that

this tip concerned a gun that was unlawful for a child to

MR. GORNSTEIN:

13

Can

Are tips about guns

We don't have any empirical

evidence on this, and when you're presented with a tip

like this, I think what you resort to is a common sense

judgment that if there's nothing on the face of the tip

17

that is unreliable, the officer is going to go out to the

18

scene.

19

Once he's at the scene, and he confirms the

20

observable details, and nothing decreases his suspicion,

21

then the alternatives to a stop-and-frisk pose an

unreasonable risk of danger to the police and the public.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

that the cases haven't specifically addressed this

reason is that probable cause is constitutional text that

MR. GORNSTEIN:

No.

What it is interpreting is

the general reasonableness requirement, and the way the

If the tip is about somebody at a courthouse

The only justification that I can see in the

1

2

State's argument for upholding the stop and frisk is that

3

an anonymous tipster alleged the presence of a firearm,

4

but that, of course, doesn't make the tip any more

5

reliable, and it doesn't lower the reasonable suspicion

6

standard.

7

In Terry v. Ohio, this Court said that where

8

there is a reasonable suspicion that the individual is

9

engaged in criminality, the officers can stop, and that

10

where there is a reasonable belief that the individual is

11

armed and presently dangerous -- and presently

12

dangerous -- then the officer can conduct a frisk.

13

There were three -- as I understand it, there

14

were three components to the Terry holding that I think

15

are very, very relevant to this case:

16

a pat-down is not a minimal intrusion.

17

that the limitation placed on Terry is, where there's a

18

reasonable belief that the threat is of an individual that

19

is armed and presently dangerous.

and immediate threat, not a possible or a potential one.

That's the tip.

Yes, Your Honor.
You don't know anything else.
Yes, Your Honor.

If it is a

7

reliable -- if it is not -- if it's an anonymous tip, then

8

the next thing that I believe a police officer ought to do

9

is, is there any kind of independent police work that I

can do to either corroborate what I've heard in this tip,

11

or find something other than that that's suspicious?
If there's not any other corroborating

What I'm suggesting to the Court is

that the nature of the offense in general terms ought not

Okay.

Then let's assume that with

all the efforts the police may make in the bomb case, or

high schools around the country are now putting out

guidelines and asking fellow students to please alert the

8

school authorities any time the student thinks there might

be someone in the school with a gun, and so I think we're

fabrication has now been called into serious question.

I'm not suggesting that this is going to happen, but it is

also true from a common sense perspective that if this

proposal were adopted, tips that now come into police

MR. SEPLER:

QUESTION:

But that's the Alabama v. White -That's --- that says the other circumstances,

15

other than the anonymous tip were not enough, but coupled

16

with the anonymous tip, it was.

17

MR. SEPLER:

In Alabama v. White, as I

18

understand it, the critical factor in making the

19

determination was that there was corroboration of

20

predictive features of the tip, and that absent those

21

predictive features, and absent the corroboration of those

22

predictive features, the tip in Alabama v. White would not

23

have been sufficient.

But again, if the officer had a hunch, based on
his or her 30 years experience, and seen the very same

things that were in -- that were named in the tip, the

officer would not be entitled to make that stop and frisk.

QUESTION:

Yes, but perhaps you missed my point

with respect to Alabama.

the Court in Alabama v. White, that without the tip, what

the officer did and saw would not be sufficient.

street corner here could have seen, without the tip, and

still couldn't have done anything, really is not any

inconsistency at all.

That was exactly the analysis of

With the

It's quite consistent with our

MR. SEPLER:

Your Honor, again, as I -- and I

13

hope I'm answering your question directly -- as I

14

understand White, it was yes, that there was a tip, but it

15

was the corroboration of the predictive features in the

16

tip that made all the difference.

17

any predictive features, then even though there was a tip,

18

and even though there was corroboration of details of

identification, this Court in White found that to be

insufficient.

If the tip didn't have

QUESTION:

I don't under -- do you really

MR. SEPLER:

it's, there's something suspicious in the predictive

QUESTION:

9

I agree, Your Honor -I've never understood that about the

case.
MR. SEPLER:

As I understand the predictive

10

features, you predict conduct.

11

Wardlow didn't have conduct, but if -- but it's the

12

conduct that is the most critical.

13

As -- well, of course,

If the person said he's going to -- on the

14

street corner and he's going to catch the number 4 bus,

15

well, that would be all the difference.

16

there and he's not doing anything, you have no predictive

17

features of anything to corroborate, and absent those

18

predictive features, I think what you have in all

19

seriousness is, you do have a situation where anybody,

20

anywhere, could be stopped for nothing more than casual

21

observation.

If he's standing

This Court said in White that in order to allow

for meaningful corroboration, there has to be that

was made, as to things that are not available by casual

observation or rumor or reputation.

3

And then, of course, the Court went on to the

meaningful corroboration, and it used the predictive

elements to provide that meaningful corroboration.

6

this sense, everything that was in that tip were things

that were occurring at the time that the tip was made,

everything in that tip were things that were available by

absolutely nothing to show that these gentlemen made any

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. NEIMAND

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. NEIMAND:

9

Thank you.

The questions concerning the bomb really

10

11

underscore the duality of the issues in front of the

12

Court.

13

said an anonymous tip could never be enough, and clearly,

14

with the bomb situation it would have to be enough.

15

There's too much public safety involved.

16

The first issue is that the Florida supreme court

The second question then becomes, under the

17

facts of this case, were the facts sufficient to allow the

19

because it was a juvenile -- there is a problem in Florida

20

with juveniles and hand guns -- the tip was immediately

21

corroborated, these individuals were at the exact

22

location, dressed accordingly, within 6 minutes.

23

what were the officers supposed to do under those

24

circumstances?

In this situation,

1

safety in jeopardy, or could have gone to investigate.

2

he investigated he would have put his life in jeopardy by

3

not immediately frisking the individual, and that is why

4

in this case, on the factual situation the State submits

5

that the Florida supreme court was wrong, if, in fact, on

6

the law they were wrong as well.

7

If

As to the question of the 22-year-old in

8

Florida, because an individual has only a privilege to

9

carry a concealed firearm, there really is no problem with

10

an officer if there is a tip that an individual is

11

carrying a concealed firearm who is 22, or even older, to

12

come up to that individual and ask for the permit.

13

But before you ask for the permit, if you ask

14

somebody for a gun, just because they're legally carrying

15

the gun, that doesn't mean they're going to legally use

16

the gun and therefore, again, even in that situation the

17

public safety, the officer's safety in ascertaining

18

whether or not the individual has a permit to carry that

19

gun would allow the immediate frisk upon the stop, and

20

then the interrogation occurs.

21

And upon the interrogation, do you have a

22

permit, yes, I do, here it is, thank you very much, here's

23

your gun, and the stop as a Terry stop should be as

24

limited because the criminal activity, suspicion of

criminal activity was dispelled, and that's the dispelling
