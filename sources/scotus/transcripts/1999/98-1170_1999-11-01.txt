CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Ray Agard.

Mr. Zwerling.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW ZWERLING

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ZWERLING:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:

10

A prosecutor should be permitted, even for the

11

first time on summation, to ask the jury to consider the

12

credibility-influencing factor of a defendant's

13

nonsequestered status as a witness, particularly where, as

14

here, it's conceded that such status creates a risk of

15

truth-distortion.

16

Allowing this would be consistent with the

17

century-old principle articulated by this Court that for

18

impeachment purposes, when a defendant takes the stand,

19

he's to be treated like any other witness.

20

materially advances the fundamental goal of truth-seeking

21

that this Court has often spoken about.

22

QUESTION:

This rule

Mr. Zwerling, would the prosecutor

23

have been entitled to a jury instruction that the jury

24

could draw an adverse inference by virtue of the fact --

25

as to guilt by virtue of the fact that the defendant had
4

1

sat in the courtroom the whole time?
MR. ZWERLING:

2

The prosecutor would be entitled

3

to a jury instruction that as for impeachment purposes the

4

jury could consider the effects, if any, of the

5

defendant's status as a nonsequestered witness.
I mean, this Court has recognized since biblical

6
7

times -- or, not this Court has recognized since biblical

8

times.
(Laughter.)
QUESTION:

10

May I just interrupt?

I'm not sure

11

you answered Justice O'Connor's question.

12

could get a different question, but could -- would the

13

prosecutor be entitled to the instruction that she

14

suggested, that they may draw an adverse inference from

15

the fact?

16

MR. ZWERLING:

You said he

The short answer is no, Your

17

Honor, the prosecutor would not be entitled to an

18

instruction that as to guilt the jury could consider the

1

effects, if any, of the defendant's nonsequestered status.

20

It would solely be for impeachment purposes.

21

QUESTION:

Could the prosecutor make that remark

22

without correction from the district -- from the trial

23

judge if the defendant's testimony on the stand was in all

24

respects consistent with the testimony -- with his

25

previous statements that he'd given to the police, et
5

1

2
3
4

cetera?
MR. ZWERLING:

Could the prosecutor still make

that remark?
QUESTION:

Yes.

He said, now, ladies and

5

gentlemen, you know, this man's been here, and so his

6

testimony is pretty well rehearsed.

7

proper for the trial judge to say, ladies and gentlemen of

8

the jury, I just want you to know that the testimony he's

9

given has been consistent with his previous testimony.

10
11

If -- would it be

Could the trial judge interrupt to that effect?
MR. ZWERLING:

The prosecutor in the first

12

instance, judge, would not be able to stand up without any

13

factual predicate whatsoever, make the argument to the

14

jury that the defendant's testimony is in some way

15

tailored, simply by virtue of the --

16

QUESTION:

It has to be a factual predicate?

17

MR. ZWERLING:

To make an affirmative claim of

18

tailoring, Your Honor, but I just want to state as a

19

threshold principle that just, much in the way that a jury

20

can consider a defendant's interest in the outcome, you do

21

not need a factual predicate, other than the defendant's

22

exposure to the testimony of the witnesses, to throw out

23

that question to the jury for its consideration as the

24

trier of fact to determine what, if any, impact that

25

exposure had.
6

QUESTION:

1

The prosecutor wouldn't have much

2

incentive in the case proposed by Justice Kennedy.

3

mean, that argument is not going to go over with the jury

4

if you say, look, this guy was sitting here all the time

5

and was able to tailor his testimony, and yet his

6

testimony is entirely consistent with all the other

7

witnesses.

8

MR. ZWERLING:

I

It simply wouldn't be a rational

argument, Your Honor.
10

QUESTION:

What if it is -- I'm going to give

11

you a really hard one, Mr. Zwerling.

12

prosecutor knows that his testimony, that the defendant's

13

testimony is entirely consistent with a confession that

14

was given earlier and that has been excluded?

15

MR. ZWERLING:

What if the

If the prosecutor, under those

16

circumstances, stood up and said to the jury that a

17

statement, or -- well, this is assuming that the

18

prosecutor relied upon that confession at trial.

1

QUESTION:

No, I'm saying it was excluded and --

20

MR. ZWERLING:

If it's excluded, Your Honor, and

21

the prosecutor stood up as an officer of the court and

22

told the jury that the testimony at trial was the first

23

time that the defendant has stood up to give this

24

particular version, then it would be error.

25

It wouldn't be error under Griffin analysis.
7

It

1

would be another form of prosecutorial -QUESTION:

2

But that wasn't the question, Mr.

3

Zwerling.

As I understand your position, you seem to be

4

qualifying it, but I'm not sure, that in any case where

5

the defendant takes the stand, so he's putting his

6

credibility in issue, in any such case -- you said

7

something about the peculiar facts of this case, but I

8

thought your position was, defendant takes the stand, the

9

prosecutor legitimately in summation can say, ladies and

10

gentlemen of the jury, please take into account that

11

defendant was the only witness who sat through this entire

12

trial and therefore could conform his testimony to what

13

others said.

14

MR. ZWERLING:

Yes, Your Honor.

In every case

15

where the defendant has been exposed to the testimony of

16

other witnesses, like any other witness, he's subject to

17

the ills of nonsequestration, and therefore it is proper

18

for the prosecutor in every case to throw that question of

19

fact out to the jury in much the same way as a prosecutor

20

is permitted, as this Court has sanctioned, to make the

21

argument that a defendant's interest in the outcome may

22

have affected his credibility as a witness.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Zwerling, in New York I take it

24

there's a statute that requires the defendant to be

25

present at his trial.
8

1

MR. ZWERLING:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. ZWERLING:

QUESTION:

Well, then,

how do you deal with the

Doyle case?
MR. ZWERLING:

8
9

I can't speak for every State,

but it's certainly true in Your Honor --

6
7

That isn't true in every State, I

assume.

4
5

That is true, Your Honor.

A couple of ways, Your Honor.

First of all, this particular issue is not properly before

10

the Court.

11

raise in any State appellate litigation, or even in the

12

Federal courts below.

13

respondent's brief before this Court.

14

It wasn't raised in the trial court, wasn't

QUESTION:

It was raised for the first time in

It's not a different issue.

15

just an additional argument.

16

issue of the improper comment by the prosecutor.

17

MR. ZWERLING:

It's

I mean, he has raised the

Well, in New York, Your Honor, a

18

defendant can waive his presence at trial upon application

19

to the court.

20

trial court to grant that application, nonetheless that's

21

an application that could be made by a defendant, and

22

we're not in this particular case in a position to know

23

what the trial court would have done, because no such

24

request was made.

25

Now, while it's in the discretion of the

If such a request was made and even denied, then
9

1

perhaps a defendant could request a jury instruction to

2

alert the jury -QUESTION:

3

But your argument is a little extreme

4

in the situation where, by State law, the defendant has to

5

be there, and any time the defendant testifies, even if

6

it's totally consistent with his prior but excluded

7

confession, you say the prosecutor can nonetheless get up

8

in summation and try to use his presence at the trial
against him.

10

MR. ZWERLING:

11

QUESTION:

12
13

Well --

I mean, that's -- how do you

justify -MR. ZWERLING:

Your Honor, for the reason that

14

it's not possible to detect how a witness' testimony might

15

have been affected by the nonsequestered status.

16

Ironically, the Second Circuit in the Jackson case, which

17

we cite in our brief, stated that it's virtually

18

impossible to say how a person's testimony would have been

1

affected, and consistency with pretrial statements is just

20

one factor that can go into discerning whether or not some

21

confabulation took place, or some alteration, intentional

22

alteration took place.

23

QUESTION:

You say it's pretty much like -- I

24

think you've already said, like the trial judge's charge,

25

you may take into consideration the interest of every
10

1

witness in the outcome of the proceedings, and that would

2

apply to the defendant as well as to any other witness.
MR. ZWERLING:

3

In the interested witness

4

context, Your Honor, there may very well be defendants

5

whose testimony is unaffected by their interest in the

6

outcome.

7

witness charge and it's up to the jury, as a trier of

8

fact, to determine what effect, if any, that individual's

Nonetheless, they are subjected to an interested

interest had on their reliability as a witness.
10

Similarly, here --

11

QUESTION:

12

Mr. Zwerling, there was an interested

witness charge in this case, wasn't there?

13

MR. ZWERLING:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, there was, Your Honor.

So this is doubling, underscoring, or

15

putting it in bold face, for one witness only.

16

interested witness charge in this case covered the

17

defendant, as it might have covered other witnesses.

18

MR. ZWERLING:

The

20

motive to lie.

21

witnesses goes to an opportunity to lie and, even not just

22

lie, there's an issue of confabulation, innocent

23

alterations in testimony, replacing facts --

24

The interested witness charge goes to a
Exposure to the testimony of other

QUESTION:

Yes, but in answer to the Chief's

question you equated the two, and now you're telling us,
11

1

well, they are indeed different, and you are entitled,

2

rightly, to both.
MR. ZWERLING:

3

I'm not -- I'm saying, Your

4

Honor, I'm using the interested witness charge scenario by

5

analogy.

6

lay a factual predicate that the defendant's interest

7

actually affected his testimony in order to get a charge,

8

a prosecutor doesn't have to actually prove that a

9

defendant's testimony was altered, either innocently or

10
11
12
13
14

Just as a prosecutor doesn't have to prove or

purposefully, as a predicate for getting -QUESTION:

Were there witnesses other than the

defendant in fact sequestered in this case?
MR. ZWERLING:

In this case, all of the other

witnesses was sequestered, Your Honor.

15

QUESTION:

Were sequestered, yes.

16

MR. ZWERLING:

But again, similar to an

17

interested witness scenario, in most cases, or in many

18

cases the defendant is the only witness who has an

19

interest in the outcome.

20

charge isn't singling the defendant out because under the

21

facts of that particular case he happens to be the only

22

one with an interest in the outcome.

23

the defendant in that context, and in the context before

24

the Court, because there's some external factor, either a

25

defendant's interest in the outcome, or his exposure to

A charge, an interested witness

12

They're singling out

1

the testimony of witnesses that may affect his

2

credibility.
QUESTION:

3

Well, with respect to the exposure to

4

the others, I'd like you just to go back to Doyle for a

5

minute.

6

the defendant's post Miranda silence was -- I think it was

7

ambiguous.

8

ambiguous, I think was the phrase that the court used.

9

One of the strands of reasoning in Doyle was that

I forget what adjective was -- insolubly

Don't we have an insoluble ambiguity problem in

10

the predicate for the comment in issue here, because to

11

the extent that the testimony of the defendant is, in

12

fact, congruent with that of other witnesses save at some,

13

you know, crucial exculpatory point, we don't know, and I

14

presume in the absence of some affirmative evidence going

15

to the truth or falsity of particular statements, there's

16

no way for a jury to know whether in fact that congruence

17

is the result of truth or the result of tailoring.

18

So that if a comment like this, let alone an

19

instruction on this point, is given in the absence of some

20

affirmative reason in the evidence to think that there was

21

particular tailoring on a particular point, it sounds to

22

me as though the ambiguity, as in Doyle, would simply give

23

the jury kind of a wild card.

24
25

MR. ZWERLING:

What's your answer to that?

It's two-pronged, Your Honor, one

specifically dealing with the facts in Doyle, and then a
13

1

more general response.
In response to the Doyle prong of the question,

2

3

in Doyle in both footnote number 10 of that decision and

4

in the dissenting opinion written by Justice Stevens, it

5

was pointed out that the prosecutor in that case used the

6

defendant's, or the apparent inconsistency between the

7

defendant's testifying at trial and his silence after

8

receiving Miranda warnings as proof of guilt.

9

It was referred to in footnote 10 that the

10

prosecutor implied guilt, and it was dealt with more

11

specifically in the dissenting opinion that the prosecutor

12

asked the jury, or suggested to the jury that the

13

testimony, or that inconsistency was inconsistent with

14

innocence.

15

QUESTION:

Well, that's true, but whether we're

16

dealing with something that goes to impeachment or whether

17

we're dealing with something that goes to guilt, there is

18

the problem of ambiguity, and it's the ambiguity that's

19

bothering me.

20

MR. ZWERLING:

Yes, Your Honor.

In terms of the

21

ambiguity, however, in this particular -- with this

22

particular credibility influencing factor, it's been

23

recognized that it does have effect, have an effect on a

24

witness who's exposed to the testimony of other witnesses,

25

and - 14

QUESTION:

1

I don't understand why -- maybe I've

2

got the assumption wrong, but are you conceding that there

3

was no cause on the part of the prosecutor to mention

4

this?
I mean, I counted six or seven times in which

5
6

the defense attorney emphasized the word consistency,

7

three times in which he said --or maybe it was two or

8

three, the defense attorney says, the defendant told a

9

totally consistent story.

He didn't use the word totally,

10

he says a consistent story, and about three or four times

11

in which he said the prosecuting witness' story was

12

inconsistent, so the prosecutor gets up and says, sure it

13

was consistent, he heard all the witnesses.

14

I mean, is this -- are we supposed to decide

15

this case on the assumption there was no cause for the

16

prosecutor to say, well, he heard the witnesses, that's

17

why he was consistent.

18

say he was inconsistent.
Well, you know, how are we supposed to decide

19
20

this case?

I don't understand.
MR. ZWERLING:

21
22

He just heard the defense attorney

If Your Honor is referring to the

specifics of this case, the -QUESTION:

23

I mean, am I not supposed to look at

24

the specifics of the case when I decide the legal

25

question?
15

MR. ZWERLING:

L

In terms of the particular facts

2

of this case, the prosecutor's remarks were entirely

3

proper.

4
5

5

QUESTION:

All right.

Is that -- then why

aren't you arguing that?
MR. ZWERLING:

They're proper for two reasons,

7

Your Honor.

a) they were invited by the remarks of

3

defense counsel, which resounded from the outset of the

9

trial in his opening statement, through his summation,

ID

where he argued that the mere fact that the prosecution

11

witnesses were exposed to one another, therefore they

12

tailored their testimony, therefore they fabricated this

13

story against the defendant, and under the particular

14

facts of this case, it was proper for the prosecutor to

15

stand up and say, well, they may have been exposed to one

16

another, but the defendant was exposed to everybody.

17

Those remarks were invited by the remarks of

18

defense counsel, and the prosecutor's remarks in this case

19

were a reasonable response, and she didn't --

20

QUESTION:

But on that point the Second Circuit

21

disagreed with you and said, if there had been in this

22

case an attempt to show that particular pieces of

23

information were tailored, so be it.

24

a generic claim, and you answered in response to me that

25

that is your position, that in every case where the
16

But you were making

1

defendant takes the stand, that is the rule the prosecutor

2

can bring out in summation, and now you seem again to be

3

retreating from that.
But I got from your brief, I got from your

4
5

arguments up until now that you are taking that position,

6

defendant testifies, it's legitimate for the prosecutor to

7

bring out that he heard all the witnesses.
MR. ZWERLING:

8
9

Your Honor, to make myself clear,

for the prosecutor to make the generic argument, to throw

10

the question of fact out to the jury you should consider

11

the effects of the defendant's exposure to testimony.

12

don't need a factual predicate more than his exposure to

13

the testimony of others.

14

In this particular case --

15

QUESTION:

16

You

He doesn't have to be invited, you're

saying.
MR. ZWERLING:

17

Yes, Your Honor.

In this

18

particular case, the prosecutor did more than throw out

19

that question of fact to the jury.

20

affirmative statement that the defendant tailored, he

21

altered purposefully his testimony, and where a prosecutor

22

is going to do that, there has to be some factual

23

predicate.

24

she also did, she laid out a factual predicate.

25

The prosecutor made an

Either the remarks have to be invited, or as

QUESTION:

Am I right that in New York a
17

1

defendant has no right to bring out on rebuttal prior

2

consistent statements that the defendant made before he

heard the witnesses?
MR. ZWERLING:

5

to lie arose.
QUESTION:

6
7
8

9
10
11

If they are made after the motive

Well, when would that be in a case

like this?
MR. ZWERLING:

In this particular case, the

defendant could not have brought out his prior consistent
statements, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, is there any reason why the

12

constitutional doctrine here should follow the niceties of

13

the law of evidence on when you can impeach witnesses?

14

MR. ZWERLING:

No, Your Honor.

I think a clear

15

distinction should be drawn.

16

analysis which the respondent in the Second Circuit had

17

been relying upon, and then there are rules of evidence.

18

The line should be drawn, and it has been drawn by this

19

Court in the past, and I just want to point out that under

20

the facts --

21

QUESTION:

There's the constitutional

This is not a rule of evidence.

This

22

is prosecutorial misconduct in his comments, in argument.

23

No evidentiary question is presented, is it?

24
25

MR. ZWERLING:

But the question is whether or

not Griffin penalty analysis is implicated by virtue of
18

1

such comments, and the answer is no, because the

2

prosecutor's comments in no way created the suggestion

3

that the jury should take those comments and rely upon

4

them as proof of guilt in this particular case.

5

QUESTION:

I'm not sure.

6

MR. ZWERLING:

I see the white light has gone

7

on.

I'd like to reserve some time for rebuttal if there

8

are no questions from the Court.
QUESTION:

9

Mr. Nuechterlein.

14

Do you pronounce your name

Nuechterlein, or Nuechterlein.
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

12

It's Nuechterlein, that's

correct.
QUESTION:

Nuechterlein, okay.

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Like any other witness, a criminal defendant who

elects to take the stand is subject to fair comment on his

credibility as a witness.

principle is this.

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

I think as a general matter

this kind of comment is appropriate.

11

12

consistency.
QUESTION:

13

There may be special

Well, is there a -- but you take the

position that it would be proper in every case.

15

something that is commonly done by Federal prosecutors, to

16

your knowledge?
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

17

Is this

The issue has come up in a

18

handful of Federal cases.

It has not come up in a large

1

number of Federal cases.

That could be the result of one

20

of two factors.

defendants recognize the argument as often being fair

25

One is, either the prosecutors don't make

Do you think that an instruction to

the jury would be appropriate -20

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

QUESTION:

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

I

-- reinforcing this statement?
Probably yes, but that would

4

be a closer case, because there are many contexts in which

5

we permit prosecutors to make arguments to the jury in

6

their role as advocates that we do not permit judges to

7

make to the jury in their role as neutral arbiter of the

8

proceedings.
QUESTION:

9

My concern is, is that if we adopt

10

your position, which is not without some strong reasons to

11

recommend it, that although that's -- this comment is not

12

usually made now, a year hence it will be standard.

13

It will be in every prosecutor's manual, and

14

then the trial judge will have to say, now, ladies and

15

gentlemen of the jury, it would be an extraordinary

16

occurrence were the defendant not present at all phases of

17

the trial.

18

counsel and be apprised of the charges against him, and

19

therefore you cannot hold that against -- and so we go

20

back and forth.

21

He must be present in order to assist his

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

Actually, this comment,

22

Justice Kennedy, is made in a number -- has been made in a

23

number of cases.

24

example, cites about a dozen State court cases in which

25

it's come up.

The court of appeals opinion, for

The comments in those cases were very
21

1

similar to the comments in these, and after the Second

2

Circuit issued its original opinion in this case, there

3

has been a handful of cases in that jurisdiction in which

4

defendants have raised precisely this sort of argument.
QUESTION:

5

Well, excuse me, I don't understand

6

the defendant here to be asserting what those -- that

7

judge's instruction would have told the jury, that you

8

therefore can't take it into account.

9

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

I had understood Justice

10

Kennedy's question to relate to arguments the

11

prosecutor -QUESTION:

12

13

I mean, that's not at issue in this

case.

14

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

15

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Isn't it agreed by both sides that

16

the jury can take account of the fact that he's been

17

sitting in court during the entire argument?

18

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

19

QUESTION:

That's certainly correct.

And the jury is not entitled to an

20

instruction, as it is with regard to the right, of the

21

Fifth Amendment right of nonincrimination.

22

not entitled to an instruction that you should not take --

23

you should not take the defendant's refusal to testify to

24

be an admission of guilt.

25

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

That's correct.
22

The jury is

1

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose a trial judge could

2

go on and say, if you find he altered his testimony by

3

reason of his presence you can take that --

4

QUESTION:

Well, but --

5

QUESTION:

-- into account.

But the whole point

6

is, it just seems to me that this is a new area in which

7

we're going to have comment, countercomment,

8

instructions --

9

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

Justice Kennedy, this is not

10

a new area.

11

principle of the common law that if a witness is exposed

12

to the testimony of other witnesses before giving his own,

13

that gives him an advantage, and it is the sort of

14

advantage that a lawyer has a right to bring to the

15

attention of the jury.

16

In fact, for hundreds of years it has been a

QUESTION:

Well, when you get into the area of

17

instructions by the trial court, you also get into the

18

question of whether a defendant would request a particular

19

instruction.

20

I know when I practiced, long ago, the defense

21

attorney, criminal defense attorneys were split on the

22

question of whether it was an advantage to the defendant

23

to have the judge charge that he was not required to take

24

the stand and they weren't to hold it against him.

25

was certainly the constitutional law, but it also called
23

That

1

the jury's attention to the fact that the defendant hadn't

2

taken the stand, and maybe made it worse.
So I don't think you should think in terms of

3
4

automatic charges by the judge.

5

requested or could -- if a defendant didn't request them,

6

they wouldn't be given.
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

7

8

Often, they have to be

That is correct, and again I

just want to reemphasize the point that I believe that a
trial judge would have the discretion to give that kind of

10

instruction, but you don't have to agree with me on that

11

in order to reverse the judgment below, because there

12

really are a variety of contexts in which we want to give

13

prosecutors leeway to make effective arguments where we

14

would not permit a judge to make an analogous comment.
QUESTION:

15
16

Don't you think the Doyle case cuts

against your position somewhat?
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

17

I do not, for two reasons.

18

One, Doyle was significantly limited by subsequent

1

precedent, namely Jenkins v. Anderson and Fletcher v.

20

Weir.

21

Doyle was based on an estoppel principle.

22

warning was construed as an implicit assurance that the

23

suspect's silence would not then be used against him.

24

There is no analogous estoppel issue that arises here.

25

Secondly, in the Doyle context there is some

In both of those cases this Court observed that

24

The Miranda

1

risk that the jury will view the defendant's prior silence

2

as substantive evidence of guilt.

3

is

4

QUESTION:

Here, that concern

On the other hand, in the Doyle facts

5

there is some inconsistency as a practical matter between

6

the silence at the time of questioning and the contrived

7

story at the time of trial, but here there's no

8

inconsistency, there's just an opportunity, so it seems to

9

me this case is a fortiori from Doyle, and I didn't agree

10

11
12
13

with Doyle, as you may know.
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

What do you mean, Justice

Stevens, when you say it's a fortiori -QUESTION:

Well, here the prosecutor can make

14

this comment even though there's no -- nothing in the

15

record that would imply that there's some inconsistency

16

between the testimony and the actual fact, whereas in

17

Doyle, the fact that he was silent is in itself somewhat

18

inconsistent with his having come up with a story later.

19

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

There are a variety of

20

reasons why a lawyer should have discretion to make

21

comments about the credibility of the witness.

22

those is inconsistency, but another one would also be the

23

common law rule that if a defendant is exposed to the

24

testimony of other witnesses before giving his own, that

25

makes it more difficult for the fact-finder to discern
25

One of

1

whether there's any falsity in this story.

2

QUESTION:

Well --

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Nuechterlein, if we applied Doyle

4

here, we would again have to instruct the jury not to take

5

account of the fact that he has heard all the testimony.

6

It wouldn't be just a question of whether -- whether the

7

prosecutor can invite the jury's attention to that fact.

8

The jury would be entitled, if we are -- as I understand

9

Doyle, if we are following Doyle, the jury -- the

10

defendant would be entitled to an instruction that you

11

shall not take into account the fact that he's heard all

12

the testimony.
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

13

If Doyle were the basis of an

14

opinion affirming the judgment below, I imagine there

15

would be arguments analogous to Carter v. Kentucky in

16

which defendants would claim a right to a jury instruction

17

of that kind.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Nuechterlein --

19

QUESTION:

May I ask one other verify brief

20

question?

21

Am I correct in thinking all of those cases came to the

22

view that this was improper comment?

23

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

24
25

You refer to all the State cases that's arisen.

No, that is incorrect,

Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

They didn't.
26

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

1

At least four of them cited

2

in the court of appeals opinion upheld the comments as

3

fair comment.

4

QUESTION:

I see.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Nuechterlein, you mentioned in

6

distinguishing Doyle the risk there of the jury's

7

confusing impeachment with proof of guilt.

8

risk equally great here?
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

9

Isn't that

I don't think so.

Here is

10

why.

11

silence in the face of accusation as substantive evidence

12

of guilt in itself.

13

could conceivably view the defendant's mere presence in

14

the courtroom as evidence of guilt.

15

In Doyle, a jury might well view a defendant's

QUESTION:

Here, there is no risk that the jury

No, but the jury is going to go from

16

mere presence to a suspicion of tailoring.

17

lying, and as the old saw has it, a man who will lie will

18

steal, or whatever.

19

jury will sort of follow that sequence of reasoning?

20

Tailoring is

I mean, isn't that the risk, that the

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

Justice Souter, I think that

21

reasoning proves too much, because it would eviscerate the

22

line this Court has always drawn between impeachment that

23

goes to credibility and evidence that goes to guilt.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well maybe it would, but does it also

eviscerate the line between Doyle and this case?
27

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

1

No, I don't think it does,

2

because the primary basis for this Court's holding in

3

Doyle, as the Court stressed later in Fletcher --

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

6

Is the estoppel point.
-- and Jenkins is the

estoppel point, and there is no analogous problem here.
QUESTION:

7

Mr. Nuechterlein, may I ask a

8

question about your position on brief that Chief Judge

9

Winters' distinction was unworkable, because it seemed to

10

me the Second Circuit worked it out very well in U.S. v.

11

Chako the next time the issue came before them, when they

12

said, look, it's different here.

13

showing of tailoring, not merely opportunity to tailor.
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

14

Here, there was a

Well, I'm not sure whether in

15

Chako there was any actual proof of tailoring, and it's

16

extremely difficult ever to prove tailoring, and I guess

17

our central point is that just as the common law doesn't

18

require a lawyer in other settings to give evidence that a

19

particular witness would have given different testimony

20

had he not been exposed to the testimony of other

21

witnesses, so, too, is it inappropriate here to require

22

the prosecutor to make that sort of showing about a

23

defendant.

24

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Nuechterlein.

25

Ms. Van Ness, we'll hear from you.

1

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BEVERLY VAN NESS

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. VAN NESS:

3
4

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I just would like to focus, if I can, on what

5
6

happened in this case.

I think petitioner has made

7

concessions in their briefs that are really dispositive of

8

the issues in respondent's favor.

9

petitioner has conceded many times in their main brief,

First of all, the

10

which I think they properly did, that an affirmative

11

accusation of tailoring was, in fact, made in this case.
In their reply brief and again here at oral

12

13

argument they've also conceded, as I think they must, that

14

unless you have actual evidence to support a affirmative

15

accusation of tailoring, that you can't use the exercise

16

of this --

17

QUESTION:

18

that, Ms. Van Ness.

19
20

I don't understand them to concede

MS. VAN NESS:

Your Honor, I think that on pages

2 and 3 of their reply brief --

21

QUESTION:

Yes.

22

MS. VAN NESS:

If I may, they say, nor has

23

petitioner alleged that a tailoring argument may be

24

predicated merely on an accused's presence during the

25

testimony of other witnesses, and on page 3 on the first
29

1

full paragraph, at no time has petitioner argued that a

2

tailoring argument may be built on nothing more than a

3

defendant's mere presence at trial during the taking of

4

testimony.
QUESTION:

5

6

cases on the basis of concessions by the parties.
MS. VAN NESS:

7

8

Well, I should add, we don't decide

I understand that, Your Honor,

but I
QUESTION:

9

Ms. -- more than that, Ms. Van Ness.

10

If that is what this case is about, just a fight over

11

whether in fact the prosecutor made an accusation of

12

tailoring that had no possible basis in fact, you should

13

have made that point, it seems to me, in your opposition

14

to the petition for certiorari.

15

the case is about, I don't think I would have taken it.

16

We're not interested in deciding that factual question.

17

If I had known that's all

The question presented makes it very clear that

18

it's talking about a much more broader, much broader and

19

more important issue.
MS. VAN NESS:

20
21

did not put that in my --

22
23
24
25

Well, regrettably, Your Honor, I

QUESTION:

Well, it's a little late to put it

now.
MS. VAN NESS:

But it is an alternate ground for

affirmance, Your Honor, and I think these concessions
30

1
2

are - QUESTION:

We rarely go off on alternate grounds

3

for affirmance unless there's some very obvious reason why

4

we can't decide the issue that is presented in the

5

question presented, which is whether Griffin should be

6

applied to this case.

7

MS. VAN NESS:

Your Honor, going to the

8

opportunity to tailor argument, I would like to make a

9

particular point on that, which is that the opportunity to

10

tailor argument, the quote, mere opportunity to consider

11

the defendant's ability to do this, is really an

12

invitation to the jury to speculate.

13

for the State, you have two inferences that could be drawn

14

from a consistent story by the defendant.

15

that he has tailored his testimony for a number of

16

different -- in a number of different ways, only one of

17

which might be the presence at trial.

18

QUESTION:

You have at best,

One would be

But you're always speculating as to

19

whether the witness is telling the truth or not, and you

20

speculate on the basis of various considerations, and

21

you're usually allowed to call those considerations to the

22

jury's -- what if the witness' eyes are shifting all

23

around the courtroom during the testimony.

24

much like a person who's lying.

25

attention to that?
31

He looks very

Can the prosecutor call

1

MS. VAN NESS:

2

QUESTION:

3

MS. VAN NESS:

Certainly, Your Honor, but --

Of course he can.
-- you're calling attention to

4

evidence.

What my point is, that this is not evidence.

5

At best, this is a possible explanation.

6

evidence that the defendant tailored his testimony -QUESTION:

7

If there is

Well, but it's an important possible

8

explanation.

Suppose in this case the prosecutor did not

9

make this argument and, after an hour of deliberation, the

10

jury sends a note to the judge and they say, dear judge,

11

we know the defendant probably should be present at the

12

trial, maybe he has a constitutional right to be at trial,

13

but we think that in this case his presence enabled him to

14

tailor his testimony, can we hold that tailoring against

15

him.

What's the judge supposed to do?
MS. VAN NESS:

16

My -- the answer to that would

17

be, if you find that there's evidence of tailoring in the

18

record, jury, you are free to consider that evidence, but

19

not that you are free to consider -QUESTION:

20
21

Well, I'm not sure why the prosecutor

really argued anything different here.
MS. VAN NESS:

22

Because the prosecutor was

23

using -- the only evidence was that the defendant was

24

there.

25

fact used the opportunity.

That evidence -- that's not evidence that he in

32

QUESTION:

1

So your position is really -- is

2

really, I was erroneous when I said I didn't think either

3

side, that you were making -- you are making the

4

contention that the jury -- not only may the prosecutor

5

not call the jury's attention to it, the jury may not

6

consider it, and presumably you would be entitled to an

7

instruction, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you should

8

take no account of the fact that the defendant has been

9

sitting here listening to all the testimony, because I

10

don't see any other evidence of tailoring.
MS. VAN NESS:

11

I do think there's a danger in

12

asking the jury to speculate, because the State has the

13

burden of proof, but if a line is to be crossed here, Your

14

Honor, then at the very least this subject must be raised

15

during the defendant's cross-examination to give him the

16

chance to address it.
QUESTION:

17

You're saying in effect that a juror

18

cannot sit in the jury room and say, you know, this guy

19

was very smooth, and the reason he was is because he was

20

there, and that's the way I think.

21

jury could do that.
MS. VAN NESS:

22
23

You don't think the

Well, I don't think it would

be

24

QUESTION:

That's astounding.

25

MS. VAN NESS:

I don't think it would be
33

1

appropriate for them to do it, Your Honor, because I don't

2

think they have any proof that that's what happened.
QUESTION:

3

No, but isn't the point, when the

4

question -- when Justice Kennedy's question says, this guy

5

was very smooth, wouldn't that be, in fact, an evidentiary

6

basis?

7

smooth, and I don't know that your position requires you

8

to say that that would be inappropriate.

9

that is inappropriate?

10

I mean, the suggestion is, sounds a little too

MS. VAN NESS:

Why do you say

Well, Your Honor, I just -- I

11

believe that that's in the nature of an adjective.

12

don't think that's evidence --

13

QUESTION:

I

So you're in effect saying that if

14

the testimony is, shall we say, unrealistically smooth,

15

that that may not be considered?

16

witness, therefore he must be lying.

17

MS. VAN NESS:

18

(Laughter.)

19

QUESTION:

He's a very good
I mean --

I think it's --

That -- I really don't think that

20

facing that issue is what you necessarily have to do in

21

this case, but maybe I misunderstand you.

22

MS. VAN NESS:

Well, but going back to the Doyle

23

point, Your Honor, the -- another explanation for why a

24

defendant's story is consistent and he can't be shaken is

25

that he's telling the truth, and that's why this -34

1

QUESTION:

Oh, that --

2

MS. VAN NESS:

3

QUESTION:

That's why --

You know, that goes to the, you know,

4

the insoluble ambiguity point, but when you start talking

5

about sort of unusual smoothness, I think we are

6

outside -- or at least as I'm using the term, I think

7

we're outside of the kind of testimony which is insolubly

8

ambiguous, and don't you -- isn't that a distinction that
can be drawn?

10
11

It may be a fine line to draw, but isn't

that a distinction that can be drawn?
MS. VAN NESS:

Maybe I'm misunderstanding Your

12

Honor, but certainly if the -- the prosecutor is free to

13

use anything in the evidence to ask the jury to make -- to

14

draw reasonable inferences from, but what they can't do,

15

what I'm arguing they can't do is to ask the jury to

16

speculate, so if you want to use the --

17

QUESTION:

All right, so all you're saying I

18

think is that it would be -- put it this way.

1

terms of instructions.

20

improper for the court, or you're implying that it would

21

be improper for the court to say, because the defendant in

22

any criminal case has the greatest interest of anyone in

23

the courtroom, or any witness in the courtroom, you should

24

devalue the defendant's testimony for interest greater

25

than you'd devalue the testimony of other witnesses who

Put it in

You're saying that it would be

MS. VAN NESS:

3

You're -No, I'm certainly not advocating

that position.
QUESTION:

4

Okay.

What about the position in

5

which the court gives this instruction.

the courtroom and hear other witnesses can tailor their

7

testimony.

9

the defendant's testimony for that reason, period.

The defendant has a right to be in the

MS. VAN NESS:

11

QUESTION:

12

People who are in

Therefore, you should devalue

Well, certainly, I --

You would say that was a wrong

instruction.

13

MS. VAN NESS:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, I would.

And you would say it was a wrong

15

instruction because, as I've given the hypothesis, there's

16

no particularized basis in any evidence for applying that

17

rule of devaluation, isn't that your point?

18

MS. VAN NESS:

19

QUESTION:

That's correct.

All right.

If there is a

20

particularized basis, whether the eyes are going back and

21

forth in Justice Scalia's example, or whether there is an

22

impression of oily smoothness in Justice Kennedy's

23

example, then it seems to me we are outside the realm of

24

pure speculation.

25

Wouldn't you agree?

MS. VAN NESS:

Oh, I -- yes, Your Honor.
36

QUESTION:

1

Certainly, and the court of appeals

2

would decide whether the Constitution has been violated or

3

not presumably, under what you've accepted, by deciding

4

whether, in fact, the defendant was smooth or too smooth.

5

Is that going to be the critical constitutional fault

6

line, whether he was just smooth smooth or oily smooth?

7

(Laughter.)

8

QUESTION:

9

MS. VAN NESS:

10

Is that seriously the distinction?
No, Your Honor, because I

think -QUESTION:

11

And are you accepting the premise

12

that what is wrong in a judge's instruction is also wrong

13

in a prosecutor's argument?

14

prosecutor says in final argument appropriate for a judge

15

to say in instruction?

16

MS. VAN NESS:

17

QUESTION:

18

Is everything that a

No.

No.

The prosecutor surely has greater

latitude than a judge.
MS. VAN NESS:

19

Yes, the prosecutor certainly has

20

greater --he has greater latitude, but circumscribed

21

latitude.

22

arguments based on the record.

23

The arguments that are made must be fair

QUESTION:

But what about the traditional charge

24

about the interested -- interested party?

25

to me in your answers to Justice Souter's questions, some
37

Now, it seems

1

of your other statements, would you allow that to be given

2

in the absence of any showing that the defendant was not

3

telling the truth?
MS. VAN NESS:

4

Well, I think there's a

5

fundamental difference between that charge and the issue

6

in this case, because the motive to lie, it's not -- a

7

motive to lie based on interest has not been presented as

8

a tool that the defendant has which gives him any kind of

9

advantage.
It's a charge which applies -- and this is also

10
11

makes a difference.

It's a charge that applies to all

12

witnesses at trial, not simply to the defendant, and it

13

has nothing to do with the exercise of a constitutional

14

right.

15

right to testify against him.

16

QUESTION:

It's not using the defendant's exercise of his

Well, supposing that the defendant

17

had been sitting through all the trial but there were two

18

other witnesses, two, for some reason, who had also sat

19

all through the trial and had not been sequestered -- all

20

the other witnesses had been sequestered -- so that the

21

charge, the prosecutor's comment could then be directed to

22

two witnesses as well as the defendant.

23

any difference?

24
25

MS. VAN NESS:

Would that make

Well, I think that comments on

other witnesses, depending on the facts of the case,
38

1

2

may -- might be appropriate.
QUESTION:

Those other witnesses --

But how about the generic comment?

3

It no longer singles out just the defendant.

4

out the defendant and other witnesses who have sat there

5

through the proceedings and not been sequestered.

6

MS. VAN NESS:

It singles

Well, as a practical matter, Your

7

Honor, there aren't any, going to be any such witnesses,

8

but if there are -QUESTION:

I've certainly sat in cases where

10

there was some reason for a particular witness not to be

11

sequestered, and it wasn't the defendant.

12

MS. VAN NESS:

Well, all right, Your Honor, but

13

I still wouldn't approve that kind of generic

14

construction, because I think it is fundamentally unfair

15

to the defendant to use his exercise of a right against

16

him without any basis in the record.

17

QUESTION:

Okay, but --

18

QUESTION:

May I ask on that question whether

1

you think it would be fundamentally unfair for the

20

prosecutor at the end of his cross-examination of the

21

defendant, who's the last witness in the case, say, to ask

22

questions -- you were sitting in the courtroom throughout

23

the trial, weren't you, you heard all the testimony, make

24

the point through cross-examination?

25

permissible?
3

Would that be

1

MS. VAN NESS:

Well, certain -- yes.

I do

2

believe that.

I think if the subject comes up on cross-

3

examination at least it gives the witness an opportunity

4

to address the issue, and to proffer any kind of evidence

5

that they might have that they have not used this

6

opportunity to their advantage.

I think --

7

QUESTION:

You've -- I'm sorry.

8

QUESTION:

Well, that wouldn't authorize him to

9
10
11
12
13

use prior consistent statements though, I don't think, if
they were after he'd been arrested.
MS. VAN NESS:

I'm sorry, Your Honor, are you

talking about the defendant or ordinary witnesses?
QUESTION:

I'm talking about the defendant.

I'm

14

just asking you if you think, instead of saving the point

15

for argument, closing argument, the prosecutor makes the

16

point at the end of his cross-examination of the witness,

17

of the defendant who's the last witness in the trial,

18

would that create the same constitutional problem?

19

20

MS. VAN NESS:

Oh, I think it would, because if

that's all that's being asked --

21

QUESTION:

Yes.

22

MS. VAN NESS:

-- Mr. Defendant, you were here

23

and listened to A, B, C, and D, right, did you -- did that

24

give you an opportunity to change your testimony, that

25

that's the same problem as -40

QUESTION:

1

Well, he doesn't add the latter part.

2

He just says, you've been sitting here in the courtroom

3

during this whole trial, and you listened to all the prior

4

witnesses as they were testifying before you came up here

5

to tell this story, is that right.

6

MS. VAN NESS:

7

QUESTION:

8

MS. VAN NESS:

9

Well, that's not -- that's not --

That's all he says.
That's not directly assailing his

exercise of his constitutional right.

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. VAN NESS:

It's not --

Oh, so that -- all right.
It's not saying that the

12

defendant got an advantage out of that, out of being able

13

to hear that testimony.
QUESTION:

14

Now, I don't understand the directly

15

assailing your constitutional right.

16

any burden upon the assertion of the constitutional right?
MS. VAN NESS:

17

If -- you cannot put

Well, I think -- I think in some

18

situations you could, but I don't think you can in this

19

situation, because I think that the value that the State

20

could get out of such an argument is extremely slight

21

compared to the very severe burdens that are placed on a

22

defendant by the -- by being -- them being given

23

permission to raise this argument.
QUESTION:

24
25

answer.

I just want to understand your

So you're saying that the question Justice Scalia
41

1

proposes is proper.

The counsel's very sarcastic.

2

was, now you've been here for 3 days, and you've heard all

3

of these witness -- that's why you're telling the story

4

you're telling.

5

MS. VAN NESS:

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. VAN NESS:

8

It

I don't --

That's improper?
I think that it's -- to me, that

question shouldn't be asked, because I think it has -QUESTION:

9
10

objectionable.

11

question.

Well, in other words, it's

You can raise an objection to that

12

MS. VAN NESS:

13

QUESTION:

14

MS. VAN NESS:

Yes.

Under the Constitution.
I think it's doing -- it has the

15

same difficulties as the argument that was made on

16

summation in this case.

It's exactly the same.

17

QUESTION:

Ms. Van Ness --

18

QUESTION:

Because it impedes his constitutional

19

right.

20

Is that constitutional right impeded by cross-examining

21

him?

What about his constitutional right to testify.

22

MS. VAN NESS:

23

QUESTION:

Certainly not.

So you pay the price for exercising

24

that constitutional right.

25

to cross-examination.

If you testify, you're subject

42

1

MS. VAN NESS:

2

QUESTION:

But that goes back to --

If you're present at your trial,

3

you're subject to having the fact that you're present at

4

your trial being pointed out.
MS. VAN NESS:

5

Your Honor, that goes back to a

6

point I was trying to make earlier, which is that this --

7

the fact that the defendant was there is not evidence that

8

he tailored.

QUESTION:

9

12
13

Of course it isn't.

MS. VAN NESS:

10
11

The opportunity --

The question of whether he used

that -QUESTION:

Of course it isn't, but that's a

question for the jury.

14

MS. VAN NESS:

15

QUESTION:

It -- you know, it's a factor -So --

-- that would enable him to tailor,

16

and the prosecutor's just telling the jury, this is a

17

factor that would enable him to tailor, but take that into

18

account along with everything else.

19

MS. VAN NESS:

If the prosecutor has evidence

20

that the defendant has tailored his testimony, I am not

21

saying that he should not be allowed to use evidence.

22

can use it on cross, and --

23
24
25

QUESTION:

He

What sort of evidence would one ever

get that the person had tailored their testimony?
MS. VAN NESS:

Well, for example, if he'd made a
43

1

prior inconsistent statement, and he changed his story at

2

trial.
Now, again, this goes back to the fact that a

3
4

change in story could be based on a variety of

5

explanations.

6

heard the witnesses at trial.

7

be that he was given broad discovery rights, knew the

8

State's evidence very well before he got in there, and

9

used that.

One such explanation could be the defendant
Another explanation could

Another possibility is that he is -- well, so

10
11

there are several explanations for why he could have

12

changed his testimony, and listening to the witnesses is

13

only one explanation, and if you don't have evidence that

14

that's why he changed his story, I think it's unfair to

15

ask the jury to assume that he did.

16

QUESTION:

So the mere fact -- even the mere

17

fact that he changes his testimony is not adequate in your

18

view.

19

prosecutor during the trial would have to show that he

20

changed his testimony because he was sitting -- he was

21

sitting there and heard the witnesses?

22

You'd have to show that he -- somehow the

MS. VAN NESS:

I think -- yes, because this

23

explanation doesn't advance the case.

24

of the change that advances their case, not the

25

explanation for it, so to not risk them drawing an unfair
44

It's the evidence

1

conclusion, and to not burden the defendant's exercise of

2

his constitutional right, I think this argument should be

3

forbidden.
QUESTION:

4

What's the constitutional right?

I'm

5

having a problem to know how to decide this.

I counted

6

the word consistent appearing 11 times in a rather short

7

summation by the defense about half divided between my

8

client's story is consistent, the complaining witness'

9

story is not consistent.
The State of New York said that under those

10
11

circumstances, no rule of evidence in New York is

12

violated.

13

States says New York's rule of evidence there is wrong?

14

mean, don't we have to decide this on the basis of 11

15

appearances of the word consistency in a short closing

16

argument, and don't we have to take into account the fact

17

that under New York law of evidence, under those

18

circumstances, no rule of evidence is violated? -

19
20

Now, what in the Constitution of the United

MS. VAN NESS:

I'm not certain I follow your

question, Your Honor.

21

QUESTION:

Well, my question is, what is the

22

question before us?

23

violation of the law of evidence to make this comment, of

24

course his story's consistent, he sat there and heard the

25

witnesses -- that's the law in New York, all right.

If New York's law says it is not a

45

Now,

I

1

what part of the Constitution does that violate?
MS. VAN NESS:

2
3

QUESTION:

Ah.

I have -- I couldn't find -- New

York apparently just didn't say.
MS. VAN NESS:

6
7

Well, I don't believe that is the

law in New York.

4
5

Why?

They didn't discuss it.

Well, I don't think this

constitutional issue has been addressed -QUESTION:

8

No, no, the law of evidence, not --

MS. VAN NESS:
QUESTION:

10

Well --

The law of evidence in New York is

11

that under these circumstances no law of evidence is

12

violated.
MS. VAN NESS:

13
14

under the law of New York there was a violation.
QUESTION:

15
16

All right, then they made a mistake

about that.
QUESTION:

17
18

Well, I think it is -- I think

Well, why did the New York courts

affirm this conviction?
MS. VAN NESS:

1

Well, there were many, many, many

20

issues raised in the appellate division, and this one was

21

not specific -QUESTION:

22

Well, let's assume Justice Breyer is

23

right.

Let's assume Justice Breyer is right that this is

24

permitted under the law of New York.

25

answer to his question about the constitutional issue as
46

Then what is the

1

you would put it, precisely?
MS. VAN NESS:

2

Well, if this is permitted by the

3

law of evidence in the State of New York, then I think

4

that's an unconstitutional principle that this Court can

5

address.

6

QUESTION:

Because?

Look, I mean, what I'm

7

driving at is fairly simple.

I'm sure that the

8

prosecution would like a universal law that you could make

9

this comment even no matter what, just make it out of the

10

clear blue sky, and what I'm driving at is, the record

11

before us is not the clear blue sky, at least as I read

12

it, and I'm not using a doctrine of invited error, I'm

13

using a doctrine of no error.

14

MS. VAN NESS:

Well, in this particular case,

15

Your Honor, the prosecutor, as was specifically found by

16

the court of appeals, actually made an accusation of

17

tailoring against the defendant on the basis of the

18

exercise of the right without any evidentiary foundation

19

whatsoever.

20

QUESTION:

Good.

I've read the record.

21

they're wrong about that.

22

it uses the word consistent.

23

heard what I said.

24
25

MS. VAN NESS:

I think

I found 11 instances in which
I won't repeat myself.

You

Well, that the defendant's story

is consistent doesn't necessarily mean he used his
47

1

opportunity to hear the other witnesses -QUESTION:

2

Yes, I thought that was what you were

3

going to say.

I haven't been understanding Justice

4

Breyer's question.

5

see what telling a consistent story has anything to do

6

with whether you've heard the prior witnesses and

7

tailored.

8

contradicts the prior witnesses, or you can have a

9

consistent story that is in accord with prior witnesses.

You seem to understand it.

I don't

You can have a consistent story that

10

Consistency has nothing to do with whether you're

11

tailoring, does it?

12

MS. VAN NESS:

13

QUESTION:

No, because I think that's not --

He didn't say -- they didn't use the

14

word tailoring.

15

complicated factual story the lawyer says, look, my

16

client's been consistent, the complaining witness wasn't,

17

and what the prosecutor says is, sure, he sat here, why

18

wouldn't he be consistent?

19

I thought what they said was, in a very

MS. VAN NESS:

Well, the prosecutor went much

20

farther than that, Your Honor.

21

client received a great benefit and advantage the other

22

witnesses didn't have, and attributed his consistency to

23

the exercise of his right to be present.

24
25

QUESTION:

He went on to say that my

I suppose he would be consistent if

he had listened to himself testify.
48

1

(Laughter.)

2

QUESTION:

3

That would enable him to be

consistent.

4

QUESTION:

She didn't use the word --

5

QUESTION:

But I didn't understand that he was

6

listening to himself testify while he -QUESTION:

7

What she actually said was, use your

8

common sense.

You know, ladies and gentlemen, unlike the

9

other witnesses, he has a benefit, the benefit he has is,

10

he gets to sit here and listen to the testimony of the

11

other witnesses.

12

in response, I gather, to the defense lawyer saying

13

nonstop, my client's story was consistent, the complaining

14

witness wasn't.

That's -- all right.

I'll stop, because --

QUESTION:

15

Now, she said that

May I add one thing to that, because

16

it seems to me we're losing what the Second Circuit

17

decided.

18

dispositive opinion, it isn't a question of whether, but

19

when.

As I understand Judge -- Chief Judge Winters'

20

He narrowed his decision, the Second Circuit's

21

decision to the prosecutor's springing this for the very

22

first time on summation and distinguished and left

23

unanswered.

24

defendant would have a possibility of rebuttal -- but

25

there was no such statement made in the cross-examination.

Had it been brought up on cross, when the

49

1

It was reserved for when the prosecutor spoke last, and

2

that was all that the Second Circuit addressed, is this

3

proper to make on summation, and we're getting into cross-

4

examine.

5

explicitly did not decide.

6

That was an issue that the Second Circuit

MS. VAN NESS:

Precisely, Your Honor.

I was

7

addressing cross-examination, but I did want to -- I do

8

want to focus back on --

9

QUESTION:

Why does the constitutionality of

10

this conduct in -- under the Griffin analysis depend on

11

whether it was brought up on cross-examination or whether

12

it was urged on closing argument?

13

MS. VAN NESS:

Because if it's raised for the

14

first time in closing argument it's not -- it's mere

15

speculation, it's not evidence.

16

QUESTION:

I can't --

But that doesn't sound like a

17

constitutional argument.

18

say, the prosecutor shouldn't do that because it's unfair,

19

and Griffin isn't based on unfairness.

20

MS. VAN NESS:

That sounds like something you

Well, it's based on burdening a

21

constitutional right with no legitimate State interest

22

advanced by that.

23

QUESTION:

What about shifty eyes?

24

QUESTION:

Why couldn't your --

25

QUESTION:

What about shifty eyes?
50

Can you

1

bring that up in final argument, or you have to give him a

2

chance to respond to that by bringing it up in cross-

3

examination?

4

nervous tick or something.

I mean, he might say, you know, I have

5

MS. VAN NESS:

6

QUESTION:

Well --

Does the prosecutor have to bring

7

that up in cross-examine, or can he just say, ladies and

8

gentlemen of the jury, you saw the defendant testify here,

9

did you see the way his eyes darted around the room?

10

MS. VAN NESS:

11

QUESTION:

12

telling the truth.

13

to bring it up --

This looked like a man who was not
Can he not say that?

MS. VAN NESS:

14

The State --

I mean, he has

Your Honor, I think it's

15

fundamentally different.

16

the defendant's presence as evidence, just -- they're

17

saying, because he was there, you, jury, can infer that he

18

lied.

19
20

That -- if -- at least -QUESTION:

credibility.

Not as evidence.

MS. VAN NESS:

22

QUESTION:

24
25

It goes to his

It doesn't go to the substance of the crime.

21

23

The State here is seeking to use

Well, it --

It goes to whether he was an honest

witness, just as shifty eyes do.
MS. VAN NESS:

Well, what is the jury supposed

to consider in the deliberations room under those
51

1

circumstances if there's no supporting evidence?

2

prosecutor --

3

QUESTION:

The

Well, I think -- why aren't you

4

entitled -- why aren't you fully protected by an

5

instruction from the court, if you want to ask for it, say

6

ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this defendant has an

7

absolute right to be at the counsel table.

8

there to assist in the prosecution of his case.

9

fact that he's present alone you cannot hold against him.

He must be
The mere

10

Now, if you think he tailored his testimony, if you find

11

that, then that is relevant to determining his

12

credibility.

13

What's wrong with that instruction?

14

MS. VAN NESS:

Well, I don't think that

15

effectively cures the problem, because the prosecutor is

16

not merely commenting on his presence.

17

on the fact that he used his presence as a tool with which

18

to fabricate, and if there's no evidence --

19

QUESTION:

20

MS. VAN NESS:

They're commenting

Suppose he did.
Well, then -- then, if there's

21

proof of that, like any other impeachment evidence, then

22

the prosecutor is free to use that.

23

QUESTION:

All right.

Then there is nothing

24

wrong with the instruction as I gave it to you, that he

25

has a right to be present, the mere fact that he is
52

1

present cannot be held against him, if you think that he

2

used his presence in order to tailor his testimony, then

3

that -- then you may consider that.

4

Now, if you want that instruction, then I

5

suppose you can get it.

6

according --

7

MS. VAN NESS:

I'm not sure you'd want it,

I still don't think that the jury

8

is equipped to deal with this situation, because there is

9

no -- there's no -- if there's no evidence before them,

10

but they're being told that if you consider that the

11

evidence, that the defendant has used his opportunity to

12

be here to tailor, then you consider that. It's still

13

asking them to consider the --

14

QUESTION:

Well, don't you think that a jury is

15

entitled to consider the interest of every witness who

16

testifies, and the fact that certainly the defendant is

17

always an interested witness.

18

hook, and don't you think the jury can say, gosh, we

19

listened to what the defendant said, but after all, the

20

defendant doesn't want to be convicted, and can't the jury

21

say to itself, and also, the defendant sat there the whole

22

time and listened to everybody else.

23

The defendant wants off the

I think the jury can maybe reason from that in

24

deciding which witness' testimony they want to give the

25

greatest credibility.
53

MS. VAN NESS:

1

Well, how could the defendant

2

ever rebut that kind of speculation, though.

3

interested witness charge, at least -QUESTION:

4

With the

Well, the defendant has to -- if the

5

defendant chooses to testify, and many don't, but if the

6

defendant does, the defendant has to try to be as credible

7

as possible on the facts during the testimony, but I would

8

have thought that a jury could consider all of these

9

things in weighing who to believe.
MS. VAN NESS:

10

Well, again, the interest of the

11

witness is neutral in a sense, because not only does it

12

apply to everybody, but it is not perceived as a tool that

13

the defendant has in order to enable him to tell a better

14

lie.

15

interested you can't disbelieve him simply because of that

16

fact.

17

A defendant's interested or not, and if he's

QUESTION:

Ms. Van Ness, it seems to me what

18

your principle boils down to is, it's okay for the

19

prosecutor to do it if there is some -- enough evidence to

20

think that there was tailoring, but he can't make this

21

statement if there was not any evidence.

22

This is a very dangerous constitutional

23

principle, that the prosecutor cannot in his closing

24

statement invite the jury to make any factual

25

determinations, or credibility determinations that the
54

evidence will not support.

2

principle, that if the prosecutor goes beyond what the

3

evidence will support, the whole case can be reversed?

4

MS. VAN NESS:

5

QUESTION:

6

Is that a constitutional

Well, that --

Don't we give the jury a certain

amount of discretion to reject stupid arguments?
MS. VAN NESS:

7

Well, that would be a -- that

8

could be a due process violation which I am alleging

9

occurred here, and as the court of appeals found, but

10

the -- I'm sorry.
QUESTION:

11

I mean, you're just saying there's

12

not enough evidence in toto to prove that this defendant

13

was tailoring.

14

suggest the possibility of tailoring.

Therefore, the prosecutor could not

MS. VAN NESS:

15

I am suggesting that a prosecutor

16

can always make a tailoring argument in summation, a

17

tailoring argument in summation, if there is evidence to

18

support it.
QUESTION:

19
20

21

it.

Ah, if there is evidence to support

You condition it on that.
MS. VAN NESS:

Well, but what I'm getting at,

22

Your Honor, is I don't believe it's appropriate ever for

23

the prosecutor to tie that tailoring argument, which has

24

an evidentiary foundation, with the defendant's exercise

25

of his right to be present.
55

QUESTION:

1

So going back to Judge Winters' point

2

that Justice Ginsburg raised, if there had been a prior

3

inconsistent statement here and that had been brought out,

4

I take it you would agree that it would have been

5

perfectly proper, even only at the last minute, in closing

6

argument, for the prosecutor to make the tailoring

7

argument here.
The timing is not crucial to you, Judge Winters'

8
9

10

seeming suggestion that it was the fact that this didn't
surface --

11

MS. VAN NESS:

12

QUESTION:

Well --

-- this tailoring claim didn't

13

surface until the last minute in the prosecutor's closing

14

argument, when it was too late for them to respond, that

15

is not crucial, I take it, in your view.

16

MS. VAN NESS:

17

QUESTION:

Well --

If there had been a prior

18

inconsistent statement, the word tailoring and the

19

tailoring argument had never come up until the

20

prosecutor's closing argument, I take it on your view the

21

argument would have been proper for the prosecutor, is

22

that correct?

23
24
25

MS. VAN NESS:

Well, that would be a due process

violation, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Thank you, Ms. Van Ness.

Mr. Zwerling, you have 3 minutes left.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW ZWERLING

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

4

MR. ZWERLING:

Addressing the issue of the

5

insoluble ambiguity, or that in the absence of a

6

particularized showing of actual tailoring, that that

7

gives rise to an invitation to speculate, if the witness

8

in question who was not sequestered is not a defendant,
the court can give a jury instruction that they can

10

consider that fact, and to consider the effects, if any,

11

that that nonsequestration had on that particular witness.

12

So what respondent in the Second Circuit are

13

positing is a possible scenario in which there is more

14

than one nonsequestered witness in addition to the

15

defendant, and that a jury instruction can be given that

16

the jury can consider as to those witnesses the effects,

17

if any, nonsequestration had on their reliability, but no

18

such instruction would be given as to a defendant, and

1

that under those circumstances the jury's going to go into

20

that deliberations room saying, well, I guess we can't

21

hold that against the defendant, we can only hold that

22

against the credibility --

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Zwerling, we're going so far

24

beyond what the Second Circuit decided.

25

about instructions at all.

They didn't talk

They spoke only about what was
57

1

proper for the prosecutor to do in light of the Sixth

2

Amendment and Fifth Amendment.

3

MR. ZWERLING:

Addressing particularly summation

4

comment, the same parallel holds true.

That would mean

5

that there would be a scenario in which a defense attorney

6

can stand up, as was done in this particular case, blister

7

the credibility of the prosecution witnesses based upon

8

their exposure to one another, or if they were

9

nonsequestered witness, could blister the credibility of

10

that witness based upon the fact that they weren't

11

sequestered, and then a prosecutor would have to stand up

12

and would be handcuffed and not be able to say anything

13

based upon the fact that another nonsequestered witness,

14

the defendant, was also sitting in that courtroom, and I

15

also want to --

16

QUESTION:

Well, I'm not --

17

QUESTION:

Well, do you --

18

QUESTION:

I'm not sure that that's right, given

19

the Second Circuit's follow-up decision, in which they

20

pointed out that when that happened the judge repeatedly

21

offered to give a curative instruction simply informing

22

the jury that the defendant had not only a right but an

23

obligation to be there.

24
25

Defendant rejected that curative instruction,
and the Second Circuit said, too bad, but then the
58

1

distinction between the defendant, who has a

2

constitutional right to be there and a statutory-

3

obligation under New York law to be there, that

4

distinction is presented to the jury, so they get the

5

whole picture of the difference between the defendant, his

6

right and obligation, and other witnesses.

7

MR. ZWERLING:

But so long as the jury is

8

informed that they can consider that fact as it bears upon

9

the defendant's credibility, clearly, you know, additional

10

language in an instruction alerting to the jury that the

11

defendant must be there, for example, under New York

12

law - -
