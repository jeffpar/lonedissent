CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Olive.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK E. OLIVE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. OLIVE:

8

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
There is an intolerable risk in this case that

11

the jurors erroneously and mistakenly believed that in

12

sentencing the petitioner, they had a duty to sentence him

13

to death upon the finding of an aggravating circumstance.

14

This violates the Eighth Amendment and the petitioner

15

seeks resentencing .

16

Five facts compel this conclusion.

17

First, the jurors promised to do two things:

18

one, sentence according to the instructions; and two, come

19

back and ask the court what the instructions meant if they

20

didn't understand them.

21

Number two, the actual sentencing instructions

22

were quite short.

23

199 and 200 of the JA and are two pages long .

24
25

The pertinent instructions are at pages

Number three, the jurors had these short
instructions read to them in court.

They heard these

Number four, the jurors then took these short

Buchanan was upheld.

It didn ' t say in the context of Buchanan.

15

MR. OLIVE:

Well, Chief Justice Rehnquist , as I

16

read Buchanan, there is a footnote 4 in which you write

17

that the instruction which would be unconstitutional would

18

be a strained -

s-t-r-a-i-n-e-d

19

of the statute.

And then after that footnote, the Court

20

goes on to say, were we concerned -- and that's where the

21

Boyde citation is

23

happened at trial -- ln this context under Boyde is

ground.

4

MR. OLIVE:

It

It's an alternative

Well, my reading of the case is --

5

is the same as your reading of the case, that there was an

6

application of Boyde.

7

to me that if a Juror had this understanding, the strained

8

understanding, of the instruction, the Court would

9

unanimously condemn it.

But also the fourth footnote says

And our argument is that these

10

jurors had -- or there's a risk -- had this strained

11

misunderstanding of the -- of the instruction.

MR. OLIVE:

14

Well, how broad a rule are

The rule in this case we feel is

we're not seeking a rule.

We think it's

15

compelled

16

compelled by Eddings, and yes, the rule that we're asking

17

for is a capital case rule.

18

QUESTION:

And is it that whenever the 1ury asks

19

-- sends a note to the judge asking a question that the

20

judge can't refer them to an instruction; he has to

21

respond directly to the question?

MR. OLIVE:

MR. OLIVE:

25

Not at all.

Then how -- how do you differ that?

and Eddings.

We have parsed this instruction.

2

thought about it, and we have thought about it enough to

3

-- to write out a question and to highlight what we think

4

our options are.

5

what's -- what are we doing here?

That's far different from, you know,

QUESTION:

6

We have

Well, I think that may be reading

7

more into the question than is justified.

I think it may

8

be a reasonably common practice for trial judges, when

9

faced with a question from a jury about an instruction, to

10

refer the jurors back to a particular instruction if the

11

trial judge thinks that it's -- that it properly answers

12

the question.

And maybe they just haven't focused on that

13

aspect of it.

Is that not a practice that occurs not

14

infrequently in trial courts?

15

MR. OLIVE:

It -- it occurs not infrequently,

16

primarily in non -capital cases, and it may, in fact, occur

17

in some capital cases.

18

cases that are illustrative there are no -- none of them

19

are capital cases.
QUESTION:

20

The amicus brief, which says the

Do we -- do we also look at the

21

surrounding circumstances , the arguments of both counsel

22

and any other instructions that are included in the

23

packet?

MR. OLIVE:

I think that once the Jury or the

sentencer comes out and illustrates what they're thinking,

1

then the surrounding circumstances, which are so important

2

in a Boyde context when you're trying to figure out what

3

they might have been thinking, carries less weight.

4

think the overall content --

5

QUESTION :

But it may carry some weight .

I

I'm

6

concerned that in this case both the attorney for the

7

defendant and the prosecutor made clear duri ng their

8

closing argument s that the jury was free to impose a life

9

sentence if they wished, despite finding an aggravating

10
11

circumstance.
MR. OLIVE:

And -- and the sentencing judge in

12

Eddings had a statute -- and we presume he understood it

13

-- that said any circumstances can be admitted and any

14

circumstances could be considered.

15

Eddings was that judge's comment -- offhanded some would

16

argue , or controlling others would argue -- that he

17

believed he couldn't or might not be able to consider

18

certain mitigating circumstances.

19

context of not argument, but a record full of mitigating

20

circumstances on a statute that he was presumed to

21

understand.

22

reasonable argument could be made that that judge was JUSt

23

making an offhanded comment .

QUESTION:

2

MR. OLIVE:

And the reason that it ought not to

D-P-A , or AEDPA, has as it's policy concern or .. or

recognition that State courts that grapple with Federal

constitutional issues ought to be rewarded or certainly

7

not punished for their good faith efforts to enforce the

8

Federal Constitution by looking at the legal landscape and

9

applying the law.

And when you have a decision from a

10

State court which doesn't reflect that struggle, which is

11

simply a summary denial, then you don't have an

12

adjudication or an opinion to which deference ought

I'm surprised you call it a summary

First, let me deal with the Buchanan holding and

upholding the validity of the model jury instruction that

12

was given verbatim in this case somehow was something less

13

than an unqualified holding.

14

talks about that the instruction was ambiguous but not

15

wrong, and he refers to this ambiguity being recognized by

16

the dissenters in Buchanan .

17

Counsel today, for example,

But in the Fourth Circuit, after Buchanan had

18

Mr. Anderson, may I back you up a

The

instruction today on mitigation is very clear.

It says

13

that even if the commonwealth had proved beyond reasonable

doubt the existence of an aggravating circumstance, the

15

jury must, nonetheless, consider the mitigating

16

circumstances and weigh that against the aggravator,

precisely what was lacking in this case.

18

understand your argument when you say this instruction was

enough, but for you to say that it went beyond what today

would be told to a Virginia Jury I think is quite wrong.

existence of an aggravating circumstance in determining

14

the appropriate punishment, you should consider any

evidence presented of circumstances which do not justify

extenuate or reduce the degree of moral culpability and

punishment.

what that means.

QUESTION:

I mean, does the judge have more of

an obligation to explain it than another juror?
MR. ANDERSON:

9

I -- I think that the short

answer is I -

if -- if the instruction has been upheld as

11

adequate, I think the -- the judge, as a matter of

take from this case is that we know from Buchanan that

QUESTION:

13

No, but you basically -- if I

QUESTION:

What I'm -Well -- let's go back to Justice

3

Breyer's hypothetical.

4

it, that when the jury makes it clear beyond peradventure

that some of its members do not understand a word which is

crucial to the instruction, it does not necessarily follow

that the judge has got to explain that to the -- to the

jurors who are having the difficulty.
MR. ANDERSON:

I don't think that it invariably

would require it under any and all circumstances.

Well, how -- what are the

circumstances in which we decide we'll play roulette and

13

-- and take a chance that a juror will return a verdict

14

using a term that the juror does not understand?
MR. ANDERSON:

15

I think we have to -- I've given

17

that flatly evinces its misunderstanding of its obligation

to consider the mitigating evidence.

Do you agree with that as the test?
That's -- in this case clearly

I don't know why you're

5

not willing to grasp the bull by the horns and say that

6

there is -- once -- once an instruction has been found

7

clear, there is no obligation to clarify it any further.

8

Indeed, I would think that the term that a jury most often

9

doesn't understand is beyond a reasonable doubt, and I bet

10

they come in with questions about that all the time.

11

as you know, that is a mine field and any judge would be

12

out of his mind if he did anything except read back the

13

State formulary instruction as to what beyond a reasonable

14

doubt means, rather than ad lib a response to that

difficult question.
