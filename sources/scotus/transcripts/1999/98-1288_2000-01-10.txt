ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES L. DeANO

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. DeANO:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The question on which this Court granted the

11
12

petition for writ of certiorari in this case is whether

13

the Equal Protection Clause gives rise to a cause of

14

action on behalf of a class of one where that claimant

15

does not allege membership in any class or group, but

16

asserts that vindictiveness motivated the government to

17

treat her differently than others similarly situated.
QUESTION:

18

Mr. DeAno, let me ask you a question

19

or two about this so-called class of one.

20

class of one, or were there five people or so involved in

21

the suit?

22

MR. DeANO:

Was it really a

I think the facts of the complaint

23

could give rise to a class of five.

However, the cause of

24

action was brought under this vindictive action,

25

class-of-one type of equal protection claim, so I know

2

that there's an argument in this case that there is
QUESTION:

Yes, well, it wasn't in fact a class

3

of one, and when has this Court ever said that the Equal

4

Protection Clause only addresses classes as opposed to

5

individuals?

6

7
8

9
10
11

Have we ever said that?

MR. DeANO:

The case that we cite -- no, not

directly, this Court has not said that.
QUESTION:

And why should we?

I mean, if the

city wants to single out one citizen for some irrational
action, why isn't that citizen protected?
MR. DeANO:

The citizen is protected if that

12

class is drawn for a constitutionally impermissible

13

reason, and we submit that vindictiveness is not a

14

constitutionally impermissible reason, and really what

15

it's looking into is the distinction between --

16

QUESTION:

I don't even understand the

17

vindictiveness point.

18

Olech, we won't hook you up to city water unless you give

19

us 50 feet of land for a street, and every other person in

20

the city, they say, fine, we'll hook you up, give us 5

21

feet, but to her they say 50 feet, now, what does

22

vindictiveness have to do with it at all?

23

there no equal protection claim for Ms. Olech?

MR. DeANO:

I mean, if the city says to Ms.

I mean, is

We submit that if there is an equal

protection claim, it is not under this Esmail-type theory,

and then

additional 50 feet in your example was constitutionally

was.

It doesn't matter what the reason

Don't you have to treat citizens equally when

10

hooking them up to city water?

11

MR. DeANO:

Well, I would look at this Court's

12

case of Snowden v. Hughes, where the Court said that

13

simply differential treatment, even if it violates State

14

law, and in this case village policy, it is not a

15

violation of the Equal Protection Clause unless it is done

16

for a constitutionally impermissible reason.

17

QUESTION:

Now --

Mr. DeAno, supposing that in this

18

case they asked 50 feet of Mrs. Olech's property and asked

19

only 10 feet from people whose property was

20

indistinguishable from Mrs. Olech, do you say that that

21

would not be any sort of an equal protection claim?

22

23

MR. DeANO:

If it was done for an impermissible,

constitutionally impermissible --

When is it --

All the Constitution says is, you shall

MR. DeANO:

That's

Justice Scalia, I would point to the

Snowden case where the Court said, simply differential

treatment is not a violation of --

rational basis for the difference.

MR. DeANO:

QUESTION:

12

13
14

Well, of course not, if there's a

And -It becomes constitutionally

impermissible when there is no rational basis.
MR. DeANO:

And that's what we're arguing in

this case, that --

15

QUESTION:

Oh, it's a perfectly rational basis.

16

We want an additional 40 feet.

17

MR. DeANO:

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. DeANO:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. DeANO:

We're greedy.

Well --

If -It's perfectly rational, you see.
Well, if the rational basis is to

22

serve a legitimate government objective, for example, in

23

this instance to upgrade and improve an existing road,

24

then we submit that the question should be, if it's an

equal protection claim it should fall under traditional

equal protection analysis, with the -QUESTION:

2

Mr. DeAno, one problem I have with

3

that answer is, how do we get even to know what the

purpose of the government was when this case is tossed out

5

on a

the face of the complaint, and the complaint doesn't say

7

anything about, they wanted to widen the road.

2(b)(6) motion and all we're supposed to look at is

MR. DeANO:

8

9

Well, I think as the district court

found, the complaint alleges that the reason that the

10

village sought the additional, and I think it's in this

11

case

12

this road.

8 feet, was so that it could improve and dedicate

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. DeANO:

Did the -- the complaint said that?
The complaint alleged that the

5

reason they sought the additional space was so that they

6

could, I believe, pave and complete the road with

7

sidewalks and public utilities, and that's what the

8

district court found to be a legitimate purpose.

20

We submit that if these facts give rise to an
equal protection claim -QUESTION:

We don't have the -- do we have the

complaint?

QUESTION:

1

And where is the part where the

2

plaintiff sets out that the State's -- that the village's

3

reason --

4

MR. DeANO:

At page 9 of the Joint Appendix, and

5

it's allegation number 25, where it's alleged that they

6

sought the property so that they could dedicate the public

7

roadway and construct pavement, public utilities --

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. DeANO:

10

Yes, thank you.
Okay.

Our position is not that no single individual

11

can ever state an equal protection claim when they've been

12

singled out for improper treatment.

13

Esmail doctrine coming from the Seventh Circuit

14

essentially says that what we look to first is the

15

government's motive, and our position is that motive need

16

not be delved into if the ultimate objective or purpose is

17

legitimate.

18

QUESTION:

Our point is that the

But you would agree, then, that there

19

may be a claim stated by an individual who is not

20

otherwise a member of a class if the individual states

21

that the differential treatment is not rationally related

22

to any legitimate governmental purpose.

23

that formulation?

MR. DeANO:

Yes.

Do you agree with

Under Snowden I agree that if

it's a -- the phrase used in Snowden, if it is purposeful

1

and intentional discrimination, I think that looks into

2

whether they've been singled out for reasons that the

3

Constitution has found to be admissible.

4

QUESTION:

Well, supposing -- again, let's have

5

the 50-foot and 10-foot examples, that from Mrs. Olech

6

they want 50 feet, from people identically situated they

7

want 10 feet, and it simply is a result of a goof in the

8

City Clerk's office.

9

nonetheless that's the way it comes out.

No one had it in for Mrs. Olech, but
Does the fact

10

that it was a mistake rather than a conscious thing make

11

the equal protection claim disappear?
MR. DeANO:

12

I believe so.

I don't believe that

13

you can commit an equal protection violation through

14

error, omission, mistake.

15

Snowden, an intentional and purposeful discrimination.
QUESTION:

16

I think there has to be, under

There is certainly an intentional

17

difference in treatment.

18

get 50 feet from one person and only 10 feet from another.

19

Isn't that enough of a -- you say that's not enough of an

20

intent?

21

MR. DeANO:

They're intentionally trying to

Intent versus motive, if the intent

22

is to take 50 feet, then certainly they treated her

23

differently than others --

QUESTION:

MR. DeANO:

Right.

from them.

2

QUESTION:

Right.

3

MR. DeANO:

4

QUESTION:

That's not enough, according to you?

5

MR. DeANO:

Well, that may state a traditional

However --

6

equal protection claim, but then the question for the

7

Court would be, is there a rational basis for this, and we

8

submit that this complaint alleges a rational basis for

9

why they asked for an additional 18 feet in this case.
QUESTION:

10

No, but you say it alleges a rational

11

basis because establishing roads is a governmental

12

objective.

MR. DeANO:

13
14
15
16
17

Is that your answer?
Establishing roads and also for the

purpose -QUESTION:

Well, what about the rational basis

for the differential treatment?
MR. DeANO:

The differential treatment is the

18

beginning of the analysis.

19

treatment, I think then you look to whether there's a

20

rational basis for that.

21

QUESTION:

Once you find the differential

In other words, your theory is that

22

the government can treat people in any otherwise

23

unjustifiably differential way so long as in isolation it

24

has a legitimate objective for treating each individual in

25

the way the individual is treated?

1

In other words, if the government says, well, I

2

think we'll take 10 feet from this property owner, 25 feet

3

from the property owner next door, and 50 feet from the

4

property owner next door to him, in each instance we're

5

going to take this land because we want to establish

6

streets, and I take it your argument is that so long as in

7

each instance they want to establish streets, the fact

8

that they are intentionally differentiating in the amount
of land taken is irrelevant.

10

MR. DeANO:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. DeANO:

That -Is that your argument?
No.

That situation may give rise to

13

an equal protection claim.

14

would be whether the Court can find a conceivable rational

15

basis for why the government asked for 10 feet in one

16

instance, 25 feet in another.

17

QUESTION:

18

Okay.

However, then the question

In other words, a rational

basis for the difference in treatment?

1

MR. DeANO:

Yes.

20

QUESTION:

Okay.

21

QUESTION:

Why isn't the complaint alleging --

22

it may not be right, but it alleges a difference.

It

23

says, from us they wanted 66 feet to build a road.

24

everybody else in the town they wanted 15 feet, which

25

isn't enough to build the road, and there's no basis for

1

this distinction.

That's what I took it as saying.

2

MR. DeANO:

3

QUESTION:

4
5

The complaint alleges those facts.
All right.

So how, then, can you say

that on its face the complaint doesn't state a claim?
MR. DeANO:

Under the Esmail theory, where is --

6

where the Court says to look at motive before you look at

7

anything else, that's what we're saying, that that may be

8

a traditional equal protection claim.

9

QUESTION:

You may be right or wrong about that,

10

I don't know.

The -- but we took the case, I take it, to

11

decide whether there was a -- one person could state an

12

equal protection claim, and the first thing I read is that

13

this isn't one person, it's five.

14

MR. DeANO:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

Well -So now should we get into this much

more difficult question about motive and so forth?
MR. DeANO:

Not whether simply one person can

18

ever state an equal protection claim, but whether that one

19

person can state that they were singled out because of the

20

government's motive, vindictiveness.

21

QUESTION:

Well, suppose that they're singled

22

out because of the government's motive, and it also

23

happens that there's no rational basis, which I take it is

24

what Judge Posner said.

25

stated a claim where the only reason that anybody could

He said -- he said, they have

give as far as the complaint's concerned for this

distinction is hatred or malice or some absurd state of

mind.

MR. DeANO:

QUESTION:

I'll get his exact words, if you

want.

8

Well --

MR. DeANO:

Well, in answer to that question, I

think that --

9

QUESTION:

He says, if it refuses to perform

10

this obligation for one of the residents for no reason --

11

no reason.

12

then it would violate the Equal Protection Clause.

13

No reason -- other than a baseless hatred,

MR. DeANO:

And under traditional equal

14

protection analysis, the question then would be for the

15

Court to search the record to see if there is any

16

conceivable rational basis.

Well, here we have the record.

It's

basis is that in this instance they had a nondedicated

2

MR. DeANO:

No --

3

(Laughter.)

4

QUESTION:

-- would that make it all right?

5

MR. DeANO:

No, it's not that if hatred is

baseless, it's if the act, the legitimate -- the goal of

7

the government.

8

they were trying to do here was legitimate.

9

In this instance, we submit that what

QUESTION:

10

Whether their

Why, then, shouldn't you read this

11

complaint to say, they wanted 33 feet to widen the road,

12

but everybody else, they wanted only 15 feet.

13

they want 33, they exercise their power of eminent domain

14

and they pay us for the difference between 33 and 15.

15

that's what the complaint is saying, we're supposed to

16

read it liberally, then the 12(b)(6) dismissal is

17

improper, because the complaint would not have on its

18

face --

19

MR. DeANO:

Fine, if

If

On that set of facts, if they

20

alleged a traditional equal protection claim, the next

21

question would be, is there a conceivable rational basis

22

for what was done, and that's why we point, and why the

23

district court pointed to paragraph 25, which alleged that

24

although the respondent is saying the reason they did this

25

is because they're retaliating against me, they also

1

supplied an allegation that explained another basis,

2

another reason why the village wanted that 18 feet.

3

QUESTION:

But wouldn't that reason still be

4

inadequate if everybody else was either not asked for the

5

33, or paid for the difference?
MR. DeANO:

6

I don't think so, because the

7

reason -- if nobody else was asked for 33 feet, that would

8

create the classification.

9

created, then the question becomes, what was the

But once the classification is

So that's where we think paragraph 25

13

Was there a conceivable

It has to be a rational basis, not

14

for taking the 33 feet, but a rational basis for treating

15

this person different from other people, right?

16

MR. DeANO:

I agree with that, and the reason

17

that she was asked for the 33 feet is why she was treated

18

differently.

QUESTION:

the need for the 33 feet from other people?

any easement granted to any governmental body for the use

of any portion of it, so -QUESTION:

12

find out whether one person who was not otherwise a member

13

of a class can state an equal protection claim, and I

14

think perhaps we're at the point where everybody is

agreeing that the answer is yes, and the argument now is

whether, in response to that claim, it can be found on

2

have to get into that.

3

MR. DeANO:

And that's not the theory, though,

4

that the respondent brought this case under, and the

5

petition that we filed asked not only that the Court

6

consider whether a class of one could ever file an equal

7

protection claim, it's whether a class of one who is

8

alleging that the class was created by vindictiveness,

9

because vindictiveness has not been a constitutionally

10

protected interest.

11

QUESTION:

But if one doesn't need to find

12

vindictiveness in order to say that a complaint like the

13

States have claimed for relief under the Equal Protection

14

Clause, it seems to me we wouldn't get into the Esmail

15

question at all.

16

MR. DeANO:

That's correct, but then if it was

17

under traditional equal protection analysis we believe

18

that the district court took the right approach and looked

19

for a rational basis for what the government did, and

20

that's why the case was dismissed in the district court.

21

QUESTION:

Have we ever said -- has this Court

22

ever said that in the abstract there's some free-floating

23

duty for the government always to act rationally?

haven't said that.

first thing you do is look at an allegation of motive, and

3

if the motive is alleged to be improper, you don't have to

5

QUESTION:

Yes, but an allegation of motive like

that can also be construed as saying there was no other

rational basis that can explain this except that motive,

so it's really the functional equivalent of an allegation

that there was no rational basis for what you did, which

tends to be consistent with the notion that the city

When the -- what would give rise to

This is a basis that we invent in our own

Okay, conceivable, any imaginable by

QUESTION:

10

Can you -- does that carry as far as

saying, yeah, we conceived it, but it has been shown on
this record that that was indeed not the basis?
MR. DeANO:

11

If it can be conceived, then there's

12

no reason to look into the record for why they might --

why that motive might not have been the correct motive.

QUESTION:

So this is a tempest in a teapot, is

that is not the theory that has been pled in this case.

11

The theory that has been pled is what our argument is

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We have explained in our brief why we believe

22

this is not an appropriate case for resolving the class-

23

of-one issue, but if the Court reaches the question, it

24

should hold that a class-of-one claim is subject to the

25

same analysis as other equal protection claims.

That means that unless there is a fundamental

1

2

right, or a suspect classification involved, rational

basis review applies, and under rational basis review the

relevant inquiry is an objective one into whether there is

QUESTION:

What if they had a class of litigants

They actually did, in their

factual allegations, allege that the basis for the

differently?

17

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, in that case,

18

when you have a First Amendment right at issue, the

19

sequence of events is dictated by this Court's decision in

20

Doyle, which says that the plaintiff has the burden to

21

show that a motivating factor in the decision was the

22

exercise of First Amendment rights and at that point, if

23

the plaintiff establishes that initial burden, then the

24

burden shifts to the defendant to show that the same

the only question is whether there is a conceivable

the decision.

So under the Doyle approach, my

hypothetical, would a court say, yes, this is a prima

10 feet, and the respondent has come up with a perfectly

13

good explanation of why, but we also find that the motive

14

for doing it was not the rational basis, that they simply

wanted to get this person because they filed a lawsuit,

and kind of dug up the rational basis later.

But you have to get beyond the

dismissal of the complaint to reach that.

That's correct.

Le Sage was hardly a dismissal of the

MR. GORNSTEIN:

That's correct.

I'm just

talking about a hypothetical scenario where there's a

First Amendment claim raised, and then it would be -- it

would usually require a trial to determine whether, in

fact, the actual -- the defendant would have taken the

11

same action in any event.

Let me --

13

QUESTION:

Should we begin our opinion in this

14

case by saying there is no constitutional right for

15

similarly situated persons to be treated equally under the

16

law?

Is that our opening line?

17

MR. GORNSTEIN:

There is a constitutional right

18

for people who are being treated equally -- who are

19

similarly situated, in fact, to be treated equally, but

20

how the Court approaches that question depends on whether

21

there's a suspect classification or a fundamental right

22

involved.

relevant inquiry is, is there any conceivable rational

24

basis for treating differently plaintiff from the persons

Is that necessary to reduce the

number of suits filed in Federal court, to reduce the

That is the --

Are we compromising the basic

principle by saying that?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

No, because I think the basic

principle that the Court has established is -- under

only against those classifications, or those different --

end.

QUESTION:

What about in every case of

defamation, libel, intentional torts committed by a State

officer, breach of contract, where let's assume the

State's wrong in all those cases?

9

Now, those are all illegal activities, so I

10

don't know what the rational basis would be.

11

every one of those actions become an Equal Protection

12

Clause action?

13

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Now, does

No, because there are two

components to the equal protection cause of action.

For example, in this case let's put aside the First

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Yes.

In certain limited

MR. GORNSTEIN:

The possible explanation would

be that the city has a policy for some reason that it does

MR. GORNSTEIN:

That's what the

I would not say that, Justice

Ginsburg.

I think the complaint can state the facts that

show that they are apparently being treated differently

from other -- others who are similarly situated.

Were it

not for the one paragraph in the complaint the petitioner

mentioned which suggested a possible rational basis, the

complaint clearly would have stated a claim in our view,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. WIMMER

18

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

21

MR. WIMMER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Before I get into the merits of the arguments

22

that have been made on behalf of the Village of

23

Willowbrook,

24

questions are properly before this Court in this case.

25

I'd like to address the matter of what

As the Court is aware,

there were two questions

1

raised in the petition for a writ of certiorari, the first

2

being whether the Equal Protection Clause gives rise to a

3

cause of action on behalf of a class of one where the

4

plaintiff has not alleged membership in a vulnerable

5

group, but rather that ill will caused the government to

6

treat her differently from others similarly situated.

7

The second question was whether the government

8

conduct alleged in Mrs. Olech's amended complaint meets

9

the standard to state a cause of action on behalf of a

10

class of one, assuming that the Equal Protection Clause

11

protects such individuals.

12

Now, this Court in this case granted certiorari

13

limited to question one, and what that means, I believe,

14

is that arguments that fall within the scope of question

15

two are not properly before this Court because this Court

16

has in effect denied certiorari on question two, and we've

17

cited the case of Missouri v. Jenkins from this Court,

18

where there was a limited grant of certiorari on one of

19

two questions, and in that case, which was a school

20

desegregation case, the State made arguments that really

21

fell within the scope of the question which had not

22

been -- on which certiorari had not been granted, and this

23

Court said that those questions would not be considered.

24

4

them.

5

That's not to say question 2 is before the

MR. WIMMER:

I don't know that they can be

6

totally separated.

I know in Missouri v. Jenkins the

7

second question was whether the tax increase ordered by

8

the district court in the school desegregation case

9

violated Federal-State comity.

The first question was

10

whether the remedy was too broad, and when the State tried

11

to argue that it violated Federal-State comity because the

12

remedy was too broad, this Court indicated that that

13

wouldn't be within the scope of the grant.

14

I think in this case when the village argues

15

that Mrs. Olech's specific amended complaint failed to

16

sufficiently allege that there was not a rational basis

17

related to a legitimate government interest, that doesn't

18

go to whether the Equal Protection Clause protects a class

19

of one.

20

particular amended complaint meets the standard to state a

21

cause of action for violation of the Equal Protection

22

Clause, assuming that that clause protects such

23

individuals.

25

That falls within question 2, whether this

they're a class of five, at least, so wouldn't it be a

2

totally hypothetical advisory opinion to answer question 1

3

in the context of a case that doesn't raise it?

4

MR. WIMMER:

Well, I don't think it would be an

5

advisory opinion necessarily, because although there are

6

five people involved, I think the principal the class of

7

one -- the distinction is between a class of one and a

8

vulnerable group.

Whether there's two, or five, or one, I

think the same considerations would apply if it's not a
10
11
12

vulnerable group, as stated by the village.

Then why didn't you include the

theory that Mr. Deano suggested may have been okay, that

20

is, it was retaliation for exercise of their First

21

Amendment right to sue the village?

22

MR. WIMMER:

Well, Your Honor, I did state in

1

S. Zimmer differently from other property owners in the

2

Village of Willowbrook by demanding the 33-foot easements

3

and the 66-foot dedicated street as a condition of the

4

extension of the water main because of the ill will

5

generated by the State court lawsuit, and in an attempt to

6

control storm water drainage in the vicinity to the

7

detriment of plaintiff Grace Olech and Thaddeus Olech and

8

other plaintiffs in the State court lawsuit by the use of

9

ditches and swales along Tennessee Avenue.

10

So when the village says that the complaint

11

alleges that they wanted the 33 feet for all these good

12

purposes, that's not what it alleges.

13

made those demands out of ill will caused by the lawsuit.

14

It alleges they

The paragraph cited by the village simply says

15

they sent the proposed easement which would give them the

16

right to do all those things, but the complaint does not

17

allege that that is why the village made those demands.

18

QUESTION:

What if we had a somewhat different

19

situation here, where we're not talking about the demand

20

for easement dedication, but whether the village is going

21

to contract with a particular person, or take bids from

22

various persons to do the paving in this area, and the

23

village says, well, one person we're not going to contract

24

with is X, because X has a reputation for suing everybody,

advantage of his right to petition,

under the First Amendment?

3

MR. WIMMER:

Is that impermissible

Well, if the lawsuit that was

4

brought was meritorious, I think it would be.

I think if

5

there had been a lot of -- and I think about the cases

6

cited by the government in this case, California Motor

7

Transport, and the other cases cited by the government

8

which indicate that if the lawsuit is not -- doesn't have
probable cause, or if it's a harassing lawsuit, or

10

something like that, then the First Amendment implications

11

aren't there.

12

In this case, the State court lawsuit, we

13

prevailed and got a judgment against the Village of

14

Willowbrook, so --

15

QUESTION:

So you say that the First Amendment

16

does protect someone who the county or the village simply

17

doesn't want to deal with because they have a propensity

18

to litigate at the drop of a hat.

1

sometimes they lose.

20

MR. WIMMER:

Sometimes they win,

Well, I think if -- it would come

21

down to what the propensity to litigate in cases that are

22

not valid, that would probably be a proper consideration

23

for the village to take into account.

24

happened here, though, because the one case was a valid

case and went to judgment.

QUESTION:

What was your theory?

If we go to

2

this other issue, I can see two situations.

3

plaintiff says, there is no rational basis conceivable,

and they're motivated by ill will.

5

plaintiff says, they had a brilliant reason, a perfect

6

reason, an outstanding reason.

7

motivated by ill will in reality.

8

9

MR. WIMMER:

1, a

Situation 2 is, the

However, they were
Now, does this case

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

We

10

alleged in the complaint that the decision was -- and this

11

is on page 10 -- wholly -- strike that -- irrational and

12

wholly arbitrary, and we've also alleged that it was based

13

on ill will and I think that, as Judge Posner said in the

14

court of appeals opinion for the Seventh Circuit, the

15

tincture of ill will will not render government action

16

unconstitutional if it would have happened anyway.

17

What we have here is a situation where it was

18

irrational because the village attorney admitted that they

19

didn't need a 66-foot street dedication to install and

20

maintain a water main, and they didn't demand it of other

21

people in the village.

22

With respect to the argument that Mrs. Olech's

23

situation is somehow unique, there's no basis in the

24

complaint to conclude that that is the case, and that

25

there are not other nondedicated streets in the village.

Under Hishon v. King & Spaulding this Court is to

2

construe -- or all courts are to construe complaints

favorably to the plaintiff and reach all reasonable

4

inferences in favor of the plaintiff, and what the village

5

is asking you to do is the exact contrary, to assume that

6

this was the only dedicated street and make conclusions on

7

that basis.
QUESTION:

8
9

Well now, if a complaint were to

allege that the city took some -- singled out the

10

plaintiff for some negative action solely because the city

11

didn't like the person for some reason, the mayor hated

12

her, and it turns out, though, that there is a perfectly

13

rational basis that the Court can think of for the mayor's

14

action, is there a lawsuit just because the mayor, in his

15

heart of hearts, hated the plaintiff and wanted that

16

outcome, even though we can derive a perfectly rational

17

basis?
MR. WIMMER:

18

Probably not, Judge, although this

19

Court did say in the City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living

a politically unpopular group, are not legitimate State

whether the particular amended complaint in this case

I think you know what's bothering us,

7

that if we accept your theory, then in those thousands,

tens of thousands of zoning decisions where local

the zoning process.

And we simply are concerned about

MR. WIMMER:

Your Honor, I think there's

sufficient protection from municipalities or government in

16

the fact that the plaintiff has to show that there was no

legitimate government interests for the conduct.

MR. WIMMER:

That's correct.
So in this respect you're in

agreement with the government's theory of the case?
MR. WIMMER:

MR. WIMMER:

As a matter of fact, at the

preserve another issue for appellate review.

2

With respect to the question on which the Court

3

granted certiorari, I think it's important to recall that

4

governments derive their power from the consent of the

5

governed, and that the legitimacy of government action is

6

based on that.

7

is set forth in the written Constitution, and I think in

8

interpreting the language of the Constitution, the

9

language of that grant, it's important to adhere to the

10

language that the people have chosen to use, especially

11

when construing a protection that the people saw fit to

12

secure for themselves, and that no court should engraft

13

limitations on the application of a protection like that

14

that the people didn't see fit to put in it, because then

15

what would happen to the consent of the governed, and the

16

legitimacy of the exercise of government power?.

As Justice Story said in Martin v. Hunter's

18

Lessee, which I cited in my brief, the words are to be

19

taken in their natural and obvious sense, and not in a

sense unreasonably restricted or enlarged.

21

With that background, if one looks at the

22

language of the Equal Protection Clause, nor shall any

23

State deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal

24

protection of the laws,

25

conclude that that provision should be limited in its

against because of membership in a group or class.

QUESTION:

And what is your answer, Mr. Wimmer,

4

to the argument that you have pled yourself out of court

5

by making your statement of the class of one or five but

6

then including in the complaint a rational basis for

7

seeking more land, that is, they wanted to make the

street?
MR. WIMMER:

9

Well, I don't think I did include

10

in my complaint a rational basis for the Village of

11

Willowbrook to treat Mrs. Olech differently from other

12

property owners.

13

rational basis related to a legitimate government

complaint does not show a rational basis related to a

legitimate government interest for the disparate

3

treatment, I think it is proper to inquire into the

4

motive, however, Judge -- or, I'm sorry, Your Honor --

5

because I have to show that there was a denial of equal

6

protection.

7

That connotes purposeful conduct on behalf of

8

the village, so I think that an allegation that they were

9

retaliating against them for filing a lawsuit shows that

10

it was not simply uneven law enforcement, or an accidental

11

disparate treatment, but an -QUESTION:

12

I suppose the way Judge Posner's view

13

could be explained is that there is a presumption that the

14

government acted for a reasonable purpose, and if there's

15

specific evidence to the contrary, then the case can

16

proceed and it just becomes a pleading case.

guess we have a Federal lawsuit even if the land was set

2

aside as coastal land, you know, a wonderful reason, has

3

the most beautiful view in the State, but it turns out,

4

it's alleged, that the real reason he did it is, he didn't

5

like the landowner.
I mean, once you get rid of a conceivable,

6

7

rational basis, you open the court to lawsuits no matter

8

how good the reason was, as long as there's an allegation

9

of animus.

10

MR. WIMMER:

That's right, although I think in

11

this case that's not what we have, since I've alleged

12

both, and the allegations of the complaint have to be

13

accepted as true at this point.

14

Briefly, with respect to exhaustion of remedies,

15

that's another question which I believe is not properly

16

before the Court for a number of reasons.

17

mentioned prior to the brief on the merits by the village.

18

It was not mentioned in the district court, where I could

19

have amended the complaint if there was a technical

20

deficiency, and also, even if Your Honors intend to

21

address the exhaustion of remedies issue, I believe the

22

Court has already held at least two times that one need

23

not exhaust his State remedies in order to state a claim

24

for a denial of the Equal Protection Clause.

25

It was not ever

And on this rationally related argument, what

this really comes down to is whether it was rationally

2

related to a legitimate State interest for Willowbrook to

3

demand private property rights of Mrs. Olech and the other

4

plaintiffs in the State court case as a condition of

5

receiving running water when those rights were not

That's what the complaint says, and I think that

question really answers itself.

12

basis based on the face of the complaint.

13

There's not a rational

One other point the village makes is, they argue

14

that the road was already in existence, and that they

15

simply desired to establish their right to maintain it.

16

The complaint does not allege how wide the road is, and

17

since it's not in the record I'm not going to state how

18

wide it is, but I think if that's a significant fact the

19

inference should be drawn in favor of the plaintiff that

20

the road is substantially narrower than the 66-foot road

21

that they were demanding be put in.
So I'd like to thank the Court.

22

In conclusion,

23

I believe that the Equal Protection Clause applies to

24

everybody, whether they're a member of a class or group or

25

not.

It certainly applies to Mrs. Olech.

Thank you.
