CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 99-391, Robin Free v. Abbott Laboratories.

Mr. Small.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL A. SMALL

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SMALL:

8

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Section 1367 plainly requires original

11

jurisdiction as a predicate to the exercise of

12

supplemental jurisdiction.

13

jurisdiction may not be exercised over the claims of the

14

absent class members because the claims of the named

15

plaintiffs are not within the original jurisdiction of the

16

district court.

17

In this case, supplemental

The critical issue in this case, therefore,

18

involves an issue of original jurisdiction and involves an

19

interpretation, the proper interpretation of the matter-

20

in-controversy requirement of the diversity statute.

21

Specifically, the issue is whether the determination under

22

that requirement that a particular plaintiff satisfies

23

that requirement looks only to the value of that

24

plaintiff's claims, or does it also look to the value of

25

his coplaintiff's claims.

The answer is, the matter-in3

1

controversy rule is an all-or-nothing rule.

2

plaintiffs in the case satisfy it, or none do.

3

QUESTION:

Either all

Mr. Small, you didn't raise the

4

question whether any plaintiff in this class qualifies.

5

That is, I take it that the Frees in their own right, if

6

they were suing for their own individual injury, would not

7

get anywhere near $50,000, because they're like all the

8

others in that respect.
MR. SMALL:

9

It is true, Your Honor, that none of

10

the plaintiffs have damages that would satisfy the then-

11

applicable $50,000 matter-in-controversy requirement.

12

only reason the Fifth Circuit found that the named

The

3

plaintiff satisfied that requirement was a Louisiana fee

4

statute that awarded fees in a class action solely to the

5

class representative.
QUESTION:

6

But then their ability to collect

7

those fees depends on their bringing other people with

8

them, that is, the solo plaintiffs who don't qualify for

9

Federal court jurisdiction.
MR. SMALL:

20

That is precisely correct.

The

2

applicability of that Louisiana fee statute applies only

22

in a class action.

23

class action, that statute would not apply and the named

24

plaintiffs, the Frees, would not have the jurisdictional

25

amount.

If there's no jurisdiction to bring a

QUESTION:

1
2

As I understand, you did bring that

up below, but you didn't tender it to this Court.

3

MR. SMALL:

Well, Your Honor, we didn't

4

specifically raise it because we didn't frame the question

5

presented in that way.

6

of whether the Zahn ruling of this Court should be

7

overturned.
QUESTION:

8

9

We were addressing it as an issue

Yes, but if it goes to the amount in

controversy, or diversity jurisdiction, it is

10

jurisdictional and, even if you didn't bring it up, you

11

know that we would have an obligation to do so on our own.
MR. SMALL:

12

I believe that's correct, Your

3

Honor.

We attempted in the Fifth Circuit, in the second

4

appeal before that court, to raise certain issues of

5

jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction which the Fifth

6

Circuit refused to hear on the ground of the law of the

7

case doctrine, and there are other issues, of course,

8

which we do not agree with that the Fifth Circuit decided,

9

but we are not squarely presenting those to this Court.
QUESTION:

20

Well, I don't want to detain you,

2

because you want to argue Zahn and the effect of

22

but I do see that as a major problem in this lawsuit, that

23

these plaintiffs could qualify only because they bring

24

other plaintiffs with them, and not in their individual

25

right.

367,

MR. SMALL:

1

I think, Your Honor, that goes to

2

the appropriate result in this case if the Court were to

3

reverse, because it would require that everyone's claims

4

go back to State court, because the absent class members

5

as well as the named plaintiffs would not have the

6

amount --

7

QUESTION:

But it's a matter of Louisiana law,

8

is it not, at least so the Fifth Circuit held, that the

9

named plaintiffs get all of the attorney's fees?

MR. SMALL:
Louisiana law.

That was decided as a matter of

There was a specific --

QUESTION:

But not as individuals.

In other

13

words, if they were just bringing this claim for the baby

14

formula in their own right, they do not get attorney's

15

fees for that, do they?

16
17
18
19

MR. SMALL:

They would not get attorney's fees

under the specific Louisiana statute.
QUESTION:

So Louisiana permits them, as class

representatives, to get these fees.

20

MR. SMALL:

21

QUESTION:

That's correct.
But to get them, they must pull other

22

people along with them, and that was the only point that I

23

was attempting to make.

24

MR. SMALL:

That's correct.

question presented.
MR. SMALL:

Our view of the matter-inÂ­

3

controversy requirement is a permissible interpretation

4

under section 1332, the diversity statute, and it's also

5

the better reading of that statute for several reasons.

6

First, let me summarize quickly what the reasons

7

are that our interpretation of 1332, which fits within the

8

language, is the better interpretation.

9

having section 1367 operate in a way that Congress clearly

First, it avoids

10

did not intend.

11

not intend, when it enacted 1367, to sweep aside a

12

fundamental, longstanding rule of limiting diversity

13

jurisdiction.

14

It could not be clearer that Congress did

QUESTION:

Well, when you say it could not be

15

clearer, I take it you're talking about the legislative

16

history and not the statute itself.

17

MR. SMALL:

We're talking about more than just

18

the legislative history, Your Honor.

19

about the context in which the statute became law.

20

QUESTION:

We're talking first

But don't we usually first look to

21

find out what Congress intended, at the words that

Congress wrote?

1

Honor, is that section 1367's plain language has relevance

2

to only one issue in this case.

3

this Court that before supplemental jurisdiction can be

4

exercised in this case, original jurisdiction has to

5

exist, and so it refers the court from 1367 to the

6

original jurisdiction statute, which in this case is 1332.

7

That is the end of the role of 1367 in this case.

8

9

The plain language tells

Now we're into 1332, and there, we don't have
plain language.

We're saying that the term,

10

matter-in-controversy, in section 1332, is subject to

11

different interpretations.

12

certainly permissible, it fits within the language, and

13

our interpretation is the preferred one for several

14

reasons, the first of which I indicated was that Congress

15

did not intend to overrule Zahn.

16

Our interpretation is

And Congress' intent can be effectuated in 1367

17

only if 1332 is interpreted in the way we suggest, and

18

that task is called a classic judicial task that this

19

Court recognized just last week in FDA v. Brown &

20

Williamson, to take multiple laws that have been passed

21

over time and make them work in combination.

22

We are asking the Court in this case to read

23

section 1332 permissibly, within its language, in a way

24

that allows 1367 to function coherently and in a way that

25

Congress intended when it enacted -8

The Fifth Circuit overlooked, in our

opinion, the original jurisdiction predicate in

367.

It

9

assumed that it has original jurisdiction over the named

10

plaintiffs' claims when in fact they did not, because the

11

matter-in-controversy rule says you cannot have original

It isn't

thought that for diversity purposes the named plaintiffs

MR. SMALL:

In diversity, I

In the class action context, as this

5

Court's decision in Ben Hur has subsequently been

6

construed by lower courts, it is true that you look at the

named plaintiffs to see whether they are diverse from each

of the defendants.
First of all, the rule still applies to all the

named plaintiffs.

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that today, in all

the class actions that are brought in Federal court, that

rule isn't observed, that only the named representatives

count for diversity purposes?

MR. SMALL:

I'm not disputing that, Your Honor.

I'm saying that that's a lower court interpretation that

has expanded Ben Hur.
QUESTION:

That's all I'm saying, Your Honor.
Now, you suggest that this statute

changed the lower court's general reading of Ben Hur?

MR. SMALL:

No, Your Honor, I don't believe that

our interpretation would affect Ben Hur.

reason is there would be coplaintiffs in the case, here

wrote in 1367 does not overrule Zahn because all that 1367

says is, you can have supplemental jurisdiction if there's

jurisdiction in this case.
QUESTION:

5

There's no original

But it -- the statute begins by

6

saying, except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), so

7

it seems to me that to make your argument you have to go

to (b) and then say that the first clause takes you out of

it.
MR. SMALL:

10

If our position were that 1367(a)

11

granted supplemental jurisdiction over the absent class

12

members, we would have to get to (b) to say, but it took

13

it away.

1

members of the class, B, C, and D, and you're saying

2

unless there's original jurisdiction also as to B, also as

3

to C, also as to D, that the whole statute doesn't

operate.

Isn't that what you're saying?

5

MR. SMALL:

6

QUESTION:

That is true.
All right.

Now, if that's true, then

7

why isn't that also true -- take the person that they're

8

aiming at in this statute, somebody who comes along and

9

has some kind of supplemental claim later on, or a

10

defendant or somebody who's not in the suit.
There's somebody you can add, and there's

11

12

somebody that this was needed to get into court, and why

wouldn't exactly your same argument then apply to that

person?

jurisdiction over that person, which of course there

16

wasn't.

You'd say, well, there was never original

That's why they wrote this statute.
So if we accept that argument of yours as to

18

class people, why wouldn't we have to accept it as to

19

everybody and then this 1367(a) would do nothing

20

whatsoever?

21

MR. SMALL:

It has to do, Your Honor, with the

22

scope of the matter-in-controversy rule.

There are

23

parties over which supplemental jurisdiction can be

24

exercised in a diversity case.

25

claims can be the subject of supplemental jurisdiction.

For example, defendants'

1

For instance, if a defendant impleads a third party, that

2

claim can be within the supplemental jurisdiction in a

3

diversity case.

4

All the statute is doing is for --

QUESTION:

Why?

Just tell me why?

On your

5

theory, that person that they just brought in wouldn't

6

have had an original -- you wouldn't have had original

7

jurisdiction over that claim.

12

MR. SMALL:

But that's not the way the matter-

in-controversy requirement has been interpreted in
decisions -QUESTION:

Oh, no, no.

You want to just limit

your word, original jurisdiction, to where what happens to

3

be the disqualifying feature has to do with the amount in

4

controversy, and I'm asking you, fine, that's nice, I

5

agree that would let you limit the case and win, but why

6

do it that -- why that limitation?

7

MR. SMALL:

I believe there are reasons that

8

have been expressed by the Court in deciding whether the

9

addition of certain claims into a diversity case are

20

treated as a matter of original jurisdiction or as a

21

matter of supplemental jurisdiction.

22

In the Kroger case, for instance, Your Honor,

23

the question of whether the impleaded third party

24

defendant was in the case as a matter of supplemental

25

Congress was concerned that the Finley

decision raised great doubt about whether there was

3

statutory authority for supplemental jurisdiction.

4

Finley decision said that unless the original jurisdiction

5

statute, in that case the Federal Tort Claims Act, showed

6

that there was supplemental jurisdiction, it could not be

7

exercised and that in that context, when parties were

8

being added to the case, the original jurisdiction statute

9

would be narrowly construed.

The

So Congress was very concerned that the

10
11

foundation for pendant party jurisdiction was undercut by

12

Finley, and possibly even pendant claim jurisdiction, so

3

that was the reason.

4

Now, remember that

367 was passed as part of a

5

large bill that dealt with all sorts of noncontroversial

matters that Congress believed could be readily dealt with

late in the session, and no one thought this was

MR. SMALL:

That was the particular problem in

Finley but, of course, there was concern that Finley could

be read broader and, in fact, had been by some of the

MR. SMALL:

The inconsistency under the

respondents' interpretation is that you can have a

plaintiff come into a diversity case under Rule 20 in

5

their supplemental jurisdiction over that plaintiff, but

6

the very same plaintiff could not enter the case under

7

Rule 19 when it was necessary, for instance, to avoid the

8

potential for multiple liability or inconsistent

9

obligations on the part of a defendant, and would also

10

prohibit that very same plaintiff from coming in to the

11

case as an intervenor under Rule 24 to protect his or her

12

interests in the litigation.

13

It simply cannot make sense for that distinction

14

between Rules 19 and 24 on the one hand and Rule 20 on the

other, and that's precisely what Judge Easterbrook asked

just like every other member of the class as far as the

That's

Nothing else.
I think he's -- I think petitioner

I think that the

statute did more -- indeed, I believe that the statute

overruled the Zahn case, and the text of the statute is

clear with respect to that, and all the petitioners do,

opinion, that literally the language would cover an

cover, literally, permissive joinder under Rule 20.

MR. CICERO:

whether anybody ever noticed it or not, because the --

there were a lot of academics crawling over this area, as

the Court knows, and they wrote a lot of things about it,

Zahn that said Zahn was wrongly decided, because it should

have been like Ben Hur, that only the named

6

MR. CICERO:

QUESTION:

8

MR. CICERO:

9

Well --- and Zahn has existed since then.
Some of the commentators, Your

Honor, were people like the ones we cite in our footnote,

10

in the footnote at page 6 of our brief, who stated in an

11

article afterward that they realized that they had to

12

correct what the plain language of the statute said, and

13

so that footnote -- that one sentence was put into the

legislative history in a section dealing with subsection

(b), by the way.

16

A sentence was put in that said, this is not

intended to alter the jurisdictional requirements and

divert class action diversity cases as set forth under

section 1332, footnoting Zahn and Ben Hur.

20

What does that tell us?

Well, that phrase, the

jurisdictional requirements, is the phrase at the end of

jurisdictional amounts, and the result they held was the

with respect to those who were not -- who did not have the

12

the one who did have the requisite amount was out of the

He's asking for a double-headed result.

asking for a result that not only says it can't be a class

result they're asking is that the Court in effect give

them a remand by saying that there wasn't jurisdiction.

But the defendants have rights here, too, and

me just assume something for a moment.

Assume that I

think you've by far got the better reading of the plain

language of the statute, and assume that it's also

20

perfectly clear, and maybe it isn't perfectly clear, but

it's really quite clear that Congress did not intend that,

that they did not intend to expand -- make a rather

dramatic expansion in Federal jurisdiction after this task

1

Assuming those two things, you -- the better

2

reading, but the legislative history is crystal clear to

3

the contrary.

4

What should we do?

MR. CICERO:

Well, Your Honor, what you should

5

do here, I think, is that you should affirm the Fifth

6

Circuit, because I think the reading of the statute was

7

correct, and this goes to your question as well as the

8

second part of Justice Ginsburg's question, the

9

legislative history is not one-sided here, because the

10

judicial -- the Court Study Commission, which issued its

11

report in April of 1990, the report of the commission

12

itself had a simple statement concerning ancillary

13

jurisdiction, or supplemental jurisdiction that it should

14

be in anything arising out of the same case or

15

controversy, but the subcommittee, as the Court knows,

16

chaired by Judge Posner, had a statute very similar to

17

what was finally enacted which did not refer to

18

subsection, to Rule 23 in the draft of subsection (b), and

19

which said the intention -- as the report said, the

20

intention was to overrule Zahn.

21

Now, Judge Weis in particular took -- had a

22

strong interest in not expanding diversity jurisdiction.

But when he got before the Judiciary Committee of the

24

House in September, and it was clear that there was not

general satisfaction with the broad draft that was being

put forward at that time, he offered, in connection with

2

his prepared remarks, and it's in the legislative history,

3

he offered a text of a suggested statute which was in all

4

material respects like the one that came out of the

5

subcommittee of the Judicial Court Study Commission, and

6

that, with some minor differences in wording, was what was

7

finally adopted by the Congress.

8

There was plenty of understanding from April on

9

that Zahn and Rule 23 were issues with respect to this

10

statute, but despite the fact that the academics said,

11

gee, the language of the statute is plain, and would

12

overrule Zahn, we better get a sentence into the

13

legislative report, Congress didn't do that.

14

not include Rule 23 in the exceptions of -- to the general

grant of subsection (a) .

It would have been very easy for them to do it

reasons why people in 1990, with the -- in -- during the

Bush administration, with the Bush Justice Department and

The word is all claims,
