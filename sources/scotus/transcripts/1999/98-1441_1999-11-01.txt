ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL E. O'CONNOR

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. O'CONNOR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
We are here today because the Ninth Circuit has

11

imposed on the State the per se rule of ineffective

12

assistance of counsel where an attorney declines to file a

13

notice of appeal and does not obtain a waiver of appeal --

14
15

QUESTION:

I can't hear you.

Could you maybe

speak up or put the --

16

QUESTION:

Maybe raise the lectern a little.

QUESTION:

Crank up the thing.

QUESTION:

No, you're cranking --

QUESTION:

MR. O'CONNOR:

22

QUESTION:

23

Okay.

Shall I start over?

Yes.
Mr. Chief Justice --

Only if you want me to know what you

were saying earlier.

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. O'CONNOR:

All right.

and may it please the Court:
We are here today because the Ninth Circuit has

2

3

imposed on the State a per se rule of ineffective

4

assistance of counsel where an attorney declines to file a

5

notice of appeal and does not obtain a waiver of appeal

6

rights.

7

pleaded guilty, there has been no request for an appeal

8

despite an appeal rights advisement, and there are no

9

grounds for an appeal.

10

This rule applies even where a defendant has

QUESTION:

Well, isn't -- shouldn't you also add

11

to your statement of fact that there has in fact been, I

12

guess in this case, a naked plea, and the defendant's

13

claim is that the defendant had been led to expect a

14

sentence perhaps as low as 3-1/2 and instead got a

15

sentence of 15, so that there's a -- at least is a

16

potential claim that the sentence is too high, or in

17

relation the defendant's expectations the plea would not

18

have been entered under those circumstances that the

19

defendant anticipated the sentence.

20

something we should consider?

21

MR. O'CONNOR:

Isn't that also

Well, Your Honor, that's not an

22

arguable issue, because the defendant was advised on the

23

record at the plea hearing that he would receive a

24

sentence of 15 years to life.

25

QUESTION:

Before the plea was entered?

MR. O'CONNOR:

2

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

So -- I misunderstood this.

So this,

3

then, is a case, I guess exactly like a case in which the

4

defendant has a plea agreement and the plea agreement is

5

meticulously followed by the court.

6

MR. O'CONNOR:

QUESTION:

MR. O'CONNOR:

Ninth Circuit's rule -QUESTION:

10

Yes, Your Honor.

I see.
In addition, affirmance of the

You might show us where in the joint

11

appendix that conversation occurred, if you would.

Or

12

maybe you can come back to it and your cocounsel can try

13

to find it.

14

MR. O'CONNOR:

Thank you.

15

In addition, affirmance would lead to habeas

16

litigation concerning defaulted meritless post plea

17

appeals.

18

relitigation of the case would be difficult because of the

19

passage of time.

20

In those rare cases where relief is granted,

The Ninth Circuit rule is simply wrong.

There

21

is nothing presumptively ineffective about not filing an

22

appeal after a guilty plea.

23

challenging the plea and the resulting sentence.

QUESTION:

There are few grounds for

of this particular case there might be some necessity to

go back and review them?
I recognize that your position is that a per se

2

3

rule is not appropriate, but it is somewhat troubling that

4

here the magistrate judge found that Ortega wanted to

5

appeal, was under the impression that his lawyer would

6

file an appeal, and was himself incarcerated and not able

7

to do it, and the lawyer testified that she couldn't

8

remember her discussion about it with the defendant.

9

Now, when you put all those things together,

10

perhaps, although you don't need a per se rule, there

11

might be some reason here to think that an appeal should

12

be given.
MR. O'CONNOR:

13

Well, Your Honor, it is our

14

position that, because there was no request for an appeal,

15

and because there were no grounds for appeal that a

16

reasonable attorney would have pursued, that there was no

17

duty under the first prong of Strickland to file an

18

appeal.

19

Also, I found that portion of the transcript

20

where the defendant was advised of the sentence.

21

at --

the transcripts.
The court states, and do you understand that the

2

3

term for second degree murder is 15 years to life?

4

defendant responds, yes.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. O'CONNOR:

7

understand that?

9
10

Uh-huh.
The court asks again, do you

The defendant repeats, yes.

QUESTION:

8

The

Well, I don't understand that to mean

that he's going to get 15 years.

I guess it's -- looks to

me as though he understands that a potential term.

11

QUESTION:

Was probation a possibility?

12

MR. O'CONNOR:

Yes, Your Honor, it was a

13

possibility, but under the California Rules of Court

14

probation was only permissible under unusual

15

circumstances, and defense counsel testified at the

16

evidentiary hearing that a claim that the court abused its

17

discretion in denying probation would almost certainly

18

fail.

19

QUESTION:

Yes, but the -- there at least was a

20

claim, there was an argument, I guess, that there should

21

have been probation.

22

should have been probation, that flies in the face of your

23

suggestion that there was an understanding that he was

24

going to get a 15-year term.

25

If there was an argument that there

Well, Your Honor, I think the

1

understanding was that he would receive a 15-year term and

2

that the possibility of probation was highly unlikely.

3
4

QUESTION:

Why don't you go earlier in the

questioning?

5

So has anybody made any promises to you beyond

6

what I have just said, namely that counts 2 and 3 will be

7

dismissed, and there would be just the one count.

8

anybody made any other promises?

9

promise?

10

Has

And the defendant says,

In other words, the district attorney has

11

promised if you plead guilty she's going to dismiss the

12

other counts and the knife enhancement.

13

promises made to you?

14

The defendant:

15

All right.

Were any other

No.

Can you tell me what the term is for

16

second degree murder?

17

it's 15 years to life.

And he says he understands that

18

MR. O'CONNOR:

19

QUESTION:

Correct, Your Honor.

You put all that together, it seems

20

to me he understands he's going to get 15 years to life,

21

and has been promised nothing else.

22

MR. O'CONNOR:

23

QUESTION:

That's right, Your Honor.

Yes, but you -- what you get is

24

probably a clearly losing claim on appeal, but his

25

argument is, I would like to have -- I think his argument

too long.

3

the outer limit.

I didn't have to get 15 years.

That was simply

And he may very well -- in front of me, I guess,

4
5

he would certainly lose his argument there, but what he

6

wants --

7

QUESTION:

Life was the outer limit, I thought.

8

QUESTION:

What he wants is to make the

9

argument.
MR. O'CONNOR:

10

Well, Your Honor, actually his

11

argument is that he thought he was going to get 3-1/2

12

years, and there is simply no support for that.
QUESTION:

13

Right, and he thought -- maybe there

14

was no support for it, but you don't take this statement

15

as an indication that he was agreeing that he would get 15

16

years.

17

MR. O'CONNOR:

Well, Your Honor, I think he did

18

understand that he was going to get 15 years.

There was

19

the portion of the transcript, the guilty plea transcript

20

we just referred to.

21

in the probation report that he would get 15 years to

22

life.

23

with him the day before sentencing, and then when he was

24

sentenced to 15 years to life he expressed no surprise at

25

that.

Also, the probation officer stated

The defense attorney went over the probation report

QUESTION:

1

Okay.

I think we may just disagree

2

on what the record shows, but let me ask you this

3

question.
Let's assume that there is a case in which there

4
5

is no predetermined term in the -- as a part of the plea

6

agreement.

7

sentence than he wanted to get, a longer sentence than he

8

thought he would get, and he wants to argue that, in fact,

9

that sentence is, for whatever reason, improperly wrong,

The defendant ends up getting a longer

10

that it was error, and reversible error to sentence him to

11

that long a sentence.

12

And let's assume, finally, that that kind of a

13

claim is highly unlikely to succeed, maybe because he's

14

just being unreasonable.

15

In that case, do you believe that there is no

16

obligation, following the guilty plea, for counsel to

17

counsel him about appeal and get an affirmative decision

18

from him one way or the other?

19

MR. O'CONNOR:

Well, Your Honor, if there are

20

circumstances indicating the defendant might benefit from

21

an appeal, or advice concerning an appeal --

22

QUESTION:

Well, take my hypothetical.

He

23

doesn't like it, but we all know that he's going to lose

24

if he makes that argument.

25

will be a successful appeal.

It's highly unlikely that that

1

obligation under the Strickland standard to counsel him

2

that he has appeal rights and to get a yes or no answer

3

from him as to whether he wants an appeal?

4

MR. O'CONNOR:

Yes, Your Honor, counsel has a

5

duty under the first prong of Strickland to advise

6

concerning appeal rights, even after a guilty plea, if

7

there are circumstances indicating the defendant might

8

benefit from such advice.

9

grounds -QUESTION:

10

No,

In other words, there are

but in my case the

11

circumstances, the defendant probably isn't going to

12

benefit.

13

a Strickland obligation to counsel him and get a decision

14

on my hypothetical?

He's going to lose the appeal.

QUESTION:

2

Well, is there a duty to get a

decision from the defendant, yes or no, as to whether he

hypothetical posed -QUESTION:

for appeal, what would he advise the defendant?

MR. O'CONNOR:

He would advise the defendant there

are no grounds for appeal.

2

MR. O'CONNOR:

That is correct, Your Honor.

3

QUESTION:

But in this case --

4

QUESTION:

And if the defendant said appeal

5

anyway, he would say,

6

know, there are no grounds --

7

I can't appeal, there are -- you

MR. O'CONNOR:

Well, yes, Your Honor.

The

8

attorney would -- if the client wanted to appeal, and the

9

attorney felt the grounds were frivolous, the attorney

10

does not have an obligation to file the appeal, although

11

the attorney would assist the defendant in filing his own

12

appeal.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

In other words,

it's the guilty plea

that relieves him of the Anders obligation?
MR. O'CONNOR:

Well, Your Honor, again, the

16

Anders obligation is actually an obligation of appellate

17

counsel, to file an Anders brief.

18

QUESTION:

Well,

It's --

I guess the lawyer at that

19

point could say, well,

20

court to appoint different appellate counsel, if it would,

21

but until the lawyer does withdraw, I suppose the lawyer

22

has got the obligation under Anders, doesn't he?

23

MR. O'CONNOR:

I'm going to withdraw and ask the

Well, if there are arguable

24

grounds for appeal, the trial lawyer would have a duty to

duty to actually file the appeal unless there was either a

2

request for an appeal, nonfrivolous appeal, or there were

3

grounds on which any reasonable attorney would pursue an

4

appeal.

5

QUESTION:

So if the defendant simply sits mute

6

and doesn't say, I want you to appeal, or I don't want you

7

to appeal, the obligation is over at that point?

8

9

MR. O'CONNOR:

After a guilty plea, generally

speaking, yes.

10

QUESTION:

But not after a trial?

11

MR. O'CONNOR:

Yes, Your Honor.

In a trial

12

situation it can usually be assumed that the defendant

13

does want to continue the litigation.

14

QUESTION:

Well, but if the issue following the

15

plea, if the issue upon which the defendant may want to

16

appeal is the sentence, so that the -- and the sentence is

17

not foreclosed by the guilty plea, why isn't the

18

obligation, at least with respect to an appeal of

19

sentence, the same following a plea as the obligation with

20

respect to any issue following a verdict?

21

MR. O'CONNOR:

Well, Your Honor, sentencing

22

issues are usually addressed in a plea negotiations, so

23

there usually are not --

QUESTION:

If we've got a case in which there is

no plea agreement about what the sentence will be, and the

sentence may be higher than the defendant thinks is

2

proper, so that the defendant would like to appeal it, why

isn't the defendant in the same relationship to his

counsel with respect to the sentence that any defendant is

5

in relationship to counsel following a verdict and

sentence?

7
8

MR. O'CONNOR:

Well, yes, Your Honor, if the

issue of sentencing is left completely open --

9

QUESTION:

Well, it was open here, wasn't it?

MR. O'CONNOR:

10

Well, no, Your Honor.

The

11

defendant understood that he would receive a sentence of

12

15 years to life.

13

QUESTION:

Well, if -- let's assume we --

14

there's no plea agreement, I take it, in the record or

15

anywhere else, to the effect that he was agreeing in

16

advance to a 15-year sentence, was there?

17

MR. O'CONNOR:

Well, Your Honor, a sentence of

18

15 years to life is the only sentence for second degree

19

murder -QUESTION:

20

All he agreed to was that he agreed

21

to plead guilty to second degree murder, which contained a

punishment of 15 years to life.

QUESTION:

Probation.

MR. O'CONNOR:

QUESTION:

5

MR. O'CONNOR:

Probation.

Probation, I mean.
Yes, Your Honor, it was an

6

option, but under the California Rules of the Court it

7

could only be granted in unusual circumstances.

8

9

QUESTION:

No, but is it not conceivable --

well, I don't know, that the defendant thought, oh yes, if

10

he sentences

me it will be 15 years, but I at least have

11

a long shot at probation?

Isn't that conceivable?

12

I mean, would this case be different, say, if

13

they didn't -- if this wasn't -- say the sentence could

14

have been anywhere from 1 year to life, and he ends up

15

getting a 20-year sentence, which was a lot more than he

expected, the -- you'd make the same arguments I think,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD C. DuMONT

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

20

MR. DuMONT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The situation we have here arises when you have

21

a counseled defendant who has pleaded guilty, has been

22

given notice of the right to appeal, and arrives later on

23

habeas claiming that ineffective assistance, incompetent

24

advice from counsel led to the forfeiture of the right to

25

a direct appeal.

1

Now, that poses a risk both of a serious

2

constitutional deprivation, and a serious risk of abuse,

3

because it comes after a time when all of these issues

4

should initially be raised, and when there's some reliance

5

interest from the State on the fact that no appeal was

6

filed, and the challenge is to craft a rule that minimizes

7

the risk both of the deprivation and of the abuse without

8

unduly burdening the district courts, and we think the

9

Court's cases provide a familiar model for that, which is

10
11
12

13

simply the Strickland analysis.
Strickland teaches that there is a strong
presumption of competent assistance -QUESTION:

Well, Strickland -- Strickland says

14

we're going to approach it on a case-by-case basis.

15

going to look at all the circumstances.

16

MR. DuMONT:

17

QUESTION:

We're

Right?

That's correct.
And there's an objectively

18

reasonableness component of the lawyer's performance, and

19

a prejudice component.

20

MR. DuMONT:

21

QUESTION:

22

23

That's correct.
Now, the Ninth Circuit seems to have

applied some kind of a per se rule.
MR. DuMONT:

Well, what the Ninth Circuit has

24

done really is to, in this context, revert to what we

25

would characterize as a knowing waiver or a deliberate

bypass standard, and we think that's right, it's

2

completely inconsistent with Strickland.

3

completely eliminated the prejudice and even, really, the

4

competence prongs of Strickland, so it's an entirely

5

unrecognizable rule.

6

QUESTION:

They have

Well, if we were to agree that the

7

Ninth Circuit's per se rule is invalid, would this case

8

still have to be remanded to have the court below consider

9

the circumstances here, where the magistrate said that

10

Ortega wanted to appeal and thought the attorney was going

11

to file an appeal?

12

16

MR. DuMONT:

Well, all the magistrate said --

the magistrate's findings are very ambiguous, and a -QUESTION:

-- there's enough that you could

characterize them that way.
MR. DuMONT:

A remand would not be necessarily

17

inappropriate once the Court articulates the rule.

18

don't think it's necessary here, because we think that if

19

you look at the record as a whole, as the district court

20

ought to do, on an ineffective assistance challenge, what

21

you would find is that there is, a), no reason to think

22

that counsel was incompetent in counseling about appeal,

23

and 2) there's no reason to think that the defendant

24

would -- there's no reasonable probability or significant

25

possibility that the -- that a competently counseled

We

defendant would have chosen to appeal under these

circumstances.
QUESTION:

3

May I ask just one sort of basic

4

question on that point?

5

different after a trial and conviction on the one hand and

6

after a guilty plea, then an interval, and then sentencing

7

later?
MR. DuMONT:

8

Do you think the rule should be

We think the rule -- the test is

9

the same, but the result may very well be different in

10

many of the cases, and that's because it's a facts and

11

circumstances test, and the circumstance of a guilty plea

12

is tremendously important, and that's for two reasons,

13

really.

14

The first is that there's very little left to

15

appeal, normally, after a guilty plea, although there's

16

sentencing issues, of course, at least in the Federal

17

system.

18

And the second one -- and the second issue --

19

there's no -- I would like to come back to this.

20

really no sentencing issue here, I think.

21

There's

But the second reason is that because -- the

22

presumption is that there is competent counsel, and the

23

presumption is that there will have been competent counsel

24

on the guilty plea as well as on this issue of appeal, and

25

it gets right to this question that you were discussing

with my colleague.
If you assume competent counsel on the issue of

2

3

whether or not to plead guilty, then you would assume that

4

the lawyer had discussed with the client what the

5

parameters of sentencing were going to be if he pled to

6

second degree murder.
QUESTION:

7

Let me just interrupt with one

8

quick -- why don't you make the same presumption after a

9

trial?

10

You presume competency of counsel in all

situations.
MR. DuMONT:

11

That's absolutely right.

It's

12

simply that the record is much more likely to, considered

13

as a whole -- there are two things.

14

First of all, the record is more likely to

15

reveal issues that are worthy of appeal and, second, there

16

is more reason to assume that the defendant was intent on

17

fighting the conviction, was perhaps maintaining his

18

innocence, and would have wanted to appeal.

19

change significantly in the guilty plea context.

Both of those

20

Now, if I can just point out that on this issue

21

of the 3-1/2 years, which I agree, if you look through -QUESTION:

22

23

This is why there is no sentencing

issue.

Yes.

MR. DuMONT:

1

If you look through the record

2

here -- well, on the issue of the 3-1/2 years, that is an

3

allegation that's made in some of the earlier habeas

4

filings in the State system.

5

here except by way of a factual statement.

It's not made, incidentally,

I think that's only -- the 3-1/2 years only

6

7

comes up in the written papers, which there's some reason

8

to wonder whether this defendant was personally

9

responsible for them, because he had assistance and he was

10

in the prison when filing them.
When he was testifying at the evidentiary

11
12

hearing in this proceeding, what he said was -- and this

13

is at page 26 of the transcript of the evidentiary

14

hearing.

I'm afraid it's not in the joint appendix.

15

But what he said was, well, she -- meaning his

16

attorney -- all she told me was to go the jail trusting

17

her, that of the 15 years I would only do 7-1/2, and that

18

I would get to work at the jail, I would receive payment,

19

and so on.

20

Now, significant to that, actually, is that as I

21

understand it good time credits, which do come off the 15-

22

year minimum, could, in fact, in California have taken him

23

down to 7-1/2, and that would suggest that what he got was

24

competent counseling about the likely, both legal and

25

practical effects of the sentence.

Now, the legal effect is that there's only one

1

2

sentence
QUESTION:

3

Is that in fact what he got, as a

4

practical matter, in his sentence, what he was describing

5

in the transcript as you read it?
MR. DuMONT:

6

Is --

My -- my understanding -- I can't

7

represent that firmly, but my understanding from my

8

colleagues from California is that that is realistic, that

9

from a 15-year minimum, under the statutory indeterminate

10

sentencing scheme, with good time you could be eligible

11

for release by the Board of Prison Terms as early as 7-

12

1/2 years.

13

QUESTION:

Is it clear from the transcript, and

14

it may be that I wasn't listening carefully when you first

15

started it, but is it clear from the transcript that he

16

was saying that she advised him that he would get a 15-

17

year term which would be subject to the good time credits,

18

or that she was advising him that if he got a 15-year term

19

it would be subject to the good time credits?

20

one way or the other?

21

MR. DuMONT:

Is it clear

Well, if there was any kind of

22

competent advice at all, the advice would have had to be,

23

the term will be 15 years to life, because that is the

24

only term authorized by statute.

25

sentencing scheme in California.

It is an indeterminate

QUESTION:

1

So your argument, I take it, is we're

2

not clear, the transcript is not clear on that, but on the

3

assumption that counsel was competent, that's what she

4

would have said?
MR. DuMONT:

5
6

anything to appeal anyway --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. DuMONT:

9

Well, and that there wouldn't be

Okay.
-- because there's no other

possible result.
QUESTION:

10

But I mean, it seems to me that that

11

reconstruction of what presumably went on is perhaps what

12

he would like to test out on appeal.
MR. DuMONT:

13

Well, I think -- if you look

14

through the record -- this is what I was starting to say

15

before.

16

it the way a lawyer might, I think it is true you would

17

come up with a couple of things.

18

If you look through the record and come through

One is that issue, and one is the issue he

19

raised before the California supreme court, which was, my

20

attorney should have taken me to trial and tried to get

21

manslaughter instead of second degree murder, it was a

22

fight, and this kind of thing.

23

QUESTION:

Okay.

But let's assume that's --

24

that part is waived.

25

that issue was waived, and the only thing that's left is

He -- if the plea is a valid plea,

1

sentence, and it seems to me that on the argument that

2

you've just made there is a very plausible basis for

3

saying that if he had taken an appeal on that issue, he

4

would have lost, clearly.

5

On the other hand, we at least in the Anders

6

situation require counsel to address the issue, and I'm

7

not sure how your position squares with Anders.

8

help me out on that?

9

MR. DuMONT:

Can you

All the Anders cases, enhancements

10

on all the Anders cases are cases where we are already

11

passed the filing of the notice of appeal, or we are into

12

the appeal process, and so there's a supposition --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. DuMONT:

15

QUESTION:

Okay --- wanted to go forward.
-- but we make an Anders lawyer do

16

what Anders says the lawyer must do, it would be strange

17

if there were somehow a short-circuit to the process as

18

you are arguing.

19

I mean, it just seems odd to me.

MR. DuMONT:

We agree that there is a

20

constitutional duty to provide adequate representation

21

about the question of whether or not to appeal.

22

The question is, when you come in on habeas ex

23

post and you look back under conditions usually of great

24

uncertainty about what happened, where is the risk of

25

error going to fall, and we think it's inappropriate in

those circumstances for it to fall entirely on the State,

2

which is what the Ninth Circuit's rule does here.

3

QUESTION:

MR. DuMONT:

Mr. DuMont -Instead, what you should look at is

5

whether there is any reason to think that counsel was

6

incompetent, which there is not here, and whether there

7

was any reason to think that a competently counseled

8

defendant would have gone ahead and lodged an appeal, and

9

the answer here is no, because on the sentencing issue

10

there is no -QUESTION:

11

So you're saying in effect you can't

12

have a rule that says as a matter of law competent counsel

13

must instruct on the appeal issue and get a -- an

14

affirmative or a negative response one way or the other.

You're saying that that is an improper gloss on

so you cannot be eligible for parole until you have served

found suitable for parole, so just as a factual matter

that is -- that was incorrect.
But -- and there's also this question that

5

Justice Souter had raised about whether there was

There was not a

predetermined sentence in this case.

What followed from

his plea of second -- to second degree murder was that he

would either be sentenced to 15 years to life, or, in an

10

unusual case, he could get probation.
That was not ruled out by the plea agreement,

and in fact the entire sentencing argument was about that.

His lawyer argued at great length that he should be given

probation, and it was unusual.

So if you don't do it this way, in

MR. DENVIR:

5

And I believe that's why the Court

6

has never required that in a comparable situation, and I

7

think that's the reason for the concurring opinion in

Pigaro which said that really it's unfair and impractical

9

to expect a counsel-less petitioner to be able to do the

legal work to show the court whether there are or not

11

meritorious issues, and instead, if counsel does his or

12

her duty, gives some advice to the client, finds out what

the client wants to do, and files a notice of appeal, then

things will develop as they should with counsel and an

He can raise it

MR. DENVIR:

I think in a hypo like that, in

10

most cases, if you have a proper relationship between the

11

client and counsel they will abide by the decision, that

12

they will have received what they thought they were going

13

to receive, that they were told by counsel they would

14

receive, that there were no appellate issues, and they

15

will not request the filing of a notice of appeal.

16

QUESTION:

Oh, I'm sure that's so, but you --

17

despite the fact that on the hypo there is, I guess we

18

could say as a matter of law there would be no relief, you

19

would still require the affirmative act of counsel.
MR. DENVIR:

20

I think, Your Honor, that since it

21

is the client's decision under both the Federal rules,

22

under Jones v. Barnes, counsel has to file the notice of

23

appeal.

The issue is whether relief is available.

MR. DENVIR:

Your Honor, because I don't think

the Court has at any point in any of its decisions,

Rodriquez, or Penson, or Evitts, any of those, required

6

that an unrepresented defendant prove that there were

7

meritorious issues.
The Court has not done that in any case at all,

9

and there was a concurring opinion joined by three

10

justices last year in Pigaro saying that there would be

unfair to do, and the reason is the practical reason that

MR. DENVIR:

9

Your Honor, because I think that

10

what caused the loss of the right to direct appeal was the

ineffective assistance of defense counsel, that regardless

12

of any advisement that was given by the court, there was a

13

factual finding that Mr. Flores-Ortega did not understand

what an appeal was, therefore there was no movement to

exercise the decision to have an appeal.

guidelines the same way the United States does?
MR. DENVIR:

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL E. O'CONNOR

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Thank you, Mr. Denvir.

MR. O'CONNOR:

6

First, with regard to the Harvey

7

issue, Harvey is a California case which states that a

8

sentencing court cannot rely on facts which are related

9

solely to accounts dismissed pursuant to a plea bargain.
However, in this case, the sentencing court

10
11

relied on facts that were related to the murder.

For

12

example, it relied on the fact that the respondent was

13

armed and the victim was not, and that's at J.A. 40, at

14

joint appendix, page 40.
Also, with respect to the Harvey issue, opposing

15
16

counsel mentioned that the prosecutor used -- factually

17

went into the *dismissed counts.

18

correct, it is irrelevant, because the Harvey standard

19

pertains to the trial court's actions and, again, the

20

trial court didn't rely on any facts solely related to the

21

dismissed counts.

Even assuming this is

With respect to the Alford issue, I'd like to

22

23

make two points.

First of all, Alford involved factual

24

innocence.

25

This is not the same claim in this case.

The defendant claimed he didn't shoot anyone.

57
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

In this case,

1

Mr. Ortega made the claim in his California supreme court

2

petition that he was only guilty of manslaughter.

3

then, manslaughter theory should have been pursued.

4

Well

Also, opposing counsel stated that a judge

5

taking the plea under Alford must resolve the conflict

6

between the guilty plea and the claim of innocence.

7

Actually, the trial judge did this in effect because the

8

defense attorney stated why the guilty plea was being

9

entered despite the claim of innocence.

10

This is at J.A.

26-27, pages 26-27 of the joint appendix.
The court asked, So, counsel, I understand that

11
12

this plea is made under People v. West, which is

13

California's analogue to Alford.

Is that correct?

14

Defense attorney, That is correct, and I did

15

write on the form, the change of plea form, and I went

16

over with Mr. Flores this morning numerous times the

17

explanation that was given for his change of plea, and

18

that is that if he goes to trial there was the risk that

19

he could be found guilty of crimes for which he could

20

receive more severe sentences, and that is the reason that

21

Mr. Flores is pleading guilty.

22

So there's the explanation for why the defendant

23

entered his plea despite his claims of innocence.

24

wanted to avoid a more severe sentence, and Alford allows

25

that.

1

Mr. O'Connor, do you agree on the

2

basic proposition that a trial counsel or, in this case,

3

plea and sentencing counsel, does have an obligation to

4

explain to the defendant what an appeal is and what his

5

rights are?
And then switching from the question of whether

6

7

a notice has to be filed, is there an obligation to advise

8

the defendant about an appeal?

9

MR. O'CONNOR:

Well, Your Honor, there's an

10

obligation under only two circumstances.

11

defendant inquires about appeal rights, and then secondly

12

where there are circumstances indicating the defendant may

13

benefit from such advice.

14

QUESTION:

First, where the

MR. O'CONNOR:

In that

circumstance the question would be, are there

23

circumstances indicating the defendant could benefit from

appeal advice, and that question boils down to the issue

of whether there were grounds, or more specifically
