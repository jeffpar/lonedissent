ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD P. HOGAN, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. HOGAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The parties in this case advocate different

12

accrual rules for civil RICO, and that difference is

13

starkly illustrated by the way that the parties view two

14

important dates in the record.

15

when the plaintiff was released from a mental institution

16

after 479 days of confinement.

17

when the plaintiff learned that the company that was

18

operating that institution had pled guilty to Federal

19

fraud and conspiracy charges for a scheme that included

20

paying kick-backs to doctors for keeping the patient

21

census high.

22

The first date is 1986,

The second date is 1994,

The Defendants contend that the civil RICO claim

23

in this case had accrued for the statute of limitations

24

purposes and that the statute had begun to run in 1986,

25

when the plaintiff was released from the hospital, and
3

1

that therefore the statute of limitations had expired by

2

1990, 4 years before the Federal Government had even

3

announced the guilty pleas.

4

The plaintiff, on the other hand, argues that

5

the RICO claim did not accrue until 1994, when he first

6

learned that the hospitalization was related to a pattern

7

of racketeering activity, and the question then presented

8

for the Court is which accrual rule is proper for civil

9

RICO.

10
11

QUESTION:

MR. HOGAN:

13

QUESTION:

MR. HOGAN:

16

QUESTION:

18

No, Your Honor.
Why couldn't we use the accrual rule

that is used for the Clayton Act?

15

17

I

mean, do we have to pick between only those two?

12

14

Well, there could be a third.

Your Honor -Namely the time the injury occurs,

whether you know about it or not.
MR. HOGAN:

The template that the Court would

19

take from the Clayton Act, Your Honor, would not fit for

20

civil RICO and, as this Court recognized in Klehr, the

21

pure injury accrual rule, it suggested, might not work

22

without some modification in the situation of civil RICO,

23

unlike the antitrust laws, because the antitrust laws

24

require only separate and discrete single acts and not a

25

pattern of racketeering activity, and so it's okay for the
4

1

antitrust laws to use an injury accrual rule.
We simply suggest to the Court that it does not

2
3

reach this question, because the pattern of racketeering

4

activity is absent in the antitrust laws when it is

5

present in civil RICO.
QUESTION:

6

Well, perhaps the rule could be the

7

injury plus the existence of a cause of action, which

8

means there has to have been a pattern, and I suppose that

9

principles of equitable estoppel might be available in

10

circumstances where the pattern was undiscoverable due to

11

conduct of the defendants.
MR. HOGAN:

12

But equitable estoppel principles,

13

Your Honor, also will not work, we suggest, for civil

14

RICO.

15

sort of equitable estoppel principles or other equitable

16

tolling principles suggests that there are harsh facts

17

which might require those types of remedies, but we think

18

that the rule ought to address those things up front, as

19

this Court suggested in the Beggerly decision.

Obviously, the suggestion that we might need some

QUESTION:

20

Well, but in some cases you're going

21

to have affirmative concealment, and the equitable tolling

22

would address that and let the other things be governed by

23

the normal rule.
MR. HOGAN:

24
25

But that would be unworkable,

because -5

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. HOGAN:

Why?
-- the equitable tolling principles

3

that would involve fraudulent concealment require

4

affirmative acts or affirmative conduct on the part of the

5

defendant to conceal the cause of action,

6

defendant does nothing, as in this case, simply does not

7

speak and remains mute, the plaintiff would be unable to

8

take advantage of any equitable tolling.
QUESTION:

9
10

you mean is,

Well, you say it won't work.

What

it doesn't help you in this case.

MR. HOGAN:

11

so that if the

It -- Your Honor,

it does not work,

12

and there is not a single case cited in any of the briefs

13

in which equitable tolling has been recognized to apply

14

for civil RICO.
QUESTION:

15

I thought Posner has a long decision

16

in which he explains all this, and he goes into it, and I

17

thought, well, if your complaint is fraudulent concealment

18

versus equitable tolling, we could work that out in some

19

other case.

20

The basic principle is, the statute of

21

limitation starts to run, and an unfair result is stopped

22

by principles of fraudulent concealment like the antitrust

23

law, or equitable tolling, as in fraud.

24

problem.

25

So you tell me it is a problem.
6

It isn't a

What's the

1

problem?
MR. HOGAN:

2

Those -- the problem is that it's an

3

indefinite period.

4

informs the parties of how long -QUESTION:

5

An equitable tolling period never

But that's viewed as an advantage,

6

not a problem.

The reason it's an advantage is because,

7

if a person discovers the thing after only a year, he gets

8

an extra year.

He doesn't get an extra 4 years.

MR. HOGAN:

9

QUESTION:

10

But -So they certainly argue that that --

11

what you just called is a problem is the best thing about

12

it.

13

MR. HOGAN:

Well, but it would not -- it would

14

defeat the purposes of predictability and certainty that

15

should be an aspect --

16

QUESTION:

Oh, no, no.

All you'd have to say

17

is,

18

You'd have to be reasonably diligent, and if they're not

19

aware of what that is, well, that's their problem.

20

stay on your toes.

MR. HOGAN:

That's all.

Stay on your toes.

It seems that that problem ought to

21

be dealt with on the front end, and instead of closing the

22

courthouse door to plaintiffs and forcing them to take on

23

the additional burden of opening that door after it has

24

been closed with no determination and no information for

25

the circuit courts to apply as to how long that period
7

1

ought to last, that it would be better to deal with the

2

harsh results and the equities within the knew or should-

3

have -known standard, and tell everyone that within that

4

standard there is a 4-year limitations period.

5

QUESTION:

Well, there are equities on both

6

sides of a statute of limitations case.

7

memories fade,

8

happened, you know,

9

you -- I agree there are equities on the plaintiff's side.

10
11

You know,

it's harder to find out what actually
10 years later than 2 years later, so

There are also equities on the defendant's side.
MR. HOGAN:

That's correct, and we suggest that

12

Congress in this case has opted to tip that balance in the

13

favor of the plaintiffs, that the open-endedness that

14

might exist because of the knew or should-have-known

15

standard ought to be resolved because Congress looked at a

16

10-year window in which predicate acts could happen, and

17

the balance of the equities ought to rest in the favor of

18

the plaintiffs.

19

QUESTION:

I don't understand why we don't just

20

apply the Clayton Act.

21

established that this thing is modeled after that.

22

don't we just apply the Clayton Act rule?

23

understood your response to that.

24
25

MR. HOGAN:

I mean, you know, we've

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. HOGAN:

3

Right.
RICO requires a pattern, and in the

Clayton Act context --

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. HOGAN:

So what is -- and therefore?
And therefore the injuries that are

6

remedied by the Clayton Act don't relate to anything that

7

has the nature of a pattern of racketeering activity.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. HOGAN:

10
11

QUESTION:

MR. HOGAN:

13

QUESTION:

15
16

So Congress -What follows from that?

Why does

that prevent you from using the same statute rule?

12

14

So what?

What follows -When the injury occurs from a

pattern, boom, there's a cause of action.
MR. HOGAN:

The injury must tell the plaintiff

that there was a pattern.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. HOGAN:

19

QUESTION:

Why?
Because otherwise -The injury under the Clayton Act

20

doesn't have to tell the plaintiff that there was an

21

antitrust conspiracy.

^2

MR. HOGAN:

Because Congress has used the

23

language that the injury is by reason of a violation of

24

section 1962, which is a pattern of racketeering --

25

QUESTION:

No, but it may simply be that the
9

1

RICO injury, that there is no RICO injury for your client.

2

I mean,

3

necessarily intended that the cause, that in effect a

4

plaintiff will have at least a 10-year,

5

suspension to determine whether there's a cause of action.

6

There's a simpler answer, and the simpler answer

I think your argument assumes that Congress

I guess 14-year

7

is, maybe what Congress intended was that if you do not

8

have the second predicate act within the 4 years, there is

9

no RICO cause of action.

10

QUESTION:

Or indeed, Congress may even have

11

intended that there is no RICO cause of action when you

12

are harmed by the first predicate act, even if there later

13

is a second one, because at the time the first act occurs,

14

there has been no pattern, and you have not been injured

15

by a pattern.

16

MR. HOGAN:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

But that interpretation -It's only the person harmed by the

second predicate act who's injured by a pattern.
MR. HOGAN:

Your Honor, that would render the

20

statutory language meaningless.

21

language in section 1964(c)

22

business or property by reason of a violation of section

23

1962, Congress meant that that violation was from a

24

pattern of racketeering, and in this case --

25

QUESTION:

When Congress used the

that a person injured in his

No cause of action until there's a
10

1

pattern.

2

MR. HOGAN:

3

QUESTION:

4

That's correct.
No cause of action until the second

predicate act.
MR. HOGAN:

5

But for statute of limitations

6

purposes there must be some discovery principle attached

7

to that, because until -QUESTION:

8

9

Well, in that connection, let me just

ask you this question.

Supposing you didn't learn about

10

the guilty plea until 2001, would the statute start to run

11

in 2001?

12

MR. HOGAN:

Yes.

It would start to run even

13

though it's open-ended, because Congress meant in this

14

case, we suggest, to have a tipping of the balance in the

15

favor of the plaintiff,

16

recognized before, simply because the secretive and hidden

17

enterprise is good at concealing the predicate acts and

18

its enterprise from being detected, that ought not to work

19

against the plaintiff.

so in that case, as this Court has

20

QUESTION:

21

the antitrust area.

22

they go to the cash register, and they pay $10.

23

don't necessarily know that the reason it's $10 instead of

24

$8 is because there was a price-fixing conspiracy.

25

MR. HOGAN:

It does work against the plaintiff in
People all the time buy products,
They

But for two reasons that antitrust

7

the road.
MR. HOGAN:

9

QUESTION:

in most antitrust

They are somehow informed, or

No, they don't know there was a price

They bought the asphalt.

8

10

First of all,

They're down there laying

That's right.
They didn't know there was a price

fix for years.
MR. HOGAN:

11

But at least -- and the second

12

reason is, but at least, if there is a separate, overt act

13

later on, which also damages them, under the separate

14

accrual rule in antitrust they would get a new cause of

15

action starting from that date forward, whereas in RICO,

16

if the second predicate act falls outside the 4-year

17

period suggested by Justice Scalia's question, then there

18

would be no remedy for the RICO plaintiff.

19

QUESTION:

Are you sure?

Suppose there's a

20

pattern that falls outside the period.

21

pattern?

22

MR. HOGAN:

Isn't it a new

It is a new pattern which this Court

23

rejected in the accrual -- there is a new pattern, but the

24

statute would not run anew from the last predicate act, as

25

this Court said in Klehr.

It doesn't start over, as it
12

1

does in the antitrust context, and so for those reasons

2

the antitrust analogy we think, although it fits for the

3

injury, and it fits for the statute of limitations period,

4

does not fit for the purposes of accrual.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Hogan, do you know of another

6

instance where, Congress being silent on the limit, the

7

Court picks as the closest analogy, as it did here, the

8

Clayton Act, and then takes the starting trigger from some

9

place else?

10

MR. HOGAN:

11

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Those two ordinarily would go

12

together, the statute of limitations and its

13

accoutrements.

14

you get the limitation period from the Clayton Act, and

15

then you get the starting trigger from some place else.

16

But here you're splitting them.

MR. HOGAN:

Yes.

You say,

You get the starting trigger

17

that would allow the purposes of the statute to be

18

remedied, and the closest analogy is the fraud analogy.

19
20

21

QUESTION:

But then why borrow from the Clayton

Act at all?
MR. HOGAN:

We borrow from the Clayton Act to

22

inform us what the statutory period is, and tell us how

23

big the hourglass is.

24
25

QUESTION:

But it isn't the statutory period if

you have a different accrual -13

1

QUESTION:

Why didn't we --

2

QUESTION:

-- trigger.

3

QUESTION:

-- borrow from fraud analogy for

4
5

purposes of determining what the statutory period was?
MR. HOGAN:

Because in Malley-Duff this Court

6

said that when it looked to those State limitations

7

periods for fraud, they were divergent and not uniform,

8

and this Court therefore said that the closest analogy for

9

the limitations period is the Clayton Act, and so the 4-

10

year limitations period, but the fraud analogy is what

11

works best for the accrual rule.

12

Just as in the case of fraud, when something is

13

concealed from the plaintiff, the statute doesn't accrue

14

until the plaintiff knows, or reasonably should know --

15

QUESTION:

Well, those are two different things.

16

If you say there's affirmative concealment, that's

17

traditional equitable tolling, but are you going further

18

and saying that even if there isn't affirmative

19

concealment the statute doesn't begin running until the

20

plaintiff knows about it?

21

MR. HOGAN:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

That's correct.
Well, that's going a good deal

further than saying you're just fighting concealment.
MR. HOGAN:

But no further than it takes to

recognize the existence of the cause of action.
14

Without

1

the pattern in RICO, you may have an underlying fraud

2

case, or you may have some sort of common law claim for

3

the underlying predicate act, but you would not have a

4

RICO cause of action.

5

The only thing that informs the plaintiff of the

6

existence of a RICO case and transforms the injury into a

7

RICO injury is the existence of the pattern, and the

8

conduct of the enterprise through the pattern, otherwise,

9

it's a simple, ordinary tort case.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. HOGAN:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

Well -It is not a RICO case.
When do you say the pattern came into

existence here?
MR. HOGAN:

Your Honor, the record is not clear

15

about that, but we can assume for purposes of argument

16

that it existed while Mr. Rotella was in the hospital,

17

before 1986.

18

There is also another predicate act which the

19

record reveals, was the signing of a contract in 1990, but

20

we can assume that it existed as of 1986.

21
22

23

QUESTION:

So we're not talking about a pattern

that just came together after the actual injury?
MR. HOGAN:

For purposes of the argument,

24

that --we can assume that.

25

plaintiff's mind, nor, shall I say, for the purposes of

But what did not exist in the

15

1

the FBI or the Federal Government, was that they did not

2

know that that conduct in paying out insurance benefits

3

that were depleted from the plaintiff's insurance policy,

4

they did not know that that conduct was being engaged in

5

through a pattern of racketeering and was being taken from

6

the plaintiff in violation of RICO.

7
8

QUESTION:

cause of action for this, wouldn't you?

9
10

MR. HOGAN:

Your Honor, we -- no.

We would have

certainly ordinary tort remedies --

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. HOGAN:

13

QUESTION:

14

You'd have a perfectly good State

Yes.
-- maybe under fraud.
Yes, not treble damages or attorney's

fees, but a traditional tort action.

15

MR. HOGAN:

Exactly.

If it were meaningful to

16

pursue,

17

in the same way that he didn't know that there was a RICO

18

violation committed, Mr. Rotella also did not know that

19

any fraud was being committed against him.

20

if he knew that there was a fraud committed, but

QUESTION:

Suppose I'm injured by some -- by

21

someone else, and do I have to -- it could have been by

22

negligence, and it could have been intentional.

23

find out, you know,

24

Does the statute on the intentional tort not run until I

25

find out that it was intentional?

I only

5 years later that it was intentional.

16

Of course not.

1

MR. HOGAN:

2

QUESTION:

No, of course not.
On both of them, you don't have to

3

know what the precise nature of the injury is ordinarily.

4

You just have to know you've been injured.

5

MR. HOGAN:

6

QUESTION:

But if we say -And here you say,

I have to know not

7

only if these doctors injured me, but that they injured me

8

by reason of a pattern.

9

doesn't track normal law as far as I know.

10

MR. HOGAN:

Why?

I don't -- that just

Because in an intentional tort case,

11

Justice Scalia, there is a recognized common law accrual

12

doctrine that would have applied to that.

13

been a recognized common law accrual doctrine that would

14

apply in the context of the language that this Court has

15

been supplied by Congress.

16

QUESTION:

There has never

I understand that, but when we supply

17

that doctrine, when we invent that doctrine, why should it

18

be so radically different from the normal common law,

19

which is that you have to know that you're injured?

20

don't have to know the precise nature of the injury,

21

whether it's negligent or intentional, whether it's the

22

result of a pattern or not the result of a pattern.

23

That's sort of picky-picky.

24

MR. HOGAN:

25

QUESTION:

You

The tradition -We usually don't do that for statutes
17

1

2

of limitation.
MR. HOGAN:

It is not picky, as this Court

3

recognized in the Holmberg decision in 1946, to say that

4

until the plaintiff actually discovers the fraud he has

5

not discovered the cause of action and cannot sue on it,

6

and the Court ought not to reward the wrong-doer simply

7

because the wrong-doer --

8

9

QUESTION:

Suppose you did this.

Suppose you

had three rules, a), statute doesn't start to run until

10

the pattern is there.

11

all right, so you absolutely say that.

12

2), the plaintiff has to know that he's hurt, all right,

13

and then you say, 3), as to the rest of it, there will be

14

what Posner defines as equitable tolling, which permits a

15

plaintiff to avoid the bar of the statute if, despite all

16

due diligence, he is unable to obtain vital information

17

bearing on the existence of his claim.

18
19
20

All the elements have to be there,

So those are your rules.

And then you say,

Can you give me one

instance of any injustice that would work?
MR. HOGAN:

It would work an injustice in this

21

case because the plaintiff would not be able to take

22

advantage of any sort of equitable tolling doctrine,

23

because there is no affirmative conduct on the --

24
25

QUESTION:

I read you what the definition of

equitable tolling is right out of that opinion, which had
18

1

a fairly thorough survey.

2

requirement that the defendant have engaged in affirmative

3

conduct.

4

saying,

5

instance of injustice?

6

On that definition, there is no

I'm not saying that would be the law.

I'm

if it were the law, can you think of a single

MR. HOGAN:

Yes.

It would be unjust, and would

7

be impractical, not to have informed the plaintiff that he

8

ought to be looking for something.

9

years after the last predicate act happened, or 10 years

10

after the injury had occurred he might have learned that

11

he was injured, but until he comes into possession of

12

13

racketeering, he doesn't know of the existence of the

14

cause of action.

15

He might discover 10

And then it is merely a question of whether the

16

courts would allow the plaintiff to undertake some sort of

17

an equitable tolling and start the statute of limitations

18

over again, and again, Congress has resolved that concern

19

in favor of the plaintiff,

20

must undertake a diligent discovery within a known 4-year

21

period, rather than saying the courthouse door is closed

22

and the plaintiff, if he gets lucky, might later on be

23

able to reopen that door.

24
25

in favor of the plaintiff who

And so as a matter of policy, it seems that the
court ought to take that into consideration on the front

1

end, rather than hoping that on some sort of chance, or on

2

some sort of a possibility that later on the plaintiff

3

will be able to get into court, that the doctrine would

4

work through an equitable tolling principle.

5

QUESTION:

You know,

I don't -- I'm not really

6

smitten by the equitable tolling possibility, even.

7

There's certainly no such thing under the Clayton Act, and

8

the fact is that the situation of your client is even less

9

appealing than the situation of someone harmed under the

10

Clayton Act, because your client, even if he doesn't have

11

a cause of action under RICO, will have some other cause

12

of action for the harm.

13

Now, maybe the damages won't be as much, and the

14

intimidation won't be as much as bringing -- you know,

15

calling somebody a racketeer under RICO, but he'll have a

16

cause of action, whereas the antitrust plaintiff has

17

nothing at all, and he doesn't get equitable tolling.

18

Much less does he get what you want, doesn't have to worry

19

about a cause of action until he finds out about it.

20

MR. HOGAN:

Your Honor, our client would have no

21

cause of action.

How would he know that simply by paying

22

the doctors' bills, that they were taking that money out

23

of his insurance policy until it was -- until it was

24

rendered empty, until it was finished, and that he was

25

paying those insurance benefits to the doctors not because
20

1

they were treating him for legitimate reasons, but because

2

they wanted to bilk out the insurance policy.
QUESTION:

3

Well, under State law,

is there any

4

doctrine that if your injury is not immediately

5

discernible because it's consistent with adequate

6

treatment, that the injury discovery arises only when you

7

find out that there has been maltreatment?

8
9
10

MR. HOGAN:

Well, certainly the latent injury

cases, or the foreign object cases would encompass that,
but in this case what you essentially have is --

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. HOGAN:

Would this case come within that?
No,

it wouldn't.

In this case, you

13

have a fraud situation where the plaintiff is in the

14

ordinary course of business going along, being treated,

15

paying bills.

16

that is being done fraudulently, or that that is being

17

done to him because --

He does not know, nor could he know, that

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. HOGAN:

20

QUESTION:

I understand that.
Yes.
But under common State discovery

21

rules, that there would be no exception to the discovery

22

of injury.

23

the statute under State law?

24
25

The injury was being confined, and that begins

MR. HOGAN:

Not for the nature of the cause of

action that the plaintiff would want to undertake.
21

It

would be in the nature of a fraud cause of action.

he discovers the fraud.

He would have a State cause of

That's right.
And then he would have also -So in that respect he's much better

off than the Clayton Act plaintiff.

MR. HOGAN:

16

So he would have a State cause of

MR. HOGAN:

15

As soon as he discovers the fraud.

10

12

Well, which he could bring as soon as

Well, then -Who typically has no cause of action

at all when he finally discovers -MR. HOGAN:

Well, first, at that point, when he

17

discovers the fraud he'd have a certain 4-year period in

18

which to bring the cause of action.

19

But secondly, in the Clayton Act example that

20

Your Honor is referring to, the Clayton Act plaintiff, if

21

he were injured again, or if the Clayton Act conspiracy

22

were working to its best efforts and had injured him

23

again, he would get a cause of action upon each injury.

24
25

QUESTION:

Anyway, I think the Clayton Act

plaintiff does have -- he does have a -- he can sue if
22

1

it's fraudulently concealed.

2

MR. HOGAN:

3

QUESTION:

That's correct.
All right.

Now, you've looked up all

4

these cases,

5

want to ask you, and it is relevant,

6

difference in practice between fraudulent concealment and

7

equitable tolling?

10

is there really any

I know that the language is different, but I

8
9

I gather, and I've always wondered this, so I

never heard of a price fix that they wouldn't try to
conceal.

I mean, they don't want to advertise it.

11

MR. HOGAN:

12

QUESTION:

Well,

I --

I imagine the same is true of fraud

13

defendants.

14

and so does it really make -- is your impression, after

15

reading a lot of this, that it matters whether we call it

16

fraudulent concealment and say the defendant has to have

17

acted affirmatively?

18

MR. HOGAN:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

They don't want to advertise these things,

Well -Or do you call it equitable tolling

and say it's the plaintiff who has to have been diligent?
MR. HOGAN:

It matters to the extent that this

22

Court has always said those sorts of doctrines are very

23

limited, very narrow exceptions to the limitations accrual

24

rules, and they are available, as this Court said in the

25

Irwin case, only very sparingly; only in very limited
23

1

circumstances do they apply.
The fraudulent concealment equitable estoppel,

2
3

equitable tolling distinction in that regard makes no

4

difference.

I --

QUESTION:

5

Well, in Holmberg, which you cited,

6

there there was an allegation that there had been

7

affirmative concealment, was there not?
MR. HOGAN:

8
9

concealment, yes, Your Honor, there was.
QUESTION:

10
11

There was some affirmative

Well, that's what the court is

talking about, isn't it?
MR. HOGAN:

12

Well, to the extent that the

13

affirmative concealment kept the plaintiff from

14

discovering it, that could be read as either a fraud case

15

or a fraudulent concealment case.
QUESTION:

16

Would you accept that as a basis for

17

a statute of limitations where there has been concealment,

18

or, you know, that the statute didn't run until it was

19

discovered?
MR. HOGAN:

20
21

work well for RICO.

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

That sort of a doctrine wouldn't

Well,

it wouldn't help you,

I think,

yes.
MR. HOGAN:

That's correct, it wouldn't help us,

because certainly in Mr. Rotella's case there was no
24

1

affirmative conduct by the defendants in this case to

2

conceal the fact that they were taking money from him.

3

There was an attempt, however,

4

had no
QUESTION:

later on to say that they

MR. HOGAN:

10

They have to be

Concealing the wrongdoing, which we

say cannot be uncoupled in the case of RICO from the
pattern of racketeering activity.
This Court has said,

11

in the Malley-Duff opinion,

12

that the pattern of racketeering is the heart of any RICO

13

complaint.

14

In the H.J. Inc. case this Court said --

QUESTION:

I don't understand why you say that

17

ago wouldn't be -- satisfy the fraudulent concealment

MR. HOGAN:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. HOGAN:

We say because -I think it would.
As Judge Posner has analyzed those

22

cases, and as this Court cited in his opinion in the Cada

23

case, which was quoted in Klehr, there has to be,

24

case of fraudulent concealment, some sort of affirmative

25

conduct on the part of the defendant.

QUESTION:

2

MR. HOGAN:

Correct.
Now,

let's take this case and look

3

at the practicalities of how that might work.

Let's

4

suppose that for some reason Mr. Rotella had discovered

5

before 1990, or had suspected before 1990 that he might

6

have some sort of a RICO case, and he had walked into a

7

lawyer's office and sat down and said, you know,

my doctors are taking money from me in furtherance of a

9

criminal enterprise.

I think

If the lawyer didn't at first suggest that he go

back to the hospital because of some paranoid fantasy, he

might say, well,

would he allege?

QUESTION:

Well, the answer is then he's using

due diligence and the statute was tolled,

off either way, and I can't imagine,

22

so he's no worse

if what you allege is

MR. HOGAN:

But he ought not to be penalized if

he did not really know, nor could have known of the

24

existence of the particular acts --

Well, but you're omitting the fact,

supposing the guilty plea had been entered the day before

he walked into the office --

MR. HOGAN:

QUESTION:

5

If the --- and the record of that proceeding

gave rise to suspicion about all these facts.
MR. HOGAN:

6

If that happened, then he'd be into

7

a 4-year accrual period which would start with the release

8

of that criminal guilty plea 1 day before he walked into

9

the lawyer's office.
QUESTION:

10

No,

I'm supposing -- I'm suggesting

11

that maybe the record or the publicity attending the

12

guilty plea put him on notice that there had been

13

fraudulent concealment for the preceding 10 years.

14

he would -- he'd be able to satisfy the fraudulent

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES T. FRAZIER, JR.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

7

9

MR. FRAZIER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The majority of circuits have decided that the

10

most appropriate accrual rule for civil RICO is that same

11

discovery of injury rule that Federal courts apply to

12

civil claims in general.

13

begins to run when all elements of a cause of action exist

14

and the plaintiff discovers, or reasonably should have

15

discovered his injury.

16

Under that rule, limitations

This rule is particularly logical for civil RICO

17

for three reasons.

18

19

used for decades for Federal claims, and works in various

circumstances with various facts.

First,

Secondly,

it has been

Is that the Clayton Act rule?
No, Your Honor.

You don't argue in favor of the

Clayton Act rule?
MR. FRAZIER:

We would accept the Clayton Act
28

1

rule, Your Honor, because we would prevail with that rule.

2

QUESTION:

Yes,

3

MR. FRAZIER:

4

QUESTION:

I understand.

That's why --

And --

And we've said that this statute is

5

modeled after the Clayton Act, but you don't argue that we

6

should use the same statute as the Clayton Act.

7

MR. FRAZIER:

That is correct, Your Honor.

8

Because of the breadth and the variety of the predicate

9

acts in section 1951 --

10

QUESTION:

11

breadth than the Clayton Act.

12

Like RICO, we should give it more

MR. FRAZIER:

Because of the variety of

13

predicate acts, as well as the balancing test.

14

mentioned earlier, we are balancing the right, the merits

15

of having valid claims brought to court and adjudicated on

16

one hand, as well as the societal interest of repose, and

17

the interest of defendants as well as the courts to not

18

litigate stale claims.

19

As was

The injury-in-pattern discovery rule advanced by

20

Mr. Rotella would result in claims being brought far into

21

the future, and what's at issue here is, what should we

22

expect of plaintiffs in their civil justice system?

23

There are two philosophical differences between

24

the two rules, and that is, what should a plaintiff, a

25

reasonably diligent plaintiff do upon discovery of his
29

1

injury?

2

rule, would require the plaintiff to exercise diligence,

3

as the Federal courts have applied for a long period of

4

time, that the discovery of injury is sufficient to induce

5

a reasonably diligent plaintiff to investigate, to find

6

the cause, to find the person, the perpetrator, all the

7

elements necessary to --

11

The rule that we advance, the injury discovery

QUESTION:

What was the injury here that should

have been discovered, and when should it have been
discovered?
MR. FRAZIER:

Your Honor, the injury pursuant to

12

the complaint, since we're dealing with the complaint

13

allegation, the injury that was alleged on page 20 of the

14

joint appendix, at paragraph 28,

15

personal items were converted, they were withheld at the

16

time of his discharge.

17

allegation of a property injury in the complaint.

18

is that Mr. Rotella's

23

QUESTION:

It's a personal

He was treated improperly,
in tough

When should that have been

discovered?
MR. FRAZIER:

That was discovered, as the Fifth
30

1

Circuit found in the first Rotella appeal, during the

2

hospitalization.

3

At the time of discharge, he was aware of the

4

nature of his treatment, who the actors were, how he felt

5

about that treatment, and certainly that he had left

6

without his personal property, so that would have been,

7

Your Honor,

8

Brookhaven, and under the injury discovery rule we advance

9

the limitations period begins to run at that time, and he

in 1986,

in June, when he was discharged from

had 4 years to investigate, to act with diligence to bring

11

his claim, which he eventually --

12

QUESTION:

But Mr. Frazier --

13

QUESTION:

He didn't know he had a RICO claim at

14

that time.

15

mean, if we're going to abandon the Clayton Act rule,

16

think what your opponent offers is a much fairer rule than

17

the one that you offer for the bringing of a RICO action.

18

All he knew was that he had some claim.

MR. FRAZIER:

I
I

Your Honor, the discovery of a

19

pattern is just discovery of another element, and it would

20

not be fair because it would extend -- it would allow

21

plaintiffs to know their injury, or when they should have

22

known their injury, but not bring a suit until they

23

discover --

24
25

QUESTION:

But Mr. Frazier,

I think that's not

quite right, because built into the discovery of the
31

1

pattern is, discovered in fact, or should have discovered,

2

so there's a diligence requirement built in there, too.

3

It isn't from when the pattern was discovered,

4

necessarily.

5

discovered, so I don't think that your appeal to diligence

6

is really working, since diligence is essential in the

7

second discovery, in the discovery rule that your opponent

8

is urging.

9

It's from when it should have been

MR. FRAZIER:

Well, there is a diligence

10

requirement in the knew or should have known with

11

diligence.

12

discovery of all elements of the cause of action, and yet

13

instead of bringing suit within a reasonable time,

14

4 years has expired, the plaintiff has another 4 years

15

when he knows all elements of his claim, when treble

16

damages are accumulating, to bring suit.

17
18

Discovery of a pattern is essentially

QUESTION:

if the

But the plaintiff doesn't know.

I

mean, the assumption is, he knows he's been hurt.

19

MR. FRAZIER:

20

QUESTION:

Yes.

But he doesn't know why and how.

As

21

soon as he knows why and how, he can state a claim, but

22

how can he, for example,

if he's pleading fraud, plead

23

that with particularity?

How can he state a claim for

24

relief under RICO without knowing, or at least without

25

having enough so that he should have known that there was
32

1

a pattern and practice of racketeering?
MR. FRAZIER:

2

3

Your Honor,

it deals with what a

plaintiff can discover in the 4 years.

4

If he has discovered his injury, and he

5

exercises diligence to investigate that, and has causes of

6

action to redress that injury, as Mr. Rotella did, and

7

pleads a case, and alleges facts, and through discovery

8

finds out that his injury was caused not only by invasion

9

of privacy or fraud -- or false imprisonment, as he

10

alleges here, he would have a RICO claim, the cases say,

11

as we cited in our brief, allow to relate back and to

12

amend and to assert with particularity, although the rule

13

has been modified since 1993 to allow that there may be

14

facts discovered.

15

But it's the diligence that we require of

16

plaintiffs once they know that they were injured, and he

17

knew of his injury, all of his injuries at the time of

18

discharge, but waited 8 years to file suit.

19

QUESTION:

What diligence are you talking about?

20

Are you saying,

21

there's been a RICO conspiracy but can't discover it, then

22

he will have a cause of action, that the statute will be

23

extended?

24
25

if he diligently tries to find whether

MR. FRAZIER:

-- and he exercises the diligence

that the Federal courts have required to find the cause,

and to find other elements of his claim,

6

fraudulent concealment, or he simply just cannot, by fault

have.

11

Yes, Justice O'Connor, that is the

No, Your Honor, no circuit has

12

Isn't that a red herring, or is it?

13

I mean,

never heard of an antitrust injury where you wouldn't know

it.

16

I thought that it might be a red herring because I

I mean, what it amounts to is, you pay more money.
I mean,

I can't say somebody couldn't make one

17

up, but I never -- I can't think of a case in which

18

there's an antitrust injury where the person was injured,

19

but he didn't know he was injured, because the injured

20

commonly is writing out a check, or usually cash,

21

know that you've written a check, or you know you bought

22

the toothpaste, so is this a real distinction or not?

23

more than you should be.

No, no, but -- that's not knowing the

have to know -- that's interesting.

you should have paid.

That's knowing the cause.

What is it?

MR. FRAZIER:
QUESTION:

10

Thank you, Mr. Chief --

As I understand your position, you

11

desire neither the Clayton Act rule nor the rule that

12

Justice O'Connor just described, but rather some third

13

rule.
MR. FRAZIER:

14
15

QUESTION:

17

MR. FRAZIER:

18
19

No, Justice O'Connor stated the

Which is what you assert.
Yes, that discovery of the

injury -QUESTION:

But I thought in your answer to me

20

you said that if he didn't know of the pattern, and could

21

not with due diligence have discovered the pattern, the

22

statute would not be running.

23
24
25

MR. FRAZIER:

No, Justice Scalia, I -- if I said

that, I misspoke.
QUESTION:

You did indeed say it, and it
36

1

2

perplexed me.

That's --

MR. FRAZIER:

Well, what I was saying is,

is

3

that if all elements exist, and a plaintiff discovers or

4

should discover his injury, that is the majority rule.

5

That is the majority rule, and he has the burden to

6

exercise diligence to bring a claim.

7
8

If, Justice Scalia, he does not discover
essential information within the 4-year period, which is
the equitable tolling doctrine by Chief -- by Justice

10

Posner in Wolin, then equitable tolling allows him to

11

bring the RICO claim within a reasonable time of

12

discovering that essential information, but the cause of

13

action for limitations has already accrued.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. FRAZIER:

All right, let's -The statute has begun to run.

date of the injury.

doesn't he?

20

Does he have a cause of action, or

MR. FRAZIER:

That is a substantive question,

21

Your Honor, that frankly the courts have not grappled

22

with, and --

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. FRAZIER:

25

QUESTION:

Oh, come on.
Yes --

I mean, the statute isn't violated
37

1

unless there are at least two predicate acts,

2

right?
MR. FRAZIER:

3

isn't that

A pattern is at a minimum two

4

predicate acts, but the Court in McCool indicated that you

5

might have an injury, just because you happen to be the

6

first person injured, that you might not -- that you might

7

still have redress if the pattern arose later, but -QUESTION:

8

9

Yes, and another way of construing

the statute is that you don't, that there --

10

MR. FRAZIER:

11

QUESTION:

Right.

-- is no RICO violation until the

12

second predicate act, and if you were injured beforehand,

whatever your injury is,

MR. FRAZIER:

That is an interpretation of the

because it does require a violation of 1962 --

16

18

it's not a RICO injury.

Okay, and --- which is a pattern.

That's not

the facts of this case.
QUESTION:

You don't have to take a position on

that in this case?
MR. FRAZIER:

That is correct, Your Honor,

22

because the pattern existed at the time of his discharge

23

in 1986 pursuant to his complaint, so all of the elements

24

of Mr. Rotella's RICO claim existed in June of 1986 and,

25

critically, he was aware of his open and obvious injury,
38

1

the retention of his personal items, and the Federal

2

courts have determined that notice of injury is sufficient

3

to place a reasonably diligent plaintiff on notice to

4

investigate to find out the other elements to plead the

5

claim, and we have a 4-year limitations period, and that

6

has been held to be --

7

QUESTION:

Is it correct that the issue we have

8

to decide is just when the cause of action accrues for

9

limitations purposes?

We don't have to decide what, if

10

anything, would toll the statute of limitations.

11

they separate questions?

12

MR. FRAZIER:

Aren't

Yes, Your Honor, but the injury

13

discovery rule that we posit does have the equitable

14

tolling, but in this case they did not stay with equitable

15

tolling pleadings.

16

case the only issue is, what is the accrual rule,

17

discovery of the injury, which he discovered in 1986, or

18

waiting until he knew or should have known --

And they abandoned those, but for this

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. FRAZIER:

21

QUESTION:

Right,

if there --

-- there was a pattern.
But if we agreed with you that the

22

cause of action accrued on the date you say, there

23

still -- maybe not in this case, but in the typical case

24

would remain open the issue whether there was tolling

25

either because of equitable tolling principles or,
39

1

alternatively, because of fraudulent concealment, which

2

may or may not boil down to the same thing.

3

But one -- I've always thought the burden was on

4

one party and the other burden was on the other party, but

5

that is -- we really aren't -- we don't have to decide

6

what,

7

a case like this if we adopt your rule on the date of

8

accrual.

9

if any, tolling might be available to a plaintiff in

MR. FRAZIER:

That is correct on the facts of

10

this case, Your Honor, but the equitable tolling doctrines

11

have been applied in the majority of circuits that have

12

applied the injury --

13

QUESTION:

Just as your rule has been applied,

14

but would you explain to me why it is, other than it makes

15

your argument easier, that having adopted the Clayton Act

16

statute of limitations, we should not adopt the Clayton

17

Act rule that the statute begins to run from the time of

18

injury, but should rather adopt the rule that you're

19

urging that it should run from the time of discovery of

20

the injury.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. FRAZIER:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

He's not advocating -No.

Yes, you are.

You're advocating that

it runs from the time of discovery of the injury.
MR. FRAZIER:

That is correct.
40

That is the

1
2

injury discovery rule that we are advocating.
QUESTION:

Why should we adopt that rather

3

than -- why do you think that is a better rule than the

4

Clayton Act rule?

5

MR. FRAZIER:

Because of the -- as I said

6

earlier, the variety, and the broad variety of predicate

7

acts, some 52 criminal statutes in nine State areas --

8

that are there, as well as we think it's --

9

QUESTION:

Why does that --

10

MR. FRAZIER:

11

QUESTION:

12

Why does that make any difference,

the wide variety of acts?

13

MR. FRAZIER:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

It's a more fair rule.

I don't understand.

Because --

There are a wide variety of acts that

can, you know, restrict trade as well.
MR. FRAZIER:

Uh-huh.

Well, under the Clayton

17

Act, of course, there are four primary areas, price­

18

fixing, and -- in the directorates, and all those.

19

Here we have four -- or 52 specifics that have

20

different elements, that have perhaps different injuries,

21

some more overt than others, and to account for that

22

variety, we just believe the more fair rule to balance

23

both sides of the equities --

24

QUESTION:

25

I frankly think that it is more

likely that you would not be aware of your injury in a
41

1

Clayton Act situation, these economic injuries that are

2

caused by a conspiracy, than it is that you would not be

3

aware of your injury in the typical RICO case that, you

4

know, that Congress had in mind, which was a case where

5

you're dealing with racketeers.

6

So as between the two,

I would think -- would

7

have thought the Clayton Act rule is a fortiori

8

appropriate here.
MR. FRAZIER:

9

Well, again, we would not be

10

upset, obviously,

11

because we would prevail.

if the Court were to adopt that rule,

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. FRAZIER:

14

QUESTION:

Well, this is an important issue.
It is.

And just because you -- it's good

15

enough for your case to adopt the middle rule, we're --

16

maybe we should have appointed an amicus to argue for the

17

lawyer who's going to be following you in the next case,

18

for whose client it is essential that he establish, not an

19

injury discovery rule, but an injury rule.

20

doesn't matter.

21

For you,

it

I understand that.

QUESTION:

We could appoint still another amicus

22

to argue equitable tolling in the case that comes after

23

that.

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. FRAZIER:

Well, these cases, of course, are
42

1

so fact-specific, but the injury discovery rule has been

2

applied broadly.
QUESTION:

3

I mean, if this is an important

4

issue, my colleagues having corrected me, and they may be

5

right on that, they've given the answer, haven't they,

6

that if,

7

paying the $2 but, rather, paying the $2 knowing that the

8

true price is $1.50,

9

require knowledge of that injury would often,

in fact, the injury in a Clayton Act case is not

if that is the injury, then to
if not

10

always require knowledge of the cause, namely the price

11

fix.

12

MR. FRAZIER:

13

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

But you don't want to cause that, and

14

therefore you get to, the injury alone is sufficient.

15

that's the explanation, the answer is, that isn't the kind

16

of problem involved in a typical RICO case.

17

problem is fraud.

18

MR. FRAZIER:

19

QUESTION:

The kind of

Yes.

It's just not that kind of problem in

20

a RICO case,

21

or the future lawyer to comment.

22

MR. FRAZIER:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. FRAZIER:

25

If

so I put that for your -- for you to comment,

Mm-hmm.

Or whoever.
Well, the majority or the largest

number of RICO claims do have a fraud element, as this
43

1

Court has noted, and even though the 1995 Private

2

Securities Litigation Act has taken out securities fraud

3

from RICO, which comprised in the 1985 ABA report, which

4

this Court has cited twice, the largest percentage of RICO

5

claims, there are still some claims based in fraud, and

6

the injury discovery rule we believe is a clearer

7

balancing test, particularly on the fraud-based claims.
But because of the -- in the Clayton Act, if I

8

9

may comment about that, as Justice O'Connor said in the

10

Shearson case, that the complexity of the Clayton Act is

11

about the same, or certainly not more than civil RICO, so

12

they're both complex statutes, but RICO is unique,

13

obviously, because of the pattern and because of the

14

variety of predicate acts, and that's why the injury

15

discovery rule has been applied.

16

All circuits applying an accrual rule, by the

17

way,

20

Clayton Act, and that's what we argued in the district

court and all through this case.

8

MR. FRAZIER:

9

Well,

would help all the parties.

I don't think the confusion
Because of the variety of

10

opinions, as this Court is well aware, below, that there

11

is such a diverse -- the split is 7-5,

12

you look at it, and it needs to be resolved, because these

13

RICO cases, of course, are still coming into the

14

courthouse.

15

6-6, depends on how

They're still coming in, and we just believe

16

that the injury discovery rule, which has been applied for

17

such a long period of time, deals with that more

18

effectively.

19

Let me address briefly the tolling issue,

20

that -- particularly in the reply brief, the petitioner

21

mentions that in U.S. v. Beggerly that somehow this Court

22

held that if a discovery rule is built into the accrual

23

rule, that equitable tolling does not apply, and that is

24

simply overstating the case.

25

tolling applies in all accrual rules, as this Court stated

It is not true.

46

Equitable

1

in Holmberg.
If the plaintiff -- to take care of the concern

2
3

of the petitioner,

if the plaintiff simply cannot discover

4

the essential information with diligence, and that's the

5

key, with diligence, then the courts have applied and can

6

apply equitable tolling to allow that person to bring suit

7

within a reasonable time after he discovers that essential

8

information.
That is available in this rule, and so the fear

9
10

of not knowing the pattern, and with the definition of

11

pattern, as this Court recognized in a Sedima footnote and

12

of course in H.J., being as nebulous and nefarious as it

13

is as to what that means, delaying accrual until a

14

plaintiff discovers the related acts and that it poses a

15

threat of continuous activity would just delay it way too

16

long.

17

And we need a firmly defined, easily applied

18

rule of accrual, as the Court in the Garcia case

19

mentioned, and the injury discovery rule is -- runs from a

20

more ascertainable, definite, and certain event, rather

21

than the nebulous pattern event, and so it's more

22

workable, and it has the balance of the parties --

23

QUESTION:

Do you think it's very certain to

24

know when a person discovered -- I mean, that's something

25

very interior, when did I know of it, or even when ought
47

1

to I have known, ought I to have known of a document.

2

you really think that's certain?

3

MR. FRAZIER:

4

QUESTION:

5

Do

It's certain --

If you want a certain rule, when the

injury occurs, that's pretty certain.
MR. FRAZIER:

That is -- yes, that is very

7

certain.

8

less certain than the injury existing, but it's certainly

9

more certain than discovery of pattern and what one must

10

Discovery of injury, obviously, made it perhaps

QUESTION:

11

Well, and I suppose it's analogous to

12

when State fraud causes of action accrue normally,

13

it,

isn't

injury discovery?
MR. FRAZIER:

14

State causes of action, Justice

15

O'Connor?

16

There are -- particularly in the medical malpractice field

17

it is discovery, or should have discovered, and not

18

existence, and I think it's usually discovery, because as

19

the supreme court in Texas has articulated,

20

inherently discoverable,

21

the accrual of tolling through injury discovery --

22

It's -- I can speak from Texas.

QUESTION:

It's varied.

if it's

then we will apply tolling, or

May I, just to satisfy my curiosity,

23

ask just one question about this particular case?

24

correct that in the RICO cause of action there is no

25

relief claim for the principal injury which this person
48

Is it

1

2

3
4

must have suffered, namely the impairment of his liberty?
MR. FRAZIER:

That is correct.

Under civil RICO

there -- you cannot recover for personal injury.
QUESTION:

It's business or property,

so he's

5

not claiming damages for the long period of time that he

6

may have unnecessarily been kept in the institution.

7

MR. FRAZIER:

The complaint, the vast majority

8

of the allegations in the complaint, Justice Stevens,

9

allege such an injury, but under RICO that is what he

10

cannot recover, and the prayer is so general it just says

11

actual damages within the court's jurisdiction, which

12

doesn't work either, but it's very vague.

13

correct, he can only recover the value,

14

after, now,

15

withheld his personal liberty deprivation, which is really

16

the gist of the case, as we said in our brief in

17

opposition to the petition for cert, that is really what

18

he is claiming his injury is from the RICO conspiracy.

19

But you're

I would assume

15 years, the value of the property that was

this long period of time, and that he wouldn't have been

24
25

insurance money,

in this

So that's his alleged injury as a proximate
result of this alleged conspiracy, but it's not
49

1

recoverable under RICO, only the injury to property, which

2

is vaguely tied to the predicate act, but that is his

3

injury.

4

So he doesn't really have, other than just small

5

injury to his personal property, a RICO injury, and the

6

bulk of his complaint is a personal injury complaint,

7

which is not recoverable.
So that Mr. Rotella waited 11 years to bring

8

9

this cause of action,

11 years after his discharge,

10

11 years after he knew his injury, all of his injuries,

11

demonstrates why the injury and pattern discovery rule

12

simply is not workable in the civil RICO context.

13
14

If the Court has no further questions, we
submit.

15

QUESTION:

16

Mr. Hogan, you have 4 minutes remaining.

17

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD P. HOGAN, JR.

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19
20
21

MR. HOGAN:

Thank you, Mr. Frazier.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Let me at the outset put to rest any notion that

22

we brought this claim to recover Mr. Rotella's personal

23

effects, because this case is not about recovering his

24

tennis shoes or his blue jeans that were taken from him

25

when he checked into the hospital.
50

This case is about whether RICO is a

1

2

supplemental remedy in addition to State tort causes of

3

action, and it is about whether this Court will adhere to

4

the traditional recovery rule that injury plus its cause

5

must be known before the cause of action accrues, and it

6

is thirdly about whether equitable tolling will apply, and

7

that's the point at which I'd like to begin my remarks.
Because equitable tolling is supposed to be only

8
9

the exception and not the rule, if,

in fact, equitable

10

tolling becomes the doctrine on which plaintiffs rely in

11

every RICO case, then it is no longer the exception, it is

12

the core RICO case.

13

plaintiff did not know and could not have known of the

14

existence of a RICO injury until the Federal indictments

15

were announced.

16
17
18

This is a core RICO case, where the

So if you have plaintiffs pleading in every
case -QUESTION:

But you have a -- let us suppose that

19

we think the equitable tolling doctrine requires

20

affirmative concealment,

21

you rely on.

22

of cases you just described, when you -- if you require

23

affirmative concealment.

24
25

as there was in Holmberg, which

That certainly is going to narrow the class

MR. HOGAN:

No, Your Honor.

It would only

narrow the plaintiff's ability to take advantage of that
51

1
2

doctrine.
What we submit is that plaintiffs will be

3

pleading this right and left to get into court, because

4

they will not be able to discover the inherently secretive

5

and concealed nature of the RICO enterprises that they

6

claim have been the perpetrators of the pattern of

7

racketeering, and if those things are secretive by nature,

8

and plaintiffs must often plead the equitable tolling

9

doctrine, then it makes much more sense to incorporate the

10

knew-or-should-have-known standard of equity within the

11

accrual rule itself, and then give everybody a predictable

12

4-year limitations period in which to bring suit.

13

The defendants have argued in this case that

14

there is no ability, there is no problem of practicality,

15

that plaintiffs would not have a problem simply pleading

16

a RICO claim, going and doing discovery, and finding out

17

the existence of the enterprise, but, of course, what

18

would be the first response of every defendant should a

19

plaintiff plead that sort of a claim?

20

It would be, Your Honor, the plaintiff is

21

engaging in a fishing expedition.

22

claim to this, and there is only a fishing expedition to

23

try and find a RICO claim.

24
25

There is no related

We submit that the Court ought to decline the
invitation to reconstitute the civil RICO cause of action
52

1

in the guise of adopting and defining a limited accrual

2

rule, and that this Court ought to recognize that the

3

distinctive nature of RICO is its pattern requirement,

4

without which there is no RICO claim, and to that extent,

5

should the Court recognize that the pattern element is the

6

core of RICO and that equitable doctrines must be

7

incorporated within the rule itself, we submit that the

8

Court therefore ought to reverse and remand this case.
