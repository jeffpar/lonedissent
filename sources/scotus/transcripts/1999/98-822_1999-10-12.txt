ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE J. TERRIS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. TERRIS:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The district court in this case, after two

11
12

trials,

13

Act 1,412 times.

14

had come in the immediate 6 months before the complaint

15

was filed, and another 36 of the violations came after the

16

complaint was filed.

violations and it sought injunctive relief.

18

found that Laidlaw had violated the Clean Water
One hundred and thirty of those times

The complaint alleged ongoing

Five years -- three -- five years later, after

19

the complaint had been filed, the district court found

20

that there was no long -- that Laidlaw was in substantial

21

compliance and therefore there was no need at that point

22

to issue injunctive relief.

23

of $405,000,

24
25

Instead, it imposed a penalty

specifically to deter future violations.

Six years after the suit was filed, the Fourth
Circuit held,

solely because injunctive relief was no

longer in the case,

2

moot, and that attorney's fees would not be payable to the

3

plaintiff.

4

such a perverse result.

5

that the case had to be dismissed as

We submit that Article III does not compel

The plaintiffs submit that, even though the

6

civil penalty is payable to the United States Treasury,

7

that plaintiffs benefited from the imposition of a penalty

8

because penalties deter future violations.
QUESTION:

9

Well,

I guess what happened, perhaps,

10

was the district court handled this at a time before we'd

11

handed down Steel Company.
MR. TERRIS:

12

13

That's correct, Your Honor.

Steel

Company came --

14

QUESTION:

And the Fourth Circuit reviewed it

15

after that case had come down, and apparently placed some

16

reliance on that, right?

17

MR. TERRIS:

18

QUESTION:

19

It relied solely on Steel Company.
Yes.

That seems to be what happened

in effect.

20

MR. TERRIS:

21

QUESTION:

22

That seems to be --

That there -So it boils down to what we meant in

Steel Company --

I think that's correct, and I think

1

it also involves what the relationship of Steel Company is

2

to this Court's prior decision in Gwaltney, because our

3

argument is that Gwaltney is precisely this case.

4

QUESTION:

Well, except Gwaltney didn't really

5

get into the circumstances expressly, and I guess Steel

6

Co. did,

so we have to reconcile that in some way.

7

MR. TERRIS:

8

did get into the circumstances.

9

extremely difficult for this Court to over -- to have

I think, Your Honor, that Gwaltney
It would have been

10

overlooked the fact that there was no injunctive relief in

11

Gwaltney.

12

QUESTION:

This is a jurisdictional point, and

13

our cases are replete with the statements that actions by

14

this Court on jurisdictional matters that do not discuss

15

the jurisdictional matters are not precedential.

16

MR. TERRIS:

17

QUESTION:

18
19
20

That's correct, Your Honor, but -And did Gwaltney discuss the

jurisdictional matter explicitly?
MR. TERRIS:

Yes,

it did, Your Honor.

It

discussed both standing and mootness, and --

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. TERRIS:

This aspect of standing?
It did not go into the exact

23

aspects of Steel Company, but Your Honor found in Steel

24

Company itself that Gwaltney had -- that this Court in

25

Gwaltney had upheld standing, and presumably found that

1

that had been a reasonable determination.

2

assume that the Court did not simply overlook a matter as

3

clear-cut as the fact that injunctive relief had never --

4

had not been issued in Gwaltney and was no longer in the

5

case because it had not been appealed.
QUESTION:

6
7

Mr. Terris, do you think the Fourth

Circuit may have confused mootness with standing?
MR. TERRIS:

8

9

One has to

I think it certainly confused

mootness with standing, because what it did is take a

10

decision of this Court in Steel Company and say that it

11

applied in and of itself, with no further reasoning, to

12

the decision, to the case before it.
This Court in Steel Company said explicitly that

13
14

the rules for mootness were not the same rules for

15

standing.

16

the law, that this Court has repeatedly laid down that for

17

a case to be moot it must be absolutely clear that the

18

injury would not continue, that when the Solicitor General

19

made that argument, that that argument did not apply in

20

Steel Company because that was a standing case, and you

21

could not use -- you could not use that doctrine as a

22

sword instead of a shield, as this Court stated.

23

The Government had argued in Steel Company that

MR. TERRIS:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. TERRIS:

4

That is true.
Does that moot the case perhaps?
There is a substantial question

about that --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. TERRIS:

Yes.
-- about that.

What we have --

7

what Your Honors, of course, have done is granted

8

certiorari on a different issue.

9
10

QUESTION:
MR. TERRIS:

Yes.
What the respective parties have

11

presented to Your Honors is their views of the facts.

12

Those facts, of course, have not been sifted through any

13

type of hearing in the district court.

14

Part of the facilities have been taken down, and

15

part of the facilities still remain.

16

we have them examined last week, and so in addition the

17

company continues to have its permit.

18

to preserve its permit in State court even after the time

19

that the -- that it had decided to close, and it

20

negotiated a closure agreement with the State which allows

21

it to reopen an incinerator in the future.

22

QUESTION:

We know that because

It fought,

in fact,

May I ask this question, Mr. Terris.

23

Let's assume for purposes of argument that a week ago the

24

case became totally moot, and everybody would agree it.

25

Would that exonerate your opponent from paying the civil

penalty?
MR. TERRIS:

2

We do not think so, because we

3

think that under Walling v. James Reuter and the U.S.

4

Bancorp decisions of this Court that when the voluntary

5

actions of the defendant to in effect prevent a decision

6

of a district court from being carried out, that in the

7

interests of justice this Court has the power to vacate

8

the court of appeals decision and to therefore let the

9

district court decision continue to apply.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Terris, can I ask you,

the

11

premise of your argument is that it would surely be okay

12

to grant the penalty relief if injunction relief had also

13

been granted.

14

MR. TERRIS:

15

QUESTION:

16

You don't even think that's a

debatable problem.

17

Well --

MR. TERRIS:

I don't think it is, although

impose a public penalty, that is, a penalty that does not

I think Gwaltney clearly holds

that.

I am saying that the Congress has said this is not private

QUESTION:

I understand Congress has said it.

The issue is whether that's constitutional.
MR. TERRIS:

in your petition for certiorari.
MR. TERRIS:

That's correct.

That's quite

20

correct, and it wasn't decided below,

21

before this Court as to whether Congress has the power to

22

create a mechanism in which private citizens can enforce

Federal environmental laws.

upheld by this Court.
QUESTION:

2

This discussion began when we asked

3

whether or not the pendency of an injunctive suit that's

4

live allows you to collect civil penalties which are

5

retroactive, and the respondent's brief quotes Lewis and

6

Casey for the proposition that standing is not dispensed

7

in gross.

8

Chokehold case is the same --we looked to each claim to

9

see if there's standing as to each claim.

In Lyons v. City of Los Angeles -- the

10

MR. TERRIS:

11

QUESTION:

That's correct.
So in light of those cases, why is it

12

that you can argue, as you do, as you seem to do, that the

13

impendancy of the injunctive action somehow confers

14

standing to collect civil penalties for the past wrong?

15

That goes against the teaching of those cases, does it --

MR. TERRIS:

That isn't the argument, Your

Honor.

20

scheme in which you can ask for injunctive relief, you can

21

ask for civil penalties, and each of those remedies has to

22

be analyzed independently to determine whether there was

23

redressability.

Our argument is not that injunctive relief gives

Our position is that the Congress has set up a

For injunction, you have to show the

injunction will help you, but for the civil penalties, all

3

you have to show is, Congress gave you the right to be a

Private Attorney General.

5

MR. TERRIS:

6

QUESTION:

That -Or do you have to -- do you take the

7

position, rather,

8

continuing violations of the statute to get the standing?

9

What is your position?

10

that there has to be a reliance on

MR. TERRIS:

Our position is that it is not

11

enough that Congress has said we have the right to sue for

12

civil penalties, any more than it's enough to say that we

13

have the right to sue for injunctive relief.

14

to show redressability under Article III.

15

We have got

Our position is that civil penalties, like

16

injunctive relief, deter when there is the possibility of

17

future violations.

18

QUESTION:

So you want us to analyze this case

19

as if you asked just for civil penalties.

20

fall with that, on this issue.

21

for backward relief, not for future injunctive relief.

22

MR. TERRIS:

You'll rise and

It's just as if you sued

I do not have to go that far, Your

23

Honor, because, of course, we asked for injunctive relief,

24

as in Gwaltney.

We -- it is important to us that our case

25

is on all fours,

in fact a little stronger than Gwaltney,

but our base -- but underneath that proposition is the

2

argument that civil penalties are sustainable under

Article III if they provide a benefit to the plaintiff.

QUESTION:

But they would have to provide a

benefit rather specifically, would they not?

I mean, you

That's correct, Your Honor.
Finish.
Yes,

Our --

Finish your answer.
let me -- the district court

11

specifically held in this case that the civil penalties

12

did deter, and we submit that that determination is

13

entitled to weight.

14
15

I may say also that the court of appeals assumed
that was true.

16

QUESTION:

But the court of appeals --

QUESTION:

Did it find that the penalties

deterred conduct that had an adverse impact on your

clients?

20

MR. TERRIS:

QUESTION:

Excuse me, Your Honor.
Did the district court find that the

civil penalties deter conduct that has an adverse impact

on your clients?

MR. TERRIS:

It basically found there was not

far as injunctive relief is concerned.

matter of using the basic discretion that a district court

has as to whether to issue injunctive relief, not to issue

it.

It did not hold against us on mootness grounds as

It held, as a

No, but what I want to be clear on,

8

the civil penalties clearly would deter future violations.

9

The question I'm asking is, were the violations

10

established in this case ones that had an adverse impact

11

on your clients?

12

MR. TERRIS:

Oh -- the district court held that

13

there was standing, the court of appeals assumed that

14

there was standing, and we proved standing,

I submit to Your Honors, is not before you.

And did you prove that the violations

adversely affected your clients?

MR. TERRIS:

QUESTION:

20

MR. TERRIS:

21

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Okay.
It's part of standing.
But the court of appeals didn't

22

review that, and one of the questions that I have is,

23

assuming I would agree with you that this case is not

24

moot, mustn't this Court stop there and say, whatever the

it,

so we would say, case not moot, court of appeals stop

2

assuming standing, decide all these questions that you

3

didn't decide.

4

What right would we have,

5

case isn't moot, to decide anything but that?
MR. TERRIS:

6

if we agree that the

I certainly don't think, Your

7

Honor, that you should decide standing, which is -- factÂ­

8

intensive does not raise an issue that's involved in

9

certiorari.

The closure issue I think should be sent back

10

to the district court, because there was no record

11

whatsoever on it.
I do think it would be appropriate for the

12

13

attorney's fee issue to be decided by this Court.

14

It is

QUESTION:

It wasn't even decided in --

MR. TERRIS:

No, but there was a decision by

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. TERRIS:

So -There was a decision by the court

22

of appeals that it will not give attorney's fees if the

23

case is moot, so it's very likely -- if we go back to the

24

district court on the closure question,

25

that that issue will continue to be lurking in the case.

judgment as to the attorney's fees.
MR. TERRIS:

3
4

I just thought there was no final

Oh,

I think there was.

There

was -- they were denied.
QUESTION:

5

And the court of appeals did not say,

6

as I recall, that they would not award attorney's fees if

7

it was not moot.
MR. TERRIS:

8
9

That is true, Your Honor.

I don't

think they could.
QUESTION:

10

Mr. Terris, could I come back to

11

Justice Stevens' question?

12

deterrence that the court referred to, which would be

13

achieved by this penalty, was deterrence against violating

14

the law at this same facility and in the same manner.

15

mean, this company still had a permit.

16

could operate elsewhere.

17

It might have been deterrence from violations there that

18

the court had in mind.

19

that it means deterrence from a violation at this very

20

facility?

21

MR. TERRIS:

I'm not clear whether the

I

They presumably

They operated other facilities.

Is there any reason to believe

I think there is, Your Honor,

22

because no other facilities was raised in the case in the

23

MR. MINEAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The court of appeals erred in holding that a

18

citizen's suit under the Clean Water Act must be dismissed

19

as moot if the district court concludes that injunctive

20

relief is unwarranted.

21

The Clean Water Act authorizes private citizens

to bring suit to abate ongoing violations, and it provides

In addition, this Court said in Tull that courts

can deter future violations by basing the penalty on its

economic impact, exactly what the district court did in

MR. COCKRILL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may

it please the Court:
This case comes to this Court in somewhat of an

5
6

odd posture in that we are here,

in the eighth year of

7

this litigation, because the petitioners want this Court

8

to send all of us back to the Fourth Circuit to litigate

9

the issue of additional civil penalties for violations,

10

some of which occurred nearly 13 years ago, none of which

11

caused any measurable environmental harm, based on the

12

petitioner's contention that such additional penalties for

13

long-past violations will somehow deter future discharges

14

at a facility in South Carolina that no longer discharges,

15

and they ask for this relief despite two very important

16

facts.

17

One, they admit that at trial they completely

18

failed to prove specific adverse effects to the

QUESTION:

We've said that you have to take

That was Steel Co., and there seems to be

a barrier to the standing issue, the absolute ruling that

past penalty in order to deter the future, can't do it,

no standing,

14

so we have to address that, don't we, despite

MR. COCKRILL:

Yes, Your Honor.

I mean -- yes.

15

That's our position, that under no circumstances should a

16

private party be able to seek penalties, a remedy in which

that private party has no personal stake, because there's

QUESTION:

-- and if you admit that in the long

2

run, the mind run of cases, Congress could believe that in

3

the mind run of cases, collecting these kind of penalties

4

will stop repetition, then you must think that they have

5

standing and redressability to get this kind of penalty.

6

That's the Article III argument.

7

That's why -- that's the argument that once you

8

go down the road of saying an injunction is okay, even

9

though they're somewhat strangers, and once you say that

10

this has the same effect,

11

in terms of specific deterrence, even if not in yours --

12

that's a matter for other places to decide -- then you

13

must say that there is standing here.

14

QUESTION:

Oh,

in many cases, as an injunction

I didn't understand you to say

15

that you could waive the requirement of deterrence in a

particular case.

it's enough, as I understand it --

-- that Congress has found in the

21

generality of cases that penalties will deter.

Right.

Now, do you agree with that?

My position is that, while

MR. COCKRILL:

vary from person to person, and that's our position, that

penalties are not specific enough, and you cannot predict

the effect of a penalty on a -QUESTION:

Well, but is your position, then,

12

that penalties can never do the job, or that it's a case-

13

by-case thing, that in some cases you can show that a

14

penalty does have specific deterrence, or that since

15

Congress has found that penalties are enough, that that

16

would be true in all cases?

17

MR. COCKRILL:

Well,

I think in some cases,

18

penalties will deter.

I would think it would be a bad

thing to make -- to send it back to the Federal courts for

particular case?

3

MR. COCKRILL:

No, Your Honor,

I don't.

I think

4

the penalties that were imposed had no deterrent effect,

5

because Laidlaw came into compliance on its own, and was

6

basically on the verge of compliance before the citizens'

7

suit was filed.
I think the penalty here were exactly because --

9

what the district court said,

I'm mandated to do it, and

10

he based it entirely on past violations and then said,

11

believe this, with the other costs, will deter, but it is

12

just too uncertain in any case, and it creates a lot of

13

confusion, and that's especially shown here, where at one

14

point in the Fourth Circuit the petitioners felt that

15

these were an ineffective deterrent and now feel that

16

they're an effective deterrent, and I think --

something positive from the judgment?
MR. COCKRILL:

If you overrule the Fourth

Circuit, and remand to the Fourth Circuit these other

jurisdictional questions,

I think it would be premature.

If you -- I think the Government takes that

position, too, that that should be handled on remand.

If

But handling it on remand,

if you're

penalties were intended to deter, as -- and of course it

2

had other purposes as well.

3

The district court specifically found, and this

4

is on the joint appendix, on page 182, that the penalty

5

that it was imposing, together with attorney's fees which

6

it contemplated the plaintiffs would receive, and the

7

attorney's fees which the defendant's counsel obviously

8

have received, would constitute deterrence,

Laidlaw's argument before this Court that there is not

Could the district court, Mr. Terris,

appeal to the court of appeals, which was that we take the

22

position that the economic benefit has to be stripped from

the violator without taking into account attorney's fees,

24

particularly since the attorney's fees could not be known

25

to the district court at the time.

I think that was a

mistake.
But the point that I'm making here is, because

3

that issue is -- clearly is not before Your Honors, the

4

point that I'm making to Your Honors is that the district

court clearly found that the penalty it was imposing was a

deterrent against future violations, that is,

7

deterrence, and I submit that it is a concrete benefit to

the plaintiffs.

I want to come back to the question about

10

whether -- whether,

11

you can't grant civil penalties, that injunctive relief is

12

not a lesser form of relief, and I think that is very

13

clearly shown in Romero-Barcelo.

14

if you deny injunctive relief, then

There, this Court said that injunctive relief

15

should not lie under the facts of that case under the

16

Clean Water Act, but it then pointed out, although it did

17

not faithfully anticipate this Court's later ruling in

18

Department of Energy v. The State of Ohio about sovereign

19

immunity, but it then pointed out that penalties were an

20

alternative to injunctive relief, and I submit to Your

21

Honors that is exactly what we have in this case.

22

What the district court found was that there

23

was -- that there was not enough likelihood of violations

24

to justify the extraordinary relief of injunctive relief.

the ordinary four-part test for injunctions, but it then

quite clearly said, when it got to civil penalties, that
