MR. MAINES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would like to begin by making a preliminary

16

observation, which I think is important because it bears

18

on the overall tenor of the case, although I don't think

19

that it affects the proper, ultimate decision of the case.

20

That is, that Mr. Martinez did represent himself at his

21

trial.

in any untoward antics.

23

political position or anything like that.

There have been a series of decisions over the

years, over the decades by this Court involving the right

It begins

10

at arraignment.

11

And thus it is that the Court can find, as it did in

12

Evitts v. Lucey, that a defendant, a criminal defendant,

13

has a right to an attorney, a constitutional right to an

14

attorney, on direct appeal in a State court proceeding.

15

It doesn't derive from the Sixth Amendment.

16

from the Due Process Clause.

17

It ends at the point of direct appeal.

QUESTION:

Well,

in a sense,

It derives

I thought Evitts

18

perhaps derived from the Equal Protection Clause, that an

19

indigent defendant have -- should have the same right to

20

an effective appeal as -- as a non-indigent defendant.

21

And since the non-indigent defendant will have an

22

attorney, the indigent ought to be provided with one.

MR. MAINES:

Evitts,

rationale for the right to counsel, but it was very

careful to explain that the right to counsel had a

rationale which really partook of both clauses, Equal

Protection and Due Process.

to make that point.

4

QUESTION:

The Court was clear in Evitts

And now -- but you -- you say for

5

your claim, it doesn't depend on equal protection at all;

6

it depends on the due process strand, or whatever you want

7

to call it, of that decision and others.

8

MR. MAINES:

That's correct.

That's correct.

9

And here's -- here's how the argument goes, lest

10

there be any confusion about it.

11

set of cases which the Court has delineated in which the

12

Court has said at this stage, at this stage, at this

13

stage, from arraignment through direct appeal, appeal as

14

of right, we deem these to be critical stages in the

15

evolution of -- of a criminal prosecution.

There -- there is this

Thus, for example, the Court has ruled that in

19

discretionary appeals, a defendant is not entitled to a -

20

- a lawyer.

21

entitled to a lawyer on discretionary appeals.

22

has drawn the line between direct appeals of right and

before this Court.

4

it's a constitutional right to a direct appeal.
MR. MAINES:

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg,

absolutely.
QUESTION:

So, there's quite a sharp distinction

5

between a trial which surely is a constitutional right and

6

an appeal which isn't.

7

MR. MAINES:

There is that distinction, but it's

8

not a distinction that matters for our argument in this

9

case because the right that we're talking about is -- is a

10

-- a right to counsel or not to counsel or to represent

11

oneself, which I maintain is all part and parcel of the

12

same right.

13

Court has said that the trial setting and the direct

14

appeal setting are at least that similar.

15

they're at least that similar that in both cases a

16

defendant gets a lawyer if he wants one.

17

And in the right to counsel context, the

QUESTION:

They're --

Mr. Maines, we're now almost 10

18

minutes into your argument, and we've gotten to where the

19

right -- you've established the right to counsel.

20

course, what you have to establish here is the right to

21

represent oneself.

22

why the right to counsel should be followed by a right to

23

represent oneself on appeal.

24
25

But of

So, maybe if you could shift over to

MR. MAINES:

That's exactly right.

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice.

The next step in the argument, therefore, is

1

2

that if we accept that there is a constitutional right to

3

counsel on direct appeal, then by implication there is the

4

right to represent oneself on direct appeal.

5

you may be wondering about that implication, and so let me

6

try to flesh it out a little bit.

7

Now, some of

First of all, there is precedent in this Court,

8

of course, for the notion that the right to counsel

9

entails or comprehends the right to represent oneself.

In

10

fact, that's one of the oft-quoted passages in Faretta v.

11

California, and I'll read the pertinent couple of

sentences.

QUESTION:

They rest on considerations that go to

Now, that -- that's quite true and I

17

don't think you will find the Court is doubtful at all of

18

the Faretta ruling where we've said you have a right to

19

counsel at -- rather a right to represent oneself at

20

trial.

21

that -- that you've got to tackle.

22

But it seems to me you've got several distinctions

At trial, you've got the government, in effect,

23

coming after the defendant.

The government has to prove

24

its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and all the defendant

25

has to do is just sit there and make the government prove

You can't do that at trial.

If

I think the -- the critical question is that given the

structure of the Court's precedents in this area -- and
this, Mr. Chief Justice, is really getting to the core

10

point here.

11

precedents, the question becomes whether there is anything

12

that offends due process, Justice O'Connor, anything that

right under Faretta, but there are enough differences

2

between appeal and trial so that we simply don't think the

3

Constitution carries it over.

4

MR. MAINES:

And I concede that if -- if you can

5

coherently argue, based on the pattern of this Court's

6

precedents, that there is such a series of differences

7

between the two stages, then our argument doesn't work.
QUESTION:

Mr. Maines, why isn't this a

The defendant in a criminal trial where he

10

has a right to a jury is being judged by his peers.

He

11

says, I want to be in control.

12

But on appeal he's facing three law-steeped judges, not

13

his peers where the facts are out of the case, where

14

credibility is out of the case, where the only thing is

15

the law.

16

if not most, of these cases, there is no eye-to-eye

17

confrontation at all.

I want to face that jury.

And, if we're being practical about it, in many,

There's just a brief.

18

So, I don't understand how it comes to a great

constitutional issue if the only difference is that your

client is getting something more, that is, he could put in

21

his own brief and in addition, he gets the lawyer's brief.

MR. MAINES:

It's highly relevant --

It does absolutely.

It does

absolutely, but it's the same perspective that motivated a

I think that that

not constitutionally required.
But, Justice Kennedy, to finish up the -- the

7
8

picture so you understand,

all of the California courts

9

will accept pro se habeas petitions from the inmate.

10

Because one of the topics that can always be entertained

11

is ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, either

12

directly or indirectly, all the California appellate

13

courts will hear from the pro se -- or the -- the

14

individual who wants to be pro se but is not being allowed

15

to be pro se.
California's system is very straightforward.

seeking oral argument has dropped dramatically.

I think it's important too to remember if we're

-- we need to look at the State cases because in the

One of concerns, which we raised in the brief,

8

is the implications of what happens if you accept

9

petitioner's argument.

And there are a number of them

10

that we are particularly concerned with, one of which is

11

how -- assuming there's a constitutional right to go pro

12

se on appeal, how would you obtain a valid waiver from a

13

prison inmate of that right?

14

Because in Faretta you talked about the fact

15

that the judge can look at that individual, can gauge

16

facial expressions, tone, inflection, to make sure that

17

that individual can make a knowing, voluntary, and

18

intelligent waiver.

prison?

21

think that is a major hurdle that -- that would

immediately face the courts.

How do you do that with an individual

We're dealing with a constitutional right.

You looked venue and vicinage, and you said,

yes, you have a right to confrontation, but you don't have

there are significant differences between trial and

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD D. MAINES

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MAINES:

9

Almost any two categories can be

10

distinguished if we -- if we look at them in the right

11

way, can be differentiated.

12

there are ways to differentiate the appeal stage from the

13

trial stage.

14

maintain, notwithstanding Mr. -- Mr. Foster's arguments,

15

that the differences which he has pointed out are not the

16

significant ones for us to be focusing on in this case.

17

And, therefore, that the thrust of his argument, which is

18

that there is decisional difference between trial and

19

appeal is not the key issue here.

And I don't dispute that

Indeed, they are different by definition.

I

Also, I think it is important to rebut his claim

that our approach here is that the -- the right to

something, a constitutional right, if waived implies the

opposite of that right.

positing.

4

I don't think that holds up.

They're not opposite rights.

So,

I think that's a false -- a false argument.

I believe that if the Court takes a look at the

6

pattern of its precedents,

if at -- if it considers the

7

stages at which it has determined that the right to

8

counsel occurs at a critical stage, and if the Court

9

embraces the notion squarely set forth in Faretta v.

10

California, that the right to counsel encompasses a

11

correlative right to self-representation, that the result

12

that we seek here follows straightforwardedly if the Court

13

has determined to make sure that there's coherence in its

precedents.
