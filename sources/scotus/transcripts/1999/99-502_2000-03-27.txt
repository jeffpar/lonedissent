ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEBRA J. DIXON

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. DIXON:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is a case where the respondent, Adams USA,

12

13

obtained a judgment of invalidity, had that judgment

14

affirmed on appeal, obtained a judicial determination of

15

inequitable conduct for an award of attorney's fees, had

16

that award reaffirmed, had All American Sports Corporation

17

dismissed from the judgment, obtained a judicial

18

determination as to the amount of fees to be paid, had

19

that fee award reduced to judgment in the amount of

20

$178,000.

21

to have Don Nelson joined as a party.

22

Then, and only then, did the respondent attempt

The rules of substantive law, the rules of

23

constitutional law, and the rules of procedural law all

24

tell us that Adams did this wrong.

Ms. Dixon, I take it that you don't

challenge the fact that the pleadings were amended to add

2

the petitioner.

3

MS. DIXON:

I do challenge that, Your Honor.

4

What I understand the record to say is that the

5

respondents were granted leave to amend their complaint to

6

join Don Nelson as a party.

7

today -QUESTION:

8

9

However, as we sit here

Was any objection made below at that

time to the amendment?
MS. DIXON:

10

There was an object -- there was a

11

motion filed to alter or amend the judgment, but there was

12

no formal objection.

13

process and had not filed a responsive pleading at that

14

time.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Nelson had not been served with

That's exactly what's bothering me

16

about the case, because it seems that the obvious

17

objection would be that it wasn't -- that justice didn't

18

require the amendment under Rule 15.

19

that wasn't made.

That's the objection

Instead what you're saying is that there wasn't

20
21

service of process, there wasn't jurisdiction, and those

22

things seem either waived, or -- they seem waived,

23

basically, so the issue that should be here isn't here,

24

the issue that shouldn't be here is here, and there I am,

25

stuck.

And now, how do you get me out of that?

MS. DIXON:

1

Your Honor, the waiver rule

2

specifically states that one must assert a defense at

3

their first opportunity.

4

that first opportunity is in one's responsive pleading.

5

potential party has absolutely no obligation to file a

6

responsive pleading until he or she has been served with

7

process.
QUESTION:

8

9

Under Federal Civil Rule 12,

Oh, that may be, but unfortunately I

gather that that issue is waived.

I mean, isn't it?

I

10

mean, is it here?

11

below?

12

client has not been served with process and therefore --

13
14

I mean, did you raise the objection

Did you say, judge, in the district court, my

QUESTION:

Your client wasn't there below.

That's your position.

15

MS. DIXON:

16

QUESTION:

Precisely, Justice Scalia.
Your client couldn't have waived it

17

below, because your client hadn't been served and

18

therefore was not present.

19

QUESTION:

I misspoke.

It's the jurisdiction, I

20

gather, that they're saying is waived.

21

they're saying, anyway, that the service of process issue

22

is not properly before us.

23

A

MS. DIXON:

I gather that

Your -- if I may address Justice

24

Scalia's point first, that's precisely the position of the

25

petitioner.

He was not there.

Because he wasn't there,

1

there was nothing for Mr. Nelson to waive.
As it relates to the jurisdictional issue, I

2

3

believe this Court has spoken on multiple occasions

4

stating that, until one has been served with service of

5

process and had an opportunity to be heard, they are not

6

subject to the jurisdiction of the court.

7

Being as though Mr. Nelson was not subject to

8

the jurisdiction of the district court, he was not able to

9

waive the jurisdiction of that court.
QUESTION:

10
11

judgment.

12

MS. DIXON:

13

QUESTION:

14

Well, you did move to amend the

Absolutely, Your Honor.
And you take it that's tantamount to

a special appearance, is that --

15

MS. DIXON:

I would disagree with that, Your

16

Honor.

17

it appears as though the motion to amend or alter the

18

judgment was nothing more than an attempt to buy time on

19

appeal.

20

Quite frankly, based on my reading of the record,

Post judgment, there are only two -QUESTION:

Now, just a minute here.

You're

21

saying that Rule 15 was an objection, that even though it

22

appears he might have had a meritorious ground to say it

23

doesn't relate back under 15(c), that he doesn't have to

24

do that because he's not there.

25

MS. DIXON:

He's not a party.

Correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

1

And then I said, well, but you did

2

move to amend the judgment, and you said, well, that was

3

just a delaying tactic.

4

you're being consistent in your position of saying that

5

he's not a party before the court.
MS. DIXON:

6

That doesn't sound to me like

I would disagree with the Court.

My

7

position is that post judgment there are only two remedies

8

available to someone in the position of Mr. Nelson.

9

is filing an appeal, the second is filing a 60(b), both of

One

10

which have been done by Mr. Nelson as he sits before this

11

Court.
He was not a party to the underlying action at

12

13

the time that motion was pending before the court and, as

14

a result, was not in a position to file a responsive

15

pleading.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

What were the grounds of his 60(b)

motion?
MS. DIXON:

His 60(b) motion related, Your

19

Honor, to the due process violation as well as the

20

violations of the Federal Civil Rules.

21

QUESTION:

So he was saying through Rule 60(b) I

22

should not have been added as a party to the judgment when

23

I was never entered as a party to the lawsuit?

24

MS. DIXON:

25

QUESTION:

Exactly, Your Honor.
You don't seem to rely on 15(c)(3),

1

which I thought gave maybe too easy an answer in your

2

favor, because one of the -- in addressing the question of

3

adding a party by amendment, 15(c)(3)(A) sets as a

4

condition that the party to be added gets sufficient

5

notice so that he will not be prejudiced in putting in a

6

defense, which seems to imply very clearly that it can't

7

be done when the case is closed and no defense can be put

8

in.

9
10

Is -- that's -- maybe that's too easy.

Is there

a reason you don't rely on that?
MS. DIXON:

11

Your Honor, procedurally it's the

12

petitioner's position that based on the statute under

13

which Adams is seeking awards and the extension of the

14

judgment of attorney's fees against Mr. Nelson, they have

15

not even met their threshold requirement of prevailing

16

party.

17

and, in fact, the due process requirements have been met

18

in effect become a secondary issue.

19

Based on that, the issue of whether or not 15(c)

QUESTION:

But if you're wrong on your first

20

argument, if Adams remains the prevailing party in the

21

lawsuit, then do you agree that on the further arguments

22

that you make, you can win here, but there must be further

23

proceedings in the district court?

24
25

In other words, this could go back, and the -Adams can say, now we want to do it right, Your Honor, so

we're going to serve a pleading on Nelson, which hasn't

2

been up to now done.

3

process, but there hasn't even been a complaint drawn.

4

You were talking about service of

MS. DIXON:

Correct, Justice Ginsburg.

I would

5

represent to the Court that Mr. Nelson sits in this

6

courtroom today, more than 2 years after the district

7

court granted leave to amend the complaint, ready,

8

willing, and able, if this Court's judgment so orders, to

9

accept service of process, appear in the district court,

10
11

and litigate this matter on its merits.
QUESTION:

Yes, I wanted to clarify that.

So

12

you recognize if you lose on the prevailing party thing,

13

then it does go back to the district court and he can

14

fight it out there.

15

MS. DIXON:

16

QUESTION:

Certainly, Your Honor.
Could you just elaborate just a

17

minute on -- I thought that -- I mean, I completely agree

18

with you, obviously if you don't have jurisdiction over a

19

human being, you cannot make that human being do anything,

20

but I think that they -- what the other side was saying is

21

that there is jurisdiction over your client for the

22

following reason.

23

At some point, he appeared.

When he appeared in

24

the case -- I can't tell you, I'm not that familiar to

25

know just when he did.

When he appeared with the case, he

mentioned nothing about jurisdiction whatsoever.

2

a few substantive defenses, and if in fact you're going to

3

make an appearance and you don't raise the issue, and

4

you're there in court, that in effect waives your claim as

5

to jurisdiction.
You didn't make a special appearance.

6

He made

You --

7

and I thought that was basically the law, and so I want to

8

be sure I get your response to that.

9

MS. DIXON:

Your Honor, by virtue of filing --

10

the very fact that Mr. Nelson filed a motion to amend

11

and/or alter the pleadings, which, as I understand the

12

Court, the Court is directing my attention to --

13

QUESTION:

Well, you'll be more familiar with

14

their argument from their brief, frankly, than I will.

15

You've probably read it several times, and that's what I'm

16

trying to refer to.

17

They say he appeared at some point, and when he

18

appeared at that point in this case, he didn't raise the

19

jurisdictional defenses or lack of notice defense and,

20

because he didn't raise them, but responded on the merits,

21

he basically has waived his defense of no jurisdiction,

22

because he's there, or they made it approximately like

23

that.

24
25

I'm referring to their argument, not to my
argument, and I want to know what your response is to it.

MS. DIXON:

1

Your Honor, my response to that

2

question is two-pronged.

3

position continues to be the Court has not -- does not

4

have jurisdiction over him in this matter because the

5

respondents have not filed the procedural requirements for

6

jurisdiction to attach.

7

QUESTION:

First and foremost, Mr. Nelson's

As I understand --

Well, but that can be waived.

8

can be waived.

9

and the lack of jurisdiction can be waived, can it not?
MS. DIXON:

10
11

Do you concede that?

That

The lack of service

By consent it can be waived,

certainly, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

12

And courts have said that when such a

3

person makes an appearance and files a pleading, that

4

constitutes a waiver, and that's the question.

5

MS. DIXON:

Your Honor, I would suggest to this

6

Court there are certain pleadings that may waive those

7

jurisdictional requirements.

8

represent to this Court it's the petitioner's position

that merely by filing a motion to alter or amend the

there, whether he was in the case.

There are really two separate

1

point that he made when he filed his pleading.

2

you can't enter this judgment against me because I wasn't

3

there.

4

He said,

There's a second issue, which is whether, if the

5

court did enter a judgment against him when he wasn't

there, it would violate the Constitution.

7

raise those constitutional arguments when he first

8

appeared, but he did raise the argument, I'm not here.

9

Isn't that correct?
MS. DIXON:

10

Now, he did not

It is correct, Justice Scalia.

11

However, the distinction is made as to the timing that

12

this -- the issue was raised.

13

As the Court is aware, Mr. Nelson did not file

14

the motion to amend or alter the judgment until judgment

15

on the merits had been rendered.

16

into this case as a -- attempted to be brought into this

17

case as a last ditch effort by Adams to have somebody pony

18

up the $178,000 in fees.

19

He was simply brought

By virtue of the fact that Mr. Nelson was never

20

subject to jurisdiction of this Court when it was heard on

21

its merits, he cannot, based on this Court's prior

22

rulings, be subject to an award of attorney's fees post

23

judgment.

24
25

QUESTION:

Okay, but I just want to get to the

narrow waiver point that was raised, and my recollection

1

is the same as Justice Scalia's, and that is -- I don't

2

remember procedurally how to describe this, but my

3

recollection from reading the briefs was that at the first

4

moment that he filed any pleading following the joinder,

5

one of the things he said is, you can't do this because I

6

am not a party, or was not a party.

7

correct, that he raised his nonparty status at that

8

moment?

9

MS. DIXON:

Is that recollection

He did, Your Honor.

10

QUESTION:

Okay.

11

QUESTION:

I suppose that that's an -- now I'm

12

not certain about what the law is on that.

13

in other words, the --of course he wasn't a party.

14

issue is to make him a party.

15

MS. DIXON:

16

QUESTION:

I mean, he -The

Absolutely, Your Honor.
And so therefore there would be a

17

question as to whether or not the court has -- should make

18

him a party.

19

Now, if you say, I'm not a party, don't make me

20

a party, does that waive your juris -- I don't know, does

21

it waive your jurisdictional argument?

22

MS. DIXON:

Your Honor, I would suggest to this

23

Court that based on civil rules, as well as this Court's

24

prior holdings, that's simply not the case.

25

importantly, a careful review of the docket from the

2

district court undercuts any such argument.
On March 25 of 1998, at 10:09 a.m., the district

3

court's docket was silent as to Donald Nelson in his

4

individual capacity.

5

docket reflected not only had Mr. Nelson been joined as a

6

party, but was subject to and bound by a judgment in

7

excess of 178,000 --

8

QUESTION:

One minute later, at 10:10 a.m., the

I understand, but you -- and your

9

position, I take it, is that when he does come to court

10

and move to amend the judgment, this is tantamount to a

11

special appearance challenging the court's authority to

12

treat him as a party.

13

MS. DIXON:

Your Honor, I would say that he

14

certainly did raise the issue of the court's jurisdiction

15

as part of his motion to alter and amend, but in no way

16

did he subject himself to that jurisdiction.

17
18

20
21

QUESTION:

So that it's tantamount to a special

appearance to challenge jurisdiction.
MS. DIXON:

I would disagree with the Court.

I

do not believe -QUESTION:

Special appearance means that you are

22

there only for that limited purpose, and you're not -- so

23

I think you agree with what Justice Kennedy just said.

24

special appearance is a limited appearance simply for the

purpose of making that application, and not subjecting

MS. DIXON:

I understand the distinction

technically.

I just wanted to differentiate.

specifically acknowledged to the court they were making a,

you'd at least have to find out about that.

Is there

1

any other ground you could win on?
MS. DIXON:

2

Absolutely, Your Honor.

Under

3

section 285, the statute that provides for awards of

4

attorney's fees in patent cases involving exceptional

5

circumstances, that statute has, as is outlined -- as is

6

also found in the civil rights arena, a threshold

7

requirement of being a, quote, prevailing party, end

8

quote.

9

This Court, although it has not specifically

10

addressed the definition of prevailing party, subject to

11

section 285, has on a multitude of occasions wrestled with

12

and, in fact, addressed the definition of prevailing party

13

within the civil rights arena, specifically under 42

14

U.S.C. 1988.

15

In each of those cases, this Court has found in

16

order to be a prevailing party one must have prevailed

17

against the opposing side on the merits.

18

before this Court is clear.

19

adjudicated on its merits, Donald Nelson was not a party.

20

By virtue of the fact he was not a party on the

21

merits, under section 285, it is impossible for him to be

22

subject to an award of fees post judgment --

23

QUESTION:

MS. DIXON:

Your Honor, I would agree with you

10

on a more global scale.

However, as it relates to the

11

specific circumstances of this Court, as the record

12

reflects, at the time the underlying litigation was

13

instituted, Mr. Nelson had released all right, title, and

14

interest he had in the subject patents, the 110 and the

15

702 patent.

16

of those patents when the underlying litigation commenced.

He had absolutely no relationship to either

17

By virtue of that lack of a relationship to

18

either of those patents, there were no merits against

19

Mr. Nelson to which Adams could prevail upon.
QUESTION:

20

That's what he'd like to litigate if

21

he had a chance to, but he -- well, what do you make of

22

Rule 21, which says that parties may be added by order of

23

the court on motion of any party at any stage of the

24

action?

certainly Rule 21 applies, again in the more global sense,

but it does not absolve the party attempting to amend to

3

their Rule 4 requirement of service of process.

subject to the jurisdiction of the court, must be served

with process and have an opportunity to be heard.

14

you meant opportunity to put in a defense, which he can't

MS. DIXON:

Court that there are certain circumstances where, post

judgment, Mr. Nelson could be served with process and

What they can do is try to collect the

attorney's fees from him by pursuing him in a separate

action and claiming that there is, in fact, preclusion.

5

He can then defend on whether or not there is preclusion

in the assertion of the fee claim against him, and he will

7

do so based on whether he was given an equitable

8

opportunity to be heard if he had wanted to in the first

action, and so on.

Why isn't that the more orderly way to structure

the possibilities for what they want to do and you want to

MS. DIXON:

Nelson, appearing individually, brought a motion to amend,

2

and this was, as I understand it from the sequence you set

3

out, the first pleading that Nelson filed after being

4

joined as a party, and you say -- again, I'm still on

5

page 3 of your brief -- that he raised two claims.

6

Number 1, he said that section 285 doesn't allow an award

7

of fees in these circumstances and number 2, he couldn't

8

be held under 285 anyway, because he was not a party.

9

I mean, it seems to me that that may not have

10

been the most subtle way, that latter claim that he was

11

not a party may not have been the most complete or subtle

12

way to raise the point, but it sounds as though someone is

13

trying to raise the point that there's no jurisdiction

14

here, and so I have my -- I have difficulty in just taking

15

it as a waiver.

16

MR. WHEAT:

To address your question, Your

17

Honor, in section 1 of the motion to vacate, they

18

acknowledged he was a party and requested that the order

19

be amended to delete him as a party.

20

QUESTION:

Well, I assume what they meant was,

21

he's a party because you've just issued an order saying he

22

is one, but -- and taking the pleading as you've described

23

it in your own brief, his next statement was, I am not a

24

party, or was not a party through the litigation, and that

makes -- I guess that doesn't make any sense to me except

You know, in the patent infringement --

QUESTION:

But you know, you have only one case

that's somewhat in point, and that's the Fromson case.

But that's when the corporation represented to the Court

that it was going to be good for the judgment, that it

would have the wherewithal to pay, so you didn't have to

join the principal, and then it turned out the corporation

had nothing.

Here, there was nothing of that nature.

MR. WHEAT:

11

Yes, Your Honor, Fromson is

12

factually distinguishable based upon that distinction you

13

just made, but the law in Fromson is the timing of an

14

amendment post judgment, and the Federal circuit held that

15

was appropriate, that you can amend post judgment to add a

new party.

That's what we did.

The question here is really, you know, anyone who

12

You have to make the claim and give them an -- you know,

13

notice that the claim is being made against them, and give

14

them an opportunity to come in and defend themselves.

15

MR. WHEAT:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, I agree, Your Honor.
And is -- I understood from the

17

briefs, or perhaps from the lower court opinion, that you

18

make no claim here to piercing the corporate veil?

19

MR. WHEAT:

No.

We did not proceed under that

20

theory.

We proceeded under the theory that the person who

21

committed the inequitable conduct is -- can be held

22

accountable for the fee award, and under the theory that

23

he was collaterally estopped to dispute the finding that

24

he committed inequitable conduct adequate to support the

25

fee award.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DEBRA J. DIXON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. DIXON:

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

There

are a few points I wish to attempt to clarify for the
Court.
QUESTION:

Would you clarify for me why, in your

12

petition for cert, you said that petitioner does not

13

challenge the district court's decision to grant

14

respondents leave to amend the complaint and to join

15

petitioner as a new party defendant, and to do so after

16

judgment had been rendered?

17

that isn't some kind of a waiver?

18

MS. DIXON:

I mean, there we are.

So

No, it isn't, Your Honor, because

19

even conceding the district court's ability to perfect all

20

three of those items, it does not obviate Mr. Nelson's

21

right to service of process and the right to be heard.

22

What the petitioner does challenge in the

23

district court, and object to in the district court's

24

finding, was having rendered a judgment against him

25

without affording him the opportunity to be heard on or

defend on the merits, and there were multiple defenses

2

available to Mr. Nelson, as well as a potential

3

counterclaim, which were not available to Ohio Cellular

4

Products, which in turn were not raised at the trial

5

court.
QUESTION:

6

Ms. Dixon, how do you explain the

7

statement by the trial court here on your later

8

application for a 60(b) motion?

9

says this:

In denying it, the court

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide

10

that a challenge to personal jurisdiction, insufficiency

11

of process, or insufficiency of service of process is

12

waived if not made in the party's first responsive

3

pleading or motion.

4

It is not disputed that Nelson did not, in any

5

of his prior pleadings, make the objections he now seeks

6

to raise, that is, personal jurisdiction, insufficiency of

7

process, or insufficiency of service of process.

8
9

MS. DIXON:
directly.

Your Honor, I respond to that quite

Under Civil Rule

2, a responsive pleading is a

20

party's first opportunity to be heard.

However, the

2

responsive pleading is deemed to either be a dispositive

22

motion prior to filing an answer, or an answer.

23

predicate to that is Adams' filing of a complaint and

24

giving Mr. Nelson the opportunity to affirmatively respond

25

to the same.

The

QUESTION:

1

You -- well, I mean, it seems a

2

reasonable rule laid down in that denial of the motion

3

that the Federal rules provide that these defenses are

4

waived if not made in the party's first responsive

5

pleading or motion, and you're saying that you didn't have

6

to make those defenses in your first motion?

7

MS. DIXON:

Correct, Your Honor, because, as we

8

had addressed during my initial argument, Mr. Nelson's

9

filing the Rule 59 motion would have been a special

10

appearance, and he would not have been subject to the

11

jurisdiction of the court by virtue of the same.
QUESTION:

12

In other words, the answer by motion

13

or by answer to the complaint, Rule 12 is the rule in

14

question, and Rule 12 says you can make a motion in

15

advance of answering the complaint, or you can answer the

16

complaint, so Rule 12 is set up to deal with the case

17

where a complaint was filed, and then it says you respond

18

to that complaint either by pre-answer, motion, or by

19

answer.

20

MS. DIXON:

21

QUESTION:

Precisely, Your Honor.
How can you consider your first, your

22

April 8 appearance a special appearance when you made two

23

arguments, the first one of which is obviously to the

24

merits, namely, section 285 does not allow an award of

25

attorney's fees against an individual who engaged in

3

MS. DIXON:

That's certainly a general

I would disagree with the Court.

It

was merely a special appearance in an attempt to bring

some deficiencies in the procedural aspects of the case to

the court's attention.
