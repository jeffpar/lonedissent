United States.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. HUNDLEY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HUNDLEY:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Thirty-four years ago, in Miranda v. Arizona,

11
12

this Court held that the Fifth Amendment privilege against

13

self-incrimination required that police interrogators

14

fully inform a suspect of their rights under the privilege

15

and provide them a full opportunity to exercise those

16

rights.

17

Congress has the authority to legislatively overrule and

18

reverse this Court's decision in Miranda.

19

The question before the Court today asks whether

The key to this question turns on whether the

20

requirements of Miranda are constitutionally based and

21

therefore immune from legislative modification, or are

22

something else:

23

exercise of the Court's power to prescribe rules and

24

procedures for courts.

25

as the Foruth Circuit ruled, a mere

QUESTION:

Mr. Hundley, are those requirements

substantive requirements?

2

Amendment not to observe them?
MR. HUNDLEY:

3

Is it a violation of the Fifth

Yes, Justice Scalia.

While the

4

specific warnings articulated in Miranda themselves are

5

not constitutionally mandated, the constitutional

6

threshhold represented by those warnings is

7

constitutionally required.
QUESTION:

8

9

I presume that if a policeman should

beat someone with a rubber hose and extract a confession,

10

and then introduce that confession in a criminal

11

prosecution, that the policeman would be subject to a

12

civil action not only for assault, but also for a

3

violation of the constitutional right, or Fifth Amendment

4

right.

5

MR. HUNDLEY:

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

Now, do you think that a policeman

7

who fails to Mirandize the suspect, obtains a confession

8

without having Mirandized them and then introduces that

9

confession in court, is subject to suit?

20
21

Do you know of

any suit that has ever been brought?
MR. HUNDLEY:

I am unaware of any -- well,

22

Justice Scalia, let me take that back.

I believe the

23

Ninth Circuit is currently wrestling with the issue of

24

whether or not the intentional disregard of an

25

individual's exercise of his rights under Miranda could

constitute a civil action.
QUESTION:

I'd be very surprised if that is

3

prosecutable civilly, which makes me think that the right

4

we're talking about here is a procedural, is a procedural

5

guarantee that the court instituted, rather than a

6

substantive one.

MR. HUNDLEY:

Yes.

The requirements of Miranda

are constitutional protections that the court -QUESTION:

MR. HUNDLEY:
QUESTION:

Well --

Regardless of whether they've been

4

technically extracted in violation of the Constitution, as

5

a matter of criminal procedure, we won't admit them, nor

6

will the States.

7

MR. HUNDLEY:

I would respond, Your Honor, that

8

they cannot be submitted because they were obtained

9

without the requisite protections that the Constitution

20

demands to ensure their voluntariness, to dispel the

21

inherent compulsion --

QUESTION:

So then your answer is, is that the

23

warnings specified in Miranda are constitutional

requirements, and I thought you'd said --

3

QUESTION:

-- something somewhat different at

the very outset.
MR. HUNDLEY:

I did, and it's a subtle

4

distinction, Justice Kennedy, and it's a distinction I

5

think which has perhaps led to some confusion in the

6

literature.

7

that there be protective procedures in place to fully

8

inform a suspect of his rights, so that he knows his

9

rights, so that he knows he can exercise those rights, he

10

knows that his interrogators will honor those rights, and

11

so that the court will know that any waiver of those

12

rights was made knowingly and intentionally, not just

13

voluntarily.

14
15
16

The constitutional requirement of Miranda is

QUESTION:

Well, how is 3501 deficient under

that analysis?
MR. HUNDLEY:

Because 3501, rather than

17

requiring affirmative objective procedures which provide

18

notice to the defendant and provide protections for the

19

suspect, simply reverts the analysis back to the totality-

20

of-circumstances test, which courts in this country

21

wrestled with for many decades until Miranda explicitly

22

rejected it as unworkable and inconsistent.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Hundley, as I understand it,

24

Miranda made a switch from the totality-of-the-

25

circumstances that related to due process, don't give

1

people the third degree, to something quite different, and

2

I'm not sure you're explicit about it.

3

for the first time put this right under the First -- under

4

the Fifth Amendment, and it became a right to notice and

5

opportunity to exercise your rights.

6

MR. HUNDLEY:

7

QUESTION:

That is, Miranda

Yes.

Not a right to be free from third

8

degree procedures, but a right to notice, and opportunity

9

to exercise your right to silence, and that that was an

10

interpretation of what the self-incrimination privilege

11

required, is that correct?

12

MR. HUNDLEY:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

The

13

Miranda court specifically shifted the focus of the

14

analysis from the traditional due process, totality-of-

15

the-circumstances case to a more objective, concrete,

16

clear-cut procedure whereby procedures had to be in place

17

to ensure that the individual knew his rights, knew his

18

interrogators would honor those rights, and to provide a

19

knowing and intelligent waiver of those rights.

20

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Hundley, you say shifted.

21

You don't mean superseded, I take it, because I think the

22

voluntariness rule of previous cases still is a

23

constitutional requirement.

MR. HUNDLEY:

QUESTION:

Yes.

2

of the Constitution.

3

MR. HUNDLEY:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that is

4

correct.

5

following Miranda warnings could still be deemed

6

involuntary if physical coercion were present, or other

7

forms of coercion that overbore the will of the

individual, but the benefit of the Miranda rule is that it

14

that to say that it's easily applied is just a myth.

15

I looked into the number of cases that we have

MR. HUNDLEY:

I would respectfully disagree, Mr.

16

Chief Justice.

17

understanding of the case law as it's developed has

18

demonstrated that while initially when the Miranda

19

requirements were new, cases were coming before the Court

20

more steadily.

21

comparing that to, under the old totality-of-the-

22

circumstances analysis, the Court was consistently

23

wrestling with the issue on almost every term.

I believe that in fact perhaps my

1

that, the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis was not a

2

criterion of police conduct.

3

this Court evaluated the voluntariness of the confession,

4

so you are suggesting that what Miranda is is not a

5

substantive rule governing police conduct, but simply a

6

rule that the Court has adopted for all Federal courts as

7

to how Federal courts will procedurally determine, for

8

purposes of admitting evidence, whether the confession was

voluntary.

QUESTION:

Why is that?

Why don't we have -- I

Federal law to use the, you know, prima facie burden-

for title VII.

11

I mean, if title VII cases can be brought in

Why can't we do the same thing with the

Constitution?
MR. HUNDLEY:

Well, Justice Scalia, in that

12

example, that would be an exercise of the Court's Federal

13

statutory jurisdiction, but in cases such as Miranda,

14

unless the Court is interpreting and applying the

15

Constitution, its procedures would not be applicable to

16

the States unless the Court were to embrace the theory put

17

forth by a court-appointed amicus that there is some form

18

of constitutional common law, which this Court to my

19

knowledge has never recognized, and --

QUESTION:

It seems to me you're swallowing the

camel and straining out the gnat.

You're willing to

It is a power which underlies one of the most

QUESTION:

Mr. Hundley, I think you are getting

11

away now from what I thought you had established clearly

12

before, that what we're talking about now is something

3

that's discrete from and in addition to voluntariness,

4

that is, notice and opportunity to exercise your right of

5

silence, and I don't think those two should blended

6

together, because what made Miranda different was not that

7

it did away with the voluntariness law, but that it

8

recognized a discrete right, a procedural right, if you

9

will, but a constitutional right to notice and opportunity

20

of your right to silence.

21

MR. HUNDLEY:

Yes, I agree, Justice --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

5

General

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

7

The position of the United States is based on

8

three propositions, and I'd like simply to state them.

9

First, as this Court's repeated application of Miranda to

10

the States reveals, its rule is a constitutional one.

11

Second --

12

QUESTION:

Well, in our past Miranda cases I

13

think the Government has taken the position that Miranda

14

warnings are not

15

constitutionally required.

16

GENERAL WAXMAN:

That is correct, Justice

17

O'Connor, and in that regard, and I must -- I will say at

18

the outset with regard to all of the, whether it's 30 or

19

50 Miranda decisions this case has decided, the Court is

20

leading, and we are respectfully following, but the Court

21

explained in Miranda that the warnings themselves were not

22

constitutionally required, and it repeatedly invited

23

legislatures, including the national legislature, to enact

24

constitutionally adequate safeguards.

25

Our proposition here is that the rule that the

Court announced in Miranda, that is, in the absence of

2

systemically adequate safeguards the Government can't use

3

as evidence of guilt at a criminal trial an unwarned

statement, must be a constitutional rule because the Court

has in dozens of cases applied it to the State courts, at

the same time repeating that it has --

Justice O'Connor, the Court

given, it is not true that the statement is thereby as a

every post-Miranda case that has tailored and explicated

the doctrine is consistent with this principle, held that,

15

absent a narrow exigency exception, a public safety

exception, the Government may not use as evidence of guilt

other systemically adequate safeguard.

necessarily follow that if the Court has the power to

3

impose the rule by reason of the Constitution, Congress

4

cannot change that rule.

5

It doesn't

In Chapman v. California, which was decided the

6

term after Miranda and which also involved a procedural

7

rule, we said, we have no hesitation in saying that the

8

right of these petitioners not to be punished for

9

exercising their Fifth Amendment right -- the issue was

10

harmless error when there was comment upon their remaining

11

silent.

12

The right of these petitioners, expressly

13

created by the Federal Constitution itself, is a Federal

14

right which, in the absence of appropriate congressional

15

action, it is our responsibility to protect by fashioning

16

the necessary rule.

17

GENERAL WAXMAN:

18

QUESTION:

Justice Scalia, I --

The Court has the power to fashion

19

procedural rules, but that doesn't mean that once it

20

fashions them Congress cannot say, well, you know, we

21

think this goes too far.

22

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Justice Scalia, I could not

23

agree with you more, with an important caveat, and that

24

is, in Miranda itself the Court deliberately, repeatedly,

25

and self-consciously said, this isn't the only rule.

rule, provided it has adequate safeguards.

In other words -- please let me finish.

I'm letting you finish.
In other words, what the Court

said in Miranda in 1966 is what -- is precisely what this

Court said this term in Smith v. Robbins, which is, when

privilege by creating of the rule in the absence of a

legislative safeguard, the legislature can come in with

11

alternatives, but --

I'm glad you said -- I'm glad you

said, what the Court said, because all of that is dictum.

of all subsequent cases, no more is necessary than what I

GENERAL WAXMAN:

When the Court is applying a

22

rule pursuant to its authority to interpret and apply the

23

Constitution, Congress can come up with alternative ways

24

to do it, but it is this Court, under Marbury v. Madison

25

and City of Boerne, that will ultimately decide whether

2

the Constitution is satisfied.
When this -- when the legislature -- when this

3

Court comes up with a rule in the exercise of its

4

supervisory authority, as, for example, the rule for --

5

that the Court -- that 3501 otherwise does away with with

6

respect to the consequences of pre-indictment delay, that

7

is self-consciously a rule imposed on Federal courts only

8

in the exercise of its supervisory authority, Congress

9

gets the last word.

10

And if the Congress of the United States were to

11

take up the Court's suggestion, or any State were to take

12

up the Court's suggestion in Miranda that it has repeated

13

since and come up with alternatives, and we've suggested

14

some of them at page 20 of our reply brief, I would be

15

standing before this Court asking the Court to consider

16

whether or not the alternative safeguards sufficiently

17

protected the Fifth Amendment privilege in this

distinctive context.

QUESTION:

Before you get into detail on that,

tell us the third one and then argue the second.

3

(Laughter.)

4

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Okay.

The third one is that we

5

don't believe that the showing required to overrule

6

Miranda has been made.

7

The second one, which really does precede the

8

third one, is that section 3501 in our view cannot be

9

reconciled with Miranda and therefore could be upheld by

10

this Court only if the Court were to be prepared to

11

overrule Miranda.

12

Now, why do I say that in our view, because it

13

is certainly -- it may be very unusual, but it would not

14

be improper for the Solicitor General of the United States

15

to ask this Court to reconsider and overrule one of its

16

precedents, although in this case we're talking about

17

34 years and, as the Chief Justice has mentioend, 50

18

precedents, but let me just list the four reasons why, in

19

our view, the Court -- the case has not been made to

20

overrule Miranda v. Arizona.

21

First, we think that stability in the law is

22

important, and it is nowhere more important than in this

23

case, given the Court's extremely unhappy experience with

24

the law of confessions under the totality-of-the-

25

circumstances, and the certainty that this Court has

1

2

repeatedly recognized that Miranda provides.
Second, in our view, Miranda, as it has been

3

developed and tailored and refined by this Court, has

4

proven workable, and its benefits to the administration of

5

justice have been repeatedly emphasized by this Court and

6

documented by the Court.

7

Third, in its -- all of its post-Miranda cases,

8

this Court has reaffirmed Miranda's underlying premise,

9

that is that custodial interrogation creates inherently

10
11

compelling pressures that require some safeguards.
And finally, any reevaluation of Miranda must

12

take account of the profoundly unhappy experience of this

13

Court that impelled its adoption.

14

of-the-circumstances test in 36 cases over 30 years before

15

1966, the Court was simply unable to articulate manageable

16

rules for the lower courts to apply.

QUESTION:

Applying the totality-

But General Waxman, that may have

18

just been a misexercise of the certiorari jurisdiction.

19

Perhaps the Court shouldn't have granted all those cases,

20

realizing that it was a rather vague concept.

21

GENERAL WAXMAN:

I -- Mr. Chief Justice, I think

22

actually if the Court were applying its current certiorari

23

standards a number of those csaes would not have been

24

accepted for review, because the articulation of the legal

25

test was set.

The difficulty that this Court found was its

1

2

inability to expound the law, that is, to give to the

3

lower Federal courts a set of articulable, manageable

4

rules that would predictably govern the introduction of

5

confessions in the case in chief.
Let me just say this in that regard.

6

The

7

constitutional test, I think under either the Fifth

8

Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment, is voluntariness.

9

It's, was this -- did the person speak in these

10

circumstances as an exercise of free will, or was his will

11

overborne?
Now, the totality-of-the-circumstances test was

12

13

a legal construct, as the Chief Justice mentioned earlier.

14

It was an -- I think it was the Chief Justice.

effort to impose legal rules on police conduct, and it,

16

itself, included prophylactic rules that the Court

developed over time.

dissent who said, some people can't -- some people's free

2

will can't withstand 36 hours, but I think this man's can.

3

And my only point is that the Court's experience

4

under the totality test was that seemingly the more cases

5

it decided, the less actual guidance was provided to lower

6

courts, and thereby to prosecutors and police, for what

7

the rules were.

8

that will allow us to determine something, something is

9

admissible or not admissible, given the inherent

What is the bright-line legal standard

10

difficulty of determining what actually occurred and what

11

actually happened in the mind of a suspect in this very

12

distinctive context?

13

And we think -- respectfully submit to the Court

14

that in determining whether to overrule Miranda wholesale,

15

which is what we think is required in order to uphold the

16

statute, the Court has to take account, as we have taken

17

account, the status quo ante and whether circumstances

18

have changed so as to return it.

19

QUESTION:

Of course, that complex situation

20

you're describing was a situation based upon the standard

21

we had set forth in Bram, which is what Miranda relied on,

22

which was not the -- which has since been rejected.

3

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Justice Scalia, I agree that

4

the Court in Miranda relied on Bram, but not for that

5

test, which had not been applied by this Court under the

6

totality-of-the-circumstances.

7

The Court in Miranda relied on Bram for the same

8

proposition that the United States relied on it in Miranda

9

itself, which is that the Fifth Amendment applies in the

10

context of custodial interrogation.

11

articulation of the standard was not one that was repeated

12

by the Court in Miranda or applied by the Supreme Court

3
4

That particular

under the totality-of-the-circumstances test.
The Court had long since made clear that what it

5

was looking at under the totality-of-the-circumstances

6

test was consistent with society's mores about appropriate

7

police conduct and, balancing the need for the ability of

8

police and prosecutors to obtain and use confessions

9

against contemporary standards, did the police conduct in

20
21

a particular case go too far?
And the problem with the standard was that,

22

under the totality-of-the-circumstances, everything is

23

relevant and nothing is determinative.

many approaches that the defense could use to attack the

2

confession.
GENERAL WAXMAN:

3

That is absolutely correct, and

4

that's -- as I said -- I don't -- I doubt I'll have time

5

to explicate this, but one of the benefits that this Court

6

has explained as recently as in Minnick and in Moran of --

7

for law enforcement and for the administration of justice

8

generally is the provision of rules that are easily

applied and understood.
And Mr. Chief Justice, you -- whether the number

is 50 or 35, I may not have uncovered them all, but it is

true that as always happens when the Court essentially --

MR. CASSELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to turn immediately to the question

21

that Justice Kennedy posed a moment ago, because I think

it goes to the heart of this case.

gave was yes, which is what they have to say to win this

case.

3

The difficulty with that answer is, it would

4

require this Court to overrule more than a quarter of a

5

century of jurisprudence.

6

Court's holding in Oregon v. Elstad, this Court refused to

7

apply the fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree doctrine, and the

8

reason it gave was that a simple failure to administer

Miranda warnings is not, in itself, a violation of the

To turn, for example, to this

Fifth Amendment.
Justice O'Connor's opinion for the Court went on

12

to say that the Miranda rule may be triggered even in the

13

absence of a Fifth Amendment violation, and it's important

14

to understand what the holding in that case was.

15

holding there was that there was no reason to suppress the

16

fruit of a non-Mirandized statement that is derivative

17

evidence, and the reason this Court gave was, and again I

18

am quoting, there was no actual infringement of the

suspect's constitutional rights.

QUESTION:

But I mean, what does relates -- does

that mean something different than arises out of, or stems

from?

7

MR. CASSELL:

Well, it stems from -- the

8

point -- the way that we would describe the Miranda

procedures is this.

They represented this Court's

10

provisional, interim judgment about how to go about

11

enforcing Fifth Amendment rights.

12

QUESTION:

Now --

Well, is it like the Anders

13

requirements, for example, where we imposed on States and

14

others certain requirements on appellate review?

15

MR. CASSELL:

Yes.

We think it's very similar

16

to the Anders requirement, which just 3 months ago this

Court concluded could be superseded, and I think the term

overruled has been used today.

MR. CASSELL:

Well, like the Solicitor General,

2

we have three arguments as well.

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. CASSELL:

That is our second argument.

Our

5

first -- there are so many good arguments for section

3501.

7

argument is simply that it is this provisional interim

judgment that the Court made that must then recede when

QUESTION:

Mr. Cassell, before you proceed with

12

that, may I ask what you do -- we are dealing with --

13

Miranda is the bedrock decision, and the Court repeatedly

14

said, unless we are shown other procedures which are at

15

least as effective, effective to do what?

16

apprise accused persons of their right of silence in

17

assuring, and in assuring a continuous opportunity to

18

exercise it.

Effective to

I think the Miranda decision said that three

20

times, that what was being protected by these preventative

21

rules was the right of the accused person to know that he

22

could remain silent and would have an opportunity to

23

exercise that right.

MR. CASSELL:

You've certainly accurately quoted

the opinion, Justice Ginsburg.

those sentences that you refer to were not at all

2

necessary to the holding in this Court's decision in

Miranda, and just -QUESTION:

4

I thought Miranda said the police

5

station, station house, is a Fifth Amendment venue in the

6

same way a court is, in the same way a legislative

7

committee that's inquiring into something that may lead to

8

a criminal indictment, and in those settings -- take the

9

court, whether it's the first appearance before a

10

magistrate, whether it's a guilty plea, that's written

11

right into the rules of what the court must advise the

12

defendant, the right to remain silent, that statements can

13

be used against him, the right to counsel.

14

Whenever a defendant is before a judge or a

15

magistrate the defendant will be of course given that

information, and I thought that Miranda said, well, the

17

police station is also a Fifth Amendment venue in that

way.

When we talk about court

Ginsburg, is Minnesota v. Murphy, involving a parole

MR. CASSELL:

2

We're not saying that they're

exactly the same, but we are saying that this Court said,

and I believe this is a paraphrase of the Court's holding

5

in Murphy, that the general Fifth Amendment rule is that

6

warnings and waivers are not required.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Cassell, could I go back to what

8

I think was the kernel of Justice Ginsburg's original

9

question, and that was, she stated an understanding of

10

Miranda which is my understanding, too, and that was that

11

the experience with a system based purely on inquiries

12

into voluntariness had been sufficiently unsatisfactory

13

that the Court said in Miranda, we are going to go to a

14

somewhat different system which we think will produce

15

better results.

16

The justification for going to that system is

17

that we understand that the Fifth Amendment has an

18

application in the station house as well as in the

19

courtroom.

20

system that inquires solely into voluntariness as a matter

21

of fact, but to a system which inquires in the first

22

instance about knowing waiver of Fifth Amendment rights

23

and we accept, the Court said, the proposition that there

24

may be other ways to do this.

25

possibility of equivalents.

Because it does, we are going to go from a

But I think -- and this is where I go back to

1

2

Justice Ginsburg's question.

3

talked about equivalents, that it was talking about

4

equivalents to this knowing waiver kind of system, and the

5

problem that we have with the statute here is that it

6

seems to go from the necessity of a knowing wiaver system,

7

when the statement is to be used in a case in chief, back

8

to a voluntariness system, and that does not seem to be an

9

equivalent, either in fact or in law, as Miranda was using

10

it.

I understood, when the Court

That's the problem I have with the case.

would emphasize, Justice Souter, is this.

if it did, it contradicts nothing but dicta in Miranda and

not the holding of Miranda.

5

MR. CASSELL:

6

QUESTION:

Absolutely correct.

But that's exactly the point which I

7

think Justice Ginsburg and Justice Souter were getting at.

8

Justice Ginsburg quoted one sentence of Miranda.

9

It has to be at least as effective as what?

It has to be

10

at least as effective as probably words that I think

11

probably 2 billion people throghout the world know.
He must be warned, prior to any questioning,

12

13

that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he

14

says can be used against him in a court of law, that he

he cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for

him.

Where rights secured by the Constitution are

involved, there can be no rule-making or legislation that

4

would abrogate them, end of the body of the opinion.

5

Now, given that phrase, and those rights set

6

forth with clarity, what is your response to Justice

7

Ginsburg's question, namely, that Miranda itself says that

8

the phrase that I read, or the equivalent, is demanded by

9

the Constitution?

10

MR. CASSELL:

Well, there are a number of

11

responses, Justice Breyer.

12

that have become very well-known around the world.

13

of those same words appear in the statute that is before

14

the Court today, and you could have similarly read

15

sections 3501(b)(3) and (4) and (5), that talk very

16

specifically about whether a suspect was advised of

17

certain rights, or had counsel present.

18

QUESTION:

First of all, you quoted words

Many

They

consider it simply as a factor, and whatever else may be

20

clear, it is clear that that is not the equivalent to

21

which Miranda referred, as Justice Breyer just quoted it.

QUESTION:

Is that your argument, though?

equivalent.

Justice Souter, our position is this, that the

with respect to the quotation Justice Breyer read you,

were there any rule-making proceedings before the Court in

MR. CASSELL:

MR. CASSELL:

Absolutely.

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and in

The Government has

Miranda, but I'm not sure that that really gets to the

heart of it, because I undertand Miranda to have held and

15

to have explained that the delivery of these warnings and

16

the securing of a knowing waiver is constitutionally

17

necessary to serve the substantive constitutional

18

standards.

1

If that is so, and if we continue to accept that

proposition as so, then it necessarily follows that

21

anything that might substitute for Miranda, assuming

22

that -- the Miranda warnings, assuming that possibility,

MR. CASSELL:

I believe you are, with all

respect, Justice Souter.
The language is tied to the part of the Miranda

inherently compelling, that is, automatically a violation

of the Fifth Amendment, without warnings.

for that reason we are going to go to a waiver-based,

have jettisoned those propositions.

MR. CASSELL:

Well, I would urge the Court to

read carefully, then, the opinion in New York v. Quarles,

which we think takes a different view.

Again, just to quote one passage from the

Justice Ginsburg, we would

through the lens of 25 years of precedents from this

is not articulating constitutional requirements.

It is instead articulating a provisional judgment by this

Congress has now stepped in and provided its

haven't had a chance today to talk about how section 3501

approach.

at all of the factors, and it may well be that the failure

25

to warn a suspect means that the statement is involuntary.

Congress has directed the Courts to take a look

the failure to warn did not mean that an involuntary

May I ask you to clarify one answer

you gave to the Chief Justice about the distinction

between the Fourth Amendment and the self -incrimination

rights are for this Court to declare, but that remedies

are for Congress to determine, and if that's the

dichotomy, rights, but how you implement them is

11

ultimately a legislative judgment, then why wouldn't it

12

follow -- why wouldn't your agument apply just as well to

13

the exclusionary rule?

14

MR. CASSELL:

I thought you were taking the position that

Well, the dichotomy we're trying

15

to draw is between actual violations of the constitutional

right.

operates, there has been a judicial finding that the

defendant's Fourth Amendment rights have been violated?

MR. CASSELL:

That's a conceivable approach.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. HUNDLEY

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13

MR. HUNDLEY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Let

14

me, just in response to Mr. Cassell's argument that this

15

was a mere technical violaton by the police officers

16

conducting this investigation, respond that we firmly

17

believe the district court was correct in its factual

18

finding that the police failed to appropriately apprise

19

Mr. Dickerson of its rights that it wasn't simply a

20

mistake by the prosecutor to introduce evidence.

21

was no evidence.

22

There

I'd also like to point out that it is this Court

23

that sets the limits of the Bill of Rights including the

24

Fifth Amendment, not Congress.

In Miranda, this Court set a constitutional

minimum.

Congress didn't attempt to meet that minimum.

2

Rather, they attempted to roll the clock back and reverse

3

it, and reimpose totality-of-the-circumstances.

4

the reason section 3501 fails.

This is

I would agree with Justice O'Connor's question

5
6

that this case boils down to the sufficiency of 3501 --

7

Does it meet the standards set forth in Miranda? -- and it

8

does not.
QUESTION:

9

In fact, it doesn't --

MR. HUNDLEY:

QUESTION:

It clearly does not.

It doesn't call for the

12

inadmissibility of an involuntary confession.

13

prescribes that it must be admitted if it's voluntary.

14

doesn't even purport to be exclusionary at all.
MR. HUNDLEY:

That's correct.

It just

That's correct,

17

QUESTION:

I assume the Constitution -- you

18

don't need a statute to exclude an involuntary confession,

19

do you?

Doesn't the Fifth Amendment do that on its own?
MR. HUNDLEY:

20

But this Court in Miranda clearly

21

defined that the Fifth Amendment needed additional

22

protections to be fully effective, to be more than a

That happens

automatically with the Fifth Amendment, doesn't it?
MR. HUNDLEY:

That's correct.

If a warned

3

statement is found to be involuntary, it is excluded, but

4

that is really -- the strength and clarity of the Miranda

5

rule is that it provides guidance for the police, it

6

provides guidance for the courts, and it protects the

7

individual's rights.

That's all I have, Your Honors.
