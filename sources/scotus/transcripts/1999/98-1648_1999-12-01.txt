ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. McCONNELL:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Fifth Circuit held that the

10

11

constitutionality of government provision of educational

12

resources pursuant to neutral statutes depends upon the

13

medium in which the resources are provided.

14

say, that if it's provided in the form of a textbook or in

15

the form of a public employee providing remedial education

16

services, it is constitutional, but if the -- but if

17

similar material is provided in the form of

18

computer-assisted instruction or library books, it is

19

unconstitutional.

That is to

I'd like to make two principal points this

20
21

morning.

The first is that the distinctions of this sort

22

have not -- are pedagogically meaningless and

23

counterproductive and have no relation to the principles

24

of the First Amendment, and secondly, that the criteria

25

laid down by this Court in its decision in Agostini v.

Felton, 2 years ago, provide a principal basis for

2

resolution of issues of this sort.

3

The statute at issue here, Chapter 2, was

4

originally enacted in 1965.

It provides for grants to

5

local education agencies through state education agencies

6

for the purchase of educational materials and equipment.

7

Today, that means principally, in the case of non-public

8

schools, library books, computers, computer software, and

9

an equal per-capita sum per student is provided to the

10

local education agency for all students, no matter what

11

accredited school they attend.

12

the statute provides that the LEA will then purchase

13

secular, neutral, and non-ideological materials and

14

equipment which will then provide for the use of the

15

students at the schools where they attend.

16

These materials -- then

The Fifth Circuit held that -- as I said, that

17

the computer-assisted instructional equipment and the

18

textbooks are unconstitutional, relying upon this Court's

19

decisions in the mid -- late 1970's, Meek v. Pittenger and

20

Wolman v. Walter.

21

erroneous decision and that, under the criteria in

22

Agostini v. Felton, this program is entirely

23

constitutional.

It is our submission that that is an

24

Indeed, we don't consider that this case is even

25

particularly difficult because the statute was designed in

a particularly careful way providing safeguards that, if

2

anything, go beyond any constitutional requirement --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. McCONNELL:

5

Mr. McConnell --- that this Court has laid

down.
QUESTION:

6

-- the Fifth Circuit relied primarily

7

on Meek and Wolman, I gather, in its decision.

8

to find in your favor, do you think we need to overrule

9

those cases here?
MR. McCONNELL:

10

In order

Well, Justice O'Connor, I don't

11

think that you actually have to overrule them.

12

that the principle under which those cases was decided has

13

already been explicitly rejected by this Court in

14

Agostini.

15

I think

The judgment in those cases could be sustained

16

because, if you read the opinions carefully, you will see

17

that the Court presumed in those cases that the statutes

18

were not neutral; that is, it analyzed the cases as if

19

what they were looking at were entirely grants to

20

non-public schools which were disproportionately --

21

QUESTION:

But, Mr. McConnell --

22

MR. McCONNELL:

23

QUESTION:

-- religious in nature.

-- that was contrary to fact because

24

the public schools were getting those same benefits.

25

can see you saying, yes, you have to overrule those cases,

So I

1

but the kind of distinction that would be made,

2

to me so artificial, whether it's in one statute that

3

covers public and private or separate statutes added

4

together is the same thing?

5

MR. McCONNELL:

it seems

Well, Your Honor, I'm not going

6

to plead here for keeping Meek and Wolman alive, which I

7

consider to have been decisions that have led to

8

tremendous misunderstanding and mischief in this area and

9
10

QUESTION:

Indeed, you -- you probably would

11

welcome the notion that if you have a statute that is

12

narrowly directed to -- to religious schools, but which

13

gives them nothing more than what is already given to

14

public schools under another statute, that is not a --

15

that is not a statute that is narrowly targeted to

16

religious schools.

17
18

MR. McCONNELL:

Yes,

I agree with you and

Justice Ginsburg on that.

19

The Court in Meek and Wolman did say the

20

contrary, however, and if this Court prefers to

21

distinguish rather than overrule the cases on that ground,

22

it would be able to decide for us without so doing.

23

don't necessarily recommend that.

1

Well,

let me just ask you a question

2

on that.

Do you -- do you adhere to -- subscribe to the

3

fact that there's a distinction between supplanting and

4

supplementing the educational mission?
MR. McCONNELL:

5

Your Honor, this statute does

6

contain a supplement/not supplant requirement which is

7

enforced.

8

required.

9
10

We do not believe that is constitutionally

QUESTION:

That's what I thought.

MR. McCONNELL:

But we also do urge the Court to

11

be -- not to treat that as a constitutional requirement.

12

It isn't really at issue

13

present, and there are contexts,

14

in this Court, where the --

15

QUESTION:

So,

in this case,

since it is

including earlier cases

in your view,

it would be

16

perfectly constitutional

17

to say we will provide all the computers and all the desks

18

for both public and private schools.

19

MR. McCONNELL:

for the -- in a neutral statute

Well, no, Your Honor.

All I

20

would say is that it isn't really necessary for the Court

21

to consider that --

MR. McCONNELL:

That's the place where your position

would take us, wouldn't it?

MR. McCONNELL:

1

Well, that's the place where

2

some earlier decisions of this Court seem to take us --

3

take a reason --

4

QUESTION:

Well,

I'm -- I'm just asking you

5

whether that's -- that's where your position would take us

6

because --

7

MR. McCONNELL:

No, Your Honor.

Our position is

8

that this statute is constitutional, and whether that

9

particular feature of the statute is constitutionally

10

required is not something I think that the Court should

11

decide in a case where it is not at issue.

12

QUESTION:

I guess I'm -- I'm not sure what --

13

what your answer is to Justice Stevens.

14

said, as I understand it, that you don't think that the

15

supplement/supplant distinction is a constitutionally

16

required distinction; is that correct?

MR. McCONNELL:

MR. McCONNELL:

MR. McCONNELL:

QUESTION:

Whether there could --

position.
MR. McCONNELL:

Whether there is a complete

be some degree --

QUESTION:

Well, but if the distinction -- if

the distinction is not required, then I presume there are

10

certain categories of aid in which the government in

11

effect or categories of supply to -- to sectarian schools

that the government could take over completely without

13

violating any constitutional norm.

MR. McCONNELL:

QUESTION:

Well, I --

Maybe I don't understand what you say

when you say the -- the distinction is not

constitutionally required.

of course, an either/or proposition.

There can be

The position I would strongly urge this Court

not to constitutionalize, the idea that any time any

expenditure by the school is displaced that it becomes

automatically unconstitutional.

MR. McCONNELL:

I do believe that would be

unconstitutional, Your Honor, but it's hard to say for

sure because it would depend to a certain extent upon the

nature of the program.

that supplant and supplement perhaps do play a role in --

Suppose you -- a --

religious school that already had window shades, window
shades would be supplanting?
MR. McCONNELL:

Your Honor, that is one of many

problems.

MR. McCONNELL:

QUESTION:

MR. McCONNELL:

Well, the three --

What is the limiting principle?
The three criteria, and there's

5

down in Agostini.

6

governmental inculcation of religion, which we interpret

7

primarily as meaning that the materials must be neutral,

secular, and non-ideological, and there must not be

excessive entanglement.
QUESTION:

10

The other two are that there may not be

When --

But on the Chief Justice's question,

11

every one of those criteria is satisfied.

12

there is -- there is certainly no doctrinal element in the

13

bricks, and his hypothesis is that the school gets turned

14

over and the government's contact with it ceases at the

15

moment the teaching begins.

16

that would be entirely constitutional.

MR. McCONNELL:

well be that there are some limitations having to do with

principle is that we ought to bear in mind in -- in

4

deciding all of these cases, and I want to know what yours

is.

6

MR. McCONNELL:

Your Honor, what I would

recommend to you is that the -- is that the three

principal criteria of Agostini be reaffirmed and that the

lower courts be asked to evaluate specific --

QUESTION:

No, but that does not --

11

MR. McCONNELL:

QUESTION:

-- statutes and circumstances.

With respect,

I don't think that

3

answers our question because it seems to me that in answer

4

to the question a moment ago,

Agostini principles, you in effect came up with a scheme

which would lead to the conclusion in the Chief Justice's

hypothesis that building the school for the -- for the

8

parochial school would be entirely constitutional.

in referring to the three

You back off from that conclusion,

understand why you would, but I don't know what your

MR. McCONNELL:

Well, with respect, the reason I

7

resist the hypothesis is the very purpose of the

autonomy of schools that comes from the types of

You said that the statute did a lot of things

that the Constitution did not require, and I'm still

materials like a computer which in effect are neutral,

they can transmit anything and be used for anything, for

As I understand the debate that took place

within the Court on that question was whether you could

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

3

MR. McCONNELL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

4

Essentially, what this case is about is bringing

5

programs of this sort up -- up to date, that the Meek and

6

Wolman, the cases upon which the Fifth Circuit relied and

7

the Respondents are mired in the technology of the 1970's

8

and the jurisprudence of the 1970's -- since that time,

9

education has changed and this Court's doctrines have

10

11

changed.
There may very well be limits on -- if the

12

government in some hypothetical case which seems

13

politically extremely unlikely were to assume total

14

support for schools, that would mean that the religious

15

elements within those schools are being subsidized by the

16

government, but that has not been enacted.

This Court should take cases one at a time, and

19

when the Congress passes a statute that provides secular,

20

neutral, non-ideological equipment and material for

21

children on a neutral basis, that not only is not a

22

constitutional threat, Your Honors, that is something

23

which is in the finest tradition of the First Amendment

24

because it leaves people free to be able to make

25

educational choices for themselves.

The government then is not subsidizing and it is

not favoring religion, but on the other hand,

the rather illiberal position of denying basic
