^

We'll hear argument

MR. HORWITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question here is does the payment to a

12

hospital for treatment of Medicare patients constitute

13

receipt of benefits under a Federal program involving

14

Federal assistance.

15

I submit the answer is no.

Under section 666, the Federal statute that

16

extends bribery and theft to what would otherwise be local

17

governments and local organizations,

18

the statute here,

19

entity or that product that is being administered or cared

20

for by a surrogate of the Federal Government, which was

21

why this legislation was passed.

22

in this case equated benefits with payment.

23

the plain language of

I submit, would define benefits as that

QUESTION:

And the Eleventh Circuit

Mr. Horwitz, the -- the section is

24

quite lengthy.

Is there some particular section, a

25

subsection you want us to focus on?

MR. HORWITZ:

Yes.

Subsection (b), Your Honor,

2

which provides that an -- subsection (b) is the

3

jurisdictional section for --

QUESTION:

MR. HORWITZ:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. HORWITZ:

8

B as in buzz or D as in does?
B as in boy, Your Honor.

Boy, okay.
Subsection (a) sets out the

prohibited activity, basically theft in subpart (1), then
bribery or soliciting a bribe.

Subpart (b) is the

10

jurisdictional limitation of the statute -- B as in boy -

11

- which says that the statute applies to organizations

12

that receive benefits in excess of $10,000 under a Federal

13

program involving grant, contract, insurance, or other

14

form of Federal assistance.

15

(b) is the jurisdictional element which is -- I submit

16

under the legislative history, was included along with

17

subsection (c) so as to not extend this Federal

18

jurisdiction into what would and should be otherwise State

1

law enforcement activity.

20

QUESTION:

So, that's -- that subsection

Isn't the difficulty of your

21

position, just based on what you've just quoted, the

22

statute refers to the Government as getting the benefits?

23

So, I suppose it follows from what you're saying that the

24

statute would never have any application to a Medicare or

25

Medicaid -- a government that gives money to a Medicare or

And the reason is that -- that the Medicare

The benefit here is to the

11

QUESTION:

Okay.

12

QUESTION:

Well, but in a way the benefit goes

13

to the provider as well because we're dealing here with

14

Medicare services by a hospital when they weren't getting

15

paid anything for people who couldn't afford to pay.

16

Medicare was enacted, and now all of a sudden, a hospital

17

can get paid for doing something that it was getting

18

saddled with without pay before.

MR. HORWITZ:

So,

And in a sense, the

Your Honor, in the sense of

21

benefits in the sense of a -- a verb, anyone who receives

Toro, Hinton, and Mosley cases and which arose and why

Congress passed this law before the Dixson case sort of

administration of assets of the Federal Government through

think Congress would have said that.

QUESTION:

Yes, but that does seem to be what it

12

-- it says when it -- when it refers to -- under

13

subsection (b), when it refers to benefits under a program

14

involving a grant, contract, subsidy, and so on.

15

sounds -- I mean, the immediate -- most immediate reading

16

of that language says, oh, whatever the -- whatever the

17

organization gets under the grant, program, subsidy, and

18

so on, is -- is what the statute is referring to as a

19

benefit because that's the only kind of benefit that --

that organizations get.

natural reading of the statute.

that hospital is paid for these services, it's no longer

QUESTION:

There's no -- once

Well, it isn't with respect to a

7

given item of charge, but that doesn't mean that the

8

Government's concern is -- is somehow over because the

Government may have a -- a broader, systemic concern even

10

though a particular item of charge has already been paid,

11

and in that respect, it's no longer the Government's

It might, but I would submit that

QUESTION:

But there is.

You've admitted that

3

there is on your analysis because on your analysis the

benefit, is always the patient at the end of the -- at the

end of the line.

Honor, a exception for Medicaid --

And so, it does seem to read the statute

MR. HORWITZ:

Your Honor, the Medicare benefits

are subject to the protection as long as they stay within

10

the program funds.

For example, if someone in the

11

intermediary were to solicit a bribe for making a cost

12

determination that was beneficial to the hospital, that

13

intermediary receives the benefits and disburses those
benefits and helps disburse those benefits and is acting

14

15
16
17

as a surrogate for the Government to protect that.
QUESTION:

So -- so, benefit would include ill-

gotten gain.

18

MR. HORWITZ:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. HORWITZ:

No.

Is that what you're saying?
No, Your Honor.

I'm saying that

22

in the Medicare system to provide the beneficiary -- that

23

is, the patient -- with its services.

MR. HORWITZ:

There is a distinction between

7

administration of the Federal funds ends, and the

8

individual or company at that point or State, whoever

9

supplies that service, then has the funds to do it as they

wish.

So, there is a distinction between

be imagined, even a -- paying a farm company not to grow

When they receive those funds, it's over.

the Federal Government no longer has an interest in

17

analysis, somebody -- an employee who steals a tractor has

18

now committed a Federal offense because the farm company

19

has received assistance in the sense of it hasn't planted

20

crops.

21

QUESTION:

Under the receipt of benefits

Mr. Horwitz, before we go on to your

22

parade of horribles, I take it from what you've said

24

that all hospitals that administer Medicare that receive

So, could -- the Government could go

after the fiscal intermediary, but could not go after the

MR. HORWITZ:

MR. HORWITZ:

It doesn't get aid.

Yes, Your Honor.

And -- and I

would say that when the hospital is paid for the service,

12

that -- the coverage of 666 is ended.

13

The -- the Government, as it -- as it mentioned

in its brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari,

recognized that there are many other statutes passed that

specifically protect the Medicare system.

MR. HORWITZ:

Your Honor, if the hospital were

to bribe the intermediary, it would be covered.
QUESTION:

No, no.

But I'm saying if

you say that the -- if, as the Government says, the

hospital itself falls under this statute -- never mind the

intermediary, the hospital itself -- the hospital would

not normally be the person who -- who would be prosecuted.

It would -- the person prosecuted would be somebody

QUESTION:

You were talking about subsection

of a -- by an -- a local agency administering funds.

18

Section 201 was the statute that was attempted to be

applied in that setting, and if one looks at section 201,

to subject all the employees of that company to Federal

MS. BLATT:

QUESTION:

It may be fair, but has the

I mean, to be

sure, all that (b) says is the circumstance referred to -

- is that the organization receives in any 1-year period

Now, you're now saying

that indeed the hospitals may receive some other Federal
10

benefits in excess of $10,000.

11

MS. BLATT:

12

QUESTION:

Our position -I thought the only thing you were

13

relying upon was the fact that it's reimbursed for the

14

services that it provides to Medicare recipients in excess

15

of $10,000.

16

Wasn't that the only reliance --

No.

Our position is that the

MS. BLATT:

Well, to the extent that there's

some requirement that the hospitals be considered in and

we don't think the statute requires it.

You're now saying you take the position that even if

There is no such distinction under

So, it's true that the record didn't reflect

But this Court -- Court will recall

a reconciliation to see whether they're ahead or behind.

But our fundamental point is not that they get

6

MS. BLATT:

Say I'm wrong if I'm wrong.

I think the best way to look at it

7

is that Medicare is essentially a grant to hospitals that

is calibrated to the cost of providing the federally

funded services.

It is true the beneficiaries are the

10

patients -- the program beneficiaries.

11

different than the prototypical financial assistance

programs Congress had in mind when it passed this statute,

and whether in the Model Cities program they said to an

Your Honor, it would apply --

QUESTION:

Okay.

Why doesn't it apply to your

hospital if your hospital received funds in advance and

4

simply has to wait in order to draw down on them?

MR. HORWITZ:

The hospital -- I think the key -

QUESTION:

Or wait --or has to wait in order to

8

make a legitimate claim to them even though it can draw

9

down.
MR. HORWITZ:

10

I'll try to answer this briefly

11

with the Government's contention here -- and it was

12

stated, even in the argument -- is simply this is still

13

Federal money.

14

money.

15

of C.F.R.'s they never once talk about this money as a

16

grant.

17

whether the provider is paid 1 day in advance or 1 day

18

behind, it's still payment for services.

19

money.

20

22

They want to say this is still Federal

This is a grant.

In all those thousands of pages

It's a payment for services to the provider.

And

It's not Federal

All of the -- Mosley, Hinton, Del Toro cases all
talk about administering Federal funds.
QUESTION:

You don't challenge that, Mr.

23

Horwitz, Ms. Blatt's statement that sometimes it may be a

24

little bit ahead, sometimes it may be a little bit behind

25

so far as the actual accounting is concerned?

MR. HORWITZ:

1

That may very well be, Your Honor,

2

and I don't think that's -- it's -- in any event, the

3

C.F.R. makes clear that what the hospital is getting is

4

cost reimbursement and they may have to adjust that cost

later.

QUESTION:

What do you do about the argument

7

that that's what's happening in the Model Cities program?

Job training.

the money or the organization that gets the money is being

11

You're getting the -- the company that gets

reimbursed for the cost of providing job training.
MR. HORWITZ:

Because the question still is, is

12

that all that is involved?

13

this with a grant, and a grant indicates there's some

14

providing of ultimate service.

15

is given money to administer a service and, say, that's

has still not been handed out.

interest in making sure that that person doesn't -- isn't

19

bribed to hand out a methadone pill to somebody who

doesn't deserve it.

for the service.

22

The Government wants to equate

If a -- if a local entity

The Government has an

That's different from simply paying

And, yes, Medicare is complicated.

There are

thousands of pages of regulations, but not one time does

We may have to fight with you about what the
