ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. WALLACE MALLEY, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. MALLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This Court has asked us, of course, to brief and

12

argue an additional issue in this case, and with the leave

13

of the Court, I would like to begin with that issue.

14

QUESTION:

We asked you to brief the additional

15

issue.

16

didn't ask you to argue it.

I think you're perfectly free to argue it.

We

17

MR. MALLEY:

18

The additional issue, of course, is whether a

Thank you.

Thank you, Your Honor.

19

private person has Article III standing to litigate claims

20

of fraud against the Government.

21

of the False Claims Act, we would submit not, Your Honor.

22

And within the context

Taking the respondents' own view of this case

23

that all that has been asserted here are the injuries to

24

the United States -- and I would invite this Court's

25

attention to paragraph 44 of the -- of the relator's

1

complaint in this case at page 40 of the joint appendix -

2

- the claim is that the United States has been damaged.

3

There is no claim in this case that this relator has been

4

damaged.

5

So, in that circumstance, there is no standing,

6

for under this Court's determination in -- in the Lujan

7

case, the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing

8

is, of course, injury in fact, actual and particularized

9

to this plaintiff.

And as Judge Weinstein indicated in

10

the dissenting opinion below, up to the moment he filed

11

this action, this relator had no greater interest than any

12

taxpayer.

13

So, this complainant -QUESTION:

But I guess we've had some form of

14

qui tarn suits authorized by Congress since the earliest

15

days, haven't we?

16
17

MR. MALLEY:

We have, Your Honor, and I think,

Justice O'Connor, the --

18

QUESTION:

And perhaps authorizing them in -- in

19

circumstances where the relator would not have an injury

20

in fact, as we know it.
MR. MALLEY:

21

Some circumstances, and I think

22

that the key part of your question, Your Honor, was in

23

some form.

24

brief on this tomorrow, and we've taken a look at all of

25

these -- these statutes --

Now, we of course are going to be filing our

QUESTION:

The early statutes?

2

MR. MALLEY:

The early statutes in the first

3

Congress, and if I've got my sort of head count correct, I

4

-- we've counted about 17 statutes.

5

into situations which don't raise any -- any standing

6

issue whatsoever.

7
8

And of those, 14 fall

We have --

QUESTION:

Because the relator would have

suffered an injury in fact?

9

MR. MALLEY:

Well, there's a couple of ways it

10

plays out.

11

largest single category is where the individual just has a

12

bounty, doesn't have any right to bring the case into

13

court, but just gets a bounty at -- at the tail end.

14

that doesn't raise a standing issue.

15

about three or four where the -- the case can be brought

16

into court by a -- by an individual who's -- who is a

17

Federal official.

18

to regard that as a case that's brought by the United

19

States by a Federal official notwithstanding the fact that

20

Federal official can also claim part of the bounty.

21

One -- one would be that -- that probably the

So,

And then there's

Now, in that instance I think it's fair

QUESTION:

Is the fact that this qui tarn relator

22

entitled to some portion of the recovery at the end of the

23

day -- does that make it a sort of bounty?

24
25

MR. MALLEY:

The fact that this qui tarn relator

is entitled to something I think that -- that that -- that

1

is a bounty which gives this relator an incentive to sue.

2

But, of course, under the Valley Forge decision of this

3

Court, that strong incentive and the fervor of the -- of

4

the litigant's convictions is not enough to grant

5

standing.

6

QUESTION:

The bounty -- the bounty cases you

7

were referring to I take it are cases in which the -- the

8

suit may be initiated by the -- or was the suit initiated

9

by the bounty receiver or it's just that if he brought the

10

matter to the attention of the Government, the Government

11

would sue, and at the end of the suit he'd get a bounty?

12

MR. MALLEY:

In that first group I was talking

13

about -- I think there's five in this category -- they

14

would bring the attention -- bring it to the attention of

15

the Government, the Government would sue, and there would

16

be a -- a bounty at -- at the tail end.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. MALLEY:

19

Right.
There -- there were, of course, a

small number of cases --

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. MALLEY:

There were some.
-- and our count is three -- where

22

it would appear that -- that the individual could bring

23

the claim into court himself or herself.

24

one of those was actually a -- a criminal case in --

25

QUESTION:

But of course,

But there was a common law background

2

what was the original understanding of standing.

common law suit could be initiated by the -- by the

4

private person.

5

If -- if you -- if you -- we're trying to fathom

MR. MALLEY:

The

There is that common law

6

background.

7

this -- in this instance, Your Honor, is -- is what the

8

Court has indicated in Marsh v. Chambers and that is it's

9

one thing where there's a -- a continuous and unambiguous

10

historic record which -- which creates a practice which -

11

- which has become a part of the fabric of our society.

12

But of course, I think what's critical in

But it's -- but that certainly is not even

13

remotely the case here where we have had some form of the

14

so-called qui tarn actions in various permutations.

15

were very popular at the time of the first Congress, of

16

course, fell into disuse, and -- and really wasn't revived

17

again until this formulation under the False Claims Act,

18

which in and of itself fell into -- into disuse between

19

1943 and 1986.

20

They

So, I don't think we have the situation here

21

where we can look back and get a clear message from the

22

historic record, whether it be from English common law or

23

from our own American jurisprudence.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, the common law doesn't --

doesn't necessarily prove anything.

would violate the new doctrine of separation of powers

that would be

MR. MALLEY:

No, Your Honor,

I -- I don't think

16

that's the case, and this is -- this is the reason why.

17

-- I think that -- Mr. Chief Justice,

18

these qui tam statutes were all of a kind where -- where

19

we could see a common thread there, then we might be able

20

to draw some inferences from that.

21

that is -- that is not the case.

alone cannot -- cannot overcome the irreducible

constitutional minimum of -- of Article III standing.

1

controversies in the context of -- of these so-called qui

2

tarn actions.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Malley, may I just go back with a

4

technical question to your -- your point earlier that

5

until the action was filed, the qui tarn plaintiff has no

6

greater interest than -- than any taxpayer?

7

question is this.

8

My technical

If the qui tam plaintiff gives what I guess --

9

it's the 60-day notice of an intent to commence such a

10

suit and during that period, the United States decides

11

that -- the Justice Department decides that it in fact

12

will initiate the action, under those circumstances, if

13

the Government wins the case, does the qui tam plaintiff

14

get anything?

15
16

MR. MALLEY:

Well, I think -- I think that not

without violating the Eleventh Amendment, Your Honor.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. OLSON:

Well, what does the statute provide?
The statute -- the statute provides

19

that while the Government takes over the action, that --

20

that the -- the relators still can make a claim for the

21

portion of recovery.

22

QUESTION:

Let me ask you another question.

23

Assuming the Government never intervenes, as it has a

24

right to do in one of these actions, would it be res

25

judicata on the Government afterwards?

MR. MALLEY:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. MALLEY:

Yes, Your Honor.
Do you know?
But the point -- the point really

4

that -- that I think is -- is urgent in this case -- that

5

is,

6

both ways.

7

run headlong into the -- to the bar of the Eleventh

8

Amendment or --

that -- is that this relator cannot -- cannot have it

9

Either -- either they have standing and then

QUESTION:

Well, let's talk about that because I

10

think we've injected you into this whole issue that you've

11

been talking about after the -- the petition was filed.

12

Are you going to address those issues of whether the State

13

is a person and the Eleventh Amendment concerns?

14

MR. MALLEY:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

We believe

15

that -- that all three issues are in play in this case,

16

and both the statutory construction issue which, you know,

17

harkening back to Mr. Chief Justice's remarks in the last

18

case,

19

issue involved,

20

constitutional issues.

21

construction issue is in play and certainly the Eleventh

22

Amendment issue.

23
24
25

that where there's a -- where there's a statutory
then the Court normally does not go to the

QUESTION:

Okay, but this is -- this is on

interlocutory posture,
MR. MALLEY:

So, we feel the statutory

is it?
It is.

QUESTION:

1

And normally we wouldn't take

2

jurisdiction over the interpretation of the statute I

3

guess.

4

MR. MALLEY:

Normally you certainly wouldn't,

5

and particularly in the case where it's an unrelated

6

issue.

7

read the Swint case as having left the door open.

8

if the Court has before it a case that's --

9
10

11

But as the courses -- in -- in the Swint case, we

QUESTION:

If --

We didn't answer it, but suggested

that we hadn't decided it.
MR. MALLEY:

Exactly, Your Honor, and I think

12

that -- I think that -- that in all likelihood, if I can

13

just speculate, the reason for that was to leave open the

14

option in -- in those circumstances where the issues are

15

inextricably intertwined and where -- it might not be

16

meaningful to -- to answer the -- you know, the -- the

17

central question without answering the other.

18

And here, when we're dealing with the Eleventh

19

Amendment, I mean, what do you look to?

20

to, well, who -- who is suing and who can be sued.

21

- and examination of the statute is rather critical to

22

looking to that issue.

23

certainly fair game.

24
25

You have to look
And -

So, I -- we believe it's -- it's

And even the Eleventh Amendment issue, as
compared to the -- to the Article III standing issue,

1

admitting the fact that this -- this Court has -- has

2

indicated a strong preference to go to the Article III

3

issue first, still the -- the Eleventh Amendment issue is

4

one that is a jurisdictional issue, and I think this Court

5

in the Shack case recognized that -- that it -- that it

6

enjoyed a status -- a jurisdictional status, perhaps

7

somewhere between subject matter jurisdiction and personal

8

j urisdiction.

9

And -- and so, we believe they're -- they're co­

10

equal and the Court could choose, particularly in the

11

aftermath of all Alden and Blatchford, which has really

12

developed the issue for this case -- could choose to go

13

straight to the Eleventh Amendment issue.

14

QUESTION:

I -- I can -- I can accept that as a

15

possibility, but -- but not perhaps going to the statutory

16

issue.

17

the statutory issue in order to -- in order -- I mean, the

18

fact is you -- you have a State as a defendant.

19

a private party as -- as the plaintiff.

Why is it intertwined?

MR. MALLEY:

20

Why do we have to resolve

You have

No, certainly, Justice Scalia, I

21

did not mean to suggest that the Court has to go to that

22

issue.

23

left the door open should it -- should it choose to

24

address the statutory issue as a -- as a way -- as being

25

prior to the constitutional issue.

I was only suggesting the Swint case seems to have

1

suggest that -- that this Court has tied its hands in any

2

way.

3

That's all.
QUESTION:

But certainly -- certainly we also

4

have a -- a practice we don't go to constitutional issues

5

if we don't have to.

6

argue that the statutory issue should come before the

7

Eleventh Amendment issue at any rate.

8

intend to make States liable under qui tarn, you don't get

9

the Eleventh Amendment issue I would think.

10

MR. MALLEY:

And as you suggest, there you can

If Congress didn't

And -- and we're -- I guess what

11

I'm saying, Your Honor, is we would be happy if the Court

12

addressed this case on any of the three issues.

13

(Laughter.)

14

QUESTION:

I -- I understand that, but -- but

15

just -- just to get the record straight, do you know of

16

any case where, in order to avoid a constitutional issue,

17

we have ignored a jurisdictional question and jumped

18

straight to the statutory question in order to avoid the

19

constitutional question which was a jurisdictional one?

20
21

MR. MALLEY:

No.

I -- I cannot -- I cannot cite

one to the Court, and --

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. MALLEY:

Because there is none.
And I -- and I certainly wouldn't

24

suggest that, you know, the Court, you know, has -- has to

25

go that direction.

MR. MALLEY:

Eleventh Amendment -QUESTION:

5

Many of our jurisdictional questions

Absolutely, Your Honor, and the

Yes, but on Eleventh Amendment

6

jurisdiction, we usually ask whether there's a clear

7

statement or not first, and if no clear statement, then we

8

don't -- don't reach the Eleventh Amendment issue.

that our practice?

QUESTION:

MR. MALLEY:

QUESTION:

17

And this is much the same thing,

isn't it?

That -- that has been the practice,

of course, as -- as stated in the -- in the Will case.

Isn't

And -- and -The same kind of statutory question.

What's a person?
MR. MALLEY:

On the other hand, this Court has

18

indicated its -- its preference to go to jurisdictional

19

issues as a threshold matter.

20

I think the choices are there.

QUESTION:

So, I -- all I'm saying is

One thing we know for sure is you

only have half an hour to argue.

(Laughter. )

2

MR. MALLEY:

The -- the critical -- the critical

3

portion of the Eleventh Amendment article, which --

4

argument which I really have not had a chance to -- to

5

speak much to, stems from the fact that we have a qui tarn

6

relator, a private person of his own motivation, of his

7

own initiative, his own motivation, and under the Hughes

8

case, a motivation for personal gain and -- and perhaps

9

ill will and -- and not for the public good, has brought

10

the State of Vermont into court without its consent.

11

we believe that violates the -- the Eleventh Amendment,

12

and most particularly, the interest as laid forth in -- in

13

this Court in the Alden and Blatchford cases where the

14

nature of the consent to suit by the United States in the

15

plan of the convention was a suit brought by responsible

16

Federal officials exercising political responsibility.

17

QUESTION:

And

Is -- is there an argument here that

18

whatever the force of your position is, it has been -- it

19

MR. MALLEY:

The contract -- the agreement under

2

which we entered into this arrangement required that the

3

State of Vermont submit to a range of -- of remedies.

4

Most particularly are those under 40 C.F.R., part 31 which

5

require for a full range of supplying records to the

6

United States, submitting to performance reviews, the

7

possibility of withholding cash payments, the possibility

8

of disallowing part of prior costs, suspension of the

9

program, even -- even that the United States Environmental

10

Protection Agency could come in and -- and take over and

11

operate these Clean Water Act programs.

12

nothing in there suggesting that -- that part of the deal

13

was that -- that the State of Vermont had to comply with a

14

False Claims Act and particularly one that -- that doesn't

between the two, Your Honor.

plaintiffs, then obviously we would have to -- we would

the issue is whether the State can be a - - can be a

defendant person, then the -- the test is so different

3

that I don't think that they provide any real

4

comparability.

5

For example, under the Will case, it was the

6

fact that -- that defining the term person to include a

State implicated actions which upset the constitutional

8

balance between State and Federal governments, and for

9

that reason, it -- it implicated the clear statement rule.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

well.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, again, there is a single,

unitary judgment out of which the -- the -- in a way the

4

United States and the relator in that way could be looked

5

at as joint tenants, and a -- and a joint tenant is

6

typically empowered to protect the interests on behalf of

both tenants.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Kneedler -These are just analogies, but I

10

think they show why a single judgment in which one person

11

has an interest was enough to give a -- a concrete stake.

12

I'm sorry.

13

QUESTION:

Would you adopt in any way as a fall­

14

back position that the False Claims Act includes the State

15

as a person if the United States is bringing the suit, but

16

does not include the State as a person if a private

17

individual is bringing the suit?

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, we certainly think if the

19

Court were to conclude that -- that a clear statement is

20

required that's not for the relator -- that wouldn't be

21

true for the United States, and I -- but that would --

22

that would come under 3730, not the definition of person

23

but who could bring a cause of action under 3730 (a)

24

which distinguished the Attorney General and -- and the

25

private relator.

1

don't think that that makes any logical sense.
QUESTION:

2

Because you did say in your brief one

3

of the reasons the United States has a large stake in this

4

is that the United States itself couldn't sue under the

5

False Claims Act.
MR. KNEEDLER:

6

Right, and we think that -- we

7

think that's a particular reason why the idea that the

8

statute should be saved by construing States not to be

9

persons, it would be an odd sort of saving of -- saving

10

construction to deprive the United States of suing States

11

when States receive $250 billion a year now.

12

QUESTION:

Well, but that's --

13

QUESTION:

Well, presumably the United States

14

has an -- an array of additional remedies.

15

the State is going to get away with something, is it?
MR. KNEEDLER:

16

It's not like

No, but Congress specifically

17

determined in 1986 that those other remedies were

18

inadequate and that the False Claims Act measures,

19

including the provisions for informers to bring

20

information to the United States or to -- to file suit

21

were critical to ferret out and -- and redress.
QUESTION:

22

But that's the very point.

Hundreds

23

of billions of dollars of joint programs means that when

24

you bring the States in, it changes the nature of the

25

statute.

It's one thing to have private people, you know,

It's quite another to set loose an

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

That's

But that -- that concern does not

10

go to the question of whether the United States itself

11

should be able to bring a False Claims Act -QUESTION:

12

No, no.

It goes to the question of

13

whether you take the word person, which up till 1986 has

14

in practice been included not States, and then just say

15

that a background statement and a couple of other little

16

-- little things in the statute, maybe worth an ounce

17

each, should be taken to work what I would characterize

pejoratively -- I don't really mean it -- as a kind of

19

revolution in the way the States -- potentially a

20

revolution in the way that the States -MR. KNEEDLER:

I wanted to just -- several things on the

1

2

Eleventh Amendment, if I may.

3

New Hampshire v. Louisiana I think is the

4

principal case where the Court found that there was an

5

Eleventh Amendment bar because the State was not the real

6

party in interest, even though nominally the plaintiff.

7

The -- the claim was really being brought on behalf of

8

private individuals.

9

And here I think we have really the reverse

10

situation where the relator is really representing the

11

interests of the United States in a lawsuit, but the

12

United States is substantially a real party in interest in

13

the case.

14

And -QUESTION:

There -- there the -- the finding was

15

that the plaintiff was -- was not the real party in

16

interest.

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

But because there was a -- a

18

private party that stood behind the State that -- that

19

stood to benefit, and here we have very much the same

20

thing, that although the relator brings the suit, he first

21

of all brings it in the name of the United States to

22

recover for the United States.

23

stands behind the relator, although the relator has a

24

personal interest -- stands behind the relator as a real

25

party in interest in the lawsuit.

And the United States

derivative.

This is not a situation like Alden v. Maine

The plaintiff's interest in this

And the -- a False Claims Act suit, whether

brought by the relator or brought by the United States,

retains its public character throughout.

The United

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. MALLEY:

Thank you, and may it please the

Court:

5

I'd just like to focus on the inconsistency

6

which I believe I just heard from the Government's case.

On the one hand,

the relator has no prior injury in this case, no prior

injury prior to bringing this suit.

case,

the Government admits that it has -- that

Why can't you assign a claim to

2

it's an assignment, and -- but -- but they still have it.

3

And that's exactly the problem here, is that --

4

They want to both say that it's --

is that on the one hand, they want to say it's only the

5

United States' claim that's being brought here, and in

6

that case there's a standing problem.

7

they want to say that once the case is filed, that -- that

the relator captures it and makes it his own.

9

that's the case, then it's an Eleventh Amendment problem.

On the other hand,

MR. MALLEY:

No, Your Honor.

But I'm just

submitting this is not an assignee here.
QUESTION:

11

Well, if the Government had assigned

12

the claim in toto to the relator, I suppose the relator

13

could sue without any trouble and clearly have standing.

MR. MALLEY:
