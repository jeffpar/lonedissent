ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL A. STRANDNESS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

9

MR. STRANDNESS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it --

and may it please the Court:

10

This is a diversity case that was tried under

11

North Dakota law arising out of a fire that resulted in

12

the death of Bonnie Weisgram.

13

jury found in favor of the plaintiff, but the court of

14

appeals reversed in a split 2 to 1 decision, finding that

15

certain expert testimony, or portions of their testimony,

16

had been improperly admitted by the district court judge.

After a 2-week trial, the

17

In addition to reversing the decision, the court

18

decided, on review of the record, that the plaintiff could

19

not produce a case on which it would be entitled to go to

20

the jury and, therefore, directed judgment be entered on

21

behalf of the defendants.

22

QUESTION:

That ruling was error.

Mr. Strandness, I noticed that in the

23

-- the Eighth Circuit's opinion, the opinion of the

24

majority, they did not cite the Martin Eby case from this

25

Court which seems to me to have a great deal to do with

whether they were right or wrong.

2

with that case in your discussion.

I presume you will deal

3

MR. STRANDNESS:

I will, Your Honor.

4

The question becomes what happens next, what

5

happens next to this case once the court of appeals has

6

made this decision.

7

QUESTION:

You -- you phrase the -- the decision

8

a little tendentiously.

You said that -- that they

9

determined that the plaintiff could not produce enough

10

evidence to go to the jury.

11

that.

12

produced --

They -- they didn't really do

They -- they decided that the plaintiff had not

13

MR. STRANDNESS:

14

QUESTION:

This --

-- enough evidence to -- to entitle

15

the case to go to the jury, and that's what the issue is,

16

whether -- whether the plaintiff has to be given another

17

chance.

18

MR. STRANDNESS:

Justice Scalia, what the court

19

of appeals did was to take the record and to delete from

20

that record that was before the jury excerpts of experts'

21

testimony.

22

record and decided that there was insufficient evidence to

23

support the jury's verdict and then issued judgment as a

24

matter of law for the defendant.

25

Then the court of appeals looked at that

QUESTION:

Well, but we -- I take it the case is

1

being argued on the assumptions, A, that the -- the expert

2

testimony was properly stricken, and B, that without it,

3

there was insufficient evidence to return a verdict in

4

favor of the plaintiff.

5

on which we're going to proceed in our argument this

6

morning.

7

MR. STRANDNESS:

Those -- those are the predicates

That's correct, Your Honor,

8

that the -- it's not before the Court the issue as to

9

whether or not the court of appeals properly or

10

improperly -QUESTION:

11

So -- so -- and your position is that

12

when the court of appeals finds that the evidence

13

submitted to the jury was insufficient to justify a

14

verdict for the plaintiff, it may never order a judgment

15

for the defendant.

16

MR. STRANDNESS:

That's not our position, Your

17

Honor.

18

where there has been testimony that has been deleted from

19

the record, that the fairest and best rule would be to

20

remand the case back to the district court for further

21

determinations according to the evidentiary rulings of the

22

court of appeals.

23

Our position is that in a situation such as this

QUESTION:

Well, then -- then you're saying in

24

-- I -- I think what you just said perhaps is inconsistent

25

or at least it seems to me inconsistent with your answer

to Justice Kennedy's question.

2

saying that has to be done in every case, but you're

3

saying that the fairest and best rule would be.

4

you leave nothing to the discretion of the court of

5

appeals?

6

MR. STRANDNESS:

7

QUESTION:

He -- you say you're not

I would --

I think you -- I think you run right

8

up against our Martin Eby case if you don't leave

9

discretion to the court of appeals.

10

Are -- do

MR. STRANDNESS:

The discretion of the court of

11

appeals involves situations where the record is left

12

intact and they're simply looking at the record to make

13

determinations as sufficiency of the -- the evidence that

14

was heard by the jury.

15

question to me -- I guess I would say that in a situation

16

such as this, that what we're asking for is an automatic

17

remand rule.

18

QUESTION:

And Justice Kennedy, in his

I think that that is your position,

19

and I -- and I -- when you say things were deleted from

20

the record, by reason of the expert testimony going --

That's correct.

It was --

witness is inadmissible.

MR. STRANDNESS:

Exactly, but what is

different -QUESTION:

But -- but do you say that it has to

5

be automatically remanded to the trial court and then the

6

trial court still has discretion to decide whether to

7

grant a new trial?

8

10

11

MR. STRANDNESS:

That's correct, Justice

O'Connor, that the trial court is in the best position
because the trial -QUESTION:

On what basis?

What is the criterion

12

that you want the trial court to -- to apply?

13

guesses that the plaintiff could come up with another

14

expert or what?

15

MR. STRANDNESS:

Whether it

The same criteria that any

16

trial court, any district court, uses in exercising

17

discretion in making decisions such as admitting expert

18

testimony, on making decisions as to whether or not to

19

grant summary judgment, as to making decisions as to

20

whether or not --

But -- but there's -- there's

virtually no discretion as to whether or not to grant

summary judgment.

the same position here, isn't it?
MR. STRANDNESS:

2

No, it's not, Mr. Chief

3

Justice, because the situation here is we've got an

artificial record.

6

that the jury below saw.

This is a truncated record that the
It's not the same record

And what the court of appeals, in essence, is

8

doing is confusing two rules, rule 50 which involves

motions dealing with sufficiency of the evidence with rule

court and then -QUESTION:

12

13

Well then, how -- how you distinguish

the Martin Eby case?

14

MR. STRANDNESS:

How do I distinguish that?

QUESTION:

I thought there it said it's up

Yes.

16

to the court of appeals whether it wants to remand for a

17

new trial or enter judgment for the -- for the party that

18

prevailed in the court of appeals.

MR. STRANDNESS:

The -- the chief way I would

20

distinguish that case is simply by the fact that this --

21

that that case did not involve a truncated record.

It was denied.

That's correct.

And it says if the appellate court

reverses, which is what they did -- right?

MR. STRANDNESS:

That's correct.

Then nothing in this rule precludes

it from determining that the appellee is entitled to a new

Now, that seems to me it might or it

might not.

MR. STRANDNESS:

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And in your case they said no, in

when you did get around to asking one in your motion for a

25

MR. STRANDNESS:

Justice Breyer -- Justice

Breyer, it's -- it's obviously a situation in which in

10

looking at whether or not a petition for rehearing is a

11

suitable place to make an argument for a new trial, it

12

just simply doesn't serve that purpose.

13

inadequate way for a litigant to address this issue.

14

It's an

Now, to -- to really answer your question, I

15

need to back up a little bit and -- and walk through what

16

occurred here in this case.

17

evidence that had been submitted to the jury with the

18

expectation that the trial court's rulings were sound,

19

that they were sufficient and that the evidence that the

20

jury was going to be hearing would be reliable and would

21

be sufficient to support the verdict.

22

QUESTION:

We rested our case on the

May I stop you at that point?

Wasn't

23

there an objection by the defendant to that expert

24

testimony that could have tipped you off that they would

25

bring that up on appeal?

MR. STRANDNESS:

1

We were -- we were tipped off

2

that there were objections raised during the trial, but

3

the trial court -- the judge in our trial heard those

4

arguments and rejected them.

5

QUESTION:

Yes, but that's -- that was going to

6

be -- it seemed to me, sitting where you were at the

7

trial, you would know that if there was a jury verdict for

8

the plaintiff and the trial court entered judgment on that

9

verdict, that the defendant would appeal on the ground

10

that that expert testimony was inadmissible.
MR. STRANDNESS:

11

That's correct, but I think

12

what you're referring to, Justice Ginsburg, is perhaps a

13

conditional motion for a -- a new trial, and that

14

typically arises in a situation where the prevailing party

15

also has reasons to take issue with the trial court's

16

rulings.

17

took place during the trial that were against the

18

prevailing party's interest.

19

reservation of objection to that is -- is the normal

20

practice and that is what is done.

In other words, there were some rulings that

And a conditional

21

QUESTION:

Yes, but I think --

QUESTION:

I -- I wasn't suggesting that -- that

you are somehow foreclosed because you didn't make that

have asked.

2

think that that evidence was all proper, but just in case,

3

could you say in the alternative a new trial.

4

You could have said to the district judge, we

Or you could have argued -- when you argued your

5

appeal to the court of appeals when you knew what their

6

position would be, when you knew the defendant's position,

7

you could have said, court of appeals, we think that --

8

that expert testimony was properly admitted, but if we're

9

wrong about that, at least we should get a new trial and

10

not an instruction to enter judgment for the defendant.

11

You could have made that argument to the court of appeals.

12

MR. STRANDNESS:

We could have, but again it's a

13

question of as a litigant that has won at each step of the

14

procedure, if my client was listening to me asking for a

15

new trial when we're winning, they would -- he would have

16

questions about my sanity.

17

QUESTION:

Yes, that's -- that is the awkward

18

thing about rule -- rule 50, that it puts the judge --

19

also the judge into the position of saying, now, if I'm

20

wrong about that, what would I rule.

21

that you had.

22

MR. STRANDNESS:

But it is an option

And -- and that's why the rule

provides that if there is a judgment entered as a matter

of law, that the -- the non-movant or the person that lost

QUESTION:

2

Did the -- did the respondent in this

3

case in his brief to the Eighth Circuit ask that judgment

4

be entered for the -- for the respondent?
MR. STRANDNESS:

5
6

That's correct, Mr. Chief

Justice.

7

QUESTION:

So, you knew at that time at any rate

8

that the respondent's view was if he prevailed or it

9

prevailed on the expert testimony,

that they -- they

10

wanted judgment entered there and not remanded for a new

11

trial.

12

MR. STRANDNESS:

13

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And you also had an opportunity after

14

you had lost to come in with a rehearing motion saying,

15

no, don't enter judgment, either give us a new trial

16

because we represent we have other experts to substitute

17

for those who were found incompetent or remand to the

18

district court so that we can convince the district court

19

that we have new experts to substitute.

believed would be competent to testify to substitute for

MR. STRANDNESS:

And there's a reason for that,

6

and the reason is that the record that is before the

MR. STRANDNESS:

North Dakota is very unique.

We didn't have a realistic

them to make determinations as judgment as a matter of law
