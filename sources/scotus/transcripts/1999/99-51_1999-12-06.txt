ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH M. HUFSTEDLER

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HUFSTEDLER:

12

13

Mr. Chief Justice -- excuse me

-- and may it please the Court:

14

The issue before us this morning is whether Guam

15

has already elected its current Governor or whether there

16

must be a runoff election, and that depends, as you well

17

know, on whether a majority is determined by counting the

18

votes which have been cast in the gubernatorial race or

19

whether, according to the respondents in the Ninth

20

Circuit, we should could all of the ballots which were,

21

fact,

issued in the general election, along at the same

22

time,

and then determine whether or not there was a

23

majority.

24
25

in

The net result of going along with what the
Ninth Circuit has decided and what the respondents contend

is that there are three suspect categories of votes which

2

would be included in determining what constitutes a

3

majority that were not votes cast in the gubernatorial

4

race for one candidate.

5
6

The first was 1,313 ballots on which there was
no vote for the Governor at all.

7

The second was 609 ballots which were invalid

8

because the voter voted for both slates,

9

statutes of Guam, and it was impossible to determine their

10

11

contrary to the

choice.
And then there was a third category of 1,019

12

votes on which the voter checked the box saying that the

13

voter wanted to vote for a write-in candidate, but then

14

didn't write in a candidate.

15

which were,

16

the race for Governor.

17

- the record doesn't show -- but presumably people turned

18

in ballots on which they had voted in other races, but not

19

the gubernatorial race at all.

20

So, another 1,000 ballots

in effect -- in effect, blank ballots in -- in
But on those ballots presumably -

The net result of all of those votes was that

21

the Gutierrez slate received some 24,250 votes and the Ada

22

slate received 21,200.

QUESTION:

So, there was a --

Where can we find the statute in the

materials before us, Mr. Hufstedler?
MR. HUFSTEDLER:

1422?

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

3

MR. HUFSTEDLER:

That's in -- the statute is

4

quoted in the blue brief,

in the initial brief, on the

5

statutes involved,

argument.

and it's also quoted in the initial

QUESTION:

MR. HUFSTEDLER:

Thank you.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. HUFSTEDLER:

12

13

The statute is first shown on

Thank you.
And that's the one in the

opening brief and that governs it.
So, the net result is there was something like a

14

3,000 vote margin, which is really quite a comfortable

15

margin in many elections which are so close these days.

16

Here,

if the Ninth Circuit and the respondents

17

are correct, the result is going to change in determining

18

a -- it will change in this case, but can change in any

19

case depending upon how enthusiastic many people are about

20

coming in and voting for the school board members, grass

21

roots kind of campaigns which will bring in a lot of

22

people, or the legislature.

23

of people to vote in those two races, then the -- the

24

barrier becomes much higher as to how many votes somebody

25

has to get to be elected Governor.

And if that brings in a lot

1

nonsensical kind of proposition.
QUESTION:

2

And I take it you'd then have to have

3

a -- a second election under the Ninth Circuit's view even

4

though only two people were running in the first place and

5

it'd be among the same two people.
MR. HUFSTEDLER:

6

7

that's exactly what they said, Justice Kennedy.

8
9

Absolutely and specifically,

QUESTION:

Mr. Hufstedler, as a preliminary

matter, would you clarify for us the status of some case

10

pending now before the Guam Supreme Court that affects

11

this case?

12

MR. HUFSTEDLER:

Be happy to, Your Honor.

That

13

case was set, as I think the footnote indicates -- had

14

been set to be argued last week, or at least the last week

15

of November, and that was continued over to the next

16

session, which presumably will be in February in Guam,

17

awaiting apparently the decision of this Court.

18
19

QUESTION:

And what -- what are the issues

before the court there?

20

MR. HUFSTEDLER:

Two -- two basic sets of

21

issues.

22

court -- trial court in Guam decided, contrary to the

23

Ninth Circuit, that you looked at the votes cast in the

24

gubernatorial election.

25

The first issue is precisely this issue, and the

The second set of issues were a bunch of issues

related to claimed fraud in connection with the election.

2

And that took many days of trial, and with very extensive

3

opinion by the trial judge,

4

whatsoever of any kind of misconduct.

5
6

the trial judge found no proof

And those are the issues on appeal in the
Supreme Court in Guam.

7

Now,

there's nothing in this statute at all to

8

suggest that the determination of the -- of the majority

9

should depend upon what happens in some other elections.

10

You all recall well that this argument is based primarily

11

on an assertion by the Ninth Circuit and now by the

12

respondents that if the phrase,

13

means in any gubernatorial election, then it's -- it's

14

duplicitous.

15

twice.

16

interesting proposition is that sub silentio the

17

respondent in the Ninth Circuit concedes that if the

18

phrase,

19

statute means in any gubernatorial election.

20

surplus unless the statute already says that.

21

in any election, really

Surplus was the word.

Surplus and nullity.

They used the word

And therefore,

the

in any election, was not in that statute, the

Then the statute says,

It can't be

in any election.

And

22

they say, well,

23

The statute already means that and it can't mean that, and

24

so we have to throw all of this out, even though it said

25

it twice, and go find some different kind of election

that means any gubernatorial election.

that's going to determine this.

2

as you know, that it was the specific general election in

3

which the gubernatorial --of which the gubernatorial

4

election was a part.

5

QUESTION:

And they determined now,

It was that election.
But, Mr. Hufstedler, even if we

6

agreed that in any election means in any gubernatorial

7

election, why shouldn't the people who didn't vote for

8

Governor be counted the same way as someone who voted for

9

Donald Duck for Governor?

In other words, why shouldn't

10

they be counted as people who said neither of the above,

11

no one for Governor?

12

MR. HUFSTEDLER:

The first proposition I think,

13

Your Honor, is that there is no authority whatsoever for

14

the proposition that a non-vote is something that should

15

be counted in an election.

I find no authority anyplace.

16

There's none in any brief.

There's none in any opinion.

17

It's true that you can argue that --

QUESTION:

The terms is votes cast.

that -- that would be the critical term, whether --

20

MR. HUFSTEDLER:

21

QUESTION:

22

23

I guess

Precisely.

-- whether if you vote for nobody, as

opposed to voting for Donald Duck, you have cast a vote.
MR. HUFSTEDLER:

That's precisely correct,

24

Justice Scalia.

The term vote cast is used several times

25

in the statute.

There's never any mention of the word

QUESTION:

It would -- your case is stronger,

is

3

it not, by virtue of the use of the word votes rather than

4

ballots?

5

MR. HUFSTEDLER:

I think it clearly is.

I would

6

certainly insist so, Mr. Chief Justice.

And of course, as

7

I said, there's no place where they talk about ballots,

8

only about votes cast.
But with respect to the question that Justice

Ginsburg asked about voting for Donald Duck,

And what it adds is this.

The Ninth Circuit

10

argued that we were really looking only at a single

11

12

everything was included, and therefore that specific

13

election was the one.

14

this says in any is,

MR. HUFSTEDLER:

But I -The only point was that there

13

was a total of 46,666 ballots issued and whether people

14

voted on them or not, they were returned, and therefore we

15

ought to use that for a majority.

16

QUESTION:

I suppose under the respondents'

17

theory -- well,

18

me that it -- it could be that 1,000 people were very

19

interested in the school board, and a different 1,000 were

20

very interested in the water bonds.

13

MR. HUFSTEDLER:

No.

The only thing I guess I

14

have to bear on that is there is a statute in Guam, which

15

is in the materials, which points out that if -- if a

-- and I'm now at page -- whatever -- 436 of the U.S.

2

Reports -- the function of the election process is to

3

winnow out and finally reject all but the chosen

4

candidates.

5

That's what the other cases say.

6

select a candidate for the officeholder in a particular

race.

short-range political goals, pique, or personal quarrels.

Now,

that's what the Foster case says.
We're really trying to

In other words,

if a vote for Donald Duck is

10

intended to say, gee,

11

on here,

12

a vote cast and that's not what the election is about.

13

The election is about electing a candidate, and a vote for

14

Donald Duck doesn't do that and it doesn't constitute

15

effectively a vote cast.

16

I don't like anything that's going

the voter can go out and say that, but that's not

So,

it seems to me that we really must come

17

back, as Justice Scalia indicated a moment ago, to deal

18

with the phrase what is a vote cast.

19

And I would like to -- to deal specifically with

20

the response that -- that the respondents have come up

21

with about that because you remember they said, which to

22

me is quite an amazing thing, without any kind of an

23

authority, and that is ballots and votes are fungible.

24

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HUFSTEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I would like to reply, as long as my time holds out, to

4

four or five specific points that were made.

5

First of all, in the discussion about the

6

eligible voters,

7

comments cleared that up.

I think the colloquy and Justice Scalia's

But it does seem to me it's important to go back
and -- and deal with really the -- the grandfather case

10

that deals with this basic problem, and that's County of

11

Cass against Johnston.

12

which has been uniformly followed and that is for

13

qualified voters who absent themselves from an election

duly called, they are presumed to have gone along with the

15

majority who did,

QUESTION:

Of course, that involved no Federal

17

statute at all, did it?

18

relevant is if you -- if you assume -- perhaps not a

19

terribly likely assumption -- that Congress was familiar

20

with it, though, when --

different language, we've talked about that at some

length, and as I say, I think we get some help out of it.

But the important point that hasn't been
