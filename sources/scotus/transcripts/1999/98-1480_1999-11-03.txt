ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY STARKMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STARKMAN:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case, like many cases previously before

11
12

this Court, begins and ends with the language that

13

Congress chose to use in RICO.

14

provide a civil remedy only for predicate acts as defined

15

in section 1961.

16

1964 (c) to provide civil remedies only for violations of

17

1962(a),

18

violations of 1962 (c) .

19

Section 1964(c) does not

Congress also did not draft section

(b), and (c), or, for that matter, only for

Congress drafted section 1964 (c) in plain and

20

unambiguous terms to provide a civil remedy for all four

21

of the subsections of section 1962, and that includes

22

1962(d), conspiracies to violate RICO.

23

The petitioner here, Robert Beck, was injured by

24

reason of a violation of section 1962(d), a conspiracy to

25

violate RICO, and under the plain and unambiguous terms of
3

1

that statute, that is all that is required to provide him

2

with a civil remedy.
QUESTION:

4

formation of the agreement, and that was the conspiracy.
MR. STARKMAN:

Well, he wasn't injured by the

MR. STARKMAN:

Yes, that's correct, he's not

And that's all the conspiracy was.

The conspiracy itself, though,
One of the objects -- well, the

10

objects are obviously to violate the substantive sections

11

of that statute, but overall the conspiracy was, let's

12

shake down contractors, let's commit fraud, and let's hide

13

it all, get money, invest it in the enterprise.
As that conspiracy develops, though, as with all

14
15

conspiracies, the object has to expand, and it has to

include getting rid of Beck, who stood in the way of that

21

I mean, one contractor who's shaken down, he

22

could sue through RICO, but which is more vital to the

23

continuance of the conspiracy, that person, or Beck, a

24

person who could have brought the entire conspiracy down.

25

QUESTION:

Well, let's say that we rule against
4

1

you on this point.

2

sometimes in concert with others, in joint participation.

3

The standard law of torts would give recovery for that in

4

most instances, so you wouldn't really need the conspiracy

5

section for vicarious liability, or for joint liability.

6

Predicate acts still are committed

MR. STARKMAN:

But here, the way that the

7

statute was drafted, Justice Kennedy, the statute itself

8

created four separate causes of action, and this Court in

9

Salinas defined the words, to conspire, which only appear

10
11
12
13

in the statute once, as being this criminal animal.
QUESTION:

Well, that was a criminal case, was

it not, Salinas?
MR. STARKMAN:

Yes, sir, but just because those

14

words are defined in a criminal context, they shouldn't

15

have a different meaning in another section when that

16

other section refers to them.

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Well, you say it creates four

separate causes of action, but that's the issue, does it?
MR. STARKMAN:

It is the -- well, it's the way

20

the statute's written, though.

21

statute provides a forbidden activities, or prohibited

22

activities in (a),

Well, all of those were criminal

The question here is whether they were all causes

8

10
11

The question here --

I mean, you're just stating the

MR. STARKMAN:

The question here, Justice

Kennedy, is whether or not 1964(c) provides a civil remedy
for each of those causes of action.
QUESTION:

Well, they could provide a remedy for

12

(d) without necessarily providing a remedy that gives you

13

recovery here.

14

You use the word conspiracy as what is outlawed

15

by 1962(d).

The noun conspiracy really can have two

16

different meanings.

17

conspiring, or it could refer to the confederation formed

18

by the act of conspiring, you see.

19

part of the conspiracy, the group of -- 1962(d) does not

20

use the noun conspiracy.

21

has only one meaning.

22

to conspire to violate, so the act of violating (d) is the

23

act of conspiring.

It can refer to the act of

You know, saying he's

It uses the verb, which really

24

MR. STARKMAN:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Now, how
6

has your client been harmed

1

by the act of conspiring, directly harmed by the act of

2

conspiring?

3
4

MR. STARKMAN:

injury committed by reason of this section.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. STARKMAN:

7

By reason of a violation of 62.
Yes, and that violation, the

Section 1964(c) requires an

You're using the noun again.

Stick

How did the conspiring, the formation of

10

that agreement harm your client?

11

MR. STARKMAN:

There had to be overt acts that

12

are performed as a result of that these people conspire in

13

order to trigger 1964(c)'s injury requirement.

14

QUESTION:

That may well be, and he may have

15

been injured by the overt act, but I don't see how he was

16

injured by the violation of (d), which is the conspiring.

17

MR. STARKMAN:

In order to have this conspiring

18

of people, they have to have an object, which is the three

19

subsections of -- the three prior subsections of 1962.

20

That object expands.

24

of Beck, and once they do that --

25

The conspiring has as one of its

It is one of the agreements that they

They put that agreement into action by getting rid

QUESTION:

Well, that's further down the line,
7

1

though.

I mean, we're talking about directly injured, and

2

you could say, sure, you know, the act of conspiring had

3

as its object this, and in pursuing that object they

4

injured your client, but that's further down the line.
MR. STARKMAN:

5

No, it's directly down the line,

6

Justice Scalia, from the decision that's made in the

7

conspiracy that we have to continue with this conspiracy,

8

and to do that we have to get rid of this person.
In order to get rid of him, they have to

9
10

terminate him, and wrongfully.

Once they do that, he is

11

injured by the act of conspiring, by the agreement that

12

they have made to continue this pattern of criminal acts,

13

the pattern of racketeering, to do all of the things that

14

they were doing.

15

conspiracy.

This injury is directly related to the

This is not some incidental bystander.

For example, I think in the Seventh Circuit they

16
17

use the example of somebody driving to rob a bank and

18

hitting one of the -QUESTION:

19
20

But it wasn't one of the predicate

acts.

21

MR. STARKMAN:

22

QUESTION:

No.

I mean, your argument for direct

23

results of the conspiracy would be much stronger if,

24

indeed, it was one of the predicate acts.

25

MR. STARKMAN:

Yes, it would, Justice Scalia,
8

1

but there's no basis to make a distinction between overt

2

acts committed in furtherance of the conspiracy and

3

predicate acts committed in furtherance of the conspiracy

4

when we're under 1962(d).

5

QUESTION:

If we're under (d), right?

6

MR. STARKMAN:

If we're under (d), and here

7

that's all that we're under.

Here, we are arguing whether

8

or not the 1962(d) violation proximately caused injury to

9

this individual, and under any of the definitions of

10

proximate cause, whether it be direct, as was articulated

11

in Holmes, or foreseeable consequences, intended

12

consequences, lack of intervening causes, all of those

13

tests are satisfied when the injury is directly related to

14

the core, if you will, of this conspiracy.

15

QUESTION:

What do you say about, is the -- the

16

language of 1964(c) is very similar to the private treble

17

damage antitrust suit.

18

MR. STARKMAN:

19

QUESTION:

20

And can a whistleblower bring an

antitrust suit against a group of price fixers?

21

MR. STARKMAN:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

Yes, sir.

Probably not.

Not, all right, so how -- what's the

distinction?
MR. STARKMAN:

The distinction is an antitrust.

The rationale used by all of the lower courts that fits is
9

1

that there is a requirement of antitrust injury in an

2

antitrust action.

3

to make sure that the violation is being caused by that

4

which the antitrust laws --

Antitrust injury requires an analysis

QUESTION:

5

So I thought perhaps this -- your

6

opponents are basically saying -- it's the same concept

7

that's here.

8

same idea.

9

substantive violations, giving people treble damages for

10
11

It's not literally the same, but it's the
It's really -- this statute's aimed at

those, not for these other things.
MR. STARKMAN:

That is what my opponents are

12

saying in this case.

However, that policy rationale that

13

underlies the reasons for not allowing antitrust

14

whistleblowers to sue doesn't apply in RICO.

15

countervailing policy to --

There is no

16

QUESTION:

17

your plain meaning.

18

an antitrust concept, context, if there is the core

19

antitrust injury explanation, then why can't there also be

20

here a RICO-related interpretation?

21

But Mr. Starkman, it does undercut
If it doesn't have a plain meaning in

In other words, if we reject your plain meaning,

22

isn't it appropriate for the Court to take into account

23

the presumption that Congress does not mean to sweep too

24

deeply into what is traditionally a domain of State law?

25

MR. STARKMAN:

There are three answers to that,
10

1

Justice Ginsburg.

First, it was not Congress' desire to

2

only eliminate predicate acts.

3

illegal.

4

existing State remedies, and attacking organized crime.

5

There was a need, Congress felt, to go beyond

Those were already

Congress was going further, to supplement

6

what was already existing, so it only federalized the RICO

7

enterprise itself, and it used language that was broad but

8

not ambiguous.

9

QUESTION:

I find it ironic that you're

10

appealing to what Congress intended, and you tell us it

11

intended to reach organized crime, which indeed I think it

12

did, which -- you know, I view that as people in pin­

13

striped suits carrying machine guns, and here you're going

14

after people in doctor's robes carrying scalpels.

15

why should I interpret RICO any more broadly than I

16

absolutely must, given the fact that it has misfired so

17

much from what it was aimed at?

18

MR. STARKMAN:

I --

We only need to go so far as what

19

the language itself says.

This Court has repeatedly

20

refused to write in requirements that don't exist in the

21

statute in order to satisfy this concern that this statute

22

is misfiring.

23

For example, in National Organization of Women

24

v. Scheidler, this Court refused to write in an economic

25

motive requirement because the statute -- and the lower
11

1

court did, because it was concerned for this very reason,

2

that the statute was going too far.

3

But the language of RICO didn't require that,

4

and in Sedima this Court refused to put into RICO the

5

requirement that we're talking about here, which is the

6

racketeering injury.

7

QUESTION:

I don't think it reads in anything to

8

say that you have not been hurt by the conspiring.

9

think it reads in something to say, well, you may not have

10

been hurt by the conspiring, but the conspiring had as its

11

purpose something else, and you have been hurt by the

12

furtherance of that purpose.

13

it must be read, it seems to me you haven't been hurt by

14

the conspiring.

15

MR. STARKMAN:

I

If I read it as narrowly as

But the conspiring is not just

16

the conspiring to commit the predicate acts that happens

17

when they first sit down, Justice Scalia.

18

has to continue throughout the life of this conspiracy,

19

and this person that is injured is injured directly by the

20

conspiring.

21

to make one its goals, we need to get rid of this guy,

22

because if we don't, this conspiring is not going to be

23

able to continue.

24
25

The conspiring

He is injured because the conspiring has had

QUESTION:

Well, I think you're right, I think

the strongest argument -- incidentally, I don't think it's
12

1

your opponent who makes the argument about the conspiring.

2

It's one of the amicus, as I recall.

3
4
5

MR. STARKMAN:

Yes, sir, Washington Law

Foundation.
QUESTION:

And the weakest point of that

6

argument, it seems to me, which the amicus is willing to

7

accept, is that if that argument is right, you would not

8

only -- your client would not only be not able to recover
for a -- an act that is in furtherance of the conspiracy

10

but not one of the predicate acts --

11

MR. STARKMAN:

12

QUESTION:

13

-- your client wouldn't even be able

to recover for a predicate act.

14

MR. STARKMAN:

15

QUESTION:

16

Uh-huh.

Yes.

And you say that deprives (d) of all

of its meaning.

17

MR. STARKMAN:

18

QUESTION:

Which it does.

But why does it deprive (d) of all of

1

its meaning?

I mean, it seems to me conspiracy law has

20

two effects.

Number 1, it makes the act of conspiring

21

unlawful, so that you can prosecute even before there's

22

been any crime.

23

That's one effect.

24
25

The act of conspiring becomes a crime.

The second effect is that all of the people who
are in the conspiracy can be held liable for the effects
13

1

of the conspiracy.

2

Now, why doesn't it give (d) enough of an effect

3

to say that it continues to have in the civil context that

4

second consequence?
MR. STARKMAN:

5

Because, Justice Scalia, in order

6

to do that, we have to take the words, to conspire, and

7

give them two completely different meanings in two

8

different sections.

9

as being the first of the two situations that Your Honor

Those words, to conspire, are defined

10

described, the act of conspiring, this conspiracy animal,

11

and what 1964(c) does is gives a civil remedy for that

12

conspiracy that is pernicious and overrides the --

13

QUESTION:

But I'm not giving them two different

14

meanings.

I'm perfectly willing to say that it means the

15

same thing.

16

(d) has no effect, and I think you're right that one of

17

the consequences of conspiracy law would have very little

18

effect under (d).

19

conspiring would harm anybody.

I am just responding to your argument that

It would be very rare that the mere
I concede that.

20

However, the other effect of (d) would still be

21

considerable, namely, where there is an injury under (a),

22

(b), and (c), it's not only the person who actually

23

committed that injury who is held liable under RICO, but

24

all of the co-conspirators.

25

an adequate scope of operation for (d).

That seems to me to be quite

14

MR. STARKMAN:

1

It is a procedural device, then.

2

We are relegating 1962(d), rather than providing a civil

3

remedy that expands plaintiffs' abilities to bring suits,

4

we are changing it to be a procedural device that

5

identifies defendants that can be named, and that is not

6

what 1964(c) provides.

7

1964(c) by its title provides civil remedies,

8

and identifies any person who is able to sue under its

9

provisions, and here any -QUESTION:

10
11

Although that is the usual

consequence of conspiracy law in the civil context.

12

MR. STARKMAN:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

It renders more people liable.

14

doesn't render acts unlawful that are otherwise not

15

unlawful.

16

MR. STARKMAN:

It

Yes, Justice Scalia, but here,

17

1962(d) is identified as one of the prohibited conduct,

18

areas of conduct, and in Salinas this Court defined what

19

that was, and all 1964(c) says, its plain language is that

20

we are going to recognize a civil remedy, a civil action

21

for that criminal violation.

22

this statute.

23

That's the plain meaning of

That is what it says.

And in Holmes this Court restricted the reach of

24

1962(d), as well as all of RICO, by placing in the time-

25

tested solution for this problem of endless ripples of
15

1

civil liability, proximate cause.

2

make a distinction between predicate acts committed in

3

furtherance of a conspiracy and overt acts committed in

4

furtherance of a conspiracy.

5

QUESTION:

There is no need to

May I ask in that connection, how

6

significant to your case is it that there may be a

7

whistleblower involved?

8

whether he's a whistleblower or not?

On your theory, does it matter

I think it does, Justice Stevens,

but it's not crucial.

12

QUESTION:

The crucial point is that he is a

Is that because he's a whistleblower,

13

or independent of his possibility of doing any

14

whistleblowing?

15

MR. STARKMAN:

It's independent, because for

16

example, if they were just retaliating, and this

17

whistleblower -- for blowing the whistle, first it's not

18

in furtherance of the conspiracy, but it's also not

19

proximately caused by the conspiracy, so it's not the

20

fundamental issue of whistleblowing.

25

QUESTION:

It is that this

What under the allegations of the

complaint, what was the nature of his threat?
MR. STARKMAN:

That he could cause the

conspiracy to cease to exist.
16

He stood in the way of

predicate acts being committed.

2

the continuation of the conspiracy.
QUESTION:

3

He stood in the way of

Would you translate that to facts

4

instead of sort of a general -- what did he do that

MR. STARKMAN:

report this to the regulators.

He had not finished reporting everything,

QUESTION:

And your notion is that by firing him

13

they would prevent him from reporting facts to the

14

regulators?

15

MR. STARKMAN:

No.

No, Justice Stevens.

My

16

notion is that what happened here, one of the key facts is

17

that they wanted to start looting this company.

18

wanted to start taking money out, and Mr. Beck stood in

19

the way of that.

20

They

He said no, you can't do that, and I'm not going

21

to let you, and what they did thereafter was get rid of

22

him, and then right after they got rid of him, within

23

months, they commit these very predicate acts that he was

24

preventing before, this theft of money from the lower --

25

from the subsidiaries, this -- and they were then able to
17

1

continue the things that he was starting -QUESTION:

2

Would you say, in an analogy, as

3

Justice Breyer suggested to the antitrust cases, is this

4

like firing a salesman who refuses to go to price-fixing

5

meetings?
MR. STARKMAN:

6

No, it's not, because there you

7

again have -- well, it is on some levels, but the analogy

8

isn't apropos because you have the antitrust injury

9

requirement, which this Court has rejected in the RICO

10

context.

11

to the meetings doesn't have standing under the

12

antitrust --

13

The reason that that salesperson who doesn't go

Well, you say that we've rejected the

antitrust injury concept in RICO.

15

rejected it?

MR. STARKMAN:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. STARKMAN:

Have we expressly

Yes, sir.

In Sedima?
In Holmes.

In Holmes?
It was actually stated in a

21

footnote that -- and this is almost a literal quote -- the

22

antitrust injury requirement has no analogue to the -- to

23

RICO, and it was for this very reason that there is no

24

underlying, or there's no countervailing policy to promote

25

racketeering that would work in the RICO setting.
18

QUESTION:

1

So it's any injury that is a

2

consequence of an act that's necessary for the completion

3

of the conspiracy.
MR. STARKMAN:

cause.

Mr. Starkman, don't you see any

inconsistency between your insistence upon absolute

proximity of causation with respect to the issue we've

just been talking about, who can sue because of a

nonpredicate act, and your willingness to allow quite

extensive causation, not at all proximate, on the very

basic issue of whether (d) makes unlawful the consequences

10

of a conspiracy, or just the conspiring?

11

MR. STARKMAN:

No.

I mean, on that issue, you know, when

I put it to you that all it makes unlawful is the

Mr. Starkman, I'm sorry, but I would

like to ask you a question.

5

Justice Scalia the last time, let me put it this way.

6

object of a proximate cause concept is, as you put it, to

prevent the ripple effect of causation from going on

8

infinitely, but it seems to me that what you are doing in

your argument is avoiding the proximate cause requirement

10

Going back to your answer to

simply by expanding the concept of the conspiracy.
We apply proximate cause between the appropriate

act and the effect.

You're saying, we're going to broaden

13

the class of appropriate acts, and we're going to end up

14

with the same kind, it seems to me, the same breadth of

15

scope for subsection (d) that we would have if we didn't

have the proximate cause requirement.

Beck.

12

QUESTION:

You're saying, in effect, you -- when

13

you conspire to rob a bank, you conspire to get by the

14

guard, and you're saying, that's pretty darned close to

15

the core of it.

That's the nub of your argument.

16

MR. STARKMAN:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. STARKMAN:

Yes.

Yes.
That guard -- there's a question

19

about whether the guard's incidental, but if the

20

conspiracy was, we've got to get past that guard also,

21

because he's stopped all of these things, and we're going

22

to take care of him one way or another, then that would be

actionable.

24

QUESTION:

Suppose, as a matter of fact, Beck

was not all that essential.

It would be nice to get rid

of him, but we can carry on this conspiracy even if he

stays there, after all, look at all the years he was there

and didn't even know what was going on, how harmful could

he be.
MR. STARKMAN:

could have just intercepted his mail to prevent it from

going to the regulators.

The test is, though, whether or

not it was necessary to effect its object.

QUESTION:

Mr. Rosenbaum, we'll hear from you.

13

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL M. ROSENBAUM

14

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. ROSENBAUM:

15
16
17

Mr. Chief Justice, if it please

the Court:
In response to a question posed to Mr. Starkman

18

as to why there should not be RICO-type injury, just as

19

there is in antitrust law, antitrust-type injury, he

20

referred to the Holmes decision and suggested that the --

21

the Holmes decision, at least in a footnote, stands for

22

the proposition that RICO injury is not necessary.

23

What Mr. Starkman is referring to is -- excuse

24

me -- footnote 15 in the Holmes case, which he misreads in

25

its entirety.

Footnote 15 to the Holmes case simply says,
28

1

based upon Sedima, that we don't require -- the Court in

2

that case said, we don't require the amorphous concept of

3

racketeering-type injury, because that was the holding in

4

Sedima.

5

The holding in Sedima also was, however,

6

pursuant to a 1962(c) substantive claim, that there must

7

be, not racketeering injury, because the term is too

8

amorphous.

9

There must be predicate act injury.
So when you read the footnote that Mr. Starkman

10

is referring to in the context of the questions posed to

11

him as to why there shouldn't have to be RICO-type injury,

12

what comes from it, what flows from it is the necessity,

13

at the very least, that there be predicate act injury.

14

QUESTION:

Sedima did say, though, that Congress

15

did not want to have the standing problems that antitrust

16

cases had.

17

Sedima did say that, did it not?
MR. ROSENBAUM:

In a way, Your Honor, but Sedima

18

ultimately stands for the proposition that there must be

19

predicate act-type injury as opposed to the more amorphous

20

concept of racketeering injury.
Correct.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. ROSENBAUM:

23
24
25

Holmes, which flows from Sedima,

comes to a similar conclusion, comes to a -QUESTION:

His better argument I think was that

the essential nature of RICO is to talk about an
29

1

enterprise, and the harm involved is a certain kind of a

2

company.
The harm involved in the antitrust area is a

3
4

certain thing that happens in the world, and firing and

5

hiring people is part of the operations of the company.

6

Firing and hiring people is not part of the operations of

7

the price fix insofar as it affects the world, and

8

therefore there's no good analogy for purposes of his

9

argument.

I think that was basically his point.
MR. ROSENBAUM:

10

I think the analysis, the

11

analogue to antitrust, applies even in the situation that

12

you described, Your Honor.
Congress delineated no fewer than 50 predicate

13
14

acts.

15

written word was to deter the commission of the predicate

16

acts.

17

The obvious intent of Congress by virtue of the

Justice Scalia asked Mr. Starkman about the

18

difference between the verb, to conspire, as opposed to

19

the noun, the existence of the conspiracy.

20

1962(d) in context, it simply says, it's unlawful to

21

conspire to violate, in this instance 1962(c), by

22

conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern

23

of racketeering conduct.

24
25

When you read

Reading the two together, and I'll get to
1964(c) in a moment, I think it's clear that the purpose
30

1

of the unlawful conspiracy must be to conduct the

2

predicate acts in violation of 1962(c) that shaped, the

3

civil remedy that flows from the conspiracy to violate is

4

shaped by the language in 1964(c).

5

anyone injured by reason of, in this instance a violation

6

of 1962(d), has civil RICO standing.

That language says,

7

The words, by reason of, cry out for shaping,

8

which is what the Court said in the analogous antitrust

9

case of AGC, Associated General Contractors, which the

10

Court also picked up on, obviously, in Holmes.

11

words cry out for shaping, and the Court shaped those

12

words in the antitrust context in Associated General

13

Contractors.

14

the context of RICO by limiting standing to those

15

proximately injured by the unlawful conduct.

The Court thereafter shaped those words in

16

What the Court said in Holmes --

17

QUESTION:

18

But that was under a (c), that was

under a (c) claim, right --

19

MR. ROSENBAUM:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. ROSENBAUM:

22

QUESTION:

23

That's correct.

-- not under a (d) claim.
That's correct, but the --

I mean, you had to do it under (c).

I mean --

24
25

Those

MR. ROSENBAUM:
under (d),

I think you also have to do it

because 1964 (c) is equally as applicable to
31

1

(d) as it is to (c).

Therefore, when the Court decided

2

Holmes, it was really deciding the extent, the limitations

3

of the by-reason-of language in 1964(c), whether it's an

4

(a), a (b), a (c), or a (d) violation.

5

QUESTION:

But his argument is that it makes no

6

sense, as a practical matter, and hence should make no

7

sense in construing the statute, to think of the -- to

8

conceptualize the conspiracy to commit the predicate acts

9

without including a conspiracy to do at least what is in

10

some close sense necessary to effect those acts.

11

I gave him -- it wasn't his analogy, but I said,

12

you know, you rob the bank, you include in your conspiracy

13

the knocking off the guard to get out, and he's saying

14

that to construe a conspiracy as narrowly as you would

15

have us do is simply unrealistic in the way people

16

conspire to effect an object, and the statute should

17

reflect that common sense.

18

What's your answer to that?

19

MR. ROSENBAUM:

My answer to that, Your Honor,

20

is that on this record -- on this record, and I think my

21

adversary essentially conceded away his argument when

22

stating that if it is a conspiracy which is interfered

23

with as a result of the termination, you should have

24

standing, but if it's in retaliation for already having

25

blown the whistle -- he made that response to one of the
32

1

questions -- then obviously the retaliation is not in

2

furtherance of the conspiracy.
On this record, that's precisely what occurred

3
4

here based upon the pleadings that the plaintiff, that the

5

petitioner filed in the lower courts --

6

QUESTION:

Okay, but that's --

7

QUESTION:

That's your only response to that

QUESTION:

That in effect is saying, even if

8

argument?

9
10

he's right, I will still win, and my question is, why

11

isn't he right in his claim that to conspire under (d)

12

must be read as broadly as he says?
MR. ROSENBAUM:

13

Because, aside from the factual

14

basis on which this case came to this Court, the injury

15

sustained by the whistleblower, even if it was allegedly

16

in furtherance of the conspiracy, are tangential to, are

17

tangential to the principle goal of the conspiracy, which

18

was to commit the predicate acts -QUESTION:

19

Yes, but you're -- that -- it

20

seems -- maybe I misunderstand you, but it seems to me

21

that you're in effect just denying the predicate of his

22

argument.

23

what is necessary to effect the conspiracy.

24

tangential to it.

25

You're saying, well, this would not fall within
This is too

What about his argument that, in fact, the
33

1

conspiracy has got to include something more than simply

2

the agreement to commit a predicate act, and the more has

3

got to be, whatever is in some close sense, narrow sense

4

necessary to effectively, to commit the predicate acts.

5

What's your answer to that?
MR. ROSENBAUM:

6

My answer to that lies in the

7

Holmes analysis.

While there may be injuries that flow

8

from the conspiracy, and perhaps cause -QUESTION:

9

Yes, but that's a proximate cause

10

analysis, and you apply proximate cause analysis once

11

you -- once you have identified the acts which are

12

wrongful.

13

He is saying, we are now at the stage when we're

14

trying to identify the acts that are wrongful, we'll get

15

to proximate cause later, and he's saying, wrongful acts

16

must include those acts which in a narrow sense are

17

necessary to commit the predicates.

18

MR. ROSENBAUM:

Every wrongful act under this

19

statute does not necessarily result in standing.

20

concede for the purposes of argument that the termination

21

was unlawful and was in furtherance of the conspiracy,

22

that does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that a

23

whistleblower has RICO standing.

24
25

QUESTION:

If I

Does it -- does your argument assume

that there may be -- I think your argument, however, as
34

1

you're making it now, assumes that there may be some

2

nonpredicate acts which are within the concept of the

3

conspiracy and, hence, actionable.
You're saying not everything is.

4

He would agree

5

with you.

6

to be within the concept of the conspiracy are those

7

without which you can't effect your conspiracy.

8

How about some, and the some that he proposes

MR. ROSENBAUM:

I tried to think of examples,

prior to coming here today, of where some nonpredicate
10

acts could be the basis of RICO standing, and I, at least

11

within my own thinking, have been unable to come up with

12

any, based upon the underlying theme in my argument that

13

any act not a predicate act, even an act which may be

14

necessary for --

15

QUESTION:

Well, take a simple -- no, you go.

16

QUESTION:

I think I know what your problem is,

17

Mr. Rosenbaum.

18

these nonpredicate acts have nothing to do with the goal

1

of the conspiracy, which is to commit the predicate acts.

20

That's simply not true.

21

It's the statement you made earlier that

The goal of the conspiracy is not necessarily to

22

commit the predicate acts.

Most of the predicate acts are

23

simply means along the end to the goal.

24

along the end to that goal, killing the bank guard, happen

25

to be unlawful acts covered by RICO, and therefore they
35

Some of the means

1

become predicate acts, not because they are the goal of

2

the conspiracy -- they didn't intend to kill -- the object

3

wasn't to kill the guard.

bank.

5

It was to get the money in the

So whether something is a predicate act or not a

6

predicate act has nothing to do, whether it is central to

7

the object of the conspiracy.

8

central, in fact more central, more essential to the

9

furtherance of the conspiracy than a predicate act is and

10
11

Something can be just as

not be a predicate act.
MR. ROSENBAUM:

That may be so, Justice Scalia,

12

but the answer to the question that I think is being posed

13

to me is whether or not that goal, albeit essential to the

14

completion of the conspiracy, still provides a basis for

15

RICO standing.

16

You can draw inferences from the antitrust

17

analogue that while there is an injury that is essential

18

to the outcome of the conspiracy to violate in this

19

instance, or in the antitrust instances antitrust law,

20

that injury, so says this Court in several cases, is not

21

necessarily compensable under the statutory scheme that

22

the Court is being asked to consider.

23

in Associated General Contractors, where the very goal of

24

the conspiracy was to injure the labor union.

25

That was the result

This Court said that we don't look at the

1

necessary intent of the respondents in that case, the

2

defendants in that case, to injure the plaintiff.

3

be injured, and he may have other remedies, but at least

4

within the statutory scheme of antitrust law, which this

5

Court essentially looked at in the Holmes case, he doesn't

6

suffer the necessary type of injury, even in the existence

7

of a conspiracy to make it actionable under the Federal

8

statute.

distinguish, firstly, the difference between civil

conspiracy, which is just the existence of the agreement

2

which in and of itself is unlawful, whether or not it

3

injures anyone, and a civil conspiracy which requires more

4

than just the existence of a conspiracy, because nobody's

5

injured just by virtue of the existence of the conspiracy.

6

The law of civil conspiracy is that the act that

7

becomes actionable must be a tortious act, and in cases

8

from this Court going back to the late 1800's in the case

9

of Adler, in the case of Nalle, this Court said that the

10

act that gives standing must be the act that -- for which

11

the conspiracy was formed.

12

In an interesting opinion from the D.C. Circuit,

13

Justice Scalia, that -- the Halberstam opinion, there was

14

some interesting language.

MR. ROSENBAUM:

24

In any event, what the Court held in that case,

I thought you might remember it.

similar to what -- to the language in the late 1800 cases,
38

1

in Adler and Nalle, was that: one, the purpose of the

2

conspiracy, to give standing to a civil plaintiff, that

3

civil plaintiff must be injured essentially by the purpose

4

of the conspiracy, and the Court said in that opinion that

5

the conspiracy laws are essentially on the books, be it

6

common law or statutory, for the purpose of creating

7

vicarious liability.

8
9

Essentially, the statute, the common law said
the Court there was for the purpose of assuring that all

10

of those within the umbrella of the wrong, the wrong being

11

the intent to commit the particular tortious act there,

12

the burglary, ergo the murder, are held accountable.

13

Not everybody in the conspiracy is held

14

accountable for every single act done in furtherance of

15

the conspiracy.

expect based upon the particular type of conspiracy.

9

That is my point.

I mean,

it may well be that we would still reverse the judgment

10

below on the basis that Mr. Starkman claims, and you would

11

go back to the court to argue whether in fact there was

12

sufficient -- sufficiently tortious character in what was

13

done here.
You might -- he might win this battle, you might

14
15

lose the war, but I don't think if we accept your view

16

that necessarily disposes of the case at this point.
QUESTION:

18

Is there -- was -- did you answer that?

19

to
No, I haven't.

I don't want

20

MR. ROSENBAUM:

I haven't.

21

The Court a moment ago asked me for a conceptual

22

answer to that question.

With the Court's permission, I'd

23

like to answer the question based upon what happened in

24

the Eleventh Circuit, and what happened prior to that

25

based upon this record.

I am dealing, obviously, on
40

1

behalf of my client with respect to this record.

2

There is no issue of Beck being a stop-gap, him

3

being necessary, his elimination being necessary to allow

4

the conspiracy to go forward.

5

Eleventh Circuit held that this was a retaliatory

6

discharge.

On this record, the

That wasn't its legal conclusion.

7

The way the case was pleaded, if you look at the

8

joint appendix, page 69, paragraphs 49 through roughly 51,

9

that was the allegation of conspiracy.

In that allegation

10

of conspiracy, the plaintiff contended, Mr. Beck contended

11

that after he notified the Florida Department of Insurance

12

of alleged wrongdoing, he was discharged.
That theme was the theme on the summary judgment

13
14

motion, Your Honor.

15

Eleventh Circuit opinion from which the writ of certiorari

16

was granted, and the Eleventh Circuit said that there was

17

a partial, using the Eleventh Circuit's language, there

18

was a partial disclosure, the cat already being out of the

19

bag.

20

That theme was also the theme in the

Ergo, under the facts as pleaded and as argued

21

in the summary judgment motion, there could not be an act

22

in furtherance, even if there was an unlawful conspiracy,

23

and assuming that the purpose of the conspiracy was to

24

continue undetected, because the detection had already

25

occurred by virtue of Mr. Beck's conduct.
41

1

He alerted the very agency that had sole

2

jurisdiction over this company to investigate, and did

3

investigate the company, and to determine whether or not

4

there was any improper acts occurring.

5

So on this record -- on this record, as

6

Mr. Starkman said, if, in fact, the whistleblowing had

7

occurred before the termination, which it did, then the

8

act of termination couldn't be in furtherance of the

9

alleged conspiracy.

10

There's another reason, however, why

11

whistleblowing of this sort cannot be and should not be

12

the basis of RICO standing.

13

of 196 -- sorry, 1961(1), several of the predicate acts

14

include obstruction of justice.

15

predicate acts is a violation of 18 U.S.C. section 1513,

16

which is a retaliatory aspect of the obstruction of

17

justice statute.

18

In listing the predicate acts

Listed as one of the

Congress limited conduct to be obstruction of

19

justice, limited it to physical harm to one's person, or

20

harm to tangible personal property.

21

precursor of the statute included within it harm to a

22

person's business, or harm to property nontangible in

23

nature, wrongful discharge.

24
25

A precursor, a draft

That was eliminated from the final draft, which
to me reflects the fact that Congress at least had in mind
42

1

potential claims by whistleblowers who were making

2

obstruction of justice a predicate act, and determined

3

that there were too many difficulties -- too many

4

difficulties in seeking to enforce that because of the

5

multitude of motives that may exist when terminating

6

somebody.
Was someone terminated because he really was a

7
8

threat to criminal proceeding, or the prosecution of a

9

criminal proceeding, or the detection of a criminal

10

proceeding, or was he terminated because of legitimate

11

business reasons.
QUESTION:

12

We really didn't take this case to

13

determine whether, you know, whether Beck was terminated

14

because what he -- of what he had already done, or what he

15

would do.

16

the point you're now arguing is precluded by the question

17

presented.

18

That's not why the case is up here, and I think

I mean, the question presented is whether an

19

employee who is terminated for both blowing the whistle on

20

and refusing to participate in a pattern of predicate acts

21

may assert a civil RICO conspiracy claim where he has been

22

injured by an overt act in furtherance of the RICO

23

conspiracy.

24
25

What you're now arguing to us is that the act
was not in furtherance of a RICO conspiracy.
43

That's not

why we took the case.

argument on that point.

statutes -- had Congress intended to create that breadth

of a remedy --

14

16

QUESTION:

I thought you were arguing they were

punishing him for past conduct.
MR. ROSENBAUM:

From a factual standpoint, yes,

17

but I'm trying to respond to Your Honor's question.

18

Assuming that the facts were different, assuming that he

19

was terminated because he threatened to blow the whistle

20

and was terminated essentially to prevent him from doing

21

so -- not the facts in this case, but I'll assume it for

22

Your Honor's question.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. ROSENBAUM:

25

That's fine.
Even so, he lacks standing,

a) because this is not a whistleblower statute -- Congress
44

1

has enacted whistleblower statutes in other contexts when

2

seeking to enforce violations of other -- other violations

3

of other types of statutes, environmental statutes, civil

4

rights statutes, so on and so forth, so had Congress

5

intended to do that, it certainly knew how and could have.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Rosenbaum, you keep using the

7

term standing, and I think Mr. Starkman did also, I

8

thought what's presented here is did Congress create a

9

civil right of action of this nature, where the act

10
11

complained of is not a predicate act.
That sounds to me like a 12(b)(6) question, is

12

there a claim for relief that can be stated, but you keep

13

using the word standing, and to that extent Mr. Starkman

14

is in agreement with you.

15
16
17

Isn't this a question of, did Congress create a
private claim for relief?
MR. ROSENBAUM:

Yes, it is, Justice Ginsburg.

I

18

think the two go hand-in-glove.

19

indicated in Holmes, it used a proximate cause analysis to

20

determine whether someone remotely down the linear chain

21

in effect had standing to seek relief under RICO, so I

22

think the two go together.

23
24
25

I think, as the Court

It's a question of nomenclature.

I don't think

the answer to the question is essential to the outcome.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rosenbaum, section 1962(d) I

2

well as a civil cause of action.
MR. ROSENBAUM:

3
4

Absolutely, Justice O'Connor.

Absolutely.
QUESTION:

5

And could there be a criminal

6

prosecution brought here without proof of any predicate

7

act?

MR. ROSENBAUM:

Absolutely.

QUESTION:

Or overt act --

MR. ROSENBAUM:

4

QUESTION:

Under the criminal

Yes.

Or an act -- proof of an overt act

would not be required if it were a criminal prosecution.
MR. ROSENBAUM:

That's correct.

All that's

5

necessary for a criminal prosecution is proof of the

6

unlawful agreement.

7

However, in the criminal context, which

8

distinguishes section (d), the interpretation of section

9

(d) from the similar -- a similar interpretation in the

20

civil context, the -- if there is an overt act, it may be

2

a completely innocent overt act, but it's demonstrated to

22

the court to show that the conspiracy is at work, so that

23

in a criminal context, a completely innocent overt act --

24

if it's a mail fraud conspiracy I go out and buy

25

stationery to facilitate the mail fraud.
46

QUESTION:

1

2

But is an overt act required for

liability in a criminal conspiracy?

3

MR. ROSENBAUM:

4

QUESTION:

5

No.

An attempt, yes, but not a criminal

conspiracy.
MR. ROSENBAUM:

6

It's not necessary to show, but

7

it's certainly helpful in demonstrating that there is a

8

conspiracy.
QUESTION:

9

But the effect of this is that we

10

have very different rules applicable in the civil action

11

context --

12

MR. ROSENBAUM:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. ROSENBAUM:

That's correct --

-- under the very same statute.
That's correct, Justice

15

O'Connor, for a very good reason.

16

and a civil statute.

17

This is both a criminal

In order to have criminal liability, as I said

18

before, all that's necessary is to show from a criminal

19

standpoint the existence of the conspiracy, but that

20

doesn't provide a civil cause of action, because the mere

21

existence of a conspiracy absent some injury, some

22

tortious conduct directed at someone as a result of the

23

conspiracy doesn't create civil liability because, as this

24

Court has said, as have other, lower courts have said, a

25

conspiracy absent an injury does not provide a civil cause
47

1

2

of action.
QUESTION:

May I ask one question at this point.

3

You've explained -- say you've convinced me that this

4

doesn't apply to whistleblowers.

5

question presented by the cert petition, which is, he was

6

terminated for both blowing the whistle and refusing to

7

participate in the pattern of activity.

8

9

That's only half of the

And what if one could show that in order to
close the factory, which is the objective, you had to fire

10

executive A, who would otherwise have had sufficient

11

strength to prevent the closing of the factory.

12

that covered?

13

MR. ROSENBAUM:

14

QUESTION:

Why isn't

I'm sorry, Justice, why isn't --

Why isn't that covered with -- as an

15

overt act in pursuance of the conspiracy, even if the

16

statute has nothing to do with whistleblowers?

17

MR. ROSENBAUM:

For the same reason that it's

18

not covered as a basis of whistleblower standing in

19

antitrust cases, which -- in which the Clayton Act uses

20

the same language as 1964 (c) .

21

That issue has been presented to circuit courts

22

throughout the country, and except for one circuit court,

23

in an opinion which was later limited in the Ninth

24

Circuit, in the Ostrofe case, all of the circuit courts

25

say that the nature of the injury suffered by the
48

1

whistleblower, even in the context that you gave me, is

2

not compensable based on the statutory scheme, which

3

requires, in an antitrust concept, antitrust injury.
All of the courts have said -- all of the courts

4
5

have said that even though there may be wrongful conduct

6

in terminating the employee because of his threat, that

1

isn't enough to give that person standing.

8

analogy that logic seems applicable here.

By analogy, by

The only court that has held that such a

9
10

whistleblower in that situation has standing is the Ninth

11

Circuit, in which Justice Kennedy dissented, and that

12

decision in Ostrofe, which was a Ninth Circuit decision,

13

was then about a year or two later, severely limited to

14

say that it was -- that the case was limited to its facts,

15

and virtually all of the circuits deny standing in an

16

antitrust concept based upon that.
QUESTION:

17

You know, I thought we had gotten

18

over the use of the standing point.

19

directed your attention to whether it's a violation of the

20

statute.

I don't see how we're getting into standing,
MR. ROSENBAUM:

21

Justice Ginsburg

It's a violation of the statute,

22

Justice O'Connor, to unlawfully conspire.

In a civil

23

context, absent injury, absent injury, the mere existence

24

of the conspiracy does not provide a civil cause of

25

action.

The question therefore becomes, what type of
49

1

injury must be sustained in order to have a claim under

2

1962(d).
It's our position that the only type of injury

3
4

that must be sustained where it's a 1962(d) claim related

5

to a 1962(c) violation, the only type of injury is a

6

predicate act injury, because the unlawful conspiracy is

7

formed for the purpose of committing the predicate acts,

8

that there may -QUESTION:

13

I disagree with that.

That is simply

It is not formed for the purpose of committing the
Indeed, some predicate acts may not even

bank, and the -- now, that larceny, it may be one of the

15

predicate acts, but other predicate acts on the way to it,

16

such as killing the bank guard who unexpectedly shows up

17

to try to prevent -- that's not the object of the

18

conspiracy at all.

19

It's an overt act in furtherance of it, and it

20

happens also to be a racketeering act, but there are other

21

overt acts in furtherance of it which will not be

22

racketeering acts, such as firing people.

23

MR. ROSENBAUM:

24

QUESTION:

25

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

If that's correct, then -- your

language permits your interpretation and his, in my view.
50

policy, why the policies would be different, and what I'm

19

trying to get at is your response to his reason of policy.

20

MR. ROSENBAUM:

If the law is to protect those

21

who are improperly terminated, there are more than

22

adequate State law remedies to protect that.

23

Virtually all, short of all of the States have

24

wrongful discharge statutes, or have wrongful discharge

25

common law that basically says that it's tortious to
51

1

discharge someone for the type of conduct that's alleged

2

here.
To incorporate that State common law into the

3
4

RICO statute would essentially be to federalize what are

5

otherwise State law claims, so that's my direct answer to

6

your question, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

7

But that answer leaves open, it seems

to me, the basic policy, the broader policy question that
