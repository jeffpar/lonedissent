CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN K. ULLMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. ULLMAN:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The University of Wisconsin, like public and

11

12

private universities across the country, has long had and

13

encouraged a wide range of student activities.

14

University of Wisconsin, these activities are supported in

15

part by disbursements from a student activity fund which

16

is a viewpoint-neutral forum for student groups.

17

At the

The First Amendment does not prohibit the

18

University of Wisconsin from requiring all students to

19

contribute to this viewpoint-neutral forum.
QUESTION:

20

Counsel, in -- in the course of your

21

argument, it seems to me that there are three different

22

things happening here.

23

One is that the funds are allocated through the

24

student council in a viewpoint-neutral manner, as you've

25

just said.

Secondly, funding can result from a referendum.

1

2

Like WISPIRG had a referendum and the funds were paid by

3

reason of the referendum, which it seems to me is not

4

viewpoint-neutral.
And third -- and third -- some of the funds are

5
6

used or may be used -- I'm not sure -- for what we might

7

call quintessential political activity, hypothetically --

8

this didn't happen -- going to the New Hampshire primary

9

and attending rallies and so forth.
It seems to me that all three of those present

10
11

maybe different problems, and at some point in your

12

argument, if you could just address those.
MS. ULLMAN:

13
14

There are three different funding

schemes.
The first is the GSSF funding, which is funding

15
16

for organizations that provide services to significant

17

numbers of students at the UW-Madison.

18

The second is --

MS. ULLMAN:

Now, as to that, are the funds paid

student group.

and are paid.

QUESTION:

1
2

And are they limited to certain

purposes?
MS. ULLMAN:

3

They are.

They are limited to

4

services for significant numbers of students in the areas,

5

of student health, student life on campus, that sort of

6

thing.

7

QUESTION:

But I mean the funds that are paid

8

out.

Are they paid out to support telephone bills or

9

letter writing or what?
MS. ULLMAN:

10

Yes.

There are specific budgets,

11

and they -- for the service organizations, they are for -

12

- for example, they can be the bus service and that passes

13

to all the students.

14

is the Campus Women's Center.

15

place that the forum is, as well as the activities of the

16

center.

17

QUESTION:

One of the groups they've challenged
That funds the physical

Is it -- is it fair to say that the

18

ultimate control over the payment of funds in this

19

category is retained by the university?

20

MS. ULLMAN:

The ultimate control, yes, but it

21

is -- it is a student group in all three that determine

22

the funds and the university provides a check --

23

QUESTION:

The university, at least in the first

24

category, can -- I guess they haven't done it, but they

25

could say, no, we're not going to pay out the money for 5

MS. ULLMAN:

3

In all three categories, in theory

the university could --

QUESTION:

5

MS. ULLMAN:

6

QUESTION:

Including the referendum category?
Yes.
Why don't you argue, as some of the

7

amici did, that in fact for that reason, you should

8

analogize -- we should analogize the position of the --

9

the university to the university's position when it

10

decides how to spend its own money, how to choose its

11

curriculum, how to invite speakers to the campus, if it

12

does that?

3

MS. ULLMAN:

4

QUESTION:

5
6

It -Why don't you argue?

Is there a

reason not to argue that?
MS. ULLMAN:

It is analogous to that situation,

7

but here it is the students that are choosing which groups

8

will speak, and that is very important --

9
20
21
22

23

QUESTION:

So, you're saying the analogy is not

perfect, in other words.
MS. ULLMAN:

Because the university itself is

not speaking.
QUESTION:

And do you -- do you -- do you wish

24

to adopt the position that -- that some of the friends of

25

the Court have taken, or -- or do you, in effect, wish us

not to adopt that position?
MS. ULLMAN:

2

I think -- I think we hold up under

3

either position.

I think our position this Court doesn't

4

need to go as far as the position of some of the amici.

5

think we hold up under the students determining where the

6

money shall go.

7

QUESTION:

But who --

8

QUESTION:

Ms. Ullman --

9

QUESTION:

-- performs the checking function?

10

You say in your brief that there's one exception for

11

partisan political activity.

12

that up as one possibility.

13

determine whether these student groups are engaged in

14

partisan political activity?

15

MS. ULLMAN:

And Justice Kennedy brought
Who exercises the check to

There is a representative from the

16

Dean of Students Office who participates at the committee

17

meetings and someone from the Dean of Students Office who

18

must sign off on the requisitions for the funds.

hasn't been any example in our record of the university

20

turning down some funding because it's politically

partisan.

That is against the guidelines, I

take it.

MS. ULLMAN:

2

QUESTION:

It is against the guidelines.
Ms. Ullman, you say -- you say it's

3

viewpoint-neutral.

4

to make a decision whether it's the students or the

5

university which speakers are going to be funded and which

6

aren't.

7

KKK that -- that applies for funding?

8

makes the decision that they will or will not get funding.

9

Right?

What if there is a -- a student chapter of the

MS. ULLMAN:

10
11

What does that -- I mean, somebody has

I assume somebody

Such a group would get funding,

assuming that the group --

12

QUESTION:

13

MS. ULLMAN:

Automatically?
If it comes to the forum and does

14

its application correctly, is compliance -- in compliance

15

with the rules of being a registered student organization,

16

doesn't discriminate, can fulfill those requirements, then

17

it will get funding.
QUESTION:

18

See, that -- that's what I didn't

19

understand.

20

didn't get funding under this program, didn't request

21

funding?

22

Is it the case that all of the groups that

MS. ULLMAN:

That's correct, with the handful of

23

exceptions of groups who didn't fill out their

24

applications properly.

QUESTION:

I take it that even though partisan

1

political activity is not to be funded by -- lobbying

2

activities, lobbying in the legislature is -- may be.

3

that correct?

4

MS. ULLMAN:

Under one policy, it says lobbying

5

should be excluded.

6

record that student activity funds paid for lobbying.

7

There was lobbying, but there was no evidence that the

8

funds paid for it.

9

QUESTION:

Is

We haven't found anything in this

Well, but I -- I suppose funds could

10

be given to an organization generally that engages in

11

lobbying, and the -- the organization could say, well, we

12

get our lobbying money from somewhere else.

13

student funds would simply supply other expenses of that

14

organization.

15

MS. ULLMAN:

Yes.

But then the

The student funds generally

16

went to postage and printing, office supplies, things of

17

that nature.

18

QUESTION:

Ms. Ullman, I have a basic question

19

about why we should, in the first instance, adopt the --

20

the forum analysis here.

21

mean, we start with that.

22

physical public forum.

23

It's a metaphorical forum.

I

We're not talking about a

And there -- there are two ways of looking at

24

what goes on.

25

metaphorical forum, and another way is not to look at it

One way, to be sure, is to look at it as a

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005

(800) FOR DEPO

1

as a forum and simply to look at it as a mechanism for

2

funding various groups which have ideological and various

3

partisan identifications.

4

One -- or the question in my mind is what reason

5

is there to adopt the -- the forum metaphor rather than to

6

look directly at who gets the money.

7

occurred to me would be that there was no other way or no

8

practical way to have this sort of ferment of comment and

9

-- and speech except in this fashion.

One reason that

And yet, that

10

doesn't seem to be the case because I think -- what -- 70

11

percent of the student organizations seem to get along

12

without going through this process and availing themselves

13

of the activity fund.
So, my -- I'm left with the question of why

14
15

should we adopt the forum metaphor as opposed simply to

16

looking to where the money goes.

17

MS. ULLMAN:

I think there are several reasons

18

for the forum metaphor.

19

this Court did recognize that a student activity fund is a

20

forum like a park or any other forum.
QUESTION:

21

First of all, in Rosenberger,

Well, the legitimacy of the -- of the

22

practice as a whole was not at issue in Rosenberger, as I

23

recall.

24

to provide it to -- to particular religious groups, as

25

well as to everybody else.

It was simply whether, if you have it, you have

MS. ULLMAN:

1

2

That's correct, and the parties

here on both sides viewed this as a forum.
And in answer to your point about the hundreds

3
4

of groups that don't get funding,

5

actually an accurate representation of what's going on.

6

Here we have a snapshot of one year and these

7

get funding, but each year the groups that get funding

8

change.

9

that might be true in a different --

So,

Well, does it change -- does it

11

change radically?

12

percent get funding?

I mean, are there years in which 98

MS. ULLMAN:

3

25 groups

to say 70 percent of them don't get funding,

QUESTION:

0

I don't think that's

I don't know that the percent

4

changes radically, but out of the

5

respondents objected to, 2 of those were not funded the

6

next year.

7

8 groups that the

So, that's a large -QUESTION:

Okay.

Well,

it still leaves me,

I

8

think, with -- regardless of what the exact proportions

9

may be,

it still leaves me with a question, why we should

20

adopt the -- the forum metaphor.

And if -- if the

2

argument were you can't have the kinds of speech which is

22

valuable in a university setting without this practice,

23

and hence the forum metaphor,

24

describing a -- a -- at least a value of great importance,

25

then I could understand that as a reason for adopting the

in fact,

is a way of

1

metaphor.
But given the fact that there are so many

2

3

organizations in which I presume speech is going on and

4

people are coming to visit and speak and so on, who don't

5

avail themselves of this,

6

At least it's not obvious to me.

7

the other reasons are for adopting that -- that form of

8

analysis.

9

MS. ULLMAN:

I'm -- I don't have that reason.
And I don't know what

I -- I'm not sure that your second

10

statement is true, that these groups are having speakers

11

come anyway.

12

discussed in the record is all coming from these groups.

13

It takes money to invite a speaker.

14

15

Certainly the vast bulk of the speech that's

QUESTION:

So, the groups that

But do you have -- and I don't want

16

to get picky about it, but do you have record support here

17

for the proposition that you simply cannot get prominent

18

outside voices who stimulate thought without this kind of

19

centralized funding mechanism?

20

MS. ULLMAN:

I do have support from the Dean of

21

Students who said that it takes an honorarium or travel

22

expenses to get speakers --

23

QUESTION:

Well, sure, but lots of organizations

24

invite us to speak, and they come up with their own

25

honorariums.

I don't know why that necessarily implies

1

the need for the university to -- to be the middle man

2

here.

3

MS. ULLMAN:

The university made the judgment

4

that it is very important to it to have all of these

5

different groups funded.

6

analogy works is because the students pay the money into a

7

fund, and then all groups can speak.

8

9

QUESTION:

And the reason that the forum

Well, Ms. Ullman, I'm curious to know

-- we've talked about having speakers come to campus and

10

the -- the forum analogy generally.

11

impression from the opinion of the court of appeals that a

12

number of these funded groups don't purport to put up

13

speakers and invite everybody to come.

14

about their -- their business, whatever it is.

15

MS. ULLMAN:

But I got the

They simply go

I don't -- I don't agree that

16

that's true, but it -- the forum is the pot of money.

17

It's not -- I'm not claiming that each individual group is

18

holding a forum.

19

QUESTION:

Well, I was just -- I was just

20

curious factually, you know, whether or not it supports a

21

forum analogy.

22

not have big meetings on campus and invite speakers, but

23

simply go about the work they're supposed to go about?

24
25

Aren't there some of these groups who do

objected-to organizations, and they all talk about how

2

they want to educate other students and what they'll do.
QUESTION:

3

Well, I'm sure how they want to, but

4

what -- what formal steps do they take to go ahead with

5

this, I mean, other than just, you know, grab somebody

6

while they're walking between classes?

7

(Laughter.)

8

MS. ULLMAN:

9

chalkings.

They do do that.

They do poster.

They use

And they do invite speakers.

10

They have art exhibits.

11

they're engaging in all sorts of types of --

12

QUESTION:

They have photo exhibits.

So,

Well, I'd like to talk about WISPIRG

13

for a moment.

14

forum description you've given us so far because this was

15

a direct referendum where 51 percent of the votes were

16

enough to -- to fund $40,000-plus to WISPIRG.

17

seems to me, is much different from the public forum

18

argument that you've been making.

19

Number one, that doesn't match the public

So that, it

Secondly, just on the Chief Justice's point, the

20

WISPIRG application says that through its -- through

21

organizing new chapters throughout the State, this

22

additional income will allow WISPIRG to hire professional

23

staff necessary to play an even more effective role on

24

environmental and consumer protection issues.

with us to tell us what's happening here, you should

2

address that as well.

3

MS. ULLMAN:

All right.

WISPIRG did voluntarily

have a referendum that went to the student body, and it

5

was voted that they would get a certain amount from each

student's fees.

had to have a hearing before the committee where they

would decide its funding.

It had to fill out the application.

MS. ULLMAN:

2

Yes.

WISPIRG in its application

says that in the past year it has served more than 20,000

people, 75 percent on the campus.

What -- what does it serve them with?

What?

and internship programs for course credit and that they've

had at least 5,000 students use their educational

materials on environmental and consumer issues.
QUESTION:

speech serving students then, I mean, if -- if that's your

13

definition of serving students, telling them things.

what the services organizations will do, and the

That's what

I'm trying to sort out in my mind.
MR. LORENCE:

Well, I think that the -- the

government speech doctrine I think provides a line here

13

that maybe this is -- I'm trying to discern what you might

14

be getting at here -- that -- if we're talking about

15

things that the university is funding with its academic

program with tuition where it says, this is the University

17

of Wisconsin, these are our agents, that type of thing, I

MR. LORENCE:

That would be acceptable because,

from what I understand, it would be part of the government

-- it would be the University of Wisconsin extending its

agency or sponsorship or something over that event.

don't think there could be a challenge.

that and lets a student group meet to decide what speakers

MR. LORENCE:

Some of these issues in the

11

middle, I'm not exactly sure.

The facts would have to be

12

specific, but I think the issue -- where the line would be

13

drawn, as it was in Rosenberger and Rust, is, is this a

14

government speech, is this a government actor with the

15

authority or the sponsorship, agency of the university --

QUESTION:

Well, if the university is saying, we

18

want every student to pay $50 a semester to an activity

20

these activities, then why isn't that government speech?

21

MR. LORENCE:

Because there is -- it's clear

22

from the -- the student operations handbook, which is in

- the registered student organizations are distinct,

they're talked about how they are not university actors.

In fact, they could not be sued -- the university could

not be sued to say one of your groups did something wrong.

4

They're clearly separate from the government here, from

5

So, the --

QUESTION:

But I don't understand that.

Surely

7

the government can invite an outside group to come and

give a speech or put on a presentation using government

money, tuition money to ask them to do that.

But you don't -- you don't place your

position as a newspaper which is asserting a peculiar

15

editorial freedom.

16

Maybe you do.

MR. LORENCE:

message of the organizations.

you're right.

Maybe they're not being

They're promoting a message, but that

doesn't describe the totality of what's going on.

They

are facilitating the promotion of a series of messages

themselves.

political activity.

5

MR. LORENCE:

Well, in -- in light of

6

Rosenberger, that the university cannot discriminate on

7

the basis of viewpoint, which means that students -- it

8

would be impermissible for students to lobby the student

government or the university and say, cut off funding to

the -- the X group because we don't agree with them.

11

have to be funded on a viewpoint-neutral basis.

12

They

I think that the only -- that Rosenberger points

13

to a Abood/Keller type solution here so that dissenters

14

who object to these groups have a way to protect their

right of conscience.

students can be compelled to support the KKK, the Jewish

students can be compelled to support a group that wants to

QUESTION:

If -- if we don't do that, then that

Well, but again, your -- the force of

your argument depends on denying that what you are -- what

your students are supporting is a funding mechanism, is a

the question that I asked the -- the lawyer on the other

side.

3

I analyze this case as being funding for individual groups

4

as opposed to funding for a -- a pot of gold from which

5

quite disparate and inconsistent voices can have access?

Why is it that I should look at this -- why should

MR. LORENCE:

6

Well, Your Honor, that -- let me

7

try this, Justice Souter, that if there's a campus

auditorium and a group speaks there, at the end of the

9

meeting, the auditorium remains, it's under university

10

control, and the group goes home.

11

this is a forum of money, the money is given over to the

group and is converted into their message.

QUESTION:

Under this system, if

The money

Well, but the value of the

15

auditorium, in a way, is converted into messages.

16

if you want to take the long view, at some point

17

auditoriums wear out and they fall down with use.

18

can say that every group that packs the auditorium is

taking something out of the fabric and -- and is using it

for the -- for the purpose of -- of espousing the group's

message.

So, you

The only difference, it seems to me, one of

MR. LORENCE:

it than that, Justice Souter.

they're given money for is to fund their overhead

QUESTION:

6

I think that when you're giving

Yes, but the -- the argument -- well,

7

but -- that -- that -- let's -- let's say you -- you may

8

have two arguments here.

9

further than the funding should go for purposes of speech.

One, that the funding is going

That's one argument I think you were getting at at the

11

end.

And I -- I don't mean to dismiss that.
But if you put that to the side for the moment,

13

the -- the argument that the -- that the money is being

used to -- to fund and espouse a particular speaker's

viewpoint, is simply a way, I think a -- perhaps a -- is

-- the answer to that is simply the same answer as the

auditorium answer.

we can't have a babble of voices without an auditorium for

essentially the same.

MR. LORENCE:

Well, Your -- Your Honor, I -- I

4

think that there's still direct funding here, that -- I

5

don't think, for example, the union in Abood could have

said, we're funding both the Republican and the Democratic

process to have both voices --

We would have had some new union

MR. LORENCE:

MR. LORENCE:

That's right.

So, I think your -- I think that -- I think that injects

another element in the argument.

MR. LORENCE:

And -- and so, when -- when you

Well, and I would say that the

10

university as a State actor has a constitutional duty to

respect the -- the right of conscience of the students.

Their education mission must be subordinate to that, that
