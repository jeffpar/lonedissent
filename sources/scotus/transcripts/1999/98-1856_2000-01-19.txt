CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY A. SEKULOW

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SEKULOW:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Colorado statute at issue here, 18-9-122,

10
11

section 3, converts protected speech into a crime.

The

12

statute, which can be found at page 64a and 65a of the

13

petition appendix, the last two pages, imposes an 8-foot

14

floating bubble zone around every person who passes within

15

a 100-foot radius of every entrance door to every health

16

care facility in the State of Colorado.

17

floating bubble zone, the statute criminalizes a knowing

18

approach made for the purposes of engaging in

19

constitutionally protected speech unless prior consent is

20

obtained.

Within that

The consent provision alone invalidates the

21

22

statute.

It makes the peaceful distribution of a leaflet,

23

the display of a sign, and even specific oral

24

communications in a traditional public forum a crime if

25

prior consent is not obtained.

The statute targets only

There is no core or

The bubble zone, with its consent provisions,

QUESTION:

Mr. Sekulow, am I correct in

understanding that no speech, no words, are prohibited.

It's only distance.

It's when you --

But even in the zone, as long as

you're 8 feet away, you can speak.
MR. SEKULOW:

Yes, but there -- you have --

15

there are two different zones here.

inches.

MR. SEKULOW:

QUESTION:

I said that

That's --

But if in fact the woman decides she

doesn't want to go close to that person and walks around

him, then he cannot chase her.

MR. SEKULOW:

Now, that's my

That's correct.

Is that right?

If you're

23

standing still and you're there first.

In -- in that

24

regard, it operates -- the consent provision here operates

exactly as the consent provision in Madsen.

invalidates the statute.
QUESTION:

11

Well, that's not like in Madsen.

In

12

Madsen, at least the Court assumed they would have had to

move out of the bubble.

Justice's opinion said, I think.

injunction prohibited a physical approach.

QUESTION:

So, Justice

Remind me -- my original question was

4

this, and it may just require reminding me of what these

5

other cases said.

6

But if I'm standing still and I -- people can

approach me, and then I'm about the distance I am from

Justice Kennedy.

MR. SEKULOW:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And there's a woman coming along.

11

What is it -- because she can walk around me -- that I

can't tell her?

MR. SEKULOW:

14

QUESTION:

15

I think --

This is a speech case.

What's the

restriction on the speech?

MR. SEKULOW:

The display of a leaflet, the

17

showing someone written material.

18

talked about, Justice Breyer -- we talked about the

19

displaying of a Bible.

20

stated -- and I'll -- I'll quote it exactly -- that the

21

concern of the floating bubble zone was that it prevented

22

defendants, except for two sidewalk counselors, while they

23

are tolerated within the targeted zone, from communicating

24

a message from a normal conversational distance or handing

25

a leaflet to people and --

What was the distance, Mr. Sekulow?

It was more than 8 feet.

3

MR. SEKULOW:

That's correct.

It was 15 feet

Well, interestingly in this

19

particular case, the statute does prohibit impeding,

I don't -- first -- first of all,

it would be reasonable to have such a law which limited

MR. McLACHLAN:

So, with respect to all of the

MR. McLACHLAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

13

That would operate in those circumstances to the extent

14

that it involves 100 foot of the entrance and a public

I don't want to distract the Court on

thought -- and I think that's your answer, that it applies

But the point -- the reason I brought it up at

the point that I did was it indicates that your opening
