ORAL ARGUMENT OF JIM WAIDE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. WAIDE:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
When the United States Court of Appeals for the

12

Fifth Circuit threw out this jury verdict and found the

13

facts differently from what the Fifth -- from what the

14

jury found them, the court of appeals offended fundamental

15

principles that this Court has announced time and again.

16

This Court time and again has said that -- that

17

not only the facts, but the inferences to be drawn from

18

the facts is a jury question.

19

old decisions, new decisions, as recently as 1999 in the

20

Hunt case in as colorful a language as the Chief Justice

21

said in the Aikens case when the Chief Justice said that

22

the state of a man's mind is as much a fact as

23

indigestion.

conclusion.
MR. WAIDE:

2

Yes, sir.

And, Your Honor, in this

3

case, this was a long way from a coin flip.

In this case

4

what happened was we had a man that's 57 years old, that's

5

worked at the same plant for -- the same place for 40

years.

In addition to that, we introduced evidence that

10

the -- the younger supervisor and the older supervisor are

11

treated far differently.

12

In addition to that, we introduced evidence that

13

the man that's making the decisions had absolute power,

14

according to our evidence.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Waide, you presented three

rather specific questions.
One is whether the prima facie proof of age

18

discrimination, coupled with evidence sufficient to

19

support a finding that the employee was not offered a true

20

reason for an adverse employment action, is sufficient to

21

sustain a jury verdict.

22

Then the second one is whether on passing from

23

-- passing on a motion for judgment of law under Federal

24

Rule of Civil Procedure 50, the court can consider all the

25

evidence or just the evidence favoring the non-moving

party.
And then, three, whether the standard for

3

granting summary judgment under rule 50 is the same as

4

that for granting -- rather, judgment as a matter of law

5

under rule 50 is the same as summary judgment.

May -- are -- are you addressing each of those
in turn, or is this kind of a general -MR. WAIDE:

Your Honor, this first one addresses

the first issue; that is, what evidence is necessary to

10

take the case to the jury.

11

do all blend together, Your Honor.

12

13

QUESTION:

MR. WAIDE:

15

QUESTION:

17

Yes, but don't blend them too much

because some of us may think they're separate.

14

16

That's the first one, but they

Thank you, Your Honor.
If you prevail on the first one, do

you need to go any further?
MR. WAIDE:

Your Honor, we think it's very

18

important that we do because this -- this test that the

19

Fifth Circuit has of all evidence -- what it's resulted in

20

is the -- is the judge is accepting as true the evidence

21

that the jury didn't believe.

QUESTION:

favorable to the non-movant.
MR. WAIDE:

It's supposed to be, Your Honor, but

evidence, when they say, for example, in this case we say

2

that Mr. Chestnut -- this is a fellow that wrote his

3

supposed boss, the one they claimed was his boss, and

4

said, wake up and learn to do your job.

5

was entitled to believe that, but on the other hand, the

6

Fifth Circuit, because they consider all the evidence,

they say, oh, no, Ms. Sanderson made the decision.

where we get into problems.

9

QUESTION:

We think the jury

That's

Well, then, maybe they applied that

10

standard incorrectly, but if the standard -- does it make

11

a whole lot of difference whether it's all the evidence,

12

just the petitioner's evidence, just the plaintiff's

13

evidence, so long as you must draw every inference, you

14

must read every piece of testimony in the light most

15

favorable to the non-movant?

16

MR. WAIDE:

Your Honor -- Your Honor, I do -

17

respectfully, I do believe that it makes a difference

18

because whenever you say all the evidence, that leaves you

19

open to take evidence the jury didn't believe.

me to be inconsistent with it, in the light most favorable

my brief, has got -- to me has got the sensible test.

5

We should take the non-movant's evidence, together with

6

any evidence from the other side that's unimpeached,

7

that's reliable evidence.

This is page 35 of my brief, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

So, it does go beyond just the

plaintiff's evidence?
MR. WAIDE:

10

Yes, ma'am.

The test that Professor

Wright -- Professor Wright studied all these cases, Your

12

Honor.

I'm not smart enough to figure all this.

studied all this, and he's taken all the courts of

So, yes, Your Honor, I think that test needs to

be done away with.

That's why --

That's the source of the problem.

What about -- what -- what's your

position on evidence produced by the moving party that is

MR. WAIDE:

it and how?
MR. WAIDE:

Your Honor, you settled it in this

are the same, and in the Lesage summary judgment case,

MR. WAIDE:

2

With only one exception, Your Honor.

When we get to the appeals court level -- when we get to

4

the appeals court level, in the summary judgment standard,

there's a de novo review.

It's on the papers.

A trial judge, very experienced trial judge, good

given to that determination.

I think you're wrong there, if I may

15

say so, that the -- the trial -- at this stage, when

16

you're talking about judgment as a matter of law, you're

not supposed to be evaluating the truthfulness or the

They're

supposed to be doing it as a matter of law.
MR. WAIDE:

But in fact it's an evaluation of the evidence.

It's called a matter of law to make it

QUESTION:

I think you're confusing a motion for

a new trial where we do -- where the appellate court is

9

supposed to give some deference to the district court,

10

where the judgment as a matter of law which, as you say,

11

is de novo.

12

MR. WAIDE:

Yes.

Your Honor, if the Court

13

please, I -- I know Your Honors have said, as a matter of

14

constitutional law, they have to give deference when

15

they're reviewing a motion for a new trial, but I believe

16

that the same rationale applies because, Your Honor, the

they heard the witnesses.

Mr. Waide, is it -- is it your

position that a plaintiff is always entitled to get to the

22

action is false?

MR. WAIDE:

7

Your Honor, all I can say is if we

have a situation like we have in this case, where we've

disproved -- we've -- we've done all we -- I mean, Justice

10

Scalia says, well, maybe they just didn't like him.

11

Your Honor, the jury saw Mr. Reeves.

likeable fellows I ever met.

He's one of the most

He's worked there for 40

years.

might have said that they just didn't like him?

Well,

What do they mean they didn't -- that the jury

They saw him.

The jury

How could anybody not

So, that is a -- that is an inference that the

jury was entitled to draw, that he's a very likeable

9

fellow, and the reason they fired him was account of his

age.

21

about the time they started this investigation, which I

believe -- which the jury believed -- doesn't matter what

I believe -- was a big line of hoax.

And he made those age comments corresponding with

we proved he's 57, we proved he's worked there 40 years,

lying about who made the -- who made the decision.

the real decision maker was the fellow that made the age

comments.

It's very rational to say, well, you

Your Honor, this case -- this case --

QUESTION:

And

When you say lying, I mean, you know,

10

all it requires is that the jury think it more likely than

not that the employer's explanation was not -- was not the

true one.

13

know, on balance I think probably that's not the correct

explanation.

making these falsifications of time records or not, we -we introduced evidence to find it was all a big hoax.

It

was a lie.

4

And once they find it's a lie and once we

5

introduce evidence that points to age, such as age

6

statements, and they don't introduce anything else -- they

7

never came in and gave any explanation about why they

8

lied, and they were caught lying time and time again --

9

then it's rational for the jury to infer that it was age.

10

Your Honor --

11

QUESTION:

But you're saying --

QUESTION:

Well, you -- you -- I take it your

13

answer is that in this case you introduced more than

simply the prima facie case --

MR. WAIDE:

QUESTION:

We --- and you introduced more than

17

simply showing that the pretext -- or that the employer's

18

alleged reason was false.

19

MR. WAIDE:

20

QUESTION:

You say that --

We did, Your Honor.
But our question is, as a matter of

21

law, may you go to the case if you have just a prima facie

22

case and a showing that the employer's asserted reason is

23

not true?

24
25

MR. WAIDE:

Yes, sir, so long as it's a showing

not -- that it's -- that it's -- that has mendacity.

I

call it lies because I'm not -- we got to show that they

lied about it.

3

that would be sufficient to go to the jury.

I think, Your Honor, as a general rule

So, then it depends -- it depends on

the -- on the strength

of

No, sir.
-- your reputation of the employer's

asserted reasons?
MR. WAIDE:

10

As long as a plaintiff introduces

evidence of it, Your Honor.

Of course, the court can't

12

waive the evidence and say, you know, they still claim

3

they weren't lying, that they were telling the truth.

we introduced evidence that they were.

MR. WAIDE:

Sure, we may lose.
The jury could go either way.
Your Honor -- Your Honor, when

Justice Scalia wrote the opinion in just -- everybody

5

thought -- they told the plaintiffs' lawyers, well, that's

a very bad opinion for you all, isn't it?

actually I think that's a great opinion because it lets

the jury decide.

11

MS. MILLETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

It is the province of the jury to draw

13

permissible inferences from conflicting evidence presented

14

at a trial, and the only question in this case is whether

15

the jury's inference of age discrimination was

16

permissible.

It was.

17

As the --

QUESTION:

Well, that isn't exactly how the

19

question was phrased, unfortunately.

I mean, if we were

20

just reviewing the verdict, you might be right.

21

says basically whether the defendant is entitled to

22

judgment as a matter of law when the plaintiff only

23

produces evidence of a prima facie case of discrimination

24

and that the legitimate nondiscriminatory reason

25

articulated by the employer is false.

MS. MILLETT:

QUESTION:

3

Now, actually the petitioner says more evidence

was introduced than that, and therefore, there was plenty

5

of evidence for the jury to legitimately find as it did.

6

And how do we extract from the question presented the

7

result that you -- you ask us to achieve?

9

Bare bones.

MS. MILLETT:

8

Yes.

Yes.

We think even -- even if --

if the additional evidence wasn't here, the outcome would

10

be the same for purposes of the question of whether the

11

case gets to the jury.

13

employee has demonstrated that the most likely reasons for

14

the discharge in this case were -- are eliminated, and if

15

the employee also shows that the employer in a court of

law, in the face of an accusation of age discrimination

and with control over the relevant information about the

decision, comes forward with a false reason for the

19

action --

QUESTION:

So, then under your view only if in

the case where the employer comes up with a purportedly

nondiscriminatory reason for the discharge, only if that

is unchallenged by the plaintiff does the defendant get

judgment as a matter of law.

MS. MILLETT:

Yes.

If -- if the defendant does

8

not -- I'm sorry -- if the employee, the plaintiff, does

9

not put in evidence not only that's unchallenged -- they

could challenge it but not put in enough evidence that

would allow a reasonable jury to disbelieve or to reject

MS. MILLETT:

The prima facie case also includes

the requirement that the plaintiff show that the most

12

likely explanations for the employment action have been

eliminated, and I think as Justice O'Connor said in Price

4

Waterhouse, there's -- at that point you have made a --

employer, that the more likely explanation is

discrimination.

QUESTION:

1

May I just make a suggestion here?

Aren't you -- isn't your argument depending on the -- on

the requirement for the prima facie case that it be shown

that the employee who was fired is, in fact, competent to

- that's -MS. MILLETT:

7

That's -

There -- there are two things.

They have to show they are qualified -- that is another

prong of a prima facie case -- and that the position

remains open outside the RIF context.
QUESTION:

11
12

But qualified doesn't necessarily

require him to come in and show that he was doing a good

It's just that he has qualifications for the job.

Isn't that right?

explanation -- that the prima facie case, all by itself

that would support a jury verdict -- the employer's

21

explanation -- the prima facie case in isolation gets you

to a jury.

look at the ultimate question of whether there's evidence

from which one could infer discrimination.

this Court, since at least 1872 and going through a month

ago today, has held and reaffirmed that a court such as

the district court under a rule 50 motion, the appellate

court on review, must look at all of the evidence but in

6

Now, we ask why is that.

The purpose of that is

7

in the Improvement Company v. Munson case, cited in the

product liability counsel's brief filed in support of

Court held that the mere fact that there may be some

evidence that's introduced does not necessarily mean that

12

the quantum is there to warrant the jury determination.

13

And the Court held there in Improvement Company v. Munson

14

that it was the function -- there was a preliminary

question for the judge to determine whether or not, under

the substantive law involved, there was sufficient

evidence to warrant a jury determination.

I think, Your Honor, in -- in the case of

Anderson v. Bessemer City, actually cited by petitioner in

MR. SMITH:

All right.

19

Your Honor, let us now review and revisit, if

20

you will, the respondent's interpretation of the teachings

21

of this Court in Hicks and Hazen Paper.

22

Initially, to back up before Hicks and revisit

23

Hazen, we know that the court there stated quite clearly

24

that with respect to age discrimination, there's no

25

disparate treatment if the reason is a factor other than

age.

These are some general principles I think it

2

important to revisit.

3

In Hazen, we also discussed the fact that there

4

the mere fact that an employer maybe violated ERISA

5

and/or, I think in the opinion of the Court, may have --

6

may have violated in -- in another instance in an

7

hypothetical title VII with respect to race was not

8

evidence or an indication that age was the deciding

9

factor.

10

With that, I think we have to go forward then to

11

Hicks and initially remember what were the general

12

principles, as I read Hicks, to stand for.

3

Number one, that no court may substitute for the

4

required finding of the particular discrimination in issue

5

here, age, the much lesser and different standard of

6

simply disbelief of the employer's reason.

7

and time again in Hicks stated that there must be evidence

8

both that the employer's reason was untrue and that age or

9

-- in this case age was the motivation.

20

QUESTION:

The Court time

But then doesn't Hicks also say --

21

and indeed, doesn't the Fifth Circuit say in other cases

22

-- that ordinarily what you have is the prima facie case?

23

And in addition, you know one other thing.

24

wasn't telling -- the employer wasn't telling the truth

25

when he gave his reason.

there's always this qualification.

So, you're saying there was nothing

Reeves.
MR. SMITH:

11

No, Your Honor.

No, I -- I do not

12

think so.

In fact, Mr. Caldwell is the one who caught it

13

on the monthly report and corrected it and after Mr.

14

Reeves had reviewed the weekly reports.

15

There -- there are many things that Mr. Reeves

16

has stated, based on his surmise and suspicion, but it's

2

standard that the petitioner wants us to use today, there

3

is no evidence of a jury question.

4

There were two other people who were either

5

terminated or would be terminated.

There were two other

6

people -- think about this -- independent of Mr. Chestnut

7

who independently reviewed these records and made the

8

recommendations to the -- to the president that Mr. Reeves

be terminated.

There is no inference, no suspicion that

10

these two were in any way connected with these two

11

statements.
So, I guess I get back, Your Honors, to the very

beginning of my argument when I stated that when you boil

4

all of the evidence together -- that's not a good way to

5

say it, but I think that's one way to study the

sufficiency of the evidence -- that under the standard I

think is correct, there is no evidence.

why this is a jury question, Your Honor.

The jury hears

the witnesses one by one over a 4-day trial.

comes in and tries to tell this Court, which is accepted

5

in the court of appeals, what the facts were in the case.

6

There's no way to do it.

appeals can understand the facts of the case the way a

jury can when it's heard the case, heard the witnesses one

Mr. Smith

There's no way that a court of
