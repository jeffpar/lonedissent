ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PHILLIPS:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This is a contract case in which my clients have

11

12

paid more than $156 million for the right, as it said

13

in -- at Pet. App. 175a, to drill for, develop, and

14

produce oil and gas resources off the Outer Banks of North

15

Carolina.

16

Protection Act and declared, quote, that the Secretary --

17

and this at page 161a of the appendix to the petition --

18

the Secretary of Interior shall not conduct a lease sale,

19

issue any new leases, approve any exploration plan,

20

approve any development and production plan, approve any

21

application for permit to drill, or permit any drilling,

22

for a period of not less than 13 months, and potentially

23

for an indefinite period thereafter.

24
25

Later, Congress intervened in the Outer Banks

Congress could hardly have been any clearer in
its efforts to repudiate the basic lease obligations that

1

the United States had undertaken with respect to the Mobil

2

and Marathon leases here.

3

identified by name the Mobil Oil Corporation in the

4

context of this particular statute, and said that it

5

wanted to bring this lease to a halt.

6

it had exactly that effect.

7

Indeed, Congress specifically-

Not surprisingly,

Not only did the Government categorically

8

repudiate its obligations under the lease, but at the

9

first opportunity in August of 1990, when Mobil, on behalf

10

of the other producers in the Manteo Unit, submitted a

11

plan of exploration, and sought approval to go forward at

12

the very first steps under this lease, what the United

13

States did, and it was quite clear about this, was it

14

said, this is approvable in all respects under the Outer

15

Continental Shelf's Lands Act, but we cannot approve it

16

because of the Outer Banks Protection Act. We are

17

prohibited from doing so, and as a consequence we

18

suspended the lease.

19

And then when the Secretary addressed the

20

question from North Carolina as to whether or not the plan

21

should be disapproved or otherwise modified, the

22

Department said categorically, we cannot do that because

23

it is approvable in all respects based on the 2,000-page

24

report that had been submitted by the United States just

25

months before this action was taken.

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Phillips, may I ask, this is a

2

case with some complex provisions, and is it the case that

3

under the lease the Government had the power at least to

4

suspend the lease?
MR. PHILLIPS:

5

Well, it certainly had the power

6

to suspend the lease under certain conditions in section 5

7

of the lease that said that if there is a threat of

8

irreparable injury to the environment, irreparable and

9

significant injury, there was certainly the opportunity to

10

do that.
But of course there's clearly, 1) never been a

11

12

finding by the Secretary of Interior or anyone at Interior

13

along those lines and, indeed, the Outer Banks Protection

14

Act itself cannot substitute for that finding, because the

15

Congress in the Outer Banks Protection Act made no effort

16

to conclude that there was a serious threat.

17

was that there were concerns that had not been fully

18

allayed even though this was in the face of a 2,000-page

19

report.

20

QUESTION:

All it said

I may not understand this.

I'm

21

stopping you because I want it clarified.

I thought to

22

suspend a lease is a technical activity.

23

of a lease means that the companies need not pay a series

24

of payments.

25

that they suddenly do not have a time-related obligation

The suspension

The suspension of the lease does not mean

1

in the Government to approve or to disapprove by a CZMA

2

the plan of exploration.

3

not?

Now, am I right about that, or

I mean, you are suspending the lease.

4

What

5

you're complaining about is not -- you're complaining

6

about the fact that they did not within a specified time

7

either approve or disapprove that plan, and you believe,

8

and they don't contest it, they would have had to approve

9

it under CZMA.
MR. PHILLIPS:

10
11

Right, and part of that's

because -QUESTION:

12

Now,

is the suspension of the

13

lease -- did they have a right under this reg?

14

hitting me cold suddenly.

15

under the reg to suspend the lease, not in just the sense,

16

no payment, but in the sense that we can suspend the plan

17

of exploration approval?
MR. PHILLIPS:

18

This is

I mean, did they have a right

My guess is that under the Outer

19

Continental Shelf Lands Act,

20

kinds of findings that are provided for in section 5, they

21

could bring all of this to a halt,

22

obligation under the 30-day requirement,

23

prior to the time --

25

if they had made the specific

QUESTION: But those findings are environmental
findings?

MR. PHILLIPS:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

4

QUESTION:

Yes, under the --

Serious risk?
Serious harm, yes.

And contrary to that they had a

5

2,000-page report that said there wasn't one, isn't

6

that --

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

They said there was no

8

significant risk created as a consequence of that, and

9

while the Government has made the effort in this Court to

10

suggest that there's no materiality in this context

11

because the Outer Banks Protection Act basically supplies

12

the findings that could have otherwise been supplied under

3

the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, it is absolutely

4

clear to me that that cannot be the case.

5

The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act first of

6

all does have a set of timing requirements and a certain

7

specific suspension obligations that look to serious

8

threats of harm, and also examines these things on the

9

basis of environmental considerations.

20

The Outer Banks Protection Act, in stark

21

contrast, first of all has no timing element to it.

22

you get into the studies that are required under the Outer

23

Banks Protection Act, there is no requirement to come back

24

at any time within a reasonable period and, second of all,

25

the question of environmental concerns is completely wiped

Once

1

away and, third of all, and I think perhaps in some ways

2

most important, there is a socioeconomic obligation to

3

collect information with respect to socioeconomic effects

4

that you might engage in on the outer continental shelf

5

lands by this exploration and production, and none of that

6

occurs in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.

7

strictly a function of the new amendments under the Outer

8

Banks Protection Act.

9

QUESTION:

That's

Mr. Phillips, it seems to me there

10

are some factual issues here.

You claim repudiation.

11

claim a material breach.

12

Government says you may have waived by continued

13

performance.

14

judge in this case sufficient to support your view?

15

other words --

You seek restitution.

You

The

Are the findings of the -- of a claims court

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

17

QUESTION:

In

Absolutely.

-- do you have to argue for some

18

factual determination here different from that made by the

19

claims court?

20

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

We have no -- there's no

dispute about what happened in this particular case.

22

The question is, given, 1) that Congress came in

23

and categorically repudiated all of its obligations, given

24

2) -- and these are undisputed facts -- given, 2) that the

25

Secretary refused to approve a POE approvable in all

1

respects and second, again, subsequently refused to

2

approve a POE even though it was in full compliance with

3

the Outer Banks Protection Act, so there is substantial

4

nonperformance in the face of a repudiation.
Hornbook law for 300 years and this Court's

5
6

decision in Nash v. Towne makes clear that under those

7

circumstances the violating party is not free to keep

8

something for nothing.
QUESTION:

9

But the Government says you waived

10

the acceptance of the repudiation, if that's the right

11

phrase, by continued performance.

12

court judge make finding -- was that raised in the claims

13

court?

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

Now, did the claims

That was -- one aspect of that

15

was raised in the claims court, and the claims court I

16

think viewed it as sufficiently insubstantial. He didn't

17

bother to address it specifically.

18

They did address the suspension, our exercise of

19

our rights under the memorandum of understanding, not

20

under the lease but under the memorandum of understanding,

21

to suspend these leases during the period of time that the

22

CZMA objections were ongoing.

23

claims court as the only basis for waiver.

24
25

They identified that in the

But even if you give the United States the
benefit of the opportunity to put waiver on the table at

1

this stage, based on our filing of the exploration plan --

2

based on our filing an appeal of the CZMA objection and

3

then based on the suspensions, as a matter of law that

4

cannot possibly represent an intentional relinquishment of

5

our rights under this contract, particularly in the

6

context of Court of Federal Claims litigation, where you

7

have no right to seek specific performance.

8

right to seek a declaration of your rights.

9

You have no

And in this case it's even worse than in any

10

other case, because the United States could with all

11

credibility argue until 1996 that they had never breached

12

this contract because of the unmistakability doctrine and

13

the sovereign acts doctrine that this Court had not

14

repudiated at least until the Winstar decision.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. --

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

We didn't even know if there was

17

a breach of this contract --

18

QUESTION:

Can I ask you one question?

The

19

facts are a little complex here.

20

that's been pending and stayed, as I understand it, in

21

which you're challenging the decision of the Secretary of

22

Commerce not to override the State's objections.

case still alive?

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

QUESTION:

There's another lawsuit

Is that

That case is still alive.

Now, the thing I want you to explain

1

to me, and I'm sure you have an answer to this, if you

2

filed that case seeking to protect your rights under the

3

whole program, and if that's still pending, how can you

4

simultaneously say that the whole deal is off?

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

Essentially for the reasons I was

6

just explaining to you, Justice Stevens.

Since we didn't

7

know, and the Government even today is saying there's been

8

no breach of contract, and we have no mechanism by which

9

to obtain any kind of an assessment of what our rights

10

are.

11

status quo and act reasonably in response to the

12

Government's repudiation of our rights.

13

All we've done is essentially try to maintain the

QUESTION:

But let me ask you this.

If -- say

14

you lost this case, just hypothetically, but yet, then you

15

went ahead with the other case and you won that case,

16

would you then not be able to develop the leases?

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, at that point we would be

18

able to go to the plan of exploration, but we would still

19

have -- well, at this stage now the Outer Banks Protection

20

Act has been repealed, but --

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

Is it not --- assuming the Outer Banks

23

Protection Act was still in place, we would still have the

24

same objection.

25

QUESTION:

I guess the ultimate question I'm

1

trying to ask, is it not conceivable that you could lose

2

this case and still develop the properties by winning that

3

case and get your approvals later?

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

I mean, in reality, and if you're

5

asking for a practical answer as opposed to a theoretical

6

answer, as a practical answer, no, because all of the

7

other leases surrounding us have all been turned in

8

because all of the other leasehold owners had caved years

9

ago, rather than try to litigate this matter, so that the

10

Manteo Unit no longer exists as a unit.

11

of its participants have walked away from this.

12

QUESTION:

It's all -- all

But you would have the legal right to

13

develop it if you won that case?

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, we would have the legal

15

right now to have the Secretary approve our plan of

16

exploration.

17

QUESTION:

And if they approved it, then you'd

18

have the legal right to go out and drill the wells.

19

you can't do it because of changed circumstances.

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

Maybe

Well, we would have to get --we

21

would still have to get permits, and we would have to go

22

through all of the approvals of the Outer Continental

23

Shelf Lands Act, that's true.

24

opportunity to retain our relationship with our

25

contracting partner in this context, that is, the United

We try to preserve the

1

States, as a consequence of this, given that there's no

2

mechanism for specific performance and no -- or

3

declaratory relief.

4

preserve as much of the status quo ante as we could, while

5

at the same time being as clear as humanly possible that

6

what we really wanted was to take advantage of the

7

repudiation, seek restitution, and be out -- and be done

8

with this particular --

All we could do is basically try to

9

QUESTION:

So --

10

QUESTION:

Mr.Phillips --

11

QUESTION:

-- is your answer, then, that by

12

attempting to preserve your ability to perform, you do not

13

foreclose yourself from seeking restitution when the other

14

party has repudiated the contract?

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

That is exactly our position,

16

that in the ordinary course it's an election of remedies

17

issue which comes much later in the process.

18

and all we did was to try to preserve our ability to have

19

an election of remedies at the appropriate time, and if we

20

have to elect them today, I'd take the $156 million, Your

21

Honor.

22

QUESTION:

We didn't --

May I take you back to where Justice

23

Stevens was, because you mentioned very quickly that

24

there's a statute in this picture, the CZMA, and as far as

suggesting that the States couldn't -- subject to the

2

override of the Secretary of Commerce, the States couldn't

say, even if you had every approval from Interior

4

promptly, the State could still say, North Carolina could

still say, no go, no exploration.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

We think you're out of

I mean -- and I mean,

8

it's subject to that last statement, of course, that they

9

would have -- there would have to be a reasonable basis

10

for in fact saying that there's an inconsistency with the

11

Coastal Zone Management Act.
But yes, subject to that, the only ability to go

12

3

forward under those circumstances would be to go to the

4

Secretary of Interior, or of Commerce, excuse me, and seek

5

to have the objection overridden and, indeed, in the dozen

6

cases between

followed, the Secretary in fact did overturn State

objections under the CZMA.

And there's one peculiar feature of

have had without that Outer Banks act.

In other words, if

Right.

-- you could get everything you

6

wanted from Interior and North Carolina could still say

7

no.

8

like it's stopping you in your tracks that enables you to

9

repudiate, that enables you to seek --

It's only because there is this other act that looks

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, seek restitution.

-- restitution.
There are two answers to that.

13

First of all, that may be true, because that is exactly

14

what restitution seeks to accomplish, which is to

15

acknowledge or recognize that in certain circumstances

16

events may work to the fortuity of the innocent party in a

17

way that allows them to seek restitution where -- even

18

though it's a losing contract.

19

I mean, that is the basis of the Restatement 373

20

illustration.

One says that if you pay $20,000 to buy

21

land, and the land's value drops to nothing, and the other

22

side still doesn't, for whatever reason, give you the

23

property, you are still entitled to the $20,000.

24

other side doesn't get something for nothing under those

25

circumstances, so you can classify it as a fortuity, but

The

1

it is right at the core of what 300 years of restitution

2

law is designed to allow us to do.

3

The second part of this, though is, you know,

4

the expectations of the party at that point in time, in

5

1982, was that this was going to go through quite cleanly,

6

and the evidence of that is pretty clear.

7

the first two requests for exploration plans were both

8

approved by the Secretary and by the State of North

9

Carolina with no objection at that point in time, and

First of all,

10

what -- of course, it took us a while to develop the kind

11

of environmental evidence we would need in order to put

12

together this kind of a novel arrangement in this

13

particular setting, and so time certainly ran through, but

14

our expectations all along were that we would be in fact

15

able to drill.

16

I mean, that's what my clients are in the

17

business of doing.

They're not in the business of

I think if the POE had been

had a very substantial argument for going to the Secretary

the Court:

At page 118 of the joint appendix, Mobil tells

3

us that the leases involved in this case encompass what

4

may be the largest hydrocarbon deposit discovered in the

United States since the Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska in the

6

1960's.

these leases are located,

At the same time, the tract of land on which
the point of the Outer Banks off

is unquestionably one of the most

Eastern Seaboard.
In this context,

it is perfectly understandable

12

that it is a matter of high importance to North Carolina

13

and to the United States to determine whether this

14

enormous hydrocarbon resource could be developed without

15

causing undue harm to the environment, and the statutes

16

under which the leases are issued and to which they are

17

subject is highly protective of these important

environmental interests.

In enacting the

who live in the coastal environment, and that gets us to

the OBPA, because the National Research Council had told

Congress that the MMS had failed to look at this issue.

together under the OBPA concluded that the MMS had failed

we started, is that right?

MR. JONES:

it was to me that that's exactly what Congress said it was

Now, I want to address briefly the suggestion --

2

QUESTION:

Before we leave this point, is it

3

your position that, had Congress made this finding at

4

the -- as you call it, at the time the lease was

5

negotiated, that it's quite likely the oil companies still

6

would have entered the lease?

7

MR. JONES:

I have -- I -- the only -- yes,

8

because all that Congress said is, make a realistic review

9

of these environmental issues.
QUESTION:

10

11

That should have been --

No, but you earlier said that it's a

finding that absolutely forecloses -MR. JONES:

12

No, no, no.

I'm sorry.

This -- I

3

need to get clear about this.

What is needed in order to

4

conduct the review is a threat of harm.

5

investigation of that threatened harm results in a finding

6

that there's a probable harm, then the Secretary may

7

cancel the leases, and the leases -- the moneys would be

8

returned.

Now, if the

9

But if, investigating the threatened harm, there

20

is no resulting finding of a probable harm, then the lease

21

suspension is terminated, operations recommence and, under

22

the regulations throughout this entire period the

23

substantial rights of the lessee are protected by an

24

automatic, rent-free extension of the lease for the period

25

that the investigation is occurring.

Now, one of the things that Mobil says is, but

1

2

there's a 30-day approval period in the statute for

3

exploration plans.

4

backed away from that here, because it's quite clear in

5

the legislative history and, indeed, in the text of the

6

statute that that 30-day approval period, like any other

7

period that applies under this statute, may be extended

8

and suspended whenever the Government concludes that a

9

suspension is warranted and that, of course, is exactly

Well, that, I -- I think they may have

10

the reason that these leases were suspended by the United

11

States.

12

But even if Mobil could find a basis for saying

13

that we'd breached the lease, they still would not be

14

entitled to rescission unless they established that there

15

was a material breach, one that, in the words of the

16

Second Circuit in the Frank Felix case, goes to the root

17

of the agreement and destroys its essential object and,

18

plainly, Mobil can't satisfy that requirement for two

19

separate reasons.

20

The first is that time of performance is not the

21

sort of thing that routinely in the eyes of the law is of

22

the essence and, plainly, it was not of the essence here

23

because the document itself authorizes suspensions for

24

environmental studies to be conducted and protects the

25

rights of the lessee while those are occurring by giving

him rent-free extensions of the lease provisions.
QUESTION:

2

Well, I mean, you know, true, time is

3

normally not of the essence, but that phrase means, you

4

know, if you're 1-minute late it's no big deal.

5

doesn't mean that you can perform at an unreasonably late

6

time and it's okay, unless you've said you have to perform

within a reasonable time.

MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

I -Reasonable time is of the essence,

10

and if you have not approved these operations within the

11

reasonable time that the contract envisioned, it seems to

12

me you're in breach of the contract.

13

MR. JONES:

Like all other issues of

14

materiality, ultimately you're looking at a question that

15

requires you to look at all the facts and circumstances,

16

and my point is simply that the facts and circumstances of

I don't understand that -- Congress

in the OBPA didn't usurp authority from the Secretary of

the Interior.

authority to conduct investigations that he had failed to

do and which, after Congress directed him to, on further

reflection he decided yes, I should do those additional

They directed him to carefully exercise his

10

clearly the OBPA imposed severe, burdensome new conditions

11

upon the Department of Interior's obligations under OCSLA

to approve POE's offshore North Carolina.

13

Now, I take it you disagree with that.

MR. JONES:

Yes.

The OBPA did not alter by one

Secretary of Interior ultimately was -- is to determine

verge of that when the second act passed, that the

Secretary was out of compliance with the Outer Continental

Shelf Act at the time the next act intervened?

5

what you're saying?

6

MR. JONES:

Is that

Well, I'm saying that Congress had a

7

justifiable concern about the inadequacy of the

8

environmental, including human environmental analyses that

9

had been conducted thus far.

It had received information

10

from the National Research Council advising it of the

11

inadequacies of these investigations that had been

12

conducted to that date, and it directed the Secretary to

13

conduct a thorough, realistic review.

QUESTION:

What did it buy?

What was Mobile

15

buying if they weren't at least buying a promise from the

16

Government that they'd get an exploration permit?

11

We're in the middle of those

We haven't repudiated them.

In fact, we're

fully ready to go forward.
And that leads me to the second reason why the

12

alleged breach isn't material which is that, as the court

13

of appeals correctly explained, at all times, before the

14

OBPA was enacted, while it was in effect, and even to this

15

very minute, Mobil is conclusively barred from taking any

16

actions to drill or develop these leases by the entirely

17

separate provisions of the Coastal Zone Management Act.

18

That was a statute that Congress enacted to give

19

the States a voice in the development of these leases and,

20

as this Court said in 1984 in the Secretary of Interior

21

case, lessees need to be well aware of these restrictions,

because they are significant, and they can cause

substantial delays in any development of Federal leases,

need to be done.

That's all -- that's really what the

That's

1

hardly a reasonable time, is it?
MR. JONES:

2

It is -- I think it might be a

3

reasonable time, because what Congress actually

4

suspended -- it was until the Secretary could certify that

5

he had the information required to make the findings that

6

he needed to make under the OCSLA.

7

certified that he would do that in 1992, but he found that

8

in order to make the findings required by the OCSLA he had

9

to go out and do the additional studies that MMS hadn't

10
11

The Secretary

yet done.
When he completed those studies in 1994, Mobil

12

didn't ask him to review the exploration plan.

13

asked him to continue the lease suspensions in effect that

14

had been in effect since before the OBPA was enacted so

15

that Mobil could continue its challenge to the State's

16

CZMA objections, and so the court of appeals said, well,

17

how can Mobil say that these leases that were materially

18

breached by these -- by the delay for Federal review when

19

the alleged delay for Federal review actually had no

20

consequence whatever on the ultimate performance of

21

protection of Mobil's rights.

22

Mobil

The OBPA was just a little sliver of time in the

larger spectrum of things.

Before it happened, the leases

had been suspended at Mobil's request because of the CZMA

to today, so the Court, it seems to us, correctly found

2

there is no material breach now.

3

The last point I need to make very briefly, and

4

that is that even if there had been a material breach,

5

Mobil would not be entitled to rescission because they did

6

not make a prompt demand for it.

7

leases were breached in August of 1990, when the OBPA was

8

enacted.

9

Mobil says that the

Mobil took no steps to obtain rescission until

10

October of 1992, more than 2 years later, and during that

11

interim period Mobil submitted an exploration plan,

12

challenged the State's CZMA objections, and obtained --

13

2 weeks before it filed this lawsuit obtained a perpetual

extension from the United States of these leases rent-

the findings of the OBPA and -- take those round findings

and stuff them into the

Lands Act suggests to me just a sense of

desperation.

truth is, the Government has never

QUESTION:

Well, but I take it his argument,

which I really didn't understand till I heard it -- now I

think his argument -- I don't blame him for this, but I

11

think his argument --

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

13

QUESTION:

I might, but --

-- is the following.

He says, look

14

at that finding.

That finding 3 is, the major industry in

15

North Carolina, tourism, is subject to potentially

16

significant disruption, all right, by oil and gas

MR. PHILLIPS:

MR. PHILLIPS:

QUESTION:

Right.

Now look at the reg.
Right.

And what the reg says is that there

22

shall be -- the regulations shall provide for suspension

23

if there is a threat of serious harm to the environment.

24
25

So he says, how can you look at that finding
without seeing it as a finding of a threat, and a serious

one, and really what you have to look at OBPA as is

2

telling the Secretary, suspend the leases and use whatever

3

regulatory authority you have to do it.

is basically his argument.

MR. PHILLIPS:

QUESTION:

So that, I think,

Right, and I think that --

That is not a -- that's -- I grant

you that reg wasn't quoted in the brief, I don't think,

8

but - -

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

No, it wasn't quoted in

the brief.

11

QUESTION:

But anyway, that's his argument.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

And it's subject essentially, I

3

think, to three answers.

4

didn't buy into the idea that the Outer Banks Protection

5

Act or Congress or any other action by Congress could come

6

in and substitute for the Secretary, and this case is

7

fundamentally different from the North American case that

8

they rely on, because that case said specifically that the

9

question of how many seals you could kill is completely

subject --

First of all, under the lease we

threat of serious harm to the North Carolina environment?

3

I don't know -- a finding that there is a

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, in part because the

4

definition -- and we, of course, have not had an

5

opportunity to brief what it means to be in the human

6

environment, but recall finding number 3 is tourism.

7

not an environmental provision at all.

8

injury to tourism, which they now try to tie in oral

9

argument on the fly to the notion that somehow there's an

10
11

It's

It talks about

environmental impact here.
I think it actually makes my point, which is

12

that the Outer Banks Protection Act takes you out of the

13

kinds of environmental concerns that were the core of what

14

we entered into with the Outer Continental Shelf Lands

15

Act, and has added this entire socioeconomic set of

16

analyses that never had to exist before, and I think that

17

finding is specifically embraced within it and completely

18

beyond anything that the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act

19

would have provided for.

20

So it's the wrong -- again, it's the wrong

21

entity making the wrong findings, under circumstances that

22

completely violate our agreement.

23

With respect to the question of the timing of

24

this and the notion of whether time was of the essence, I

25

would simply note that in our memorandum of understanding

that was entered into as part of the process in

989, all

2

three of the parties, the State, the Secretary, and the

3

producers, specifically found at joint appendix 84 that

4

time was of the essence by that point in this process, so

5

that, frankly, is not an argument, even though I do think,

6

Justice Scalia, you're right, is that time is the essence.

7

There's got to be at least some reasonableness requirement

8

that gets imposed.
At the end of the day, again, it seems to me

9
10

what we're talking about here is the simple question of

11

when are you entitled to restitution to get something for

12

nothing.

Justice Souter made it as plain as possible.

3

There was no performance by the United States.

To the

4

extent that there were studies that were done, they were

5

done to comply with its obligations under the Outer Banks

6

Protection Act.

and I ask the Court to reverse the judgment below.

The need to get clear on this is today,

QUESTION:

May I ask you just a question perhaps

I should have asked Mr. Jones.

CZMA we get another Secretary from another Department into

the picture.

It's odd that the Interior

in some of these cases to have Interior and Commerce

QUESTION:

I mean, they are

But why would Congress assign the

supervising role, the control role to Interior under the

Outer Continental Shelf Act, and then under the CZMA give

the control to the Commerce Department?
MR. PHILLIPS:

9

Justice Ginsburg, I think the

theory there is that there may be instances in which the

10

Secretary of Interior might be too wedded to environmental

11

concerns, and that there are other commercial issues that

12

are of greater importance, and in the appropriate

13

balance -- which is what he's supposed to do, because he's

supposed to analyze it independently -CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:
