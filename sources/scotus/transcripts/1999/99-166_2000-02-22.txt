ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD J. MANN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MANN:

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case presents a question about the

10

11

privilege against self-incrimination in the context of the

12

compelled production of documents.

13

privilege extend not only to the compelled testimonial

14

communications, the witness' admissions that the documents

15

exist, that they're in his position -- possession and that

16

that they respond to the subpoena, but also to other

17

voluntarily recorded information that is contained in the

18

documents?

19

Specifically, does the

Now, it's common ground that the contents of the

20

documents were not privileged before the compulsion.

21

Although they would have been privileged under Boyd, your

22

decision in Fisher rejected that view.

23

The issue before the Court today then is whether

24

the way in which the Government obtained those documents

25

through a compelled act of production taints what

1

otherwise would not be privileged.
Now, respondent gives us a categorical answer

2

3

that in any compelled testimonial admission of existence

4

always automatically taints the contents of the produced

5

documents.
QUESTION:

MR. MANN:

It would have been a matter of just a

10

the grand jury are the questions that we ask typically

pursuant to the U.S. Attorney's manual.

13

admissions that the Court identified in Fisher.

19

It's basically

I really don't know how long he was

QUESTION:

I thought that he had to identify

20

each document.

Obviously, what I'm concerned with is if

21

you have a witness before a grand jury for any length of

22

period, some grand jury would say, oh, he looks shifty or

23

he's not looking me in the eye, all the things jurors

think about.

scope and of this sort, a risk of incriminating the person

-- person through his testimony.
MR. MANN:

3

Well, I think that that's true, but I

4

think that in this particular case and I think in most

5

cases where you have a production of documents, you have

6

to distinguish between the things that the witness is

7

forced to say, implicitly or explicitly -- and in this

8

case, I think those things were much the same -- and the

9

contents of the documents.
And in this case -- and I think in many cases -

10
11

- we don't have to use and we didn't use in any way any of

12

the things that he said.

13

information that was in the documents.

14

key for us to this case is that it's not relevant that we

15

got the documents from respondent.

QUESTION:

I mean, all we're using is the
I think the -- the

MR. MANN:

No.

We absolutely did not know about

the contents of the documents, but -QUESTION:

You had -- you had no idea what --

what you were going to find.
MR. MANN:

Well, I mean, I think no idea is

24

probably something of a stretch, but we certainly are not

in a position to prove that we knew with reasonable

particularity what the documents contained.
QUESTION:

And it was only by virtue of the

3

production of the documents that you learned the facts

4

that enabled you to then carry out a prosecution.

5

MR. MANN:

That's absolutely right, but I think

6

it's important to -- to remember that it's clear, in the

7

cases that the Court has had since Kastigar, in Fisher and

8

in the other cases interpreting the statute, that it's not

9

a problem for the Government to show that we would not

10

have the incriminating information but for the compelled

11

act of production.

12

circumstances in which we can force a witness to speak --

It's perfectly clear that there are

13
14

QUESTION:

What do you have to show?

That you

15

had an independent source of the information or what?

16

What is it?

17

MR. MANN:

18

that's a good way to put it.

19

say that the Fifth Amendment permits the Government to use

20

things it gets from an independent source.

21

Well, I think -- I think analytically
Kastigar, of course, does

We look at Fisher as explaining that the act of

22

production has a twofold nature, that the act of

23

production itself is physical, non-testimonial conduct.

1

MR. MANN:

Well, I think what we have to --

2

QUESTION:

Do you have to show anything?

3

MR. MANN:

I think what we -- I don't think we

4

have to show anything about our quantum of knowledge of

5

the contents of the documents.

6

QUESTION:

What do you have to show?

7

MR. MANN:

I think we have to show, once --

8

under Kastigar, once a defendant shows that he's been

9

compelled to testify, the burden shifts to us to show that

10

we did not use any of his compelled testimonial

11

communications.

And in this context --

QUESTION:

12

No.

I meant do you have to show

13

anything before you served the subpoena or to get the

14

subpoena?

15

MR. MANN:

Oh, well, to get the subpoena, we

16

have to satisfy the regular standard under R. Enterprises

17

and then the regular standard under the Federal Rules of

18

Criminal Procedure to show that we have a basis for

19

issuing a subpoena.

20

difficult for grand juries to satisfy.

21

QUESTION:

Now, that standard is -- is not

Well, do you have to show anything in

22

addition in order to satisfy the Fifth Amendment, that you

23

had -- that -- that these are documents or -- or items

24

that everyone knows exists, something like that?

25

MR. MANN:

No, I -- I think we do not.

I mean,

if we don't -- if we don't know anything about the
contents of the documents, that does not in any way, it
seems to me, affect the logical relation between the
things he says when he's under compulsion -QUESTION:

So, if everybody knows that the

defendant, the target, has guns in his house, you can have
a subpoena say bring all guns that are in your house to
the grand jury.
MR. MANN:

I think that that's perfectly

permissible under the Court's decisions in Schmerber.

Suppose -- suppose

the death, and you -- you also know that the defendant has
purchased a gun of the same caliber.

You serve a subpoena

on the defendant saying, turn over this gun which -- which
you -- you are shown -- we know you own it.

Are you

entitled to get that gun?

Yes.

Now, let me explain.

that's exactly the point.

Well

QUESTION:

MR. MANN:

The difficulty, of course, in that

case is it might be that we would have difficulty in
proving that the gun had been in the possession of the
defendant, if that was relevant to us.

But, see, that goes to your initial

You said, what's special about documents?

I think

that what Fisher establishes is there's nothing special
about documents.

What the Constitution does is it breaks

up production of evidence into two classes of cases.

to demand of the defendant, who has squirreled away the

MR. MANN:

The Government can come to him and

murder.

QUESTION:

And then you can introduce it in

MR. MANN:

Right?

It's obviously more difficult for the

going to have a heavier --

MR. MANN:

Not all guns.

This particular gun.

QUESTION:

The .38 caliber automatic that you

MR. MANN:

Okay.

I would respond to you with

the hypothetical that Justice Stevens has in his dissent

MR. MANN:

I think it's a distinction that the

Court has had to draw.

policies founded in our history.

the right to every man's evidence, and the Court talks

2

about at great length about how important this is.

At the same time --

QUESTION:

Well, that's your -- that's your

Schmerber point, but I don't see how Schmerber is -- is

6

helpful to you here because Schmerber -- the instance in

7

which the individual, in effect, makes his bodily -- body

8

available for the drawing of the blood sample and so on,

9

Schmerber does not involve the implicit representations

10

that are made, for example, in this case when the

11

documents are produced or in Justice Scalia's hypothetical

2

when the individual implicitly indicates that, yes, the

3

gun is in his possession by -- by turning it over.

4

don't see Schmerber as being help to you at all.

5

MR. MANN:

I -- I

Well, Schmerber involves I think a

6

unitary act of production, and according to the Court in

7

Schmerber, it -- that one was analyzed as wholly non­

8

testimonial.

9

production that under Fisher has two natures to it.

So, what we have today is an act of

20

a physical, non-testimonial act of production.

22

communication.

It's

So, the question for the Court is to decide,

24

25

are.

QUESTION:

5

Justice Scalia's gun hypothesis because presumably

6

virtually anyone has tax records and accounting records.

7

It's no confession to say that -- to say that those exist

8

and that they're in the person's possession.
MR. MANN:

9

And I -- I think that goes to our --

10

the second question presented, which the second question

11

presented suggests that if the quantum of evidence that we

12

have about the documents reaches a certain level, then --

then it's -- then it's a foregone conclusion that he has

So, if we're just going by what the Court held in

MR. MANN:

This case is more like Doe I.

Well, on the foregone conclusion

11

point, that may be true if you look -- if you look at it

12

that way, but I think one problem with that analysis is

13

that in Doe I, the Court, of course, did not itself

main submission is that even if we would not prevail on

No.

Our view is that in either case

we can get him to produce -- in either case he's required

to provide the guns to us.

Now, we have obtained from him a slightly

MR. MANN:

We obviously have to show less to get

a subpoena, but the reason for that is because when you

MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

the subpoena.

2

First, the subpoena compels a physical act, the

3

transfer of documents from the witness to the Government.

4

Second, the subpoena also compels the witness to

5

make certain implicit testimonial admissions about that

6

the responsive documents exist, that they are in his

7

possession, and that the production to the Government will

8

transfer the documents to the Government.

9

Now, the witness is protected by the Fifth

10

Amendment only with respect to the testimonial components

11

of the act of production, not with respect to the physical

12

act itself that transfers the documents.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, I -- I gather that means

14

that your answer to my hypothetical earlier would be that

15

there is no Fifth Amendment problem in requiring a person

16

to turn over the handgun which -- which was used in the

17

commission of a murder.

18

MR. DREEBEN:

No, Justice Scalia.

I think that

19

there's a substantial Fifth Amendment claim that the

20

witness has, that possession of that handgun is highly

21

incriminating, and as a result, the witness can assert the

22

Fifth Amendment and require the Government to give the

23

witness act of production immunity if the Government

24

wishes to enforce the subpoena.

But the only thing the Government

2

can't use is the fact that he turned it over to prove that

3

he possessed it.

4

the record that he purchased it and -- and leave it to the

5

jury to surmise that he still continued to have it at the

6

time of the murder.

7

The Government could come in and show

Right?

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, the Government has to show

8

that it does not use anything testimonial in the

9

investigation that leads up to the prosecution.

10

QUESTION:

But the Government could show at the

11

trial that the murder was committed with a handgun that

12

had been purchased by Mr. X.

QUESTION:

MR. DREEBEN:

It would need to do at least that,

and it would also need to show that it did not make use,

And I'd like you to focus on that.
MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Breyer, I think, first of

3

all, the -- the notion that the subpoena respondent says,

4

the thing exists, is not a meaningful statement and is not

5

one that the Court's cases actually contemplate as being

6

the testimonial statement.

7

that, but the only meaningful statement that a respondent

8

can make is that responsive documents exist, which is a

9

way of correlating what the subpoena calls for with what

10

11

I realize the Court has said

the documents actually say.
And the Government may not use -- make use of

12

the mental act that the witness uses to correlate

13

documents with a subpoena.

14

most important when the document itself is, for example, a

list of numbers and the witness produces it under a

just to read through the whole subpoena on page 47 and 49.

you're going to be probing the perception, the cognition,

It's very odd to me, in response to

Boyd under which the notion was that the contents of the

documents themselves were testimonial and that a witness

19

was being compelled to testify by producing those

contents.

MR. DREEBEN:

And -- and what -- what happens in these

it may or may not be incriminating for the witness to say
this document exists, but if the document is one which
will cause him to lose his liberty and if the Government

Well, that's -- I took Justice

13

Breyer's question as -- as being susceptible of that

a subpoena of -- of this breadth.

16

what's the rationale we have for drawing the line between

17

something that's very specific and something that's this

18

broad?

19

But the question is

I -- I'm not sure what the rationale is.
MR. NIELDS:

Well, the rationale again gets back

20

to -- you asked the question are you relying on the

21

witness' truth-telling to get the evidence that you seek,

22

and if the answer is yes, then the Fifth Amendment

23

applies.

QUESTION:

I see that.

Now, apply that to

revolution there?

I mean, after all, the same principle

will apply whether it's a business record or any other
kind of evidence that the -- the person asserting the
amendment has in his possession.
MR. NIELDS:

I mean, pardon me for saying so,

but I think that prosecutors all over the country would
fall down dead if they thought they could subpoena guns or
-- or incriminating bloody underwear or -- or -QUESTION:

Booty from hijacking or something.

MR. NIELDS:

Yes.

I mean, it just -- it's

completely unthinkable.
And I would say this, too, while we're on the
law enforcement topic.

One of the things -- not only is

this immunity that they have issued here, according to
their understanding of it -- not only is it ineffective
from my client's point of view, ineffective to meet the
constitutional requirements, but it's ineffective from
their point of view.

for -- for law enforcement is that it removes the witness'
incentive to lie because it holds him harmless.

that turns up.

fine, you can compel those and use the contents against

2

the producer.

3

MR. NIELDS:

I don't think so.

I think in the

4

first Doe case the Court held that the act of production

5

is privileged, and the Government, therefore, didn't get

6

the documents.

7

9

QUESTION:

But it went on to say the contents of

voluntarily prepared private papers enjoy no privilege.
MR. NIELDS:

Yes, and -- and that was also said

10

in Fisher, and it's a very important and very true thing.

11

But it doesn't answer the question of -- of what do you do

12

if the testimony you do compel leads you to documents.

13

And -- and in the example analogous to a gun

14

where the -- the crucial document is some smoking gun

15

document, is possessed by the witness, if the witness is

16

asked orally in the grand jury, is there such a document,

17

where is it located, and the Government goes and gets it,

18

the document isn't privileged, but it's absolutely tainted

19

and couldn't possibly be used.

20

But getting back to the point I was making

21

before, this kind of immunity says to a witness, witness,

22

you are obligated to turn over all your documents and if

23

there are incriminating ones in them, I will use them to

24

indict you.

25

not only ineffective for the Fifth Amendment, but it's

That is a terrible kind of immunity.

It's

1

ineffective law enforcement, that you want to be able to

tell the witness, now that you're under immunity, you

should give me all your documents because the only way you

can get into trouble is -- is to respond falsely.
