ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK D. OLSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. OLSON:

9

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
We present two questions today, and the advance

10
11

of theory for the resolution of the case before this

12

Court.

13

supreme court correct when it held that a visitation order

14

to a person other than a parent may not be granted absent

15

a showing of physical or mental harm to the child, and the

16

other question is, should the Court at this time resolve

17

all of the constitutional questions that could be raised

18

by any other orders, other than the Troxel order before

19

this Court?

20

The first question is, was the Washington State

The answer to those questions are, we believe,

21

the court did not make the correct decision below

22

requiring a greater standard by a specific showing of

23

substantial harm to the child than is already required by

24

the best-interests-of-the-child standard, and we also ask

25

this Court to leave for another day the resolution of the

1

constitutional questions that may be raised by other

2

visitation orders not before the Court.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Olson, it's not clear to me just

4

what the Washington court included in the word harm.

5

harm be stress to the child because of the severance of a

6

substantial relationship?

7

clear to me how we even define the term.
MR. OLSON:

8

9

that is a problem.

Is that harm?

The term harm is fuzzy.

not

There --

Is it -- and I agree, is it a little

10

bit of harm?

11

bruises if visitation isn't ordered, or --

Is it a great deal of harm?

QUESTION:

12

I -- it's

Can

Do we look for

It surely must mean more than

13

physical harm, but what other things fall within it, do

14

you think?
MR. OLSON:

15

Harm to the child.

It is difficult

16

to put one's finger on what harm is.

17

the-child standard subsumes many factors that the court

18

considers.

19

QUESTION:

Best-interest-of-

Can you argue that best interest of

20

the child like, not being -- that the child is harmed if

21

his best interests are not being served, so that it's just

22

really the flip side?

23

MR. OLSON:

Well, we believe that the rule of

24

the Washington supreme court requires a greater harm, a

25

more specific showing, although that term is fuzzy, as

1

Justice O'Connor points out, but in the best-interests-

2

of-the child standard, there is harm considered to the

3

child whether visitation is ordered or not ordered.

4

QUESTION:

I always considered the supreme court

5

of Washington agreed with what you just said.

6

thought that the State statute said best interests of the

7

child, and the supreme court of Washington said that you

8

can't get a third party visitation rights as against the

9

parent unless you can show harm, which suggests that they

10

I had

thought the two might -- were mutually exclusive.

11

MR. OLSON:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. OLSON:

14

QUESTION:

That harm and the best interests -That -- yes.
-- standard were exclusive?
That the best interests standard

15

would cover a much broader spectrum than the harm

16

standard.

17

MR. OLSON:

If I understand the question

18

correctly, our concern is that the focus of the best

19

interests of the harm standard would over-emphasize that

20

and create a hurdle that would be greater, or higher, or

21

more difficult to prove and would, particularly in the

22

case that is before this Court, would effectively bar

23

visitation for the Troxels --

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. OLSON:

But Mr. Olson, isn't that some --- when it's very slight.

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Olson, isn't that something for

2

the Washington supreme court to spell out piece by piece?

3

After all, it's not our job to say what, under a State

4

law, harm means, because that definition can come over

5

time, the way law generally develops, case by case.

6

MR. OLSON:

And that is why the theory that we

7

advance to the Court is that the magnitude of the

8

intrusion be balanced against the constitutionally

9

required justification, and in this case we believe that

10

best interests of the child is sufficient for the order,

11

because the intrusion in our case is slight.

12

25.5 hours a month with the grandparents, and we believe

13

that it is a State issue.

14

QUESTION:

It's just

But you have to show, don't you, that

15

at least this visitation order is constitutionally

16

permissible?

17

struck down the entire statute, and the argument you make,

18

which I think has some force to it, is that you don't

19

lightly strike down an entire statute, and -- but you do

20

have, from your point of view to avoid that you have to

21

show that there's at least some order that could be issued

22

consistent with this statute which would not be

23

unconstitutional, and -- I think your problem, probably,

24

is to what extent can a court intervene in the case of

25

parents who are not harming the child to say that

The supreme court of Washington I guess

outsiders such as grandparents can have a court-ordered

visitation right?
MR. OLSON:

I'm not certain of the question to

4

me, Mr. Chief Justice.

5

Ginsburg asked, does set forth the best-interests-of-the-

6

child standard that the trial court would then apply in

7

any given case.
The intrusion in our case, in the Troxel matter,

The State courts, as Justice

is very slight.

There's no constitutional infringement

10

upon any religious belief, right to educate, or any other

11

matter.

12

as was stipulated at the trial court by the experts and by

13

the mother.

14

It is simply in the best interests of the child,

QUESTION:

But you do have a line of cases not

15

directly on point, but that cut the other way, I think.

16

That is, the parents, it's up to the parents to decide,

17

you know, not just who has custody, how the kids are going

18

to be brought up, who they're going to see.

19

MR. OLSON:

20

QUESTION:

Yes.
Does this mean that next a great aunt

21

can come in and say, well, you know, I want to take her to

22

the movies every Friday?

23

MR. OLSON:

Well, the line of cases held that

24

any parental decision is not above government regulation,

25

but a parental decision would be subject -- I'm sorry.

State regulation would be subject to strict scrutiny of a

parental decision in the area of religion or First

Amendment, if I understand the question, but in this case

it is not.

QUESTION:

But also health and safety.

Isn't

6

that -- those cases say parents decide, but the State can

7

regulate to spare the child from harm.

8

MR. OLSON:

9

QUESTION:

That is true.
And you say the State can regulate

10

just whenever it's in the best interests of the child.

The parent says, no candy.

all those other hypotheticals would be left for the State

But do you really think that the

11

MR. OLSON:

Regarding the expense, Your Honor,

to award attorneys'

court can address that.

MR. OLSON:

I believe, Your Honor,

that the

That means that

Therefore,

it seems to me that,

for you to get

relief in this Court, we would have to hold that in every

possible or reasonably possible application of that

that, Washington was perfectly proper in declaring the

you've either got to get a new statute, or you've got to

doing.

Am I missing something in the posture of the
case?

15

MR. OLSON:

Well, the State court didn't strike

16

down the statute because it was too broad.

court did was,

18

that there was a requirement of a substantial physical and

19

mental harm to the child.

1

And it seems to me that unless we are

2

in a position to resurrect the statute, you really don't

have a claim to make under the law of Washington, and

4

you're not making an independent constitutional claim of

5

your own.
MR. OLSON:

6

There are three responses I have,

7

Your Honor, and that is that the any person language

8

admits that family law is complex, and the nature of

families is so varied that it's impossible for us to -QUESTION:

Well, it may be complex, but let me

walking in off the street, without any relationship by

7

Do you believe that anyone, as against the

MR. OLSON:

The best-interests-of-the-child

QUESTION:

Mr. Olson --

QUESTION:

That's now what the supreme court of

Washington said.
QUESTION:

Mr. Olson, I think I disagree with

16

Justice Souter as to the standard you have to meet, but I

17

think we're both focusing on the same kind of thing.

18

understanding is that, unless you're talking about the

19

area of the First Amendment, if a statute is to be

20

stricken down on its face, as the supreme court of

21

Washington did here, you must -- the person supporting

22

that must show that there are no possible applications of

that it was her decision, and there were no other

in the court.

QUESTION:

Why isn't that enough of a

MR. OLSON:

Well, two questions there.

The

common law question is in our footnote, I believe it's 45,

17

Where there's a dispute between the parents,

5

that will be resolved in the best interests of the child,

6

but where it's a dispute between the parents and someone

else, you think common law courts just say, well, what's

say, well, what do the parents want?

It seems to me they
They don't want the

kid to eat candy, the kid doesn't eat candy.
MR. OLSON:

Well, the courts do look at many

12

factors under the best-interest-of-the-child standard as

13

well as the fact that in some cases the parents themselves

14

are responsible for creating the relationships that now

15

the child requires, and the child does, we assert, have

some constitutional claim here, and the court should

But I did have this question for you.

5

As I understand, one of the problems with this statute is

6

anybody's standing, but is it not true that there are a

7

lot of statutes out there that give grandparents standing,

8

and relatives, and I'd just like to ask you, what is the

9

standard that is applied in most of the statutes

10

throughout the country?

11

MR. OLSON:

In 48 States, the standard is best

12

interests of the child and no substantial harm, physical

13

or mental,

14

is required to be shown.
QUESTION:

So that if we were to invalidate this

15

statute on the grounds suggested in the questioning, we'd

16

probably invalidate 48 statutes.

17

MR. OLSON:

18

QUESTION:

48 States, that's right.
When you refer to the 48 statutes,

19

were you referring to the 48 statutes that give rights to

20

the whole world, or 48 statutes that give rights to

21

grandparent s ?

22

MR. OLSON:

There are approximately four

23

statutes that include the provision, any person.

The

24

other statutes do attempt to limit to siblings or step­

The children had a 2-year relationship with the

2

grandparents, staying in the grandparents' home every

3

other weekend, and there was a substantial relationship

4

from the ages of 1 and 3 until the action was filed and

5

the children were 3 and 5 years of age.
There is that relationship.

6

There is the

7

requirement, we hope, that the memory of the children's

8

father will be preserved in the -- by the grandparents,

9

and that the growth of the children will be enhanced by

10

knowing the kinship in the family, where they come from,

11

and that is a very, very significant interest for the

12

State to have in terms of how our children develop and

13

what occurs with regard to their growth.

14

In terms of the harm question, Justice O'Connor,

when children are taken away, or where there's significant

grief or loss, a lot of time that pain goes deep within.

there is loss of adult relationships -QUESTION:

19

Well, what you're saying is that the

loss of a substantial relationship can constitute harm, in

your view.

that other factors may be considered, and it is the best-

QUESTION:

Mr. Olson, let's assume that this

2

Court at least agreed with you to some extent and said

3

yes, given the special relationship that grandparents may

4

normally establish with their children, some heightened

5

standard less than the harm that might be necessary for

6

the State to move in would suffice to justify overcoming

7

the parents' constitutional claim of their rights to bring

8

up the children without interference.

we held that was the law.

Let's assume that

Wouldn't you be faced with this, nonetheless.

11

The case would go back to the State of Washington, and the

Washington supreme court would say, well, we certainly

the parental Federal constitutional rights.

We accept

I am not aware of another

you have a third party coming into court and asking for

associational rights with the child, essentially.
Now, there may be circumstances under which

people want to have children do other things, but I

believe that the lower courts are perfectly capable of

looking at the differences between deciding whether a

20

which I believe, Your Honor, is sort of -- I think it was

Justice Kennedy who said, this is sort of the flip side of

the harm analysis, and having a court independently

so important in domestic relations that this distinction

2

be made is that if you put the burden on someone to show

3

harm, as that will be defined and as it has been defined

4

in many cases in Washington -- and most particularly I

5

would ask the Court to look at the Littlefield case which

6

was decided 2 years ago in Washington and talked about

7

harm in a relocation and travel situation.

8

9

If you put the burden on an individual to look
at the parents' decision and see whether it is within the

10

range of acceptable decisions, that is a very different

11

thing than telling a court, as the courts were told in

12

these statutes, you decide what you think is in the best

13

interests of the child, and it's different, and it's

14

important for two different reasons.

15

The first is, when judges are making decisions,

16

when the State is making decisions in a best-interest

17

situation, it's very much different than the sorts of

18

decisions that most judges make under most other

19

circumstances, where they're deciding whether somebody

20

committed a crime or breached a contract.

think our constitutional rule for Federal purposes is that

to do that you have to show that no conceivable

circumstances could the statute be constitutionally

applied, and I take it you're taking that position.

MS. SMITH:

That's correct.
But the fact that there are all sorts

of cases where it wouldn't be constitutional I don't think

helps you, unless you can show that there are no cases in

before it had a statute unconstitutionally applied to

them, because there was no standard for either allowing

individuals to come into court, which individuals, when

they could come into court, or what had to be proven in

Yes.
And of course, if they'd accepted

that argument, we wouldn't be here.
MS. SMITH:

We wouldn't be here.

If they'd

accepted my argument that they should apply what they'd

7

been doing for 20 years with the State, there had to be

another action pending.

QUESTION:

Can you tell me, in a case something

10

like this, where the initial position of each side is

11

rejected, then the court makes some Solomon-like midway

12

compromise, in a case like that, would the parents --

13

assume younger parents faced with well- financed

14

grandparents -- ever be entitled to 100 percent of their

15

attorneys' fees, or do you have to be a prevailing party?

16

How does the attorneys' fees --

MS. SMITH:

You know, I can tell -- I can only

18

tell you what happens in a situ -- in most of these

19

situations, and that is, in the course of the Solomonic

20

division, the courts usually don't award fees.

21

I can certainly represent that to you, and I can

22

also tell you that in the two other cases that were

23

pending before the State supreme court, that in the other

24

case in which I represented the parent, that the court

situation than the parents -- than the grandparents.

QUESTION:

As I understand -- I understand the

dichotomy you draw between a harm-to-the-child standard

6

and a best-interests-of-the-child standard.

7

sure about your fallback standard, which is, you think it

8

would be okay if you applied not a best-interests-of-the-

child standard, but a standard to the effect that the

10

parent who has custody is not acting in the best interests

11

of the child.

12

from the judge deciding what is in the best interests of

13

the child?

14

You don't think that that's much different

I absolutely do, and I think Justice

Kennedy pointed out that it's really the flip side of

that.

talking about earlier, which is the second reason the best

18

interest standard doesn't work, and that is that when you

19

tell the State or a court to make a determination of

20

whether a parent is not acting in a child's best interest,

21

the focus of the decision is much different than asking a

court --

QUESTION:

1

I see.

You don't mean that what the

2

parent has decided to do is not in the child's best

3

interest.

You're applying a subjective standard?

4

MS. SMITH:

5

QUESTION:

No.
The court has to decide whether the

6

parent subjectively is trying to do what is best for the

7

child?

8

9

MS. SMITH:

It's -- the court has to look at

whether the consequences of the parent's decision will be

10

to harm the child.

11

not be acting in a child's best interest.

12

difference between asking in this case --

13

QUESTION:

In that circumstance, a parent would

Well, no, no.

It's the

I mean, you could not

14

harm the child, but still not be acting in the child's

15

best interests.

16

MS. SMITH:

Well, best interests I think has to

17

be defined in a way that you recognize that there are all

18

kinds of decisions that could be made about a child, and

19

we may disagree about what is in a -- I might think that

20

it's in the best interests of my child to go out for

21

football rather than to play the violin.

22

the outcome, as long as it's not harmful to the child, is

23

the parents, and if you're making decisions that go

24

towards that outcome, then somebody else shouldn't

25

substitute their decision.

If I think instead that it would be in the best

somebody else can step in and say, that is not a decision

that can be in the child's best interest.

QUESTION:

6

you're describing --

7

MS. SMITH:

It's no different from harm, the way

It is.

You're absolutely right, I

8

don't think it's any different from harm, and the reason

9

that it isn't is because it takes the focus away from the

10

State making the decision to whether the parent's decision

11

is within the range of acceptable decisions.

12

13

QUESTION:

May I ask you one last question here

about what you urged the Washington court to do?

14

MS. SMITH:

15

QUESTION:

Yes.
Did you ask the court to find the

16

statute then being used constitutionally overbroad,

17

applying the Federal standard for overbreadth --
