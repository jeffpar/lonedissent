ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY A. KARLE

16

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

17
18

MR. KARLE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

19

In 1994, the City of Erie enacted a content-

20

neutral blanket prohibition against public nudity.

21

ordinance was patterned after a similar ordinance which

22

was passed on by this Court in 1991 styled Barnes v. Glen

23

Theatre.

25

QUESTION:

we might hear you -- the other side.

MR. KARLE:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. KARLE:

Okay.
Now try it and speak up,

if you --

Our ordinance was challenged.

It

5

went through our intermediate trial level and intermediate

6

appellate system, and was passed on by our State supreme

7

court.

8

acknowledged that First Amendment protection was extended

9

to nude barroom dancing, as was found in Barnes v. Glen

10

Theatre.

11

Barnes.

12

On review, the Pennsylvania supreme court

It declined to find any other guidance in

Our State supreme court engaged in its own

13

independent analysis in rejecting our contention that the

14

ordinance was content-neutral.

15

The city challenged the ordinance --

16

QUESTION:

On content neutrality, the ordinance

17

at issue in Barnes, as I recall, prohibited public nudity

18

in general.

19

MR. KARLE:

20

QUESTION:

That's correct.
Now,

in this Erie ordinance, the

21

preamble to the ordinance notes that it was enacted for

22

the purpose of limiting a recent increase in nude live

23

entertainment.

MR. KARLE:

That's correct.

MR. KARLE:

QUESTION:

5

Justice O'Connor --- seems to have been addressed to a

specific problem, making it perhaps not content-neutral.
MR. KARLE:

Well, first of all, Your Honor, our

6

position is, reference to content does not make the

7

ordinance content-specific, or content-based.

8

intention of that preamble was to acknowledge the prior

9

holdings of this specific Court, which granted certain

The

10

limitations to this type of expressive conduct.

text of the ordinance is an ordinance of general

application.

It applies --

QUESTION:

Before we get too much into the

14

merits of this case, there's a contention that the case

15

may be moot.

Can you talk about mootness?

MR. KARLE:

QUESTION:

21

I -Is the -- is this business still in

operation, Pap's?
MR. KARLE:

As I understand it, the location

where it operated initially in 1994 no longer exists.
QUESTION:

But he's in business somewhere else?

22

As I understood it, he's out of business.

old, and --

MR. KARLE:

He's 70 years

the respondent, he claims to be out of business.

It's enough that he could get back

Well, anybody could get back into

expresses no intention of going back into it --

MR. KARLE:

QUESTION:

We've also -He sold the place.

He doesn't even

voluntary cessation by the defendant.

QUESTION:

MR. KARLE:

QUESTION:

Right.
That's correct.
Not voluntary cessation by the

plaintiff.

This is the plaintiff who says, you know, I

I couldn't care if they close me

I'm getting out of the rust belt.

MR. KARLE:

I'm

Justice Scalia, we also indicated

15

that there is a reasonable expectation that the same

16

controversy will occur between the same parties.

17

QUESTION:

Well now, what -- and what's the

basis for that statement?

evidence that this corporation is likely to resume the

sort of business it had?

MR. KARLE:

But there's no evidence one way or

the other on the subject?

7

Yes.

In our mind, what this case -Well, there is evidence.
He's finished.

He's said

He's out of there.

There is an affidavit, that's

correct.
QUESTION:

10

Right, and you don't have anything in

11

opposition to that, except you say, well, he could change

12

his mind.

13

MR. KARLE:

14

QUESTION:

That's correct.
What about closing the business?

15

Isn't that evidence, too?

16

something,

I mean, physically he closed

it's gone, he sold the property?

17

MR. KARLE:

18

QUESTION:

Yes, the property was sold.
All right.

So he has no property, he

19

says he's not going to do it any more, and you in response

20

to that say, what?

21

MR. KARLE:

You say nothing.

All right.

as we need to.

Why don't you return to the merits?

2

QUESTION:

Mr. Karle --

3

QUESTION:

May I ask just one further question

4

on it?

I was surprised that you weren't content with

5

saying, in response to the mootness suggestion, well,

6

fine, then we must wipe out the Pennsylvania supreme

7

court's decision, because you didn't get your crack at

8

appealing it.

9

How can the plaintiff say, I won this wonderful

10

victory, and now I'm going to go out of business, but I'm

11

going to preserve, immune from any further review, this

12

decision?

13

MR. KARLE:

I would be content if this Court

14

could order that this matter be remitted back to the State

15

supreme court and the order vacated.

16

understanding that --

QUESTION:

Are you sure we have the power to do

that?
MR. KARLE:

It was not my understanding that it

was -- this Court could do that, but --

QUESTION:

22

MR. KARLE:

23

It was not my

I'm not, either.
But if in its wisdom it could, I

would invite it to do so.

2

QUESTION:

That would change your mind on the

likelihood of the conduct recurring?

3

QUESTION:

4

(Laughter.)

5

QUESTION:

Quickly.

Mr. Karle, going back to the issue

6

that Justice O'Connor raised on whether this is content-

7

based, she asked you, as I recall, whether it was content-

8

based because it seems to be directed to the particular

9

category of nude dancing, not nudity generally.

As you

10

answer that, I wonder if you would consider a variation on

11

that question, which is what was the nub of what was

12

bothering me here as a seeming distinction from the

13

situation in Glen.

14

The statute by its -- the ordinance, rather, by

15

its terms seems to cover all nudity.

16

is, appears in the state of nudity, to describe what is

17

proscribed, but there is at the same time the preamble

18

that says, what we're really concerned with here is nude

19

dancing, and there is a representation in the record -- it

20

may have been from you.

21

that the statute is not going to be enforced against

22

legitimate theater productions like Equitus, Equus and Oh

23

Calcutta and so on.

24
25

The reference to it

I forget now -- to the effect

And so my variation on the question is this.

It

sounds as though perhaps facially you could say it covers

1

all nudity, but as applied it certainly is not covering

2

all nudity and distinctions are being made, insofar as I

3

can tell they are being made on the basis of content, on

4

the basis of the artistic quality of the production in

5

which the nudity occurs.

6

barroom dancing is not left alone.

7
8

9

Equus is left alone.

The

So on either Justice O'Connor's theory or my
theory, isn't a content-based distinction being made here?
MR. KARLE:

I would say no, Justice Souter.

10

preamble purely acknowledges the restrictions on nude

11

barroom dancing as enunciated by this Court in 1991.

12

sets the parameters of the ordinance, which this Court

13

held were constitutional.

14

QUESTION:

The

It

No, but the Barnes ordinance, the

15

assumption of our decision, or our decisions, I guess, of

16

those of us who would -- did uphold the Barnes ordinance,

17

the assumption was that it applied across the board, and

18

that, in fact, hadn't been challenged.

19

And I think -- I did not go back and reread my

20

opinion, but I read excerpts from it in the brief, and my

21

recollection is that I said, you know, if it turns out

22

that either an overbreadth challenge or some kind of a

23

challenge to the effect that it is not being enforced

24

across the board were made, that might be a different

25

case, and it sounds to me as though this is that different

1

case.
MR. KARLE:

2

And if I can address two points,

3

Justice, the first is, you pointed to some references in

4

the record which attribute statements to me which suggests

5

that, or state that this will not be enforced against

6

plays such as Hair, or Equus, or other theater

7

productions.
As I stand here now, before this Court, we are

8

9

standing on the face of this ordinance and it would be and

10

it could be applied to those types of productions.

11

reasons for those statements were concerns of the trial

12

court, and we tried to -QUESTION:

13

The

Yes, but they were concerns about

14

constitutionality, and I didn't remember whether it was

15

you or somebody, whoever was representing the city said --

16

MR. KARLE:

17

QUESTION:

18

No, that was me.
-- this is in fact the way we're

going to enforce it.

19

QUESTION:

Wasn't that the --

20

QUESTION:

Was that indeed the reason you would

21

allow Equus, because you think the Constitution requires

22

it?

23

MR. KARLE:

24

QUESTION:

25

Absolutely not, no.
Well,

if the Constitution did require

it, would you allow nudity in Equus?

MR. KARLE:

1

2

If the Constitution required it, the

plaintiff --

3

QUESTION:

And would that be unlawful subject

4

matter discrimination, if it's required by the

5

Constitution?

6

MR. KARLE:

7

QUESTION:

8

Pardon me, Justice?
Would that be unlawful subject matter

discrimination if it's required by the Constitution?

9

MR. KARLE:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. KARLE:

12

QUESTION:

Absolutely not, not -Of course not.
--

no.

So what you're saying is, you will

13

enforce this ordinance -- even if you said you would do

14

it, not enforce it for Equus, you're saying you will

15

enforce it to the extent the -- you will enforce it by its

16

terms to the extent the Constitution permits enforcement

17

by its terms.

18
19

MR. KARLE:

That's absolutely correct, Justice

Scalia.

I don't follow that --

QUESTION:

1

I'm not asking you why you made it.

2

MR. KARLE:

3

QUESTION:

No.
But it seems to me you did make a

4

representation on the record that this ordinance would not

5

be enforced against those two -- in those two situations.

MR. KARLE:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. KARLE:

9

QUESTION:

Your Honor -Is that correct?
That's -- that's correct.
Well, why should we not therefore

10

assume that you -- that the city will do exactly what you

11

said the city would do in the open court proceedings that

12

are part of this record?

13

MR. KARLE:

Well, first of all, judge, anything

14

I did was evidenced in the record, and the intent was to

15

try to get the trial court to give the statute a limiting

16

construction.

17

think I'm able to --

18

He seemed to be troubled by that.

QUESTION:

I don't

I don't really care what the -- I

19

don't really care what your intent was, it was strategic,

20

tactical, or what, but you did make a representation as to

21

the city's policy in enforcing this ordinance.

MR. KARLE:

And that would be beyond my

abilities as the City Solicitor --

trial court said the play Equus, which featured frontal

2

nudity, did appear in the City of Erie in October and

3

November 1994, after passage of the ordinance.

4

And I know there was discussion in the

5

respondent's brief that this was a conscious, deliberate

6

effort, but all we acknowledge is, the play was here, and

7

it wasn't enforced, and if I can go outside the record,

8

the reason is, no one complained.

9

QUESTION:

Yes, we do have some matters in our

social value, don't we, and some people might think Equus

has that.

MR. KARLE:

The State supreme court, although it

MR. KARLE:

They seem

We provided a number of analyses

that the supreme court could have utilized in order to

10

reconcile the various opinions in Barnes such that it

11

could construe our ordinance.
In a nutshell, what we are saying is, the State

12

13

supreme court ruled as it did because it couldn't

14

reconcile either the plurality or the concurring opinions

15

of the Barnes case.

16

Barnes, there aren't five votes to mandate a strict

17

scrutiny standard of review, so therefore the court was in

18

clear error in utilizing a strict scrutiny standard of

19

review in applying that review to the city's ordinance.

I suggest that, just looking at

We believe our ordinance withstands intermediate

20
21

scrutiny.

The Pennsylvania court acknowledged a purpose

in the ordinance.

Absent Pennsylvania supreme court's reliance on the

unstated motive for finding the ordinance

unconstitutional, which was drawn from the Barnes dissent,

MR. WESTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As is made clear throughout these proceedings

21

and by the remarks today, Erie's only concern in

22

considering, adopting, passing, and enforcing this

23

ordinance was the notion of nude entertainment.

24

language that Justice O'Connor quoted was accurate and

illustrative of exactly what Erie's purposes were.

Yes, it does, Your Honor, for a

QUESTION:

11

MR. WESTON:

What's the authority for that?
Well, in some sense Barnes itself

is authority for that, Mr. Chief Justice, because if the

only issue that was relevant in this kind of analysis was

14

what is the literal language of the legislation, Barnes

15

would have been a very brief series of opinions in

connection with the evaluation of the constitutionality of

17

that legislation.

But in fact there were three, as this Court

19

knows well, full opinions, each of which traced the

history of the statute, analyzed it, its impact, what

motivated the Framers, what didn't motivate, how it was

the possible creation of these so-called secondary

effects, as opposed -- and I don't mean to be splitting

But I think with respect to the ultimate

QUESTION:

5

I suppose it might depend on whether

the supreme court of Pennsylvania regards itself as being

7

bound in the same way we do about not deciding moot cases.

8

In a couple of cases that we've heard here, we have -Duremas, for example --we have simply dismissed an

appeal, feeling that we don't have the authority to vacate

11

a State court judgment the way we would a Federal court

MR. WESTON:

Yes, and I think -- but conversely,

14

Mr. Chief Justice, I thought that the reasoning that you

15

expressed in your concurring opinion in the Honig case

16

about, from the perspective of mootness, that once a case

17

had reached this Court and had been accepted for

jurisdiction, that perhaps the traditional mooting

criteria should drop off.

Do you agree that if there were secondary

effects here, such as Justice Souter described in his

5

opinion, that that would justify a total prohibition on

the activity, or that -- did that doctrine merely apply to

7

the location where the activity may take place?

8

think there's a distinction there, or not?
MR. WESTON:

9

Do you

Absolutely, Justice Stevens.

10

The -- this Court has never utilized secondary effects as

11

a justification for a total ban on protected activity.

12

Obviously, I have a familiarity with when secondary

effects first entered the lexicon in Young v. American

Mini Theaters and, of course, it was utilized then in the

15

analyses with which you and I are familiar.

Justice Souter's opinion in Barnes is inconsistent with

that submission.

Justice Souter's opinion sought, it seemed to

me, to utilize the notion of secondary effects which have

I think the point was -- whether it

was a wise or an unwise point I'll leave for the judgment

of my peers, but I think the point was that the O'Brien

5

case itself was a secondary effects case.

6

O'Brien before this, but my recollection is that the

7

concern with the burning of the draft card was that the

8

destruction of draft cards would make it difficult to

9

administer the draft laws.

10
11

I didn't reread

It was not a sort of

talismanic injury to the draft card itself.
So that in fact the occasion for the O'Brien

12

holding was to look ahead to what this kind of act is

13

going to threaten for the future throughout a system, and

14

it may or may not be wise to extend the kind of sexual

secondary effects into the O'Brien rationale.

it was, but I'm willing to hear argument on it, certainly,

from those who disagree.

MR. WESTON:

Justice Souter, I think that in

fact, with all respect, O'Brien was absolutely not a

secondary effects case, because the nature of the harm

3

the specific new legislation.
The Chief Justice was very, very clear at the

time that -- and Your Honor, Justice Souter, you may

recall that in O'Brien there had been new legislation

adopted which is what had been, what had triggered the

argument, so I'll take your word with -MR. WESTON:

11

But the prior legislation had

12

required that all registrants maintain in their possession

13

their draft card and their classification certificate.

14

The new legislation banned the destruction of the card and

15

the certificate, and the expression of the Court in

16

upholding the legislation was simply that it was very

17

important to the selective service that everybody maintain

18

in their possession a draft card and the classification,

19

so that what was at issue in O'Brien was not secondary at

all, but absolutely and primary effect, and --

QUESTION:

Assuming that the primary-secondary-

2

distinction can be made here on viewing O'Brien as you've

3

just described it, why should that make a difference?

4

may make a difference in proof of effect, in proof of

5

harm, but why should that make a difference in principle?

6

MR. WESTON:

It

Well, the primary reason is, is

7

that to the extent that there is an assertion that some

8

secondary or tertiary or far distant activity is what is

9

the source of concern to Government, and that on that

10

basis there's going to be a dramatic restriction or

11

banning, total banning of expression, it simply is too far

12

removed from the nature of the expression which is

13

protected, or which we seek to protect under the First

14

Amendment and our general approaches to it.

15

QUESTION:

So that a secondary effect, almost by

16

definition, is something that does not rise to the level

17

of importance to justify it.

18

MR. WESTON:

Yes.

That -I think yes.

I think that

19

would be exactly the point, whether because it simply

20

isn't important enough, whether it simply isn't linked

21

enough to justify terminating or banning expression, or

22

whether it simply doesn't give us enough of an opportunity

23

to evaluate the potential pretextual application of an

asserted justification for silencing unpopular expression.

that legislation to be challenged in the crucible of

says, someone walking down the Main Street of Erie in the

Well, I suggest that it's a charade

in this sense.

where there's legislation that either inevitably is going

to affect vast quantities of expression, or where on its

No, it's a different question, which

is, I don't see quite how to proceed.

The first

assumption would be -- it's an assumption that there are

some kinds of nude dancing that are not expressive at all,

rather, they're forms, let's say, of prostitution, or

sexual behavior, and second, that maybe that's what

notion that there might be nude dancing which involves

prostitution, or --

17

QUESTION:

I don't mean it involves

prostitution.

I mean, it is no more related to expression

than turning a mouse loose in a house with an intent to

frighten someone.

Is that your view?

Or, it could be, no, there is some, but it's
mixed up with other.
MR. WESTON:

What is your view?
Our view is that under this

facial challenge to this, this ordinance does not regulate

burn a flag, although it is a form of expression, the
