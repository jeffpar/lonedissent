CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in No. 98-1036, Illinois v. William Wardlow.
Mr. Devine.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. DEVINE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. DEVINE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
On September 9th, 1995, when William Wardlow

11

looked at Officer Nolan and took flight, the officer had

12

reason to believe that there was a problem.

13

and stopped Wardlow to investigate and discovered a loaded

14

gun in his possession.

15

He pursued

The three key factors in this brief statement

16

are flight from a clearly identified police officer

17

without provocation.

18

suspicion supporting a Terry stop.

These factors provided reasonable

19

At the core of this case --

20

QUESTION:

When you said he had reasonable cause

21

to believe there was a problem, you mean that he had

22

reason to believe that crime was afoot.

23

MR. DEVINE:

Yes, Your Honor.

Is that the test?
The reasonable

24

police officer had, under these circumstances, reasonable

25

suspicion to believe that crime was afoot.

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. DEVINE:

What crime?
Throughout the history of this

3

country,

flight has been considered by the courts and by

4

commentators as inherently suspicious.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. DEVINE:

Of what?
It is not -- it is not required,

7

Your Honor, â–  that the officer have reasonable suspicion of

8

a particular crime.
in LaFave.

This was commented on in Anderson and

If the officer has reasonable suspicion to

10

believe that criminal activity may be afoot, as this Court

11

has noted, there may be innocent behavior, but the

12

officer, the reasonable officer, can stop briefly to

13

determine whether his suspicions are justified or not.

14

QUESTION:

Does he have to have some rough idea

15

of what kind of crime?

16

I take it.

17

MR. DEVINE:

18

QUESTION:

1

MR. DEVINE:

I mean,

it wasn't money laundering

No, Your Honor.

And --

What was it?
-- it is our submission that if the

20

officer has reasonable suspicion that there may be some

21

type of criminal activity -- and flight has historically

22

been related to criminal activity, as Mr. Burrill noted in

23

his commentary back in the 1860's, that flight for a

24

burglar, an arsonist, a robber is common, and that in fact

25

if someone committed one of these acts, that it is so

1

natural to flee that if an individual did not, he would be

2

considered mentally deficient.
QUESTION:

3

I suppose if a policeman sees

4

somebody with a smoking rifle, he wouldn't exactly know

5

what precise crime was -- was probable or possible either.

6

The man might have killed somebody or he might have shot a

7

bald eagle.

MR. DEVINE:

8

9

You really wouldn't know which, would you?
You would not, Your Honor.

In

addition, going back to Terry, the case which is the

10

seminal case on this issue, the activity that the officer

11

noted was as consistent with innocent behavior as with

12

what the officer suspected, namely that the individuals

13

walking around were casing the joint preparing to rob a

14

department store.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. --

16

QUESTION:

There is some reference in the

17

Illinois court opinions to the fact that this was a high

18

crime neighborhood.
MR. DEVINE:

19

Does that bear on your calculus?
Mr. Chief Justice, we are proposing

20

that a rule be adopted that is not limited to high crime

21

areas.

22

suspicious that when you have unprovoked flight from an

23

identified police officer, that wherever it takes place,

24

it provides the reasonable suspicion necessary.

25

We believe that the flight is so inherently

Well, you want some per se rule, it

sounds like, rather than what we have normally done on a

2

Terry stop, which is inquire whether there is reasonable

3

suspicion based on the totality of the circumstances.

4

reject that as the test?

5

MR. DEVINE:

No, Your Honor.

You

This, in fact,

6

comports with totality of the circumstances.

7

do say is when these three factors are involved, they are

8

sufficiently important and sufficiently focused that they

9

provide and should provide the officer with a reasonable

10

But what we

suspicion.
QUESTION:

11

But in -- in -- in this case, there

12

may well be special circumstances that would enter the

13

mix.

14

officers thought was the location for a lot of drug

15

trafficking.

16

where the -- where the person who ran had seen that it was

17

a police officer following that person, and so that's

18

different from a flight where the person doesn't even know

19

there's a police officer --

The officer was going to a building that the

20
21

And presumably we have circumstances here

MR. DEVINE:

Well, no, Your Honor, there are

three --

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. DEVINE:

-- there.
There are three factors that we

24

propose be part of the rule:

25

that it's from a clearly identifiable police officer; and

one, the flight; second,

1

thirdly, that it's without provocation.

We understand

2

that just flight in a vacuum doesn't give us the reason to

3

say that there's reasonable suspicion, but when the three

4

factors are combined, we believe that that is -- that is

5

the case.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. --

7

QUESTION:

Would be the same rule if, say, the

8

-- the person who's stopped was wearing jogging shoes and

9

sweat pants and a sweatshirt and carrying a basketball?

10

MR. DEVINE:

Your Honor, it would fit in, in

11

that the reasonable police officer, the standard that the

12

Court uses, would have to conclude that the flight was in

13

response to his presence and without provocation.

14

whatever the garb of the individual, if he looks at the

15

police officer, and then takes off, that creates the

16

reasonable suspicion.

17

QUESTION:

So,

What -- what if he had seen him

18

running, then he stopped for a while, then he saw the

19

police officer, and he started running again?

20

still -- that would still apply, wouldn't it?

21

MR. DEVINE:

No, Your Honor.

That would

I would say in

22

that case if the individual is running in the direction,

23

glances at the police officer, and continues on.

24
25

QUESTION:

No.

He stops.

He had stopped and he

was catching his breath and then he looked up and saw the

1

police officer and took off.
MR. DEVINE:

2

I would say that that's ambiguous

3

behavior that would fall within the totality of

4

circumstances rather than within the rule we're proposing,

5

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

6

Mr. Devine, the -- let me tell you

7

the difficulty that I have with your proposal.

You -- you

8

mentioned a moment ago, quite correctly, that under any
reasonable suspicion rule, some innocent people are going

10

to be stopped or are liable to be stopped under that rule,

11

and we accept that.

12

that premise.

13

That's -- Terry -- Terry starts on

The -- the trouble is how high is the risk that

14

-- that innocents are going to be stopped or -- or how

15

many innocents are going to be stopped in relation to the

16

-- to the whole?

17

question.

18

I'd like you to comment on it -- is that it seems to me

1

that if we accept your premises, where in the high crime

20

area a clearly identified police officer arrives -- and in

21

fact, in this case arrived as -- I guess in a convoy of -

22

- of four cars -- it seems to me that anyone in his right

23

mind is going to want to get out of the way fast.

24

were standing on that corner, I don't know whether I would

25

run or duck into a -- an alleyway or what, but I would

That -- that seems to me the tough

And the reason it's a tough question here --

If I

1

want to get out of the way.
And therefore, it seems to me, on your premise,

2

3

there are going to be a substantial number of quite

4

innocent people who, recognizing the spot they are in, are

5

going to go on and get just as far away from the police

6

and any shoot-out or whatnot that may occur as they

7

possibly can.

8

many innocent people getting picked up on your rule.

9

do you say to that?

And it raises the specter of simply too

MR. DEVINE:

10

What

Well, Your Honor, I would again

11

note that flight, going back to the time of the Framers,

12

has been considered suspicious behavior, but looking at

13

the balancing this Court does in analyzing the

14

reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment, we look at the

15

governmental interest.

16

a police officer who's on the scene, sees an individual

17

look at him, and take flight.

18

have the ability to further investigate.

19

officer does not have any ability to find out what is

20

going on.
QUESTION:

21

Here the governmental interest is

The police officer does not
The police

Yes, but he may have the ability to

22

note a number of other facts besides the one that you

23

mentioned, and some of them have come up on the bench

I mean, there -- there are lots of little

3

details that come into a totality of the circumstances

4

test that might make,

5

perfectly good Terry stop, but it gives one pause when you

6

ask us, number one, to depart from totality, number two,

7

to come up with a bright line rule in which there's at

8

least a substantial risk of a lot of innocent people being

9

-- being caught.

for example, the stop in this case a

MR. DEVINE:

10

Your Honor,

I -- I would submit an

11

alternative thought, namely that -- that flight is such

12

inherently aberrant behavior that it does create the

13

reasonable suspicion --

14

QUESTION:

Yes, but we don't have a rule that

15

says anytime anyone flees from the police, there is --

there is sufficient suspicion for a Terry stop.

it's darned good evidence.

MR. DEVINE:

I know some of the Justices may

that -- that normally when the police show up, all of the

neighbors run away?

opposite, that the police have to keep the crowd back.

I -- my experience has been just the

I --

MR. DEVINE:

16

Certainly in -- in my experience, Your Honor,

I certainly -Pardon me, Your Honor.

17

flight from the arrival of police officers, as they go

about the duty -- about their duties, is not a common

19

experience.

20

QUESTION:

But your experience --

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Devine, there's been a lot of

22

talk about my experience, your experience.

Is there any

23

evidence, apart from intuition, that people who have

24

something to hide run?

25

about how many innocent people are in jeopardy.

Justice Souter asked the question

11

1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

Is there

1

any empirical evidence at all to back up this intuition

2

that people don't run unless they have something to hide?
MR. DEVINE:

3

Well, Your Honor, we have the

4

entire history of this country with the commentators and

5

the cases that have -QUESTION:

6

7

You have this case for starters.

Right?
MR. DEVINE:

8

Well, absolutely, Your Honor.

You

have after the stop, a weapon with five live rounds in it
10

was found on Mr. Wardlow.
QUESTION:

11

Well, we have this case, but how many

12

on the other side where this practice is followed?

13

many innocent people get stopped because they sped away?

14

MR. DEVINE:

How

Well, again, Your Honor, based on

15

my -- my view of it as a prosecutor for a number of years,

16

I don't believe it occurs that often.

talking about -QUESTION:

But what we are

But we don't have any empirical

studies of this, do we?

We don't have any to submit, Your

Honor.

cases, at least, involve flight after an accusation, after

2

a charge.
MR. DEVINE:

Some did, Your Honor, but Burrill

3

in his commentaries, referring to the common law, clearly-

4

referred to flight from the scene and how natural it was

5

for criminals to flee.

6

In addition, Wigmore, that was cited by -- who

7

was cited by respondent, also talks as the flight being

8

the evidential matter that we look at.
QUESTION:

Mr. Devine, do we have any empirical

10

studies about -- empirical studies about how often, when

11

there's been somebody killed and somebody nearby has blood

12

on his hands, that person is likely to have been involved

13

in the killing?

14
15
16
17
18

Are there any empirical studies on that?

MR. DEVINE:

No, I'm not aware of any empirical

studies, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Do you think that would justify a

Terry stop?
QUESTION:

What do you -- what do you say about

1

the argument that -- well, there are some neighborhoods,

20

high crime neighborhoods in particular, where people are

21

afraid of the police?

22

randomly and search them, and there can be a racial

23

element involved, a white policeman in a black

24

neighborhood.

25

frightened of the police and they run away.

Maybe the police just stop people

Say, that in that neighborhood, people are

(800) FOR DEPO

They just

1

don't want to get involved.
MR. DEVINE:

2

Well, Your Honor, I would first

3

note that in many of those same neighborhoods, the victims

4

are the ones who are concerned about crime being solved.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. DEVINE:

7

QUESTION:

8

That's -- I understand that.
But -I'm saying -- I'm saying what -- what

is your response to that argument?
MR. DEVINE:

9

My response is that -- that since

10

Terry, when the Court discussed that issue, this Court has

11

said that under the Fourth Amendment we apply a colorblind

12

test.

13

and if those issues are there, application of sanctions

14

under the Fourth Amendment isn't going to resolve them.

15

They should be handled, as this Court has said, as

16

recently as Wren, either by equal protection claims or

17

section 1983 claims or administrative charges within the

18

particular police department.

We look at the balancing outside of those issues,

19

I would submit, Your Honor, that if we start to

20

classify when we can do a Fourth Amendment stop, based on

21

Terry, or arrest based on probable cause, considering what

22

the race of the police officer is, the race of the

23

individual that is involved, the Fourth Amendment will be

24

unworkable and will prevent the police officers from doing

25

the job that we want them to do.

2

That's why we believe a bright line rule is
appropriate here.

3

QUESTION:

So, in your --

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Devine, your -- your question

5

presented is whether a person's sudden and -- in petition

6

for certiorari, whether a person's sudden and unprovoked

7

flight from a clearly identifiable police officer who is

8

patrolling a high crime area is sufficiently suspicious to

9

justify a temporary investigatory stop pursuant to Terry

10

against Ohio.

11

request for a bright line rule, as saying do these

12

circumstances come -- satisfy the Terry case, which maybe

13

it's another way of saying the same thing.

14

don't read that necessarily as saying that you believe

15

that every time these factors coalesce, there will be a

16

cause for a Terry stop.

17

That doesn't sound to me so much like a

MR. DEVINE:

But I -- I

Well, Your Honor, we do submit that

18

-- and the high crime area is in the cert petition, but we

19

submit that the three factors that we've identified,

20

flight without provocation from a clearly identified

21

police officer -- you reach a point where you have

22

reasonable suspicion with those factors.

23

And we believe it is important that this Court

24

speak clearly on this because a police officer does have

25

to make an instantaneous decision -15

QUESTION:

1

May I ask on your bright line rule?

2

Would it apply to someone driving in car who sees an

3

officer in the rear window and then decides to turn off

4

because he's not sure he's going to be stopped?
MR. DEVINE:

5

If it -- if it is not identified as

6

flight from the standpoint of the reasonable police

7

officer -QUESTION:

8

9

No, it is.

He -- that's exactly the

--he just doesn't want to take the chance on being

10

stopped, so he tries to get away, but without -- without

11

evading the speed limit.
MR. DEVINE:

12

Well, Your Honor, we would --we

13

have made a point of differing -- distinguishing avoidance

14

from flight.

15

walking away do not constitute flight.

16

instance, if the individual in the car sped off after

17

observing a police officer, we would say that is flight

18

without provocation that would justify the Terry stop.

19

Turning one's gaze, crossing the street,

QUESTION:

Certainly in that

Well, how does provocation -- I know

20

the genesis of the phrase, but why is provocation

21

important?

22

23

And, incidentally, why wasn't this provocation
when four cars come swooping down?

24

MR. DEVINE:

25

QUESTION:

Well, provocation -What does provocation add to the mix?

1

MR. DEVINE:

If the police officer, for example,

2

came up and threatened an individual and they ran away,

3

that would not be flight that would fall within the

4

1

MR. STEWART:

2

3

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

4

It's certainly true, as respondent and his amici

5

point out, that individuals may, on some occasions, have

6

innocent motives for fleeing the police.

7

of a Terry stop is not to apprehend individuals who are

8

known to be guilty of criminal offenses; rather, it's to

9

provide a means by which police may resolve ambiguities in

10

situations where they have reasonable -- reason to suspect

11

criminal activity, but lack probable cause to make an

12

arrest.

13

officers will ordinarily correlate sufficiently with

14

likely involvement in criminal activity.

But the purpose

21

MR. STEWART:

I think we -- we believe you

22

should look at the totality of the circumstances.

I think

23

in the end our position is not significantly different in

25

different terminology.

Our view is that ordinarily when

an individual flees at the sight of an identifiable police

2

officer, under circumstances in which the officer

3

reasonably infers that the individual is running because

4

of the officer's presence, rather than for some other

5

reason, ordinarily that would raise a sufficient inference

6

of guilt to justify a Terry stop.

7

The question of provocation has --

QUESTION:

9

Are you saying that there's -- is

there a right of an individual to go their own way even

10

though there's a police officer known to be on the scene?

11

Can you walk away rapidly?

12

anything to do with them?

MR. STEWART:

Can you just not want to have

I think there -- there is a --

14

there is no right to avoid police observation or police

15

contact, that is the Court -- in public areas.

16

Now, there is a liberty interest in freedom of

1

things that is distinctive about flight is that in many

2

cases it is likely to connote a panicked reaction, an

3

emotional reaction to the police presence.

4

panic is in our view more likely to signal consciousness

5

of guilt than is an -- an emphatic, salty expression of

6

disdain for the police.

7
8

And -- and

The second -- the second, and perhaps the -- the
most fundamental difference is that flight expresses the
desire not simply to refuse cooperation with the police,

10

but to be free from any form of police observation or

11

scrutiny. And that's really one of the reasons that we

12

think the purposes of the Terry stop are particularly

13

implicated in this situation; that is, the fundamental

14

purpose of the Terry stop is to allow the police briefly

15

to freeze the status quo while they undertake further

16

inquiry to determine whether there --

17

QUESTION:

If you're going to frisk the person,

18

doesn't the policeman have to have at least some notion of

what kind of a crime this person might have committed.

Justice Harlan said in Terry that to frisk him, you'd have

21

to have -- that the reason for the stop is an articulable

22

suspicion of a crime of violence.

the ground for frisking him?

frisking him is, first, the belief that he may be -- the

2

ground for frisking him is to protect the officer's safety

3

while the stop is taking place.

4

QUESTION:

You disagree with Justice Harlan's

5

articulation of the standard.
MR. STEWART:

6

Well, I think what Justice Harlan

7

was saying -- I don't know that Justice Harlan had in mind

8

the situation in which police had an articulable basis for

9

suspecting criminal activity but no particular crime in

mind.
QUESTION:

Well, that -- that was not the view

of the majority in Terry.

separately, did he not?

Justice Harlan wrote

14

MR. STEWART:

15

And in terms of the principles, the rationale

That -- that's correct.

16

underlying the Court's Terry stop jurisprudence, I don't

17

think there is any basis for saying that police have to be

18

concerned with a particular crime.

19

Terry stop is to resolve ambiguities, and in United States

20

1

part of the reason that we think flight is extraordinary

2

again is that it denotes a desire not simply to refuse

3

cooperation, but to avoid all forms of police scrutiny.

4

And for that reason, in our view, it's a particularly

appropriate occasion for a Terry stop.

emphasizing a case-by-case, fact-specific nature on a

2

reasonable inquiry.

3

In response to petitioner's argument with --

4

with the three tests, the reason flight alone or flight

5

from a police officer without provocation cannot in every

6

situation constitute a per se rule, is if someone doesn't

7

want to speak with the police, sees them coming, and

8

walks, skips, jumps, gets on his bike, or get in a car, he

9

would be subjected under this per se rule to a Terry stop,

10

and for no other reason than he didn't want to speak with

11

the police officers.

you see four police cars and eight police officers

aberrant behavior.

Others might flee so that they -- they

And again, in this case, it makes perfect sense
