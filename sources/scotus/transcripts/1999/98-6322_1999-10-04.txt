Mr. Pescetta.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL PESCETTA
ON BEHALF OF Tiffi PETITIONER
MR. PESCETTA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Although this case also arises in the thicket of
habeas proceedings, I think the question that this Court
posed on certiorari can be answered by answering two
conunon-sense questions. One is, can we have a dismissal
without prejudice, that is, a dismissal with some
prejudice? Two, can we apply a resjudicata rule when
there has been no previous adjudication in the matter?
Can we have res judicata without judicata?
I submit that the common-sense answers to both
of those questions are no, we can't, and that those
answers control the disposition of this case.
QUESTION: If you're right, Mr. Pescetta, would
it be possible for a habeas corpus applicant to have his
first petition dismissed because it contained unex.hausted
claims and then come back the second time and have a bunch
of new claims, as I think your client did here, and simply

have them considered, or perhaps be dismissed as
unexhausted, and keep going that way?
MR. PESCETTA: In theory, yes, Your Honor, but
as we pointed out in our briefing, there are other ways to
control that problem if it becomes a problem in the case.
The conditional QUESTION: What are they?
MR. PESCETTA: The conditional dismissal order
or practice that can be used under Rule 41 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure can control that if a
petitioner -- if a Federal district judge believes that
there is a problem with what the State refers to in this
case as the ping-pong effect of going back and forth from
State to Federal court by filing repeated unexhausted
petitions.
That can be controlled by a district court
saying, this is your last chance. We're going to issue an
order that dismisses you without prejudice but, as a
condition of that order, when you come back we will
entertain only your exhausted claims. That is a technique
that has been used successfuJJy in capital cases in the
District of Nevada QUESTION: Well, that's not what this judge did.
Just - this judge just dismissed in compliance with Rose
for exhaustion.

MR. PESCETIA: Yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION: And didn't go on to speculate that
the prisoner might come back with new unexhausted claims,
right?
MR. PESCETIA: That's true, Your Honor, and that
may not occur.
QUESTION: So what does the judge do when the
judge hasn't speculated in advance about this possibility?
MR. PESCETIA: I -QUESTION: So back the prisoner comes with, yes,
some that are exhausted now, but adding on some new,
unexhausted claims.
MR. PESCETIA: But I think, Your Honor, that's a
decision that the judge can make in the district judge's
discretion when the district judge perceives that that is
a problem.
QUESTION: Well, in light of Rose v. Lundy, what
does the judge do, faced with the situation that happened
here -MR. PESCETIA: I think QUESTION: - with the unexhausted claims?
MR. PESCETTA: I think the district judge in
this case had followed what we believe to be the law, that
is that the prior dismissal without prejudice does not
make this petition a second or successive petition.

QUESTION: As to the exhausted claims.

MR. PESCEITA: As to any claims, Your Honor,

( 6 l unexhausted claims -(7 l
MR. PESCEITA: The judge -(al
QUESTION: - when it comes back?
( 9)
MR. PESCEITA: Excuse me, Your Honor. The judge
( 1 o l can issue an order dismissing the case without prejudice,
( 11 l but directing that this is the petitioner's last
( 12) opportunity to exhaust, and that when he returns to
( 13) Federal court, the Federal court will only address
( 14 l unexhausted claims, and that order could be enforced under
( 15 l Rule 41 (b).
( 16)
QUESTION: Well, what is the authority to issue
( 1 7 l that order?
t 1a l
MR. PESCEITA: Rule 41(a). A conditional
( 19) dismissal without prejudice is clearly allowed by the
( 2 o) Federal rules, and in fact -( 21)
QUESTION: Well, it's allowed by the rules, but
( 2 2 ) the problem I have with the argument is that it seems to
( 2 3 l me that the strongest point in your favor is that we have
( 2 4 ) never - I think we have never viewed as the term second
( 2 5 ) or successive as a term to refer to a case which is

brought when the preceding history includes nothing but a
dismissal without prejudice, so that as a matter of law -your strongest argument is, as a matter of law, assuming
that Congress uses the terms the way this Court had been
using these terms of art, the statute cannot possibly mean
that this would be a second or successive petition.
If that is the case, it seems to me that your
argument here is a weak one, because if ultimately what
the court does on the first round is dismiss without
prejudice, it can put all the caveats in that it wants to,
you know, do it all this time, only one bite of the apple
and so on. When they get back in front of the court
again, it would still not be a second or successive
petition.
tvffi.. PESCEITA: That's correct, Your Honor, but
then it would be subject to a dismissal with prejudice
under Rule 41 (b) by the court enforcing its previous order
in that case -QUESTION: But you -tvffi.. PESCEITA: -- and that's the distinction -excuse me, Your Honor.
QUESTION: It seems to me you haven't given us a
reason, or a source of authority for the district court to
make a conditional dismissal like that. I mean, Rule 41
certainly doesn't give the district court authority to

enter any sort of an order conditioning dismissal that he
pleases, does it?
}JR. PESCETIA: Certainly it's -- the power is
not unlimited, but a reasonable condition on an order of
dismissal is always upheld.
Now, the concern that we are faced here is that
there are two parallel tracks of jurisprudence. One is
Rule 9(b), the second 2244(b), which enact what this Court
has consistently and uniformly referred to as a res
judicata rule. This was clearly stated in the
congressional materials and reports in the enactment in
1966 of section 2244. It was emphasized -QUESTION: Mr. Pescetta, I follow that with
respect to the first clause of 9(b), where there was a
prior determination on the merits, but the second clause
says, if new and different grounds, that is, unadjudicated
grounds, are alleged, the judge finds that the failure to
assert those grounds in a prior petition constituted an
newuse.
That seems to me clearly to contemplate grounds
that were not adjudicated, new and different grounds, and
then says, judge, you look at the particular case, and if
you find that the failure to bring those up earlier
constituted an abuse, then you toss it out.
}JR. PESCETIA: Yes, Your Honor. That's part of

the res j udicata component of the rule. Our position is
that a second or a successive petition in the first
sentence of Rule 9(b) means what this Court has always
taken it to mean. That is, a petition that's filed after
a previous petition has been adjudicated on the merits in
some fonn.
The remainder of that rule referred to different
kinds of situations that can arise in a second or a
successive petition, and if you look at the parallel
provisions in section 2244(b) and fonner section 2244(b),
it doesn't use the tenn, second or successive petition.
It says, when after an evidentiary hearing on
the merits -- and this is on page 2 of our brief, of the
appendix to our brief. When, after an evidentiary hearing
on the merits of a material factual issue, or after a
hearing on the merits of an issue of law, a person in
custody is - pursuant to a judgment of a State court has
been denied by a court of the United States. That is
boiled down, I submit, in Rule 9(b) into a second or a
successive petition.
The rest of 2244(b) tracks closely the rest of
Rule 9(b), so I think those rules have to be hannonized.
Now, I think we also QUESTION: But would you agree with me that if
you just read, if new and different grounds are alleged,

the judge find that the failure to assert those earlier
constituted an abuse of - abuse of the writ. That sounds
like new, unadjudicated grounds. The judge finds in a
particular case that it's an abuse of the writ.
Now, I thought that your argument was, or should
have been, that here the judge shouldn't make such a
finding because all of the new grounds were asserted the
very first time that this petitioner was represented by
counsel. Isn't it true that those new grounds were
asserted by counsel in Federal court the second time?
lvffi. PESCETIA: The majority of them, yes, but
our position is that that second clause that Your Honor
just read is limited by the beginning of the rule which
narrows its application to a second or successive
petition, so that you don't have any application of Rule
9(b) unless QUESTION: So if I read it the way I - it seems
is the literal meaning of new and different grounds, then
you lose? You were saying that this is a res judicata
rule. If something \Vasn't adjudicated lvffi. PESCETIA : It's a res judicata rule which
covers both adjudicated and unadjudicated claims as long
as there is a previous petition that was decided on the
merits. That's what res judicata is, of course, all
about.

QUESTION: Well, I don't understand why we have
to go that far. I mean, I would think your position could
be narrower, which is just that a dismissal without
prejudice to permit exhaustion doesn't count as a first
petition. I mean, that's all you need to say for your
purposes. I don't know why you have to go on with this,
has to be adjudicated on the merits argument.
MR. PESCETIA: You've said it better than I,
Your Honor, and I can only agree with you. The problem

QUESTION: Well, let me ask you this. Why
doesn't 2253 of AEDPA apply, that there has to be a
certificate of appealability for you to get here at all,
and there never was in this case. Is that jurisdictional?
MR. PESCETIA: I submit, Your Honor, the AEDPA
does not apply.
QUESTION: Why?
MR. PESCETIA: Because under Lindh v. Murphy,
this Court held that the Chapter 153 amendments that were
enacted by AEDPA do not apply retroactively. Those
provisions of section 2253, and of Federal Rule of
Appellate Procedure 22, are part of the Chapter 153
amendments to - that were enacted by AEDPA. Therefore,
if this Court adheres to Lindh, in which it said the
provisions of that chapter do not apply retroactively,

there's no question that Mr. Slack's petition was filed
before AEDPA was enacted QUESTION: Was that a holding or a dictum?
MR. PESCETTA: - and therefore it doesn't
apply.
QUESTION: Was that a holding or a dictum as to
all the provisions of 153?
MR. PESCETTA : I believe that the - I believe
that it would be dictum outside the particular facts of
that case. Nonetheless, I think the same policies that
apply, that were applied in Lindh by this Court, apply
here. When the Congress wanted to eliminate a certain
kind of review, it did so. It said so explicitly. There
is nothing in AEDP A that remotely suggests the kind of
radical change that the amici suggest was worked by
section 2253.
QUESTION: Well, you have -you had here
neither a CPC nor a COA, which is what the prior law would
require, right?
MR. PESCETTA: Yes. We applied for a
certificate of probable cause. It was denied by the trial
court, it was denied by the Ninth Circuit, and we are here
under Hohn v. United States.
QUESTION: But under the QUESTION: Well -

QUESTION: Under the prior law before section
15 3, wouldn't you have had to obtain a certificate of
appealability?
MR. PESCEITA : No, Your Honor. That - the
prior law, pre-AEDPA, called it a certificate of probable
cause for appeal.
QUESTION:
sorry, I got the two reversed.
And you were denied that.
MR. PESCEITA: And we were denied that, and we
were denied that sua sponte by the court of appeals .
QUESTION: So whether you rely on pre-AEDPA or
post-AEDPA, it seems to me you don't have what's necessary
to get here.

rm

MR. PESCETIA: On the contrary, Your Honor, we
are here under Hohn v. United States.
QUESTION: Well, you're saying we can review the
denial of a certificate of probable cause. Isn't that
what you're saying?
MR. PESCETIA: That's what I understand Hohn
means.
QUESTION: Whereas presumably we cannot review
post-AEDPA denial of a COA.
MR. PESCETIA: I don't think -QUESTION: You don't have to take a position on
that. All you have to take a position on is that in the

Page 14
( 1) pre-AEDP A law we could decide ourselves whether there
( 2 ) should have been a certificate of probable cause granted
( 3 ) and go ahead and review it.
(4 l
:tvffi. PESCEITA : Yes.
( 5)
QUESTION: That's your position.
(6 l

(7 l
QUESTION: But (a)
QUESTION: Well, but that has some shortcoming,
( 9 l it seems to me. At least one court of appeals has held
1 o l that AEDPA's COA requirements apply where the petition was
11 l filed pre-AEDPA but dismissed post-AEDPA.
12 l
MR. PESCEITA: Well, the difficulty there, Your
13 l Honor, is it doesn't talce Hohn into consideration , I don't
14) think, because it is part of the section 153 amendments,
·15 l and that's what gets us here.
: 16 l
QUESTION: Well :17 l
QUESTION: But Hohn described what a case was,
11 a l and I think that does not help you.
(19)
MR. PESCEITA: I disagree, Your Honor. An
( 2 o l application for a certificate of appealability to the
( 21 l court of appeals is for these purposes, I believe, no
( 2 2 l different from an application for a certificate or
( 2 3 l probable cause. In detail it may be different.

appealability is a separate case in and of itself, and
here that would make you post-AEDPA, so I don't see why
that isn't a jurisdictional barrier in this case.
:MR. PESCETIA: I think, Your Honor, having
applied, properly applied, we believe, for a certificate
of probable cause in the district court, and having been
denied it, the same application for a certificate of
probable cause, whether it is an application for a
certificate of probable cause or an application for a
certificate of appealability, and the Seventh Circuit has
held that the fact that you call it the wrong thing
doesn't affect the court's jurisdiction, that invests the
court of appeals with jurisdiction in the same way under
AEDPA that it did under pre-AEDPA law.
QUESTION: Even if there's jurisdiction, you
have difficulty on the merits, don't you, since you never
alleged a constitutional violation.
:MR. PESCETIA: Well, the underlying
constitutional violations are the claims of the petition
that are the denials of the constitutional right. There
is no case that has ever suggested in any way, shape, or
form that a procedural issue that covers an underlying
substantive claim can't be addressed under a certificate
of appealability or a certificate of probable cause. That
language, denial of a Federal right, or, under AEDPA,

Page 16

underlying claim.
I mean, in Barefoot v. Estelle, where some of
this language came from originally, the question at issue
there was a stay, and the standard for a stay was the
substantiality of the underlying claim that entitles you
to the stay.
QUESTION: But AEDPA has modified what you can
raise. You know, it says denial by constitutional rights,
whereas pre-AEDPA law was a Federal right, which could be
statutory.
1v1R. PESCETTA: But I submit, Your Honor, that
that still refers to the underlying claim. Congress could
have narrowed the class of claims to constitutional claims
that it would allow to be reviewed on the merits, but that
doesn't mean that the procedural questions that are
involved in determination of those issues could never be
reached by any appellate court.
What that would mean is that the Federal courts
of appeals would be utterly powerless to police the
activities of the district courts in habeas cases on
procedural issues, and the only case that has addressed an
argument like that that was cited by amici is Trevino v.
Johnson out of the Fifth Circuit, and that court said no,
that's not right, it refers to the underlying quality of

the claim.
QUESTION: Well, they are utterly disabled from
reviewing them so long as the underlying claim is not a
constitutional one.
MR. PESCETIA: But that's a QUESTION: I mean, it is thinkable that they
would be disabled from review.
MR. PESCETIA: I don't think that would have
happened in this way, Your Honor. If you look at the
mechanism for reviewing a second or successive petition
under the AEDPA, Congress was very clear that no court
could review the decision of a panel of the court of
appeals on a hearing on certiorari when that court has
made a decision whether or not to allow the filing of a
second or a successive petition.
When that issue was - when Congress decided not
to allow that issue to be addressed, it said so. Allowing
just an inference to arise from the change from a Federal
right to a constitutional right in language that has
always been viewed as applicable to the underlying claim,
not to the character of the procedural issues that may
cover that underlying claim, then I think, contrary to
Jones v. United States, this Court would be assuming that
Congress intended to make a very radical change in habeas
jurisprudence without giving any indication that that was

what it meant.
Also, if you look at section - former section
2244(c), the same language QUESTION: Where is that?
lvffi.. PESCETIA: It's at appendix 2, page 2 of our
opening brief, in about the middle of the paragraph, it that section refers to denial of a Federal right, which
constitutes grounds for discharge. The term, I submit,
denial of a Federal right, or denial of a constitutional
right, refers to the underlying claim in the petition, and
I think we would also have to consider the possibility
that there would be a constitutional problem if that
reading were adopted.
QUESTION: Why?
lvffi.. PESCETIA: Because what that would allow
would be entirely one-sided review of procedural issues in
habeas cases.
Now, again, when Congress legislated that no
court could review a decision of a panel of a court of
appeals deciding whether or not to allow the filing of a
second or successive petition, it said so explicitly, and
it applied equally to both parties, whether it was granted
or denied.
To infer, simply from the change of the word
Federal to constitutional, that Congress intended to erect

a system in which the Federal appellate courts could never
address anything but an error that favored the petitioner
but could never address an error that favored the State
would, I believe, present serious equal protection QUESTION: I don't see why you read it the way
you do. I mean, if you can have any Federal
constitutional claim reviewed, certainly the petitioner
can have it reviewed if it's decided adversely to him, can
he not?
1'AR.. PESCETIA: Well, that question depends on
whether, under the amici's reading of the jurisdictional
statute, whether that is covered by a procedural issue,
which on their reasoning you could never get past.
So the State could come into the court of
appeals and say, yes, we agree, the petitioner has an
absolutely meritorious constitutional claim that entitles
him to relief, and the district court erred in concluding
that the petitioner was 1 day late under the statute of
limitations under AEDPA, when, in fact, it was 1 day
early, but the court of appeals could never address that
claim, because no matter how compelling the underlying
claim is, no procedural issue could ever be reviewed by
any Federal appellate court, and I submit that that's
simply an irrational inference to make about what Congress
intended by this language.

QUESTION: But I - it may be a very restrictive
view, but I don't think it's necessarily one-sided,
because supposing the district court had come out just the
opposite way and said that the petition was timely when in
fact it was a day late, could the State get that reviewed?
MR. PESCETIA: Yes, Your Honor, because they
don't need a certificate of appealability, so what you
would have is a system of review in which, if the district
court errs one way and says incorrectly it's a day early,
so that the petitioner really shouldn't be there, the
State can appeal that, and that can be corrected.
If the district court, concededly erroneously,
says the petition is a day late, it doesn't matter how
compelling the underlying claims are, no Federal appellate
court could ever reach that, and that would be the
consequence of adopting amici's view of what that language
means.
QUESTION: But again, you acknowledge that this
situation exists so long as the - whenever the underlying
claim is not a constitutional claim. Let's assume that
the basis for the habeas request is that evidence was
wrongfully admitted in that shouldn't have been admitted
in, but without violating the Constitution. You
acknowledge that in that situation exactly what you say is
unthinkable would occur, that because there is a later

Page 21

( 2 l habeas court.

what kind of claims ultimately can be adjudicated,
constitutional claims rather than Federal claims.
This Court has done it - this Court has done it
itself in the Interstate Agreement on Detainers case,
where it said that's not really an error that rises to the
dignity of allowing habeas corpus relief. It's very
different when you say that only one side can get review
of procedural errors which bar you or purportedly bar you
from considering the underlying claims, whatever those
claims are, and that's our problem with this one-sided
system that the reading that amici give the statute would
erect.
It would say the State can always get
procedural, review of procedural errors committed by the
district courts and the petitioner never can QUESTION: Other than the -MR. PESCETTA : -- and that's very different from
saying that the quality of the underlying claim can be
decided - can be decided by Congress as having to have
sufficient substantiality to warrant relief.

QUESTION: Other than the Interstate Agreement

( 3 J ever raise any Federal claims except constitutional
( 4 l claims?

QUESTION: Oh, I see.

( 9 ) instance, addressed the Breard case, in a case where under
( 1 o J the reading that amici submit is the jurisdictional
( 11) reading of section 2253 this Court couldn't have addressed
( 12 l that case, because there could not have been a - it could
( 13 l not have addressed the procedural default issue in that
( 14 ) case, because that was a procedural issue and not a
( 15 J constitutional issue.
( 16)
I would just like to go back to where we started
( 1 7 ) on this. There are two parallel tracks, exhaustion, which
( 18 l is not a doctrine of preclusion. Exhaustion is a doctrine
( 1 9 l of deferral. Exhaustion says, go and do what you need to
( 20 l do in the State court, and our doors will be open when you
( 21 l return.
( 22 )
Abuse is a res judicata doctrine of preclusion.
(23) That doctrine says to the petitioner, if you have had what
(24 l McCleskey described as a full round of habeas review,
( 2 5 J don't come back. The problem with the rule in this case

is, it has crossed those and made a - basically a
monstrosity of combining those two concepts improperly.
QUESTION: Certainly our opinions do not refer
to the abuse of the writ cases as purely cases of res
judicata. They seem to indicate that it includes
something beyond raising a claim that was raised before.
:MR. PESCEITA : I disagree, Your Honor. Every
statement of this Court in Kuhlmann v. Wilson, in
McCleskey, in which the majority opinion written by
Justice Kennedy went into an extraordinarily long analysis
in demonstrating this is a qualified res judicata
doctrine, and that can't be applied when that previous
petition, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, was dismissed
without prejudice.
QUESTION: Well, that's certainly not what we
said in McCleskey, when we say a petitioner may abuse the
writ by failing to raise a claim through inexcusable
neglect.
:MR. PESCEITA: After -QUESTION: Our recent decisions confirm that
petitioner can abuse the writ by raising a claim in a
subsequent petition that he could have raised in his
first, regardless of whether the failure to raise it stems
from a deliberate choice.

first round of habeas, not as in Lonchar, from the first

If I may, could I save a couple of minutes for

QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Pescetta.
Mr. Sarnowski, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGillvffiNT OF DAVID A. SARNOWSKI
ON BEHALF OF 11IB RESPONDENTS
1-1R.. SARNOWSKI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
This case at its essence is about whether State
prisoners may file serial mixed petitions in the Federal
courts and repeatedly hail the State into Federal court
without a consequence, as long as they assert the lack of
a prior merits decision by a Federal court.
QUESTION: Mr. Sarnowski, did the State raise
the 2253(c) problem, the applicability of AEDPA and the
timeliness, the failure to file, get a certificate of
appealability?
1-1R.. SARNOWSKI: The State did not, Justice
O'Connor. In fact QUESTION: And it was not dealt with by the
lower courts?
1-1R.. SARNOWSKI: It was not. The circuit court
motions panel of two judges denied it.

QUESTION: Is it jurisdictional, do you think,
here as well as in the court of appeals?
MR. SARNOWSKI: Having QUESTION: If there is some violation, or
failure to obtain it under AEDPA, if AEDP A applies, is
that then jurisdictional here?
MR. SARNOWSKI: We believe it is, having
reviewed the - what amici has had to say about the issue.
We approached this case by opposing in the
district court the application for a certificate of
appealability, which was sought after the effective date
of AEDPA, in fact, 2 years, almost 2 years.
The district judge having earlier disposed of an
argument that AEDPA did apply when counsel for Mr. Slack
asserted that it did, also indicated that he was going to
apply the old probable cause rule and declined it
accordingly. We did oppose that. Our motion papers are
contained in the appendix.
Thus, the question then became the one that
Mr. Slack initially posed to the court, and the one upon
which this Court granted certiorari, rather than the
Jurisdictional question that the amici have briefed at
some length.
The problem with Mr. Slack's suggestion that a
rule of civil procedure, and specifically Rule 41, could

Page 26

apply to allow the district court some control over the
litigation, is twofold. Number 1, that suggestion was
never asserted by Mr. Slack at any point in time in the
prior proceedings, and it has been heard for the first
tune in this Court.
More importantly, it would then leave individual
application of individual rules to apply perhaps in
individual districts, such as Nevada, which does not have
multiple Federal districts, although we have six judges,
whereas the rule that we made our motion under and the
court applied to this case is a system-wide rule, Rule
9(b).
QUESTION: Wouldn't it have been rather
difficult for Mr. Pescetta to make that point to the Ninth
Circuit, which had established a rule that this second
petition under the Ninth Circuit rule was successive?
MR. SARNOWSKI: We suggest that it would not
have been difficult for counsel for Mr. Slack to have
informed the district court, Judge Hagan, before the case
ever proceeded to the circuit court, that there was an
alternative way and a suggestion that Mr. Slack had to try
to dispose of the case, such that he wasn't found to have
abused the writ.
And we need to recall that Judge Hagan just
didn't file an outright dismissal order based on our

moving papers. He ordered Mr. Slack to explain why, after
we had properly pled abuse of the writ, why he hadn't
abused it.
Rather than doing so, Mr. Slack merely reargued
his point that he argues now, is that Rule 9(b) doesn't
apply, that as long as he brings in mixed petitions
serially, there is no control and there's nothing that the
court could have done to make him.
QUESTION: You're talking now about the
arguments on the second petition.
:rviR. SARNOWSKI: Yes.
QUESTION: Before Judge Hagan.
MR. SARNOWSKI: Yes. The first petition was
dealt with by the judge, and he allowed Mr. Slack to
return to the State courts. This case is not about
whether he'll ever get a review, in our view, on those
claims that he initially identified. It was only what
Judge Hagan, the district judge, felt to have been the
belatedly included and unexhausted issues that counsel
amended into the second petition.
QUESTION: Mr. Sarnowski, suppose that the
defendant, when he went to the State court to exhaust, had
indeed exhausted everything, not only the claims that he
put in the Federal habeas petition, but new and different
ones that weren't in the first Federal petition, so he's

exhausted everything. He comes back to the Federal court.
ls your argument that that would be okay, or do
I tlllderstand correctly you to say he can't put in
additional claims in the Federal petition?
11R.. SARNOWSKI: Our position is that he -- tlllder
the rule, he is not allowed to include additional claims
beyond those that he had already identified. Of course QUESTION: Even though he's exhausted them now.
11R.. SARNOWSKI: That's correct. Of course, it
would thus then be up to the State to assert any
affirmative defense that may be available to it. In a
pre-AEDPA situation, rule 9(b) QUESTION: Well, I don't know why we get to
affirmative defenses if those additional claims are simply
out, even though they've been exhausted, tlllder your view.
11R.. SARNOWSKI: For purposes of this case - I
don't think that's the question presented - it is a more
difficult question as we look at the abuse rule applied to
those facts.
QUESTION: But I thought your position was a
categorical rule. If you haven't got it in the first
petition, you can't have it in the second.
11R.. SARNOWSKI: That is our position, but it's
always up to the State to assert the affinnative defense,
and if it does so, it's then -

QUESTION: A State can waive it, of course, but
would you explain to me how your categorical rule is
compatible with the 9(b) language that says, if new and
different grounds are alleged, the judge finds. Finds
sounds like a case-specific assessment and not a
categorical rule.
MR. SARNOWSKI: If the judge were to find that
those additional new and different grounds that you say in
your hypothetical were not included in the first petition,
ifhe finds that they are new and different, then under
the rule, assuming we asserted the affrrmative defense -QUESTION: But it doesn't say, ifhe finds
they're new and different. He says, they are new and
different, and the judge finds that the failure to assert
them earlier.
MR. SARNOWSKI: Correct. Those are the two
predicates that the Ninth Circuit decision in Farmer
requires, that they be new and different grounds alleged,
and that the failure to assert those grounds in a prior
petition constituted an abuse of the writ.
QUESTION: But I thought that the Ninth Circuit
rule was they automatically do. If you haven't got them
in the first petition, then there isn't a case-by-case
examination.
MR. SARNOWSKI: We don't read the Ninth

Page 30

Circuit's opinion in Farmer to go nearly that far,
( 2 ) because - and we have never argued otherwise, that Rule
c3 ) 9(b) allows discretion. We think it allows much more
( 4 ) discretion than the AEDPA statutory version alluded to.
(5 l
QUESTION: Well, are you saying that there is a
( 6) general rule that anything new is categorically subject to
( 7 l dismissal, but that that is subject to an exception under
(al the clause of 9(b) that Justice Ginsburg was referring to?
( 9) In other words, the petitioner could say, let me argue
(1 o l this particular issue, because it was not abusive of me to
( 11 l leave it out. Is that what you're saying?
( 12 l
:tvffi. SARNOWSKI: Correct, and at that point,
c1 3 l that's where we found ourselves in this case when Judge
( 1 4 ) Hagan told Mr. Slack to, under these facts to explain why
( 1 5 l he was raising new issues.
( 16 l
QUESTION: Well, the (17 )
:tvffi. SARNOWSKI: You can extend the same logic ( 18)
QUESTION: Yes, but the odd thing with your
c 19 l argument is that abuse is normally a defense to a claim
( 20) raised, and you're in effect arguing that what the rule
( 21 ) means is that abuse in effect is an affirmative basis for
( 2 2) a petitioner to allege as a basis for getting around the
( 2 3 l categorical rule, and that is - at least starts with very
c 2 4 ) odd procedural language usage. For that reason, rm not
( 25 l sure that I think it's plausible.

lv1R. SARNOWSKI: Our reading of the rule requires
us, as we did in this case, to affirmatively plead with
specificity what the abuse of the writ consists QUESTION: Why?
lvffi.. SARNOWSKI: - the procedural -QUESTION: Why don't you merely on your rule, or
the Ninth Circuit rule, have to plead the fact that wasn't
included in the first petition, and you only get into
abuse, on your view, as I understand it, if the petitioner
says, but it's not abusive for me to raise it. Then you
get into abuse, and that is anomalous procedurally.
lv1R. SARNOWSKI: Well, relying on the former
opinion, we rely on it in its entirety, and the circuit
court instructed us through that opinion that the
requirement is to plead the affirmative defense. It's not
up to the petitioner to come in and say, and rm not
abusing the writ, first.
QUESTION: But there are some new grounds that
would not be an abuse of the writ, such as a new ground
that arose after the last one was decided, a claim of
incompetency to be executed, for example.
lv1R. SARNOWSKI: We agree with that statement,
Justice Scalia.
QUESTION: So that there is a need to put in
that language the judge finds that the failure to assert

those grounds in a prior petition constituted an abuse of
the writ.
MR. SARNOWSKI: And that is by an individual
case detennination that the judge makes. Here, the judge
had no explanation whatsoever for Mr. Slack. Rather, he
merely had Mr. Stack's continuing argument that the rule
doesn't apply because there wasn't a merits detennination .
QUESTION: I thought one explanation was that
counsel finally got to shape these pleadings, and so these
claims appear as they do in the first petition that was
filed by counsel.
MR. SARNOWSKI: There was an argument, I
believe, to that effect after the court's dismissal, when
Mr. Slack sought a certificate of probable cause. I
frankly do not recall that argument having been made prior
to the judge's first decision.
QUESTION: But is it the case that this is the
first petition in which the petitioner was represented by
counsel?
MR. SARNOWSKI: In the Federal court, that is
correct. He, of course, had counsel at trial and on
direct appeal in the State court.
QUESTION: Yes. I mean on collateral review.
MR. SARNOWSKI: That's correct.

petition, ground one and ground two, one is not exhausted,
tWo is. It goes to the State court, comes back, we add
ground three.
Could a judge say, in this circumstance there is
no abuse of the writ the first time for the reason that,
a) the petitioner had no lawyer the first time, and most
of them are pretty mixed up, and b), since I dismissed it
immediately because it wasn't mixed, no harm to the court
was done.
MR. SARNOWSKI: To answer the first prong, while
a judge may look at that in the exercise of his
discretion, we don't understand this Court's
jurisprudence, and particularly now, if we are informed by
AEDP A, the section of AEDPA that says whatever counsel
that they had did or didn't do doesn't matter, I know of
no case that says that if a Federal habeas petitioner
didn't have a lawyer at all, that that is excuse enough.
QUESTION: I didn't say that. What I said was,
because it was immediately sent out of the Federal court
back to the State no harm to the court was done. No time
was wasted. It was dismissed, because it was a mixed
petition, and that's why there was no abuse of the writ
the first time.
MR. SARNOWSKI: I would suggest that while there

may not have been hann in the literal sense, the court was
not the only party to be considered. Our position is that
the serial -- the filing of serial mixed petitions also
impacts very deleteriously on the resources of the State.
In this particular instance, we did, in fact,
appear in the second case, not the first case as your
example is given to us, and under Mr. Stack's theory, he's
going to get to go back to State court, and we're going to
have to be hailed back into Federal court again and do all
the things that we do to respond.
QUESTION: Mr. Sarnowski, look at the appendix
for a moment, if you will, the joint appendix, page 197,
and it's before a two-judge motions panel of the Ninth
Circuit, and it simply says the request for a certificate
of probable cause is denied. ls that the only opinion we
have from the Ninth Circuit in this case?
MR. SARNOWSKI: It is, Chief Justice.
QUESTION: So we don't know the reason for the
Ninth Circuit's denial of a certificate of probable cause,
do we?
l-.1R. SARNOWSKI: No, we don't.
QUESTION: May I ask a question that focuses on
the language of the statute for a minute? We are talking,
are we not, about 2244(b)(1) and (b)(2), and (b)(l) says,

application under 2254 that was presented in a prior
application shall be dismissed, and I have two questions.
The first question is, if the first petition was
not exhausted, presented three claims, 1, 2, and 3, and
then it was exhausted, and it came back and presented just
those three claims, would that be a second or successive
petition within the meaning of (bX1) in your view?
:MR. SARNOWSKI: No.
QUESTION: It would not. Now, (bX2) has
similar language, and then talks about the addition of new
claims, and it says, it shall be dismissed, a second - a
claim presented in a second or successive habeas petition
that was not presented in a prior application shall be
dismissed unless.
Now, is that also not a second or successive if
there were three claims in the first that were not
exhausted, then three new claims were added when it comes
back. Is that second or successive, or is it just like
the first, it was not second or successive because the
first one was dismissed for failure to exhaust?
1v1R. SARNOWSKI: I would state that then the
rule - and I believe you're referring to the new statute.
QUESTION: I'm referring to 2244, whether the
claim - my question really is whether the word second or
successive habeas application have the same meaning in

MR. SARNOWSKI: Now I understand the question
you asked me. I - they have the same meaning in both
instances.
QUESTION: Then if it's not a second or
successive under (b)(1) in my first example, it's also not
a second or successive in the second.
MR. SARNOWSKI: And rm - I would agree. I
misstated the answer based on what I understood your
question to be, and I apologize. You can't have two
different meanings QUESTION: So if it's not a second or successive
in this case it should not be dismissed under (bX2).
MR. SARNOWSKI: If that statute even applies,
which we have contended it does not. We have never
contended the AEDPA abuse of the writ statute, if you
will, applies, but rather, Rule 9, which was in effect at
the time of filing and has never been rescinded even after
enactment of AEDP A.
QUESTION: This is Rule 9 of what? Where MR. SARNOWSKI: Rule 9 of the rules governing
section 2254 cases in the United States Supreme Court.
QUESTION: Adopted by?
MR. SARNOWSKI: This Court through the Congress
in 1976, and I think that's a point worth noting, that the

understand that on the surface of it, it may be seen that
capital petitioners have more of a reason to do this very
thing, and in fact that was our theory in Farmer.
He came back and forth between the Federal court
three times, the Federal and State courts three times,
over our objection the second and third time, and after
the dismissal the third time, where the judge allowed him
to go back yet again, we in essence said, enough is
enough, we are appealing the judge's abuse of discretion
for not at least considering our abuse of the writ
defense, and the Ninth Circuit panel agreed that in fact
the court should hold a hearing about that. It didn't
necessarily say it should find abuse on those facts.
Here we have a noncapital petitioner, but the
expenditure of the State's resources to ping-pong and to
respond to -QUESTION: What is the incentive? You said this
is a recurrent problem. I can see in a death case
spinning out the date of execution, but in a nondeath
case, you can never get the attention of the Federal
court. You cannot engage the Federal court until you've
exhausted. Lundy makes that absolutely clear.
So what incentive would a defendant have for
this kind of, what you call ping-pong?

well know facts about the case that the State does not
know even well after the case, such as certain witnesses
have died, certain witnesses have disappeared, evidence
has been lost or destroyed, that if the State were
required to refile the case and try it anew, that he would
then have a benefit that he didn't have at the first
trial.
QUESTION: Well, but that's -QUESTION: What about the statute of limitations
under AEDPA? There's a rather short statute of
limitations. Wouldn't that be of some assistance?
MR. SARNOWSKI: We would -- in an appropriate
case we would assert that. I suppose its total
applicability to the serial petition coming back to
Federal court would depend on what the court, how the
court construes the provisions of the AEDP A, which speak
to what a properly filed petition is.
The Ninth Circuit, as an example, has just ruled
that if a State court rules that for some procedural
default reason a petition is belated in the State courts,
it will not be considered a properly filed one, and thus
it will not have tolled the time to file a Federal
petition under the AEDP A statute that we now -QUESTION: Mr. Sarnowski MR. SARNOWSKI: - existing.

Page 41
QUESTION: - may I go back to my question for a
minute. As I understand it, you're relying primarily on
Rule 9(b), but the question that the Court posed in the
order granting certiorari related only to section 2254.
You're aware of that. Page 198 of the transcript.
Am I correct in understanding that you would
agree that if we confined our attention to the question
raised in that -- in our order, the 2254, this is not a
second or successive within the meaning of 2254, so you
would agree with your opponent's answer to the question
presented by the Court.
MR. SARNOWSKI: No, we would not agree, Justice
Stevens. We don't believe that the rule has a different
meaning than the statute as to what a second or successive
petition is, and -QUESTION: But in answer to my questions
earlier, you said that the hypothetical I gave you was not
a second or successive within the meaning of (b)(1) or
(b)(2), and you said no, that's true, but that's why they
relied on AEDPA and you didn't, and you're relying on

QUESTION: Well, but do you agree that this is
not a second or successive petition within the meaning of
2244(b )(2)?
MR. SARNOWSKl: No, we do not. We -- although
we relied exclusive!y on the affirmative defense provided
to us by the rule.
QUESTION: Well then, can I go back to my
example Wlder (b)(1 ). If it were just the same claims as
in the State petition, which was Wlexhausted and refiled,
I thought you agreed with me it would not be second or
successive within the meaning of (b X1). Am I wrong on
that?
MR. SARNOWSKI: It would be within the meaning
of that if it was presented in the application.
QUESTION: Here's my hypothetical. Let's be
perfectly clear about it. You have - the petitioner has
one claim. He files in Federal court, and the district
court says, you haven't exhausted, rn dismiss without
prejudice. He goes back and exhausts. Now he comes back.
Is that a second or successive petition within the meaning
of (bXI )?
MR. SARNOWSKl: No, and QUESTION: All right. Now he is - now this I change my example. He takes the first petition with one
claim, goes back and exhausts that, adds a second claim

and comes back. Is that a second or successive within the
meaning of (bX2)?
MR. SARNOWSKI: Yes, because -- I assume your
question posits that the second claim was not identified
in the first petition, thus it would be new.
QUESTION: It would be new.
MR. SARNOWSKI: It was one not presented.
QUESTION: That would be a new claim presented
in a second or successive, but you would give a different
meaning to the words second or successive in (bXI) than
(b)(2).
MR. SARNOWSKI: Based on the wording of the
statute, not to the words second or successive, but on how
the petition is handled, because he's not coming in with
an - in your example, as I understand it, the issue he
had previously identified is the one he was coming back
with to apply (bXl), whereas he came back with different
issues in (b)(2).
QUESTION: Yes, but it's - the (bX2) as I read
it, it says a claim presented in a second or successive
that was not presented in a prior application. That deals
with it. But you're saying that one is second or
success - my second example is second or successive, but
the first one is not.

try to best answer your question, in any instance where
something wasn't identified in that first petition and the
petitioner comes back with it, it is new, or in the words
of the new statute, or AEDPA, not presented, and thus then
we look to the mechanism as to what the court is to do
with QUESTION: But isn't it - isn't the reason that
it's not second or successive under one because there was
no prior adjudication of anything on the merits under the
original petition?
MR. SARNOWSKI: Some of QUESTION: Isn't that the reason that you had,
that you gave Justice Stevens the answer you did on ( 1)?
MR. SARNOWSKI: Some of this Court's case law,
and much of the case law that the circuit courts have
issued, says that.
QUESTION: All right. Then why don't you have
to give him the same answer under (2)? Nothing - on his
second hypothetical under (2), nothing has been
adjudicated on the merits.
MR. SARNOWSKI: Perhaps because I didn't because the question posits that there are additional
claims.
QUESTION: Yes, there are additional claims, but
if second and successive refers to the fact or not of an

adjudication on the merits of a prior petition, then I
don't see why you don't have to give him the same answer
under (2) that you did under ( 1).
MR. SARNOWSKI: The essence of the difference is
that they take the position, and Mr. Slack does, that it
requires a prior merits adjudication, we take the position
that it doesn't. If I mistakenly or confusedly answered
Justice Stevens' questions, I certainly didn't mean to.
The crux of the dispute is, we say it doesn't
require a prior merits decision, be it under the Rule 9,
or under the QUESTION: Then why doesn't it under (b)(l)?
MR. SARNOWSKI: - statute that applied, or the
new one.
QUESTION: Why doesn't it under (b)(l)?
MR. SARNOWSKI: Because it doesn't -- the
statute doesn't speak to, as I understand it, whether or
not there was a prior adjudication. It merely says,
presented in a prior application.
QUESTION: What is the corresponding language of
AEDPA, supposing that we decide that AEDPA does apply to
this case?
MR. SARNOWSKI: That's the statute QUESTION: Is that the AEDPA language?
MR. SARNOWSKI: Yes. It appears in the brief

for the petitioner in appendix 3.
(2 l
QUESTION: Mr. Sarnowski, I take it it's your
( 3 l position that the words second or successive application

support you on that?
MR. SARNOWSKI: The case law, I have found no
case that ever says what second or successive means. This
Court, even as recently as Martinez-Villareal, its opinion
of two tenns ago -QUESTION: Going the other way, have you found
any case -- I refer specifically to Justice Kennedy's
opinion, McCleskey and all the cases he cites, in which
the abuse of the writ doctrine has been applied when there
has not been a prior dismissal on the merits?
MR. SARNOWSKI: The Sanders case upon which the
rule was fashioned, the 1963 decision in a 2255 case, in
which this Court said, Mr. Sanders' first petition was
dismissed for procedural reasons.
That is, it was inadequately pied, and while it
reversed the finding of abuse, it did allow the
Government, as the case was remanded back, to assert
abuse, and we have cited that particular scenario in our
brief to this Court, and the Ninth Circuit relied on it.
QUESTION: What about the Fanner case from the
Ninth Circuit? That tends to support your MR. SARNOWSKI: Certainly. It's the first case,
and I would readily admit there is no other case there,
and like so many issues that get to this Court, this is a
particular case on particular facts, and apparently we

were the first ones who had had enough of serial mixed
petitions warranting the affirmative defense which we
proffered successfully not only in Farmer, but in this
case.

the certificate. Thank you.
QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Sarnowski.
Mr. Pescetta, you have 2 minutes remaining.
REBlfITAL ARGUlvffiNT OF MICHAEL PESCETTA
ON BEHALF OF TIIB PEIIIIONER
.tv1R. PESCETTA: Let me just cite the Court the
language of this Court's decision in Stewart v. MartinezVillareal at page 1622 of 118 Supreme Court Reports.
The Chief Justice's opinion in that case said,
we believe that respondent's fourth claim here, previously
dismissed as premature, should be treated in the same
manner as the claim of a petitioner who returns to a
Federal habeas court after exhausting his State remedies.
Later on, in both situations, the habeas
petitioner did not receive an adjudication of his claim.
To hold otherwise would mean that a dismissal of a first
habeas petition for technical procedural reasons would bar
the prisoner from ever obtaining Federal habeas review.
QUESTION: That would support you ifthere were
no other claims tacked on here to the exhausted claim.

lv1R. PESCETIA: Respectfully, Your Honor, I
disagree. Either we have a second or a successive
petitlon, or we do not. If we have a second or a
successive petition, then the res judicata body of law
applies.
If a dismissal without prejudice, as this Court
allowed in Rose v. Lundy, counts as toward counting a
second or a successive petition, it's my understanding of
Martinez-Villareal that that's the petition this Court
rejected. A dismissal without prejudice is a dismissal
without prejudice. It has no QUESTION: Unless second or successive is a tenn
of art which does not include bringing back a petition
previously dismissed without prejudice with the
instruction to exhaust the State remedies.
lv1R. PESCETIA: The distinction there, Your
Honor, is it has always been understood as a res judicata
doctrine, not as a pleading limitation doctrine.
QUESTION: No, the real distinction is, the
question of what do you identify as the first? There
can't be a second W1less there's a first, and if you
dismiss it for not -- exhaustion, and you don't add any
new claims, it wasn't a first.
lv1R. PESCETIA: It can't -QUESTION: If you add a new claim, it suddenly

(2 l

QUESTION: Is there any reason to think that
( 7 l AEDP A froze the concept of a second or a successive

( 10 l that it was?
( 11 l
?vfR. PESCETIA: I think the problem there, Your
( 12) Honor, there's no evidence of it. The courts of appeals
( 13 l are absolutely unanimous that under AEDPA a petition filed
( 14 l after a previous dismissal of that prejudice for
( 15 l exhaustion is not second or successive.
