United States.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GELLER:

9
10

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may

it please the Court:

11

The Internal Revenue Code generally requires

12

every corporation to pay an annual tax measured by its

13

entire net income, but Congress decided 30 years ago in

14

the DISC and FSC statutes that it wished to encourage

15

exports by giving favorable tax treatment to the portion

16

of a company's net income that's attributable to export

17

sales.

18

In order to determine the extent of this income

19

tax benefit, it's obviously critically important to

20

determine precisely how much net income is generated by a

21

company's export sales in any particular year.

22

In enacting the DISC statute, Congress said

23

quite specifically how it expected this export net income

24

calculation to be made.

25

were to be reduced only by those costs that were directly

Gross revenues from export sales

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and factually related to the export income.

Export sales

2

revenues were not to be burdened with unrelated expenses

3

which would distort the true amount of export income, and

4

thereby reduce the intended incentive.
The DISC regulations, which were promulgated

5
6

shortly after the statute was passed, reiterate that there

7

must be a direct factual relationship between export sales

8

and expenses.
QUESTION:

9
10

proposition in the statute, Mr. Geller?
MR. GELLER:

11
12

Where do you -- do you get that

two separate statutory provisions.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. GELLER:

15

Justice Scalia, we get it out of
One is section 994.

Where are these to be found?
These are -- this is found on

page 27a of the appendix to the petition.
And specifically, the reference in 994(a) and

16
17

994(a)(2) to the requirement that a determination must be

18

made of the net income, quote, attributable to export

19

receipts.

20

word attributable, which this Court in the tax context has

21

construed to mean generated by, or caused by, is that you

22

have to take the export -- the revenues from exports and

23

reduce them only by the costs or deductions that are

24

related to those exports, or else you can't possibly come

25

up with a true figure of export -- net export income

We think that the common sense nature of the

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

that's attributable to those -- to those sales.
QUESTION:

I -- I suppose that -- that R&D

3

expenses have to be attributed in a lot of other instances

4

under the code, don't they?

5

Government use this same procedure that it's been using

6

here in other -- in other areas where it has to

7

attribute -- where -- where R&D expense has to be

8

attributed?

9

MR. GELLER:

And -- and doesn't the

Yes.

It relies on a provision,

10

which we'll talk about in a few minutes, that has many,

11

many applications, and it may well be that in a number of

12

those other applications, it's perfectly valid.

13

position is --

14
15

QUESTION:

Well, why is that?

MR. GELLER:

17

QUESTION:

19

I mean, why is

it attributable --

16

18

Our

Well, as I hope to --- okay elsewhere to -- to produce

this result, but not okay here to produce this result?
MR. GELLER:

Because it -- the DISC provisions

20

are unique in a number of respects, one of which is it

21

allows the taxpayer to engage in a particular grouping of

22

transactions, and the -- the -- as we'll talk about in a

23

few minutes, the R&D regulations insist that R&D be

24

attributed in a way that disregards the particular

25

groupings that the taxpayer has selected.

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

But there's another statutory provision that I'd

2

like to call your attention to, Your Honor, and that's

3

section 861.

4

in the code, was in the code for more than 50 years at the

5

time the DISC statute was passed, and it provides for how

6

deductions are to be allocated to gross income.

7

this appears at page 26a of the appendix.

8
9

861 is a section of the code that has been

This --

Now Congress, in passing the DISC statute, said
quite specifically that it wanted deductions under the

10

DISC statute to be allocated in a way generally in

11

accordance with the principles of section 861, which were

12

well-established at that time.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. GELLER:

15
16

Where -- where did Congress say that?
Congress said that in the reports

of the House, of the tax-writing committee.
QUESTION:

Just for my benefit, when it's in the

17

statute, would you say Congress said it.

18

legislative history, would you tell me who said it?

19

MR. GELLER:

20

QUESTION:

21
22

When it's in

Yes, Your Honor.
Because when you say Congress said

it, I thought you mean it's in the statute.
MR. GELLER:

Well, it's not in the statute.

23

It's in the reports of the tax-writing committees.

But,

24

Your Honor, these were not idle statements.

25

not statements of individual Congressmen, or statements on

These were

the floor.

2

reports of both the House and Senate tax-writing

3

committees which focused specifically -- specifically --

4

on how Congress expected these deductions to be allocated.

5

And I would refer the Court to page -QUESTION:

6
7

And I'm sure everybody who voted for

that knew about those statements.
MR. GELLER:

8
9

These were deliberate statements put in the

Your Honor, these were specific

statements that went to the heart of the issue that's

10

before the Court today, and we've quoted them at page 22

11

of our brief, the blue brief.

12

these 861 rules --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. GELLER:

Congress said that

The committee said.

Please, please.

The committee reports said -The committee reports said

15

excuse me, Justice Scalia.

16

that -- that the 861 rules, which are important because

17

later the regulations themselves under DISC reference the

18

861 rules, so it's -- and that's the heart of the

19

Government's argument in this case, so it's important to

20

understand what people thought at the time these 861 rules

21

meant.
QUESTION:

22

But -- but why does 861 get you out

23

of the general allocation provisions any more than 994

24

does?

25

the usual rule for apportionment of R&D?

In other words, the question was, why do we ignore
And you said,

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

well, because 994 is -- is specific and -- and has some

2

policies of its own.

3

that argument, you show us 861.

4

MR. GELLER:

5

QUESTION:

6

And then you said -- and to further

Yes.
But the regs that we're talking

about, which the Government relies on, are under 861.
MR. GELLER:

7

Yes, but the -- the regulation,

8

Justice Kennedy, that the Government relies on was added

9

to 861 after the DISC regulations were finalized.

It was

10

added in 1977.

The DISC statute was passed in 1971.

11

DISC regulations were finalized in 1975.

12

is it's important to understand what Congress in 1971

13

thought it was doing in the DISC statute, and therefore it

14

seems to us extremely important that it said that it

15

expected deductions, including presumably any deduction,

16

including R&D, to be allocated in accordance generally

17

with the principles of section 861, which were described

18

quite clearly in the Senate and House reports of the

19

tax-writing committees to --

20

QUESTION:

So our position

Mr. Geller, there's one problem.

21

Perhaps you can cast some light on it.

22

attributable that you pointed to in 994.

23

have divided into Blue Sky and program- or product-

24

specific.

25

The

MR. GELLER:

The word is
And the R&D you

Yes.

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

That -- that's Boeing's creation.

2

The R&D -- that division is eminently manipulable, it

3

seems to me, if it -- it's the distinction whether it's

4

allocated across the board because of Blue Sky or

5

particular program or project depends on some official act

6

by a corporate board which could be yesterday, could be

7

next month.

It's in the control of the corporation.

8

MR. GELLER:

9

It's not manipulable.

Not -- not quite, Justice Ginsburg.
It has to satisfy the regulations

10

promulgated under DISC.

11

I would refer the Court to page 33a of the appendix to the

12

petition, and specifically the grouping regulations --

13

provide that a taxpayer can only group -- can only group

14

transactions if they fall within a recognized industry

15

product line.

16

allocate expenses to any sorts of transactions you want.

17

They have to be grouped in a way that's consistent with

18

the DISC statute.

19

The DISC regulations -- and here

So, in other words, you can't -- you can't

And that's exactly what Boeing did here.

The

20

Blue Sky R&D was attributable to all of their airplane

21

products, and therefore it was allocated to the groupings

22

of all of the different airplane programs.

23

program-specific R&D -- and I don't think there's any

24

factual dispute about this.

25

factually and directly related only to a specific program.

These

The program-specific R&D was

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The 747 R&D, for example, was -- was factually and

2

directly related only to the 747 program.

3

Boeing allocated that R&D only to the 747 program.
QUESTION:

4

And that's why

Mr. Geller, can I ask you a factual

5

question that will help me understand?

6

there just one DISC involved here, or do you have several

7

DISCs for different product lines?

8

MR. GELLER:

9

QUESTION:

No.

Does the -- is

It's one -- it's one DISC.

So that what difference would it make

10

whether it was the 747 program, or the 727 program if the

11

DISC sells them both anyway?
MR. GELLER:

12

Because, Justice Stevens, under the

13

statute, combined taxable income or export income is -- is

14

to be determined on the basis of product groupings, or at

15

least, the taxpayer has the option of choosing to group by

16

different products rather than by all the sales of the

17

DISC.

18

income is for the 747 program, which takes the revenues

19

from the 747 program and reduces them by the deductions,

20

including R&D that's factually and directly related to the

21

747 program, and you -- you come up with the CTI for the

22

747 program.

23

group of export income.

24

regulations Boeing was entitled to group transactions.

25

So, therefore, here, we determine what the export

Under -- it's not all mixed together as one
Under -- under the statute and

The -- the problem here is that the regulation

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that the Government relies on takes huge amounts of R&D

2

that are directly related to a specific program and

3

allocates them among all of the programs.

4

QUESTION:

But, of course, the converse, I

5

suppose under your view, all of the R&D would go to the

6

domestic corporation because it all takes place before the

7

product is put on the market.

8
9

MR. GELLER:

No.

It doesn't really matter

whether the product is on the market or not, Your Honor.

10

It has to be allocated to a class of gross income.

11

that class of gross income may well include, as it does in

12

this case, products or programs that aren't yet on the

13

market that are being developed.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. GELLER:

Now,

Right.
And nonetheless, the regulations

16

are quite clear that the deductions have to be allocated

17

to that class of gross income.

18

So, for example, in the 757 program, which was

19

in -- which was being developed in 1982, there were no

20

sales of the 757 in 1982, and yet there were hundreds of

21

millions of dollars of R&D expended in that year.

22

view, the regulations make it quite clear that Boeing had

23

to allocate those deductions, that R&D and other

24

deductions, to the 757 program.

25

QUESTION:

In our

Well, what -- what do you say to at

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

least this argument of the Government?

2

Government would probably say, sure, there's -- there's a

3

kind of factual sense in which there is the kind of

4

relationship that you're talking about.

5

the closest relationship -- the most perfect

6

relationship -- you would capitalize your R&D and you

7

would start amortizing it when you actually have a product

8

that is generating income that you're selling.

9

be the closest match you could get.

10

I -- I guess the

But if you want

That would

That match, in effect, has -- has been -- has

11

been set aside.

Instead of forcing you to do that, the

12

law now allows you to -- to use your R&D as -- as a

13

current expense.

14

Once you start using it, once you start treating

15

it as a current expense, that very close relationship that

16

you have, if you had capitalized it, is gone.

17

the Government is saying is, it's a judgment call how

18

close it's got to be now, now that you have broken the

19

link and have allowed current expense.

20

judgment call is quintessentially the judgment call that

21

the -- that the Treasury makes when it's write -- when it

22

writes regulations.

23

And what

And that kind of a

And why isn't that a pretty powerful argument?

24

And if it is, how do you get over the point of

25

reasonableness or -- or Chevron deference as the

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Government would see it?
MR. GELLER:

Well, Justice Souter, you've

described the Government's position.

4

respond to it.

Let me see if I can

But generally, just -- as to the last point --

this is not a legislative regulation.

1

QUESTION:

-- does it not?

2

MR. GELLER:

Yes, it does but it has to be

3

consistent, obviously, with the legislative scheme that

4

it's interpreting.

5
6
7

Justice Souter, let me answer your question a
number of different ways.
First, it is not at all unique for expenses to

8

give rise to future year income.

In fact, most expenses

9

give rise to future year income.

The fact that an expense

10

may occur in year 1, and the income may be generated in

11

year 2, is a commonplace.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. GELLER:

14

QUESTION:

It doesn't in any way --

Sure they do.
It -But the most precise way to match it,

15

I -- I would suppose, is the capitalization way.

16

Government says once you -- once you lose the

17

quintessentially perfect way of doing it, then how you're

18

going to recognize it is a judgment call.

19

MR. GELLER:

And the

Well, I don't accept -- they can't

20

capitalize it, Your Honor, because Congress made a

21

judgment in section 174 of the code in order to encourage

22

R&D to allow it to be immediately deducted in the year in

23

which it's incurred.

24
25

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

And they say when

Congress made that judgment, there's a further judgment

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

left and that is the judgment how close has it got to be.
MR. GELLER:

2

Yes, but the Government's

3

regulation here is not close at all.

4

concedes that -- that expenses for R&D give rise to future

5

year income.

6

can't --

7

The Government

They can't -- because of section 174, they

Well, sometimes -- sometimes they do

and sometimes they don't.

fine, the answer is yes.

I mean, if things work out
If they don't work out fine, the

10

answer is no.

11

one of the problems that the Government raises.

12

And that's -- that's one of the -- that's

MR. GELLER:

Well, look at what the 8(e)(3)

13

regulation does, Your Honor.

14

to match current year R&D expenses with some future income

15

that might be generated from that R&D.

16

does, it allocates all of that income to current year

17

expenses -- to current year revenues for products that

18

have no relation whatsoever to that R&D.

21
22

What it, instead,

For example, let me say -- come back again to
the 757 program.
QUESTION:

Well, here -- may -- may I interrupt

you with this question?

23

MR. GELLER:

24

QUESTION:

25

It doesn't make any attempt

whatsoever.

Sure.
You say it has no relation

I take it then you are saying that the

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Government is simply factually wrong when it makes the

2

statement that R&D, which may have a closer relation to

3

one product line than another, nonetheless tends, as a

4

general rule, to have benefits that go beyond product

5

lines.

6

learn useful things, and you use them all over the place.

We -- they -- they, in effect, say, look, you

7

Are you saying that that is factually wrong?

8

MR. GELLER:

9

Yes.

I'm saying that -- that --

I'm saying clearly in this case it's factually wrong.

For

10

example, this case went off on cross motions for summary

11

judgment.

12

as a factual matter -- allocated the R&D expenses

13

correctly.

14

had to be reallocated because of this conclusive

15

presumption in section 8(e)(3).

16

There was really no dispute that Boeing had --

As a factual matter.

The Government said they

But, yes, I'm telling you, Justice --

17

Justice Souter, that that's incorrect as a factual matter,

18

that in fact, under section 174, in order to take a

19

deduction for R&D at all in any circumstance, DISC or no

20

DISC, the taxpayer has to be able to factually relate that

21

R&D expense to a particular product.

22
23

QUESTION:

Oh, you've got to show the

relationship --

24

MR. GELLER:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, factual relationship.
-- but it doesn't follow from that

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that there is no benefit to product lines outside of that

2

relationship.
MR. GELLER:

3

Yes, but if there -- there could

4

well be a spill-over benefit to future product lines, but

5

that doesn't, A, mean that it's not directly and factually

6

related a specific current program.
And also, look at the oddity and anomaly of the

7
8

Government's position here, Justice Souter.

9

is -- there is some spill-over effect for future product

10

lines, when the Government -- when the -- when Boeing was

11

developing the 757, it's conceivable that they were

12

learning things that would benefit future products.

13

what the Government does is take all that R&D and allocate

14

it to existing products, sales of existing products that

15

couldn't possibly have benefitted from that R&D.

things wrong with that, Justice Breyer.

25

you yourself pointed out.

The first is, as

doesn't follow the general guidelines of the 861 rules.

6

It was not even in the regulation.

That's right.

In respect to that,

for you to win on that, we'd have to say that Congress

MR. GELLER:

But not pursuant to the rules.

5

This is -- if you look, in fact, at the 8(e)(3)

6

regulation, Justice Scalia, it begins by explaining why

it's deviating from the general rules of 861, why it felt

that there was a regime here that requires a -- accurate

The rules that were

1

at least in this context.

2

But there's another reason, Justice Kennedy, why

3

the 1977 8(e)(3) regulation is inconsistent with DISC, and

4

that's the grouping regulations, which I want to call your

5

attention to, which is a very, very important part of the

6

DISC statute.

7

If I could call the Court's attention to the

8

grouping regulations which appear at -- at 994(c)(7),

9

which is the bottom of page 33a of the appendix to the

10

petition, you will see that the -- the taxpayer was

11

entitled to group its products, to figure out export

12

income not in gross, but on the basis of each product or

13

recognized product line, which is what Boeing did here.

14

And if the Court would look at (6)(iv) in the

15

middle of page 33a, you'll see that the regulations

16

provide that the taxpayer's choice as to how to group is

17

controlling -- controlling.

18

say that costs deductible in a particular year shall be

19

allocated and apportioned to the classes of gross income

resulting from such grouping.

Mr. Jones, before I lose the thread

MR. JONES:

No.

If it were done on a

transactional basis, which is the -- the base case

provision under DISC, 861 regs would tell us how to

And what -- I mean, really the -- the first

But that's not the statutory

Well, this is kind of simplistic, but

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

it does seem that in -- in the 1970s, Congress wanted to

encourage exports, and to do that, they thought they

3

should make some income tax advantages for companies

producing products for export.

5

grouping of products and favorable income tax treatment

6

which, if you didn't have the -- the 861 regulations on

7

R&D, would allow the taxpayer to do what the petitioner is

8

arguing here.

9

And that involved allowing

So, it seems to me the argument is that the 861-

10

regs are just so contrary to DISC that they shouldn't

11

govern and don't govern.

12

MR. JONES:

Is that the thrust of it?

Oh, clearly that's not the case.

13

The 861 regs were -- were formulated for the purpose of

14

determining combined taxable income for DISCs and FSCs.

15

That's what Congress -- that's what the committee said

16

they wanted the Secretary to do under the DISC, and that's

17

what the 861 -- if you look at 861(f)(1)(iii), it says

that expressly.

there too?

No, no.

I want to know what your

position is.
MR. JONES:

18

Well, my position is they've totally

19

misdescribed the grouping provision of the DISC regs, and

20

once you understand it, you will appreciate that the 861-8

21

regs apply to all of these transactions.

22

you can see that by looking at only two pieces of the DISC

23

regs.

24
25

And you can --

The DISC regs, at page 29a in the middle of the
page, says, grouping of transactions for purposes of

applying the pricing method is provided by (c)(7).

2

you group to decide what your pricing method is, and if

3

they choose the -- the combined taxable income method,

4

which they've done here, then you go to (c)(6), which is

5

back on page 33a.

6

So,

(c)(6) says here's how you determine combined

7

taxable income.

You take the income.

You deduct the

8

costs of goods sold, and then you allocate under

9

provisions of -- of section 861 regs.

And then the

10

provision that Mr. Geller cites says -- is the (iv)

11

provision, which says you that allocate the costs to the

12

items of income resulting from the group.

13

grouping does.

14

It's the last phrase of the -- of

2

that the grouping is about.

That's all

Now, that's been the Secretary's interpretation

3
4

of his own regulations for 25 years.

And of course, under

5

this Court's precedents, his interpretation of his own

6

regulations is entitled to controlling weight unless it's

7

inconsistent with the provisions of the text of the regs.

8

And as the Tax Court explained in the St. Jude case, and

9

as I have just described, the text of the reg says you

10

allocate under 861 to the income resulting from the

11

grouping.
QUESTION:

12

All right, that's fine.

But he says

that -- and what you're supposed to do is you're supposed

MR. JONES:

4

QUESTION:

Right.
So we go to 861 -Right.
-- and he says, now, if you look at

5

861, and try to allocate according to 861 to the group

6

that they've picked out, it's seriously nuts, basically.

7

I mean, imagine that you had a farmer and the

8

farmer raised roses, and he had some fishes, and -- and

9

what he has is he does research on fish diseases.

And he

10

says -- you'd say, well, my goodness, you're going to

11

allocate his whole laboratory costs which does nothing but

12

fish diseases to the growing of roses because both are

13

farming or fisheries.

14

Now, is it -- something like that is really out

15

of whack, it makes so little sense that that isn't a

16

reasonable method of allocation under anybody's theory.

18

MR. JONES:

That's -- that's a fair synopsis of

their position, and -- and the defects in it --

19

QUESTION:

Right.

20

QUESTION:

So why is it reasonable to allocate

21
22

the fish disease research to rose culture?
MR. JONES:

Well, let me start with what the

23

Secretary was supposed to do in the regs, and get to you

24

the answer to your question.

25

The -- the statute on which the regs are adopted

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

2

definitely related to the product in determining what

3

costs would be charged against it.

allocate to it a share of costs that cannot definitely be

allocated to any particular item of income.

6

It also says you

Now, when the conundrum for research costs --

7

and the reason that we have a separate regulation for it

8

is that there's more than one way that research costs are

9

treated under the code.

When research costs are

10

capitalized and amortized over their useful life, they're

11

then properly attributed -- as this Court said in

12

INDOPCO -- to the revenues as they're received.

13

the taxpayer makes the election that section 174 gives it

14

to take a current deduction, it severs any relationship

statutory default cases -- you can apply it against all

income.

to make you apply it only against a subcategory of income,

It clearly

And so my -- my point was that if it would have

been reasonable for the Secretary to just do what the

statute says, which is we'll apply it against all income,

19

it's more reasonable, the Secretary decided, to apply it

20

against a smaller category.

21

years later, the Secretary decided it was even more

reasonable to -- to apply it against a somewhat narrower

is reasonable.

First, it only -- that only applies
So -- so we've narrowed

And when they're deducted under 174,

Now, the reason I keep stressing that point is
because this Court's decisions are very clear that the

Court, especially in the context of Treasury regulations,

11

doesn't sit here to decide the wisdom of the particular

12

rule chosen.

13

to see whether some reasonable method was applied, not

14

whether this was the best one, or the most logical --

15

It only -- in the words of Correll -- looks

QUESTION:

Yes, but it seems to me that what

16

you're doing is -- is quarreling with the decision

17

Congress made under 174.

18

something that ought to be capitalized, but we think it's

19

so important, it's going to be expensed.

20

saying that, well, you know, really it can't be expensed.

21

We're going to, in effect, make them capitalize it anyway.

22

That -- that's --

23

MR. JONES:

No.

Congress said R&D is inherently

And you keep

We're -- we're not making them

24

capitalize it.

I mean, I would cite, really, my

25

explanation of that as Justice Souter's question earlier,

46
Alderson Reporting Company

that -- which is that the -- the decision to allow this

current deduction is effective in determining taxable

income for domestic purposes.

4

there's a deduction, but I'll point out 861 -- the mere

5

fact there's a deduction doesn't tell you how to allocate

6

it.

7

definitely related to some item of income, then you charge

8

it against all the items of income.

And the -- 861 says that if the deduction is not

QUESTION:

9

We don't dispute that

Can -- can I come back to the Blue

10

Sky expenses?

A question that was asked earlier caused me

11

to question my understanding of the case.

12

As I understand it, Boeing is willing to accept

13

a ratable portion of the Blue -- Blue Sky expenses in its

14

DISC.

Right?

15

MR. JONES:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

They actually want to --

Just a -- what it -- what it's

17

objecting to is -- is those expenses that -- you know,

18

that -- that go to fish research, those expenses that are

19

identifiable to a particular category.

20

MR. JONES:

Just to elaborate, that go to fish

21

research that that -- that were deducted currently rather

22

than amortized over the proper future income.

23

that's what this case is really all about is this

24

peculiarity --

25

QUESTION:

That's --

But that's the whole scheme that

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Congress passed in the '70s to try to encourage exports.

2

So it just -- the interpretation of 861 in the regs seems

3

to go somewhat contrary to the overall purpose of the

4

scheme for DISCs.
MR. JONES:

5

Several -- several courts have

6

correctly said that the purpose of the -- of the combined

7

taxable income calculation is to serve as a limit on the

8

DISC and FSC benefits.

9

benefits.

Congress didn't intend unlimited

They didn't intend to allow benefits of the

10

type that Boeing is seeking where they inflate their

11

foreign source income by not -- not putting the costs

12

against that income in calculating it.
And so, the answer to your question is no.

13

The

14

Secretary's rule is designed to accomplish the correct, in

15

the Secretary's view, determination of combined taxable

16

income for this very purpose.
Now, it -- I think that -- that the issue

17
18

that -- that may actually be the one the Court wants to

19

consider first is that in 1984, when Congress enacted the

20

FSC provision, it -- it in our view ratified and adopted

21

the very cost -- research cost allocation regulation that

22

we have in this case.

23

of 1984, there are two provisions that relate to this

24

case.

25

course, is based on the provisions of the DISC, and -- and

In -- in the Deficit Reduction Act

Congress adopted -- enacted the FSC which, of

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

it also contains the combined taxable income method of

2

limiting the -- the benefit.

3

that they adopted the FSC, they enacted a provision that

4

took one piece of this regulation out and suspended it.

5

That's the piece called geographic sourcing.

6

purposes of citation, is 1.861-8(e)(3)(ii).

7

And -- and at the same time

That, for

This case is about 1.861-8(e)(3)(i), which is

8

the rule that calculates combined taxable income.

And

9

when Congress took out -- said we're going to suspend this

10

geographic sourcing rule in this regulation, they said,

QUESTION:

Can I -- Mr. Jones, can I go back for

just a second -- and be sure I understand something

19

right -- to the fish/roses hypothetical?

20

assuming that the fishes -- the research on the fishes

21

would be charged to the DISC only if fishes and roses were

22

in the same SIC grouping?

23

MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

25

Am I correct in

Under any scenario, that's correct.
Oh.

So if they're in a different

grouping, then the rose farmer wouldn't have to pay for

MR. JONES:

That's one

It's not -- it's -- the point is

it's not as broad as the statutory default rule.

It says that --

2

QUESTION:

Got you.

3

MR. JONES:

Okay.

4

Now, on the ratification point, Lorillard v.

5

Pons makes the point that when Congress enacts a statute

6

that's based upon a -- a prior -- the provisions of a

7

prior act, it is assumed to have adopted the -- the

8

administrative interpretation.

9

itself an overpowering presumption, but what Lorillard

Now, that's not a -- by

10

pointed out was that when Congress, in doing that, looks

11

at the agency's interpretation and excised a portion of

12

it, the inference that it approved the remaining part is

13

very strong.
Now, here, it's strong not only because of that

14
15

inference, but because Congress said -- I'm sorry -- the

16

committee that made this amendment said that they --

17

although they were excising this part about geographic

18

sourcing, that the part about combined taxable income

19

calculations for DISCs and FSCs would remain in effect.
Now, petitioner says, but 2 years later Congress

20
21

did something that somehow negates at that ratification.

22

Well, of course, the sub -- Congress can't change the law

23

as ratified, but that's not what happened in '86 in any

24

event.

25

what was -- that was removing the suspension of the -- on

What happened in '86 was that the -- the committee

whether the regulation is valid or not.

regulation that they were talking about was the geographic

about the whole rule.

purposes.
QUESTION:

12

Correct me if I'm wrong.

In the

13

court of appeals opinion -- and it's the paragraph at

14

12(a).

15

the court of appeals said, the more narrowly a taxpayer

16

chooses to define incomes, the more costs become

17

indirectly or indefinitely related.

trying to understand that, or --

I think you'll be familiar with this one, where

MR. JONES:

Can I be excused from

Well, I can try to help, but I'm --

21

I can't promise results.

It -- it looked to me like what

22

they had in mind was the thought that this -- that a

23

taxpayer who says my research only relates to wing nuts

24

on -- on this plane is -- is defining it so narrowly that

25

it's not realistic.

And -- and indeed, the record of this

Alderson Reporting Company

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. GELLER:

So much to say.

6

Justice Kennedy, I think you put your heart on

7

the -- on the Government's -- the -- the problem with the

8

Government's position here.

9

to accept the fact that Congress created a number of

It's simply an unwillingness

10

incentives here that were not designed simply to raise

11

revenue.

12

the -- the beneficial treatment of export income and also

13

the immediate deductibility of -- of R&D.

14

They had other purposes such as the export --

Now, the Government tries to defend this

15

regulation here on the -- on the basis that there's this

16

temporal mismatch and it's all the result of not

17

capitalizing.

18

I should say a number of things about that.

First, this was not the basis for the regulation

19

at the time the regulation was issued.

It was not the

20

basis for defending this regulation in the lower courts.

21

And it -- and the Government's position is not even

22

consistent with that regulation because if the whole

23

problem here is the lack of a temporal mismatch, you would

24

think that if you had a class of gross income in which in

25

a particular year there was both revenues and R&D

55
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

expenses, well, in that situation there's no temporal

2

mismatch.

3

R&D expenses to that revenue in that year.

4

there's revenue in a class of gross income in a particular

5

year, they still insist that those R&D expenses be spread

6

across all of the income in that SIC code.

They would at least allow you to allocate those
No.

Even if

7

Now, I want to mention St. Jude, because in this

8

case we're dealing with airplanes and airplanes, and while

9

the -- the costs are specifically allocated only to

10
11

particular programs, it gets a little more complicated.
But look at St. Jude.

In St. Jude, you had a

12

manufacturer who was exporting artificial heart valves.

13

That's all it was doing, is manufacturing and exporting

14

artificial heart valves.

15

engaging in R&D for insulin pumps, and for pacemakers.

16

The Government insisted that the export income from the

17

sale of those heart valves be reduced, and that the DISC

18

benefit be reduced because of the R&D spent on these other

19

products that obviously had no basis or relevance to the

20

sale of the heart valve simply because they were all

21

within the broad -- same broad SIC code.

22

In the same year, it was

And I should say, Justice Kennedy, the Ninth

23

Circuit's opinion I think is somewhat unintelligible.

24

The -- the part that you -- you referred to, we all

25

stumbled over because it makes no sense.

The more

gross income, the more that -- that costs will be directly

allocated to more than one class of income.
