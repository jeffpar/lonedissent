CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

next in Number 01-1127, Bill Lockyer v. Leandro Andrade.

Mr. Danzig.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS P. DANZIG

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. DANZIG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Ninth Circuit's grant of habeas relief in

10
11

this case should be reversed for two reasons.

12

court erred in setting aside the State court judgment

13

because it did not properly apply the principles of habeas

14

corpus review to cases that are considered under the

15

AEDPA.

16

this Court yesterday, Early v. Hill and Woodford v.

17

Visciotti, this case is resolvable on AEDPA grounds and

18

therefore the Court need not address the constitutional

19

issues in this case.

20

First, the

As confirmed in two concurring opinions issued by

In any event, independent of the habeas corpus

21

aspects of this case, the sentence in this case is not

22

grossly disproportionate and therefore does not violate

23

this -- the Eighth Amendment.

24
25

Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2254(d), a Federal court
may not grant habeas relief unless the State court

3

1

determination on the merits was either contrary to, or

2

involved an unreasonable application of this Court's clear

3

controlling precedent.

4

held that the State court determination involved an

5

unreasonable application.

6

QUESTION:

In this case, the Ninth Circuit

Despite the Ninth --

Is this the case in which the Ninth

7

Circuit first decided for itself the constitutional

8

question, and then decided whether the State court had

9

reasonably applied it?

10

MR. DANZIG:

Yes, that is correct, Your Honor.

11

Despite the Ninth Circuit's holding in this

12

case, a careful analysis of the Ninth Circuit's opinion

13

here reveals that although they reversed, or granted

14

habeas relief, reversing the district court on

15

unreasonable application grounds, the fact of the matter

16

is this, all of the reasoning lends itself to a contrary-

17

to analysis rather than an unreasonable application, and

18

opposing, or the respondent has, in fact briefed the

19

contrary-to prong of the 2254 as well as the unreasonable

20

application prong.

21

For example, the -- and for the most part the

22

circuit court held that holding was based on the

23

conclusion that the State court merits determination erred

24

because it did not consider the three-case triumvirate of

25

Rummel, Solem, and Harmelin, and faulted the State court

4

1

for failing to apply, or essentially disregarding Solem,

2

but as Early v. Packer made clear yesterday, on -- when we

3

are talking about a contrary-to application, it's not

4

necessary for the State court to have cited this Court's

5

controlling authority, and it's not even necessary for the

6

Court to be aware of it, and in fact the State court in

7

this case cited, or provided what we call a Lynch analysis

8

under California law, which incorporated virtually every

9

aspect of the Solem analysis that the State court said --

10

pardon me, that the Ninth Circuit said the State court

11

disregarded.

12

So on that basis alone, and I think Early

13

makes -- the per curiam opinion in Early makes clear that

14

that's okay if you have an application of State law, or

15

you rely on State law that provides even greater depth of

16

analysis than the Federal rule would require, and that's

17

what happened here.

18

would be comparable to the second and third prongs under

19

the Solem analysis, which, following Harmelin, are deemed

20

no longer required unless -- and serve only to validate an

21

initial inference on the first prong, so this was clearly

22

not a contrary-to case.

23

QUESTION:

The Lynch analysis requires what

The court -- the State court --

May I just ask on that point, do you

24

think there was not even the need to look at the second or

25

third elements of the test because there is not even a

5

1

basis for saying this sentence was grossly

2

disproportionate?
MR. DANZIG:

3
4
5

that.

Yes, Justice Stevens, I agree with

I think that there is no inference -QUESTION:

In other words, the case could be

6

decided on the ground that there's -- an inference of

7

gross disproportionality should not be drawn in this case?

8
9

MR. DANZIG:

That's correct, Your Honor, I do

agree with that, and on the Eighth Amendment, the pure

10

Eighth Amendment question, that there was no inference of

11

gross disproportionality here, and therefore the second

12

and third prongs were not required, but the State court

13

did, in fact, apply a second and third prong analysis, and

14

that leads into the only portion of the Ninth Circuit's

15

opinion that really addresses the reasonableness of the

16

State court's decision.

17

The Ninth Circuit disposed of the unreasonable

18

application analysis in a footnote, and it basically said

19

that the State court's reliance on State law is irrelevant

20

because it didn't cite Federal law, and I think that the

21

decision yesterday in Early v. Hill kind of renders that

22

particular portion of the analysis --

23

QUESTION:

Would you just refresh my

24

recollection on the facts of this case, because the prior

25

argument, the argument was made that violence was the

6

1

critical matter in the prior conviction.

2

violence in the earlier, in the priors in this case?

3

MR. DANZIG:

Were there

The record does not indicate

4

whether there were or not, Your Honor.

The priors that

5

were the predicate for the three strikes sentence were

6

both residential burglaries, and there -- we have no facts

7

concerning them in the record, but the gravamen, as we all

8

know, of a residential burglary is the potential for

9

danger and violence that comes from invading someone's

10

home, and also subsequent to this case being decided quite

11

recently, the California legislature amended its statute

12

and now includes a residential burglary where the house is

13

occupied in its articulation of violent felonies.

14

longer just confined to the serious felony --

15

QUESTION:

It's no

Do you agree with your colleague in

16

the prior case that violence is a critical element in the

17

priors or not?

18

MR. DANZIG:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. DANZIG:

No, I do not, Your Honor.

Okay.
Not to be overly inconsistent

21

between our mutual arguments, but I think this Court has

22

held that the presence or absence of violence does not

23

necessarily dictate the proportionality analysis.

24

may be circumstances where a crime is of sufficient

25

gravity that doesn't involve violence, such that extremely

7

There

1
2

long sentences are appropriate.
QUESTION:

I agree on the merits that we can't

3

convert this Court into a sentencing commission, but it's

4

also true, I guess, that there must be some way of

5

deciding when a State has gone too far, and I don't know

6

any way that's other than highly subjective, except to

7

look at data that would show what happened in the past,

8

but if you take that, how do you give the State the right

9

to become harsher in the future?

10

Now, you're going to say, well, it has that

11

right, and of course it does to a degree, but is there a

12

way to say that it has to meet some burden, or that it has

13

to show something if it's going to change dramatically

14

what was the consensus in the past --

15

MR. DANZIG:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. DANZIG:

I don't think that --

-- in a harsh direction?
I don't think that the fact that

18

it's going to change dramatically is determinative or

19

dispositive, but I do think, Justice Breyer, that there

20

are a couple of responses to that question.

21

First of all, turning back to one of the

22

questions Justice Souter asked in the prior argument, I

23

believe that when the State is going to define certain

24

felonies as being sufficiently serious to trigger the

25

imposition of the three strikes, or three strikes approach

8

1

or harsher sentencing, I think a rational basis -- the

2

courts may be required to engage in a heightened scrutiny

3

analysis to determine whether there's a rational basis for

4

that in the first place.

5

But I think that's distinct from any

6

proportionality analysis, and the problem with the

7

hypothetical that you pose is that, while you are correct

8

that there is a subjective prong to this, the question is,

9

where does that subjectivity belong?

Is it within the

10

particular personal subjective views of the reviewing

11

court, or is it within the confines of the subjective

12

views as reflect -- that the legislature represents of the

13

subjective views of the citizenry?

14
15

QUESTION:

It has to be the latter, but still

there has to be a way of deciding when they go too far.

16

MR. DANZIG:

17

QUESTION:

In other words -And that's what I'm looking for, and

18

I look to -- you know, what I've said before as a way of

19

isolating the problem, and then -- and I think here you

20

might say that on the merits of your case, it'll -- you'd

21

be hard-pressed to find many examples outside of the three

22

strikes laws where there were such sentences given for

23

such things.

24

MR. DANZIG:

25

QUESTION:

I --

I think so.

I mean, there are a

9

1

handful in the SG's brief, that's true.
MR. DANZIG:

2

I understand your question, Justice

3

Breyer, to basically go to what is grossly

4

disproportionate.

5

QUESTION:

That's right.

6

MR. DANZIG:

And the Court, this Court has not

7

defined that term, or given us any clear guidelines, but

8

we do know that by the very nature, grossly

9

disproportionate implies an extreme situation, and -QUESTION:

10

Suppose we were to find -- and

11

there's argument in this about the briefs both ways, but

12

suppose we were to conclude that this has likely been a

13

most effective scheme, that it's reduced the crime rate in

14

the State of California.

15

the time.

16

simple thing that they can understand, and that it works.

17

The prisoners talk about it all

They know what three strikes means.

It's a

If we made that finding, and there -- your

18

adversaries will disagree that that's true, but if we made

19

that finding, does that bear on whether the sentence is

20

disproportionate?

21

MR. DANZIG:

Not really, because I suppose -- I

22

mean, in an extreme example, Justice Kennedy, we could

23

lock up everybody for extremely long periods of time, and

24

it could still go past that point of proportion, of gross

25

disproportionality.

I think there has to be a more clear

10

1

definition than simply the impact of the sentencing

2

statute, and -QUESTION:

3
4

Well, what's your limiting principle

here?

5

MR. DANZIG:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. DANZIG:

The limiting --

Is there one?
The limiting principle we offer is,

8

or we urge upon the Court is the one that's been mentioned

9

in a -- or has been used as related to an example

10

mentioned in a couple of the Court's opinions, when they

11

refer to lifetime for parking, and the reasonable mean --

12

understanding of that example is often cited as a life

13

sentence for a first-time parking --

14

QUESTION:

But that --

15

QUESTION:

Excuse me, what is your limiting

16
17

principle?

I haven't heard it.

MR. DANZIG:

The limiting principle would be

18

that those are, that sentences are grossly

19

disproportionate when they are not reasonably susceptible

20

to debate amongst reasonable minds.

21

QUESTION:

But --

22

QUESTION:

You seem to be --

23

QUESTION:

-- in this particular case it's 50

24
25

years for stealing some tapes, right?
MR. DANZIG:

No, Your Honor, I -- Justice

11

1

Stevens, I disagree with that.

2

sentence for stealing tapes, it is two 25-years-to-life

3

sentences.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. DANZIG:

6

QUESTION:

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. DANZIG:

It is not a 50-year

But they're consecutive.
They are consecutive.

Well, why isn't that 50?

Because I think it's important to

9

bear in mind two things in reaching that conclusion.

10

First of all, they represent independent episodes of

11

criminal behavior.

12

the impact of resulting in a 50-year sentence, but it --

13

but they do reflect the fact that the -- Mr. Andrade in

14

this case demonstrated beyond any question that he is a

15

habitual offender.

16

released, or booked and released and 2 weeks later he went

17

right back out and did the same thing.

They are not connected.

They may have

He was arrested and either cited and

Not only that, he told the probation officer

18
19

that he stole the tapes in order to sell them to buy

20

heroin, not as gifts for his children, but to buy heroin

21

with.

22

and that he always does something stupid when released

23

from prison, and I think the reasonable inference of what

24

he meant was, he always goes out and recommits crimes, so

25

I think that's part of why it's not a 50-year --

He also indicated he was a hopeless heroin addict,

12

1
2
3

QUESTION:

Well, is he being punished because

he's a heroin addict or because he stole these tapes?
MR. DANZIG:

He's being punished because of his,

4

of a combination of his record of recidivism and his -- or

5

his habitual criminal behavior.

6

The other reason I think it's important to make

7

the distinction between the two 25-to-life sentences

8

versus characterizing it as 50-to-life for receiving, or

9

for stealing some tapes is because of the ameliorative

10
11

effects of the California sentencing structure.
QUESTION:

But in light of the answer that you

12

gave to my question, and then to Justice O'Connor's about

13

what is the standard, I'm now at somewhat a loss as to how

14

to defend your statute under the incapacitation and

15

deterrence theory.

16

That's quite a surprising answer to me.

17

whole point of this statute was that we wanted something

18

that works.

19
20
21
22

That doesn't bear on proportionality?

MR. DANZIG:

I think that the --

Then proportionality has to be judged

against the legislative objective, I should think.

23

MR. DANZIG:

24

QUESTION:

25

And I agree, Your Honor, and if I

misstated that, I did not mean to.
QUESTION:

I thought the

Absolutely, Justice Kennedy.

Well, then, then the question that I

put to you does bear on proportionality.

13

The premise I

1

put to you does bear on proportionality, that we need a

2

system that's simple but works, that reduces crime in the

3

State, and you told me, oh, well, that means we could lock

4

up everything, everybody so you can't use that.

5

MR. DANZIG:

6

QUESTION:

7

But we don't lock up everybody.

That's not the three strikes statute.
MR. DANZIG:

8
9

No, I did not mean --

I did not mean to imply that it

doesn't bear on proportionality, I certainly believe that

10

it does.

I simply said that standing alone, without any

11

further consideration, that would also justify an extreme

12

example, but yes, I do believe that it does bear on

13

proportionality in light of the legislative purpose of the

14

statute, but in measuring that legislative purpose, I do

15

believe that what's reasonable -- sentences, evaluating

16

sentences on whether they are reasonably susceptible to

17

debate also provides a framework or a lens with which to

18

look, to apply that analysis.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Danzig --

20

QUESTION:

Okay, but if we do that --

21

QUESTION:

-- if we can just back up, I think

22

you started out by urging that we not do what the Ninth

23

Circuit did in terms of the order.

24

that there was a violation of the Eighth Amendment, and

25

then it determined whether we had clearly established law.

14

It first made a ruling

1

MR. DANZIG:

2

QUESTION:

That's correct.

You are urging that we not reach any

3

ultimate decision on the Eighth Amendment question, but

4

simply decide that however you come out on that, the --

5

there was no violation of clearly established Federal law.
MR. DANZIG:

6

Not exactly, Justice Ginsburg.

We

7

are saying that the case is disposable on AEDPA grounds,

8

but if the Court found that the State court merits

9

determination was unreasonable, it necessarily would have

10

to turn to the Eighth Amendment issue.
QUESTION:

11

Yes, but which -- the Ninth Circuit

12

said it's appropriate in these cases to decide the Eighth

13

Amendment question first.

14

Should we follow in line with what the Ninth Circuit did,

15

or should we say the proper thing to do is to find out

16

whether it's an unreasonable interpretation of clearly

17

established Federal law, and if it isn't, that's the end

18

of it?

19

MR. DANZIG:

What is your view on that?

The latter, Justice Ginsburg.

20

methodology that the Ninth Circuit has developed as

21

articulated in Van Tran is inconsistent with the very

22

spirit of the AEDPA.

23

QUESTION:

The

Well, it's also inconsistent with our

24

idea that we try to avoid constitutional questions if we

25

can, isn't it?

15

1

MR. DANZIG:

2

QUESTION:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

But you said earlier that you thought

3

the proper analysis was contrary to, rather than

4

unreasonable application, and how can you decide whether

5

something's contrary to a rule unless you know what the

6

rule is?
MR. DANZIG:

7

I would like to clarify that,

8

Justice Stevens.

I didn't say that the proper analysis in

9

this case was contrary to.

I said that the Ninth Circuit

10

purported to reach an unreasonable application prong, but

11

when you look at their reasoning, it actually is a

12

contrary-to argument that they made, and I meant to say

13

that when -- if -- to the extent that it is a contrary-to

14

decision that they made, no matter the fact that they

15

ultimately labeled it unreasonable application, this

16

Court's per curiam decision yesterday in Early v. Packer

17

has essentially resolved that question, because of what

18

they base their decision on.
QUESTION:

19

I'm not sure you've answered my

20

question.

It seems to me that we have to decide whether

21

or not -- regardless of what the Ninth Circuit did, I

22

think one of the things we have to decide is whether or

23

not the sentence in this case is contrary to a Federal

24

rule, and I don't know how we can decide that without

25

knowing what the Federal rule is, and I was asking for

16

1

your advice on that point.
MR. DANZIG:

2

The Federal rule I think is

3

articulated in Harmelin, and that is that grossly

4

disproportionate sentences violate the Eighth Amendment.
QUESTION:

5

But we have to identify that as the

6

Federal rule before we go on to decide whether it's

7

contrary to, I think.

8

that?
MR. DANZIG:

9

QUESTION:

10

Is that -- would you agree with

Yes.

You're -- I would.

That seems just the opposite of what

11

you responded to me earlier, that we don't have to decide

12

the Eighth Amendment question, that we can just decide

13

whatever the answer to that is, this was not off the

14

chart.

15

MR. DANZIG:

I don't think that we have to --

16

that it's necessary to resolve the Eighth Amendment

17

question, but it may be necessary to know what the rule is

18

before we know whether the State court selected

19

the right rule or not --

20

QUESTION:

But if we know what the rule is --

21

QUESTION:

Well, precisely we have to ask

22

whether there is a Federal rule.

23

what it is.

24

pronounced Federal rule.

25

We don't have to know

The question is, is there a clearly

MR. DANZIG:

Correct.

17

1
2

QUESTION:

And the answer to that may well be

no.

3

MR. DANZIG:

4

QUESTION:

5

In which case we have no occasion to

pronounce on what the Federal rule is.

6

MR. DANZIG:

7

QUESTION:

8

Correct.

All we have to say is that there is

no clearly enunciated Federal rule here.
QUESTION:

9
10

In many circumstances it may be.

Can I go back for a second to the

merits of this?

11

MR. DANZIG:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

Because I -- we all have -- my

13

problem that I'm struggling with is, is there an objective

14

standard.

15

is I'm having, and I tend to -- do look to this empirical

16

stuff as a way of finding an objective standard, and if

17

here the empirical part suggests this is way out of line,

18

I'm now faced with the question, well, can't the State

19

make a harsher system if it has a reason for doing it, and

20

I think the answer to that question must be yes.

21

You're absolutely right about what the problem

But then -- then I'd ask, very well, doesn't the

22

State have to come up with some reason that's persuasive

23

in this case that it makes a difference to extend the

24

three-strike thing with this kind of thing in mind, this

25

kind of case in mind, to the wobblers?

18

1

I mean, is there some punitive purpose in terms

2

of incapacitation that's gained, of a significant kind, by

3

increasing the wobbler sentences by factors of, you know,

4

multiples of four or five or 10 or something, over what

5

they would have been before when committed by serious

6

criminals, and I guess the answer to that is, there's no

7

indication, or is there?

8
9

MR. DANZIG:
begs the question.

The -- I think you can't -- that

It cannot disassociate the wobbler

10

offense that's at issue in this particular case from the

11

recidivism.

12

QUESTION:

No, no, I'm not.

I'm only

13

considering the class of recidivists, and I'm saying --

14

let's call them recidivist plus wobbler, all right.

15

group of people, recidivist plus wobbler, is getting an

16

enormous increase in sentence over what was or is any

17

other place, on average, and therefore I think, gee, maybe

18

this is really grossly disproportionate.

19

MR. DANZIG:

20

recidivists.

21

that class -QUESTION:

23

MR. DANZIG:

24
25

But it's a certain class of

It's not just recidivists in general.

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Danzig --

2

QUESTION:

I don't understand why a parking

3

offense wouldn't qualify if a man is on parole, and any

4

breach of parole is always emphasized as being

5

particularly bad, and one of the things he can't do is

6

engage in parking in no-parking zones, and if he did that

7

in breach of a parole, and he had nine prior cases, I

8

don't know why you couldn't impose your three-strike

9

penalty on the overtime parker.

10

MR. DANZIG:

11
12

The -- if the California

legislature chose -QUESTION:

It says, any violation -- it put it

13

in as a wobbler, any violation of a parole condition by a

14

person who's on parole.

15

MR. DANZIG:

16

It's a parole revocation issue.

17

QUESTION:

That is not a wobbler offense.

It would not, because the other, in

18

the other case they emphasized the fact he'd been on

19

parole a number of times, what -- his violations were

20

parole violations.

21

parole violation relevant to our inquiry at all?

22

Is the fact that whether or not it's a

MR. DANZIG:

It is in the sense that the Court

23

has held that when doing a proportionality analysis, his

24

entire criminal picture can be taken into consideration.

25

We're not -- the Court is not required to confine the

21

1

analysis only to the predicate and triggering offenses, so

2

in that sense it does -- it is an indication of continued

3

habitual criminality and an unwillingness to remain

4

law-abiding.

5

QUESTION:

I think you're saying --

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Danzig, there is something

7

missing in this case that was present in the other.

That

8

is, the judge in the -- Mr. Ewing's case was asked to

9

reduce the wobbler to a misdemeanor, was asked to strike a

10

strike and she said no, it's not within the spirit of the

11

three-strikes law.
Here, the California Court of Appeals seemed

12
13

almost nonplussed that there had not been such requests

14

timely made to the trial judge, and twice the court of

15

appeal said it would still be open to Mr. Andrade to

16

pursue on State habeas both pleas, that is, the wobbler

17

should be reduced to a misdemeanor, a strike should be

18

out.

19

Mr. Andrade?

20

Do you agree that that avenue of relief is open to

MR. DANZIG:

Yes, but it requires an

21

explanation, Your Honor.

22

ask the court for misdemeanor treatment under California

23

Penal Code section 17(b).

24
25

QUESTION:

He -- Mr. Andrade did, in fact,

He didn't repeat it at the time of

sentencing.

22

1

MR. DANZIG:

No, he did not, Your Honor, but

2

there is an odd chronological history here that's just --

3

that distinguishes this case.

4

The California Court of Appeal, or -- pardon me.

5

The judgment came down in this case a few weeks before the

6

California Supreme Court issued its decision in Romero

7

granting trial courts the discretion to dismiss priors, so

8

in the California Court of Appeals decision, they noted

9

that that Romero decision had said that if you got a

10

record that you can't determine whether the sentencing

11

judge knew whether he had or not -- he or she had

12

discretion to dismiss the strikes, then the proper basis

13

for addressing that is through State habeas.

14

Mr. Andrade then filed a petition for review to

15

the California supreme court which was denied, and without

16

prejudice to file a State habeas corpus petition based on

17

Romero, which he did.

18

a habeas corpus petition -- pardon me.

19

State habeas corpus petition -- pardon me.

20

State habeas corpus petition which was entertained by the

21

same sentencing court that had sentenced him, and that

22

court said that it did not find that he was appropriate

23

candidate for dismissing the strikes.

24
25

He went back to State court, filed
He did not file a
He did file a

Curiously, though, that court also noted that if
it felt that it read the law as having discretion to

23

1

impose concurrent rather than consecutive sentences, it

2

might consider it.

3

was just kind of dicta within the court's, the sentencing

4

court's decision.

5

That wasn't an issue at the time.

It

Ultimately, though, about a year later, the

6

California supreme court issued another case called People

7

v. Garcia in which the supreme court said that sentencing

8

courts have a right to dismiss strikes on a count-by-

9

count basis, and Mr. Andrade has never asked by any

10

vehicle for a reconsideration of that issue, so in theory

11

he could go back at this point and file another State

12

habeas corpus petition and ask for what we would call

13

Garcia consideration, and -- which, based on what the

14

court, the sentencing court had previously indicated, the

15

court might be inclined to grant him, which would reduce

16

this sentence if, assuming it was applied to one of the

17

counts, to a 25-year-to-life sentence.

18

QUESTION:

Would you object to that relief?

19

MR. DANZIG:

We would not concede the issue,

20

but -- and I'm not saying that we would necessarily oppose

21

it, but it is available to him.

22

position on that if and when it was -- he made that

23

application.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN CHEMERINSKY

5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

6
7
8

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Today, the State of California asks this Court

9

to disregard and essentially to overrule a century of

10

decisions that have held that grossly disproportionate

11

penalties violate the Eighth Amendment.

12

is grossly disproportionate, it's that which was imposed

13

on Leandro Andrade.

14

QUESTION:

If any sentence

A century of decisions?

15

decided this since I've been on the Court.

16

longer than I thought, I guess.

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

19
20
21
22

I thought we

I've been here

I'm sorry, Justice Scalia, I

didn't hear the question.
QUESTION:

You say there -- for a century we

have been engaged in proportionality analysis?
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Yes, Your Honor.

In Weems v.

23

United States in 1910, this Court said that sentences must

24

be graduated in proportion to the offense.

25

in Harmelin v. Michigan, seven Justices -- and Justice

25

Most recently,

1

Kennedy's opinion becomes the rule of Harmelin --

2

prescribed a three-part test based on Solem v. Helm for

3

deciding if a sentence is cruel and unusual punishment.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Chemerinsky --

5

QUESTION:

I don't think that's quite accurate,

6

Mr. Chemerinsky.

I think if you were to take points,

7

decisional points, you would look at Rummel on one side,

8

and then Solem moves away from that, and then Harmelin

9

moves back towards Rummel.

10

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Chief Justice Rehnquist, each

11

of the cases said it's consistent with all of the cases,

12

and each of these cases cites to Weems v. United States as

13

saying that grossly disproportionate punishments violate

14

the Eighth Amendment.

15

QUESTION:

What do you do as a State court judge

16

trying to apply our cases when you take those three cases?

17

I mean, it isn't a very obvious answer, is it?

18

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Your Honor, many State courts,

19

and virtually every circuit has said that Justice

20

Kennedy's opinion from Harmelin becomes the rule of

21

Harmelin, because in United States v. Marks it was the

22

narrowest ground that a majority agreed to, and of course

23

Justice Kennedy's opinion is simply a modification of the

24

three-part Solem test.

25

QUESTION:

Well, it -- Justice -- I've just read

26

1

it over, and it cites Rummel more often than it cites

2

Solem.

3

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

4

QUESTION:

Your Honor --

So the point that I think you need to

5

address is the AEDPA point.

6

of California way out of line, or whatever the test is,

7

you know, improperly applied --

8

(Laughter.)

9

QUESTION:

10

That is, is the supreme court

-- in the light of these cases.

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Yes, Your Honor.

Under this

11

Court's decision in Williams v. Taylor, in Bell v. Cone

12

and yes, in Early v. Packer, there are two ways in which a

13

Federal court can grant habeas relief.

14

that it is contrary to clearly established Federal law.

15

The other is to find that it's an unreasonable application

16

of clearly established Federal law.

17

here, and all --

18

QUESTION:

One is to find

Both are present

But one must find in either case

19

clearly established Federal law, and frankly that's my

20

problem when you cite Weems.

21

statements in our cases, but most of them come out

22

rejecting the claim, and you cited Weems.

23

extraordinary case because it involved not simply hard

24

labor, but hard and painful labor.

25

penalty that was foreign to Anglo-American law, and if

There are lots of grand

27

That was an

It was a kind of a

1

that's the one example before we get to Solem, you really

2

don't have anything concrete to go on.

3

grandly general statements.
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

4

You just have

Your Honor, there are cases

5

prior to Solem that found sentences to be cruel and

6

unusual punishment.

7

for example --

In Robinson v. California in 1962,

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

10

That was a status crime.
Yes, Your Honor, and it did

find a violation of the Eighth Amendment.
QUESTION:

11

But you're not saying, are you, that

12

being an habitual criminal is like being a drug addict or

13

a drunk?

14

drugs is not a crime?

15

That is, just being drunk, just being stoned on

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No.

My point, Your Honor, is

16

that this Court has repeatedly said that grossly

17

disproportionate sentences violate the Eighth Amendment,

18

and the cases that I mentioned say that.

19

QUESTION:

In addition --

That's what they say, but you've

20

given Robinson as an example, and that's a case where I

21

thought the Court said there was no crime, not that it was

22

cruel and unusual punishment for a crime.

23

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Yes, Your Honor, and what I'm

24

simply saying is, these are examples which the Court has

25

repeatedly said that grossly disproportionate sentences

28

1

violate the Eighth Amendment.

2

QUESTION:

Did the California courts contradict

3

that?

Did the California courts here say, grossly

4

disproportionate crimes don't violate the Eighth

5

Amendment?
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

6

Yes, Your Honor.

The

7

California Court of Appeals, and you find this in the

8

appendix to the cert petition, said it questioned whether

9

gross disproportionality analysis would be applied, and it

10

questioned whether Solem v. Helm analysis applied, and

11

therefore the California Court of Appeals did not apply

12

the three-part test from Solem v. Helm and the three-part

13

test that comes from Justice Kennedy's opinion in

14

Harmelin.

15

And in answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, it

16

is those cases that announce the test that should have

17

been applied, and those cases are clearly established law.

18

QUESTION:

Your opponent says that the

19

California court relied on a Lynch analysis, which is a

20

State court doing much the same thing.

21

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No, Your Honor --

Do you disagree with that?
I do disagree.

First, the

24

California Court of Appeal expressly said it was not going

25

to do gross disproportionality analysis.

29

It did not do

1
2

Solem analysis.

It did not do Harmelin analysis.

QUESTION:

Well, I realize that, and my question

3

to you was, if the California court said we're going to do

4

a Lynch analysis, is that substantially the same thing?

5

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No, Your Honor.

The

6

California Court of Appeal said the test under California

7

law is whether the sentence, quote, shocks the conscience.

8

That is a quite different test than the objective test of

9

Solem and Harmelin, which is carefully calibrated

10

determining whether a sentence is grossly

11

disproportionate.

12

Also, the three factors used by the California

13

Court of Appeal under the Lynch analysis were quite

14

different than the Solem analysis.

15

comparison of the gravity of the offense to the harshness

16

of the punishment.

17

similar punishments in the same jurisdiction.

18

First, there was no

Second, the court did not look to

In California, the punishment for rape would

19

have been 8 years in prison, the punishment for

20

manslaughter would have been 11 years in prison, the

21

punishment for second degree murder would have been 15

22

years in prison, and he received 50 years to life.

23

fact, if his prior offenses had been rape and murder, he

24

could have at most gotten a year in jail.

25

In

This goes to Justice Stevens' question earlier.

30

1

His prior -- his crime here was the misdemeanor of

2

shoplifting.

3

first to petty theft with a prior, and then it triggered

4

the three strikes law, but in order for it to be petty

5

theft with a prior, there has to be a prior property

6

offense.

Because of double-counting it was elevated

7

If his prior crimes had been rape and murder,

8

then his maximum sentence for stealing these videotapes

9

would have been a year in jail.

It's because his prior

10

offenses were property crimes that the double-counting

11

could occur.

QUESTION:

12
13

Additionally -I thought your opponent, or perhaps

the representative of the State, said that was not so.
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

14

No, Your Honor.

The confusion

15

here is that with regard to petty theft, petty theft, the

16

misdemeanor can become the wobbler petty theft with a

17

prior under California Penal Code section 666 only if the

18

prior crime is a property crime, and if you look at

19

California Penal Code section 66, it enumerates just

20

property crimes.
QUESTION:

21

Mr. Chemerinsky, I thought that what

22

made the petty theft in this case into a wobbler was not

23

the crimes that were listed as strikes, but another petty

24

theft.

25

Is that not true?
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Yes, Your Honor.

31

They used a

1

petty theft, but they also used the burglaries to convert

2

the petty theft to a petty theft with a prior, and then

3

they used the petty theft with a prior to trigger the

4

three strikes law.

5

QUESTION:

I thought they used -- they didn't --

6

there was a second petty theft.

7

8

the crime of conviction the petty theft with a prior.

9

that wrong?

10

That was the crime of

I thought there was an earlier one that made

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

That is correct.

Is

However,

11

Your Honor, under California Penal Code section 667(g) any

12

prior felonies must be pled and proven, and the only prior

13

felonies here that were ever mentioned were the

14

burglaries, and as a result, simply because of stealing

15

$152 worth of videotapes in those burglaries, he received

16

a sentence of 50 years to life, and under the third prong

17

of the rule of Harmelin.

18

QUESTION:

Well, is it not so that a judge

19

having the two strikes that are listed, and also having

20

the full record of the crimes that this person has

21

committed, that that's relevant to the discretion the

22

judge has to strike a strike, or to say I'm not going to

23

treat that petty theft as a felony, the petty theft with

24

prior as a felony.

25

I'm not going to do that.

There was in this case, was there not, in

32

1

addition to the two strikes, some serious criminal

2

activity?

3

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No, Your Honor, they played no

4

role in the sentence here, and the reason, as I said, is

5

the California Penal Code says any prior felonies must be

6

pled and proven.

If you look at the felony complaint --

7

QUESTION:

I didn't ask you about --

8

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

9

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

-- the ones that count as strikes.

10

I asked you about the sentencing judge who has discretion

11

could say, looking at -- if that's all we had on this

12

record, I'm not going -- I'm going to exercise my

13

discretion to knock down the wobbler to a misdemeanor.

14

I'm going to knock out a strike.

Isn't that in effect

15

what sentencing judges would do?

They would look not

16

simply to the two strikes that are formally pled, but this

17

person's entire record.

18

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Your Honor, that not what

19

occurred here.

20

on page 37 of the Joint Appendix, you'll see that the

21

sentencing judge made no mention to anything other than

22

the three burglaries.

23
24
25

If you look at the sentencing transcript

QUESTION:

Well, isn't he presumed to know what

the record is?
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No, Your Honor, because

California Penal Code requires an order, for it to be

2

considered a strike, it has to be pled and proven.

sentencing judge focused it just on those burglaries.

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

There was a probation report,

20

but because under California law prior strikes have to be

pled and proven, because only the burglaries were

mentioned, there's no reason here for the judge --

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No.

Only the burglaries were

2

QUESTION:

Were proven?

3

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

The jury, on pages 18 and 19

4

of the joint appendix, found the burglaries, thus there

5

was no reason for Andrade to challenge the contents of the

6

probation report, and the judge never mentioned the

7

probation report.

And the other thing that makes this case, I

think, quite unique is no other State in the country would

10

impose a punishment like this on Andrade.

QUESTION:

They're saying, I take it, on this

16

point that let's think of the class of serious criminals,

17

and we've decided in California to tell all people in that

18

class one more crime, you've had it.

19

Now, they have to define one more crime, and so

20

where they choose to draw the line is the line not before

21

you get to wobblers, but the line after you get to

22

wobblers, and they say that takes jay-walking and parking

23

offenses and everything and says, we're not talking about

24

those, we're talking about these, and what the other side

25

is arguing is, that's within the legislative discretion

35

1

that the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause must give.

2

All right.

3

Why isn't it?

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Justice Breyer, the reason

4

this case is different is the underlying conduct here is a

5

misdemeanor that's double-counted in order to become the

6

basis for a life sentence.

7

Scalia even invoked the distinction between misdemeanor

8

and felony.

9

principle that --

-- they say, there are felonies which

14

are not wobblers, and they're quite serious.

15

wobblers which are medium-serious, and there are those

16

things that can't even wobble.

17

where we choose to draw the line is between the last --

18

you know, between -- below the wobblers and not above.

19

What's wrong with that?

There are

17

Andrade never committed any violent offense.
QUESTION:

18

Leandro

But in that, there's nothing in

19

Harmelin as I reread it that indicates that you must

20

preclude or prescind from that analysis, that initial

21

analysis, the fact that there is a recidivist element

22

here.

23

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Of course.

Recidivism is part of the analysis.
It is, and recidivists can --

37

1

QUESTION:

So we're not just talking about gum

2

balls.

3

breaking and entering with knives and so forth.

4

We're talking about all of the offenses, including

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

But Leandro Andrade never was

5

accused or convicted of breaking and entering with knives

6

and in fact, Your Honor, even if you look at all of his

7

offenses, his criminal pattern is virtually identical to

8

that of Helm in Solem v. Helm.

9
10
11

I would go back to Chief Justice Rehnquist's
question -QUESTION:

On that matter, what about what Judge

12

Sneed said in his dissent in the Ninth Circuit when he

13

pointed out that there was much in this criminal history

14

record in addition to the two strikes, including Federal

15

marijuana transportation offenses and a parole violation

16

for escape from Federal prison?

17

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

First, Your Honor, as I said

18

before, there's no indication that those were ever

19

considered, nor could they be by the sentencing court, but

20

second, Your Honor, even if you consider all of those,

21

then his criminal record is virtually identical to Helm's

22

in Solem v. Helm, and this does go to Chief Justice

23

Rehnquist's initial question.

24
25

One way that this Court has said that you can
find that a penalty or a sentence is contrary to clearly

38

1

established Federal law is if a State court ignores a

2

decision that is on all fours.

3

QUESTION:

Solem v. Helm --

Well, on all fours, on that point, is

4

there any decision where a term of years was struck down

5

as disproportionate?

6

sentence.

7

Solem, I take it, was a life

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Your Honor, in Solem v. Helm

8

it was a life sentence, but there's nothing in Solem or

9

Harmelin that indicates that disproportionality analysis

10

is only where there's no possibility of parole.

11

were the analysis, then a State could avoid

12

disproportionality review just by calling every life

13

without possibility of parole a 75-year sentence.

14

QUESTION:

If that

If the question is what's clearly

15

established, and if I'm a trial court judge, I'll look to

16

see what the court did, not grandly general statements

17

that it made about constitutional principle, and if I --

18

if my investigation led me to find that no, there has not

19

been a single case in which a term of years has been

20

struck down, then I might assume that the law for terms of

21

years is not clearly established.

22

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Your Honor, Solem v. Helm

23

answers that question.

Here, Leandro Andrade received an

24

indeterminate life sentence with no possibility of parole

25

for 50 years.

That is the functional equivalent of the

39

1

sentence that Helm received in Solem v. Helm, and yet the

2

California Court of Appeal expressly said it would not

3

apply Solem v. Helm.
QUESTION:

4

Mr. Chemerinsky, the difficulty that

5

I have with your argument is, number 1, the point that

6

Justice Ginsburg made, but a further point that has come

7

out this morning.
When we are asking whether there is clearly

8
9

established law, I think we've got to take into

10

consideration something that has become clear from, I

11

think has become clear from this argument, and that is

12

that there is a question as to whether the test is

13

genuinely a proportionality or a gross disproportionality

14

test, or whether that is simply an example of a kind of

15

rational basis test, because we've had this difficulty in

16

fitting the recidivism into the structure of

17

proportionality analysis, and I think what tends to come

18

out in the answers that we've gotten this morning is,

19

there's more than just proportionality which is being

20

considered here.
If that is true, if that is a fair

21
22

characterization of the way our reasoning is working, then

23

don't we have great difficulty in saying that there was

24

clearly established law simply by looking to Solem and to

25

Harmelin?

40

1

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No, Your Honor.

The reason

2

is, two things were clearly established at the time the

3

California Court of Appeal decision came down, first, that

4

grossly disproportionate sentences violate the Eighth

5

Amendment, and the court said it questioned it, didn't

6

apply it, and second, the test that's supposed to be used,

7

the objective test from the rule of Harmelin -- from

8

Solem v. Helm, and the court did not apply that three-

9

part test, and in that way the court acted contrary to

10
11

clearly established law.
Also, since Solem v. Helm is really factually

12

indistinguishable in this case, the court acted contrary

13

to in not following, and in addition --

14

QUESTION:

You're saying that if the law is

15

going to become unclear, it's going to be as a result of

16

what we say this morning, as -- rather than what we have

17

said before.

18

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Yes, Your Honor, at least

19

with -- insofar as gross disproportionality violates the

20

Eighth Amendment, and the test for gross

21

disproportionality being clearly established, and the

22

California courts followed neither of those.

23

QUESTION:

Well, do you -- Mr. Chemerinsky, do

24

you -- do you think that Solem v. Helm was as strong a

25

case after our decision in Harmelin as it was before?

41

1

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Yes, in two ways.

First, the

2

three-part test that it prescribes is still followed,

3

though Justice Kennedy's opinion from Harmelin says

4

there's only a need to consider the latter two prongs if

5

there is an inference of gross disproportionality

6

comparing the gravity of the offense to the harshness of

7

the punishment.
And second, no subsequent case, including

8
9

Harmelin, has ever ruled, overruled Solem v. Helm, so -QUESTION:

10

Well, but do you think a State court

11

judge is acting unreasonably if he says we have three

12

cases, Rummel, Solem, and Harmelin, and it just isn't

13

quite all that clear?
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

14

No, Your Honor, I think that

15

is unreasonable here, because the California Court of

16

Appeal applied only Rummel, but in footnote 32 in Solem,

17

the Court said that Rummel is confined to its facts,

18

because it's before the three-part test.
QUESTION:

19
20

Yes, but then Harmelin goes ahead

and, as I say, cites Rummel more often than it does Solem.
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

21

And Rummel remains good law

22

insofar as result, but Harmelin affirms the three-part

23

test.

24

test.

25

This Court has repeatedly affirmed that three-part

QUESTION:

Although it didn't apply it, although

42

1

it said, we don't have to go beyond the first step, and it

2

said, you might get to those others in exceedingly rare

3

cases.

4

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

5

QUESTION:

6
7

That's correct, Your Honor --

And I suppose what you are telling us

is, this is that rare case.
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

This is that rare case,

8

because in this instance, a man who had never committed a

9

violent crime received an indeterminate life sentence with

10

no possibility of parole for 50 years for stealing a small

11

amount of videotapes.

12

QUESTION:

May I ask this question that's -- is

13

a practical one, is, in view of what I referred to before

14

that Judge Sneed brought out in his dissent, if any of

15

those other activities could have been priors, wouldn't a

16

resentencing here likely yield the very same result,

17

except that this time the prosecutor would spell out what

18

that entire course of conduct was?

19

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

I think, Your Honor, that

20

there is very little likelihood, based on all of the

21

California cases, that a resentencing would lead to a

22

different result here, so in that sense I agree with you,

23

and that's why it really is a constitutional issue.

24

an indeterminate life sentence for this conduct, even

25

taking into account his recidivism, justify the penalty

43

Does

1

that was received here?
This Court has prescribed exactly the objective

2
3

factors to be considered, and to treat stealing $153 worth

4

of videotapes more seriously than second degree murder

5

doesn't even meet a rational basis test, and it is an

6

unreasonable application, and in that way, this case -QUESTION:

7

Well, it wasn't that they were

8

treating this person as someone whose prior record

9

warranted incapacitating him.

They weren't merely

10

punishing a single offense.

11

or they were incapacitating a person that they found to be

12

an incorrigible offender.
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

13

They were punishing a person,

Based on three burglaries that

14

were 13 years earlier, and twice shoplifting a small

15

amount of videotapes, and that's why our argument is that

16

this is that rare case where it is grossly

17

disproportionate punishment to in essence -QUESTION:

18

But that case hasn't been seen yet.

19

This would be it.

20

thinking there has been no case since Harmelin where we

21

have said that a sentence is grossly disproportionate, and

22

no lower Federal court has struck down a sentence since

23

then?

24
25

This -- there has been -- am I wrong in

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

It is correct that this Court

has not found any sentence to be grossly disproportionate

44

1

since Harmelin -- you've not dealt with this issue since

2

Harmelin -- but there are lower court cases.

3

a year ago the Eighth Circuit in Henderson v. Norris found

4

a life sentence for possessing a small amount of cocaine

5

was grossly disproportionate, applying the rule of

6

Harmelin and also applying the Solem v. Helm test.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

9
10

For example,

Was that a recidivist case?
I don't think it was a

recidivist case, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Has there been a recidivist case

11

since that trilogy that you recited?

12

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

There are State courts that

13

have found recidivist sentencing structures to violate

14

United States Constitution, but there are not -- then

15

those would also involve recidivists, and those would have

16

applied both Solem and Helm.

17

The West Virginia Court in State v. Deal, for

18

example, found a recidivist sentencing structure to be

19

cruel and unusual punishment.

20

appeals in People v. Gaskins came to the same result, and

21

that also explains why this case is different than Early

22

v. Packer, which you decided yesterday, and there the

23

criticism was that it was a situation where the State

24

court didn't cite to or mention the controlling Supreme

25

Court decision.

The Colorado court of

45

1

Here, the California supreme court said it was

2

rejecting the test prescribed by this Court, rejecting the

3

test from Harmelin v. Michigan, which is a very different

4

situation than this case.

5

QUESTION:

What were the words that it used?

6

don't think it was that strong.

7

whether those -- that was still good law.

8

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

I

I thought it questioned

Yes, Your Honor.

wording from the court was the question.

The exact

The exact

10

wording was, and I quote to you from page 76 of the

11

appendix to the cert petition, however, to the extent that

12

the defendant suggests that proportionality analysis

13

applies under both the State and Federal Constitutions, we

14

must question that assertion, and then the court said, on

15

the same page, the current validity of the Solem

16

proportionality analysis is questionable.

17

And having said it was questionable, the court

18

then did not apply the rule that grossly disproportionate

19

sentences violate the Eighth Amendment.

20

apply the Solem analysis, the rule of Harmelin that the

21

court identified in Harmelin v. Michigan, and it was the

22

failure of the court to apply the controlling test, it was

23

the failure of the court to follow the controlling

24

precedent --

25

QUESTION:

Well --

46

The court did not

1
2

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

-- that made the decision

contrary.
QUESTION:

-- they say, Mr. Chemerinsky, on that

4

same page, they say that the Solem proportionality

5

analysis is questionable in the light of Harmelin against

6

Michigan.

7

refusing to apply Harmelin.
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

8
9
10

But Your Honor, they then did

not apply the three-part test that Justice Kennedy
articulated, which is the rule of Harmelin -QUESTION:

11
12

They certainly weren't saying they were

But I thought you said they simply

refused to follow Harmelin.

13

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

14

QUESTION:

Well, they didn't --

I -- you're not meaning, then, that

15

they expressly refused to follow Harmelin, you're saying

16

that, in fact, they didn't use the same formula as

17

Harmelin suggested?
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

18

Well, that's correct, Your

19

Honor, they didn't use in any way the three-part test from

20

Harmelin.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

23
24
25

But -All they did was analogize to

Rummel v. Estelle.
QUESTION:

That was not the Court's test, that

was Justice Kennedy's test, which you say was the lowest

47

1

common denominator.

You think it's clearly established

2

law that where you have a split decision, the lowest

3

common denominator is the law of the land?

4

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

5

QUESTION:

6

proposition myself.

7

In United States --

I think that's a highly controverted

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Your Honor, in United States

8

v. Marks this Court described how to determine the rule

9

when there is no majority opinion, but especially here,

10

where Justice Kennedy is simply slightly modifying a prior

11

test from Solem v. Helm, the law is clearly established.

12

QUESTION:

Not an opinion of the Court, an

13

opinion of Justice Kennedy, and you say that all the

14

States' courts have to accept the proposition that that is

15

the law of the land?

16

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Your Honor, virtually every

17

circuit has said that is the rule of Harmelin, but

18

especially so here, where it is simply slightly modifying

19

a test that's been on the books for 20 years, since

20

Solem v. Helm, that says three considerations are used to

21

calibrate whether a sentence is cruel and unusual.

22

QUESTION:

So Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke

23

is the law of the land, and you think that that is

24

generally accepted?

25

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

My sense is you're going to

48

1

have occasion soon enough to deal with that issue --

2

QUESTION:

Understood.

3

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

4

(Laughter.)

5

QUESTION:

-- but --

My point is that the proposition is

6

not, is simply not well-established, that you must accept

7

a less than majority opinion of the Supreme Court as being

8

the law of the land so long as it's the lowest common

9

denominator.

10

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Your Honor, I think there's

11

three reasons why it is.

12

United States v. Marks describes how to determine what the

13

holding is.

14

First, this Court's opinion in

Second, every circuit -- and we cite this in our

15

brief -- refers to the rule of Harmelin, and virtually

16

every State that's considered it refers to the rule of

17

Harmelin, which shows that it's clearly established.

18

And third, the Solem v. Helm test was not in any

19

way overruled.

20

adhered to the Solem test.

21
22

Seven Justices in this Court in Harmelin

QUESTION:

But they split 4 to 3 as to what the

test required in that case, didn't they?

23

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

24

QUESTION:

25

But seven Justices --

So you -- doesn't that throw some

doubt as to how closely you follow that?

49

1

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No, Your Honor.

Seven

2

Justices agreed that grossly disproportionate sentences

3

violate the Constitution.

4

protective standard for criminal defendants, but seven

5

Justices clearly adhered to that.

6

to the Solem v. Helm test.

7

QUESTION:

Four would apply an even more

Seven Justices adhered

But doesn't that suggest that the

8

test isn't that clear if they apply it and three come out

9

one way and four come out the other?

10

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Your Honor, often Justices

11

will disagree, but the question here is, is the rule

12

clearly established, and the rule that grossly

13

disproportionate sentences violate the Constitution, the

14

rule that there's an objective three-part test, is what is

15

the clearly established law, and Your Honor, if any

16

sentence is grossly disproportionate, it's this case.

17

The punishment here isn't just cruel and

18

unusual, it's cruel and unique.

The State can't point to

19

even one other person in the history of the United States

20

who has received a sentence of 50 years to life for

21

shoplifting a small amount of merchandise.

22

California this sentence would be regarded as quite --

23

much larger than, say, second degree murder, manslaughter,

24

rape, which shows that it is a grossly disproportionate

25

punishment.

Mr. Danzig, you have 4 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS P. DANZIG

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

Thank you, Mr. Chemerinsky.

MR. DANZIG:

Thank you.

Given the limited time,

7

there are just a couple of brief points I would like to

8

make about respondent's argument.

9

I think it's clear that when he's arguing that

10

the proportionality analysis has to be confined to the

11

predicate offenses and the triggering offense, without

12

regard to the entire record, what he is essentially doing

13

is raising a facial challenge to the statute despite the

14

fact that the Ninth Circuit claimed that they were not

15

invalidating the statute, and to that extent that any

16

facial challenge can be made, the ameliorating provisions

17

of the California scheme would result in a finding that

18

the statute is not -- in -- unconstitutional on its face.

19

Secondly, just as a points, a couple of points

20

of correction -- the Court has already touched upon it --

21

the court of appeal did not question whether the

22

proportionality analysis was correct.

23

whether Solem's version of the proportionality analysis

24

was still correct.

25

it still went ahead and applied a proportionality analysis

It questioned

That's what the State court did, and

51

1
2

via a State court decision of Lynch.
And in terms of whether gross disproportionality

3

was addressed or not, the State used, or the State court

4

used a standard articulated from Lynch, which is shocks

5

the conscience, and it is much stronger language and is at

6

least reasonably a euphemism for grossly disproportionate.

7

Also, I will find the page in just a moment, but

8

I believe at the sentencing hearing the judge did indicate

9

that he had considered the probation report.

10
11

It's in the

joint appendix, and I will find the cite in a moment.
Ultimately, if there's any doubt about whether

12

there's clear precedent or not, the -- I think that the

13

State court determination should be given deference in

14

this case, and almost finally, not -- Andrade did not

15

receive life for three burglaries and two petties, he

16

received that because the ameliorating provisions go into

17

the analysis, and as he was not granted the benefit of any

18

of them, and in fact hasn't even asserted one of them, he

19

did not receive that sentence for that, for strictly life

20

for three burglaries and two petties.

21

based on his overall record.

He's received it

22

In terms of whether there are -- anyone else in

23

California has suffered a similar sentence, while we -- I

24

have no reference to any 50-year-to-life sentences based

25

on two convictions, there are 300 and -- approximately 344

MR. DANZIG:

I think that under the California

grants the first-time offender an opportunity to reform.
