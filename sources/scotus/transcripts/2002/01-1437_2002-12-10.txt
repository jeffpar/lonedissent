ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT B. McDUFF

8

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS/CROSS-APPELLEES BRANCH, ET AL.
MR. McDUFF:

9
10
11

Justice Stevens, may it please the

Court:
For 40 years, ever since the decision in

12

Baker versus Carr, State court judges, like Federal

13

judges, have played a role in addressing constitutional

14

problems stemming from malapportionment.

15

reflected in Scott versus Germano in 1965, and again in

16

Growe versus Emison in 1993 when the Court said not only

17

that State judges play a role, but they are preferred to

18

Federal judges as agents of reapportionment.

This was

19

In this congressional redistricting case from

20

Mississippi, the Chancery Court of Hinds County, acting

21

with the blessing of the Mississippi Supreme Court,

22

stepped into the breach and adopted a plan when the

23

legislature defaulted.

24

Federal district court, and the United States Department

25

of Justice has said not once, but twice that it was

That plan has been enjoined by the

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

postponing the statutory time period for preclearance

2

under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act so that even now,

3

nearly 1 year after the plan was adopted and submitted, no

4

preclearance decision has been made.

5

order is in place telling State courts they may not hear

6

congressional redistricting cases.
QUESTION:

7
8

A Federal court

Now, did -- did Mississippi appeal

from the injunction?
MR. McDUFF:

9

They did not, Your Honor, but we

10

did.

11

defend the State court judgment, which my clients had a

12

right to seek, and which they did secure redistricting the

13

State of Mississippi.

14

And we were allowed to intervene in this case to

QUESTION:

But -- but the issue is whether the

15

State was still pursuing the -- the redistricting that was

16

the subject of the application to the Attorney General,

17

and whether it was doing so or not depended upon whether

18

the State was appealing from the Federal injunction.

19

If the State accepted the Federal injunction, it no longer

20

was pursuing the -- the reapportionment.

21

MR. McDUFF:

I don't -- I don't know -- I

22

respectfully disagree, Justice Scalia.

This is a State

23

court order, and the Attorney General of Mississippi has

24

no right to refuse it or not, and he certainly has no

25

right to undo it.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Well, and he also has no right to

2

ignore a Federal injunction --

3

MR. McDUFF:

4

QUESTION:

That's correct.
-- unless he -- unless he appeals it.

5

He has every right to appeal it.

6

and he chose not to appeal it.

7

MR. McDUFF:

He represents the State,

That's correct, but -- but unlike

8

the situation -- but we -- I guess my first answer is, we

9

did appeal it, and so the injunction is --

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. McDUFF:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

But you're not the State.
-- is subject to being overruled.
The problem with that is that you're

not the State.
MR. McDUFF:

That's correct.

But unlike a

15

situation where, for example, an injunction is issued

16

against a criminal law, or regulatory provision that the

17

Attorney General, or the State defendants have some

18

discretionary authority to enforce, and where it makes

19

sense that if they do not want to appeal, no one else

20

should be allowed to appeal if they're not -- if they

21

don't care enough about enforcement, this is an order that

22

the Attorney General, and the State defendants are

23

required to obey, assuming Federal obstacles are

24

eliminated.

25

Now, if the Attorney General doesn't appeal for

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

whatever reason, it makes sense to allow the people who

2

secured the judgment in State court to intervene and

3

defend that.

Otherwise --

QUESTION:

4

Why does it make sense under a

5

statute in which the action of the State is by -- by

6

definition crucial?
MR. McDUFF:

7

Because the action of the -- the

8

action of the State here is the action of the State

9

courts, and they have issued an injunction.

10

The Attorney

General cannot undo that.
QUESTION:

11

But if we're talking about section 5,

12

the language of section 5 is whenever a State shall enact

13

or seek to administer any voting qualification, et cetera.

14

And because the State is not currently seeking to

15

administer anything, enact, I take it means legislation.

16

Seek to administer could be the executive, but the

17

executive, since it's not appealing the injunction, isn't

18

currently seeking to administer anything.
MR. McDUFF:

19

I think -- I think the executive is

20

seeking to administer it just as much as he was back when

21

the plan was first submitted.

22

are removed -- the constitutional injunction, and the

23

preclearance obstacle -- the State defendants are going to

24

abide by the order of the chancery court, and submit this

25

plan --

If the Federal obstacles

1

QUESTION:

But we would -- we would not require

2

the -- the State or the -- the Federal courts to do a

3

vain -- or the Attorney -- the Federal Attorney General to

4

perform a vain act.

5

approve the reapportionment when the State Attorney

6

General is still subject to a Federal court injunction

7

which he has not appealed and therefore cannot ignore?

8

What possible good would it be for the Attorney General

9

to -- to approve the -- the apportionment?

What use would it be for him to

MR. McDUFF:

10

To remove the section 5 obstacle as

11

quickly as possible, consistent with the 60-day deadline

12

in the statute, so that once the constitutional obstacle

13

is removed, the plan can be in force.
QUESTION:

14

But the constitutional obstacle won't

15

be removed as long as the Attorney General doesn't --

16

doesn't appeal the Federal court injunction.
MR. McDUFF:

17

Well, that -- that is assuming

18

that -- that my clients don't have standing, and I think

19

we clearly do as parties who secured the State court

20

judgment.

21

the Attorney General could unilaterally nullify the State

22

court injunction simply by not defending it.

23

reason my clients were allowed in this case, was to defend

24

the State court injunction they secured.

25

Otherwise, you would be in a situation where

QUESTION:

That's one

Mr. McDuff, can I ask you what is the

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

status of the State court litigation?

2

pending there?
MR. McDUFF:

3

Is there an appeal

There is an appeal pending filed by

4

the State court intervenors challenging the chancery

5

court's plan.
QUESTION:

6
7

And how do you explain the failure of

the Mississippi Supreme Court to rule on that appeal?

8

MR. McDUFF:

That -- the briefs have been filed.

9

No oral argument is scheduled.

I think -- I -- I don't

10

know, but I think the Mississippi Supreme Court is waiting

11

to hear from this Court what it should do because it is

12

looking at a Federal court order telling it it has no

13

business in congressional redistricting.

14

the -QUESTION:

15
16

Well, excuse me.

Is our decision

going to affect that Federal court order?

17

MR. McDUFF:

18

QUESTION:

19

And the --

I'm sorry?
Is our decision going to affect that

Federal court order?
MR. McDUFF:

20

Well, we -- we are certainly asking

21

this Court to -- to vacate the Federal court order.

22

And --

23

QUESTION:

It's a -- that's the problem I have

24

trying to figure this out.

Suppose -- suppose we looked

25

at the preclearance, and suppose I thought that it hasn't

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

been precleared and it should have been.

2

it hasn't been precleared is the reason that's been

3

discussed, that -- that they haven't tried to administer

4

it yet and when -- and they -- and the Department has

5

60 days from the time that the State tries to administer

6

it.

7

doesn't it, that they have --

8
9

And the reason

I mean, I thought that's what the statute says,

MR. McDUFF:

It says 60 days after it's

submitted, it's --

10

QUESTION:

Yes, enacts or seeks to administer.

11

MR. McDUFF:

12

QUESTION:

That is correct.
They have to enact, and this doesn't

13

sound like an enactment.

It sounds like something -- seek

14

to administer, and they haven't sought to administer it.

15

All right.

16

Then the Department would have to decide whether

17

to preclear it.

18

happens next?

19

So then we'd send it back.

Well, they may well preclear it.

Or what

That's where I'm a little confused.

I mean, it -- the -- the real constitutional

20

issue here -- or one of them anyway -- is assuming there

21

is the preclearance, then has the Mississippi court acted

22

unconstitutionally in assuming authority to issue a plan,

23

whereas previously, the Mississippi court had said you

24

lack -- we lack that authority.

25

have an order here which seems to overrule in earlier

And all of a sudden, we

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

cases, and it doesn't even have an opinion.
In other words, can you help clarify what we

3

should say in this case on the assumption that we ended up

4

thinking it should be precleared?

5

MR. McDUFF:

I think -- I think there are two

6

things we want you to say.

7

court's constitutional basis for the injunction is wrong,

8

and that Mississippi courts, like courts -- like courts

9

throughout the country, do have a right to adjudicate

10

congressional redistricting cases, at least where the

11

legislature defaults.

12

First is that the Federal

And then, second, we are asking you to rule that

13

as a result of the passage of the 60-day period, the plan

14

has been precleared.

15

If you agree with us on the first issue,

16

disagree on the second, then the -- then the matter will

17

be remanded to the district court and the preclearance

18

process --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. McDUFF:

21
22

But Mr. McDuff, the --- will go forward in the Justice

Department.
QUESTION:

Mr. McDuff, on your first point,

23

which you would like us to decide first, I thought the

24

district court expressly made that a contingent ruling.

25

Didn't it say if we're wrong on that this plan hasn't been

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

precleared, if we're wrong, then we have this alternate

2

constitutional point.

3

say, we would like the court to understand that our

4

principle ruling is that this plan hasn't been precleared.

5

MR. McDUFF:

6

QUESTION:

They phrased it that way as if to

That's correct.
But if we're reversed on that, then

7

we have something else we want the court to know about.

8

So, it seems to me that it was a highly conditional

9

ruling, the kind of ruling, let's say, that a -- that a

10

trial court would make under rule 50, when it

11

conditionally rules on a new trial motion.

12

MR. McDUFF:

I don't know if it was a

13

conditional ruling, Justice Ginsburg.

14

alternative ruling, and we are appealing both grounds.

15

And I think it makes perfect sense to deal with them both

16

in one appeal rather than --

17

QUESTION:

Why?

It was an

It makes perfect sense to reach

18

the constitutional issue when there's no need to do so?

19

I mean, if -- if we agree -- if -- if we disagree with you

20

on the second point, there's no need for us to -- to rule

21

on -- on the first point.

Is there?

22

MR. McDUFF:

23

QUESTION:

By the same token --

24

QUESTION:

Whether -- whether or not the -- the

25

Well --

Federal district court used it as a makeweight, there's

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

just no need for us to reach it.

2

QUESTION:

Well, there are two questions I had.

3

First of all, was it proper for the district

4

court to decide a constitutional issue which was totally

5

unnecessary to support its judgment?
MR. McDUFF:

6

The -- I -- I think it was, and

7

I do think it is necessary to reach that issue because

8

otherwise, we're going to go -- if -- however you rule

9

on the section 5 issue, the case goes back down.

10

Hopefully the plan is either declared precleared by this

11

Court or later precleared by the Attorney General.

12

the district court is simply going to reinstate that

13

constitutional ruling.

14

on appeal, and we'll be into the 2004 election cycle.
QUESTION:

15
16

The --

This case will come back up here

All right.

That's -- that's true,

but look, there's a case, Wise v. Lipscomb --

17

MR. McDUFF:

18

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
-- which you've seen, and in that

19

case, this Court says, in those circumstances -- which are

20

these -- until clearance has been obtained, a court should

21

not address the constitutionality of the new measure.

22

we said specifically, don't address it.
Now, what -- what are we supposed to do about

23
24
25

So,

that?
MR. McDUFF:

That -- that's correct, Your Honor,

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

but the cases from which that statement emanates, and the

2

only cases in which this Court has been called upon to

3

apply that principle are Connor versus Waller, and

4

United States versus Board of Supervisors of Warren

5

County, which we discuss at the beginning of our reply

6

brief.

7

from this one.

8

courts substituted constitutional analysis for the

9

preclearance process and -- and ordered the use of un­

10
11

But those are cases that are very different
In those cases, the Federal district

precleared plans.
Here the Federal district court enjoined the use

12

of a -- an allegedly un-precleared plan and gave an

13

alternative ruling the same way courts do -- the -- in the

14

same fashion that courts do all the time.

15

circumstances, I think it makes sense to go ahead and deal

16

with both issues on the appeal so we don't have this case

17

bouncing up and down the appellate ladder while, number

18

one, the Mississippi Supreme Court is trying to figure out

19

what to do, and number two, we've got a March 1, 2004

20

deadline approaching.

21

QUESTION:

And in these

Is there any chance the

22

legislature -- which is its job, I take it -- will, in

23

fact, enact a plan during that period of time?

24
25

MR. McDUFF:

I -- there's certainly no

indication that the legislature will, Your Honor.

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

And --

1

and that's why it is important for -- as -- as the Court

2

said in Growe v. Emison, for State courts to be able to

3

step into the breach, and deal with the problem without

4

the sort of obstacles that the Federal court has imposed

5

here, first on the constitutional grounds, and then

6

second, on the section 2 grounds because we contend the

7

plan has been precleared.

8

And let me respond to one other thing --

9

QUESTION:

So I -- I take it --

10

MR. McDUFF:

11

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.
-- the State court would have to make

12

the same constitutional determination, or the State court

13

isn't free from making constitutional determinations.

14

MR. McDUFF:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

That -- that's right.

The --

In fact, just the opposite.

It

has to.
MR. McDUFF:

That's right.

But if this Court

18

resolves the issue on the -- in -- in reviewing the

19

Federal district court's injunction, then the State court

20

will not be in the position of having to do that.

21

And the -- the -- I want to go back to the

22

question of seeks to administer because I think it is

23

very clear that the Mississippi court -- the Mississippi

24

courts adopted a plan to be used in elections as long

25

as the section 5 obstacle is used -- is removed, and any

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

other Federal constitutional obstacles are removed.
And as -- as the opinion says -- Justice

3

O'Connor said in the opinion for the Court in Lopez versus

4

Monterey County -- the second Lopez decision -- seeks to

5

administer is simply -- it -- it's not necessarily a term

6

of discretion.

7

but is a -- it is a -- the seek is a temporal phrase

8

showing that the -- the plan should be submitted prior to

9

its administration.

You can either seek to administer or not,

10

And here, the Attorney General doesn't have any

11

discretionary authority, and I think it would be contrary

12

to section 5 if he were able to undo the chancery court's

13

order simply by the fact that he didn't appeal this case

14

when he knew we were appealing.

15

The -- in fact, there's -- we've referred

16

frequently to the North Carolina preclearance of the plan

17

adopted there by a State court regarding legislative

18

districts.

19

amicus brief, there is the letter of submission sent by

20

the trial judge in North Carolina to the Justice

21

Department where he submitted the plan.

22

General didn't submit it.

23

had opposed imposition of the State court plan during the

24

State court proceedings.

25

And if you look in the appendix to the NAACP

The Attorney

In fact, the Attorney General

That plan was precleared, and it certainly seems

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to me that if the Justice Department can preclear a plan

2

submitted by a State court judge, it cannot come here in

3

this case, and say that a State court judge -- a State

4

court plan from a Mississippi judge is -- has been

5

withdrawn, or has been suspended simply by the simple act

6

of -- simply by the simple fact that the Attorney General

7

did not take an appeal in this case.

us.

QUESTION:

But that was -- that was never an

issue in -- in the North Carolina case, was it?

MR. McDUFF:

17
18

That was taken by

I'm sorry?
That was never an issue in the North

Carolina case.
MR. McDUFF:

Oh, no, there was not an issue, but

I'm just pointing out that -- I mean -- I mean -QUESTION:

Maybe -- maybe Justice shouldn't have

taken the -- the request.
MR. McDUFF:

The -- the -- oh, I think Justice

19

should -- Justice definitely should consider a submission

20

from a State court judge.

21

QUESTION:

Sure.

Section -- section 5 says -But you were making the

22

argument a moment ago that if, in fact, they took the

23

request from the State court judge in North Carolina, they

24

can hardly object here.

25

MR. McDUFF:

That's correct.

16
Alderson Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

And that's a different kind of

2

argument.

And -- and since that was not an issue, I --

3

I don't know that they are precluded, or would be

4

precluded from changing their mind now.
MR. McDUFF:

5

Oh, all I'm -- all I'm saying,

6

Justice Souter, is I don't think they can come in here and

7

say that the fact that the Attorney General did not appeal

8

here -QUESTION:

9
10
11
12
13

No, that's -- that's not what they're

saying.
MR. McDUFF:

-- means that the submission was

withdrawn or suspended.
QUESTION:

They -- what they did not -- what

14

they did not object to is the fact that it was not the

15

Attorney General who had to submit the request here.

16

That's all.

17

they were not violating any provision of the statute which

18

required, before it could be precleared, that the State be

19

20

person, or the -- the entity of the State that is seeking

21

to administer it must be the one who applies for

clearance.

23

that was at issue in North Carolina is whether the -- the

administering person has to be the one to seek clearance.

I mean, in -- in the North Carolina case,

The statute doesn't say that the

That's not what the statute says.

So, all

that question.

of whether, when the State has no intention of

3

administering it, which is the situation here, and was not

the situation in North Carolina, the -- the Attorney

5

General, nonetheless, has to reply.

6

It certainly doesn't answer the question

MR. McDUFF:

Justice Scalia, I respectfully

7

disagree with the premise that the State in Mississippi

8

has no intention of administering this plan.

9

constitutional obstacle is removed, if it is, and once

Once the

preclearance is declared, if it is, the State defendants

11

are going to administer their plan -- that plan.

under a State court order to do so.

say that the Mississippi situation is somehow different

14

from the North Carolina situation is to -- is to exalt the

15

form over the substance.

They are

And it seems to me to

Certainly in Mississippi the State court judge

16
17

could have submitted that plan.

18

I guess, could have intervened in the case, in the Federal

19

case, and appealed if the Attorney General didn't.

20

that would be quite unusual, instead -QUESTION:

21
22

But

Could he have administered the plan?

That's --

23

MR. McDUFF:

24

QUESTION:

25

The State court judge,

I'm sorry?
That's the crucial question.

Yes, he

could do all that, but could he have administered the

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

plan?

If not, his intention to go forward is no

2

indication that the State is -- is seeking to administer

3

the plan.
MR. McDUFF:

4

But -- but, Justice Scalia, the --

5

the failure of the Attorney General to take an appeal is

6

no indication that he will not administer the plan once

7

the Federal obstacles are removed.

8

assume that he will obey the State court order.
QUESTION:

9

I think we have to

But does it remove the Federal

10

obstacle if -- instead of passing on the hypothetical of

11

whether the Federal ground, which is a alternative ground,

12

et cetera is good or bad -- if we just repeated the

13

language from Wise versus Lipscomb, said it's premature to

14

decide this constitutional issue, our cases say not to,

15

but there's an alternative ground here?

16

it clear to everybody, wouldn't it, that the ground on

17

which the Federal injunction rests is the preclearance

18

ground?

19

preclearance ground, we're going to administer it.

20

then, the 60 days would begin to run, and then you're out

21

from under this strange stalemate.

22
23
24
25

That would make

And then, would the State say, okay, if it's the

MR. McDUFF:

And

The -- the 60 days, in our view,

Justice Breyer, has already run.

I know that, but if I don't agree

with you about that, then would it satisfy what you're

1

really after which is to get out of the stalemate?

2

see, we would just simply point out that this is an

3

alternative ground and -- and it has no real -- we're not

4

reaching it because it's -- there's this other ground.

In other words, I'm repeating what I've said.

Then I -- I think -- I think -I'm trying to get you out of the

I'm trying --

MR. McDUFF:

I -- I think that gets us exactly

nowhere because the Department has said it is not going to

resume the preclearance process as long as the

constitutional injunction is in place.

QUESTION:

So unless it's

Are there two injunctions?

I thought

there was just one injunction and -MR. McDUFF:

I'm sorry.

There's one injunction.

Two grounds.
QUESTION:

-- two grounds.

So if we suggest

19

that one of the grounds was premature, then doesn't that

20

do the trick?

21

MR. McDUFF:

Well, I think it does -- it does

22

get the process ticking again.

23

point, once it is declared precleared, the Federal

24

district court will impose its constitutional injunction,

25

we'll be back up here.

But the problem is at that

Well, that's -- that's wishful

I'm sorry?
Is there any clue why, in all this

MR. McDUFF:

No.

I think it was the difficulty

of pairing two incumbents, and they couldn't agree.

couldn't agree on how to do it because we lost a seat in

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

AS AMICUS CURIAE

7

MR. FELDMAN:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:

8

It's our position that the State court

redistricting plan was not precleared on either of the two

10

occasions that appellants --

QUESTION:

Mr. Feldman, let's assume that we

Isn't the -- will the

It's --

-- and that's still an obstacle,

isn't it?
MR. FELDMAN:

If it's clear that this injunction

21

is -- rests only on section 5 grounds, and not

22

constitutional grounds, that certainly would --

23

QUESTION:

24

be to vacate the --

25

The only way to make that clear would

MR. FELDMAN:

Well --

Alderson Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

-- the other ground.

2

MR. FELDMAN:

Is that right?

The -- what the injunction

3

actually says is something like the injunction will last

4

until, and unless there is a constitutional plan that's

5

precleared.

6

constitutional, and we know the views of the district

7

court about that, I think that as long as that -- that

8

word, constitutional, is there, that -- that that remains

9

an obstacle to administering the plan.
QUESTION:

10
11

And insofar as it uses the word

So unless that injunction is vacated,

we're at a stalemate.
MR. FELDMAN:

12

At least that part -- at least the

13

injunction has to be modified to remove the word

14

constitutional.
QUESTION:

15

Well, but that's -- that's dictum.

16

I mean, what the district court said about that is -- is

17

dictum.
QUESTION:

No, it's part of the injunction

It isn't --

21

MR. FELDMAN:

It --

It says until a constitutional plan

24

not before the court.

25

district court is going -- going to rule on it, but you

Now you may well know how the

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

don't know that the district court will be affirmed in

2

that ruling, or -- I don't -- I don't see how the -- the

3

constitutional ruling is embodied in the injunction.
MR. FELDMAN:

4

If the Court made clear, I think,

5

that -- that the -- that this injunction couldn't rest on

6

the ground that Article I, section 4 of the Constitution

7

was violated by the -- by the State court plan, then I

8

think it would be ripe for a preclearance.
QUESTION:

9

Wouldn't -- wouldn't it also be

10

ripe -- wouldn't the time run simply if -- if the State

11

moved to vacate the injunction?

12

MR. FELDMAN:

Yes.

13

the Federal court injunction?

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. FELDMAN:

16

QUESTION:

If a State moved to vacate

Yes.
In the --

Because at that point wouldn't it

17

have signified that it was, indeed, attempting to

18

administer the plan?
MR. FELDMAN:

19

There -- well, there's really two

20

grounds on which we think the injunction is -- is

21

relevant.

22

primarily the -- the argument so far has been concerned

23

with, which is that the State was no longer seeking to

24

enforce the plan because it didn't appeal it.

25

There's a narrower ground, which I think it --

QUESTION:

And that --

If it now seeks to vacate --

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. FELDMAN:

-- if the State took action,

2

they're still not appealing it, but I suppose, after this

3

Court's order, if they went back to the district court,

4

and said, in light of this Court's order, we're trying to

5

seek to enforce it again, and if they had the ability to

6

do that, then that -- then that would be eliminated.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. FELDMAN:

9

Yes.
There is a broader ground,

however, because the -- insofar as the injunction is a

10

injunction that's based -- rests on constitutional

11

grounds, it's the Department's position that -- that the

12

preclearance -- the section 5 uses the terms seek to --

13

seek to administer.

14

Attorney General acts, and it talks about voting changes

15

that are in force and effect.

16

point to a contemplation by the statute of a change going

17

to the Attorney General when it's ready to be -- ready --

18

ready to go into effect, when there's no present legal

19

obstacle.

20

other than a section 5 injunction to its current

21

administration, then the Attorney General -- it's too

22

early -- it's too early to go to the Attorney General.

It says it may be enforced once the

And all of those things

As long as there's a present legal obstacle

Okay.

Then that goes back, I guess,

24

to the earlier suggestion.

that, in fact, the alternative ground was prematurely

raised, wouldn't that respond to the -- to the second -MR. FELDMAN:

I think -- as I said, I think it's

3

clear that if the -- if the Court made clear that this --

4

this injunction rests on section 5 and doesn't rest on the

5

proposition that it violates Article I, section 4 for

6

the -- for the plan to go into effect, then it would be

7

ripe for a preclearance at that point.

8
9

QUESTION:

Of course, we have a doctrine that we

don't decide constitutional issues unless we have to.

Do

10

you think that doctrine should have applied to the

11

district court in this case because the section 5 ground,

12

as I read the opinion, was -- was self -- was sufficient

13

to sustain the objections?

14
15
16

MR. FELDMAN:

I think -- I do think the section

5 ground was sufficient to sustain it.
QUESTION:

And therefore it was really wrong for

17

the district court to reach out and unnecessarily decide a

18

constitutional question.

19

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- you certainly -- the -- the

20

only reason I would hesitate for that, before I'd quite go

21

that far, is district court was faced -- if you put

22

yourself in the situation that the court was, with very

23

tight deadlines -- and there are -- even -- although

24

courts should avoid deciding constitutional questions when

25

possible, there may be some extreme circumstances where --

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

But those deadlines -- you've

2

demonstrated in your brief that the -- the clearance

3

hadn't occurred.

4

position on the preclearance, the deadlines were not a

5

real obstacle.

6

I mean, if -- if we agree with your

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I agree.

And actually I --

7

I do think the district court certainly could have said

8

and -- and perhaps should have said, this is a

9

constitutional issue.

Especially, it's a novel

10

constitutional issue that raises novel questions that

11

haven't been addressed before, and the section 5 ground

12

was sufficient to sustain the injunction.

13

QUESTION:

But the district court -- didn't --

14

isn't that what the district court said when it said this

15

is our alternative holding in the event that on appeal, it

16

is determined that we erred in our February 19 ruling?

17

It seems to me that that's a contingent ruling.

18

right about that it hasn't been precleared, then this

19

doesn't come into play.

20

MR. FELDMAN:

If we're

I -- I guess only insofar as when

21

you read the actual order of the court, it says a --

22

this -- this shall go into -- the State may not enforce

23

the State court plan until the State -- there's a

24

constitutional plan that's precleared.

25

that word --

And if you read

Alderson Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

But one -- one could agree with the

2

court, what it was intending to do and give effect to what

3

it was intending to do, and if we should hold, if we

4

should agree with the court, that there's no precleared

5

plan, then it would be appropriate to vacate the decision

6

to the extent that it rests on the constitutional ground.
MR. FELDMAN:

7
8

well be right.

I -- I think that may -- that may

I -- I don't disagree with that.

I'd like to go to, actually the first -- the

9
10

first alleged preclearance which is supposed to have

11

occurred 60 days after the plan was initially submitted to

12

the district court, and that preclearance did not occur --

13

was initially submitted to the Attorney General.

14

me.

15

February 14th, before the 60-day period had expired, the

16

Attorney General sent the State a letter saying, I need

17

more information before I can preclear this plan.

18

procedure, under which the Attorney General did that, was

19

specifically held valid by this Court in Georgia against

20

the United States, and the Court in Georgia specifically

21

held that that stopped the 60-day clock from running.

22

Excuse

That preclearance did not occur because on

That

Later, in Morris against Gressette, the Court

23

held that the Attorney General's substantive

24

determinations under section 5 are not subject to -- are

25

not subject to judicial review at all.

And therefore, the

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Attorney General's determination that more information is

2

needed, that the information before him was not sufficient

3

to permit preclearance -- to permit him to make the

4

determinations he had to make -- also is not subject to

5

judicial review.

6

And therefore, because that whole process was --

7

was approved by the Court in Georgia against the United

8

States, because more information was sought, that that

9

terminated the 60-day clock then, and it did not -- the

10

plan was not precleared some days later when -- when the

11

60-day period would have expired.

12

I think for the reasons I said earlier, it also

13

was not precleared at the later period both because the

14

State didn't -- on the narrower ground that the State did

15

not appeal the injunction, and on the broader ground that

16

the injunction was there.

I --

-- that you can harmonize them.
I think generally, but I do not

23

think in general these can be harmonized, or at least

24

within the scope of where it's possible for 2c to -- to

25

operate.

For -- one reason is that the language,

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Representatives shall be elected only from districts so

2

established, is unequivocal, and, in fact, it shows that

3

the earlier portion of 2c that says, there shall be

4

established by law congressional districts in each State,

5

has to mean established either by a court, or by a

6

legislature, or by anyone who acts.
QUESTION:

7

What if it meant just by a court?

8

It would really put a lot of pressure on the legislatures

9

to -- to do what they're supposed to, and to enact these

10

districts by law.

It would take a lot of -- a lot of

11

these cases that -- that place the burden upon the

12

district judge to reapportion a whole State would go away.

He'd say, if the legislature doesn't ask, all of you guys

are going to run at large.

interpret it that way.

Isn't that Mississippi's own default

Doesn't Mississippi have that same statute?
MR. FELDMAN:

They do have the same statute,

But that

1
2

to 1967.
The reason why 2c was enacted, and the way to

3

give 2c some effect is that Congress at that time was

4

faced with a situation where there were at least six

5

courts that had threatened to order at-large election of

6

entire congressional delegations in the aftermath of Baker

7

against Carr.

8

concern specifically was that courts would order

9

at-large elections, and the response was the enactment of

And Congress responded to that.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL B. WALLACE

14

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES/CROSS-APPELLANTS SMITH, ET AL.

15
16
17

MR. WALLACE:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
It seems that the Court is focusing on the

18

question of preclearance here, and the real problem with

19

the question of preclearance is that the Justice

20

Department has stopped the preclearance process because of

21

the injunction.

22

Now, we believe that the Justice Department

23

acted properly in so doing.

They have a regulation that

24

says, we will not consider premature submissions, and this

25

Court said in Georgia that any reasonable regulation will

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

be enforced.
Their position is that whenever the State has

2
3

been told it cannot administer a change, then it cannot be

4

seeking to administer a change within the meaning of

5

section 5, and therefore, this was premature.

6

stopped.

7

So they

Now, the question is what can be done about

8

that, and I think, in all probability, the only thing that

9

can be done about that is for the Attorney General of

10

Mississippi to go down the street to the district court

11

and ask them to preclear the change under section 5

12

because there does not seem to be any other mechanism

13

whereby anybody can force the Justice Department to get

14

moving on a section 5 preclearance.

15

QUESTION:

But, Mr. Wallace, don't you agree

16

that with the injunction outstanding, the Justice

17

Department would have the same reason for refusing to

18

preclear that it's already given?

19

MR. WALLACE:

I think not, Your Honor, and I

20

think that's because of the very strange system of divided

21

jurisdiction that Congress consciously created back in

QUESTION:

2

How long does it take if you take

3

the -- if you said derail the preclearance procedure

4

before the Attorney General, switch to the D.C. District

5

Court track?

6

proceedings -- in the district court ordinarily take?

How long do those proceedings -- section 5

MR. WALLACE:

7

I've never been in one, Your

8

Honor.

I don't know that I could tell you, but I would

9

think it would take close to a year anyway.
QUESTION:

10

Now --

Well, then why can't we just do what

11

we'd -- I'd suggested anyway -- I think others did too --

12

that -- that you -- you -- we'd simply say, look, here's

13

an injunction.

14

plan hasn't been precleared, the Mississippi plan, the

15

court plan.

16

ground two is, A, premature, doesn't really support the

17

issue, it's an injunction -- because it's premature, et

18

cetera.

19

a legal point of view insofar as we were right about that,

20

would just rest on the ground that it hasn't been

21

precleared.

22

It rests on two grounds.

Ground one, this

Ground two, it's unconstitutional.

You'd say

And now you'd have a decision that, I guess, from

And since that's the only reason for issuing the

23

injunction, then the Department, if the State of

24

Mississippi wants to put the plan in effect, would

25

preclear it.

If the State doesn't want to put it in

1

effect, well, that's their business.

2

are going to put it in effect, then the Department would

3

have to get busy.
MR. WALLACE:

4

But -- but if they

As a practical matter, Justice

5

Breyer, that might get the process moving, because I think

6

I've understood the United States to indicate that they

7

would get moving if that's what the Court did.

8

the usual rules of this Court's jurisdiction, it sits to

9

review judgments and not opinions.

But under

And the judgment is

10

that -- that the -- that the district court plan shall

11

stay into effect -- shall stay in effect until

12

preclearance of a constitutional plan takes effect.

13

That's true -QUESTION:

14

Yes, but in affirming that, we

15

certainly can say why we're affirming it.

16

we say, yes, the injunction is valid for one reason, and

17

one reason only, we do not reach the other -- the other

18

reason, and there is no basis for reaching the other

19

reason.

Certainly we can say that.
MR. WALLACE:

20

And -- and if

And if -- and if the Court does

21

say that, and if the Justice Department does get moving as

22

a result of that opinion, then that will move the process

23

along.

24
25

QUESTION:

So we're in an unusual -- I mean,

this is unusual because I guess we would be reviewing a

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

reason for the judgment.

It's unusual because there's a

2

legislature that doesn't want to reapportion.

3

third aspect in which it's unusual is that the Supreme

4

Court of Mississippi, according to some of the parties,

5

has overturned previous cases of that court which said the

6

chancery court lacks the power to enter the plan, and it

7

did it without writing an opinion.

8

court writes an opinion.

And the

It's normal that a

Now, is there any likelihood or chance that the

9
10

Mississippi Supreme Court, before this issue comes back to

11

us, if it does, would explain what the reason is for

12

departing from what seems to be a long precedent?
MR. WALLACE:

13

I suspect the Mississippi Supreme

14

Court can take a hint as well as the Justice Department,

15

Justice Breyer.

16

and ordinarily, the Court would not edit opinions on valid

17

judgments.

18

Justice Department may move.

19

Mississippi may move.

There was no error in this injunction,

But if the Court does that, then certainly the
I think the Supreme Court of

We moved for a stay at the Supreme Court of

20
21

Mississippi.

That stay was denied.

The briefing is

22

finished.

23

will set the case for oral argument in due course.

24

they get an opinion from this Court that says, we'd

25

certainly like to know what you have to say, I think I can

There has been no stay order.

I presume they

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

But if

1

say with confidence that they will set the case with --

2

for -- for argument in due course.
So as -- as Justice Breyer says, it is a strange

3
4

case.

We think it is a case in which the judgment is

5

absolutely correct, and the -- and what the Justice

6

Department has done is absolutely correct under its

7

regulations.
QUESTION:

8

But would you say it's absolutely

9

correct if the constitutional reasoning were wrong, and if

10

they say we won't approve a -- a Mississippi plan that is

11

in violation of our constitutional holding?
MR. WALLACE:

12

The -- as -- as Justice Ginsburg

13

has observed, I think that is an alternative ground in the

14

opinion.

15

judgment, but it makes a problem, as Mr. McDuff has noted,

16

because even if there is section 5 preclearance down the

17

road, this district court would enjoin it again.

18

I do not think that it affects -- infects the

QUESTION:

Is it your view that the section 5

19

ground of decision is sufficient to -- to uphold the --

20

the injunction below?

21

MR. WALLACE:

We believe that it is sufficient

22

to uphold the judgment below because there is no error in

23

the judgment, and there is no error --

24
25

QUESTION:

But if -- if that's true, did not the

district court violate our rule against deciding

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

constitutional issues unnecessarily?
MR. WALLACE:

2
3

it's a close call.

5

In Ashwander --

QUESTION:

4

Why is it a close call if -- if the

judgment is clearly correct on the section 5 ground?

6

MR. WALLACE:

7

QUESTION:

8

I think they did not, although

The -- the district court --

It seems to me it's only a close call

if you think there's doubt about the section 5 ground.
MR. WALLACE:

9

And that's why the district court

10

set the alternative judgments.

11

were making it easier for this Court.

12

say never decide a constitutional question.
QUESTION:

13

I think they thought they
Ashwander doesn't

It doesn't -- says you don't do it if

14

it's not necessary, and it clearly was not necessary if

15

they're right on the section 5 ground, which everybody

16

seems to agree they were.
MR. WALLACE:

17
18

We certainly agree that they were,

and if they're -- and if -QUESTION:

19

The other side doesn't agree they

20

were.

Would -- would you bet your life that they're --

21

that they're right about that?

22

(Laughter.)

23

MR. WALLACE:

I would be -- let me turn to that,

24

if I may, Justice Scalia, because we believe that they

25

are -- that the Justice Department and the district court

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

were correct on the section 5 ground.

2

to the February 14th letter for more information.

3

Assistant Solicitor General has said, that's a standard

4

application of Georgia versus United States.

5

have -- when you need more information to decide a

6

section 5 issue, then the Justice Department is entitled

7

to stop the clock and ask for more information, and the

8

clock won't move again until they get more information.

9

This is a -- a straightforward application of a regulation

10
11

And that goes back
As the

When you

that this Court has already approved.
The district court so found, believed that the

12

request for more information was absolutely valid, and

13

therefore said, there has been no approval, there is no

14

plan in place, and for that reason, we must put in a plan

15

of our own.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, there is something

17

unusual about that request for information.

It seems to

18

have been triggered by the district court.

19

page 100a of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement

20

where the district court is commenting on this opinion,

21

this opaque opinion, of the Mississippi Supreme Court that

22

says the chancery court has authority, and then says --

23

this is the end of the first paragraph on the page -- that

24

at the very least, the Attorney General of the United

25

States will consider the implications very carefully and

I'm looking at

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

might perhaps request more information.

2

the -- of district courts telling the Attorney General how

3

the preclearance process should run.

4

operating procedure?

5

MR. WALLACE:

I'm not aware of

Is this standard

By no means is it standard,

6

Justice Ginsburg.

But what the district court was doing

7

in this case was deciding whether or not there would be

8

enough time for the preclearance to be completed before

9

the qualifying date.

The intervenors were suggesting we

10

did not need a Federal trial, we should wait for the

11

Justice Department to finish its work.

12

The Justice Department already had before it a

13

complicated submission from the -- from the Attorney

14

General of Mississippi, which begins on page 228 -- 221a

15

of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement, and that

16

presented not only the -- not only the congressional

17

redistricting plan itself, but also the decision of the

18

Supreme Court of Mississippi to overrule 70 years of

19

precedent and allow trial courts to do redistricting.

20

those two issues were already before the Justice

21

Department when the district court wrote.

22

So

But all the district court wrote -- said is, we

23

think we better get busy and try this case because this

24

looks like a real hard submission to us, and we're not

25

sure that they're going to be able to decide this case

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

before our qualifying date.

So it's unusual, but it's

2

certainly well within the -- the scope of what the

3

district court was being asked to do.

4

properly pointed out problems.

And I think they

And -- and with the help of the district

5
6

court -- the help, indeed, of the submission that Attorney

7

General Moore had already made, I think the Justice

8

Department properly saw that there were questions that

9

needed to be asked.

10

They asked those questions, and that

stopped the 60 days from running.
QUESTION:

11

We also have to reach your issue,

12

don't we?

Even if we agree with you on that, we still

13

have to reach the cross-appeal issue, don't we?

14

MR. WALLACE:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. WALLACE:

I -- I think you do.

Or do we?
I think you do because in --

17

because once it is conceded that the -- the district court

18

had to impose a remedy in 2002, then the question arises

19

of what that remedy should be.

20

the district court, and it is our position here that the

21

district court should have enforced the law of the State

22

of Mississippi, as Justice Stevens has observed, says that

23

you must have at-large elections, and an act of Congress

24

dating back to 1941 that says you must have at-large

25

elections in these circumstances.

And it was our position in

That's section 2a(c)(5)

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of Title II.

We ask for that to be enforced, and that's

2

an issue that I think must be reached in this case

3

regardless.
I think the United States has the only argument

4
5

for not enforcing the 1941 act.

6

absolutely incontrovertibly inconsistent on its face.

7

the reasons that Justice O'Connor has stated, we think it

8

is not inconsistent on its face.

For

QUESTION:

MR. WALLACE:

12

QUESTION:

13

They claim that it is

No court has ever done it before -No court --

-- in all of the years that courts

have been operating under this act.
MR. WALLACE:

14

This Court did it under almost

15

identical statutes 70 years ago in Smiley and Carroll and

16

Koenig.

17

QUESTION:

2c didn't exist then.

18

MR. WALLACE:

There was a 1911 act that said

19

basically the same thing.

20

elect Representatives by districts, but at the same time

21

it says, but if districts have not be redistricted, then

22

any new Representatives will be elected at large.

23

that's --

24
25

QUESTION:

The 1911 act says you shall

And

To get your -- to get your result,

you have to read, there shall be established by State law

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

a number of districts, et cetera.

And -- and, in fact,

2

it's pretty hard to read it that way, for me it seems,

3

because this thing, there shall be established by law a

4

number of districts, i.e., not at-large, was enacted by

5

Congress in response to courts that had threatened --

6

courts, not legislatures -- that had threatened at-large

7

elections.

8

Congress, and they passed this law saying there shall be

9

established by law a number districts.

And so they were quite unhappy about that in

It seems to me

10

their object was certainly court districting, wasn't it,

11

as well as legislative districting?

12

MR. WALLACE:

As difficult as it is to read the

13

mind of Congress, Justice Breyer, I think that while they

14

were clearly unhappy, they were unable to agree in any

15

detail on what ought to be done.

16

there was -- there were people who stood up in both houses

17

of Congress and suggested that this law would not be

18

enforced in States -- in court proceedings, that it was

19

being -- that it was addressing itself to legislatures.

20

QUESTION:

21

you just mentioned?

And even on section 2c,

It was repeating the 1911 law that

Why -- why did they -- why did

they pass it if it didn't do anything but -- but say what

7

Well, you've got to give me some

Legislative history helps, by the

way.

8

(Laughter.)

9

QUESTION:

I gather the legislative history

10

you've just told us is, as usual, on both sides of this

11

thing.

Is that right?

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. WALLACE:

We believe it is, Your Honor.

14

As -- as was noted in the Hanson decision in the D.C.

15

Circuit, I think there was gamesmanship on both sides in

16

both houses.

17

Hanson case.

18

Gamesmanship is a word that comes from the

QUESTION:

But, Mr. Wallace, one thing isn't, I

19

think, debatable and that is since 2c is on the books, no

20

court has ever resorted to whatever -- was 2a, whatever.

21

Since 2c is there, that's the one that the courts have

22

used, is that not so?

23

MR. WALLACE:

It is -- I don't know that they

24

have enforced 2c.

I think most of them have believed that

25

they were acting under this Court's oversight which tells

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

courts always to read -- always to do single-member

2

districts when they can.

3

Justice Ginsburg, no court since 1967 has ordered at-large

4

elections in -- in redistricting cases.

But it's certainly true,

But we believe what -- if you look at the rules

5
6

of construction, and at what Congress actually did,

7

without trying to speculate on what they were trying to

8

do, they enacted language that had been before this Court

9

in 1911 and was -- and was construed in 1932 to allow

10

at-large elections.

11

QUESTION:

I assume --

Except --

13

QUESTION:

Go on.

14

No.

15

Except for one fact, and that is now we have a

16

districting statute which -- which is the later one in

17

time.

18

command are no longer of -- of even weight.

19

districting command is later in time and therefore, to the

20

extent that there's any conflict, that's got to get some

21

precedence.

22

The -- the districting command and the at-large

MR. WALLACE:

The

That would -- and that is a

23

difference in 1911 because those two parts of the act were

24

enacted at the same time.

25

QUESTION:

Yes, yes.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. WALLACE:

But if they could be construed

2

consistently in 1911, then I think they can be construed

3

consistently in 2002.

4

consistently, it doesn't matter which one was enacted

5

first.

6

QUESTION:

And if they can be construed

Except that there would be no

7

possible reason for reenacting it if they're -- if they're

8

going to be construed consistently, just as they were when

9

they were both enacted simultaneously.

10

MR. WALLACE:

The -- the difficulty of figuring

11

out what Congress thought it was doing on this single

12

piece of legislation tacked onto a private immigration

13

bill is very difficult, Justice Scalia.

14

But as we noted in our brief, which did discuss the

15

legislative history, they had thought about this for

16

2 years and specifically considered repealing the 1941

17

act, and they didn't do it.

18

something else.

19

of construction, that means the 1941 act --

20

I recognize it.

They came back and did

And we think under standard rules of --

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, do you agree with the --

21

with Mr. Feldman that in any event the Mississippi statute

22

is out of the picture because that's pre-empted no matter

23

which way we go on this issue?

24
25

MR. WALLACE:

I think it would be hard to argue

that Congress impliedly repealed a 1941 act and didn't

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

intend to pre-empt a State law that said the same thing.

2

I've tried to come up with that argument, Justice Stevens,

3

but I don't think I can make it.

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. WALLACE:

6

QUESTION:

So --

What do you -- what do you answer to

7

the -- the fear that one has to have that redistricting by

8

having all the elections at large is precisely what those

9

who were interested in diluting minority vote would like?
MR. WALLACE:

10

Well, first of all, Your Honor,

11

the -- the answer that I have is that an act of Congress

12

is not subject to the Voting Rights Act, and would be

13

enforced on its face.
But the other answer I have is this.

14

We have a

15

long history over the last 20 and 30 years in Mississippi

16

of coming up with remedies which will protect the rights

17

of minority voters.

18

is to do single-member districts, but it's not the only

19

remedy.

20

at large and because of the way the election is held, all

21

people running together, not requiring majority votes, not

22

having -- not having anti-single-shot requirements, those

23

have worked in Mississippi.

24

in white jurisdictions in multi-member races by using

25

those sorts of procedures.

The most common remedy since Gingles

And there are remedies where you can elect people

Minorities have been elected

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Congress didn't tell us what sort of procedure

2

to use in an at-large election, and in Young v. Fordice,

3

this Court made clear that whatever procedures you use

4

would have to be precleared.

5

legislature will act for all of the reasons we've seen,

6

but the district court would certainly use those remedies.

7

They've used them before.

8
9

QUESTION:

I don't think the

Minorities will be protected.

Mr. Wallace, can I go back to the

constitutional issue that the district court decided in

10

this case?

11

defend the reasoning employed by the district court, even

12

though you defend their judgment.

13

fair comment on your position?

14

Your -- your adversaries say that you do not

MR. WALLACE:

Do you think that's a

I think I defend the reasoning of
I draw a

15

the district court as far as it went.

16

distinction between this case and Growe that they -- they

17

simply said that in Growe, the Supreme Court did not

18

consider this issue, which is true, and therefore we look

19

at the chancery court.

20

can't act.

21

It's not the legislature.

It

There is a distinction -- another distinction

22

between Growe and this case, which -- which the district

23

court did not dwell on and we dwell on in our briefs.

24

Growe, there was a Federal claim before the district

25

court -- before the State court.

In

And under the Supremacy

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Clause, ordinarily a State court must litigate Federal

2

claims, and this Court recognized their authority to do

3

so in Growe.

4

Here, for whatever reason, the plaintiffs in

5

the -- in the chancery court who are intervenors in this

6

Court did not assert a Federal claim.

7

plain, we are proceeding only under State law.

8

want to proceed under Federal law, and that under

9

U.S. v. Term Limits simply doesn't exist.

They made it quite
We do not

There is no

10

Federal -- there is no State law claim for congressional

11

redistricting.

12

this case, and this is -- that's the grounds on which we

13

defend it.

14

So that's the difference between Growe and

QUESTION:

You mean there is no State law

15

requiring redistricting at all?

16

MR. WALLACE:

There is -- there is no State

17

law -- first of all, there is no State law requiring

18

redistricting.

19

legislature proceeds, but there is no substantive law that

20

says redistricting shall take place.

21

There are statutes that talk about how the

So as a matter of State law, the

22

Mississippi legislature is under no duty to -- to

redistrict?

24
25

MR. WALLACE:

redistricting requirement comes only from the United

2

States Constitution.

3

from the Elections Clause, and the State of Mississippi

4

cannot impose on their legislators any requirement having

5

to do with congressional redistricting.

6

made by the Framers over 200 years ago that legislators

7

are the people to regulate congressional elections, and if

8

they fail to do it in their job of representing the

9

people, then Congress will do it in its job of

representing the people.
QUESTION:

11

Why can't a State just say we require

12

our legislature under State law to conform to the Federal

13

requirements by having a plan by January 15th by going to

14

the chancery court if you don't have a plan, et cetera?
MR. WALLACE:

15
16

Because at that point, Your Honor,

it -- it -- the -- perhaps the legislature could do that.
QUESTION:

17

And if the State of Mississippi says,

18

well, that in effect is what they did, don't we have to

19

take their word for it?
MR. WALLACE:

20

No, I don't think you do, Your

21

Honor.

First of all, perhaps they could delegate

22

authority.

23

hard for us, we want to delegate it to State courts, then

24

that -- that issue would be tested like any other

25

delegation.

If the legislature said this problem is too

QUESTION:

In a State court, and here we have an

2

unexplained judgment without an opinion of the Mississippi

3

Supreme Court which seems to say that's what it is.

4

doesn't say, but that's the holding of it.

5

MR. WALLACE:

It

But it -- but when you are dealing

6

with Federal constitutional guarantees and provisions, you

7

do not always take the State courts as -- as gospel even

8

on State law.

9

delegation, and as Your Honor knows, there was no

The district court here said there is no

10

explanation of why the writ of prohibition was denied.

11

It really doesn't set much of a precedent for anything,

12

but the district court, which is familiar with Mississippi

13

law, says there is no delegation in this case.

14

looked at Mississippi law, and nothing has been delegated.

15

We have

So the question of whether a legislature could

16

delegate power to the courts is not here.

What we have

17

before us is a case where the legislature has not

18

delegated power to the courts.

19

and when it does nothing, the States in that circumstance

20

are powerless to act if we go back to the acts of

21

Congress, and we think we enforce the at-large statute

22

from 1941 as the district court should have done.

It has simply done nothing

23

If there are no questions, I thank the Court.

QUESTION:

25

Mr. McDuff, you have 5 minutes left.

Thank you, Mr. Wallace.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT B. McDUFF

2

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS/CROSS-APPELLEES BRANCH, ET AL.

3

MR. McDUFF:

Thank you, Your Honor.

4

Justice Breyer, the State of Mississippi does

5

want to put the plan into effect.

That was the order of

6

the Mississippi Supreme Court, however brief it was,

7

saying the chancery court's plan will remain in effect

8

until -- unless superseded by a timely plan of the State

9

legislature.

The Attorney General submitted the plan for

10

preclearance under order by the chancery court.

11

done -- he has not withdrawn the preclearance submission.
QUESTION:

12

The statutory language is not -- is

13

not whether it's in effect or not.

14

seeking to administer it.
MR. McDUFF:

15

He has

It's whether he's

That's the problem.

And -- and there's nothing about

16

the absence of the appeal here, particularly where we are

17

taking the appeal, that suggests he's not seeking to

18

administer it, Justice Scalia.
And let me mention one other thing along those

19
20

lines.

The language is enact or seek to administer.

21

the lesson of Growe v. Emison, at least we think, is that

22

a State court stands in the shoes of the legislature when

23

the legislature defaults on redistricting, and certainly

24

if the legislature had enacted this plan, and the -- it

25

had been enjoined by the Federal court for whatever

Now,

1

reasons, and the Attorney General had not taken an appeal,

2

but legislative leaders had or intervenors had, I don't

3

think we would say that the preclearance submission was

4

thereby withdrawn.

5

no different position, and we shouldn't say that the

6

Attorney General's failure to appeal here would withdraw

7

the submission where it wouldn't in the legislative

8

context.

It seems to me the State court is in

The -- and -- and the plan has been precleared

9
10

in our view, if not the -- by the first 60 days, certainly

11

by the time of the second 60 days, where the Justice

12

Department said, we're not going to continue to review

13

this plan because of the constitutional injunction.
Well, there's no language in section 5 that

14
15

stops the 60-day period from running on that ground.

16

That -- it is a statute that admits of no exceptions.

17

There is no regulation that allow -- by which the Justice

18

Department says, we will not continue to -- to consider

19

a -- a plan that has been enjoined on constitutional

20

grounds.

21

said in his brief that that is the regular practice of the

22

Department.

And in fact, the Solicitor General has not even

23

Here there are compelling reasons why it is

24

important for the 60-day period to be removed even if

25

there's a constitutional injunction.

Often these cases

are decided under severe time constraints.

2

constitutional injunction is imposed, State officials may

3

try to remove it as quickly as possible and restore the

4

plan in time for the election.

5

is delayed in the meantime, the -- it -- it, in effect,

6

prolongs itself by feeding off the constitutional

7

injunction, and even if the constitutional injunction is

8

vacated, the State still has to deal with this

9

now-postponed section 5 obstacle that will not be removed

10

If a

If the section 5 obstacle

in some situations in time for the election.
Let me say one other thing about the

11
12

constitutional ruling, the fact that it was an alternative

13

ground.

14

ground, as we've suggested here, and particularly given

15

the importance of resolving these cases so that elections

16

can go forward without continued Federal court

17

interference, I think it is crucial for this Court to rule

18

on the constitutional ground, as well as the preclearance

19

ground here.

20

We think there is doubt about the section 5

The rule of Connor, and the rule of the Warren

21

County case are not jurisdictional rules.

22

supervisory rules imposed by this Court to ensure the

23

orderly processing of the section 5 issue when it's --

24

when it's in a case in which other issues are involved.

25

They're

Here the orderly processing of this litigation,

54
Alderson Reporting Company

1

and the creation of the situation where Mississippi can

2

conduct its elections in 2004 without continued confusion

3

of the type that we had at the last election, that

4

interest favors resolving the constitutional issue now, at

5

the same time the section 5 issue is resolved.
And so for all of these reasons and the reasons

6
7

set forth in our brief, we respectfully urge that the

8

Court vacate the injunction of the district court on all

9

grounds.
