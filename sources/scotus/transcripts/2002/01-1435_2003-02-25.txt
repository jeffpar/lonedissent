ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN W. SEYMOUR
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

10
11

MR. SEYMOUR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The four doctors who are shareholder-directors

12

of the petitioner are not employees under the ADA, the

13

Americans With Disabilities Act, because, like partners,

14

they own and manage their own clinic.

15

QUESTION:

What -- what is the common law rule

16

on respondeat superior for an ordinary corporation vis a

17

vis a director?

18

an employee of the corporation?

19
20

Is a director of an ordinary corporation

MR. SEYMOUR:

In an ordinary corporation, the

common law rule is that the employee is like a servant.

21

QUESTION:

Well, if -- if that's so --

22

QUESTION:

Well, what is your answer?

23

QUESTION:

I didn't hear you.

24

QUESTION:

I couldn't hear the response.

25

MR. SEYMOUR:

I'm sorry.

QUESTION:

Your answer was yes, was -- he is an

employee?

3

MR. SEYMOUR:

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

Okay.

Well, then Darden says common

5

law, common law says directors are employees, and these

6

are directors, end of case.

10

MR. SEYMOUR:

Why not?

Because Darden doesn't apply here.

Darden was -QUESTION:

Well, you didn't even cite Darden, I

don't think.

11

MR. SEYMOUR:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SEYMOUR:

14

QUESTION:

I believe I did.

Did you?
Yes.

I would think Darden would be the

15

first place we'd look.

16

MR. SEYMOUR:

Well, the difference between this

17

case and Darden is significant.

18

which the Court was required to determine whether an

19

individual was an independent contractor --

That's not a choice here.

No, but the decision has to be made

on whether these people are employees.

1

MR. SEYMOUR:

2

QUESTION:

That's right.

And Darden says, well, we're going to

3

look to the common law, so what makes you think we'd do

4

something else in this situation?

5

MR. SEYMOUR:

Because there are frankly not much

6

common law that gives us guidance on how to decide whether

7

a director-shareholder in a professional corporation is an

8

employee or not.

9

The -- in Darden, it cited factors that are

10

really quite good at determining whether an individual is

11

an independent contractor or an employee.

12

don't work very well here, because they're not designed to

13

address the issues that we're looking at.

14

Those factors

That is, for example, one of the factors that

15

the common law looks to to determine whether a -- an

16

individual is an independent contractor is whether the

17

individual provides their own tools of the trade.

18

that's not the kind of factor that's going to work very

19

well in this kind of case.

20

that a Darden-like analysis is very appropriate, but we

21

think that it's better to use factors such as suggested by

22

the Government in their brief, that is, the EEOC guidance,

23

because those kinds of factors suggested in the EEOC

24

guidance go the heart of the difference between

25

shareholder-directors and employees.

Well,

Therefore, we're suggesting

1

The factors in Darden do not, so therefore the

2

Darden factors are like trying to pound a round peg into a

3

square hole.

4

clumsy.

We shouldn't do that, because it becomes

5

QUESTION:

It may be clumsy --

6

QUESTION:

But this was a case where it was very

7

important to the shareholders in this corporation that

8

they be labeled employees for ERISA purposes.

9

be -- if they weren't employees, they weren't going to be

10

able to get themselves covered under the retirement plan

11

as the law then was, so in -- in the ERISA context you

12

would be saying, of course they're employees.

13

they qualified under ERISA.

14

for that reason.

15

MR. SEYMOUR:

It had to

That's how

We set this thing up solely

Yes, Your Honor, except that I

16

think that the -- the tax purposes were more under the

17

general tax laws, not under ERISA, because they could

18

establish an ERISA plan and deduct the expenses.

19
20

QUESTION:

But didn't they -- in order to be

covered, didn't they have to be employees?

21

MR. SEYMOUR:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. SEYMOUR:

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes.

Yes.
And -- and just --

And they wouldn't -- on your theory,

they're not -- so they are employees for that purpose?

1

MR. SEYMOUR:

Well, they're treated as employees

2

for that purpose, but they should not be treated as

3

employees for purposes of the ADA.

4

For example, if we turn the coin over and look

5

at the other side, and the Court is required to examine

6

whether someone who is labeled a partner is, in reality,

7

a -- an employee.

8

economic realities of that situation, that the partner is

9

really an employee, that doesn't mean that the

If the Court finds that, looking at the

10

now-employer should issue W-2's, or that they should have

11

been withholding.

12

have the same purposes as the ADA.

13

Those are tax issues, and they don't

QUESTION:

But the -- am I wrong in thinking

14

that the -- the whole thing was set up the way it was,

15

instead of as a partnership, for the reason that these

16

people needed to be characterized as employees for

17

retirement plan purposes?

18

MR. SEYMOUR:

19

QUESTION:

20
21
22
23

Yes.

And are they not also employees for

Worker's Compensation purposes?
MR. SEYMOUR:

Under Oregon law, they can opt out

of Worker's Compensation.
QUESTION:

But they'd have to opt out.

24

start out by being in.

25

MR. SEYMOUR:

Yes.

They

get salaries?

MR. SEYMOUR:

4

They start out as being -- do they

They get salaries plus a bonus,

which is the division of their profits.
QUESTION:

5

But they get salaries.

There's

6

nothing inconsistent with being, say, the president of the

7

company and principal shareholder and being both an owner

8

and an employee.
MR. SEYMOUR:

9

That's true.

There's nothing

10

inconsistent about that, and our concern with this case

11

is, the court didn't go past the fact that the clinic was

12

organized as a professional corporation, and when the -QUESTION:

13

Why should it, because I'm still

14

stuck with the language of Darden, which reads as a

15

general rule, when Congress has used the term, employee,

16

without defining it, we have concluded that Congress

17

intended to describe the conventional master-servant

18

relationship as understood by common law agency doctrine,

19

and it says, that rule stood as an independent authority

20

for the copyright decision.

21

here.

22
23

So, too, should it stand

Now, is your view, it should not stand here in
this case --

That's our view.

1

MR. SEYMOUR:

2

QUESTION:

That's our view.

All right, so you're asking us to

3

depart from Darden and to make an exception from the

4

Darden rule for the -- this particular act.

5

MR. SEYMOUR:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. SEYMOUR:

8
9

For this --

Is that right?
For this particular circumstance,

that's correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, when you say circumstance,

10

there's a word in an act, so you're saying that the word,

11

employee, in this title of the ADA does not bear the

12

common law definition?

13

MR. SEYMOUR:

14
15

Well, I think the common law

definition is one thing to look at.
QUESTION:

That is the --

No, no, I'm asking -- they said in

16

Darden that's the end of it, and you say -- I want to be

17

just clear about it.

18

Common law is not the end of it.

19

MR. SEYMOUR:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. SEYMOUR:

22

QUESTION:

Okay.

23

QUESTION:

Would -- would you say that the EEOC

You say, it is not the end of it.

Yes, that's what we're saying.

All right, and so -Common law is not the end of it.
Now I understand.

might themselves be part of what we call the common law?
I -- I take it part of your position is based on

3

the proposition that the common law, I suppose of agency,

4

up through the 1950s just didn't have much on this subject

5

at all, when we're talking about the difference between

6

partners and professional and -- and employees of a

7

professional corporation.

8

writing on that subject.

9

MR. SEYMOUR:

There just wasn't a corpus of

No, there isn't much in the common

10

law, because a professional corporation is not a product

11

of the common law, nor is a limited liability partnership,

12

nor a limited liability company, and all three of those

13

organizations are virtually functionally identical once

14

they're up and running.

15

QUESTION:

They have the same --

Well, and as -- as courts begin to

16

write about these things in the area of subchapter S

17

status, tax status and so forth, there is an emerging

decisional law, at least, that's -- that's evolving, I

take it, and you might say that has some common law

It might not be common law as we -- as we

be considered an employee for purposes of defining who -10

1

QUESTION:

Who -- Darden also says, a couple of

2

pages after the quote that Justice Breyer -- since the

3

common law test contains no shorthand formula or magic

4

phrase that can be applied to find the answer, all of the

5

incidents of the relationship must be assessed and weighed

6

with no one factor being decisive, which suggests a more

7

fluid test, certainly, than the other language.
MR. SEYMOUR:

8
9

And a more fluid test would be

certainly more flexible, because -QUESTION:

10

But that's exactly my point.

That's

11

why I started out asking you whether you concede that a

12

director of a corporation is an employee under the common

13

law, because if you concede that, you're saying that the

14

common law fluid test ends up with the director being an

15

employee, and I take it that it's well-established a

16

director is an employee.

17

MR. SEYMOUR:

18

your question to be -QUESTION:

19

Well, that's -- I -- I understood

No, my question was to try to get the

20

framework.

Either you're saying the common law, you win,

21

or you're saying, common law, I lose, but I win anyway

22

because it's not the common law, so if you want to take

23

the tack, common law test, I still win, explain it to me.

24

How is a director ordinarily an employee, but this one

25

isn't?

1

MR. SEYMOUR:

Well, under an ordinary

2

corporation, I think your -- your question would be yes,

3

but under a professional corporation, it's different.
It's much more like a partnership, because if we

4
5

look at the emergence of these new entities like limited

6

liability partnerships, limited liability corporations,

7

and professional corporations, they're all emerging for

8

professional businesses like this clinic from sole

9

proprietorships or general partnerships, and the only --

10

there's really no difference, functionally, when we look

11

at those different entities.
QUESTION:

12
13

Oh, but isn't there a huge

difference, that they've got limited liability?
If you have -- the corporation is liable if you

14
15

have, you're incorporated?

16

case, too?

17

MR. SEYMOUR:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

Isn't that the true with your

No, the --

Whereas in partnership, the

individuals are liable?
MR. SEYMOUR:

In the partnership, individuals

21

are liable, but in a professional corporation, in a

22

limited liability partnership, in a limited liability

23

company, the -- for professionals, those limited

24

liabilities are all the same, and they're not as good as a

25

general corporation, or an ordinary corporation.
12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

In other words, the doctors in this clinic, in a

2

PC, have liability for their own acts, and limited

3

vicarious liability for the acts of the other doctors.

4

That's not true inside an ordinary corporation.

5

true inside a limited liability partnership and a limited

6

liability company.
QUESTION:

7

It is

Am I wrong in thinking that the --

8

that the individual liability is not across the board, but

9

it's only for malpractice-type claims?
MR. SEYMOUR:

MR. SEYMOUR:

MR. SEYMOUR:

Yes, they do, and that's true for

all three of those emerging types of entities,

19

professional corporations, limited liability partnerships,

20

and limited liability companies.

21

QUESTION:

Well, maybe there isn't -- there

22

isn't any settled law, is there, that a limited liability

23

partnership would not be treated the same way that this

24

entity is -- is treated?

25

MR. SEYMOUR:

Well, for example, as a partner in

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

a partnership, limited liability partnership, I have

2

exactly the same limits on my liability as the doctors in

3

this clinic, and I am not an employee, I'm a partner, and

4

the only difference between my status and the status of

5

these doctors is the form of the business, and that's

6

really just a label.
QUESTION:

7
8

Well, you say you're not an employee,

but isn't that the question we have to decide?
MR. SEYMOUR:

9

Well, every court that's addressed

10

the issue of whether partners are employees, including

11

this Court -QUESTION:

12

Well, you wouldn't suggest that every

13

partner -- no partner is ever an employee.

14

suggesting that, are you?

15

that's got 250 partners, you're going to say none of them

16

are -- are employees?
MR. SEYMOUR:

17

You're not

Say you've got a law firm

I'm sure there are some who would

18

say that, but I think that what the courts need to do is

19

look at the individual, not just at a label, and look

20

beyond the label to find out, as the EEOC standards -QUESTION:

But then we're away from -Pardon me?

I thought you had a very good case in

opinion on employee.

14

all right, but I can't square that with what the Court

I thought it was a great opinion,

And I'm -- if I may, the -- the

19

problem with Darden is, it's examining a different

We don't see those kinds of circumstances in the

Well, maybe the price that has to be

corporation is to be subject to the ADA, and the anti-

8

discrimination law of title VII, and so forth, because

9

these people are going to be counted.

10

makes a difference.

11

MR. SEYMOUR:

12

QUESTION:

14
15

In this case, it

Well --

Is that all bad, that they have to be

subject to these provisions?
MR. SEYMOUR:

The reason that it's bad -- yes,

it is all bad.

16

QUESTION:

Why?

17

MR. SEYMOUR:

And the reason is that we should

18

treat similarly situated businesses the same, and there

19

are a -- a class of partner-like or proprietor-like

20

individuals, and there is a class of employee-like

21

individuals, and just because -- let's say it starts out

22

as a general partnership.

23

limited liability partnership, or a professional

24

corporation, or a limited liability company, that

25

shouldn't change who belongs in which class, and if we

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN

9

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

10

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

11

MR. GORNSTEIN:

12

may it please the Court:

13

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it --

Under the EEOC's guidance, the question whether

14

shareholder-directors are employees depends on whether

15

they operate independently and manage the business or,

16

instead, are subject to the organization's control.

17

standard aligns the test for determining the employment

18

status of shareholder-directors with the test that courts

19

have long used in deciding whether partners are employees.

20

QUESTION:

That

Well, do you say that the EEOC has

21

adopted standards that differ from the common law, and has

22

by regulation or otherwise determined that we should apply

23

its test to this question?

25

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I guess largely, yes.

started with the common, common law right to control test

that is used to distinguish between independent

2

contractors and employees and adapted it to make a

3

distinction between those who were the proprietors of the

4

business and that business' employees, and it did so in a

5

way to align its standards for looking at the question of

6

shareholder-director with the same standards that have

7

been used by all the courts in deciding whether partners

8

or -- are employees

9

QUESTION:

And do you agree with the

10

petitioner's attorney that if you look to the common law

11

test, these people would be employees?

12

MR. GORNSTEIN:

13

as the measure of the common law --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. GORNSTEIN:

If you look to the Restatement

Yes.
-- then generally speaking, a --

16

a director who didn't employ service -- perform services

17

would not have been an employee, but a director who

18

performed services would be.
Now, the only hesitation I would have is to say

19
20

that the -- that at the time of the Restatement there

21

wasn't -- there weren't professional corporations that

22

mixed and matched features of partnership and

23

corporations, so there's not as clear an answer on that.
QUESTION:

24
25

Do we owe deference to the EEOC

standard?

MR. GORNSTEIN:

The -- the Court should give

2

weight to the -- the EEOC's test because it reflects its

3

accumulated and longstanding experience in administering

4

the act, but we're not asking for Chevron deference here.

QUESTION:

6

7

back in the Gilbert case?

I mean, didn't -- wasn't that way

MR. GORNSTEIN:

8
9

Didn't the Court say the EEOC doesn't

It -- it did say that, that

it -- it doesn't get Chevron deference.

Now, there is an

10

exception now.

11

regulations, and this Court has held that those

12

regulations are entitled to Chevron deference, but this is

13

guidance that applies across the board to all the

14

nondiscrimination laws, and what the Court has said in

15

that context is that the EEOC's analysis gets weight, in

16

light of the fact that it has accumulated experience under

17

the law.
QUESTION:

18
19
20
21
22

Under the ADA, the EEOC can issue

But it would be kind of a Skidmore

deference.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

It would be a Skidmore

deference, that's correct.
QUESTION:

Now, what --

I hate to be a bore on this, but will

23

you please write the two sentences for me where I have to

24

say either that, we apply the common law test, and in this

25

instance, the common law test comes out in your favor, or
19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

we have to say, we don't apply the common law test because

2

the EE -- this statute is different.

3

paths, both of which could lead to your victory or your

4

defeat, do you think we should take?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

5
6
7
8
9
10
11

Which of those two

Neither of those two, Justice

Breyer.
QUESTION:

Neither, all right.

Then write that

section of the opinion.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

I -- let me get to Darden,

because I think that's the focus of your questions.
As we read Darden, there is language that is

12

certainly broad enough in it to say that any time you use

13

the word, employee, you mean common law employee, but I

14

think that those, what -- you have to understand Darden in

15

the context of the -- the issue it was resolving in that

16

case, and there it was trying to draw a distinction,

17

whether the term employee embraces independent

18

contractors, and in that setting, Congress had twice

19

amended statutes to make clear that the term, employee,

20

did not mean independent contractor after this Court has

21

said that it could, and in that context, it makes perfect

22

sense to start out with a very strong presumption that

23

when Congress uses the term, employee, it does not mean

24

independent contractor.

25

But that's not the situation we have here, and
20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

in other cases where the Court has looked at statutes that

2

use common law terms, like Title VII does with respect to

3

the term, agent, it has felt a lot more freedom to adjust

4

that common law term to the purposes of the statute, and I

5

would point you to the Faragher case and the Kolstadt case

6

as two examples of that, and that's what the EEOC has done

7

here.

8
9

It has adapted that common law principle in
light of the fact that we have an established tradition in

10

the courts, well-established, of looking at the question

11

of partnership in a functional way, does this person

12

actually operate as a proprietor of the business, or is

13

this a partner in name only, and it makes perfect sense

14

for the EEOC to apply that same kind of functional

15

analysis in deciding whether shareholder-directors are

16

employees, because for purposes of deciding who should get

17

the protection of the act, and that's what we're talking

18

about primarily here, there is no practical difference

19

between shareholder-directors who run a business and

20

partners who run a business, and so it makes sense to --

21

to use the same test.

22

Applying the same test also makes sense in light

23

of the purposes of the small business exemption, because

24

the purpose of that exemption is to spare small businesses

25

the very substantial burdens of complying with the
21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

nondiscrimination laws, and those burdens are experienced

2

in exactly the same way regardless of whether those who

3

choose to organize a small business do so through a

4

partnership form or a corporate form, and the -- the

5

analysis that the tests should be the same across the

6

board also makes --

7

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question about the

8

application of your test?

9

the case, as I understand it --

10

MR. GORNSTEIN:

11

QUESTION:

You -- you urge us to remand

Yes, we do.

-- to answer the question whether

12

these individuals operate independently and manage and

13

control the business on the one hand, or are subject to

14

the organization's control on the other, and I ask you, is

15

it not possible that the same individual could meet both

16

halves of that test?

17

MR. GORNSTEIN:

18

QUESTION:

No.

Some of his duties, he'd be manager,

With respect to advising

What -- what we have here under

5

the EEOC's guidance is, ultimately you make an overall

6

judgment that's either-or, based on all the considerations

7

in the guidance, and they are at page 9 of our brief, so

8

that, just as in the partnership context, you look at all

9

of these factors, and just as you would in an independent

10

contractor status kind of situation, you look at all the

11

relevant factors, and then you make an overall judgment

12

about, essentially does this person function as a

13

proprietor of the business, or is he functioning as an

14

employee of the business overall.

15

QUESTION:

Why isn't it simpler just to say,

16

well, they picked a corporate form with their eyes open

17

because it was important for them to be labeled employees,

18

at least for retirement purposes, so they have to take the

19

bitter with the sweet.

20

they could have their retirement plans, and then it's just

21

much simpler to say, that's the form that they chose, and

22

the law for many -- in many contexts does follow what --

23

the form parties choose for their arrangement.

24

shouldn't that be the answer?

25

They got that qualification so

EEOC has taken is to -- is a functional approach that

2

tries to treat all people alike, and to look to the real

3

functional relationship between the individual and the

4

employee, and the fact that somebody may have chosen to do

5

something for tax consequences, or chose to do something

6

for purposes of limiting individual liability, really

7

doesn't have anything to do with whether he is the sort of

8

person who should receive protection under the

9

nondiscrimination laws, and this is ultimately what we are

10

determining here, are these shareholder-directors people

11

who are employees and therefore receive protection under

12

the nondiscrimination laws, because it's only those people

13

who are the --

14

QUESTION:

Well, I thought we were looking to

see if some other, lower employee was covered, not these

question you have in front of you, which is, is this a

25

small business and does this employee get protection, you

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

first have to answer the question of, are these

2

shareholder-directors employees who get protection under

3

the law, so that is the inevitable product of having to

4

decide the small business exemption, is that you have to

5

decide, these are people who get protection under the

6

laws, and it -- it's just not the case that the policies

7

that underlie decisions about incorporation having to do

8

with tax consequences and individual liability have

9

anything to do with whether these are the kind of people

10

who should receive protection under the nondiscrimination

11

laws.

12

QUESTION:

Well, I just thought Congress was

13

more concerned with not making really small businesses

14

covered by these acts, that we weren't focused on whether

15

these professional shareholders should be covered, but

16

whether this was the kind of small business that shouldn't

17

be covered at all.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

18
19

Well -- I'm sorry, Justice

O'Connor.

20

QUESTION:

Is that right?

21

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I -- what Congress did in the

22

small business exemption is to link the exemption to the

23

number of people who receive protection under the laws,

24

and that makes sense, because it means that at most, when

the small business exemption applies, at most, 14

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG A. CRISPIN

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. CRISPIN:

7
8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The position of the clinic and the Government in

9
10

this case essentially is to look to ignore the form and

11

structure of the corporate business, yet just 2 years ago,

12

in Cedric Kushner versus King, this Court held that a sole

13

shareholder was separate and distinct from the corporate

14

structure itself, and that's the -- the essence of the

15

question.

16

QUESTION:

17

there, Mr. Crispin?

18

What kind of a legal issue was it
What act were we construing?

MR. CRISPIN:

That was a RICO question, and the

19

question was whether or not the two parts of the -- the

20

RICO enterprise on the one hand and the -- the other

21

aspect of the RICO question existed with both the

22

individual sole shareholder and director of the

23

corporation as being separate and distinct from the

24

corporation itself, and in that case the Court said, you

25

cannot collapse the two.
26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The defense position was, they are, in fact, the

2

same identity, and this Court said no, that's not true.

3

What -- the corporate structure is something separate and

4

distinct, which is recognized by this Court, has been

5

recognized for years and years and years, and that that is

6

something that cannot and should not be ignored.

7

QUESTION:

Well, the -- the reason we said it

8

was that we couldn't find any basis in the statutory

9

history or the text that -- that gave us a clue that

10

Congress, in effect, wanted to ignore something which is

11

such hornbook law.

12

The argument on the other side, I think, is that

13

there is a reason to think Congress would want to look

14

at -- at nontraditional concepts here.

15

that the common law definition of employee does not

16

axiomatically apply because it's not addressing the issue

17

that Congress was addressing in that -- in this statute.

18

The issue that Congress was addressing in this statute, as

19

I understand the argument, in fact taking the -- the very

20

words that Mr. Gornstein used a moment ago, was the issue

21

of protecting people who can be hurt by discrimination.

22

It was a protection issue.

23

The argument is

So that I think what he's saying, and -- and

24

what the petitioner's counsel are saying is, the one thing

25

that we do know about employees is that they were people
27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

who were intended to be protected by this statute.

If

2

that is true, it is not probable that they were trying to

3

include as employees, the protected category, people who

4

don't need protection because they are in ultimate control

5

of the business, the ones who, if there's going to be

6

discrimination, are going to be doing the discriminating,

7

so it's probable that the people who have that ultimate

8

control would intend it to be within the employee

9

category.

10

address.

That's an issue that the common law didn't

11

How do you respond to that argument?

12

MR. CRISPIN:

Justice Souter, the individuals

13

that are subject to discrimination in this particular case

14

are not only the lower-level employees as this case

15

presents.

16

of those could come down with a disability and have the

17

remaining three shareholders refuse to accommodate or

18

otherwise violate the ADA with respect to that one

19

individual, so the -- the individual --

We have four shareholder-directors, and any one

QUESTION:

20

So you're saying, even on the premise

21

of their argument, it does not exclude any one of the

22

four.

23

MR. CRISPIN:

24

QUESTION:

25

That's correct.

I suppose if one of the four had a

51 percent, a truly indefeasibly controlling interest,
28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you'd concede that, but short of that, which apparently is

2

not the case here, you say, even if I take their premises,

3

they lose.
MR. CRISPIN:

4

That's right, Your Honor, I --

5

although I -- let me comment that I'm not sure I would

6

concede the 51 percent, all -- I would concede it for your

7

hypothetical.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. CRISPIN:

10

Yes, right.
But our position is that the

employing enterprise is the determining factor.
QUESTION:

11

How -- how does the EEOC treat an

12

ordinary corporation that, let's say, has 12 regular

13

employees and then three directors, the cousin, the

14

father, the son, or whatever, of the owner, so there -- so

15

it's as -- if you count the three -- and it's a perfectly

16

ordinary corporation.

17

Do they count those three directors, or not, as employees?
MR. CRISPIN:

18

There's nothing special about it.

As I read their position, I -- I

19

believe that they, under the new guidance, would count

20

those directors under their balancing test.

21

apply the -- this multiple-factor balancing test, look at

22

the degree of control, and decide on a case-by-case basis.
QUESTION:

23

They would

So remember, these three are just

24

cousins.

They're not -- I mean, they only show up once a

25

year, and they vote, and -- and that's it.

That's their

connection.

MR. CRISPIN:

QUESTION:

MR. CRISPIN:

would not be counted.

7

MR. CRISPIN:

8

Well, in that case, Your Honor --

They don't count?
They don't count, because they're

not performing services -QUESTION:

9

All right.

Then -- and those are

10

people who the common law really would consider to be

11

employees, at least while they're there for that hour a

12

year, is that right?
MR. CRISPIN:

13

I'm not sure what the answer would

14

be.

15

who performs services for the corporation --

16

We know that -- that employee is considered a person

QUESTION:

Well, they're there once a year for

MR. CRISPIN:

Now, of course, under the ADA

we're looking at numbers of employees over 20 weeks within

5

a calendar year.

6

QUESTION:

Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

7

MR. CRISPIN:

But again, the idea, as this Court

8

recognized in Walters versus Metro Educational, was that

9

the determinations under the employment discrimination

10

statutes should be subject to ready and easy

11

determination.

12

should be avoided, but yet the Government's test and the

13

clinic's test, which has adopted the Government's test,

14

would have this Court look at the facts in each individual

15

case every time --

Complex and expensive factual inquiries

QUESTION:

16

Well, don't we have to give some

17

weight to the EEOC view?

18

completely?
MR. CRISPIN:

19
20

Do you just want to ignore it

No, Your Honor.

The Skidmore

deference is appropriate, Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION:

21

Why?

Why, because I would think then

22

you lose.

I mean, here -- if I'm very frank about it,

23

there are two competing things here, and the one thing,

24

give weight to the agency, let them define these terms,

25

particularly at the margin, but that's Hearst, and -- and
31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the other is, no, no, it doesn't matter what they say, pay

2

no attention whatsoever to what they say.

3

to do is follow the common law definition.

What they have
That's Darden.

So if Darden applies, I take it you win, but if

4
5

Darden doesn't apply, it seems to be much harder for you

6

to win, because then the agency should get deference under

7

Skidmore, at least, in applying the term, and the agency

8

here has a different definition than the one that helps

9

you.
So that's where I am, and I'm quite uncertain

10
11

about it.
MR. CRISPIN:

12

Your Honor, two -- two responses

13

to your question.

Under Darden, it -- it does -- the

14

Court has decided that the common law applies, and we

15

would say that's appropriate.

16

Darden dealt with the independent contractor versus

17

employee test.

18

but the key concept is that the common law applies is

19

appropriate.

The precise test under

That is not absolutely translatable here,

20

The second aspect of your question, Your Honor,

21

was on the deference entitled to the EEOC opinion, and as

22

I understand Skidmore deference, it's only that deference

23

which is appropriate under the circumstances of their

24

test.

25

leads to inconsistent results, and it fails to further

In this case, the EEOC's test is not workable.

It

1

the -- the interests that are looked at under the statute,

2

and I can turn to those points.

3

QUESTION:

Doesn't it, perhaps better than the,

4

just straight common law, of course, deal with the coming

5

of -- of age, so to speak, of the professional

6

corporation, which really didn't -- didn't amount to much,

7

if -- if it even existed 20 or 25 years ago?

8
9

MR. CRISPIN:
it, but it need not.

Mr. Chief Justice, it may address

It need not treat a corporation,

10

whether it's a professional corporation or a general

11

corporation, differently --

12

QUESTION:

No, it need not, but it has chosen to

13

do so, and the -- the question, I guess, before us is,

14

under Skidmore deference, is that a reasonable decision?

15

MR. CRISPIN:

It's not a reasonable decision in

16

looking at the professional corporation as the EEOC's test

17

would apply to it, and -- and the reasons are that, as --

18

as the EEOC and the clinic has suggested, an important

19

issue is one of consistency, yet applying their test does

20

not lead to consistent results.

21

One can imagine the -- the circumstance of a

22

professional corporation with one shareholder-director and

23

14 employees. Under their test, that individual

24

corporation would not be covered.

25

It has fewer than 15.

Take the situation, though, where there are 14,
33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

15 director-shareholders of the professional corporation

2

and 14 employees, a business nearly twice the size of the

3

first one, and yet that one would be covered because of

4

the 15 employees.

5

QUESTION:

Are you -- are you basing your

6

estimate of what the EEOC would cover on the materials set

7

forth in the Government's brief at page 9?

8
9

MR. CRISPIN:

Well, as I -- as I read the test,

what the EEOC would do in that circumstance would look at

10

the number of employees, and the 15 employees, whether

11

there was 1 or 14 shareholders would make no difference,

12

and -- and yet with 15 or 14, or 15 or 25 shareholders,

13

whether or not they were considered employees or not, the

14

15 individual employees would be enough to provide

15

coverage, yet take the same circumstance and back off the

16

one with the number of employees, and under the EEOC's

17

test, it would be a factual shareholder-by-shareholder

18

determination which would be required to determine whether

19

this company -- corporation is, in fact, covered or not.

20

And so we have the situations where many more

21

entities, enterprises with a lot of people working for

22

them, which may not be covered on the one hand, and down

23

the street a very similar corporation --

MR. CRISPIN:

2

That -- that's right, unless they

have less than 15 employees, but yet in a professional

corporation as we have here, the individual shareholders

are performing services for the corporation.

that's the business of the corporation, is to provide the

11

they -- and yet the EEOC would -- would put a factual

individuals were, in fact, employees.
The interest of predictability would be lost in

individuals, the enterprise, the nurse, the secretary, all

they have to do is look at their paycheck to see if it's a

able to sue if there is discrimination likely?

exclusively dealing with employment matters, yes, we see

11

that, individuals who are quite concerned.

13

indicate that fear of retaliation for bringing a claim is

But if there are no -- if they're not

protected, they have no claim to make.
MR. CRISPIN:

That's true.

If they -- if they

19

know they're not protected, then they -- they don't risk

20

the kind of retaliation for raising the claim, and they go

21

on and just do their jobs.

22

QUESTION:

So I'm quite -- still -- I hate to go

23

back to this, but it seems to me there might be millions

24

of small businesses in the country that have about 10 or

25

12 employees where if you count their directors, they are

won't be, and I'm curious about the practical effect of

the facts are?

MR. CRISPIN:

Do you have any sense of what

I think the numbers are

8

significant, that there are quite a number of -- of small

businesses in that category, professional corporations,

10

but whether that's a factor that should enter into the

11

Court is, of course, your decision, not mine, but if

12

Congress -- but the -- the touchstone of that question,

13

then, would be, though, the intent of -- of Congress,

whether Congress intended the term, employee, to have a

common law application and, if that's the case, then they

should be, in fact, covered.

That's what Congress wanted

How do you respond to the famous two

19

clinic examples, one is set up as a partnership and one is

20

a professional corporation?

21

MR. CRISPIN:

Well, Your Honor, Number -- I've

22

got two responses to that.

Number 1, it -- it's one

23

example of a way that it would provide inconsistent

24

results, but I just talked about a different one which is

25

very different, which provides inconsistent results by

their test.
Second, this Court has never held that a

3

partnership is not subject to Title VII or ADA because

4

it's a partnership.

5

that, and Justice Powell in his concurring opinion in the

6

Hishon case did, in fact, address that, but this Court has

7

never so held.

8

address in this opinion, but it is something that the

9

Court may want to look at in terms of, under the -- for

10

example, under the Restatement Second of Agency in 1958,

11

the partnership was recognized as being able to have

12

employees as members of its partners who were performing

13

services for that partnership, so --

14

Some of the lower courts have done

That's not a question that this Court need

QUESTION:

Are you making a distinction between

15

owner-directors who are also working every day providing

16

the services of the entity, and owner-directors who are

17

not involved in the day-to-day service delivery function

18

of the enterprise?

19

MR. CRISPIN:

Justice Ginsburg, I -- I

20

believe -- I believe your question addresses whether those

21

directors who are not involved day-to-day --

22

QUESTION:

Right.

23

MR. CRISPIN:

-- would be covered as employees,

24

but the common law test, as I understand it, is that

25

there's a question of compensation.

If the services are

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

being provided, and there's compensation for those

2

services, then the individual would be counted as an

3

employee and, as we indicated earlier, the question under

4

the ADA deals with five work days in 20 different weeks,

5

so the -- the director who comes in just on occasional

6

basis, even if compensated, would not be enough to -- to,

7

typically to add another employee.

8

QUESTION:

Well, if you say the director gets a

9

fee, and the meetings are not frequent but the director is

10

expected to remain au courant with what's going on in the

11

business, so how do we judge that?

12

the -- for the hour of the meeting that director counts.

13

MR. CRISPIN:

We can't say, only

Your Honor, the -- the decision of

14

this Court in, in the A -- in determining what employees

15

count for ADA purposes was, the -- the decision was the

16

payroll method, and looked to the payroll, whether an

17

individual is on the payroll for 5 days of the week for

18

20 weeks in the preceding or current calendar year, so the

19

director, if that director is performing services adequate

20

to put him or her on the payroll for the entire week,

21

would be counted as an employee for that particular week.

22

I -- I would suggest that that would be a rare

23

occasion where a director who had no other role in the

24

company but to come in and sit in on a meeting or keep up

25

with things would appear on the payroll, but if they were,
39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

then they should be counted as employees, because they are

2

performing services, receiving compensation, and then it

3

just simply moves into the -- the method of counting those

4

employees.
QUESTION:

5

In any event, the director, the

6

owner-directors, shareholder-directors that we have here

7

are working for the corporation every day, and they are on

8

salary?
MR. CRISPIN:

They are on salary.

They work

every day.

from liability for all but that small category of exposure

13

to malpractice cases --

14

The compensation or revenue they produce goes

QUESTION:

They enjoy the corporate shield

Why is that small, when you're

15

talking about a professional medical corporation?

16

seems to me that that would be the biggest liability, not

17

the small --

18

MR. CRISPIN:

It

It very well may be the largest

19

monetary, but one could -- could list a number of things,

20

such as liability on the leasehold, liability for employee

21

claims, liability for employment contracts, liability for

22

tax payments, that would be the liability of the

23

corporation, and for which the individual shareholder-

24

directors would not have --

QUESTION:

But with -- with malpractice, don't

1

you have a much greater likelihood of punitive damages and

2

things like that, that you don't have arising just out of

3

a contract claim?

4

MR. CRISPIN:

Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice,

5

that -- that is correct, and so, from the -- the monetary

6

standpoint, as I said, that would be the greatest problem,

7

but the -- the idea of limited liability exists in this

8

corporation, as it does, in fact, in the limited liability

9

partnerships and limited liability companies, and if the

10

touchstone is whether there are corporate limited

11

liability features, then it doesn't make any difference

12

whatsoever whether we're dealing with a limited liability

13

partnership, limited liability corporation, a professional

14

corporation, or a general corporation, individuals would

15

be employees if they met the requirements otherwise.

16

If there are no other questions, I'll conclude.

Does the EEOC count directors as employees?

22

Generally, in -- in business law there's a big difference

between a director, an officer, a shareholder, and an

employee, so as I read the EEOC guidance, that is a

25

vehicle through which businesses, courts, and the EEOC can

1

look at an individual and determine, well, is the -- is

2

the label, director, in this circumstance appropriate, or

3

are they really functioning as an employee?
You can, of course, have inside directors, that

4
5

is, employees who are appointed to the board of directors,

6

or you can have outside directors in some circumstances

7

where they aren't affiliated except in an advisory role,

8

as a member of the board, and they -- members of the board

9

of directors could be paid or they could be not paid, and

10

I don't think that's an issue that should necessarily be

11

determinative on deciding whether or not they are an

12

employee.

13

The court of appeals here did not look beyond

14

the fact that the shareholder-directors had organized as a

15

professional corporation, but the trial court did, and

16

looked at factors similar to those identified in the EEOC

17

guidance, and concluded that these shareholder-directors

18

were not employees.

approach the Court should take.
