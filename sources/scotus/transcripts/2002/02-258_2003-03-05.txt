Mr. Peck.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. PECK

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. PECK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In enacting section 1367, Congress took up this

10
11

Court's invitation in Finley to manage the boundaries of

12

supplemental jurisdiction.

13

It sought to provide a Federal forum for plaintiffs that

14

so chose to use it, and for -- for reasons of respect for

15

the interests of comity and federalism, it provided a

16

mechanism by which those cases may be returned to State

17

court.

It had two goals in doing so.

They knew that there was a dilemma, a dilemma

18
19

caused by the operation of statutes of limitations, and so

20

they sought to find and found a simple, practical,

21

workable solution that traveled down a well-trod path.

22

It's a path that was traveled down by the Soldier and

23

Sailors' Relief Act, a act that also tolls State statutes

24

of limitations even when exigent circumstances do not

25

exist.

And in the case in 1993 holding that, Conroy, this

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Court found that it was applicable in that instance to a

2

defendant who was a town.
It also traveled down that road in section 108

3
4

of the Bankruptcy Act.

5

day window after dismissal of the automatic stay or

6

lifting of the automatic stay for a plaintiff to file an

7

action which is otherwise purely a State matter in State

8

court.

9

This too provides that kind of 30-

This Court found in Stewart v. Kahn that there

10

is no federalism bar to congressional authority as long as

11

that authority exists someplace in the Constitution.

12

Throughout its history, pursuant to Article I, which has a

13

cognate provision duplicative of the authority it derives

14

also from Article III, Congress has used its jurisdiction-

15

setting authority as a traffic cop over the area of

16

concurrent State and Federal jurisdiction.

17

almost from the beginning in the Anti-Injunction Act, the

18

removal statute, and has always found this to be a

19

necessary incident of maintaining a dual-court system.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

It has done so

Well, the Anti-Injunction Act just

applies to Federal courts, doesn't it?
MR. PECK:

The -- it gives Federal courts the

23

authority, though, to stay a State action when it

24

interferes with the jurisdiction of the Federal court.

25

QUESTION:

It's an -- that -- that's an

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

exception to the Anti-Injunction Act.
MR. PECK:

That's an exception contained in the

3

Anti-Injunction Act, and another exception is when an act

4

of Congress so provides.

5

The choice of tolling did not attempt to give

6

longer life in State court than it would have enjoyed in

7

Federal court.

8

available in Federal court, have the matter remain there.

9

It did not change the State's policy on waiver of

It did not eliminate defenses that were

10

municipal liability or alter its statute of limitations.

11

It simply said that the case, as it stood in Federal

12

court, is now available to be heard in State court.

13

State is free to change both its waiver of immunity, its

14

statute of limitations, and Congress accepts those changes

15

regardless of the application of the supplemental

16

jurisdiction statute.

17

The

Once that jurisdiction attaches, once the

18

Federal court has authority to hear the State action, then

19

even after the Federal -- Federal claim has fallen away,

20

the court still has the jurisdiction to hear what

21

otherwise would have been a purely State claim.

22

This is unusual in a diversity case.

When

23

complete diversity is broken, the jurisdiction ends.

24

here no one, not the Supreme Court of South Carolina, not

25

the respondents, not the amici, questioned Congress'

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

But

1

authority to say that this remains a Federal matter

2

because a Federal interest has attached because the matter

3

has now been heard.

4

QUESTION:

I didn't understand it that way, I

5

thought South Carolina said, Federal court, you want to

6

take this and deal with this stale claim?

7

right with us.

8

the State's position is the Federal court can have it if

9

you keep it.

That's all

It's one of the ironies of the case that

The only thing they can't do is give it back

10

to us when we don't want it because that would be

11

commandeering the use of our courts.

12

position is the Federal court can keep our State claim in

13

Federal court.

14

remain alive.

15

South Carolina's

Indeed, it must if it wants the claim to

MR. PECK:

That -- that is correct, and even at

16

this late date, rule 60(b) would enable a plaintiff like

17

Susan Jinks to seek to reopen that Federal case, to -- to

18

reconsider its judgment and allow this case to still live

19

if -- if the tolling provision is ineffective.

20

So here what we're saying is that there's a

21

continuing Federal interest in this matter.

There's --

22

there's been a Federal attachment to what otherwise would

23

have been a purely State matter.

24

for example, South Carolina could not refuse a remand and

25

we contend that that authority which is contained in the

In a removal situation,

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

removal statute is the same kind of authority that

2

Congress is exercising here because what Congress has

3

effectively done is define the legal effect of the

4

appearance of this matter in Federal court and the Federal

5

disposition of it.

6

or any other State is not equipped, it's not authorized to

7

refuse that definition because Congress is the supreme

8

sovereign of Federal law.

And the State courts of South Carolina

So --

9

QUESTION:

We -- we know what Congress has --

10

has -- has defined.

11

the -- how would you define the important interest to the

12

Federal courts in -- in our seeing the constitutional

13

issue your way?

Why is it important?

I mean, what is

14

MR. PECK:

15

to provide this Federal forum.

16

authority to do that.

17

interest of comity which this Court has always referred to

18

as a vital consideration.

19
20
21

QUESTION:
kind of comity.

Well, first of all, Congress wanted
They clearly had the

But they also wanted to take in the

The State says, we don't want this

Keep it.

MR. PECK:

It's -- it's very nice for the State

22

to have that interest, but the federalist design of our

23

Constitution provides that impetus that Congress was

24

acting on.

25

QUESTION:

No, but I -- I want to get down to

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

specifically what's important to the Federal courts and to

2

Congress.

3

MR. PECK:

Well --

4

QUESTION:

Why would it hurt the Federal courts

5

if you lose this case?

6

what's at stake?
MR. PECK:

7

What's -- practically what's --

I -- I think there are -- there are

8

several things that might happen.

9

supplemental jurisdiction is a doctrine of discretion.

10

would be turned into a doctrine of plaintiffs' rights,

11

that if the State courts are refusing to receive these

12

case -- cases, then the Federal courts will be obligated

13

to hear these State matters even if they were novel and

14

complex matters in which only the State courts have the

15

appropriate expertise to hear it.

16

cause some problems.
QUESTION:

17

Right now what we call
It

And I think that would

What difference does complexity make

18

if the State Federal court's position is we don't want to

19

clutter up Federal courts with a lot of State tort --

20

garden variety, simple State tort claims?

21

to be a fender bender court.
MR. PECK:

22

We don't want

And I think it is perfectly

23

legitimate in Congress' jurisdiction-setting authority for

24

them to make that determination.

25

are --

These are matters that

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

The -- the idea is that Federal

2

courts should be occupied with Federal cases and not with

3

State cases.
MR. PECK:

4

And I -- I think that is an

5

appropriate -- appropriate reason for Congress to adopt

6

this kind of a statute to assure that that happens.
The other -- Justice Souter, the other possible

7
8

consequence is that plaintiffs, fearful that a Federal

9

court will not hear their matter, will not take it back if

10

the -- the State courts will not accept the matter, may be

11

left without a cause of action on their State claim, that

12

they will suddenly be shut out the door.

13

to --

14
15
16

QUESTION:

And in order

And how is that going to hurt the

Federal courts?
MR. PECK:

That does not necessarily hurt the

17

Federal courts, but Congress certainly has a right to be

18

concerned for those litigants and try to --

19

QUESTION:

Why -- why isn't the person to be

20

concerned for those litigants the State courts under whose

21

law the litigants want to sue?

22

MR. PECK:

Because -- because, Justice Souter,

23

here the State courts have -- have -- Congress has

24

basically done one thing.

25

the idea of comity that this Court had talked about in

They've -- they've looked at

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Guaranty Trust, in Ragan, and -- and what they said is

2

that comity is a reciprocal process.

3

two-way street.

4

It's got to have a

And so what we're doing is we're not giving

5

longer life in Federal court to what's in State court.

6

have the authority to assign to the State courts a matter

7

that is purely Federal in nature.

8

that has a Federal interest because of the intervention of

9

its arrival in Federal court, and because of that, we have

Now we have a matter

10

enough authority also to say that this is a matter that

11

the State courts can't refuse.

12

that we do not recognize the authority here --

13

QUESTION:

We

They can't suddenly say

But comity is traditionally a matter

14

of consent rather than having one sovereign impress its --

15

its law on the other.

16

MR. PECK:

I mean, it's consensual.

It is consensual, but then again, the

17

-- the idea behind comity is tied up with our -- our

18

federalism and our idea that we have a dual court system.

19

That dual court system recognizes that there will be

20

conflicts.

21

between the Federal and State systems.

22

is what Congress is trying to police.

23

There will be some -- some difficulties
Those difficulties

It's a -- it's a function that they have

24

performed repeatedly, and the removal statute is a very

25

good example of that.

And certainly Congress could insist

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

-- could insist that the State courts receive back even a

2

matter that the Federal court erroneously dismissed rather

3

than remand it.

4

And here they're not asking the South Carolina

5

courts to do anything that they don't normally do.

6

-- a matter is --

7

QUESTION:

If a

Well, they're asking the South

8

Carolina courts to grant relief in a case that is outside

9

the statute of limitations.

10
11

I take it they don't -- the

South Carolina courts don't normally do that.
MR. PECK:

South Carolina courts, as -- as we

12

cited in the -- the Hilton Head and Moriarty decisions,

13

has said that they will sometimes waive the statute of

14

limitations in the interest of justice.

15

Another instance in which they waive that issue

16

is when venue has been misapplied.

17

demand that venue be placed in one particular place, you

18

file in that wrong place, the statute of limitations

19

expires before that court acts on it, they say it has

20

jurisdiction to transfer it to the proper venue.

21

QUESTION:

When -- when they

Well, would this case come out

22

differently in the State?

23

neighboring State, had no such waiver.

24

come out differently there?

25

MR. PECK:

Supposing Georgia, a
Would this case

I don't think so, and the reason I

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

don't think so is because when all that is left in the

2

Federal court is a matter that is otherwise a State-based

3

claim, that Federal court sits as just another court of

4

that jurisdiction, another court within that State's

5

system.

6

to be treated, when Congress so authorizes -- and

7

Congress, exercising that Article III, that necessary and

8

proper powers that it had, utilizing the Supremacy Clause,

9

authorizes that this be treated essentially by tolling as

10
11

And for that reason -- for that reason, it ought

meeting the statute of limitations.
They have the right to define the meaning of

12

what the Federal law is here, and that is simply what

13

they've done.

14

provision that is not unlike other tolling provisions

15

throughout the law.

16

they've done something that they have the authority to do.

17

They've done it by adopting a tolling

And here it's clear that they --

Tolling comports completely with the federalist

18

design of the Constitution, enables the court's

19

consideration of what court is best positioned to

20

adjudicate.

21

Here -- and it's -- and it -- it is doing that by allowing

22

the courts to control their own borders of what is

23

appropriate to them and what is not.

24
25

That is decidedly a jurisdictional decision.

QUESTION:

I thought the South Carolina Supreme

Court agreed that as far as the Federal courts are

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

concerned, this is all fine.

2

the Federal courts having to sit on a case that no longer

3

has a Federal element.

4

legitimate Federal purpose.

5

So it was necessary to spare

That's fine.

It serves a

But, says South Carolina, you can't -- it isn't

6

proper to tell us then -- they can dump it.

7

They can't tell us that we have to pick it up.

8
9
10
11
12

MR. PECK:

That's fine.

That is indeed what they've said.

But Stewart v. Kahn says otherwise.
QUESTION:

That was a -- that was a Civil War

tolling of the statute of limitations.
MR. PECK:

That is correct.

It found that

13

within the war power, Congress had the authority to toll

14

the statute of limitations in a State action brought in

15

State court.

16

overlay that prevents the use of that war powers

17

authority.

18

Obviously then there is no Tenth Amendment

Here they have similar authority, both in

19

Article I, section 8, to establish the inferior courts, as

20

well as Article III where there's a cognate phrase, and

21

that authority has to be equivalent.

22

authority also with respect to bankruptcy, again deriving

23

from section 8.

24
25

They've used that

And so here again there's no question that these
other tolling provisions have been properly used.

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

No one

1

has questioned their constitutionality in recent times,

2

and this simply adopts a longstanding congressional

3

approach to this issue.

4

previously approved.

5

It's one that this Court has

If -- if the respondent has his way, enormous

6

mischief will result.

7

Hobbesian choice, a choice that they have been

8

uncomfortable with in which you've seen courts granting

9

motions for reconsideration, courts requiring waivers of a

10

statute of limitations, so having much the same effect --

11

and clearly when tolling does that, it is clearly

12

appropriate to the judicial power -- and in other

13

instances, simply holding onto a case they would otherwise

14

allow the State courts to do, again in the interest of the

15

federalist overlay in our Constitution.
QUESTION:

16

You leave the courts with a

Well -- well, isn't it -- if --

17

suppose you should not prevail here.

18

bring -- the plaintiff would bring two actions, bring --

19

bring a protective action in the State court within the

20

statute of limitations and then that would solve the

21

problem, wouldn't it?
MR. PECK:

22

Well, then you just

But that -- that's an unworkable

23

solution.

Congress sought to avoid that.

Congress wanted

24

to give a Federal forum capable of hearing all matters

25

that a plaintiff would expect a single court to hear.

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

And

1

by filing a protective action of that sort, first of all,

2

you could not stop the State court from continuing to

3

proceed, possibly eclipsing in speed the Federal court and

4

coming up with res judicata on their Federal claim, as

5

well as the fact that you may be signaling the Federal

6

court that on the State matter we have a preference to be

7

in State court when that really isn't the case.

8
9

I -- I would -- if there are no further
questions, I would like to reserve the rest of my time.

10

QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Peck.

11

Mr. Lamken, we'll hear from you.

12

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN

13

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS INTERVENOR

14
15
16
17
18

MR. LAMKEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The tolling provision at issue here is within
Congress' constitutional powers for two reasons.
First, it establishes the legal effect of a

19

distinctly Federal set of events:

20

and dismissal of an action in Federal court over a

21

defendant over whom the court can exercise jurisdiction.

22

the filing, pendency,

Second, it serves legitimate Federal interests,

23

ensuring that if plaintiffs are held harmless for having

24

selected a Federal forum in the first instance and

25

ensuring that Federal courts are not required to exercise

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

jurisdiction and decide cases that involve potentially

2

sensitive issues of State law that are more reliably and

3

more appropriately decided in the State court.

4

Because municipalities are not States or arms of

5

the States, sovereign immunity does not prevent them from

6

being hailed into Federal court and it doesn't prevent the

7

Federal courts from exercising jurisdiction over cases

8

against them, including supplemental State law claims.

9

Congress can establish the rules for when

10

Federal courts should hear such claims and the rules for

11

when they should not.

12

authority to establish reasonable rules about the legal

13

consequences of the pendency of the Federal action, of the

14

filing of the claim, its pendency, and the court's

15

decision to dismiss it under specified rules that Congress

16

itself has established.

17

Congress has corresponding

The rule established here falls within the

18

tradition of Federal control over the effect of Federal

19

proceedings.

20

legal effect of the filing of a bankruptcy petition which

21

stays all the actions that are against the debtor and

22

tolls the State limitations periods during the pendency of

23

the automatic stay.

24
25

It falls in the tradition of, for example,

Or the removal provision which takes cases out
of State courts, stays the proceedings in State courts,

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

and thus prevents the State courts from proceeding in a

2

way such as by deeming the case constructively dismissed

3

that might have the effect of causing the statute of

4

limitations to continue to run.
And the effect of a Federal -- a judgment of a

5
6

Federal court case.
All these are matters that are controlled by

7
8

Federal law, and that Federal law is no less binding on

9

State courts adjudicating State causes of action,

10

including against municipalities, than they are on Federal

11

courts.

12
13
14

The rule in this case serves twin Federal
interests.
First, it holds plaintiffs harmless for having

15

selected a forum -- a State -- excuse me -- a Federal

16

rather than a State forum in the first instance.

17

this sort of rule, plaintiffs would face the risk, if they

18

chose a Federal forum, of having the statute of

19

limitations run on their State law claims.

20

court then chose to dismiss, those State law claims would

21

be barred.

22

incentive to avoid Federal court, including for the

23

assertion of their Federal law claims.

24
25

Absent

If the Federal

And plaintiffs would have an artificial

It also serves the interests of Federal courts
in ensuring that they don't have to decide State law

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

claims that are potentially sensitive, that under the

2

standards this Court articulated in Gibbs that Congress

3

has codified in section 1367(c) and it reflects sensible

4

notions of division between State and Federal authority

5

more appropriately belong in State court and can be more

6

reliably adjudicated there.

7

This Court's decision in Stewart v. Kahn

8

establishes that there is no constitutional impediment to

9

congressional preemption of State tolling rules if it

10

serves a legitimate Federal interest, the tolling

11

provision here, like the social -- excuse me -- like the

12

Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act, the bankruptcy

13

automatic stay tolling rule, following that tradition.

14

Finally, the tolling rule here intrudes only
The timely filing of the

15

modestly on State interests.

16

State claims in Federal court serves all of the statute of

17

limitations purposes as the claim -- as the timely filing

18

of those same claims in State court.

19
20

Accordingly, we ask that the judgment of the
State supreme court be reversed.

21

If there are no further questions.

22

QUESTION:

23

Mr. Lindemann, we'll hear from you.

Thank you, Mr. Lamken.

MR. LINDEMANN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
By enacting section 1367(d), Congress has

3
4

intruded on principles of State sovereignty.

This case

5

involves more than just the tolling of a State law statute

6

of limitations.

7

where a political subdivision is involved and South

8

Carolina law is involved, specifically the South Carolina

9

Tort Claims Act -- this case involves a -- a waiver of

It involves, in this particular instance

10

State law sovereign immunity, State law governmental

11

immunity.
QUESTION:

12

What about examples cited by the

13

representative of the Solicitor General of the Soldiers'

14

and Sailors' Civil Relief Act and other Federal laws that

15

have a similar effect on South Carolina and other States?
MR. LINDEMANN:

16

Well, I would submit to the

17

Court that, first of all, the issue has never come up,

18

never been litigated in this Court, and as far as I'm

19

aware, has never been litigated in any court whether or

20

not the Soldiers' and Sailors' Act in any application is

21

-- is constitutional.
QUESTION:

22

Okay.

So you think, as far as you're

23

concerned, it would be the same problem and the same

24

result.

25

MR. LINDEMANN:

No, I do not necessarily believe

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

it will be the same result.

2

more difficult question for this Court than what was

3

facing the South Carolina Supreme Court and is presently

4

before this Court.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. LINDEMANN:

I believe it would be a much

Why?
Because you have different

7

Federal interests that are involved.

And obviously, in

8

determining whether or not the -- a statute is proper

9

under the Necessary and Proper Clause and to do a Tenth

10

Amendment analysis, you have to look at -- you have to

11

weigh the various Federal and State interests that are

12

involved.
In this particular case, which I'll elaborate

13
14

more momentarily, you have very superficial, I would

15

submit, Federal interests involved compared to a very

16

substantial State interest of determining whether or not

17

the State and its political subdivisions are subject to

18

suit under State law.
QUESTION:

19

But is it not -- is it not correct --

20

is it not correct that the intrusion on State sovereignty

21

-- forget the Federal side of the balance for a moment --

22

the intrusion on State sovereignty is precisely the same

23

under all these other statutes?
MR. LINDEMANN:

24
25

I would disagree, Justice

Stevens.

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

QUESTION:

Why is the intrusion in the Soldiers'

and Sailors' Civil Relief Act any different than this one?
MR. LINDEMANN:

3

The Soldiers' and Sailors' Act

4

-- it would be a very similar intrusion on the -- on the

5

State sovereignty.

6

QUESTION:

And how about the bankruptcy statute?

7

MR. LINDEMANN:

The bankruptcy -- the actual --

8

any -- any of these statutes that have been cited by the

9

petitioners and by the Government that actually provide

10

for a stay of a State court action I think are

11

substantially different because I would submit to the

12

Court that a stay of a State court action, whether it's

13

pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to the removal

14

statutes, any of -- Anti-Injunction Act, any of those does

15

not have the same effect upon State sovereignty because

16

it's not changing the actual liability of the defendant,

17

in this particular case, Richland -QUESTION:

18

Well, neither does this statute

19

change the liability.

20

action.

It just preserves the cause of

21

MR. LINDEMANN:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

I --

Just like the Soldiers' and Sailors'

statute.
MR. LINDEMANN:

I -- I would respectfully

disagree, Justice Stevens, because what has occurred in

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

this particular case is Richland County was entitled to

2

State law sovereign immunity once 2 years passed from the

3

date of the loss.

4

lawsuit was filed in State court -QUESTION:

5
6

And at -- at the point that this

Wouldn't it be entitled to sovereign

immunity if a sailor had -- had sued them too?
MR. LINDEMANN:

7

Well, that's why I was trying to

8

distinguish the stay cases from the Soldiers' and Sailors'

9

Act.

I think the Soldiers' and Sailors' Act issue is a

10

much closer question and there what you're weighing is

11

much more substantial Federal interests.

12

QUESTION:

I'm -- I'm just looking at it from

13

the State's point of view in the point of my questions.

14

It did not seem to me that the State interest in it being

15

immune was any different in any of those situations.

16

MR. LINDEMANN:

Well, I would -- I would submit

17

that there is no difference in the Soldiers' and Sailors'

18

context, but there would be a major difference in any of

19

the situations involving a stay.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Lindemann, I don't -- I don't see

21

what difference it makes that the statute of limitations

22

in this case was applied to -- to what you call State

23

sovereign immunity.

24

this entity, Richmond -- Richland County, was -- was not

25

entitled to sovereign immunity as we know it under Federal

That is, you -- you acknowledge that

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

law.

2

MR. LINDEMANN:

3

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

But you're saying that the State

4

wished to confer upon Richland County a shorter statute of

5

limitations for suit against it than -- than this Federal

6

statute permits.
Why is that any -- any different from applying

7
8

the same statute against South Carolina's determination

9

that a private individual should not be suable after 2

10

years?

11

the person being affected by it is a private individual or

12

Richland County?

13

Carolina, Federal sovereign immunity law is not -- is not

14

at issue.

15
16

What difference does it make whether -- whether

So long as it's not the State of South

What do we care?
MR. LINDEMANN:

case involving the Eleventh Amendment.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. LINDEMANN:

19

Well this, Your Honor, is not a

Exactly.
This is not a case that is

involving Federal constitutional immunity.

20

QUESTION:

Exactly.

21

MR. LINDEMANN:

This is a case that was brought

22

-- a negligence case that was brought in State court

23

against a State governmental -- or a local governmental

24

entity in the State of South Carolina to which South

25

Carolina law should apply.

And the reason why we contend

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

that this violates the Tenth Amendment is it intrudes into

2

the areas of State sovereignty to determine, number one,

3

what South Carolina law provides; number two, how South

4

Carolina law determines whether or not their own

5

governmental entities are subject to suit.
QUESTION:

6

But, Mr. Lindemann, one of the

7

curiosities about this case is if the Federal court, once

8

the Federal claim dropped out, decided that it would clean

9

-- clean up the operation, it would keep it in Federal

10

court, there would be a Federal court adjudicating South

11

Carolina's State law case.

12

would be State rules.

13

okay with us.

14

court and apply it there and -- but we don't want it back.

15

In other words, we want to force our cases to be litigated

16

into -- in the Federal court.

17

whole lot of sense.

And South Carolina says, that's

They can take our law into the Federal

MR. LINDEMANN:

18

The only regulating rules

And that doesn't make a

Well, it's not as much that

19

they're trying to force the Federal court to litigate the

20

case.

Obviously, the plaintiff chose that forum to start

21

with.

And Congress has deemed -- has provided for

22

supplemental jurisdiction.

23

provided a forum in Federal court for the litigation of

24

these State law claims.

25

said, you can't give it back to us, but what South

So obviously Congress has

And so South Carolina has not

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Carolina had said is that in the interim, if there's a

2

dismissal without prejudice of the State law claims in

3

another court, whether it be the Federal district court or

4

whether it be in a court of another State, if there's a

5

dismissal without prejudice under South Carolina law,

6

that's considered as if the suit had never been brought in

7

the first place.

8
9

QUESTION:

In other words, you're saying it's

all right with us if the Federal court adjudicates this

10

purely State claim.

The State isn't offended by that, but

11

it is offended by getting it back even though everyone had

12

notice in ample time within the -- the county had ample

13

notice because they received a Federal summons and

14

complaint.

15

involved.

So there was no question of -- of repose

But there's one -- another aspect of this, it

16
17

seems to me, passing strange.

18

removal statute would be vulnerable to a similar attack?

19

Because that's really -- if you're talking about State

20

court, this is wrenching a case out of the State court,

21

ousting the State court of jurisdiction, putting it into

22

the Federal court.

23

sending it back, then you'd certainly object to lifting it

24

out.

25

Are you suggesting that the

I would think if you're right about

MR. LINDEMANN:

I don't believe the interest

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

here is that South Carolina has a problem with -- with the

2

Federal court deciding issues of State law, and I don't

3

think South Carolina has a problem with deciding those

4

issues itself.

5

particular case is with Congress expanding upon State law

6

that actually set the boundaries as to when and how a

7

political subdivision can be sued.

8
9

The problem South Carolina has in this

QUESTION:

What difference does it make whether

it's a political subdivision or not?

Suppose South

10

Carolina law said, gas stations shall be immune from suit

11

except that you can sue them within two years, and then

12

the same situation occurs.

13

court be intruding upon South Carolina's decision of

14

immunity just as much?

15
16

MR. LINDEMANN:

Would -- would not the Federal

South -- yes, the Congress would

be intruding upon --

17

QUESTION:

So -- so --

18

MR. LINDEMANN:

-- the ability of the State of

19

South Carolina to set a statute of limitations for private

20

defendants.

21

QUESTION:

That's -- and that's all we're

22

talking about, to set a statute of limitations whether

23

it's for private defendants or whether it's for Richland

24

County which, as far as Federal law is concerned, is a

25

private defendant, or whether it's for gas stations.

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

I mean, I -- you -- you try to make something

2

different of this case by saying what it involves in -- is

3

Richland County, but what we, the Federal courts, say is

4

Richland County is not the State of South Carolina.

5

not a State entity, and as far as we're concerned, it's a

6

gas station.
MR. LINDEMANN:

7

It is

But I would submit to the Court

8

two points in response to that.

It goes beyond because

9

it's a governmental entity and you look at the application

10

of State law because again, this is a State law case

11

brought and adjudicated in a State court.

12

the State law which actually provides a greater defense

13

for a governmental entity than it does for a private

14

citizen.

And you look at

15

To give the Court an illustration --

16

QUESTION:

You would have no --

17

QUESTION:

You give greater defenses for gas

18

stations.

19

simply because you give greater defenses to gas stations?
MR. LINDEMANN:

20
21

Would -- would that change the gas station case

No, it would not change the

case.

22

QUESTION:

Of course not.

23

MR. LINDEMANN:

My point is it -- it actually

24

makes a stronger case to show the intrusion on State

25

sovereignty where you have a political subdivision.

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

And if I may illustrate.

Prior to 1985, South

2

Carolina recognized absolute sovereign immunity for its

3

State entities as well as its political subdivisions.

4

if you looked at -- the question that comes to mind is

5

whether Congress, prior to 1985, could have enacted a

6

statute that subjects Richland County, a political

7

subdivision in the State of South Carolina, to a claim for

8

negligence in the operation of its local detention center

9

where South Carolina law itself provides there is no such

10

And

claim because of sovereign immunity.
QUESTION:

11

The answer is, of course, they could

12

if they had a -- if there is a basis in the Constitution

13

for the Federal Government to pass a law that changes

14

State law.

And so usually what you ask is, is there a basis

15
16

They do it every day of the week.

here?

Of course, there is.

Indeed, was there a problem Congress was trying

17
18

to cure?

19

before the statute.

20

They say Article III.

Indeed, there is.

It was the mess that existed

Is there an infringement of what the State would

21

like to do?

22

gives the power to the Federal Government to do that.

23

Of course, there is but the Constitution

Now -- now, what's -- that -- like, you know,

24

purely I'd say hornbook.

So what -- what is the -- what

25

is the special thing about this infringement of the

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

State's power to do what it would like to do here?
MR. LINDEMANN:

I respectfully disagree with

3

you, Justice Breyer.

4

to create a situation where Richland County would be

5

liable for the operation of its detention center, it would

6

have to do so in the context of a Federal cause of action

7

which obviously existed at that time under section 1983.

8

What I'm saying is --

9

QUESTION:

If, prior to 1985, Congress wanted

So Congress in your opinion doesn't

10

have the power to -- to interfere with State law insofar

11

as it creates State laws of action?

12

pass tort reform, for example.

13

MR. LINDEMANN:

Congress couldn't

Well, I believe tort reform in

14

certain instances would be permissible.

15

that -- and certainly the -- the precedent set by this

16

Court supports this -- that Congress has the authority

17

through preemption and through its properly enacted

18

statutes to limit the liability in State court actions --

19

in State law actions, but cannot create liability where

20

none existed previously.

21

I'm not aware of any single example where Congress has

22

stepped in and created a statute that creates a -- a State

23

law cause of action or expands upon a State law cause of

24

action to create liability where none existed.

25

QUESTION:

I -- I believe

And I'd submit to the Court that

Except the Soldiers' and Sailors'

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Relief Act, for example.

2

MR. LINDEMANN:

Well, and the Soldiers' and

3

Sailors' Relief Act, if it is indeed constitutional, is

4

based upon a different weighing of the Federal interest

5

versus the State interest.

6

have much greater Federal interest involved than the

7

simple convenience to litigants to have to be able to be

8

-- have the ability to file your Federal and State claims

9

in the same Federal action without concern that your State

10

action might ultimately be dismissed after the statute of

11

limitations ran.

12

You obviously in that case

Obviously the Soldiers' and Sailors' Act

13

involves First Amendment war powers.

It involves issues

14

of national defense and deployment of armed services

15

around the country where they're not available to -- where

16

they don't have the immediate availability of access to

17

our court system.

18

different Federal interests, and would create a much

19

different issue.

20

resolve that issue I cannot say, but it would certainly

21

make a much stronger case for allowing that than the

22

simple case that is -- or the Federal interests that are

23

at stake in this particular instance.

Those are much different rights, much

And how this Court would ultimately

24

The --

25

QUESTION:

If we went back to the old ways, is

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

there any unconstitutionality in one of the things that

2

was done?

3

really State business, but I'm not going to subject the

4

plaintiff to a time bar.

5

any defendant, would you agree that you will waive the

6

statute of limitations should I dismiss this case without

7

prejudice.

8

certainly could do that.

9

MR. LINDEMANN:

And the Federal judge will say, yeah, this is

So, defendant, Richland County,

The -- the -- the State -- the county

That -- that happened frequently

10

prior to 1990, and I'm actually aware of -- personally of

11

instances even since 1990 where that's been the case --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. LINDEMANN:

14

And how about bringing --- and that obviously is the

solution.
QUESTION:

15

A plaintiff brings a protective

16

action and says, I really want this 1983 claim to be the

17

front runner, but if I fail on that, I want to have these

18

garden variety State -- whatever it is -- assault cases.

19

So the plaintiff begins a State -- a case in State court

20

and the State tort claims, the Federal case, including the

21

1983 claim.

22

MR. LINDEMANN:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

That's right.

Then that would be perfectly all

right.
MR. LINDEMANN:

That would be perfectly all

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

right, and in fact -QUESTION:

2

And all that accomplishes is having

3

two cases instead of one, which is if -- if that can be

4

avoided, it's -- for the efficiency of the system, it's a

5

pretty good idea, isn't it?
MR. LINDEMANN:

6

But realistically looking at the

7

way 1367(d) operates anyway is you often do have two

8

separate lawsuits such as what we have in this particular

9

instance.
QUESTION:

10

But that's what 1367(d) was meant to

11

overcome I thought, having two lawsuits going on, just to

12

have the -- the State court sitting there and nothing

13

happening in the event that the Federal court should

14

dismiss the Federal claim and there's a live lawsuit to

15

pick up.
MR. LINDEMANN:

16

There are many different

17

alternatives that courts dealt with this issue prior to

18

1990.

19

authority to support any finding or any conclusion that

20

litigants' due process rights were violated before 1367(d)

21

was enacted.

22

And in fact, I'd submit that there's certainly no

QUESTION:

No.

It wasn't necessary to

23

litigants.

It's just that your solution to the problem

24

permits the two parties who want to try their case in

25

Federal court to confer a jurisdiction on the Federal

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

court that the district judge believes it doesn't have and

2

doesn't want.

3

MR. LINDEMANN:

4

QUESTION:

Well, and -- and that is true.

So from a point of view of protecting

5

the State, I guess Congress dived into this mess.

6

wrote an opinion.

7

happened to involve a plagiarism.

that it seemed like a terrible mess.

23

with this procedural mess.

25

There seemed like

Each of them had something to be said for

Now -- now, why isn't that a legitimate interest
just as legitimate as the interest in protecting soldiers

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

and sailors, the interest that underlies lots of other

2

Federal legislation?
MR. LINDEMANN:

3

Well, I would submit to Your

4

Honor that that is certainly not a very substantial

5

Federal interest to the extent it is a Federal interest.
QUESTION:

6

To deal with a problem of unfairness

7

to States, unfairness to litigants, try to have a uniform

8

rule?
MR. LINDEMANN:

9

Well, I don't believe it -- it

10

creates unfairness necessary to litigants, and there are

11

obviously solutions around it -- and was dealt with by --

12

many courts dealt with this particular issue prior to

13

1990.

14

Federal interest with the State interests that are

15

involved here and -- which is obviously what -- what's the

16

analysis under the Tenth Amendment, that the result should

17

be that the State interests involved to be able to control

18

State law and State law claims, to be able to control when

19

and how State -- States and their political subdivisions

20

are subject to suit under State law, that those interests

21

far outweigh the Federal interest.

22

balancing problem.

23

And I would submit that when you balance that

Obviously it is a

Isn't -- isn't one of the questions

24

who should do the balancing?

Congress do it?

Should we do it or should

MR. LINDEMANN:

Doesn't Congress normally make this

kind of policy decision?

4

MR. LINDEMANN:

5

QUESTION:

6
7

Well --

Well, I believe in this --

And the branch of the Federal

Government that makes this kind of policy decision.
MR. LINDEMANN:

Well, there -- there's clearly

8

no -- no legislative history that suggests that Congress

9

made that particular balancing.

10

in the legislative history --

11

QUESTION:

In fact, there's nothing

No, but I assume the State of South

12

Carolina was represented in Congress at the time they made

13

that decision and could be -- could raise all these

14

objections in that forum.

15

MR. LINDEMANN:

Well, I would submit to the

16

Court that just as this Court ruled in the Raygor case

17

last term in the Tenth Amendment context, just like in the

18

Eleventh Amendment context --

19

QUESTION:

20
21

The Eleventh Amendment was really

implicated there.
MR. LINDEMANN:

-- you have to look at whether

22

or not there's a clear statement that Congress intended to

23

affect Federal-State relations such as it did.

24
25

QUESTION:

No, but I think the clear statement

rule is limited to States, and of course, counties are not

to the Court that if -- if Your Honor is suggesting that

only comes into play in Eleventh Amendment cases, that --

that -- I would disagree with that because Gregory versus

large difference in that respect.
MR. LINDEMANN:

12

We -- we are certainly not

arguing that 1367(d) is unconstitutional as applied to --

14

I mean, (a) is unconstitutional as applied to Richland

County.

this particular case, violates the Tenth Amendment.

What we're arguing is that the expansion of the

MR. LINDEMANN:

Well, Your Honor, obviously a

jurisdiction was first lodged in the State court, and as a

4

result, any type of waiver issue or any type of statute of

yes, you touched base in Federal -- in State court.

that the plaintiff is suing arising out of this particular

adjudicating stale claims.

it comes back from the Federal court.

We don't want to adjudicate claims that

I don't see practically any difference if the

MR. LINDEMANN:

The claim is still stale when

It's not so -- as Your Honor

20

pointed out earlier, it's not solely an issue of repose

21

because here because the respondent, the defendant in the

22

-- in the underlying case is a governmental entity, there

23

is a aspect of State sovereign immunity that comes into

24

play that doesn't come into play in -- in the other

25

instances.

And so you have the added interest of

preserving the right of the State in order to determine

whether it's going to waive its sovereign immunity, which

of course didn't happen until 1985, and when it does waive

waive it.

QUESTION:

And again, I'm referring to State law sovereign

So what --

I understand that.

I just don't

understand why you think we should -- we should care.

10

MR. LINDEMANN:

11

QUESTION:

Well --

If you're not talking about Federal

12

sovereign immunity of the State, why should we care if --

13

if the State chooses to create some other kind of

14

sovereign immunity that -- that isn't the kind that we're

15

concerned about?
MR. LINDEMANN:

16

Because it goes, Your Honor, to

17

the heart of exactly what the -- the State sovereignty,

18

the interests of State sovereignty that's involved in this

19

case.

20

QUESTION:

No, it doesn't.

No, it doesn't.

The

21

-- the essence of State sovereignty is everything covered

22

by Federal State sovereign immunity which is States and

23

agencies of States.

24

State sovereignty, whether -- whether they choose to make

25

Richland County a -- you know, give them some State

Everything else is not central to

sovereignty protection or -- or choose to make a gas

2

station that way.

3

I don't -- I just don't understand why you

4

expect this to impress us, that the State has gone beyond

5

Federal State sovereign immunity and created some new

6

element of State sovereign immunity.

7

they're free to do that, but I don't see how it invokes

8

any new doctrine under either the Eleventh Amendment or

9

the Tenth Amendment or any other provision of Federal law.

10

MR. LINDEMANN:

I mean, they're --

Well, I'm not submitting that it

11

creates any type of new doctrine, Your Honor.

12

suggesting is that it's an aspect of State sovereignty for

13

a State court -- I mean, for a State legislature to

14

determine what the law is in that State that is applicable

15

purely to State law claims litigated in a State court.

16

QUESTION:

Okay.

What I'm

Why isn't the answer then

17

necessarily the same whether we have a private litigant or

18

whether we have a -- a political subdivision?

19

for the private litigants, two year statute of

20

limitations.

21

State was exercising the State's -- the same sovereign

22

power in each case.

23

They said

Why isn't your answer exactly the same?

MR. LINDEMANN:

Well, I believe it would also

apply to a private litigant, and I didn't try to convey to

MR. LINDEMANN:

You don't need it.

But you don't -- you don't need it.
The private litigant doesn't have any

sovereign immunity rights under State law, but the private

11

litigant would be able to insist on the two-year statute

12

just the way the county is insisting on it here.
MR. LINDEMANN:

I believe that would be the

Court.

17

in a very limited fashion and found that 1367(d) as

18

applied to political subdivisions in South Carolina, given

19

the South Carolina Tort Claims Act and the history of

20

sovereign immunity -- State law sovereign immunity in that

21

State, that as a result, as applied to Richland County,

22

it's unconstitutional.

23

Now, that's not the issue, obviously, before this

The South Carolina Supreme Court decided this case

QUESTION:

Suppose a judge should say -- the

24

Federal judge -- knowing South Carolina's position on this

25

question, I'll keep the case, which is now an entirely

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

State case, and I know that in diversity cases I'm

2

supposed to apply the State statute of limitations.

3

the Federal judge keeps this case in deference to South

4

Carolina's position that it doesn't want it, it's too

5

late, and the Federal court in a diversity case must apply

6

the State statute of limitations, when -- when does that

7

limitation begin, when South Carolina said it would if the

8

case were reinstituted there?
MR. LINDEMANN:

9

No, Your Honor.

So if

I would -- I

10

would submit that the statute of limitations started to --

11

or ran from obviously the date of loss through -- through

12

for the two-year period, and if the case was filed in

13

Federal court within that two-year period, the statute of

14

limitations, as well as the -- the argument that sovereign

15

immunity applies, would not be applicable to that case.

16

But what occurred in this case is there was a

17

dismissal without prejudice of the State law claims.

18

Under South Carolina law, a dismissal with prejudice is

19

treated as if the suit was never brought in the first

20

place.

21

State court, it was refiled beyond the two years, at which

22

point the statute of limitations had run and at which

23

point Richland County was also entitled to absolute

24

immunity under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.

25

And as a result, when the case was refiled in the

And I would again submit to the Court that the

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

reason why we believe that this is a significant issue

2

under the Tenth Amendment for this case and why the

3

Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence of this Court does not

4

govern is -- is because of the importance of the State law

5

interest.

6

that this is not a Federal claim litigated in Federal

7

court.

8

petitioner in their briefs, the Burnett case, the Order of

9

Railroad Engineers case, all of those cases are

And the key to this whole argument is the point

In fact, the cases that have been cited by the

10

distinguishable because those are Federal causes of action

11

that are litigated in Federal court.

12

This is a State law claim that's litigated in

13

State court under purely State law, and we would submit

14

that the South Carolina General Assembly should decide

15

what is the applicable South Carolina law and that

16

Congress does not have the power under Article III and the

17

Necessary and Proper Clause to override that statement of

18

State law and to create liability where no liability

19

previously existed.

20

And that is the key point.

Congress has the authority through a validly

21

enacted statute and through use of the Supremacy Clause to

22

limit liability in State actions by providing for

23

preemption, ERISA being an example, but there is no

24

example that I'm aware of where Congress has created

25

liability where none previously existed.
