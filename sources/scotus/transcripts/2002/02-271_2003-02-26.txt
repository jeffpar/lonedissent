ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WAXMAN:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We rely on four propositions in this case.

11
12

First, there is a long final judgment in the Agent Orange

13

litigation that binds a class which by its terms includes

14

respondents.
Second, all of the judges in the direct

15
16

proceedings, the trial judges and the appellate judges,

17

concluded that all veterans should be included in the

18

class and settlement, because all of the veterans, whether

19

they were symptomatic or not, face the overwhelming

20

prospect of legal defeat on issues common to the entire

21

class, first and foremost, the Government contractor

22

defense.

23

Third, adequacy of representation was expressly

24

considered several times, both generally and with specific

25

respect to asymptomatic veterans, by both the district

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

court and the court of appeals, and fourth, there is

2

simply no question that Judge Weinstein, whose scholarship

3

on class actions the 1966 Rule 23 Advisory Committee

4

repeatedly cited, and who literally wrote the book on mass

5

tort litigation, conscientiously applied the procedures of

6

Rule 23, including, in particular, the obligation that he

7

certify and thereafter ensure adequacy of representation.

8

Now, the respondents may certainly challenge the

9

res judicata effect of the judgment against them, and the

10

question presented for this Court is the permissible scope

11

and standard of that review.

12

does not require and finality principles do not permit de

13

novo relitigation from scratch of the adequacy

14

determination made in this case.

15

QUESTION:

In our view, due process

What about notice, notice to these

16

respondents?

17

the settlement agreement and the orders that were entered,

18

that the people in respondent's category were thought to

19

be covered.

20

It's sort of hard to find, looking back at

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, Justice O'Connor, notice in

21

this case -- I think as the case comes to this Court, the

22

Court certainly cannot decide this case on the principle

23

that the notice was constitutionally inadequate.

24

first place, both the trial court and the court of appeals

25

three times found the notice adequate under Rule 23 and

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

In the

1

under the Due Process Clause. The Second Circuit below

2

suggested that this Court's decision in Amchem might have

3

made the notice defective, but notice issues were not

4

presented by the respondents in this case as an

5

alternative grounds for affirmance in their brief in

6

opposition, and what is more, their factual record in this

7

case is completely inadequate to conclude that the notice

8

was unsatisfactory with respect to the content.

9

I completely understand the argument that

10

they're making with respect to how the words, injured by

11

exposure, would have been read at the time, but one cannot

12

answer that question either in a vacuum, without looking

13

at the external circumstances, or in hindsight.

14

to determine whether, in 1984, an asymptomatic veteran, a

15

healthy veteran, would, whether all of them, many of them,

16

most of them, some of them, or some significant number

17

would have understood that that includes me because

18

exposure itself has been said to be injurious.

19

Now, at footnote 12 --

20

QUESTION:

One has

Mr. Waxman, I'd like to stop you

21

right there, exposure itself has been said to be

22

injurious.

23

people have no claim, and it did so purporting to use

24

traditional common law in interpreting the FELA, so

25

according to this Court's decision in Metro North, isn't

This Court in Metro North said, exposure only

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

it clear that these people had no ripe claim to state, and

2

how could they be adequately represented when their claim

3

had not yet accrued?

4

As I understand the law of both Louisiana and

5

New Jersey, where these cases come from, the claim doesn't

6

accrue until the exposure has manifested itself in an

7

injury, in an illness.

8

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Ginsburg, before I answer

9

that, let me just give one more answer to Justice

10

O'Connor, and I'll directly address your question.

11

The only other point I wanted to make -- I'm

12

afraid I'll forget it -- is that in footnote 12 of our

13

reply brief we point out that at the time, that is, at the

14

time of certification and before settlement, publications

15

ranging from The New York Times to Penthouse Magazine,

16

which we put at the end of our footnote, and newspapers,

17

local newspapers in the states that these two respondents

18

reside in, understood that the class included all veterans

19

in Vietnam who were -- were or may have been exposed, and

20

that's the factual issue that, without which you can't

21

resolve the notice issue in this case adverse to us.

22

Now, Justice Ginsburg --

23

QUESTION:

I'd like to ask you later how that

24

comports with, what is it, Eisen and Jacquelin.

25

you could have, if you really thought this was the class,

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

I mean,

1

given mail notice to all the veterans, all the people who

2

had served in Vietnam, and newspaper service is very nice,

3

but it's rarely seen by anyone, but anyway, let's get back

4

to --

5

MR. WAXMAN:

6

QUESTION:

Well --

-- that this Court has said, under

7

the common law, people who were merely exposed, who do not

8

have a current injury, don't have any claim.

9

never have a claim, but they certainly have no ripe claim

10
11

They may

at this stage.
MR. WAXMAN:

Well, first of all, Justice

12

Ginsburg, as you pointed out, the Metro North case, a)

13

long post dated the final judgment in this case, and --

14
15
16

QUESTION:

But it purported to apply traditional

common law.
MR. WAXMAN:

No, I do understand that, and it

17

was looking to traditional common law in order to make a

18

ruling with respect to the FELA.

19

Now, at the time, in 19 -- I mean, our

20

submission essentially is, here the adequacy determination

21

and the Article III claims sort of mesh together, but

22

our -- our submission here is that injury in fact, which

23

is what is necessary in order to include them in the

24

class, is not dependent on the existence of a mature cause

25

of action.

They clearly alleged that they were injured in

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

fact because, as New York State and other states

2

recognized at the time, there was a mature tort for

3

exposure, injury by exposure, and many, many states

4

recognized that and applied that rule at the time, and in

5

any event, whether or not they had a mature cause of

6

action, they plainly had a present right at the time and a

7

cognizable interest in the establishment of a -- of a fund

8

that would be available to compensate them.

9

word this Court --

10

QUESTION:

That's the

But were they plainly included within

11

the class, so that the class representatives would have

12

known that they were supposed to represent these people,

13

and as I understand it -- maybe you could go to -- go to

14

this point.

15

said, the first time that in writing we saw anything that

16

made it plain, even though it was buried in language

17

somewhere, that the injured class included the exposures

18

only was in the notice of settlement, and so my question

19

is, is that correct, and number 2, aside from that point,

20

why would, why should we understand that the parties

21

involved, including the representative plaintiffs,

22

understood that injured included exposures only, so that

23

they knew they were supposed to be representing them?

24
25

Your -- your friend on the other side has

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, there -- I believe there are

at least two separate questions --

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

There are.

2

MR. WAXMAN:

3

respondents in this case first.

4

never saw any notice saying anything at any time, which

5

makes -- and of course we know from Dusenbery, and before

6

that Mullane, that actual notice isn't required, so the

7

wording of the no -- these are peculiarly inappropriate

8

parties to be complaining about the wording of one of the

9

many notices that went out in this case.

-- and I'll deal with the
They allege that they

There were at

10

least three, and perhaps four notices that went out, and

11

the notice that they are putting their attention on is the

12

notice certifying --

13

QUESTION:

Well, are you saying that even though

14

the notice was improper, since they didn't see any notice

15

at all, they can't complain about it?

16

MR. WAXMAN:

Not at all.

We think that there

17

clearly are -- since actual notice isn't required, we

18

don't think that they lack standing to, on behalf of the

19

2.4 million people who were in the class --

20

QUESTION:

Mr. --

21

MR. WAXMAN:

-- to say that we have -- Mullane

22

requires that the content of the notice be adequate as

23

well as the --

24
25

QUESTION:

Actual notice isn't required when you

don't know the people.

It is required, best notice

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

practicable, in Mullane, when you knew the names, they

2

were identified beneficiaries -- Justice Jackson says

3

those people have got to get mail notice.

4

you don't know the error hasn't -- who the person is, that

5

the other is adequate.

6

served in Vietnam from '61 to '72, so you did know.

7

MR. WAXMAN:

It's only when

Here, there were records, who

Justice Ginsburg, this point, and

8

indeed most, if not all of the points that the respondents

9

are making in this collateral litigation, were made by my

10

clients in the direct proceedings before Judge Weinstein

11

and in the mandamus petition that went up to the Second

12

Circuit from his class certification decision.

13

We argued that there should be individual notice

14

to all veterans.

The Government represented, the

15

plaintiffs claimed, and both the trial court and the

16

Second Circuit expressly found --

17

QUESTION:

Mr. -- Mr. Waxman, that's --

18

MR. WAXMAN:

19

QUESTION:

-- that there was not such a list.

Mr. Waxman, that's well and good that

20

your clients, the defendants in this case did that, but

21

here we have a class of people, potential plaintiffs.

22

represented them?

23

than the judge, who has a global settlement, is there

24

any -- were any of the named representatives asym --

25

Who

Was there anyone in this case, other

MR. WAXMAN:

Asymptomatic?

34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Yes, were any of them?

2

MR. WAXMAN:

The named representatives were not

3

asymptomatic, and by design.

Judge Weinstein wanted to

4

put in front of the jury the strongest, most sympathetic

5

cases for causation, and there -- at the time of

6

settlement in this case, the symptomatic representatives

7

were completely representative of the views of all

8

veterans, because they had the following overwhelming

9

objectives:

defeat the Government contractor defense

10

which, as it turns out, was applied both by the district

11

court and by the court of appeals to grant judgment

12

against the people who actually opted out and pursued

13

their claims.

14

Secondly, to establish a defense to the

15

company's defense that the Government had misused it, that

16

the Government had prevented them from putting warnings

17

on, and to prove general causation, that is, to establish

18

proof by a preponderance --

19

QUESTION:

But when we get past that, Mr.

20

Waxman, adequacy of representation has to exist at all

21

stages of the litigation, and we're getting to the point

22

where there isn't going to be any trial.

23

be a settlement fund, and I suppose if I were representing

24

someone who was not going to be diseased until 1998, I

25

never would have consented to a settlement fund that will

There's going to

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

run dry in 1994.

2

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Ginsburg, the distinction

3

here, even at the distribution phase -- and remember, the

4

parties, the plaintiffs' representatives and the

5

plaintiffs' lawyers, recognizing the extreme weakness of

6

their legal claims, however great the pathos was, and

7

genuine anguish that they suffered, that their legal

8

claims were so weak they were willing to settle this case

9

and, on the assumption that Judge Weinstein and the

10

Special Master would allocate the formula, and the -- I

11

would say the proof in the pudding is that the named

12

representatives included six veterans.

13

of them were ever given cash benefits in this case, as

14

opposed to the general benefits that the class received

15

from the $70 million class --

16

QUESTION:

17

I believe only two

But they were symptomatic, all of

the --

18

MR. WAXMAN:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. WAXMAN:

They were all --

Okay.
-- they were all symptomatic, and

21

our submission here is that, as Judge Weinstein found and

22

the Second Circuit found, in response to precisely these

23

arguments, the pervasive, overwhelming, common weakness

24

that all of the plaintiffs had with respect to the legal

25

issues made the representation of asymptomatic veterans

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

representative.

This is --

QUESTION:

2

Okay, that's get -- all right, let's

3

assume for the sake of argument that gets you to the point

4

of -- of the settlement, 200, whatever it was, 200 million

5

is fine.

6

moment ago, in which they'd leave it to the judge to

7

decide how the 200 million is going to be split up, and

8

who's in effect going to be sub -- able to claim benefits

9

out of what.

Then we get to the point that you referred to a

10

At that point, I suppose it's fair to say that

11

the symptomatic class representatives are going to be in

12

favor of a division of that fund which gives most of the

13

money to the presently symptomatic veterans.

14

one at that point, that I can see, who was standing up for

15

the as yet asymptomatics and saying, wait a minute, you're

16

not setting aside enough money and leaving the money

17

available for a long enough period of time for us, so that

18

if you're right up to the point of settlement, why haven't

19

you got the problem once that point is reached?

20

MR. WAXMAN:

There was no

Justice Souter, I -- I do at some

21

point want to argue to the Court why we think that de novo

22

relitigation of adequacy is not appropriate on collateral

23

review, but even if it were, I believe I have a

24

satisfactory answer to your question.

25

First of all, the way that the distribution, the

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

allocation proceedings occurred, with hearings, multiple

2

hearings, multiple submissions not only by the class

3

representatives whose proposal was uniquely rejected by

4

Judge Weinstein, but by individual veterans, veterans

5

groups, actuaries, scientists --

6

QUESTION:

Individual veterans were heard, but

7

they weren't representatives, and the court wasn't a

8

representative.

9

MR. WAXMAN:

That, to be sure.

To be sure, but

10

they were -- the class -- first of all, and Shutts itself

11

stands for the proposition, Phillips Petroleum v. Shutts

12

stands for the proposition that the court and the parties

13

adverse to the class may supply the arguments and the

14

necessary sharpness in an adversary system to assure that

15

in the main the procedures followed were sufficiently

16

fundamentally fair, but here I think it's very important

17

not to character -- not to understand that in 1984 this

18

looked like the type of futures versus presents that

19

existed in Amchem and existed in Ortiz.

20

First --

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. WAXMAN:

Okay, why didn't it?

Why --

Okay, for several reasons.

First

23

of all, the -- this -- in those cases you had a situation

24

in which people who presently suffered from asbestosis and

25

mesothelioma and the other -- the other tragic

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

manifestations of asbestos exposure had valuable,

2

demonstrably valuable -- there was a matrix to figure out

3

how much they were entitled to, and the rest of the class,

4

which, unlike here, included -- in the asbestos context

5

included -- the entire civilized world who may or may not

6

have been exposed to asbestos, had claims worth nothing.

7

In this case the district court and the Second

8

Circuit found repeatedly that what united these people

9

was, none of them had a legal claim that was worth

10

anything under the way the law existed at the time, and we

11

think exists now.

12

Secondly, the distinction between futures and

13

presents was one of many, many, many different ways that

14

you could distinguish among the class.

15

one, we think, was between people who would recover

16

anything under the settlement and people who would recover

17

nothing under the settlement.

18

For example --

19

QUESTION:

The more salient

No, but I'm posing the question, as

20

at the point -- at the point at which the settlement

21

proceeds are being divided, as between those who will get

22

something and those who will get nothing, and so I'm

23

saying, why was there no distinction between them, for our

24

purposes, at that point?

25

MR. WAXMAN:

I think that there -- there --

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Judge Weinstein recognized, and several people who

2

appeared before him and provided testimony, written and

3

oral testimony in the fairness hearings, in the

4

distribution hearings, in the motion for reconsideration,

5

and written objections, and a motion to certify a class,

6

made him very aware that, and he himself was aware from

7

reading the literature, that the latency period for many

8

diseases is as long as 40 years, and there would be claims

9

that would come up long into the future that some people

10

would attribute to exposure to Agent Orange, and what he

11

did was, he said, I will -QUESTION:

12
13

Then why -- why was none of the money

held over for such late-blooming claims?
MR. WAXMAN:

14

Well, what Judge Weinstein found,

15

and what -- the Second Circuit on appeal insisted that the

16

settlement fund be entirely disposed of within the period.

17

What Judge Weinstein found was, we have to make provision

18

for all veterans who were exposed.

19

two ways, given the size of the class and the

20

indeterminacy of the law.

21

aside a certain pot of this money to provide cash

22

benefits.

23

insufficient as a matter of insurance, although more than

24

sufficient as a matter of proximate causation, since

25

nobody can demonstrate that.

I'm going to do it in

Number 1, I'm going to set

It will be insufficient.

It will be

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

I'm then going to take what turned out to be $70

2

million and use it for the benefit of the class as a

3

whole, for educational programs, for counseling programs,

4

for health programs, for the very kinds of programs that

5

produced the enactment of the Agent Orange legislation

6

that now provides, on a monthly basis, more money than

7

almost any veteran got, period, and also funded the

8

medical studies and scientific studies, or prompted

9

enactment of legislation that funded the studies that now

10

allow them to claim that there are -- that there is

11

greater evidence of an association.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. WAXMAN:

14
15

Mr. -As to the other -- as to the --

pardon me.
QUESTION:

Mr. Waxman, your time is drawing to a

16

close, and you've said a couple of times you think that

17

the standard on collateral review should be much different

18

than on direct review of a class action settlement.

19

you explain why that is, and what standard it would be?

20
21

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes, I could.

Could

May I say one

sentence in response to Justice O'Connor --

22

QUESTION:

Sure.

23

MR. WAXMAN:

24

With respect to the 75 percent of the fund that

25

went for compensation, Judge Weinstein understood and did

-- and I will.

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

reserve a very substantial portion of that for people who

2

manifested in the future, and the respondents in the case

3

were just like the respondents in Ivy/Hartman, which is,

4

they were asymptomatic.

5

were going to become ill and, if so, when, and what

6

Judge -- and many - - thousands of claims were paid of

7

people who manifested disease in the future, and what

8

Judge Weinstein said is, look, at some point, the time

9

passage is so great that it simply becomes almost

They didn't know whether they

10

impossible, as a matter of causation, to be able -- we all

11

get sick, and unfortunately we all die, and many of us get

12

diseases, and as time passes, he ruled, it becomes less

13

and less likely you could ever prove causation, and that's

14

why he drew the line that he did.

15

Mr. Chief Justice, our proposition with respect

16

to the standard of review is threefold.

First of all, it

17

should not be de novo redetermination of adequacy.

18

Second, because there was no showing of collusion or

19

fraud, which are recognized exceptions to the res judicata

20

effect of a judgment, and because the courts

21

Now, to know whether they're right or

How do I do that?

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Breyer, first of all the

10

Second Circuit did not do that.

decision.
MR. WAXMAN:

Both the Second Circuit in this

24

case and the Ninth Circuit in the Epstein case on which we

25

rely characterized Amchem as heralding a new era, or being

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

a watershed decision, and our submission only is that for

2

purposes of the new rules, doctrine that this Court

3

announced, for example, in Teague v. Lane and following

4

cases, the burden is on the party that seeks to invoke the

5

benefit of a later-decided case to prove that a

6

conscientious court prior to the announcement of the rule

7

would have been, quote, compelled to conclude that futures

8

could not be included in the class.

9

Now, as to the standard of review, this Court's

10

decision -- this Court even in Teague itself, which was a

11

criminal case, the Court said, to be sure, in civil cases

12

finality concerns are far, far more important, and in

13

cases like Brecht and Herrera, this Court has emphasized

14

over and over again, even when a defendant's life is at

15

stake, that on collateral review, in a subsequent review

16

of a final judgment, the showing has to be, quote,

17

necessarily far higher to obtain relief than on direct

18

review.

19

This Court's decisions in the -- in jurisdiction

20

cases, subject matter and personal jurisdiction cases,

21

where we're talking about the fundament of the power of

22

the original court to decide the case prove that, if

23

there -- in Stohl v. Gotlieb, this Court pointed out that

24

with respect to the first proceeding, even without any

25

express discussion of it, we have to assume, and we will

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

conclusively presume that the original court had subject

2

matter jurisdiction unless it would have been a, quote,

3

manifest abuse of authority to have done so, and with

4

respect to personal jurisdiction, Durfee v. Duke and Iowa

5

v. Baldwin and those other cases all stand for the

6

proposition that if the prior court, quote, has decided

7

the question of jurisdiction over the parties as a

8

contested issue there will be no reinquiry into personal

9

jurisdiction.
We're not even advocating that rule in our

10
11

second test.

We're just saying, it should be deferential.

QUESTION:

12

These were all parties who were

there.

14

people weren't there, so -- and in habeas, all the

15

criminal cases, of course the defendant was there.

are two people who say, we weren't there, and we didn't

have a chance to litigate it.

Now, the analogy I think that would be

23

appropriate here would be with reference to the -- the

default judgment cases, where you can say, you can't have

25

a default judgment on jurisdiction because no one appeared

47

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Second Circuit may have justified Federal jurisdiction

wouldn't fly.

We say that you don't have to personally

be there, but if you have notice, an opportunity to be

heard, a right to opt out, and adequate representation,

10

according to this Court in Shutts, then we will say that

11

you are deemed to have been there.
In this case, Mr. Stephenson had none of those,

12
13

and let me tell you why.

14

about the question of representation and the adequacy of

15

representation.

16

there were no representatives selected, not a

17

representative reviewed for anyone.

18

were chosen by the plaintiffs after the court was

19

certified, after the notice was decided on, and when the

20

notice was going out, so there was nobody there to

21

represent anyone at the time.

22

were never specifically approved by the court. They were

23

chosen by the plaintiff's counsel for the purposes of

trial.

25

Now, your clients became ill in 19, what, 98?

6

MR. SMOGER:

7

QUESTION:

1996 and 1998.

1996 and 1998.

How could the

8

defendant in this case, or how could the court in this

9

case have affected a settlement that would bind everybody?

10

I mean, how about people who perhaps get sick in 2018?
MR. SMOGER:

11

Well, let's say, if the goal is the

12

ability to have unexposed people, people that have

13

absolutely no disease, to somehow take care of them, even

14

in Amchem and Ortiz there were certain back-end opt-out

15

rights that were insufficient.

16

opt-out rights here, so one of the things the Court would

17

have to do is to give some kind of back-end opt-out

18

rights.

19

take care of information that came as a result of science.

20

It's an interesting phenomenon that most cancers

There also has to be some kind of insurance,

There are a lot of

Now, it sounds to me when you say all

those things that you're really saying, can't settle a
class action.

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

12

QUESTION:

At least not a mass tort action.

13

MR. SMOGER:

14

QUESTION:

You can settle --

Because the person who wants to

15

settle, you know, it's always open to any one of million

16

people in the action to come in later and say, now he

17

defines himself as a class in a way that wasn't

18

represented before, not too hard to do, and he says, you

19

should have had a lawyer for that group, and there's just

20

nothing anybody can do about it.

21
22

Now, that, if that's so, you can't settle a mass
tort class action, so --

23

MR. SMOGER:

but I want to get your response to that, because that's

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the kind of thing that's bothering me a lot.
MR. SMOGER:

2

Well, there's multiple questions

3

here.

One is, the advisory committee in 1966 basically

4

said it was inappropriate for mass torts.

5

trying to make -QUESTION:

6

Now, if you're

In other words, you say, that's okay.

7

That's not such -- I'm worried about it.

8

worry.

9

mass torts.

You say, don't

The advisory committee says you shouldn't settle
They all should go to trial and, fine -- I'm

10

a little hesitant about that, considering asbestos is

11

eating up about $200 billion without people really getting

12

compensated, but I mean, I'd say that that's a possible

13

answer, and you know more about it than I do, I should

14

think.
MR. SMOGER:

15

I would think that if there is a

16

question on how you can do it, at least you have to have

17

the fundamentals of having somebody represent those

18

individuals, and it's a person so that a lawyer can

19

advocate.

20

injury, at least you have an advocate for that individual,

21

and he's similarly situated, and asking for the same

22

relief as those people that were -- that he wants the

23

relief.

24
25

If you have an individual that doesn't have an

QUESTION:

Well, would it -- would it have been

sufficient to say, have one class representative be --

53
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

represent all those who were then asymptomatic that might

2

later get it, or would you have to break that down?

3

MR. SMOGER:

Somebody, if that person has

4

separate counsel advocating for them, then that's the

5

first thing they could do and look at it.

6

it -- there is a certain difficulty --

7

QUESTION:

I mean, is

And in this case, as you just heard --

8
9
10

MR. SMOGER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

-- and as you know, there are two

11

special things about it.

12

the reason it's not asbestos is because asbestos involves

13

future claimants whom I think most people would say have

14

been hurt by the asbestos, and here, there are future

15

claimants, at least one side says, have not been hurt by

16

Agent Orange.

17

of us will, of cancer, and they're understandably upset,

18

but it wasn't Agent Orange that did it.

19

One, this is not asbestos, and

They are dying naturally, like 22 percent

Now, that's what Judge Weinstein thought, and

20

that's why, I take it, he felt that here, unlike asbestos,

21

you don't need that lawyer, that special class.

22

Now, all I know is, that's -- this is the third

23

time that question has been raised and litigated.

The

24

first two times it was decided against you.

25

supposed to sit here, knowing virtually nothing about it,

Are we

54
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

and decide whether in this particular case that was right

2

or wrong?

How do we handle this case?

3

And that's why they're saying, well, what you

4

should do is give some weight to the fact that this was

5

already decided against you twice, although with different

6

clients.

7

I'm looking for an answer.

8

MR. SMOGER:

9

QUESTION:

I'm not --

Well --

I'm not trying to put an --

11

MR. SMOGER: I -QUESTION: -objectionable question. I'm trying to
find the answer to how we deal with this.
MR. SMOGER: I understand. You've given me a

12

number of questions, but first of all, the first question

13

was never decided against Mr. Stephenson.

14

never had an opportunity to say that he didn't get notice,

15

or proper notice, and it's clearly that he wouldn't have

16

said injured, and we've talked about before, the actual

17

notice that went out said it's limited to people who have

18

injuries, and then described it as injury, disease, death

19

or disability.

20

Mr. Stephenson would ever have thought he was in the class

21

that had the right to opt out.

10

22

Mr. Stephenson

There was no way that Mr. Isaac -- that

It's also true in this matter that the opt-out

23

period ended before the settlement took place, so there

24

was never an opportunity of these people, of the uninjured

25

to opt out of the class and have the rights that we give

55
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

them to have separate litigation.
As to the matter of the science, we can -- we

2
3

can speak to the, you know, speak to the science itself.

4

It has changed tremendously.

5

has written -- has written on this in a footnote -QUESTION: - - as of 1984, and what you're saying

6
7

is, it's changed.

Now, is that change relevant?

MR. SMOGER:

I understand that Your Honor

I think the change is absolutely

relevant, because the possibility of the -QUESTION:

10
11

12

continue.

I don't want to get you off the main

I was very interested in your basic answer, so

MR. SMOGER:

13

The change in the science has been

14

dramatic, and I'll just say very briefly that in 1984

15

these were not considered human carcinogens.

16

recognized as human carcinogens by the international

17

agency, the research on cancer by the EPA, and it's -- the

18

National Academy of Sciences, so our scientific

19

understanding is utterly changed because of the time it

20

takes to do those kinds of scientific types of proper

21

studies.

22

you initially go about having a settlement and thinking

23

about futures, and that's why you have to think about all

24

the rights.

25

would have all been, have been considered.

Now they're

That's what has to be taken into account when

If they had a separate advocate, those rights

QUESTION:

But, I guess these points were made

2

in prior litigation efforts, maybe not by Mr. Stephenson,

3

but these points were litigated, were they not?

4

MR. SMOGER:

5

QUESTION:

Certain of the --

Adequacy of representation, and

6

notice, and so forth?

7

MR. SMOGER:

The issue of adequacy, and the

8

issue of the fact that there was never any adequates

9

chosen does not appear in any decision, and that is one of

10

the questions.

11

have to rely?

12

that's chosen.

13

The question is, what does Mr. Stephenson
There's not a designation of an objector
We're -- we're here --

QUESTION:

Well, you're saying that at no time

14

in the previous reviews of this judgment was adequacy of

15

representation dealt with?

16

MR. SMOGER:

Adequacy was dealt with writ large,

17

and I'll separate -- there's two types of structural

18

adequacy versus prosecutorial adequacy, of how it's

19

prosecuted.

20

not in the terms that -- of the existence of any specific

21

representatives, and as I said, again there were none to

22

begin with.

23

The large part of adequacy was discussed, but

QUESTION:

But formally there had to be made

24

an -- you couldn't have a class action.

To certify the

25

class action there must be a finding of adequacy.

57
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

There

1

certainly was such a finding.

2

incorrect, because your clients were not represented by

3

anybody.

4

MR. SMOGER:

5

QUESTION:

You're saying that that was

Well --

To certify a class, you must find

6

that the representatives are adequately representing the

7

class.

8

MR. SMOGER:

Theoretically, Justice Ginsburg,

9

but in reality, Justice, Judge Pratt certified the class,

10

saying he'd find adequate representatives in the future,

11

and he would find them.

12

When Judge Weinstein certified the class, there

13

was still no representatives, and they were said that - - he

14

asked the plaintiffs' lawyers to find them.

15

certified without any single representatives.

16

QUESTION:

It was

I thought the adequacy was decided in

17

two separate instances, first directly, when -- I think it

18

was Ivy and somebody out of Texas brought the same kind of

19

claim that you have brought now, and correct me if I'm not

20

right, because I -- and they got to the Second Circuit and

21

the Second Circuit said no, you people were represented

22

adequately, and that was similar.

23

Then I thought the other time, which is not

24

directly adequacy, was at the time of the settlement

25

agreement some objectors came in, and they raised roughly

58
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the same kinds of points you're raising now, and there

2

Judge Weinstein said that the settlement was fair, and

3

then it went to the Second Circuit and they said it was

4

fair, despite the presence of that objection.

raise, and base your adequacy argument on.
So those are the two things that I thought were

That's not

relevant.

Now, am I right, basically, in that?
MR. SMOGER:

There were certain people, there

10

was one -- there was one objector in the record who was a

11

very informed objector, having been a law school classmate

12

of Mr. Waxman.

13

He did raise those personally.

There was also a lawyer that raised them who was

14

told that he didn't have any standing to raise them, and

15

there was a question.

16

describes the future, the issue of adequate --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. SMOGER:

There was no decision that

What about the Texas litigation?
The Texas litigation took place,

19

and the Second Circuit had an interesting finding there.

20

The Second Circuit said that since the people pre-1994

21

were getting the same compensation as the original, that

22

as to those people there wasn't any difference, because

23

they were eligible for the same compensation, so the

24

adequacy decision for the Second Circuit went to the fact

25

that the result, that the result was evenhanded between

Mr. Ivy that brought the case and the present

representatives.

QUESTION:

Is Ivy in the same position as

Stephenson?
MR. SMOGER:

No, because Ivy did -- was eligible

6

for money from the settlement funds.

The settlement funds

ran out in 1994.

8

a very specific holding on efficiency in -- in -- before.

9

Getting back to my other point on prosecutorial

That's why it's different.

So they had

10

adequacy, the defend -- the petitioners would ask every

11

class member to constantly monitor adequacy to make sure

12

that all class actions are adequately handled, when they

13

say you can't challenge the adequacy.

14

are two -- there's even a

15

it, in not having ever had any people to represent the

16

futures, after the settlement was finalized in 199 -- in

17

1988, there was a promise in -- in -- in the fairness

18

notice that there would still be an adjustment made if

19

there were future scientific findings.

20

began to look at that, because there was no representative

21

to look for that.

22

In this case there

-- there's -- in prosecution of

Nobody ever even

Also, there was a $10 million reserve fund which

23

the -- which the defendants demanded in case of state

24

court action, and they demanded that reserve fund, which

25

certainly anticipates that there would be further state

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

court actions, they demanded that reserve fund go through

2

the year 2008, that in the event of any state court

3

actions they would have money that they would get back,

4

and that was out of the $180 million.
In -- that -- Judge Weinstein had said that that

5
6

reserve fund would be stay -- would be held for futures

7

after 1994.

8

Dow's request was then given to the -- to the class

9

assistance program, so the reserve fund that was supposed

10

to be there to 2008, and had the capability of paying some

11

money for post 1994 claimants, was also depleted.

In 1994, that reserve fund at petitioner

That's -- I bring that up because that's the

12
13

question you had -- the question throughout the

14

proceedings, and as this Court said in Shutts, is -- that

15

adequacy has to be at all times.
QUESTION:

16

In this proceeding, what deference

17

should we give to the -- based on the proposition that

18

this is collateral attack and not direct review, and that

19

there have been previous adjudications on this issue?

20

What's the standard of -- of -- what showing must you

21

make, and what's the standard of review that the Court

22

applies?

let me say why.

class is certified.

For instance, in Amchem, the predominance

The question as to collateral review goes to due

5

process protections, and the protections are -- go to in

6

7

QUESTION:

It's very odd that abuse of

8

discretion is the standard on direct review, and on

9

collateral review you have a more generous standard.

10
11

That's very odd.
MR. SMOGER:

It's -- I don't find it -- I don't

12

think it's odd in the sense of what's being reviewed.

13

question that's being reviewed is whether Mr. Stephenson

14

was properly before the court.

15

properly before the court is reviewed de novo by the

16

second court because it's a jurisdictional question, so

17

the question, the limited question that's reviewed by the

18

second court is, in this situation we're saying, somebody

19

doesn't have to be personally before the court --

20

The

QUESTION:

14

It was, was Mr. Stephenson

Yes, yes, that's true, but that

15

question was decided before in respect to another person.

16

Now, in respect to that other person, if the Second

17

Circuit has decided it, if he really is in the same

18

position as Stephenson, is that first decision, does it

19

bear the weight of stare decisis?

He didn't have a chance to

Well, but in some cases the fact that

he wasn't there has not -- is not going to mean that he

10

can get de novo review, I would think, of the

11

determination that he's bound by the class settlement.

12
13
14

You're saying that when it comes to adequacy of
representation, it is de novo on collateral review?
MR. SMOGER:

On -- on notice, as -- as the Chief

15

Justice wrote in the Shutts decision, the minimum of due

16

proces is --

17
18
19

QUESTION:

But Shutts -- Shutts was not a

collateral review, I don't believe.
MR. SMOGER:

But the base -- my understanding is the

20

basis for this Court to review Shutts was that

21

Phillips stated that there was a potential of collateral

22

review, and that's what gave Phillips standing to be

23

before the Court, and in -- in that case the Court decided

24

the jurisdictional standard that would allow -- and it set

25

a minimal jurisdictional standard.

You don't -- Phillips

64
Alderson Reporting Company

had argued you personally have to be there, and this Court

2

said no, you don't.

there if you have notice and opportunity to be heard, and

4

opportunity to opt out, and adequacy of representation.

We'll -- we'll deem you to have been

And the adequacy of representation is very

5
6

important because we have to assume that the person

7

representing somebody had the same interests at heart as

8

the person who's never before the court.
QUESTION:

Suppose I agree with you on that.

One -- and suppose I agree with you so far.

MR. SMOGER:

Now, if that's the analogy, here, I would say --

MR. SMOGER:

Well, let me --

What do I do?
Let me raise two things, because

4

when the Second Circuit here said it, and Judge Cardamone

5

sat on both Ivy and this case.

6

said we never considered this before, and when he said we

7

never considered this before, it was that this person was

8

getting nothing, and their justification in Ivy, that

9

the -- that Ivy was still eligible for funds was no longer

10

applicable to Stephenson, who was eligible for nothing, so

11

that's one part of, of, of the equation.

He was on both cases and

The other part is that adequacy itself, once --

12
13

we go to what's litigated before.

15

before, and it was never -- the adequacy deficiencies that

16

occurred after the settlement were not before any court

before.

do you mean after the settlement figure was announced but

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

continued the inadequacy, even after the settlement. I

2

mean, it's a peculiar fact in this case in terms of the,

3

the actual settlement and the fairness hearing, the --

4

whether somebody had a reasonable right to object

5

when the fairness hearing gave no distribution at all, and

6

just basically dumped the money into the judge as parens

7

patriae and said, decide it however you want without

8

representation, the petitioner seems to think that's okay,

9

and I think that that would be a very difficult rule of

10

law to say that you can get around any due process

11

protections and any injustice just by putting money into

responsibilities in every case, because that absolves all
