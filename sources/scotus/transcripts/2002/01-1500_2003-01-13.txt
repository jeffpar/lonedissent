ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Paragraph 6 of section 2255 provides that,

12

quote, a 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a

13

motion under this section.

14

run from the latest of -- and it identifies four events,

15

the first of which is, quote, the date on which the

16

judgment of conviction became final.

17

The limitation period shall

Congress did not define or otherwise explicate

18

when the judgment becomes final in that provision, and the

19

question presented by this case is that, given that final

20

can mean many different things in different contexts, when

21

does it -- judgment become final here?

22

Petitioner agrees with the clear majority of

23

circuits and the United States that the judgment becomes

24

final upon the conclusion of direct review or the

25

expiration of time for seeking such review.

As applied to

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

this case, petitioner's time to seek 2255 relief began to

2

run when his time to seek certiorari in this Court

3

expired.
Congress most likely intended that

4
5

interpretation for two reasons.

6

this Court has consistently used in the most analogous

7

context, and that is the dividing line between direct and

8

collateral review; and, second -QUESTION:

9
10

First, it is the one that

Are you talking about now our

retroactivity cases?

11

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Not merely retro --

The -Those included, Mr. Chief

14

Justice, but also cases like Barefoot versus Estelle,

15

dealing with the presumption of correctness, and also Bell

16

versus Maryland, which addresses the question of when a

17

statute is repealed, when does that repeal affect --

18

what -- what convictions does it affect?
QUESTION:

19
20
21

Well, those come from quite diverse

contexts.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and that

22

is, in effect, our point.

23

contexts, however, do deal with the dividing line between

24

direct and collateral review.

25

Those -- most of those

The amicus quite rightly points out that there

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

are other meanings of final.

2

they don't -- they aren't as close as this one, and they

3

aren't the one that Congress most naturally looked to, and

4

since Congress didn't tell this Court what it meant, you

5

would look to the dividing line between direct and

6

collateral review, because that's the point of this

7

provision in section 2255.

8
9
10
11

We do believe, however, that

I mentioned there was a second reason that I'll
come to, and that is that the -- the minority rule doesn't
work textually and would produce anomalous results.
The -- as I mentioned, the Court has picked up

12

the notion of final -- the judgment of conviction becoming

13

final, and that language appears almost verbatim in

14

Linkletter, in contexts like Teague, Barefoot, and Bell.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Well, Link -- Linkletter was really a

bygone era by the time Congress passed AEDPA.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, but I think

18

the point still would favor us.

19

because although the Court has changed the line for

20

retroactivity and changed the test, it has never changed

21

the definition of what is final, and so for 40 years plus

22

the Court has consistently included the time to seek

23

certiorari, and that's a perfectly sensible result, as it

24

would be applied in this case.

25

You're absolutely right,

The -- the minority rule, by contrast, would

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

produce anomalous results.

2

that in the couple of months after the mandate issues in

3

the court of appeals, a judgment of conviction would be

4

both final and non-final at the same time, because you

5

wouldn't -- although the statute refers to the judgment of

6

conviction becoming final, you wouldn't actually know at

7

that point.

8
9

QUESTION:

It would mean, for example,

I thought that their -- amicus wrote,

you know, a pretty good argument on that side, and I

10

thought one of his better points, which is that if we're

11

looking at the -- the 1-year limitation from a person in

12

State proceedings, what it says is, it runs from the

13

latest of the date on which judgment became final by the

14

conclusion of direct review, or the expiration of time for

15

seeking such review; and then when you look to the

16

parallel for somebody in Federal proceedings, it says it

17

becomes final from the date on which the judgment of

18

conviction becomes final.

19

In other words, they use the first half of the

20

sentence, doesn't use the sentence -- the second; and in -

21

- in the State proceeding it has two, and here it has one,

22

and he says you have to give some meaning to that

23

difference.

24
25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I understand.

Justice Breyer,

that is exactly what has caused the Fourth and Seventh

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Circuits to scratch their head.

2

inference.

3

It's a conceivable

We don't dispute that.

Of course, the majority of courts have applied

4

another canon of construction here, and that is that when

5

Congress uses the same phrase in a statute, it's

6

interpreted generally, absent some strong contrary

7

indication, to have the same meaning.

8
9

QUESTION:

Oh, no, it doesn't, see, because you

have became final by the conclusion of direct review, and

10

then we have the date on which judgment of conviction

11

became final, and he's saying that he would interpret it

12

so they mean the same thing.

13

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Ah, but he wouldn't, and here's

14

the reason, and let -- let me just take you very carefully

15

through this, and for anyone who wants to look it up, it's

16

the blue brief on page 1 would be the different statutory

17

provisions.

18

2255 says, the limitation period shall run from

19

the latest of the date on which the judgment of conviction

20

became final.

21

date on which the mandate issues.

22

According to the amicus, that means the

2244(d)(1) says -- has the -- has that, and it

23

has some more, and that's your point.

The limitation

24

period shall run from the latest of the date on which the

25

judgment became final, and then he gives that -- that same

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

phrase, judgment became final, a different meaning in the

2

same statute.

3

Court, or the expiration of time to seek cert, so it

4

does -- it would have actually a -- that phrase, judgment

5

became final, would have a different meaning in 22 --

He reads that to mean either review in this

QUESTION:

6

Well, but the -- the -- that

7

doesn't -- the sentence doesn't end with judgment became

8

final.

9

review, or the expiration of the time for seeking such

10
11

It goes on to say, by the conclusion of direct

review.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That's right, so what we have,

12

Mr. Chief Justice, is 2244, Congress explicates a phrase.

13

2255, it doesn't explicate it at all, and our --

14

QUESTION:

So you are saying that in the --

15

within 2244(d)(1), those words are surplusage, they don't

16

do anything, that -- the -- that 2244 would mean the same

17

thing if there were a period after "became final."

18

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Ginsburg, it is correct

19

that we think it would mean the same thing even if it

20

weren't there, but it's not surplusage.

21

role, and so I have several reasons to articulate to the

22

Court why there's no negative pregnant -- our view is, and

23

this Court has said, not every silence is pregnant.

24

we have in 2255 is silent.

25

It does have a

My point, Justice Ginsburg, is that the

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

What

1

inference that the minority of courts draw, that Congress

2

was doing something special in 2244, and therefore

3

impliedly didn't intend to do the same thing in 2255, is

4

not correct, and I have several points.
The first one goes to yours, Justice Ginsburg,

5
6

and that is, it's reasonable for this Court to ask, okay,

7

why did it put it in 2244 and it didn't put it in 2255?

8

It would have been easier, obviously, if it had put it in

9

2255.

10

The reason we think they put it in 2244 is not

11

to specify which among the Federal interpretations of

12

"judgment becomes final" applies, but to say that it's the

13

Federal one, not the State one.

14

That's the real difference of force between 2244
2244 cases come out of the State courts,

15

instead of 2255.

16

and State courts define finality differently, and so what

17

Congress did there in 44 was make quite clear that they

18

were applying the Federal rule.

19

That was very important in particular, because

20

State proceedings have the added complication of not just

21

State direct review, but State post-conviction review, and

22

so Federal habeas courts could be terribly confused on

23

when the judgment and --

24
25

QUESTION:

But -- but you're going to get State

post-conviction review in connection with Federal habeas

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

cases because of the exhaustion requirement.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

2

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and that

3

is our point, and that is that Congress really needed to

4

do a better -- a very good job, as -- as good as they did

5

in AEDPA in any context, but they needed to do a good job

6

in telling Federal habeas cases in the 20 -- courts in the

7

2244 context when the judgment of conviction became final,

8

because if 20 -QUESTION:

9

Well, but you can also say that they

10

had to give a special meaning of finality so that we could

11

respect the processes of the States and make it clear that

12

the -- all of the State procedures had to be exhausted, as

13

the Chief Justice indicated, because of the intrusive

14

nature of -- of habeas jurisprudence, of habeas orders

15

from the Federal courts, and so you can read this as -- as

16

being an exception to this general Federal rule when, in

17

fact -- that brings me to another point -- you can address

18

both.
I -- I had -- I had thought, as the amicus brief

19
20

does indicate, that finality usually does mean from the

21

date of the issuance of the mandate, and then you go back

22

and you toll if there's -- if there's discretionary

23

review.

24
25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Kennedy, this is the

second point on the question of do -- does this Court have

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

some reason to believe that the presence in 24 -- excuse

2

me, 44 but not 55 creates a negative inference, the sort

3

of Russello presumption, and I agree with you that it

4

would rest on a view that this interpretation in 44(d)(1)

5

is unusual, and our point is that it's not unusual.
You are correct that the -- the -- as they said

6
7

in Melconian, for example, that the term of art, final

8

judgment, does generally mean the judgment of the district

9

court, but everyone agrees that that's not the

10

interpretation here.

In fact, it's very clear that the --

11

the phrase here, if I could again take you back to -- take

12

you back to it in 2255, is judgment of conviction becomes

13

final.

14

Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.

That phrase, judgment of conviction, picks up

15

Judgment of conviction includes the conviction,

16

the judgment of conviction and the sentence, and it is by

17

necessity already final and appealable.

18

were to say that the baseline rule is final judgment in

19

the sense of a district court, that would mean in the 2255

20

context that, although your -- your direct appeal could be

21

sitting here in the Seventh Circuit for 2 years, after the

22

first year, you need to be back in the district court on

23

2255, because the judgment of conviction would have become

24

final when it was entered by the district court, and no

25

one thinks that's sensible.

If this Court

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

In fact, the -- the notes to rule 5 of the -- of

2

the 2255 rules make quite clear you're not supposed to be

3

in on your 2255 until the direct review process is over,

4

so that -- my point was that the -- what you're describing

5

as the normal background rule of when a judgment of

6

conviction becomes final actually describes the term

7

"final judgment," which couldn't apply here.

8

QUESTION:

When you're -- when you're appealing

9

from the district court to the court of appeals, when does

10

the term, final -- what does the term of final mean there,

11

as to the district court judgment?

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

13

In this -- in -- in our view,

under 2255, Mr. Chief Justice, or --

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It -- it does not become final,

16

in our view.

17

would -- the judgment of conviction would become final

18

after the 10 days --

19

What happens is, if you did not appeal, it

QUESTION:

Well, characterize for -- for us,

20

then, your understanding of the amicus view.

21

their view is that it just becomes tolled.

22

you -- the minute you file the appeal it becomes tolled,

23

so there's no problem.

24
25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I thought

The minute

Well, Mr. -- Justice Kennedy,

I do agree with you that that's the amicus's view.

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Our

1

point is that it doesn't pick up what you're describing as

2

the normal rule of final judgment.

3

normal process.

Our point is that the most --

QUESTION:

4

That wouldn't be the

Oh, I should think the normal rule

5

does include the tolling exception that I -- that I --

6

we've just explained.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

7

Justice Kennedy, as a matter

8

of -- for example, Melconian, if we go back to what this

9

Court has described as the normal background

10

understanding, the normal background understanding is that

11

just when it's entered by the district court; but if,

12

again if I could come back to my basic point, and that is,

13

we all agree final can mean a lot of things, and the

14

closest one, it seems perfectly clear, is the one that

15

divides direct and collateral review, because that's what

16

this provision does.
I won't deny to you, Justice Kennedy, that it

17
18

could mean different things.

But no one -- and my third

19

point I wanted to make, Justice Ginsburg, about why you

20

shouldn't draw negative inferences, nobody's got a good

21

reason.

22

would have wanted this time to be available to State

23

prisoners, but not to Federal prisoners.

Nobody's got a reason to think that Congress

24

If I could reserve the balance of my time.

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4
5
6

MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
When a defendant does not petition this Court

7

for certiorari on direct appeal, his judgment of

8

conviction becomes final within the meaning of section

9

2255 when the time for filing a petition expires.

That

10

interpretation accords with the well-settled meaning of

11

final and the law of collateral review, and it sensibly

12

provides Federal prisoners the same time to prepare

13

collateral attacks as similarly situated State prisoners.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

What about an appeal from the

district court to the court of appeals?
MR. ROBERTS:

The judgment would become final if

17

there -- if no appeal was filed at the time -- when the

18

time to file an appeal expired after the 10-day period.

19

QUESTION:

And yet that's contrary to a lot of

20

other things, is it not?

21

district court 60 days after your time -- after the

22

district final judgment was entered and still maybe have

23

30 more days to appeal, and the district court isn't going

24

to do anything.

25

MR. ROBERTS:

I mean, you can't go into the

Well, we're talking about finality

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

for -- for a different purpose here.

2

of finality for the purpose of seeking appeal, or when a

3

judgment -- in the term like final judgment, which is --

4

which would be the sense of finality when, for the

5

purposes of deciding --

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. ROBERTS:

It's not a question

Why -- why should those be different?
Well, in -- in terms of -- of

8

collateral review, first of all the Congress used the

9

particular phrase, when the judgment becomes final, that

10

has an established meaning in that context.

11

all, it's logical that the time to commence collateral

12

review should start to run at the conclusion of direct

13

review, which this Court has made clear includes the

14

period when -- within which to seek certiorari even if a

15

petition isn't filed, and that's, in fact, what Congress

16

concluded in section 2244, the parallel provision for

17

State prisoners, and there's no persuasive reason why

18

Congress would have started the -- the time limitation at

19

a different time for Federal prisoners.

20

QUESTION:

21

the two sections differently.

22

something of a reason.

23

MR. ROBERTS:

Second of

Except that -- except that they wrote
That -- that certainly is

Well, that -- that -- well, I'm

24

talking about a -- a reason why they would have intended

25

that result as opposed to a -- a canon or a textual

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

indication that there might be a difference, but even as

2

to the textual indication --

3

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I thought they would

4

intend it in order to show special respect for the

5

processes of the State, so that a State has completely

6

exhausted all of its procedures for determining what the

7

law ought to be --

8

MR. ROBERTS:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

But --

-- before they're disrupted by a

Federal judgment.
MR. ROBERTS:

But this doesn't concern the

12

processes of the State, Your Honor, it concerns review

13

in -- in this Court, and this Court's made clear the --

14

the distinction of the time is between whether the -- the

15

time to seek review in this Court is included or is not

16

included, and that's not a -- a State -- a remedy, this

17

Court's made clear that exhaustion of State remedies

18

doesn't require a petitioner to seek review in this Court,

19

that State remedies are exhausted as long as all avenues

20

of review are pursued in -- in the State court system.

21

concerns about -- concerns about requiring them to go

22

through the full State court system wouldn't justify the

23

difference in the rule, nor would generalized concerns

24

about comity, which would suggest that State prisoners

25

ought to have less time to seek review from their

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

So

1

convictions, if -- if anything, to upset their State court

2

convictions, rather than -- than more time.
And really, collateral review rules are driven

3
4

more by finality concerns, which are equally strong in the

5

Federal context and the State context.

6

Teague retroactivity rules and rules of procedural default

7

apply equally to both, and because finality concerns are

8

the same, there -- there isn't any persuasive reason why

9

Congress would have started the time limit at a different

10

That's why the

time.

11

The negative -- the negative inference points,

12

to address the negative inference point, there are three

13

reasons why it would be inappropriate to draw a negative

14

inference from the omission of the clarifying language

15

here.

16

used final in accordance with its settled meaning in the

17

collateral review context, which petitioner discussed

18

earlier.

First, it contradicts the presumption that Congress

QUESTION:

19

But I -- I think, Mr. Roberts, that

20

as I pointed out in the question to petitioner's counsel,

21

2250 -- 44(d)(1) doesn't just stop with the word, final,

22

it goes on to kind of explicate the possible -- possible

23

meanings.

24
25

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, it explicates the meanings,

but it explicates the meanings by providing the definition

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that is the -- is -- by providing an explication that's

2

consistent with the background definition that you would

3

expect final to have, and there's a -- there are good

4

reasons why Congress would have -- might have wanted to

5

explicate the -- to explicate it more carefully in 2244.
Petitioner discussed one, which is that 2244

6
7

concerned State prisoners, and Congress might have been

8

concerned that, absent clarification, courts might import

9

the definition of finality used by the State of

10

conviction, and there are varying definitions there.

11

There's not the uniform definition that would include

12

review in this Court.
Second, it's possible that Congress might have

13
14

been concerned that the courts would assume that the time

15

limit in section 2244 starts to run the same time as the

16

time limit in section 2263, which also concerns State

17

prisoners, State capital defendants and States subject to

18

expedited collateral review proceedings, and so

19

Congress --

20

QUESTION:

Do you --

21

MR. ROBERTS:

22

QUESTION:

-- may have spelled it out here.

Do you think it makes any difference

23

that in 2255 Congress used the phrase, judgment of

24

conviction, and in 2244(d)(1) it simply used the word,

25

judgment?

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ROBERTS:

2

makes a difference.

3

language like that.

4

QUESTION:

5
6

No, I -- I don't think that it

There are variations in -- in

Well, usually variations in language

mean variations in meaning.
MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, Your Honor, but it's

7

referring back to the judgment of the State court under

8

which the person is in custody.

9

2244(d)(1) is reproduced in the gray brief on page 2 to 3.

10

The -- the provision

So where it says the date on which the judgment

11

became final, it's -- it's referring back to a -- a person

12

who's in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State

13

court, and that would be the judgment of the district

14

court -- I mean, of the trial court in -- in that

15

situation, but fundamentally, our points are two.

16

One, there's a background rule, and the

17

presumption is generally of -- of what -- when a judgment

18

becomes final in the collateral review context, and it's

19

generally presumed, with good reason, that Congress

20

legislates against that background rule and uses the terms

21

with their settled meaning in that context; and second, we

22

know Congress did that with respect to State prisoners in

23

section 2244 because they clarified it there; and it makes

24

sense that the time limitation should run at the same

25

time, because there's no persuasive reason for them to run

19
Alderson Reporting Company

at a different time.
QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, refresh my recollection.

3

Was 2255 and 22 -- and 2240(d)(1) enacted as part of the

4

same statute?

5

MR. ROBERTS:

They were enacted as part of

6

the -- the same statute, Your Honor, but the -- the

7

proposition that the same word has the same meaning, the

8

same word becomes final, has the same meaning throughout

9

the statute -- same statute would apply by virtue of that.

10

So the -- so that we would expect that when Congress said,

11

becomes final in section 22 -- 2255, and when it said,

12

became final in 2244, both referring to a judgment of the

13

trial court convicting the defendant, that it -- it

14

intended those phrases to have the same meaning.

15

QUESTION:

I wouldn't think that.

I would -- I

16

would think that where you say, on the one hand, where it

17

becomes final by (a) or (b), and elsewhere you simply say,

18

where it becomes final --

19

MR. ROBERTS:

20

QUESTION:

Right.

-- I would think that the latter

21

means, even if it becomes final in some other fashion.

22

Now, that happens not -- that happens not to

23

help the respondent here.

24

MR. ROBERTS:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

But I -- but I do think that that's

QUESTION:

MR. ROBERTS:

9

Well, that -- that would be one

-- but it was broader.

That's right, broader.
Yes, but it's hard for me to

conceive, frankly, what the broader --

10

QUESTION:

What the broader would be.

11

MR. ROBERTS:

-- understanding of finality is,

12

Your Honor.

I do think that -- that not every time

13

that -- that Congress uses the different language to --

14

that's more amplified and clarifying, does that -- that

15

mean that --

16

QUESTION:

Not necessarily.

17

MR. ROBERTS:

-- that the words -- and the Court

18

does not generally -- does not generally apply the

19

negative inference, the Russello presumption to draw the

20

conclusion that the -- that identical phrases have -- have

21

different meaning.

22

QUESTION:

Oh, if -- if you applied the Russello

23

presumption here, you -- you would be applying the

24

presumption that I just described, namely in -- in one

25

section, it limited it, in -- in the other section, it

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

didn't limit it at all.

You'd think the latter section

2

would be broader, not narrower.

3

MR. ROBERTS:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. ROBERTS:

That -- that would be --

That's -- that's what Russello said.
That would be parallel to Russello

6

and parallel to some other cases where there's been

7

additional limiting language, and the Court has said

8

therefore, the -- we won't read that limit into the

9

earlier language, but in those cases also what bears note

10

is that the word that was limited later on, here the word

11

becomes -- the phrase becomes final, was by the Court, in

12

those cases, given its ordinary meaning, what you would

13

expect, apart from the Russello presumption.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. ROBERTS:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Yes, but what I -And here --

That gets you into the argument of

whether there is an ordinary meaning of final.
MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor, and there

19

isn't -- there isn't an ordinary meaning across the board

20

in every context, but here we have a -- a narrow context

21

in which Congress has acted in the collateral review

22

context, in particular in the commencement of collateral

23

review, and in this Court's cases, in the collateral

24

review context, particularly delineating when direct

25

review ends and collateral review begins, the Court has

22
Alderson Reporting Company

1

used repeatedly, over 30 years before enactment of AEDPA,

2

the -- this established definition of finality, and

3

there's -- there's no reason why Congress would have

4

departed from that here.
If there are no further questions, we would

5
6

submit.

QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Roberts.

8

Mr. de Bruin, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. DE BRUIN,

10

AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW
MR. DE BRUIN:

11
12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There are four points that are dispositive of

13
14

this case.

First, the most natural and logical inference

15

is that the textual language in section 2255 cannot mean

16

exactly the same thing as the very different textual

17

language enacted at the same time in the same statute in

18

section 2244.

19

ordinary and accepted meaning that is not, in fact, the

20

same.

21

Congress logically used a different trigger for the

22

limitation periods in section 2244 and 2255, and fourth,

23

no harmful or absurd consequences flow from a

24

determination that Congress did not intend these very

25

different provisions with their very different texts to

Second, the text of each provision has an

Third, there are at least three reasons why

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

mean precisely the same thing, as the parties here

2

contend, and for these reasons, I submit the judgment of

3

the court of appeals in this case is correct, and it

4

should be affirmed.

5

The Russello presumption in this case is

6

particularly strong.

Congress, in fact, used three

7

different formulations in AEDPA in identifying triggers

8

for time limitations under the statute, 2244, 2255, as

9

we've talked about, and also 2263.

In each of those

10

formulations, enacted in the same statute at the same

11

time, Congress explicitly chose different words to

12

describe what the triggering event was and what the

13

consequences of subsequent events were.

14

QUESTION:

Let's -- let's review the Russello

Russello had an earlier section where the

15

presumption.

16

more general word was limited.

17

what was the -- the -- what was the general word involved

18

in that case?

19

MR. DE BRUIN:

What -- what was the --

I believe -- I have the exact

20

language, that in Russello, the -- the general was any

21

interest acquired.

22

QUESTION:

Any -- any interest acquired.

That's

23

what the later provision said, and the earlier provision

24

said, any interest in the enterprise acquired.

25

MR. DE BRUIN:

Correct, any interest in any

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

enterprise which the defendant has established.
QUESTION:

2

Okay, and -- and what Russello said

3

is, where you have a limitation in the earlier one, an

4

interest in any enterprise, and then the later one just

5

says, any interest, we assume that any interest is

6

broader.

7

It's not limited by, in any enterprise.
Now, if you apply -- and I think that's entirely

8

reasonable, but if you apply that same principle here,

9

what it comes to is that where in the early one it says

10

final by reason of (a) and (b), and in the later one, it

11

just says, becomes final, you would think the later one

12

would -- would include (a), (b), and maybe (c), (d), (e),

13

but it certainly wouldn't be narrower than the earlier

14

one, which is what you're insisting it is.

15
16
17

In other words, it seems to me Russello cuts
exactly against your position, rather than for it.
MR. DE BRUIN:

Well, I think the -- the meaning

18

of becomes final in 2255 is, in a sense, broader, in that

19

there are different conditions that can trigger when a

20

judgment becomes final.

21

judgments of courts become final when the court acts, not

22

upon the expiration of review.

23

may be disrupted, or arrested by subsequent filings.

24
25

QUESTION:

The -- the normal rule is that

That finality, however,

But aren't you picking one of the two

means of finality that's set forth in the earlier

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

provision?

2

means one of those two.

3

That's the opposite of Russello.

4

MR. DE BRUIN:

5

QUESTION:

6
7

You're saying in the later provision it only
That's not Russello at all.

No --

I -- I think what you'd have to say

is, it means those two perhaps plus some others.
MR. DE BRUIN:

No, for two reasons.

One,

8

Congress logically can include the first phrase, the

9

conclusion of direct review, as a means of clarifying and

10

contrasting its inclusion of the second or the expiration

11

of the time for seeking such review.

12

That is the unusual clause.

Typically,

13

judgments become final when the court acts.

They're not

14

dependent upon the expiration of the time for review for

15

finality to attach.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. DE BRUIN:

Or on the issuance of a mandate.
But that is an action of the

18

court, Justice Ginsburg.

19

and the parties agree that the word final does have

20

different meanings in different contexts.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. DE BRUIN:

In other words, the point is,

It surely does.
And -- and I don't dispute that,

23

but in this case, I think you have to look at final, and

24

it is guided by two things.

25

is informed by the language in 2244, where Congress

The meaning of final in 2255

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

provided a very specific definition there that it did not

2

employ in 2255.

3

QUESTION:

You seem to take only one part of the

4

definition, because 2244 says, on direct review, or the

5

expiration, but you seem to accept that 2255 does

6

encompass direct review.

7

files a petition for cert, then the finality rule would

8

not kick in.

9

MR. DE BRUIN:

That is, if someone actually

Justice Ginsburg, that is not

10

actually clear.

11

intended either formulation to be the defining point in

12

all cases.

13

that triggered a time bar to -- to when the judgment

14

became final and, as interpreted by the courts there,

15

finality was not always coextensive with the conclusion of

16

direct review.

17

It is not clear that Congress in 2255

Under Rule 33, there was very similar language

The rule there, universally established, was

18

that if a court of appeals issued its mandate and a stay

19

of the mandate was not obtained, the 2-year clock under

20

Rule 33 began to run from the date of the mandate whether

21

or not the defendant, not having obtained a stay,

22

petitioned this Court for certiorari.

23

question is not presented in this case, it is not

24

automatically clear that Congress in 2255 meant either of

25

the triggers that appear in 2244, but, as this Court

So although the

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

recognized in Russello, these provisions do not need to be

2

mutually coextensive.

One can be a subset of the other.

In this instance, Congress could include the

3
4

words, the conclusion of direct review, simply to provide

5

clarity that it also wanted to include the unusual event,

6

which was the expiration of the time for seeking such

7

review.

8
9

QUESTION:

You would also -- what -- they --

they also -- the Government gave meaning to the -- gave

10

meaning to the difference by saying, even if you're right

11

about that, becomes final, becomes final includes

12

expiration of time.

13

That's their argument.

And as to the first thing, by direct review,

14

that includes expiration of time, too.

15

in to make sure it was not the habeas route in the States,

16

and then they put the second clause in really to save

17

Federal judges from being confused about what happens in

18

the California Court of Appeals, what happens in the lower

19

inter -- intermediate State courts to make sure that --

20

that this ordinary Federal situation was seen as applying

21

to cases as they wend their way up through the State court

22

system, too.

23

MR. DE BRUIN:

24

QUESTION:

25

They just put it

What is --

I think that's -- that was -- I heard

that being given, in any case.

Are you following?

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Was I

1

clear enough?

2

MR. DE BRUIN:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. DE BRUIN:

Yes, I believe.

Yes.
But what is significant, Justice

5

Breyer, is that that argument essentially undercuts their

6

argument that Congress, in enacting 2255, was using an

7

established meaning of final, coming from this Court's

8

precedents in their retroactivity cases.
If Congress believed that the word final, as

9
10

used in 2255, standing alone, without clarification,

11

automatically conveyed the definition this Court has used

12

in the retroactivity cases, that definition, as this Court

13

knows, applies equally to State convictions as well as to

14

Federal convictions.

15

originally developed in the context of review of a State

16

conviction.

17

concept of finality both to a State conviction and to a

18

Federal conviction, so if Congress thought by using just

19

the word final, we mean, in essence, the retroactivity

20

definition --

In fact, that rule in Linkletter was

In Griffith, the Court applied that same

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. DE BRUIN:

23
24
25

If you -- if you --- that would have applied to

both.
But conversely, if Congress was aware that that
word, final, might mean something different, then the

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

obvious differences in wording here make a meaningful

2

difference.

3

2244 means what Congress specified.

The point is, there is no greater reason to

4

believe that the Court's definition in the retroactivity

5

cases applies in 2255 but not 2244.

6

QUESTION:

Right.

If -- if, in fact, you could

7

read it, as Justice Scalia suggested, which I think maybe

8

you could, or as the way the SG suggested for the sake of

9

argument, is there any argument that you shouldn't?

10

I mean, it sounds simple, clear, uniform; everybody'd

11

understand it.

12

way if the language permits it?

13

Is there any reason not to read it that

MR. DE BRUIN:

I think what you have done is,

14

you've rendered the words of section 2244, as Justice

15

Ginsburg pointed out, wholly superfluous.

16

QUESTION:

All right, but then you're answering

17

my question, no.

You're saying, there is no reason not to

18

read it that way if you could, with the language, but the

19

language doesn't permit it.

20

MR. DE BRUIN:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. DE BRUIN:

23
24
25

I --

That's your argument.
I believe that's correct.

I

believe -QUESTION:

And I take it as a no, that if it did

permit it, there isn't any good reason.

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. DE BRUIN:

I think Congress certainly could

2

have enacted a statute that had the same trigger.

3

there also are significant reasons why it made sense for

4

Congress not to use the same trigger.
QUESTION:

5

I think

There are --

It wouldn't render that language

6

superfluous if you interpreted it the way I suggested,

7

which is that -- that finality in the second provision

8

includes not just the two specifications in the first, but

9

also some other unnamed aspects of finality, which we

10

don't have to decide upon in this case, but which doesn't

11

help your case.

12

QUESTION:

Well, I mean --

13

MR. DE BRUIN:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. DE BRUIN:

Justice Scalia, what --

Go ahead.
What I think defeats that is that

16

there isn't anything else.

17

that --

18

QUESTION:

There isn't a broader universe

If -- if you're -- if you're going to

19

say that 2255, by contrast with 2244(d)(1) must mean

20

something broader, then -- though, the broader you define

21

finality, the more difficult it is for a petitioner to

22

make his case, it seems to me -- a habeas petitioner.

23

there are any number of different ways that a judgment can

24

become final, that -- that is bad for the person seeking

25

habeas relief.

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

If

1

MR. DE BRUIN:

I think that's right.

As,

2

Mr. Chief Justice, you recognized, the habeas -- there --

3

there's an interest in setting the date and in a non-

4

capital case, as these cases will be, where certiorari has

5

not been sought, if claims are to be brought, have the

6

statute begin, the claims be filed, if relief is

7

appropriate, relief be granted; but what I think is

8

significant, Justice Scalia, is that there is no broader

9

meaning of final that anyone has ever articulated.
The -- the broadest definition that has been

10
11

identified is that which is set forth in 2244, the

12

conclusion of direct review, or, what is not normally

13

included for finality, the expiration of the time for

14

seeking the conclusion of direct review, as opposed --

15

QUESTION:

But that makes sense --

16

QUESTION:

I suppose you could answer Justice

17

Scalia by saying that these are exceptions to the ordinary

18

rule of finality, although the statute doesn't quite read

19

that way.

20

extensions --

They're -- they -- or they are special

21

MR. DE BRUIN:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. DE BRUIN:

They --

-- of the ordinary rule of finality.
I -- I -- they're extensions, is

24

exactly right, but I think it is clear that finality

25

normally occurs when a court acts.

Here, when the court

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

of appeals issued its mandate, nothing else happened in

2

the case.

Mr. Clay did not -QUESTION:

3

Mr. de Bruin, I'd like to take you

4

back to that word, mandate, because finality means

5

different things in different contexts.

7

itself from the case, and then the case is lodged on

point.

The most basic

It's final for, say, preclusion purposes at that

This Court dates from, not from the mandate in

11

the court of appeals, but take, for example, our rule on

court of appeals, not from the later time when a mandate

14

is issued?

Doesn't it run from the entry of judgment in the

15

MR. DE BRUIN:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

So where do you make up the mandate

17

rule as a general rule?

18

MR. DE BRUIN:

Well, two points.

One, I believe

19

2244 makes clear that whatever 2255 means, it can't mean

20

exactly the same thing as 2244, because Congress didn't

21

use those words.

22

what, then, does becomes final mean in 2255?

23

when the court of appeals issues its judgment?

24

mean when it issues its mandate?

25

need to be answered.

That still leaves the question, well,
Does it mean
Does it

QUESTION:

Am I right that our rules don't refer

2

to the mandate date at all, that it's always the entry of

3

judgment?
MR. DE BRUIN:

4

That is correct.

The 90-day

5

clock runs from the -- from the entry of judgment, not the

6

mandate, but in deciding that question, what did Congress

7

mean by final, assuming it's not what it said in 2244.

8

Because it didn't say that here, the Court has to decide,

9

is it the judgment, is it the mandate, and there is, in

10

fact, a developed body of law under, I submit, a very

11

analogous situation.

12

2 years from final judgment to bring a claim, and the

13

courts had interpreted finality in that context to mean

14

when the court of appeals issued its mandate.
QUESTION:

15

Under Rule 33, the defendant had

I think your case would be persuasive

16

if, indeed, there was a generally understood meaning of

17

finality, and -- and that's the part of your brief I

focused on, and I just don't think you carry the day.

depends.
For example, if you say, from the day of entry

3

of judgment in one section of the statute, and in another

4

section of the statute it reads, from the day judgment was

5

entered, do you really think you have to give different

6

meaning to those two formulations?

7

depends on what -- what the other factors involved are,

8

and here --

MR. DE BRUIN:
QUESTION:

Of course not.

It all

I think --

-- I don't see any other factor,

11

unless you show that finality has a normal meaning,

12

which -- so that the earlier provision is giving it some

13

peculiar meaning.

That -- that would be persuasive --

MR. DE BRUIN:

I agree with you that Russello

sets a presumption, it's not an automatic rule, but what

different words.

2

they would not have diverged so significantly."

QUESTION:

But you admit that for one part of

4

that clause, Congress didn't mean any different.

5

if there is a petition filed, if there is, in fact, a cert

6

petition filed, then State and Federal prisoners got

7

treated alike, so it's the -- the only place, as I

8

understand it, where you're saying there's a difference is

9

whether the time for filing a petition counts even when

11

The --

the -- there -- no petition is filed.
MR. DE BRUIN:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I don't

12

concede that.

13

14

arrested so that automatically the conclusion of direct

15

review isn't counted.

16

because there was no petition, it may be Congress did not

17

mean for either of those clauses to be in all cases the

18

determinative fact under 2255.

19

I don't concede that it is true that if a

QUESTION:

That's not really presented here

So under your reading, it might be

that the judgment becomes final, the court of appeals

judgment becomes final when the mandate comes down, even

though the petitioner has filed a cert petition.

24
25

MR. DE BRUIN:

It could

It could mean that, and that was,

in fact, the established rule under Rule 33, which is a

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

very similar time mechanism, and I submit the most

2

appropriate context is, look at other congressional

3

enactments imposing time limits on the bringing of claims

4

after judgment, and the rule under Rule 33 was cert was

5

irrelevant unless a stay of the mandate was obtained under

6

Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41; and, of course,

7

under 41(c) you can obtain a stay of the mandate if a

8

substantial question exists for the presentation of a

9

petition for certiorari.
QUESTION:

10

Am I wrong in thinking that the

11

general understanding is that when you file a cert

12

petition, that the finality is suspended until that

13

petition is disposed of?
MR. DE BRUIN:

14

I don't believe that is a general

The most analogous rule, as it existed both under

the Speedy Trial Act and under Rule 33, was that simply

that rule that the simple filing of a petition, that's

Alderson Reporting Company

1

It makes sense, I submit, not to have a rule

2

that the automatic filing arrests the finality of the

3

judgment, and that was, in fact, the rule under Rule 33,

4

and that's the way the Speedy Trial Act has been

5

interpreted, and other statutes of limitations, that the

6

filing for cert does not automatically trigger the -- or

7

disrupt the statute.
QUESTION:

8
9

Mr. de Bruin, I think I understand

your argument based on the different wording, but --

10

I think this question was asked before, too:

11

reason why Congress might want to give Federal

12

post-conviction petitioners less time than State

13

post-conviction petitioners?
MR. DE BRUIN:

14

is there any

Yes, but first I must correct

Under this overall statutory scheme, I submit

15

you.

16

Federal prisoners have more time, not less, and the reason

17

for that, it is wrong for the parties to argue, as they

18

do, that this construction of 2255 is necessary to ensure

19

parity.

20

There is no parity.
As the Court knows from its decision in Duncan

21

versus Walker, and just last term in Carey versus Saffold,

22

the 1-year statute under 2244 applies to the preparation

23

of two different things.

24

your State collateral petition, and then once that is

25

filed, but only after it's filed, there is tolling, as was

It applies to the preparation of

1

at issue in Duncan versus Walker and Carey versus Saffold;

2

and then after the State petition is resolved, but not

3

including certiorari, that's very clear, then you've got

4

to file your Federal 2254 petition.

5

one year to do both, prepare his State collateral claim,

6

assuming total exhaustion under Rose versus Lundy, and

7

then, after the State collateral petition is resolved, the

8

Federal collateral petition.

9

So a State inmate has

The Federal inmate, by contrast, has a full year

10

simply to bring his 2255 motion.

11

only by forcing this different language in 2244 and 2255

12

to mean the same thing, will you achieve parity.

13

isn't parity.

14

are, in any event, reasons for that difference.

15

So it is not true that

Federal inmates have more time.

There

But there

Again, claims coming from State court by

16

definition must be exhausted, previously litigated claims.

17

By definition, 2255 claims cannot be the same claims that

18

were litigated on direct review.

19

logical sense for Congress to allow the State claim,

20

previously litigated in State court, to run its full

21

course at least through cert on direct review before

22

starting the statute.

23

I submit it makes

If this -- and I submit Teague here really

24

provides a reason.

Since this Court has recognized that

if it were to issue a new rule of constitutional procedure

Alderson Reporting Company

1

before the time expired to file for cert, and if one of

2

the petitioner's State claims was litigated on direct

3

review, it is less an affront to the State system for this

4

Court to simply grant, vacate, and remand than for a lower

5

Federal court to take up that claim on habeas.

6

Congress logically could have said that the time to begin

7

the statute will not run until the expiration of time for

8

the conclusion of direct review.

9

as that that could provide an explanation for why Congress

There are reasons such

triggers in these two statutes.

5

of appeals said.

I thought -- you -- you said that's
but I don't think that that's what the court

MR. DE BRUIN:

6

You are correct, Justice

7

Ginsburg.

The courts of appeals have held universally

8

that if you petition for cert, the 1-year period does not

9

begin to run until the petition is resolved, and that rule

10

is not presented here.

There is, in fact -- authority

11

goes both ways, that subsequent filings in a different

12

court at times do arrest the finality of a prior judgment,

13

and at times they do not.

14

My only point was, in looking at the language of

15

2244 and asking whether the language there, the conclusion

16

of direct review defeats the Russello presumption, my

17

point simply is, it does not defeat it.

18

interpretation is that Congress didn't mean either to

19

apply here, and instead embraced a rule much like the

20

established practice under Rule 33, but even if -- the

21

Court does not need to accept that to affirm the court of

22

appeals here.

23

One

The rule logically could be that if the court of

24

appeals issues its mandate, the case is over in the court

25

of appeals.

Nothing else happens, no motion to stay, no

7

No, but -- I'm sorry, but

You have a year.

If, however, you petition for cert, then the

24

MR. DE BRUIN:

It's not tolling.

25

has provided tolling under 2263.

Now, Congress

It has provided tolling

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

under different aspects of the statute.

But no, this is

2

not tolling.

3

judgment is final, but yet, if you file a motion for

4

reconsideration, for instance, the finality of the

5

judgment, even though it was final and the time bars were

6

running, finality is arrested; and then once the petition

7

for reconsideration is decided, you have a full period,

8

again, and so Justice Ginsburg, that would be a perfectly

9

permissible construction, and in fact, perhaps the most

10

logical construction, that if you petition for cert, the

11

finality of the judgment is arrested and you have a full

12

year.

There -- there are established rules that a

The point is, finality will always be affected

13
14

by what the defendant does and does not do, and there will

15

always be a series of different rules, depending on

16

whether a petition for cert was filed, whether an appeal

17

was filed, and there will be different rules from State as

18

well as Federal.
There's a whole series of different rules; but

19
20

the rule of the court of appeals in this case was, if

21

nothing happens after the court of appeals issues its

22

decision, the judgment is final within the meaning of

23

2255.

24

routinely are final without being dependent upon the

25

expiration of the time for review.

That's consistent with the fact that judgments

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The formulation in 2244 is, in fact, unusual.

2

Congress provided for that in 2244, but did not provide

3

for that in 2255.
For all these reasons, I -- I urge the Court to

4
5

find that the decision of the court of appeals is correct,

6

the construction of the language affords the text its

7

natural meaning, does not work any harmful results, and

8

should be affirmed.
Thank you very much.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

17

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

18

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

19

If I could address first the question of whether or not

20

there is a background understanding of when a judgment of

21

conviction becomes final, because conceivably that would

22

give rise to the negative inference that Congress was

23

doing something special in 2244 that it didn't intend in

24

2255.

25

The amicus points the Court to the pre-amendment

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Rule 33, and I think it's important to play out exactly

2

what finality means there, because in the pre-amendment

3

Rule 33, there wasn't agreement on whether or not finality

4

attaches upon the issuance of a mandate.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I apologize, to criminal

procedure.

12

QUESTION:

Criminal procedure.

13

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

14

Under -- before it was amended, some courts said

I do apologize.

Some courts said it was the mandate.

15

it was the judgment.

16

That's discussed in the advisory committee notes to the

17

amendment.

18

In addition, most things under Rule 33, those

19

other than newly discovered evidence, ran from the entry

20

of the judgment in the district court, and perhaps most

21

important of all, it's settled under Rule 33, and this is

22

the Cook case from the Ninth Circuit that's cited in the

23

amicus brief, that under Rule 33 if a cert petition was

24

filed, that didn't stop the time.

25

QUESTION:

Well, you say it's settled.

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

It's

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, there were no

3

contrary cases, you're quite right.

4

passed on it, and there's no contrary authority.

5

And so my point is this.

This Court never

Even under Rule 33, it

6

could mean a lot of different things, and I do think it's

7

perfectly clear that among all the analogies, the closest

8

one is this Court's collateral review precedents.

9

I do want to pick up on Justice Breyer's and --

10

and the Chief Justice's question about, well, didn't they

11

explicate something in 2244 that they didn't in 2255, and

12

if I could give a contrary -- give a hypothetical where I

13

think that reasoning would apply, if 2255 said, when the

14

judgment of conviction becomes final by the expiration of

15

direct -- by the conclusion of direct review, it would be

16

very difficult for a 2255 petitioner to say, "and that

17

includes the time for seeking cert," because then you

18

would have a real contrast with 2244.

19

of the phrases in 55, but both in 44, and there you could

20

have a genuine inference.

21

You would have one

Here we don't have anything, and my point is

22

that this silence is not pregnant.

You don't draw the

23

inference that Congress meant nothing at all, or that

24

Congress meant -- as Justice Scalia points out, an even

25

narrower universe.
