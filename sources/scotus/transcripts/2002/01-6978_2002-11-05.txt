CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument now on

number 01-6978, Gary Albert Ewing versus California.
Mr. Denvir.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF QUIN DENVIR

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. DENVIR:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

In March 2000, Gary Ewing walked into a Los

10

Angeles pro shop, took three golf clubs, stuck them down the

11

pants legs, and walked out.

12

that crime.

For that crime --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. DENVIR:

15
16

He was quickly apprehended for

What was the value of the golf clubs?
Because the value of the golf clubs was

approximately $1200, it was grand theft under California law.
For grand theft, as a general matter, California

17

provides a maximum sentence of three years.

18

because Mr. Ewing had served a prior prison sentence, he would

19

be subject to a recidivism enhancement of one year, so the

20

maximum sentence that he would have faced under California

21

law, but for the so-called "three-strikes law," would have

22

been four years in prison, which could have been reduced by

23

one-half by his conduct in prison and his work in prison.

24

However, because Mr. Ewing had a prior conviction for first-

25

degree burglary, which has been classified as a serious felony

3

It also --

1

by California, and for robbery, which has been classified as a

2

violent felony by California --

3

QUESTION:

Was it armed robbery?

4

MR. DENVIR:

5

And because of those two convictions, he came under

He was armed with a knife at that time.

6

the California "three strikes and you're out" law.

7

result of that, he received a sentence of life imprisonment

8

and with a -- with an added bar that he could not even be

9

considered for parole for 25 years.
QUESTION:

10

And as a

Would it be fair to add that another

11

reason for the sentence was that the judge did not disregard

12

the priors, and that was because the judge had the record in

13

front of him and the record showed other --a history of other

14

offenses?

15

Would that be a fair statement?
MR. DENVIR:

It is correct, Your Honor.

It -- the

16

judge did have discretion to strike the priors or to reduce

17

this wobbler offense to a misdemeanor.

18

partly on the basis of his prior record.

19

were all misdemeanor convictions prior to that time.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. DENVIR:

She declined to do so,
His prior record
But --

They were all misdemeanors?
Yes, Your Honor.

All his -- he had --

22

the prior convictions that he had were felonies were four

23

felonies, all occurred within one year, in 19- -- in one

24

month, in 1993.

convictions, and then there was one robbery conviction.

There were three first-degree burglary

misdemeanors.
MR. DENVIR:

6

they call the "strike priors," but to the fact that he did

have other --

MR. DENVIR:

10

Oh, other than --- previous crimes that were

misdemeanors.

11

QUESTION:

-- other than the burglaries.

12

MR. DENVIR:

I think that's -- the sentencing judge

13

relied on that, to some degree, in denying him any

MR. DENVIR:

-- the one that was alleged to be a

felony, I think, in the government's brief --

MR. DENVIR:

I'm sorry.

Is in --

-- I think that it was only a

misdemeanor.
MR. DENVIR:

In fact, we've attached the governing

court records as an appendix to our reply brief that shows it
was a misdemeanor.
QUESTION:

How many -- how many convictions in all,

felonies plus misdemeanors?
MR. DENVIR:

Your Honor, I believe that he had the

14

four -- the four prior convictions -- the strike convictions,

15

the felonies, and I think he had another nine misdemeanors,

16

and then this present offense.

17

QUESTION:

I think that's the --

And the purpose of the three-strikes law,

18

as I understand it, is to take off of the streets that very

19

small proportion of people who commit an enormously high

20

proportion of crimes.

21

it's something like, you know, of those convicted, 20 percent

22

commit 85 percent of the crimes.

23

client is a very good candidate for that law.

24

MR. DENVIR:

25

QUESTION:

I forget what the statistics are, but

It sounds to me like your

We got -- we got --

I mean, if that's a reasonable law.

6

It

1

seems to me this is precisely the kind of person you want to

2

get off the streets.

He's obviously going to do it again.

MR. DENVIR:

3

Your Honor, we believe that the law, in

4

itself, is not unreasonable and it could result in a

5

proportionate sentence.

It did not in this case.

6

Under this Court's decision in Solem versus Helm,

7

the Court has said that you can look to the prior record as

8

relevant to the sentencing decision because it aggravates the

9

present crime, but the focus must remain on the present crime.
QUESTION:

10

Well, Solem stands with Rummel and with

11

Harmelin.

12

probably the case that favors you most.

13

is good law, and Harmelin is good law.

14

cases don't favor you.

15

They're really three different points, and Solem is

MR. DENVIR:

But certainly Rummel
And I think those

Well, Your Honor, I believe that

16

Rummel -- the Court said in Solem -- the majority opinion said

17

that Rummel would be controlling only in a similar factual

18

situation.

19

as Harmelin was concerned, the basic principles of Solem were

20

reaffirmed by seven justices in Harmelin and, we believe, when

21

applied here, will show that this is a grossly

22

disproportionate sentence.

23

We do not believe we have that here.

QUESTION:

And as far

Mr. Denvir, would you clarify whether

24

your challenge is strictly as applied?

25

some of the points that you make seem to be going to the

7

Because some of the --

1

statute wholesale.

2

statute's infirm, because it has no washout for aging

3

offenses, but there was no such offense at stake here.

4

strikes were all rather recent.

5

MR. DENVIR:

6

So, for example, you talk about it -- the

That's correct, Your Honor.

And --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. DENVIR:

9

The

So --- and to answer your question, we are

challenging only the sentence that Mr. Ewing received for the

10

crime that he committed, that he was sentenced at.

11

much discussion on both sides of -- as -- I -- as the

12

background of the three-strikes law.

13

three-strikes law could result in a -- in a constitutional

14

sentence.

15

that reached this sentence, this life sentence for stealing

16

three golf clubs, that sentence is -- falls under the Eighth

17

Amendment, in our view.

18

It did not, in this case.

QUESTION:

There's

We have no doubt the

So however the scheme is

But we -- so we should leave out things

19

like no washout, that someone who never served any time would

20

subject to the three strikes --

21

MR. DENVIR:

I think that's correct, Your Honor,

22

that they don't play into this case.

23

said, that the three-strikes law is merely -- it's the process

24

that produced an unconstitutional sentence.

25

been produced by a different sentencing scheme, also.

8

And I think that -- as I

It could have

1

QUESTION:

Well, when we're examining the

2

constitutionality of the three-strikes law, as applied to this

3

sentence, we should take into account, should we not, the

4

purposes of the California law, which was to have a law which

5

was -- gave simple, clear notice of the three-strikes policy?

6

And if you want us to take case-by-case, then that whole

7

policy is undercut, it seems to me.
MR. DENVIR:

8
9

think that's true.

Well, Your Honor, I don't -- I don't

In Solem v. Helm, the Court made very

10

clear that it was looking only to the sentence that was

11

imposed on Mr. Helm.
QUESTION:

12

Yeah, I was going to ask you about that,

13

because you had said that the principal focus has to be on

14

this sentence.

15

is when we have a recidivist scheme of this kind.

I'm just not sure what your authority for that

MR. DENVIR:

16

Well, Your Honor, the -- in

17

Solem versus Helm, the Court, of course, had a recidivist

18

scheme.

19

opposed to the nature of the prior offenses.

20

that the defendant, under double-jeopardy principles, cannot

21

be punished for those prior crimes; however, they are relevant

22

to the -- to the sentence imposed for the present crime.

23

the -- and the reason they are relative -- and the Court said

24

this best in Gryger versus Burke -- is what they -- what

25

they -- what they authorize is a, quote, "stiffened penalty

The focus there was on number of prior offenses, as

9

The Court said

And

1

for the latest crime, which is considered to be an aggravated

2

offense because of repetitive one."

3

reply brief.

4

That's at page 8 in our

But what Solem v. Helm made very clear is, although

5

the prior crimes are relevant, the focus must remain, when

6

judging proportionality or gross disproportionality, on what

7

this -- what this defendant did at this time, what he is being

8

sentenced for at this time.

9

QUESTION:

I'm just not sure how that works.

What

10

am I supposed to do with recidivism as a factor in analyzing

11

this sentence?

12

MR. DENVIR:

13

QUESTION:

Your Honor --

Give it some weight, but not controlling

14

weight, or something like that?

15

MR. DENVIR:

-- I think that what the Court can say

16

is that his prior crimes are relevant, in the sense that they

17

make this crime a more aggravated crime than a crime committed

18

by a first offender --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. DENVIR:

21

enhancement for that.

22

to -- he has -- his sentence has gone from a maximum of three

23

years for a first offender to life, all based on the

24

recidivism.

25

QUESTION:

Well --- and that there can be a reasonable
But in this case, he has been sentenced

Well, why --

10

1

MR. DENVIR:

2

QUESTION:

At that point --

-- why can't the State say that -- where

3

a person has a string of convictions like this man has, that

4

it's time to get him off the street, as Justice Scalia says,

5

that he simply cannot conform to the law?
MR. DENVIR:

6

Your Honor, if he, in fact, committed a

7

crime at this point that was a serious or a violent crime,

8

they may have a basis, but what the Court has said very

9

clearly is that --

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. DENVIR:

12

What --

because otherwise --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. DENVIR:

15

-- is the focus remains on this,

crimes.

-- he's being punished for the prior

I'm sorry, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

16

What --

Well, what's the reason for saying that

17

though -- that you can only -- that the focus remains on this

18

crime, but others are relevant?

19

of meaningless, it seems to me.

20

MR. DENVIR:

I mean, that really is kind

Well, I don't think so, Your Honor,

21

because, as I say, what the Court has said over the years is

22

that the important part about the prior crimes is that it

23

shows that this is a repeat offense.

24

committed offenses in a row makes this particular offense

25

worse.

And the fact that he has

The fact that he has committed worse offenses in the

11

1

past does not aggravate this crime.

2

still remains shoplifting three golf clubs, regardless if he

3

had been a triple murderer or anything else, and that's what

4

he's being punished for.

5

because of those prior crimes, their nature, there's really

6

serious double jeopardy --

7

QUESTION:

8

Thirty years?

9

three golf clubs?

10
11
12

I -- this is -- this

Because if he's being punished

What do you think would be enough?

Would you like 30 years for walking off with

MR. DENVIR:

Your Honor, I -- the -- if you -- if

you look at our -QUESTION:

I mean, if you're going to look on it as

13

just stealing three golf clubs, and cast a blind eye to his

14

long record of criminal activity, I don't know why you can

15

give him any more than, you know, a couple of years.

16

MR. DENVIR:

Well, Your Honor, if you look to our --

17

to the comparison with other jurisdictions -- and I just don't

18

think this has been highlighted in our brief -- there are

19

only -- there are only five jurisdictions that would have

20

allowed a life sentence.

21

jurisdiction, Montana, that would have allowed a term of years

22

as great as the minimum sentence here, and that's -- Montana

23

allows -- is five to a hundred years.

24

for either grand theft or recidivist grand theft --

25

QUESTION:

There's only one additional

But we said --

12

And most states allow

1

MR. DENVIR:

2

QUESTION:

-- ten years at the most.

-- we said in Rummel, there's always

3

going to be some state that punishes more harshly than others.

4

And certainly it was not intimated that that state, therefore,

5

would -- it was cruel and unusual.

6

MR. DENVIR:

No, that's correct, Your Honor.

In

7

Solem v. Helm, the Court noted that he could -- that Mr. Helm

8

could have received a comparable sentence in one other state,

9

and nevertheless held that it fell under the Eighth Amendment.

10
11

QUESTION:

Well, just help us one more time.

The

prior history is relevant, but then how relevant?

12

MR. DENVIR:

13

QUESTION:

Well, Your --

You say the principal focus has to be on

14

the three golf clubs, like we're some judges out of Victor

15

Hugo or something and that's all we have to focus on.

16

this -- there's a -- there's a long recidivism component here,

17

and that's the whole purpose of the California law that you're

18

asking us to ignore, it seems to me.

19

MR. DENVIR:

But

Your Honor, and -- what I'm saying

20

is -- I'm going back to what the Court said in Solem v. Helm

21

in its analysis, which I think is controlling here.

22

made -- it made the point that the -- the prior convictions --

23

he cannot be punished for those, but they do aggravate this

24

present crime that he's being punished for.

25

aggravate it is that -- is that this shows that it's a

13

It

And the way they

1
2

repetitive offense.
Now, he can have a reasonable enhancement of the

3

normal penalty for grand theft based on the repetition aspect

4

of it, but at some point it becomes unreasonable.

5

becomes unreasonable if you go from three years to life based

6

on his prior crimes.

7

QUESTION:

And it

At that -Why isn't it reasonable to say if he

8

commits another felony -- he's committed, you know, three

9

already and nine other convictions -- "One more felony,"

10

California tells him, "and you go away for life."

11

that reasonable?

12

Why isn't

And this -- and this was a felony.

MR. DENVIR:

Because of the nature of the crime that

13

he committed, which is stealing three golf clubs, a crime that

14

is not deemed either serious or violent under California law.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. DENVIR:

17

But is a felony under California law.
It is a felony.

It's actually a

wobbler and could be charged either way.

18

QUESTION:

Why --

19

MR. DENVIR:

20

QUESTION:

But in this case, it's a felony.

Why can't California decide that enough

21

is enough, that someone with a long string like this simply

22

deserves to be put away?

23

MR. DENVIR:

Well, Your Honor, if that were true,

24

then there would be no limiting principle on recidivist laws

25

under the Eighth Amendment.

It would -- at that point, you

14

1

could say the mere fact that he broke any law -- if he broke a

2

traffic offense -- a petty offense would show that he couldn't

3

follow the law and could get a life sentence.

4

QUESTION:

Oh, I'd be with you there, if it was a

5

misdemeanor or, you know, some -- but this is a felony under

6

California law.

7
8
9

MR. DENVIR:

It is a felony, and it's one of the

least grave felonies in California.
QUESTION:

But we have given -- we've said, at

10

least, here, that we are going to give great latitude to state

11

legislatures in determining how many years to give, and how to

12

categorize an offense.

13
14
15

Why don't -- why don't we look to the Harmelin case
for the standards, rather than Solem?
MR. DENVIR:

Harmelin came later.

Well, Your Honor, I think you do,

16

because, as I understand the Harmelin case, if you take the

17

dissent and the plurality, they both agreed on the basic

18

principle here, which is that there cannot be gross

19

disproportion between the offense and the sentence.

20

reason I go back to Solem versus Helm is that it was a

21

recidivist case and there was some further information.

22

And the

I don't -- as I read the Court's opinion, at least

23

the plurality opinion, in Harmelin, the big change was that

24

you would -- you would not look automatically to intra­

25

jurisdictional or inter-jurisdictional comparisons.

15

You would

1

first have to find an inference of gross disproportionality

2

before you'd go to the second -- the other two steps.

3

what I understood to be the major -- the major refinement of

4

Solem v. Helm that was in the plurality opinion.

5

QUESTION:

That's

I'm slightly stuck on this, because I --

6

I'd like -- there is some relevant information that I can't

7

get a hold of, and you may have some in your experience, but

8

it isn't in the brief.

9

Imagine -- let's take the set of people who have

10

committed at least two serious crimes or more, maybe 50

11

serious crimes.

12

warned, "If you do anything again, you've had it."

13

of that set of people.

14

They're very serious criminals.

And they're
So think

Now, I would like to know, in light of that set of

15

people, now one of the members of that set commits a crime

16

equal to stealing $1200 -- whether they steal $1200 or equal

17

to that; that's a very subjective judgment -- what's the

18

longest sentence such a person has ever actually served?

19

Here, they are going to 25 years, real years.

20

And the second question I'd like to know is, What is

21

the least bad crime that such a person ever committed who did

22

serve 25 real years?

23

MR. DENVIR:

24

QUESTION:

25

Well, Your Honor --

I'd like to know both of those things.

And, obviously, they're find-outable.

16

1

MR. DENVIR:

I -- let me see if I can answer your

2

question.

3

because it sets this absolute minimum of 25 years -- it's a

4

life sentence, but it adds a kicker to it which says, unlike

5

other life sentences, you have to wait at least 25 years

6

before you can even be considered.

7

was passed in 1994, we have no experience with this law.
QUESTION:

8
9

As far as under the three-strikes law, there is --

Obviously, I don't want

experience --

10

MR. DENVIR:

11

QUESTION:

12

Right.

-- under this law.

That would be

circular.

13

MR. DENVIR:

14

QUESTION:

15

So we -- since this law

Well, Your Honor --

What I'm looking for is, in the absence

of this law --

16

MR. DENVIR:

17

QUESTION:

Oh, I'm sorry.

I understand --

-- in the absence of this law, what is

18

the longest sentence a person like yours -- and I'm defining

19

"a person like yours" to be a really bad criminal who now will

20

commit another crime equal to or the same as stealing $1200.

21

And there's loads of records -- I mean, in the California

22

Adult Authority before this law was passed, et cetera.

23
24
25

And the second question is, what is the least bad
thing such a person who really served 25 years did?
MR. DENVIR:

Your --

17

1

QUESTION:

That -- those are empirical questions,

2

and you're talking about this being unusual.

3

it's unusual unless I know what happened to other people.
MR. DENVIR:

4

I don't know if

Well, Your Honor, I don't -- I --

5

there's nothing in the record that would answer that, but let

6

me see if I can answer it in a different way.

7

three-strike law, Mr. Ewing, with his record, could receive no

8

more than four years.

9

California besides the three-strike law.
QUESTION:

10

But for the

Now, there are other recidivist laws in

Under the California Adult Authority,

11

which was only the law in California for 70 years, people

12

could receive very, very, very long sentences.
MR. DENVIR:

13
14
15
16
17

They could, Your Honor, and California

is -QUESTION:

And -- not this long for this thing,

but -- but -- but -MR. DENVIR:

I think that's right.

I think the long

18

sentence -- the -- California substituted determinate

19

sentencing law for indeterminate in 1977, and -- but under the

20

old indeterminate sentencing law, my clear recollection is

21

that those long, indeterminate sentences were always triggered

22

by serious or violent felonies, and that is something that --

23
24
25

QUESTION:

No, they -- I've looked it up,

actually -MR. DENVIR:

No?

18

1

QUESTION:

-- and you're quite right that this is

2

not as -- you couldn't get this long a sentence, but you could

3

get a pretty long one for being a third offender and

4

committing a property crime.

5

MR. DENVIR:

6

QUESTION:

7
8
9

And --

But I -- that doesn't tell us how long

the people actually served.
MR. DENVIR:

Well, Your Honor, if you look for the

question of parole in California, which the -- which the State

10

suggests is -- saves his life sentence, the Court looked at

11

this in 1995 in the case California Department of Corrections

12

versus Moralez.

13

90 percent of all defendants who came up for their first

14

parole hearing were found unsuitable for parole and that

15

85 percent were found unsuitable at subsequent hearings.

16

that has not improved any, because, as you'll see in the

17

amicus brief of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, at page

18

18, as of 2000, the Board of Prison Terms, which is the --

19

which is the parole authority -- their official records show

20

that they only recommended parole in 1 percent of the 2000

21

cases that came before them with a life sentence.

22

And what the Court said at that time was that

QUESTION:

Now,

Mr. Denvir, can't the people of -- this

23

thing, by the way, was not adopted by the legislature, was it?

24

It was adopted by plebiscite, of the people of California --

25

MR. DENVIR:

By both, Your Honor.

19

1

QUESTION:

By both.

2

MR. DENVIR:

3

QUESTION:

Both by legislature and by --

By plebiscite.

So the people of

4

California decided, "We want to be tougher."

5

to be bound by whatever the more permissive scheme was

6

earlier?

7

decided, "This is no good.

8

We're not punishing people enough, or we're not keeping

9

them -- keeping them incarcerated long enough."

10

The people of California knew that scheme, and they

MR. DENVIR:

12

QUESTION:

14

We still have too much crime.

Why do we

have to be bound by whatever the previous record was?

11

13

Why do we have

Well --

It seems to me the question before us is,

is it unreasonable to put away somebody who has this record?
MR. DENVIR:

Your Honor, first of all, as to the

15

question of initiative versus legislation, it is my

16

understanding that the Court, in other areas, has said that

17

there's no greater deference given to one than the other.

18

But the other question is, there's no doubt that

19

some deference has to be paid by this Court to legislative

20

judgments or initiative judgments in the questions of

21

punishment and in dealing with recidivists.

22

made that very clear.

23

to the Court setting a very forgiving standard.

24

said that it would not require, in this area, or as excessive

25

fines, strict proportionality between the crime being punished

The Court has

But it is that deference that has led

20

The Court

1

and the sentence.

It has said it was only when there was a

2

gross disproportion, and that's a very deferential standard.

3

That is a standard that allows the legislature to make many

4

reasonable judgments, but says that --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. DENVIR:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. DENVIR:

9

QUESTION:

10

So how do you decide --- some judgments are unreasonable.

-- how much is too much?
Well, Your Honor --

What's the --

MR. DENVIR:

-- life imprisonment for -- for the

11

crime of stealing three golf clubs, we believe, is cruel and

12

unusual punishment.

13

QUESTION:

It's not life imprisonment.

14

QUESTION:

But we're just doing --

15

QUESTION:

It's 25 years.

16

MR. DENVIR:

17

QUESTION:

Your Honor --

It's 25 years that he'll really serve.

18

We know that.

19

is a matter of parole or a decision by other people.

20

As far as -- what happens after those 25 years

MR. DENVIR:

Your Honor, the sentence that he's been

21

given is life in prison.

22

unless some administrative agency determines to let him out.

23

And as I've just quoted you --

24

QUESTION:

25

He's been consigned to die in prison

But I mean, parole, in all the cases

you're citing, is relevant, so you can describe it as you

21

1

want.

2

to be in jail for at least 25 years, and then he might be

3

paroled.

4

We both know what the facts are.

MR. DENVIR:

The facts are he has

And he might be, but on -- there is

5

no -- there is nothing in this record that would suggest he

6

has a reasonable expectation in that regard.

7

fact, what's before the Court would suggest that there is not

8

a reasonable expectation, particularly if the animus that

9

drives -- that drove the passage of this law continues for 25

In fact -- in

10

years and they still think, "Well, gee, if they committed

11

these prior crimes, they ought to be locked up for life,

12

because they may commit other crimes."

13
14

QUESTION:

In the statistics that you were quoting,

though, those were not three-strikes cases.

15

MR. DENVIR:

16

QUESTION:

17

Those are not three-strikes cases.

Those are cases where people might have

gotten reduced time for good behavior --

18

MR. DENVIR:

19

QUESTION:

That's correct.

-- none of which is -- and one question I

20

wanted to ask you, in view of the infirmities of Mr. Ewing --

21

is he still alive?

22

MR. DENVIR:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. DENVIR:

25

He is alive, Your Honor.

He is --

Counselor --- he's lost -- he's aged and has lost

eyesight in one eye as a result, but he's still alive at this

22

1

point --

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. DENVIR:

4

now.

How old was he at the time of sentence?
He was 38 years old.

He's 40 years old

So --

5

QUESTION:

Counselor --

6

MR. DENVIR:

-- as a practical matter -- I mean,

7

this -- 25 years is probably a life sentence for him, unless

8

there's some major medical development that --

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Denvir, you conceded a moment ago

10

that the prior offenses can be considered for purposes of

11

treating this offense as an aggravated offense, given the

12

prior record; and yet when you answer -- you've done this more

13

than once -- when you have answered the question of going to

14

disproportionality, you have said, "It's 25 to life for

15

stealing three golf clubs."

16

I don't think you can have it both ways.

17

your argument is it's 25 -- the appropriate comparison is --

18

or the appropriate characterization is "25 to life for three

19

golf clubs," in which case you, in effect, are telling us,

20

"Ignore the priors; they don't aggravate," or you've got to

21

say, "It's 25 to life for stealing three golf clubs when you

22

have a prior record" -- whatever it was, nine prior offenses,

23

including four felonies, in this case.

24

I assume it may well affect the result.

25

MR. DENVIR:

Either

Which is it?

Because

Your Honor, I -- if -- I misspoke.

23

1

What we say is the focus must be on the present offense.

2

is an aggravated offense.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. DENVIR:

He is a repeat --

But when you said that --- a repeat offender.

5

offender.

6

prior record of nine offenses?"

He is a repeat

He is someone who committed this offense with a

QUESTION:

7

It

Is it inconsistent with your position --

8

when you say, "The focus must be on this offense," is it

9

inconsistent with that to say, "This offense -- is stealing

10

three golf clubs worth $1200 by somebody with a prior record

11

of nine offenses"?

12

on this offense, in the terms that you're using?

Is that consistent with putting the focus

MR. DENVIR:

13

I think it is, in the sense that it

14

shows that there has -- there has been some -- there has been

15

a series of repetition.

16

is that regardless of the repetition, the fact that it's a

17

repetitive offense, if the focus remains on what he did now,

18

the triggering offense, which, under Solem v. Helm, is the

19

focus, then no matter what he has done in the past, no matter

20

how much repetition, it is --it is grossly disproportional to

21

sentence him to a life sentence.
QUESTION:

22

But what I'm suggesting to the Court

At that point --

A hundred prior instances of stealing

23

three golf clubs would not affect the analysis then on your

24

view?

25

MR. DENVIR:

Your Honor, if there -- if there were

24

1

a -- if there were a series of crimes of the same nature --

2

for instance, if there -QUESTION:

3
4

Well, I've just -- I've just given you

one.

5

MR. DENVIR:

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

A hundred prior -- three golf clubs every

7

time, a hundred times -- would that justify the treatment that

8

he has gotten?
MR. DENVIR:

9

Your Honor, I think that that would --

10

that would show a propensity to steal golf clubs, but, again,

11

I don't believe --

12

QUESTION:

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. DENVIR:

15

QUESTION:

16

I would concede that, but the --

-- I don't believe --

Posit further that his score has not

improved.

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. DENVIR:

19

That may be beyond his control.

20

QUESTION:

He shouldn't be penalized for that.

Okay, but if we -- if we've got our crazy

21

example of a hundred priors exactly like this, and we follow

22

your verbal criterion at least of focusing on this offense as

23

aggravated, would this be disproportionate, grossly?

24
25

MR. DENVIR:

I believe that life is, because it is

still -- the crime that has to be punished -- I mean, and this

25

1

is what the Court said in Solem v. Helm -- this

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. DENVIR:

4

QUESTION:

is --

Well, maybe we were trying --- you know, in Solem v. Helm --

-- maybe we were trying to have it both

5

ways verbally because we were imprecise.

6

think that's what you're trying to do.

7

hand, you concede, yes, it may be regarded as an aggravated

8

offense in light of the priors, and then in the next breath

9

you say, "But the focus has got to be on this offense."

10

MR. DENVIR:

But with respect, I

Because on the one

Your Honor, I -- Your Honor, there's no

11

doubt that the prior record -- and the Court has said that is

12

relevant to the punishment for the present crime, and it does

13

aggravate it.

14

shoplifting three golf clubs can be, no matter what has

15

happened before --

But there are limits to how aggravated

QUESTION:

20

21

someone had a long history of jay-walking and had seven or ten

22

or a hundred convictions for jay-walking and jay-walked again?

23

I think the Court would not say you could get a life sentence

24

for that just --

25

Even with the hundred prior instances?
Your Honor, it's still three -- it's
It's not robbery, rape,

I don't --

1

MR. DENVIR:

-- because it's repetitive.

-- I don't think it would.

And the

3

reason it wouldn't is -- I assume you would concede -- is that

have no idea how he could have done that.

17

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD E. DE NICOLA

18

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

19

MR. DE NICOLA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

20

the Court:

21

question, I don't know what the statistics are under the old

22

indeterminate sentencing law that was in effect in California

23

until 1976.

24

question triggers an issue that I think is central here.

25

First, I think, in answer to Justice Breyer's

But in a way, I think the -- Your Honor's

The ISL, the old California law, was premised very

29

1

explicitly on a penological theory that emphasized

2

rehabilitation of the offender.

3

raised in this case, and it's a question that's particularly

4

apt in light of the Harmelin opinion, is, when can a state

5

decide that they're going to move away from a more lenient

6

policy of rehabilitation or extending leniency to a first-

7

time offender, and move toward a policy, a tougher policy, of

8

incapacitation?

9

QUESTION:

I think the question that's

So, tell me, am I fair to assume there

10

never, in the history of the United States, has been a person

11

who -- of the set -- I'm only -- I don't want to be

12

pejorative; I want to characterize it your way, and I'll

13

characterize it as taking the set of very serious criminals

14

with very serious records, and a person in that set commits

15

another crime, and the other crime is approximately theft of

16

$1200 -- and am I fair in saying there hasn't been, ever, a

17

sentence in the history of the United States in the last

18

hundred years anywhere close to this one?

19

my knowledge -- which you could get; it's public -- of 35,000

20

real cases in the federal system where to get a sentence like

21

this one for a prior offender, you had to -- you have to now,

22

you know, hijack an airplane, commit murder, something really

23

serious beyond belief compared to this, and that the worst

24

sentence you could get for something like this is about four,

25

five years.

30

And I base that on

1

And then I look to the California Adult Authority,

2

and I see, under that sentencing, nobody could have gotten

3

more than ten real years, and, indeed, the average was

4

somewhere around five.

5

you have come up with nothing in your brief.

6

can I say -- my assumption is, this is by an order or factor

7

of two or three times higher than anyone ever was sentenced

8

before in the United States for such a thing?

And you have all those records, and
And therefore,

You see, I'm making a very extreme statement

9
10

empirically, and I want to know what the response is to my

11

statement, and I want to know why I shouldn't hold you to my

12

statement since you have the information, and why I shouldn't

13

say that's just way too much.
MR. DE NICOLA:

14

Well, again, Your Honor, I -- the --

15

my answer is that I do not know what those records would have

16

shown.
QUESTION:

17

I guess he shouldn't hold you to it,

18

since you don't have the burden of persuasion here, do you?

19

thought you're defending a -- a decision below.
MR. DE NICOLA:

20

I

Yes, and I did interpret the issue

21

to be a proportionality issue rather than an unusualness

22

issue.

23

me that we had a three-time loser statute in California, and I

24

think that put people away for life without parole.

25

But I do -- something in the recesses of my mind tells

QUESTION:

Well, all right, how do we decide --how

31

1

do we decide if you say, of this serious set of criminals, you

2

go to jail for life if you jay-walk -- I mean, the next time.

3

Is that -- is that disproportionate?

4

what is or was -- is not if I don't look to the empirical

5

facts?

6

I'm just saying, Why shouldn't I decide on the basis of

7

empirical fact that is available?

8
9

How am I supposed to say

And I'm not holding you to present empirical facts.

MR. DE NICOLA:

Well, in our view, the most

prominent, kind of, objective factor that this Court could

10

look to in weighing this sentence is what the legislature has

11

said are felonies.

12

they've narrowed their target to a subclass of felons who have

13

committed what the legislature has deemed to be -- and I think

14

what, on the face of it, can reasonably be interpreted as

15

being -- serious or violent crimes.

16

QUESTION:

What California has done in this case is,

What's the limit for being -- what is the

17

dividing line between grand theft and petty theft in

18

California?

19

MR. DE NICOLA:

20

QUESTION:

21

Four hundred dollars, Your Honor.

When I went to law school, it was $100,

except if it was citrus you stole, it was $50.

22

(Laughter.)

23

MR. DE NICOLA:

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. DE NICOLA:

Now it's $100 if it's citrus.

But once there is that predicate of

32

1

serious or violent felonies set in place, then what the three-

2

strikes law does is, I think, reasonably moves toward a policy

3

of incapacitation upon the commission of, not just any new

4

crime, not a misdemeanor or an infraction, but a new crime

5

that the legislature has --

6

QUESTION:

One of the things that puzzles me about

7

the statute -- maybe you can enlighten me -- I thought that if

8

there were two priors that were violent but not related to

9

property, such as murder and rape, that the third related to

10
11

property wouldn't trigger the statute.
MR. DE NICOLA:

No, Your Honor.

The way the statute

12

is written is that if the prior felonies meet the statutory

13

definition of being serious or violent -- if you have two of

14

those, then any new felony triggers the three-strike sentence.

15

QUESTION:

Even if you -- if you had, say, a murder

16

conviction and a rape conviction and then you committed a

17

wobbler that was a property crime?

18

that as a third strike?

19
20
21
22
23
24
25

MR. DE NICOLA:

Would the statute treat

Yes, because wobblers are felonies,

by definition, in California, and any felony qualifies.
QUESTION:

Regardless of the character of the first

two strikes.
MR. DE NICOLA:

As long as the first two strikes

meet the level of being serious or violent, which -QUESTION:

I see.

So -- and there's no requirement

33

1

that it be related to property.

I misunderstood.

2

MR. DE NICOLA:

No, Your Honor.

3

QUESTION:

All right.

4

QUESTION:

Also, I don't know how to work with

5

felony and misdemeanor, because, across the nation, my

6

impression is that those are classified in very different

7

ways, and they're classified sometimes according to the prison

8

that you serve in, as in Massachusetts, and sometimes you can

9

find a felony that, in ordinary common sense, is a lot less

10

serious than certain misdemeanors.

11

to know what to work with unless you work with empirical fact.
MR. DE NICOLA:

12

That's why I'm very pushed

Well, we -- in California, the

13

felony is defined by the -- not just the locus of where the

14

term will be served, but also by the length.

15

year.

16

demarcation between offenses that, over the course of time,

17

society deems to be of elevated seriousness.

18

It's more than a

And we think that that's a traditional line of

QUESTION:

I think some of our constitutional

19

jurisprudence makes it -- makes -- turns upon the distinction

20

between felonies and misdemeanors, doesn't it?

21

MR. DE NICOLA:

Yes, Your Honor, I think that is so,

22

and there are political restraints on the legislature in

23

enacting laws in general applicability.

24

economic restraints on a legislature in deciding to set a

25

punishment scheme that provides for long terms of

34

There are certainly

1

imprisonment.

2

second-guess that, comes, we think, perilously close to the

3

court suggesting that the legislature can, in some instances,

4

not declare a certain crime to be a felony, but must declare

5

it to be a misdemeanor, and we don't think there's anything in

6

the Court's jurisprudence that would -- that would support

7

that type of an intrusion.

8
9

That's costly.

QUESTION:

And that to -- for a court to

Mr. De Nicola, there's a lot of

discretion built into this scheme.

It comes across as three

10

strikes and you're out, and that's it; but it's not.

11

discretion in the prosecutor and discretion in the judge.

12

there, in Los Angeles or in California, any guides to

13

prosecutors in exercising their discretion, say, whether to

14

treat a wobbler as a misdemeanor or a felony?

15

MR. DE NICOLA:

There's

As far as the striking a strike is concerned, is

The prosecutor can decide not to charge two

MR. DE NICOLA:

Yes, the prosecutor, under the

6

statute, is required to allege the priors, but the prosecutor

7

may seek dismissal of the prior strikes either in the

8

furtherance of justice, or because of problems of proof.

9

the judge also has authority to strike strikes, even without

13

the consent of the prosecutor, in California.
QUESTION:

But

And so --

And similarly, to reduce a wobbler to a

misdemeanor.
MR. DE NICOLA:

Yes, the prosecutor, in a way, has

14

that discretion, because he or she can charge a -- an

15

alternative felony or misdemeanor as a misdemeanor in the

16

first place, but even under the three-strikes law, the trial

17

judge retains the discretion to sentence a -- an alternative

18

felony misdemeanor as a misdemeanor, and that would take the

19

case out of the three-strikes scope.

20

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question about your

21

theory of the limits of the constitutional protection here?

22

Supposing the offense was speeding -- and it can be dangerous

23

speeding -- and you had a -- you said that -- 15 arrests for

24

speeding gives you this very sentence we got in this case.

25

Would that be permissible, do you think?

36

Just on the theory

1

that Justice Scalia has explained -- where this guy is just

2

too dangerous, we just don't want him on the street anymore,

3

so we'll put him in jail for life, 25 years without

4

possibility of parole.
MR. DE NICOLA:

Well, we think that might possibly

be constitutional, Your Honor.

unconstitutional?
MR. DE NICOLA:

9

Might possibly be constitutional.

10

think it's more likely that it would

11

be -QUESTION:

12

Well, why wouldn't it clearly be

13

constitutional if we're thinking about protecting the public

14

from repetitive offenders?
MR. DE NICOLA:

15

Well, because I think the limiting

16

principle that we're seeking here, Your Honor, is one that's

17

premised on the felony classification.

18

the --

QUESTION:

I

If

Do you think the statute would have been

20

unconstitutional if they had said it's a misdemeanor when it's

clubs for $1200 by a misdemeanor instead of by felony, would

23

that change the constitutional analysis?

definitions of a separate statutory scheme, so they would

12
13
14

QUESTION:

But are there not serious crimes that are

not violent?
MR. DE NICOLA:

Yes, I think that's true.

There are

15

serious crimes where no injury is inflicted, but the crimes, I

16

think, by their nature, tend to be crimes where the prospect

17

of violence is rather imminent.

18

QUESTION:

But they're -- I'm just trying to -- I'm

trying to understand the theory.

21

MR. DE NICOLA:

QUESTION:

Is violence an absolute

No, I think -- I think --

Okay.

So then we could have something

23

equivalent -- maybe instead of $1200, $2000 or something.

if you just had five -- or three or four $2,000 burglaries,

Yes.

That would distinguish it from

even though the prior crimes don't necessarily have to involve

the actual infliction of violence, they are crimes that by

12

But in your view, violence is really more

13

significant than the number of prior offenses, if I understand

14

you correctly.
MR. DE NICOLA:

15

Well, I think it might be a sliding

16

scale, but I think violence does play a significant role and

17

can justify a scheme like this, even in the absence --

18

QUESTION:

Okay.

19

MR. DE NICOLA:

20

QUESTION:

-- of a great number of priors.

But you -- but I'm not quite sure what

21

your view would be if there were no violence, but just seven

22

or eight high-speed offenses, say, speeding, or $1200 golf

23

clubs.

24
25

MR. DE NICOLA:

Well, we think a lot would depend on

whether the legislature in the jurisdiction had determined

7

declares those to be a felony, then I think we become a lot --

8

we come a lot closer to --

9
10
11

QUESTION:

It depends on what the legislature calls

the offense.
MR. DE NICOLA:

Yes, it does, Your Honor, in a very

12

significant respect, because what the legislature calls the

13

offense in connection with it being a misdemeanor or a felony

14

does reflect, we think, a reliable longstanding consensus of

15

the -- of the community.

16

deference and reliance and objective factors, we think that's

17

a prominent objective factor.

18

QUESTION:

And under the Harmelin principles of

On Justice Stevens' hypo, taking it one

19

step further, I guess we would have to say that if there were

20

15 prior speeding offenses, and they had been classified as

21

felonies in California, that there was no disproportion

22

between 25-to-life for 15 -- with a predicate of 15 prior

23

speeding offenses, on the one hand, and the penalties for

24

torture and murder, on the other hand.

25

undisputed that the only standalone penalties that are this

40

Because I think it's

1

great are the penalties for torture and homicide.

be rather a stretch, wouldn't it, regardless of whether the

3

legislature wants to put a felony label on them or not?

4

MR. DE NICOLA:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. DE NICOLA:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. DE NICOLA:

9

That would

Well, again, Your Honor --

Speeding's important, but -Yes.

-- I mean, torture and murder?
I do think that it is a much tougher

case for us, and I'm not at all certain that it would be

10

constitutional if all of the crimes, the predicate through the

11

new crime, were simply speeding.

12

QUESTION:

I think --

Might it be an abuse of the judge's

13

discretion not to reduce such a -- if it's a wobbler, in such

14

a case, or not to strike a strike?

15

MR. DE NICOLA:

Well, I don't -- in the

California

16

context, the question would only arise -- well, I don't think

17

it would arise at all, because you wouldn't have a speeding --

18

even as a predicate, any felony-triggering offense, and the

19

speeding wouldn't qualify as a serious or violent felony under

20

the statute anyway.

21

from the three-strikes scheme that California has in place.

22

QUESTION:

So this hypothetical is very far removed

I would have thought that your response

23

to Justice Souter would have been that it might seem

24

disproportionate insofar as the penal goal of punishment or

25

retribution is concerned, but it depends on what you want your

41

1

penal goals to be.

California has decided that disabling the

2

criminal is the most important thing, and in -- from that

3

point of view, it's not necessarily disproportionate.

4

is disabled as the other.

5

MR. DE NICOLA:

6

QUESTION:

The one

Well --

I mean, proportionality -- you

7

necessarily have to look upon what the principal objective of

8

the punishment is.

9

retribution, then, sure, I guess it's disproportionate to

If the objective of -- if the objective is

10

execute somebody for killing only one person, when you do no

11

more than execute somebody for killing 20 people.

12

purpose is disabling the criminal, I'm not sure that it --

13

that the example that Justice Souter gave is disproportionate.
MR. DE NICOLA:

14

But if your

Well, again, Your Honor, I don't --

15

I don't think I would absolutely concede that it would be

16

unconstitutional.

I'm just saying that --

QUESTION:

17

Well, do you adopt Justice Scalia's

18

analysis?

19

interesting point.

20

proportionality analysis, have the option to adopt a different

21

theory of penalty?

22

you adopt that argument here?

23

justification that you want to rely on in this case?

24
25

I mean, this came up in the briefs, and this was an
Does the State, for purposes of

And he's given an example.

MR. DE NICOLA:

Do you -- do

And do you think that is a

Yes, we do adopt the theory of

incapacitation, and we do rely on incapacitation as a theory

42

1
2

that justifies the sentence in this case.
QUESTION:

All right.

Here's the problem that I

3

have with that, and this is -- this is -- this is what I wish

4

you would address.

5

proportionality or gross disproportionality analysis, this

6

kind of -- the consideration of varying intentions --

7

retribution, incapacitation, deterrence, and so on -- and

8

every time the State gets to a very high offense, the State

9

says, "Oh, we've changed the theory.

If we allow, for purposes of

We've gone from

10

deterrence to retribution," it seems to me that it makes this

11

kind of analysis of comparables -- this proportionality

12

analysis -- impossible because we no longer have two

13

comparable entities on either side of our comparison.

14

have is a low sentence on the one hand for deterrence, and a

15

high sentence for incapacitation or retribution.

16

apples and oranges instead of oranges and oranges.

17

What we

We have

So my question is, if we accept the State's option

18

to say, "We've changed the theory," don't we read

19

comparability analysis right out of the law?

20

simply become logically impossible?

21

MR. DE NICOLA:

Doesn't it

Well, I think it becomes much more

22

difficult, but I don't think it necessarily becomes logically

23

impossible, because I think there is still room for judicial

24

scrutiny, within the context of the Harmelin narrow

25

proportionality principle, to take a hard look --

43

1

QUESTION:

But my problem is, I don't know what

2

we're supposed to -- what we can compare for comparable

3

examples on proportionality analysis if it can be

4

fundamentally affected by the State's change of intention from

5

one theory in one crime, or one set of penalties, to another

6

theory in another set of penalties.

7

compare.

9

We no longer have comparables.
MR. DE NICOLA:

8

I don't see what we can

Well, but I think the Court can

still look at whether the phenomenon of -- as in this case, of

10

heightened recidivism based on prior violence, or serious

11

offenses threatening violence and triggered by a new crime

12

that, say -- that's classified as a felony by the legislature

13

and that offers a sentence of -- a lengthy sentence, but that

14

still offers a possibility of

15

parole --

16

QUESTION:

I guess the conclusion that Justice

17

Souter's questions would lead to is that a State cannot use

18

any factor except retribution.

19

factor, it does so at the risk of our simply holding it to be

20

disproportionate.

21

MR. DE NICOLA:

22

QUESTION:

Or if it uses any other

Yes, Your Honor --

And I don't know that our -- I'm sure

23

that our cases don't support that.

24

MR. DE NICOLA:

25

It -- and I acknowledge it -- to

Justice Souter, it makes it a very difficult situation.

44

But

1

under Harmelin, those, I think, are penological objectives

2

that the Judiciary ought to defer to the State.
QUESTION:

3

But maybe -- maybe, and I -- we've -- we

4

haven't said this -- maybe our assumption is that the State,

5

in establishing a penal system, is going to establish it on a

6

set of consistent and neutral principles from beginning to

7

end.

8

constitutional analysis?

9

MR. DE NICOLA:

10

Would that be a legitimate basis for us to ground our

No, Your Honor.

It disables the

states from changing -- from dealing with changing conditions.

11

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. De Nicola.

12

Mr. Chertoff, we'll hear from you.

13

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL CHERTOFF

14

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

15

MR. CHERTOFF:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

16

the Court:

17

Souter posed to Mr. De Nicola really framed the issue in light

18

of this case's most recent pronouncement in Harmelin -- this

19

Court's most recent pronouncement in Harmelin.

20

I think the last series of questions which Justice

I would have read Harmelin as establishing two

21

principles, at a minimum.

One is, the analysis is not

22

proportionality; it's gross disproportionality, an extremely

23

rare basis to invalidate a statute.

24

the states are entitled to adopt different penological

25

theories, or a mix of theories.

Second, we recognize that

In fact, I would have thought

45

1

that a state's entitled to say, for example, that certain

2

types of crimes ought to be addressed in terms of retribution;

3

other types of crimes posing other kinds of issues can be

4

dealt with in terms of deterrence and incapacitation.
And if the consequence of that principle is that

5
6

this Court has very limited review on comparability of

7

sentences, at least where you're dealing with sentences that

8

allow for the possibility of parole, then I think the

9

conclusion is that it is the extremely rare case in which a

10

sentence gets -QUESTION:

11

Well, why isn't that this case?

I mean,

12

I don't know how to approach proportionality other than to

13

say, what sentences are given for the same crime, or what

14

crimes are treated with the same sentence?
Now, suppose, looking at that, I find this is the

15
16

rare case.

If it isn't, why isn't it?

17

information we have, as I've said before, seems to suggest

18

that this is higher by a factor of two or three times anything

19

else you can find.

20

MR. CHERTOFF:

21

QUESTION:

22

I mean, all the

Well --

Now, if that isn't grossly

disproportionate, why isn't it?
MR. CHERTOFF:

23

It's not for several reasons, Your

24

Honor.

First of all, although there's nothing in the record

25

to speak to what the pre-1977 proportions were in terms of

46

1

sentencing, we do know, for example, that elsewhere in the

2

country there have been comparable sentences.

3

the United States --

4

QUESTION:

We've cited in

Cited a lot of instances in which the law

5

permits such a sentence, but that's quite different from

6

saying there was such a sentence.

7

MR. CHERTOFF:

Actually, I think in footnote 13,

8

we've cited several cases in other states where you have very

9

comparable punishments, where you have larcenies between 4-

10
11

and $700 as the third strike -QUESTION:

And do you have instances where people

12

were sentenced to 25 real years in prison for having committed

13

such an offense?

14

such a sentence?

15

Or were you citing that the law would permit

MR. CHERTOFF:

We cited review and rejection of

16

disproportionality challenges in one case in Nevada to a life

17

sentence without parole for a grand larceny of --

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. CHERTOFF:

20

Good, okay, thank you.
-- $476, and a similar one, I think,

in South Dakota.

21

Also, of course, as we look at the current

22

sentencing regime, this is not, as in Solem versus Helm, where

23

you have single judge who is apparently an outlier under the

24

state sentencing scheme.

25

a petitioner's own figures, you have at least 2- to 300

In this case, if one takes, in fact,

47

1

individuals whose third strike, under the California scheme as

2

it now exists, has, in fact, been a property-based crime.

3

And I think the most compelling reason why this is

4

not that very, very rare case where we strike down a sentence

5

is precisely what Justice Ginsburg has been repeatedly asking

6

about, the discretion that the courts have to tailor the

7

particular sentence in this case to the facts of the case.

8

we look at the record in this case, in the joint appendix, the

9

sentencing judge carefully considered the entirety of the file

If

10

with respect to the trigger -- or the predicate offenses,

11

which involved, actually, three burglaries in the course of a

12

single month, one of which involved pulling a knife and

13

threatening somebody, as well as at least nine prior offenses.

14

And interestingly, in no case since 1988 had the

15

petitioner ever successfully completed probation or parole.

16

He was always violating probation or parole by committing his

17

next offense.

18

looked at and explicitly referred to in rejecting the request

19

on the part of the petitioner either to downgrade the

20

triggering offense to a misdemeanor, or to eliminate some of

21

the strikes.

22
23
24
25

And that's precisely what the sentencing judge

And I would have thought that is precisely what we
expect and want judges to do in a rational sentencing system.
QUESTION:

In effect, you're -- going back to the

beginning of your argument, I think you're -- I think you're

48

1

saying that what the judge here did in rejecting the request

2

to downgrade or to disregard, in effect, was saying, "Yes, I

3

am finding that this is a case in which it is appropriate to

4

sentence on an entirely different theory, a theory of putting

5

them away, as opposed to a theory of deterrence," and I --

6

that seems to be the logic of what's going on.
MR. CHERTOFF:

7

That's correct; an entirely different

8

theory, though, that is embraced by the State in passing this

9

law.
QUESTION:

10

And may I ask you one more question on

11

that?

12

me at the beginning.

13

the State could change its theories.

14

guess what that means for proportionate or gross

15

disproportionality analysis is this:

16

can pass our Eight Amendment test if it has a reasonable basis

17

for saying, "We are going, under certain circumstances, to say

18

there is a changed theory of sentencing.

19

from deterrence or mere retribution to a theory or public

20

protection, putting away the person who simply will repeat and

21

repeat and repeat."

22

Because again, you started toward it in responding to
Like you, I came in here assuming that
If that is so, then I

A State can do it and

The theory changes

So, for purposes of our proportionality analysis,

23

the question would come down, do they have a reasonable basis

24

for doing that under their statute, in general?

25

particular, is there a reasonable basis for saying that this

49

And in

1

is a case for that?

And if the answers to those two questions

2

are yes, then it passes the test.

3

that analysis?
MR. CHERTOFF:

4

Is that -- would you adopt

I would absolutely agree that if it

5

satisfies those two, it passes the test.

6

that if it flunks those, it automatically fails the test.

7

certainly if you meet those conditions, I think you pass the

8

test.

9

That's not to say
But

And I think there's a common sense to that.
One could look, for example, at certain types of

10

violent crimes, like murders and rapes and say, irrespective

11

of whether it was a crime of passion or something that will

12

never happen again, "It is so heinous, our philosophy is we

13

have to punish it."

14

small crimes, at least if they're felonies, and say, "If

15

someone is repetitiously unable to conform their conduct to

16

the requirements of the law, we don't have to wait until he

17

commits the next felony or the next two felonies before we put

18

an end to it."

But one can also look at comparatively

19

And interestingly, if one goes back to Blackstone,

20

who talks a little bit about the issue of proportionality as

21

it related back in his day, he discusses the fact that when

22

you deal with habitual offenders, it would be cruel to the

23

public to simply allow that person to get out again and commit

24

their next crime.

25

So, I don't know that it's so much that the State

50

1

changes its theory, as that the State adapts its theory to the

2

particular type of crime and particular type of offender.

3

that's, of course, what we want to have in sentencing.
And, finally, I would say this.

4

And

In a scheme like

5

California, where the state judge has the power to tailor to

6

the particular offender and the particular offense what the

7

right answer is, for the federal courts to come in under gross

8

disproportionality analysis and recalibrate that -- even if,

9

sitting as state trial judges, the justices might feel we

10

would do it differently -- would be essentially converting the

11

courts into a constitutional sentencing commission.

12

one looks at the companion case -QUESTION:

13
14

And if

Excuse me, would be essentially

to -MR. CHERTOFF:

15

19

And that would be a very bad thing.

agree.

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. CHERTOFF:

23

Doing the kind of

It would be a -- certainly very

to emerge, where every fact pattern is evaluated slightly

4

One court views burglary as being a violent

QUESTION:

Could you argue that, because discretion

5

is consistent with the goals of the statute before the

6

sentencing, that some discretion is also permitted to a

7

reviewing court after the sentencing, and they can still

8

maintain the symmetry and the purpose of the statute?

9

MR. CHERTOFF:

The state law could certainly provide

10

for some kind of review as a matter of state sentencing law in

11

terms of abuse of discretion by the sentencing judge.

12

QUESTION:

But in this -- in California, does the

13

appellate court ever set aside sentences on the ground there

14

was an abuse of discretion to invoke the three strikes law?

15

MR. CHERTOFF:

I know of cases where they have

16

affirmed trial judges that have set aside strikes.

17

know of a case --

18
19

QUESTION:

No, I -- has -- has a trial judge ever

been set aside for imposing the third strike?

Mr. Denvir, you have one minute remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF QUIN DENVIR

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Thank you, Mr. Chertoff.

MR. DENVIR:

7

Your Honor, the point I -- I'd like to

8

make two points.

One is, if the discretion in -- under the

9

California law is very limited.

One thing would be to treat a

10

wobbler, if it is a wobbler, and reduce it to a misdemeanor;

11

so you would go from 25 to life, or life, to one-year maximum

12

penalty.

13

strike a prior conviction.

14

Supreme Court in Romero said that's a very limited discretion,

15

that it is only when you can find that this offender is

16

The only other point I'd make, as far as the

22

24

and, therefore, the Court can't look at that," then it really

25

writes the Eighth Amendment protections against grossly

53

1

disproportional sentences out totally.

2

question of -- they say, "Here's our reason," and you can't

3

even question that, because they can always claim they want to

4

incapacitate any criminal for any amount of time.
