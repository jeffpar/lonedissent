ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT N. ECCLES

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. ECCLES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
When Congress enacted ERISA, it created a

11

Federal regulatory structure for employers and unions to

12

sponsor plans that provide health care benefits for

13

employees and their families.

14

plans throughout the country have chosen to provide these

15

benefits through HMO's or other managed care entities that

16

use limited provider networks in order to deliver quality

17

health care at a reasonable cost.

18

The vast majority of ERISA

The Kentucky laws before the Court today

19

preclude that use of limited provider networks and require

20

an HMO, and by using that term I mean to encompass a

21

variety of managed care arrangements, require those

22

arrangements to allow into the network any provider

23

willing to accept the network terms.

24

from preemption State laws which regulate insurance, the

25

question here is whether these any willing provider, or

Because ERISA saves

1

AWP laws, regulate insurance.

2

QUESTION:

3

Now, I take it these laws have become

fairly common --

4

MR. ECCLES:

5

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

-- around the country, so Kentucky's

6

not alone in having such a law.

7

MR. ECCLES:

Kentucky has a relatively broad

8

law, Your Honor.

Many of the laws are pharmacy solely,

9

but they -- Kentucky is not alone, that's correct.

10

QUESTION:

Yes.

11

QUESTION:

Can -- can Kentucky exclude certain

12

specialties, like they say, we will not have

13

chiropractors?

In -- in Kentucky, can the plans do that?

14

MR. ECCLES:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

No.

In other words, they have to be open

to various subspecialties?
MR. ECCLES:

There are -- there are different

18

laws about that.

The Kentucky law by itself, in the

19

definition of provider, includes a variety of specialties,

20

including chiropractor, and there's a separate

21

chiropractor any willing provider law also, but the

22

question here is whether that law regulates insurance, and

23

last term, in Rush Prudential versus Moran, the Court said

24

that a law regulates insurance when insurers are regulated

25

with respect to insurance practices.

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

AWP laws do not regulate insurance practices.

2

They do not affect the risk of financial loss that's

3

transferred by the HMO policy, they do not change the

4

terms of the policy at all, and they do not change the

5

bargain between the insurer and the insured.
QUESTION:

6

But they -- they do have something to

7

say about who's going to be available as a doctor on the

8

plan.
MR. ECCLES:

9

They -- they change the network,

10

that's correct, Your Honor.

potentially change the network.

17

The law itself creates no

If the provider elects to join the network, and

QUESTION:

14

They -- through a -- they

But isn't that a change in the

Doesn't it give the patient a right he otherwise

MR. ECCLES:

No, Your Honor.

It -- it gives the

18

patient no right he would otherwise not have.

19

at the exemplar policy that's in Exhibit C to the joint

20

appendix, you will see nothing that's changed in the

21

policy terms.

22

QUESTION:

If you look

Well, there's nothing in the policy

23

term that is changed in -- in the literal sense of a

24

change in language, but it seems to me that it does mean

25

that under a policy subject to a law like Kentucky's, the

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

person who joins the HMO, in effect the person who obtains

2

the insurance, has a far greater choice, in -- in effect,

3

in -- in the expenditure of benefits under that policy

4

than he otherwise has.

5

policy subject to the Connecticut law -- the Kentucky law,

6

that he does not get under a policy without that law, and

7

that is a breadth of choice about who is going to treat

8

him.

9

MR. ECCLES:

He's getting something under a

Not necessarily, Your Honor.

The

10

choice, you know, exists if the provider elects to join

11

the network, and it's entirely --

12

QUESTION:

Well -- well, sure, but I mean, the

13

point of the statute and the point of the case is that

14

providers do elect, and to the extent that they elect,

15

the -- the person subject to the policy has a choice that

16

is a -- a breadth of options that otherwise are not going

17

to be available.

18

MR. ECCLES:

19

QUESTION:

Potentially.

In a --

Even -- not potentially.

I mean,

20

even -- even if nobody elected -- even if nobody elected

21

to join, what has happened by reason of this law, is it

22

not the case that the term of the policy is changed, that

23

originally the policy said, we will pay for your treatment

24

by a limited number of individuals whom -- whom we -- whom

25

we approve, and that policy is now changed to, by reason

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of this law, we will pay for your treatment by any

2

individuals who want to join our plan.

3

that a different policy?
MR. ECCLES:

4

Not -- the policy does not change

5

in that way, Justice Scalia.

6

says -QUESTION:

7

Isn't -- isn't

What -- what the policy

It's not rewritten, but doesn't the

8

law have that effect, to -- to effectively change the term

9

of the policy?
MR. ECCLES:

10

No -- no, it does not, and the

11

reason is, what the policy provides is, we will pay for

12

care from participating physicians, from network

13

providers, and that is still the policy.

14

with or without the AWP law.
QUESTION:

15

The -- before,

Well, to use your term, physicians,

16

before the law, is defined as those physicians whom we are

17

willing to accept as part of the plan, and after the law,

18

the definition of participating physician is any physician

19

who wants to join the plan.
MR. ECCLES:

20
21

It -- it has taken away the HMO's

ability to select, that's correct --

22

QUESTION:

It's --

23

MR. ECCLES:

-- but the definition of who -- it

24

is still limited to participating physicians who meet its

25

own --

1

QUESTION:

In -- in your opening remarks, you

2

said it doesn't change the bargain.

3

thrust of Justice Scalia and Justice Souter's questions

4

is, it does exactly that.
MR. ECCLES:

5

It seems to me the

But the -- before or after the AWP

6

law, the participant has no right to choose any particular

7

provider.

8

network physicians under the terms in the policy.

The participant has the right to use the

QUESTION:

9

Yes.

MR. ECCLES:

10

After the AWP law, if a provider

11

joins the network, the participant still has exactly the

12

same right.

The network has a different composition.

13

QUESTION:

14

not seem to make sense to me.

15

right, in theory, certainly to go to any physician in the

16

network, but the HMO has been required to expand the

17

network.

18
19

But -- but that -- that really does

MR. ECCLES:

QUESTION:

21

MR. ECCLES:

23

Under that hypothetical, that's

correct, Your Honor, you know, if that's --

20

22

The purchaser has the same

What's hypothetical about it?
Well, we don't know the effect of

the law on the networks -QUESTION:

Well, for instance, here, if it's

24

chiropractic services, and let's assume the HMO did not

25

previously include chiropractic physicians as providers,

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

after this law, if a chiropractic physician in good

2

standing were willing to come in under the HMO, then the

3

HMO would have to take that physician, and then the -- the

4

patient would have a possibility, at least, of having paid

5

services seeing a chiropractor that formerly would not

6

have been available.
MR. ECCLES:

7

That -- that would be a

8

significantly different law, Justice O'Connor, and for

9

this reason.

In that case, which is generally referred to

10

as a mandatory provider law, it's very much like the

11

mandatory benefit laws that this Court has held to be

12

saved.

13

insured to get that type of care, and it changes the risk

14

under the policy.

15
16
17

That changes the legal rights to get -- of the

QUESTION:

No, well, why -- why is what I said

different from what happens here?
MR. ECCLES:

Because the terms of the -- the

18

network would already provide for chiropractors.

19

question is how many would come in.

20

regulate that.

21

Kentucky law.

22

The only

This law would not

That's regulated through other aspects of

QUESTION:

Well, it -- it's -- maybe I'm under a

23

misapprehension as to how the bill -- I -- I thought that

24

the -- one of the examples given in the brief was, a woman

25

is being treated during the term of her pregnancy, she

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

changes her employer, she wants the same doctor to --

2

to treat her, and she is the one that can initiate the

3

request to the HMO, please allow this doctor to treat me,

4

and the doctor then says yes, I'm willing to be bound by

5

the terms of the HMO, and -- and she has that doctor.

6

That seems to me to significantly increase the bargain

7

that she made.
MR. ECCLES:

8
9

But the -- the bargain in that

circumstance, if it -- if it works out that way, she --

10

she is able to stay with the doctor, but under -- only if

11

the doctor can get into the network, and is willing to

12

meet the terms of the network.

13

doctor to come in.
QUESTION:

14

It's entirely up to the

Yes, but before the law, the network

15

could have refused him categorically, even though he were

16

willing to meet the terms.

17

MR. ECCLES:

That -- that's correct, Your Honor.

18

QUESTION:

I -- is --

19

QUESTION:

I hear you, I just don't see that --

20

that you -- you make much headway in saying that isn't a

21

change.
MR. ECCLES:

22

Because the -- the change is the

23

legal right of the insured, which was never to any

24

particular provider, and that's still true after the --

25

the law.

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

I don't -- you -- you're really

2

asserting that -- that two insurance policies are exactly

3

the same, their terms haven't changed, or their terms

4

aren't different, where one says you can get your

5

automobile fixed, we will pay to get your automobile fixed

6

by these companies, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and the

7

other one says, we will pay to get your automobile fixed

8

by any company that is willing to do the job up to our

9

standards, and -- and you think those two insurance

10

policies are saying exactly the same thing, that there's

11

only a hypothetical difference between the two.
MR. ECCLES:

12

I -- I think the difference between

13

that hypothetical and -- and mine is, the -- the standard

14

with or without the law is still, if the provider comes

15

into the network, and you have the right to the network

16

provider, and that's all.
QUESTION:

17
18

your view is correct, why are you objecting to the law?
MR. ECCLES:

23

We believe that the law

interferes -QUESTION:

21
22

The thing I don't understand is, if

Doesn't have any impact on your

business.
MR. ECCLES:

Yes, it couldn't, Your Honor, it

24

precludes the plans from limited networks, and what that

25

does, and this is the point made by the FTC staff, which

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

has been writing States objecting to these laws, is it

2

creates an uncertainty in the network, because the bargain

3

that's been made, the noninsurance bargain between the HMO

4

and the providers is, it's altered, although the policy is

5

not, and -- and suddenly, the providers who are in the

6

network already, they -- they signed up for a different

7

deal, which was a limited network.

8

deal they've got, because they'll have less patient volume

9

than they thought they were getting.

10

They may not want the

It also adds significantly just administrative

11

costs to deal with more providers, and it's also more

12

difficult to monitor quality with a larger network, so it

13

does have -- it's the uncertainty of what the law's effect

14

will be that --

15

QUESTION:

But you're complaining about the --

16

the increase in the number of providers, and it's that

17

increase that is what might be desirable from the

18

patient's standpoint.

19

MR. ECCLES:

Well, we're really complaining

20

about the uncertainty that's created, that the networks

21

can no longer be selective, which has quality and cost

22

implications, including fee implications.

23

QUESTION:

The -- the any willing provider

24

statutes have been around now for sometime.

I understand

25

the case that you're making in its most dramatic is, this

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

spells the end of HMO's, because the whole thing works

2

only if they have few doctors and lots of patients, so the

3

doctors have a guaranteed patient flow.

4

in States with any willing provider laws, that there are

5

so many doctors who are coming in that the doctors who

6

were in in the beginning now say, the rates have to go

7

way, way up, because we don't have any guaranteed patient

8

flow any more?

9

MR. ECCLES:

Has that happened

I -- I can't tell you about the

10

number of doctors, Justice Ginsburg.

11

in -- cited in, particularly in the amicus briefs, suggest

12

that there's been about a 15 percent increase in cost

13

arising out of --

14

QUESTION:

The studies that are

If that's so, I mean, since -- I'm

15

not sure of the relevance of this, but I mean, if it

16

turned out that this law or others like it drove up costs

17

for no advantages, couldn't the Federal Government stop

18

them by -- under Medicare and Medicaid, wouldn't they have

19

enough power, or would they, to simply write regulations

20

such that they won't reimburse States for -- if these

21

circumstances were quite bad?

22

MR. ECCLES:

I -- I'm not sure they could do it

23

in -- in that avenue, through Medicare or Medicaid.

The

24

Federal Government could obviously do it directly with its

25

own law on the books, which would --

concerned, a) we don't know that there's any harm.

10

MR. ECCLES:

b) We don't know that the Government

12

could deal with it in some other way, and so it's pretty

much irrelevant to our decision, is that right?

What is relevant is

question.

19

MR. ECCLES:

20

QUESTION:

The --

Is the whole distinction that here

21

the direct beneficiary is the provider?

22

effect of the any willing provider law has opened the door

23

to the provider, whereas in Rush and in Ward, it was the

24

insured himself or herself?

25

MR. ECCLES:

That is, the

That -- that's certainly a major

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

part of our distinction, Justice Ginsberg.
QUESTION:

2

Is -- is there anything more than

3

that that -- here, the patient is the indirect beneficiary

4

of opening the door to the provider.

5

it was the insured.

6

involved.

There -- there was no third party

It was just the insurer and the insured.
MR. ECCLES:

7

In those two cases,

The -- the patient, I would say, is

8

a potential beneficiary, but without rehashing that, those

9

two cases, a legal right was created for the insured.

In

10

Ward, the Court said that was a mandatory contract term

11

that had been added by using the notice-prejudice rule,

12

and Rush added the option of seeking external review and

13

those -- and described it as a legal right enforceable

14

against the HMO.

15

we believe that in order to be an insurance practice under

16

this Court's precedents, the practice must either affect

17

the spreading of risk, which any willing provider laws do

18

not do --

19
20

Here, there is no such legal right, and

QUESTION:

But that was not true, that was not

true in either --

21

MR. ECCLES:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. ECCLES:

That's right.

-- Ward or -Or, as in Ward and Rush Prudential,

24

must affect the legal rights of the insured.

The -- the

25

Court has used a formulation of that phrase in -- in many

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

of its Savings Clause decisions, including those two.
We -- we also think the Court has approached

3

this through a common sense inquiry.

4

the Savings Clause inquiry, and on a common sense basis,

5

nobody contends that the provider contracts themselves are

6

insurance contracts, and nobody contends that the

7

providers are part of the business of insurance.

8

Instead --

9

QUESTION:

That's how it begins

Yes, but nobody -- nobody can

10

seriously deny, on the common sense criterion, that a

11

person who gets HMO coverage -- whether it's subject to a

12

law like Kentucky's, is getting a far greater choice,

13

potentially and, I presume, actually, since you're here,

14

than a person who signs up for an HMO without the choice

15

guaranteed.

16

MR. ECCLES:

17

QUESTION:

But --

In a common sense way, someone is

18

getting a different kind of coverage, i.e., a breadth of

19

choice under the medical coverage, that otherwise wouldn't

20

be available.

21

MR. ECCLES:

I -- I think the common sense

22

approach can be viewed by looking at this Court's decision

23

in Royal Drug, and particularly if you look at the factual

24

parallels with this case.

25

If the Kentucky statute, the general any willing

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

provider statute can be disaggregated into a bunch of

2

separate statutes, each about a different provider, that

3

the term, provider, includes podiatrists, physicians,

4

optometrists, and pharmacists, so we have here effectively

5

one part of the statute is an any willing pharmacy

6

statute, that's functionally indistinguishable from the

7

statute that was before the case in Royal Drug.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, considered by itself, if -- if

you simply narrow to the provider subcategory of

10

pharmacists, I -- I assume you're right, but if you look

11

at the -- at the broad category that is covered by this

12

statute, there is one, I think, significant difference

13

between this and the -- and the limited pharmacy coverage

14

in Royal Drug.

15

coverage basically is -- is coverage for -- for benefits

16

that are fungible regardless of where you get them.

17

I think the difference is this.

Pharmacy

The super-aspirin, the industrial strength

18

Motrin is going to be the same no matter what drug store

19

you get it from.

20

is really important to patients to -- to choose a doctor

21

because of the personal relationship, and therefore, I

22

don't see the -- the precedential force of Royal Drug

23

in -- in a physician coverage; a -- a physician option

24

kind of case like this.

25

Medical coverage, however, is not.

MR. ECCLES:

But under the Kentucky law, the

QUESTION:

2

Well, the -- the patient, in fact,

3

is -- is given in practical terms a breadth of option.

4

It's true the patient can't force a doctor to sign up with

5

the HMO or force the HMO to take on a particular doctor,

6

but in practical terms, there are going to be more doctors

7

available under a Kentucky kind of regime, and in that

8

sense, the patient is given a breadth of options that

9

otherwise wouldn't be available.

That seems to me to be

10

important when one is selecting physician coverage in a

11

way that is not important when one is selecting drug store

12

coverage.

13

MR. ECCLES:

I -- I understand the point,

14

Justice Souter, although the -- the option and the -- the

15

preference don't match up perfectly.

16

broader range of options, they don't necessarily include a

17

doctor with whom the patient has a prior relationship.

QUESTION:

MR. ECCLES:

Even if there is a

Absolutely -- absolutely right.
But returning to the pharmacy, it's

20

true that the aspirin is all the same wherever you go, but

21

the -- the agreements at issue in Royal Drug, besides

22

giving the benefits of pure convenience, the ability to

23

get the drug at the corner drug store, which is not

24

nothing, also gave a very important financial advantage if

25

you -- if your pharmacy were participating, and --

Yes, but another difference is,

there -- there is an any willing provider law here.

There's no any willing provider law in Royal Drug.

That's correct, Your Honor, but the

8

effect that the agreements that were being regulated in

9

Blue -- with Blue Shield and Royal Drug, the Court held

10

were not part of insurance.

11

QUESTION:

Right.

12

MR. ECCLES:

And we have functionally the same

13

type of agreements here, an agreement between the HMO and

14

the pharmacy or other provider, and they also should not

15

be part of insurance.

16

17

I want to make this point, important potentially to the

18

patients, the insureds in Royal Drug, that -- that their

19

pharmacy became a -- a participating pharmacy.

20

inconsequential.
QUESTION:

21
22

They're -- they're outside the

It was not

You mean just as a matter of

convenience?
MR. ECCLES:

23

Besides convenience, Mr. Chief

24

Justice.

The example in the Court's opinion was taken

25

from the brief of the United States as amicus.

They

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

posited a 10-dollar drug at retail, and if you got it at a

2

participating pharmacy it cost $2, if you got it at a

3

nonparticipating pharmacy it cost 100 percent more, or $4.
Presumably those numbers are indexed since 1979

4
5

now, and -- and greater, but it was of great interest to

6

the insured whether the pharmacy was participating or not.

7

It made a large cost difference, and yet the Court said it

8

is not insurance in part because it was not affecting, was

9

not integral to, was not changing the legal rights of the

10

insured-insurer relationship.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. ECCLES:

13

QUESTION:

14

It's an antitrust case, then.
That's correct, Justice Breyer.

I would think maybe that makes a

difference.
MR. ECCLES:

15

That's argued in the briefs that

16

it -- that it makes a difference, and we understand it's

17

an antitrust case.

18

direct, factual parallel with the fact that Kentucky has

19

an any willing pharmacy statute, that Royal Drug is still

20

the correct analysis for -- it gives the correct analysis

21

as to the McCarran-Ferguson factors really for two

22

reasons.

23

consistently in its Savings Clause case -- cases.

24
25

We -- we still think besides the

One is, that's what this Court has applied

It -- it -- this Court said in the first Savings
Clause case, Metropolitan Life versus Massachusetts, that

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the Royal Drug analysis was directly relevant to the ERISA

2

Savings Clause, so it has the virtue of familiarity and

3

precedent, and the -- the standards, the McCarran factors

4

make sense here.

5

content to the subjective test, the common sense test.

6

They're objective factors that give some

But the -- the second piece of -- of the many

7

attacks that have been made on the -- the relevance of

8

Royal Drugs in the brief is, it -- it's argued in the

9

brief that this Court in Fabe took a broader view, looked

10

to a different clause of McCarran-Ferguson and said it's

11

broader, that insurance regulation can be a little

12

broader, and it's geared to protect the performance of the

13

contract, and we don't shy away from that.

14

willing provider laws have nothing to do with the

15

performance of the HMO policy here.

16

to that policy at all.

The any

They just do not add

17

It's argued in the briefs through hypothetical

18

examples that they are effectively Kentucky's regulation

19

of HMO's, the adequacy of the networks and so on, and we

20

are accused of wanting to undo all regulation of HMO's.

21

That's not our position here.

22

would preserve most of the State's regulation of HMO's,

23

but these laws are not laws that are substantive

24

regulation of insurance, the AWP laws.

25

adequacy laws.

The line we would draw

They are not

They are not continuity of care laws.

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Kentucky has laws like that on its books.

2

QUESTION:

How would you characterize them?

3

MR. ECCLES:

I would characterize them as a law

4

that gives a right to a provider and makes it difficult

5

for HMO's and ERISA plans, but gives nothing of

6

enforceable right to the insurers.

7

QUESTION:

Well, you -- you don't like the

8

label, insurance.

9

You said it's not an -- an insurance law --

10

Would you call it a health care law?

MR. ECCLES:

It -- it might be considered a

11

health care law, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct, and in

12

that case, it would not come within the Savings Clause,

13

but it's a law that regulates the contracts between the

14

providers and the HMO's.

15

Now, just to go back slightly over what I just

16

said, we are not here challenging the basic concept of

17

State regulation of HMO's.

18

drawn the line, and where we would urge that it continue

19

to draw the line, is to say that a law regulates insurance

20

if it affects risk-spreading, which this does not.

21

Where we think the Court has

The risk here is the risk of financial loss from

22

needing medical care.

ERISA actually has a helpful

23

definition that makes that clear.

24

employee welfare benefit plan, which is the kind of plan

25

we're dealing with here, is a plan that provides benefits

for medical, surgical, or hospital care, or benefits in

2

the event of sickness.
QUESTION:

3

That's the risk.

I -- I recognize that we have the

risk-spreading and the factors, and then we have the

common sense test -- we can all have tests floating around

MR. ECCLES:

8
9

It -- it seems to me that this just does regulate

But it regulates only the

noninsurance relationships, Justice Kennedy.

It -- it's

10

exactly what the Court held was not insurance in Royal

11

Drug.

12

they don't change the insurance relationship at all.

They're external to the insurance relationship, and

QUESTION:

13

How do you -- what about Metropolitan

14

Life?

What about -- you have a -- you have a contract the

15

State says -- I would have thought the harder thing, which

16

I don't think any more, is, is -- is an HMO an insurer.

17

We went over that in that other case, Rush, and it's quite

18

clear that 40 States regulate them as insurers, so we know

19

they're insurers.

20

Now, if any State tells an insurer,

21

Mr. Insurance Company, when you write that contract, you

22

have to put in it mental health benefits, isn't that --

23

that's part of the business of insurance, or not?

24
25

MR. ECCLES:

That's absolutely regulation of the

business of insurance, and that's --

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

All right.

Now, here what they're

2

saying is, you have to put in, use any physician benefits.

3

I mean, it's the same question.

4

MR. ECCLES:

5

QUESTION:

6

Well, what --

How do we -- how do you get out of

that?
MR. ECCLES:

7

Sure.

The distinction is, our test

8

is, effect the transfer of the risk, and in that case,

9

there is suddenly a new covered risk, the risk of needing

10

mental health care is covered by the policy and, if that's

11

not at issue, and the Court has had recent decisions where

12

it has not analyzed risk-spreading, found it unnecessary,

13

it's always looked at the second McCarran factor.

14

always considered, you know, whether the legal rights of

15

the insured are being regulated here, are being protected

16

by the State regulation in the insurer-insured

17

relationship, and in that mandated benefit case, they're

18

clearly getting a new legal right which they do not have

19

under any willing provider.
QUESTION:

20

It's

But you would not consider the -- the

21

benefit of having the selection among physicians as a

22

benefit?

23
24
25

MR. ECCLES:

That's -- in a colloquial sense, of

course, if all these things fall into play.
QUESTION:

So you say it's purely financial.

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

As

1

long as you pay the bills, that's the only thing the

2

insurance was intended to cover.

3

MR. ECCLES:

If all these eventualities fall

4

into place and you do have a broader choice, that's

5

obviously, in a colloquial sense, of some benefit, but

6

it's not what benefit means under, and insurance means

7

under the Court's Savings Clause process.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, of course, the -- the criteria,

the way we refer to that criterion under the McCarran-

10

Walter trio is -- is not in terms strictly of legal right,

11

though that will satisfy it.

12

to the policy relationship, and I suppose something can be

13

integral -- integral to the policy relationship even

14

though it is not expressed literally in terms of policy

15

language which grounds a conventional right.

16

MR. ECCLES:

We ask whether it's integral

That -- that's correct, Justice

17

Souter, it is phrased in terms of, integral to the

18

relationship.

19

factor in Pilot Life, in UNUM versus Ward, and Rush

20

Prudential, it's used terms, Rush Prudential, a legal

21

right to the insured enforceable against the HMO.

22
23

However, when the Court has described that

QUESTION:

No -- no question that that certainly

is a -- an example of something that is integral.

24

MR. ECCLES:

25

QUESTION:

Right.

But I would suppose that the

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

difference in -- in the kind of policy choices that we've

2

been talking about would be regarded as a -- by a

3

potential HMO subscriber as -- as integral to what he is

4

purchasing when he signs up with -- with one HMO rather

5

than another.
MR. ECCLES:

6

Our point -- in Pilot Life, the

7

Court described the second factor as not satisfied because

8

the, you know, the cause of action does not define the

9

terms of the relationship, and we would say, you know,

10

that has not -- does not occur, either, under any willing

11

provider.

12
13
14
15

If there are no further questions, I'd reserve
the balance of my time.

Ms. Johnson, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH A. JOHNSON

17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18
19
20

MS. JOHNSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As a matter of common sense, Kentucky's any

21

willing provider statutes regulate insurance because they

22

are solely directed at the insurance industry.

23

statutes apply only to Kentucky insurers issuing Kentucky

24

health benefit plans.

25

by the Commissioner of Insurance.

These

Petitioners are insurers regulated

Commissioner of Insurance.
These statutes are located in subtitle 17A of

QUESTION:

10

This is not

That's --

-- but here, wouldn't it have been --

11

suppose the law had been written to say that no doctor can

It would be the same thing, wouldn't

5

Commissioner does is therefore regulating insurance within

the meaning of this legislation.

MS. JOHNSON:

A doctor, a rule, a regulation of the

It seems to me that would accomplish the very same
Unlike some

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg,

but this Court has found that relevant to the inquiry, and

10

the fact that this is a insurance law that is only

11

directed toward those insurers regulated by the

12

Commissioner of Insurance is very important, and it is

13

relevant, and the fact that these statutes are in subtitle

14

17A of the Kentucky Insurance Code, which dictates the

15

benefits to be included in a Kentucky health benefit, and

16

the requirements for those insurers offering those plans.

17

The common sense test is also met because these

18

statutes regulate an insurance practice, and that practice

19

is the practice of insurers offering managed care plans to

20

contract with providers for the benefit of their insureds.

21

QUESTION:

I -- I would -- I would be

22

sympathetic to your case -- I -- I keep bumping up against

23

the Royal Drug case, where it seems to me all of the

24

practical things you say about this case could have been

25

said there.

The -- the contract really is -- is altered,

2

to go to a certain drugstore, under another situation he

3

has his choice of drugstores which may provide lower cost.

4

Even if it doesn't provide lower cost, it's a great

5

convenience to be able to go around the -- around the

6

corner, and yet we said that, you know, limiting the

7

number of drugstores with whom the insured could deal did

8

not affect the business of insurance.
MS. JOHNSON:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

Under one situation, he has

Your Honor, Royal --

How do you distinguish that from this

case?
MS. JOHNSON:

12

Your Honor, Royal Drug is both

factually and legally distinguishable from the present

14

case.

First of all -QUESTION:

16

about factually.

I know it is factually.

Tell me why it's legally

MS. JOHNSON:

I believe the --

MS. JOHNSON:

No, Your Honor.

I believe the

analysis in Royal Drug was -- was appropriate and -- and

accurate for an antitrust analysis as opposed to analysis

under the Savings Clause, which this Court has said -QUESTION:

You're saying that the McCarran-Ferguson criteria

MS. JOHNSON:

No, Your Honor, they are relevant,

15

as this Court has said, but they are not required, and in

16

this Court --

17

QUESTION:

They are relevant but not required?

18

MS. JOHNSON:

In this, in Metropolitan Life this

19

Court came up with a -- a broader test than the common

20

sense test, and that test is tested by the McCarran-

21

Ferguson factors that were developed in Royal Drug --

22

23

MS. JOHNSON:

24
25

They are relevant.
QUESTION:

-- but they are not required.

They're guideposts.
So the very -- the very factor that

I mean, that's what makes

antitrust different from ERISA, I think.

11

MS. JOHNSON:

12

QUESTION:

Right.

But -- but they both focus on the

13

very same factor, the provision of -- the ability of the

MS. JOHNSON:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- I'll tell you frankly what my

10

problem is.

I read the Sixth Circuit opinion, I said,

11

yes, that makes common sense, and I read Judge Kennedy's

dissenting opinion and said, yes, that's common sense,

too, so what --

QUESTION:

These -- these are rational judges on

both sides, they both made good arguments, and they both

conformed to some sense of what goes on in the real world,

18

so what is the common sense test?

19

(Laughter.)

20

MS. JOHNSON:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, it's a

21

very broad test, and I -- I think it -- it's looking at

22

the whole picture, and the fact that this law is focused

23

on regulated insurers, risk-bearing entities that are

24

under the control of Commissioner Miller, and it regulates

25

their insurance practices.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

20 years ago you might not have had the issue

2

where providers -- that insurers were contracting with

3

providers for the benefit of insurers, but that is a -- a

4

very prevalent practice in the insurance industry today,

5

and the State Departments of Insurance regulate that

6

practice, and in Kentucky it's heavily regulated.
On page 15 of my brief, I -- I set forth many

7
8

Kentucky statutes that regulate the insurer's relationship

with the health care provider for the benefit of the

10

insured.

These statutes were also set forth on page 2 of

11

the Solicitor General's brief.

12

in -- in the insurance industry today, and it's a heavily

13

regulated practice.

14

The --

15

QUESTION:

That is a common practice

Also, I guess if you were taking the

16

view that the language business of insurance could mean

17

different things for purposes of section 2(B) of McCarran-

18

Ferguson in here, you'd find support for that in Royal

19

Drug itself, isn't it, which said that maybe the meaning

20

of those words in 2(A) and 2(B), although they're the same

21

words, is different.

22

MS. JOHNSON:

It is different, and -- Your

23

Honor, and in Royal Drug was -- this Court made it clear

24

that they were trying to decide whether an insurer's

25

practice of entering into provider agreements was --

34
Alderson Reporting Company

constituted the, quote, business of insurance for the

2

purpose of meeting a very narrow exemption from the

3

antitrust liability.
QUESTION:

4

Well, it isn't only that.

I think

5

the statutory language refers to the regulation of the

6

business of insurance, and in the insurance case in Royal

7

Drug there was no official regulation, only private

8

regulation of the agreement, whereas in this case you have

9

public regulation, so it's conceivable that here you have

10

regulation of insurance, and there you don't count a

11

private agreement as the kind of regulation that the

12

statute's speaking about.
MS. JOHNSON:

13
14

in -QUESTION:

Yes, it is.

QUESTION:

(Laughter.)

MS. JOHNSON:

You can continue with your argument.

The McCarran-Ferguson factors are

22

also met.

As the Sixth Circuit noted, the second factor

23

is clearly met.

24

of the policy relationship between the insurer and the

25

insured.

These statutes regulate an integral part

In managed care plans, provider agreements are

2

essential.

3

certificates of coverage cannot exist independently from

4

the provider directory.

5

insurers from arbitrarily limiting the number of providers

6

that they contract with for the benefit of their insureds.

7

In managed care plans, and under Kentucky law,

These statutes simply prohibit

These statutes allow insureds greater access to

8

the health care provider of their choice, and I think this

9

is -- is clearly seen in KRS 304-17A-505(1)(k), which

10

requires the insurer to disclose that they are willing to

11

contract with any willing provider.

12

control to the insured in their relationship with their

13

health care provider, which is a very personal and unique

14

relationship.

15

QUESTION:

This simply puts more

Royal Drug says that the spreading of

16

risk is an indispensable characteristic of insurance.

17

then holds that the pharmacy agreements do not involve any

18

underwriting or spreading of risk.

19

two propositions as -- as true here as they were in Royal

20

Drug, that the spreading of risk is the essence of -- of

21

insurance, and that an agreement between the provider of

22

the goods or services and the insurance company is not

23

part of the spreading of risk?

MS. JOHNSON:

QUESTION:

Well, again, Justice Scalia --

And I don't like the, you know,

4

common sense test, I know it when I see it.

What I worry

5

about, the -- the common sense test is that we will

6

approve those things that we like, and disapprove those

things that we don't like.

8

antitrust arrangement that -- that limits choice, so you

just say, common sense, that's not the business of

I mean, who likes a private

10

insurance, and who doesn't like something that enables --

11

enables the insureds to -- to have a greater selection

12

in -- in doctors, so we say, common sense says, that is

13

the business of insurance.

14

I -- I don't trust common sense.

15

(Laughter.)

16

QUESTION:

I -- I want some rule of law that --

17

that I can adhere to.

18

and I -- I'm just not persuaded about why insurance is one

19

thing there, and it's something else here.

20

if, indeed, the spreading of risk is what insurance is

21

about, then --

22

MS. JOHNSON:

I thought we had one in Royal Drug,

I mean, if --

Your Honor, the Sixth Circuit did

find that Kentucky's any willing providers transfer or

24

spread policyholder risk.

MS. JOHNSON:

Justice O'Connor, when a -- when

an insurer sets up a managed care plan and structures

5

their benefits to be in a managed care plan, they have

tied in the network of providers to that benefit, and when

you have a statute on the books that allows the insured

MS. JOHNSON:

It -- Your Honor, it increases the

20

risk for the insurer that the insured will not have to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

9

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT
MR. FELDMAN:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Feldman, what would be an example

13

of a measure which did spread the risk, as that term was

14

referred to in Royal Drug?
MR. FELDMAN:

15

Well, I think one example would in

16

Metropolitan Life against Massachusetts, certainly I think

17

everybody -- I understand everybody here to agree that a

18

law that required an insurance policy to include insurance

19

against a particular risk would spread the risk, but I

20

think what -- in this case also comes right -- it spreads

21

the risk at least for purposes of -- of ERISA for this

22

reason.

23

of risk, the insurer is saying, we are going to spread the

24

risk so long as you go to an in-network provider, and the

25

State here is regulating that condition, and really it's

What this law is, is a condition on the spreading

1

analogous -- it has to do with the performance of the

2

risk-spreading.
QUESTION:

3

So, you're -- you're saying the first

4

McCarran-Ferguson factor includes a provision that

5

determines the way the insurer manages the risk, even

6

though it may not affect the risk as between the insurer

7

and the insured.
MR. FELDMAN:

8
9
10

I think it actually does -- it does affect that risk,
but I think it's a condition -QUESTION:

11
12

I think it does -- not quite.

No, but I thought that was the

argument you were making right then and there.
MR. FELDMAN:

13

It's a condition on the spreading

14

of risk, or a condition on the performance of the

15

insurance contract, and in the Fabe case, which was a

16

McCarran-Ferguson Act case, but involved a different

17

provision of the McCarran-Ferguson Act than at issue in

18

Royal Drug and the Pireno case that followed it --

19

QUESTION:

Well, how, as a practical matter,

20

does it affect the risk here?

21

increased for the insurance company under this law because

22

it -- under -- under the Kentucky law it has to pay for

23

24

that's an increase in the risk?

point?

Is the -- is the risk

MR. FELDMAN:

It would -- I guess -- for you --

2

it certainly could be -- I think semantically it could be

3

said to just increase the risk in just that way.

4

for me, I'm more -- it's more comfortable to talk about

5

a -- it removes a condition on the spreading of risk.

6

risk would be spread under -- without this law so long as

7

you go to a provider who the HMO has said we're going to

let into our network, whereas here --

The

That's what -- that was going to be
It seems to me that's the risk-

MR. FELDMAN:

12

I think

Right, and here the risk-spreading

13

is so long -- we're going to spread this -- such-and-such

14

a risk, but so long as you go to any willing provider, and

15

that's a different condition.

16

QUESTION:

But it doesn't spread the risk.

17

QUESTION:

It doesn't.

18

QUESTION:

I mean, it just doesn't, does it?

19

I mean, it's simply an ordinary -- it's -- what it's a

20

regulation of is, if the risk eventuates, the insurer has

21

to carry out his side of the bargain in this particular

22

way.

23

MR. FELDMAN:

24

QUESTION:

25

Right.

It's a regulation of the goods or

services that an insurer provides.

health condition of the patient that will be covered.
MR. FELDMAN:

5

Yes, but -- but it's really

6

exactly the same as what this Court faced in Fabe,

7

where --

8

QUESTION:

What's the name of the case?

9

MR. FELDMAN:

Department of Treasury against

10

Fabe.

11

statute about how to distribute the assets of an insurance

12

company after it has become insolvent, and it had nothing

13

to do with the contract as to what -- what risks the

14

insurer was going to insure, but what the Court said is,

15

it does have to do with the performance of that contract,

16

because if the assets are spread in a certain way, the

17

insurer will actually get paid -- the insured will

18

actually get paid if that risk results, and otherwise not.

In that case, what was at issue was a priority

MR. FELDMAN:

spread the risk, or why does it not spread the risk?
MR. FELDMAN:

2

It -- it operates as a condition

on the spreading of risk, because without this law,

QUESTION:

Well --

MR. FELDMAN:

-- the risk will -- it's -- the

7

insurance policy says we -- you -- we will spread this

risk among all our insurers.

9

and what this law does is, it alters what that condition

11

is.

12

QUESTION:

If you get ill, we're going

Which is to say, it doesn't spread

13

the risk, so if the other case means you have to have a

14

risk, then you lose.

15

MR. FELDMAN:

16

QUESTION:

Right, but the Court --

But it doesn't -- I thought that that

17

other case has -- since it involves the provision by an

18

insurer of goods and services, and a regulation of how,

19

when the risk eventuates, it is pretty similar, and so the

20

difference is, what they say in footnote 18, I guess,

21

which is probably what was going on here, which is that

22

we're interpreting not the McCarran Act's effort to allow

23

States to regulate insurance.

24

they call the secondary purpose, and that purpose was to

25

impose a narrow -- narrower limitation on the reach of the

MR. FELDMAN:

Right, and -- that is true, and

the Court repeated that in Royal Drug, and in Pireno, and

in Fabe, in all of those McCarran-Ferguson Act cases it

5

made exactly that point, and it --

9

QUESTION:

But is that the key distinction, or

is there another one, too?
MR. FELDMAN:

Well, I think that's the most

important one, but there's a number that are related.

In

10

the ERISA context, for example, the Court has added -- the

11

Court said, well, we first look as a matter of common

12

sense at the insurance policies.

13

are going to apply the McCarran-Ferguson Act to ERISA, and

14

it shouldn't be surprising that there are therefore some

15

differences between the two, or otherwise it would have

16

been unnecessary for the Court, as the primary test, to

17

look at the policy as a whole.

18

It didn't just say, we

Second, in the ERISA context, the Court has

19

specifically said that not all three factors are necessary

to be found in order to find that something regulates

insurance.

22

QUESTION:

This is all very sophisticated, but

23

I -- it just seems to me that what constitutes the --

24

insurance in one -- in one situation ought to constitute

25

insurance in another, and it --

2

QUESTION:

-- it's just common sense.

(Laughter.)

4

QUESTION:

And -- and what -- and what we're

5

doing when we -- when we deny it is -- is exercising

6

policy judgments about whether we think the -- the

7

particular thing that's been done is desirable or not

8

desirable.

9

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I don't -- I don't think

10

that's correct, and I -- I don't think it should be

11

surprising that there are some differences between ERISA

12

and the McCarran-Ferguson Act, not only because of the

13

policy differences, but there's a noted difference in

14

language between what -- the statute that the Court was

15

construing in Royal Drug and in Pireno, and with the one

16

it's construing here.

17

QUESTION:

So you don't think that the -- that

18

under ERISA it's important that what is regulated is the

19

business of insurance?

20

MR. FELDMAN:

21
22

Well, ERISA just says, regulate

insurance.
QUESTION:

I understand that, so you think it

could be other aspects of the insurance -- of the

MR. FELDMAN:

QUESTION:

No, but I --

I mean, once you depart from the

7

business of -- the business of insurance concept in the

8

McCarran-Ferguson line of cases, it seems to me, was

9

essential to make sense of it, and it's just as essential

10

to make sense of the ERISA prescription, it seems to me.

11

MR. FELDMAN:

I think it's because of the

12

difference in language that the Court from Metropolitan

13

Life on has adopted a different analysis in ERISA, and

14

there's actually two differences.

15

Drug and in Pireno, which involved the antitrust exemption

16

that has to be narrowly construed, you were just talking

17

about a -- a law that is -- that is in -- that is -- the

18

business of insurance.

One is that in Royal

19

In the Fabe case, which involved the other part

20

of McCarran-Ferguson, which saved State laws in the areas

21

of traditional, in the area of traditional State

22

regulation, it talks about regulating the business of

23

insurance.

24
25

In ERISA, you're now one step farther away,
because now it just says, regulate insurance, and I think

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

those laws are differently worded, and there's every

reason to give them a somewhat different scope.

in the Pireno case, for -- oh, the difference in language?

Of regulation of insurance versus

regulating the business of insurance?
MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I don't think the Court has

relied on that specific --

14

QUESTION:

No.

15

MR. FELDMAN:

-- language in any of its cases so

16

far, because in most of the cases everything has lined up

17

and it hasn't had to, but I will say that in the ERISA

18

cases, there's now a couple of them where the Court has

19

made clear that all three of the McCarran-Ferguson

20

actors -- factors don't have to be applied in ERISA, and

21

the Court has never reached that conclusion under the

22

antitrust exemption in the McCarran-Ferguson Act.

23

QUESTION:

Well, that would be ridiculous to

24

reach it, since the three factors are what the McCarran-

25

Ferguson Act is.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. FELDMAN:

Right, but by recognizing that

2

they -- that they're not all -- specifically holding that

3

they're not all necessary in ERISA, I think the Court

4

again recognized that there can be a divergence in --

5

between the two areas.

6

QUESTION:

And one reason, I suppose, is the

7

presumption against preemption which we are trying to

8

maintain in ERISA.

9

MR. FELDMAN:

That's right.

That's right.

10

And I -- I would like to add one other thing

11

about the -- what's been called the common sense test,

12

which is, I do think the Court has given substantial

13

content to it in its cases.

14

that homes in on the insurance industry, or is aimed at

15

the insurance industry.

16

codified it because, as the Court said in -- as recently

17

as Rush, I think, the term insurance acquires its

18

coloration and meaning from State law, State practice, and

19

State usage, because what Congress was trying to do was

20

preserve State law in an area of traditional State

21

authority, and therefore, the codification in the

22

Insurance Code is of relevance.

23

It talks about a regulation

It is relevant how the State

And finally, at the very least, a State law that

affects the contract between the insured and the insurer,

what is insurance may be broader than that, something that

3

does satisfy that I think clearly is insurance under

the -- the common sense -QUESTION:

5

That, although

Mr. Feldman, can I ask you a

6

question?

Do you suppose, if, in the Royal Drug

7

situation, there had been an insurance regulation that

8

required the insurance company to give the patient an

9

option between generic and nongeneric drugs, that that

10

would have been the regulation of the business of

11

insurance?
MR. FELDMAN:

12

I think it probably would have

been, and I -- I think that would, of course, have been

14

analyzed under the other half of the McCarran-Ferguson Act
