ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINE O. GREGOIRE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MS. GREGOIRE:

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. GREGOIRE:

12
13

Gregoire.

Gregoire.

Thank you.

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:
The question presented in this case is whether a

14

representative payee, appointed by the commissioner of

15

Social Security, violates the anti-alienation provision of

16

42 U.S.C., section 407(a), when it uses Social Security

17

benefits to pay for the beneficiary's current maintenance.

18
19

The plain text of section 407(a) answers this
question, and the answer is no.

20

Section 407(a) provides that benefits are not

21

subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or

22

other legal process.

23

compulsory legal process to obtain benefits.

24

department is appointed representative payee by the

25

commissioner, pursuant to 42 U.S.C., section 405(j), and

The department here does not use
Instead, the

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

as payee, the department is under the supervision of the

2

commissioner and uses the benefits to pay for the current

3

maintenance of the beneficiary in accordance with the

4

Social Security regulations.

5

In short, when looking at the statutes as a

6

whole, 407(a) does not prohibit that which is expressly

7

authorized by 405(j).

8

that Social Security benefits are available to pay the

9

beneficiary's current maintenance by preventing creditors

The purpose of 407(a) is to ensure

10

from taking those benefits.

11

in 407(a), is the means by which a court, agency, or

12

official authorized by -- by law compels compliance with

13

its demands.

14

Legal process, as referenced

It is compulsory legal process.

Here there is no legal process.

The

15

representative payee here stands in the shoes of the

16

beneficiary, sharing in the cost of care, consistent with

17

the Social Security regulations.

18

QUESTION:

Can a set-off ever be legal process?

19

Suppose there were a tax indebtedness by the beneficiary.

20

Could the State just under -- assuming that its set-off

21

principles allowed it, could the State simply take some of

22

the beneficiary's money from the Social Security and set

23

it off against the tax debt?

24
25

MS. GREGOIRE:

If -- the violation of 407(a)

comes in -- comes into play when there's a legal process

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that actually attaches to those Social Security benefits.

2
3

QUESTION:

So you would say there's no 407

violation in that event.

4

MS. GREGOIRE:

5

QUESTION:

Correct.

Although I presume there would be a

6

cause of action against the State for -- for not behaving

7

properly as the -- what -- what is the -- the --

Here there is full compliance with the Social

22
23

The questions that have been presented here by --

In this particular instance, the

It is

And why -- why is 405(j) not at issue

here?

24

MS. GREGOIRE:

25

QUESTION:

Well --

Because those points are raised, of

2

course, in the -- in your opponent's brief.
MS. GREGOIRE:

Yes, Your Honor, but if you -- if

3

you look at the complaint in this particular case by -- by

4

the respondent, if you look at the certification of the

5

class that's present here, if you look at the holding

6

below, in every instance the question presented is whether

7

a representative payee duly appointed can use the benefits

8

for the cost of care of the beneficiary.

9

plain text of 407(a) says the answer is there is no

10
11

We think the

violation whatsoever.
QUESTION:

General Gregoire, I'd like to just

12

find out if -- let's say we accept your argument this is

13

not a 407 case, and then the question is put, but there

14

are alleged misappropriations here.

15

some suggestion of double dipping and there's some other

16

things which may or may not be right.

17

there is such a thing as a right of any individual to go

18

after the representative payee.

19

something within the Social Security regs.

20

heard you say, oh, yes, but that's not a 407 claim.

21

would be a 405 claim.

22

such a thing apart from the administrative process.

23

there some right to sue eventually in court under 405?

24
25

MS. GREGOIRE:

For example, there's

I don't know that

I thought that was
I thought I

And I was not aware that there is

What the Social Security Act

provides is one of two things.

commissioner by the removal of the representative payee if

2

they have violated.

3

remedy, if -- even if done by a court, is back to the

4

commissioner to remove the representative payee and

5

appoint one that would act in -- in accordance with the

6

regulations.

It can be done by a court.

7

Here, while there are allegations --

assistance?

11

And who -- who can invoke the court's

The --

MS. GREGOIRE:

But the

An individual, the -- the

beneficiary could.

12

QUESTION:

The beneficiary can?

13

MS. GREGOIRE:

14

But here, all of those allegations, one, are not

Yes.

15

contained within the holding below, but most importantly,

16

there is no record to find any violation of 405(j) in this

17

case whatsoever.

18

has acted absolutely consistent with the Social --

To the contrary.

QUESTION:

19

May I ask you this question related

20

to that?

dissent, with the State court?

22

The department here

Do you agree with the position asserted in the

MS. GREGOIRE:

We -- we do not, Your Honor.

We

23

believe the -- the dissent is wrong on -- on two bases.

24

One, the -- the court below suggested that there was some

25

use of -- of benefits for past debt --

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Right.

2

MS. GREGOIRE:

-- when in fact there -- that is

3

not the case here and there is no finding to that effect

4

by the lower court.

5

QUESTION:

6
7

No finding.

Were there allegations

to that effect?
MS. GREGOIRE:

Only after the -- the remand

8

and -- and the supplemental brief that was submitted in

9

the State supreme court.

10

But there -- in this particular case, what

11

happens, by way of clarification, is when the State of

12

Washington gets a lump sum check for an individual whose

13

SSI, Social Security Title XVI application has been

14

pending, they will then use that check to pay current

15

maintenance for those months for which the child was

16

deemed eligible for SSI and was receiving foster care up

17

to a maximum of 6 months.

18

maintenance, not past maintenance.

19

concurring opinion was confused by that.

That is considered current
We think the -- the

20

Secondly, the concurring opinion says, you --

21

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

Why -- why do you say it

22

is considered current and not past?

23

decide 6 months is a reasonable currency criterion?

24

MS. GREGOIRE:

25

QUESTION:

You -- you just

No.

Or is it a regulation or what?

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. GREGOIRE:

It is.

It is, Your Honor.

2

Justice Scalia, what the Social Security regulations put

3

in place with respect to Title XVI benefits, SSI, that

4

anything beyond 6 months by Social Security itself is put

5

into an account and allowed to accumulate interest.

6

cannot be used for the current maintenance of the child.

It

And the second basis -- Justice Stevens, the

7
8

second basis that we think was wrong in -- in the

9

concurring opinion is where she finds that you have to

10

look at the extras for the child first, over and above

11

current maintenance, and that we submit to you is in --

12

contrary to the Federal regulations themselves, 20 C.F.R.

13

404.2040, which expressly provides that you look first to

14

the current maintenance.

15

both Title II and Title XVI, first to the current

16

maintenance, and then you guess -- within the broad

17

discretion accorded a representative payee, you may look

18

to see if there are extras to which those monies could be

19

spent.

That's the very purpose behind

20

Here, the Department of Social and Health

21

Services uses the benefits for both, and the record

22

verifies that.

23

But let me bring to the Court's attention what

24

we're talking about here.

We're talking about children

25

who arrive in the State's custody through a juvenile court

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

proceeding, having been abandoned, abused, or neglected.

2

They are subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile

3

court, and then those children are assessed by an

4

individual service plan as to what their needs are.

5

what happens when that assessment takes place is their

6

needs are being met by the department.

7

And

In fact, the average payment for foster care for

8

a SSI child is $1,776.

The average amount that an SSI

9

benefit would be is something short of $500.

And the base

10

foster care amount is something short of $500.

11

is the special needs of these children are being met so

12

their lives can be turned around, they can go back out and

13

be productive members of society --

14
15

QUESTION:

The fact

Well, I -- I think we're all

interested in the needs of the children.

16

In some cases, though, I take it that the --

17

that the Social Security payments are being applied to

18

reimburse the State for something the child would get for

19

free anyway.

20

MS. GREGOIRE:

We don't submit, Your Honor -- we

21

think that's wrong.

22

are getting foster care doesn't mean it's free.

23

the expectation of both Social Security --

24
25

QUESTION:

The fact that these children are -In fact,

Well, I mean free in the sense that

the State would pay for it anyway.

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. GREGOIRE:

Your Honor, there is an

2

expectation in State law and an expectation in the Social

3

Security Act that -- that what this money is to be used

4

for is the current maintenance of the child.

5

be the difference if we were to submit that it's free in

6

the home of a parent?

7

Washington State law -- absolutely is obligated to pay for

8

the child's care and maintenance.

9

that anytime a child in the home of a parent gets SSA or

10

SSI, it can't be used for current maintenance because the

11

parent has to use their own funds for that purpose?
QUESTION:

12

What would

A parent surely -- and under

Are we then to suggest

Well, but we're talking about the --

13

the State has a certain -- has assumed a certain

14

obligation and made certain payments.

15

the representative payee is someone other than the State,

16

the State is going to pay -- pay those benefits and -- and

17

the SSI will be available for other purposes.

18

it's not necessarily always in the best interest for the

19

child.

20

MS. GREGOIRE:

And in the event

So it's --

But, Justice Kennedy, that would

21

be -- that would be the case with a parent.

A parent is

22

obligated to pay for the current maintenance of the child.

23

Does that mean they can never use their SSA or SSI benefit

24

for the child for the current maintenance of the child?

25

We think not.

Consistent with the very purpose of the

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Social Security Act, is -- these monies are to ensure that

2

that child gets a minimum income to pay for their current

3

maintenance.

4

here than a parent would be treated.

5

The State shouldn't be treated any different

QUESTION:

General Gregoire, can I ask you about

6

the person who started all this?

As I understand it, the

7

-- the grandmother that the State was trying to displace

8

as representative payee refused to pay anything for the

9

child's current maintenance.

She was putting it away in a

10

kitty for the child's college education.

And I suppose

11

her theory was the State is going to pick up the tab

12

anyway, so I think the best use for these Social Security

13

benefits is to put them in a bank account so one day he

14

can go to college.

15

Is -- and I understand there were two attempts

16

to replace her because she was not spending the money on

17

current maintenance.

18

When the -- when the social service agency is

19

not the representative payee but a relative who doesn't

20

have custody is, is there any means of getting those

21

Social Security benefits used for the current maintenance?

22

MS. GREGOIRE:

Not by legal process, Justice

23

Ginsburg, which was a lesson learned by the grandmother,

24

Wanda Pierce, in this case.

25

attempted to get at the Social Security benefits by legal

The department wrongfully

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

process.

That's why there is no appeal of the specific

2

Danny Keffeler case.
QUESTION:

3

Why is it wrong?

I mean, this money

4

is there to pay for the child's care and maintenance.

5

the grandmother won't pay it, why couldn't the State go to

6

HHS and say, appoint us?

7

MS. GREGOIRE:

8

QUESTION:

9

MS. GREGOIRE:

If

Well, you --

Why wouldn't they do it?
You could.

The issue is a 405(j)

10

issue.

The issue is whether that person should be paying

11

for the current maintenance of the child.

12

QUESTION:

Why shouldn't they?

13

MS. GREGOIRE:

They should.

But what happened

14

in this particular case is Washington State has a specific

15

statutory provision that says if the child has a guardian,

16

the State cannot go in there and then ask to be

17

representative payee.

18

law.

19
20

QUESTION:

So there's a violation of State

Oh, I see.

So there's a

particular -- a particular State law --

21

MS. GREGOIRE:

Correct.

22

QUESTION:

23

MS. GREGOIRE:

24

QUESTION:

Okay.

25

QUESTION:

Is that the basis on which the ALJ

-- that stopped that.
Correct.
So --

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

ruled?

I thought that was within the Social Security

2

structure.
MS. GREGOIRE:

3

The ALJ in the case of Danny

4

Keffeler said that there was no finding that she had

5

wrongfully used the benefits, but went on to suggest at

6

the end that the State hadn't done anything like submit a

7

bill to her showing an expectation that she was

8

responsible to provide for the benefit and care of this

9

child.
QUESTION:

10
11

it?

That was -- that was a Federal -MS. GREGOIRE:

12
13

But that wasn't under State law, was

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.

The point being -QUESTION:

14

Then that's what creates the problem

15

because if you have a State law and the grandmother just

16

says, no, I'm not going to pay this money, which I would

17

have thought was earmarked for that purpose, pretty much,

18

and they won't do it, and then you say, okay, appoint us,

19

and the State says, no, we -- we cannot appoint ourselves,

20

and then you say to the grandmother, well, pay us, well,

21

then you really are a creditor in respect to that.
MS. GREGOIRE:

22

Well -- and specifically what

23

happened in the case of Danny Keffeler, when the State

24

attempted legal process against Wanda Pierce, that was

25

wrong.

That was a violation of 407(a) --

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

And you're in an anomalous situation,

2

aren't you?

I mean, here -- here you have -- if you -- if

3

you -- you're a creditor in respect to the grandmother who

4

won't pay.

5

There's going to be an anomaly no matter what you do.

6

You're a creditor in respect to the grandmother, so you

7

can't force the parents to pay.

8

HHS to appoint you because of the State law.

9

there you are in those instances where you did manage to

10

get yourself appointed, and you're now trying to reach a

11

different result than would be there in the other cases.

I -- I don't quite see how to work it out.

MS. GREGOIRE:

12

And you can't go and ask
And then

But Justice Breyer, the remedy is

13

the State could go to the Social Security Administration

14

and ask them to consider an alternative representative

15

payee for the child in this case because Wanda Pierce was

16

not providing for the current maintenance of the child as

17

we believe she should.

18

We believe --

QUESTION:

And she might have if she had to care

for the child.

if the child is in the custody of the representative

If she -- if the representative payee --

Under State law, we believe the

It's all

That's correct.

And under 405(j), when you go to the

Social Security Administration, its options are what?
MS. GREGOIRE:

To remove that individual as a

representative payee and appoint another.

QUESTION:

Put you in.

17

MS. GREGOIRE:

If -- unless we have a State law,

18

as I indicated in the specific case of Danny Keffeler,

19

would not allow us because she was named guardian.

20

correct, Your Honor.

With that, I would like to reserve my remaining
time for rebuttal.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

2

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

3
4
5

MS. MILLETT:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
There is no question that the use of Social

6

Security benefits to pay for current maintenance needs by

7

a beneficiary or by a parent as representative payee is

8

permitted under the Social Security Act.

9

reason that the identical use of funds would suddenly

There is no

10

become a prohibited alienation of Social Security benefits

11

just because it's done by a State as representative payee.

12

The anti-alienation provision of the Social Security Act

13

prohibits the use of judicial processes or similar

14

coercive processes to divert funds away from meeting the

15

needs of a beneficiary.

16

or the purpose of the anti-alienation provision that

17

supports the Washington Supreme Court's conclusion that it

18

prohibits particular types of payments and expenditures of

19

funds that the representative payee provision of the

20

statute specifically permits.

But there's nothing in the text

21

1939 and it has recognized and endorsed the practice of

6

all 50 States having foster care agencies doing this as

not violating the anti-alienation provision is, I think,

8

very important to keep in mind and that adopting the

definition of anti-alienation provision, using that to

police allegations of misuse under the representative

the system.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TERESA W. ROSEBOROUGH

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

9
10
11

Thank you very much.

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:
I think the Court's questions have hit on the

12

key issues here, and I'd like to point out what I believe

13

to be the errors in the State of Washington and the United

14

States' analysis in this case.

15

I agree with Ms. Millett that the Social

16

Security benefits that the State receives as

17

representative payee on behalf of these children indeed

18

belong to the children.

19

payee, the State essentially steps into their shoes to use

20

the benefits to serve their best interests.

21

And in its role as representative

The regulation-mandated transfer from a State

22

trust fund account, which is the account in which the

23

State deposits the children's funds when they are

24

received, to the State treasury occurs in the State of

25

Washington because of the operation of the State statute

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and two regulations, one superseding the other, that

2

mandate that the State shall use those benefits to

3

reimburse its previously advanced costs of care.

4

There's a singular exception in the regulations

5

that permits a State to advance costs of care to a Social

6

Security disability recipient and then later seek

7

reimbursement out of the paid disability benefits for that

8

care, and that is found at 42 U.S.C., section 1383(g)(1).

9

That provision specifically provides an exception to the

10

operation of section 407(a), and provides that where

11

appropriate agreements are in place between the State and

12

the commissioner of Social Security and between the State

13

and the individual, that a State may advance costs of care

14

in the period between the application for benefits and the

15

date on which benefits are received and then seek

16

reimbursement out of the Social Security funds for that

17

period of interim assistance.

18

Apart from that exception, the use of Social

19

Security benefits to reimburse previously advanced costs

20

of care or public assistance is the payment of a debt

21

within the meaning of the Social Security regulations.

22

QUESTION:

Ms. Roseborough, I want to make sure

23

that I understand what you're saying because it seems to

Whether or not the parent

21

could use this child's Social Security benefit check to

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

Not if they want to.

They

have the right -QUESTION:

They think it's the right thing to

do, and so they -- yes, they think it's -MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

They think it's in the best

interest of the child.
QUESTION:

Well, all right.

Let's -- let's

10

imagine that doing what you think is right for the child

11

is in the child's best interest.

12

right thing which is to pay the bills for food, shelter,

13

tuition, and whatever that the child ran up.

14

assuming that that's okay, why can't the State do exactly

15

the same thing?

16

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

And therefore you do the

Now,

The State can do exactly the

17

same thing as long as it applies the same test.

18

as it looks at whether or not the use of the benefits to

19

reimburse the debt is the --

QUESTION:

21

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

22
23

Okay.

As long

Now I got your point.
-- that is the best interest

of the child.
QUESTION:

Your point is neither the one nor the

1

And now my question would be they're the agency.

2

They know what Congress had in mind.

3

would say Congress had in mind pay these bills for food

4

and shelter, but they know it.

5

know their own regs, and they come in and tell you your

6

reading of this is totally wrong.

7

wanted guardians, whether they're States or not States, to

8

pay bills for food and shelter for this child who has no

9

parents.

All right.

They're the experts.

They

Of course, Congress

Now, they say, of course, they

10

wanted that.

11

clearly to the contrary.

12

response?

13

A naive reading

There's nothing in the statute that says

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

So they win.

Now, what's your

One, the Social Security

14

Administration has consistently, prior to its pleadings in

15

this case at least, made the exact same demarcation that

16

we are arguing here.

17

has said that once a benefit payment is received, you look

18

backwards at every debt that occurred prior to that date

19

and judge whether or not that debt can be paid on the

20

basis of whether or not the current and foreseeable needs

21

of the beneficiary have been met and whether or not it's

22

in the best interest of the beneficiary to pay that debt.

23

As to going forward --

24
25

QUESTION:

The Social Security Administration

Well, doesn't -- doesn't the statute

basically leave it to the commissioner to -- to evaluate

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

whether a representative payee is acting in the best

2

interest of the child?

3

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

4

QUESTION:

It does ask the --

And we have a representative of that

5

commissioner here before us today saying that under the

6

statutory and regulatory scheme, that payments such as

7

these for foster care are in the best interests of the

8

child.

10

Why should we strain to find otherwise -MS. ROSEBOROUGH:
QUESTION:

Because the --

-- and -- and upset what's going on

11

all across the country?

I think your position is

12

troubling for that reason.

13

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

If I may first respond that

14

factually it's not true that this is what's going on

15

throughout the country.

16

that we know about, through cases that have occurred in

17

the various States, illustrate that they take very

18

different or use very different procedures with respect to

19

the funds.

20

process that compels the State administrator to ignore

21

their obligation to evaluate the best interests of the

22

child at the time the benefit is received and instead make

23

a determination that all of the benefits should be used to

24

pay past debts to reimburse public assistance that was

25

expended without regard to the eligibility of the child

The facts of the various cases

And we only know of Washington that has a

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

for Social Security benefits.

2

QUESTION:

Well, the representative can be --

3

the representative can be removed if the representative is

4

misappropriating funds or misusing the representative's

5

position at responsibility.

6

with -- with the legal process provisions of 407.
MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

7

But that has nothing to do

It has to do with that in this

8

sense.

The State argues that section 407(a) doesn't apply

9

to it because it is acting properly as a representative

10

payee.

11

brief, and the State supreme court in fact held -- that

12

Washington was not acting as a properly regulated

13

representative payee within the meaning of section 405(j).

14

We contend -- and I think we demonstrate in our

QUESTION:

But that we're -- we're told by the

15

Government is none of the State court's business.

16

that question expressly to find out whether in the

17

Government's view 405 is something that any State court

18

could enforce, and the answer was no.

19

if you think the representative payee is not acting

20

properly, you go complain to the Social Security

21

Administration, and it's entirely a Federal law, not any

22

State court that interferes with the representative

23

payee's control.

24
25

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

I asked

405 is for -- if --

I -- I believe that her

response was that you could bring a State law action, for

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

example, for conversion against the representative payee

2

that failed to administer benefits in accordance with the

3

Social Security Act.

4

themselves provide that you cannot sue the administration

5

for a representative payee's failure to use the benefits

6

properly, but that you may be able to sue the

7

representative payee themselves.
QUESTION:

8
9
10
11

Those Social Security regulations

But -- but your answer to my 407

question talked about 405.

I don't -- I don't understand

that.
MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

407(a) clearly prevents a

12

State from using legal process like the administrative

13

regulations here to collect for past expenditures.

14

QUESTION:

15

this legal process?

Okay.

16

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

17

QUESTION:

Why -- why is this -- why is

It's legal process --

Why is it -- why is it something that

18

any representative payee, whether they're a State entity

19

or not, could not do?

20

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

Because Washington is not

21

making an evaluation that the payment of the debt to

22

itself is in the best interest of the child.

23

doing is acting pursuant to the compulsion of a regulatory

24

scheme that requires that the first use of the benefits be

25

to reimburse itself.

What it is

The Social Security regulations do

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

not state that the use of the benefits to pay current

3

But that's an odd term of the use

4

legal process, unless you're saying any set-off is legal

5

process.

6

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

7

QUESTION:

A set-off --

Suppose a private entity just sets

8

off an earlier debt against current funds.

9

that's not legal process in the ordinary sense of the

10

term.

That's --

It's a set-off.
MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

11

That would be depending on

12

whether they were doing so by operational law or because

13

of their own volition.

14

under what it contended below at least was the volition or

15

the -- the obligation of law.

16

gave it the right to secure or require the use of these

17

Social Security benefits to pay a specific obligation,

18

that specific obligation being the debt to the State that

19

arose when the State advanced funds for the child's care.
QUESTION:

20

Here the State is clearly acting

It was saying that the law

Well, you're saying that anytime the

21

law provides for action or provides that action will be

22

lawful, that taking that action involves resort to legal

23

process.

24
25

Is that your definition?
MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

I'm saying that anytime the

law allows or permits the securing of Social Security

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

benefits to the payment of a specific obligation, that

2

that is legal process or the application of legal process

3

to those benefits in violation of section 407(a).

4

QUESTION:

But the reasonable word in there I

5

think is securing.

All the State is doing is taking from

6

this account and putting into that account.

7

think all the State is doing is saying, under the law,

8

we're able to do that.

9

least it doesn't say we can't.

And -- and I

The law says we can do that, or at
And I think you're saying

10

that whenever the State claims legal authority, it is

11

using legal process within this statute.

12

isn't that your position?

13

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

14

QUESTION:

15

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

No.

Is -- is that --

My position is that --

Then I still haven't gotten it.
-- that when the State here

16

acts to transfer the benefits from the trust fund to the

17

State treasury coffers, it does so by presenting a bill,

18

in essence, a statement of account or a statement of

19

expenditures, to the trust fund unit reflecting the past

20

expenditures of the State on behalf of that child.

21

Essentially it's saying, I have advanced monies for the

22

care of this child and I now want to be paid back out of

23

the child's trust fund unit.

24

obligation of the State, wearing its hat as representative

25

payee of the child, is to make a determination at that

Fair enough.

But the

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

point whether that repayment would be in the best interest

2

of the child.

3

QUESTION:

Yes, but you have to go -- go on and

4

say what that -- why that's legal process.

5

grandmother does it, you would also have to say it is

6

legal process under your view because it's authorized by

7

the common law, I suppose, of the State or maybe by a

8

statutory law.

9

creditor can set off against an earlier debt money that

Suppose you have a statute that says a

10

the creditor receives.

11

in any usual sense of the term.

12

If the

That's not legal process in any --

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

Absolutely it would be, the

13

latter thing that you said, that if a State allowed -- if

14

a State statute allowed a set-off against a Social

15

Security benefit to pay a past debt, that would be a

16

violation of section 407(a).

17

provides that even if the United States itself seeks to

18

set off a debt like past due taxes against Social Security

19

benefits, that it has to have a specifically set out in

20

the statutes exception to section 407(a), and that in fact

21

is what exists.

22

reference to section 407(a) as required by section 407(b)

23

that the United States may set off past due taxes against

24

Social Security benefits.

25

In fact, Federal law

There's a statute that says by express

Absent that statutory authorization or exception

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to section 407(a), a set-off compelled by law or

2

authorized by law would be within the ambit of legal

3

process or an application of legal process to benefits

4

prohibited by section 407(a).

5

QUESTION:

Would -- would you say the same thing

6

if the State were simply funding the -- the cost of food

7

and clothing for the current month and on -- on Wednesday

8

it -- it paid a bill for groceries and on Thursday it

9

presented this document that allowed the transfer from the

10

trust fund to the -- to the State's account?

11

would be legal process?

12

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

13

QUESTION:

That too

That -- if it was doing so --

So the only way the State could do it

14

then, I take it on your theory, is to use the money to pay

15

in advance of its own expenditure a -- a fund from which

16

it then could draw under its separate hat to pay the

17

groceries.
MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

18

The presentation of the

19

grocery bill to the representative payee for payment may

20

-- and -- and the payment that comes as a result of that,

21

may not -- may or may not be legal process depending on

22

what it is that authorizes that transaction and whether or

23

not --

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, it -- it paid the grocery bill

on Wednesday, and Thursday it says, we're going to

Alderson Reporting Company

3

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

4

QUESTION:

5

That's

No, not necessarily.

What's the difference between

Wednesday and Thursday and February and March?
MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

6

Under my theory, it's clearly

7

a reimbursement.

And as a reimbursement, it then falls

8

under the regulations with respect to reimbursements.

9

QUESTION:

10

February and March?
MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

11
12

Why isn't it a reimbursement between

reimbursement.

That's exactly what we claim.

QUESTION:

13

It is absolutely a

Then -- then if -- if there's legal

14

process for the February/March transfer, there's legal

15

process for the Wednesday/Thursday transfer.
MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

16

It's the Wednesday/Thursday

17

process in the hands of a private representative payee not

18

acting under compulsion of law.

19

QUESTION:

20

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

21

QUESTION:

22

I'm -- I'm talking about the State.

I'm talking about what we've got

here.

23

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

QUESTION:

25

There's two --

Acting --

It's legal process when -- when we --

when we buy the groceries Wednesday and we make the

Right?

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

2

Then -- but the State of

3

Washington is doing that because it is compelled by

4

statutes and regulations that mandate that it shall use

5

those benefits to reimburse the foster care costs.

6

was not operating -- if it was making a choice --

7

QUESTION:

8

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

QUESTION:

10

That's true --- on Thursday --

That's true in either instance, isn't

it?

11

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

12

QUESTION:

13

If it

Not --

I mean, that's -- that's a wash, as

between February and March and Wednesday and Thursday.

14

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

15

QUESTION:

16

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

That is a wash.

Okay.
So the question is in both

17

instances on Thursday or a month later, is the use of

18

these benefits to pay for that which has been provided in

19

the past in the best interest of the child.

20

QUESTION:

Okay.

21

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

22

QUESTION:

Then it's -That --

-- then it's -- that's why I -- I

23

tried to lead to the conclusion -- let me try it again --

24

that the only way on your analysis to avoid the

25

implication of legal process would be to set aside funds

advance for payment for future groceries.

3

correct?

4

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

Is that

That would be the only way to

avoid a reimbursement scenario, would be to use the Social

child needs.

That would -- that would avoid the

QUESTION:

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:
many States do.

It takes that

That would

And that appears to be what

For example, it appears from the brief --

QUESTION:

Even though the check was supposed to

be for January and not for April.
MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

The check is -- the

21

eligibility of the check, if it's an SSA check, is

22

determined by the child survivorship through January.

23

that's why it's paid at the end of January.

24

25

which it is intended to be used.

to use the current checks that they get for next month

But so long as they re-gear up their system so

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

They will avoid violation --

avoid encroaching or violating section 407(a) --

10

QUESTION:

Does that make a lot of sense?

11

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

It does make a lot of sense

12

because the problems in Washington's administration with

13

accounts, we think, with double dipping, with use of the

14

benefits to pay administrative and programmatic costs

15

instead of to pay for items, food, clothing, shelter, and

16

special needs of the child, could not occur in a system

17

where the Federal benefits were used in the first instance

18

to pay for those things.

19

Moreover, in Washington --

20

QUESTION:

21

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

But why -- why --- the average payment to a

22

disabled child is less than the guaranteed minimum under

23

Federal law so that this child would at least be assured

24

of the use of the full amount of the Federal benefit to

25

which they are entitled without set-off by the State.

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

The

1

State could add to it but it cannot, as Washington does,

2

subtract from it.

3

QUESTION:

Instead of --

4

QUESTION:

Is it not true that -- that in the

5

overwhelming number of cases, the Federal benefit is not

6

nearly enough to cover the care of the child, that the --

7

the average SSI payment doesn't make it to cover the

8

monthly needs?
MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

9

Nor does the payment that the

10

State makes under its foster care program.

11

the case -- in the specific case of the State of

12

Washington, the guaranteed minimum payment under Federal

13

Social Security law to an SSI-eligible child averages $715

a month.

depending on the age of the child.

That means --

But now if we -- if we had the new

18

system now where you take the January check and you pay

19

for March or April with it, then the other things that

20

you're complaining about, the double dipping, what you

21

allege -- and they may say, no, it's not happening -- the

22

proper forum to determine that would be the Social

23

Security Administration.

24
25

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

Wouldn't it be?
In this case, the claim was

brought under State law against the State of Washington

fund the general foster care system.
QUESTION:

3

I asked you to answer that question.

4

Is -- what the Children's Defense Fund is saying is that

5

because Washington is doing what it is doing -- and it is

6

doing it because it's going to get -- it's going to get

7

the Federal Government to pay, as these benefits were

8

designed to pay, for the food, clothing, and shelter of

the child -- that there would be no one to do this and

10

there would be less money in the entire system.

11

that's the question I asked you to answer, not another

question.

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

We believe that States will

continue to serve as representative payees even if they're

compelled to administer the benefits in a way that is

16

consistent with the Social Security rules.

What's the basis for that belief?

18

MS. ROSEBOROUGH:

The basis for that belief is

19

that the State receives enormous benefit from having

expend those benefits in the best interest of the child

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINE O. GREGOIRE

17

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. GREGOIRE:

18

Where is the legal process in

19

this case?

There is in fact none.

The only thing that's

20

being suggested is reimbursement is the legal process.

21

the case of Title II benefits, an individual is eligible

22

in January.

23

That has to be construed as reimbursement.

24

interpretation would then turn the entire program on its

25

ear.

In

Social Security doesn't pay until February.
Counsel's

The fact of the matter is that is not legal process.

MS. GREGOIRE:

11

We would submit, Justice Kennedy,

12

if you look at Bennett and Philpott, what this Court found

13

in both those cases was legal process was actual in the

14

one case in implementation of a lawsuit; in the other

case, the actual attachment.

We have nothing of that nature here.

We are not paying the minimum.

We are,

children, Nacole Blimka, in one month, over $2,000.
In the case of another randomly selected child,

11

Denita Smith, in one month, over $3,000.

And yes, we held

12

the benefits, got no reimbursement whatsoever, to help

13

Denita Smith be reunited with her parent so that her

14

parent could set up a home, pay for the food and the

15

clothing and shelter that was necessary for that child.

16

The fact of the matter is the State of

Washington does exercise discretion which is accorded it,

broad discretion in the best interests of the child.
