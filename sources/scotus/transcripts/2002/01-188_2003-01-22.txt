ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Under 42 U.S.C. section 1396a, in subsection

12

(a)(19), which is found on page 244 of the joint appendix,

13

Congress made absolutely clear, as a singular precondition

14

of all Medicaid plans, that they must assure that care and

15

services will be provided in a manner consistent with

16

simplicity of administration and the best interests of the

17

recipients.

18

Medicaid recipients as pawns in its effort to reduce

19

health care costs for those individuals who are not

20

eligible for Medicaid.

21
22

This statute does not allow Maine to use

QUESTION:

Was this statute -- was the statute

discussed in the First Circuit opinion?

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

The Medicaid statute?

The -- the provision you just read.
Oh, absolutely, Mr. Chief

Justice.
QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, that -- that provision

3

is -- is in the portion of the statute dealing with the

4

approval of the State plan, a State plan has to have that

5

consequence.

6

recipients.

It has to serve the interest of the Medicaid

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

8

QUESTION:

9

That's true, Justice Scalia.

It doesn't say that each -- each --

each feature enacted by a State has to be judged

10

individually under that standard.

11

isn't it the case that if -- if a State adopts some

12

provision which does not comply with that provision, its

13

plan is no longer a conforming plan, and the Secretary has

14

explicit authority under the statute to -- to repeal the

15

Secretary's prior approval of the plan.

16

the way this thing should work?

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

It seems to me, why

Why isn't that

Well, the way this operates is

18

that this is not adopted as a part of the State's plan

19

that's subjected to review by the Secretary of HHS.

20

this is, is a completely separate program that's been

21

adopted independently, and all it does is reach out and

22

hold the recipients of Medicaid as hostages in order to

23

extract money from out-of-state manufacturers --

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

What

Yes, but do you --- but it's not a part of the

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

plan.
QUESTION:

-- but is it -- is it the case, if we

3

were to, let's suppose, affirm here, that the Health &

4

Human Services head could nonetheless call a halt to it

5

and say, you no longer conform with our understanding of

6

what's required, you're holding hostage our Medicaid

7

recipients and it's having a negative effect on them

8

because of the prior approval requirements of drugs that

9

otherwise wouldn't be required?

10
11

Is -- would -- would the

Secretary have that power?
MR. PHILLIPS:

I believe the Secretary might

12

have that power, although I would ask you to ask

13

Mr. Kneedler when -- when he's arguing.

14

QUESTION:

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

17
18

Well, I probably will.

But over and above that, that

doesn't -- but that's not an exclusive remedy, that's all.
QUESTION:

But how can the authorization

19

provision and the requirements attached to the

20

authorization provision, how can that conceivably not be

21

part of the State plan, as you say?

22

me it's central to the --

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

I mean, it seems to

Well, I mean --

-- there's an authorization --- there's a -- there's a

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

formalistic way of looking at it, which is that they have

2

a State plan, and this is not incorporated as part of the

3

State plan.

4

is to adopt a completely separate program which simply

5

reaches out, as I said before, and seeks to hold hostage

6

certain elements of it.

7

What this has been -- what has been done here

QUESTION:

But if you take that position, the

8

State plan could be rendered meaningless.

9

State plan simply becomes a kind of formal Open Sesame.

10
11
12

I mean, the

The -- there's got to be power to look, as
Justice Scalia suggests, or the State plan means nothing.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, no, there has to be a State

13

plan. The question is whether or not (a)(19) reflects

14

congressional intent that the State has to act in a

15

particular way.

16

question then is, are there multiple remedies available to

17

respond to it?

18

If it acts contrary to that way, the only

I think, Justice O'Connor, the answer to your

19

question is yes.

20

authority to go forward, although I would ask

21

Mr. Kneedler --

22

I think the Secretary does have that

QUESTION:

Can I ask this question:

Could the

23

State, if it just -- without adopting a Maine Rx program,

24

just decide, we want to take a good, hard look at every

25

sale of drugs that comes into our State, so we're going to

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

subject every drug manufacturer to prior approval pursuant

2

to 1396r-8(d), could they do that?
MR. PHILLIPS:

3

I -- there's an open question as

4

to whether they could do that.

5

most expansive reading of 1396r-8(d) you could make that

6

argument.

7

extent that that violates or interferes with the formulary

8

formulations that are embedded in the statute.

9

Certainly, if you take the

The alternative argument would be to what

QUESTION:

But if they do have that authority,

10

and you say that's an open question, doesn't it follow, a

11

fortiori, that they can do what they're doing here?

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, it doesn't follow a fortiori,

13

because what they're doing here is imposing the prior

14

authorization with respect to, you know, to serve purposes

15

that are completely unrelated to the Medicaid program.

16

QUESTION:

Well, maybe my hypothetical was

17

completely unrelated.

They just want to be sure you can

18

open the caps on the drug containers, or whatever it might

19

be, some idiocentric -- I don't think that the -- as I

20

read it, I don't see anything in that provision that says

21

it must serve a Medicaid purpose.

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think you'd have to read

23

that provision in the context of the entirety of the

24

provision providing for coverage of drugs, and I think you

25

have to do it in that context, and I think there are

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

broader issues there, but the singular problem here,

2

obviously, is that if you interpret the statute as broadly

3

as the State of Maine does to say that we can impose prior

4

authorization requirements, then what they can say is, we

5

want to extract money from manufacturers solely for the

6

purpose of building schools or roads or anything else that

7

we want to, and there's no restriction on that, and it

8

seems to me that if what you're saying is you want to have

9

prior authorization as a mechanism to deal within

10

Medicaid, to provide generally for a balance of interest

11

between Medicaid recipients, that's one thing.

12

But what -- what -- what Maine is doing is using

13

Medicaid recipients to further completely unrelated

14

purposes of the State, then it seems to me what you've

15

done is essentially ask the Federal Government to

16

subsidize a program that -- that's not an appropriate one

17

to subsidize.

18

QUESTION:

Okay, what about the halfway measure,

19

and the halfway measure has been described by the

20

Government as -- as some instances of prior approval that,

21

that it would authorize that go beyond what the -- the --

22

the -- the very strict enforcement of Medicaid in a

23

limited sense would require.

Do you think what the

24

Government has -- excuse me.

Do you think what the

25

Government has suggested

is also beyond the authorization

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of the statute?
MR. PHILLIPS:

2

I think it is.

I think the

3

better way to read the statute is to recognize that this

4

is designed to benefit Medicaid recipients, and the

5

problem is, once you get past programs that are designed

6

to benefit recipients themselves, it's very difficult to

7

see where you draw the line after that in terms of where

8

it goes.
QUESTION:

9

Well, is it correct that the

10

Secretary has approved a few plans in other States that do

11

go beyond, technically, the direct Medicaid recipients,

12

for instance, the people who are very close to the line

13

and might well become eligible soon?
MR. PHILLIPS:

14
15

correct.

Justice O'Connor, that is

They have approved those programs.

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

18

as we stand here --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

21

QUESTION:

Those programs are in litigation

Uh-huh.
-- as I stand here today, and --

Is that possible -- I mean, as I'm

22

seeing this at the moment, if the State uses the

23

authorization program for any purpose at all, we know that

24

some -- that some Medicaid recipients will be hurt.

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

9
Alderson Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

If a Medicaid recipient walks into a

2

drugstore and asks for drug X, that recipient can get it

3

more easily if it's not on this prior approval list than

4

if it is, and that being so, it must be impermissible

5

under Federal law, unless the object of the program

6

achieves a Medicaid-related purpose, so the question in

7

front of us is, does it?

8

Now, what's bothering me about that is that the

9

Secretary thinks some programs like Maine's are okay, and

10

others maybe not.

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

12

QUESTION:

Well --

So in my mind the words, primary

13

jurisdiction, suddenly flash red.

14

case without knowing what the Secretary thinks, and how

15

can -- I mean, after all, if the Secretary says this one

16

is okay, that would have a big leg up under Chevron, and

17

if the Secretary says no, it wouldn't, so why isn't the

18

correct principle primary jurisdiction, which we can apply

19

whether the parties like it or not, and why isn't the

20

correct result here to send it back to the district court

21

and say, district court, Maine cannot put this into effect

22

until they ask the Secretary about it?

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

How can I decide this

Well, I don't have any particular

24

problem with sending it back to the district court

25

enjoined subject to approval by the Secretary of HHS, I

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

mean, if that's the way the Court wanted to resolve this

2

case.
QUESTION:

3
4

want.

I want to have -QUESTION:

5

Well, I'm really -- that's not what I

Is that the way primary jurisdiction

6

works?

7

for getting the agency to pass upon the question, a

8

mechanism that the person who is dismissed from Federal

9

court is entitled to use, and I'm not sure that exists

10
11

I thought there has to be in place some mechanism

here.
MR. PHILLIPS:

I don't know, Justice Scalia,

12

that you need to be dismissing it from Federal court.

13

think it's quite possible for the --

14
15

QUESTION:

I

Well, even if you sit on it until

it's done --

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

17

QUESTION:

Right, stay your hand pending --

-- you still have to assure that

18

there's some -- some mechanism.

19

jurisdiction cases I know of, there -- there was a means

20

to file a case before the agency.

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

22
23
24
25

I mean, all the primary

Well, I don't disagree with that,

Justice Scalia.
QUESTION:

Well, I disagree with it, so we'll

have to work it out.
QUESTION:

You can't just send them off and say,

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you know, ask the Secretary, by the way, and have the

2

Secretary write us a letter.

3

done that.
MR. PHILLIPS:

4

I don't know that we've ever

Well, I'm not sure that there

5

isn't a mechanism for asking the -- to petition the

6

Secretary for review.

7

approval of this particular program, it certainly had it

8

available to do that.

9

course.

10

I think if Maine wanted to get

It didn't seek that particular

And Justice Breyer, I think it's important, in

11

the context of trying to figure out primary jurisdiction,

12

we know the views of the United States with respect to

13

this particular program.

14

Justice O'Connor identified, that come close to the line

15

where the Secretary would have a different view, and I

16

think it's appropriate in --

17

QUESTION:

Is their views the Secretary's view?

18

QUESTION:

That's what I --

19

QUESTION:

I'll -- fine, I'll ask them.

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

21
22

There may be other programs, as

I believe it is the Secretary's

view, but -QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, as I understand your

23

position, so long as it benefits Medicaid recipients, any

24

-- any authorization scheme is okay?

25

say, we'll authorize your drug if you pay $5 to each

I mean, a State can

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

Medicaid recipient?
MR. PHILLIPS:

That is not my position.

My

3

basic position is that the Court doesn't need to figure

4

out precisely what prior authorizations are permissible in

5

order to decide this case, because the one thing that

6

should be absolutely clear is, you cannot use this

7

mechanism in a Federal program in order to disadvantage

8

the primary recipients of that program without serving any

9

Medicaid, sort of, related purpose.

10

QUESTION:

You -- you -- you may be up in a --

11

in a later case arguing that the -- that the reasonable

12

reading of the authorization requirement is -- is to

13

assure the safety of the drug, or the necessity of the

14

drug for the particular illness?

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

That -- that's absolutely

16

correct, Justice Scalia.

17

would take that position, and that we -- that you cannot

18

read (d)(1) completely in isolation, and -- and to the

19

fullest extent of the language of that, without regard to

20

the rest of the provisions of (d)(1) through (d)(6), and

21

you -- and for sure, you cannot read them without regard

22

to the more fundamental requirement in subsection (a) and

23

(a)(19), that the primary consideration must be the

24

beneficiaries of this program.

25

We'd -- we -- I mean, I think we

They are the most needy people in our country,

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and the notion that you use them as a mechanism for trying

2

to simply lower health care costs for the Steven Kings of

3

the world strikes me as -- as an outrageous position for

4

the State of Maine to take.

5

QUESTION:

No, but they may not be doing that.

6

They may think that the object of this is to lower the

7

health care costs for the moderately poor not yet on

8

Medicaid, and thereby prevent people from falling into the

9

Medicaid category.

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Breyer, that would be a

11

persuasive argument if this statute had any kind of a

12

tailoring mechanism to it whatsoever.

13

residents who are otherwise not covered by --

It is open to all

14

QUESTION:

Maine says those are never caught --

15

QUESTION:

Administrative regulations, one of

16

the things that Maine said was, you've stopped us at the

17

threshold.

18

example, people who are covered by insurance will not have

19

access to this benefit, but on the question -- you said

20

would -- you would be content if the Court said, the

21

Secretary has to look at it, until then it's no good.

22

We could have regulations that say, for

Would you have -- this is the -- your lawsuit.

23

Could you have gone to the Secretary and say, said,

24

Secretary, we want you to look at this, the Secretary

25

says, I'm busy with a dozen other things and I don't want

14
Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

to look at it?
MR. PHILLIPS:

I don't know of any statutory

3

mechanism for a third party to come in and ask the

4

Secretary to review a State plan.

5

don't know that there's anything that prevents anyone from

6

sending a letter to the Secretary to ask him to take, to

7

undertake that.

8

about this particular scheme.

9

QUESTION:

I don't know that -- I

That said, the Secretary obviously knows

Yes, and the Secretary, you said that

10

the -- at least the SG supports your view that this --

11

that this program of Maine's is impermissible, but the SG

12

also told us, essentially, that this case wasn't ripe, so

13

we shouldn't have granted cert.

14

first position, that this is a -- we don't know what, in

15

fact, the Maine scheme is, because it was never -- it

16

never went into effect, because you got an injunction.

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

I mean, that was the SG's

But the one thing that we

18

absolutely know about the Maine scheme, and it -- Justice

19

Breyer described it, is that every Medicaid recipient is

20

placed at risk by the prior authorization scheme.

21

QUESTION:

Yes, but Mr. Phillips, are there any

22

findings that any Medicaid recipient has actually been

23

harmed by this program?

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

I -- this is a -Well, because there was a

joinder --

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

-- one of the things that bothers me,

2

I don't know that we have any findings by the district

3

court as to what the real impact will be.

4

your -- the Government says this is going to happen --

I know your --

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, if --

6

QUESTION: -- but if everybody agreed, for

7

example, to join the Maine program, maybe it may work out

8

fine.
MR. PHILLIPS:

9

The -- I don't have to go to the

10

United States.

The State of Maine concedes in its brief

11

at page 25, Maine Rx can be expected to trigger prior

12

authorization more often than previously.
QUESTION:

13

Yes, but it may well be that prior

14

authorization would, in turn, lead to some solution

15

between the drug companies and the State as to how this

16

will all be handled.

17

that it would trigger prior authorization necessarily

18

proves the conclusion that the Medicaid recipients will be

19

harmed.

I don't think the fact they agreed

It may well be true, but I'm just not sure --

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

QUESTION:

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

Well, but --

-- the record supports that -Well --

-- as of this stage of the case.
Well, but there'd be no way to

enjoin the program before going into effect, which means

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that you essentially have to wait until actual Medicaid

2

recipients are deprived of drugs in order to be able to

3

implement -- to stop a program that on its face does

4

nothing to benefit Medicaid beneficiaries, and clearly

5

poses a serious threat to them.
I -- if we go back to Hines v. Davidowitz

6
7

language, it talks about the full achievement of Congress'

8

objectives.
QUESTION:

9

But it only opposes the very threat

10

that the statute by its own terms authorizes.

11

threat.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

13

QUESTION:

Well, but it only authorizes --

The threat of prior approval which

14

the statute authorizes.

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

16

That's the

Sure.

It -- to serve Medicaid-

related purposes.

17

QUESTION:

But the statute doesn't say that.

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

I -- I understand that, Justice

19

Stevens, but the point is that if you read the statute,

20

and it's essentially six, those six words, to say that the

21

State has unlimited authority to do that, it strikes me as

22

inconceivable that Congress would have allowed this entire

23

mechanism to be available for the State to come in and

24

simply to raise revenue from out-of-State manufacturers.

25

There is no rational basis for that kind of a conclusion.

that's an appropriate way to proceed.

creates at least a serious question about what's going on

here.

Yes.

There's no question that

the reality of what's happening here is much more like the

The other thing I wondered about is,

if you've come over from Vermont or New York you can't

have the advantage of this.

6

necessarily in your interest to argue that it has to be

expanded to other States, but I -- it seems to me that

8

also was a questionable part of the program.

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

I suppose it's not

Well, I do think one of the real

10

problems with this program is that some States will adopt

11

this kind of a scheme and other States won't adopt this

12

kind of a scheme, which means that you're going to have

13

inherent discrimination with respect to consumers.

14

consumers will benefit to the detriment of other

15

consumers, and it does seem to me that -- that the theory

16

of West Lynn Creamery was designed to say that you don't

17

just look at the competitors and the relationships between

18

them, you have to look more broadly at the manufacturers,

19

the wholesalers, all the retailers, and all the way down

20

to the consumers, and if you have the kind of

discriminatory effects here where Maine seizes for itself

QUESTION:

3

-- one of the reasons the First

happening?
MR. PHILLIPS:

7

Well, that was part -- yes, to be

8

sure, Mr. Chief Justice, that's part of what they said.

9

On the other hand, if you accept our basic theory about

10

the clear discriminatory implication of the way the scheme

11

operates, that kind of an operation is per se invalid.

12

That's what the Court held in -- in West Lynn Creamery.
QUESTION:

13

But isn't the West Lynn Creamery

14

difficulty in your argument that here, unlike West Lynn,

15

there are no entities within the same category,

16

manufacturers, e.g., producers, for example, some of whom

17

are being discriminated in favor of others?

18

on here is not discrimination by the State within a given

19

class to benefit the members of the class within the

State.

21

fall on certain individuals in a manufacturing class who,

22

incidentally, are out of State, for the benefit of people

in a different class, that is, the consumers, who are in-

On the other hand, the point here is that there

are entities out there in the stream that are within

no significant argument to be made there, because Congress

has basically taken it over.

MR. PHILLIPS:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

3

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE

4

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Department of Health & Human Services has

7

articulated a position on two issues that are directly

8

relevant to this case, and those positions are set forth

9

in the letter to the State Medicaid directors that is set

10

forth in an appendix to our brief at page, I believe it's

11

page 45a it begins.

12

QUESTION:

The first of those -Well, does that lead to a conclusion

13

as to its view as to this program that we're considering?

14

Is it valid, or isn't it?

15
16

MR. KNEEDLER:

If I could -- there are two

problems --

17

QUESTION:

As far as the Secretary is concerned.

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

There are two problems with

19

the -- with the State program under this Medicaid

20

director's letter that the Secretary sent out.

21

is that it's the position of the department that a plan

22

such as this, which imposes a prior approval requirement

23

for Medicaid patients, if the drug manufacturer does not

24

pay rebates with respect to sales to non-Medicaid

25

patients, that sort of change is a material change in the

The first

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

State's plan which requires the approval of a plan

2

amendment.
There is a regulation that we cite in our brief

3
4

at page 28, and quote, that requires that, and that, by

5

the way, I think could be the -- the mechanism effectively

6

for a prior jurisdiction sort of approach.
QUESTION:

7

I see that, but I -- I mean, I'm a

8

little bit at sea.

I absolutely wouldn't call it primary

9

jurisdiction. The label doesn't matter, but the -- the --

10

but -- now, where I'm -- where I'm -- where I'm at sea is

11

in figuring out whether it's possible to say, and you

12

don't say this in your brief, that -- that a program like

13

Maine's, which is arguably, arguably wrong, or arguably

14

right, that it can't go into effect without the prior

15

approval of HHS.

16

up the approval statutes, a whole lot of things that

17

weren't briefed.

Now, that's going to require me to look

MR. KNEEDLER:

18

Well, it's -- the -- the -- we

19

have cited this regulation in our brief, and the -- and

20

under Allens v. Robbins the Secretary's, or the -- the

21

Secretary's interpretation's set forth in the brief.

22

also set forth in the Medicaid director's letter.
QUESTION:

23

It's

After the Secretary acted under it,

24

then.

What are you bothering us for?

If the Secretary

25

has power under this -- under this regulation to stop this

2

of the -- of the plan, and an amendment that hasn't been

approved, the -- the Secretary has the power to stop it.

Why -- you know, why --

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well --

6

QUESTION:

do we have to get involved?

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

--

Well, if I could just answer that

8

and then move to the second question, because I think it's

9

related, the regulation identifies what -- that material

10

changes in the plan have to be submitted for an amendment.

11

The Secretary's enforcement authority comes from a

12

different source, which is in 42 U.S.C. 1396c, which

13

allows the Secretary to cut off funds in whole or in part

14

if a State is operating under a plan that requires an

15

amendment because of those changes, so -- but I -QUESTION:

16
17
18

Well then, why doesn't the Secretary

do it?
MR. KNEEDLER:

I think it was -- it's entirely

19

reasonable -- first of all, that's a matter of enforcement

20

discretion under Heckler v. Cheney, and at least for the

21

time being, why this -- while this case is under -- is

22

under submission, the Secretary has not -- has not

23

proceeded.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, but I think the Secretary is

ignoring one serious problem, and I suspect it's behind

It's one thing for the Secretary to act within enforcement

power.

4

regs by, the statute by regulations that are subject to

5

Chevron deference, but if the Secretary does neither one

6

of those things, and from one side of the Secretary's

7

mouth we hear, well, yes, some prior approval beyond what

8

is strictly necessary for the direct benefit of Medicaid

9

recipients is okay, but this goes a little bit too far,

10

courts are then placed in the position of saying, well,

11

can we read the statute so precisely as to say that the

12

Secretary's position of what is okay is okay and, by going

13

this step further, there's a violation of the statute?

14

It's certainly in my mind.

It's one thing for the Secretary to interpret the

We are placed in a very difficult position, in

15

effect by the Secretary, by you, in being asked to draw a

16

line with a very fine pencil, whereas if the Secretary

17

wants to act under administrative authority, presumably

18

that's the end of it.

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, in going forward, I mean,

20

the Secretary issued this Medicaid director's letter in

21

September, after the Court had granted review --

MR. KNEEDLER:

-- because this was an area that

24

required attention.

25

that -- that States will submit their proposals to the

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Secretary as plan amendments --

2

QUESTION:

Well, is there some --

3

QUESTION:

And --

4

QUESTION:

Is there some mechanism by -- or

5

authority by which we could somehow refer this back to the

6

district court to seek some kind of information from the

7

Secretary?
MR. KNEEDLER:

8
9

it could proceed.
QUESTION:

10
11

Well, here's the way I think that

How -- how could we do it?

I don't

know of a doctrine but -MR. KNEEDLER:

12

I -- I think the procedural

13

posture of this case would allow that, and let me explain

14

why.

15

I wanted to also make sure I articulated, which was that

16

a -- that a proposed, or a plan such as this, which

17

provides for rebates for non-Medicaid patients, still must

18

serve some Medicaid purpose.

19

The Secretary's second position in this case, which

In the district court, when the district court

20

entered what is only a preliminary injunction at this

21

stage, at page 71 of the petition appendix, the district

22

court pointed out that the State had not argued that its

23

proposal served any Medicaid purpose.

24

injunction was entered, it was entered on that premise.

25

The court of appeals then speculated that perhaps it does

As the preliminary

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

serve a Medicaid purpose, but looking back at when the

2

preliminary injunction was entered, it was entered on the

3

premise that it served none, and we think, and the

4

Secretary believes that a plan must at least serve some

5

Medicaid purpose.
QUESTION:

6

But as I understand it, Mr. Kneedler,

7

it is -- it is at least theoretically possible that the

8

Secretary could approve this very plan.
MR. KNEEDLER:

9
10

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Right, of course.

It needs more

facts.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

The rationale adopted by

the district court was the rationale that some -QUESTION:

Yes.

It may have now advanced a

16

Medicaid-related purpose that may or may not be

17

sufficient.

18

The

rationale --

11
12

If -- on the proper showing.

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's -- but we believe that the

19

purpose that has been advanced does not save this statute.

20

The purpose that has been advanced and was identified by

21

the court of appeals was a purpose that some people who

22

were close to being Medicaid-eligible will be forced to

23

spend more on drugs, may become Medicaid-eligible, and

24

therefore cost the Medicaid program more money.

25

Medicaid-related purpose.

That's a

The problem is, the State

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

statute is not tailored to people who are close to the

2

poverty line.

3

QUESTION:

So is the procedure --

4

QUESTION:

Would you -- would you finish your

5

response to me --

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

Yes.

What --

-- to tell me -Yes.

-- what it is that you think we could

do?
MR. KNEEDLER:

If the Court reversed the court

12

of appeals decision, in effect affirmed the district

13

court's injunction, which was entered on the basis that

14

the plan serves no Medicaid-related purpose, the State

15

program would be enjoined.

16

At that point the State of Maine could submit

17

the program to the Secretary of Health & Human Services

18

along with any justifications for the plan, such as

19

those -- there are two additional ones that have been

20

raised in its brief in this Court for the first time, and

21

we think that's how it should play out.

22
23
24
25

This is a -- right now, the case presents a very
narrow issue on a preliminary injunction.
QUESTION:

Why couldn't that procedure be

followed by affirming, and saying there should be a

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

hearing in the district court on these very issues that

2

you're raising, and both sides would present the facts?
MR. KNEEDLER:

3

We don't think it would be a

4

hearing in the district court.

5

submitted to the Secretary, because a plan amendment is

6

required, but we do believe that -- that the petitioner

7

has made a sufficient showing based on the, on what the

8

district court said, that this plan, that Maine had

9

offered no justification, no Medicaid justification for

10
11

We believe it should be

the plan.
QUESTION:

Do you read the statutory

12

authorization for prior approval to mean prior approval

13

only if there's a Medicaid-related benefit?

14
15
16
17
18

MR. KNEEDLER:

We -- we do.

The legislative

history of the prior approval position -QUESTION:

You rely entirely on legislative

history for that?
MR. KNEEDLER:

No, and also there are two other

19

provisions of the act which we think are relevant, on the

20

one hand, a(19), which talks about the best interests of

21

the patients, but on the other hand, a(30) -- this is

22

1396a(30)(A), which says that a State plan must provide

23

for methods of payment that advance efficiency and economy

24

in the Medicaid program.

25

We think both of those speak to interests within

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the Medicaid program and require in the prior approval

process, as well as in the administration of the plan

generally, weighing the interests of the Medicaid

4

beneficiaries against the broader institutional interests

5

of the Medicaid program.

6

purpose requirement at all, then a State could impose a

7

prior approval requirement if the drug company contributes

8

money to the art museum or to the State highway program.

9

We think that under this Court's decision in Dublino, the

If there was no Medicaid-related

10

State must be pursuing a purpose in common with the

11

Federal Government, a Medicaid-related purpose.

12

what the scope --

13

QUESTION:

What --

Mr. Kneedler, it -- it was the

14

Government's first position that this Court ought to let

15

the case ripen, and now you -- you are necessarily taking

16

a position in this lawsuit because we granted cert, but

17

the Government made a pretty good argument essentially

18

that this case wasn't ripe.

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, ripe for this Court's

20

review, but we now -- we now believe that, given that the

21

director's letter that was sent out in September, that

22

there is a basis, there's an articulation of the

23

Secretary's position both on plan amendments and the

24

requirement of a Medicaid-related purpose that -- that

25

this Court could properly dispose of the case in the

1

narrow -- in the narrow way I suggested which, of course,

2

would also obviate any requirement to consider the

3

Commerce Clause question.
Things have evolved in the Secretary's

4
5

evaluation of this and, as Justice O'Connor, I think

6

pointed out, the Secretary has since approved a Michigan

7

plan amendment under this same general approach.

MR. HAGLER:

It's not what you're supposed to

to this Court through the brief of the Solicitor General.

15

The Medicaid statute provides a mechanism for the

Medicaid program in a fashion which violates the

provisions of the Medicaid statute.

The Secretary has not acted, other than speaking

MR. HAGLER:

It's an entirely different --

MR. HAGLER:

MR. HAGLER:

8

The question that this -- the first

question that this Court certified was, as described in

the Secretary's brief, is whether the Federal Medicaid

This goes too far.

We might as well

MR. HAGLER:

You can decide the preemption

preemption question is whether Congress intended to

prohibit what Maine has here done.
When Congress legislates against the backdrop of

12

the preemption doctrine and it give -- gave to the State

13

the discretion to subject to prior authorization any

Doesn't the Secretary have some

discretion in this area as to whether to say it's good or

If we can't, and if the

10

Secretary -- if Maine persists in wanting to run the

11

program, and the Secretary disapproves the program, then

12

his remedy is to withhold money from the State and -QUESTION:

13

But if-- if it's a freestanding

14

pro -- if it's a freestanding statute, not part of Maine's

15

Medicaid, how can the Secretary disapprove a freestanding

16

statute?

17

MR. HAGLER:

What he can do is look to the

18

effect of what happens once Maine Rx is implemented, and

19

look to the effect on the Medicaid beneficiaries as to

20

whether or not they'll be harmed.

21

QUESTION:

Well, the Secretary theoretically

22

could conclude already that to require prior approval for

23

every prescription drug will have negative effects on

24

Medicaid recipients who otherwise would not have to seek

25

prior approval, because there's quite a bit in the record

about the difficulty when prior approval must be obtained.
MR. HAGLER:

Oh, I submit there -- that

3

there's -- I disagree with respect to the record.

4

believe that there's very little in the record which

5

demonstrates that there will be any harm to Maine Rx

6

beneficiaries, harm to their health, once Maine Rx is

7

imposed, and should the State ultimately impose prior

8

authorizations under the Maine Rx statute.

9

I

You have lodging materials which are untested.

10

The fact of the matter is, if we were to return to the

11

district court we could demonstrate, based on a vigorous

12

use of prior authorization in the 2 years that have

13

intervened the granting of the injunction and today, that

14

we are imposing prior authorization and we are answering

15

the phone in less than 2 hours, and that Medicaid patients

are, in fact, not being harmed.

17

We -- our position is that to survive a facial

challenge the petitioner must demonstrate that any use of

QUESTION:

21

correctly described as a facial challenge.

You think of a

22

facial challenge more in terms of somebody who has a --

applications.

2

enough, since the thing had never gone into effect to

uphold the injunction.
MR. HAGLER:

4

No, and -- and what the First

5

implemented, and there are many ways of implementing the

program that not only will not cause harm to Medicaid

says that each Medicaid beneficiary shall pay an

2

additional tax of $50 a year.

3

to get rid of that law, which would certainly contravene

4

the -- the whole purpose of Medicaid.

5

rid of it is to go to the Secretary and say, since this

6

law is an amendment of the State's plan, you should

7

approve it, it requires your approval.

MR. HAGLER:

QUESTION:

13

MR. HAGLER:

14

You say that the only way

No, it's contrary to the statute.
Okay.
Medicaid beneficiaries can't be

required to pay more than a nominal co-pay.

15

QUESTION:

Okay, so --

16

MR. HAGLER:

17

QUESTION:

Congress thought -So the only remedy for something that

18

is contrary to the statute is not going through the

19

Secretary, that some things that are contrary to the

20

statute can be attacked directly, as is being done here.

21
22

MR. HAGLER:

from the text of the statute you can find an intent --

QUESTION:

MR. HAGLER:

25

But -- but I'm not convinced that

Okay. That's a different question.

prohibit this, and even if it were to -- Congress were to

prohibit using Maine Rx like prior authorizations for some

2

purpose wholly unrelated to health care, when you get

3

closer and closer to something approaching what the

4

Secretary in fact does approve of, how can a court set the

5

line?

The question really is -QUESTION:

6

That's the merits question, rather

7

than whether we have, you know, power to -- to move at

8

all, so long as the Secretary can handle the problem by

9

denying approval.
MR. HAGLER:

10

The Secretary has indicated that

11

he'll handle the problem, or he's expressed his views

12

about what the program is.

13

whether the -- I mean, the Court should allow the

14

Secretary to -QUESTION:

15

The Court should wait to see

Can I ask you this question:

I

16

thought you would agree that, if it were clear as a matter

17

of fact that this program was going to harm Medicaid

18

recipients, that we would have power to enjoin the

19

program?

20
21
22

MR. HAGLER:

Yes, but it's not -- I do agree

with that.
QUESTION:

So your argument, as I understand it,

23

it's an unresolved factual question whether, in fact,

24

these adverse consequences would follow?

25

MR. HAGLER:

That's correct.

We have -- there's

Alderson Reporting Company

1

no facts in the record, and -- and this -- this is a

2

facial challenge in which my colleague has to demonstrate

3

that they are in no way -- there's no possibility of

4

implementing the program in a way which doesn't cause harm

5

to --

6

QUESTION:

Well, I may not agree with that

7

statement, but at least they have to make a showing there

8

in fact will be an adverse effect.

9

MR. HAGLER:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. HAGLER:

Some showing.
Yes.
And the only showing that the

12

district court seized upon is this notion that, by

13

definition, prior authorization imposes some sort of

14

procedural impediment to free access to all drugs on

15

behalf of Medicaid patients, but the --

16

QUESTION:

I thought you -- I thought you had

17

acknowledged that the authorization requirement must not

18

merely not harm Medicaid recipients, but that the

19

authorization must serve the purpose of helping Medicaid

20

recipients. Don't -- don't -- don't you acknowledge that?

21

MR. HAGLER:

22

QUESTION:

Our -You were saying it does help them,

23

you know, and you're mentioning the ways in which it helps

Under the first test, the question should be, did Congress

intend to prohibit what Maine has here done?

question is, does the Maine Rx program advance the

purposes of Medicaid --

-- it assuredly does that.
But you don't think that's necessary?
I'm -- I'm not convinced that

that's necessary.

10

QUESTION:

Okay.

11

MR. HAGLER:

But even if it were necessary,

12

there's -- the -- the facts in the record, and the

13

reasonable expectation of how the program will work will

14

yield Medicaid cost savings both by imposing prior

15

authorization on drugs that are more expensive than their

16

therapeutic equivalents, and also by making Maine --

17

allowing people without insurance in the State of Maine to

18

purchase their prescription drugs and become less likely

19

to become disabled and financially eligible for Medicaid.

QUESTION:

21

anything published?

about how this would be implemented, was there?

Of the proposed regulations, is

MR. HAGLER:

Mr. Phillips, you have 3 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

20

Justice Stevens, I want to focus on the

21

narrowest basis on which this case can be decided, which

22

is, we have a preliminary injunction that was issued by

23

the district court.

24

on the basis of two bases, 1) the State has not put

25

forward any Medicaid-related purpose to be served by Maine

A preliminary injunction was issued

55
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Rx, and 2) that no matter how you want to define it, there

2

is an obstacle to the full achievement of the recipient's

3

primary interest of receiving medicine.

4

As I said, there's a clear debate as to exactly

5

the extent of the obstacle, but that there could be no

6

question that there is an obstacle, and it seems to me

7

that what this Court can do is simply say, those two

8

findings are not an abuse of discretion on the record in

9

this particular case, therefore there is a basis for

10
11

affirming.
If the Court wants to go further from that and

12

say, on remand, some guidance might be useful from the

13

Secretary of HHS and propose some mechanism by which to

14

have primary jurisdiction or some other mechanism devised

15

by which to obtain the review by the Secretary, I think

16

there's probably no problem with that and, as I said

17

before, I can't imagine that we would have any complaint

18

about that, but the importance of this is to -- is to

19

retain the injunction in place so that the unquestioned

20

harms that are going to happen are not allowed to take

21

place, and then try to undo them after the fact, which was

22

the reason for issuing the injunction.

23

QUESTION:

A brief question, I don't -- I'm

24

worried about your time, but is it inconceivable to say

25

that there was no showing at the time of the preliminary

56
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

injunction hearing but now they -- Maine says they can

2

make the showing that they should have made before.

3

Should the judge not listen to that?
MR. PHILLIPS:

4

Well, I think when you get past

5

the preliminary injunction and you move on to the

6

permanent injunction, if they think that they can show no

7

burden whatsoever, or if they think they can show that

8

there are greater purposes to be served, that's certainly

9

available to them.

But on an abuse of discretion standard

10

this Court ought to affirm that, and nothing that the

11

First Circuit said justifies taking any action in this

12

particular case.

13

If there are no other questions --
