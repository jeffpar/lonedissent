ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONNAL M. LACH

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MS. LACH:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The question today -- presented today turns on

12

whether Congress intended to include local governments

13

within the meaning of the False Claims Act's undefined

14

term, person, which this Court determined in Stevens has

15

remained unchanged since the original enactment in 1863.

16

The indications are that Congress did not subject local

17

governments to liability under the 1863 act,

18

As this Court observed in Stevens and in Hubbard

19

versus United States, the 1863 act was enacted as a

20

criminal statute.

21

imprisonment in addition to civil damages and forfeitures.

22

As this Court noted in Marcus v. Hess, any language that

23

the civil portion shares in common with the criminal

24

portion must be given careful scrutiny lest those not

25

intended are brought within the act's reach.

It imposed criminal fines or

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The word, persons, subject to liability, is

2

shared by both the civil and the criminal provisions of

3

the 1863 act, thus, a person that could be held liable

4

civilly must, under the 1863 act, necessarily be capable

5

of being subject to the criminal provision as well.

6

Court, in City of Newport, noted that municipal

7

corporations were not considered capable of doing a

8

criminal act or a malicious or willful wrong -- excuse me.
The -- the criminal nature of the statute in

9
10

itself is a strong indication that Congress did not

11

include local governments within the purview of the

12

statute.

13

QUESTION:

Ms. Lach, on that point, am I correct

14

in thinking that the Sherman Act does apply to

15

municipalities?

16

This

MS. LACH:

This Court determined that the -- the

17

antitrust statutes, under the antitrust statutes the term,

18

person, does include municipalities, local governments.

19

QUESTION:

And isn't it true that in the

20

original Sherman Act, imprisonment was authorized for

21

every person who violates the act?

22

MS. LACH:

That is true, but we are unaware of

23

any case in which a local government has been prosecuted

24

as a criminal.

25

QUESTION:

But the interpretation of the law on

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the civil side --

2

MS. LACH:

Yes.

3

QUESTION:

-- was not nullified because there

4

was a provision that said, every person is subject to

5

imprisonment.
MS. LACH:

6

That is correct, Your Honor, and this

7

Court in the City of Lafayette and City of Boulder, in

8

analyzing the term, person, and determining that

9

municipalities were included within that term, were also

10

faced with the treble damages of the -- of the Clayton

11

Act, and subsequent to those two decisions, Congress

12

enacted the Local Government Antitrust Act of 1984, in

13

which Congress specifically took local governments out of

14

the range of the treble damages, and now local governments

15

are subject to injunctive or declaratory relief.
QUESTION:

16

My -- my simple point is that by

17

putting a clearly penal provision in the statute, that did

18

not make municipalities out of the act, and I thought

19

that's what you were arguing, that the 1863 act is penal

20

in part --

21

MS. LACH:

Yes.

22

QUESTION:

-- and therefore, it could not have

23

in -- covered municipalities.

24

MS. LACH:

25

Yes, that is -- that is what we're

arguing.

3

QUESTION:

But that's not true of the Sherman

MS. LACH:

It does not appear to be true of the

Act.

4

Sherman Act, but again, we are not aware of any case in

5

which a local government was prosecuted under that act.

6
7
8
9

QUESTION:

Any more than this is a case of

prosecution.
MS. LACH:

Any more -- that's true, but now,

ever since 1878, the False Claims Act has been bifurcated.

10

The criminal provisions are separately codified from the

11

civil provisions.

12

Also, as this Court noted in Stevens in 1863,

13

the False Claims Act was enacted to combat fraud during

14

the Civil War by private contractors, and there is no

15

indication that in 1863 the Federal Government was buying

16

anything from local governments, or that there were any

17

Federal contracts with local governments, and without a

18

practice of Federal funding to local governments, Congress

19

would have no reason to envision a local government

20

submitting a false claim for payment, nor were local

21

governments firmly established as persons in 19 -- excuse

22

me, in 1863.

23

QUESTION:

Well, Ms. Lach, you don't dispute

24

that the word persons extends to some corporations under

25

the act, do you?

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. LACH:

Not at all.

Not at all, and in fact,

2

in -- in 1863, the term, person, presumptively included

3

private corporations, and there is language in the 1863

4

act, and given the context of the act, it is reasonable to

5

assume that private corporations were included in the

6

provisions.
QUESTION:

7

Well, but there -- there are also

8

cases from about that time that say that a -- a

9

municipality is included in the -- in the term,

10

corporation, at any rate.
MS. LACH:

11

The -- the cases at that time were --

12

came from State courts, and the State courts were not

13

consistent throughout -- throughout the Nation as to when

14

local governments could be held liable.

15

held they could be held liable in contract, others in

16

tort, and even when held liable in tort, there was

17

sometimes the distinction between proprietary and

18

governmental function.

19
20
21

Some State courts

QUESTION:

Well, what about Louisville and

MS. LACH:

Louisville and Letson, though, only

Letson?

22

applied to private corporations, and private corporations

23

were established by that 1844 case, but in -- this Court

24

did not extend that principle until the 1869 decision in

25

Cowles, and that was the first time --

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Didn't -- didn't we recognize it in

2

the Amity case in 1826?

3

in including municipal corporations as -- as persons.

4

MS. LACH:

We -- we quoted Sir Edward Cook

Yes, but still, in terms -- this

5

Court, in the Cowles decision in 1869, believed that it

6

still was not a settled issue and -- and settled the issue

7

once and for all.

8

not -- the issue that was before the Court that needed to

9

be decided, whether local governments were persons unlike

10
11

In the Amity case, it was not -- it was

in the Cowles case -QUESTION:

Oh, we -- we thought otherwise in --

12

in Monell, certainly.

13

it, the Letson principle in 1869 was automatically and

14

without discussion extended to municipal corporations.

15

MS. LACH:

We said in Monell, and I'm quoting

Yes, but by saying that, this Court

16

in Monell dated the presumption as firmly established as

17

of the 1869 Cowles decision, rather --

18
19

QUESTION:

So you think there was a -- a major

change between, when, 1863 and 1869?

20

MS. LACH:

I think that --

21

QUESTION:

In that 6-year period, there was

22

suddenly, whap, it applied to municipal corporations,

23

before that it didn't?

24
25

MS. LACH:

It seems to me most implausible.

Well, it doesn't -- it wasn't an

automatic or a dramatic change, but nonetheless, there was

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

a progression.

There was -- there was a transition in law

2

within the States.

3

QUESTION:

In 6 years?

4

MS. LACH:

Those 6 years, of all 6 years in this

5

country's history, of course, were the most significant,

6

but -- but in terms of dating a presumption that one can

7

firmly rely on, there is no firm date, other than 1869, in

8

which acts of Congress were determined to include person

9

as a -- include municipality within the word, person.
QUESTION:

10
11

Ms. Lach, the decision, the opinion

in Cowles was very brief, right?

12

MS. LACH:

Yes, it was.

13

QUESTION:

And it was sort of like, well, of

14

course.

15

been just taken for granted, don't you suppose the Court

16

would have engaged in a little more reasoning?

17

If this was establishing something that hadn't

MS. LACH:

Perhaps, but nonetheless the Court

18

did decide the issue, and made -- made it clear that for

19

once -- once and for all, this issue was being decided,

20

and it was at that point that no ambiguity was left.

21

The first case that ever -- that -- in which a

22

local government was ever brought before this Court was in

23

1861, in the Aspinwall case, and there the issue did not

24

arise, and subsequent to the 1863 act, yes, there were

25

other cases in which local governments were brought before

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

this Court, but the issue never arose.

2

1869 that we can firmly date when, in -- in Federal --

3

in -- in congressional enactments, we can presume that the

4

word person included local governments.

5

It wasn't until

And this Court in Monell observed that it took

6

years of judicial conflict before corporations of all

7

sorts, including municipal corporations, were established

8

as persons that could sue and be sued in Federal court.

9

QUESTION:

Ms. Lach --

10

QUESTION:

Well, if we think that it -- that the

11

word, person, includes municipal corporations, as, indeed,

12

I think I do, based on Cowles and Monell, then what

13

changed it in your view?

14

different view?

15

punitive damages, the treble damages provision?

16
17

Why would we now have a

Just because of the change in the

MS. LACH:

If this Court determines that the

word, person, in 1863 did, in fact --

18

QUESTION:

Yes.

19

MS. LACH:

-- include local government, that --

20

QUESTION:

Yes, on that assumption, then what

21
22

would change that?
MS. LACH:

The -- the -- what would change it is

23

Congress' imposition of treble damages, which this

24

Court has noted --

25

QUESTION:

But without an accompanying change in

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

the definition of person, right?
MS. LACH:

Exactly.

Exactly, and the 1986

3

amendments were just that.

4

was not changed in 1986 remained the same.

5

when Congress provided for treble damages, which this

6

Court has determined to be punitive, Congress knew what

7

this Court said in City of Newport.

8

a presumption that local governments are immune from the

9

imposition of punitive damages unless Congress

10
11

They were amendments.

What

Nonetheless,

This Court reiterated

specifically indicates otherwise.
QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me you would have a

12

better argument if you simply said, the 1983 change does

13

not impose punitive damages on local corporations, than to

14

say it suddenly proscribes an entire escape hatch from any

15

sort of liability at all.

16

MS. LACH:

Well, under the 1863 act, there were

17

only double damages, which this Court concluded were

18

remedial, and they were not punitive, but there was a big

19

step made in 18 -- 1986, when Congress changed the remedy

20

to mandatory treble damages and, in addition to that,

21

increased the statutory fines.

22

QUESTION:

But it didn't make it clear at that

23

time that the change made them punitive.

24

the Stevens opinion that we decided they were punitive.

25

MS. LACH:

It was only in

But there were indications prior to

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that that -- that -- from which Congress understood that

2

the damages were punitive.

3

Industries, a case that was cited in Stevens, stated that

4

treble damages are meant to punish, and also in 1981, in

5

City of Newport, this Court cited an 1877 a Missouri

6

supreme court case that held that a municipality was not

7

subject to treble damages under a trespass statute,

8

notwithstanding that statute's general authorization for

9

such damages against any person, and the reason was,

10

In 1981, this Court, in Texas

treble damages were exemplary, and -QUESTION:

11

Ms. Lach, didn't the Court also,

12

I think in the context of the Clayton Act, characterize

13

treble damages as, quote, remedial?
MS. LACH:

14

The Court -- the Court noted both.

15

The Court said in -- in aspect, they are remedial, but

16

then, also they did have an intent to punish as well, but

17

as I stated, the -- the Clayton Act no longer applies to

18

local governments because Congress took affirmative

19

steps --

20

QUESTION:

Nonetheless, it used the word,

21

remedial to characterize treble damages, and one of the

22

difficulties that your -- your argument that you're now

23

making encounters is that this change in 1986, wasn't it a

24

dramatic expansion of qui tam liability?

25

MS. LACH:

It was a dramatic expansion, but as

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

this Court -QUESTION:

And then -- then you think that at

3

the same time that Congress expanded it, it also cut back,

4

without any indication at all?

5

MS. LACH:

Well, we believe that Congress did

6

not cut back, that -- that local governments were never

7

subject to the act, but with this dramatic expansion,

8

there was also the dramatic increase in damages, and this

9

Court has made it clear that local governments have an

10

affirmative defense when punitive damages are at stake,

11

and in order to abrogate that immunity from punitive

12

damages, Congress has got to really say that it intends to

13

impose those punitive damages, treble damages in this

14

case, treble damages plus statutory fines in this case on

15

local governments, and there's no indication anywhere on

16

the face of the 1986 amendments that Congress intended to

17

impose such damages on local governments.

18

Local governments are mentioned twice in the

19

1986 amendments.

In one provision, it's the

20

jurisdictional provision, 3732(b), which allows local

21

governments and States to bring State court claims in

22

Federal court when -- when the transaction arises from the

23

same transaction as a False Claims Act action.

24

indicates that Congress was interested in -- in preventing

25

frauds against local governments, not in -- in imposing

That

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

punitive damages on local governments, and the other

2

provision is the CID provision which, as this Court noted

3

in Stevens, has a -- has a definition.

4

includes States and political subdivisions of States, but

5

that is for the purpose of investigation --

6

QUESTION:

That definition

I'm -- I'm sorry, I didn't fully

7

grasp the point you were just making.

Were you suggesting

8

that Congress was worried about fraud against

9

municipalities, but it didn't think that fraud would be

10

engaged in by municipal units?

11

from New York, and I remember Tammany Hall.

12

it was altogether so different in Cook County, was it?

13

(Laughter.)

14

MS. LACH:

I mean, I remember -- I'm
I don't think

But the -- but the point is that

15

where local governments are mentioned in the -- in the

16

False Claims Act in the 1986 amendment, there is no

17

indication that Congress was mentioning them because

18

Congress was intending to abrogate the immunity from

19

punitive damages.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

May I ask whether you think that Cook

County could bring a qui tam action?
MS. LACH:

Well, that's less clear under the

23

False Claims Act.

This Court -- I -- I know that Your

24

Honor, in the dissenting opinion, suggested that the term,

25

person, is different in 30 -- 3730(b) from 3730(a).

It's

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

less clear, I think, perhaps, but that was an issue that

2

this Court expressly declined to address in Stevens

3

because there was no need to discuss it or to decide it at

4

that point.

5

QUESTION:

6

decide it here.

7

position on it.

8
9
10

And there's no -- there's no need to

I -- I was just curious if you did have a

MS. LACH:

I think perhaps local governments

could bring qui tam actions, but -- but it is not clear.
There are also the -- the policy considerations

11

with respect to the imposition of punitive damages on

12

local governments.

13

Federal funds for the benefit of their residents and, as

14

this Court noted in Stevens, in City of Newport, the Court

15

was concerned with the imposition of punitive damages on

16

local taxpayers under any circumstances, and here we have

17

a statute that imposes three times the amount of damages

18

and imposes statutory fines, which get very hefty.

Local governments apply for and use

19

Punitive damages against a local government have

20

got to come from someplace, and there are only two places,

21

reduction in services, or an increase in taxes, and the

22

victims of punitive damages are not the wrongdoers.

23

They're -- they're the innocent, and some of those

24

innocents are not even taxpayers or voters, such as

25

schoolchildren or homeless medically indigent.

1

The United States significantly -- significantly

2

has other means to stop fraud by local governments, and to

3

deter local governments from committing fraud.

4

States has common law causes of action to be made whole,

5

and the most effective deterrent is the threat of

6

debarment from participation in Federal funding.

The United

With no indication that Congress ever intended

7
8

to include local governments in the -- in the 1863 act,

9

and with the Dictionary Act not being enacted until 1871,

10

where Congress for the first time created a statutory

11

presumption that the word, person, includes bodies politic

12

and corporate, this case is in a very different posture

13

from the Monell case.
In Monell, this Court did not just look at the

14
15

word, person.

16

environment in which section 1983 was enacted, it looked

17

at the legislative history, and it also looked at the

18

Dictionary Act, which was enacted just 2 months prior with

19

the same -- by the same Congress that enacted section

20

1983.

21

This Court looked at the historical

24

presumption.

25

but does that lead -- does that add up to a presumption?

There was no concrete

There were -- there were indications, yes,

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

There's no concrete presumption until this Court said so

2

in Cowles in 1869, and then we have Congress in 1871.

There were changes.

at that point in time.
If there are no further questions, I'll reserve

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDSON H. MINER

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MINER:

12
13

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
I really can't contribute much more to the

14
15

discussion of what Congress meant by a person in

16

section -- in 1863, other than to point out, as we did in

17

our brief, that in fact, the law in the States prior to

18

Letson -- and -- and indeed, Letson is the origin of

19

the -- of the doctrine, because in Letson, what the Court

20

actually said was, a corporation is a natural person for

21

purposes of the suit where it's incorporated or where it

22

does business, and the Court then goes on and says, and

23

that doctrine also applies to all corporations and body

24

politic.

Before that, they looked at the

MR. MINER:

The -- that's right.

They -- they

defined corporations by the -- by the members, and -- and

5

they could have jurisdictions all over.

7

of the States as we -- that we could find.

8

dissenting opinions that -- that held, that didn't hold

9

that a local government, whether it was a corporation,

10

whether it was a quasi corporation, a city, a county,

11

wasn't held responsible for any obligations it had,

12

whether by contract, whether by charter, whether --

13

whether by statute, wherever they came from, and they were

14

also responsible for all their wrongful torts.

That then gets

We found no

So that then brings us to really what was

15
16

Ms. Lach's starting point, this whole question of the

17

implications of the criminal provisions and, in fact, not

18

only the Sherman Act, but the Elkins Act also includes

19

criminal provisions, and this Court has recognized that

20

person, in that act, includes municipal corporations, but

21

the -- the question of what is the significance of

22

including criminal penalties in 1863 has to be answered in

23

the context of what was -- what was the -- the view in

24

1863.

25

Unfortunately, this argument really doesn't

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

surface until the reply, and so we haven't had a chance

2

really to brief it, but the simple reality is, in -- in

3

the period of 18 -- in the era of 1863, indeed in the 19th

4

Century, local governments were treated just like private

5

corporations, and they were, indeed, subject to

6

indictment, and they were subject to criminal punishment

7

on the same terms as local governments, and they were

8

often found liable for acts that involved both fraud and

9

deceit.

10

Since -- since this was -- now, I'd like to read

11

to the Court from Dillon, who is cited repeatedly as -- as

12

one of the -- the scholars of the era, although we -- we

13

have not cited this passage because the issue hadn't come

14

up before, but in his treatise on the law of municipal

15

corporations he states, English law, and in this

16

country -- in the English law and in this country, quote,

17

all corporations, municipal as well as private, which owe

18

duties to the public are liable to indictment for

19

malfeasance as well as nonfeasance in respect to their

20

duties.

21

responsible for palpable omissions, they're responsible

22

for willful and corrupt acts, and in a -- a leading case

23

at the turn of the century called Ludlow versus

24

Commonwealth, 56 S.W. 2d 958, the State supreme court made

25

clear that the purpose of holding cities liable criminally

And, in fact, he goes on to explain that they're

Alderson Reporting Company

2

was, indeed, to punish them and to deter future acts.
That really was the law and, in fact, in a

3

leading case from our own State, the Illinois supreme

4

court, in upholding a criminal conviction against the City

5

of Chicago for employing women for more than 10 hours,

6

states in the case of People versus City of Chicago,

7

100 N.E. 194, the municipality is held to the same degree

8

of responsibility as an individual.

9

In securing performance of specific duties

10

imposed upon municipal corporations, the State has the

11

same power of coercion and the same method of redress in

12

the case of individuals or purely private corporations.

13

That was the law in that era.

14

False Claims Act was passed and, in a battery of cases

15

which I can bring to this Court's attention, a case called

16

Howard versus Crawford County, 12 F cases 637, Chaplain

17

versus The Corporations of the City of New York, 3 Paige,

18

P-a-i-g-e, Chapter 573, or the Town of Plymouth versus the

19

Town of Windsor, 7 Vermont 325, all cases that predate the

20

1863 False Claims Act, local governments were sued in

21

lawsuits for fraudulent and deceitful conduct usually

22

involving bond issues, or trying to avoid bond

23

obligations, often in terms of their responsibilities to

24

take care of their indigent citizens, and they would then

25

engage in schemes to get their indigents into another

for the wrong, sometimes they in fact had paid, gotten

3

4

Well, the fact that local governments

5

were sued in these cases under some sort of common law

6

theory, I take it, does not necessarily answer the

7

question of whether statutory language using the word,

8

person includes them.
MR. MINER:

9

Oh, I'm simply using these as

10

examples.

I understand it's part of the argument that was

11

made in the reply briefs by my opponent that local

12

government simply cannot have the mental state of showing

13

either fraud or intent to deceive, and -- and my point is

14

simply, it was not uncommon in those days for local

15

governments to be perceived as doing fraudulent or

16

deceitful acts.
QUESTION:

17

Well, I'm sure that's true, but

18

why -- why do you -- why is it that, in your opinion,

19

nobody apparently with -- just, perhaps no exceptions, or

20

one or two, has ever sued a local government before under

21

this act?

not until the 1940s that money starts -QUESTION:

4

Since 1986, that's already 16 years,

Federal programs that go to cities, and --

MR. MINER:

8

QUESTION:

9

Well -I imagine somewhere in those billions

there are a few false statements being made by people.

10

(Laughter.)

11

MR. MINER:

But I think the answer is that the

12

money doesn't start coming in until 19 -- until the 1940s

13

and thereafter, and in -- in 1943, after this Court's

14

decision in Hess, the False Claims Act gets emasculated,

15

in the sense that it becomes very difficult to bring false

16

claims, particularly qui tam cases.

17

substantially reduced, and there is dramatic fall-off in

18

false claims litigation, and that's the whole purpose of

19

the 1986 amendments, to generate new life into it -QUESTION:

21

Why since 1986 have we seen virtually

no suits brought against municipalities?

QUESTION:

Against 19 -- against municipalities?

2

MR. MINER:

3

QUESTION:

Oh, sure.
See, what I'm worried about in the

4

back of my mind is, if the -- assuming that the history in

5

the 1860s is fairly inconclusive, which is the impression

6

the briefs have left me with, you can make a good argument

7

one way or the other, then I'd be worried about suddenly

8

unleashing potentially billions of dollars of liability as

9

lawyers comb through the vast number of Federal programs

10

that give aid to cities, looking for someone, somewhere,

11

who has made a false statement, and I'm sure there are

12

quite a few, at -- at which point the cities would

13

suddenly discover vast liability for treble damages that

14

their -- their citizens can't avoid.

15

share in a city, and -- and so that's the kind of thing

16

that worries me practically, and I wish you'd talk about

17

it a little.

23

is clear, you win.

absolutely uncertain about what the right result is on the

Alderson Reporting Company

1

it's relevant, to have in my mind what's likely to occur

2

in the year 2003.

3

MR. MINER:

Oh, I -- I think what is going to --

4

first of all, let's understand that these cases are not

5

now brought on the basis of negligent statements, or

6

slight misrepresentations, but these cases involve -- this

7

is a statute unlike section 1983 or the Sherman Act, that

8

really does not involve itself in imposing any new

9

obligations, any new or unanticipated responsibilities on

10
11

local governments.
It merely says, when you entered into a contract

12

with us, we're going to hold you to the deal that you

13

made, and if you breach that deal in material ways, we're

14

going to try to get our money back, so there is -- there

15

are protections in the sense that it's not any statement

16

that gets litigated here.

17

essential misrepresentation about how that money was used

18

that is at the core of these lawsuits, so that --

QUESTION:

It's got to be a serious,

All right.

I mean, if that's the

20

only answer, though, I -- I begin to think -- I don't know

how much money is involved, but I was trying to make a

22

guess and say, leaving out social security, food stamps

23

and that kind of thing, which are individuals, my guess is

24

there -- probably it's in the range of hundreds of

25

billions of dollars that go to cities, leaving those

things out, and you have a few bad actors in every program

that maybe purposely make a lie in a statement --

MR. MINER:

5

don't know why they do it, and -- and there we have

6

suddenly a huge liability imposed on citizens.

7
8
9

Now, I'm overstating this perhaps, but I want
you to tell me what the true dimension of that problem is.
MR. MINER:

Well, I don't think that -- first,

10

as part of that answer, Congress has made a decision by

11

the -- by increasing damages from double to treble, there

12

will be a deterrent effect, and that one response of this

13

is going to be, in fact, less fraud.

14

be -- the money will be used for the purposes for which it

15

was given to the states, and there will be a deterrent

16

effect in terms of government officials not actually

17

engaging in fraud and -- and a related interest in the act

18

is, in fact, promoting representative, responsive

19

democracy, and by disclosing frauds to the public, you can

20

correct them.

21

lawsuit is only brought if, in fact, there's been an

22

essential misrepresentation, something really basic about

23

what was done by a local government that has actually

24

misused the money.

25

There's going to

But the reality still is the contract, the

Local government has gotten the money, and, in

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

fact, all the local government is giving back is, it's

2

giving back the money it wrongfully got, if it's shown

3

that it got it by -- got it falsely or -- or fraudulently.

4

It's giving back prejudgment interest and, within the

5

statute of limitations of 10 years, that is always

6

virtually going to exceed the basic laws, and it's going

7

to have to pay back the -- give a share to the relator,

8

which is an important piece of this, because Congress has

9

also recognized that, in this area, where you do have

10

large amounts of fraud out there, there are no private

11

victims.

12

There is nobody who steps forward and says, I

13

was hurt, and therefore I'm going to bring a lawsuit to

14

protect myself and the Government will benefit, and the

15

Government, the Court -- the Congress recognized, doesn't

16

have the research -- the resources to deal with all this,

17

so it desperately needs the -- the private Inspector

18

Generals who are willing to step forward oftentimes, not

19

as bounty hunters, but as -- as really offended citizens

20

who, like Dr. Chandler, who brought it to the attention of

21

the county and said, you're not doing what you're supposed

22

to do, and they took responsibilities from him and he said

23

again, and you're not supposed to -- you're supposed to be

providing these services, and suddenly she wasn't

responsible for that.

whistle, because otherwise, the Government's not going to

they're -- they're terminated, so we've got to pay them

the Federal Government was not giving out money to

municipalities.

MR. MINER:

It wasn't, but that doesn't mean

that, first of all, again going back to Lafayette, this

Court recognized the fact that Congress in 1890 was

concerned about private corporations didn't preclude

including municipal corporations as persons under the

Sherman Act, and -- and the fact of the matter is, local

10

governments in that day did commercial activities.

11

built bridges, they took care of the indigent at the

request of States, and they were held responsible for

13

their actions and, in fact, when they didn't live up to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM S. STEWART

20

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

21

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

22
23
24
25

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The False Claims Act is the primary mechanism
for addressing deliberate efforts to cheat the Federal

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Government out of money and property.

2

identified no legitimate ground for excluding local

3

governments from the coverage of the act.

4

governments receive very substantial amounts of Federal

5

money, and fraud by local governments causes precisely the

6

same harms as comparable misconduct committed by a private

7

party.

8

encompassed by the term, person, and qui tam suits against

9

local governments raise no constitutional concerns.

10

Petitioner has

Local

Moreover, local governments are presumptively

Now, with respect to the 1863 act, to begin,

11

it's true that as of 1863, there was no square holding of

12

this Court to the effect that a municipal corporation

13

would presumptively be treated as a person for purposes of

14

Federal statutes.

15

at that time, Congress would certainly have reasonably

16

concluded that municipalities were covered.

However, given the materials available

17

As Justice Souter pointed out, as early as 1826,

18

this Court quoted with approval Lord Cook's observation to

19

the effect that the term, person, presumptively includes

20

both municipal and private corporations and, again,

21

because fraud by municipal corporations in the procurement

22

of Federal --

23
24
25

QUESTION:

There -- that -- that case, though,

was dealing with a private corporation, was it not?
MR. STEWART:

That -- that's correct.

There was

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

no square holding to that effect, but certainly all the

2

indications in the Court's opinions would have supported

3

Congress in its view that the term, person, would include

4

local governments.
The -- the Court in Monell held that as of 1871

5
6

a clear understanding to that effect had been established,

7

and petitioner has identified no evidence that would

8

suggest that the prevailing consensus changed during the

9

years between 1863 and 1871.
It -- it may also be the case that, as Justice

10
11

Ginsburg suggested, the question would have been a largely

12

academic one in 1863, because local governments wouldn't

13

have received a significant amount of Federal money.

14

Congress deliberately drafted the act in a broad fashion

15

so that it would encompass spending programs that were

16

adopted in the future, even if they were unknown in 1863,

17

and -- and the Court -QUESTION:

18

The

Now, aren't you gilding the lily a

19

little bit to say that Congress in 1863 contemplated that

20

there would be massive Federal spending programs in the

21

future?

22

MR. STEWART:

Oh, I'm not suggesting that

23

Congress contemplated that.

I'm saying Congress wrote the

24

statute in a way that would cover whatever spending

25

programs came to be adopted in ensuing years, and -- and

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the Court addressed essentially that situation in U.S.

2

ex rel. Marcus versus Hess, in which it said the type of

3

financial assistance that we're dealing with here would

4

not have been undertaken in 1863, yet Congress drafted the

5

act broadly, and these funds are in -- as much in need of

6

protection as other Federal money, and Congress did, in

7

some significant, some relatively minor respects, continue

8

to amend the False Claims Act at intervals during the

9

period between 1863 and 1986, and during that period, it

10

became increasingly apparent that local governments were

11

beginning to receive enhanced shares of Federal money.

12

It also became increasingly apparent that the

13

term, person would be construed generally to encompass

14

local governments, yet Congress retained the word, person,

15

even as it amended other features of the act, and I think

16

petitioner's primary argument is that even if the statute

17

included municipalities up to 1986, the 1986 amendments

18

took local governments out of the act's coverage by adding

19

a punitive component to the damages available, and -- and

20

this seems implausible for, essentially for two reasons.

21

First, the whole thrust of the 1986 amendments

22

generally was to make the act more effective, to expand

23

its coverage, to give the Government greater weapons in

24

fighting fraud, so it seems very unlikely that at the same

25

time Congress would have removed from the act's

coverage -QUESTION:

Well, we do have the presumption in

3

the City of Newport situation of not treating punitives as

4

applicable to municipal corporations.

5

MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

The City of

6

Newport involved a different sort of statute.

That is,

7

the statute at issue in City of Newport was 42 U.S.C.

8

1983, and it provided an express cause of action, but it

9

said nothing about the remedies that would be available,

10

and essentially this Court's holding was, where the

11

statutory directive is for courts to use their own best

12

judgment as to what remedies are appropriate, punitive

13

damages should generally not be imposed upon

14

municipalities, but here, Congress has spoken precisely to

15

the remedies that will be applied at the end of a

16

successful suit.

17

QUESTION:

Does it give the Government any

18

remedy that -- suppose that you think that the particular

do anything about it?

QUESTION:

Okay, so then, in other words the

city would have to come to you and say, this is a real

MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

Well, have there been a lot of cases

since 1986 against municipalities?
MR. STEWART:

Yes.

The figures I've been given

by the Civil Division are that 138 qui tam suits have been

18

filed against local governments since 1986.

those, the United States has intervened.

is meritorious and we want to -- to prosecute the suit to

QUESTION:

Do you have some dollar figures in

those?
MR. STEWART:

I don't have dollar figures with

Treasury has realized a little over $10 billion in

recoveries from False Claims Act suits.

QUESTION:

That includes

You sort of federalized this action.

10

I mean, you're going to let the private plaintiffs go out,

11

sue all the cities, and if you think there's something

12

wrong here, you will step in and deal with it?
MR. STEWART:

13

Well, I don't -- I don't want to

14

represent we will do this on a regular basis.

I just want

15

to say, it is an available mechanism under the False

16

Claims Act in extreme situations, where public policy

17

concerns cause the Department of Justice to conclude that

18

it's not in the public interest for the suit to go

19

forward.

20

The other point I would make with respect to the

21

City of Newport is, again, if -- the City of Newport dealt

22

with a statute that didn't specifically address the

23

question of remedies at all.

24

the law as it existed before 1986, that local governments

25

were covered, and that they were subject to the double

Now, if we're correct about

1

damages remedy that this Court had held to be essentially

2

remedial, if Congress had wanted to exclude municipalities

3

from the act's coverage, it -- it really seems outlandish

4

to think that Congress would have attempted to achieve

5

that objective by leaving the word, person, in the act

6

unchanged, and by amending the act's liability provisions.

7

If Congress had believed that it was appropriate

8

either to take the municipalities out of the scope of the

9

act altogether, or at least to subject them to remedies

10

less than those available against private corporations,

11

the natural thing to do would have been to amend the act

12

so to provide.

13

would have attempted to achieve that objective by so

14

indirect a means.

It -- it seems unlikely that Congress

The other point we would make is that there may

15
16

be isolated situations in which an award of treble damages

17

under the act will far exceed the harm that was done to

18

the United States, but the alternative that petitioner

19

contends we believe is much worse, because it would leave

20

the act entirely unavailable for redressing all manner of

21

fraud committed by local governments against the United

22

States.

23

When we have a contract action, when we have an

24

ordinary suit of a dispute about money, and we regard it

25

as a good faith controversy, even if we prevail at the end

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of the day, it's often the case that the United States

2

won't be made completely whole, because we incur costs of

3

investigation, costs of prosecuting the suit, we may lose

4

the time value of money.

5

faith disputes, Congress and the executive branch have

6

been content to treat that undercompensation simply as a

7

cost of doing business.
QUESTION:

When we're dealing with good

Do any Government grants or contracts

have attorney's fees provisions in them?

10

MR. STEWART:

11

certainly would not be the norm.

12

American rule is that each party bears its -- its own

13

attorney's fees, and so absent some express statutory

14

authority, we would not be able to recover our fees, even

15

if we prevailed, and so again, Congress is willing -QUESTION:

it in your grant.
MR. STEWART:

18

I don't think with -- certainly as

19

to municipalities I think we would have a hard time,

20

without express statutory authority, arriving at a

21

contractual agreement that municipalities would be subject

22

to such an unusual remedy and, as I say, Congress and the

23

executive branch are willing to live with that form of

24

undercompensation when we're dealing with a good faith

25

dispute.

The False Claims Act is reserved for that narrow

category of cases that involve people who don't simply ask

for money that, in fact, they're not entitled to, but who

ask for it knowing they're not entitled to it, and

QUESTION:

MR. STEWART:

is, the individual entity has to knowingly submit a false

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONNAL M. LACH

22

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Thank you, Mr. Stewart.

23

MS. LACH:

24

The first point I'd like to address is

25

That

Thank you.

Mr. Miner's point that local governments were sued in all

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

types of tort actions across the board.

Congress'

2

understanding of the suability of municipalities, and

3

municipalities as persons in 1863 was really dependent on

4

State law, because there had been no Federal expression up

5

until that time, and across the board in the States, local

6

governments were viewed differently.
Some -- some local governments were viewed as

7
8

quasi corporations and some as municipal corporations with

9

different levels of liability and, as I noted earlier,

10

some States made a distinction between proprietary and

11

Government functions, so Congress' understanding based on

12

State law at that time was not consistent enough to be

13

evidence that Congress understood person to include local

14

governments.
As for State criminal actions, in some States

15
16

there were misdemeanor actions against local governments

17

for nuisance actions such as failure to maintain a bridge,

18

but there is no common law with respect to -- to Federal

19

statutes.

20

statute, the States' understanding of -- of who is a

21

person subject to State criminal statutes is not

22

dispositive of what Congress had in mind, and if it is

23

ambiguous and it is inconclusive, as Justice Breyer

24

suggested, it might be what -- what Congress was actually

25

thinking in 1863.

When -- when Congress enacts a criminal

Criminal statutes are interpreted narrowly,
and -QUESTION:

3
4

Ms. Lach, there's one point that you

didn't cover in your opening argument --

5

MS. LACH:

Yes.

6

QUESTION:

-- and I'm curious how you read this

7

statute.

With regard to Dr. Chandler, she claimed that

8

when she blew the whistle, there was retaliation against

9

her.

There is a retaliation provision in the False Claims

10

Act.

On your reading of it, would she have recourse to

11

that provision against the county?
MS. LACH:

12

Well, under the facts of this case,

13

the county was not her employer.

14

Hektoen Institute for Medical Research, was her employer.

15

Cook County has been dismissed from that count, but --

16

but --

17

QUESTION:

The -- our codefendant,

Well, whatever, the municipal

18

employer, would -- you say that there is no municipal

19

liability for the allegedly ill-gotten gains, but what

20

about retaliation against the whistleblower?

21

act apply against the municipal unit to that extent?

22

MS. LACH:

Would the

Well, the term employer is not

23

defined in the False Claims Act, but just very recently,

24

2 weeks ago, on December 31, the Eighth Circuit reached

25

this issue and, without reaching the question of what

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

person means under the False Claims Act, the Eighth

2

Circuit determined that employer has a broader meaning,

3

and allowed an action to proceed against a local

4

government, in that case the St. Louis Housing Authority

5

under, only under the whistleblower provision, and so the

6

whistleblower provision in itself does not indicate that

7

local governments, even if an employee can sue a municipal

8

entity under the whistleblower provision, that does not

9

automatically mean that --

10

QUESTION:

If -- if the employer -- employee

11

could do that, the -- the retaliation provision refers to

12

retaliation against an employee for conduct in furtherance

13

of a False Claims Act action, so if there is no viable

14

False Claims Act claim against a municipality, then I

15

don't see how the retaliation provision could be

16

available.

17
18

MS. LACH:

The False Claims Act actions may be

caused by another party.

19

QUESTION:

But I'm talking about this very case.

20

MS. LACH:

Yes.

21

QUESTION:

I mean, if you're right that there's

22

no municipal liability --

23

MS. LACH:

But -- but in this case --

24

QUESTION:

-- especially by Dr. Chandler, do I

25

understand from your last answer that you are saying, no,

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

she's out of luck, the statute would not cover her?

2
3

MS. LACH:

Not against the county, but she still

has a retaliation claim against her employer.

4

QUESTION:

Under what law?

5

MS. LACH:

Under the False Claims Act.

6

There were two defendants in this case, Cook

7

County and the institution that administered the grant,

8

and that institution employed Janet Chandler, and so --

9

QUESTION:

And was that a private corporation?

10

MS. LACH:

It's a not-for-profit.

It's a

11

not-for-profit corporation, and so that defendant is in

12

the case, and -QUESTION:

13

But as far as a municipal employer is

14

concerned, a municipal employer, having retaliated, would

15

be, on your reading of the statute, just as free from

16

responsibility as it would be for the underlying qui tam

17

action.

18

MS. LACH:

No, under the Eighth Circuit case a

19

municipality can be held liable under the whistleblower

20

provision, even though -- I mean to sound very exact --

21

QUESTION:

That's what I was asking you about.

22

MS. LACH:

Yes.

23

QUESTION:

That's what one court has said.

How

24

does that court say that the employee's action was in

25

furtherance of a False Claims Act action if there is no

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

False Claims Act action?
MS. LACH:

2

The cases that have addressed this

3

have noted there -- a local government can be in cahoots

4

with another -- another entity that submits false claims,

5

the -- the local government is aware of it, and the

6

whistleblower is an employee of the local government.
In that case, it is -- in that scenario, the

7
8

whistleblower is blowing the whistle on someone else and

9

yet is employed by the local government and, under this --

10

under the Court's reasoning in -- in the Eighth Circuit

11

case and in the two cases that we cited, Satalich and Erie

12

County, an action can still proceed against a local

13

government under 3730(h), even though a local government

14

is not necessarily a person subject to suit.

15

To get -- to get back to the points, a lawsuit

16

under the False Claims Act can be brought if a statement

17

is made in reckless disregard.

18

the statement has to be clearly false, deliberately false,

19

and under the 1986 amendments, the standard has been

20

reduced to reckless disregard.

Mr. Miner suggested that

As for deterrent, by the time some of these

21
22

actions are filed, the wrongdoer is not even in office any

23

more.

24

bear the brunt of -- of any False Claims Act action and

25

penalty, not -- not the person that actually perpetrated

It is the local taxpayers, the local residents that

Alderson Reporting Company

2

the wrong.
When -- when in 1986 Congress expanded the

3

coverage of the False Claims Act, it did not expand the

4

fraudsters.

5

Claims Act covers just all kinds of fraud, but it does not

6

cover all kinds of fraudsters, and there's no indication,

7

under our view, that local governments were among

8

fraudsters that are included under this act.

9

As this Court noted in Stevens, the False

In response to Mr. Stewart, we are not aware of

10

any dismissals of False Claims Act actions that are

11

brought against local governments.

12

has not intervened, obviously, in -- in a number of these

13

False Claims Act actions, but we're not aware of any

14

situation in which the Government has actually dismissed a

15

claim against a local government.

16

and, even if -- even if the United States wanted to

17

dismiss an action, they would have to justify their

18

dismissal before the court, and the same with a

19

settlement.

20

The -- the Government

These actions proceed

It has to be approved by the court.

In sum, I would like to say that Congress knows

21

what language it needs to impose punitive damages.

If

22

this Court finds that local governments are included in

23

the 1863 act, Congress did not use the requisite language

24

to indicate that it meant to impose punitive damages on

25

local governments in 1986.
