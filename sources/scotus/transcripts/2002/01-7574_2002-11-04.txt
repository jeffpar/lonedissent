CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

4

next in Number 01-7574, David Allen Sattazahn versus

5

Pennsylvania.

6

Before we begin the second argument, I would

7

like to welcome a group of French judges from the Cour --

8

French Cour de Cassation, France's highest court -- who

9

are visiting our Court today.

10

Soir le bienvenue, Monsieurs.

11

Mr. Dunham, you may proceed.

12

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT B. DUNHAM

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14
15
16

MR. DUNHAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The double jeopardy question presented in this

17

case is whether the statutorily mandated judgment of life

18

that was entered in David Sattazahn's first capital trial

19

is, as a matter of Federal constitutional law, a judgment

20

that precludes the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania from

21

seeking and obtaining the death penalty in a second

22

capital trial.

23

opportunity to sentence Mr. Sattazahn to death, and the

24

jury in his case decided, in accordance with the trial

25

court's instructions, in accordance with the verdict slip,

Pennsylvania was afforded one fair

3

1

in accordance with the law of Pennsylvania, to report to

2

the court the presence of circumstances that it knew would

3

compel the court to impose a life sentence.

4

of life having been imposed after a full and fair

5

opportunity to try, Pennsylvania could not seek death

6

against Mr. Sattazahn on retrial.

7

QUESTION:

That judgment

But that wasn't the result of the

8

same sort of factual determination by a jury that took

9

place in Bullington, was it?

10

MR. DUNHAM:

No, that's correct, Your Honor.

11

The Pennsylvania -- the factual difference between

12

Pennsylvania and Missouri is the following, Your Honor.

13

In Pennsylvania -- actually in both States -- if there's a

14

unanimous jury verdict, that's the verdict that the court

15

imposes, that's the sentence the court imposes.

16

States, if the jury does not reach a unanimous verdict,

17

then the court is required as a matter of law to impose a

18

life sentence, so here, when the jury did not -- when the

19

jury sent its note back saying it was 9 to 3 in favor of

20

life, the court was required as a matter of Pennsylvania

21

law to impose a life sentence.

22

QUESTION:

23

In both

But in Bullington the verdict was

unanimous, was it not?

24

MR. DUNHAM:

25

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Well, isn't that quite a significant

4

1

difference?

Here the jury did not come to a conclusion

2

one way or the other.

3

MR. DUNHAM:

They -- they hung.
Well, Your Honor, they did not hang

4

in the traditional sense of a hung jury, and the

5

distinction between this case and a hung jury case is the

6

following.

7

when there's an absence of unanimity what happens is, the

8

trial court discontinues the proceedings and jeopardy

9

never terminates, and the proceedings are sent back to

10

The traditional hung jury case, the lack of --

start over.
Here, as a matter of Pennsylvania law, the

11
12

legislature determined in advance, saw the possibility of

13

a nonunanimous jury as one of the foreseeable outcomes of

14

the trial and in so doing it said, well, if that happens,

15

what we're going to do is say, the State only gets one

16

chance.

17

to all twelve jurors that aggravating circumstances

18

outweigh mitigating circumstances, then, well, that's the

19

only chance they get, and if they don't do that --

If the State does not meet its burden of proving

20

QUESTION:

But you agree --

21

QUESTION:

That assumes the point in issue.

The

22

State says that's not what we're saying, it's a default

23

mechanism and that is not the only chance the State gets

24

if there's a default.

25

we're arguing.

I -- this isn't a State law issue

I take it that the case comes to us on the

5

1

assumption that this is -- that Missouri has done is a

2

correct interpretation of its law.

3

supreme court says so, so you -- for you to say, oh well,

4

the State says this is the only chance, that's the whole

5

issue of the case.
MR. DUNHAM:

6

I mean, if the State

Well, Your Honor, this is like

7

Smalis versus Pennsylvania, another double jeopardy case

8

in Pennsylvania that was a decade before, in which

9

Pennsylvania -- this Court correctly found that

10

Pennsylvania could say what was necessary for the court to

11

enter a judgment --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. DUNHAM:

14

Yes, but --- but not say what the

constitutional -QUESTION:

15

-- that was a question of what was --

16

whether or not there was double jeopardy, whether or not

17

he, in fact, could be subject to a new trial, but you are

18

telling us that the State in this case has said that this

19

is his -- the State's only chance, and that's not the way

20

the State reads this law.
MR. DUNHAM:

21

That's all I would say.

This is what the statute says, Your

22

Honor.

23

when -- when you look at --

24
25

What the statute -- the statute is very clear

QUESTION:

The statute doesn't say anything

about this is the State's only chance.

6

1

MR. DUNHAM:

Your Honor, what the statute

2

says -- that's true, the statute does not expressly say

3

this is your only chance.

4

delineates the two circumstances, and the only two

5

circumstances in which a death sentence may be imposed,

6

and then it says, the verdict must be a sentence of life

7

imprisonment in all other cases.

What the statute says, it

8

In so doing, what the Pennsylvania legislature

9

determined was that unless -- unless the prosecution was

10

able to prove its case for death, that is, that

11

aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating

12

circumstances, and was able to prove its case for death

13

unanimously, then the outcome would be a life sentence.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Dunham, do I understand that

15

essentially what you are arguing is that we have here, to

16

put it in simple terms, claim preclusion but not issue

17

preclusion?

18

that if the Pennsylvania law had been -- when the jury

19

comes in 9 to 3 or 7 to 2, whatever -- when it comes in

20

that way, that the Pennsylvania law had been new trial on

21

penalty, you would have no double jeopardy claim.

22

you're relying on the entry of a mandatory judgment for

23

life to effect basically claim preclusion, although you

24

admit there's no issue preclusion.

25

been found by anyone.

You agree that this jury found nothing, so

7

So

That is, no issue has

1

MR. DUNHAM:

There's no issue preclusion with

2

respect to aggravating and circumstance -- aggravating and

3

mitigating circumstances, Your Honor, but what's clear is

4

that this jury had made a legally binding factual

5

determination with respect to the issue of life or death,

6

and --

7

QUESTION:

But this jury --

8

QUESTION:

But it --

9

QUESTION:

-- didn't do anything but say We

10

can't agree.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. DUNHAM:

13
14
15
16

Yes, they just hung.
No, Your Honor.

This jury did

split 9 to 3.
QUESTION:

And its verdict had to be unanimous

in order to have any effect, did it not?
MR. DUNHAM:

The verdict had to be unanimous for

17

the jury verdict to be imposed, but by operation of

18

Pennsylvania law, when -- the judge is then given the

19

opportunity to make two predicate factual determinations,

20

and if those predicate factual determinations are found --

21

and those are determinations relating to whether or not

22

the State had proven its case -- then the judge must

23

impose a life sentence.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, could the judge have imposed a

death sentence here in view of a 9 to 3 verdict of the

8

1

jury?

2

MR. DUNHAM:

3

QUESTION:

No, it could not, Your Honor.

Well, then, it seems to me when you

4

say Pennsylvania law says this and says that, as Justice

5

Kennedy just -- that's not what the supreme court of

6

Pennsylvania said.

7

argument here, double jeopardy, but I don't think you can

8

shift it over and say, this is what Pennsylvania law says.

9
10
11

You've obviously got a constitutional

MR. DUNHAM:

The Pennsylvania supreme court --

yes, Your Honor.
The Pennsylvania supreme court can say what the

12

operative effects of the statute are, and what the

13

Pennsylvania supreme court has said the operative effects

14

of the statute are is that when the jury is not unanimous,

15

then the judge must take a particular step, and that is to

16

impose the mandatory life sentence.

17

QUESTION:

Yes, I do think you can say that in

18

this case, there was a judgment that could have been final

19

had there been no appeal, and so therefore it's different

20

from a hung jury case in some other instances where

21

there's just no determination at all, because after the

22

jury's failure to agree, the judge did impose a sentence

23

that might have become final, that looked final in many

24

instances, in -- from many perspectives.

25

that there was an appeal, but it could have been final if

9

It turned out

1

there had been no appeal.

2

MR. DUNHAM:

3

QUESTION:

4
5

Well, in fact, Your Honor --

I mean, I take it that's part of your

case.
MR. DUNHAM:

Well, Justice Kennedy, what

6

Pennsylvania does is, Pennsylvania forecloses any appeal

7

of the sentencing determination.

8

receives a life sentence at the close of this trial-like

9

capital sentencing proceeding the State does not have

When the defendant

10

authority to appeal and, of course, the defendant has no

11

reason to appeal because he has -- he's come out with a

12

life sentence.

13

QUESTION:

Can I ask you, do you know from the

14

record in this -- does the record tell us in this case

15

whether or not this criminal defendant was advised of the

16

risk of taking an appeal?

17

MR. DUNHAM:

There is nothing in the record that

18

indicates that he was advised of that risk.

19

record -- everything that we can see on the record, from

20

the record there is nothing that says anywhere that David

21

Sattazahn was told that if he took an appeal, he risked

22

his life, and in fact --

23

QUESTION:

In fact, the

Well, do Pennsylvania judges

24

ordinarily tell potential appellants what the consequences

25

of an appeal will be?

10

1
2

MR. DUNHAM:

what rights that they are waiving, so --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. DUNHAM:

5

By appealing?
Yes, Your Honor.

But -- But what

was -QUESTION:

6
7

Well, Pennsylvania judges tell them

What sort of a colloquy would that

be?

8

MR. DUNHAM:

9

QUESTION:

I --

I mean, you know, I can see where a

10

defendant's being arraigned, or being advised whether or

11

not he should have counsel, there's that sort of a

12

colloquy, but -MR. DUNHAM:

13
14
15

That's what I was thinking of, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Yes.

Ordinarily a judge, after a

16

verdict comes in, there's no colloquy between the judge

17

and the defendant, is there?

18

MR. DUNHAM:

No, Your Honor.

There's a colloquy

19

as to you have a certain number of days to file post

20

verdict motions, you have the right to be represented by

21

counsel, and so forth.

22

QUESTION:

Could you --

23

QUESTION:

One of the things that we worry about

24

in enforcing the Double Jeopardy Clause is the possibility

25

that without its protection, the State, in effect, could

11

1

fail in its attempts and try again and again and again and

2

again.

3

penalty determination here?

4

Is there any risk of that with respect to the

On the face of it, it would seem that there

5

isn't such a risk, because the only circumstance -- or the

6

only obvious circumstance -- in which the State could see

7

the -- seek the death penalty again is the one that we

8

have in this case, in which the defendant takes the appeal

9

on some underlying issue of guilt or innocence, and it's

10

only then, if he is successful, that the State would, on

11

its view and on the Pennsylvania supreme court's view,

12

have another shot at getting the death penalty.

13

any greater risk of the State's being -- bringing

14

repetitive, making repetitive attempts to get the death

15

penalty against a given defendant?

16

MR. DUNHAM:

Is there

Well, Your Honor, if the judgment

17

is not a final judgment sentence, I don't see as a matter

18

of double jeopardy jurisprudence what would prevent the

19

State of Pennsylvania from then saying, for every other

20

defendant who had received a life sentence solely by

21

virtue of a split jury, why that would not be subject to

22

further proceedings.

23

QUESTION:

Well, that's a question that

24

ultimately I intended to ask counsel on the other side,

25

but what's your position on it?

12

1

MR. DUNHAM:

2

QUESTION:

3

I think that --

If you lose, is that, in your

judgment, the consequence?

4

MR. DUNHAM:

5

QUESTION:

I think that's --

That even in a case in which the

6

defendant does not appeal the underlying conviction, the

7

State can say, we'd simply like to try again on penalty?

8

Is that your position?

9
10
11

MR. DUNHAM:

Your Honor, under double jeopardy

law, yes, I think that would be the risk -QUESTION:

Well, is it a plausible position

12

under Pennsylvania law, because I -- and here I'm really

13

at sea, but we've been told that the State has no appeal

14

from the sentence.

15

supreme court and say something was wrong in the

16

sentencing proceeding and we should have another

17

opportunity, so how would the State get its second choice?

18

The State cannot go to the State

Do you think it would be inconsistent under

19

State law for the State simply to go to the trial judge

20

and say We'd like you to vacate that judgment insofar --

21

or the verdict -- insofar as it calls for a life sentence

22

and let us try again?

23

State under State law?

24
25

MR. DUNHAM:

Do you think that is open to the

I think the suggestion would be --

they certainly cannot appeal.

That would be the manner in

13

1

which it would be done if the State -- if the State -QUESTION:

2

No, but is there any reason to

3

believe that they could follow the course that I just

4

suggested, which would give them a repetitive opportunity?
MR. DUNHAM:

5
6

I would say as a matter of double

jeopardy, yes, there would be a reason to fear that.
QUESTION:

7

No, but I'm just asking a question of

8

State law.

Do you think the State law can be read in a

9

way that would allow them to do that?

10

MR. DUNHAM:

Yes, Your Honor, I do.

11

QUESTION:

But how?

12

QUESTION:

I can't believe you would take that

13

position, that as a matter of State law the State can go

14

in afterwards and seek a redetermination of the death

15

penalty under Pennsylvania law.

16

the State can't appeal.

17

MR. DUNHAM:

18

QUESTION:

You've already told us

I'm -- that's --

Under what provision of State law

19

could the State go in and ask for it to be done in some

20

other fashion?

I'm startled by your answer, really.

MR. DUNHAM:

21

Well, Your Honor, I mean, I think

22

it's unlikely that the State would do that, but I'm saying

23

that --

24
25

QUESTION:

We're just asking, as a matter of

State law, how could it?

14

1

QUESTION:

The whole premise of your case is, as

2

I understand it, is as a matter of Pennsylvania law, a

3

split verdict has the same effect as a unanimous verdict

4

for life.

5

MR. DUNHAM:

6

QUESTION:

So, let's -- let's --

7

QUESTION:

If that's true, then they certainly

8

That's right, Your Honor.

can't go in and -- and ask for another trial.

9

QUESTION:

Let's go back for a second, can --

10

QUESTION:

So, you misspoke on that.

11

MR. DUNHAM:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Could we go back to where we started

13

this whole discussion?

14

you that we're dealing with a kind of analogy, that the

15

law in this entire area is a matter of analogy.

16

analogizing the penalty phrase of a death trial as if it

17

were a second trial.

18

MR. DUNHAM:

19

QUESTION:

I mean, I would like to suggest to

We're

That's correct.

So I take it your problem is that

20

working with analogy, there's quite a lot here that

21

suggests a hung jury, and there are some things that

22

don't, so if it's like a hung jury, of course, the Double

23

Jeopardy Clause doesn't bar it.

24

jury, then it does, so I'd like to ask you to say as

25

concisely as you can in terms of the purposes of this

If it's not like a hung

15

1

whole area of law, why is it not like a hung jury?

2

MR. DUNHAM:

3

Justice Breyer, it's not like a hung jury first

4

because in the hung jury cases, the jury fails to reach a

5

decision and, as a result, the trial court then

6

discontinues the proceedings.

7

in the entry of a judgment.

8

case gets sent back and the prosecution then has the

9

opportunity to decide whether it's going to proceed with a

10
11

Yes, Your Honor.

A hung jury does not result

In a hung jury situation, the

retrial.
This is not a hung jury.

It's not a hung jury

12

because 1) it does not produce a mistrial, it produces as

13

a matter of law an entry of judgment, and that judgment is

14

a -- what we would say is a -- a judgment of acquittal.

15

The reason it's a judgment of acquittal is because this

16

Court has made clear in the context of Bullington, it's

17

made clear in the context of Rumsey, and even in Monje v.

18

California and Casperri that there is something

19

fundamentally different about a capital sentencing

20

proceeding that has all the hallmarks of a trial of guilt

21

or innocence.

22

There's something fundamentally different about

23

those proceedings from any other sentencing proceeding

24

and, because of that, because a capital sentencing

25

proceeding is the functional equivalent of a trial on the

16

1

issue of life or death, and because the State has

2

additional burdens of proof, additional evidentiary

3

requirements, the sentencing phase is, in effect, the

4

functional equivalent of a greater offense.
Because of these factors, when a defendant

5
6

emerges from a capital sentencing proceeding, tried to

7

completion, submitted to a jury and, after the

8

deliberations are done and the law operates, comes out of

9

this with a sentence of life, that life sentence is an

10

acquittal of the death penalty.

11

Now, because of that --

12

QUESTION:

You really are arguing for claim

13

preclusion, because in the two juries -- the jury in a

14

State that says, Okay, we do a retrial on sentence, and

15

Pennsylvania -- the two juries are doing an identical

16

thing.

17

Pennsylvania law precludes the claim, but the two juries

18

have done precisely the same thing, so -- and the

19

difference between this case and Bullington, of course, is

20

that there was a determination, a fact determination by

21

the fact-finder for life rather than death.

You're giving it a different label because

22

MR. DUNHAM:

23

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

And so you can't equate those two

24

cases, so you have to be relying on claim preclusion

25

because a judgment has been entered.

17

1

MR. DUNHAM:

Well, but Your Honor, I think it's

2

important to know what it is that the jury knew at the

3

time that it made its statement to the judge that it was

4

going to -- that it was intractably split 9 to 3 in favor

5

of life.
What that jury knew, because it was told in the

6
7

jury instructions, was that there were certain

8

circumstances in which it could impose a death penalty.

9

There were two limited circumstances -- aggravating

10

circumstances and no mitigation, or aggravation that

11

outweighed mitigation -- and in all other circumstances a

12

life sentence would be returned, so the jury is told that

13

up front.

14

Then the judge instructed the jury to take a

15

look at the verdict slip in the case, and the verdict

16

slip -- which contained language in bold capital letters

17

that were mandated by the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal

18

Procedure -- the verdict slip also told the story the same

19

things, and told the jury that if it could not reach a

20

unanimous verdict, it was to report that to the court, and

21

if the court found two facts, 1) that they were not

22

unanimous and 2) that they were not going to be unanimous,

23

the court would have the duty to impose a life sentence.

24
25

QUESTION:

And that would go even if it had been

1 for life and 11 for death, so you've repeated a few

18

1

times the 9 to 3 for life, but it wouldn't make any

2

difference if it was lopsided the other way?

3

MR. DUNHAM:

That's correct.

That's correct,

4

Your Honor.

But what's clear from this is that this jury

5

knew when it was reporting back that a life sentence would

6

result, and what's also clear is the way the statute is

7

written, the legislature has determined -- the legislature

8

has placed on the State the burden of persuading all 12

9

jurors that death is the appropriate punishment, that

10

aggravation outweighs mitigation.

11

that is a fact finding that the State has not proven its

12

case to all 12.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

When the jury splits,

But it's not a fact finding by the

whole jury.
MR. DUNHAM:

Well, it's a fact finding by all of

16

the jurors that the State has not been able to persuade

17

everybody.

18

QUESTION:

Yes, that's true, but it's 9 out

19

of 12, or 11 out of 1, whatever the case may be.

20

the whole jury.

21

MR. DUNHAM:

It's not

Yes, Your Honor, but then again,

22

Your Honor, as a matter of double jeopardy -- as a matter

23

of constitutional law -- there's nothing magical about the

24

jury having to be unanimous.

25

QUESTION:

In fact --

No, but there is something magical

19

1

about a jury, a unanimous jury making a determination, as

2

was the case in Bullington, where you don't just have a

3

split in the jury, the whole jury comes back and says Yes,

4

it's only life.

5

MR. DUNHAM:

But here the sentencer came back

6

and said Because the State has failed to prove its case

7

for death, then the answer is life.

8
9
10
11

The Pennsylvania law sets for the circumstances
in which the State has either proven or failed to prove
its case for death, and -QUESTION:

Mr. Dunham, maybe I'm

12

misunderstanding the Pennsylvania law, but I thought that

13

this position, we enter judgment of life, it favors

14

defendants.

15

further happens we're not going to subject this defendant

16

to the chance of getting death on a resentencing hearing.

17

We're going to give him life.

18

That is, the State is saying If nothing

On the other hand, if he chooses to appeal from

19

the guilt part on, say, a charge error, as was the case

20

here, then we're no longer going to give him that benefit.

21

We did it on the notion that the thing would be over.

22

wouldn't be subject to death, but now he's taking, in

23

effect, advantage of something we did to benefit him.

24
25

MR. DUNHAM:

He

Essentially, Your Honor, what

you're stating is the clean slate doctrine, and what --

20

1

and I think it's critical, when we're categorizing the

2

cases, to figure out which box this case goes in.
The clean slate doctrine applies when the

3
4

defendant has been convicted, and has been convicted of

5

the relevant charge.

6

in Bullington, and as this court has said in Rumsey, and I

7

would suggest, Your Honors, as it said in both Casperri

8

and Monje, that there is this categorical distinction

9

between capital sentencing proceedings and noncapital

If it's true, as this Court has said

10

proceedings, and that what happens in a trial-like capital

11

sentencing proceeding is that you have a separate trial on

12

the issue of the death penalty, then when you are

13

appealing from your guilt stage conviction, you're

14

essentially appealing from a lesser offense, and so, using

15

as the analogy Green versus United States, you would not

16

be appealing -- you would not be placing the sentence at

17

issue.

18

appealing a lesser offense.

You have won on the issue of sentence, so you're

QUESTION:

19

But apparently Pennsylvania has

20

interpreted its law differently on this point.

21

Pennsylvania would say, I gather, that if the defendant

22

does appeal in these circumstances from his conviction,

23

that it's all open to the State to seek the death penalty

24

again.

25

That's what Pennsylvania would say.
MR. DUNHAM:

But Pennsylvania can't --

21

1

QUESTION:

But you don't want us to hold that it

2

can say that.

You want to say that the Federal rule

3

should come into play and prevent Pennsylvania from saying

4

that.

5

MR. DUNHAM:

6

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

May I ask you a question about --

7

actually, two questions about Bullington?

Is it not -- am

8

I correct in recalling that in Bullington, the State had

9

the same -- the jury had the same two options, it either

10

could have found unanimously for the death penalty, or

11

either unanimously or by a split verdict, it could have

12

refused to find the death penalty and the consequence

13

under Missouri law would have been the life sentence?

14

MR. DUNHAM:

15

QUESTION:

16

That's correct.

So it's exactly like this case in

that respect.

17

MR. DUNHAM:

18

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And is it also not true that in that

19

case, we can't tell whether the jury verdict was finding

20

no aggravating circumstances, or a finding that no matter

21

what the aggravating circumstances are, we're not going to

22

impose the death penalty?

23

MR. DUNHAM:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. DUNHAM:

In Bullington?

Yes.
Justice Stevens, in Bullington we

22

1

can take it one step further.

2

the jury found at least one aggravating circumstance.
QUESTION:

3

In Bullington, we know that

And they -- so that their -- the

4

double jeopardy did not rest on the fact there was a

5

finding of fact, but rather, there was an ultimate

6

judgment that death is the inappropriate penalty?

7

MR. DUNHAM:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. DUNHAM:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Yes.
Now, Your Honors, I'd like to make

10

a -- I'd like to just talk very briefly about the second

11

issue and then reserve time for rebuttal.

12

Commonwealth has agreed that this statute -- the

13

Pennsylvania statute -- has created a liberty interest, a

14

life and liberty interest in the life sentence that was

15

the product of the nonunanimous jury.

The

16

What we would like to -- the dispute between the

17

parties is whether that life and liberty interest that the

18

State concedes exists survives an appeal, and for all the

19

reasons that we've talked about in the briefs, we would

20

say it does, because there is a special interest in

21

finality.

22

This Court has recognized in Bullington and in

23

Rumsey that capital sentencing proceedings -- and also in

24

the other, the noncapital cases we mentioned -- that one

25

of the hallmark differences between a capital sentencing

23

1

phase and a noncapital sentencing is precisely the

2

expectation in finality in the capital sentencing, and so

3

the defendant has a legitimate and substantial expectation

4

going in that when he gets this life sentence, it is going

5

to be a sentence that will remain with him.

6

We would say that Pennsylvania arbitrarily

7

deprives a defendant of this life and liberty interest if

8

it conditions his appeal -- if it conditions the

9

enforcement of that right -- upon giving up the right to

10

appeal a lesser and distinctly different offense.

11

conditioning the enforcement of his life sentence for --

12

in this case -- upon his not appealing the lesser first

13

degree murder charge, and that's where we say it's

14

arbitrary.

15
16

If the Court has no further questions, I'd like
to reserve the remaining time for rebuttal.

17

QUESTION:

18

Ms. Dougherty, we'll hear from you.

Very well, Mr. Dunham.

19

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IVA C. DOUGHERTY

20

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

21
22
23

It's

MS. DOUGHERTY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In Bullington, this Court examined its holding

24

that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not apply to

25

sentencing proceedings, and carved out a limited exception

24

1

which was based on the findings made by a sentencer in a

2

capital sentencing proceeding.

3

arise out of the proceeding itself.

4

these findings, which distinguish it from a traditional

5

sentencing procedure.

6

is consistent with existing double jeopardy jurisprudence.

7

The Court has never applied double jeopardy protections to

8

traditional sentencing procedures, because --

9

QUESTION:

The exception does not
It arises out of

This is the only conclusion which

It does seem a little odd that -- if

10

you have case 1, where there are no errors and the

11

defendant is not in any way prejudiced, and there is a

12

life sentence, that's final.

13

a flawed trial, the defendant was prejudiced, but at this

14

point he now faces a greater sentence for having -- for

15

having established the -- that prejudice.

16

if we're going to give him the option, we'd say That's a

17

risk he takes, but it's a little troubling about your --

18

MS. DOUGHERTY:

But in this case, there was

Now, obviously,

Well, double jeopardy -- the

19

Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't preclude a defendant having

20

to make choices in making a decision, and there's nothing

21

final about the life sentence that's imposed by a default

22

judgment under the Pennsylvania statute.

23

different than any other sentence imposed at the end of a

24

traditional sentencing proceeding.

25

QUESTION:

It's no

Well, is it final if he does not

25

1

appeal?

I mean, just to clear up that issue upon which we

2

got an answer that surprised us from counsel on the other

3

side, if he does not appeal, under Pennsylvania law, can

4

the State go, in effect, before the judge again and say We

5

would like to have another attempt to get the death

6

penalty?

7

MS. DOUGHERTY:

No, Your Honor.

8

QUESTION:

Okay.

9

QUESTION:

Well, this is like -- it seems like

10

Bullington in one respect, and not like it in another.

11

It's not like it in the sense that there's a hung jury.

12

It's like it, however, in the sense that the person is

13

faced with a terrible choice.

14

live.

15

If he doesn't appeal, he'll

If he does appeal, he may die.
Now, if that terrible choice is embodied in the

16

reasons for an exception to the ordinary blank slate rule,

17

that exists here, so do you think that terrible choice has

18

nothing to do with the exception whatsoever, or does it

19

have something to do with it?

20

MS. DOUGHERTY:

Under double jeopardy analysis,

21

I don't believe it has anything to do with it.

22

defendant also, upon appeal --

23

QUESTION:

The

Well, if it has nothing to do with

24

it, why did the court create the exception?

25

all, ordinarily, as you pointed out, when a person a

26

For, after

1

person appeals his trial, he makes of his sentence a blank

2

slate.

3

originally that death sentences are different?

4

It can be reopened.

MS. DOUGHERTY:

So why did the court say

Because the proceeding itself

5

requires a finding.

It leads to a finding.

It leads to

6

an acquittal in a way that other traditional sentencing

7

proceedings do not, and when someone has been acquitted of

8

the death penalty, then the State -- that would be

9

precluded by double jeopardy purposes for going back,

10

because of the finality that attaches to an acquittal, not

11

to the final judgment, not to a sentence that's imposed as

12

the result of -- that terminates a proceeding, certainly,

13

but it doesn't have that same finality that the court has

14

always accorded to an acquittal, and --

15

QUESTION:

Well, from the dynamics of what the

16

defendant faces when he's sitting at the table and he

17

hears the verdict come in, he hears the verdict come in,

18

no liability for the death penalty, the judge then

19

sentences him to prison, and I had thought he would

20

breathe a sigh of relief.

21

other words, he's faced the ordeal of -- of the trial,

22

et cetera.

23

MS. DOUGHERTY:

Under your position, no.

In

Exactly, and if he stops and is

24

satisfied with a life sentence instead of trying to get an

25

acquittal, which is the result of possibly seeking another

27

1

trial, is that he could walk out of the courtroom an

2

innocent man on second trial.

3

believe under Chaffin this Court has not ruled out the

4

defendant having to make choices like that.

5

serious, how tough the choice is --

6

QUESTION:

And that is a choice, but I

No matter how

Can you -- can I interrupt with just

7

one question?

Are there any other double jeopardy -- I

8

mean, I don't -- are there any other hung jury situations,

9

other than this very narrow category, in which the

10

prosecutor does not have the option to go ahead and seek a

11

second trial?

12

See, here you -- unless the defendant appeals, a

13

prosecutor can't do anything about it here.

14

other hung jury situation in which the prosecutor's hands

15

are tied in that way?

16

MS. DOUGHERTY:

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. DOUGHERTY:

Is there any

I believe the answer is no.

I think that's -However, I think it's comparable

19

to the guilty plea situation, where the Government could

20

forego seeking death in order to -- for an agreement to

21

life, and the Commonwealth -- the State would not be able

22

to appeal that imposition of the life sentence.

23

However, if the defendant appeals and gets his

24

sentence, gets his guilty plea withdrawn, the State would

25

not be precluded in that case from seeking death at the

28

1

trial.

So I think the situation is along those lines.
QUESTION:

2

Well, but a hung jury is not quite

3

like a plea bargain, though.

And that's what you're

4

talking about, isn't it?

5

then of course everybody starts from scratch, but not --

6

but when you've got a hung jury, normally the prosecutor

7

has the choice of whether to go ahead and retry or not.

If the agreement is set aside,

8

MS. DOUGHERTY:

That's correct, Your Honor.

9

However, the situation in this case, and the

10

situation for the exception in Bullington, revolved around

11

the findings by the jury, and it revolved around the idea

12

of an acquittal, not a sentence, and that was pointed out

13

further in Rumsey, where the Court talked about, the

14

sentence was based on findings which entitled the

15

defendant to a life sentence, and again in Poland -QUESTION:

16

Just -- let me ask just one more

17

question, then I'll be through.

18

your opponent said that there was actually a finding of an

19

aggravating circumstance in Bullington.

20

that?

21

MS. DOUGHERTY:

I did not remember --

Was he correct on

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

22

There may have been a finding, but it may have been

23

outweighed.

24

have been outweighed by the mitigating --

25

I'm sorry, I don't remember that, but it may

QUESTION:

So there would have been eligibility

29

1
2

for the death penalty there.
MS. DOUGHERTY:

But the ultimate finding of the

3

jury was that they were -- that they acquitted the

4

defendant based on their weighing situation.

5

And Poland further limited Bullington and

6

specifically talked about when there is not an acquittal,

7

then Bullington -- the Bullington exception does not

8

apply, and --

9

QUESTION:

Suppose we had a State with a system

10

that said, if any -- and I think some do have this

11

system -- if any one juror votes for life, then the

12

sentence shall be life.

13

the jury comes in and says, we're 11 to 1 for death.

14

judge enters judgment for life.

15

guilt -- if it's an appeal from the guilt determination,

16

and it's successful, then there wouldn't be -- there would

17

be no possibility of reopening the death-life decision,

18

would there?

19

MS. DOUGHERTY:

Suppose we had that system, and
The

In that case, if the

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I don't

20

know that that would qualify as an acquittal.

21

a decision made by the State legislature, but the fact

22

that one person would hold out for life -- an acquittal

23

is, traditionally has been looked at as a finding of

24

innocence, and a finding -- the court has generally

25

recognized it as finding innocence based on the evidence

30

That may be

1

in the record, and it's based on -- the whole point of the

2

jury system is to reach a collective agreement, a

3

collective judgment by the community, and one person

4

holding out for life does not possibly affect the

5

conscience of the community on that sentence.
QUESTION:

6

So, you say it would make no

7

difference if, instead of in this case, where the legal

8

consequence following -- follows a jury disagreement, a

9

State that says we make, in effect, each juror the

10

decisionmaker on the life-death question.
MS. DOUGHERTY:

11

I don't think that would still

12

have the finality of an acquittal under this Court's

13

double jeopardy jurisprudence, and of course, the

14

hypothetical doesn't apply in this situation, because

15

that's not what Pennsylvania said, but I don't believe

16

that one juror holding out for life could possibly garner

17

that finality that an acquittal has, and if -- I believe

18

there are certainly -- there might be -- there would be an

19

argument in that case that if the defendant appealed,

20

that --

21

QUESTION:

Why not?

If the State law sets up

22

that single juror in the same way that it sets up a single

23

judge, if the trial is before the judge -- if the

24

sentencing trial is before the judge?

25

MS. DOUGHERTY:

A State could do that.

31

I just

1

don't believe that that legislative decision would have

2

the same finality as -- as an acquittal, because an

3

acquittal is based upon a collective judgment of the

4

community on the ultimate question of -QUESTION:

5

Well, do you think that that case

6

that I gave you, where the State law says one juror for

7

life is enough, and Pennsylvania, do you think there's any

8

significant distinction between those two laws?
MS. DOUGHERTY:

9

I -- well, I'm sorry.

I'm a

10

little -- I'm not quite sure I understand your question.

11

There's a definite different in that Pennsylvania requires

12

a unanimous jury to reach a verdict, and therefore,

13

Pennsylvania is saying unless the jury -- all of the jury

14

agrees -- then there is no verdict.

15

There's no conviction.

There's no acquittal.

It's a hung jury.

I don't feel that I answered your question, but

16
17

I'm not sure how to better answer it.

18

there -QUESTION:

19
20

I do believe that

I take it you do believe that there

is a difference between those two situations.
MS. DOUGHERTY:

21

Well, there's a difference in

22

language.

23

effect, in the double jeopardy concept of acquittal, the

24

finality that should be accorded that judgment.

25

I don't know that there's a difference in

The -- Pennsylvania's position, of course, is

32

1

that without these findings made by a jury, that under

2

Bullington analysis, then double jeopardy would not bar

3

retrial for the maximum sentence.

4

the results obtained from the traditional sentencing

5

proceeding.

6

this case life, is not an acquittal of any more serious

7

sentence that could have been imposed and, as this Court

8

has recognized in DiFrancesco as one example, the

9

pronouncement of sentence simply does not have the

10

qualities of constitutional finality that attend an

11

acquittal.

The imposition of a particular sentence, in

QUESTION:

12

You're right back at

May I ask -- I said I wouldn't ask

13

another question.

14

jury in this case had been unanimous and said life rather

15

than death, would the judgment entered by the trial court

16

have been any different than the judgment it actually did

17

enter?

18

I would like to ask one more.

MS. DOUGHERTY:

If the

Life would have been imposed,

19

but it would have been imposed for a different reason.

20

The jury --

21

QUESTION:

Well, no, I'm asking, would the form

22

of the judgment, the language used by the trial judge in

23

entering judgment, would it have been any different from

24

the language it did use in this case?

25

MS. DOUGHERTY:

Well, it would have been based

33

1
2

on the unanimous verdict of the jury.
QUESTION:

That's not my question.

My question

3

is, the language of the judgment would have been any

4

different within the two cases?

5
6

MS. DOUGHERTY:

It would have been a life

sentence in both cases.

7

QUESTION:

Yes.

8

QUESTION:

But you're saying that the Poland

9
10
11

analysis should make the result different.
MS. DOUGHERTY:

Yes, Your Honor.

If there's no

acquittal --

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

13

MS. DOUGHERTY:

-- then Bullington doesn't

14

apply, and that's what would be different in the sentence.

15

There would be no acquittal.

16

QUESTION:

What happens, in your view, which --

17

I'll be rather imaginary.

I mean, there isn't a real

18

situation like this, but given the rulings of this Court,

19

I think you could have a State -- at least not in my

20

views, but other's views, you could have a State which on

21

sentencing left every question of fact to a jury, so they

22

decide every possible question of fact, but the ultimate

23

decision about what to do after those facts are found

24

would lie in the hands of a judge, and in a system like

25

that, where the judge then said life, would your argument

34

1

still apply, double jeopardy or not?

2

it, or not?

3
4
5

MS. DOUGHERTY:

Could they reopen

Well, the facts that need to be

found in a capital sentencing proceeding -QUESTION:

Are very complex, but we have special

6

forms and they go do it all.

What I'm trying to say is, I

7

want a State still that turns over to the judge the power

8

of life or death, and what the judge in such a State

9

decides is life, and now there is an appeal on the guilt

10

and innocence phase.

11

reopen that ultimate judgment which it put in the hands of

12

the judge?

13

question will be is, Why isn't this that State?

14

On -- in your opinion, can the State

And you see, of course, why -- what my next

MS. DOUGHERTY:

My problem in answering the

15

question, Justice Breyer, is I'm not sure what facts the

16

jury is --

17

QUESTION:

Everything you want.

I mean, you

18

know, I'm just trying to avoid that question, so have

19

everything you want, everything the Constitution requires,

20

everything the opinions of this Court requires.

21

interested in is not that, but I'm interested in the State

22

putting the sentencing decision in the hands of the judge.

23

QUESTION:

What I'm

Well, here the judge who enters the

24

verdict in this particular case does not do so because he

25

concludes that the circumstances -- he simply does it

35

1

because the jury has come in 9 to 3, doesn't he?
MS. DOUGHERTY:

2
3

right.

He has no discretion.
QUESTION:

4
5

He comes in because -- that's

He doesn't exercise independent

judgment.

6

MS. DOUGHERTY:

7

QUESTION:

He has --

No, but does that -- that's exactly

8

what I'm trying to get at, exactly the question.

9

is that what makes the difference?

10

MS. DOUGHERTY:

12

QUESTION:

14

Because the State has

told the judge what to enter?

11

13

I mean,

Well --

Rather than being discretionary, does

that make a difference for double jeopardy purposes?
MS. DOUGHERTY:

Well, I think it -- I think it

15

does, and to go back to your hypothetical, my problem in

16

answering that question, if the jury, in fact, has found

17

as fact that the mitigating circumstances outweigh the

18

aggravating circumstances, then I believe that would be an

19

acquittal.

20

and the judge was -- the judge had to rely on those

21

findings in order to impose that sentence, then I believe

22

that that would be an acquittal, which would distinguish

23

it from the case we have here.

24

QUESTION:

25

If the jury's findings were made in that way,

Why is that important?

Why is it

important for drawing a double jeopardy line that in the

36

1

Poland situation a jury makes a unanimous determination,

2

or in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, a judge that has the

3

power makes the ultimate determination himself?

4

judgment can otherwise be attacked on the underlying

5

conviction, why should it make a difference for double

6

jeopardy on sentence that the judgment of life rests upon

7

these kinds of determinations rather than the operation of

8

law which we have?
MS. DOUGHERTY:

9

If the

Because an acquittal has

10

always -- the definition of acquittal has always been

11

based on a finding of innocence, on a finding that the

12

State hasn't proved its case, and if there are no such

13

findings -- and that's why double jeopardy hasn't been

14

applied to traditional sentencing proceedings, and if you

15

don't have those findings, then there's no basis to

16

justify the acquittal, which would bar it under double

17

jeopardy.

18

QUESTION:

Were you going to comment in the time

19

remaining on the second argument -- which I call just a

The argument seems to be that somehow the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN

3

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

4

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT
MR. SRINIVASAN:

5
6

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The question in this case is whether

7
8

Pennsylvania's imposition of a default sentence of life

9

imprisonment by operation of law when the jury in a

10

capital sentencing proceeding is unable to reach a

11

unanimous verdict constitutes an acquittal within the

12

meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

13

answer to that question lies in the settled rule that a

14

hung jury is not an acquittal for double jeopardy

15

purposes.

16

We think the

Double jeopardy law has always drawn a clear

17

distinction between hung juries, where the jury fails to

18

reach a resolution of the case, and acquittals, where a

19

unanimous jury makes a factual determination that the

20

facts in evidence fail to establish the defendant's guilt,

21

or in this --

22

QUESTION:

May I ask how you would respond to my

23

question about the State that has a system, any one juror

24

who votes for life, if there's any one juror, it's a life

25

sentence, and this case?

Is there a distinction between

39

1

those two for double jeopardy purposes?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

2

Justice Ginsburg, we think

3

there is a distinction between those two.

In the

4

hypothetical statute that you posit, if the jury's

5

resolution in favor of a life sentence were not considered

6

to have final effect, that would strike at the heart of a

7

value central to the Double Jeopardy Clause in that the

8

State could then continue to reprosecute the defendant

9

repeatedly, so we think that in that hypothetical statute,

10

when the jury comes back for a life sentence, I don't know

11

if it's fair to call it an acquittal because an acquittal

12

has a settled meaning under the Double Jeopardy Clause,

13

but we think that determination would be accorded finality

14

for double jeopardy purposes.
But this case is different in a significant

15
16

respect.

17

opportunity to obtain a final acquittal in his favor that

18

defendants traditionally enjoy on the underlying question

19

of guilt or innocence, and that is that he could have

20

obtained a unanimous verdict in his favor, and we think

21

that distinction is critical for double jeopardy purposes.

22

Here, Pennsylvania gave the defendant the same

QUESTION:

Why should that distinction be more

23

critical than the so-called judgment distinction?

24

other words, in your -- I understand you to be arguing, as

25

Pennsylvania argued, that the line traditionally is drawn

40

In

1

based on whether there was an acquittal or wasn't an

2

acquittal -- an acquittal versus a hung jury, but that

3

line historically also is drawn, in fact, depending on

4

whether the jury's determination results in a judgment or

5

not.

6

line based on acquittal rather than drawing the line based

7

on judgment?

8
9

Here, we have a judgment.

Why should we draw the

There is a tradition for each.

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Justice Souter, it's true that

the sentencing proceeding in this case culminated

10

ultimately in the entry of a judgment, but the fact of a

11

judgment we think is not dispositive for double jeopardy

12

purposes, and that's because the core premise of the clean

13

slate rule is that the entry of a sentencing judgment is

14

not a double jeopardy disposition that bars the State from

15

resentencing in the event of a retrial.

16

event of a judgment that makes the difference.

17

whether that judgment manifests the qualities of an

18

acquittal.

It's not the
It's

That's what Bullington holds.

19

So the question is whether the entry of a life

20

sentence in this case manifests the quality of a factual

21

acquittal, and we think it does not, because a hung jury

22

has never been thought to constitute an acquittal within

23

the meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, but it does constitute an

acquittal of the death penalty if there's no appeal.

41

1

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I don't think so, Justice

2

Kennedy, because the State can resentence in the event of

3

a retrial.

4

won't appeal, but the operation of the clean slate rule

5

works such that when the defendant occasions a retrial by

6

successfully appealing his conviction and sentence, at

7

that point the State is free to conduct a resentencing and

8

impose a harsher sentence.

It's true that the State has decided that it

QUESTION:

That assumes the issue.

11

QUESTION:

I mean, that's the issue.

12

MR. SRINIVASAN:

13

QUESTION:

If -- I'm sorry.

I mean, you're right if you win, but

14

you're wrong if you lose.

15

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's correct, but -- of

16

course that's correct, Justice Breyer, but I think the

17

reason we should win is because the judgment that was

18

entered in this case is not a factual acquittal of the

19

nature that was considered --

20

QUESTION:

But, counsel, supposing the State law

21

had a provision in it that the votes of the jurors shall

22

remain secret, and the only thing that shall become public

23

is the judgment, what would you do in that case?

24
25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I think in that case --

it would depend on how the jury were instructed.

42

1

QUESTION:

Well, they're instructed just as they

2

were in this case.

As a matter of protecting the privacy

3

of the jurors, we're just not going to let the public know

4

how they voted, and that we just have a judgment out

5

there.

What do you do in that case?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

6

No, I think if the jury is

7

required to make a unanimous verdict in either direction,

8

and the judge imposes a sentence of life imprisonment

9

because the jury has made a unanimous verdict, that would

10
11

have -QUESTION:

No, it doesn't -- the "because"

12

doesn't follow, because you don't know on the record I'm

13

hypothesizing.

14

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I think in that situation

15

it would present some of the same difficulties that I was

16

discussing in reference to Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical

17

in that it's unclear whether the defendant would have --

18
19
20

QUESTION:

Well, I take it the judge probably

knows in Justice Stevens' hypothetical what the jury did.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

Right, and if the judge

21

articulated it in his judgment in a way that distinguished

22

between a judgment of a life sentence based on a unanimous

23

jury verdict and judgment of a life sentence based on --

24
25

QUESTION:

No, in my hypothesis he enters

exactly the same judgment he entered here, and he just

43

1

says I'm -- let's close the files on this case so the

2

public won't know how the jury voted.

3

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I think in that situation

4

we'd have the same answer that we would to Justice

5

Ginsburg's hypothetical, which is that because the

6

defendant has not been afforded an opportunity to obtain

7

finality, then the double jeopardy law would treat that

8

judgment as final, and the State would not be permitted in

9

that situation to revisit the sentencing judgment.

10

But this case is different in a significant

11

respect, because here, Pennsylvania law draws a

12

distinction between a unanimous jury verdict and a hung

13

jury that results in the imposition of a life sentence,

14

and petitioner had the opportunity to obtain a unanimous

15

jury verdict, and, in fact, when the jury initially past

16

its note to the judge indicating that it had reached an

17

impasse, petitioner immediately moved for declaration of a

18

mistrial and discharge of the jury.

19

it's clear under double jeopardy law that when the

20

defendant invites the declaration of a mistrial and the

21

discharge of a jury, there's no double jeopardy

22

prohibition against the State's conducting a retrial or,

23

in this case, the State's conducting a new sentencing

24

proceeding.

25

QUESTION:

And in that situation

But isn't the -- isn't the only

44

1

distinction in Justice Stevens' hypothetical between that

2

case -- the case that he posits -- and this one, the

3

secrecy.

4

difference, and I don't know why you don't answer by

5

saying, Look, what is necessary in order to implicate

6

double jeopardy is the unanimous acquittal by the fact-

7

finder, and if the record does not manifest that unanimous

8

acquittal, then, in fact, there would be no double

9

jeopardy bar to trying him on the sentence again.

10
11

And I don't know why the secrecy should make a

Why

hasn't that got to be your answer?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

Justice Souter, because it

12

depends on whether State law makes unanimity the deciding

13

criterion.

14

If State law does --

QUESTION:

Well, but on Justice Stevens'
His hypothetical was, it's

15

hypothetical, it does not.

16

just like this case except that there's a secrecy

17

requirement, so we don't know.

18

that yes, there ultimately was one or the other condition

19

necessary and sufficient -- sufficient, rather -- to

20

support the judgment of life, but we don't know which one

21

it was, and I would have thought that on your position you

22

would say unless it affirmatively appears that there was

23

an acquittal by the unanimous jury, there would be no

24

double jeopardy bar.

25

And -- and all we know is

Make it just like this case.

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Our position is that if a State

45

1

has a unanimity requirement, the Double Jeopardy Clause

2

does not preclude the State from enforcing that unanimity

3

requirement, but if a State draws no distinction between a

4

unanimous jury verdict of acquittal and a one-juror vote

5

for the life sentence, then the Double Jeopardy Clause

6

requires the State to honor the finality of the judgment

7

in favor of a defendant.

8

case.

9

QUESTION:

That's our position in this

Is it fair to take into account,

10

assuming competing analogies of equal weight, choosing the

11

one that would least discourage appeals?

12

problem here, I think, is the problem of a person having a

13

meritorious appeal, but being afraid to make it.

14

can -- am I free to take that into account, at least, in

15

trying to choose between the analogies?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

16

I mean, the real

So

Justice Breyer, we think the

17

due process question in terms of undue burden was --

18

was --

19

QUESTION:

I'm not saying that -- due -- is that

20

not a factor that I can take into account in trying to

21

choose among competing analogies?

22

MR. SRINIVASAN:

It's -- I think it's fair to

23

say that it's a factor, but I think it's important to note

24

that there are important reasons why a State would draw

25

the distinction drawn by Pennsylvania in this case.

46

There

1

are three reasons why a State might choose not to conduct

2

a resentencing in the initial round of proceedings, but

3

nonetheless to resentence in the event of a retrial.

4

First, as an interesting closure, the State

5

might determine that after a capital trial and a capital

6

sentencing hearing, at that point, it makes sense to

7

accept what is still a substantial punishment, the

8

imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment, but if the

9

defendant occasions a new trial by successfully appealing

10

his conviction, at that point the balance of

11

considerations changes.

12

And in particular, in terms of the second

13

reason, if a State were to conduct a new sentencing

14

proceeding immediately after a hung jury in the initial

15

round of proceedings, the sentencing jury would come to

16

the new sentencing proceeding without having had the

17

benefit of standing through -- of sitting through the

18

capital trial, and the State might reasonably conclude

19

that at that point, it would have to retry much of the

20

underlying case on guilt or innocence.

21

By contrast, when the defendant occasions a new

22

trial by successfully appealing his conviction, the State

23

will have selected a capital jury to conduct the trial,

24

and the new capital jury will come to the sentencing

25

proceeding entirely familiar with the facts and

47

1

circumstances of the case.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT B. DUNHAM

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6
7

MR. DUNHAM:

Your Honors, I would just like to

make a couple of points in rebuttal.

8

The first issue I'd like to address is the

9

question of the State's interest in closure, and the

10

policies, the way the double jeopardy policies work out in

11

this statute in this case.

12

Pennsylvania's statute as it's written recognizes several

13

different interests.

14

is the interest in economy, the interests in finality, the

15

interest in giving the State a single opportunity to try

16

and obtain a death penalty.

17

What Pennsylvania --

One of the interests it recognizes

On the other hand, it balances this against what

18

this Court has in the past said is a desirable goal of

19

trying to achieve jury unanimity.

20

for a unanimous jury, and it balances that against the

21

finality of the sentence.

22

required, when the jury comes back and says that it is not

23

unanimous, why that judge is then required to see if

24

further deliberations are going to be fruitful.

25

So it has a preference

And that's why the judge is

When the judge determines that the jury is not

48

1

unanimous, and determines that the jury is not going to

2

become unanimous, that represents a decision at that point

3

that the interest in finality, imposing the life sentence

4

now and ending it, outweighs the interest in obtaining a

5

unanimous jury.

6

ties into this Court's long-term double jeopardy

7

jurisprudence that one of the primary interests is against

8

subjecting a defendant to multiple trials, forcing him to

9

run the gamut of a second capital sentencing proceeding

10
11

And that is -- and that triggers, that

after the first has been tried to completion.
On another issues, Your Honors, one of the

12

things that I would suggest as a possible structural way

13

of looking at capital sentencing cases to see whether

14

there is a sensible way of determining whether or not what

15

you have is an acquittal is this.

16

Court talked about the binary choice between life or

17

death, and the significance of that when you have a trial-

18

like proceeding, in distinguishing between whether it's an

19

acquittal or a conviction, so there's a binary choice.

20

In Bullington, this

What the Pennsylvania statute has done is create

21

a second binary choice, only it's a procedural one.

22

this were a hung jury like what you see at trial, the jury

23

has three options.

24

there's limbo.

25

If

They can acquit, they can convict, or

The hung jury in the case goes back.

The Pennsylvania legislature has determined that

49

1

there is a second binary choice -- a procedural choice --

2

and that is, unless there is a conviction, a life sentence

3

is entered, and by eliminating that third category, it has

4

made the determination that any failure by the State to

5

prove its case to a unanimous jury constitutes an

6

acquittal, so I would say that the second binary choice,

7

the procedural choice, is a bright line way of saying

8

whether or not there is an acquittal.

9

I think, is what Bullington and Rumsey stand for --

10
11

And a bright line,
