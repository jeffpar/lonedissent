CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in No. 02-241, Barbara Grutter v. Lee Bollinger.

5

Mr. Kolbo.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KIRK O. KOLBO

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

THE WITNESS:

Mr. Chief Justice and May it

please the Court:

10

Barbara Grutter applied for admission to the

11

University of Michigan Law School with a personal right

12

guaranteed by the Constitution that she would not have her

13

race counted against her. That race -- that the

14

application would be considered for free from the taint of

15

racial discrimination. The law school intentionally

16

disregarded that right by discriminating against her on

17

the basis of race as it does each year in the case of

18

thousands of individuals who apply for admission.
The law school defends its practice of race

19
20

discrimination as necessary to achieve a diverse student

21

body.

22

school is committed to ensuring and meaningful numbers or

23

critical mass, is of a narrow kind defined exclusively by

24

race and ethnicity.

25

With the loss -- with the diversity that the law

The constitutional promise of equality would not

3

1

be necessary in a society composed of a single homogenous

2

mass.
It is precisely because we are a nation teeming

3
4

with different races and ethnicities -- one that is

5

increasingly interracial, multiracial, that it is so

6

crucial for our Government to honor its solemn obligation

7

to treat all members of our society equally without

8

preferring some individuals over others.
QUESTION:

9

Well, of course, you -- I mean, a

10

university or a law school is faced with a serious problem

11

when it's one that gets thousands of applications for just

12

a few slots.

13

in that setting is making choices about what students to

14

admit.

Where it has to be selective.

And inherent

15

So you have an element here that suggests that

16

there are many reasons why a particular student would be

17

admitted or not.

And a lot of factors go into it.

18

So how do you single this out and how are we

19

certain that there's an injury to your client that she

20

wouldn't have experienced for other reasons?
MR. KOLBO:

21

Well, Your Honor, first of all, race

22

is impermissible because of the constitutional command of

23

equality.

24

different kinds of choices in selecting students.

25

The university is certainly free to make many

And to look for all kinds of different

4

1

diversity, experiential diversity, prospective diversity

2

without regard to race, but race because, Your Honor, of

3

the constitutional command of equality, must be beyond the

4

bounds -QUESTION:

5

You say that's not -- it can't be a

6

factor at all.

7

cannot be one of many factors?

8

MR. KOLBO:

9
10

Is that it?

Is that your position that it

Our view, Your Honor, is that race

itself should not be a factor among others in choosing
students because of the Constitution.
QUESTION:

11

Well, you have some -- some

12

precedents out there that you have to come to grips with,

13

because the Court obviously has upheld the use of race in

14

making selections or choices in certain contexts, for

15

instance, to remedy prior to discrimination in other

16

contexts.

17

MR. KOLBO:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. KOLBO:

20

Oh, absolutely, Your Honor.
All right.
And I want to be clear about that.

We are -QUESTION:

21

Well, but you are speaking in

22

absolutes and it isn't quite that.

23

recognition to the use of race in a variety of settings.
MR. KOLBO:

24
25

I think we have given

And we absolutely agree, Justice

O'Connor.

5

1

QUESTION:

Is it cause for concern with your --

2

if you're the dean of the law school or the president in

3

the university or the Governor of the State that minority

4

students, particularly from the Black and Hispanic

5

community are underrepresented by a large factor,

6

according to their -- their share of the population.

7

Suppose you have a law school with two or three

8

percent Hispanic and -- and black students, is that a

9

legitimate concern for the university and for the State

10
11

officials?
MR. KOLBO:

We believe not, Your Honor, for the

12

reason that we need to get away from the notion that

13

there's some right number for each racial group.

14

QUESTION:

So if year after year after year

15

there's an underrepresentation, there is no cause for the

16

State or the Government or its educational experts to be

17

concerned whatsoever?

18

MR. KOLBO:

I wouldn't say not to be concerned,

19

Your Honor, I think the mere fact of underrepresentation,

20

that is that say, blacks are not represented as they are

21

in the population is not a concern that would justify

22

racial preferences.

23

broad social and political concerns.

24
25

QUESTION:

It certainly would justify perhaps

Well, it's a broad social and

political concern that there are not adequate members of

6

1

-- of a profession which is designed to protect our rights

2

and to -- and to promote progress.

3

think that's a very legitimate concern on the part of the

4

State.
MR. KOLBO:

5

I would -- I should

The current concern there, Your

6

Honor, ought to be addressed by -- by addressing the

7

problem.

8

minority groups are not participating as fully in the

9

fruits of our society such as being represented at the

10

schools, we need to address those problems.
But racial preferences don't address those

11
12
13

If there is some reason that -- that particular

problems.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kolbo, may I call your attention

14

in that regard to the brief that was filed on behalf of

15

some retired military officers who said that to have an

16

officer corps that includes minority members in any

17

number, there is no way to do it other than to give not an

18

overriding preference, but a plus for race.

19

done through a percentage plan, because of the importance

20

of having people who are highly qualified.

21

answer to the argument made in that brief that there

22

simply is no other way to have Armed Forces in which

23

minorities will be represented not only largely among the

24

enlisted members, but also among the officer cadre?

25

MR. KOLBO:

It cannot be

What is your

Justice Ginsburg, I don't believe we

7

1

have an adequate record in this case from which to

2

conclude that we wouldn't have representation of

3

minorities.

The military in the absence of --

QUESTION:

4

Suppose that were true.

Let's take

5

that as the fact, would you still say nonetheless even if

6

it's true that there will be very few, if any, minority

7

members admitted to the military academies, still you

8

cannot use race?
MR. KOLBO:

9

I believe race could not be used,

10

Your Honor.

I think that other solutions could be looked

11

at addressing the problem why they are not minorities in

12

the military.

13

a position.

14

from several individuals, the United States has not taken

15

a position in this case, the military academies have not

16

taken a position.

I note that the United States has not taken

We have the brief as Your Honor has mentioned

QUESTION:

17

Yes, they have, if the brief is

18

accurate about the regulations, the academies have taken a

19

position?

20
21
22

MR. KOLBO:

As I understand it, Justice Stevens,

the briefs are filed on the behalf of individuals.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

But they are

23

quoting material that the academies have distributed,

24

which indicate they do give preferences.

25

MR. KOLBO:

Well, Your Honor --

Do you challenge the fact -- that

We don't challenge what they say,

We're just suggesting -- we don't have a

QUESTION:

No, but do you challenge the fact

that they are giving the preference?
MR. KOLBO:

We don't have enough information on

it to know whether -QUESTION:

Are you serious that you think there

11

is a serious question about that?

12

that green brief as a representation of fact?

13

MR. KOLBO:

That we cannot take

I just don't know, Your Honor, what

14

the facts are with respect to the military because this

15

case was --

16

QUESTION:

It depends on what factor you're

17

talking about, doesn't it?

18

they're giving preferences, but that doesn't convert to

19

the fact that if they didn't give preferences, there is no

20

other way to get an officer corps that includes some

21

minority people, does the brief say that?

22
23
24
25

MR. KOLBO:

You accept the fact that

It does not, Your Honor.

We have no

evidence as to what the extent of representation is.
QUESTION:

The issue as I understand it is not

whether without preferences there can be a military

9

1

academy population with some minorities, the question is

2

whether without the -- the weighting of race that they do

3

in fact give, they can have an adequate number of

4

minorities in the academies to furnish ultimately a

5

reasonable number of minorities in the officer corps,

6

that's the issue, isn't it?
MR. KOLBO:

7

Well, Your Honor, again, the -- the

8

terms you've used, reasonable and adequate, we have no

9

information in this record on which I can make those -QUESTION:

10
11

More than what would happen if they

did nothing?
MR. KOLBO:

12
13

know what it is.

14

case.

And that number, Your Honor, I don't

Again, because it wasn't part of this

I think it's more -QUESTION:

15

More than what would happen if they

16

did something else, such as making special provision for

17

all people of economically disadvantaged background.

18

don't know whether that would have produced the same

19

number, either.
MR. KOLBO:

20
21
22

That's correct, Your Honor.

We

As the

Court -QUESTION:

Do you believe that that would be an

23

adequate -- at least means of experimenting here -- take

24

it as an alternative?

25

MR. KOLBO:

Taking race neutral alternatives

10

1

into consideration?

2

QUESTION:

3

Well, taking for example economic

disadvantage?

4

MR. KOLBO:

5

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Do you seriously believe that that

6

would be anything but a surrogate to race?

7

the word race out of the categorization of the label that

8

we put on it, but do you believe it would function in a

9

different way but as a surreptitious approach to race?
MR. KOLBO:

10
11

Your Honor.

It would take

It certainly functions differently,

Race controls --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. KOLBO:

14

QUESTION:

Is there any reason to believe that

MR. KOLBO:

I do, Your Honor, because it's not

15

Do you think it would?
Certainly, yes --

it would?

16
17

just minorities that are socioeconomically disadvantaged

18

in this country.

19

lines.

20

That happens with respect across racial

So race neutral alternatives -QUESTION:

The object -- but the object I would

21

have assumed given the dialogue, the object is to increase

22

the racial number of the percentage of minorities.

23

that is the object, than whatever it is, it's not a race

24

neutral measure.

25

MR. KOLBO:

If

Well, I would disagree, Your Honor,

11

1

because I think if you have a race neutral means that

2

accomplishes many purposes, and one of them is race, that

3

is not necessarily under this Court's precedents

4

unconstitutional.

The Court --

QUESTION:

5

Well, let me ask you this, it's about

6

the military brief that you didn't come here to argue

7

about, but it will maybe get you back to your case.

8

MR. KOLBO:

9

QUESTION:

Sure.
The military brief tells us -- the

10

green brief -- that there are preparatory schools that the

11

academies have and 40 percent of the registration in those

12

preparatory schools are racial minorities.
And they -- suppose the Government does this and

13
14

expends money for the purpose of recruiting and helping

15

racial minorities apply to the academies and succeed

16

there.

17

Is that a proper constitutional purpose?

18

MR. KOLBO:

I see no constitutional objection

19

there, Justice Kennedy.

20

quite permissible in principle to draw a line between

21

casting a wider net, recruiting and -- and the point of

22

competition where people -- where people -- where the

23

decision must be made whether people are going to be

24

treated on the basis of the same --

25

QUESTION:

For the reason I think it -- it's

Would you allow recruiting targeted

12

1

at minorities?
MR. KOLBO:

2
3

I don't see the constitutional

objection with that, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

4

Fine.

If you can use race as a

5

criterion for spending money, I take it one argument on

6

the other side, which I'd like you to address, is that we

7

live in a world where more than than half of all the

8

minority -- really 75 percent of black students below the

9

college level are at schools that are more than 50 percent

10

minority.

11

poverty.

12

And 85 percent of those schools are in areas of

And many among other things that they tell us on

13

the other side is that many people feel in the schools,

14

the universities, that the way -- the only way to break

15

this cycle is to have a leadership that is diverse.

16

to have a leadership across the country that is diverse,

17

you have to train a diverse student body for law, for the

18

military, for business, for all the other positions in

19

this country that will allow us to have a diverse

20

leadership in a country that is diverse.

21

And

Now, you're familiar with that argument. But if

22

it is reasonable to use race as a criterion, as a plus for

23

spending money, why isn't it also reasonable to use it as

24

a plus to see that -- to obtain that set of objectives

25

that I've tried to summarize in a second that you're very

13

1

familiar with.
MR. KOLBO:

2

Because very simply, Justice Breyer,

3

the Constitution provides the right of -- individuals with

4

the right of equal protection.

5

the basis of race at a point of competition, innocent

6

individuals are being injured in their constitutional

7

rights.

8

trying to cast a wider net, recruiting spending money on

9

outreach efforts, a very principal line it seems to me can

10
11

And by discriminating on

That's the distinction between that and simply

be drawn between those two things.
QUESTION:

The reason that the injury is more

12

severe to the white person who doesn't get in when that

13

white person doesn't get in because she's not an athlete

14

or he's not a -- he's not a alumnus or he's not any of the

15

other things that fits within these other criteria?

16

is the difference there is?

17

MR. KOLBO:

18

Protection Clause, Your Honor.

19

alumni preferences in scholarships.

20

QUESTION:

What

The difference is the Equal
It does not apply to
It applies to race.

That's the legal conclusion. But the

21

reason if I thought, for example, that there is a

22

difference under the Equal Protection Clause, between a

23

system that says to the discriminated-against people, the

24

law does not respect you, and a system that says the law

25

does respect you, but we are trying to help some others,

14

1

suppose I thought that that is a sound legal distinction

2

as reflected in this Court's cases, you would reply that?
MR. KOLBO:

3

Sound and reasonable, Your Honor, is

4

not enough when it comes to race.

It must be a compelling

5

purpose.

6

policy choices a university can make that I may disagree

7

or agree with, and that I have no legal standing or no

8

client has a legal standing to challenge, because they

9

don't implicate important constitutional rights.

And that is the difference. There are many

10

something special about race in this country.

11

have a Constitution about it.

12

constitutional amendment about it.

13

QUESTION:

There is

It's why we

It's why we have a

Why -- why do you draw the line at --

14

you said you can recruit -- you can use a race criterion,

15

if I understood you correctly, to recruit, you could have

16

minority students only given the benefit of scholarships

17

to go to these preparatory schools.

18

recognizing the race criterion there.

19

permissible?

20

MR. KOLBO:

You were surely
Why is that

Because it doesn't prevent someone

21

from applying.

22

same footing at the point of competition.

23

The key is to be able to compete on the

QUESTION:

These preparatory schools -- do you

24

concede that they're only for minority students? I'm

25

familiar with those preparatory schools, familiar or not?

15

1

MR. KOLBO:

2

QUESTION:

Certainly not -The majority of the people that

3

attend them are young men and women who really want to get

4

into the service academies, but don't have the grades for

5

it.

6

black, white or anything else, go to these preparatory

7

schools and you'll have a better chance next time around.

And the service academy tells them whether they're

MR. KOLBO:

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. KOLBO:

That -It isn't just for minorities.
They're not, Your Honor.

11

open to -- accessible to all.

12

QUESTION:

They are

I was asking you about your answer to

13

the question, not -- the fact may very well be, but I

14

thought you had answered the question, yes, you could have

15

special preparation for minorities only, yes, you could

16

have recruitment for minorities only.

17

was your answer.

18

MR. KOLBO:

I thought that that

I believe you can -- as part of a

19

broad program, I believe you could.

20

outreach for minority students, because it's very simple

21

it seems to me to draw a principal distinction between

22

outreach, casting a wider net and applying the same

23

standard at the point of -- at the point of competition.

24
25

QUESTION:

You could seek

Including at the point of giving the

benefit of going to one of these preparatory schools.

16

You

1

wouldn't allow one of these preparatory schools to be for

2

minority only, would you?
MR. KOLBO:

3

No, of course not, Your Honor.

And

4

I'm not suggesting that outreach would be limited to

5

minorities only.

6

understand why there would be a constitutional objection

7

to trying to cast a wider net by focusing as part of a

8

broader effort of outreach in recruiting minority students

9

and it can be quite -- it's quite easy to draw the line

10

I'm just suggesting that -- I don't

between that and -- and the point of competition.

11

QUESTION:

May I ask --

12

QUESTION:

If you're right -- if you're right

13

about what equal protection requires and we have also two

14

statutes that incorporate the equal protection principle,

15

then there could be no affirmative action, I take it, in

16

employment?
MR. KOLBO:

17

There could be, Your Honor, to

18

remedy past identified discrimination, but not to exceed

19

diversity and there is not today as I understand it any

20

compelling interest in the employment context with respect

21

to --

22

QUESTION:

So, for example, if we have a prison

23

that was largely minority population and the state wanted

24

to give a preference so that it would have a critical mass

25

of correction officers of the minority race, that would be

17

1
2

impermissible?
MR. KOLBO:

It would be impermissible, Your

3

Honor, unless based upon a compelling interest and the

4

only one that has been recognized in the employment

5

context is identified discrimination.

6

that in your hypothetical.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. KOLBO:

9

QUESTION:

And I don't see

No, it's not in my hypothetical.
Mr. Chief Justice.
Can I ask you one question about the

10

extent of your position?

11

it's by the Potawatomi tribe.

12

governor of Michigan many years ago had made a commitment

13

to an Indian tribe to allow three persons into the

14

University of Michigan every year, three tribemen, and

15

nothing else, would that be constitutionally permissible?

16
17
18
19

MR. KOLBO:

There's a brief applied, I think
If Michigan had made -- the

I don't believe so Your Honor.

Again, it's a distinction drawn on the basis of race.

would exclude an impermissible number of slots for -MR. KOLBO:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

The Michigan law school admissions program fails

every test this Court has articulated for evaluating

7

governmental racial preferences.

8

First, it is --

9

QUESTION:

General Olson, just let me get a

10

question out and you answer it at your convenience. I'd

11

like you to comment on Carter Phyllip's brief. What is

12

your view of the strength of that argument?

13

GENERAL OLSON:

14

QUESTION:

15

about the military academies.

16

Well, I'm not sure --

That's the one about the generals and

GENERAL OLSON:

I understand -- the -- our

17

position with respect to that is we respect the opinions

18

of those individuals, but the position of the United

19

States is that we do not accept the proposition that black

20

soldiers will only fight for -- black officers or the

21

reverse that race neutral means should be used in the

22

academies as well as other places.

23

And that to the extent that there's any

24

difference in analysis, the Court might consider its

25

position, the position it articulated in connection with

19

1

the military in Rostker v. Goldberg.

2

with respect to that brief is that -QUESTION:

3
4

Your suggestion is that the military

has broader latitude than the private university?

No, I'm suggesting that --

Well, you're pointing to Rostker

suggests that.
GENERAL OLSON:

Court will want to look at each of these individual

situations according to the circumstances and that may be

11

a factor in that context.

12

Justice Stevens, by saying you do not accept the

13

proposition that race neutral means should not be used and

14

employed fully to -- to make sure that the academies are

15

accessible and open and -- and offer opportunities for as

16

many people as possible.
QUESTION:

17

But I started my answer,

But you recognize, General Olson,

18

that here and now, all of the military academies do have

19

race preference programs in admissions?
GENERAL OLSON:

20

The Coast Guard does not. It's

21

prohibited by Congress from doing so.

22

Justice Ginsburg that the other academies are doing so.

23

It's the position of the United States -QUESTION:

24
25

I do acknowledge,

Is that that's illegal what they're

doing?

20

GENERAL OLSON:

QUESTION:

violation of the Constitution?

4

Pardon me?

Is it -- that it is illegal, a

We haven't examined that and we

haven't presented a brief with respect to the specifics of

6

each individual academy.

7

consideration any potential impact suggested by the Court

8

in the Rostker case.

9

QUESTION:

And we would want to take into

What do you -- what do you think is

10

the -- is the principal race neutral means, that the

11

academy should use?

12

GENERAL OLSON:

13

QUESTION:

Well --

Without criticizing necessarily what

14

they're doing now, what would be the -- in your judgment,

15

the best race neutral way for them to go about reaching

16

your objective?

17

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, there are a variety of

18

race neutral means and narrowly tailored methods by which

19

academies and universities can reach out to people of all

20

backgrounds to make sure that they've eliminated --

21

QUESTION:

No, no.

I realize your position.

22

But specifically, which -- which of the race neutral

23

suggestions that have been considered do you think would

24

be, you know, most adaptable to the academy situation?

25

MR. KOLBO:

Widespread recruiting, making sure

21

1

that there's opportunities for education and advancement

2

in the -- in the academies.

3
4
5

QUESTION:

Recruiting with an objective of

minority students?
GENERAL OLSON:

Not limited, a race neutral

6

system of broad scale recruiting that this Court has

7

always supported the proposition that efforts may be made

8

by governmental institutions to eliminate barriers that

9

have existed where artificial barriers --

10

QUESTION:

Okay.

But my question is, if they

11

don't do it with a racial objective, how does the

12

recruiting respond to the position taken in -- in Mr.

13

Phillips's brief that without the kind of -- of racial

14

weighting and admissions that is given now, they simply

15

will not reach a -- a -- a substantial number of -- or be

16

able to attain a substantial number of minority slots in

17

the class?

18

GENERAL OLSON:

That is the opinion of certain

19

individuals.

It is -- we do not accept that conclusion

20

based upon those opinions.

21

held that race neutral means must be demonstrated and will

22

be accepted, and will not -- and the Court will not accept

23

the proposition that race neutral means will not be

24

successful unless they've been attempted and demonstrated.

25

These -- this program at the University of Michigan Law

And this Court has repeatedly

22

1

School fails every one of the Court's tests.

First, it's

2

a thinly disguised quota which sets aside a significant

3

portion of each year's entering class for preferred ethnic

4

groups.
Secondly, it overtly employs stigmatizing and

5
6

divisive racial stereotypes, what the law school calls

7

diversity-relevant characteristics.

8

by diversity-relevant characteristics.
QUESTION:

9

It identifies persons

Well, what they do is they use race.

10

GENERAL OLSON:

11

QUESTION:

Exactly.

I know.

But they have a reason for

12

it.

The reason for it is they want to produce a diverse

13

class and the reason they want to do that, using it as a

14

plus, they say, is to do the things I said before.

They

15

think it breaks down stereotypes within the class.

They

16

think it's educationally beneficial.

17

supplies a legal profession that will be diverse and they

18

think a legal profession like business and the military

19

that is diverse is good for America from a civics point of

20

view, et cetera, breaks the cycle.

21

arguments which you well know.

22

So what is your response?

23

GENERAL OLSON:

They think it

Those are the

Well, a response to those many

24

arguments is that they've -- they're using stereotypes to

25

in an effort, they say to break down stereotypes, they're

23

1

using race as a -- a surrogate for experience.

2

they want to look at experience, they can look at

3

experience.

4

opportunities of minority groups, one of the biggest

5

problems --

6

And if

If they want to improve the educational

QUESTION:

That's not what they say.

They say

7

they're not using race as a surrogate for anything,

8

because if you have a person who went to Exeter who's very

9

rich and happens to be black and is a conservative

10

Republican, it's great for the class to know that, too.

11

And that's why they want a certain number.

12

GENERAL OLSON:

But that person -- that person

13

if he went to Exeter and he has a great GPA and so forth

14

gets an extra opportunity either a portion of the class is

15

set aside for that individual solely on the basis of race,

16

irrespective of his experience.

17

application isn't examined for the type of experience or

18

the type of viewpoint that race-diversity characteristic

19

is used as a substitute for any examination of the

20

individual on the individual.

21

QUESTION:

And the -- and the

General Olson, do you -- do you agree

22

with the articulated proposal of Justice Powell in the

23

Bakke case of using race as a plus factor as he -- as he

24

saw the use of it.

25

Do you disagree with that approach?

GENERAL OLSON:

We disagree with that approach

24

1

in the sense that we -- we -- in the first place, contrary

2

to what our opponents have said, we would not believe that

3

that single opinion, which was the only opinion, to

4

examine the issue of diversity under a compelling argument

5

--

6
7
8
9

QUESTION:

I don't think it commanded a court.

I'm just asking if you agreed with that approach.
GENERAL OLSON:
Justice O'Connor.

We're reluctant to say never,

But this test -- every test that

10

Justice Powell applied in that opinion, the law school

11

program here fails.

12

QUESTION:

It's a stereotype.
But General Olson, is race different

13

from sex in that regard?

14

disapproved using sex as just a plus factor?

15

factor among many, but, you know, when you get down to it,

16

this is -- this person is a male and therefore we'll put

17

that into the mix and that'll favor the person.

18

disapproved that with regard to sex discrimination,

19

haven't we?

20

GENERAL OLSON:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

I thought we have -- we have
That is one

We've

I don't disagree with that.

Why would race discrimination be any

different?
GENERAL OLSON:

I'm suggesting that the programs

24

here, without getting to the point of whether are there

25

any other circumstances whether they be remedial, which

25

1

this Court -- a factor of the Court has recognized before,

2

or something else in an unusual situation, where it could

3

be appropriate.

4

this test --

I don't know what that might be.

QUESTION:

5

But

I think Santa Clara -- I think what

6

Justice Scalia said bears modification, because in fact in

7

Santa Clara, the highway dispatcher, there was a plus for

8

sex, although there was no proven discrimination against

9

that particular woman and this Court approved that.
GENERAL OLSON:

10

I would also say that it's

11

conceivable if you're constructing -- the National

12

Institutes of Health is constructing this study of

13

diseases that focus on particular races, the race may be a

14

factor but the fact is that the law school program here,

15

not only is a set aside and a quota, but it -- but it --

16

-QUESTION:

17
18

General Olson, I'm not sure you

answered Justice O'Connor's question.

19

Do you agree with Justice Powell's suggestion

20

that race could be used as a plus in something like the

21

Harvard program?
GENERAL OLSON:

22

No, the Harvard program A wasn't

23

examined according to to any compelling governmental

24

interest.

25

It was examined only -QUESTION:

So your answer is no, you would not

26

1

agree with that?

2

GENERAL OLSON:

3

we see in that opinion, which is -QUESTION:

4

We would not based upon any what

Would you disagree with his use of

5

the term diversity as being a permissible governmental

6

goal?
GENERAL OLSON:

7

Well, the only way to answer

8

that Justice Kennedy is that the word diversity means so

9

many things to so many different people.

It means both a

10

means to get experience and a diversity of experience.

11

also means, I think what the law school has done, it's an

12

end in and of itself.

13

obviously it's constitutionally objectable that this Court

14

--

15

QUESTION:

It

If it's an end in and of itself,

So is the Texas plan constitutional?

16

If it's designed solely in order to have a diverse mix in

17

the colleges they take 10 percent, but their motive stated

18

and their purpose is to have diversity in the college?

19

GENERAL OLSON:

Justice Breyer, I don't believe

20

that that is the stated motive of the Texas plan or the

21

California or the Florida plan.

22

open up those institutions to a broader selection, one of

23

the ways in which this Court has accepted the institution

24

such as universities may operate is to make sure that

25

barriers are broken down, accessibility is made more

Those are intended to

27

1

available and that is one very race neutral means of

2

accomplishing that legitimate objective.

3

QUESTION:

General, what do you say to the

4

argument that the only reason accomplishes it is because

5

it depends on segregation at the lower level of the

6

schools, otherwise it would not accomplish that?

7

GENERAL OLSON:

No, there is no evidence that it

8

depends upon segregation of the schools in Texas or in any

9

other place.

10
11

It is a diverse selection of the high schools in
that state.

12

QUESTION:

13

Ms. Mahoney, we'll hear from you.

14

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN MAHONEY

15

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

16
17
18

Thank you, General Olson.

MS. MAHONEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Solicitor General acknowledges that

19

diversity may be a compelling interest but contends that

20

the University of Michigan Law School can achieve a

21

diverse student body through facially race neutral means.

22

His argument ignores the record in this case.

23

QUESTION:

24
25

I'm not sure -- in his brief does he

acknowledge that can be a compelling interest?
MS. MAHONEY:

The brief says that it is one of

28

1

the paramount interests of government to have diversity in

2

higher education.

3

consistent position of the Department of Education for the

4

past 25 years that Bakke is the governing standard, that

5

schools are encouraged to use programs to achieve

6

diversity, because of the important interests it serves

7

for students of all color.

8
9

And it has certainly been the

QUESTION:

Ms. Mahoney, supposing that after our

Bakke decision came down, whereas Cal. Davis set aside 16

10

seats for disadvantaged minorities, and Cal. Davis said

11

we're going to try to get those 16 seats in some other

12

way, we're going to try high school graduates, we're going

13

to try socioeconomic and none of the -- none of those

14

methods get the 16 seats that they want.

15
16
17

Can they then go back and say we've tried
everything, now we're entitled to set aside 16 seats?
MS. MAHONEY:

I don't think so, Your Honor. I

18

think what the Court's judgment in Bakke said and

19

certainly what Justice Powell's opinion said is that it's

20

simply not necessary to do a set aside because a plan like

21

the Harvard plan, which takes race into account as one

22

factor can be used as an effective means to --

23
24
25

QUESTION:

But my hypothesis was, they wanted 16

seats and that plan just won't give it to them?
MS. MAHONEY:

Well, if -- if the program was

29

1

designed to have a fixed 16 seats, no matter what the

2

qualifications of the applicant pool, no matter what the

3

disparities between the minority and majority students

4

would be, then I think it's fair to say that that would be

5

a quota.

6

If that is the nature of the program.

7

the record indicates that the -- the law school's program

8

is nothing of the kind.

9

But here

That what has occurred over the years with this

10

program is that there have been offers that have ranged

11

from 160 to 232 over the course of eight years there have

12

been enrollments that went from 44 to 73.

13

very flexible program.

14

QUESTION:

It has been a

Ms. Mahoney, I -- I find it hard to

15

take seriously the State of Michigan's contention that

16

racial diversity is a compelling State interest,

17

compelling enough to warrant ignoring the Constitution's

18

prohibition of discrimination on the basis of race.

19

The reason I say that is that the problem is a

20

problem of Michigan's own creation, that is to say, it has

21

decided to create an elite law school, it is one of the

22

best law schools in the country.

23

law schools that -- that get to that level.

24
25

And there are few State

Now, it's done this by taking only the best
students with the best grades and the best SATs or LSATs

30

1

knowing that the result of this will be to exclude to a

2

large degree minorities.
It is -- it's not unconstitutional to do that,

3
4

because it's -- that's not -- not the purpose of what

5

Michigan did, but it is the predictable result.

6

Nonetheless, Michigan says we want an elite law school.
Now, having created this situation by making

7
8

that decision, it then turns around and says, oh, we have

9

a compelling State interest in eliminating this racial

10

imbalance that we ourselves have created.
Now, if Michigan really cares enough about that

11
12

racial imbalance, why doesn't it do as many other State

13

law schools do, lower the standards, not have a flagship

14

elite law school, it solves the problem.
MS. MAHONEY:

15

Your Honor, I don't think there's

16

anything in this Court's cases that suggests that the law

17

school has to make an election between academic excellence

18

and racial diversity.
QUESTION:

19

The interest here is having a --

If it claims it's a compelling State

20

interest.

21

Constitution's prohibition of racial discrimination, it

22

seems to me it's important enough to override Michigan's

23

desire to have a super-duper law school?

24
25

If it's important enough to override the

MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, the question isn't

whether it's important to override the prohibition on

31

1

discrimination.

It's whether this is discrimination.

2

Michigan -- what Michigan is doing benefits -QUESTION:

3

No, no.

No.

The question is whether

4

or not there is a compelling interest that allows race to

5

be used.

6

MS. MAHONEY:

7

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And Justice Scalia's question is

8

designed to put to you the fact that this isn't a

9

compelling interest, because it's a choice that the

10
11

Michigan law school has made to be like this.
MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, the issue is whether

12

it is sufficiently compelling to allow Michigan to take

13

race into account in this limited fashion in order to

14

provide a much better education for students of all races.

15

The benefits are race neutral, Your Honor, and the burdens

16

are really quite limited.

17

What we're talking about here --

18

QUESTION:

But the question put to you is

19

Michigan has designed its school in a particular way and

20

it doesn't have to do that.

21

MS. MAHONEY:

But Your Honor there is a

22

compelling interest in having an institution that is both

23

academically excellent and richly diverse, because our

24

leaders need to be trained in institutions that are

25

excellent, that are superior academically, but they also

32

1

need to be trained with exposure to the viewpoints, to the

2

prospectives, to the experiences of individuals from

3

diverse backgrounds.
QUESTION:

4
5

But -- but that brings us to the

question of the use of race, which is being used here.
Let me ask you this:

6

Suppose there's a

7

reasonable disagreement as to whether or not the so-called

8

critical mass is, in fact, a disguised quota, you would

9

say it is not.

Suppose there's a reasonable disagreement

10

on that point, if that's so, you lose, is that not

11

correct.
MS. MAHONEY:

12

No, Your Honor, because the

13

district court did not make any factual findings that

14

would support the conclusion that this is a disguised

15

quota.
QUESTION:

16

Is it beyond this Court's capacity to

17

say that?

18

law and fact.

19

certainly -- at least open the possibility that we can

20

disagree with you.

21

It certainly at a minimum a mixed question of
You're arguing here that it isn't.

MS. MAHONEY:

I'm

Well, Your Honor, the -- there has

22

to be evidence in the record that would support the

23

conclusion that it's a quota.

24

said that means is a fixed number -- that is sufficiently

25

rigid that no matter what the qualifications of the

And what this Court has

33

1

applicant pool, the law school is going to adhere to a

2

fixed minimum and I think it's important to say what the

3

judge found on this issue, at 230A of the position of

4

appendix, the judge says in conclusion, the Court finds

5

that the law school wants, 10 to 17 percent of each class

6

to consist of African Americans, Native Americans and

7

Hispanics.

Wants.

That's an aspiration.

8

QUESTION:

It says wants or wants Maureen?

9

MS. MAHONEY:

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. MAHONEY:

Wants.

Wants.

Okay.

Wants, Your Honor.

13

findings that there was a fixed minimum.

QUESTION:

That's an

He made no

Is there in fact a difference between

15

the Michigan plan and the Harvard plan that the Harvard

16

plan is tauted in Bakke, it seems to me, that they were

17

pretty close and is there any suggestion that Michigan is

18

looking for critical mass that Harvard didn't look for?

19

MS. MAHONEY:

Absolutely not, Your Honor. The

20

evidence indicates that the Harvard plan works in exactly

21

the way the Michigan plan does.

22

in this case indicates that under their plan over the last

23

four years, they enrolled eight to 9 percent African

24

Americans which is a stable range.

25

of the record evidence here, the University of Michigan

In fact, Harvard's brief

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

Did Bakke hold that the

Harvard plan was constitutional?

institution?

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, Your Honor.

It held that it was constitutional?
Yes.

What we --

We didn't even -- we didn't even have

the details of the Harvard plan before us?
MS. MAHONEY:

12

Your Honor, in fact, the Court

13

appended -- or Justice Powell appended the Harvard plan to

14

his opinion in this case and there were five votes that

15

the reason that the mandate of the California Supreme

16

Court should be reversed was because there was an

17

effective alternative for -- for enrolling minorities and

18

that effective alternative was a plan like the Harvard

19

plan.

20

And the -- the dissenting --

21

QUESTION:

Did -- did the Court know what --

22

what social scientists have later pointed out and many

23

people knew before it that when the Harvard plan was

24

originally adopted, its purpose was to achieve diversity

25

by reducing the number of Jewish students from New York

that were -- that were -- that were getting into Harvard

on the basis of merit alone?

MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, I don't think that's

the purpose of the Harvard plan that was attached.

10

Did that come up in the course of the

case?

7
8

Your Honor, I don't think that was

Not today, I'm sure.

But -- but --

but that was its origin.
MS. MAHONEY:

11

Your Honor, there is -- there is

12

certainly a major difference between an educational policy

13

that is motivated by an intent to exclude people based on

14

racial animus and one like the Law School's policy and the

15

Harvard plan, which is designed to include students of all

16

races, so that the education of all students will be

17

enriched as a result.

18

QUESTION:

19

MS. MAHONEY:

20

QUESTION:

21
22

But not too many of any race?
Well, Your Honor --

Or not too many of any religion, I

assume?
MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor it is not a question of

23

not too many.

It's that the law school has attempted to

24

take race into account in a very modest limited fashion,

25

no more than necessary to achieve the goal of trying to

36

1

have sufficient numbers of minorities that there can be an

2

excellent educational experience for everyone.

3
4

QUESTION:

But -- but without a quota? Just

sufficient numbers, but that's not a quota?

5

MS. MAHONEY:

6

QUESTION:

Your Honor it is not a quota.

When you say sufficient numbers,

7

you're -- I mean that suggests to me that there is --

8

there is some minimum.

9

has to be some minimum.

10

MS. MAHONEY:

12

QUESTION:

14

But there

But you say there isn't a

minimum?

11

13

Now, you don't name it.

Your Honor there is not a minimum.

Well, then you have to eliminate the

word sufficient.
MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, it -- it can be
In fact, the

15

related to numbers without being a quota.

16

Department of Education in 1979 after Bakke came out,

17

issued a policy interpretation at 44 Federal register

18

58510 which specifically says authorizes schools to

19

establish and pursue numerical goals, end quote, as long

20

as they don't set aside a fixed number of places or make

21

race the sole criterion for eligibility.

22

Department of Education's interpretation.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

That was the

Certainly they don't interpret the

Constitution?
MS. MAHONEY:

No, they don't Your Honor, but

37

1

that is what Bakke held.

2

was at issue in that case, that that was the difference

3

between the program that U C Davis had used and the

4

program that was at issue in the Harvard plan.

5

QUESTION:

That was -- that was the -- what

Is it fair to say that the -- what

6

the -- what -- what Justice Powell and the five who agreed

7

or the four who agreed on the Harvard plan were getting at

8

was that there is a permissible zone between a purely

9

token number and a quota or a set aside and you can shoot

10
11

for something in that zone? Is that a fair -MS. MAHONEY:

Absolutely Your Honor.

What

12

Justice Powell's opinion says when paraphrasing the

13

Harvard plan is that there needs to be an awareness of the

14

necessity for more than token numbers.

15

the educational benefits of diversity can't be achieved.

16

QUESTION:

And that's because

It's hard to see that that's --

17

that's true here, when every day the admission staff looks

18

to see what the numbers are based on race?

19

MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, that's not correct.

20

The -- there is a report which is called The Daily.

21

it is not looked at everyday.

22

it is simply something that can be printed out.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

But

The evidence was clear that

You just have a daily report that

they look at once a week?
MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, the reason it's called

38

1

a daily is that it is a running database that allows for

2

the report to be printed at any time.

3

And -- and the evidence indicated that --

4

QUESTION:

To show how well they're doing in

5

getting the so-called critical mass which is just a

6

synonym for a number?
MS. MAHONEY:

7

Your Honor, the dailies actually

8

track a whole variety of admissions information including

9

deposits, they're trying to see how they're doing in terms

10

of whether -QUESTION:

11

They -- they don't track, as I

12

understand it, the other pluses that the University talks

13

about?
MS. MAHONEY:

14

Well, they track -- they track

15

residency, they track gender, they don't track, for

16

instance, socioeconomic status which is a plus or, in

17

fact, the evidence is uncontradicted that the University

18

takes any racial background, any ethnic background, any

19

unusual characteristic that would add to the diversity of

20

the class into account, but it doesn't find a need to

21

track that, because of the nature of the applicant pool.
QUESTION:

22
23

Is two percent a critical mass, Ms.

Mahoney?

24

MS. MAHONEY:

25

QUESTION:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

Okay.

Four percent?

39

1

MS. MAHONEY:

2

QUESTION:

3

No, Your Honor, what --

You have to pick some number, don't

you?

4

MS. MAHONEY:

5

QUESTION:

6

MS. MAHONEY:

7

QUESTION:

Well, actually what --

Like eight, is eight percent?
Now, Your Honor.

Now, does it stop being a quota

8

because it's somewhere between 8 and 12, but it is a quota

9

if it's 10?

I don't understand that reasoning. Once you

10

use the term critical mass and -- you're -- you're into

11

quota land?
MS. MAHONEY:

12

Your Honor, what a quota is under

13

this Court's cases is a fixed number.

14

fixed number here.

15

the characteristics of the applicant pool.
QUESTION:

16

And there is no

The testimony was that it depends on

As long as you say between 8 and 12,

17

you're okay?

18

between 8 and 12 it's okay, because it's not a fixed

19

number?

20

is?

21

Is that it?

If you said 10 it's bad you but

Is that -- that's what you think the Constitution

MS. MAHONEY:

No, Your Honor, if it was a fixed

22

range that said that it will be a minimum of 8 percent,

23

come hell or high water, no matter what the qualifications

24

of these applicants look like, no matter what it is that

25

the majority applicants could contribute to the benefits

40

1

of diversity, then certainly that would be a quota, but

2

that is not what occurred here.

3

was undisputed, that this was not intended to be a fixed

4

goal.
QUESTION:

5

And in fact the testimony

Ms. Mahoney may I shift focus away

6

from this to another point before you're finished, that I

7

am concerned about.

8

upheld in the area of -- you want to label it affirmative

9

action, there's been a fixed time period within which it

10

would operate. You could see at the end -- an end to it,

11

there is none in this, is there?

12

aspect?

13

In all programs which this Court has

MS. MAHONEY:

How do we deal with that

What the policy says, of course,

14

is that it will only take race into account as long as it

15

is necessary in order to achieve the educational

16

objectives.

17

I don't think that this Court should conclude

18

that this is permanent, because there are two things that

19

can happen that will make this come to an end.

20

is that the number of high-achieving minorities will

21

continue to grow and that law school will be able to

22

enroll a sufficient number to have a critical mass or

23

meaningful numbers or substantial presence without having

24

to take race into account.

25

The first

The second thing that can happen, Your Honor, is

41

1

that we could reach a point in our society where the

2

experience of being a minority did not make such a

3

fundamental difference in their lives, where race didn't

4

matter so much that it's truly salient to the law school's

5

educational mission.

6

While that I can't say when that will happen, we

7

certainly know that as a nation, we have made tremendous

8

progress in overcoming intolerance. And we certainly

9

should expect that that will occur with respect to

10
11
12
13

minorities.
QUESTION:

We approved any other affirmative

action program with such a vague distant termination base?
MS. MAHONEY:

Well, in Bakke itself, Your Honor.

14

In Bakke itself, there were five votes to allow the

15

University of California Davis to use a plan modeled on

16

the Harvard plan.

17

It has reaped extraordinary benefits for this country's

18

educational system.

19
20
21

It's been in effect for about 25 years.

And I think it's far too soon for this Court to
include that -QUESTION:

Can -- can we tell from the

22

statistics whether things have been improved say, more and

23

more minorities are getting in on their own to the

24

University of Michigan Law School without the quotas?

25

MS. MAHONEY:

Yes.

42

1

QUESTION:

2

MS. MAHONEY:

3

Or whether -Yes, they're not quotas, Your

Honor.

4

QUESTION:

The critical mass?

5

MS. MAHONEY:

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. MAHONEY:

We do know -- aspirations --

Aspirations.
-- but we do know Your Honor that

8

there has been improvement, in fact, Justice Powell cited

9

to a study, it was done by Manning it's in footnote 50 of

10

Justice Powell's opinion and it gives the number of

11

minorities who had achieved a 165 and a 3.5 on the LSAT.
QUESTION:

12

How about say the last 15 years, at

13

the University of Michigan, which wasn't being under

14

consideration which Justice Powell's opinion?
MS. MAHONEY:

15

I think the answer would be that

16

we do know that in 1964 when there was a race-blind

17

policy, there were no blacks admitted, and under a

18

race-blind policy today, probably six blacks would be

19

admitted without consideration of race.

20

So there has not been enough progress to allow

21

for meaningful numbers at this point, but there has been

22

progress.

23

QUESTION:

Do we know what's happened in the law

24

schools in California since it was determined by State law

25

affirmative action?

43

1

MS. MAHONEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

We know that for

2

the first -- I think, 4 or 5 years, both only enrolled

3

about -- between I think zero and 7 African-American

4

students.

5

demographics of that State, where it's virtually 50

6

percent Hispanic at the college-age level.

7

have learned is that in the -- they changed their program

8

2 years ago and this fall they succeeded in enrolling 14

9

African-American students, but what we know from talking

They do better on Hispanics because of the

But what we

10

to the law school admissions counsel with Boalt's

11

permission is that the African-Americans who were enrolled

12

under that program have a 9 point LSAT score gap from the

13

whites who have been enrolled, so the same gap --

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Well, there are other law schools in

California, too, are there not?
MS. MAHONEY:

Yes, UCLA, well, this is mainly a

17

problem Your Honor for the highly selective schools

18

because of the nature of the pool.

19
20

QUESTION:

You have some good law schools, you

have UCLA, you have USC?

21

MS. MAHONEY:

22

QUESTION:

23

MS. MAHONEY:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. KOLBO:

UCLA.

SC is private?
Yes.

But UCLA?
UCLA -- UCLA had -- the class that's

44

1

graduatiing this year, for instance, I believe had five

2

blacks in it.

3

we have been told that that's because they were able to

4

recruit some additional numbers of black students because

5

of a special critical race studies program they're

6

offering but that's not a solution to the pool problem,

7

Your Honor.
The pool problem is that if we look at the

8
9

So I believe last fall they did better and

ranges of LSATs where the University of Michigan takes its

10

students, there are literally about 30 in the entire

11

country, three or four per top 10 schools.
So some kind of, you know, race-conscious

12
13

recruiting that schools are using doesn't solve that

14

problem.
And if I could go back to Boalt for just another

15
16

minute, because that is something that the petitioners

17

raised in their reply brief, is that given that we know

18

that they have exactly the same nine-point LSAT gap that

19

Michigan gets under its program, there is no reason to

20

think that what they are doing would satisfy the

21

petitioner's conception of the Equal Protection Clause.
QUESTION:

22
23

That's difficult when it's not in the

record.

24

I do have one more question on this quota point.

25

I don't think the answer that you gave to

45

1

Justice Scalia was in -- in all respects complete. You

2

said well, if -- if there were a program that no matter

3

what you used a somewhat different phrase, no matter what,

4

there would be people taken regardless of qualifications

5

-- that would be a quota.

6

Suppose the pool is large enough so that you can

7

find minorities to fill your 15 percent aspiration. Why

8

isn't that a quota even if they're qualified?

9
10

MS. MAHONEY:
QUESTION:

Because, Your Honor I think --

It seems to me that that was a -- a

11

really a false -- or an improper qualification that you

12

gave to your answer?

13

MS. MAHONEY:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

14

Because I think -- certainly if it's a fixed number that

15

you're going to take no matter what, then that is a quota,

16

but I think the difference between a quota and a goal is

17

the flexibility.

18

And what this Court, for instance, said in

19

Johnson when talking about, they authorized the use of a

20

goal and they said that the line between a goal and a

21

quota is in fact whether or not you have to automatically

22

and blindly promote people in order to meet the goal or

23

whether it is a factor that is taken into account and

24

that's exactly what occurs here.

25

QUESTION:

How does the University determine

46

1

from one year to the next, you say some years it'll come

2

out eight percent, some year nine percent, do they make a

3

conscious decision?
MS. MAHONEY:

4
5

No, Your Honor, the evidence shows

--

6

QUESTION:

Just toss a coin?

7

MS. MAHONEY:

No, it's not tossing a coin, but

8

it is not a fixed number.

What they do is, they look --

9

it's responsive to the applicant pool.

They look at the

10

applicants, they are looking at a variety of factors on a

11

holistic basis and they find the applicants that they

12

think are going to bring the most in toto to the law

13

school class, but it is not measured against a specific

14

numerical target.

15

otherwise.

16
17
18

And the district court did not find

It is simply looking at that pool and what
Michigan is -QUESTION:

Ms. Mahoney, do you know any quota

23

fill the quota.

24

25

All the quota programs I know start off by

I don't know any program that said no

MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor --

47

1

QUESTION:

To establish that kind of a standard

2

for quota is -- is to -- is to just eliminate the -- the

3

whole purpose of -- of that aspect of our law.
MS. MAHONEY:

4

Actually, Your Honor, the way that

5

in Bakke it worked, it wasn't the situation that they

6

would take someone no matter what, but they did have a

7

rule, that you could not be considered for the spaces that

8

had been set aside if you were white. And so it works in a

9

very different way, Your Honor.
There -- Bakke applied, there were four spaces

10
11

available in the special admissions program, but he

12

couldn't be considered for them, because of his race.
That doesn't happen at the University of

13
14

Michigan.

15

doesn't matter how many minorities have been accepted or

16

rejected.

22

That's the defining difference

But they aren't just like every

Some applicants are given a preference because

MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, they are given extra

23

weight in the process, because they have something unusual

24

and important to bring to the class.

that's the way every applicant is considered and --

That's what every --

from race?
MS. MAHONEY:

about diversity.

6

Every applicant is given the chance to

QUESTION:

The law school does --

Ms. Mahoney, how does the Michigan

7

plan differ or the Harvard plan, for that matter, from

8

what was familiar, that is, highly selected schools will

9

reject a certain number of people, take a number of people

10

as automatic acceptance and in the large middle will say,

11

well, we'll -- we'll take people because they're

12

different, because they play the bassoon, because they

13

belong to a minority race?

14

I went to law school, they are female, because we want the

15

class to be diverse and so they used race, they used sex,

16

they used --

Because in the days that when

17

MS. MAHONEY:

18

of Michigan Law School plan does.

19

potential contributions to diversity. And what the

20

evidence shows in this case is that it is common for white

21

applicants to be admitted with lower grades and test

22

scores than even minorities who are rejected because --

23

QUESTION:

That's exactly what the University
It looks at all

Does the Constitution prohibit

24

discrimination against -- against oboe players as opposed

25

to flute players?

49

1

MS. MAHONEY:

2

QUESTION:

3

Does it prohibit discrimination on

the basis of alumna status?

4

MS. MAHONEY:

5

QUESTION:

6

No, Your Honor.

No, Your Honor.

But it does prohibit disrimination on

the basis of race?
MS. MAHONEY:

7

But the question is whether this

8

is prohibited discrimination.

And the answer that we

9

would ask this Court to give is that a minority applicant

10

brings something special.

11

to the white applicant who has the exact same grades and

12

test scores.
QUESTION:

13

They are not similarly situated

Ms. Mahoney, may I ask you a question

14

that is really prompted by Justice O'Connor's question

15

about the terminal point in all of this?

16

hoping some day race will be a totally irrelevant factor

17

in all decisions.

18

of your case is that there's actually -- these programs

19

actually generate racial hostility particularly on the

20

part of the excluded members.

21

ultimate day we are all hoping for.

And we're all

One of the arguments on the other side

And that in turn delays the

22

What is your comment about that?

23

MS. MAHONEY:

The record certainly does not

24

support that inference under this program.

25

is this:

And the reason

The program -- one of the ways to prevent that

50

1

from happening is to have a narrowly tailored program to

2

have very limited consideration of race and not to, for

3

instance, have two great a disparity between the

4

qualifications of the white students who are admitted and

5

the minority students who are admitted under the program.

6

Here it's actually quite limited.

7

vast -- the most -- the most of the minorities who are

8

admitted are in the top 16 percent of all LSAT takers in

9

the country.

10

In fact, you know, the

So we're talking about a really exceptional

group of students.

11

By keeping the relative qualifications fairly

12

close, like that, you really minimize the potential for

13

any kind of stigmatizing or hostility, that sort of thing.

14

And what the record shows is that in the Orfield

15

study which was done of Harvard and University of

16

Michigan's students, it's in the record at Exhibit 167,

17

that there is overwhelming support by the students at

18

Harvard and Michigan Law Schools for maintaining the

19

diversity program, because they regard it as so positive.

20

That's --

21

QUESTION:

Sure, they're in already.

22

MS. MAHONEY:

23

QUESTION:

Your Honor that's for the --

The people you want to talk to are

24

the high school seniors who have seen -- who have seen

25

people visibly less qualified than they are get into

51

1

prestigious institutions where they are rejected.

2

think that is not creating resentment, you are just wrong.

3

MS. MAHONEY:

If you

Well, Your Honor, certainly the

4

minorities who have been admitted under the program are

5

not feeling stigmatized by it.

6

support the program in the ways that they do.

7

addition, the whites who are seeing their performance in

8

the class and who are confirming that they find it highly

9

beneficial to have the -- the chance to share the

10

experiences of the minority students when they are

11

learning about the law, has to be given substantial weight

12

in considering whether this is somehow stigmatizing or

13

perpetuating historic stereotypes, which is really the

14

test that this Court used in VMI to determine whether or

15

not something really should be condemned because of its

16

potential to stigmatize.

17

QUESTION:

If they continue to
In

If Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke

18

can be viewed as, yes, you can use race as a plus factor,

19

where the program is not against anyone, but you cannot go

20

too far, and it says individualized consideration is

21

necessary there, what in your opinion would be going too

22

far, other than quotas?

23

within limits?

24
25

MS. MAHONEY:

How would this be maintained

I think there are really three

things other than a quota to look for.

52

The first is

1

whether there is flexible consideration of the diversity

2

contributions of every potential student, which Michigan

3

program clearly satisfies, whether the minorities who are

4

being admitted are well qualified, because you don't want

5

to have a situation where they can't contribute to the

6

class and can't succeed, and the third is the degree of

7

the burden on the rejected applicants, that's certainly

8

relevant under any narrow tier learning program.

9

here, what the record tells us is that 95 percent of all

10

the admissions decisions that are made each year are not

11

affected by the consideration of race.

And

That the chance -- that there are about 2500

12
13

students who are rejected each year probably only 80 of

14

them would have been -- would have gotten an offer of

15

admission from Michigan under a race-blind system.
That is a very small and diffuse burden. It's

16
17

not one to be minimized.

It's certainly something that

18

the Court has to pay attention to, but this is extremely

19

limited in scope and relative to the benefits to students

20

of all races and to our Nation.

21

the balance and this Court certainly should conclude that

22

the interests that are being served, the legitimate

23

interests that are being served are sufficiently

24

compelling to allow this kind of limited consideration of

25

race.

It has to be weighed in

53

1

QUESTION:

Do we know what would be the increase

2

of the named Plaintiffs, the increase in their chance of

3

admission, were there no affirmative action programs?

4

MS. MAHONEY:

I don't know what the increase for

5

the -- for Barbara Grutter would have been, for instance,

6

we do know that across the class, it would have been

7

approximately 5 percent.

8
9

One might say that that could vary, you know, by
individual.

The record evidence would indicate, however,

10

that Barbara Grutter would not have been admitted under a

11

race-blind program, although that issue has not been

12

litigated to conclusion.

13

QUESTION:

I don't know any other area where we

14

-- where we decide the case by saying well, there are very

15

few people who are being treated unconstitutionally.

16

I mean, if this indeed is an unconstitutional

17

treatment of -- of this woman, because of her race,

18

surely, it doesn't make any difference whether she is one

19

of very few who have been treated unconstitutionally.

20

QUESTION:

I think you can regard that as a

21

statement rather than a question.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

25

Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Kolbo, you have

two minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KIRK KOLBO

54

1
2
3
4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
THE WITNESS:

Thank you, if I may follow-up on

the last question.
Counsel's answer to the last couple of

5

questions, I think, really crystallizes the difference

6

between their position and ours.

7

Michigan sees this as a question of group rights.

8

are rights on the part of minorities.

9

rights -- there are rights on the part of whites and

10
11
12
13

The University of
There

And there are

Asians and other -- other groups.
We see it very differently.

The Constitution

protects the rights of individuals, not racial groups.
The Bakke case opening up 16 spaces in the class

14

when that system was struck down meant that about 2,500

15

students, 2,500 to 3,000 students who had previously been

16

discriminated against now had an opportunity to compete

17

for those seats.

18
19
20

So it seems to me the question is not answered
by how many have been discriminated against.
The question is whether in fact discrimination

21

is occurring against the individual and it certainly is in

22

this particular case.

23

Counsel was asked some questions about the

24

open-ended nature of the policy at issue here.

25

think it's very critical that we understand that if the

55

And I

1

interests that they are asserting here to be compelling is

2

upheld as compelling by this Court, we have in fact the

3

first indefinite, ongoing, unlimited compelling interest.
The Court previously has confined its analysis

4
5

to remedying -- remedying identified discrimination.

6

remedy based on societal discrimination or a role-model

7

theory for example in Wygant.

8

that the Court struck down those rationals was because

9

they were so unlimited, so amorphus, indefinite with

10

A couple of the reasons

respect to time.
That certainly is the case with the interest

11
12

A

that is being urged here today.
And it seems to me that that is -- it becomes

13
14

very clear in the University's argument that what they've

15

done -- and they didn't argue so much this in the lower

16

court, but they made it very clear that their

17

justification for the preferences is based in effect on

18

remedying societal discrimination.
Their argument and their briefs and in this

19
20

Court has been that when the day comes, someday and maybe

21

it will come someday, we hope that it will, that someday

22

that we will be able to stop using race for these

23

purposes.

24
25

And the opinion that accepted that rationale it
seems to me would be a dramatic step backward from this

56

1

Court's precedents which have rejected the notion that

2

something as amorphus as societal discrimination would be

3

sufficient.
