ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA R. ESKOW

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. ESKOW:

9
10

Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
When parties knowingly and voluntarily proceed

11
12

to trial before a magistrate judge, they consent within

13

the meaning of 28 U.S.C. section 636(c)(1).

14

language of the statute confers case-dispositive authority

15

on full-time magistrate judges upon the consent of the

16

parties.

17

form that consent should take.

18

adjectives such as express or written, and the omission of

19

such qualifiers is significant.

The plain

Congress did not specify in section 636 what

20

QUESTION:

21

MS. ESKOW:

It did not include

How about Rule 73(b)?
Yes, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice,

22

Rule 73 does require that the parties execute a consent

23

form filed with the court, and it did not occur in this

24

case.

25

However, a violation of that rule did not divest

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the magistrate judge of authority to preside over the

2

case, and that is because the authority emanates from the

3

statute, specifically the requirement that the consent be

4

voluntary in 636(c)(1), and although it was error not to

5

follow the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure or the local

6

rules for the Southern District of Texas, which may have

7

had writing requirements, these rules were related to

8

procedural safeguards to protect the voluntariness of the

9

parties.

They are not the consent requirement themselves,

10

and it is the voluntariness of the agreement that gives a

11

magistrate judge authority to preside, not compliance with

12

technicalities of statutory referral procedures.

13
14

QUESTION:

Do you agree that the consent has to

precede the action of the magistrate?

15

MS. ESKOW:

Yes, Justice Stevens, we do.

16

QUESTION:

So that there had to have been

17

consent before he took any -- the magistrate took any

18

action in the case?

19
20

MS. ESKOW:
section 636(c) --

21

QUESTION:

22

MS. ESKOW:

23
24
25

Any case-dispositive actions under

Yes.
-- yes, that would have to be with

the consent of the parties.
QUESTION:

So that an hour into the trial,

somebody hands counsel a note that says, Your Honor, we've

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

made a mistake, our office said we can't consent to this,

2

the trial, the magistrate should say, too late, you've

3

appeared, you've been deemed to have given consent?

4

MS. ESKOW:

5

QUESTION:

6
7

Yes.

Yes, Justice Kennedy.

So it's like double jeopardy when

this first witness is sworn, or something like that?
MS. ESKOW:

Well, certainly, consent in our view

8

is predicated on two things, and first it's notice that

9

the magistrate judge is proceeding in this case­

10

dispositive authority, and notice that the party has an

11

opportunity to decline to consent to that procedure.

12
13
14

QUESTION:

So the first dispositive motion that

he rules on?
MS. ESKOW:

Certainly, that would be a signal,

15

and yes, if a party did not object at that point, after

16

being on notice that the magistrate judge was exercising

17

case-dispositive authority.

18

QUESTION:

Well, then, we need a whole

19

jurisprudence parallel to the simple rules that you all

20

didn't follow.

21

MS. ESKOW:

22

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, Your Honor?

The --

We need a whole jurisprudence that's

23

parallel to the simple rule.

The -- the object of the

24

rule was structural, in a sense.

25

the parties that they had a choice, to make them consider

It was to bring home to

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the choice, to make sure that the choice was not in any

2

way forced on them or suggested to them, and it seems to

3

me that your rule defeats all of that.
MS. ESKOW:

4

We would respectfully disagree,

5

Justice Kennedy.

Absolutely, the rule is designed to

6

protect the voluntariness of the parties' consent and to

7

ensure that they aren't coerced into agreeing to a

8

procedure and into relinquishing their right to an

9

Article III judge when it's not something that they

10

voluntarily choose to do, but those are merely the

11

procedures to protect the consent.
The consent itself is the predicate for the

12
13

exercise of the authority, and although there was a

14

departure from the local rules, and in this instance, it

15

was not merely on the part of two defendants who neglected

16

to file a form but on the part of plaintiff Withrow, who

17

neglected to obtain all parties' consent, as was his

18

responsibility under the local rules -QUESTION:

19
20
21
22
23

Was he represented at the trial,

Withrow?
MS. ESKOW:

No, Justice Ginsburg.

He -- he was

pro -- he was pro se at that time.
QUESTION:

So -- so your rule is that a pro se

24

defendant has to tell the State of Texas how to comply

25

with the Federal rules?

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. ESKOW:

No, Justice Kennedy.

Certainly,

2

that was just an indication of the various mishaps that

3

can happen because of the nature of the varying local

4

requirements that exist in different districts.

5

had in this instance a district judge who referred the

6

case to the magistrate before the defendants had even been

7

served, much less had an opportunity to consent, and the

8

magistrate judge did not comply with local practice of

9

confirming on the record all parties' consent --

You also

10

QUESTION:

But she was -- she --

11

QUESTION:

Well, can -- can local rules in one

12

district produce a different result than another district

13

which didn't have that local review with respect to this

14

sort of consent?

15

MS. ESKOW:

Absolutely not, Mr. Chief Justice.

16

In -- in this circumstance, certainly that authority

17

emanates from the statute itself, and a local rule can't

18

determine the authority of the magistrate judge.

19

would apply nationally, and in every court, but --

20

QUESTION:

That

This local rule did require

21

express -- it required consent in writing before the --

22

the proceeding, didn't it?

23

MS. ESKOW:

Yes, before even the case could be

24

referred the local requirement existed, but that was

25

departed from both by the clerk, who provided a form to

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the district judge before it had been signed by the

2

parties, and by the district judge himself, who referred

3

the case without waiting for all parties' consent, or even

4

all parties' service.
QUESTION:

5
6

Do -- do we know how this came about,

because the magistrate, she was certainly aware of it.

7

MS. ESKOW:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Absolutely.
And she asked the State, do you

consent, and whoever was representing the State said,
well, I have no authority to do that today.
MS. ESKOW:

11

That was at a preliminary

12

proceeding, Justice Ginsburg, a Spears hearing, that was to

13

determine whether or not plaintiff Withrow's claim should

14

even be permitted to proceed, or whether he should be

15

permitted to proceed in forma pauperis and whether service

16

would be affected.

17

point.

18

whether this prisoner suit should be allowed to proceed,

19

and at that time there was a representative of the

20

Attorney General's Office present at the hearing, merely

21

in an informational capacity, but none of the defendants

22

had been served, and they were not yet represented, so she

23

indicated at that hearing that she could not consent on

24

their behalf.

25

No defendant had been served at that

It was an evaluation under section 1915(a) of

Later on, after that hearing, when it was

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

determined that some claims could proceed, there was

2

service on the defendants, and that was effected on a

3

different Attorney General, who in turn assigned it to the

4

Attorney General -- the Assistant Attorney General who did

5

represent the defendants at trial and filed answers on

6

their behalf, and -- and that attorney did neglect to file

7

the required forms.
However, at the time of service, the case had

8
9

already been referred, and he did not go back to confirm

10

whether previously the forms were on file, but everyone in

11

this proceeding was assuming that all the parties

12

consented because the case was already before the

13

magistrate judge, and everyone was acting in accordance

14

with a section 636(c)(1) referral.

15

referral order that the district judge signed that sent

16

the case to the magistrate judge, it specified that if the

17

defendants did not consent, they merely needed to indicate

18

that to the court and it would go back to the district

19

judge, so certainly there was an awareness that the case

20

was proceeding pursuant to the dispositive, case­

21

dispositive provisions in subsection (c).
QUESTION:

22
23
24
25

Indeed, in the

And one of the defendants did put in

a form.
MS. ESKOW:

Yes, who was represented by separate

counsel, and that counsel did follow the instructions from

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the court and -- and did comply, and that was not complied

2

with by the attorney who was representing the two

3

defendants at trial in this case, but everything that that

4

attorney did was consistent with and demonstrated the

5

parties' consent in this instance, including filing a

6

dispositive motion with the -- the court that the

7

magistrate judge could grant only if she had authority

8

under subsection (c), and only if she had the parties'

9

consent, and when she denied that motion and made that

10

adverse ruling, that she could only do with the parties'

11

consent, these defendants never once objected, they did

12

not dispute that they consented, instead, they asked her

13

to reconsider the merits of their summary judgment motion.

14

QUESTION:

Ms. Eskow, the statute, 636(c)(2),

15

deals with the clerk of the court shall notify the parties

16

of the availability of a magistrate, and then it goes on

17

to say, the decision of the parties shall be communicated

18

to the clerk of the court.

19

to the clerk suggest that it be express?

20

requirement?

21

Does the use of communicated
What is that

How does that enter in?

MS. ESKOW:

Certainly, communicated to -- to the

22

clerk suggests that -- that the clerk will be informed of

23

the decision.

24

that invoked, affirmatively invoked the case-dispositive

25

authority, that was before the clerk and would have

When the parties filed a dispositive motion

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

notified the clerk that they were --

2

QUESTION:

And satisfied that requirement?

3

MS. ESKOW:

It would, and moreover, it's

4

subsection (1) that discusses the authority of the

5

magistrate judge --

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. ESKOW:

Yes.
-- and speaks only of consent that

8

is the provision of the statute in which Congress gave

9

this grant of authority.

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. ESKOW:

Yes.
Subsection (2) is a procedural

12

mechanism for ensuring the voluntariness, that's the

13

requirement under subsection (1).
QUESTION:

14
15

And was it complied with here fully,

do you think --

16

MS. ESKOW:

With subsection --

17

QUESTION:

-- subsection (2)?

18

MS. ESKOW:

Subsection (2), in this instance,

19

no.

Because of the local procedures that are requested

20

the district courts develop under subsection (2), they

21

were not complied with by any of the parties or any of the

22

judges in this case, so there was a departure, but because

23

there was full compliance of subsection (1), in that the

24

parties all voluntarily agreed, absolutely there was

25

authority to proceed.

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

May I just ask you a technical

2

question about the local rule?

3

it was referred to, it was referred to not as rule, but as

4

order.

5

this order was, it had the status of a local rule for

6

purposes of this case?

I -- as I recall, wherever

Does everybody in the case agree that whatever

7

MS. ESKOW:

Yes, Justice Souter.

That is not

8

disputed by any of the parties.

9

mechanism by which the Southern District of Texas

That is just the

10

implemented it as a general order.

11

writing, it is signed by the judges of the court, the

12

chief judge of the court, and it's something that is

13

respected by all parties as being the local rule in that

14

case.

15

It is printed in

Congress' intent not to require any specified

16

form of consent is evidenced by the language in (c)(1)

17

itself, where the first provision is -- for full-time

18

magistrate judges does not require any form of written

19

consent, it merely speaks to consent.

20

sentence of the statute, which is on page 3a of the

21

appendix in the petitioners' brief on the merits, the

22

statute specifies that for part-time magistrate judges,

23

there has to be a specific written request by the parties

24

in order for the magistrate judge to exercise case­

25

dispositive authority, and the fact that Congress in the

In the very next

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

very next sentence chose to insert and to require a

2

written consent indicates that Congress did not intend to

3

make the same sort of requirement with respect to

4

full-time magistrate judges, because that adjective is --

5

is lacking, and the Court should not engraft terms onto

6

the statute that Congress chose not to include.
QUESTION:

7

I take it from your argument this

8

morning you would say that these defendants -- suppose

9

they lost.

Suppose the plaintiff won.

They could not

10

then say, magistrate, you never had any authority because

11

we did not give you in advance written permission to

12

proceed.

13

your view?

14

They could not -- they would be bound.

MS. ESKOW:

Is that

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, if the court

15

were to adopt an inferred consent rule and -- and

16

determine consent based on the parties' voluntary conduct

17

beforehand, and there was notice, and there was a clear

18

indication of conforming to 636(c) --

19
20
21

QUESTION:
hypothetically.

But I'm not asking the question

I'm asking, in this case.

MS. ESKOW:

In this case?

Yes, my understanding

22

is that no party had -- had even thought, it had not

23

crossed any party's mind that consent was lacking and that

24

all parties were intending to be bound by the judgment.

25

QUESTION:

But if the defendants, having lost

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

instead of having prevailed, then said, aha, now we can

2

get out of it because we never formalized our consent,

3

you -- you are saying that they could not have -- that on

4

these, on the facts of this case they could not have bowed

5

out if they lost?

6

MS. ESKOW:

Yes, Your Honor.

We believe that

7

that is the -- the correct approach.

8

Seventh and Eleventh Circuits, where those courts require

9

express post judgment consent separate and apart from

10

looking at the underlying conduct, in those situations

11

there is not an effective judgment if the parties refuse

12

to put express consent on the record after the fact.

13

Certainly, in the

That is certainly one approach to the statute.

14

It's one approach that we believe is valid, because

15

requiring that express consent at some point in the

16

proceedings to confirm the earlier conduct is something

17

that -- that would protect the voluntariness concerns

18

Congress had, but we don't believe that it's required

19

in -- in terms of the authority, that the authority comes

20

from the voluntary agreement that's evidenced from how the

21

parties proceeded, and certainly, if the Court wished to

22

avoid the gaming concerns that the Fifth Circuit expressed

23

under the type of post judgment consent rule that the

24

Seventh and Eleventh Circuits adopted, then adopting an

25

inferred consent rule would eliminate that by requiring

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

parties to be bound by the bargain they struck.
QUESTION:

2

Ms. Eskow, I take it all of the

3

courts of appeals that have addressed this question have

4

found express consent required?

5

MS. ESKOW:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, that's

6

absolutely true, but there's nothing in the statute that

7

makes that requirement.

8

Federal Magistrates Act, the provision governing

9

misdemeanor trial authority, that's in 18 U.S.C. section

Indeed, another provision of the

10

3401(b), requires not -- it used to require written

11

consent.

12

only oral consent, but it specified that it could be oral

13

or written, but that it needed to be express.

14

expressly consents, are in that provision, and certainly

15

neither the word express, nor the word oral or written,

16

exist in 636(c)(1).

17

QUESTION:

In 1996, Congress amended the act to require

The words,

You suggested earlier that the second

18

sentence of -- of (c) -- of (c)(1) contains the written --

19

the writing request, whereas the first second -- sentence

20

doesn't.

21

MS. ESKOW:

22

QUESTION:

Yes.
But the writing request in the second

23

sentence is a request for the -- the magistrate to

24

participate, rather than the consent itself.

25

upon the consent of the parties pursuant to this specific

It says,

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

written request.

There's no requirement of writing with

2

respect to the request in the first sentence, but that

3

doesn't necessarily disavow the need for writing in the --

4

to evidence the consent itself.

5

MS. ESKOW:

We would read the statute

6

differently, Justice Stevens, that the fact that it says,

7

upon the consent of the parties pursuant to their specific

8

request, would indicate that the consent of the parties

9

has to be pursuant to their written request.
QUESTION:

10

That's right, but there doesn't have

11

to be a written request with respect to the first

12

sentence.

13

other -- the way your opponent does it, there just has to

14

be a writing evidencing the consent itself.

There just has to be -- if one reads it the

15

MS. ESKOW:

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. ESKOW:

We would respectfully disagree.
Yes.
That the writing requirement only

18

exists with respect to the part-time magistrate judge, and

19

that that goes to the consent as well.

20

QUESTION:

That's not expressed.

I'm saying,

21

that's not expressed, but I'm just saying that it's not --

22

it's not -- the two -- the writing requirement that is

23

referred to in the second sentence is not an exact

24

parallel of what they contend the -- the writing

25

requirement is in the first sentence.

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. ESKOW:

Well, certainly respondent has a

2

variety of writing requirements, and one that they deem to

3

be dictated by the local rules as well, which is something

4

that's not spoken to in subsection (c)(1).

5

the -- the statute in (c)(1) imposes no sort of express or

6

written requirement with respect to consent or with

7

respect to requesting a magistrate judge --

8

QUESTION:

9

MS. ESKOW:

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. ESKOW:

Certainly,

Well, of course, that's the issue.
-- in any form.
Yes, that's the issue.
And the absence of that we believe

12

is significant because -- in these other provisions

13

because in the misdemeanor trial authority, it requires

14

consent, and is probably the closest analogy to the trial

15

authority in subsection (c)(1).

16

consent required, and it specifies that it can be oral or

17

written.

18

QUESTION:

There is both express

The obvious reading of a statute like

19

this I would think, and you tell me why I'm not right, but

20

it just means consent in such form as the judicial

21

conference or local rules provide.

22

perfectly aware in these procedural statutes that judges

23

have rulemaking authority and that they elaborate the

24

statute through rule.

25

MS. ESKOW:

I mean, Congress is

Certainly, Congress is aware of

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

common sense meaning of consent, and in substance -QUESTION:

Well, it's also aware that they're

3

writing a statute for the judiciary that's implemented

4

through rule, and where you have a term like this, that is

5

implemented through rule, that everybody would think it

6

would be implemented through rule, the word consent in the

7

statute means consent in the form that the rules provide.

8

Does Congress have to add that every time in -- I mean,

9

isn't it obvious?

10

Or perhaps it isn't, but why isn't it?

MS. ESKOW:

We don't believe it's obvious,

11

Justice Breyer, because if it was the form of the local

12

rules, or the form of consent prescribed by local rules

13

that determined the authority, you would have magistrate

14

judges with different authority in a variety of

15

jurisdictions across the country.

16

QUESTION:

So what's wrong with that?

I mean,

17

if the local rule is okay, what's wrong with that, I mean,

Certainly it may be a good idea as a

It's a matter of law.

Very often,

24

Congress legislates, and they use words like consent, and

25

so forth, and those are implemented.

I don't want to just

1

repeat the point.

2

can --

I want to be -- I want to see what you

MS. ESKOW:

3

Certainly, our view is that because

4

Congress specified the requirements for local rules in a

5

separate subsection than the consent requirement itself,

6

it was anticipating that there would be some need to

7

protect the voluntariness, but that it is the

8

voluntariness that's the cornerstone, and that it would be

9

a matter of administrative discretion on the local level.
QUESTION:

10
11

Assume you lose on that, just for the

sake of argument.

12

MS. ESKOW:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.
Then I guess the other question is

14

whether you can cure the violation by not objecting on

15

appeal.

16

MS. ESKOW:

That certainly is the question.

17

QUESTION:

And what is your answer to that?

18

MS. ESKOW:

19

QUESTION:

20

MS. ESKOW:

The -- yes, absolutely.
Because?
Because the underlying voluntary

21

consent is there through the parties' conduct, and to the

22

extent the court construes the statute --

23

QUESTION:

No, no, I'm saying, suppose that

24

there is not consent.

Suppose I were to believe that the

25

word consent in the statute picks up the method of the

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

rule, at least it rules out implied consent, so suppose I

2

held against you on that point, then still you'd say, we

3

win anyway, because we can waive this requirement by just

4

not objecting on appeal.

5

When -- when the other side appeals it we say,

6

we don't care, or when you appeal it the other side says,

7

we don't care.

8

happens then?

We consent now.

We consent now to what

9

MS. ESKOW:

Well, certainly --

10

QUESTION:

Now what, about that?

11

MS. ESKOW:

Assuming there is a violation of --

12

of the rule, and that their consent is not lacking, the

13

question is, what is the consequence for noncompliance

14

with the rule, and certainly the failure to comply with

15

these procedures, for that to be an automatic grounds for

16

reversal would be a deviation from accepted practice,

17

which is a party has to object to a proceeding, has to

18

preserve error, and here, no party objected, and it is

19

their personal right to the Article III judge.

20

their personal consent --

It is

QUESTION:

But the argument is --

22

MS. ESKOW:

-- that is at stake.

23

QUESTION:

24

basic jurisdictional problem.

25

not go out on the street, pick the third person whom you

-- of course, that you can't cure a
You -- both parties could

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

see and say, you decide our case, and then you appeal his

2

decision, and when somebody says, who's that person, you

3

say, we waive all the claims that he isn't a judge.

4

MS. ESKOW:

Well, certainly, if Congress had not

5

provided for a scheme that existed, and the parties

6

randomly invoked the authority of a person on the street,

7

that would be a problem, but here, you have a magistrate

8

judge who has been specifically assigned by Congress to

9

perform this function and has been designated by the

10

district judge of the court, and the only question is,

11

have the parties agreed, and if -- and if no party objects

12

to that and the magistrate judge enters the final

13

judgment, even if there's been noncompliance with the

14

rules, the question is, what is the harm, and even --

15
16
17

QUESTION:

So you say basically this isn't

jurisdictional in the strict sense of the word?
MS. ESKOW:

No.

No, Your Honor, absolutely not.

18

It's not a question of subject matter jurisdiction.

19

term, jurisdiction, solely is a question of authority of

20

the powers of the magistrate judge to act.

21

QUESTION:

Do you think it's like personal

22

jurisdiction, or more -- it's more like personal

23

jurisdiction or subject matter --

24

MS. ESKOW:

25

QUESTION:

The

It's more -Because if you say personal, then you

have on your side the rule that a general appearance,

2

general -- as a --

MS. ESKOW:

4

QUESTION:

MS. ESKOW:

Absolutely.
-- as a rule waives deficiencies.
And that it can be waived

6

inadvertently, even by failing to timely assert the

7

person --

8
9

QUESTION:

My question is why, because the

argument that it is like a person on the street is that a

10

magistrate who is not an Article III judge is going to

11

preside over a jury trial, and the result of that trial

12

will have all the trappings and -- and dignity and

13

enforcement power of a judgment of a court of the United

14

States, and the only way this could possibly occur is if

15

the parties consent, particularly since it's a jury trial,

16

and where they don't consent, he really is like a person

17

off the street, because of the importance of what the

18

parties are giving up in order to obtain his judgment

19

rather than that of an Article III judge.

20
21
22

All right, now that's the other side's argument.
Now, I want to know how you respond.
MS. ESKOW:

Well, certainly in Peretz versus

23

United States this Court considered a circumstance where,

24

in a felony trial, a magistrate judge was supervising the

25

voir dire, and the defendant's counsel did not make any

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

objection to that when it went on, and this Court

2

determined, both from a personal litigant Article III

3

perspective, as well as from a structural perspective,

4

that there was no infirmity in that procedure, and that a

5

defendant who does not assert his right to an Article III

6

judge has no cognizable right that he can enforce, and

7

that would be the same circumstance here, for the same

8

reasons why the felony voir dire was permissible without

9

objection of the defendant in Peretz versus United States.
Here, without objection from the parties, with

10
11

their fully informed knowledge of the nature of the

12

proceedings, and their proceeding through judgment

13

affirmatively invoking the authority of the judge, it is

14

directly parallel to the situation in Peretz versus United

15

States, and certainly the litigants waived their personal

16

Article III right to a district judge, and the same

17

structural protections that this Court deemed sufficient

18

in Peretz also would exist here, because the magistrate

19

judge is appointed, or direct -- referred the case only by

20

the district judge, the district judge can at any point in

21

time, sua sponte, for good cause, take the referral back

22

from the magistrate judge, and -- and supervises the

23

process.

24

concerns that --

25

That insulates it from separations of powers

QUESTION:

One of -- one of the insulating

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

features in the suggested form and the rules of civil

2

procedure makes it express that the consent form is not to

3

be communicated to the judge or the magistrate in order to

4

protect the attorneys who don't consent so that the

5

magistrate or the judge doesn't know which party doesn't

6

consent, and your rule completely destroys that.
MS. ESKOW:

7

No, Your Honor.

We -- in this

8

instance, certainly if the parties are voluntarily

9

proceeding with knowledge, a magistrate judge would be

10

aware that they were going forward and that there are

11

rules that inferred consent is what satisfies the statute,

12

then yes, a magistrate judge would know when a party, upon

13

notice both of their right to object and of the nature of

14

proceeding, invoked the affirmative authority, yes, the

15

magistrate judge at that time would know that the parties

16

have made the dissent.
QUESTION:

17

Well, no, but you -- you presume a

18

regime in which the magistrate said, I'm ready to proceed,

19

and you -- somebody stands up and says, well, I don't

20

consent.

21

to adopt, so that -- that destroys the confidentiality.

I mean, that's -- that's the regime you want us

MS. ESKOW:

22

Well, certainly in many

23

circumstances the -- the local rules do provide for the

24

communication to the clerk, and that is what Rule 73

25

provides.

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

As a matter of practice, however, in 1990,

2

Congress relaxed the consent provisions to permit

3

discussions between the district judge and the magistrate

4

judge about consent, that they could remind the parties

5

that they could consent to a magistrate judge, and that

6

that was a topic that could be discussed in -- in the

7

courtroom provided that there was no coercion to consent.

8

If -QUESTION:

9
10
11

do that?

Where did -- where did the Congress

You say the Congress did that?
MS. ESKOW:

In 1990, Congress amended subsection

12

(c)(2) to loosen the consent requirements, and certainly

13

it still anticipated that the decision is going to go to

14

the clerk of court, but magistrate judges and district

15

judges are not prohibited from discussing the matter of a

16

referral with the parties, and if a party failed to sign

17

the requisite form, certainly there'd be no -- no

18

prejudice by proceeding to inform the judge at the time

19

that the issue came up that they did consent, and

20

certainly, to -- to wait until the eve of trial, when

21

every indication was that they had consented, and to

22

withdraw it at that point, an inferred consent rule would

23

be more consistent with holding the parties to the benefit

24

of their bargain.

25

QUESTION:

May I just make one -- ask you one

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

clarifying question for me?

Is it your position that

it -- it is not necessary either to consent in advance, or

3

to have the consent in writing?

that you do have to consent.

MS. ESKOW:

No, Your Honor, the -- only a

finding that they did not expressly consent.

12

clearly had implied their consent by their conduct, but

deemed implied consent insufficient.

The statutory provision that you --

20

MS. ESKOW:

21

QUESTION:

Well -So Congress basically talked about

22

this discussion process against the backdrop of a consent

23

form that had already been communicated to the clerk.

24
25

MS. ESKOW:

We would disagree, Justice Kennedy.

The legislative history actually indicates that the -- the

provision was intended to enable the district judge and

the magistrate judges to inform --

QUESTION:

4

MS. ESKOW:

But that's not what the statute says.
-- to inform the parties of the

5

availability, irrespective of whether they had actually

district judges believed that they -- they could not go on

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMANDA FROST

14

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

15
16

MS. FROST:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
All parties must expressly consent before a

17
18

magistrate may exercise jurisdiction under section 636(c).

19

First and foremost, this is because the text of the

20

Magistrates Act and Rule 73(b) require express consent.

21

In addition -QUESTION:

22
23

consent.

Oh, the text does not require express

I beg to differ.

24

MS. FROST:

25

QUESTION:

I'd like to -It does not.

I think that's how you

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

want us to interpret it, but I don't think the word is

2

there, is it?
MS. FROST:

3

The word, express, is not there,

4

Your Honor.

5

like to point Your Honor -- Your Honor to some of the

6

provisions of 636(c) which strongly indicate that the

7

consent must be expressed.
QUESTION:

What part of 73(b) uses the word

express?
MS. FROST:

73(b) refers -- it does not use the

word express, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

So then neither the statute nor the

rule use the term express, as you suggested earlier.
MS. FROST:

Neither use the term, express.

Rule

15

73(b) refers to the -- that the parties shall execute and

16

file a consent form.

17

that obviously must be express.

18

be possible to file in writing a consent without that

19

being express.

20

consent is required, and I used the word express only

21

because this Court need not go that far in this case,

22

because these -- the petitioners here not only failed to

23

file their consent in writing, as 73 requires, but they

24

also failed to articulate consent at all, and -- and so

25

there is no need to reach the -- the question of whether a

That is a written form of consent
It couldn't -- wouldn't

It is our position here that written

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

consent must be in writing.
QUESTION:

2

Well, it could be implied.

That's

3

the question of whether the consent, if it is required, as

4

it appears to be, could be implied, and if there ever were

5

a case for implying consent, this is that case.
MS. FROST:

6

I -- I respectfully disagree, Your

7

Honor.

For example, I think that everything that these

8

petitioners did was as consistent with an intent to

9

withhold consent as to give consent, and I'd like to show

10

you as an example the motion for summary judgment that was

11

filed in this case that petitioners have pointed to as

12

being evidence of clear consent.

13

Honorable Judge of the District Court, and it was

14

submitted to the clerk.

15

review a motion for summary judgment under 636(b) without

16

the parties' consent, so nothing that the petitioners did

17

by submitting this motion indicated their -- their intent

18

to consent to these proceedings.

QUESTION:

20

MS. FROST:

21

In addition, a magistrate may

Yes, there certainly was, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

They -- they did participate in the

trial.

24

MS. FROST:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.
So even if filing that motion did not

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

give implied consent, perhaps it could be argued that

2

simply participating in the trial gave it.

3

MS. FROST:

Yes, Your Honor, that is

4

petitioners' argument, and the reason I think that

5

argument cannot be -- is not in accord with the language

6

of the Magistrates Act is, first of all, consent is used

7

consistently throughout the act to be -- to mean an

8

express statement.

9

magistrate may come out of retirement and serve again upon

For example, in 636(h), a retired

10

the consent of the -- of the chief judge of the district

11

court, and I don't think even petitioners would argue that

12

that consent could be implied in the sense that the chief

13

judge never said or wrote that the retired judge --

14

QUESTION:

But it's used in a little bit
It requires basically the

15

different sense there.

16

permission of the chief judge, which you know, I think

17

you're quite right in saying that that would not be

18

satisfied by simply doing nothing, but in -- in a case

19

where you're talking about an agreement, I -- I think

20

it's -- the law is different in some -- in some respects.

21

MS. FROST:

Well, I respectfully disagree, Your

22

Honor, because both provisions, 636(h) and 636(c)(1) use

23

the term, upon consent, and I think that where Congress

24

used the same term throughout the statute, it should be

25

interpreted to have the same meaning, but that's not the

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

only provision I rely on.
There's the fact that the Congress thought

3

consent would be communicated to the parties.

4

fact that Congress said, upon consent, meaning consent

5

must come first.

6

come first, if what Congress meant was, simply by showing

7

up once the magistrate starts exercising that authority,

8

we are going to consider you to have consented.

9

There's the

It makes no sense to say, consent must

QUESTION:

Why not?

If -- Justice Kennedy

10

brought up the analogy to personal jurisdiction.

11

makes a general appearance just by showing up in court,

12

then any question of whether the court would otherwise

13

have jurisdiction is gone, because there is jurisdiction,

14

personal jurisdiction by consent, just by making a general

15

appearance, so why isn't showing up in that magistrate's

16

courtroom, going to trial without objecting, why isn't

17

that equivalent to a general appearance?

18

MS. FROST:

If one

Justice Ginsburg, the answer to your

19

question is that there is in the Federal Rules of Civil

20

Procedure Rule 12, which says that showing up will be

21

waiving your right, and here we have a statute that

22

requires consent, and it's important to look at why

23

Congress wanted that.

24

that consent be voluntary, willing, and knowing.

25

Petitioners agree, and the question is, what is the best

Congress was clearly very concerned

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

way to protect that?

2

and ensures that it is voluntary.
QUESTION:

3

Express consent protects the consent

I could understand that in the

4

abstract.

In the concrete, as applied to this case, if

5

the plaintiff, the pro se plaintiff didn't consent and

6

then lost, I could see an argument there, but this is the

7

State Attorney General, and when they show up and they go

8

to trial, it seems to me it's reasonable to imply that

9

they have consented.

10

MS. FROST:

I think not, Your Honor, for a few

11

reasons.

12

stopped these parties from -- from arguing after the fact

13

that they hadn't intended to consent, and there's no

14

evidence as a result of the fact that the counsel

15

failed to specifically consent --

16

First of all, there is nothing that would have

QUESTION:

Well, how -- how could they have made

17

that argument in this case, say, well, we just forgot

18

about the rule, we didn't know, or --

19

MS. FROST:

20

QUESTION:

The argument they would make is -I -- I just can't imagine what the

21

State Attorney General would say, after having

22

participated in a trial and say, well you know, I really

23

didn't consent.

24
25

MS. FROST:

I think that what the State Attorney

General would say was, I had not realized that my -- I had

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

not realized that I had not checked with my clients, that

2

I had not -- because the State Attorney General took this

3

case over, he -- he could say, I had not realized that my

4

clients had not already agreed to do this, they have a

5

right to an Article III judge.

6

QUESTION:

7
8

Well, but it -- I mean, who -- who is

the Attorney General's client except State officials?
MS. FROST:

Well, I think, Your Honor -- that's

9

true, Your Honor, but these questions go to the question

10

of whether Congress intended different consent standards

11

for different parties, and also to the question of whether

12

Congress would want this kind of satellite litigation on

13

the question of consent.

14

I think it is telling that these -- that the

15

petitioners in this case, when asked whether they

16

consented, said they could not, never consented, the

17

documents they submitted to the district court were

18

captioned to the district court, they did not indicate

19

that they intended to go before a magistrate.

20

Congress have wanted courts to have to deal with the

21

satellite litigation of parties arguing whether they did

22

or didn't consent?

Would

23

QUESTION:

But Ms. Frost --

24

QUESTION:

Well, once this --

25

QUESTION:

-- you're asking them to engage in

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

much more than satellite litigation over consent.

2

result of your position is that there will be a whole new

3

trial, so it's going to engage the court much more than

4

making a determination whether, in fact, the State

5

officials consented by appearing before the magistrate,

6

so -MS. FROST:

7

The

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that is true

8

in this case, but if the rule is explicit consent rather

9

than inferred consent, and if that is established as the

10

rule, then there will be far fewer occasions on which

11

mistakes are made.
QUESTION:

12
13

But it was the -- but it was the

local rule.

14

MS. FROST:

15

QUESTION:

Yes.
And it -- and -- so we're dealing

16

with only the consequences, and I could see if this were a

17

big question of subject matter jurisdiction, you'd say

18

that the parties can't waive that, but this kind of rule

19

is at a much lower level.
MS. FROST:

20

Well, I respectfully disagree, Your

21

Honor.

I think that, both throughout the Magistrates Act

22

and the legislative history, Congress referred to section

23

636(c) as an expansion of the magistrate's jurisdiction to

24

act, and that jurisdiction can only be invoked upon the

25

consent of the parties.

34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

No, but if you're saying that that

2

jurisdiction is on the level, as I think you are, on the

3

level with subject matter jurisdiction --

4

MS. FROST:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- then it seems to me you've proved

6

too much, because if it were -- if Congress were assuming

7

it was on that level, Congress wouldn't have done this in

8

the first place.

9

jurisdiction, and you can't consent to it by filing

10

written forms before trial, so we've got to make the

11

assumption, just as Justice Ginsburg did in her question,

12

that we're dealing with an interest which Congress viewed

13

at a very lower level.

14

You can't consent to subject matter

MS. FROST:

I respectfully disagree, Justice
It's not a question of consenting

15

to subject matter jurisdiction, it's a question of what

did Congress say are the limits of the magistrate's --

No, but I mean, we -- I'll -- I'll

grant you that -- I mean, I read the statute, this -- and

20

the rule the same way you do.

21

had in mind was consent beforehand, and I think you're

22

right, consent in -- in written form.

23

Of course, what Congress

The question is, if -- if that consent is not

24

given, and a whole trial is held, did Congress regard the

25

subject of the consent as being on the same level as

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

subject matter jurisdiction so that it could not possibly

2

either be satisfied by -- by an -- an inferred consent or

3

corrected afterwards, and if it were on the level of

4

subject matter jurisdiction, then there couldn't have been

5

consent in the first place, so we've got to assume that

6

Congress regarded the interest here as something less

7

significant than, say, subject matter jurisdiction.
MS. FROST:

8
9

I would not put it quite in those

terms, in terms of less significant.

I think what

10

Congress did was establish thresholds to the magistrate's

11

exercise of jurisdiction, and this is separate and apart

12

from saying this is a Federal question case.

13

we agree with that.

One is the

25

MS. FROST:

Now, supposing an

Can the client later come

First notice -- that's, I think, a

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

question that's -- it's arguable, but I would think that

2

the argument would be that no, the client at that point is

3

bound by the attorney's representation, just as clients

4

are bound by their attorney's representations in many

5

other situations.
QUESTION:

6

But they aren't bound by their

7

attorney's representations in some criminal cases.

8

mean, the -- the client must make the decision.

9

think this is one of them?
MS. FROST:

10

I

You don't

I -- I think the -- it's arguable,

11

but the answer I think is no, because there are many very

12

important decisions that counsel -- they're supposed to

13

consult with their client and, indeed, it would be a

14

violation of the Rules of Professional Responsibility if

15

they didn't in this instance on this question of consent,

16

but if for some reason the counsel made an error,

17

frequently litigants are at the mercy of their counsel.
QUESTION:

18

I -- I thought they were going to

19

ask -- I agree, Peretz is not in point, because it's an

20

issue where they did consent, but the -- the -- there is a

21

doctrine called the de facto officer doctrine, and that

22

means that if it's a fairly unimportant error, it can be

waived.

For example, if a judge sat in the wrong

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

wasn't just sick.

I mean, and these were all errors, and

2

the court said, well, they do not go to jurisdiction,

3

they're waivable.
Now, why isn't this case like that, at least if

4
5

we assume there was real consent given, it was just

6

implied.

7

harm is done, if they want to waive it, they can?

8
9
10
11
12

It violates the statute all right, but no real

MS. FROST:

Yes, well, Justice Breyer, the first

response to the de facto officer doctrine is that that is
supposed to apply to minor errors, and -QUESTION:

That's right.

They'll say, this is

sort of minor.

13

MS. FROST:

14

QUESTION:

And -Because after all it's not that

15

important, given the fact they gave the consent anyway.

16

At least, they showed up for trial.

17

MS. FROST:

I was going to say, it's not that

18

important considering the fact that they expressly

19

consented after the fact of the trial, but that, of

20

course, cannot be what this Court relies on, or --

21

QUESTION:

No, but I'm asking you really to

22

answer, why isn't it trivial?

23

isn't it small enough that it could be waived?

24

grand enough that it implicates what we call

25

jurisdictional error, the parties can't cure it, they

Why is it important?

Why

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

can't waive it?
MS. FROST:

Justice Breyer, the answer to your

3

question is first that Congress created it as a

4

jurisdictional threshold, second, that Congress was very

5

aware of the constitutional issues that arise when you

6

delegate Article III powers to non-Article III actors, and

7

for that reason, Congress repeatedly stated it wanted

8

consent to be voluntary, knowing, and willing.

9

concerned that less-advantaged litigants might be coerced,

It was

10

or might not realize that they have a right to an

11

Article III judge.

12
13

For this reason, Congress --

QUESTION:

But then, if it's jurisdictional as

you say --

14

MS. FROST:

15

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.
-- then why doesn't 1653 control?

16

Title 28, 1653 reads, defective allegations of

17

jurisdiction may be amended upon terms in the trial

18

appellate court.

19

the pro se person, because the court could say, on terms

20

it's not fair to hold this person, this pro se litigant to

21

consent that that person didn't give, but that it's

22

perfectly appropriate to hold the State Attorney General,

23

so even if we grant that it was jurisdiction, why doesn't

24

60 -- 1653 take care of it, saying defective allegations

25

of jurisdiction may be amended even in the appellate

A provision like that would take care of

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

court?
MS. FROST:

2

I think that would not be

3

sufficient, Your Honor, because it would change the

4

language of the statute, and in addition it would -- the

5

question would have to arise, what would happen if the

6

Attorney General came in at the end of this process and

7

said, I didn't consent, and I think that there would be a

8

strong basis on this record for the Attorney General to

9

proceed on that argument successfully.

10

The rule in the Fifth Circuit that the Attorney

11

General was supposed to be familiar with was that all the

12

parties must submit written consent before trial, so the

13

fact that they didn't would be strong evidence they had

14

not intended to consent.
Then you have the fact that all their pleadings

15
16

are captioned to the district court, you have the fact

17

that there was some switching off of counsel so it's not

18

clear whether the individuals, individual defendants here

19

had ever been consulted, or ever had an opportunity to

20

object.

21

QUESTION:

Is the customary way in the Southern

22

District of Texas to caption a pleading, Before the

23

Magistrate Judge, if the magistrate judge is presiding?

24
25

MS. FROST:

I do not know the customary way that

pleadings are captioned.

I do know that, from looking

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

through the record in this case, that later pleadings,

2

once the issue had come up that the magistrate -- that

3

there was never explicit consent before the trial, and

4

later pleadings did not have that caption, so it had been

5

taken out, and I guess my point in --

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. FROST:

What did the later pleadings have?
Nothing.

There was -- there was not

8

in -- in the summary judgment motion that I appealed there

9

is in all caps, a line that says, to the Honorable Judge

10

of the District Court, and in the later pleadings that

11

line was simply removed.

12

There was nothing there.

But my point, Your Honor, is not -- yes, that

13

may have been a form caption.

14

point is that there is nothing, from their submitting of a

15

motion for summary judgment, that indicates their consent.

16

QUESTION:

I don't dispute that.

My

What happens with our -- suppose you

17

have a defective diversity suit, and you get up to the

18

court of appeals and suddenly discover that one of the

19

defendants is from the same State, that there are many

20

defendants, and so the party says, oh, don't worry, we'll

21

drop him out, so they drop him out at the appellate stage.

22

Does that rescue the whole case, or do you have to do it

23

all over again?

24
25

What happens?

MS. FROST:

I don't know.

This Court's decision in the

Caterpillar case held that as long as there is the -- as

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

long as diversity is met at the time of the entry of

2

judgment, then that is acceptable, but that isn t your

hypothetical.

QUESTION:

Entry of which judgment, of the lower

court's -MS. FROST:

The district court, the lower

court's judgment.
QUESTION:

The district court, so you'd say if

we're doing it by analogy, you win?

10

MS. FROST:

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor.

Who do you suppose was intended to be

12

protected by these congressional requirements?

13

of my question is, wasn't the point to protect people who

14

didn't want to be tried by a magistrate judge, and if that

15

is the answer, why is someone in your position, or your

16

client's position, in a position to object at all here?

17

Your client gave consent.

18

MS. FROST:

No.

The point

There are two answers to that,

19

Justice Souter.

The first is that there are both

20

structural protections and personal protections in the

21

consent requirement.

22

when Congress requires consent, or when consent is

23

required, that serves as a break on the delegation of

24

Article III authority, and that preserves the separation

25

of powers required by the Constitution.

As this Court said in CFTC v. Schor,

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Okay, but if -- if we say, this does

2

not rise to the level of structural problems, which is

3

what we were getting at --

4

MS. FROST:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- earlier when we were saying, well,

6

it doesn't rise to the level of personal jurisdiction, so

7

if we say, that's not really involved here, then it's

8

merely a personal protection, and I suppose it's a

9

personal protection for the purpose who -- for the person

10

who can give or refuse consent, and as long as your client

11

said, fine with me to be tried by a magistrate judge, why

12

isn't the end of it, that the end of it for you?

13

MS. FROST:

Because my client never consented to

14

what happened here, which is that the Attorney General, by

15

failing to consent --

16

QUESTION:

Well, you're saying my client never

17

consented that they could get by without giving a written

18

consent, but that -- I mean, that, it seems to me, is

19

turning the whole premise on its head.

20
21
22
23

MS. FROST:

I have a slightly different point

I'm trying to make, Justice Souter, which is -QUESTION:

Okay.

I should let you give your

answer, okay.

24

(Laughter.)

25

MS. FROST:

Which is that at the end of this

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

proceeding, if the Attorney General's Office had said, oh,

2

we made a -- we didn't mean to consent, we're not filing a

3

written consent form, and we can't consent here, then

4

there would have been a new trial, and of course they were

5

only going to do that if they lost at trial, so when I

6

said my client didn't consent, my point was, my client

7

didn't consent to go through a proceeding where his

8

adversary had the opportunity to decide at the end of the

9

case whether they -QUESTION:

10

But if you're wrong about, that --

11

that the State Attorney General could have done that, and

12

if, as the petitioners' counsel said, they would have been

13

stuck.

14

general appearance.

15

gather that you would lose, because then you would have,

16

if the defendants couldn't get out at the end of it by

17

saying, sorry, we never consented, if they couldn't get

18

out, then I think you must lose.

19

They went to trial.

MS. FROST:

It's just like making a

If you're wrong about that, then I

I disagree, Your Honor, and here's

20

why, because the Magistrates Act establishes consent as

21

one of the vital thresholds to the parties, to the

22

magistrate's exercise of authority, and I do not believe

23

that the provision that you're reading from would apply in

24

a situation where Congress said, before a magistrate can

25

take over that Article III authority there must be both

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

designation and consent.

2

court here had not designated this magistrate, that is

3

also an error that could not be overlooked.
QUESTION:

4

I think if -- if the district

No, but I think you're answering a

5

different objection.

6

sufficient so that once you give it, you have no further

7

objection, and you said, the answer is, I didn't consent

8

to a trial in which they can sit back and wait and see

9

what happens and then say, oh, we didn't consent,

10

I said, why isn't your consent

rendering the entire thing a waste of time.
Justice Ginsburg says, yeah, but if we say, they

11
12

don't have the right to pull their consent if they sat

13

there and implicitly consented, then you don't have that

14

problem at all, and that would be the end of the argument,

15

and I don't think you've answered that.
MS. FROST:

16

Yes, I agree, and let me answer --

17

you're very right, Justice Souter, and let me answer the

18

question that I think you both are posing, which is, could

19

a harmless error standard be applied here?

words, if it is true that the only right is my client's,

21

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

thought you were asking was --

QUESTION:

Your answer was, I consented, so far

3

as I was concerned, to be tried.

4

them an option to go through an entire trial and then pull

5

the rug out if they didn't like the result.

6

Ginsburg's suggestion and my suggestion is, if we -- this.

7

If we find that an implicit consent on their part is

8

sufficient, they can't pull the rug out, and that would be

the end of the issue so far as self protection is

I agree.
I don't see a way around that.

(Laughter.)

QUESTION:

19

(Laughter.)

20

MS. FROST:

I'd do it, too.

Okay.

Well, respectfully, Your Honor, I

21

think this is related, because what I was trying to say is

22

that while I agree with you that once you say, if these

23

people go forward at trial, they're stuck, then there is

24

no question about, did my client get a raw deal here,

25

because everyone's bound, and they would have been bound

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

if they had lost, so that is why I am going on to the next

2

argument, which is harmless error, and whether or not that

3

would legitimately be something that a court could apply

4

in this situation, and this Court has said, in both it's

5

magistrate judge jurisprudence and also in its Article III

6

jurisprudence -QUESTION:

7

May I just interrupt with this

8

question?

If you took Justice Ginsburg's suggestion that

9

just participation in the trial is enough to establish the

10

consent, that would mean that the consent need not be

11

given in advance of the beginning of the proceeding.

12

MS. FROST:

13

QUESTION:

Yes, and I think that -And the statute's rather clear that

14

it has to come first, isn't it?

15

MS. FROST:

16

QUESTION:

Exactly, yes, Your Honor.
Well, is -- don't they give the

17

consent, though, when the magistrate judge sits down and

18

says, let's go, and -- and the -- I realize consent is not

19

failure to object.

20

the party sits there and the trial begins --

21
22

There's a distinction there, but if

QUESTION:

But may I ask, does he even have the

authority to say, let's go, before consent has been given?

23

(Laughter.)

24

MS. FROST:

25

That is my argument, Justice

Stevens, which is that because the statute says upon

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

consent, the consent must come first, and therefore simply

2

by -QUESTION:

3

No, but the magistrate can say the

4

words, let's go -- I mean, he's got that First Amendment

5

right, and if he --

6

(Laughter.)

7

QUESTION:

If the magistrate does say that, and

8

everybody sits there, as it were, with a smile on their

9

face, I would suppose that that was a consent at that

10

point.

I mean, isn't -- couldn't you infer the consent at

11

that point?
MS. FROST:

12

I agree that consent could be

13

inferred at that point, but I would disagree strongly that

14

Congress intended inaction to equal consent.
QUESTION:

15
16

Of course, the statute says that

consent has to be communicated to the clerk.
MS. FROST:

17

Yes, exactly.

I agreed that consent

18

could be inferred from the parties' conduct, but that does

19

not meet the requirement of the statute.
QUESTION:

20

There's one dysjunction, and you have

21

stressed, and I think rightly, that why was Congress doing

22

this?

23

magistrate instead of an Article III judge, it wanted to

24

assure voluntariness, and those two concerns are not

25

present in this case.

It didn't want parties to be coerced into getting a

I mean, nobody is suggesting the

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

State Attorney General is being coerced, or didn't do this

2

voluntarily, so the reasons for the provision don't exist,

3

don't match this case.
MS. FROST:

4

I agree with you, Your Honor, but

5

then the question is, well, did Congress intend for some

6

different standard for consent to be applied in different

7

cases?

8
9

The Congress -QUESTION:

Well, I think we could take notice,

couldn't we, that State Attorney Generals might not want

10

to antagonize magistrates.

11

institutional litigants, will appear there all of the

12

time, and they might -- and they might be reluctant to

13

withhold consent, unless they could do it under the

14

anonymous basis provided for in the rules.

15

MS. FROST:

They're going to be -- they're

Yes, I agree with that, Justice

16

Kennedy, and that would be another reason to say yes,

17

Congress' concerns actually do apply to the State Attorney

18

Generals, but in any case I think that what's relevant

19

here as well is the fact that Congress clearly -- and it

20

couldn't be more clear, both from the use of the word

21

jurisdiction in the statute, and from the fact that in the

22

legislative history Congress expressed these concerns

23

about voluntariness, that consent must be expressed.

24

The counsel for the petitioners, when she was

25

arguing, repeatedly referred to the fact that the local

49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

rules and Rule 73(b) protect the voluntariness concerns.

2

They serve that purpose, and that is our point.

3

what Congress said consent is for, and that is why

4

Congress said consent cannot be something that simply is

5

implied as you go along.

That is

Consent must be something you communicate to the

6
7

clerk.

It must be something clear, and that is why eight

8

courts of appeals, we respectfully submit, have already

9

reached the conclusion there must be express consent.

10

They've reached the conclusion that without it, the court

11

has no jurisdiction, and both -- and all of these

12

decisions came before amendments to the Magistrates Act in

13

1990, in '96.

14

If Congress had an issue with both the consent

15

requirement being read as express consent and with courts

16

concluding they had no jurisdiction without it, then

17

Congress could have take action, taken action, and because

18

it didn't, I believe that that is a sign that Congress

19

meant what it said in the Magistrates Act.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA R. ESKOW

23

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

24
25

MS. ESKOW:

Because the statute was designed to

protect the voluntariness of the parties, and the local

50
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

rules and the Federal rules also serve that purpose, and

2

here you have no party suggesting that they were coerced

3

or involuntarily dragged before a magistrate judge rather

4

than an Article III judge, to reverse in these

5

circumstances, as the Fifth Circuit did, to sua sponte

6

investigate consent when there is no question, where no

7

one is claiming to have been involuntarily dragged before

8

the magistrate judge, would be to import some sort of

9

automatic, per se, plain error, subject matter

10

jurisdictional principle into a context that is not based

11

on subject matter jurisdiction but, rather, the

12

particularities of a particular officer presiding and, as

13

Justice Breyer noted, the de facto officer doctrine exists

14

to insulate judgments from attack that have a technical

15

deficiency, for example, not signing a consent form.

16

And because all parties voluntarily proceeded in

17

this fashion, their consent should not have been

18

questioned after the judgment was entered, and there is no

19

basis to find any sort of harm to any of the parties when

20

their Article III rights were not violated in any respect,

21

and for these reasons we would ask that you reverse the

22

judgment of the Fifth Circuit.
