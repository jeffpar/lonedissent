ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK J. RICCIARDI

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. RICCIARDI:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. RICCIARDI:

13

It's Ricciardi, sir.

Mr. Ricciardi.
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case involves the extraordinary situation

14
15

in the law where the burden of proof is shifted to a

16

defendant.

17

shift in certain limited situations, certain torts, and in

18

1989 this Court recognized that burden shift in Title VII

19

cases.

Courts have recognized this type of burden

We are here today because the court below has

20
21

held and the respondent argues that the Civil Rights Act

22

Amendment of 1991 shifts the burden of proof to the

23

defendant in virtually all Title VII disparate treatment

24

cases.

25

the Civil Rights Act, nor does it make sense based on this

That conclusion does not follow from the text of

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Court's history of fashioning the orderly presentation of

2

proof in Title VII cases.
The Civil Rights Act of 1991 was passed in part

3
4

as a response to certain decisions of this Court.

5

those decisions was Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins where the

6

Court recognized that in certain limited situations in a

7

Title VII disparate treatment case, when the plaintiff

8

presents direct evidence of an unlawful motive that was

9

actually relied upon in making a decision, the burden of

10

One of

causation then shifts to the defendant.
The Price Waterhouse mixed-motive framework

11
12

applies to a narrow subset of cases.

13

early on in Title VII that most of these cases will be

14

circumstantial evidence cases, and as a way to deal with

15

that, the McDonnell Douglas case set up a framework for

16

considering the vast majority of those cases.

17

cases where there is direct evidence of illegal animus

18

tied to an employment decision, the Court said that the

19

defendant must now prove that it would have made the same

20

decision either way.
QUESTION:

21

The Court recognized

In the few

And what is your definition of direct

22

evidence, Mr. Ricciardi?

23

MR. RICCIARDI:

There's two definitions that

24

we've briefed, Your Honor.

25

helpful.

Both of them I think are

The first one is quoted in the SG's brief at

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

page 26, and that's from the EEOC guidance.

And I'll read

2

that.

3

respondent or a respondent official that on its face

4

demonstrates a bias against a protected group and is

5

linked to the complained-of adverse action.

Any written or verbal policy or statement made by a

We proposed, Your Honor, in our blue brief a

6
7

slightly different formulation, but I believe it gets you

8

to the same place.

9

borrowing from the First Circuit Febres case, a three-

On page 41 of our blue brief,

10

part test which we think gets you to the same place.

11

first is there has to be a statement by a decisionmaker;

12

second, that directly reflects the alleged animus; and

13

third, that it bears squarely on the contested employment

14

decision.
QUESTION:

15

The

The first -- the first of those three

16

is -- goes beyond what the -- what the Government -- the

17

EEOC guideline would require, doesn't it?

18

the EEOC guideline, it doesn't require that -- that the

19

indication come from a decisionmaker.
MR. RICCIARDI:

20

As I understand

You're correct, Your Honor.

21

words of the EEOC are the respondent or respondent

22

official.

23
24
25

Yes, so it does go a bit beyond.
QUESTION:

The

Although the fact that it has to bear

upon the decision, it's hard to get there without -MR. RICCIARDI:

Well, I think maybe --

QUESTION:

somehow.
MR. RICCIARDI:

3

What could be contemplated I

4

guess is a respondent official, who's maybe even higher

5

than the decisionmaker, makes the statement.

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

7

MR. RICCIARDI:

The Civil Rights Act of 1991

8

sets out a new section, and we've set it out in appendix

9

A.

10

QUESTION:

Of your brief?

11

MR. RICCIARDI:

Of the brief, of the blue brief,

12

Your Honor.

13

107(a) of the Civil Rights Act.

14

an unlawful employment practice would be established when

15

the complaining party demonstrates that race, color,

16

religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor

17

for any employment practice.

18

language:

19

practice.

20

It sets out 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(m), which was
And that described that

And then this is the key

even though other factors also motivated the

This indicates that Congress intended for there

21

to be the distinction, recognized in Price Waterhouse,

22

between the standard McDonnell Douglas pretext case, which

23

you prove under 2000e-2(a), and the mixed-motive case

24

which was first recognized in Price Waterhouse.

25

The second part of the text that evidences this

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

distinction is section 107(b) of the Civil Rights Act

2

which is codified there in that same place at 2000e-

3

5(g)(2)(B), and that talks about where an individual

4

proves a violation under 2(m) that -- and where the

5

employer does not succeed in proving -- excuse me -- where

6

the employer does succeed in proving the affirmative

7

defense, then in that case the plaintiff is entitled only

8

to declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and attorneys'

9

fees demonstrated to be directly attributable only to the

10

pursuit of a claim under section 2000e-2(m).

11

QUESTION:

Mr. Ricciardi, would that

12

demonstration by the defendant also have to be made by

13

direct evidence?

14

One is respondent demonstrates, and the other is the

15

plaintiff demonstrates.

The words Congress used is the same.

MR. RICCIARDI:

16

The word demonstrate is used

17

twice, Your Honor, but I do not agree that the respondent

18

or the defendant or the employer has any heightened

19

standard.

20

to interpret the burdens of proof, this Court historically

21

looks at background principles.

22

statute, using the Court's background principles of

23

McDonnell Douglas for the standard pretext case and Price

24

Waterhouse for the standard mixed-motive case, there's no

25

heightened evidentiary standard for the respondent or the

And the reason I say that is because in order

QUESTION:

Well, the question whether there is,

3

you would be suggesting a rule that, as far as I know, is

4

alien to our law, that is, to make a distinction between

5

direct evidence and circumstantial evidence.

6

direct evidence by a liar and you can have highly

7

convincing circumstantial evidence.

8

in this one area make a distinction that, as far as I

9

know, is not made elsewhere?

10

MR. RICCIARDI:

You can have

So why would the law

Your Honor, I believe the

11

distinction is made because the shifting of the burden to

12

the defendant in employment cases is an unusual thing.

13

does not happen in other areas of the law.

14

bright line rule in order to --

16

QUESTION:

It

Courts need a

It is -- it is unquestionably -- it

17

MR. RICCIARDI:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

MR. RICCIARDI:

20

QUESTION:

21

was said in Price Waterhouse?

22

plurality opinion.

23

out of a plurality --

I mean, that's what it said.
Price Waterhouse --

Not in the -- not in the

The direct evidence rule doesn't come

Concurring opinion.

25

MR. RICCIARDI:

Well --

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

It came out of a concurring opinion

2

that bore my name, did it not?

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. RICCIARDI:

5

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Yes.

And I don't think it appeared

6

in the plurality opinion, nor in Justice White's

7

concurring opinion, did it?
MR. RICCIARDI:

8
9

No, it did not, Your Honor.

What I believe the -QUESTION:

10

I know a number of courts have

11

followed it, but I -- it's hard to extract a -- a rule

12

under those circumstances.

13

MR. RICCIARDI:

14

QUESTION:

I -- I --

Congress, in making its amendments in

15

1991, did not mention anything about direct evidence, did

16

it?

17

MR. RICCIARDI:

No, it did not, Your Honor.

18

And -- and I think there are two things that --

19

that we have to look at.

One of them is the plurality

20

opinion did in -- in note 13 state that -- that its

21

formulation was not meaningfully different from Justice

22

O'Connor's concurrence.

23

worth, that's there.

24

the direct evidence picture is that six Justices of the

25

Supreme Court all found that the facts in Price Waterhouse

For what -- for what that's

And another way I think to look at

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

were sufficient to have a mixed-motive burden shift.
QUESTION:

Fine.

So that's what I took the

3

statement -- I mean, far be it from me to characterize

4

somebody else's opinion, but I thought the statement was

5

simply saying, and here this is an added feature that

6

shows how right the majority is and that's true in that

7

case, but what is there that suggests that it's not just

8

an added feature showing the majority was right in that

9

case, but that you have to have it and can't have anything

10

that isn't direct evidence.

11

MR. RICCIARDI:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. RICCIARDI:

Well, Your Honor, I think --

Where does it say that?
I think we get that from going

14

back to background principles.

The McDonnell Douglas

15

decision, which has still been followed and has been

16

referred to by this Court, is the rubric that's used for

17

circumstantial evidence cases.

18

QUESTION:

But wait I didn't -- then I probably

19

am unclear about it.

What I thought happened is that

20

Price -- that McDonnell Douglas governs a circumstance

21

where a plaintiff puts on a case, however he puts it on.

22

Once you show the McDonnell Douglas factors, you can get

23

to the jury unless, of course, the defendant puts

24

something on.

25

McDonnell Douglas bursts and goes away.

And once the defendant puts something on,
Now, am I right

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2
3
4

about that or not?
MR. RICCIARDI:

That is correct, Your Honor.

And the plaintiff -QUESTION:

All right.

Then -- then I don't see

5

what McDonnell Douglas has to do with this because I would

6

think 90 percent of the cases in which there is a mixed

7

motive are going to come up because the defendant will

8

say, I did it for a different reason, and the plaintiff

9

will come back and say, you did it for both reasons.

So I

10

think in 90 percent of the cases, we're not going to have

11

any McDonnell Douglas involved.

12

MR. RICCIARDI:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. RICCIARDI:

I -- I --

It will just be -- am I right or not?
I -- I don't agree with that,

The reason is because in -- if you look at

15

Your Honor.

16

the facts on the classic mixed-motive cases -- Mt.

17

Healthy, for example, and -- and that was a case

18

specifically relied upon in Justice White's concurrence.

19

There we had a school district in a written letter making

20

an admission, yes, we considered the illegal aspect of

21

your First Amendment rights.

22

Waterhouse where, on the facts it's uncontested that the

23

written evaluations by those partners, which were relied

24

upon by the policy board, used sexual stereotypes.

25

QUESTION:

And then we have Price

Did -- did the defendants in those

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

two cases put on any evidence?
MR. RICCIARDI:

2
3

I would -- I would imagine they

absolutely did, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

4

Yes, so do I.

So neither of those

5

cases does McDonnell Douglas have to do with anything,

6

because they aren't involved in the case I gather, if I'm

7

right, once the defendant put on some evidence.

8

MR. RICCIARDI:

9

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

All right.

So my question really is

10

since McDonnell Douglas doesn't have much to do with the

11

cases in which mixed motive comes up, why does -- why are

12

you talking about McDonnell Douglas?

13

Douglas to do with the background rule?

14

background rule just -- well, what your opponents are

15

saying?

16

MR. RICCIARDI:

What has McDonnell
Why isn't the

Well, because, Your Honor, the

17

backgrounds rule enables us to deal with the cases where

18

there is not direct evidence of the illegal motivation,

19

and those cases will be rare.

20

Healthy and if you look at the facts -- Price Waterhouse

21

facts, in the concurrence by Justice O'Connor in Price

22

Waterhouse, it says, the employer has created uncertainty

23

as to causation by knowingly giving substantial weight to

24

an impermissible criteria.

25

few and far between where you --

And if you look at Mt.

I believe these cases will be

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Ricciardi, can we go back to the

2

background, which I find very difficult to understand

3

because if an elevated proof standard is wanted, then

4

courts not uncommonly will say, we will require you to

5

prove something by more than a mere preponderance.

6

will require you to prove this by clear and convincing

7

evidence.

8

direct evidence and circumstantial evidence -- is there

9

any other area where direct evidence counts for more than

10

Then I can understand.

We

But a line between

substantial evidence just by virtue of being direct?
MR. RICCIARDI:

11

I have not uncovered ones, Your

12

Honor.

I think that is what the Court in Price Waterhouse

13

was faced with, and I think it's a bright line rule that

14

would give our trial judges the ability -QUESTION:

15

Then how do you get it out of Price

16

Waterhouse when it's in the opinion, as Justice O'Connor

17

said?

18

direct evidence.

19

substantial factor, but didn't say direct evidence.

20

That's a lot to load on two words in a concurring opinion.

21

Her opinion.

There were four people who didn't say

There was Justice White who said a

MR. RICCIARDI:

Well, Your Honor, unfortunately

22

because of the fractured opinions there, we have had to

23

rely on, besides the actual words on the page, we had to

24

rely on, what -- the way the circuits have read the case

25

-- and they have all consistently -- almost all

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

consistently read it as having a heightened evidentiary

2

standard and -QUESTION:

3

Well, wouldn't heightened ordinarily

4

be clear and convincing evidence, whether direct or

5

circumstantial?
MR. RICCIARDI:

6

Your Honor, it might ordinarily,

7

but I believe in employment cases it's very difficult to

8

do.

9

rumors, we have maybe documents that are --

In employment cases we have stray remarks, we have

QUESTION:

10

Sure.

But doesn't -- doesn't a

11

standard like clear and convincing address that kind of

12

problem?

13

know, cannot be taken as company policy, et cetera, then

14

you're going to have a hard time getting to the clear and

15

convincing standard.

16

of evidence, direct or indirect, is -- is necessary to

17

address that problem as opposed to the -- to the quantum

18

of proof, clear and convincing versus preponderance.

If all you have are stray remarks that, you

I don't see why the -- the quality

MR. RICCIARDI:

19

Your Honor, I think that you're

20

putting too much weight on the shoulders of the trial

21

judges.

22

there was direct evidence, and he was sifting through what

23

we believed amounted to nothing more than a pile of

24

circumstantial evidence.

25

guidance of the bright line rule, it would have been

In our case, our trial judge was convinced that

And I think had he had the

14
Alderson Reporting Company

1

easier for him.
QUESTION:

2

Can you explain to me -- and you're

3

the expert on this, I'm not.

You try a lot of these

4

cases.

5

I'm not trying a lot of them, I think, well, this -- this

6

seems to make perfectly good sense.

7

and has to show that the bad motive was a motivating

8

factor.

9

shouldn't the plaintiff win?

When I look at it, being naive in this area, since

A plaintiff comes in

Well, once the plaintiff has shown that, why
And if, by the way, the

10

defendant can come in and show that she would have been

11

fired anyway because she was a bad typist, well, then

12

maybe he shouldn't have to pay damages.

13

MR. RICCIARDI:

Your Honor, going back to the

14

text of the statute, 2(m) defined the plaintiff's duty as

15

showing that the illegal criteria was a motivating factor.

16

But the vast majority of cases fall under 2(a)(1) where

17

the plaintiff must show that he or she was discriminated

18

against because of sex, gender, race, whatever.

19

is a but for standard in 2(a), which means that the

20

plaintiff has to carry the ball all the way across the

21

goal line, does not shift the burden of proof to the

22

defendant.

23

QUESTION:

So that

But the burden of proof that -- that

24

you keep referring to, in effect, is the burden of proof

25

for what under the statutory scheme is -- is a partial

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

affirmative defense.

2

you -- if you want to claim a partial affirmative defense,

3

you have the burden of proof on it?

4

burden of proof on an affirmative defense.

5

What is remarkable about saying if

MR. RICCIARDI:

You always have the

Well, what makes this

6

extraordinary, Your Honor, is that under 2(m), the

7

plaintiff never has to prove that what this defendant did

8

caused this injury.

9

the plaintiff can say --

10

QUESTION:

The but for is in 2(a), but in 2(m),

2(m) is addressing something else.

11

2(m) is -- is addressing what happens if, in fact, a -- a

12

defendant wants to raise an affirmative defense, a partial

13

affirmative defense.

That's all it addresses.

14

MR. RICCIARDI:

15

QUESTION:

Your Honor, I believe --

Well, it isn't all it -- I mean, it

16

addresses the sufficiency of -- of liability, and then it

17

goes on to address the -- the affirmative defense.

18

MR. RICCIARDI:

Well, Your Honor, my response to

19

that is I believe that the Civil Rights Act incorporated

20

2(m) as a direct response and a partial codification of

21

the Price Waterhouse decision because there was no burden

22

shift under Title VII until Price Waterhouse created it.

23

QUESTION:

When that was enacted, was there

24

already a considerable body of court of appeals opinions

25

which had interpreted Price Waterhouse as establishing the

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

direct evidence rule, or did they come later?
MR. RICCIARDI:

2

Your Honor, I believe these are

3

cited in the -- in the SG's brief, and I believe there

4

were five circuit courts that had, between Price

5

Waterhouse and the Civil Rights Act, recognized that.

6

Your Honor, may I reserve?

QUESTION:

8

We'll hear from Mr. Gornstein.

Yes, Mr. Ricciardi.

Now, the text of the law doesn't address what

23

kind of evidence is sufficient to make out a mixed-motive

24

case, and it leaves that to resolution through background

25

principles as Congress typically does.

Congress typically

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

does not address what kind of evidence is sufficient.

2

the key and most relevant and pertinent background

3

principle here was that before the amendment, direct

4

evidence was required to make out a mixed-motive case.
QUESTION:

5

And

Do you say that because that's the

6

way a lot of court of appeals determined, or do you think

7

that was a necessity by virtue of the split in the

8

opinions on this Court?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

9

Two sources for that, Justice

10

Souter.

One is the court of appeals' decisions, and there

11

were five between the time of Price Waterhouse and the

12

time of the '91 amendments, and that formed an important

13

part of the backdrop against which Congress -QUESTION:

14

Were those -- were those opinions

15

based on the reading of this Court as depending upon

16

Justice O'Connor's opinion where those words were used?

17

MR. GORNSTEIN:

18

QUESTION:

I -- I would not --

Or did the courts independently

19

create a distinction between direct and substantial

20

evidence?

21

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I think that those two -- those

22

cases, for the most part, were trying to reconcile this

23

Court's decisions in McDonnell Douglas with Price

24

Waterhouse, and that's exactly the first source for where

25

we would get the background rule as well.

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Well, then would you tell me --

2

QUESTION:

Why would you have that background?

3

QUESTION:

-- why would the court -- if that's

4

what it was trying to do, why would it resort to something

5

as extraordinary -- now that we no longer have formal

6

rules of evidence, like you need two witnesses to prove A

7

and three witnesses to prove B, why would it resort to

8

that kind of distinction between direct and circumstantial

9

rather than a heightened burden expressed as clear and

10

convincing?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

11

Because it was trying to be --

12

they were trying to be faithful to this Court's decisions

13

in McDonnell Douglas and Price Waterhouse.

14

explain how those two decisions fit together because in --

15

in Price Waterhouse, there was direct evidence, and six

16

Justices said that was sufficient to shift the burden of

17

proof.

18

other than that would be sufficient to shift the burden of

19

proof.

20
21

Now, no opinion expressly stated that something

QUESTION:

But only one stated that it was

necessary as well as sufficient.

22

MR. GORNSTEIN:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

And let me

That's correct.

So you had five that did not say it

was necessary as well as sufficient.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

That's correct.

And five did

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

not say that it would -- that anything less would be

2

sufficient, however, and that issue is resolved by

3

McDonnell Douglas and -- and that line of cases.

4

And what McDonnell Douglas and that line of

5

cases say is that in a purely circumstantial evident case

6

-- evidence case -- the plaintiff has a very light burden

7

at the outset, but that once the employer comes back and

8

puts on a nondiscriminatory explanation, the plaintiff has

9

to carry the burden of proof all the way to showing

10

pretext and but for causation.

The plaintiff under the

11

McDonnell Douglas line of cases has to show but for

12

causation.

13

So when you put the two decisions together,

14

Price Waterhouse and McDonnell Douglas, the rule that

15

emerges is in -- to get into the Price Waterhouse box,

16

where you get a shift in the burden of proof, you need

17

direct evidence.

18

QUESTION:

Are there cases in which a motivating

19

factor is not but for causation when it's not a mixed-

20

motive case?

21
22
23

MR. GORNSTEIN:

It -- it's a mixed-motive case

where it's not a but for factor.
QUESTION:

No.

That's correct.

I'm asking the other -- the

24

converse of that.

If there is no second motive, but

25

merely there's evidence of -- of a motivating factor,

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

period, isn't that enough?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

2

No.

If it's -- if it's the sole

3

motive, then it would be a violation under 2000e-2(a)(1).

4

That would be a -QUESTION:

5
6

Would it also not be a violation of

this statute?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

7

No, because 2000e-2(m) is

8

designed just for cases where there's more than one

9

motive.
QUESTION:

10

It's designed to create a special

11

defense and a special remedy, but it doesn't say anything

12

about what it takes to prove the case, does it?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

13
14

principles.

15

principle.

It leaves that to background

And as I was saying, that's the background

The second point that's very crucial here is

16
17

that if there's not a direct evidence requirement, Justice

18

Stevens, the result would be that you are going to

19

effectively render superfluous 2000e-2(1) which up until

20

now has been the principal safeguard against

21

discrimination, and the reason is that 2000e-2(a)(1)

22

requires proof of but for cause.

23

proof --

24
25

QUESTION:

2000e-2(m) requires

But I -- I still -- maybe I'm just

stupid, but I don't understand the difference between a

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

but for cause and a motivating factor that is not part of

2

a mixed-motive case.

3

MR. GORNSTEIN:

4

QUESTION:

If it's just --

If -- if the only motivating -- if

5

there's a motivating factor and there's nothing else,

6

isn't that but for causation?

7

MR. GORNSTEIN:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

It -- certainly it is --

And so is it if you have two, isn't

it?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

-- 2000e-2(a)(1) but not -- it

11

doesn't apply where cases where it's not a but for cause.

12

That's what --

13

QUESTION:

Why not?

In -- in law school, in my

14

first year in torts, I learned that there's an odd case

15

where you have two hunters shooting at the same person.

16

Now, in both cases, you know, they're not actually

17

literally but for conditions, but they fall within the

18

word because.

19

causal conditions.

My torts teacher used to call them co­

20

MR. GORNSTEIN:

21

QUESTION:

22

So I'm amazed that you're reading

because, contrary to all tort law --

23

MR. GORNSTEIN:

24

QUESTION:

25

Well --

No.

-- to mean that if you have the co­

causal condition, which happens to be two motives here,

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

not two hunters, that it wouldn't fall within the

2

beginning.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

3
4

No.

That -- that's a special

case, Justice Breyer.

5

QUESTION:

Yes, it is.

6

MR. GORNSTEIN:

And -- and the ordinary rule is

7

that you have to show that it's but for cause, and the

8

Court said as much in -QUESTION:

9

All right, but it's a special case

10

we're dealing with where you have two hunters -- I'm sorry

11

-- two motives.

12

motive case, what the Congress did was write 2(m) to tell

13

you treat it okay for liability, but don't award damages.

14

Now, where am I wrong in that analysis?

And so in that unusual two-hunter/two-

MR. GORNSTEIN:

15

The -- the key point that you're

16

missing there is that if you interpret 2000e-2(m) in that

17

way, you would be rendering superfluous 2000e-2(a)(1)

18

which requires but for cause by virtue of the because of

19

language.

20

order to show a violation, a plaintiff would only have to

21

show motivating factor, not but for cause.

22

render -- no plaintiff would ever seek to prove a 2000e-

23

2(a) case.

24
25

And if -- if under the -- that's because in

It would

They'd always seek to prove a 2000e-2(m) case.

And the result would be that what up until now
has been the principal safeguard in literally thousands of

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

cases under Title VII would be translated -- transformed

2

into something that is almost completely obsolete, and

3

there's just nothing to indicate that Congress intended to

4

so radically change the fabric of Title VII law.

5

we have is a much more modest adjustment.
QUESTION:

6

And what

Would it be a radical change in our

7

law if we said that instead of direct evidence, it's clear

8

and convincing evidence?

9

MR. GORNSTEIN:

That would be a very big change

10

in this Court's law if -- if this Court said that because

11

this Court has already said, under Title VII, the

12

background understanding is more likely than not, and

13

that's what the plaintiff has to show.

14

look at this amendment is not as a very fundamental change

15

in the basic fabric of Title VII law, but a response to a

16

particular decision.

17

to.

18

And so the way to

That's what Congress was responding

And if you'll recall in that case, there was

19

direct evidence.

20

had taken gender into account, and then the Court said,

21

well, the employer can get out from all liability by

22

showing absence of but -- but for cause.

23

responded to that particular decision in doing that.

24
25

An employer basically admitted that it

But that didn't mean that Congress thereafter
went on to undertake a complete reexamination of the law.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

It left it where it was, and where it was is in purely

circumstantial evidence cases, under McDonnell Douglas,

once the employer introduces a nondiscriminatory

4

explanation, the plaintiff has to carry the burden of

proof of showing pretext and but for cause.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT N. PECCOLE

10

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. PECCOLE:

11
12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case, at the very middle of it, when we're

13
14

trying to settle instructions, the parties involved agreed

15

to instructions 1 through 9.

17

this jury instruction is found at the joint appendix 32

18

and 33.

proved against a defendant, your verdict should be for the

Alderson Reporting Company

plaintiff and against the defendant.

On the other hand,

2

if any of these things has not been proved against a

3

defendant, your verdict should be for the defendant.
What I'm trying to point out is the parties at

4
5

that point and at that juncture had agreed that this

6

definitely was a 107(a) case and it would go to the jury

7

as such.
The only objection that Caesars had to

8
9

instructions was instruction number 10, and instruction

10

number 10 was the same action defense that aids Caesars in

11

the fact that it actually cuts down the type of damages

that can be awarded.

is it easy for them to now come before this Court and say

15

they were harmed by the fact that that instruction was

given.

In fact, monetary damages cannot be

That instruction aided Caesars and in no event

17

I would point out that this is similar to the

25

presented to the jury.

Well, I would submit that the same
The parties agreed that this

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Reading 703(m), which is Title VII 200e-2(m) --

2

and that's found at the respondent's brief, page 9 -- the

3

section specifically states, except as otherwise provided

4

in this title, an unlawful employment practice is

5

established when a complaining party demonstrates a race,

6

color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating

7

factor for any employment practice, even though other

8

factors also motivated the practice.

9

employment practice that -- that takes into consideration

10

any of the things listed, and in this case, it was gender.

11

So it was a gender-motivated case.

That's stating any

I would point out that when we look at this

12
13

statute, it talks in terms of a plaintiff having to

14

demonstrate, and the plaintiff under that terminology

15

merely had to show and bear the burden of showing a case

16

which actually would indicate that gender was a motivating

17

factor.
In the case that was presented to the jury,

18
19

there was absolutely no question that Ms. Costa showed a

20

case every bit as strong as the case and the facts that

21

were found in Price Waterhouse.

Reference does not have

22

to be made to Price Waterhouse.

The statute itself does

23

not talk in terms of any heightened burden placed on the

24

plaintiff, nor does it talk in terms of substantial

25

evidence.

It goes right to what it says on its face that

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

a plaintiff merely has to demonstrate.
QUESTION:

2

And what do you -- what do you

3

respond to the argument made by the Government if -- that

4

if that is what it means and if it does not embody the

5

understood requirement of direct evidence, it effectively

6

supplants (a)(1).

7

prove a case under (a)(1), which is what has been the

8

traditional approach.

It -- nobody would -- would try to

MR. PECCOLE:

9

In our brief, Your Honor, we -- we

actually took the position that the language in 703(m)

11

does, in fact, supplant the language in 701(a).

Excuse me.

But --

Well, that's a massive change in --

MR. PECCOLE:

QUESTION:

I -- I would like to maybe --

I mean, it just shifts the burden to

18

the employer to prove nondiscrimination effectively.

19

That's a -- that's a very big change.

20

MR. PECCOLE:

21

little bit on that.

22

necessary.

23

I would like to backtrack just a

I think there's an explanation

It has to be more detailed.

In the Price Waterhouse case, the plurality

24

actually had said, first of all, the motivating factor was

25

the -- the motive involved.

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

The plurality also said that the -- the words

2

because of, in 703(a), really didn't mean because of.

3

said something along the lines that it does not mean

4

solely because of.

5

to motivating factor.

6

the plurality ended up in 703(m), and I think you could

7

also say that it -- the definition given by the plurality,

8

to because of in 703(a), actually came over into 703(m)

9

too.

10

QUESTION:

It

That's how the plurality basically got
The language motivating factor of

But they are still contradictory.

I

11

mean, (a)(1) would require in a mixed-motive case -- okay

12

-- if -- if you apply (a)(1) to a mixed-motive case, it

13

would require the plaintiff to show that the -- the

14

improper motive was an effective cause and that the

15

employer would not have dismissed this person anyway.

16

Whereas, if the new 2(m) governs, it's just the opposite.

17

Once you show an improper motive, it is up to the employer

18

to show that if he wishes to get off, he would have taken

19

the same action anyway.

20

not -- not compatible.

21

MR. PECCOLE:

So I -- the -- the two are just

I think the Ninth Circuit's

22

approach is the best.

The Ninth Circuit actually said

23

that if you show a single-motive type case which falls

24

under 703(a), that it goes to the jury as a because of.

25

There is just absolutely no question that is the better

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

approach.
The other approach is, if there is a mixed

2
3

motive -- and these are decisions that have to be made by

4

the judge before the instructions go to the jury.

5

there are mixed motives, then it goes to the jury as a

6

703(m).

7

If

In this case, the mixed motives were there.

It

8

did go to the jury as a 703(m), and it also included the

9

defense that Caesars had available under 706(g)(2)(b).

10

QUESTION:

And as I understand --

11

QUESTION:

Am I right --

12

QUESTION:

-- as I understand (m), it isn't a

13

question of shifting the burden to the defendant.

14

plaintiff wins at that point.

15

demonstrates sex is a motivating factor, at that point

16

plaintiff wins.

17

the plaintiff's victory.

18

the defendant can't get off the hook.

19

structured, it's not that you're loading on the defendant

20

an extraordinary burden of showing nonliability.

21

plaintiff makes the demonstration that (m) calls for,

22

plaintiff is the winner, and the only thing that -- the

23

only function of the defense is to limit the remedy.

24

That's how I understand --

25

The

If the plaintiff

The affirmative defense doesn't take away

MR. PECCOLE:

It just limits the remedy.

So

MR. PECCOLE:

I think what they accomplished

15

was, first of all, they clarified Price Waterhouse from

16

the standpoint that there was no heightened burden, no

17

direct evidence burden, no substantial factor burden.

18

did that for sure.

19

It

The next thing that it did is it -- it made it

20

so a plaintiff would bear the burden of having to

21

establish that gender played a motivating factor.

22

that is in any employment decision, not just, you know,

23

the very limited type or anything like that.

24

employment decision.

25

employment action.

And

It says, any

And that becomes an unlawful

QUESTION:

Is -- is this correct, that McDonnell

Douglas survives on your reading in a case in which the

3

defendant does not go forward with anything?

4

plaintiff puts in enough to make a prima facie case.

5

Defendant sits mute.

6

result there.

7

something at that point -- and -- and here I'm not sure of

8

this, but I think -- by definition, it then becomes a

9

mixed-motive case, doesn't it?

McDonnell Douglas controls the

If the defendant does go forward with

MR. PECCOLE:

QUESTION:

14

the mute defendant.

15

governs everything.

16

The

Under (m)?

I believe it does.

Okay.
I -- I think --

So McDonnell survives in the case of
In the non-mute defendant, (m)

MR. PECCOLE:

Let me see if I can answer.

17

McDonnell Douglas, as has been suggested -- it's used at

18

the very preliminary stage of a -- of a case.

19

Douglas at some point in that decision then bursts.

20

goes away.

21

703(a) and the 703(m).

22

McDonnell
It

And so what you're left with is the 71 -- or

Now, I'm -- here I'm -- again I'm relying on

23

what the Ninth Circuit said.

They are still giving

24

McDonnell Douglas cases some deference, but what they are

25

saying in fact is yes, once you're past that stage,

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

basically the 703(m) cases will come into play.

2

will be the instructions to the jury.

3

QUESTION:

That

Does it -- does it -- just for

4

clarifying in my mind, does it matter or doesn't it matter

5

whether you say (m) governs a separate set of cases?

6

I came in, I thought the answer to that was no, it

7

doesn't, that (e) governs every case because the cause can

8

govern the two-motive cases too, and that in (m) Congress

9

was simply clarifying that there could be such cases, and

10
11

When

then they go on to say what happens.
But the Government made a very good point and

12

said no, I shouldn't look at it that way and I should look

13

at it as if (e) governs the single-motive case and then

14

(m) comes in to govern the dual-motive case.

15

a good argument too.

16
17

And that was

And so what I'm asking you, who understands this
a little better than I do, does it matter?

18

MR. PECCOLE:

19

QUESTION:

No, it doesn't matter.

20

QUESTION:

Well, how many -- what percentage of

21
22

No.

all these cases, do you think, are single-motive cases?
MR. PECCOLE:

To guess, I would -- I would say

23

probably a vast majority of the cases are.

24

not single.

25

That's it.

Excuse me.

QUESTION:

They're -- or

Those are mixed-motive cases.

Well, you don't suggest the defendant

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

always admits liability, do you?

2

MR. PECCOLE:

3

QUESTION:

No.

If there's only issue about one

4

motive, it's always that the defendant has some kind of

5

defense in every case.

6

QUESTION:

If he stands mute, he -- he loses.

I

7

mean, under McDonnell Douglas, if the plaintiff comes in

8

with -- with a claim that this was the motive and the --

9

and the defendant doesn't come up with anything, he loses,

10

doesn't he?

11

MR. PECCOLE:

12

QUESTION:

13

Yes.

So any case that goes forward is a

mixed-motive -- is a mixed-motive case.

14

MR. PECCOLE:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. PECCOLE:

Yes.

Yes.
Yes.

And -- and the only thing --

17

the only time that I could see otherwise would be a -- a

18

specific instance where, for example, you have working

19

women in a -- in a department.

20

says we have to make a layoff because we're -- we're in

21

dire straits.

22

whole division, and then 2 weeks later they hire a whole

23

male division.

24

there and -- and you -- those are the only kind of cases I

25

can think of.

The employer comes in and

We can't afford it.

They lay off that

I think that you have the single motive

QUESTION:

2

MR. PECCOLE:

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. PECCOLE:

5
6

Yes, they settle, don't they?
Yes.

I -- I would entertain any other

further questions.
I think that one -- one other point I would like

7

to make is that 703(m) and the way the Ninth Circuit has

8

approached it, has made it simple and easy for the judges

9

to handle, for the trial attorneys to handle, and for the

10

jury to handle through instructions.

11

much easier way of handling these type cases.

12

It's a -- it's a

It -- it's like any other civil case basically.

13

Plaintiff has to come in and show by a preponderance of

14

the evidence that it's entitled to what it's -- it's

15

saying it's entitled to, that certain things occurred.

16

Then the defense can either sit back and say, well, wait a

17

second, you didn't prove your case, or the defense can

18

say, well, maybe there's a motivating factor here.

19

after I presented valid reasons for the termination, for

20

example, then what they'll do is they'll say, well, maybe

21

I want this instruction that limits my damages.

22

it's a simple structure, and we have got to get to that.

23

I mean, it is --

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. PECCOLE:

Even

But it --

But if you -- if you --- so chaotic out there in the

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

circuits right now, it's just unbelievable.
QUESTION:

2

If you were right, Mr. Peccole, about

3

(m) taking over the field so that every case becomes a

4

mixed-motive case, why would Congress have added not even

5

if, but even though other factors also motivated the

6

practice?
MR. PECCOLE:

7

I don't think it has anything

8

actually to do with the mixed-motive.

9

-- they're saying is even if that -- that kind of evidence

10

is present.

12

In any event, you succeed.

QUESTION:

11

I think what it is

Well, if they said whether or not,

then --

13

MR. PECCOLE:

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- I would see your point clearly.
They said even

15

But they didn't say whether or not.

16

though, which seems to assume that two -- at least two

17

motivating factors have been shown:

18

another motive -- another even though another motivating

19

factor existed.

20

MR. PECCOLE:

one, sex; two,

I think if you read the any

21

employment practice means any.

And I think what it does

22

is it takes away from that last sentence or phrase.

23

it's done is it's basically said any employment practice

24

where you can show that gender, for example, is a

25

motivating factor, you've proven your case.

What

It doesn't

39
Alderson Reporting Company

1

make any difference whether there's other factors present,

2

whether they're legitimate or illegitimate.

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Peccole.

Mr. Ricciardi, you have 2 minutes left.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK J. RICCIARDI

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RICCIARDI:

7

I'd like to call the Court's

8

attention to the joint appendix, page 17, the middle of

9

the page.

It's the jury instructions colloquy.

The court

10

says, all right, may I hear from the defense?

11

yes, Your Honor.

12

instructions 1 through 9.

13

motive case, and under Price Waterhouse, direct evidence

14

is required.

15

We have no objections to the court's
I believe this is not a mixed-

I should have said 1 through 8.

16

question about that.

17

appeal for several reasons.

18

And I say,

There's no

I don't think that's fatal to this

There's no question that the trial judge was on

19

full notice of my position that it was not a -- it was not

20

a Price Waterhouse case.

21

QUESTION:

You also should have said, I believe

22

this is a mixed-motive case, not I believe this is not,

23

shouldn't you?

You had a bad morning I think.

24

(Laughter.)

25

QUESTION:

Did you think it was a mixed-motive

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

case or not?
MR. RICCIARDI:

2

No.

No, Your Honor, it was not.

3

It was a McDonnell Douglas case.

4

if you look back to the actual jury instruction that was

5

given, number 7 on page 32 --

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. RICCIARDI:

8

case.

9

this for many years.

10

I see.

We should have gotten --

Okay.

It was not a Price Waterhouse

That's why I'm here today.

I've been living with

But jury instruction number 7 was the 2(a)(1)

11

because of language, and the trial judge was on notice

12

from our colloquy on my motion for judgment as a matter of

13

law, which starts on page 15, that I was objecting that

14

the prima facie case hadn't been shown.

15

issue raised to show pretext.

16

There was no jury

Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit, both the panel

17

and the full en banc court, passed on the propriety of the

18

mixed-motive instruction and never once had any problem

19

with the way I had preserved the objection.

20

And then finally, in this Court, in the -- in

21

the petition for certiorari, we formulated the question,

22

and in the opposition, which I believe is an optional

23

filing, the opposition to the petition for certiorari

24

raises nothing about instruction number 9 or the 2(m)

25

formulation.

And it was only for the very first time in

41

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

any of these many appeals was it raised in the merits

So I believe -CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr.

Ricciardi.

5

The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
