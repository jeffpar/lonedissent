ORAL ARGUMENT OF FELIX LEATHERWOOD

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

11

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:
Respondent has prompted the Nevada courts to

12

extend their authority over California's tax process.

The

13

Nevada court has said at Joint Appendix 138, the entire

14

process, of FTB audits of Hyatt, including the FTB's

15

assessment of taxes and the protests, is at issue in this

16

case, end quote.

17

Appendix 138, that the tax process is under attack.

18

This lawsuit interferes with California's

This has been said to mean, at Joint

19

capacity to administer these taxes.

20

taxes is a core, sovereign responsibility from which all

21

functions of State Government depend on.

22

by immunity laws of common-law tort lawsuits, like the

23

kind presented by Respondent.

24
25

The administration of

It is protected

California has invoked the protection of its
immunity laws, but the Nevada courts have allowed

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

respondents laws to proceed, not by extending full faith

2

and credit.

3

system for cooperative federalism in violation of Article

4

IV, Section 1 of the United States Code.

And this refusal threatens our constitutional

QUESTION:

5

Mr. Leatherwood, may I ask you a

6

threshold question?

Some of your friends in this case

7

have invited an overruling of Nevada against Hall.

8

course, California was favored by that decision.

9

join in the plea to overrule Nevada v. Hall, or do you say

10

this case is different because it involves core sovereign

11

functions?
MR. LEATHERWOOD:

12

Of

Do you

Justice Ginsberg, we do not

13

join in the chorus to overrule Nevada v. Hall.

14

is different.

15

Hall.

16

the sense that it does -- it does not implicate another

17

state managing another state's core sovereign function.

18

It's -- Nevada v. Hall was strictly an automobile

19

accident.

20

This case

This case goes to footnote 24 of Nevada v.

It's our feeling that Nevada v. Hall is good law in

QUESTION:

But the comparison would be between

21

the university, education, which was the -- which was the

22

defendant, and the tax authorities.

23

education and tax, seem core.

24

compare the tort itself, it would be a comparison between

25

negligent driving, on the one hand, and going into another

Both of those,

Or if you're going to

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

state and committing -- you know, peering through windows,

2

going through garbage, totally wrongly getting all the

3

neighbors to reveal private information, et cetera.

4

comparing the particular acts, what's the difference, or

5

comparing sovereign functions, what's the difference?

6
7

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

So

I mean, compared -- I thank

you, Your Honor -- in comparing the sovereign functions --

8

QUESTION:

Education versus tax.

9

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

Yeah, and driving an

10

automobile in another state's -- on another state's

11

highway --

12

QUESTION:

That's not the sovereign function.

13

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

16

QUESTION:

That's not --

I'm saying that --- the sovereign function.

-- it seems like that's apples and

17

oranges to me.

18

the acts they're complaining of, and here the plaintiff is

19

complaining of acts that took place in Nevada that were

20

miles outside what would be reasonable.

21

he's right, but that's his complaint.

22

they were complaining about negligent driving.

23

the difference there?

24
25

That is, in the one case, we're looking at

I'm not saying

In Nevada v. Hall,
So what's

Or, alternatively, in Nevada v. Hall, it was a
driver who worked for a university, and here it is an

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

investigator who works for the tax board.

2

difference there?
MR. LEATHERWOOD:

3

So what's the

Well, to answer the Court's

4

question directly, the most significant difference is that

5

the tax function is -- is much more significant than the

6

education function.

7

QUESTION:

Well, that's -- that -- that --that

8

would be a very difficult premise for us to say, that

9

education is somehow secondary.
MR. LEATHERWOOD:

10

QUESTION:

11

Well --

You're -- you're saying Nevada can't

12

have a great university -- can have a great university by

13

keeping its people within its own borders.

14

to California to get information to solicit, to recruit

15

students?

16

for us to write on that premise.

17
18
19

They can't go

That -- that would be a very difficult decision

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

No, Your Honor, I would agree

with you that that would be a difficult -QUESTION:

For the State of California to argue

20

that education is not a core state function is, to me,

21

rather astounding.

22

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

No, Your Honor, I'm not

23

arguing that education is not a core sovereign function.

24

What I'm arguing is that taxation is an essential core

25

sovereign function since that education cannot move

forward --

2

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. --

3

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

4

QUESTION:

-- to provide taxation.

-- Leatherwood, we -- this Court

5

tried to follow a core state function test under the Tenth

6

Amendment.

7

as being an unworkable thing.

8

resurrect that here?

9

well, if the Court wants to overrule Nevada v. Hall,

And in Garcia, kind of gave it up, didn't it,
Now, why would we want to

And why is it that you don't say,

10

that's fine; I'll win.

11

position.

12

rejected under the Tenth Amendment in Garcia, but you

13

don't want to say, sure, if you want to overrule Nevada v.

14

Hall, be my guest.

15

I mean, I don't understand your

You're asking us to go back to a test that we

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

Yes, Your Honor.

Justice

16

O'Connor, what we are attempting to say here is that this

17

case is more analogous to this Court's jurisprudence in

18

the area of the Federal Tax Injunction Act along the line

19

of fair assessment -- the fair assessment cases, where the

20

Court has directed that the Federal Government will back

21

off on trying to manage state taxes.

22

QUESTION:

There you have a specific act of

23

Congress that tells the Federal Government to back off.

24

And I don't believe you have any such thing here.

25

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

But we do have the Full Faith

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

and Credit Clause, which directs that a state is to

2

recognize the public acts of another state.

3

have an immunity law applicable here, and this directs

4

that Nevada should respect the immunity laws of the State

5

of California.

6

instance, provide absolute immunity for conduct as

7

undertaken in a -- in a tax audit.

8

associated with tax audit, is protected.

And the immunity law, in this particular

QUESTION:

9

And we do

Anything that's

But Nevada did recognize California

10

law to the extent it was similar to Nevada's -- that is,

11

saying you had immunity from the negligent acts.

12

it went on to say, no, you don't have immunity from

13

intentional acts, even though California law does give

14

immunity from intentional acts.

15

go to the extreme that you would say someone could come

16

over to Las Vegas from California and just beat up

17

somebody because they haven't paid their taxes, would

18

they?

19
20

MR. LEATHERWOOD:
Court on that point.
QUESTION:

22

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

23

QUESTION:

25

But surely you wouldn't

Absolutely, I agree with the

The --

21

24

And then

Why not?
-- the extension of that --

Why do you agree on that point?

I

don't understand that?
MR. LEATHERWOOD:

Because the extension of our

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

immunity law does not cover physical torts or torts --

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

6
7

Oh.
-- outside the scope --

I see.
-- of course, the scope of --

of the -- the acts that are incidental to -QUESTION:

I see.

So under California law,

8

there would be -- that would be actionable; whereas, under

9

Nevada law, here, what they're doing is actionable.

You

10

just want to use the California standard rather -- rather

11

than the Nevada standard.

12

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

Well, in fact, Your Honor, if

13

they would use the Nevada standard, use the same standard

14

that Nevada applies to its own taxing agencies, then this

15

case would be on a hold.

16

particular case is that it has gone outside its own

17

precedent and applied a different standard to California

18

taxing agencies, and it's not --

19

QUESTION:

What Nevada has done in this

But that's not what they're -- the

20

Nevada court said, we're going to treat the tax collectors

21

from anywhere who come in to our state and act here, and

22

we're going to -- the Nevada Supreme Court said, we're

23

going to apply our rule, and our rule is negligence,

24

there's immunity; intentional, there isn't.

25

asking us to discredit or disbelieve the Nevada Supreme

So you're

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Court when it said, the law we apply to tax collectors who

2

act in this state is the same as we apply to Nevada tax

3

collectors.

4

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

Your Honor, I am not asking

5

this Court to not believe the Nevada Supreme Court.

6

what I'm saying is that Nevada has published precedent, as

7

recent as 1989, where it requires that a taxpayer forego

8

bringing a lawsuit until they -- until there has been --

9

until there's a resolution of all statutory procedures.

10

QUESTION:

But

Oh, but this -- but Nevada Supreme

11

Court, I thought, made very clear that what they were

12

dealing with is tortious conduct, harassing conduct.

13

They, in fact, refused -- Nevada Supreme Court refused to

14

decide where this man was domiciled, because that would

15

interfere with the ongoing procedure in California on the

16

tax liability.

17

had made it clear that they were dealing with the way

18

their resident is being harassed and not with where he was

19

domiciled on a magic date.

20

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

I thought that the Nevada Supreme Court

Your Honor, what has happened

21

in this particular case, 97 percent of the conduct that

22

occurred during the course of this audit occurred in

23

California.

24

Nevada is doing is permitting Mr. Hyatt to go behind the

25

actual tort and make a collateral attack on the tax

And, quite naturally, what Nevada is -- what

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

itself.
QUESTION:

Well, that may be, but the that isn't

3

the issue that we've got in front of us here.

4

question in front of us is not how far can the Nevada

5

courts go in reviewing California's tax practice.

6

issue before us is, among others, in a claim of tort

7

against your -- your operative in Nevada, for the manner

8

in which the tax is collected is their absolute immunity.

9

And, you know, maybe the Nevada courts are going too far

10
11

I mean, the

The

in discovery, but that's not the issue in front of us.
MR. LEATHERWOOD:

I would absolutely agree with

12

the Court that the issue is whether or not Nevada was

13

obligated to apply our immunity laws with respect --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

16

undertaken incidental to this audit.

17

QUESTION:

All right.
-- with respect to conduct

May I go back to Justice Stevens'

18

question, because I'm not sure of your answer to it.

What

19

if the State of California passed a statute tomorrow

20

morning saying the use of thumbscrews in tax collection is

21

authorized?

22

question be that -- or wouldn't your answer to Justice

23

Stevens' question be that if you went into Nevada and you

24

used thumbscrews, you would be entitled, on your theory,

25

to absolute immunity?

Is -- would your answer to Justice Stevens'

Isn't that correct?

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

Your Honor, no.

What I'm

2

saying is that, under that particular theory, I do not

3

think that you could pass law in the State of California

4

that will essentially sanction a crime, and there was no

5

crimes committed within the course of this audit.

6

If the

-- if an auditor commits an intentional

7

tort, such as a burglary or a trespass in Nevada or in

8

California, it's -- it's our position that that particular

9

conduct is not incidental to --

10

QUESTION:

It doesn't matter.

I mean, we're

11

trying to get the -- we're trying to get the analysis of

12

it, and I'm having exactly the same problem.

13

there, California did say there is absolute immunity, even

14

if you beat somebody up, absolute tort immunity.

15

Even for beating people up.

16

that; you could prosecute it as a crime.

17

Nevada, and they say, the plaintiff, he beat me up, he

18

came across the state line, down from Lake Tahoe.

19

in a bad mood, lost too much money at the casino, and he

20

beat me up.

21

lawsuit or not?

22

question was.

23

All right?

Imagine that

Okay?

Now, suppose they did have
Now you're in

He was

Now, can Nevada bring that

That's, I think, what Justice Stevens'

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

Well -- well, I understand

24

that, Your Honor.

My position is that even though that

25

law does not exist in California --

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

5

Yes.
-- but applying --

If it did.
-- applying it -- my -- our

particular theory --

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

7

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

-- that, yes, we -- then

8

Nevada would be obligated under the Full Faith and Credit

9

Clause to apply that particular law.
QUESTION:

10
11

And, therefore, you could not bring

the lawsuit in Nevada about somebody beating somebody up.

12

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

15

the case.

-- if that were -- if that was

But -QUESTION:

17

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

19

If --

If that were the law in California.

16

18

But --

Yeah, okay.
-- in this particular case,

that's illegal in California and that's illegal in Nevada.
QUESTION:

So how, then, do we reconcile that

20

position, where we're back to our starting place, with the

21

fact that he could bring an action if on his way down from

22

Lake Tahoe in the state car, he happened to drive a little

23

negligently and ran somebody over?

24

v. Hall, just reverse the states.

25

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

I mean, that's Nevada

No, and we're agreeing with

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

Nevada v. Hall.
QUESTION:

I know.

So this is why we're having

3

a problem.

It's clear that if our tax collector, on his

4

way down from Lake Tahoe, runs over a Nevada resident, the

5

Nevada resident can sue and apply Nevada law.

6

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

7

QUESTION:

Yes, I --

You say, if, in fact, that same tax

8

collector beats up somebody, and the California law is

9

that you cannot sue, Nevada cannot apply its own law.

10

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

That's not what I'm saying,

11

Your Honor.

I'm saying if that conduct -- if that conduct

12

is connected to the actual audit itself, then it's

13

protected.

14

under any possible theory, that a beating, that it -- that

15

breaking into someone's house could actually be part of

16

the assessment -- tax assessment process.

17

engages in that kind of behavior, the auditor is not

18

covered under the absolute immunity.

19

scope of that --

But what I'm saying, I cannot possibly see,

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

22

QUESTION:

If an auditor

That is outside the

Okay.
-- of that statute.

And is the reason that the answer is

23

different in the two cases, the reason that there is

24

something special about tax collection or is the reason

25

that there is a closer connection in the hypo of the

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

beating up for tax collection than the driving the

2

automobile for tax collection?

3

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

4

QUESTION:

Well --

Which is it?

Is it the nature of the

5

tax collection or the nature of the activity which leads

6

to the tort liability?
MR. LEATHERWOOD:

7

Well, I think it's both, Your

8

Honor.

Well, first of all, tax -- tax collection, by

9

definition, is an intrusion of someone's life.

The

10

allegations alleged here are principally invasion of

11

privacy, disclosure of information, that sort of thing.

12

Ninety-seven percent of that conduct occurred in

13

California.

14

Mr. Hyatt's case without intruding into that tax --

15

You cannot possibly investigate or prosecute

QUESTION:

Mr. Leatherwood, if I understand your

16

position, it would be exactly the same if a hundred

17

percent of the conduct had occurred in Nevada.

18
19
20

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

That

-- but -- but -QUESTION:

But the problem I have -- may I just

21

ask this question.

Assume there is a -- there's a

22

difference between Nevada law and California law, as I

23

understand it.

24

people in one state and not the other.

Some things are actionable against a tax
Why is it, in your

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

later, but by Nevada tax collectors instead of by

2

California tax collectors, because he's been in both

3

states and probably is subject to tax in both, Nevada

4

would allow the suit against its own tax people but not

5

allow it against the California tax people?

6

make sense?
MR. LEATHERWOOD:

7

Why does that

Well, Your Honor, in this

8

particular case, as I've indicated, according to our

9

reading of Nevada precedent, published precedent, that

10

they would not permit this lawsuit to proceed until the

11

tax process has been concluded.

12

directly answer your question, it does not appear that

13

Nevada would prosecute its own -- would permit a

14

prosecution of its own agents in the case where the

15

allegations are principally that there is an intrusion

16

into Mr. Hyatt's life or that there -QUESTION:

17

With respect to -- to

Well, we understood the reasoning of

18

the Nevada Supreme Court to say they would.

19

must have misread the opinion.
MR. LEATHERWOOD:

20

I think -- I

Is that --

No, absolutely not, Your

21

Honor.

I don't think you misread the opinion.

What I

22

think the Nevada Supreme Court said is that they will

23

permit intentional tort prosecution of government

24

employees.

25

employee.

This case does not involve a government
This case involves a government agency itself,

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

a tax agency.

2

against the Nevada tax agency without first exhausting

3

your administrative and statutory remedies to contest the

4

underlying tax itself.

5

And under Nevada law, you cannot proceed

QUESTION:

But certainly this sort of thing

6

isn't the kind of thing you could have exhausted your

7

remedies on, is it?

8
9

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

In

our -- in our -- it is our position that this entire --

10

the entire lawsuit is linked up to our tax process,

11

because the conduct that the Respondent is complaining

12

about here is that the tax itself is -- the tax itself and

13

the tax process is engaged in bad faith.

14

QUESTION:

And I would --

Now, what is -- was your answer to

Suppose that this tax collector were

15

the question?

16

driving negligently in Nevada --

17

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

18

QUESTION:

Part --

Suppose the tax collector were

19

driving negligently in Las Vegas.

20

the tax collector to go examine the record, and he's

21

driving negligently.

22

It's very important for

What --

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

I think, under Nevada v. Hall,

23

he would be -- he would be subject to negligent liability.

24

It's not connected to a core silent function because the

25

function here is -- the function here is a tax

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

investigation, whereas, driving is something that you can

2

investigate independent of the tax process itself.
QUESTION:

3

So suppose that we -- we conclude

4

that footnote 24 does not provide sufficient guidance for

5

us to have a stable jurisprudence and that you will lose

6

unless Nevada versus Hall is overruled.

7

ask us to overrule Nevada versus Hall?

8

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

9

QUESTION:

10

Would you then

Your Honor --

I know you don't want to entertain

that possibility, but suppose that's what we conclude.
MR. LEATHERWOOD:

11

Well, we -- we've thought

12

about this, Your Honor, of course, and we would accept a

13

win, if that's the Court's direction, through overruling

14

Nevada v. Hall, but it's our contention that the Court

15

doesn't have to go that far to get -- to get to this

16

point.

17

protections that are provided to state tax systems within

18

the federal system itself.

19

The Court can literally analogize to the special

QUESTION:

But then that, as I suggested

20

earlier, is a difficult thing to do, because there are

21

congressional statutes that mandate that here.

22

have is the Full Faith and Credit Clause.

23

you say that's sufficient, but isn't it possible that

24

there might be other emanations of the Full Faith and

25

Credit Clause, other than just footnote 24, or whatever it

And all we

is, in Nevada against Hall.

2

overruling it, but developing it, perhaps.
MR. LEATHERWOOD:

3

I'm not talking about

Yes, Your Honor.

I would

4

agree with that.

Of course, we think that Nevada's

5

failure to recognize or give dignity to California's

6

immunity statute is not only a violation of the Full Faith

7

and Credit Clause, but is a hostile act, and this kind of

8

hostility is contrary to our whole concept of -QUESTION:

What -- what about a congressional

10

statute?

11

your objection -- I know you'll object to this possible

12

opinion, and I want to hear what your objection is -- the

13

opinion says they're complaining here, as far as we're

14

concerned, with a serious tort, invasion of privacy, you

15

know, a whole lot of really bad behavior, et cetera --

16

they're complaining about that taking place by a

17

California official in Nevada, and we can't really

18

distinguish that from the automobile accident taking place

19

in Nevada.

20

you know, this is worse conduct.

21

investigation of this may interfere with California's tax

authority's ability to sort of run investigations in

25

That is, suppose the opinion read -- what would

They're both torts.

They're both very bad -Now, it's true that our

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

Well, that still creates --

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

that still creates the situation where Nevada is

2

supervising and managing California's tax practices.
QUESTION:

3
4

Back to activities happening in

Nevada.
MR. LEATHERWOOD:

5

Yeah.

In this lawsuit -- this

6

lawsuit is -- is being prosecuted -- is being investigated

7

almost exclusively in California.

8

here, the interference here, is that Nevada has permitted

9

Mr. Hyatt to use this lawsuit both as a -- as a wall and a

The -- the intrusion

10

battering ram.

It has almost suppressed the entire

11

California tax investigation.

12

class of possible plaintiffs that can sue California just

13

for literally going across the state line and making an

14

inquiry as to whether or not a former California resident,

15

a former California taxpayer, actually owes any taxes.
QUESTION:

16

It's creating an entire

Well, they would have to show its an

17

intentional -- whatever that means under Nevada law -- not

18

just negligent wouldn't they -MR. LEATHERWOOD:

19

Well, the intentional act here

20

is that California created a tax system in bad faith to --

21

bad faith to extort an exit -- an exit tax from -- from a

22

taxpayer.

23

QUESTION:

I thought that, again, the Nevada

24

Supreme Court said, we are not going to touch the question

25

of where this man was domiciled.

That's for California to

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

decide.

2

allegation was trespass and going through the man's trash,

3

and another was calling -- maybe the calls emanated in

4

California -- calling people in Nevada insinuating bad

5

things about this person.

6

where the man is domiciled.

7

California is deciding and Nevada says it won't touch.

8
9

What we are dealing with is this new thing.

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

One

And that has nothing to do with
It's a question that

Yeah, and I would -- I would

direct the Court to Joint Appendix 133, where -- where the

10

Court would -- the Nevada courts have indicated that

11

almost all the action in this -- in this lawsuit occurred

12

in California.

13

And --

QUESTION:

Well, you -- you recognized that

14

there were two trips into California.

15

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

Actually, Your Honor --

I mean, to Nevada.
Actually, Your Honor, I

18

believe there were three trips, and they were short trips

19

-- they were trips of extremely short duration.

20

QUESTION:

And what was there about -- on one of

21

those trips, there was a trespass on his property and

22

rummaging through his trash.

23

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

Well, that's not part of --

24

that's not part of the allegations of the -- of the

25

complaint itself.

The complaint is saying that --

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

It was a more -- a more general

2

interference with his privacy, but those were examples

3

that were alleged, if not in the complaint, somewhere.
MR. LEATHERWOOD:

4

No, there has been deposition

5

testimony that there -- on one of the trips, that the

6

investigator looked at the timing of Mr. -- of

7

Respondent's trash delivery and also looked at --

8

determined whether or not Respondent was receiving any

9

mail at that particular location.

That does not justify

10

the pervasive nature and the extent in which this lawsuit

11

has reached into California and literally attacked the tax

12

process.

13

And, once again, I will refer the Court to the

14

Joint Appendix at page 60, where it is alleged that the

15

California tax system itself is a -- is a fraud -- that

16

is, put together in bad faith for the specific purpose of

17

extorting an exit tax from former residents who -- as they

18

leave California.

19
20
21
22
23
24
25

Well, if the Court has no more questions in this
regard, I would like -QUESTION:

Do you want to reserve your time, Mr.

Leatherwood?
MR. LEATHERWOOD:

-- reserve the balance of my

time, thank you.

Mr. Farr, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR

3

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

4
5
6

MR. FARR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
In our federal system, it's recognized that the

7

states will sometimes have overlapping jurisdiction.

When

8

that happens, the Constitution allows each state to apply

9

its own laws against the background principle of comity

10

where they believe it would be appropriate to defer to the

11

laws of another state.

12

courts here have applied these principles very carefully.

And I submit that the Nevada

13

Nevada, of course, correctly held that they were

14

not required to apply California's legislative-created law

15

of immunity.

16

principles of comity to strike out the declaratory

17

judgment count that would have gone to the very issue that

18

is being contested in the Florida -- excuse me -- in the

19

California tax proceeding, which is the date that

20

Mr. Hyatt moved to Nevada.

21

California complete immunity for any negligence that it

22

has committed.

23
24
25

At the same time, however, they have applied

And they have also given

So in this case, it seems to me, the system is
working -QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, can I ask you, do you think

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

they were compelled by the Full Faith and Credit Clause to

2

grant immunity on the negligence claim?
MR. FARR:

3

That's an interesting question,

4

Justice Stevens, because Nevada officials themselves have

5

immunity.

6

whether the Full Faith and Credit Clause requires that.

7

My general feeling is probably not, but that is really not

8

a question so much of whether -- a choice of law between

9

California law and Nevada law, but simply a question of

There would be a question, I suppose, of

10

what Nevada law would apply.

So I don't think that the

11

Full Faith and Credit Clause itself speaks to that issue,

12

but I do think principles of comity will traditionally

13

reach that result.

And, in fact --

14

QUESTION:

15

dictated by the Constitution?

16

MR. FARR:

They are --

17

QUESTION:

-- suppose Nevada said they were not

18
19

Well, are principles of comity
Suppose --

going to grant comity?
MR. FARR:

That's correct, yes.

And I don't

20

think there is a federally enforceable law of state

21

comity, but I think that is the system that has existed

22

essentially between sovereigns for much longer than the

23

United States is --

24

QUESTION:

25

Well, is it your position then the

private plaintiff can always bring suit against a state in

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

the courts of another state?
MR. FARR:

Well, the first question, of course,

3

is whether the court has legislative -- the first Full

4

Faith and Credit question is whether the court in which

5

the suit is brought has legislative jurisdiction.

6

there is a requirement that that state have

7

constitutionally sufficient contacts with the law --

8
9
10

QUESTION:

Well, then under due process.

So

Well,

that's easy to satisfy.
MR. FARR:

So assuming that they've satisfied

11

that, they are entitled to bring a suit.

Then the

12

question is whether the state -- and I -- and I believe at

13

that point the state is free to apply its own laws to

14

protect its own interests.

15

Faith and Credit Clause allows.

16

comity that provides the acknowledgment of the state --

17

the other state's interests.

18

fact, what's happened since Nevada --

I think that's what the Full
And it is the doctrine of

And that's typically, in

19

QUESTION:

It's very --

20

MR. FARR: -- versus Hall --

21

QUESTION:

-- it's very odd to me that

22

California can't be sued in its own courts and it can't be

23

sued in a federal court, but it can be sued in a Nevada

24

court, which, if we follow that declension really has the

25

-- has the least interest in maintaining the dignity of

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

the State of California.
MR. FARR:

Well, there are two -- two factors

3

here, Justice Kennedy.

First of all, there is the fact

4

that Nevada has some very real interests of its own, its

5

own sovereign interests to protect here.

6

have been torts which were both committed in Nevada and

7

directed at a Nevada resident.

8

one gets to the immunity question, Nevada, as a sovereign

9

state, has important interests in assuring compensation

I mean, there

So, to begin with, before

10

and also in deterring that kind of conduct.

So the idea

11

that a legislatively created immunity by another state

12

should be able to prevent Nevada from protecting those

13

interests seems inconsistent with the federal system.

14

Now, if one goes beyond that to the question of

15

inherent immunity, the very idea that a state should have

16

to be subject to sue in the courts of another state, I

17

think, first of all, as you know, we don't believe that

18

issue is properly presented on the question presented in

19

this case.

20

for a moment, I think there -- there are differences if

21

one looks to the -- to the way that the -- essentially

22

immunity has been resolved in -- in the course of -- of

23

the United States.

24
25

But if you would like me to address it just

First of all, in its own courts, it has the
common-law immunity based on the idea that it is both the

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

king being sued in its own court, and also typically it is

2

also the progenitor of the law, so to speak, to Justice

3

Holmes' point.
In the United States, there's -- the courts of

4
5

the United States, there's a very specific situation.

At

6

the time of the convention, the states were, obviously,

7

forming a new sovereign, and the question of whether that

8

sovereign was going to grant them the immunity they had in

9

their own courts or whether that sovereign would be in the

10

same position essentially as foreign sovereigns typically

11

were, which is that they did not have to provide

12

sovereignty except as a matter of comity.

13

Schooner Exchange opinion.

That's The

14

But -- so the states, at that point, had a very

15

real interest in deciding that question, and they did, in

16

fact, decide that question, as the court has recognized.

17

That is not true with respect to the immunity that they

18

have had in the courts of other states.
QUESTION:

19

Is -- how does Alden fit into this?

20

In Alden, I take it the court now -- we've held that a

21

citizen of Maine suing in the State of Maine's courts

22

alleging that Maine had violated a federal law can't do

23

it.

24
25

Sovereign immunity.
All right.

Right?

That's Alden.

Suppose the citizen of Maine walks

into a New Hampshire court and brings the same lawsuit

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

against Maine, assuming New Hampshire has appropriate

2

jurisdiction under its own laws.

3

MR. FARR:

Uh-huh.

4

QUESTION:

Do we get a different result?

5

MR. FARR:

Okay, I think that is not a question

6

that is within the notion of the question in this case.

7

QUESTION:

No, no, well --

8

MR. FARR:

I'm sorry.

9

QUESTION:

-- you see, what I --

10

MR. FARR:

Excuse me.

11

QUESTION:

-- nonetheless, although --

12

MR. FARR:

No, I --

13

QUESTION:

-- what I'm trying to do is -- is

I --

14

sort out what, in my mind, are a set of impossible

15

anomalies, and that's why I ask you that question.

16
17

MR. FARR:

I'm sorry.

I started to answer in

the wrong way.

18

QUESTION:

Go ahead.

19

MR. FARR:

What I -- I reserve, of course, the

20

point, always, that I don't believe this is within the

21

question presented.

22

QUESTION:

Yeah, yeah, of course.

23

MR. FARR:

But I actually was going -- what I

24

meant to say is that I don't think it's the same kind of

25

question in the sense that I think still when you're

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

talking about enforcement of a federal cause of action in

2

another state, that is still really a federal-state

3

question.

4

QUESTION:

See, but --

5

MR. FARR:

That's still --

6

QUESTION:

-- your answer, then --

7

MR. FARR:

-- an evolving question.

8

QUESTION:

9

-- your answer to my question is

Alden cannot be avoided simply by the Maine citizen

10

walking into a New Hampshire court and bringing the same

11

case.

12

MR. FARR:

That's correct.

13

QUESTION:

All right.

14

MR. FARR:

I think that is --

15

QUESTION:

And I would guess that's right.

16

MR. FARR:

-- still a federal-state --

17

QUESTION:

All right, assuming that's right --

18

MR. FARR:

-- I think that is still a federal-

19
20

state issue.
QUESTION:

-- assuming that's right, now, look

21

at the tremendous anomaly, which you were just about to

22

address, and I want to be sure you do.

23

Maine walks into the New Hampshire court and sues the

24

State of Maine under federal law.

25

can't do it because of sovereign immunity.

Our citizen of

And the answer is, he
Our citizen of

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Maine does the same thing, but this time his cause of

2

action is state law.

And now you say he can do it.

3

MR. FARR:

That's right.

And --

4

QUESTION:

And the only difference between the

5

two cases is that his cause of action is federal law in

6

the first case, and he can't sue the state; but state law

7

in the second case, and he can, which, of course, means

8

that the law of New Hampshire binds Maine in a way that

9

federal law cannot.

Now, that, to me, I just can't --

10

that, to me, seems so anomalous that -- that I'd like an

11

explanation --

12

MR. FARR:

Well --

13

QUESTION:

-- if you can give it.

And you see

14

how I'm thinking of it as connected here, because the

15

facts here are just part of that general anomaly.

16

MR. FARR:

That's correct.

Actually, Justice

17

Breyer, I think that's something that the court, to some

18

extent, addressed in Alden itself --

19

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

20

MR. FARR:

-- in distinguishing the opinion in

21

Nevada versus Hall, when it noted that when you get into

22

the situation of a state being sued in the courts of

23

another state and, as in Nevada versus Hall, under a state

24

cause of action, you have now implicated the sovereignty

25

of a second sovereign.

So when one is now looking at the

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

-- at the issues of sovereign immunity, one is looking at

2

a different platform of issues and also at a different

3

historical base.

4

QUESTION:

But that seems to make their case

5

even harder.

It would be difficult to conceive that the

6

framers thought that Virginia could be sued in

7

Pennsylvania but not in a federal court.

8

that the presumption would be that this was an even

9

stronger case for the exercise of sovereign immunity than

10

when all of the citizens of the union are involved as in

11

the Alden situation --

I would think

12

MR. FARR:

Well, I think that --

13

QUESTION:

-- in the Eleventh Amendment.

14

MR. FARR:

I mean, I think that there are two

I mean, first of all, the question is

15

things going on.

16

not whether they can be sued, but if not, why not.

17

example, with Pennsylvania and Virginia, as I'm sure the

18

Court is aware, had a -- Nathan versus Virginia is a case

19

in which that very situation came up.

20

of Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Attorney General urged

21

its own courts to recognize sovereign immunity.

22

could naturally fit within the idea that Schooner Exchange

23

has made clear, which is that when you're talking about

24

co-equal sovereigns of that nature, one is talking about

25

sovereignty that -- excuse me, immunity that is extended

For

But in the courts

So that

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

as a matter of comity, not as a matter of absolute right

2

of the other sovereign.

3

the reason is that if you don't allow the sovereign to

4

execute its own laws within its own territory, you're

5

depriving that sovereign of part of its sovereignty.
QUESTION:

6

And the reason is -- excuse me --

Well, doesn't our original

7

jurisdiction as the states between states bear something

8

on this question?
MR. FARR:

9

It bears a little bit.

But, of

10

course, Article III itself is not a exclusive jurisdiction

11

provision.

12

jurisdiction with respect to suits between states.

The Section 1251 provides exclusive

QUESTION:

13

The idea that the framers would

14

provide for its original jurisdiction in the Supreme Court

15

in -- for suits by one state against another suggests they

16

thought it might be pretty hard to bring such a suit

17

anywhere else.
MR. FARR:

18

Well, and they -- certainly as a

19

practical matter, they would have been right, Mr. Chief

20

Justice.

21

been difficult to bring a suit against a state, either in

22

its own courts or in the courts of another state.

23

even since Nevada versus Hall, typically states have

24

granted immunity to other states for when they're sued in

25

their own courts.

I mean, as a practical matter, it has always

I mean,

And if they haven't granted absolute

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

immunity, what they have done, which I think is an

2

important principle emerging -- emerging principle of

3

comity, is they have tended to look at their own immunity

4

to see what kinds of suits could be brought against them

5

and to try, then, to grant to the -- to the outside

6

sovereign that same type of immunity.
QUESTION:

7

Mr. Farr, have you found other

8

examples around the country of suits by citizens of one

9

state against another state in the other state's courts?

10

MR. FARR:

I --

11

QUESTION:

Is this relatively rare, or is it

12

happening?

And in what context is it happening?

MR. FARR:

13

It's relatively rare, and -- but

14

there have been some suits.

There are a few of them cited

15

in our red brief, if I can find the page number, pages 38

16

and 39.

17

suits involving the release of dangerous persons within

18

another state who have created injury to citizens --

The -- there are suits, for example, negligence

19

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

20

MR. FARR:

-- of that state.

There are more

21

commercial-type things involving contracts or -- one, in

22

particular, is a it for invasion of privacy when someone

23

who wrote a book disclosed information.

24

though, Justice O'Connor, as I say, some of those suits,

25

the courts have just said, we're not going to hear them

In general,

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

whether you have a valid cause of action or not.

We're

2

simply not going to -- going to recognize that in our

3

courts because of the sovereignty of the defendant.

4

courts have said, yes, we will open our courts, but we are

5

going to look to our own immunity to try to have

6

essentially a baseline to measure the sort of immunity

7

that we are going to --

Other

QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, are you saying --

9

MR. FARR:

-- accept.

10

-- that that, too, is just a matter

11

of comity?

MR. FARR:

I do think that that's --

Doesn't --

14

MR. FARR:

-- just a matter --

15

QUESTION:

-- doesn't the Privileges and

16

Immunities Clause of Article IV have something to say?

17

you can treat a tax collector from California differently

18

from the tax collector in Nevada, you're not giving their

19

tax collectors equal privileges and immunities in Nevada.

MR. FARR:

that the question -QUESTION:

Yes.

If one -- you said that the

only stopper was a notion of comity, and I'm suggesting

that you might not be able to treat two officials, one

I don't think they

But, as I say, the -- the notion that comity is

21

-- is something that -- that doesn't have a force, even

22

though it's not federal enforceable, it seems to me is a

23

little bit of a misperception.

24

goes back to the notion of the law of nations or separate

25

sovereigns, comity essentially has been the provision that

QUESTION:

Well, there is some reluctance to say

3

that California officials can run amok in Nevada without

4

Nevada being able to do anything about it.

5

it were a pervasive practice, Nevada might be able to sue

6

California in the original jurisdiction under some parens

7

patriae theory.

8
9

I suppose if

I'm not sure about that.

MR. FARR:

Well, I mean, let me suggest a couple

of other possibilities, Justice Kennedy, as well.

I don't

10

-- I don't know whether the court would take original

11

jurisdiction of that question or not, but, I mean, the

12

most direct example of something states could do,

13

obviously, is they could reach agreements between

14

themselves.

15

court involving suits against states in the courts of

16

other states.

17

This is California in Nevada's courts.

18

who are neighboring states, feel that this is an issue

19

that they need to address, they could reach some sort of

20

agreement and, therefore, have reciprocal legislation.

21

I mean, there have been two cases before this

One was Nevada in California's courts.
If those states,

And, for example, under the Full Faith and

22

Credit Clause for years, as the Court may know, there is a

23

doctrine that said that states didn't have to enforce the

24

penal laws of another state, even though Full Faith and

25

Credit, on its face, would make you feel that maybe they

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

would have to.
But, in fact, states eventually began, through

3

reciprocal agreements in decisions, and I think in

4

legislation also, to say, you know, we essentially will

5

enforce the penal laws or the tax laws of other states, so

6

long as they do for us.

So, again, the states --

7

QUESTION:

Penal laws or penal judgments?

8

MR. FARR:

No, no, penal judgments, the court

9

said in -- in Milwaukee County, have to be enforced, but

10

they -- they distinguished at that point, Mr. Chief

11

Justice, the idea that a law itself would have to be

12

enforced before it had been reduced to --

13

QUESTION:

Right, but what -- what -- what is

14

the -- I don't want to -- I don't want you to get

15

distracted, because I thought Justice Ginsberg and maybe

16

Justice Kennedy and I were driving at the same problem,

17

which is that imagine Nevada v. Hall is good law.

18

right, now, the question comes up, How do you prevent

19

Nevada from going wild?

MR. FARR:

-- excuse me -- comity is --

in a sense.

MR. FARR:

Yeah, I mean --

17

QUESTION:

Voluntary restraint.

18

MR. FARR:

Excuse me.

It is,

I don't -- I certainly

19

don't mean to minimize the theoretical possibility that

20

suits in courts of one state could ultimately prove to be

21

a problem, generally.

22

is nothing, first of all, in the history of the Full Faith

23

and Credit Clause that would suggest that once a state has

24

proper legislative jurisdiction, as I think everybody

25

concedes that Nevada does here, that somehow that clause

What I'm suggesting is that there

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

was intended to displace the law of that state simply

2

because another state had made different policy choices

3

about, let's say, here, compensation and immunity.

4

QUESTION:

But can you say that categorically

5

and absolutely?

6

permutations of facts that could come up.

7

I mean, there are all sorts of

MR. FARR:

Well, what -- the permutations of

8

facts, I think, go particularly to what constitutes

9

legislative jurisdiction.

So perhaps in that sense, my

10

statement is broader, or seems broader in the context of

11

this case than I mean it to be.

12

think, in general, that I don't see any warrant in the

13

Full Faith and Credit Clause, given the fact that it was

14

enacted with very little debate, and almost all of the

15

debate was about judgments and not about enforcement of

16

other states' laws, I think it would be stretching the

17

clause beyond recognition to say that at some point it was

18

-- it was telling states, you're going to have to set your

19

laws aside and apply the laws of another state.

20

QUESTION:

But I do -- but I do

There was a time in the '30s and '20s

21

when this court came pretty close to that, the cases that

22

preceded Pacific Employers.

MR. FARR:

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

24

QUESTION:

Clapper and Bradford.

25

THE COURT

Yes.

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. FARR:

That's correct.

And as I think that

2

as my argument might suggest, I think the Court was

3

correct to essentially back away from that kind of

4

balancing test and essentially go back to the principle of

5

saying when a state is competent to legislate, then it may

6

apply its own laws, leaving the additional questions about

7

what might happen at that point to questions of comity

8

where a state is the defendant.

9

Nevada courts have shown considerable comity already here,

10
11

and the case, of course, is not yet concluded.
QUESTION:

Comity is something like a hearty

12

handshake.

13

put any -- any force to.

14

And, as I've suggested,

I mean, it -- it's something that you can't

MR. FARR:

That's -- that's true in one sense,
I mean, when I say it's not -- that

15

Mr. Chief Justice.

16

there's no federally enforceable state law of comity, I --

17

that's true.

18

decisions about comity since back in the late 18th century

19

have emphasized that it is a serious doctrine.

20

doctrine built of respect for -- for other sovereigns.

21

And in particular -- and I think this -- this is -- also

22

goes to the practical problem that Justices Kennedy and

23

Breyer are asking about -- it also does have a healthy

24

measure of self interest in it.

25

But at the same time, I mean, the Court's

It's a

I mean, when -- when you are talking about co-

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

equal sovereigns, any sovereign that is exercising

2

jurisdiction over another sovereign understands that

3

that's -- the first sovereign -- or the second sovereign

4

has the same power and authority over it.
QUESTION:

5

Is -- is the question of comity one

6

that has a federal component so that this court should

7

weigh in on when it has to be exercised?
MR. FARR:

8
9

I don't believe so state versus

state, Justice O'Connor.

Or course, in the -- in the

10

types of cases that the board was referring to this

11

morning, like McNary, there are comity elements.

12

there -- and there is a jurisprudence of this court with

13

respect to federal and state relations which does depend

14

on comity, and that is, of course, federally enforceable.

15

I don't believe that there is a concomitant enforceable

16

doctrine

And

--

17

QUESTION:

But you're arguing --

18

MR. FARR:

-- state to state.

19

QUESTION:

Even in the face -- even in the face

20

of some development by state -- a state court that seems

21

totally out of whack with our constitutional structure?

22
23
24
25

MR. FARR:

Well, Justice O'Connor, I suppose I

QUESTION:

Are there no extremes?

should -Is there no

limitation?

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. FARR:

Well, I -- I mean, I'm -- I suppose I

2

should pause in the sense that -- that if there is

3

something that is so threatening to the constitutional

4

structure and something for which there is no historical

5

basis in -- in terms of the -- the way that sovereigns

6

deal with each other.

7

think this case is very different, because even though

8

there was certainly a practical tradition that states were

9

not to be sued in other states, as I say, since Schooner

10

Exchange, and, indeed, in Verlinden in 1980, this Court

11

has always taken the position that when you're talking

12

about relationships between sovereigns, and they're co­

13

equal sovereigns, and the issue is immunity between them,

14

that is a matter of comity.

15

QUESTION:

Now, see, that's -- that's where I

All right, but leave -- say, this

16

case, I can easily see on your theory writing the part of

17

the opinion that says the acts in Nevada, the acts in

18

Nevada that were arguably torts are certainly up to Nevada

19

to pursue.

20

went way too far in ordering discovery and ordered

21

discovery that would have been relevant only to negligent

22

action and only negligent action, really, that took place

23

in California, though a Nevada resident was at issue.

24

they can't do that, says the opinion, because -- because

25

-- and now this is where it seems to me there -- something

But the discovery commissioner here, they say,

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

And

1

-- what do I fill that blank with.

2

They can't go over and, in Nevada, complain about

3

negligent action as this discovery commissioner may have

4

done, negligent action in California aimed at a Nevada

5

resident where it's a tax action.

6

because -- and now what?

7

bothering me?

8
9

They can't do that.

They can't do that

You see -- do you see what's

I -- at this point, it seems to me there has to
be something in the Constitution that limits that, and

10

this case may raise that problem because of the actions of

11

the discovery commissioner.

12

need something to fill that blank with.

13
14

MR. FARR:

And, therefore, I think I

Well, as -- I don't think, to start

with, that the answer is the Full Faith and Credit Clause.

15

QUESTION:

All right, what is it?

16

MR. FARR:

I mean --

17

QUESTION:

I -- it's an odd -- an awkward

18

vehicle, Full Faith --

19

MR. FARR:

Right.

20

QUESTION:

-- but what is the answer?

21

MR. FARR:

Well, I mean, I still think that, in

22

the end, the answer is that this is a matter that one

23

trusts to the judgment of states --

24
25

QUESTION:

So the answer is if they want to do

that, they can do it.

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

MR. FARR:

-- that if, in fact, there is a

question about discovery, that --

3

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

4

MR. FARR:

-- I mean, that I -- accepting the

5

characterization, although I dispute it to some extent,

6

but to the extent there's a question about discovery, that

7

is simply part and parcel of the states being able to

8

exercise their jurisdiction.

I don't --

9

QUESTION:

I thought discovery was --

10

QUESTION:

Okay.

11

QUESTION:

-- interlocutory.

I thought that we

12

couldn't write in an opinion, as Justice Breyer has

13

suggested, if I didn't think that that question was

14

currently reviewable.

15

MR. FARR:

Well, there's certainly nothing

16

specifically in the question presented about discovery.

17

The -- the -- the -- again, to come back to the question

18

presented, because we've discussed a wide range of issues,

19

most of which I don't think are within the question

20

presented, but when we come back to the question

21

presented, the question is basically was the Nevada or the

22

Nevada courts required to dismiss this action on summary

23

judgment because of California's law of immunity?

24

and the reason for that is because, according to

25

California, the Full Faith and Credit Clause requires

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

And --

1

Nevada to enforce California's law of immunity.

2

QUESTION:

Mr. Farr --

3

MR. FARR:

Our view is -- yeah?

4

QUESTION:

-- do I understand -- your comity

5

argument basically is -- it's kind a self-executing thing,

6

because each time a state has to answer the comity

7

question, it asks the question, what would I do if the

8

tables were reversed?

9

generally treat the other sovereign the way they would

And as history teaches us, they

10

want to be treated themselves.

And that's --

11

MR. FARR:

Well --

12

QUESTION:

-- well, that's the rule that seems

13

to have been developed without any overriding

14

constitutional command order here.

15

MR. FARR:

That's correct, Justice Stevens. And,

16

in fact, they have become more specific in applying

17

comity, I believe, in saying we want to treat the other

18

sovereign as we do treat ourselves, not just as we want to

19

be treated.

20

we treat ourselves.

21

QUESTION:

We are treating the other sovereign the way

What if the -- what if the case came,

22

and they didn't do it?

Justice Breyer's question, how do

I -- if, let's say, through this

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

couldn't California bring an original action to enjoin

2

this interference?
MR. FARR:

3

I certainly think that's possible.

4

And, of course, as I've said, I mean, California can try

5

to talk to Nevada and try to reach agreement at a

6

sovereign level about this, or if, in fact -- the Full

7

Faith and Credit Clause has a specific express commitment

8

to Congress of the right to declare the effects of other

9

laws.

What would be the underlying --

QUESTION:

-- substantive law in Justice

13
14

Souter's proposed original action?
MR. FARR:

The -- I suppose, I mean, based on

what California has said before -- said up to now, it

16

would bring it under the Full Faith and Credit Clause,

17

that it would say that there is some requirement --

18

QUESTION:

Well, but we wouldn't need an

19

original action for the Full Faith and Credit Clause.

20

that's so, it could apply in this case.

22
23

MR. FARR:

That's correct.

they're -QUESTION:

If

MR. FARR:

I mean, the question would be, is

2

there -- obviously, the question that's being raised.

3

am not aware of the federal substantive standard --

We haven't --

-- in boundary cases, though,

I

7

adopted, as a federal rule, something maybe different from

8

the law of either state.

9
10

MR. FARR:

That's correct.

Now, you do have --

there are certain cases, in fact, in which you can't have

11

overlapping jurisdiction, where you can't own the same

12

water, you can't own the same land, you can't escheat the

13

same property.

14

those kinds of cases.

15

So that's true.

The court has addressed

In a situation where you're simply saying

16

another state is applying its laws, I prefer that they

17

apply our laws, and I'm troubled by the discovery that

18

they have -- they have allowed in applying their own laws,

19

I'm not sure what the federal principle --

20

QUESTION:

It's not simply that --

21

MR. FARR:

-- is that entitles you to stop it.

22

QUESTION:

-- it's a prior action pending.

23

That's what makes this case different, and one of the

24

things that makes it different from Nevada v. Hall.

25

is it -- is the California proceeding ongoing?

Why

Isn't it

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

normal for a second court to stay its operations so it

2

won't interfere with that prior action?

3

MR. FARR:

It -- in fact, the Nevada court

4

dismissed the declaratory judgment action precisely

5

because it didn't want to get into the question that was

6

at issue in the California proceeding.

7

9

QUESTION:

Yes, but what about the intrusive

discovery?
MR. FARR:

Well, most of the -- most of the

11

issues involved things that have nothing to do with the

12

merits of the California inquiry.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. LEATHERWOOD:

Thank you, Your Honor.

2

In this particular case, I'd like to go back to

3

Justice Breyer's thumbscrew example.

4

Full Faith and Credit Clause would actually force Cal --

5

force Nevada to apply -- apply a California thumbscrew

6

statute, because that would actually be outside the tax

7

function.
What I'm saying in this particular case what has

8
9

I don't think the

happened is that Nevada's failure to give us back to

10

California's immunity statute has resulted in interference

11

with California's tax system.

12

intervene and give us back to our particular proposed

13

test, which would look into California to see whether or

14

not we would grant immunity, then essentially that would

15

permit any defendant any form of taxpayer to run to the

16

border and literally sue the State of California or any

17

other state to prevent the enforcement of that particular

18

statute.

If this court does not

In addition, I pointed out that this gives
