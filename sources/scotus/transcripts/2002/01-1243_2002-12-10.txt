Mr. Bishop, you may proceed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. BISHOP:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
The Army Corps of Engineers has a considerable

11

number of hurdles to clear before it may regulate activity

12

as a discharge under section 404.

13

section 404 that a permit is required for an activity that

14

is an addition of a pollutant to a navigable water.

15

addition -- that added pollutant must be in the form of

16

fill material or dredged material.

17

come from a point source.

18

Congress specified in

That

And the addition must

Those statutory terms, we believe, have a core

19

of plain meaning that excludes a farmer and rancher, deep

20

plowing in a seasonal wetland, to prepare the soil for

21

deep-rooted crops.

22

add fill material or dredged material, and it doesn't

23

involve a point source.

24
25

QUESTION:

A deep plowing of that sort does not

And so it --

Well, did -- did the district court

here find that the deep ripping tracked material into

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

3

wetland areas from the adjacent uplands?
MR. BISHOP:

Only as to 3 of the 30-odd wetlands

that are involved.

4

QUESTION:

And as to those three?

5

MR. BISHOP:

And that -- that is not -- and that

6

was not the basis of the judgment below or of the penalty.

7

In the summary judgment ruling, the court found,

8

as a matter of law, that plowing that moved material that

9

was already in the wetland -- and this is page 36 of the

10

petition appendix -- was a violation.

11

hearing evidence, for that reason the court did not focus

12

on the question of whether material was added to the

13

wetland, as the Government says, from -- from outside.

14

When it came to

The penalty in this case was based on 358 rips,

15

passes, of the plow across the wetlands.

16

not distinguish, in any of those cases, as between passes

17

that brought outside material into the wetland and those

18

that didn't.

19

The court did

It simply was not a focus.

This was not the basis of the Government's

20

argument below.

This is entirely novel.

21

basis of the district court's decision in this case.

22

wasn't the basis of the court of appeals decision, if you

23

look at page 6 of the court of appeals decision.

24

Furthermore, we believe that --

It wasn't the
It

Even so, if we agreed that that's a

proper basis -MR. BISHOP:

That would not be a basis on which

you could affirm here because that was not -QUESTION:

But we'd have to -- we'd have to

remand for that to be considered?
MR. BISHOP:

And we believe that a remand that

7

focused on that issue would show, first of all, that there

8

were on some occasions a minimal amount of material that

9

was moved into the edge of the wetland, just on some

10

occasions, a minimal amount that would be well below the

11

amount of fill that would have fitted at that time with on

12

the -- under the nationwide permit so that no individual

13

permit would be required in this case.

14

It would also show that the -- that the deep

15

plow was raised on many occasions before the -- it moved

16

from upland into wetland, and there's an example of that

17

described at page 71 of the petition appendix.

18

And finally, on page 3 of our reply brief, we

19

cite a California Ag Extension pamphlet which describes in

20

great detail the nature of the soils and the plowing in

21

this area, and what it -- what it describes is that when a

22

deep plow passes through this sort of clay soil and it

23

then rains, that the -- that the -- the clay pan seals up

24

again and that because of the -- the nature of the clay

25

pan, there really is no homogenization during the plowing

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

process between the soils above and below the pan.
QUESTION:

2
3

that?

What -- what is the relevance of

That is, I'm thinking of --

4

MR. BISHOP:

5

QUESTION:

Well, the Government is -Let me explain how I'm thinking of

6

this case.

Suppose that you went in the middle of Lake

7

Erie with a big punch, and you punched a hole in the

8

bottom and all the water ran out.

9

act?

10

MR. BISHOP:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. BISHOP:

13

No.
No.
That would regulated under the

rivers -QUESTION:

14
15

Would that violate this

There's nothing.

Okay, it wouldn't violate the act.

All right.

Now suppose you went to Lake Erie and you had

16
17

about 1,000 dump trucks or great big rakes and you filled

18

up Lake Erie.

Would that violate the act?

19

MR. BISHOP:

20

QUESTION:

That would fall under section 404.
Absolutely, okay.

So now what you

21

have is you punch a hole in the bottom and you bring some

22

dirt in.

All right?

So -- so --

23

MR. BISHOP:

24

QUESTION:

25

punched the hole.

We bring no --- you brought in some dirt and you

Now --

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

MR. BISHOP:

We bring -- we bring a little dirt

in at the margin.
QUESTION:

3

So your argument is because you only

4

brought a little dirt and you were mostly interested in

5

punching the hole, you fall outside the act.

6

MR. BISHOP:

7

QUESTION:

That's right.
That's it.

Okay.

And that -Well, I don't know

8

if we're interested in the purpose of the act and you

9

violate it even a little bit, why don't you lose?
MR. BISHOP:

10

No, no.

Well, the purpose of the

11

-- no.

12

are multiple purposes of this act, but the purpose to

13

preserve the Nation's waterways is achieved through a -- a

14

dual or perhaps a tripartite process.

15

16

Government.

picture.

20

The purpose of the act, Justice Breyer -- there

There is a section

There is a section 404 fill and dredge

But that is only part of the

The Government through -- the -- the Congress

21

through section 208 set up a process which is mainly

22

administered through the States, although with

23

considerable Federal assistance, for -- for regulating

24

nonpoint source pollution.

25

activity, is not regulated under section 404, it is,

If this activity, this plowing

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

nevertheless, regulated by the States as nonpoint source

2

pollution.
And so the goal of the act to -- to protect the

3
4

Nation's waters is not one that depends on the Federal

5

Government, and in fact, we think here that to give a

6

broad reading to the powers of the Army Corps of Engineer

7

under section 404 by straining these very -- these --

8

these terms, these series of terms that Congress

9

predicated section 404 jurisdiction on, that that would

10

contravene Congress' other goal in section 101(b) which is

11

to preserve and protect the primary responsibilities and

12

rights of the States.
QUESTION:

13

Mr. Bishop, will you explain

14

something to me?

15

what the concern was it was to preserve wetlands and not

16

have them converted into dry lands, what difference should

17

it make if the conversion comes about through redeposit,

18

shaking all the stuff up, turning it upside down, but what

19

you're ending up with is dry land rather than wetland, or

20

if you take a little sludge from someplace else and put it

21

there?

22

And -- and -- on a most basic level, if

MR. BISHOP:

We don't think it's permissible,

23

Justice Ginsburg, to protect wetlands by ignoring the

24

plain language of the statute because Congress, through

25

using the terms that it did, imposed limits on Federal

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

power that preserve and protect, as 101(b) says, the power

2

of the States to regulate nonpoint source pollution.

3

so this --

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. BISHOP:

6

QUESTION:

So when you say --- so it --- you say, well, nonpoint is --

7

that's another issue, whether this is a point source,

8

whether the -MR. BISHOP:

10

source.

We don't believe this is a point

We don't believe it involves fill material --

11

QUESTION:

MR. BISHOP:

13

QUESTION:

But that's -- that's another issue --- or dredged material.
-- than whether -- I thought you were

14

saying this is a redeposit of the same material.

15

Therefore, it can't come under the act.
MR. BISHOP:

16
17

And

material.

It's -- it's a redeposit of the

Therefore it is not an addition --

18

QUESTION:

Yes.

19

MR. BISHOP:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. BISHOP:

-- of material to the wetland.
Is there any redeposit that could be?
Well, the -- the -- Judge Silberman

22

in the National Mining case said that the terms addition

23

in section 404 and also the concept that a 404 permit is

24

for the -- is for the deposit of material to a specified

25

disposal site, that read together, those show that

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Congress intended that there be a geographic or temporal

2

separation between the dredging activity or where the

3

material comes from and where it is deposited.

4

know, if a bulldozer digs up large quantities of material

5

from one side of a wetland and moves them to another, you

6

know, perhaps it is reasonable for the agency in a

7

circumstance like that to say that there has been an

8

addition.

So, you

Even in a case like Deaton, where you have

9
10

dredging, the dredging takes soil out of the wetland.

At

11

that point it becomes a defined pollutant under section

12

404 which is dredged spoil, something that Congress said

13

was a pollutant.

14

know, certainly there is far more movement of the soil and

15

far more disturbance of the soil in a situation like that.

16

It's lifted out of the wetland and it is moved elsewhere.

And if is that is sidecast, then, you

But what we're dealing with here is a plow, a

17
18

deep plow, that goes through the soil and that pushes it

19

to the side and -- and moves it, but it stays in contact

20

with the soil all around it and it's simply moved in small

21

degrees.

QUESTION:

Is there a difference between deep

They're the same.

They're the same

And -- and chiseling, which is

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

mentioned as a form of plowing in the regulations, is the

It's just -- it's exactly the same

QUESTION:

Well, what -- what is the effect of

5

section 1344 which says nonprohibited discharge of dredged

6

or fill materials, that the discharge from normal farming

7

and activities such as plowing are not considered, I

8

guess, as --

9

MR. BISHOP:

Well, Justice O'Connor, our -- our

10

take on this case is that we never get to 404(f), that

11

this activity is not a discharge to begin with because it

12

doesn't satisfy the requirements set out in 404(a).

13

not -- it does not involve a point source.

This is not fill material.
It is not an addition.

MR. BISHOP:

QUESTION:

It is

A plow is not
It's not
Therefore, it

So, you think we never get there.
That's -- that's our argument.
But if we were to disagree with you,

20

because of this marginal shifting of soil from the uplands

21

to the wetland, then we'd have to look at that?

22

MR. BISHOP:

If -- well, that would be -- that

23

would be an issue, but as I say, there's no finding as to

24

that sort of a -- that sort of an addition.

25

believe -- Justice O'Connor, let me be clear that that --

And I don't

Alderson Reporting Company

1

the -- the movement of material into the margins of the

2

waters here would not be a discharge.

3

addition, it still has to qualify as fill material and as

4

dredged material and as a point source.

5

is none of those things, and I hope I get a chance to

6

explain why I don't think it's a point source.

7

QUESTION:

Even if it is an

And a plow simply

Why -- there's something called a

8

backhoe that has been labeled a point source and a

9

bulldozer that has been labeled.

10

MR. BISHOP:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. BISHOP:

Right.
Why not a ripper?
Well, let me explain.

The language

13

of the statute is that a point source is a confined

14

conveyance, a confined, discrete conveyance.

15

not believe -- and if you look at -- and then are examples

16

set -- set out in the statute.

17

addendum to the Government's brief, which is a little

18

easier to handle than our petition appendix.

19

source is a discernible, confined, discrete conveyance.

20

And then there are a series of examples.

21

And we do

And this is at 5a of the

A point

Now, the Government's regulations don't define

22

point source.

In fact, they don't even use point source.

23

The -- the 404 regulations don't include the term, point

24

source, and they're not in the 1996 memorandum to the

25

field in which the -- the Government purported to explain

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

why deep plowing is covered by 404.
But we think that these terms and these examples

2
3

show one important characteristic of a -- of a point

4

source, that it confines the material that it conveys.

MR. BISHOP:

Well, I -- I don't think it is,

17

Justice Scalia, if you look at the examples that are --

18

are given because the characteristic of all of these

19

things is that they confine the material --

MR. BISHOP:

22
23

Well, what is rolling stock?
It's defined in Webster's as -- as

the -- the trucks of a trucking company or -QUESTION:

Fine.

So -- and it doesn't, however

24

-- suppose I have a brilliant idea.

Instead of a truck, I

25

will take a giant rake, 17 feet across, and rake the

Alderson Reporting Company

mountain into Lake Superior.

2

that doesn't fall within this just because I thought of

3

this brain storm of using this giant rake instead of a

4

truck?

5

MR. BISHOP:

No.

All right.

Now, is -- is --

I think the -- the common

sense question is, does this vehicle confine material.

7

There are some --

QUESTION:

I would say the common sense question

is whether or not it's exactly the same for all intents

MR. BISHOP:

Well, but -- the -- there is a list

of examples -QUESTION:

Well, isn't -- isn't your point

whether it's a conveyance?

15

MR. BISHOP:

16

QUESTION:

Well, that is another point.
The rake is a conveyance.

It is

17

meant to move the dirt down, and I suppose your point is

18

that the -- the plow is not intended to convey the dirt

19

anywhere except up and down.

20

go sideways, but that's not what the plow is for.

Some of it may accidentally

21

MR. BISHOP:

Well, I think that that is a very

22

useful term for us, conveyance.

23

gives the idea of something that is intended to move

24

material from one place to another.

25

plow is intended --

Conveyance certainly

And a plow is not.

QUESTION:

That's not your purpose.

10

That's not your purpose.

But that is

necessarily what you are doing by the activity that you
engage in, isn't it?
MR. BISHOP:

11

Justice -- Justice Souter, I don't

12

think that in any normal use of the term conveyance that

13

you would include a rake or a plow that just pushes

14

material a short distance, perhaps a matter of inches or

15

feet.

16

QUESTION:

Well, let's -- let's assume that I --

17

I'm accepting Justice Breyer's suggestion and the rake

18

would be a -- would -- would be a point source here

19

because it conveyed.

20

in effect, a -- a -- an excluding analysis for the -- for

21

the ripper that moves the stuff up and down?

22

If that is so, why should there be,

MR. BISHOP:

Well, I mean, that's my argument,

23

Justice Souter.

I believe that the terms confined and

24

conveyance in the statute in their plain meaning and as

25

they are elucidated through all of these examples that are

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

given, that they all have characteristics in common.

is that they confine the material.

convey it.

Well, you -- you could say that it

does convey.

It -- it conveys mostly, almost entirely, up

(Laughter.)

16

MR. BISHOP:

Well, and we don't -- we don't

17

think that the -- the plowing here satisfies any of these

18

terms.

even if it is a point source, we certainly don't think

QUESTION:

2

-- it's not adding material.

3

but as I take the Government's argument, it's converting

4

something that wasn't a pollutant into a pollutant when

5

this deep ripper churns up the earth and deposits the

6

rocks and the soil and the biological material on the top.

7

-- the argument that -- that it's a

MR. BISHOP:

No new material is added,

Justice Ginsburg, the -- the

8

statute, section 404, applies to two types of pollutant

9

only, and that's fill material and dredged material.

10

Dredged material is material that is dredged out of the

11

soil, the sort of thing that a backhoe does, dredging a

12

hole and lifting it up out of the soil.

13

regulations define dredged material as material that is

14

excavated or dredged from the wetland.

15

The agency's

The district court didn't find that there was

16

any dredged material involved here, and we don't believe

17

that any reasonable reading of the term, dredged material,

18

or of the regulation that talks about excavating and

19

dredging from the wetland could describe the activity of

20

deep plowing.

21

That leaves fill material.

Fill material in its

22

plain meaning is material that is -- is used, is moved in

23

to fill a gap or a cavity.

24

regulations at the time as material that was used for the

25

primary purpose of replacing an aquatic area with dry land

It was defined in the

or changing the bottom elevation.

As Justice Breyer has

2

pointed out, if anything took water out of this wetland,

3

it is the activity of punching the hole in the clay pan so

4

that it drains out.

5

wetland and there was no purpose here to -- to use the

6

material to replace wet areas.

We are not interested in filling this

7

And in fact, it's quite irrelevant to a farmer

8

and rancher if the topsoil remains wet, and in this area

9

it does, as a matter of fact, remain wet because the clay

10

pan seals up and during the rainy season, there's --

11

there's water on the surface.

12

to do that.
QUESTION:

13

It's just not our purpose

You -- you were quoting the -- the

14

regulations as to the -- the definition of -- of dredged

15

material, but the definition in the statute of pollutant

16

includes rock and sand.
MR. BISHOP:

17

It does, but the -- but the

18

pollutants -- the pollutants have to be in a particular

19

form in order to be covered by 404, and that form is fill

20

material or dredged material.

21

that there is rock or sand involved here.

22

the form of fill material or dredged material which is why

23

you have these regulatory definitions of those two

concepts.

of the Government's addendum.

QUESTION:

So the definition -- for present

purposes the definition of pollutant is irrelevant.
MR. BISHOP:

It is -- I'm not sure whether it's

12

permit, then what you're charged with violating is section

13

301(a), which is on page 1a.

15

And that talks about the

But the basis on which this case has been

litigated is that we needed a 404(a) permit not a 402

try and proceed logically from the question of whether

the question of whether that discharge would be covered by

On the question of whether there was a discharge

QUESTION:

25

MR. MINEAR:

To be sure -How so?
The activities that are covered

1

under the normal farming exemption are ongoing

2

agricultural activities, part of a regular farming

3

activity, and also activities that ultimately under the

4

recapture provision, first, do not change the use of the

5

land and do not result in converting a wetland to dry

6

land.
Now, the agency was charged with responsibility

7
8

for -- for fleshing out the scope of the normal farming

9

exemption, and it made clear that a farmer who continues

10

to engage in practices that he's always engaged in,

11

including normal -- normal plowing -QUESTION:

12
13

And you say here there was a change

in the use.

14

MR. MINEAR:

15

QUESTION:

Yes.

This land --

Well, your opponent doesn't want us

16

to reach that exception because he says he wants to rest

17

on the fact that, A, it wasn't a point source, that the

18

plow is not a point source, and B, there was no addition.

19

There was simply a redeposit of material in the same

20

place.

21

Have you dealt with that yet?
MR. MINEAR:

Yes.

I would like to go back to

22

that point.

23

about the question of addition which is fundamental to the

24

idea of a discharge.

25

We're now back to question 1 and talking

Our view is that there were additions from three

34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

sources here.
First, there was addition by material being

2
3

moved from the upland into the wetland.

Counsel states

4

that that occurred in only three cases.

The record

5

actually shows that it occurred in at least 33 of the 40

6

wetlands that are involved here.

7

reference to it only in those three cases where it was the

8

only movement of that material.

9

the three cases that are cited in the district court's

The district court made

But it's easy to see that

10

opinion refer to those cases where the ripper passed next

11

to a wetland but didn't go in and pushed -- nevertheless,

12

pushed soil into the wetland.

13

in those areas where the ripper actually intruded through

14

the wetland as well.

15

areas, the 29 areas that were filled, all of them had

16

movement of material from upland into the wetlands.

So in the case of all of the -- the

QUESTION:

17

The same thing would happen

Well, excuse me.

I thought your

18

opponent said it isn't an addition because it's a

19

redeposit of material.
MR. MINEAR:

20

Have you dealt with that?
Yes.

The -- in talking about --

21

before when I spoke about the dredged material, about how

22

material is moved from one place to the wetland to another

23

place, that is a regulable redeposit that is covered by

24

the act.

25

Deaton is quite persuasive on this.

And we believe the Fourth Circuit's reasoning in

Alderson Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

I think that's already a stretch.

I

2

mean, you know, with that you'll say, well, literally

3

you're not adding anything to the wetlands just to move

4

the -- the mud from one portion to another.

5

this big dredging operation and it does disturb everything

6

and you move it.

But you have

So, yes, I'll go along with you on that.

But -- but then, you know, that's not enough for

7
8

you.

Now we have to generalize from that and say that any

9

movement of anything within the wetlands is also an

10

addition to the wetlands.

11

this case.

12

anything has been added to the wetlands here.

And I think it is fanciful to think that

MR. MINEAR:

13

And -- and that brings you to

As I said before, Your Honor, not

14

only do we have redeposits.

15

that moved from the upland into the wetland.

MR. MINEAR:

We also have the material

Fine.
And we also have material, if I may

finish -QUESTION:

19

I see that, but -- but not all of the

20

penalties -- we're going to get to the penalty part.

21

Right?

22

MR. MINEAR:

23

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
They were $25,000 for each pass, and

24

it hasn't been established that every one of these passes

25

had that effect.

And -- and he says most of them didn't.

1

MR. MINEAR:

Before we get to the penalty part,

2

if I could, Your Honor, I'd like to point to one area --

3

other area in which material is moved into the wetland,

4

and that is material that's beneath the clay pan that was

5

segregated and separated by this impermeable clay pan and

6

instead was pulled up and put into the wetland as well.
QUESTION:

7

Okay.

Would you be explicit about

8

what is implicit in that is, and that is, the definition

9

of wetland, I take it, is the -- the land area between the

10

surface and the hard pan, and the area beneath that is not

11

part of wetland so that if you take material from beneath

12

and bring it up, you are moving into the wetland.

13

your definition and what you're saying?

14

MR. MINEAR:

15

QUESTION:

16

Yes, that's correct.
So I can mine under a wetland, and --

and I'm not disturbing the wetland.
MR. MINEAR:

MR. MINEAR:

We think in this case it's fair to

QUESTION:

In other cases it

But we need to deal with the

I thought so.
Yes, Your Honor -But I -- I think -- I thought you

22

were saying it does not go below the clay level because I

23

thought you were making the argument that when you bring

24

material from below the clay level into the wet area, you

25

are moving it into the wetland from outside the wetland.

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

So I thought you were making the further proposition that

2

the wetland stops at the -- at the clay.
MR. MINEAR:

3

In this case that's correct.

But

4

in other cases such as in Riverside Bayview, the case that

5

this Court previously addressed wetlands, there the

wetland was actually -- was -- received water from

MR. MINEAR:

Yes.

I think it's clear from the

QUESTION:

What -- what about the question I

Alderson Reporting Company

did too.

is, what -- what -- suppose we agree with you that, well,

at least the material from the side, at least the material

5

from the bottom was an addition to the wetland, brought

6

about by, let's say, this conveyance.

7

And I think Justice Scalia

At least I'm waiting with bated breath.

All right.

Now, what do we have to do with this case?

8

we then have to send it back for a reassessment of

9

penalties or what?

10

That

MR. MINEAR:

No.

Do

I think you can affirm on that

basis because those two sources were present with regard

All of the passes?
All of the -- all of the wetlands

that were at issue in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, he -- he -- I think your

17

opponent said that the penalties rested upon 17 passes or

something, and I guess they conceded that each one was a

separate violation, which they may regret, if this is the

rationale anyway.

22

Do we have to have a reassessment of

this case, the parties had agreed below that each pass of

That's their argument

And what do you say as to that?
I would say, first, the district

On

Now, as to that bit, if I have to answer the

2

question, what's your response to that argument?
MR. MINEAR:

3

My response is that deposit, that

4

turning over material that's in place, can still cause

5

environmental harm that subjects them to a penalty.

Imagine if in that muck, in that material, there are

entrained heavy metals, arsenic, the types of materials

that are filtered out through the normal wetland process.

they're still -- and they're still in the wetland.
MR. MINEAR:

But as the Fourth Circuit explained

in Deaton, that when you take material and you physically

18

change its situation, if you change it from an aerobic --

19

an anaerobic environment to an aerobic environment, if you

20

change its reduction oxidation potential, these are the

21

reasons why we have a permit because we're concerned about

22

these types of activities --

It's well to be

It seems unlikely that Congress

material that excluded the most common form of dredging,

20

which is to take material from one area of the water body

21

and move it elsewhere.

be.

My question is, if we decide the case the way you

want, are we, in fact, making their worry justified?
MR. MINEAR:

5

I do not think so, Your Honor.

And

again, I think it's important to remember that what the

agency is fully concerned with are those types of serious

violations that cause real environmental harm.

results in a diminishment of the waters of the United

That recapture provision applies

QUESTION:

Mr. Minear, are you saying that an --

18

an ordinary plow too, like this deep ripper, would be a

would come under the normal farming exemption?

The -- the

were not subject to a permit provided they simply avoided

13

these small wetland areas, what's -- in the case of the

14

parcels at issue here are about 1 percent of the property.

15

It was easy enough to simply mark these areas and have the

petitioners in this case decided not to do that.

not an exception for -- for normal -- it's an exception

11

from the discharge of dredged or fill material.

12

MR. MINEAR:

That's correct.

Right?

And so what this

13

does is it exempts the party from having to get a section

14

404 permit for activities that would otherwise constitute

15

dredge or fill activities.

16

chosen to exempt activities, including specifically

plowing, indicates that Congress understood that plowing

could result in a point source addition of pollutants.

And it -- and even that recapture

As the district court found, these waters were

longer.
I would simply like to touch on -- since we --

12
13

we have bounced around among the three issues here quite a

14

bit, I'd like to simply say a few more words about the

15

civil penalty provision because I think it's important.
The legal issue that's before the Court on the

16
17

civil penalty is -- is whether a penalty ought to be

18

assessed in terms of determining the maximum penalty on a

19

per-day basis or on the basis of the number of violations

20

per day.

21

it wanted the latter to be the basis for determining the

22

maximum civil penalty.

23

eliminate any ambiguity that might exist with regard to

24

the -- to that provision, and it's quite clear that it

25

does apply to every violation each day.

And the Congress made -- made quite clear that

It amended the statute in 1987 to

1

Now, it takes into account that some violations

2

can be continuing and go on for a long period of time.

3

And those are treated as receiving a $25,000 a day

4

penalty.

5

they all occurred in one day on the basis the district

6

court analyzed the -- the problem.

But in the case of the violations we have here,

Finally, I'd like to make the point that the

7
8

district court needs to have a great deal of discretion in

9

determining how to apply the penalty provisions that are

10

involved here.

There are different ways to calculate

11

violations, determine what is the appropriate measure of

12

violations, but ultimately the fairness turns on the

13

district court's judgment of the individual penalty

14

factors that are considered here.

15

In this case, the court took into account all

16

those factors, including the economic benefits that the

17

party received by avoiding its legal obligations in this

18

case.

19

developers, ranchers, and farmers out there that do comply

20

with the statute, that do comply with the regulations, and

21

they are, in effect, penalized if in fact people who

22

ignore the law are allowed to go forward and not be

23

subject to a substantial penalty in cases in which they

24

have violated the law.

25

It's important to remember there are land

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

Thank you, Mr. Minear.

MR. BISHOP:

15

I think it's a shame that the

16

Government has chosen to insert at this level for the very

17

first time this idea that soil came in from outside the

18

wetland.

19

district court, in describing what the plowing here did,

20

said that it broke up, mixed, turned over material already

21

in the pools, swales, and intermittent streams.

22

On page 36 of the petition appendix, the -- the

If you turn to page 86 through 91, where the

23

court describes in detail factual findings after hearing

24

the evidence on the impacts on waters, on only three -- as

25

to three of the jurisdictional features does the court say

52
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that there is any fill coming in from outside, and that is

2

where there is upland plowing parallel to a drainage that

3

pushes a small amount of material into the very margins of

4

the wetland.

5

And the reason that the court didn't need to get

6

into this is, A, that it had made a legal finding to begin

7

with that soil disturbed within a wetland was a discharge,

8

and B, that there was a factual dispute here about the

9

extent to which we have pulled up the plows before we

10

entered across from the upland to the -- to the wetland.

11

And the court didn't want to deal with -- with that.

12

it didn't have to under this notion that if you disturb

13

soil within a wetland, that's an addition.

And

Second, I'd like to point out on page 8a of the

14
15

-- of the Government's addendum the regulation about

16

plowing.

17

including moldboard, chisel, and wide-blade plowing,

18

discing, harrowing, and similar means utilized on the farm

19

to break up, cut, turn over, or stir the soil to prepare

20

it for the planting of crops.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. BISHOP:

Plowing means all forms of primary tillage

What does primary mean?
Primary I think means just

23

preparation.

If you -- you have to go to the end and --

24

and see -- it's soil -- to prepare the soil for the

25

planting of crops.

Primary is the initial preparation of

Why do you need the exception for it?

That's what puzzles me.
MR. BISHOP:

10

Well, you don't need an exception

11

for it.

Our -- our position is that it's not a discharge

12

and so -- and that Congress, if you read the 1972

13

legislative history -- I'm sorry to mention it, Justice

Scalia.
