versus John Doe.

Mr. Roberts.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Alaska's Megan's Law makes available to members

12

of the public who seek it certain truthful information

13

about convicted sex offenders.

14

information available to help protect against the risk

15

that the convicted sex offender will offend again.

16

says that in the law.

17

opportunity, and the purpose of making the information

18

available is to allow the members of the public to take

19

steps to reduce those opportunities.

20

QUESTION:

The State makes this

It

Sex offenses are crimes of

One -- one line that I -- I think

21

there is respondents seek to establish in this case is

22

that this information has to be generated by acts that

23

occur after the conviction.

24

some -- four times a year, et cetera.

25

You have to fill out the form

I -- I've read in the brief -- I'm sure my

3

1

colleagues have too the -- the problem about going to the

2

police station.

3

to go to the police station four times a year.

4

change the case?

5

Just assume hypothetically that you had

MR. ROBERTS:

Would that

No, it wouldn't, Your Honor.

6

That's the case in -- in about 14 States that -- that a

7

quarterly verification has to be in person.

8

case in Alaska.

9

four times a year, which is reserved only for the most

10

serious sex offenses, the aggravated offenses -- in all

11

other cases it's just annually -- doesn't rise to the

12

level of a burden that is at all tantamount to what we

13

think of as punishment under the Ex Post Facto Clause.

14

It is not the

And simply going to the police station

QUESTION:

I have forms I have to fill out four
I'm always afraid I'm

15

times a year for the Government.

16

going to miss the deadline.

17

a -- a policeman, which is itself I think demeaning, I --

18

I just don't know any analogue for -- is there any

19

analogue for that in -- in regulation of --

20

MR. ROBERTS:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

If I had to present myself to

In-person registration?

-- the regulation of regulated

industries or things like that?
MR. ROBERTS:

I'm not sure of one where you

24

actually have to show up in person, but the question is

25

whether that in-person requirement is rationally related

4

1

to a legitimate regulatory purpose.

2

under cases like Flemming.

QUESTION:

4

Well, Mr. Roberts, do they in Alaska

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

7

MR. ROBERTS:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. ROBERTS:

10

The instructions make that clear.

11

QUESTION:

That's the standard

They do not.

It clearly --

Even for aggravated offenses?
Even for aggravated offenses.

And it can be filed by mail or how?
Expressly can be filed by mail.

Could -- could the administrative

12

authorities interpret the statute so that you would have

13

to go to the station without amending the statute?

14

MR. ROBERTS:

I don't think so, because the

15

statute says the initial registration has to be in person.

16

Typically it's in -- in prison.

17

later verification has to be in writing.

18

would be an unreasonable reading of the statute to say

19

that the later verification had to be in writing.

20

QUESTION:

And then it says the
So I think it

Do we have an issue here because this

21

law was passed after a number of the people affected by it

22

had already been convicted, and so there are allegations

23

of retroactivity concerns?

24
25

MR. ROBERTS:

The question is whether the

burdens that the law imposes constitute punishment.

5

If

1

it's not punishment, then it's perfectly valid to apply it

2

to people who were convicted prior to the effective date.

3

And this is not -QUESTION:

4
5

Mr. Roberts, the only challenge in

this case is to the retroactivity.

6

MR. ROBERTS:

7

is before the Court in this case.
QUESTION:

8
9
10

Is that correct?

Only the ex post facto challenge

And that's because these people were

tried, convicted, served their time before the passage of
the act.

11

MR. ROBERTS:

12

QUESTION:

That's correct, and --

And their principal complaint, as I

13

understand it, is that this is punishment because we can't

14

get out.

15

expert testimony that we are cured.

16

out from under this demeaning regime, that much more than

17

the burden of going to a police station, that that's what

18

it's about, that we're locked into this for life and it

19

has a devastating effect on our lives.

There's no escape from it.

MR. ROBERTS:

20

We can prove with
Nothing will get us

Well, for life, again only for

21

aggravated; for 15 years for other sex offenses.

22

that is one of their arguments, that they can't get out of

23

it.

24
25

And yes,

But this Court's cases haven't drawn that line.
The question is whether the burdens are pursuant to a

6

1

legitimate regulatory objective, or whether they're

2

punitive.

3

Hendricks, couldn't get out of that, and yet that didn't

4

make it a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.

5

against Nestor.

6

and yet it did not rise to the level of punishment.

For example, in cases like Kansas against

You couldn't avoid the sanction there,

QUESTION:

7

Flemming

But there was a -- there was a

8

determination, at least in Hendricks, that you fit --

9

currently fit into a certain category.
MR. ROBERTS:

10

A -- a particular subclass, yes.

11

It was an individualized determination required because

12

the depravation there, actual confinement, was far more

13

severe than the depravation at issue here.

14

individual determination, nor a chance to get out of it is

15

required to avoid the categorization as punishment.

16

like Hawker and De Veau make clear that a -- a reasonable

17

legislature can treat a category -- a category of sex

18

offenders.

20

anything.

Cases

They don't --

QUESTION:

19

But neither an

But in Hawker, you didn't have to do

Here --

21

MR. ROBERTS:

22

QUESTION:

Hawker was --

-- I don't like to use the word

23

"affirmative action," because that has a connotation in

24

some other -- but you have to take an -- affirmative steps

25

for the rest of your life in -- in some cases.

7

And

1

this -- and this seems to me very, very burdensome and to

2

differentiate this class.
MR. ROBERTS:

3

Not true, of course, in Hendricks

4

or Flemming or Salerno, no opportunity to avoid it there.

5

You didn't have to do anything to get the sanction applied

6

to you.

7

Now -QUESTION:

No, no, no.

I was -- I was saying

8

but the requirement of the statute is that for the rest of

9

your life you have to take affirmative steps to -- to

10

re-register --

11

MR. ROBERTS:

12

QUESTION:

You have to register.

-- and to list all your automobiles

13

and -- and to show that you've --

14

MR. ROBERTS:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. ROBERTS:

You -- you have to fill out --

-- shaved your beard or something.
-- one -- one side of one page.

17

That's the form that's involved here.

18

cannot be punishment.

19

do that all the time in -- in today's society.

20

be something else that makes this punishment.

21

That in itself

We -- as Your Honor mentioned -- we
So it must

Now, what the Ninth Circuit's -- Ninth Circuit

22

thought was that it was publishing it on the Internet,

23

that that made it punishment.

24

most -- most efficient and most economical way of making

25

information available.

But that's simply the

8

1

It also is passive.

It's not displayed to

2

people who have no interest in the information, and in

3

that sense is far less invasive.

4

The publication on the Internet will -- yes, it

5

may cause adverse consequences when members of the

6

community learn this public fact about someone's past.

7

But the State is certainly free to weigh the convicted sex

8

offender's interest in keeping that public fact from being

9

widely known against the interest of those in the position

10
11

of, say, Megan Kanka's parents.
QUESTION:

Well, "waive" -- "waive" isn't quite

12

the word, Mr. Roberts.

13

person does --

14

MR. ROBERTS:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. ROBERTS:

I mean, "waive" is something a

"Weigh."

I'm sorry.

"Weigh."

Oh, I thought you said "waive."
I'm sorry.

Weigh the convicted

17

sex offender's interest in keeping a public fact about his

18

past secret against Megan Kanka's parents' interest in

19

knowing that their new neighbor across the street had

20

twice been convicted of sexually abusing young girls.

21

That's a determination for the legislature to make.

22

There are costs --

23

QUESTION:

24
25

But you could get that from the

record of conviction.
MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, and all the State is doing --

9

1

QUESTION:

But under the statute we have here,

2

you have affirmative steps that have to be taken for the

3

rest of the person's life if he's a violent offender, to

4

report four times a year.

5

for that.
MR. ROBERTS:

6

I just don't know any analogue

Well, there are countless

7

analogues in the regulatory regime where people have to

8

file quarterly reports.

9

whether that requirement serves a valid regulatory

If -- and -- and the question is

purpose.

It can't rise to the level of punishment just

11

because the legislature has determined that the triggering

12

event -QUESTION:

13

Well, but I suppose that's because

14

you choose to be in a regulated industry, or you choose to

15

have this withholding regime.

16

imposed on a class of citizens by reason of their criminal

17

past.

18

MR. ROBERTS:

And it's -- it's not

There are -- there are many

19

disabilities that are imposed as a result of a prior

20

conviction that the Court has found don't constitute

21

punishment.

22

QUESTION:

None which require affirmative steps.

23

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, the affirmative steps --

24

it -- that has never been the test.

25

whether it rises to the level of punishment.

10

The test has been
Yes, the

1

affirmative step of filling out one side of one page with

the sort of information that you'd -- would put on your

3

application to join the Price Club requires.

4

nothing burdensome about that.

5

argument the use that that information is put to.
QUESTION:

6
7

There's

It must be in their

What is our test for whether it rises

to the level of punishment?

8

MR. ROBERTS:

9

QUESTION:

Well, when the --

Didn't the Ninth Circuit found --

10

find there was no intent to make it punitive, but looked

11

to the effects?

12

MR. ROBERTS:

13

QUESTION:

14

That's right.

Is it an effects test and how do we

apply it -MR. ROBERTS:

15

Well, it's called the intent

16

effects test.

17

that is so critical, and nearly controlling because the

18

same sanction can be punitive or civil depending on the

19

purpose.

20

protective.

21

You'd first see what the intent is, and

Even confinement can be civil if the purpose is
So that's why purpose is so controlling.

Now, once you determined that there's a

22

regulatory purpose, as every court has -- not just every

23

Federal court -- every court to look at these laws has

24

determined they have a valid civil regulatory purpose --

25

then the one challenging that determination carries the

11

1

heavy burden of establishing, by the clearest proof, with

2

unmistakable evidence, that the effect is so punitive that

3

the purported purpose must, in fact, be a charade.
QUESTION:

4

And --

But why isn't the evidence that this

5

is -- is a face plastered on the Internet, that in modern

6

times that is the equivalent of the town square where

7

you're shaming the bad actor?

8

person's face, and you have only the bad information.

9

don't get the information that this person has

10

successfully completed a rehabilitation course.

11

get the information that this was on the scale of sexual

12

offenses on the lighter side.

13

that?

14

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

And here, you have a

That information is

QUESTION:

So --

Is it -- that's on the page -- the

page with the photograph says what the crime was?
MR. ROBERTS:

That's my understanding, Your

20

Honor, yes, that -- that -- I'm not sure what it is in

21

every State, but the -- the circumstances of conviction

22

is -- it's one of the things that has to be registered,

and is available to the public.

25

So if it -- you can find

Now, I don't -- I'm sorry.

QUESTION:

In addition, on that page, what the

2

viewer will see -- you don't see on the page with the face

3

any disclaimer, any statement that the State is not

4

branding this person as dangerous.

5

making a statement that there was a conviction in the

6

past.
MR. ROBERTS:

7

The State is simply

It conveys simply the truthful,

8

objective information that this individual was convicted

9

of this crime, and the public is free to take appropriate

10

action if they think that's -- that's appropriate under

11

the circumstances.

12

shaming penalties because of the purpose.

And again,

13

purpose is the nearly controlling factor.

The purpose of

14

the shaming penalties was not to inform.

Everybody in the

15

colonial village knew the circumstances of the offense.

16

The purpose was to shame.
QUESTION:

17

It is different from the historic

Here, the purpose is to inform.

Mr. Roberts, on that point you said

18

this is truthful information, and it is.

My question is,

19

isn't -- it's not the whole truth because the successful

20

rehabilitation in one case is not known.

21

in the other case that a judge determined this -- this

22

person had been cured to the extent that he could have the

23

custody of a -- a minor child.

24

known.

25

not the good.

It's not known

That information is not

So the -- the public is getting only the bad, and
Its judgment is being skewed.

13

And that's

1

why it has a punitive flavor.
MR. ROBERTS:

2

Well, it conveys the information

3

that the legislature thought was pertinent for people to

4

take action to protect themselves if they think it's

5

warranted.

6

they want to -- if they think that's pertinent --

Nothing prevents them from finding out more if

QUESTION:

7

But nothing would prevent anybody

8

from going to the court, or the police station and getting

9

a record of a particular person.

It's made easy for them

10

by the State -- access is made easy -- but only access to

11

the bad information.
MR. ROBERTS:

12

Well, access to the information

13

that the legislature thought was pertinent and that people

14

wanted to learn.

There is no requirement --

QUESTION:

15

Mr. Roberts, would it be possible for

16

a defendant to include additional information on the form,

17

and if so, would it appear on the Internet?
MR. ROBERTS:

18

There's no provision for that

19

under Alaska's laws.

20

where they have a more active notification, where the

21

offenders have taken steps to say, well, here's my side of

22

the story, but there's no provision for that on the

23

Internet.

24
25

QUESTION:

I am aware of situations where --

Suppose they had the same statute,

but instead of it -- applying it to people who were

14

1

convicted, they applied it to people who had been

2

arrested, or alternatively, they applied it to people whom

3

a policeman said he had gotten suspicious information

4

about that he believed was accurate, no arrest -- now,

5

suppose it's exactly the same, but they just do -- they

6

apply it not in that way.

7

if any, would that violate?

MR. ROBERTS:

Process Clause if there's not a rational connection

MR. ROBERTS:

I've got that.

Here the legislature had a solid

basis, a basis that this --

QUESTION:

Yes.

3

MR. ROBERTS:

-- Court has recognized, as

4

recently as last June in the McKune case, for the

5

conclusion that those convicted have a high rate of

6

recidivism.
QUESTION:

7

Well, are you assuming from Justice

8

Breyer's hypothesis, Mr. Roberts, that the policeman who

9

has spotted some suspicious -- that these people have

10

previously been convicted, or that this is just the -- the

11

beginning of the whole story is that a policeman spots

12

someone?

13

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I understood the question to

14

be it's just the beginning of the whole story, and in that

15

case, I'd question whether --

16

QUESTION:

17

Well, there's certainly no ex post

MR. ROBERTS:

19

QUESTION:

No, there wouldn't be --

No, what I was driving at is suppose

20

that this statute too is -- I -- suppose I were to believe

21

it was excessive in light of its purpose in respect to

22

some -- some people, but not to others.

23

Constitution would it violate, if any?

24
25

MR. ROBERTS:

What part of the

Certainly not the Ex Post Facto

Clause because in Seling against Young, the Court said you

16

1

look at the law on its face, not as applied.

2

started looking at laws as applied to determine whether

3

they're punishment, and in Hudson and in Seling, the Court

4

said we're not going to do that.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

10

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

11

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

12
13
14

MR. OLSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Congress and the legislatures of 50 States have

15

agreed that citizens should have access to truthful

16

information concerning the identity and location of

17

convicted sex offenders.

18

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose that the public in

19

theory has access to it anyway because convictions are a

20

matter of public record, and presumably any citizen who

21

wanted to dig deep enough could find out who had been

22

convicted of what.

23

What this scheme involves is getting a big

24

megaphone, in effect, making it more readily available.

25

Is that what we're talking about here?

17

1

MR. OLSON:

I don't agree with the

2

characterization of this as a megaphone.

3

would characterize it instead of saying it is the least

4

intrusive, most passive way to provide information that is

5

already available to citizens, and can be obtained by

6

citizens, but to make it more accessible to them because

7

the people have decided that they want this information.
QUESTION:

8
9

What I -- what I

But it isn't passive because you have

a lifetime obligation to update it.

10

MR. OLSON:

It is not passive.

to register to get a driver's license.

This does.

Well, the -- that is a separate

23

question.

I'm -- what I'm saying is that the burden of

24

registration or of keeping information current is a

25

minimally intrusive burden.

Now with respect to the question of shame, that

arises, to the extent that it exists at all, from the

that process is due -- and we'll get to that I know in the

QUESTION:

There is due

Well, but precisely, but that -- that

8

shows that there's an added burden here that was added by

many regulatory measures.

That's why you just don't rest

MR. OLSON:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARRYL L. THOMPSON

18

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

19
20
21

MR. THOMPSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We believe that the Alaska Sex Offender

22

Registration Act imposes punishment because it possesses

23

three features which are classically considered to be

24

punishment, and not like any other civil or regulatory

25

measure this Court has seen before.

25

1

First of all, the sanction attaches

2

automatically and inescapably solely on a basis of a prior

3

conviction, without any determination of present

4

dangerousness at all.
Secondly, the sanction is a pervasive regulation

5
6

of the person themselves.

7

regulate an activity or a profession here.

8

regulation of the person himself.

QUESTION:

MR. THOMPSON:

Just like they do on probation.

In Alaska, not in person, I take it.
Well, we respectfully disagree

19

with Mr. Roberts' characterization of the statute.

20

statute gives unfettered discretion to the Department of

21

Public Safety -- the police -- to administer it in a way

22

that it deems appropriate.

QUESTION:

When the -- they have to replace the

photographs periodically.
MR. THOMPSON:

They do, and -- and they're

15

required to -- on their quarterly report to report any

16

changes in their physical characteristics, they gain

17

weight, they grow gray hair, they get lasik surgery, don't

18

have glasses, grow a beard, get fat.

19

they've got to report that information.

And you know

20

that's going to be a triggering event.

I mean, if they

21

look different, the police are going to have them come

22

back in and get a new photograph --

23

QUESTION:

Whatever it is,

Well, but I mean, how is that

24

different?

Everybody -- you're sort of turning this on

25

whether you have to walk to the police station or not.

27

1

I mean, a lot of people have to go in and report different

2

things, send in forms, give their pictures, even give

3

their fingerprints.
I would think that the problem is what happens

4
5

to that information later, that everybody in the

6

neighborhood knows it, that they're likely to shun the

7

people, that -- that it may be too broad.

8

that -- is it really the police -- having to walk

9

somewhere and write something as opposed to sending in a

10

I mean, is

report that makes all the difference?
MR. THOMPSON:

11

No.

I mean, what I -- what I --

12

the third characteristic is -- is the stigmatizing

13

characteristic, which I want to -- want to talk about

14

here.

15

But it's not just -QUESTION:

Well, what about someone who is truly

16

a dangerous sex offender, who poses a real risk to

17

children in that area?

18

this a -- a scheme that is applied to such a person that

19

poses constitutional problems, do you think, or does

20

public safety rise to the level where it can be responded

21

to in this fashion?

22

MR. THOMPSON:

Now, what about that?

Are -- is

Well, unlike the -- the Kansas

23

situation, Kansas v. Hendricks, there's no effort to weed

24

out those who are dangerous from those who are not.

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

That's not the question I asked

28

1

you.

2

MR. THOMPSON:

3

QUESTION:

I apologize.

I asked you whether, as applied to

4

someone who is exceedingly dangerous, in your view does

5

the scheme survive?

6

MR. THOMPSON:

Well, no.

It's still an evasive

7

regulation of the individual just like probation and it's

8

still a stigmatizing system that labels them as dangerous.

9

QUESTION:

Maybe he deserves stigmatization

10

if -- with the high recidivist rate under the facts that

11

Justice O'Connor gave you.

12

MR. THOMPSON:

The person is still dangerous.

But not all of them are.

13

that's the problem with this statute.

14

people that are demonstrably not dangerous.

And

It applies to those

15

QUESTION:

If that's the problem --

16

QUESTION:

But your --

17

QUESTION:

-- how -- how -- this is -- what is

18

your response to Justice -- to the argument that was made

19

on the other side?

20

you're raising an ex post facto claim.

21

to be nitpicking about this, but an ex post facto claim is

22

a question of whether this is punishment, and they're

23

saying it's not seen as punishment.

24

intent to punish.

25

the thing won't happen again.

It said simply this, that you're -Now, we don't want

It wasn't their

It was their intent to inform so that

intent.
And therefore, your claims about how bad this is

2
3

may be right.

And suppose I accept them.

Suppose I think

4

they're right.

5

somebody raises a substantive due process claim?

6

you can decide if the problem with the statute is overly

7

broad, if the problem is that some people should have it

8

applied to them and others shouldn't.

9

you mentioned would come into play.

Should I not, nonetheless, wait until

All the things that

10

punitive intent is concerned, that's not the

12
13

That way

Well, we -- I'm sorry.

We

disagree --

14

QUESTION:

I mean, that's the argument.

15

MR. THOMPSON:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

And I'd like to -- but tell me what

17

about the relation of the substantive Due Process

18

Clause -- about why isn't that the better vehicle to make

19

your argument?

20

discuss.

21

Now, that's what I'd just like to hear you

MR. THOMPSON:

I mean, it certainly is a

22

vehicle, you know, to talk about whether or not it's

23

narrowly tailored to -- to a specific regulatory goal.

24

I think that is a proper challenge, and it was challenged

25

at the lower court level.

30

1

But we're here today on an ex post facto

2

question before the Court, and the question is, is it

3

punishment, or is it not?

4

disagree that this is intended to be purely a regulatory

5

measure.

6

reliance is on the language found in the preamble of the

7

statute, that it's designed to protect the public.

8

one of the penal goals under the constitution in the State

9

of Alaska for criminal justice system.

10

And we -- we respectfully

And we disagree because the State's sole

QUESTION:

That's

Of course, that's true, but in my

11

mind rings a case, in which I was in dissent, but the

12

majority has the law, and that's Hendricks.

13

all, it's not punishment to put a person in a cell -- and

14

I thought it was, but the majority thought it wasn't --

15

why is it punishment, following the law, to simply require

16

the person to make reports four times a year?

17
18
19

MR. THOMPSON:

If, after

Well, it is -- it is -- probation

requires the exact same thing, and that's our point.
QUESTION:

And it -- it required less than

20

putting the person in what was, in effect, a jail cell.

21

I'm -- I'm looking at the precedent on ex post facto.

22

MR. THOMPSON:

Certainly.

And -- and -- and you

23

know, Hendricks and Salerno present the types of cases

24

that are steeped in the pedigree of this Court looking to

25

the need to protect the public from those people that are

31

1

actively dangerous now, and that's why it was important in

2

Hendricks that there was, in fact, those protections

3

afforded to the individual.

4

automatically that Hendricks was going to be put in jail.

5

There had to have been a jury trial, or trial by a judge

6

with a preponderance beyond a reasonable doubt, and he's

7

allowed an annual review.

8

The secretary, at his own discretion, can remove that

9

restriction.

I mean, it doesn't happen

He can petition at any time.

So the duration of that is solely limited

10

and -- and looks to the purpose to protect the people from

11

those -- the public from those people that are dangerous.

12

None of those protections are here.

In fact,

13

this is a wide-sweeping statute that takes everybody in.

14

And -- and we have to look --

15

QUESTION:

I -- I guess that one of the problems

16

I have with -- with your side of the case is that this is

17

public information insofar as a conviction is concerned.

18

Insofar as addresses, credit card companies, and driver's

19

license bureaus have this stuff all the time.

20

seem to me that if the Court were to strike down these

21

laws, some private business could have a web -- a web

22

page, just like credit card companies do.

23

some Privacy Act concerns, but still, this is truthful

24

information.

25

MR. THOMPSON:

It would

There may be

It's not truthful information,

32

and respectfully, I -- I agree with what Justice Ginsburg

2

was saying earlier.

3

QUESTION:

I mean, it's -- it's false -It's -- it's truth as far as it goes.

4

There's nothing false in the information reported.

5

I questioned whether it was the whole truth because it has

6

the bad side, but none of the good.
MR. THOMPSON:

7
8

particularly when we look -- we look to -QUESTION:

9
10

Well, I -- I suppose a lot of

credit -MR. THOMPSON:

11
12

It's sort of the sin of omission,

Well, and -- and it goes further

than that.
QUESTION:

13

-- the credit reports are misleading

14

too.

Maybe the person is now very successful, and is

15

paying all their bills.

16

MR. THOMPSON:

You don't know.
But the legislatures made it

17

clear that they are telling the public that these people

18

weren't just someone who once had a conviction.

19

telling the public that these people are actively

20

dangerous now, presently dangerous to be actively avoided.
And how do they do that?

They're

12

there's a hazard here, a risk they don't want to take.

13

MR. THOMPSON:

They make

What I was getting at earlier

14

was -- is that the State of Alaska makes it a crime,

15

felony child endangerment, if you leave your kid alone

16

with someone who's on the registry.

17

that that person is safe.

18

person is not dangerous.

19

they are to be avoided.

20

QUESTION:

And it doesn't matter

It doesn't matter that that
So the State is telling you that

Well, but that -- that issue is

21

not -- not before the Court, and if that's so, this --

22

this just shows that it's a regulatory scheme which has

23

another valid purpose.

24
25

MR. THOMPSON:

We disagree.

What we think that

demonstrates is that it's a clear proclamation because it

34

1

came at the same time as the amendments in '97, a clear

2

proclamation of a legislative intent to tell the public

3

that everyone on that registry is currently, presently

4

dangerous.
QUESTION:

5

Well, you disagree with -- you

6

disagree with the court of appeals then when they said it

7

was not a punitive intent on the part of -MR. THOMPSON:

8
9

Yes, we do disagree with that and

we -- we briefed that in our brief.
QUESTION:

10

Well, you would -- you would concede

11

that it is least ambiguous because the legislature said

12

our purpose is regulatory.

13

that's -- that's incredible.

So you're not going to say

14

MR. THOMPSON:

15

it was a civil regulatory measure.

16

said and what their sole reliance on intent is, is in the

17

preamble where it says it serves to protect the public.

18

And -- and it's clear that protection of the public in --

19

in Salerno was -- was viewed as a proper regulatory goal,

20

but in -- in Brown it's also viewed as a proper criminal

21

goal.

22

goals under article I, section 12 of the penal

23

administration -- it is a criminal goal to protect the

24

public.

25

Well, the legislature never said
What the legislators

And in Alaska, it's the goal -- one of the stated

So I don't think that -- that's -- that's -QUESTION:

But it's a civil goal too, I --

35

1

MR. THOMPSON:

2

QUESTION:

It is a civil goal too.

You rely to some extent on the

3

placement in the criminal code both that the information

4

about this registry system has to be part of every

5

criminal judgment and part of every rule 11 colloquy.

6

MR. THOMPSON:

That's -- that's true.

The

7

legislature, you know, in our view considered it such an

8

important component and consequence of any criminal

9

conviction, that in fact, that's the only information that

10

a judge has to give to someone convicted of a sex offense

11

in writing.

12

QUESTION:

So I thought it might be fair for you

13

to say, well, it's -- it's mixed.

14

some respects, it's -- looks regulatory.

15

respects it looks punitive.

16

you say instead of -- so we have to look further.

17

you saying right from the very reading of this law, it is

18

necessarily punitive?

19

MR. THOMPSON:

It's ambiguous.

In

In other

I thought that's what would

We do believe that.

But are

I mean, it

20

was intended, again, to protect the public, but when you

21

look to a law that's -- that's geared directly at

22

individuals or groups of individuals and not set out to

23

regulate any kind of activities, you know, that is an

24

intent in our view to -- to punish --

25

QUESTION:

Would it affect --

36

1
2

MR. THOMPSON:

-- solely based upon a prior

conviction.
QUESTION:

3

Your claim is an ex post facto claim,

4

a retroactivity claim.

Suppose this scheme, the Alaska

5

scheme, did allow people -- like the parties here -- to

6

say, I'm no longer dangerous.

7

that.

8

it's still punitive?

9

made no showing at all of lack of dangerousness,

Take me off the list.

Here's the documentation of
Would you say, nonetheless,

Are you saying that even if someone

10

this is -- it would be ex post facto and therefore must

11

fall?

MR. THOMPSON:

13

QUESTION:

14

If I -- Justice Ginsburg --

You -- you are asserting that Doe I

and II are people who are no longer dangerous.

15

MR. THOMPSON:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

But I'm asking you about the people

17

in this large category who are still dangerous, or at

18

least have made no showing that they're not dangerous.

19

You would have the same ex post facto argument with

20

respect to those people?

21

extent, on the ability to show that you're not dangerous?

22

MR. THOMPSON:

Or does it depend, to some

First of all, I think we would --

23

we would take the position that in the absence of any

24

criteria of actual present dangerousness demonstrates

25

that -- that the legislature is aimed at the prior

37

1

conviction and tacking on certain responsibilities to the

2

prior conviction as opposed to really trying to fit the

3

goal here of protecting the public from dangerous people.
QUESTION:

4

But if the legislature says we don't

5

want this to be punitive, therefore we will give everyone

6

who was a convicted sex offender an opportunity to show

7

that they're no longer dangerous, and then there will be a

8

determination made, yes, you are, no, you're not, would

9

you still be making the ex post facto argument for the

10

people who have not shown they're no longer dangerous?
MR. THOMPSON:

11
12

closer call, and --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. THOMPSON:

15

I think it would certainly be a

Why would it be a --- and my clients would certainly

invite that hearing.
QUESTION:

16

Why would it be a closer call?

Why

17

would it be a closer call?

18

regulation punishment?

19

you're claiming is that some people who are not dangerous

20

are -- are wrongly covered by this regulatory measure.

21

That still doesn't prove that the regulatory measure is

22

punitive.

I mean, all that would show -- all

It just shows that it's stupid.

23

(Laughter.)

24

QUESTION:

25

Is everything that is bad

Post Facto Clause.

That doesn't make it violate the Ex
Every regulatory measure that goes too

38

1

far is -- is not criminal punishment.
MR. THOMPSON:

2

It is if it looks just like

3

probation and has the same consequences as probation

4

because probation is historically -QUESTION:

5

That's -- that's -- the question

6

Justice Ginsburg started with is every time -- you just

7

replied to Justice Scalia -- and what I hear are words

8

that seem to apply with equal force to a perfectly-

9

tailored statute that would catch only the most dangerous

10

sex offenders who everyone agrees are virtually

11

uncontrollable and might repeat their offense many, many

12

times.

13

See, if it applies -- if the argument -- the

14

question people are asking you -- I'm simply repeating

15

it -- is, on your argument why isn't that just as much an

16

ex post facto law?

17

that it's overly broad, et cetera, which sounds to me like

18

a substantive due process argument, not an ex post facto

19

argument?

20

to focus right on it.

21
22
23

What has it got to do with the matter

That's the same question.

MR. THOMPSON:

But I would like you

Well, I apparently have not been

doing a very good job of it, but I'll try.
When we look to whether or not the statute

24

imposes a punishment, I think it's important that we look

25

to whether or not it -- it's -- fits with the umbrella of

39

1

things which have historically considered to be

2

punishment.

3

that's why I keep going back to the concept of probation

4

and parole because historically there's no dispute that

5

probation is a depravation of liberty.

6

like going to jail, but it's a depravation of liberty.

7

And -- and it's been considered as punishment, and that's

8

what this thing does to people.

9

And that's one of our starting points, and

Not -- it's not

Now, if it was a perfectly-tailored -- such that

10

it could weed out the dangerous from the non-dangerous --

11

well, we would invite that because my clients wouldn't be

12

here today.

13

be not dangerous by a superior court family judge.

14

My client has been determined, you know, to

But would it still be punishment?

I think we'd

15

have to look at the -- a little bit closer at it.

16

you know, if there's a closer nexus between the public

17

purpose and there -- there is a weeding out, maybe it

18

wouldn't be punishment because maybe it's -- it's

19

escapable, it -- it's --

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. THOMPSON:

22
23

But,

But then -- then you might --- at that point, it's not

regulating him for life.
QUESTION:

Well, at that point at least there

24

would be -- I -- I assume your -- your point would be that

25

there -- there is at least a -- a credible basis to say

40

1

that if it covers only those who are affirmatively shown

2

to be dangerous, the object is simply to apprise the

3

public to who is dangerous, and that doesn't sound very

4

punitive.

5

dangerous from the non-dangerous, then the claim that the

6

object is simply to apprise the public of who is dangerous

7

is not so credible.

But if there is no attempt to weed out the

I mean, isn't -- isn't --

8

MR. THOMPSON:

That is my point.

9

QUESTION:

-- that one of your points?

10

QUESTION:

If that's your point, then how do you

11

respond to their argument which is that that's just too

12

tough to do?

13

would invite endless hearings.

14

administer this statute.

15

I'm repeating it --

We don't know enough about it.

16

MR. THOMPSON:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. THOMPSON:

It -- it

It would be impossible to

I'm not making the argument.

Right.

-- for you to respond to.
I guess that would make the --

19

the due process hearing or the -- the hearing that is

20

established in -- in Hendricks, and the hearing that's

21

established in Salerno futile as well.

or not people are presently dangerous.

I mean, judges are

They do it every

It's called the Chaney Criteria.

41

They have to look to whether or not someone poses a risk

2

to the community.

That's what they have to do in --

QUESTION:

3

How many Megan's Laws have that

4

regime?

5

them are like Alaska.

They say this is based solely on

6

your past conviction.

Others say you have an opportunity

7

to show that you're no longer dangerous.

8

the range of Megan's Laws that all the States have, how

9

many treat this as something you can get out of by showing

10

I -- I understand that some of them do.

Some of

QUESTION:

I don't --

What's wrong about -I don't know that.

What's wrong about warning the public

17

about who may be dangerous?

about who is dangerous.

MR. THOMPSON:

You -- you seem to say that

What's wrong about warning the
Let the public make --

I guess we get down to this who

23

determines who they're -- who may be dangerous or not.

24

I mean, what -- what's the criteria for that?

25

QUESTION:

What is irrational or

42

1

unconstitutional about warning the public about a category

2

of people who may be dangerous as to whom -- as the entire

3

category of whom, there's more likely to be danger than --

4

than with respect to other people?

5

that you can only warn the public about those whom you

6

have -- are sure are dangerous?

7

MR. THOMPSON:

Where is it written

Part of the problem with the

8

statute, it's not just a warning of the public.

I mean,

9

it -- it's -- there are really various components.

It's

10

not just a notification statute.

11

public right now has access to -- through another statute

12

that we have -- to offender information.

13

to do is request.

14

in -- in one sense.

15

No.

16

information that's available not just going to a

17

courthouse, but you can actually request the State for

18

that information.

19

information may be limited.

20

I mean, you know, the

All they've got

And this is an unnecessary statute
Does it broadcast it on the Internet?

But the same information is available, and it's

And -- and for some people, the

QUESTION:

There are some restrictions.

I'm -- I'm not sure if it helps you

21

or hurts you.

It -- it indicates that -- that the most

22

distressing and damaging fact that you have -- that you

23

have the conviction is available to the public anyway.

24

And this is just a regulatory scheme to -- to make that

25

information more clear as to how many people are in the

43

1
2

community have suffered that conviction.
MR. THOMPSON:

What I was going to say is that

3

the information as to serious offenses that are beyond

4

10 years is limited.

5

some sense of it's been a long time.

6

is limited to those people that have a need to know, like

7

for example, the day care providers and the teachers

8

and -- and schools who want to know --

9

QUESTION:

There's some sense of limitation,
So that information

Well, but I take it under the

10

registration form we're talking about, that the date of

11

the conviction is there, and the -- the citizen can make

12

up his or her own mind as to whether the conviction was so

13

long ago that they're no longer worried about it.

14

MR. THOMPSON:

They really don't have the right

15

kind of information to make that decision.

16

they have is only the conviction --

17
18

QUESTION:

You want -- you want more information

on this form?

19

MR. THOMPSON:

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. THOMPSON:

22
23

I mean, what

Absolutely not.

The -- you know, I don't.

I

don't want more information.
And the -- the tribunal that should be making

24

the determination of dangerousness really ought to be in a

25

thoughtful, rational process in front of a -- of a judge.

44

1

QUESTION:

What -- what if the State simply

2

decided we're going to put on the Internet, the same way

3

that Alaska does here, the names of all the people who had

4

criminal convictions of any sort without any more

5

information in -- in the last 5 years?

6

applied that to people who were convicted after they

7

passed it, would that be ex post facto?
MR. THOMPSON:

8
9

Now, if they

I don't know that it would.

would probably have the same stigmatizing effect.

It

I mean,

10

I just -- I want to share with you the State has already

11

done that in the State of Alaska.

12

as to anyone in the State of Alaska by a click of a mouse

13

by going on the Internet, if their convictions were in the

14

State of Alaska.

That information is already available.

QUESTION:

15

You can get information

If it had the same stigmatizing

16

effect, why would your answer be different?

17

would it not be ex post facto in that case, whereas it is

18

in this?

19

Why -- why

I'm not sure what line you're drawing.
MR. THOMPSON:

Well, the stigmatizing effect

20

here is that these people are being currently labeled

21

as -- as sex offenders.

22

QUESTION:

No.

I -- I realize that, but you

23

said in answer to the Chief Justice's question that there

24

would be the same -- in your judgment, there would be the

25

same stigmatizing effect if they put every criminal

45

1

conviction on -- on the Internet.

2

stigmatizing effect would be the same and the information

3

would be just as readily available, why would your answer

4

be different, that that would not be ex post facto whereas

5

this is?

6

And if -- if the

That would not be punitive.
MR. THOMPSON:

This is punitive.

Well, perhaps it would, but you

7

know, our analysis of this ex post facto argument is

8

really a composite of a variety of components of the

9

statute and not simply the public notification provision.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. THOMPSON:

12

QUESTION:

13

Well, what -It's certainly an important part.

You're tapping everything, the

register and --

14

MR. THOMPSON:

15

QUESTION:

Yes.

So you would say even just the

16

requirement that they register, even if it's just

17

circulated to law enforcement people, that's impermissibly

18

retroactive as well.

19

So there can be -- is there any scheme for

20

keeping track of ex-offenders that would pass the ex post

21

facto test in your judgment, or is it just they've served

22

their time, they've done whatever, parole is given to

23

them, and that's it?

24
25

MR. THOMPSON:

You know, if -- if the

requirements of the individual subject to the registration

46

1

requirements alone were not as onerous as here where they

2

have to report on every 90 days all kinds of personal

3

information, and if they don't, then they're going to

4

be -- go -- go to jail, it may be a closer call.

5

there was the -- the history of the felony registrations,

6

but they've never really been approved by this Court as

7

somehow being a proper regulatory measure.
QUESTION:

8
9

I mean,

On the other hand, I don't know of

any precedent -- perhaps you can tell us if there is --

10

from this Court saying that a measure with a declared

11

regulatory purpose is, nonetheless, impermissibly

12

retroactive.

MR. THOMPSON:

13
14

I don't know of any case that so holds.

either.

15

(Laughter.)

16

QUESTION:

17

Nothing is jumping out at me

Let me ask you to comment on -- on

one thing --

18

MR. THOMPSON:

19

QUESTION:

But these are unique statutes.

I'm sorry.

One -- one thing that

20

makes it more difficult perhaps than it might be to see

21

your side of the argument -- go back to the Chief

22

Justice's question.

23

conviction on the Internet?

24
25

What if they put every criminal

Well, there's one difference between the
situation that would obtain then and the situation that --

47

1

that you're objecting to here.

That is, that there is not

2

the same high recidivism rate for crimes generally that

3

there is, apparently undisputedly, for sex crimes in the

4

State of Alaska.

5

argument that there is something very -- something less

6

than credible in the State's claim that it's merely trying

7

to inform the public when, in fact, it makes no

8

differentiation between current dangerousness and un­

9

current dangerousness, the answer is there is -- or an

10

answer is -- there is a very high recidivism rate, and

11

that high recidivism rate does support the claim that

12

there is something that -- that it is credible to say that

13

by publishing this information, we are simply trying to

14

inform people of a probability of dangerousness, leaving

15

them to do what they want.

And therefore, when you earlier made the

16

What is -- is there any -- do you have any

17

response to this claim that the high recidivism rate

18

itself supports the argument that, in fact, this is

19

nothing but a safety information kind of measure, whereas

20

broadcasting all criminal convictions would not be

21

justified as having a good fit between the object and what

22

the State was doing?

23

Do you have any response to that?

MR. THOMPSON:

I certainly don't profess to be

24

an expert on the statistical recidivist rates.

25

that is --

48

I think

1
2

QUESTION:

You don't dispute the State's

recidivism figure, do you?
MR. THOMPSON:

3

Well, actually vis-a-vis the

4

brief that was submitted by Massachusetts as an amici in

5

this, sets forth a very different pattern of recidivist

6

rates.

7

talking about repeat sex offenses?

8

repeated crimes?

9

which --

I mean, when we say recidivist rates, are we

I mean, there are all different ways in

QUESTION:

10

Are we talking about

They're making specific -- they're

11

making specific claims.

12

percentages with respect to Alaska.

13

those figures or not?

14

MR. THOMPSON:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. THOMPSON:

They -- they set out specific
Are you disputing

We do.

You do.

All right.

We do, but I don't think we did

17

it directly in our brief, but I think other -- other

18

briefs --

QUESTION:

That's -- that's the trouble.

MR. THOMPSON:

21

You know, even if we accept --

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- do.

Do you take into account that the

23

degree of harm, if you make a mistake?

24

somebody is a pickpocket and you have a list and say,

25

pickpockets have to register, the same thing as here.

49

That is, suppose

So

1

if you make a mistake about a pickpocket, somebody is out

2

of some change.

3

person's dangerousness, the consequences could be very

4

grave.

5

If you make a mistake here about a

MR. THOMPSON:

And there's a solution to that,

6

and the solution is have -- is to look to the

7

individualized determination of the person's present

8

dangerousness.

9

And, you know, in the McKune case, the --

QUESTION:

Would it be all right to have the

10

person report every 90 days to have a determination of

11

present dangerousness?

12

MR. THOMPSON:

It certainly wouldn't be

13

necessary for John Doe I.

14

determination that he's not dangerous by a court.

15

know why you'd have to continue to redo that.

16

idea is you get progressively --

QUESTION:

He's already had a
I don't

I mean, the

I'm interested in the Chief Justice's

hypothetical.

19

MR. THOMPSON:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. THOMPSON:

No, it wouldn't be all right.

It wouldn't be all right?
No, not every 90 days.

That's --

22

that's awfully burdensome to require someone not just to

23

come into the police station or fill out a written form,

24

but to require someone -- as a direct consequence of a

25

prior conviction, to require someone to come and -- and be

50

1

subject every 90 days to a judicial scrutiny as to whether

2

or not you're still dangerous, that seems to be a pretty

3

big disability.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. THOMPSON:

6

QUESTION:

7

It is a way out.

And one of your complaints is this

system provides no way out.
MR. THOMPSON:

8
9

It is a way out.

That's absolutely correct.

It is

a way out.
The Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act really

10
11

is nothing other than tacking on -- for my clients -- a

12

lifetime of probation, a lifetime of community

13

supervision, having to report to the police -- my time is

14

up.

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Thompson.

16

Mr. Roberts, you have 4 minutes remaining.

17

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

19

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

20

I think it is very important to place the

21

various points that have been touched on this morning in

22

the proper legal framework.

23

The question, Justice Kennedy, is not whether

24

it's burdensome to require someone to fill out a form and

25

verify it.

The question is, is that so punitive that you

51

1

don't believe the legislature when it says that we're

2

doing this to prevent future harm?

3

The question, Justice Ginsburg, is not whether

4

it might be a better system if it included other

5

information, or whether that would be too burdensome for

6

the State.

7

ameliorative information convince you that the legislature

8

was simply not telling the truth when it said we're doing

9

this to prevent future harm?

The question is, does the failure to put on

10

And the question is not whether you should have

11

an individualized determination or a group determination.

12

It is, is the group determination so irrational that you

13

think the legislature was not really interested in

14

preventing future harm, it was just doing this to punish?

15

In fact, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, this Court has

16

never found a law with a civil regulatory purpose to

17

violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.

18
19

QUESTION:

Is the effects test used to impeach

the finding that the legislature had a regulatory intent?

20

MR. ROBERTS:

21

QUESTION:

I think that is --

I -- I thought that it was an

22

additional step that you had to take if you -- even if you

23

find the legislature had the -- the permitted intent.

24
25

MR. ROBERTS:

I think it only makes sense if you

view it as impeaching the intent because, as Chief Justice

52

1

Warren pointed out in Trop v. Dulles, the evident purpose

2

is controlling because the same sanction can be civil or

3

criminal.

4

A $10,000 fine is.

5

the individual because --

6

$10,000 civil penalty is not criminal.

QUESTION:

You don't look at the perspective of

So long as the legislature has a pure

7

intent, it can have as burdensome a regulation as it wants

8

based on previous criminal convictions?

9

MR. ROBERTS:

I think if the regulation is so

10

burdensome that it causes you to doubt the intent, then

11

you do have a problem, but that is the purpose.

12

QUESTION:

You're not saying -- you're saying if

13

it's -- it wouldn't violate the Ex Post Facto Clause in

14

your view.

15

substantive due process.

16

It might violate some other clause like the

MR. ROBERTS:

But again, with respect to both

17

the Ex Post Facto Clause and the Due Process Clause, the

18

question is whether there's a rational connection between

19

the sanction and the legislative purpose.

20

Now, if it is too extreme, it may cause you to

21

doubt that connection.

For example, it may be -- the

22

legislature may say we think safe crackers present a risk

23

of recidivism, so we're going to cut off their hands.

24

There may be a rational connection there, but it's too

25

excessive given the purpose.

53

1

There's no way in which this law can be regarded

2

as too excessive.

It simply makes available information

3

that is already a matter of public record, and publicly

4

available because criminal trials under our system have to

5

be public.

6

Thank you, Your Honor.
