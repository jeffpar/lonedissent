ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. GELLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case concerns the applicability of the

12

Contract Disputes Act to contracts between National Park

13

Service and the private concessioners who contract to

14

provide visitor services and to operate and maintain

15

facilities in more than 100 of our national parks.

16

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Geller, I have a couple of

preliminary questions.
First of all, this is a facial challenge made by

19

the National Park Hospitality Association, I take it.

20

is the claim ripe for adjudication?

21

been injured actually?

22

MR. GELLER:

How

Has the association

There's no case pending.
Your Honor, to begin with, let me

23

say that as to this facial challenge point, this -- this

24

was an argument that was never made below.

25

made in the district court.

It was not

MR. GELLER:

But let me also say quickly that I think this

11

Mr. Geller, I think that -- I think

12

the ripeness issue --

MR. GELLER:

14
15

17

So it -- it may well be waived.

Yes, I was going to address

ripeness.
QUESTION:

-- subsists whether or not it's a

facial challenge.
MR. GELLER:

Right.

I was going to address

18

ripeness separately, Justice Scalia.

In terms of this

19

facial/as-applied, this is an APA challenge to a

20

regulation.

21

this facial/as-applied nomenclature --

I'm not aware that the Court has really used

22

QUESTION:

Okay.

23

MR. GELLER:

-- in that -- in that context.

24

After all, under the APA, the question is whether a --

3

contracts are subject to the CDA.

4

in fact, some such contracts that are subject to the CDA,

as we believe there are, then that regulation is arbitrary

and capricious.

If there -- there are,

The agency should have to go back and

9

Here we have a regulation that categorically

Is that -- is that the standard for

ripeness --

10

MR. GELLER:

11

QUESTION: -- whether the regulation is arbitrary

12

I --

or --

13

MR. GELLER:

14

QUESTION:

No, no, no.

I --

Why is this any different -- you

15

contend that the agency has no authority to speak

16

authoritatively on this -- on this issue anyway.

17

therefore, this regulation, as I understand your -- your

18

position, is -- is of no more effect than the agency's

19

announcement of what its litigating position will be.

20

MR. GELLER:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. GELLER:

And

Not quite, Justice Scalia.

All right.
I'm trying to -- I'm trying to

23

distinguish the facial/as-applied point that Justice

24

O'Connor raised from the ripeness question, which I'll get

25

to in just a minute.

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

This is not a -- a -- there was an as-applied

2

challenge, to begin with, made in the district court.

3

This is not a facial challenge in the sense that we're

4

asking the Court to strike down the regulation based on

5

hypotheticals or on factual situations that may never

6

arise.

8

It seems to us rather easy to determine whether the

9

services that are called for in those contracts bring the

The NPS has issued standard concessions contracts.

10

contracts within the -- within the CDA.

11

there's anything to this facial challenge.

12

QUESTION:

Well, presumably there are many

13

different kinds of concession contracts.

14

covered; some might not.

15

So I don't think

MR. GELLER:

Some might be

Well, I don't think so, Justice

16

O'Connor, because there are standard concessions

17

contracts.

18

call for certain types of services.

19

clear that the Court, as the two lower courts did, can

20

determine whether those contracts call for the procurement

21

of services that would bring them within the CDA or call

22

for the repair or maintenance of real property.

They're in the record and it's clear that they

There are, I think, three.

Three?

There are -- there

Now, in terms of your ripeness argument, Justice

6
7

Scalia, once again, the -- the Government never made any

8

suggestion that this case was not ripe below.

9

it's not unripe is that the standard concession contracts

The reason

10

and the contracts that, in fact, the NPS is putting out

11

for bid incorporate within them the statement that these

12

contracts are not subject to the CDA.

13

members need to know now, in terms of deciding whether to

14

bid on certain contracts, what their rights are under

15

those contracts, and therefore -QUESTION:

16

The NPHA and its

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. GELLER:

We are harmed, Justice Ginsburg,

2

because it is important for the concessioners to know, at

3

the time that they're deciding whether to bid on a

4

contract and -- and the time they're deciding how much to

5

bid on a contract, what their rights are under that

contract.

It's a pre-bid -- it's a solicitation in which

8

That would be the same case if the

agency simply announced, our litigating position in these

10

contracts is going to be that they are not covered by the

11

Contract Disputes Act.

12

MR. GELLER:

13

You'd be in exactly the same

MR. GELLER:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Yes, but the --

And we would be --

Would -- would you have the ability

to sue?
MR. GELLER:

We would be -- because it is a

provision of these contracts, Your Honor, that

20

incorporates the regulation that states that they are not

21

subject to the CDA.

23

on their face by incorporating this regulation, say you

It seems to us -- and we

this challenge, so it's not been briefed -- that the

2

concessioners have a right to know at the outset, in

3

deciding whether or not to bid, whether the Government is

4

right in asserting that they have no rights under the CDA

5

if they enter into these -QUESTION:

6

Well, if it's an invalid provision,

7

could the contracting party simply contract and then go

8

into court later on and say, well, this clause is

9

unenforceable?
MR. GELLER:

10

Well, I don't know, Justice

11

Kennedy.

12

the provision in the contract that says that you have no

13

rights enforceable under the CDA.

14

You would be signing a contract that agrees to

But beyond that, the Government has taken the

15

position you have no rights enforceable under the CDA.

16

it's not clear how you would follow through on your rights

17

under that --

QUESTION:

Well --

19

If you're -- if you're right,

So

20

Mr. Geller, I suppose your client could go into court and

21

ask for a declaratory judgment, even though there's

22

nothing in the contract saying, we want to find out which

23

provision of -- as to review applies to us.

24
25

MR. GELLER:

But this is a pre-enforcement

challenge to a regulation --

1

QUESTION:

But that's -- that's the problem.

2

MR. GELLER:

3

QUESTION:

But --

In the case that I put, I don't think

4

you could get declaratory relief until you've alleged that

5

there was going to be a dispute.

6

MR. GELLER:

QUESTION:

You can say, yes, I --

But there is a --

-- I might have an argument down the

line and I want to know where I want to go.

10

MR. GELLER:

11

QUESTION:

That seems to

But -- but, Justice Kennedy, the --

-- speculative.

12

harm to your client in waiting.

13

MR. GELLER:

I just don't see the

The harm, Your Honor, is in not

14

knowing, at the time you're being asked to bid on

15

contracts, what your rights are under those contracts.

16

QUESTION:

So it's --

17

MR. GELLER:

18

QUESTION:

It's like any other provision.

Is it established -- I mean, my -- my

19

guess is it is, but -- but if the Government, the Defense

20

Department, any other Department, presents a -- a private

21

individual with a contract with 14 conditions and one of

22

those conditions, in the view of the private person, is

23

unlawful, not authorized by statute, contrary to statute,

24

that that person, before bidding on the contract, can go

25

to court and say, I would like this set aside as unlawful.

I think that there is a --

Is there authority on that?
I think that there's --

If there is authority on that, I

guess that's the end of it.
MR. GELLER:

You're right.

Yes, I think there is authority

under -- under the -- under the Tucker Act, which is one

of the provisions of -- that we cited in the complaint,

Yes, there are, but -- but I was

about to say, Mr. Chief Justice, that this -- that the

MR. GELLER:

MR. GELLER:

QUESTION:

MR. GELLER:

We're challenging both.

-- in the contracts.

Is that --

We're challenging both.

We brought

4

an APA challenge to the regulation, as well as a Tucker

5

Act challenge and a pre-bid solicitation challenge to the

6

inclusion of these -- this -- this illegal term in the --

in the contracts.
QUESTION:

9

But isn't it the case that unless you

have an -- an APA issue, there's nothing else that you can

10

litigate at this point?

11

you have to complain about is that they want to put a term

12

in a contract that you think they shouldn't be putting in,

13

it's up to you to decide whether you want to contract it

14

on those terms or not.
MR. GELLER:

15

I mean, if the only thing that

No, because I think under the law

16

we're entitled to challenge that solicitation as illegal.

17

We have to bid on these contracts, we're entitled to

18

know --

QUESTION:

No, but at this stage of the game,

20

they're not claiming that their regulation is -- is what

21

they call a legislative regulation.

22

MR. GELLER:

They are claiming that that is the

23

position that they're going to take and that it is

24

entitled to some level of deference.

Well --

MR. GELLER:

That footnote clearly says that it

QUESTION:

And --

MR. GELLER:

This is clearly the position, and

5

it's been upheld by the D.C. Circuit.

6

to suggest they're not going to adamantly enforce their --

7

their views.

QUESTION:

There's no reason

But then -- but if the case isn't

ripe and we should so hold, I assume the appropriate thing

10

to do would be to vacate the D.C. Circuit's decision to

11

that extent.

12

MR. GELLER:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

So then you'll be -- what you would

14

be -- have is the Government has told you in advance what

15

its litigating position would be and it has no more

there's still this provision in all of the contracts.
QUESTION:

The Government would still be

24

asking us to accede to a position and sign a contract that

contains a term which we believe is illegal that says we

QUESTION:

Well, what -- what if the Government

4

would be damages for delay, double damages depending on

5

the amount of delay?

contract.

Could you challenge that?
MR. GELLER:

I believe so, Mr. Chief

Federal Claims and in the district courts.

QUESTION:

Is -- is that where the law is, in

MR. GELLER:

Yes.

Well, there are probably some

appellate decisions as well, but the law is fairly

well-settled in this area.

Abbott Laboratories has been overtaken.

that in order to have a pre-enforcement challenge, you had

5

to have a pretty strong claim that you are hurting now, as

6

they were, if they didn't -- if they spent all that money.
MR. GELLER:

7

Yes.

But my notion was

Abbott Laboratories is -- is

8

obviously an APA case.

9

standard because we need to know now whether we should bid

10

I think we could meet that

on these contracts.
But there's a separate body of law involving

solicitations for Government contracts is what I'm saying

13

to the Court.

That -- that's your stronger card I

think.

17

MR. GELLER:

Yes.

And does that give you an APA cause

of action?
MR. GELLER:

Well, we brought both an APA cause

21

of action and a challenge under the -- under the Tucker

22

Act, and you know, we would maintain that we can challenge

23

this regulation, and in addition, we can challenge this

24

bid solicitation.

The two really overlap because the

MR. GELLER:

Well, Your -- there was -- there

Thank you, Justice Breyer.
Can I -- I'd like to begin by saying it's purely

before the Court.

MR. GELLER:

The Government --

I tried to -And I would like to turn to that

And they

Now, the first thing to be said, Justice Breyer,

7
8

about the Government's argument is that it is a complete

9

invention.

It is a complete invention.

No Federal

10

statute defines the word procurement or the word,

11

procurement contract, to include the two requirements that

12

the Government tells us are essential.

definition of the word procurement.

from reading the Government's brief because in their -- it

QUESTION:

Mr. Geller --

16

QUESTION:

What about acquiring --

17

QUESTION:

-- I'm looking at page 19 of the

18

Government's brief, and they -- they define procurement.

19

They're taking it from the -- the Federal acquisition

20

regulations to say acquiring by contract with appropriated

21

funds supplies or services by and for the use of the

22

Federal Government.

23
24
25

So --

MR. GELLER:

Yes.

That's -- that's not a

statute, but let me address that, Justice Ginsburg.
First of all, appropriated funds.

It is

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

clear -- and the Government has not challenged the fact --

2

that the CDA applies to contracts even when appropriated

3

funds are not used.

4

So the Government is forced to come -- come up with this

5

new phrase, Government funds, which has, as far as we can

6

tell, no basis at all in any prior statute or any Federal

7

procurement law.

8
9

That's clear on the face of the CDA.

And the fact --

QUESTION:

It does have a basis in just what

Justice Ginsburg was quoting, 48 C.F.R. 2.101.

So they

10

say it's not without foundation in the law.

What -- what

11

that's from is, I take it, it's a memo that -- or a policy

12

issued jointly by the Secretary of Defense, the

13

Administrator of General Services, and the NPS

14

Administrator.

15

I'd think that it's not so that it isn't somewhere in

16

Federal law.

So when they have a reg like that, I'd --

It's right there.

17

Now, there are some other things there --

18

MR. GELLER:

19

QUESTION:

But --

-- that you say are not necessarily

20

part of procurement.

21

things that overstate it doesn't mean this does.

22

MR. GELLER:

But that fact that there are other

So at bottom, that's it, the

18

pre-judgment interest feature.

19

MR. ELWOOD:

I -- I think that and because --

20

there are other things as well.

21

of the -- one of the purposes of the CDA was to cut

22

through all of these requirements that you exhaust

23

administrative remedies, but those simply aren't present

24

in the concessions context.

25

For example, the purpose

never indicated that they thought the remedial scheme was

2

inadequate for concessioners.

QUESTION:

And --

Is this -- is this claim ripe?

And

4

why didn't you ever talk about it below?

What's going on?

5

It's -- it comes in such an odd posture.

What is the

6

Government's view on that?
MR. ELWOOD:

7

The reason why we did not raise

8

this -- why we did not raise this is because we did not

raise it below.

And as you can tell from the pleadings --

Why not?

13

it was just not the focus of the proceedings, as you can

tell by the opinion.

-- is -- because the CDA was kind
It was a relatively small issue and

But I think that the Court has raised valid

15
16

concerns about the ripeness in this sense.

17

traditionally said in a pre-enforcement challenge to a

18

regulation that a claim is ripe if it affects primary

19

conduct so that -- so that if they don't comply, they

20

might be held liable.

21

cases.

22

The Court has

That's the Abbott Labs line of

And here this doesn't affect primary conduct.

23

It -- it predominantly just says whether or not -- which

24

forum you're going to have a remedy in.

25

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I would agree --

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

What about this -- what about the --

2

the reply?

I came in thinking ripeness was a problem, and

3

your brother on the other side gave to me what was a very

4

convincing answer.

What's wrong with that answer?

MR. ELWOOD:

5

And that is -- the thing is because

6

it predominantly just determines which forum you have --

7

which forum you bring your claim in, I don't know -QUESTION:

8
9

I know it doesn't affect -- but what

they're saying is that where the Government offers general

10

contracts to the industry and there is a term in all of

11

those contracts which, in the view of the industry, is

12

unlawful, they -- it's ripe for them to challenge that.

13

Now, what I'm afraid here would be that we or you or

14

somebody, in deciding whether that's an incorrect

15

argument, would upset what could be -- I have no idea if

16

it is -- a practice of contractors objecting to terms in

17

offered contracts as contrary to law.
So are you saying now that that is not ripe?

18
19

Are you saying that a contractor who comes into a court

20

and objects to a term in a proposed contract as contrary

21

to law does not have a claim because it is not ripe?

22

that the Government's position?

If it affects their primary -QUESTION:

No.

I would think probably you would

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

at least want to brief it.

2

MR. ELWOOD:

Right.

3

I think that if it affects their primary

4

conduct, if affects what their obligations would be under

5

the contract, I think that that claim would be ripe for

pre-enforcement review.

But I

your claim in, I don't think it would be covered.

QUESTION:

If I

So you -- so there's a dispute

17

between the two sides on what the case law says as to

18

whether -- and it isn't even a general -- a general attack

19

upon the form of -- upon a form contract.

20

understand from petitioners, there were particular bids

21

outstanding that were challenged because -- because of a

22

term in them that -- that was claimed to be unlawful.

23

it is your position that you cannot challenge a particular

24

bid because of an unlawful term unless that unlawful term

25

affects your primary conduct.

But as we

MR. ELWOOD:

No.

If it affects something other,

I think, than the forum in which it was brought, I mean,

if it affects what you think your obligations will be,

if -- if it affects the price that you think you should

pay or that you should bid on a contract, I think that

that would be --

MR. ELWOOD:

9

Well, it -- it does on your analysis.
-- subject to pre-enforcement

review.
QUESTION:

10

Doesn't it?

I mean, you said one of

11

the things that is important is pre-judgment interest.

12

I -- I suppose their liability under the contract is going

13

to be affected by -- by the correctness of the reg.

14

MR. ELWOOD:

15

QUESTION:

So

I don't think their liability --

Their primary conduct won't be, but

16

their potential liability, if there is a contract dispute,

17

would be.

18

MR. ELWOOD:

Your Honor, I confess that I am not

19

sure if the Government gets pre-judgment interest under

20

the CDA or not.

21

to the contractors, I think that -- that the prospective

22

interest on a claim that has not even arisen yet seems a

23

little vague --

24
25

But if it were -- if -- if it simply ran

QUESTION:

Why is that vague?

I mean, they --

They have accountants.

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

These

1

are big companies.

They calculate everything down to the

2

finest penny, and -- and they say, you know, we take into

3

account whether we're going to get pre-judgment interest,

4

which we -- if we have a dispute.

5

6

us.

7

the -- whatever.

8

They have accountants who do it.

And by the way, we have

And we will bid $42.36 less if we're not getting
All right?

So they work it all out.

And so, if that's so -- of course, if it isn't

9
10

so, it's a different story.

11

like that's so.
MR. ELWOOD:

12

But they've said something

I think it -- it would turn on --

13

in that case I just don't think that in advance you can

14

say with enough sort of concreteness and specificity that

15

you know how much a particular claim -- the -- the as-yet

16

unfiled, unrealized contract claims would be worth.

17

could say -QUESTION:

18

You

But, Mr. Elwood, isn't it really --

19

isn't a waiver of pre-judgment interest comparable to a

20

waiver of punitive damages, for example, which if you

21

insist on it, would affect the -- the amount one would bid

22

for a contract?

23

nothing.

I don't understand why you say it's worth

24

MR. ELWOOD:

25

QUESTION:

I mean --

I mean, it's something -- if the

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Government is willing to fight about it here and insist --

2

and put it in every contract, it must be of value to the

3

Government.

4

MR. ELWOOD:

What is actually -- just if I could

5

clarify this.

6

general term that applicable law will apply and because

7

applicable law includes all regulations, it is

8

incorporated that way.

9

CDA waiver or anything of that sort.

10
11

What is put into the contract is just a

QUESTION:

It doesn't specifically include a

So the contract itself does not

specify that the CDA does not apply.

12

MR. ELWOOD:

13

governs the contract.

No.

It just says applicable law

14

But I think it's just a matter --

15

QUESTION:

And is it -- is it your view, since

16

you said your -- your interpretation now of the -- the

17

position that the Park Service is taking that it -- it

18

doesn't constitute law?

19

of all, the Contract Dispute Act is not within the Park

20

Service bailiwick.

21

the -- doesn't administer this act.

22

regulation constitute any kind of law?

23

How can it constitute law?

First

It isn't -- as you concede, it isn't

MR. ELWOOD:

So does that

I think that that's a valid concern

24

because our position is that this is basically just an

25

interpretive rule announcing the position that the Park

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Service will take and the Park -- and the position that

2

the Park Service employees will take in administering it.
QUESTION:

3

So you're saying -- you -- you claim

4

that this provision is not incorporated in the contracts.

5

Is that the position the Government is taking?
MR. ELWOOD:

6

I think -- honestly, Justice

7

Scalia, I think it's just -- it's a -- it's a new

8

proposition for me, and I think that a good argument could

9

be made that it does not include it because it -- it

10

really just represents the position of the National Park

11

Service.
QUESTION:

12

Even leaving aside the question of

13

inclusion, what is -- what do you understand your

14

difference to be from the petitioners with respect to the

15

status of the regulation itself?

16

at all?

17

MR. ELWOOD:

Is there any difference

I don't know that there is a -- a

18

difference with respect to the petitioner's view.

19

interpretive rule that the Park Service has --

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. ELWOOD:

Have we got any jurisdiction left?
I believe so because it is the

22

announced position.

23

is basically a directive to the --

24
25

QUESTION:

It's an

It's not just a policy statement.

Yes, but what's the difference

between a policy statement and an announced position?

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

It

1

The -- the point at which each one is going to have

2

practical effect is the point at which there is a claimed

3

breach and an argument, if there is one, over what the

4

remedial process is.
MR. ELWOOD:

5

Yes, but I think that the only

6

difference would be the -- the principal difference would

7

be policy statements are more -- involve more variance in

8

that they say as a general policy we will do this, whereas

9

the -- as an interpretive rule, it just says that we do

10

not believe that concession contracts are procurement

11

contracts.
QUESTION:

12

What -- what is the position of the

13

Government?

Now, I know this is hitting you cold, but I

14

think it would be helpful.
Position one.

15

We have not thought of ripeness

16

before, and the case has been argued and submitted on the

17

assumption that, for example, the bidding would be

18

affected by this term which is incorporated into the

19

contract.

20

reason to depart from it.

21

decide the issue we briefed.

22

That's been the assumption, and we see no

Position two.

It's not jurisdictional.

So

That's position one.

We haven't thought of ripeness

23

before, but now that we think about it, we think it's

24

quite a serious problem and we're not certain what the --

25

what the -- what the issue is in ordinary contracts, and

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

we're not certain whether it's incorporated.

2

you should say that this case is not ripe.

So we think

3

Now, do you take position one, which will mean

4

we perhaps could go to decide the issue for which it was

5

granted, or do you take position two, which means you see

6

ripeness as a big problem here that we ought to look at

7

further?
MR. ELWOOD:

8
9

Well, Justice Breyer, it's clearly

been the position of the Court that it is not bound by the

10

failure of the parties to raise it.

I'm not asking you what the law is

I'm asking you what's the Government's position.
MR. ELWOOD:

I -- I think our position would

16

be -- I mean, we -- we filed a brief in opposition and I

17

think, you know, if -- if we can win on ripeness grounds,

18

that's great too.

You wouldn't necessarily win.

MR. ELWOOD:

Right.

I

I mean --

We might lose the -- the

judgment of the D.C. Circuit as well, but -QUESTION:

You -- you would have to.

If it's

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

not ripe, we'd have to vacate it to that extent.

But

2

this -- in the D.C. Circuit --

3

QUESTION:

Put you back to square one.

4

QUESTION:

In the D.C. Circuit, this was a

No --

5

giant, one of those typical wholesale attacks on many,

6

many regulations, on the whole -- on the whole rulemaking.

7

Is that correct?

8

MR. ELWOOD:

9

QUESTION:

10

That's correct, Your Honor.

And this was just a tiny, tiny piece

of a long, long opinion --

That's correct, Your Honor.

this way.

Just a little part of a major opinion.
MR. ELWOOD:

Well, I think that it -- it just

17

points out the fact that, I mean, they -- they had an

18

awful lot on their plate, and it perhaps eluded them for

19

that reason.

20

QUESTION:

Now, the as-applied/facial.

Was the

21

as-applied challenges -- did those center on this issue or

22

did they relate to the -- to another issue?

23

MR. ELWOOD:

They related to other claims,

24

Justice Ginsburg.

Xanterra has characterized their claim

25

as an as-applied claim although they're -- they're not

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

asking for as-applied review in this case.

2

look at their -- their complaint, their complaint involved

3

their intention to bid on an as-yet unreleased prospectus.

4

And so, in that sense, I don't think that is an as-applied

5

change for two -- for two reasons.

6

7

filed, there was no contract.

8

9

QUESTION:

But if you

Not only is there no

So we think that it would

Mr. Elwood, if I can assist you in

10

giving the merits here, is it -- is it the case, as the

11

petitioners contend, that the Government concedes that not

12

all contracts covered by the CDA are contracts in which

13

appropriated funds are used?

14

MR. ELWOOD:

That's correct.

To the extent that

15

it covers non-appropriated fund instrumentalities, it

16

covers contracts that would involve the expenditure of

17

non-appropriated funds.

18

funds, funds of Government entities known as non-

19

appropriated fund instrumentalities.

20

QUESTION:

Those are, however, Government

Well, once you slip off from

21

appropriated into -- into Government funds, you don't put

22

any -- you don't have any statutory text you can appeal to

23

as -- as separating out the CDA from -- from your Park

24

Service concessions.

25

MR. ELWOOD:

I -- I don't agree, Justice Scalia.

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Both the -- well, to begin with, just in terms of giving

2

an indication of what the commonly accepted meaning of the

3

term was at the time, the Commission on Government

4

Procurement Reform, which was the -- which was the impetus

5

for all of these reforms, defined procurement as purchase

6

of product or service for Federal use, which incorporates

7

both a -- a notion of expenditure and Federal use.

8

both the -- the 1969 act -QUESTION:

9

And

Yes, but Federal use, of course -- it

10

is of use to the Park Service to have facilities available

11

to the public.

12

question.

13

available to the public with services in them, restrooms

14

and buildings and restaurants and so forth.

15

So in a sense, it is for the use of the Park Service and

16

the Government as well as for the public.

So that doesn't really answer the

The parks -- the Park Service wants parks

MR. ELWOOD:

17

Doesn't it?

It is for the use -- well, it is

18

not for the direct use of the National Park Service, and

19

that is where the Federal grant and cooperative agreement

20

comes in.

21

explained its understanding of what different types of

22

instruments would be used for, and it explained in that

23

that a procurement contract would be an instrument whose

24

principal purpose is the acquisition by purchase, lease,

25

or barter of goods or services for the direct use and

QUESTION:

2

And --

Well, it doesn't really say that.

3

And the language in the CDA is broad, and presumably this

4

was a -- an act that was presumed to have broad

application.
MR. ELWOOD:

6

It was presumed to have broad

application among procurement contracts.

8

indication that they did not intend the word procurement

9

to have the ordinary meaning that it does in that sense,

10

as indicated in the Commission on Government Procurement

Reform and the way it was used there, as indicated in the

12

1969 act creating the commission and the OFPP Act where

13

the simple use -- word procurement was understood to

14

mean --

15

QUESTION:

There's no

Was -- was there ever any amendment

16

offered in Congress to make clear that it didn't apply to

17

concession contracts?

18

MR. ELWOOD:

There was no -- no, there was no

19

indication in the entire legislative history that the --

20

that concessions came up, and in 1,200 pages of reports on

21

both procurement and non-appropriated fund procurement,

22

there was not a single mention of -- of -- national parks

23

concessions.

24
25

QUESTION:

And how long -- at -- at any point

did the CDA -- was it applied or followed with any

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

concession contracts, or is this something that has arisen

2

recently?

3

Was it used at one point?
MR. ELWOOD:

There are a number of Armed Service

4

Board of Contract Appeals that assume CDA jurisdiction,

5

and the Board of Contract Appeals of the Department of

6

Interior started using it in 1989.

7

with usage prior to that --

8
9

QUESTION:

But I'm not familiar

These are for what concessions?

PS -- PX concessions, for example?

10

MR. ELWOOD:

11

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

Well, why isn't that -- I mean --

12

because I was about to ask that question because I thought

13

you're drawing the distinction between a concession to

14

provide food and hot dogs and amusement to visitors to the

15

park, which you say is not covered by the CDA, and it

16

seems to me, a contract to provide food and hot dogs

17

and -- I don't know -- maybe amusement -- I don't know

18

what they have at PX's -- to members of the armed forces.

19

Why isn't at least the latter, although it's a concession

20

contract, why isn't that clearly for the benefit of the

21

Government even -- even in the narrow sense in which you

22

use that term?

23

MR. ELWOOD:

No, Justice Scalia.

We would -- we

24

would agree that that is for the benefit of the

25

Government.

It's -- it doesn't involve the expenditure of

49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Government funds, but it's for the benefit of the

2

Government.

And for this reason --

3

QUESTION:

So that would be covered by the CDA.

4

MR. ELWOOD:

I -- I don't believe it necessarily

5

would because it doesn't involve the expenditure of

6

Government funds.

7

in and being -- and paying the Government for the

8

opportunity to do that.

It's still private contractors coming

But as far as the benefit goes, I think agencies

9
10

have a direct interest in providing benefits to their

11

employees and especially in the PX example because PX's,

12

for example, are basically a fringe benefit for servicemen

13

and women and their dependents in that it's -- it's --

14

basically access is limited to them.

15

fringe benefits of that sort are how agencies procure

16

employees.

That is how they attract and retain qualified

17

personnel.

And in fact, agencies have drawn a distinction

18

between benefits provided to employees and benefits

19

provided to the entire public --

And salary and

20

QUESTION:

But isn't that the --

21

QUESTION:

You'd say -- it still isn't covered,

22

you say, unless the Government pays out cash.

23

right?

24
25

MR. ELWOOD:

Is that

I think that that would be the

better view, but I think obviously a stronger argument

50
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

could be made for concessioners.
QUESTION:

2

Well, why did you say it was not in

3

the legislative history in that respect?

What -- what is

4

this?

5

little clarification.

6

Senate report says that, quote, concessions contracts do

7

not constitute contracts for the procurement of goods and

8

services for the benefit of the Government or otherwise.

oh, the 1998 act is which?
MR. ELWOOD:

4

That's the --

That is the act -- the current

5

concession authority, the current authority under which

6

the National Park Service issues concession contracts.

7

QUESTION:

So what we have is in that act --

That was an act that said they're --

Yes, I see.

said, but we're going to terminate these things.

16

MR. ELWOOD:

17

QUESTION:

That's correct.

When did the Park Service first

18

install this -- when did it first take this position?

19

wasn't just under the regulations, as I understand it.

20

When did the Park Service take the position that

21

concession contracts were not procurement contracts?

22

MR. ELWOOD:

It

The first time they took that

23

position publicly was in 1979 in a Board of Contract

24

Appeals case, Yosemite Park & Curry Company.

25

the IBCA, rather, did not address it, though, because it

The court --

52
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

was actually before the effective date of the CDA, and

2

they took it specifically with respect to the CDA there.

3

But traditionally -- although it's impossible because of

4

absence of institutional memory, traditionally concession

5

contracts have not been viewed as procurement contracts by

6

the National Park Service.

7

QUESTION:

But they --

8

QUESTION:

You indicated that there's a stronger

9

argument in some instances than in others for the fact

10

that it's a concession.

procurement contract.

12

question about ripeness and we don't know what we're

13

involved with here?

14

I take it, they did involve the construction of facilities

15

at national parks, et cetera, which does benefit the

16

Government in the long term?

17

A concession contract can be a

Does that go back to our basic

Or can we take these contracts where,

MR. ELWOOD:

Well, to the extent that the Court

18

thinks that the specific terms of concession contracts and

19

what is accomplished under them affects the determination

20

of whether or not they're procurements, I think that the

21

Court would have some difficulty in saying authoritatively

22

whether they all are or an unacceptably high portion of

23

them are procurement contracts without having a better

24

idea of what is included with them.

25

If I could --

53
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

But if -- on a case-by-case basis,

2

then that would indicate the regulation is deficient

3

because the regulation doesn't purport to -- to use

4

this -- this kind of fine distinction.

5

MR. ELWOOD:

But still it -- it's something that

6

could be addressed in as-applied challenges where you

7

could say, in my particular case, where it requires me to

8

build a lodge or whatever, this is a procurement contract,

9

and under those circumstances it would be very clear

10

exactly what was required of the procurement contractor.

11

And they could -- they could -- of the concessions

12

contractor and they could determine whether or not that

13

particular contract was a procurement.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

The regulation -- the regulation

would then be invalid to that extent.
MR. ELWOOD:

Yes, but the Court has held -- this

17

Court has indicated in INS versus National Center for

18

Immigrants' Rights, Babbitt versus Sweet Home, and cases

19

like that that -- that merely because a regulation is

20

invalid in some applications, it will not be invalidated

21

on a facial basis.

22

If I could just address specifically --

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Elwood, is there anyplace we

24

could look to see how much pre-judgment interest the Park

25

Service has had to pay each year?

Is it a big-ticket

54
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

item?
MR. ELWOOD:

2

It's not a big-ticket item.

The

3

only three cases in which the -- the CDA has been applied

4

to national park concessions are the three IBCA cases

5

mentioned, and in two of those, the Government wound up

6

winning on the merits, so there was no pre-judgment

7

interest paid.

8

that the Government would have paid any pre-judgment

9

interest in this case.

So it's only in that R&R Enterprises case

If I could just go to your example, Justice

10
11

Kennedy, about the building of buildings on national

12

parklands.

13

a variety of reasons.

14

matter, 78 percent of concessions contracts do not involve

15

any capital improvements.

16

It's much broader than just structures.

17

unremovable property, and fixtures.

I believe that is not a procurement for -- for
First, just as a statistical

And that is a very broad term.
It's structures,

But on the merits, many concessions contractors

18
19

have been required, since the very beginning of the --

20

of -- of concessions, 1872, to require -- they've been

21

required to build their own buildings.

22

that has not been considered something that the Government

23

gets.

24

because it enters the contracts not for purposes of

25

getting a building, but because it wishes to have

And historically

It doesn't get the benefit of those services

55
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

concessioners provide services to park visitors.

2

order to do that, it tolerates the building.

3

Park Service doesn't want buildings in the parks.

4

wants nature in the parks, and it tolerates the buildings

5

to the extent that they are used to provide visitor

6

services.

7

are treated by the contract.

The National
It

And I think this comes across in the way these

Even though the Government has bare title in

8
9

And in

these buildings, in a very real sense it doesn't buy them.

10

Every concessioner who builds a building in the national

11

parks under a concessions agreement will have a leasehold

12

surrender interest equal to the construction cost of the

13

building plus inflation minus depreciation.

14

cannot be put out of that building by anyone until they

15

are paid that leasehold surrender interest; that is, until

16

the building essentially is bought.

17

concessioner is operating out of that building, a

18

concessioner will hold the leasehold surrender interest,

19

not the Government.

And they

As long as a

Also, I think it's telling that the form

20
21

contract indicates that if the concessioner ever leaves

22

the -- ever abandons the building, ever -- that they have

23

constructed, that the Government can require them to knock

24

it down and restore the site to its natural -- its natural

25

state.

That's section 9b of the standard contract and in

56
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the contract that it's in the joint appendix.

2

that's an indication that they're not interested really in

3

procuring the construction services.

4

in authorizing a concessioner to provide services to

5

visitors to the national parks.

6

So again,

They're interested

Finally, I think it's noteworthy that Congress

7

obviously knew that concessioners would be building

8

buildings under the 1998 act, which was enacted against

9

the backdrop of this regulation setting forth the Park

10

Service's consistently held view that concessions

11

contracts are not procurement contracts.

12

displacing that view, they actually seem to embrace it

13

both in the text of the act and in the legislative history

14

that Justice Breyer mentioned.

15

And far from

As far as the text of the act goes, I think it's

16

telling that -- the different types of language they use

17

for both the concessions side of the house and the

18

procurement side of the house.

19

they use distinct language that I don't think you're going

20

to find in any procurement statute anywhere.

21

saying procure or purchase, they say they -- the -- the

22

Park Service can authorize concessioners to provide

23

services, and it even specifies that the services will not

24

be provided to the Government.

25

to visitors, which is obviously very different from

On the concessions side,

Instead of

It says they're provided

57
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

procurement statutes, many of which specifically state

2

that the service will be provided to the agency.

3

QUESTION:

Maybe the Park Service wrote that

4

portion of the committee report.

5

MR. ELWOOD:

6

That -- Justice -- Justice

Scalia, that's the actual text of the statute.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. ELWOOD:

9

No.

Okay.
And by contrast with that, the

actual text of the procurement provisions of the 1998 --

10

section 5959, used typical procurement language and

11

specified that the Park Service will be benefitting from

12

it.

13

management consultant agreements whereby management

14

consultants provide services to assist the Secretary in

15

administering the program.

16

think in both ways.

17

It says that the -- that the service can enter into

So it's a contrast both -- I

Finally, one other thing that I think is telling

18

is that Congress specifically provided that some of the

19

most likely to arise disputes under the act, including

20

specifically franchise-free disputes, which I think people

21

would think would -- would arise frequently, would be

22

subject to mandatory arbitration.

23

thought there was an administrative remedy for this under

24

the CDA, I just don't think there would be any need for

25

them to provide for an -- a mandatory arbitral remedy.

And if Congress had

QUESTION:

Mr. Elwood, is the petitioner right

2

in saying that -- that when the Government sell goods --

3

sells goods, that comes under the CDA?
MR. ELWOOD:

4

That is correct.

Under 602(a)(4),

5

the -- when the Government disposes of property that is

6

not -- when the Government -- Government disposes of

7

personal property, those sales are covered by the CDA.

8

However, petitioner has never raised that theory in this

9

Court -- in any court.
QUESTION:

10
11

Those are not procurement contracts,

are they?
MR. ELWOOD:

12

No, but they -- they don't purport

13

to be.

14

always used in the clause for procurement of services,

15

procurement of construction, repair.

16

tacked on at the end basically because GSA at the time

17

subjected sales contracts to the same dispute clause, that

18

was problematic, that procurement contracts were.

19

that still -- in order to get coverage under the CDA under

20

petitioner's theory, they still must be a procurement

21

contract or must involve the procurement of services.

And -- and that was

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. GELLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

4

The complaint -- the complaint in this case was

5

filed under the authority of 28 U.S.C. 1491(b).

The Court

6

will find that at page 13 of the joint appendix.

7

that -- that statute provides for district court

8

jurisdiction to adjudicate challenges to the terms of

9

proposed Government contracts.

And

And I think if you look at

10

paragraph 62 and 114 of the joint -- of the complaint,

11

which is in the joint appendix, you'll see the allegations

12

that were made in the complaint to fall within that

13

provision of -- of title 28.

14

As to the substance of the CDA claim, the

15

Government makes much of the fact that no, quote,

16

Government funds were used here.

17

enough that that is a phrase that they've invented for the

18

purposes of this case.

19

concessioners received monies here from the visitors to

20

the national park, remit some of it to the NPS as a

21

franchise fee, and keep the rest of it.

22

contracts could just have easily been structured so that

23

the NPS got all the money in the first instance, kept some

24

of it as a franchise fee, and paid the rest of it back to

25

the concessioners.

And I cannot stress

It makes much of the fact that the

But these

And in fact, some Government

60
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

concessions contracts are written that way.

2

even the Government, I think, would have to concede that

3

Government funds were used.

4

coverage of the CDA, these important procedural and

5

substantive protections, turns on such flimsy

6

determinations as to who gets the money in the first

7

instance.

8

In that case,

We can't believe that the CDA

Now, secondly, we -- we've already talked about

9

the fact that so many services are being provided here

10

that are for the use and benefit of the Government, as

11

well as for the visitors of the national parks.

12

But I also want to point out that the Government

13

is the sole beneficiary of the contractual provisions in

14

virtually every concessions contract requiring the

15

construction, repair, and maintenance of facilities in the

16

national parks.

17

example, at page 96 of the joint appendix, which is a -- a

18

provision of the Grand Canyon contract that's in the

19

record, you'll see there that this contract -- under this

20

the contract, the NPS is there procuring maintenance,

21

repair, housekeeping, and groundskeeping for all

22

concessions facilities.

23

language of that -- of that procurement and compare it to

24

section 3(a)(3) of the CDA, which -- which provides that

25

CDA coverage for contracts for the procurement of

You know, if the Court will look, for

It seems to us if you look at the

61
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

construction or repair or maintenance of real property,

2

it's impossible to conclude, I think, that this

3

procurement contract doesn't fall within the CDA.

4

Thank you.
