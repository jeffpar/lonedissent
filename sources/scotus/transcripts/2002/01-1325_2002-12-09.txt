ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES FRIED

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. FRIED:

11

it please the Court:

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may

I wish to argue four propositions.

12

First, that

13

the interest in these IOLTA accounts is the private

14

property of Brown and Hayes, the clients.

15

was not regulated; it was taken.

16

value.

17

relief is an appropriate and practicable form of relief in

18

this case.

Second, that it

Third, that it has

And fourth, that an injunction or declaratory

19

Now --

20

QUESTION:

Before you start, Mr. Fried, may I

21

ask you one broad question?

22

with the conclusion of the dissent in the court of

23

appeals, which I don't think agreed with your fourth

24

point.

25

MR. FRIED:

No.

You don't agree, I take it,

I think we are entitled to a

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

declaration, or to an -- or an injunction just as was

2

received in Eastern -- in Eastern Enterprises, just as was

3

received in Hodel v. Irving, just as was received in

4

Nollan and Dolan.

5

we asked for declaratory or injunctive relief, so I think

6

that is available, and it is a practical and proper form

7

of relief in this case.
QUESTION:

8
9
10

And in our -- in our complaint filed,

The only point I was really want --

you -- you do not understand the dissenters in the Ninth
Circuit to have gone that far, though, do you?

11

MR. FRIED:

12

QUESTION:

13

To have held that you're entitled to

injunctive relief.
MR. FRIED:

14
15

How -- how far, Justice Stevens?

no, they did not.

They --

No, they did not.

QUESTION:

16

They did not go that far.

In fact, they specifically said this

17

equitable relief would not enjoin takings, but would

18

simply stop Washington Supreme Court from requiring the

19

LPO's to comply with the IOLTA rules.
MR. FRIED:

20

Well, if the injunctive relief,

21

which we asked for -- and here in the -- the complaint, I

22

believe, is on page 100 of the -- 100 of the joint

23

appendix.

24

in the -- in the joint appendix.

25

injunctive and declaratory relief in general.

I think it's on -- no, I'm sorry.

It's -- yes,

We ask specifically for

Now --

2

QUESTION:

3

standing to ask for injunctive relief in this case?
MR. FRIED:

4
5

QUESTION:

There's

But in the -- in the complaint was an

injunction sought on behalf of Brown and Hayes?
MR. FRIED:

8
9

Certainly Brown and Hayes.

a question whether Daugs and Maxwell do, but certain --

6
7

Mr. Fried, what plaintiffs have

general.

Yes.

An injunction was sought in

A general injunction was sought.

I'm sorry.

10

I'm not putting my hand on the -- on the section in the

11

complaint, but --

12
13

QUESTION:

I -- I thought it read to the

contrary, that it was on behalf of the LPOs.

14

MR. FRIED:

15

then finally -- yes.

16

joint appendix on page 30, we ask specifically that they

17

permanently enjoin the defendants.

18

So we asked for that relief, yes.

19
20

QUESTION:

It was on behalf of the LPOs, but
Thank you.

Now I have it.

In the

This is paragraph 3.

And -- and you ask for it now on

behalf of Brown and Hayes, not --

21

MR. FRIED:

We certainly do.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. FRIED:

24

and all parties in this case.

25

QUESTION:

-- on behalf of the foundation.
We -- we ask for it on behalf of any

Mr. Fried, the question that Justice

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Stevens raised, which I was then addressing, was not what

2

was in your complaint, but what was the position of the

3

dissenting judges in the Ninth Circuit.

4

that dissent -- so you are clearly asking for something

5

that the dissenters did not say you would be entitled to

6

when they said -MR. FRIED:

7

We are asking for more than the

8

dissenters would have given us.

9

Ginsburg.
QUESTION:

10
11

And I read from

Yes.

That is correct, Justice

They said the equitable relief

would not enjoin takings.
MR. FRIED:

12

Yes.

We are asking for more than

13

that.

14

this Court's precedents that where compensatory relief

15

would be impracticable, or is not contemplated in the

16

program, an injunction is -- is proper.

17

has on numerous occasions in very similar cases granted

18

injunctive relief.

19

We are asking for it because it's very clear on

QUESTION:

And this Court

You -- you mentioned your complaint,

20

and then we have this passage in the dissent.

21

the idea of an injunction of the takings -- when was that

22

squarely presented to any court?

23

that if you had presented it, that this is rather curious,

24

what we get in the dissent.

25

MR. FRIED:

When did

Because it would seem

It's been presented throughout,

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Justice Ginsburg, and in fact, in the Fifth Circuit case,

2

which is virtually identical to this case, not only was it

3

presented, but an injunction was granted.

4

injunction which we received -QUESTION:

5

And exactly the

If you just could tell me at what

6

point you made it clear to the court that you were seeking

7

not what is described here, that is, that the -- that the

8

injunction would be addressed to the compliance of the

9

LPO's with the IOLTA rules.
MR. FRIED:

10

I think that the -- I submit,

11

Justice Ginsburg, that that paragraph, which I have read

12

to you, makes that clear.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. FRIED:

But that paragraph -And in the summary -- and I'm -- I'm

15

informed that it was also made clear in our summary

16

judgment motion.

17

the complaint should have made them aware, but also were

18

well aware that we were seeking an injunction for all

19

parties in all respects.

20

the relief that was obtained in the Fifth Circuit case.

So that the courts were well aware, as

QUESTION:

21

And after all, that is precisely

Let -- let me see if I can help you

22

get to the other major parts of your case by asking this

23

question.

24
25

In Loretto, could the property owners have
obtained an injunction against piercing the building for

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the little antenna or the wire on the grounds that there

2

was no compensation?

3

government, after Loretto, would continue to be able to

4

poke the holes in -- in the wall -- or maybe I'm wrong --

5

even though compensation was negligible.

6

been an injunction there, and if the answer is, well, no,

7

why can there be an injunction here?

8

you to the --

9

MR. FRIED:

10

QUESTION:

11

I doubt it.

I would think the

Could there have

And maybe that gets

They --- the nature of the taking that

occurred in this case.
MR. FRIED:

12

The -- I think that's exactly the

13

reason.

If there were an -- if there is compensation in

14

this case, exactly as the Court said in Eastern

15

Enterprises, it would -- in effect, compensation being

16

dollar-for-dollar is the equivalent of shutting down the

17

program.

And that was the case in Webb's as well.
I -- I might just mention, Justice Kennedy, that

18
19

the respondents throughout this case say that the Eastern

20

Enterprises case, which is very important to our

21

injunctive claim, was really only a plurality.

22

not a majority for the Court.

23

fifth Justice, which was yourself, disagreed with the

24

remedy.

25

There was

I don't believe that the

And indeed, the fifth Justice said that this was

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

not a takings case -- Eastern Enterprise -- because unlike

2

this very case we have, this was not the -- the -- you

3

said, rather the exaction is a forced contribution to

4

general government revenues.

5

wrong -- I'm reading the wrong passage.

I'm sorry.

I'm reading the

In the Eastern -- Eastern Enterprises case, you

6
7

said that the reason -- the reason that you didn't think

8

that was a takings case was that a valuable interest in an

9

intangible or even a bank account or accrued interest,

10

which is, of course, this case, had not been appropriated.

11

Well, this is a bank account and accrued interest -QUESTION:

12

Well, what about my hypothetical on

13

Loretto?

I -- I take it Loretto establishes that there

14

was an invasion, a taking --

15

MR. FRIED:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- but let's -- let's assume that the

17

compensation was just so minimal it just really couldn't

18

be calculated.

19

have had an injunction against installation of the

20

antennas in Loretto on the ground that the compensation

21

can't be figured?

22

conclusion is right about that, how is your case

23

different?

24
25

It was 10 cents or something.

I think not.

MR. FRIED:

Could you

And if that's -- if my

My -- our case is different because

in this case, as in Webb's, as in Eastern Associates, to

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

give compensation is to simply erase the program.

2

in the case where physical property is taken, to give

3

compensation still leaves it open to use that property

4

while -- where what you have is money and you must make

5

compensation for that, then to make compensation for a

6

dollar is to pay a dollar.

7

Eastern Enterprises.
QUESTION:

8
9

While

That's what the Court said in

Why doesn't that just prove that you

have the wrong clause of the Constitution?

That is, your

10

clause of the Constitution, the one you're pushing, says,

11

nor shall private property be taken for public use without

12

just compensation.

13

property for public use, you just have to pay money for

14

it.

Foreseeing that you can take the

Just compensation.
Now, if paying the just compensation can't work

15
16

out, or it's too hard or, you know, the person doesn't

17

have enough of an interest to get anything, that doesn't

18

mean the government can't take it.

19

something wrong with it, it means that that that which is

20

wrong with it is that it violates the Due Process Clause,

21

not the Just Compensation Clause.
MR. FRIED:

22

It just -- if there's

That would be correct if Webb's had

23

been a due process case, but it was not.

It was a takings

24

case.

25

interest so long as you pay just compensation for it.

And in Webb's, they didn't say you can take that

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

They say, you've got to stop.

2

QUESTION:

Then the rationale -- you'd say

3

even -- I mean, occasionally some case does have something

4

that's a little hard to follow, but the -- the theory that

5

that is consistent with the Just Compensation Clause,

6

rather than the Due Process Clause, is?
MR. FRIED:

7

That it makes no sense.

8

that it's hard to calculate.

9

how you would calculate it.

It's not

We would be happy to argue
The point is that to

10

calculate it and to pay the just compensation is to shut

11

down the program.

12

left after you have paid just compensation.

It makes no sense.

QUESTION:

13

There's no program

Yes, but if -- if it is shown -- and

14

I guess we don't know here because it hasn't been

15

determined.

16

because it wouldn't have earned or produced anything, then

17

how is it a taking?

18

Clause refers to the taking without just compensation.

19

the compensation is 0, how is it a taking?
MR. FRIED:

20
21

I mean, that's -- because the Takings
If

The compensation is not 0, and the

premise of the -QUESTION:

22
23

If it is shown that no compensation is due

If.

If it were, how -- how is it a

taking?

24

MR. FRIED:

25

QUESTION:

If it were.

But the --

Well, then what is your answer?

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Is

1

it a taking if the just compensation is 0?
MR. FRIED:

2
3

It is a taking, but it is --

as the -- because this Court -QUESTION:

4
5

Yes.

How is it in -- in the language of

the clause?
MR. FRIED:

6

Because this Court in Phillips has

7

held that economic -- that -- that there is private

8

property and it has value even though it has no realizable

9

economic value.
But we do not concede that there is no economic

10
11

value here, and the fact that it could not have earned

12

interest -QUESTION:

13
14

But that has not been determined, has

it?
MR. FRIED:

15

Yes, it has.

It has been

16

determined.

17

respondents that there is interest in this case of $5

18

and $2.

19

IOLTA program, that would not have been earned.

20

Court in Webb's specifically addressed that point and

21

said, we accept the proposition that apart from the

22

statute, Florida law does not require that interest be --

23

be earned on registered deposits.

24

This is just another version of --

25

It has been determined and conceded by the

They go on to argue, ah, yes, but absent the

QUESTION:

This

So it was quite clear.

But weren't those gross figures

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

rather than net figures?
MR. FRIED:

2
3

Those --

Those are gross figures, yes,

Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

4

But can we assume, along with

5

Justice O'Connor's question, that there's no net loss to

6

the property owner?

7

the -- goes with the principal, and therefore it's

8

property, and property has been taken.

9

any net loss to the person from whom the property has been

10

We assume the -- the interest is

But has there been

taken?
MR. FRIED:

11

Perhaps and perhaps not.

12

that there has not.

13

matter.

14

is in -- involved here --

Let's say

I -- we argue that that does not

It is the gross -- it is the gross interest that

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. FRIED:

17

QUESTION:

Even if it had been --- and that is the point -Do you agree if it was a taking and

18

you were to get just compensation, you would get the net

19

loss rather than the gross loss?

20
21
22

MR. FRIED:

No.

We would get the gross loss.

I think the -QUESTION:

You -- you again, Mr. Fried, are

23

going quite beyond the position of the original panel,

24

later the dissenters in the Ninth Circuit, who made it

25

clear -- and this is on page 83a of the original panel

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

decision -- that said, just as a client is not entitled to

2

the full amount that a lawyer collects for him, but only

3

that amount less the lawyer's reasonable expenses and

4

fees, so just compensation for the interest taken by

5

IOLTA, after IOLTA causes the interest fund to exist, is

6

something less -- is something less -- than the amount of

7

the interest.

8
9
10

MR. FRIED:

That is what the dissent says.

We do not agree with that.
What we agree with is what this Court said in

11

Phillips when this Court said that -- and it used the

12

example of the rents -- the government may not seize rents

13

received by the owner of a building because it can prove

14

that the costs incurred in collecting the rents exceed the

15

amounts collected.

16

were correct, then that statement would be incorrect

17

because it would mean --

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. FRIED:

20
21

If the argument that's being made now

Well, isn't the difference --- that the government may seize

those rents.
QUESTION:

Isn't the difference, Mr. Fried, that

22

in the -- in the rent example, what the -- what the

23

members of the Court were assuming was that if somebody

24

wants to be a bad businessperson, he's perfectly free to

25

do it, and until he goes bankrupt, or loses the property,

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

he can collect the rent.
The situation here is different because the

3

situation here is such that there's nothing to collect.

4

The -- the way the background principles of the banking

5

statutes are set up, or -- which are effected by the

6

banking statutes means that the -- the rent, the penny,

7

the interest, never gets to the person who owns the

8

principal.

9

Phillips does not determine the result in this case?

10

And isn't that why -- isn't that exactly why

MR. FRIED:

I think not, Justice --

11

Justice Souter, because the Court in Phillips said

12

specifically this interest -- so it assumes there is --

13

this interest is the private property of the clients,

14

Brown and Hayes.

15

Court said.

16

disappear as their property because they would incur

17

expenses in collecting it.

18
19

It said that this is -- that's what this

It is their property.

QUESTION:

Now, it doesn't

Well, I may not be the -- the best

expert on what the -- what the majority meant by that.

20

(Laughter.)

21

QUESTION:

But I think thought what the majority

22

meant by that was that when you aggregate, as -- as is the

23

case in these IOLTA accounts, of course there is a

24

fractional sense that is attributable to every item

25

that -- a fractional sense of the interest that's

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

attributable to every item that goes into the aggregation,

2

but it doesn't follow from that that any of that

3

attributable amount could ever be netted out and ever be

4

received under the banking statutes by those individuals

5

to whom it is attributable.

6

other way, then the IOLTA scheme would force a separate

7

NOW account to have been set up.

8
9

MR. FRIED:

If, in fact, it were the

The -- the Court certainly did not

say that any of that interest could be netted out and paid

10

net to Brown and Hayes, but it did say, quite

11

unambiguously, that that interest -- not in some general

12

sense, but exactly that interest -- was the private

13

property of clients, Brown and Hayes.

14

Now --

15

QUESTION:

But was it taken from them?

So, I

16

mean, I -- I can see why you see Webb is very, very

17

similar, but the difference that I saw is that Webb says

18

the money should be deposited in an ordinary interest-

19

bearing account, and here it's being deposited in a -- in

20

an account that is really the creation of the government's

21

program that just couldn't have borne interest unless you

22

collect all these funds together.

23

program, the person couldn't have earned interest.

24
25

So without this

Now, has the government taken that?

If they

have taken it, then why didn't the government take it when

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

they -- when they tax it.

2

because it's very unreasonable.

3

a taking?

4

government has a currency reg that imposes certain

5

conditions upon the use of that interest?

10

Why wouldn't the government take it when the

Why isn't this

really a due process problem, not a takings problem?
MR. FRIED:

8
9

Why wouldn't that then be

I'm back to the same point.

6
7

Suppose the tax law was illegal

Well, that's a -- I mean, that is --

that is an argument which depends on traversing the
premise established by this Court in Webb's and Phillips.
QUESTION:

11

That's why I -- I said the difference

12

in Webb's is that in Webb's it's an ordinary interest-

13

bearing account.

14

without the IOLTA program coming in and saying we will put

15

funds together, and those funds could not have earned

16

interest on their own.

Here it's an account that is nonexistent

MR. FRIED:

17

Well, that is the argument that the

18

Solicitor General made in Phillips, that this is

19

government-created property, and it was rejected.
QUESTION:

20
21

respect to taking.
MR. FRIED:

22
23

And it was rejected by this Court.

It was rejected.
QUESTION:

MR. FRIED:

QUESTION:

It might very well.
If -- if the government let it, and

just because the government doesn't want to let it,

10

doesn't mean the government has a right to do it on its

own.

Isn't that your point, or isn't it --

MR. FRIED:

Well, that is -- that's one of the

14
15

but as a practical matter, computing the -- the various

payouts would -- would be so expensive that -- and the

payouts so small that it's just not practicable.

18

that --

19

MR. FRIED:

Isn't

If I could just address the

20

gross-versus-net point.

The interest to which we are

21

entitled, to which the clients are entitled, is -- it was

22

calculated by respondents -- $5 and $2.

23

amount to which they are entitled.

24

along the way, the accountants will say, fine, and we'd

like $3.50 of that, and the lawyers may say, fine, and we

And it may well be that at the

end of the day they don't have any money.

of the government's business.

QUESTION:

That's not any

But that -- that was not the position

5

that any judge has brought so far because the original

panel that held in your favor said, yes -- and I don't

want to repeat myself, but something less.

something less than the amount of interest.

It would be

I have a question that -- that's puzzling me

9
10

about this theoretically we could have it separate.

11

I thought that the program can only work, as far as the

12

tax law is concerned, if the client has no control over

13

the disposition of --

14

MR. FRIED:

That is correct.

15

QUESTION:

-- that interest.

If the client has

16

control, then it's taxable to the -- then it -- interest

17

like any other interest would be taxable.
So, here, the IOLTA has this peculiar aspect to

19

it.

You can it's interest belonging to the client, but

20

that client has no right to dispose of it as long as it's

going to be nontaxable income.

MR. FRIED:

The client has a right to dispose of

23

it, but -- or ought to have a right, under the

24

Constitution, has a right to dispose of it --

its way down to the -- to the clients, but I don't need to

make that argument.

QUESTION:

Why -- why don't you, though, have to

make exactly the same argument if IOLTA goes down the

drain -- compulsory IOLTA goes down the drain on your

theory?

23

about the -- the background government regulation which,

in effect, gives the interest to the bank?

Why don't you have to make the same argument

MR. FRIED:

It doesn't give the interest to the

You can't pay out interest on a straight checking

Therefore, in effect, you get to keep it.

MR. FRIED:

Well, the -And the -- the effect of that, it

seems to me, is just as much to deprive your client of the

deprive it when it says IOLTA gets it instead of the bank.

12

MR. FRIED:

Yes.
Except your -- your client is not

any money in the bank, is he?

MR. FRIED:

No, it is not.

But in no instance -- either the IOLTA case, or the

I would like to start with the question that

Justice O'Connor posed because I think it goes to the

heart of the flaw in plaintiffs' case.

cause of action which is that they show that there was

just compensation due and denied by the State of

8

Washington.

9

There is an

That has not happened here.

QUESTION:

So the position of the State of

10

Washington is that it can take any property so long as it

11

doesn't have -- so long as compensation can't be

12

calculated.

13

MR. BURMAN:

No.

The position is that there is

14

no unconstitutional taking if we would pay compensation.

15

Certainly the -- the plain language of the clause says the

16

property may be taken.

17

QUESTION:

Doesn't -- doesn't the State have

18

some duty to recognize that the Constitution protects

19

property and it shouldn't take property that doesn't

MR. BURMAN:

In certain circumstances, the Just

Compensation Clause acts a shield.

what we look at, because the Just Compensation Clause is a

2

type of indemnity provision that is worried about

3

responding with -- to loss of pecuniary or monetary

4

value -- the Court in the parcel aggregation cases, such

5

as Boston Chamber and Sage, made it very clear that if it

aggregation would exceed the benefit, there is no just

compensation.

MR. BURMAN:

Answering the question of whether

the question of whether there is just compensation.

Constitution here.

And you say that simply because it

can't be computed, A, because of the small amounts, and B,

because of the government's unique program, that it is not

14

MR. BURMAN:

And the difference is what is

unique about the government's program and what Boston

9

This arose out of a

I don't care if there's a regulatory

10

purpose or not.

I mean, that -- that may go to some

11

other -- some other element, but as -- as to whether

12

you've taken my property, the interest was paid because of

13

my $5,000, and then you come back and say, oh, yeah, but

14

you wouldn't have gotten that much because you wouldn't

15

have been -- well, that's true.

16

fact is I was in with those other people and I did get

17

them more money, and that more money is mine.
MR. BURMAN:

18

I wouldn't have, but the

And -- and they should present that

19

argument.

It may well be that they could come up with a

20

scheme that would reduce the transaction costs and create

21

a net value, and the plain language of the rule says if

22

that happens, the lawyer has to honor it.

23

QUESTION:

They're -- they're arguing --

24

MR. BURMAN:

25

QUESTION:

It is the lawyer's obligation.
All right.

I think they're saying, I

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

agreed with you.

You know, I agreed with you.

But I

2

wrote a dissent.

So they're saying that was a dissent.

3

You lost.

4

this is property.

Now, it is the law of the United States that
Indeed, it is their clients' property.

Now, you tell me on that assumption, since I

5
6

lost, why is it not a taking of that property for which

7

they are entitled to just compensation, and, in this case,

8

the just compensation would have to take the form of an

9

injunction.

Now, unless -- I'm -- I'm anxious to hear the

10

answer to that point.

11

MR. BURMAN:

You lost only on the question of

12

whether the majority should have looked at those

13

additional elements.

14

we express no opinion.

15

questions.

16

follows automatically from what the majority said, but

clearly that's not the case.

MR. BURMAN:

The majority was very clear to say
We state no view on these other

That would be nonsensical if in fact it

Good.

So tell me why it doesn't.

With respect to the injunction

20

question, if I could jump ahead to -- to that part of your

21

hypothetical, Eastern Enterprises, we believe, is a

22

different situation where, as in the Youpee case, the

23

Court basically said Congress could not have intended this

24

circularity, and so we are not going to read the statute

25

that way.

This is different when you have the State, and

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

it's different where, even the dissenters in the Ninth

2

Circuit below admitted that the amount due, if any, is

3

going to be smaller than the gross interest.

4

such as Webb's, in cases such as Sperry, even in Phillips,

5

the Court seemed to acknowledge that the deduction made

6

sense.
QUESTION:

7
8

In cases

But Justice Breyer's question I think

was, is there or is there not a taking of property here?
MR. BURMAN:

9

There is property.

We believe

10

there is no taking, and Mr. Dellinger will address that

11

perhaps more directly than I will.
QUESTION:

12

How -- how would you define what's

13

happened to the property?

14

existence?
MR. BURMAN:

15
16

19

It's been regulated out of

The property was transferred, just

as in Connolly, just as in Eastern Enterprises.
QUESTION:

17
18

But it is --

Oh, it's been transferred but not

taken.
MR. BURMAN:

Correct.

It has not been taken by

20

applying the multi-factor test that the Court says applies

21

when you have a transfer of dollars, which is what

22

happened in those cases.

23

these plaintiffs admit no investment expectation, no net

24

economic loss.

25

QUESTION:

And when you apply that test,

It -- it seems to me an odd rule that

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

it's not a right of the owner to decide to whom the owner

2

can transfer the property.
MR. BURMAN:

3

These owners transferred the

4

property to an intermediary on its way to a third party.

5

It would be a really odd rule if somehow the right to

6

exclude was independent of the economic value of money.

7

Just as interest may follow principal, it would make sense

8

that the right to exclude has to follow the economic value

when you send it to an -QUESTION:

10

Mr. Burman, let me ask you something

as a practical matter.

12

and concluded there was a taking and they were entitled to

13

some relief, can the problem be solved by simply adding a

14

little explanatory provision in the proposed escrow

16

combined account, you can do something else with it?

If the Court disagreed with you

account.
MR. BURMAN:

it, is that if you give the client the right to opt out,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

JUSTICES OF THE SUPREME COURT OF WASHINGTON
MR. DELLINGER:

15
16

Thank you, Mr. Burman.

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:
To establish a violation of the Just

17
18

Compensation Clause, let's remember there have to be three

19

elements.

There has to be property -- established by

20

Phillips.

There has to be a taking in the constitutional

21

sense, and there has to be a denial by the State of just

22

compensation.

23

Mr. Burman has suggested why that is missing in

24

this case because there has been no just compensation

25

that's denied.

The justices of the Washington Supreme --

1

QUESTION:

Well, but -- but that's the issue

2

before us.

3

that if just compensation can't be calculated, the

4

government is free to take someone's property for itself.

5

And -- and I'm just baffled by what that principle might

6

be.

7

I'm just not sure of a precedent which says

MR. DELLINGER:

Justice Kennedy, it is a taking

8

when the government takes your property without a

9

sufficient regulatory basis.

And the compensation they

10

owe you, if it is zero, and zero is paid, there is no

11

violation.

12

founding generation was so wedded to rights of property,

13

but the Fifth Amendment expressly confirms the authority

14

of government to take property for public purposes, State,

15

local, and National.

16

I know it is somewhat surprising since the

They have to pay just compensation.

If they take $1 million of your property and pay

17

you $999,000, they've violated the clause.

18

your property is worth $10, and they pay you $10, they

19

haven't violated.

20

worth zero, then they owe you nothing.

21

no violation of the Fifth Amendment.

22

If they -- if

There's no denial,

Professor Fried would say in that instance, if

23

the value declines from $10 to zero, you enjoin them from

That's not the answer.

The answer is that the

My answer is that --

I mean, so long as the government

sets it up that way and I couldn't make any more money,

23

the money that the government makes on my money is the

government's.

MR. DELLINGER:

Yes, because this Court's cases

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

make it clear, Justice Scalia, that the amount of just

2

compensation that is due is the amount of your loss.

3

if your loss is zero, there's no denial of just

4

compensation.
QUESTION:

5

And

I don't think the cases make clear

7

MR. DELLINGER:

That's --

That is not the formulation.

8

The -- the funds have to be taken from the bank.

They

9

can't remain with the bank because of the serious ethical

10

problem that was noted in the briefing to the justices

that the banks are earning interest and providing benefits

to the very lawyers, or in the case the real estate escrow

13

agents who placed the money there.

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

the funds go, the interest would be attributable to the

client.

And secondly, if you --

4

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose if the client

5

designated a charity, that would be a charitable

6

deduction.

Maybe or maybe not.

MR. DELLINGER:

7

That's correct.

It -- it --

8

I think that goes to the right to control, and the

9

government often regulates the right to control one's

10

property, particularly in a heavy -- heavily regulated

11

industry such as banking.
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Dellinger, in -- in that --

13

I want to get clear on that example.

14

designation, leaving the tax consequence aside, isn't --

15

isn't it true on the facts under the Washington scheme

16

that the cost of identifying the amount that would go to

17

the charity would be greater than that amount so that, in

18

effect, ultimately the -- the charity would net nothing,

19

there would be no tax, a tax return would have to be filed

20

saying zero.

22
23

Is -- is that right?

MR. DELLINGER:

21

If there were such a

That is -- that is precisely

right.
Now, if you -- if you choose to have a law firm

24

do your transaction, but the client says, I want some

25

other escrow agent, and not the lawyer, then you don't get

1

into IOLTA.
But here, I think we have a dispositive flaw in

2
3

that there is simply no just compensation.

And the reason

4

there is no compensation is that it's actually quite

5

complicated to track and allocate all of these funds.

6

It may seem counterintuitive that you can't allocate that

7

interest back.

8

I think, footnote 2 of the -- of the brief of 49 State

9

bars, in Texas, where they made $5.5 million, it was on

But in Texas, for example, if you look at,

10

40,000 attorneys' trust accounts that may have had as many

11

as 1 million discrete deposits.

12

that -- and there's somehow you can allocate it back, you

13

do so.

14

Now, the --

1

There are really five different ways that we

2

could win this case, just -- because there are so many

3

pieces on the gameboard.
You could conclude that it's not a taking

4
5

principally because it has a valid regulatory purpose.

6

It's not -- two, it's not a taking because of

7

the absence of any real investment-backed expectations.
Three, even if it's a taking, we've established

8
9

that zero compensation is due.
Four, even if you think some compensation might

10
11

be due, they've never gone to the State -- not a single

12

client -- and tried to prove up the amount of

13

compensation, which is very much in dispute if you look at

14

their earnings credit analysis, unlike Eastern Enterprises

15

where we knew the exact amount, it's very much in dispute

16

whether some or all of those costs would have been borne

17

down.

18

And finally, even if you reject all our other

19

positions, you then reach an argument that we don't need

20

to make because we believe in our other arguments, and

21

that is, why not treat this as a valid revenue measure?

22

Unlike the bad revenue measures of Eastern Enterprises,

23

where the State, or the Government was imposing a

24

retroactive onerous burden on a few identifiable, known

25

people, here it's prospective, reasonably broadly based,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES FRIED

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

3

MR. FRIED:

Thank you, Justice Stevens.

4

Just a few points.
It is not a tax.

First, this is not a revenue

5

measure.

It has never been argued to be

6

a tax.

made, the dog-in-the-manger argument that was made in the

9

court below, and the argument made by AARP, that if the

government wants our money, they should get it the

11

old-fashioned way.

12

They should tax.

Now, the court said, and AARP said, it's

13

inconvenient to tax because that comes with strings.

14

That's called democracy.

15

And so the bar association and the justices wish to

16

acquire the money.

17

QUESTION:

They don't like the strings.

May I -- I shouldn't be taking your

18

rebuttal time, Mr. Fried, but are you saying that if they

19

did this by a statute, it would be perfectly okay?

20
21

MR. FRIED:

QUESTION:

23

MR. FRIED:

25

I'm saying

that if they did it as a --

No, I'm not saying that.

-- as part of the revenue code.
-- as a tax -- if they did it as a

tax because it -QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me the program was

exactly the same, it was adopted by a legislature, and had

2

the title tax on it.

3

MR. FRIED:

Because in every jurisdiction and

4

certainly in the Federal Government, taxes have to jump

5

over certain hoops.

6

and it's exactly those constraints that the justices and

7

the bar associations want to escape.

8

so.

There are institutional constraints,

They have told us

It's all -QUESTION:

11

permissible?

If they did exactly what I said, would it be

MR. FRIED:

12

I'm not sure I know the answer to my

It would be an entirely different

13

question.

14

a different question, and a harder one because this Court

15

has granted greater leeway to tax, and the reason it has

16

is because taxation is a recognized institutional form

17

with lots of institutional hurdles that the respondents do

18

not wish to endure.

19

around them.

20

I wouldn't want to concede it, but it would be

They wish to do -- do an end run

Now, as to the regulatory purpose here, I think

21

it's sufficient to note that prior to IOLTA, there were

22

plenty of regulations -- both of escrow agents and

23

lawyers -- to prevent them from self-dealing, and lawyers

24

were disbarred if they violated them.

25

was passed, and it was passed only as a way to raise funds

This IOLTA measure

for legal services.

So I think that the regulatory

2

purpose is an after-the-fact invention.
Now, also we do not say that it is impossible to

It's $5 and $2.

It's perfectly

It's simply impracticable to

We do not say

Mr. Fried, may I ask you another

11

question that is troubling me about this, in addition to

12

the question of is it really the bank whose -- whose

13

economic gain has been taken?

14

about the -- the class sets involved.

15

isn't a class action, but the injunction is going to be to

16

cover everyone in this group.

17

outraged by this and others may say, we'd much rather that

18

IOLTA get it than the bank.

19

troubling about an injunction that's going to cover all of

20

these people who may have very diverse views about what

21

they would like to see happen.

22

MR. FRIED:

But this is a question
Now, I know this

And some of them may be

So there's something

Yes, and the solution for that is

23

the political process rather than the process of judges

24

and bar associations raising revenue.

It should not happen here.
QUESTION:

I'm not sure I understand that

answer.

some of the people say we don't want to prefer the bank,

we want to prefer IOLTA.

because we're enjoining it.

8

If the choice is between the banks and IOLTA, and

MR. FRIED:

You're -- you're making the

Well, we're enjoining it -- we are

9

asking you to enjoin it because it is an illegal program.

10

The result of the injunction, or a -- a declaration would

11

be what you described.

QUESTION:

Mr. Fried, you may have another

minute if you didn't get your rebuttal through.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
