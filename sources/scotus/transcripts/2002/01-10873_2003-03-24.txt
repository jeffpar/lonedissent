CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

United States and a companion case.

Mr. Green.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. GREEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

The issue in this case is whether the

12

participation of a non-Article III judge on an improperly

13

constituted panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals

14

renders the decision of that panel void.

15

The parties are in agreement that the

16

designation of Judge Munson, who sits for a 10-year term

17

on the Ninth Circuit panel, violated the statute

18

pertaining to designations.

19

work than simply govern designations.

20

protects the Article III character of the circuit courts

21

of appeals by ensuring that only Article III judges are

22

designated to sit on the Circuit courts of appeals.

23

QUESTION:

But that statute does more
That statute

Counsel, may I ask you, in this case, is

24

it possible that a quorum of the court would consist of

25

two members of a three-member panel on the court of

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

appeals?
MR. GREEN:

2

Yes.

A properly constituted

3

quorum -- or a quorum of a properly constituted panel

4

could -- could be two members.

5

Justice O'Connor, is with the participation of a judge

6

who, with all due respect, had no business being there in

7

the first place.
QUESTION:

8
9

Right.

But our objection here,

Even -- even though the panel

was unanimous.

10

MR. GREEN:

11

QUESTION:

Even though the panel was unanimous.
Now, if -- if we were to agree with

12

you and it went back, could the same two remaining judges

13

constitute a properly arranged panel and decide the case

14

again?
MR. GREEN:

15

No, for -- for two reasons.

16

Principally because the rules that govern quorum call for

17

a -- a two-member panel rather than a three-member panel

18

when there's some emergency that's certified or when

19

there's a disqualification or recusal.

20

there -QUESTION:

21
22
23

So I -- I think

The same two could be on a new panel,

however.
MR. GREEN:

I would maintain not in this case

24

for the simple reason that it appears that there has been

25

some participation in the preparation of respondent's

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

brief by the Chief Judge, as well as Judge Goodwin.

2

would maintain, given that involvement, it would be best

3

to send this back to a newly constituted and

4

properly constituted --

5
6
7

QUESTION:
be waived?

So we

Is this -- is this a right that can

No objection was made to this.

MR. GREEN:

It is a right that can be waived,

8

Justice O'Connor.

There's -- there -- that's -- that I

9

think is beyond peradventure.

But I don't think there was

10

waiver here because there's no record evidence that

11

indicates that there was a waiver.

12

v. Hill, for example, found a waiver --

This Court in New York

13

QUESTION:

There was no objection.

14

QUESTION:

I'm surprised you say that there can

So the Ninth Circuit could routinely send

15

be a waiver.

16

out to its litigants a waiver notice waiving participation

17

of non-Article III personnel and there would be no

18

structural objection?

19

MR. GREEN:

20

QUESTION:

I -- I thought -Well, I think --

I thought the whole point of -- of

21

your -- of your error analysis is this affects the

22

structural integrity of the court and it can't be waived.

23

MR. GREEN:

Well, the additional point I was

24

going to make in response to Justice O'Connor's question

25

is that, in fact, even though there may be consent or even

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

though there may be waiver, that has not stopped this

2

Court from considering these important structural

3

limitations in the past.
QUESTION:

4

Well, but what -- what is your

5

position?

Can the right be waived or not?

6

if you say the right can be waived, then it's just a

7

question of whether or not they knew or should have known

8

or something like that.
MR. GREEN:

9

I mean, if --

I think that the decision is void,

10

and so the position -- the position would be that although

11

all Article III provisions can be waived, in this instance

12

because of the nature of the structural error, the consent

13

or the waiver would not matter at all.
QUESTION:

14

Well, then -- then your -- counsel

15

could have appeared in the Ninth Circuit fully aware that

16

Judge Munson was sitting, go all the way through the

17

argument and the briefing, never mentioning a word about

18

it, and still the counsel would have the ability to void

19

the thing later.
MR. GREEN:

20
21

correct.

I -- I think that's -- that's

I think that would be the necessary consequence.
QUESTION:

And not to void if he -- if he won.

24

QUESTION:

And not to void it if he won.

25

QUESTION:

That's a nice position to be in.

22
23

Right?

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

You

1

just sit there, don't make any objection.

2

case, everything is fine, and if you lose the case, you

3

play dog in the manger and -- and come up here and say,

4

oop, this was an improper panel.

5

the -- the -- like the way the system ought to work.

6

MR. GREEN:

If you win the

That doesn't sound to me

But, Justice Scalia, I think that

7

relies upon counsel in that situation being confident that

8

this Court would grant a writ of certiorari.

9

think that that kind of gamesmanship is really quite

I -- I

10

far-fetched.

This Court does not sit as a court of

11

errors.

12

be error below, I would still have to -- I would have to

13

be relying on the -- the equivalent of legal lightning

14

striking, so to speak, in order to -- to be certain that

15

that error would be corrected.

16

QUESTION:

So even though I as counsel know that that might

Mr. Green, how does Article III --

17

how can Article III be claimed by your client who was

18

tried not before an Article III court, before a

19

territorial court -- your client has no entitlement to an

20

Article III court.

21

abstract question about the proper composition of a Ninth

22

Circuit panel.

23

entitlement to an Article III tribunal either at trial or

24

on appeal.

25

whether your clients are positioned to raise the proper

So this seems -- you're addressing an

Yet, your litigant, your client has no

So I think that there's a serious problem of

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

composition of an Article III court when they are not even

2

entitled to an Article III court.
MR. GREEN:

3

That is true as a general matter at

4

the trial court stage.

5

position here -- and I would disagree with the premise

6

only insofar as you said as to the court of appeals.

7

Congress vested jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.,

8

section 1291, over appeals from the territories in the

9

United States Circuit Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:

10

However, it -- it's very much our

Yes, but it didn't have to.

In other

11

words, a case -- an Article III -- a case in which

12

litigants are entitled to an Article III tribunal then

13

must go to an Article III court.

14

designate the Ninth Circuit to hear these appeals from

15

non-Article III trial courts.

16

Congress didn't have to do that with respect to your

17

clients.

18

appellate tribunal and that would have been okay.

19

Here Congress did

But your clients --

Congress could have given them an Article IV

MR. GREEN:

No.

I -- When Congress vests

20

jurisdiction in the United States courts of appeals, it

21

does so not only to its -- in accordance not only with its

22

plenary power over the territories under Article IV, but

23

also pursuant to Article III.

24

inferior court and creates a jurisdiction in those courts,

25

we would maintain that -- that Congress is acting pursuant

When Congress creates any

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

to Article III.

And in this instance --

QUESTION:

But when Congress created the

3

district court for the Northern Marianas, for Guam, what

4

authority was it exercising?

5
6
7

MR. GREEN:

It was -- it was exercising its

plenary authority pursuant to Article IV.
QUESTION:

I -- I assume you've got a -- maybe

8

I'm wrong, but I assume you've got a fall-back and that

9

is, okay, if you don't accept -- we don't accept the

10

constitutional position, you're still claiming that you

11

have a legal entitlement to the Ninth Circuit and, hence,

12

to a completely Article III court.

13

MR. GREEN:

That -- that's exactly correct.

14

QUESTION:

And that could be true if Congress

15
16

was acting under -- under Article IV.
MR. GREEN:

That -- that's correct.

Even if

17

Congress was acting under Article IV, the statute plainly

18

vests jurisdiction, and it -- and it provides for

19

independent -- independent review of these appeals by an

20

Article III court.

21

To -- to -- as respondent suggests, to -- to

22

argue that a panel of the court of appeals could be

23

specially constituted for these appeals would rewrite

24

section 1291.

25

jurisdiction shall vest in the court of appeals.

Section 1291 says in very plain terms that

Alderson Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Green, suppose -- suppose I

2

disagree with you that -- that you -- you can sit through

3

a trial and not object with -- with impunity, and -- and I

4

think that you lose here unless you can show plain error

5

and the usual requirements for avoiding the rule about --

6

about contemporaneous objection.

7

the plain error requirements and, in particular, the

8

requirement that -- that there have -- that -- that the

9

mistake seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or

Why do you come within

10

public reputation of judicial proceedings?

11

that the case?

12

Why -- why is

You acknowledge that your client could have been

13

tried by non-Article III judges.

14

judge who sat, although he was non-Article III, was a

15

Federal judge properly appointed.

16

your client.

17

proceeding -- yes, there was a -- there was a mistake, but

18

did -- was it -- was it a mistake that seriously affected

19

the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the

20

proceeding?

21
22
23

You acknowledge that the

He could have tried

So how can I say that this -- that the

I -- I just don't see that.

MR. GREEN:

In the following senses, Justice

Scalia, it did affect it.
First of all, with respect to fairness, the

24

Ninth Circuit is -- is a court of fully independent

25

review, and I would maintain that precisely because the

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

petitioners here were tried by an Article IV court, it

2

makes sense, and it may actually be constitutionally

3

required that in some sense their -- their appellate

4

review is had by an Article III court.

5

But in any event, Congress statutorily vested

6

jurisdiction in a fully independent Article III court, and

7

as a result of doing so, to put Judge Munson who sits for

8

a 10-year term on a panel as a co-equal participant would

9

affect the fairness of the court.

10

QUESTION:

We have a unique --

Suppose the panel had included a

11

judge who was holding a recess appointment, a Federal

12

judge who was appointed on a recess basis and therefore at

13

that point didn't have secure tenure?

14

MR. GREEN:

I -- I think there would be issues

15

of -- of qualification there, and there might even be --

16

where a -- a recess appointment was -- was held in a -- in

17

a qualified sense, then I would say that was an

18

Article III -- an Article III qualification for an

19

Article III court potentially.

20

to the qualification, we might be in the realm of the

21

de facto officer doctrine.

22

QUESTION:

If there were issues as

But Justice Scalia's question, at

23

least as I understood it, I think meant for you to

24

concentrate on why -- why this would bring the

25

administration of justice into disrepute, so to speak.

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. GREEN:

2

QUESTION:

Well -You -- you make your argument that

3

this was improper, what was done, and the Government

4

agrees.

5

plain error.

6

But there's an additional requirement here under

MR. GREEN:

Yes, and -- and I would add to my

7

response to Justice Scalia that we have an amicus brief

8

here from Judge Moore who sits in precisely the same seat,

9

so to speak, that Judge Munson sits as a territorial judge

10

in the Virgin Islands.

11

points out very plainly that he views himself as open to

12

question with regard to his impartiality because he is

13

subject to the hostile treatment -- to use Justice

14

Douglas' phraseology, the hostile treatment of the press

15

and the -- and the glowering disfavor of those who have in

16

their hands the power of reappointment.

17

QUESTION:

The amicus brief of Judge Moore

Gee, he -- he should resign if he

18

feels that way, it seems to me.

19

[Laughter.]

20

MR. GREEN:

21

He wants -- he -- he prefers that

you convert him to an Article III judge, so --

22

[Laughter.]

23

QUESTION:

I'm sure he does.

24

QUESTION:

I mean, you -- you have a -- a

25

statutory argument.

I'm sure he does.

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. GREEN:

2

QUESTION:

3

Yes.
And you have a constitutional

argument.

4

MR. GREEN:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.
All right.

Let's assume away the

6

statutory argument for the moment.

There you have the

7

problem -- you're -- you're right that it's contrary to

8

the statute, but maybe it isn't plain error.

9

only on the constitutional argument, and from the point of

I'm focusing

10

view of the constitutional argument, I would like you to

11

assume the statute says the opposite.

12

that this judge can sit.

13

All right.

The statute says

So purposes of a constitutional

14

argument, why can't your party waive -- why can't your

15

clients have waived that?

16

we're just considering a case in which -- a different case

17

in which it's at least arguable -- there are two sides to

18

the argument -- whether two parties can get together and

19

have a magistrate, who is not an Article III judge, try

20

their case.

21

they went ahead without objection.

22

the statute, but for present purposes, we're assuming the

23

opposite statute.

24
25

My particular thought is that

The consent simply consisting of the fact
In that case, there's

So I mean, if it's at least arguable that you
could have consent, shown only by the fact they went ahead

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

to a trial before a magistrate and that would be enough to

2

validate constitutionally the magistrate trying the case,

3

why isn't the fact that you went ahead here

4

constitutionally sufficient to show that you agreed to the

5

trial before -- the -- the appeal that included one judge

6

from Guam?
MR. GREEN:

7

Because this Court has -- has said

8

that the claims of structural validity, claims that go to

9

the very validity of the tribunal itself, are claims which

10

invoke institutional interests, not just personal

11

interests -QUESTION:

12

Now, I understand that, but my

13

question is, how is that any more true or less true where

14

what they've done is consent through behavior to trial of

15

a case before a magistrate?
MR. GREEN:

16

Well, this Court has never -- this

17

Court has never addressed the question of whether you can

18

have --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. GREEN:

21

QUESTION:

22

-- a trial --- through consent are

unconstitutional?

23

MR. GREEN:

24

QUESTION:

25

You think that magistrate trials --

interrupt you.

I'm sorry?
No, no.

Sorry.

I didn't mean to

I jumped ahead to -- thinking what you

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

were going to say before listening to what you were going

2

to say.

3

[Laughter.]

4

QUESTION:

5

to say.

6

MR. GREEN:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. GREEN:

9

And I want to hear what you're going

I do that sometimes too.
My fault.
The Court has -- the Court has never

before held that it would be permissible for a -- or for a

10

magistrate to conduct a full trial.

11

maintain because that also might affect institutional

12

interests could also not be subject to waiver or consent.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. GREEN:

15
16

And that I would

So are you saying -That's -- that argument is

certainly -QUESTION:

-- if we agree with you then, if we

17

agree with you that consent through behavior is not good

18

enough constitutionally, we would also be saying it is

19

unconstitutional to have consent to a trial before a

20

magistrate.

21

going to say yes to that, that's a problem.

22

You see, that's quite a -- a -- if you're

MR. GREEN:

No, I -- I understand that.

But

23

again, I'm -- I'm going to go to the dividing line between

24

Article III interests and Appointments Clause interests

25

and those structural limitations and structural

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

protections in the court system which are not quite the

2

same as the kind of structural trial errors that this

3

Court has addressed in -- in Gomez, that this Court

4

addressed last term in Cotton.

5

that go to the validity of the claim, not necessarily to

6

the validity of the -- or to the very validity of the

7

institutional interests.

8
9

Those really are errors

I think the hypothetical that you posit is
actually Glidden, and in Glidden, this Court held that

10

even where the designation of the judges from the Court of

11

Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals was

12

lawful in that sense, the Court took pains to look and see

13

whether the courts from which those judges were designated

14

were Article III courts.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Well, Glidden -- really there was

no -- no opinion for the Court in that case.
MR. GREEN:

No, there wasn't, but the Chief

18

Justice and Justice Clark in that case concurred in the

19

result, and the difference that they had with the majority

20

was that they didn't think that Bakelite and Williams

21

should be deemed overruled, only that they had been

22

superseded by subsequent events, including the grant of

23

lifetime tenure to the judges on the Court of Claims and

24

to the -- to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.

25

QUESTION:

But they -- they didn't join the

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

opinion, did they, of Justice -MR. GREEN:

No.

No, they did not.

But I -- I

3

would maintain that there was a -- a majority of five on a

4

seven-member Court because two of the Justices had recused

5

themselves.

6

A majority of five.

QUESTION:

In the Government's brief, they

7

mention a conversation with the Chief Judge of the Ninth

8

Circuit by a former lawyer for your client.

9

to know, A, whether you disagree with what is said, and B,

10
11

I'm curious

how did they get in -- how does that get before us?
MR. GREEN:

I can't answer the second question.

12

To be frank, I'd like to know the answer to the second

13

question as well.

14

But as to the first question, I really would

15

start with the proposition that I don't think it matters.

16

I -- I don't think it matters here.

17

even as reported by respondents, would not in -- in my

18

mind and in our position constitute a waiver or consent.

19

The issue of who hears your appeal is probably so

20

important that it's necessary that that be done somehow in

21

the defendant's presence.

22

The conversation,

Respondent relies on Olano.

In Olano, the Court

23

took pains to point out that the defendants were present

24

when the discussions of whether the -- the alternate

25

jurors could deliberate or not.

Here I would say this

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

is -- this would be the same sort of issue subject to the

2

same sort of waiver and consent requirements.
QUESTION:

3

That's odd in a -- in a circuit that

4

has the vast majority of its appeals decided without any

5

oral argument.

6

there?

You said that the defendant has to be

Your party has to be there?
MR. GREEN:

7

I think for -- he doesn't have to be

8

there, but there would have to be some indication on -- on

9

the record, in addition to the conversation that -- that

10

respondents recite, that -- that Petitioner Nguyen

11

understood that there was -- that -- that she was waiving

12

some important right to a fully independent review by an

13

Article III court.
And I want to stress, as I say that, that --

14
15

that this claim that respondents make with respect to

16

waiver and consent really affects only one of the

17

petitioners here.

18

MR. GREEN:

But even if she had only a statutory

4

right in that sense, it's -- it is the case that Congress

5

creates jurisdiction and creates the inferior courts

6

pursuant to Article III under a statute.

7

mean that constitutional protections and constitutional

rights don't attend the statutory grants of jurisdiction

and -- and the activities of the courts that are created

There are numerous examples of -- of pure

statutory rights.

Let's take, for example, the right to

That is merely a statutory right.

QUESTION:

15

This Court has

Yes, but ordinarily statutory rights

16

can be forfeited if you don't assert them at the earliest

17

time when you reasonably could.

18

MR. GREEN:

19
20

That is -- that is true.

But

here -QUESTION:

And I'm not using the word waiver.

21

It's not a question of a person consenting, but forfeiting

22

by not raising it at the earliest reasonable stage.

23

MR. GREEN:

That is true, but this Court has

24

held in cases that involve similar Article III issues and

25

similar issues of the Appointments Clause that -- that

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

issues of consent and waiver are not dispositive.

2

fortiori then, I think issues of forfeiture would not be

dispositive.
QUESTION:

A

I have one question on the merits I'd

5

like to ask you.

Let's assume we get to the merits of a

6

constitutional question.

7

the statute says, the Ninth Circuit shall travel to Guam

8

and hear appeals and for purposes of this -- for purposes

9

of this voyage to Guam to hear the appeal, the make-up of

10

the panel will be two Article III judges and one Article I

11

judge.

All right?

I assume for that purpose that

That's the statute.

Now, why is that unconstitutional?

12

I cannot --

13

it's very unusual, but I cannot think of any due process

14

right of any Guam person who would be hurt, and I cannot

15

think of -- why it's wrong to ask an Article III judge to

16

take on this additional adjudicatory function with an

17

Article I judge sitting next to him.

answer that -- that we would give as to -- as to our

says, we don't want an Article III court.

Let's -- let's

10

concede that with -- with the one Article I judge sitting

11

on it, it ceases to be an Article III court.

12

the statute says that.
MR. GREEN:

13

But that --

What's the matter with that?

Well, we said in our brief that if

14

Congress were acting to -- in accordance with its plenary

15

power, which -- as I think Justice Breyer's hypothetical

16

poses, that might well be constitutional.

I think

So -- so that if Congress said, all

right, we're going to have appeals from the territorial

20

courts in a court consisting of one territorial judge and

21

two Article III judges, however selected, no problem with

22

that constitutionally.

23

MR. GREEN:

Right?

I -- I think that is a very

24

difficult and open question, and I -- and I think there

25

might be a constitutional issue if we to back to Crowell

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

v. Benson, and -- and Crowell's reaffirmation in -- in

2

Northern -- or rather, Thomas.

3

issue as to whether you can have territorial judges

4

exercising precisely the same kind of almost Article III

5

jurisprudence that district -- regular Article III

6

district judges have and -- and not have some sort of

7

Article III review from that.

8

QUESTION:

There is a significant

So you -- you would -- you would have

9

the same problem if Congress said we're going to set up an

10

Article IV court of appeals consisting of three Article IV

11

judges.

You'd have the same problem?
MR. GREEN:

12

I think that -- that claim can be

13

made, as I say, on the basis of Crowell and -- and on the

14

basis of Thomas.
QUESTION:

15

Well, the claim can be made, but I

16

mean, would you make it?

17

claim?

18

MR. GREEN:

Do you think that is a sound

I think -- I think I would make it

19

and I think I would make it for the following reasons.

20

Precisely because, as Justice Ginsburg points out, these

21

Article IV judges, in trying cases and interpreting

22

Federal law, are certainly doing the same kinds of work,

23

exercising the judicial power --

24
25

QUESTION:

Yes, but you could make the same

argument about trial judges and -- and Article III

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

district judges.

They're doing the same kind of work.

2

They're subject to the same pressures and the same

3

concerns, and if it's okay for the district court, why

4

wouldn't it be okay for an appellate court?
MR. GREEN:

5

Well, I -- there is certainly

6

Article III review.

7

review has been constitutionally mandated in that sense.

8

But where there is no Article III protection in the first

9

place with respect to -- to judges who are exercising that

10

authority at the trial court level, Crowell v. Benson and

11

I think Thomas indicate that -- that there is a -- there

12

is an open question at least as to whether Article III

13

review is mandated.

14

Guam v. Olsen on -- on precisely the same issue.

And this Court said the same in

MS. MILLETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

4

May I ask you a question at the

5

outset?

And actually two questions.

Some years ago I was

6

in London, and I was asked to sit with a British court on

7

the bench.

8

well, I wonder if they would have let me participate in

9

the decision.

And I -- I didn't do it, but I often thought,

Absolutely.

And would you just say that's

hope someone would object, but if they don't and assuming

that it's a case coming out of the territory again, then

we would go back to the same analysis and say whether --

QUESTION:

To get -- to get due process, you --

23

you get to -- you get to that portion of the plain error

doctrine which says plain error applies if it seriously

25

affects the integrity or fairness of the proceeding.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

And

1

if you have the President of the Guam Bar Association

sitting on the court, doesn't that seriously affect the

fairness of the proceeding in a manner that -- that having

a -- an Article IV judge does not?
MS. MILLETT:

5

Well, in American Insurance

6

Company versus Canter, which was opinion by Chief Justice

7

Marshall at the beginning of this Nation, dealing with

territorial cases, it addressed there a court that

difficult constitutional questions that would be raised if

Congress were to prescribe this.

22

analysis in our brief, it is a statute we could defend.

23

But there would be difficult constitutional questions if

24

that happened.

I think based on the

confrontation between the branches with Congress trying to

3

Well, but your position is there --

4

there could be a waiver.

I thought your answer to Justice

5

Stevens was that the parties could waive.

7

and -- and your position prevails.

8

this appointment should not have been made.

9

MS. MILLETT:

11

I think, Your Honor, what would

12

prevent them is a decision from this Court declaring

13

limitations on their statutory appointment power.

14

this Court -- and if the Ninth Circuit -QUESTION:

15
16

No.

They waive that.

And if

the parties waive it.
MS. MILLETT:

17

And if -- and if the Ninth Circuit

18

were to engage, which is not to be presumed by

19

governmental officials, court or executive -- but were to

20

engage in some pattern of violating the statute, I think

21

this Court's supervisory authorities could take care of

22

that.

23

But in an individual case like this, where there

24

was no assertion of the right, this question would still

25

be the same.

Did plain error occur that affected the

MS. MILLETT:

QUESTION:

I mean, you may be right

I hope so.

But there is, I think, in Justice

7

Stevens' question a very important implication.

To get

the due process part out of it, assume that the people in

front of the court are not American citizens.

Indeed,

10

assume it's Judge Wald going to be appointed to the

11

International Court.

Now, there's no due process problem.

12

So can the Congress appoint a sitting Federal

13

judge to go to a foreign place where it's perfectly all

14

right with the foreign people and hear their case?

15

I'm not sure.

16

is at issue here.

Now,

But that's, I think, what they're arguing

17

MS. MILLETT:

18

QUESTION:

19

MS. MILLETT:

20

QUESTION:

I --

Not a due process problem -Yes.

-- but a question of what kind of

function you can give to a sitting Federal judge because,

2

problem.

So there's no due process

3

Now, what's the answer?

4

MS. MILLETT:

I think, Your -- Your Honor,

5

that -- that we would defend that statute, and we think

6

that it would be permissible, assuming -- I mean, the -- a

7

better way to approach it is that the analysis that would

8

be applied would be as this Court did in Mistretta versus

9

the United States.

And you would focus on -- and a number

10

of cases.

You would focus on what is the nature of the

11

job that's being imposed.

12

wouldn't be asked to do some sort of Article I function.

13

And would doing that function so distract or withdraw from

14

the burden -- I'm sorry -- distract or interrupt the

15

judge's -- or court's ability to function as an

16

Article III court.

It's a judicial function.

It

That would be the analysis.

Now, to -- to put a finer point on it, in

17
18

fact -- and the reason I have to take the position it

19

would be okay, is Congress has enacted a statute,

20

28 U.S.C. 297, which authorizes judges of the Ninth

21

Circuit to go sit in the Freely Associated Compact States,

22

which is Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, which are

23

not --

24
25

QUESTION:

But that -- but that -- you're --

you're -- there are two questions.

One is can an

That's not this

to an Article III court so that the Article III court is

on some days an Article III court and some days not an

5

Article III court.

This case is whether a non-Article III judge can go

I -- I assume that the law of the circuit is

7

something the Ninth -- Ninth Circuit is proud of.

Is

8

it going to now have under -- under your theory an --

9

an asterisk by the opinions that are written by

10

non-Article III judges so that that's not so much the law

11

of the circuit?

12

what happens to the court, not what happens to the judge.

I mean, this -- this is the problem:

MS. MILLETT:

13

No, I understand, Justice Kennedy.

14

There are two points to your question.

15

get to them both.

I would like to

The first is, would it violate the Constitution

16
17

to -- does it violate the Constitution to have someone

18

who's not an Article III judge sit with the Ninth Circuit

19

on a given day?

20

do it and that we would defend that statute based on the

21

analysis I gave --

And our position is that Congress could

QUESTION:

22

So you think Congress could -- could

23

authorize a State superior court judge to sit on this

24

Court?

25

MS. MILLETT:

No, not on this Court.

I think

31
Alderson Reporting Company

1

this Court has unique status.

The Supreme Court has

by Article I and nobody in Congress has any authority or

be okay, but in -- in particular, as to territorial

residents.

21

different.

MS. MILLETT:

QUESTION:

It didn't involve

And that's what

Yes.

Under your theory -- forget the

authorized by Congress, have a visiting State court judge

1

every day as the visitor of the day.

2

MS. MILLETT:

3

QUESTION:

At least in territorial cases.

And that would not impair its

4

Article III character.

5

difficult to believe.

I -- I just find that very

MS. MILLETT:

6

Well, Justice Kennedy, the way we

7

get to this position is two steps.

Is first -- there

8

isn't, obviously, clearly on point, but if you add

9

Mistretta to Morrison versus Olson, which had a delegation

10

of non-Article III functions to -- to -- that's the -- the

11

independent counsel case -- to the special division that

12

appoints the independent counsel -- and so you combine

13

that and you combine that with the precedents on sharing

14

of power with magistrate judges -- those together -- and

15

then add to all of that the very limited constitutional

16

rights to -- to a particular form of tribunal accorded to

17

people in the territories.
But I also wanted to get back -- we think that

18
19

it could be defended.

20

don't think the constitutional violation would be plain

21

error.

22

But even if the answer is no, we

But to get back to your binding precedent point,

23

which I think is an important one, it's -- there's three

24

things to keep in mind.

25

First of all, whether this is a binding

Article III court -- after -- at least after Congress had

12

passed the statute giving them that status.

13

two concurring Justices, which provided the most narrow

ground for decisions in that case, specifically said that

Ms. Millett, I'm surprised at the

21

answers that you're giving, that they're not prefaced by

22

what you said -- I thought you said -- in your brief which

was that Congress did not enact a statute that allowed the

24

Ninth Circuit to include one of these judges.

25

shouldn't speculate on the constitutionality of a

the Ninth Circuit having failed to follow the statute that

Congress enacted instead of speculating on, oh, suppose

absolutely agree.

12

questions that were posed.

13

this is not the appropriate case to address limitations on

14

congressional power over appellate review in territorial

15

cases.

16

I was trying to be responsive to

QUESTION:

But we absolutely agree that

Well, I think it's -- I think it's

17

sometimes not unusual for us to put a hypothetical case to

18

test your proposition.

19

is whether there is a structural deficiency caused by a

20

territorial judge sitting, either by accident or on

21

purpose, if -- if there's such a -- a structural

22

impairment of its constitutional role, of its

23

constitutional integrity that there must be reversal.

24

the hypothetical is just simply designed to -- to

25

illustrate the point.

And the proposition we are testing

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

And

1

MS. MILLETT:

Right.

Well, Justice Kennedy, if

2

we're talking about now reversal under the plain error

3

doctrine, then the types of structural errors in which

4

this Court has found reversal to be appropriate under the

5

plain error doctrine to violate substantial rights or even

6

to make harmless error analysis inapplicable have -- is a

7

very narrow, small class.

8

errors -QUESTION:

9
10

And those are -- those are

I -- I agree with you that that's --

that that's a hard point in -- in the case.
Let me ask you.

11

Do we focus just on the rights

12

of the -- of the litigant in this case?

13

appropriate for us to consider the constitutional

14

integrity of an Article III court?

15

suppose we thought there was damage to the court, not

16

necessarily to the litigant.

17

in the plain error -MS. MILLETT:

18

Or is it

In other words,

Can we take account of that

The -- the fourth prong of the

19

plain error analysis is whether the -- the error seriously

20

affected the fairness or integrity of judicial

21

proceedings, which would seem to be responsive to -- to

22

your concern, and that would be the appropriate place to

23

put it.

24
25

But I think it's important to understand that -that the types of errors that are deemed structural under

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the plain error -- I'm not talking about structure under

2

Article III -- are things that go to -- and I think that

3

would satisfy prong four -- are things that go to whether

4

the court essentially functioned as a court.

5

is it consistent with the basic precepts that underlie our

6

judicial system?

7

public trial where they completely denied --

8
9

Does it --

Was there race discrimination?

QUESTION:

Was it a

But your position, as I understand,

is this -- this right can be waived, and I'm not quite

10

clear on why -- supposing we decide with you in this case,

11

why next month the Ninth Circuit might go back and ask for

12

written waivers from all the lawyers in Guam for -- to

13

repeat the process and put on the president of the bar

14

association as the third person on the panel.

15

couldn't they do that?

16

MS. MILLETT:

Why

Well, Justice Stevens, we're

17

asking this -- in theory that could happen, but I think

18

we're asking this Court to decide this case on the

19

assumption that judges, like executive officers, attempt

20

to comply with the Constitution and don't intentionally

21

file rulings of this Court or statutes -QUESTION:

Well, they're complying with the

24

QUESTION:

No, but if it's --

25

QUESTION:

-- if there's -- if there's a -- a

23

rule --

1

waivable right there, and they say we think it's in the

2

interest of harmony between the judges and lawyers in the

3

Ninth Circuit to let one of the lawyers sit with us and

4

see how we work here a couple of times.

5

MS. MILLETT:

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. MILLETT:

But -- right --

And they're going to do this.
But, Justice Stevens, before this

8

Court would address whether it's waivable, it would say

9

whether it's wrong.

10

just -QUESTION:

11
12
13

This is isn't that something that was

Well, you've already admitted it's

wrong.
MS. MILLETT:

Right.

And so I think it's one

14

thing to have a right that -- that is -- that is, you

15

know, parties can do with one way or the other and the

16

statute or the law doesn't speak to it.

17

Court -- if this Court were to agree with, I think, both

18

of this in this case that this was wrong, that I don't

19

think we would presume that the Ninth Circuit is going to

20

go -- keep doing -- and -- and the Justice Department

21

isn't going to defend it.

22

QUESTION:

No.

But where this

But it's wrong only if you

23

cannot waive it.

In the -- the hypothetical is that --

24

that the waiver is right up front, that the person says it

1

MS. MILLETT:

No, Justice -- Justice Souter.

I

think you can have errors that are wrong, but the question

3

is whether in -- in -- by not objecting to that, they're

4

entitled to relief.

QUESTION:

MS. MILLETT:

That's different -No, but the -- the question I --- than whether it's a right they

can waive.
QUESTION:

Excuse me.

But I think the question

was why will this not -- this practice not be perpetuated

10

if it is waivable.

It is not an answer to that to say

11

that -- the other courts will not gratuitously engage in

12

unconstitutional action because, if the waiver is

13

effective, there's no unconstitutional action.

14

seems to me that on your position you have to face the

15

fact that if it's waivable, it can properly happen again

16

if there's a waiver.

So it

17

MS. MILLETT:

No, Justice Souter --

18

QUESTION:

Okay.

QUESTION:

The same --

QUESTION:

-- hear that with -- with what my

Let me -- let me --

21

follow-up question was going to be.

22

them both.

23

And you can answer

Why -- instead of getting into waiver, why don't

24

we say, under the plain error doctrine, look, everybody

25

agrees that it was wrong?

Everybody agrees that it was

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

plain.

2

the integrity of the court when the composition of the

3

court is simply illegal.

4

And there is, in fact, a serious question about

And so, if you want to stick to waiver, I don't

5

know what the answer is to Justice Stevens' problem.

6

The -- the alternative to waiver is to face the fact that

7

there's something seriously wrong with a court which is

8

unabashedly illegally constituted.

9

MS. MILLETT:

Justice Souter, when we're talking

10

about waiver here, we are talking about something that is

11

unconstitutional, just like someone could waive their --

12

can waive their right to an Article III tribunal, but if

13

Congress passed a statute that violated it, it would still

14

be unconstitutional for the court to sit in that manner.

15

We don't think this is an unconstitutional issue.

16

waiver is not the same as it's something the parties can

17

freely take or drop because you have to go back and -- to

18

the step before that and say this is wrong and it won't be

19

done and it shouldn't be done.

20

But

But if we assume that -- we're -- we're in the

21

context of plain error analysis here.

That's why the

22

concept of waiver is being discussed.

It's not whether a

23

mistake was made or whether these people have the right

24

freely to choose.

25

right freely to choose what the composition of the panel

They don't, under the statute, have the

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

will -- will be.

We agree with that.

But when no objection was made below,

2
3

proceedings were completed, an appeal was completed

4

without any objection, they fully and freely participated

5

in that, and it was only after the outcome that they

6

turned around to challenge the -- the composition of their

7

court, that's an important value too.
QUESTION:

8
9

It seems to me the waiver would be

stronger if it were in advance instead of afterwards.

I'm

10

positing a case where everybody agrees in advance we'll

11

let the -- we'll let this director of tourism of our -- of

12

Guam participate as a judge today because that will help

13

the image of the court and so forth.

14

we'll let them try it.

Everybody agrees

Why isn't that waiver more --

15

QUESTION:

The question isn't --

16

QUESTION:

-- more binding than the one we have

QUESTION:

And -- and Justice Stevens' question

17
18

here?

19

is important because this case has consequence --

20

consequences and it tells Congress what might be done.

21

Congress might say, well, we won't put this burden of

22

waiving a statutory right.

23

right and say that Article -- that -- that Article IV

24

judges, territorial judges, can always sit on Ninth

25

Circuit opinions involving Guam.

We'll take away the statutory

That's -- that's why

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

we're testing whether or not there's a structural error in

2

what occurs here.
MS. MILLETT:

3

And I think this Court's clear

4

rules are that constitutional questions should not be

5

decided unnecessarily.

6

resolution of this case to say what would happen if there

7

was a full decision by Congress to enact a statute to

8

make it -- to engage a confrontation between the branches

9

and to analyze whether that would be appropriate --

And it's not necessary to

QUESTION:

Well, I thought --

QUESTION:

But -- but it is important because

12

you're saying that it's just a statutory right.

13

MS. MILLETT:

14

QUESTION:

15

And even if it's --

And I'm -- and I'm suggesting that it

might be more than that.
MS. MILLETT:

16

And -- and our position will be

17

even -- we don't think it's a constitutional violation not

18

because of what Congress can do or not do, but because

19

even if it violates Article III, that's no injury to

20

people who have --

MS. MILLETT:

QUESTION:

Suddenly we're talking about waiver.

2

Maybe I put that in as a -- it's a kind of red herring.

3

It's not a question of waiver.

4

this is plain error which turns into a question of does it

5

seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public

6

reputation of judicial proceedings.

7

It's a question of whether

Now, I take it in all these hypotheticals where

8

the Ninth Circuit is deliberately, which I don't think

9

they'd do, defying a congressional statute, getting

10

everybody to have waivers on the record, which are totally

11

contrary to what Congress said, that it would seriously

12

interfere with the integrity.

13

even thought of the issue, where they raised it a lot

14

later, it's all come up by accident, et cetera, and --

15

that maybe it wouldn't interfere with the public

reputation.

So what has waiver to do with it?

MS. MILLETT:

That -- no, I -- thank you for

that she designated this territorial judge.

MS. MILLETT:

So that was an advertent act

No, there's no doubt.

And there's

13

no doubt that -- that a conscious decision to appoint this

14

judge was made, but I think the question went to

whether -- as I understood it, went to whether there's an

ongoing problem or a policy.

MS. MILLETT:

There is no policy that we're

aware of of doing this.

It hasn't happened since this Court granted certiorari.

MS. MILLETT:

And don't we -- even if we confine

No, Justice Souter.

Our position

is that it would not because you had a quorum of Ninth

1

MS. MILLETT:

Right.

Right, certainly prong

2

four goes far beyond jurisdiction.

But what makes this

3

not offend judicial integrity is that territorial

4

residents who have no right to an Article III compliant

5

tribunal had their case heard by three Federal judges.

6

was heard fairly.

7

And so -- and -- and you have combined with that

what Justice Scalia referred to in discussing with -- with

13

there's a judicial integrity problem with allowing people

14

to proceed before a court and then wait until there's an

15

adverse outcome to challenge who it was that rendered that

16

decision.
And so taking all of those factors together in

17
18

the particular, peculiar context of territorial residents,

19

we don't think this offended judicial integrity or the

reputation of these proceedings.

object to the composition of the panel.
QUESTION:

4

Given how small the community is, the

5

bar is, in Guam and the Northern Marianas, it puts counsel

6

in a somewhat difficult position for the judge to say, oh,

7

do you mind if I sit on this case even though I'm not

8

qualified.

So I -- I'm not sure the waiver was all that

9

voluntary.

There's nothing in the record on the point.

MS. MILLETT:

10

Justice Kennedy, I think defense

11

counsel are frequently -- had to -- have to make difficult

12

decisions.

13

alienate the jury by objecting to evidence.

14

to alienate the judge by seeming too obstreperous?

15

they want to seem like they're hiding something from the

16

jury?

17

the whole point of an adversarial system is that defense

18

counsel is charged with doing that and you have to strike

19

balances.

20

They have to decide whether they want to
Do they want
Do

They have to make these difficult decisions, but

And if on balance they decided, which I don't

21

think counsel should think about their own reputation in

22

defending their clients, but if they decided it would be

There's nothing inherently prejudicial.

most harmless error or plain errors where it's inherently

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

13

MR. GREEN:

And

This case was not decided in that

14

kind of narrow context.

15

appeals from -- or decisions of the court of -- the Ninth

16

Circuit Court of Appeals from Guam or the Northern Mariana

17

Islands are narrow decisions, or somehow limited.

18

versus the United States, the Ninth Circuit decided a

19

question about the transportation of firearms in

20

interstate commerce and -- and created a split on the

21

basis of a Guam appeal with the Sixth Circuit.

22

It is not the case that court of

In Cruz

Judge Munson, in effect, would be deciding cases

23

that would apply to district judges in Montana.

I -- I

24

think that is, in part, answer to your question, Justice

25

Breyer, about the -- about the Article I judge.

Why isn't the answer to that you just

MR. GREEN:

They have no

I think actually the Ninth Circuit

couldn't do that because of its Article III nature.

I think that would be a -- an exceedingly odd thing to do

for the -QUESTION:

published, but non-precedential.
MR. GREEN:

I --

Of course, they are

That's true, but we know the issue

13

of -- of unpublished decisions is -- is changing, and

14

nonetheless there may be some knowledge, intra-circuit

15

knowledge, about how these issues were treated.

judges are, as we discussed earlier, interpreting Federal

law.

This was a case about laws that arose from -- from

And, Justice Souter, I would point out that with

respect to integrity here, I -- I think it would be -- it

21

would have more integrity, oddly enough, for the court to

have sat with the director of tourism of Guam.

I would add too that this is the kind of case

where the Court can -- can articulate a high wall, a
