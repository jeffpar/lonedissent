ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. ENGLERT:

9
10

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and

may it please the Court:
This case comes to the Court in a remarkable

11
12

posture.

If you agree with the Hobbs Act arguments in the

13

blue briefs, you should reverse the jury verdicts and

14

direct entry of judgment for the defendants.

15

you believe the arguments in the red and gray briefs, you

16

should still reverse, but for a new trial.

17

you do on the Hobbs Act, you should reverse the RICO

18

injunction because RICO simply does not authorize private

19

injunctive relief.

But even if

And whatever

20

Now, why do I say so starkly that even

21

respondents and the Government's theories require reversal

22

of the jury verdict?

23

briefs, to salvage the theory of plaintiffs' case, concede

24

that someone must obtain the victim's property for the

25

offense of extortion to be shown.

Because the attempts in those

And the whole reason

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the Court granted cert on the Hobbs Act issue was to

2

review the Seventh Circuit's holding directly contrary to

3

those concessions that, quote, a loss to, or interference

4

with the rights of the victim is all that is required,

5

closed quote.

6

it had to find was that the defendants caused someone,

7

quote, to give up a property right, closed quote.

8
9

Likewise, the jury was instructed that all

You will find in the red and gray briefs very
elaborate efforts to suggest meanings of obtain and

10

property under which the record in this case supposedly

11

could support a finding that petitioners obtained some

12

abstract form of property from the clinics or women.

13

no defense of the Seventh Circuit's holding and the jury

14

instructions that substituted the phrases, interference

15

with and give up for obtaining.

16

question that some form of reversal is required.

But

So there ought to be no

17

Now, the reason why there should be reversal for

18

the entry of judgment for the defendants, and not just for

19

a new trial, is that respondents and the Government's

20

brief-formulated conceptions of obtaining and property are

21

wrong.

22

obtained control over the use and disposition of clinic

23

assets.

24

another -- the language of the Hobbs Act -- is an awfully

25

broad use of language.

The essence of the theories is that petitioners

To refer to that as obtaining property of

It's a far cry from the New York

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

law on which the Hobbs Act was based.
QUESTION:

2

I suppose in some instances one

3

competitor can buy another competitor's firm and just

4

close it up in a regular business transaction, and that --

5

that would be obtaining it in that sense.

6

I recognize that title transfers, et cetera, et cetera.

Now, of course,

7

Here the result is about the same.

8

MR. ENGLERT:

9

it's not.

No, Your Honor.

Respectfully,

My clients don't have the clinic's property

10

today as they would if they had, in fact, obtained it.

11

They may have temporarily interfered with some use of it.
QUESTION:

12

Let's assume that the -- that the

13

boycott or -- or the protests are sufficient to close it

14

down.

15

they have obtained -- they have secured for themselves the

16

use that they want of it, i.e., no use.

17

They have obtained it in a certain sense in that

MR. ENGLERT:

That is a sense of the word

18

obtain, but it's not the sense relevant for interpreting

19

the Hobbs Act for several reasons.

20

has historical predecessors that this Court has said

21

should be looked to in interpreting its terms.

22

QUESTION:

One is the Hobbs Act

You -- you concede it's a sense of

23

the term obtained?

I mean, would you really speak of

24

obtaining somebody's property when you -- when you

25

interfere with that person's use of it?

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ENGLERT:

Well, I certainly don't -- I'm

2

sorry, Justice Scalia.

3

relevant sense of obtain.

I certainly don't concede it's a

Because of -- because of the Hobbs Act

4
5

historical antecedents, because of the rule of lenity,

6

because of the very odd use of language, for all those

7

reasons, that's not how the Court should interpret obtain.
But more important than any of those things is

8
9

the implications of such a theory.

When Carry Nation went

10

into saloons with her axe and destroyed property, she

11

certainly interfered with the property owner's unfettered

12

use and control over disposition of his assets, and that's

13

exactly what she intended to do.

Was that extortion?

The civil rights boycott of white merchants that

14
15

the Court considered in Claiborne Hardware certainly

16

affected the ability of the boycotted merchants to use

17

their property and involved isolated acts of violence as

18

well.

Was that extortion?

19

These aren't hypothetical concerns.

20

QUESTION:

21

charged in that case, was it?

22

Of course, that -- extortion wasn't

MR. ENGLERT:

No, Your Honor, but were the Court

23

to uphold the theory in the red and gray briefs, which

24

wouldn't support the judgment, but if the Court were to

25

uphold that theory, it certainly could be charged the next

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

time the facts of Claiborne Hardware come along.

2
3

QUESTION:

One must wonder why it wasn't

charged.

4

MR. ENGLERT:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.

Because it was a State case it

6

wasn't -- the reason -- reason it wasn't charged.

7

up through the Mississippi court system, if I remember

8

correctly, didn't it?
MR. ENGLERT:

9

It grew

Well, my -- that's correct, of

10

course, Justice Stevens.

11

that one case was or wasn't charged as -- as extortion.

12

It's if you uphold the theory of the red and gray briefs,

13

it can be charged as extortion in the future.

14

actually happened to People for the Ethical Treatment of

15

Animals.

16

Because of these implications, the Southern Christian

17

Leadership Conference joined the amicus brief of the

18

Seamless Garment Network at the cert stage.

19

rights groups that conduct protests have joined the

20

Seamless Garment Network brief at the merits stage.

21

Activists of all stripes and their admirers -- Daniel and

22

Philip Berrigan, Nat Hentoff, Martin Sheen --

23

But my fundamental point is not

And that's

It's happened to other animal rights groups.

QUESTION:

Disability

But are we talking about actions that

24

constitute the commission of some kind of criminal offense

25

in the process?

MR. ENGLERT:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. ENGLERT:

4

QUESTION:

5

Yes.
Oh, yes.

Trespass.

Yes, and other things, destruction of

property and so forth, I suppose.

6

MR. ENGLERT:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. ENGLERT:

9

Oh, yes.

Oh, yes, Justice O'Connor.

Yes.
There's never been any doubt in

this case --

10

QUESTION:

I mean, we're not talking about

11

conduct that is lawful here.
MR. ENGLERT:

12

We are not talking about

13

extortion, but we are talking about some things that could

14

be punished much less severely.
It has never been disputed in this case, from

15
16

the opening statement through the closing statement of the

17

trial or in the earlier phases of the case, that there

18

were trespasses.

19

circumstances --

There could be in particular

QUESTION:

20

-- more than that.

21

assaults and so forth.

22

MR. ENGLERT:

In some cases,

Well, fair enough except the --

23

the jury verdict really is quite at rejection of

24

petitioners' proof in many respects rather than supporting

25

it.

But, yes, Justice O'Connor.

I really don't want to

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

fight with you on that particular point.

2

But -- but let's --

3

QUESTION:

-- I think to paint the picture that

4

we're talking about, just pure speech is -- is not the

5

case.
MR. ENGLERT:

6

No, but that's why I used the

7

examples of Carry Nation and Claiborne Hardware which

8

weren't pure speech either.

9

in those cases, but not extortion.
QUESTION:

10

There was certainly violence

Would you say coercion?

One of the

11

questions was, well, coercion -- if that's defined as

12

using compulsion to force a person to do or not do

13

something that she otherwise would do or not do, does this

14

conduct fit that crime?

15

MR. ENGLERT:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. ENGLERT:

Yes.

That crime -And that's a very important point

18

supporting our position because Congress at one point had

19

coercion as a predicate act in the Anti-Racketeering Act

20

of 1934 and, at the request of organized labor, took it

21

out.

22

1946, again, organized labor lobbied to make sure that

23

coercion was not part of the Hobbs Act.

24

different crime from extortion, and interfering with

25

someone's rights is the crime of coercion under the Model

In the Hobbs Act, in the passage of the Hobbs Act in

Coercion is a

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Penal Code, under New York law, under various other bodies

2

of law, but it's not the crime of extortion.

3

QUESTION:

Just -- just on the obtain point,

4

which I -- I agree with you is of great relevance here,

5

if -- if a group trespasses on property and -- and remains

6

there for a period of days, can it be said that they're

7

obtaining the use of the property, or is -- is that too

8

much of a stretch?

9

MR. ENGLERT:

I think it's a stretch, Justice

10

Kennedy, but even if it weren't a stretch, it still

11

wouldn't be a Hobbs Act violation for a different reason.

12

There must be consent to the obtaining of property or --

13

of another, and simply going in and engaging in adverse

14

possession doesn't necessarily entail consent.

15

QUESTION:

Well, suppose you withdraw in order

16

to avoid confrontation.

17

turns over the wallet, in a sense there's consent, not --

18

not the kind of consent that the law would ever recognize.

19

It's a consent in a -- just from the standpoint that

20

there's a voluntary act in handing over the -- the wallet.

21

MR. ENGLERT:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

I suppose if A robs B, and B

Well, that actually --

You make your -- you make your

muscles move and that's about it.
MR. ENGLERT:

Yes.

Words can be stretched to

make lots of things into lots of things that the law

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

doesn't want them to be.

And in fact, the common law

2

distinction between robbery and extortion, which are both

3

Hobbs Act predicates, is one is with consent and the other

4

is without.

5

that you could stretch the word of consent to cover, but

6

it isn't extortion.

7

QUESTION:

So robbery is a classic example of something

I guess it's obtaining property if a

8

group of people through criminal means tell an owner of a

9

business precisely and in detail how he has to run his

10

business.
MR. ENGLERT:

11
12

Oh, I don't think so, Justice

Breyer.
QUESTION:

13

No?

In other words, if -- if, say,

14

you have a group of terrible criminals, and they say here

15

is what -- we're going to kill you unless you do the

16

following, and then they say, today you serve X and

17

tomorrow you serve Y, and you send the money over to Z,

18

and you do all these different things; in other words,

19

they run the business.

20

MR. ENGLERT:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

If it --

Now, why haven't they obtained that

business?
MR. ENGLERT:

In the hypothetical example you

24

just gave me, they most certainly have obtained property.

25

You said send the money over to Z.

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

QUESTION:

Because I said -- say -- I regretted

putting that in the hypothetical the instant I did.

3

(Laughter.)

4

QUESTION:

I'm simply looking for an example of

5

a group of criminals who will tell a property owner, a

6

businessman, exactly and precisely how to run his business

7

in a way that he doesn't want to run it.

8

that obtaining the property called the business?

9

that's what the SG I think is suggesting basically.
MR. ENGLERT:

10

Now, why isn't
I mean,

And the SG is wrong because that's

11

not what obtaining property meant under the New York law

12

in 1946.

13

concept of property.

It -- it's a stretch of words.

QUESTION:

14

It's a modern

It's like a theft of services.

15

I mean, you go in and you -- there was a -- years ago a

16

person who figured out how to whistle various tones into

17

the telephone so that it would connect people without

18

charge.

19

use of the telephone?

All right.

Now, hasn't that person stolen the

20

MR. ENGLERT:

21

QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes.

And -- and a person who tells

22

the telephone company owner, I want you to go and provide

23

the services to A, B, and C, hasn't he stolen those

24

services?

25

MR. ENGLERT:

Well, that's getting to be more of

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

a stretch, but probably yes, under United States v. -QUESTION:

Then -- then the difference between

3

that and a person who tells the business owner to provide

4

his services to A, B, C, D, and E, whom he doesn't want

5

to, that doesn't seem a difference.

6

MR. ENGLERT:

No.

There is a major difference,

7

with respect, Justice Breyer.

8

to A, B, C, D, and E is quite different from saying don't

9

provide services to A, B, C --

10
11
12

QUESTION:

Saying do provide services

That's what I wondered, and what is

the difference there?
MR. ENGLERT:

The difference is that A, B, C, D,

13

and E have obtained the services in one case and they

14

have -- and no one has obtained any property in the other

15

case, exactly the words of the Hobbs Act.

16

QUESTION:

Except that services is not property,

17

and the one thing that is common in both the negative and

18

the positive examples is the obtaining of control.

19

It's -- it's -- it seems to me it's -- it's the control

20

that's important when he says serve A, B, and C.

21

property that he has obtained.

22

It's a service.

23

MR. ENGLERT:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. ENGLERT:

It isn't

It's -- it's an action.

Justice Souter --

And that's true in each case.
-- if I've understood you

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

correctly, that's even more support for our position

2

because the words of the Hobbs Act are obtaining of

3

property from another.

4

examples --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. ENGLERT:

7

QUESTION:

So if all of Justice Breyer's

No, no --- property --

I -- I agree with you on that point,

8

but I -- I guess I'm saying that if you concede in the one

9

case, I don't see why you -- you really don't have to

10

concede in -- in the other case because the one thing that

11

is common to each is control, and there is no property in

12

a tangible sense that is obtained in -- in the positive

13

service examples.
MR. ENGLERT:

14

No.

With respect, what is common

is not control.

16

That's what obtaining means.

17

brief on page 21 in footnote 11 says that's what obtaining

18

means.

The Solicitor General's own

And -QUESTION:

19
20

It's acquisition.

It's obtaining.

15

And what does one obtain?

One

obtains, in each case, control --

21

MR. ENGLERT:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. ENGLERT:

But control --

-- i.e., direction.
I apologize, Justice Souter, for

24

interrupting, but control is not property.

25

property.

Property is

1

QUESTION:

My point is if you are conceding that

2

Justice Breyer's positive examples would fall within the

3

statute, I don't see why you don't have to concede that

4

the negative example, i.e., don't serve, doesn't also

5

fall --

I don't think so, respectfully,

It was under the -- under the New York

statute, which I think everyone agrees was the model for

the Federal statute.

6

MR. ENGLERT:

7

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

It seemed to me there was no

8

obtaining in the very literal sense that you used the

9

term, but there was merely acquisition of control of the

10

operation in that.

And I'm not quite sure how you come

11

out on -- on those facts.
MR. ENGLERT:

12

Well, Your Honor, I'm -- I'm, as I

13

stand here, blanking on those facts.

14

New York courts did construe obtaining of property rather

15

strictly in that case and in every other pre-1946 case,

but I can't -- I apologize.

I can't give you an

It's very straightforward.

I plan to address

First, this Court has held in several cases that

22

section 7 of the Sherman Act and section 4 of the Clayton

23

Act, both worded almost identically to section 1964(c) of

RICO, did not authorize private injunctive relief.

The language of the acts, though, is

because the language differs.

The analogy may not be perfect

MR. ENGLERT:

8

Very slightly, but the -- where

9

there's a world of difference and not a slight difference

10

is between section 16 of the Clayton Act and section 1964

11

of RICO.

12

authorized private injunctive relief.

13

remotely resembling section 16 appears in section 1964 of

14

RICO, but all of the language from the statutes this Court

15

held didn't authorize injunctive relief with very tiny

16

variations appears in RICO.

17

And in section 16 of the Clayton Act, Congress
No language

Besides the obvious statutory language borrowed

18

from the Clayton and Sherman Acts, as this Court has

19

recognized throughout its cases, the statutory evolution

20

of RICO presented Congress with repeated opportunities

21

expressly to provide private parties with injunctive

22

relief under RICO.

2

ironically the very day the Seventh Circuit decided this

that case reiterated the longstanding principle -- with

which some members of the Court disagreed, but the

the day in a case of doubt -MR. ENGLERT:

2

It shouldn't because, as is

3

pointed out at pages 7 and 8 of the Operation Rescue reply

4

brief and correctly so, this Court has two lines of cases:

5

one when Congress doesn't specify the remedies.

6

cases like Franklin v. Gwinnett County which was an

7

implied right of action case, and like Califano v.

8

Yamasaki.

That's

And a different line of cases saying, when

10

Congress does specify remedies, they're intended to be

11

exclusive.

A line of cases that -- that --

QUESTION:

12

Well, it -- may I tell you the reason

13

I wasn't convinced on that is that if -- if Congress

14

were -- were specifying in the text here choices among

15

ordinary remedies, I think that would be a very strong

16

argument.
The reason it seems less strong here is that the

17
18

choices that -- or the -- the remedies that Congress has

19

specified are extraordinary remedies, e.g., right in this

20

section.

What is specified is treble damages, not

21

damages.

If they had simply said can get damages, I think

22

it would be a slam-dunk, but -- but what they did was --

23

was to specify something out of the ordinary, and I'm not

24

sure that that carries the implication that ordinary

remedies, consistent with what it specifies, are -- are

said over and over again that it did carry that

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE

MR. OLSON:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
The right to control a business, whether or not

7

for profit, is a well-recognized and longstanding interest

8

in property.

9

to unlawful force, whether motivated by economics,

When that control is surrendered in response

10

politics, or ideals, the extortionist has attained his

11

objective, and the Hobbs Act has been violated.

12

QUESTION:

Well, under that definition, I

13

suppose that anytime protesters trespass on property,

14

they've obtained the use of that property and there's a

15

Hobbs Act violation --

16

MR. OLSON:

MR. OLSON:

If there's an unlawful use of force

19

or threats or violence, Justice Kennedy, whether it be in

20

the form of trespassing -- and the aim -- which this Court

21

recognized 8 years ago in this -- in this very predecessor

22

case was to shut down the clinics.

23

achieved, the control of the property has been transferred

24

from the owner of those clinics to the extortionist.

MR. OLSON:

dissent, which you joined, in the earlier case, the First

QUESTION:

10

Well, the -- there's always a First

12

to me.

to the wind with respect to First Amendment rights.
MR. OLSON:

I submit, Justice Scalia, that that

3

is not going to be the -- the problem that this Court or

any courts are going to have to face.

5

First of all, the definition of property as

controlling a business has been accepted for a long time.

What -- what this Court -What language of the statute enables

you to separate labor?
MR. OLSON:

7

Well, I -- I can't pull a specific

8

piece of the language out of the statute, but this Court

9

said nearly 20 times in the Enmons case that the Hobbs Act

10

was not intended to cover achievement of legitimate

11

collective bargaining demands, and because the Court did

12

not want to --

MR. OLSON:

Scalia, that it seemed to me a clear implication of the

9

MR. OLSON:

Yes.

10

QUESTION:

Fine.

What I don't understand is

11

whether there isn't a line somewhere between obtaining

12

control in the sense of taking over a business for a

13

period of time, shutting down a business, and just telling

14

the owner of the business to do one single thing once that

15

the blackmailer -- but not the owner -- wants to do.

16

MR. OLSON:

17

QUESTION:

Let me -There's a spectrum that falls within

18

that word control or the word taking over that if you push

19

it to an extreme, the Hobbs Act becomes a coercion statute

20

in respect to a business owner.

21

MR. OLSON:

It -- the question, it seems to me,

22

was answered in part by this Court in the earlier NOW case

23

by saying that the extortionist doesn't have to gain a

24

financial benefit or take possession.

25

Now, the -- the robbery and larceny statutes at

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

common law required the taking and acquiring of

2

possession.

3

QUESTION:

I take where you're going is that it

4

is a coercion statute in respect to a businessperson

5

insofar as you ask the owner of the business to do

6

something that he doesn't want to do.

7
8

10
11

MR. OLSON:

That's -- that's part of it, yes.

And the answer to the question about obtaining -QUESTION:

If I think that's too extreme, is

there any stopping place?
MR. OLSON:

Well, there -- there is a stopping

12

point, is whether at the end of the day, through the

13

threats or the -- the actions of the extortionist, that

14

property interest that was held by the victim of the

15

extortion has been transferred to the hands of the

16

extortionist in the sense that the aim has been

17

accomplished.

18

was the attempt, and to the extent that that was or was

19

attempted to be accomplished, that control --

The aim was to shut down the clinics.

If -- if we

Congress created a private right to damages for

21

RICO violations by intentionally copying language from the

22

antitrust laws that this Court had repeatedly held did not

confer a right to seek injunctive relief.

24

said that Congress was aware of the antitrust history, was

copying it, intended to copy it, and was presumed to know

section 4 of the Clayton Act, but under whatever the other

number is.

MR. OLSON:

Well, may I answer that, Justice

Stevens?

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. OLSON:

Sure.
It seems to me that in the context

of the language that the -- that Congress knew would not

16

create a right, and knowing -- Congress knowing that

17

section 16 did specifically create such a right, and

18

knowing that this Court had said that when a right is

19

created and remedies specifically provided, the Court --

20

the Court will not expand.

21

Congress has done.

22

rejected the opportunities or -- or failed to accept the

have had that result.

MS. CLAYTON:

It's a strange thing.

Why

That's a question that we have

8

pondered for a long time, and -- and I think the Motorola

9

brief, which explains -- a very important brief -- why

10

preliminary injunctions should be available to everybody,

11

makes a good argument for that.

12

address that question here.

13

But we don't have to

My own thinking is that section (b) gives the

14

Government something that it wouldn't have had without the

15

statutory grant because preliminary injunctions require

16

one -- one element that permanent ones don't, the

17

irreparable harm to the victim.

18

as sovereign, doesn't have property that's harmed.

19

you look at the Wollersheim case, they recognize that was

a plausible reason for why section (b) is there.

MS. CLAYTON:

It means section 1964 as a whole,

3

has access to those unrestricted remedies of section

1964(a).
QUESTION:

5

And I looked -- I mean, I couldn't

6

make too much out of the fact that you take the language

7

from the Clayton Act which says the Attorney General may

8

institute proceedings in equity, and you move it to

9

section (b) and just change it to say, he may institute

10

proceedings under this section.

That's the only

11

difference with the Clayton Act that I could find.
So I looked up the history.

12

In the history, it

13

looks as if there were five different bills floating

14

around, and things didn't -- weren't all that

15

straightforward.

of that.

It got a little mixed up.

They should have.

13

MS. CLAYTON:

It is

And we all agree -- this

I'm with you on that.
I know you are, Justice Scalia.

Perhaps the only thing.

And

14

you've often commented on how there are probably as many

15

reasons for congressional action or inaction as there are

16

Members of Congress.

17

But the fact is the bill makes a very -- it's a

18

very radically different structure from the antitrust law.

19

Private -- I mean, permanent injunctions are unrestricted,

20

and under the traditional jurisprudence, Califano -- when

21

we -- we assume all traditional remedies are available

22

unless -- unless there's the clearest command.

There's

23

not even a hint here.

It was

24

certainly not a clear command to do the opposite.

25

Maybe it was a mistake.

would have been trying to figure out, well, what did they

That's the way they've put it.

MS. CLAYTON:

It's been in the hands of private

14

parties under the antitrust law for more than a half

15

century before RICO was passed, and the courts have had no

16

problem exercising their discretion to my knowledge.

17

In fact, in the American Stores case, this Court

18

pointed out how the very same remedy sought by the

19

Government and sought by private parties, the Government

20

might get it, and the private party might not.

21

Furthermore, any -- any injunctive relief --

quite -- quite bizarre.
MS. CLAYTON:

And then I think the court

wouldn't grant it to the private party, and they certainly

4

wouldn't grant it unless it was designed to remedy the

5

particular injury that the private party suffered to their

business and property by virtue of a 1962 violation.

7

would be very strange, indeed, Your Honor, to remove from

I think we all agree that property includes both

tangible things and intangible things.

Of course, in this

10

information age, some of our most important property is

11

intangible.

So the question, of course, is how does one

12

obtain it.

One obtains it by obtaining control over it or

13

dominion over it, as this Court explained in the Carpenter

14

and Green case.
Remember in Carpenter -- now, this is a mail

MS. CLAYTON:

No, Your Honor.

I see.
When we made -- we made that

12

argument, but we also told the jury that if they were

13

basing any predicate acts on the mere presence and a mere

14

blockade, mere sit-in, they had to put yes to question 6.

15

They put no because we showed them that they had to find

16

that any predicate act needed an element of force or

17

violence.

And that's what PLAN did.

18

It used these --

seems to me that your -- your theory doesn't depend on

21

the defendants here were obtaining property because they

That's your theory.

QUESTION:

Ms. Clayton, may I ask you one

question?

I just -- I -- I want to be sure I heard you

9

correctly.

There's a definition of property in the

10

instructions, a three-part definition, at page 158.

11

you tell us that that instruction was not objected to?
MS. CLAYTON:

12
13

Oh, no, I don't believe I said

that.

14

QUESTION:

15

MS. CLAYTON:

I just misunderstood you.
The -- the petitioners had offered

16

a definition of -- of extortion that was part with

17

property, and they didn't define it.

18

at the pretrial stage, that was all they offered.

19

didn't object then.

Did

So at the trial -They

They didn't

And their original view of what extortion meant

was part with property, which is the same I think as give

What is the difference between

MS. CLAYTON:

since it's not focused on property, it's not extortion.

12

Every extortion is a coercion.

QUESTION:

Liberty interests are not the

Shouldn't we draw the line this way?

14

Instead of speaking as, for example, the Solicitor General

15

did and some of the cases do about obtaining control,

16

isn't the way to -- to adhere to the line between the

17

liberty and property distinction to say that you extort if

18

you gain control in a way which prevents them from doing

19

business, i.e., engaging in a property exercise, but you

20

do not extort if you gain control simply in the way they

21

do business, i.e., their choice of whom to serve?

22

If we draw that distinction, then the old

23

sit-ins in the lunch counter weren't there to stop them

24

from doing business.

25

They wanted them to do business with them.

They wanted them to do business.

2

that the point of it was to stop the business, period, and

3

that gets into property and crosses the line from liberty

to property.

Would you accept that distinction?

MS. CLAYTON:

5

Not quite, Justice Souter.

6

I certainly agree that the -- that the sit-in protesters

7

were not extorting anybody because they were trying to

change people's mind by persuasion, not by intimidation.
