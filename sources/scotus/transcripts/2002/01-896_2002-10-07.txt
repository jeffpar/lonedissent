CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

4

next in No. 01-896, the Ford Motor Company and Citibank v.

5

John B. McCauley.

6

Mr. Waxman.

The Court would appreciate hearing

7

argument on, I'm sure, not just on the question presented

8

in the petition for certiorari, but on the question posed

9

in the supplemental briefing about whether there is

10

appellate jurisdiction where a nominally prevailing party

11

in the district court can -- can appeal, and also about

12

whether the question of -- under 1447(d), if this was an

13

order of remand, whether the -- the thing was appealable

14

to the Ninth Circuit at all.

15

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

16

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

17
18

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

19

Perhaps with that observation, I would -- it

20

would behoove me to address the quest -- the appellate

21

jurisdiction of this Court first, as much as I would like

22

to rush into why there clearly is subject matter

23

jurisdiction in this case, regardless of whether the

24

plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief are viewed as

25

separate and distinct or common and then divide it.

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

So let me first address why I think the Ninth

2

Circuit and this Court had appellate jurisdiction, and it

3

is straightforward.

4

case from the dismissal with prejudice of a consolidated

5

complaint which was filed voluntarily by the plaintiffs in

6

this case seeking -- as against plaintiffs that are

7

different than any -- than the constituent State court

8

actions, including different plaintiffs seeking different

9

causes of action and seeking a different form of relief,

10

that is, specific performance of the Ford rebate program.

11

And it is very clear, both from the cont -- the

12

--the four corners of the consolidated complaint and from

13

an express representation that my friend, Mr. Berman, made

14

at the oral argument in the class certification stage,

15

that the consolidated complaint was filed for the purpose

16

of obtaining, in front of Judge Dwyer in the Northern Dis

17

-- the Western District of Washington, a judgment on the

18

merits in the case.

19

treatment, the maximum treatment, that he would have been

20

permitted to provide under the multi-district litigation

21

panel's reference.

22

QUESTION:

That is, there is an appeal in this

That is, it was different than the

That is -What's sort of unusual, though, is

23

that you didn't suffer the dismissal.

I mean, yes, a

24

dismissal is -- is usually a final -- a final action, and

25

it's usually the person whose suit was dismissed who

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

appeals --

2

MR. WAXMAN:

3

QUESTION:

4
5

That is --

-- not -- not the person who

benefitted by the dismissal and that -MR. WAXMAN:

Indeed, and that, Justice Scalia,

6

is the -- is the question I believe, the specific

7

question, that the Court directed the parties' attention

8

to in its request for supplemental briefs.

9

Now, it is clear that a prevailing party

10

normally cannot appeal, but the operative word that this

11

Court has recognized, at least since the Electrical

12

Fittings case, is normally.

13

courts have applied a rather particular test to determine

14

when normally doesn't apply, and that is, is the nominally

15

prevailing party sufficiently aggrieved by a decision in

16

its favor that it retains a, quote, stake in the appeal?

17

And that's -- that test was articulated by this Court in

18

Guaranty Trust v. Roper --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. WAXMAN:

21

QUESTION:

And this Court and the lower

Mr. Waxman.
-- and in Forney v. Apfel.

Mr. Waxman, a defendant who removes a

22

case and then is remanded is surely aggrieved but,

23

nonetheless, cannot appeal.

24

an answer that you went by too fast for me is this case is

25

in -- was in the Washington district court for pretrial

And the problem I have with

5
Alderson Reporting Company

purposes only under 1407.

2

district courts to which these cases were initially

3

removed -- that transfer under the statute was for

4

pretrial purposes only, not for trial.

5

pretrial, under the statute, the cases, unless all the

6

parties consent, would go back to the district courts from

7

whence they came.

8

The transfer from the several

And after the

So I don't understand how the Western District

9

which is dealing with a complaint for pretrial purposes

10

only -- I mean, the -- the request that a complaint --

11

consolidated complaint be filed was for pretrial

12

processing.

13

displaces all of the other actions that had been removed

14

from the State court?

15

MR. WAXMAN:

How do you get from that an action that

Justice Ginsburg, the appealability

16

of the dismissal with prejudice of the consolidated

17

complaint does not depend on whether the consolidated

18

complaint, quote, did away with the other actions.

19

reason -- we would, of course, readily concede that under

20

1447(d), if all that had happened was a removal of the six

21

State court actions, a transfer for pretrial purposes to a

22

multi-district litigation court and a determination by

23

that court that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over

24

the complaints, there would be no appeal because the

25

remand of removed State court actions for lack of subject

The

Alderson Reporting Company

1

matter jurisdiction, Congress has decided, is not a

2

determination that may be reviewed by Federal appellate

3

courts.
But here -- and this, I think, is the salient

4
5

point.

6

lawyers in the six cases to file some sort of concordance

7

or a consolidating document that often is ordered so as to

8

facilitate pretrial proceedings.

9

if anybody wants to file a consolidated complaint, they

10

Here, the judge did not require the plaintiffs'

What the judge said is

may.
The consolidated complaint that was filed in

11
12

this case avowedly invoked this Court's 13 -- the Federal

13

court's 1332 jurisdiction and sought not just pretrial

14

consolidated proceedings on discovery and motions, they

15

wanted a full trial or a full resolution on the merits.

16

In other words, it's -- it's as if the judge,

17

having had the six cases transferred, said expressly,

18

look, I'm going to deal with all of the pretrial matters

19

that are the subject of this transfer order, but if you

20

all like me -QUESTION:

21

Mr. Waxman, may I stop you at that

22

point?

Because the pretrial consolidated -- the order --

23

this is -- I'm looking at the appendix, page 35.

24

by order of the multi-district panel, the cases have been

25

consolidated for pretrial purposes only.

It says,

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Now, you're saying that there is something --

2

something that I don't see in the written orders that says

3

they -- no, it's going to be now for trial purposes.

4

MR. WAXMAN:

No, no, no.

I'm -- I'm not

5

explaining myself correctly.

6

these six removed cases are here for trial purposes, and

7

if it did, it would exceed the court's authority under

8

1407 and this Court's specific holding in Lexecon.

9

The -- the order doesn't say

On page 41 of the joint appendix, the court

10

under a heading say -- entitled consolidated complaint

11

says, should plaintiffs in all or some of the consolidated

12

actions decide to file a consolidated complaint, you have

13

to do so within a certain period of time.

14

Now, that raises the question, since they did it

15

voluntarily, whether what they were filing was something

16

that, in essence, sort to -- as I said, to be a

17

concordance, to consolidate in one document all of the

18

various parties and all the various claims and all various

19

theories so that a court can meaningful and --

20

meaningfully and efficiency -- efficiently manage the

21

pretrial proceedings.

22

QUESTION:

But ordinarily you wouldn't go -- go

23

about it that way.

24

consolidated complaint.

25

You'd have a memorandum, not a

MR. WAXMAN:

That -- that's true, Mr. Chief

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Justice, although there are instances where the court --

2

where the transferee court has ordered the filing of

3

something called a consolidated complaint.
But here, there are two salient -- at least two

4
5

salient differences.

One is this complaint has different

6

parties.

7

different type of relief.

8

it seeks quite clearly, based on the conduct of the

9

parties and the representations, this is, in essence,

It has different causes of action.

It seeks a

And at the motion -- and -- and

10

saying thank you very much for having -- having us here

11

for consolidated proceedings on our underlying state court

12

actions, but we have decided we like you, Judge Dwyer, and

13

we want you to try a case, and we're going to file a brand

14

new Federal action that is docketed in the Western

15

District.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Waxman, things like that,

17

juris -- basic jurisdictional thing, agreeing -- this

18

would be a consent to have a court that has no authority

19

to adjudicate a case to adjudicate it.

20

major step is done not by inference, not by implication.

21

This is saying, court, even though you have no authority

22

under the Federal statutes to proceed without our consent,

23

we are consenting, so go ahead.

2

It says that the actions may be transferred for

consolidated pretrial proceedings.

4

5

the only thing that the multi-district panel transferred

6

the case to Western District of Washington for?

7

MR. WAXMAN:

So why couldn't this

Justice Ginsburg, it certainly

8

could have been, and if it were ordered by the court, that

9

is the most that it could have been.

10

But in this case, that's not what it was.

There

11

are parties, claims, and requests for relief, and

12

particularly the -- what is really the object of the

13

litigation, the request for specific performance of the

14

Ford rebate program --

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Waxman, can I interrupt you with

16

a question?

17

that the Federal consolidated complaint was kind of a

18

brand new lawsuit, and we forget about everything else

19

that happened before.

20

It seems to me you're, in effect, arguing

Now, if that were the case and you just had that

21

complaint filed against you and you filed a motion to

22

dismiss and you prevailed and they dismissed the

23

complaint, it clearly would not be appealable.

24

for you to find reasons to appeal, you got to go back and

25

say, well, now we're going to have to face a lot of other

MR. WAXMAN:

2

That -- I think your premise -- the

3

premise of your question, Justice Stevens, with respect,

4

is incorrect, which is if we had asked for a dismissal on

5

subject matter jurisdiction grounds and prevailed -- that

6

is, we would have -QUESTION:

7

No.

They asked for dismissal on

8

subject matter jurisdiction.

9

You're right.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

You're right.

MR. WAXMAN:

10

No.

If we had asked for it, then we

11

would have gotten all that we could possibly have

12

expected.

13

was they voluntarily filed it.

14

judgment on the merits.

15

don't think I have subject matter jurisdiction, and we

16

have the right to appeal that because we are sufficiently

17

aggrieved that we have a stake in the case.

QUESTION:

You would not have been aggrieved --

2

if -- if that was the only case pending and so -- and if

3

it was dismissed, how would you have been aggrieved?
MR. WAXMAN:

4

We would have been aggrieved in the

5

same way -- because what we sought was -- what we wanted

was litigation in a single forum, in a forum which had

already conducted substantial pretrial proceedings and a

Do you -- do you argue that in just

16

an ordinary case if a -- you file -- a defendant files a

17

motion to dismiss both on the grounds of no cause of

18

action and so forth and so on and also no jurisdiction,

19

you win on no jurisdiction, you can appeal that?
MR. WAXMAN:

20

Well, I think, this Court's

21

decision in Forney v. Apfel stands for that proposition.

22

But it would -- this is an easier case because we did not

seek to dismiss this for subject matter jurisdiction

We wanted to be in Federal court.

1

As it turns out, they decided they wanted to be in Federal

2

court too.

3

But there are a long line of cases, and really

4

an uninterrupted line of cases, in the lower courts that

5

have interpreted this Court's jurisprudence in Forney and

6

Guaranty Trust and Electrical Fittings to mean that where

7

there is a dismissal on -- of State law claims, not on the

8

merits, but for lack of jurisdiction, defendants are

9

aggrieved in a practical sense.
QUESTION:

10

And we've discussed a --

Mr. Waxman, I think the problem is

11

those six State court actions that haven't vanished.

12

Nobody ever dismissed them.

13

-- and I agree that you're aggrieved -- you could not

14

appeal from the remand.

15

dismissal of the consolidated complaint, the return of the

16

actions from which this consolidation originated, that

You're not going to do that.

What

10

you're going to say is, defer any action here, if you win

11

on this -- on your point here.

12

any action so we can try the Federal case.

13

MR. WAXMAN:

14

QUESTION:

You're going to say, defer

Well --

And -- and that it seems to me,

15

unless I am missing the point of what you are necessarily

16

going to do, it follows that -- that the -- that the

17

Federal case is, in fact, simply the alter ego of the

18

State cases, and if you win here, you are functionally

19

doing nothing but eliminating subsection (d).

20

MR. WAXMAN:

I -- with respect, Justice Souter,

21

if -- there are plaintiffs in two of the State cases who

are not even named plaintiffs in the Federal case.

are defendants.

a nationwide class.

QUESTION:

Sure, and don't you think those non-

3

named plaintiffs would be happy to let somebody else carry

4

the ball for them in -- in the Federal action?

5

MR. WAXMAN:

6

QUESTION:

Well --

They're -- they're not going to fight

7

you when you say to the State courts, just let them sit

8

here until we get the Federal case taken care of.
MR. WAXMAN:

9

There are -- I'll go to door number

10

two.

There are claims.

There are causes of action in the

11

underlying State cases that are not included in the

12

consolidated complaint and vice versa.

13

the -- from a case management perspective, whether both a

14

Federal case and a State case that are both in existence

15

can go forward simultaneously or whether one should follow

16

the other is something that happens all the time, and it

17

has never been understood to divest one court or the other

18

of jurisdiction.

19

something that is distinctly new.

In short, the --

And our submission here is that we have

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. WAXMAN:

22

QUESTION:

It was --

The consolidated complaint?
Yes.

No, but I mean, you -- but our point

23

is if functionally you are going to treat this as the alt

24

-- the equivalent, the alternative to all of these State

25

actions -- and you have told me nothing to suggest that

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you're not going to do that -- then it seems to me that

2

the -- the -- the argument has got to prevail that

3

functionally this in -- in fact is nothing but an end run

4

around the non-appealability of the remand.

5

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, in point of fact, Justice

6

Souter, if this Court reverses the Ninth Circuit for the

7

-- for -- for one of the two errors of law that it

8

committed, and on remand, the conclusion is made that

9

there is subject matter jurisdiction and the case can

10

proceed, we will be in precisely the same posture that we

11

were in at the time that the plaintiffs filed the

12

consolidated complaint.

13
14
15
16

QUESTION:

No, because at that time the --

the -- the State cases had been remanded.
MR. WAXMAN:

And -- well, the State cases have

not yet been remanded, but if the State --

17

QUESTION:

I -- I mean -- I'm sorry.

18

been -- they had been removed.

19

MR. WAXMAN:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. WAXMAN:

They had

I misspoke.

They had been removed.

They had been removed.
And they will remain removed if

22

this -- if a Federal court concludes that there is subject

23

matter jurisdiction.

24
25

QUESTION:

I thought that the order of the

Western District of Washington was that the State cases

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

are remanded.

2

QUESTION:

That's what I thought.

3

QUESTION:

And that the Ninth Circuit did not

4

touch that, that the Ninth Circuit dealt only with the

5

consolidated complaint.

6

MR. WAXMAN:

There is a single order in the case

7

that says there is no jurisdiction.

And it's in the -- in

8

the joint appendix.

9

jurisdiction over the consolidated complaint or over the

There is no subject matter

10

six removed actions.

11

complaint is dismissed, and the clerk is directed to

12

remand the underlying State actions back to the States.

13

Now, that order was stayed by the Ninth Circuit at our

14

request pending the outcome of this case.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

And therefore, the consolidated

Well, but stayed by the Ninth Circuit

prior to argument there?
MR. WAXMAN:

No.

After -- yes, it was stayed

18

prior to argument there and --

19

QUESTION:

20
21

That is, if --

Well, didn't that stay expire with

the decision of the court of appeals?
MR. WAXMAN:

It would have except that we moved

22

for a stay of the mandate.

The mandate issued before the

23

court ruled on it, and the court then recalled the mandate

24

and directed that the remand of the underlying State

25

actions not proceed until this Court -- at least until

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

ultimately -QUESTION:

But

But I still think -- I still think

4

you're in trouble because even if we accept your -- your

5

reading of what the -- the court ordered and what it's

6

likely to do if you prevail here, it simply changes the

characterization of what's going on.

saying that the -- that if the -- if the consolidated case

follows that the consolidated course is a trump to the

MR. WAXMAN:

15
16

reasons.

Then it simply

Not true, Justice Souter, for two

I'll give the broader one first.
If we had filed as all parties in the case and

17

the Solicitor General as well agree is the complete

18

functional equivalent of the consolidated complaint -- if

19

Ford and Citi had filed a declaratory judgment action in

20

Federal court, even after the State cases had been filed,

21

before or after they had been removed, and we asked for a

22

declaration that we can terminate the Ford rebate program,

there would be no question that --

QUESTION:

Mr. Waxman, give me an example of any

case in which a defendant in a product liability suit, in

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

a credit suit like this one, a defendant has said I want

2

to preempt the class action and so I am going to bring

3

this declaratory suit against all the credit card holders

4

of this plan all over America in the forum that I choose,

5

and that's going to be where the class action is going to

6

proceed.

7

being able to take over what would have ordinarily been

8

the plaintiff's product liability claim, credit card

9

claim?

Can you give me any precedent for a defendant

I -- I don't know of any such case where a

10

defendant has been allowed to make such a case its show

11

rather than the plaintiff's show.
MR. WAXMAN:

12

I -- as I'm standing here, Justice

13

Ginsburg, I -- I can't bring any cases to mind.

I'll --

14

I'll -- I'll -- I'll try and bring one to mind prior to my

15

rebuttal.
But I don't understand what the objection would

16
17

be if, before terminating the program, we said, we're

18

going to terminate this program --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. WAXMAN:

21
22

Because you have --- and we want a declaration

that -QUESTION:

Because, Mr. Waxman, you have

23

potential plaintiffs from all over the country.

Normally

24

a lawsuit is begun by a plaintiff and the plaintiff's

25

choice of forum is respected.

Here you are saying a

1

defendant, not dealing with one plaintiff, but dealing

2

with hundreds, maybe thousands -- I don't know how many

3

credit card holders there are -- across the country can

4

start the lawsuit and a Federal court would listen to

5

that, would, at the defendant's urging, somehow certify

6

the plaintiff class.

7

don't know of any district judge who has done that at the

8

urging of a defendant.

I don't know of any such action.

MR. WAXMAN:

9

I

Well, Justice Ginsburg, if we were

10

to have filed such a case -- and my submission is it would

11

be the functional equivalent of a consolidated complaint

12

-- it would not disempower plaintiffs or plaintiffs'

13

representatives from filing their own class actions in

14

State or Federal court.

15

would then -- there would be -- thereafter be a

16

determination made by the courts involved --

25

Well, in any case you said it --- as to whether it makes sense --

It doesn't occur to you that there is

And if that were the case, there

I am -- I am sure that there are

I can't cite you one as I'm standing

QUESTION:

Where defendant starts the action as

a declaratory action and a class gets certified on the

Alderson Reporting Company

1

plaintiff's side.
MR. WAXMAN:

2

That's correct.

I -- I know that

3

our brief and the red brief and the Solicitor's General

4

brief all address this scenario, but I can't bring to mind

5

the cases.
But just to get back to Justice Souter's

6
7

question again, let me give you the ex -- in terms of

8

whether, if we proceed here, a State case could go forward

9

and -- and would go forward,

If you take, for example,

10

the Alabama case where there's no Alabama plaintiff here,

11

they have not only not sought specific performance, they

12

have disavowed any specific performance and brought

13

separate claims on different theories.

14

sought specific performance, there is no subject matter

15

jurisdiction over the claim because we are -- and this

16

Court basing subject matter jurisdiction on the cost of

17

providing that performance -- the Alabama case can and

18

presumably will go forward.
QUESTION:

19

Since they haven't

Will it go forward without your

20

objection?

Are you representing that -- that you will

21

walk into the Alabama court and say, sure, we're ready to

22

go ahead?
MR. WAXMAN:

23

Under this -- yes.

Under this

24

Court's -- under the Court's current jurisprudence, yes,

25

we would.

The only -- it would only be if this Court were

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to resolve the question it left open in Free v. Abbott

Labs that we would then have some argument, or that the

3

Court determined that punitive damages could be

4

accumulated.

5

performance -- and neither, by the way, are I think four

6

other of the six cases.

7

specific performance, we don't have an argument under this

8

Court's existing case law for keeping the cases there.

9

And they could --

But since they aren't asking for a specific

QUESTION:

10

Since they're not asking for a

How many -- how many -- I'm sorry,

11

but how many other cases like the Alabama case are there?

12

In other words, you -- you say, okay, we'll litigate in

13

Alabama.

14

Any others?
MR. WAXMAN:

I -- I don't know that I have the

15

-- all of the details of the underlying cases in mind.

16

But if they are simply a claim for damages and punitive

17

damages in which the amount in controversy is not $75,000,

18

and they aren't asking for specific performance, I don't

19

think, consistent with the law of this case, we would have

20

any basis for objecting to them going forward.

21

QUESTION:

They all ask for compensation.

There

22

are none of them that ask just for specific performance,

23

and -- and even in this consolidated complaint, the first

24

thing that they ask for is compensatory damages.

25

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, it's -- it is clear, Justice

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Ginsburg -- and if it isn't clear from the complaint, it

2

is utterly clear from the -- from the plaintiffs' red

3

brief in this case at page 45 that what they -- the object

4

of this litigation is reinstatement of the national Ford

5

credit rebate program under which they can earn credits

6

toward the purchase of a Ford vehicle.

7

They -- they're -- they don't -- none of these

8

plaintiffs have a liquidated claim for damages because

9

they're not asking that they be paid rebates that they

10

earned and weren't paid.

11

They are all asking for reinstatement of a program, which

12

doesn't exist, that will allow them to earn credits, based

13

on purchases, toward the purchase of a vehicle.

14

Those were credited to them.

And on the -- on the question of subject matter

15

jurisdiction, the court below made two errors of law.

16

First, it held incorrectly that class actions joining

17

separate and distinct claims for injunctive relief cannot

18

be viewed from the defendants' -- cannot be valued from

19

the defendants' viewpoint.

20

concluding that the plaintiffs' interest in specific

21

performance cannot be viewed as common and undivided.

22

And secondly, it erred in

And if the Court has no questions at this time,

23

I'd like to reserve the balance of my time and perhaps

24

address the merits on rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE W. BERMAN

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

4
5
6

MR. BERMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I will turn to the question that's taken the

7

balance of the argument so far and that is whether this

8

Court has jurisdiction.

9

reluctance that Mr. Waxman did because the underlying

And I do so with the same

10

question is an important question that has troubled courts

11

dealing with class actions for some time now.

12

But despite the fact that I'd like the Court to

13

answer that question, I don't think there was jurisdiction

14

on appeal or -- or before this Court because it's quite

15

clear that no matter how you artfully look at this, this

16

is a simple situation that's subject to 1407(c) and (d)

17

which this Court has said commands -- and that's in the

18

Grauded case -- unmistakably commands that where there is

19

a remand, based on the lack of subject matter

20

jurisdiction, that that's not reviewable.

21

QUESTION:

I -- it was your clients, Mr. Berman,

22

who filed the consolidated complaint in the Western

23

District, I take it.

24

MR. BERMAN:

25

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And who was it that moved to dismiss

24
Alderson Reporting Company

that complaint?
MR. BERMAN:

No one moved to dismiss that

complaint.

5

the various different States that were invoked by that

motion, said to us, I'm issuing an order to show cause why

of jurisdiction.

And number two, what is your response?

MR. BERMAN:

16

I think you are understanding his

17

argument correctly, but I submit that he's incorrect.

18

It's not a new case.

19

there's no authority under the MDL rules for us to just

20

say this is a whole new case.

MR. BERMAN:

It was before the district

It is not uncommon in MDL practice

In fact,

But didn't it do more than just

13

organize the pleadings?

14

causes of action and look like a whole new ball of wax?

15

MR. BERMAN:

Didn't it change parties and

Well, there were some

16

representative changes because after all the lawyers

17

across the country got together for the first time,

18

because we were thrown together, some of those lawyers

19

said, if you're going to move for class certification of a

20

nationwide class in one of these State court cases, maybe

There's

We just hold everything else until this one is

MR. BERMAN:

Well, there's a Federal case for

7

pretrial purposes, and the judge, Judge Dwyer of the lower

court, found he had no jurisdiction anymore over that case

which is proceeding in Federal court.

But it's a

It looks like a normal complaint.

So is it ordinary MDL practice that what happens

3

when you transfer things for pretrial proceedings, the

lawyers get together and file what to the naked eye looks

5

exactly like a normal complaint, as if they marched into

normal MDL practice?

2

-- an order to send it back not to the States but to the

MR. BERMAN:

Actually I think the language of

5

the order is that the cases are remanded back to the State

courts.

QUESTION:

To the State courts.

8

MR. BERMAN:

9

QUESTION:

That must be wrong, mustn't it?

10

MR. BERMAN:

Yes.

That's correct.

It should go to the transferor

districts.

MR. BERMAN:

specifically and that is pursuant to the MDL order, which

we can review, can we not?

MR. BERMAN:

Yes, you can.

Okay.

So we would have the power in

districts, even though they said it wrong.

Not at all.

If, after

all, an order of the MDL panel were to have an underlying

theory that there wasn't jurisdiction in some court or

provided, review it.

To the State courts.

That is -- that is not what he

meant.
QUESTION:

All right.

That is a problem.

I see

6

that as a problem, but I don't know if it's an insuperable

7

problem --

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. BERMAN:

And the problem I have, Justice

10

Breyer, is that I would like to agree with your argument

11

because, as you pointed out, this is something that's

12

plaguing the courts.

13

QUESTION:

All right.

The way it would have

14

worked if they had gotten -- hadn't said remand to State

15

courts, is they would have sent it back to transferor

16

districts.

17

with this judge, some would have come to other

18

conclusions, and we plainly could have reviewed the ones

19

that came to other conclusions so we could have decided

20

the issue.

21

should happen?

22

Some transferor districts would have agreed

So is that what you think should happen?

MR. BERMAN:

What

Well, I would like the Court to

23

review the underlying merits, but to do so, I think you

24

have to do some gamesmanship and do injustice to 1407.

25

QUESTION:

Isn't, Mr. Berman, what --

QUESTION:

Justice Breyer told you that -- said

2

that it would have to go back to the State courts.

3

the question is what is the it.

4

of the action that was instituted by the consolidated

5

complaint.

6

MR. BERMAN:

7

QUESTION:

But

You have to first dispose

That was disposed of.

But that's the only thing we're

8

arguing about here, and the arg -- and the contention is

9

it was improperly disposed of and that it was disposed of

10

on a basis that injures the defendants and that they can

11

appeal that because they're aggrieved under the cases that

12

Mr. Waxman cites.

13

And that's all we're talking about.

MR. BERMAN:

And I understand that, Justice

14

Kennedy, but the case that Mr. Waxman cites and the cases

15

he cites for the proposition that an aggrieved party can

16

appeal, I don't quarrel with that.

17

The problem with that authority in this case is

18

that none of those cases that he cites are cases where

19

there's been a dismissal, which there was in this case, of

20

the consolidated complaint on the grounds of a lack of

21

subject matter jurisdiction.

And --

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Berman, I think something needs

23

clarification here.

24

district case like this makes a pretrial order,

25

determination, decision, and on the basis of that, those

When a district judge in a multi-

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

cases go back to the district courts from whence they

2

came, that ruling is not up for grabs in the individual

3

district courts.

That is the law of the case that they

4

all must follow.

And as I understand the Western District

5

of Washington decision, that there was no subject matter

6

jurisdiction, that would not be open for contest in the

7

district courts.
MR. BERMAN:

8
9

I -- I agree with that.

It would

go to the district courts pursuant to proper MDL practice.

10

We would move for enforcement of the judge's order

11

remanding the case, but we couldn't fight that issue of

12

subject matter jurisdiction because it would have been

13

decided -QUESTION:

14

Okay.

So -- so that if that had

15

happened -- going back to an answer you gave earlier, if

16

that had happened, and -- and the -- the missing step had

17

been included and it said, back to the transferor court,

18

the only thing that could have happened with the

19

transferor court, the jurisdictional issue having been

20

decided in the Western District of Washington, would be to

21

remand.

22

MR. BERMAN:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. BERMAN:

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Yeah, okay.
And -- and because of that --

May -- may I ask?

Mr. Waxman pointed

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

out to us that this order was actually stayed by the

2

district court and by the Ninth Circuit, and I don't find

3

the stay order in the appendix.

4

record, as he points out.

5

that stay and the -- the both -- in both the district

6

court and the court of appeals, did anyone point out to

7

either of those courts that the order was defective for --

8

for failing to -- to include the transferor court rather

9

than going direct to the State court?

MR. BERMAN:

MR. BERMAN:

I think the Court would like to.

1

MR. BERMAN:

Very briefly then.

This Court has,

2

since the Judiciary Act of 1789 was passed, consistently

3

construed diversity jurisdiction so as to avoid expanding

4

the Federal caseload.

5

Harris.

6

petitioners that you can use administrative costs in

7

satisfying the amount in controversy would vastly expand

8

the Federal caseload in two ways.

That's the teaching of Snyder v.

The proposition that's asserted here today by the

QUESTION:

9

Is your objection just to the concept

10

of administrative costs, Mr. Berman, or to the idea that

11

it can be compute -- the amount in controversy can be

12

computed at all from the defendants' point of view?
MR. BERMAN:

13

Mr. Chief Justice, my answer to

14

that is I think that the Court could adopt a rule allowing

15

the amount in controversy to be determined from either

16

viewpoint, both from the plaintiffs' viewpoint or from the

17

defendants' viewpoint.

18

question.

19

But that doesn't answer the

The -- the question really presented then is how

20

do we value that amount.

And this Court's teachings I

21

think have answered that question, and that is in the Hunt

22

case, the Court has ruled and has consistently followed

23

this proposition, that it is well established that the

24

amount in controversy is measured by the value of the

25

object of the litigation.

And so, another way the Court

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

has put it is what right does the plaintiff seek to have

2

enforced here.

The --

QUESTION:

3

In a -- in a couple of those quotes,

4

you know, taken out of context, they seem to support your

5

position.

6

But the Court wasn't really faced with the issue here.

7

They certainly don't controvert your position.

MR. BERMAN:

I -- I think the Court has never

8

squarely been faced with the issue of should the

9

plaintiff's rule be adopted or not.

There is suggestions

10

that it should be, but I think what the Court has been

11

consistent on is looking at the value of the object of

12

litigation from the point of view, what is it that the

13

plaintiff wants, not what are the incidental costs to the

14

defendant.

15

it's an old case, but the Ross case and the Elliott case

16

squarely hold that jurisdiction does not depend upon any

17

contingent injuries or damage to a defendant in a case.

18

In fact, there is a case -- and I -- I know

And if the rule is otherwise -- and by the way,

19

I think there's a big difference, for the purposes of this

20

Court's review, of an administrative cost versus

21

injunctive relief.

22

administrative cost.

23

So let me first focus on

The mischief, I think, of allowing

24

administrative cost to be considered is illustrated by an

25

earlier Ninth Circuit decision in Snow v. Ford.

And there

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the plaintiff sought an injunction because Ford had sold a

2

trailer package without an $11 wiring kit.

3

argued then, as it does now, that because it would have to

4

incur substantial costs in supplying this $11 kit, that

5

there was Federal jurisdiction.

And Ford

Well, the value of the object of litigation from

6
7

the plaintiffs' point of view, if you can't aggregate,

8

which under Snyder v. Harris you can't, is $11.

9

Court is going to allow administrative cost to be

If the

10

considered, then this Court is going to have hundreds --

11

Federal courts are going to have hundreds of $11 cases in

12

front of them.
And I think Judge Posner hit the nail right on

13
14

the head in the Brand Name Prescription Drug case, in

15

which he said that if the costs of compliance were

16

considered, then every case, virtually every case, quote,

17

however trivial would cross the threshold.
QUESTION:

18

Why shouldn't they have it if in fact

19

it really does cost the defendant the $75,000, however you

20

categorize it?

21

those cases?

Why shouldn't the Federal courts hear

MR. BERMAN:

22

Because consistently this Court has

23

looked at the value of the right to be protected and

24

excluded such incidental costs.

25

there --

QUESTION:

There might be a legal argument

2

there, but I thought you were making a policy argument

3

that it was a bad thing.

4

MR. BERMAN:

5

QUESTION:

Well, I do -- I do --

And I don't see why that's so if in

6

fact in most cases I think that if it's going to cost

7

$75,000 for an $11 claim, if it's really just one claim,

8

the defendant will settle it.

9

really just one claim, but really involves class actions

And, of course, if it's not

10

involving many hundreds of claims, that's just what's

11

supposed to be in the Federal court.
MR. BERMAN:

12
13

Snyder and the non-aggregation -QUESTION:

14
15

Well, then you'd have to overrule

There's a legal -- you're making a

purely legal argument then.
MR. BERMAN:

16

Yes, which -- which they're not

17

advocating.

But from a policy argument, my argument is

18

that you would suddenly thrust the Federal courts in

19

determination of what basically are State -- routine State

20

law matters.
QUESTION:

21

But that's what -- that's what this

22

Class Action Fairness Act, which has considerable support,

23

that's pending in Congress -- it's still pending, isn't

24

it?

25

MR. BERMAN:

That's correct.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

That's what it would do.

It would

2

allow -- if -- if the price tag of all these small claims

3

for the defendant was more than the amount in controversy

4

-- well, I think it puts a much higher price tag than

5

$75,000.

6

action bill that's pending in Congress, to put all these

7

cases, to aggregate them if the total dollar amount for

8

the defendant is very high.

9

But anyway, that -- that's the idea of the class

MR. BERMAN:

That's correct.

That -- it's $2

10

million, the new proposed limit, and it would allow

11

aggregation, which this Court so far has not allowed.

12

Congress realizes under existing precedent that what the

13

-- Ford wants to do here is not permitted.

14

QUESTION:

Well, is -- is -- is there a -- is

15

there a distinction to be made along these lines?

16

-- I may not be able to -- to state what I'm trying to

17

work out in my mind, but here -- here's -- here's the

18

distinction I'm trying to -- to get at.

19

So

And I

Let's assume that the -- that the only issue is

20

-- is an issue in one case.

They didn't give the $11

21

taillight or whatever it was.

22

bureaucracy of a big company, in order to provide the one

23

$11 tail light, it's going to cost $100,000 to galvanize

24

everybody into action and get the tail light.

25

argument in that case.

And because of the

I see your

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

There's a difference, though, in this case

2

because what they're saying in this case is they promised

3

that they would have a kind of administrative system in

4

place that would take account of all these various credit

5

charge card -- credit card charges and -- and would --

6

would ultimately result in -- in this -- this credit of up

7

to $3,500 for our benefit.

8

aggrieved by their failure to do it aren't all claiming

9

$3,500.

The various people who are

You know, they may be claiming everything from $5

10

to $3,500.

The only way to satisfy our -- our -- the

11

claims of all these people who are in the class is to put

12

the system in place.

13

If that's the essence of their claim, they're

14

not saying we want you to incur a lot of administrative

15

costs in order to get to a particular result, which is

16

jurisdictionally insufficient.

17

agreed you would do.

They're saying, we want

The system is not an administrative

It's what you promised in the first place.

The

Is that a fair distinction, and does -- does
that count against you?
MR. BERMAN:

That's their argument, and I don't

24

think it counts against my position for two reasons.

In

25

order to make that argument, what they're really doing is

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

aggregating what it would cost to reinstitute the system

2

as if they were going to pay all 6 million class -QUESTION:

3

But the system is not an aggregated

4

system.

There's either a system or there isn't a system.

5

If there is a system, it produces different results

6

depending on the kind of business that individuals do.

7

But the system is not a separate system for all of the

8

members of the class which is being aggregated.

9

system to fulfill one promise which was made in common

It's a

10

form to the entire class.

11

which removes it from this notion simply of administrative

12

cost?

13

MR. BERMAN:

And isn't that a distinction

No, because right now there are

14

just six plaintiffs.

This is not a class.

And those six

15

plaintiffs may have a total of $20,000 at stake.

16

has to do to satisfy their claim in this case is to give

17

those six people the rebates.

is to aggregate this case, which they can't do.

Let me ask you a philosophical

Let me ask you a contrary-to-fact question.

They

Mr. Waxman got into epistemology a minute ago.

If in fact the Federal action were a class

16

action and it included everybody who had been included in

17

the State class actions and specific performance had been

18

requested in the form that I suggested, would that not

19

take it out of the aggregation problem and -- and --

20

and -- and satisfy the jurisdictional amount, even on your

21

own theory?

22

MR. BERMAN:

No, because under the analysis of

23

-- of this Court and the Gilman court in the Second

24

Circuit and the Ninth Circuit, again because each person

25

had a separate right, as they've admitted.

They've

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

admitted that for damage purposes each person had a

2

separate and distinct claim.

3

QUESTION:

4

specific performance purposes.

5

Yeah, but that's not the same as for

MR. BERMAN:

It is.

If -- if I -- if one of my

6

plaintiffs decides he no longer wants to be in this

7

litigation, they have don't have to up the specific

8

9

right to the rebates they were entitled to.

16

No.

before anything happened.

So we have -- you need the

aggregation of the class action.

have an uncertified class here.

20

That's correct.

You have an -- you

The other danger I'll touch on in my last minute

21

of allowing the injunctive -- amount it would cost the

22

defendant, either by way of injunction or administrative

23

cost, is that plaintiffs could use this new theory to

24

invoke Federal court jurisdiction.

25

suggest that plaintiffs never want to be in Federal court.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

That's not correct.

2

anytime I have a case where I want to be in Federal court,

3

where I normally could not be in Federal court -- and I

4

have many such cases right now -- I would just simply have

5

to say in my prayer for relief that the -- the injunction

6

would cost the defendant more than $75,000.

7

have a whole new rule and there's a whole new group of

8

Federal cases that suddenly would arise.

9

If you adopt the petitioners' rule,

And bingo, I

So in closing, unless there's any questions, the

10

problem with the defendants' -- the petitioners' position

11

in this case is that it would open up the flood gates of

12

litigation to the Federal court system.

13

Institute study that about 65 percent of the country's

14

class actions are in State courts, and to adopt their rule

15

would mean that many of those, probably thousands of

16

cases, that are now residing in State courts would

17

suddenly find their way into Federal courts.

18

is not consistent with this Court's policy of strictly

19

construing the diversity statute and giving deference to

20

State courts and State governments with respect to laws

that they have the power to enact and to have those cases
