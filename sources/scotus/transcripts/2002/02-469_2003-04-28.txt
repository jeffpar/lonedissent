ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEE T. PATERSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. PATERSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Ninth Circuit has adopted a treating

12

physician rule in ERISA cases which requires the plan

13

administrator to either accept the opinion of a treating

14

physician or to reject that opinion by specific legitimate

15

reasons based upon substantial evidence.

16

Circuit says that this rule gives special weight,

17

deference, and a presumption to the opinions of treating

18

physicians.

19

The Ninth

The failure to follow this rule has two effects.

20

First, a finding that the plan administrator has a

21

conflict of interest which mandates de novo review, and

22

secondly, on de novo review, that the plan administrator's

23

decision was not reasonable.

24

The Ninth Circuit's --

25

QUESTION:

Now, the Secretary has adopted some

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

requirements of explanation of reasons where the

2

physicians differ in their views.

3

Secretary done something of the sort?
MR. PATERSON:

4

Has -- has the

The Secretary has adopted

5

regulations, which were effective in January 1 of 2002,

6

which require a plan administrator to obtain the opinion

7

of an expert medical professional to -- to advise him

8

regarding medical opinions and to be able to provide an

9

expert medical opinion to the claimant if he requests it.

10

That would not apply, of course, to this case since this

11

claim was filed in 1997.
QUESTION:

12

And is there a requirement to give

13

reasons if there is a difference of views between the

14

treating physician and the expert?

15

MR. PATERSON:

No.

There is no requirement to

16

provide reasons to -- or between the two physicians'

17

opinions.

18

and the regulations that a plan administrator explain the

19

reasons for his denial of a claim.

There has always been a requirement under ERISA

20

QUESTION:

And this claim was denied?

21

MR. PATERSON:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. PATERSON:

This claim was denied.

Were the reasons given in this case?
Yes, they were, Your Honor.

They

24

were given by the plan administrator in writing to the

25

claimant.

He told the claimant that he was, in fact,

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

denying the claim based on the opinion of Dr. Mitri.
He told them he was denying the claim because he

2
3

did not meet the plan definition of total -- I'm sorry --

4

complete inability to perform the job of a material

5

planner.
He told them that part of the reason for denying

6
7

the claim was the fact that the plan administrator had

8

asked the claimant to please have his treating physicians

9

comment on the opinion of Dr. Mitri.

He did that twice.

10

He did it in writing.

And in neither case did the

11

respondent respond with any -- from the treating

12

physicians -- with any response from their -- the treating

13

physicians.
And he also did it on the basis that Janmarie

14
15

Forward's opinion, who was a human resource

16

representative, was not -- did not change his opinion.

17

there were those --

18

QUESTION:

So

And -- and under the Secretary's

19

rules, if there is in fact a conflict of interest, it can

20

be weighed in making that ultimate resolution by the

21

court?

22

MR. PATERSON:

No.

There's -- there's nothing

23

in the -- if you mean the Secretary of Labor's rules,

24

there's nothing in the Secretary of Labor's rules which

25

relates to any weighing of a conflict of interest by the

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

plan administrator.

2

of Firestone v. Bruch in which the Court in that case said

3

that if the plan administrator -QUESTION:

9

This Court has suggested that a

conflict of interest can be weighed.
MR. PATERSON:

6
7

There is a -- a provision in the case

This Court said that in Firestone

v. Bruch.
And -- but the question in that case that has
been not -- it has not been decided in that case and which

10

has created a conflict of interest of -- I'm sorry -- a

11

conflict among the circuits is the question of what does

12

it mean to weigh.

13

interest, or does it mean to conflict of interest against

14

the reasonableness of the decision?

15

Does it mean to weigh the conflict of

The Second Circuit has said it means to weigh

16

the conflict of interest as provided in Restatement 187,

17

and after you weigh the conflict of interest, you then

18

move on to the reasonableness of the decision.

19

The Ninth -- the Ninth and the Eleventh Circuits

20

have said it means that you weigh the decision, and if you

21

-- the conflict -- and if you find there is a conflict,

22

then you find that the decision of the plan administrator

23

is presumptively void.

24
25

And the remainder of the circuits have adopted
something called the sliding scale test where you weigh

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

both the conflict and the -- the reasonableness of the

2

decision at the same time.
This Court commented on that issue, I believe,

3
4

in Rush v. Moran when the Court said, how can you give

5

deference to the opinion of a treating physician -- I'm

6

sorry -- of a plan administrator at the same time that you

7

are looking for conflict of interest?
We would submit, if I may, Your Honor, that the

8
9

way to do that is to first look for conflict of interest

10

in -- in the -- the way that Restatement 187 does that.

11

You first test for conflict of interest.

12

conflict of interest, then this potential conflict of

13

interest, what this Court called a potential conflict of

14

interest, goes away.

It is a nothing.

MR. PATERSON:

QUESTION:

The Ninth Circuit in a

I didn't mean to --

-- and -- and in Regula seems to set

23

up a two-tier system or a dichotomy of an administrator

24

who is a fiduciary and an administrator who's not.

should think -- tell me, maybe I'm incorrect -- that your

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

I

1

position is that the treating physician rule is an

2

inappropriate approach in either instance.

3

MR. PATERSON:

There's no question about that.

4

I didn't mean to argue for a difference in -- in the

5

standard of review.

to this Court on a petition.

Justice O'Connor's question.

10
11

QUESTION:

We haven't -- we haven't brought that
I merely meant to respond to

But I take it your point is that in

-- in either context, the treating physician rule is
inappropriate.
MR. PATERSON:

Absolutely.

There's no question

12

in our -- in our position to this Court that the treating

13

physician rule is an inappropriate rule under either -- of

14

any of those tests.

15

QUESTION:

Am -- am I --

16

QUESTION:

If you are correct in -- in that

17

regard, it would go back to the Ninth Circuit and there

18

would still remain the question on which you didn't seek

19

review, and that is, just how do you handle this conflict

20

of interest?

21

where it was.

22

I presume the Ninth Circuit would go back to

MR. PATERSON:

I believe that that's correct,

23

Your Honor.

What would happen is we would go back to

24

where we would have been if the treating physician rule

25

didn't exist.

The Ninth Circuit would be using its

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

presumptively void test, would look to see if the -- the

2

claimant had produced any probative material evidence of a

3

conflict of interest, which actually affected the decision

4

as opposed to just a potential conflict of interest.

5

they found that, they would find that the decision of the

6

plan administrator was presumptively void.

7

find that, then that issue would drop from the case and

8

they would then test the -- the decision of a plan

9

administrator based on abuse of discretion standard.
QUESTION:

10

If

If they didn't

But their analysis would be different

11

in one respect, I take it, and that is in -- in the case

12

as they considered it first, the -- the refusal to follow

13

a treating physician rule was taken itself as evidence of

14

conflict.

Is that correct?
MR. PATERSON:

15

Yes.

The Ninth Circuit held that

16

the refusal to follow a treating -- the treating

17

physician's opinion or to fail to rebut that opinion by

18

specific legitimate reasons was a material probative

19

evidence of a -- tending to prove an actual conflict of

20

interest which -- which affected the --

21

QUESTION:

MR. PATERSON:

I -- we would certainly -- we

certainly intend it to be different if -- if we can.
QUESTION:

25

So the result might be different.

void?

Did -- did they say presumptively

I -- I had thought that what they -- what they said

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

was if they found an actual conflict, they simply would

2

give no deference and would review de novo as though the

3

question was up to them.

4

MR. PATERSON:

The -- the test in the literature

5

is called the presumptively void test.

6

the Ninth Circuit calls it the presumptively void test.

7

They -- they call it the Atwood test, the Atwood v.

8

Newmont Gold test.

9

QUESTION:

I don't believe

I don't care what they call it.

I

10

want to know what the consequence is.

11

consequence held by the Ninth Circuit was that if they did

12

find the actual conflict, they would give no deference to

13

the plan administrator's decision and would review the

14

question de novo as though it was up to them.

15

MR. PATERSON:

I thought the

Yes, and in that sense it would

16

-- they would be void.

17

issue comes in this sense, Your Honor.

18

claimant comes forward with material probative evidence of

19

a conflict tending to show a conflict of interest under

20

the Ninth Circuit's test, the Ninth Circuit says that

21

there is a rebuttable presumption created and that the

22

burden is then on the plan administrator to come forward

23

with evidence and to rebut that material probative

24

evidence that there is an actual conflict of interest.

25

QUESTION:

I think the presumptively void
When the -- if the

But we take the case on the theory

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

that that's governing in this case?

2

MR. PATERSON:

3

QUESTION:

I mean, you didn't --

Yes.

-- seek -- seek review of it.

It's

4

just the treating physician rule that you want us to talk

5

about.

6

MR. PATERSON:

That's correct.

I -- I don't --

7

I've been asked these questions, but we're not arguing the

8

issue of standard --

9

QUESTION:

It is difficult for me to get to the

10

thing when I have a kind of basic confusion in my mind,

11

which I have.

12

interest thing from start to finish.

13

-- why is it -- why is it any different to have a trustee

14

in -- in this kind of a case who hires an insurance

15

company to look to see whether the people are disabled or

16

not than to have a trustee who hires an insurance company

17

to run the whole plan?

I don't understand this conflict of
That is to say, why

18

And anyway, why is that different from a trustee

19

who, say, runs a classical trust and has to decide -- call

20

it a spendthrift trust -- whether to give the beneficiary

21

$1,000 this month and have less in the -- in the corpus or

22

to give him $800 this month and have more in the corpus,

23

which might, by the way, grow to help other beneficiaries?

24

So I -- I don't understand it basically and I've

25

read enough to know that I really don't.

MR. PATERSON:

Thank you, Justice Breyer.

I --

I hope that I can -- I can help.
In section 187 of the Restatement of Trusts, it

3
4

talks about a potential conflict of interest, the

5

possibility of a conflict of interest.

6

Court talked about that in Firestone v. Bruch.

7

potential conflict of interest is not a conflict of

8

interest.

9

reviewing any trustee, ERISA or not, if they thought there

It's just the possibility.

And this -- this
That

And any court

10

might be a conflict of interest, would look for that

11

conflict of interest and see if there was --

12

QUESTION:

What could it consist of?

13

MR. PATERSON:

It might consist in an ERISA case

14

of some direction from the president of the company to the

15

trustee to cut back on benefit costs.

16

QUESTION:

I see.

17

MR. PATERSON:

I see.

That would be -- then he would

18

not be representing the -- the members of the plan and he

19

would be breaching his fiduciary duty.

20

QUESTION:

What if there's no such directive,

21

but the plan is set up in such a fashion that it's

22

employer-funded and the higher the benefit costs are, the

23

-- the more the employer pays, and hence the less profits

24

the employer has?

25

MR. PATERSON:

That's -- I'm sorry.

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Is that just a potential conflict of

2

interest or is that an actual conflict of interest when

3

the plan administrator is -- is an agent of the employer?
MR. PATERSON:

4

Under this Court's rule -- or

5

decision in Firestone and in -- under the Ninth Circuit's

6

decision, that is only a potential conflict of interest.

7

There has to be material probative evidence of an actual

8

conflict of interest which affected his decision.
QUESTION:

9
10

It's using conflict of interest in a

-- in a strange sense, it seems to me.

11

MR. PATERSON:

12

QUESTION:

It -- well --

There's certainly a conflict of

13

interest there.

14

but he's an agent of the employer, and the more he gives

15

to the employees, the less there is for the employer.

16

would call that a conflict of interest, but -- but that is

17

not, for purposes of these cases, a conflict of interest.

18

That is a potential conflict.
MR. PATERSON:

19
20

He's supposed to represent the employees,

I

That is a potential conflict of

interest.
QUESTION:

21

It seems to me they're not really

22

talking about a conflict of interest.

They're talking

23

about -- what should I say?

24

trustee was not acting in the -- in the employees' best

25

interest.

Evidence that -- that the

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. PATERSON:

And I think that should be the --

2

the criteria that the court has to look for in each of

3

these cases to decide whether the trustee is actually

4

conflicted or not.
QUESTION:

5

Can we get back to the question that

6

you did raise?

Why should there be a difference in the

7

Social Security standard, which does apply this treating

8

physician rule and disability?

9

both cases is whether this person is unable to work.

10

MR. PATERSON:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. PATERSON:

Both -- the question in

There is a -- I'm sorry.

Yes.
There's a tremendous difference

13

in the Social Security standard as formulated by the

14

regulations of the Social Security Administration and the

15

Ninth Circuit's treating physician rule in Social Security

16

cases as formulated by the Ninth Circuit and ERISA cases.

17

Perhaps I can point out a couple of those things.
First, the Social Security Administration has a

18
19

regulation, which it has adopted, which provides for a set

20

of criteria to be reviewed by the administrative law

21

judge.

22

physician's -- the treating physician's opinion,

23

determining whether that opinion is well supported by

24

clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques, seeing if

25

it's not inconsistent with other substantial evidence,

Those criteria include the -- looking at the

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

looking at the length of the treatment relationship and

2

the frequency of the examination, and other criteria.

3

Once the administrative law judge goes through

4

those criteria and determines each one of those positively

5

towards the treating physician, he then may, or she may

6

then, if they wish, provide conclusive weight to the

7

opinion of the treating physician.

8
9

The Ninth Circuit's rule is completely different
than that.

The Ninth Circuit's rule says that if a person

10

is a treating physician, then the plan administrator

11

either has to accept that rule -- that -- that opinion or

12

has to rebut it.

13

Circuit rule could be a -- somebody at a local well care

14

center and you walk in and get a shot.

15

treating physician.

16

which, under the Ninth Circuit's rule, gives you a -- a

17

presumptive weight.

18

QUESTION:

A treating physician under the Ninth

That makes you a

Now you have an opinion which you --

But I take it, you would not be happy

19

with -- if we said, well, the Ninth Circuit went too far,

20

but it should be set up just like the Social Security

21

because, as I understand it, this employee did get Social

22

Security disability.

23

MR. PATERSON:

Well, we don't know that for a

24

fact, Your Honor.

There is a statement in the -- in the

25

statement of facts by the respondent in their opposition

So that's -- that is open to him to

MR. PATERSON:

10

Yes.

He may go back to the --

11

the plan administrator -- this case is still open because

12

it's on appeal -- and tell the plan administrator I have

13

this new evidence.

14

since July the 15th of 1997 and I would like you to

15

consider that evidence.

16

do that.
QUESTION:

17

And the plan administrator will

I suppose there's something to be

18

said for the proposition that if you have this private

19

system, you don't necessarily want to bring in all the

20

bureaucratic trappings of the Social Security review

21

process.
MR. PATERSON:

22

Well, I think that's absolutely

23

right, because one of the congressional purposes in ERISA

24

is to encourage employers to adopt voluntary disability

25

plans.

And the Social Security administrative regulations

16
Alderson Reporting Company

were -- are regulations which have been adopted by the

8

evidence for the plan administrator to consider even

9

though it's using a -- a mandated standard of respect for

10

the treating physician's determination which does not

11

exist under the plan?
MR. PATERSON:

12

I think it is evidence.

I think

13

the first thing the plan administrator would do is to look

14

at the medical opinions which were submitted along with

15

that report and look at the actual decision of the

administrative law judge.

Ms. Blatt, did the Secretary consider

adopting a rule like CA9 has imposed?
MS. BLATT:

No, Justice O'Connor.

What the

19

Secretary has done has -- is -- has not opposed -- imposed

20

a treating physician requirement or otherwise constrained

21

plan administrators in the way --

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

Yes.

I know the Secretary has not.

Did the Secretary consider alternatives?
MS. BLATT:

They didn't consider a treating

physician rule, but what the Department of Labor did do

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

was impose a series of requirements to ensure fair and

2

accurate decisionmaking.

3

fair review of a claim, and they have to consider all

4

evidence submitted by the claimant.

5

medical judgments, they have to consult with a health care

6

professional with the relevant training and experience.

7

QUESTION:

So plans must conduct a full and

And before making any

The question was when they did that,

8

did they even think of the treating physician rule?

9

anybody say to the Department, maybe we should have one?

10
11

Did

No, I don't think we will.
MS. BLATT:

No.

There's no evidence that they

12

considered it.

13

for 2002 and did impose a lot of requirements, and they

14

took a very different approach.

15

that constrained plan administrators in weighing evidence.

16

Instead, they said, you have to consider all the relevant

17

evidence and make an independent judgment.

18

finally required that the specific reasons have to be

19

given for any denial in a manner that's calculated to be

20

understood by the claimant.

21

what that means is it has to be in sufficient detail to

22

permit meaningful judicial review for an abuse of

23

discretion.

24
25

But they did overhaul their regulations

They didn't do anything

And then they

And in the Department's view,

But the Ninth Circuit takes a very different and
categorical approach that singles out treating physician

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

evidence and has a requirement that reasons have to be

2

given if the administrator is not going to defer to that

3

evidence.

4

QUESTION:

Maybe the Ninth Circuit was trying to

5

spark for ERISA the same thing that the courts did for

6

Social Security.

7

is, the treating physician rule -- that started with the

8

courts and then the -- the Commissioner said, okay, we'll

9

adopt it as part of our regulations.

10
11

The Social Security -- whatever the rule

But didn't it begin

with the courts?
MS. BLATT:

It began with the courts, and they

12

-- most of them did impose some requirement and some

13

outright rejected it because they thought Congress had

14

entrusted the ALJ as the finder of fact with the

15

responsibility to weigh conflicting evidence.

16

Commissioner, in order to bring uniformity in this massive

17

nationwide Government program, adopted a less aggressive,

18

deferential rule in its regulations.

19

And the

But the Department of Labor has not adopted any

20

such rule.

Rather, the Department of Labor's regulations

21

are consistent with the background presumption that the

22

trier of fact has the responsibility in each particular

23

case to weigh conflicting evidence based on her judgment

24

of the relative merits of the evidence.

25

Department of Labor, as I said, has a very different set

And -- but the

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

of requirements that don't -- that leave -- that are

2

consistent with that background rule and don't constrain

3

plan administrators.
QUESTION:

4

Does the -- do the Department

5

regulations have some sort of a threshold test for whether

6

there's a conflict of interest or is that just not

7

addressed?
MS. BLATT:

8
9

No.

The Department of --

regulations don't speak to the question of a conflict at

10

all.

11

conflict must be weighed as a factor in determining

12

whether there's been an abuse of discretion.

13

What this Court said in Firestone was that a

QUESTION:

And Firestone, as I recall, just

14

recognized that the plan administrator can wear two hats,

15

be employer some times and -- and a fiduciary at others.

16

MS. BLATT:

That's right.

But under Firestone,

17

if the employer both funds the plan and administers the

18

plan, we think that's the type of conflict that can be

19

considered as a factor in whether there's been an abuse of

20

discretion.

21

QUESTION:

So Firestone was using conflict of

22

interest in -- in a different sense from the sense in

23

which it was used here.

24
25

MS. BLATT:

The courts have differed widely, in

the wake of Firestone, of what this Court meant in

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Firestone.

The majority of the lower courts have not

2

taken the Ninth Circuit's approach.

3

still an abuse of discretion review, but there's a more

4

searching inquiry into whether there's been an abuse of

5

discretion if the plan administrator is operating under a

6

conflict.

7

Now, that is not --

8

QUESTION:

They have said it's

By which it means not evidence that

9

he was instructed to -- to keep down costs, but the mere

10

fact that the employer is both the funder of the plan and

11

responsible for administration of the plan.

12

MS. BLATT:

13

QUESTION:

14

MS. BLATT:

That's correct.
That alone is a conflict.
That's the type of conflict that can

15

be considered as a factor in conducting whether there's an

16

abuse of discretion.

17

Now, however that plays out in a given case, our

18

point is that you shouldn't have a special rule that's

19

limited to treating physician evidence.

20

inappropriate under ERISA for three reasons, and I think

21

I've already said two of them --

22

QUESTION:

What does treating physician evidence

23

have to do with a conflict?

24

really don't understand.

25

MS. BLATT:

And we think it's

That's -- that's what I

Nothing.

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

2

MS. BLATT:

How does it show a conflict at all?
Nothing.

If there was some failure

3

to defer or inadequate explanation -- first of all,

4

there's something wrong with the treating physician rule.

5

But even if there was some inadequate explanation such

6

that the court could not conduct meaningful judicial

7

review, the standard consequence of that, Justice Scalia,

8

is a remand back to the administrator for further

9

explanation, not a de novo standard of review.
But that's not the question presented in this

10
11

case.

It's rather the propriety of a judge-made rule that

12

singles out treating physician evidence and elevates that

13

evidence over other evidence.
Now, again, it's inconsistent with the

14
15

background presumption about the trier of fact -- the

16

responsibility of the trier of fact to weigh conflicting

17

evidence.

18

regulations that the Department of Labor did promulgate

19

which do not constrain plan administrators.

20

We think it's in significant tension with the

And finally, the third reason, is that ERISA

21

leaves to employers, private employers, the decision

22

whether to provide benefits and, if so, the discretion to

23

devise the form and structure of plans.

24

rule is inconsistent with these discretionary and

25

voluntary aspects of ERISA because it tells plan

And a judge-made

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

administrators across the board how to weigh conflicting

2

evidence in claims arising under varying and separate

3

plans.

4

QUESTION:

Would it be relevant evidence, as Mr.

5

Paterson suggested it would be, that this man now has

6

Social Security disability benefits?

7

MS. BLATT:

The regulations require the plan

8

administrator to consider all evidence submitted by the

9

claimant, and it -- it would be relevant if -- depending

10

on what it said.

11

explained that the Commissioner of Social Security applies

12

a variety of evidentiary presumptions, not only the

13

treating physician rule but the most prominent one is the

14

listing of impairments such that the Social Security

15

Administration may make a finding of disability even

16

though the person in fact may be able to perform the

17

essential functions of the job when judged under different

18

legal settings.

19

was whether there was reasonable accommodation, and the

20

Commissioner doesn't consider that when -- when she makes

21

her determinations under the Social Security

22

Administration.

23

evidence that would be before the administrator.

24
25

But this Court in Cleveland has

And I think the issue in -- in Cleveland

And if there are no further questions, we would
ask that the judgment of the Ninth Circuit be reversed.

Mr. Rohlfing, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE D. ROHLFING

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5
6

MR. ROHLFING:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

7

In answer to Judge -- Justice Scalia's question

8

about conflict of interest, the lower courts, in the wake

9

of Firestone Tire & Rubber Company v. Bruch, have grossly

10

confused the concept of conflict of interest, dollar-for-

11

dollar conflict of interest, with actual bias.

12

the problem with the Ninth Circuit's approach, the

13

Eleventh Circuit's approach and the other circuits'

14

approach, is when we have evidence of conflict of

15

interest, the courts are requiring evidence of actual

16

bias.

17

this Court intended in the Firestone Tire & Rubber case.

And that's

And I don't believe that that's the standard that

18

Now, the other --

19

QUESTION:

In Firestone -- is -- is it a

20

conflict of interest if I set up a trust for my children

21

to pay their college education, and then I have to make

22

decisions.

23

somebody to run it, and I'm going to put more in if they

24

need more, less, if they need less.

25

say whether to pay for the $80 a month or a week or

Suppose I hire a trustee and that -- or I hire

So the trustee has to

1

whatever, a day's spending money or not, and the more he

2

pays, the more I'm going to have to put in.

3

considered, under -- under traditional trust law, a

4

conflict of interest?
MR. ROHLFING:

5
6

Is -- is that

Only if the trustee's continued

employment is -- is contingent upon your satisfaction.
QUESTION:

7

But if it is, if -- if I say you're a

8

trustee, I can fire you when I want, then the courts, just

9

in that -- like Scott on Trusts and so forth, would say

10

that's a conflict of interest?
MR. ROHLFING:

11

Because you retain too much

12

control over the -- the disposition of the trust corpus.

13

In these voluntary plans, a plan administrator really has

14

a choice.

15

control --

The plan administrator can elect to retain

QUESTION:

16

No, I understand that.

I'm just

17

trying to figure out what classical trust law would have

18

been.

19

treated the same.

20

So you're saying it's the same.

MR. ROHLFING:

It should be

The more egregious case, Your

21

Honor, would be the facts of -- that would be similar to

22

the facts of this case is if the balance of the trust

23

reverted to the trustee if they didn't spend all the money

24

on your children's education.

25

egregious --

That would be an even more

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

And then -- then classical trust law,

2

Scott on Trusts, says that's a conflict of interest and --

3

and what happens?

4

a trust like that?

Then courts review it all if you set up

MR. ROHLFING:

5

Well, Scott on Trusts, the

6

Restatement of Trusts, all refer to those decisions as

7

voidable at the election of the beneficiary, and the court

8

would review that decision de novo.
QUESTION:

9

Mr. Rohlfing, the -- the petitioner

10

didn't raise any question about the -- the conflict of

11

interest.

12

only the treating physician rule, and as Justice Kennedy

13

pointed out, you could have the treating physician rule

14

when you have a separation of the trustee and the -- the

15

company.

16

physician rule, I think it would be helpful --

And so we're here on the petition which raises

So if you could get down to the treating

MR. ROHLFING:

18

QUESTION:

19

Yes.

-- since it's the only question

that's raised.

20

MR. ROHLFING:

21

The Ninth Circuit did articulate the Ninth

22

Circuit rule in the context of conflict of interest.

23

think it's important to keep that focus in mind.

24
25

Yes, Your Honor.

So I

has put it.

There was not a thumb on the scale as petitioner
Rather the rule that the --

QUESTION:

4

Well, why -- why isn't it a thumb on

5

the scales when it requires substantial evidence to -- to

rebut?

That sounds like a thumb to me.
MR. ROHLFING:

9

substantial reasons.
QUESTION:

10

It -- it doesn't require

It requires rejection for

Well, whatever term you want to use

11

it, unless you've got substantial evidence to override the

12

treating physician's opinion, the treating physician's

13

opinion is supposed to control, and that sounds like a

14

thumb.

15

MR. ROHLFING:

I think that this Court's

16

jurisprudence and the jurisprudence of other courts in

17

other contexts have stated that concepts of abuse of

18

discretion, arbitrary and capricious, and substantial

19

evidence, are really very similar concepts and there are

20

very fine, thin lines between those concepts.

21

For instance, a decision that was made without

22

the support of substantial evidence, I would submit, would

23

be an abuse of discretion.

24

conclude, as the plan administrator did conclude, i.e., it

25

lacked substantial evidentiary support, that would be an

If no reasonable person would

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

abuse of discretion.

2

type of determination.

3

The court would readily reverse that

And that's exactly what the Ninth Circuit said

4

in -- in reviewing the record as a whole, as this Court's

5

jurisprudence in Universal Camera, for instance --

6

QUESTION:

Is it clear that that's what the

7

Ninth Circuit means by substantial evidence?

I mean,

8

that's what substantial evidence means in administrative

9

law under the Administrative Procedure Act.

It means just

10

that minimal amount of evidence that's necessary to get a

11

case to the jury in a -- in a civil trial.

12

what the Ninth Circuit means by -- or do they mean

13

substantial evidence?

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. ROHLFING:

But is that

You know what I mean?

Well, unfortunately, the -- the

16

court didn't bold-face or italicize its -- its use of the

17

term, substantial evidence.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

Yes.

I'm under the impression that

they mean substantial evidence.
MR. ROHLFING:

I think the -- the court in

21

reviewing a rule 56 motion practice, reviews the decision

22

of the district court de novo, and it's entitled to

23

substitute its own judgment.

24

court agreed --

25

QUESTION:

The parties at the district

But rule 56 judgments, summary

judgment, that is purely a question of law.

2

MR. ROHLFING:

3

QUESTION:

Correct.

So the -- the fact that it is

4

reviewed de novo doesn't have much bearing on this sort of

5

a case, it seems to me.

6

MR. ROHLFING:

Well, the -- once the Ninth

7

Circuit concluded that the district court had erred in

8

rejecting the procedural treating physician rule, the need

9

to articulate specific and legitimate reasons, and had

10

concluded that Black & Decker operated under a conflict of

11

interest, and Black & Decker represented to the Ninth

12

Circuit that it not -- it need not even consider

13

plaintiff's evidence, the Ninth Circuit exercised its

14

discretion to reverse and pay the case.

15

question that petitioner clearly did not seek cert on.

16
17

QUESTION:

And that is a

But what about the treating physician

rule itself, which he clearly did seek cert on?

18

MR. ROHLFING:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. ROHLFING:

Yes.

What is your position on that?
Your Honor, section 1133 of the

21

-- of the statute and the regulations that were in effect

22

when Mr. Nord filed his claim required the statement of

23

specific reasons in order to reject a claim.

24
25

QUESTION:

This -- we're now talking about an

ERISA claim, not a Social Security claim.

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ROHLFING:

An ERISA claim.

The statute and

2

the regulations require a statement of specific reasons.

3

And the lower courts have described the statement of

4

specific reasons as encouraging a meaningful dialogue

5

between the person claiming benefits and the plan

6

administrator.

7

conclusion, we've accepted Dr. Mitri and we've rejected

8

your physicians, is not a meaningful dialogue.

9

not --

And it would seem that a mere statement of

QUESTION:

10

It's

I don't even think they have to say

11

that.

The reasons for rejecting the claim is we're

rejecting the claim because you are not disabled or

because your disability does not -- you know.

14

the reason for rejecting the claim?

requirement that they -- that they review the evidence in

the case.
MR. ROHLFING:

18

the evidence.

It isn't a

Well, they are required to review

That's the petitioner's position.

QUESTION:

19

Isn't that

Yes, but do they have to give a

20

statement?

I mean, you know, the Administrative Procedure

21

Act requires a -- a statement of -- of reasons for the --

MR. ROHLFING:

2
3

Well, too late would be a -- a

specific reason for rejecting a claim.

filed it late.

Well, you know, so and

So and so said you got it earlier

We believe so and so.

You didn't have to say

You say we're rejecting it because in our view you
And it seems to me it's the same thing

10

with a disability.

We're -- we're rejecting it because we

11

do not -- we do not believe that -- that the disability

12

you have claimed in fact exists.
MR. ROHLFING:

13

And the problem with -- with that

14

particular analysis, Your Honor, is that we don't know

15

whether Black & Decker in this particular case put the

16

same thumb that it's complaining about the Ninth Circuit

17

put on the scale, that they didn't put the thumb on the

18

scale for Dr. Mitri.

19

petitioner and its eight private amici have argued and

20

also the Solicitor General's office has argued, putting

21

the thumb on the scale and not weighing evidence evenly

22

would be just as bad if it was done the other side

23

silently.

24
25

QUESTION:

And for all of the reasons that

But I don't understand what that has

to do with the question that's -- that's presented to us.

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Case A, that there's a treating physician who's a longtime

personal physician and his opinion is given to the

3

administrator.

4

going to see a back specialist and he goes to a back

specialist who's never seen the man before.

6

be a difference in those two?

7

what you're here to argue.

Case B, the employee says, you know, I'm

Should there

I mean, that's -- that's

8

And -- and Dr. -- was it Dimitri or Mitri?

9

MR. ROHLFING:
QUESTION:

10

Mitri.

Mitri was a specialist in this area.

11

The treating physician was not.

12

it's -- it's perfectly plausible to say that we give the

13

specialist even greater weight.

14

physician rule, it seems to me, quite arbitrary.
MR. ROHLFING:

15

It -- it seems to me that

So what -- the treating

It -- it is arbitrary if it's

16

simply putting weight on the scale.

But the Ninth Circuit

17

cast the treating physician rule as merely a statement of

18

-- of specific reasons that are legitimate under the

19

statute and that are supported by substantial evidence in

20

the evidentiary record before the Court.
But the -- the treating physician rule doesn't

21
22

distinguish between -- strike that.

I'm sorry.

The --

23

the treating physician rule does distinguish between

24

physicians that have different levels of probative

25

evidence.

The physician with more information, the long-

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

time treating physician, has a greater source of

2

information upon which to express an opinion than does the

3

one-time consultative examiner.
And that's really illustrated in the facts of

4
5

this case where Dr. Mitri stated that Mr. Nord should be

6

able to perform a certain level of work.

7

intentional use of the word should implies that most

8

people or a substantial number of people with this level

9

of impairment can engage in this level of activity, in

And his

10

this case sedentary work interrupted by standing and

11

walking.

12

QUESTION:

So you are now saying, it seems to

13

me, the opposite of what you were contending earlier.

14

You're saying that substantial evidence means more than

15

just the amount of evidence that would enable a jury to

16

find a particular fact.

17

substantial evidence meant, you wouldn't need a -- a

18

treating physician rule.

19

physician that the -- that the plaintiff brought in.

20

he brought in a non-treating physician and there were no

21

substantial evidence on the other side in the -- in the

22

Administrative Procedure Act sense of substantial

23

evidence --

24

MR. ROHLFING:

QUESTION:

Because if that's all that

That rule would exist for any
If

Yes.

-- the plaintiff would win.

34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

Right?

1

MR. ROHLFING:

2

QUESTION:

That's correct.

So the treating physician rule is a

3

-- is a useless rule.

You should call it the any

4

physician rule.

5

evidence and there's no evidence on the other side, the

6

plaintiff wins.

7

Circuit means.

8

it's not what the Ninth Circuit means.

If the plaintiff comes in with some

That's certainly not what the Ninth
And -- and as you were just describing it,

It means that if you have a treating physician,

9
10

you need substantial evidence on the other side before

11

we're going to -- we're -- we're going to let you overturn

12

the treating physician's determination.

13

what's going on here?
MR. ROHLFING:

14

Isn't that really

I think the Ninth Circuit did use

15

the -- the phrase that the opinion of Dr. Mitri was

16

overwhelmed by the other substantial evidence of record.

17

So you're right.
QUESTION:

18

Well, but -- but that characterizes

19

it on a very fact-specific basis.

20

-- is it -- Regula case in which it -- it said there is

21

the treating physician rule.

22

that rule as a rule, if applicable, in the generality of

23

cases.

24
25

MR. ROHLFING:

It also referred to the

I think you have to defend

The general application of the

treating physician rule that's reflected in both the --

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

this case and in the Regula case is that the court used

2

the rule only at the conflict-of-interest level of

3

inquiry.

4

instruct the lower court to weigh the evidence in any

5

particular manner.

6

to allow Delta Air Lines in that case to come forward with

7

evidence that the conflict of -- conflict of interest did

8

not infect its decisionmaking process.

9

rebuttal evidence of actual bias rather than the pure

10

conflict of interest that the Ninth Circuit found to

11

exist.

12

It didn't instruct -- in Regula, it did not

Rather, it instructed the lower court

QUESTION:

Again, it allowed

Well, what is the connection between

13

the treating physician rule and the concept of actual

14

bias?

15

so far as I can see.

16
17

The -- the two don't seem to have a lot in common

MR. ROHLFING:

I think that the courts are

confused below, Your Honor.

18

QUESTION:

Well, I'm confused too.

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. ROHLFING:

The courts have created this

21

hybrid animal that's asking whether conflict of interest

22

exists and then using actual bias to -- to animate its --

23

its decisionmaking process.

24
25

QUESTION:

And that's the problem.

I think I can explain the confusion.

It doesn't make any sense, but I think I can explain it.

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

The Ninth Circuit is simply saying, look it, any

2

reasonable person would give the treating physician's

3

opinion substantial weight over somebody who's not the

4

treating physician, and if the plan administrator does not

5

do that, and since he's presumably a reasonable person, he

6

must biased.

7

Circuit has simply said, obviously the treating physician

8

wins in the -- in the usual case.

9

administrator who says he doesn't win must be biased.

Isn't that what's going on?

10

MR. ROHLFING:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. ROHLFING:

The Ninth

And any plan

I think --

And that's not true in my view.
I think what the Ninth Circuit is

13

saying is that when we have expert opinion and all else

14

being equal, given the fiduciary status of the plan

15

administrator, that the treating physician should receive

16

.001 percent and tip the scale slightly in favor.

17

the fiduciary status.

18

analysis that really animates the court's inquiry into --

19

into this --

It's

It's the conflict of interest

20

QUESTION:

So -- so why doesn't this just --

21

QUESTION:

What -- what if you have a -- a

22

treating physician who presents a paragraph to the plan

23

administrator saying, you know, I've treated this fellow

24

for 6 months and I think he's incapacitated?

25

have an expert, you know, another physician weighs in on

Then you

the other side and puts in about six or seven paragraphs.

2

I put him through some tests, this and that, and I think

3

he is -- he's not disabled.

4

your view under the treating physician rule?

5

MR. ROHLFING:

How does that come out in

Well, the question then would be

6

whether the -- the tests that the independent medical

7

examiner, the one-time examining physician, either

8

mirrored the test results of the treating physician or

9

provided an independent clinical basis.

And under the

10

mature treating physician rule, every court has held that

11

independent clinical findings that are divergent from

12

those of the treating physician is always a basis for

13

rejecting the treating physician's opinion.

14
15
16

But that's not the facts of this case.

Dr.

Mitri agreed -QUESTION:

Well, does -- does the Ninth Circuit

17

recognize that the treating physician rule can be rebutted

18

in that manner?

19

MR. ROHLFING:

20

QUESTION:

21
22

Yes, it does.

You say other courts have.

Does the

Ninth Circuit?
MR. ROHLFING:

In the -- in the treating

23

physician rule that exists in the Ninth Circuit in a

24

Social Security context, it is absolutely clear that

25

independent clinical findings are an independent basis for

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

rejecting the treating physician's opinion.
QUESTION:

2

But it can't be rejected in this

3

fashion.

The treating physician who's a general

4

practitioner doesn't know anything in particular.

5

specialist with the brain, he says this man has a brain

6

embolism.

That's all he says.

Doesn't say anything else.

7

Doesn't give any more details.

And somebody -- and -- and

8

the -- the employer goes to a brain specialist and the

9

brain specialist says, again, nothing more than this

Not a

10

patient does not have a brain embolism.

That would not

11

suffice in the Ninth Circuit, would it?

You would have to

12

take the opinion of the attending -- of the treating

13

physician.

14
15
16

MR. ROHLFING:

If there's no objective test

result from any physician, an MRI or a CAT-scan?
QUESTION:

Both of them -- both of them have

17

come in with conclusory statements.

18

believe the conclusory statement of the expert who

19

examined the person rather than the -- the general

20

practitioner?

21

believe the -- the treating physician.

22

Why shouldn't I

What the Ninth Circuit says is, you have to

MR. ROHLFING:

I don't believe that any

23

reasonable person would accept a -- an intern's -- or a

24

general practitioner's opinion that the person suffers

25

from a brain embolism without an objective test showing

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the existence and presence of that embolism.
QUESTION:

2

Well, then what purpose does the

3

Ninth Circuit rule say?

4

treating physician is employed to cure and has a greater

5

opportunity to know and observe the patient as an

6

individual.

I mean, that's -- that's its rule.

7

MR. ROHLFING:

8

QUESTION:

9

The Ninth Circuit says the

That's -- that's the test.

Well, given the confusion about it,

why isn't it the -- sorry.
QUESTION:

10

And we don't in -- in the law of

11

evidence -- I'm trying to think of an analogy where we

12

have some special rule for a particular kind of -- of

13

person.

14

this is not so confined.

15

this.

16

We have expert testimony generally, but -- but

MR. ROHLFING:

I've never seen a rule like

Well, it really depends on how

17

you view juries would -- would review divergent expert

witness opinion.

19

not tend to give a source of evidence more weight than a

QUESTION:

Mr. Rohlfing, why are we getting

2

juries into it when I thought the genesis of this was the

3

Ninth Circuit said, in Social Security the courts created

4

this treating physician rule?

5

MR. ROHLFING:

6

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And the Commissioner liked it so

7

much, the Commissioner embraced it as her own.

8

we're going to do the same thing for ERISA.

And so now

And that's why when you complicate it with this

9
10

bias or conflict, there's no conflict in the Social

11

Security.

12

this decision, but as I understood it, what the Ninth

13

Circuit was saying, as far as the treating physician rule,

14

is it was a good idea in Social Security and it's equally

15

good here.

16

And as I read -- that's -- that's a piece of

MR. ROHLFING:

That's exactly what the court

17

decided, Justice Ginsburg.

18

is correct.

19

rule and -- and said it -- it creates tools for the courts

20

to use engaging the reasonableness of administrative

21

decisions in that context.

22

And I think that your analysis

The court looked at the treating physician

QUESTION:

But then -- then you started to talk

23

about juries and in the Social Security context, it's a

24

guide for the ALJ, not a jury.

25

MR. ROHLFING:

I was speaking more generally

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

with Justice Kennedy.

2

inapt analogy.

3

I apologize for bringing in an

But I do think that the -- the logic and

4

fundamental underpinnings of the treating physician rule

5

engaging any expert witness testimony is that the broader

6

panoply of information available to, in this case, a

7

treating physician justifies, all else being equal, all

8

else -- assuming the same set of objective tests, that the

9

physician with the greater source of information is

10
11

entitled to slightly more weight.
QUESTION:

Since the Secretary of Labor doesn't

12

agree with you, why isn't it better for courts to leave

13

that kind of a decision to the Secretary of Labor?

14

MR. ROHLFING:

The Solicitor General argues in

15

-- in its brief that -- the Government's brief, that it

16

has primary jurisdiction to develop the regulations and

17

flesh out the body of ERISA law.

18

held that development of the body of Federal common law is

19

within the jurisdiction of the courts.

20

QUESTION:

But this Court has long

Well, I'm -- I'm not suggesting a --

21

a primary jurisdiction rule.

What I'm suggesting is that

22

the -- the Labor Department is a lot closer to the

23

situation at the trial level than an appellate court,

24

including this one.

25

that the -- that the Department of Labor was in a better

position just to make a practical assessment of either the

2

need for the rule or the probable value of the rule than

3

-- than a court is likely to do.

4

kind of expert judgment is available, why isn't it simply

5

sensible for a court in a common law capacity to say,

6

we're going to leave it to the -- to the party -- to the

7

-- to the agency that is in a better position to make the

8

judgment?
MR. ROHLFING:

9

And -- and when that

Well, Justice Souter, the -- the

10

problem with that is that the -- the Secretary of Labor

11

has not even addressed the conflict of -- of interest

12

issue and that is the -QUESTION:

13

But the conflict of interest issue,

14

you just told us, is not the reason for adopting the rule

15

here.

16

MR. ROHLFING:

17

QUESTION:

But it is --

It has a -- it is -- it is being

given significance in the conflict issue, but I thought

that was not the reason the rule -- I'm going back to your

that wasn't the reason the rule has been adopted here.

QUESTION:

Whose money is at stake in the Social

Security cases?

3

MR. ROHLFING:

4

QUESTION:

Yours and mine.

The Government's money, really.

And

5

if the Government wants to be particularly generous to the

6

claimant, I guess the Government can be if it wants to

7

adopt a rule that's very favorable to claimants, which it

8

has done in the Social Security field.
But it's not the Government's money at stake in

9
10

-- in this case and -- and in all of these ERISA cases.

It's either the trust's money or the employer's money, and

12

it's supposed to be dispensed according to the agreement

as much leeway in deciding to be generous as it -- as it

19

right?

20

MR. ROHLFING:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

I wrote

21

those interrogatories because I read Dr. Mitri's opinion

22

when he said Mr. Nord could only lift 15 pounds, and I

23

looked at the human resources specialist's statement of

24

bona fide occupational job qualifications that the

25

occupation required lifting 20 pounds and a number of

you're not disabled.

It doesn't say that.

And if we're

effect of the plan language on the ultimate issue of

disability, the failure to include accommodation as an

affirmative prong of the -- the inquiry in the issue of

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LEE T. PATERSON

21

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

22

MR. PATERSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

23

The Ninth Circuit's treating physician rule is a

24

categorical rule based upon the assumption that a treating

25

physician's opinion is superior to other medical opinions

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

in the record.

3

physician rule prior to the time it even began to discuss

4

the conflict of interest.

5

physician rule requires deference, as it applies under

ERISA, and that the treating -- the plan administrator in

7

the Ninth Circuit must defer unless there are -- he has

8

good enough reasons not to defer.

In the Regula case, at page 1139, the

The court then later on in its opinion addressed

However, the Ninth Circuit's rule requires the plan

11

administrator to give deference, special weight, and a

12

presumption in favor of Dr. Hartman's opinion even though

13

he referred respondent to specialists for evaluation and

14

even though he has no apparent expertise in back injuries

In the facts of this case, the categorical

In every case, the

ERISA plan administrator should weigh not only the source

We respectfully submit that this Court should

reject the Ninth Circuit's treating physician rule and

remand this case back to the Ninth Circuit.
