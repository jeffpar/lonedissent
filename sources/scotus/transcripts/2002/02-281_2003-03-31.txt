CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Shoshone Indians of the Bishop Community.
Mr. Kirby.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. KIRBY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KIRBY:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In this case the Paiute propose and are seeking

11
12

a categorical rule that makes Indian tribes, their

13

casinos, their commercial businesses, and their personal

14

property immune from search warrants and subpoenas issued

15

in connection with the investigation of crime and the

16

prosecution of crime.
They seek this rule under Federal statutory law,

17
18

under Federal common law, and under the Constitution.

19

However, such a categorical rule is not supported by the

20

text, structure, or history of the Constitution, by any

21

Federal statute, or by any sufficient or rational public

22

policy.

23

Further, there is not now, nor should this Court

24

extend or create a common law right to be immune from

25

search warrants and subpoenas that are issued in

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

connection with the investigation of crime and the

2

prosecution of crime.

It is a --

accept as consent by the employees their employment forms?
MR. KIRBY:

Your Honor, I am prepared to answer

7

that question.

record, and I will proceed to answer.

9

It does involve matters outside the

QUESTION:

I see.

I just thought it was a

10

little curious that if some means of solving this had been

11

offered, why we're here.

12

MR. KIRBY:

There was not any means of solving

13

it at the time, Your Honor, because the Federal

14

regulations that govern the public welfare act at

15

question, title 45, part 205, prohibits the information

16

from being disclosed.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. KIRBY:

19

QUESTION:

Okay, thank you.
It is -That goes for -- they had asked for

20

edited copies.

21

said that they could be edited.

22

didn't Federal regulations preclude even those edited

23

copies of just the last page from being turned over?

24
25

They just wanted the last page, and they

MR. KIRBY:

Does the -- in your view

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, because the

information that's precluded from being distributed is the

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

names of the individuals who are being investigated.
Now, I know that the allegation is made that in

2
3

the letter that was sent by the district attorney and by

4

the Department of Health and Human Services stated that

5

this was a welfare fraud investigation.

6

letter actually did not so state.

7

investigation was a confidential investigation that

8

required the payroll information being sought.

However, that

It stated that the

The fundamental right and responsibility of

9
10

government is to protect its citizens, and one of the main

11

ways it does that, of course, is through the investigation

12

and prosecution of crime.

13

State government have together an integrated law

14

enforcement regime that allows for search warrants and

15

subpoenas to be executed and issued in connection with the

16

investigation of these crimes or alleged crimes whether

17

the criminal conduct occurs on the reservation or off the

18

reservation and regardless of whether the evidence or

19

proceeds of crime is thought to be on the reservation or

20

off the reservation.

The Federal Government and the

For instance, in a Public Law 280 State, such as

21
22

California, if there is a crime committed off the

23

reservation, frankly as well as on the reservation, the

24

Federal Government does not have jurisdiction over that

25

crime.

Thus, the Federal Government does not have the

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

ability to issue a search warrant.

2

have the ability to issue a search warrant under those

3

circumstances and there is evidence of crime or proceeds

4

of crime on the reservation, then that property or

5

evidence remains immune from law enforcement.

6

10

QUESTION:

If the States do not

Is California one of the 280 States

that has jurisdiction?
MR. KIRBY:

Yes, Justice Kennedy, California is

a Public Law 280 State.
Now, in a non-Public Law 280 State, the same

11

situation presents itself because in that situation, the

12

Federal Government has the right to -- and the -- the

13

duty, if you will -- as a responsibility to its citizens

14

to enforce the criminal law with regard to crimes that

15

occur on the reservation that would be State crimes if

16

they occurred off the reservation.

17

Crimes Act, as well as the General Crimes Act, the Federal

18

Government prosecutes that crime and, of course, does the

19

investigation prior to prosecution.

20

those activities and to fulfill that mission, if you will,

21

the Federal Government needs to have the right and does

22

have the right to execute search warrants and to issue

23

subpoenas.

24
25

And under the Major

In order to conduct

Now, as we have seen, there may be a situation
where a crime is committed on the reservation in a Public

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Law 280 State and a crime committed in a -- the same crime

2

in a non-Public Law 280 State, and in those situations,

3

there must be parity with regard to the law enforcement

4

regime.

5

criminal justice system, and that wasn't the intent of the

6

legislature in enacting Public Law 280.

7

If not, what we end up with is gaps in the

As the Court will recall, Public Law 280 was

8

passed by Congress because of a perceived lawlessness on

9

certain reservations.

That lawlessness arose because

10

Congress felt that the Federal Government -- due to the

11

vast distances, if you will, of Federal Government law

12

enforcement agencies, and the lack of density of those

13

agencies -- simply wasn't able to enforce criminal laws

14

throughout the vast acreage of reservations.

15

QUESTION:

And so --

Mr. Kirby, here what happened I -- as

16

I understand it, was that a search warrant was served on

17

the tribe itself, and so I think that's what your argument

18

should probably be addressed to.

19

that there could be process served against individual

20

tribal members.

21

MR. KIRBY:

I think in Hicks we held

Yes, Your Honor.

The search warrant

22

was issued as to tribal property.

I -- I would point out

23

that the search warrant itself didn't actually require the

24

tribe to do anything other than stand by and allow the

25

officers to go forth and search.

And in this --

MR. KIRBY:

Well, that's true of most search

Yes, Your Honor.
I mean, the person served doesn't

have to do anything except let them search.
MR. KIRBY:

6

Yes, Your Honor, the point being --

7

the point being that the search warrant did not hail the

8

reservation or the tribe into court for the purpose of

9

responding to a civil judgment for the purpose of -QUESTION:

10

13

at issue?
MR. KIRBY:

QUESTION:

15

MR. KIRBY:

17
18
19

It was common payroll records,

Justice Scalia.

14

16

What -- what was the tribal property

Were they records of the casino?
They were records of the commercial

business operated there, yes, the casino.
QUESTION:

Where were they kept?

Were they kept

at the casino?
MR. KIRBY:

Your Honor, they were kept in back

20

of the casino, as I understand it, in an outbuilding that

21

was secured by a padlock.

22

QUESTION:

Would you -- would you draw a

23

distinction between the subpoena of the records of the

24

commercial operation and a subpoena of the records of the

25

-- of the government records of the tribe itself?

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. KIRBY:

Yes, Justice Scalia, there could

2

very well be a distinction there.

3

we believe would address that distinction would be a

4

solution that Justice White presented in the Brendale

5

decision when he talked about a tribe having a unique

6

protectable interest in certain situations.

7

ought to have a right to go to court -- in this case, it

8

would be a State court -- to present that protectable

9

interest so that a -- an interest-balancing assessment can

10
11

And the solution that

And the tribe

be accomplished.
In this case the interest of the tribal record

12

may very well outweigh a minimal interest of the State if

13

it was a simple minor misdemeanor.

14

may be that if it's a large serious felony of multiple

15

murder and there is very direct evidence in the records of

16

the tribal government, perhaps under those facts the court

17

may find that the interest weighed in favor of the State's

18

police power.

On the other hand, it

QUESTION:

But that --

20

QUESTION:

Isn't there the obvious --

QUESTION:

Is it that the local magistrate in

22

each case has to -- and then the law enforcement officer

23

weigh these interests?

24

Well, this is a felony.

25

would be a very difficult rule to implement in practice.

Well, this is a misdemeanor.

3

5

What does everybody do?

No, Justice Scalia, and no, Justice

Kennedy.
What would happen would be once the probable
cause determination is made that there is evidence of a

10

crime within the records of the casino in our

11

hypothetical, the search warrant would be executed and the

12

property would be seized and brought before the court.

13

that time the tribe, if it thought it had a protectable

14

interest under State statute, perhaps because of certain

15

statutory privileges, or under some special protectable

16

interest that the tribe may feel that it has because of

17

its unique domestic dependent sovereign status, could

18

present that interest balance analysis to the magistrate

19

immediately.

QUESTION:

At

But what good did it do to the State

25

And if you're saying,

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

fact the State -- the tribe, to -- to ease its wounded

2

feelings, can have this declaration?

I don't follow it.

I mean, the tribe's idea is there is no right to

3
4

come on our property and seize our records.

5

saying every time the county can do that and that all the

6

tribe has is an after-the-fact determination by some

7

magistrate that the county was wrong, it's not much of a

8

remedy, is it?
MR. KIRBY:

9

If you're

With all respect, Justice Ginsburg,

10

I believe it's the best remedy available.

11

desire to have a categorical rule that no search warrants

12

may be issued with regard to its property has disastrous

13

consequences when evidence or proceeds of a crime is

14

located upon the reservation.

15

QUESTION:

Why?

Why is that?

The tribe's

I mean, from what

16

you've said so far, it sounds to me as if the State or the

17

county went to the tribe and said, we want your records,

18

and the tribe said, why?

19

tell you.

20

they might get their backs up.

21

And the county said, we can't

Well, obviously that would be a situation where

But suppose you just said, look, the reason is

22

that we think there are a couple of people here who are

23

cheating us.

25

take it you couldn't do that simple thing?

MR. KIRBY:

Your Honor, the Federal regulation

prohibits the -QUESTION:

4

All right.

So then isn't the

5

solution that maybe you need a law to overcome the Federal

6

regulation or maybe you just go to a Federal official and

7

say, will you please ask them?

8

MR. KIRBY:

9

QUESTION:

No, Justice Breyer.
There's no way to do it.

In other

10

words, under the law the only choice -- your major

11

constitutional thing is you have to say the only

12

possibility is the county that wants to prosecute somebody

13

has to -- goes to the tribe and says, we want to prosecute

14

somebody.

15

Give us all your records.

16

I'd think the tribe would certainly have a point.

17

-- yet if -- if you were behaving reasonably and maybe --

18

maybe if Federal law prevents you from behaving

19

reasonably, maybe they should change it.

We won't tell you who.

We can't tell you why.

I mean, on that circumstance,

20

How is this supposed to work out?

21

MR. KIRBY:

And yet

Well, Justice Breyer, looking at the

22

situation that you've presented, which is our situation,

23

one must remember that letters were sent by the Department

24

of Health and Human Services to the three individuals

25

asking for a reconciliation.

Letters were sent by the

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

district attorney to these same three individuals.

2

letters were sent to the tribe asking for the information,

3

which the tribe had honored five times in the last

4

approximately two years, and the tribe had actually in one

5

of those occasions asked for a search warrant, which it

6

then honored.

7

tribe to obtain this information.

There was a history of working with the

It wanted to

have something more, and in fact the tribal attorney

13

months.

with the tribe.

And as it

What ended up happening in this case is what

15
16

could happen in any case.

The tribe, for whatever reason,

17

depending upon whatever tribal government might have been

18

elected at the time -- and it -- they may have been

19

different on that day than they were during the preceding

20

2 years -- decided, no, we're not going to do that any

21

longer.

And that's how this situation came to fruition.

22

And what we're looking at --

23

QUESTION:

Well, do you have other means to get

24

the information?

Can you question the people you suspect

25

of welfare fraud and ask them how much they earned, if

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

anything?
MR. KIRBY:

2

Justice O'Connor, that was done on

3

at least two separate occasions.

each of the three casino employees advising them of the

5

discrepancy and asking that the employees come in and

6

reconcile the discrepancy.

9

investigation process into potential fraud by the --

Those letters, unfortunately,

And so the county was faced with the

QUESTION:

10

Letters were sent to

Well, presumably you could question

11

supervisory employees who prepare payroll records and ask

12

them how much have you paid these people, if anything.

13

Could you do that?
MR. KIRBY:

14

Yes, Justice O'Connor, that could be

That presumes, however, that the tribal officials

15

done.

16

would subject themselves and submit to questioning and

17

providing the information verbally that they have refused

18

to provide in writing simply by filling out a form

19

requesting the information.

20

QUESTION:

Well, we have said that the -- in

21

Minnesota v. the United States, I think we said that a

22

proceeding against property in which the United States has

23

an interest is a suit against the United States.

Not to differ or to draw hairs, yes,

the suit could be filed and if the tribe consented to

MR. KIRBY:

14

Yes, but -- against its consent.
Not against its consent.

That's

Mr. Kirby, isn't it the case that --

17

that you can sue -- the United States can be sued against

enterprise.

20

immunity, just as under our Foreign Sovereign Immunities

Act a foreign sovereign can be sued in this country

22

against its will if it is operating a commercial

23

enterprise?

24
25

Isn't that the international law of sovereign

Scalia, and that is the case we have here.

1

QUESTION:

No, but isn't there one difference?

2

And that is, take the foreign sovereign situation.

3

There's a statute of the United States.

4

start with the assumption, as I do, that we are in a

5

different situation from -- from what we faced in Hicks so

6

that we're talking about, in effect, a claim directly

7

against the -- the sovereign itself, and if we also

8

assume, which I think is correct, that the ultimate party

9

in interest in this kind of a welfare fraud situation is

10

the United States, why isn't the sensible answer to say,

11

all right, if the United States wants the tribes to be

12

treated like foreign sovereigns in a commercial

13

enterprise, and if the United States wants to regard the

14

casinos as a commercial enterprise for that purpose, let

15

it pass a statute comparable to the Foreign Sovereign

16

Immunities Act?

17

MR. KIRBY:

And -- and if we

That would certainly be a resolution

18

of this case, Justice Souter.

with dealing today without congressional action is the

20

common law tribal immunity doctrine as set forth by this

21

Court and the Montana analysis that this Court has set

22

forth with regard to --

25

QUESTION:

However, what we're left

Has Congress ever adopted a statute

speaking to tribal sovereign immunity?
MR. KIRBY:

No, Justice Scalia.

QUESTION:

Isn't it entirely a creation of this

Court?

3

MR. KIRBY:

Yes, Justice Scalia, it is.

4

QUESTION:

And if in fact --

5

QUESTION:

Well, isn't -- isn't it also a -- a

6

creation which basically was an adoption of an

7

international law norm?

8

MR. KIRBY:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

Initially -Isn't that what John Marshall thought

he was doing?
MR. KIRBY:

I believe that the tribal sovereign

12

immunity doctrine commenced with the Turner decision which

13

was approximately 1919.

14

the Kiowa decision, that sovereign immunity doctrine was

15

created almost by accident.

16

QUESTION:

And as this Court indicated in

It was --

What about Worcester v. Georgia?

I

17

thought that the -- the tribal sovereign immunity began

18

long before 19-something.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. KIRBY:

So did I.
Worcester v. Georgia, Justice

21

Ginsburg and Justice Souter, dealt with primarily treaty

22

rights and the -- the need for Justice Marshall to try to

23

-- to put, if you will, or place the tribes who were

24

nation -- independent nations, sovereigns of this country,

25

into some category that was different from nation states.

QUESTION:

Mr. Kirby --

10

QUESTION:

I think we will hear in about a

11

minute, if we get to the main issue of this, I suspect --

12

you see, on the one hand if we decide in your favor, that

13

means that any magistrate in the State, of which there may

14

be many, in any criminal case whatsoever for probable

15

cause can allow State officials to go into all the tribal

16

documents no matter how many there are, no matter how

17

related to government of the tribe, whatever they are.

18

They're most -- they're most key matters for the tribe's

19

Well, but even so, let's assume

6

In the first place --

That seems -- that seems to me a very

disruptive proposal for -- for orderly law enforcement.
MS. McDOWELL:

Well, Your Honor, nothing in the

7

position that's being urged here would preclude a State

8

from proceeding against individual tribal members and

9

searching their own --

10

QUESTION:

No, but the suggestion was that

11

there'd be a lot of cooperation between the tribes.

But

12

it seems to me that that may compromise a very serious

13

criminal investigation.

14

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, and -- and if that's the

15

case, they would not need to share the information with

16

the tribe, but they could proceed against the individual

17

tribal member.

QUESTION:

No, no.

But -- no, the problem that

19

he's trying to put -- imagine the most serious crime you

20

can think of committed off the reservation by people who

have nothing to do with the Indian tribe, for example, but

there is a key piece of evidence that is there in the

22

Tribes, after all, are sovereign

They have a significant interest in law

QUESTION:

Well, Ms. McDowell, let's talk about

23

their being sovereign.

I had thought that we -- that our

24

cases make very clear that their sovereignty is a peculiar

25

and lesser kind of sovereignty.

It is certainly -- does

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

not exceed the sovereignty of the States or of foreign

2

countries.

3

United States wants to accord the -- the tribe's

4

commercial enterprises greater protection than is accorded

5

to England or -- or Germany or any -- any foreign

6

sovereign --

And I -- I am perplexed at why -- why the

7

MS. McDOWELL:

8

QUESTION:

9

Well, of course --

-- where suit is allowed.

And I'm

sure in the course of suit, you can subpoena documents

10

relating to that -- to that commercial enterprise.

11

should we -- and that provision in the Foreign Sovereign

12

Immunities Act was simply a reflection of what the

13

international norm had become.

14

should we accord greater protection to this lesser

15

sovereignty that -- that consists of the Indian tribe?

16

MS. McDOWELL:

Why

Now, why in the world

Well, in the Kiowa case, Your

17

Honor, the Court extended tribal sovereign immunity to

18

commercial off-reservation activities of a tribe.

19

Court recognized that any limitation on tribal sovereign

20

immunity that would exclude a tribe's commercial

21

activities from the protections of sovereign immunity was

22

a task for Congress rather than for the judiciary.

23

The

And it is significant that when commercial

24

activities of the United States Government, for example,

25

have been -- when suit has been allowed against such

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

entities, it's been a matter of -- of statute, not a

2

matter of judicial decision.

3

Sovereign Immunities Act is, after all, a statutory

4

protection.
QUESTION:

Indeed, the Foreign

I think there was a dissent in that

case that made the point that Justice Scalia has been

pursuing.
I'd like to back up and find out how we got

here.

This is a suit brought by the tribe, not by the

MS. McDOWELL:

It's generally been understood,

23

Your Honor, although not specifically addressed in a

24

decision of this Court, that the Supremacy Clause and the

25

Federal jurisdictional statutes provide a right of action

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

for injunctive and declaratory relief when a party is

2

claiming that State action is precluded by superseding --

3
4

QUESTION:

Are you saying it's a kind of Bivens

action?
MS. McDOWELL:

5

It may be that.

It's -- it's

similar to Ex parte Young.

Justice Kennedy's dissenting

opinion in the second Golden State Transit case discusses

8

this at -- at some length.

Shaw v. Delta Air Lines provides a number of -- of

Also the Court's decision in

10

citations to cases that arose in this particular context.

11

So it is a settled, although not frequently discussed

12

basis, of coming into Federal court to challenge State

13

action.
QUESTION:

14

Is -- is there a problem on an Ex
I mean, you're -- we're not --

15

16

they're not simply asking the tribe to stop doing

17

something that's unlawful by going against the officer who

18

does it.

19
20
21
22
23

They are asking for tribal property.
MS. McDOWELL:

I think you're referring to a

situation where a State would sue the tribe.
QUESTION:

Well, they -- that's what's going on.

The -- the county here wants tribal property, right?
MS. McDOWELL:

That's correct.

It has obtained

24

a search warrant against tribal property.

Interestingly

25

enough, the return of the search warrant directs the tribe

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

that if they want the property back, they will have to

2

come into State court and proceed under the California

3

Criminal Code.

4

QUESTION:

Well, is that Ex parte Young?

5

MS. McDOWELL:

No.

That's not Ex parte Young.

6

Ex parte Young is -- is based essentially on what the

7

Court has called the legal fiction that when a State

8

officer is violating superior Federal law --

9

QUESTION:

Right.

So -- so Ex parte Young isn't

10

going to cover a situation like that.

11

Young analog in this situation isn't going to cover the --

12

the request here.

13
14
15

MS. McDOWELL:

I mean, an Ex parte

Well, it is when one is

considering the tribe's suit against the petitioners.
QUESTION:

Well, if -- if the -- what is the

16

Federal -- basis for Federal jurisdiction of the tribe's

17

suit against the petitioners if 1983 is not available?

18
19
20

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, the jurisdictional basis is

section 1331, Federal question jurisdiction, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

But surely the Federal law that the

21

case arises under is not 1331 itself.

You have to have

22

another law, and the one exception to that is on the

23

Federal side when the Court created the Bivens action

24

because Congress had not enacted a statute like 1983 to

25

cover Federal offices.

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

But you seem to be asking us to create another

2

such category where there's some right of action implied

3

from what?
MS. McDOWELL:

4

From the Supremacy Clause, Your

5

Honor, because the tribe's Federal common law immunity

6

supersedes the State enforcement of a State search warrant

7

against it.
QUESTION:

8
9

This is such an obvious way to raise

this kind of issue without that.

The next time somebody

10

wants something from the tribe, they say no, make them go

11

to court and appeal it.

12

MS. McDOWELL:

Yes, but a search warrant is

13

obtained in an ex parte proceeding, Your Honor.

14

no opportunity for -QUESTION:

15

There's

Well, I mean, can't you just resist a

16

search warrant and say, no, I think it's an unlawful

17

warrant and go right to the State court and appeal it?

18

MS. McDOWELL:

19

QUESTION:

No, you can't, Your Honor.

Everybody just has to follow this.

20

There's no procedure to resist --

21

MS. McDOWELL:

No, there's no procedure for

7

Don't you make that assumption in your argument?

You seem to assume that if they could not be

MS. McDOWELL:

It's acting under

That's correct, or it may be

acting under Federal law.
QUESTION:

So in the normal course of events,

24

the fact that it might not be a defendant wouldn't shed

25

any light at all on the question of whether it could be a

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

person for plaintiff purposes.
MS. McDOWELL:

2

Well, generally, Your Honor, the

3

Court has applied the interpretive presumption that the

4

term person doesn't include a sovereign.

5

appears twice in the same sentence in section 1983, so it

6

would be curious if it was construed differently.
QUESTION:

7

The term person

Well, but a citizen, an ordinary

8

citizen, could be a person for plaintiff's purposes but

9

not necessarily a defendant.
MS. McDOWELL:

10
11

Well, that -- that may indeed be

the case, Your Honor.
In the South Carolina Ports decision recently,

12
13

the Court recognized that the preeminent purpose of

14

sovereign immunity is to assure that sovereigns are

15

treated with the dignity that their sovereign status

entitles them.

QUESTION:

And they're all for -- well, what is

16

-- so tell me precisely what is the difference between the

17

casino and, let's say, the state of -- the Government of

18

Finland which happens to own a shipping business 100

19

percent and the revenues and profits from that shipping

20

business go entirely to health care, parks, other things

21

for the people of Finland.

22

between our Finnish shipping line and the casino here?

23
24
25

MR. CHAMBERS:

Now, what's the difference

There are two differences,

Justice Breyer.
First, the Finnish government, if it wanted to

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

could decide to invest the proceeds of the shipping line

2

in the U.S. stock market.

3

tribe is constrained by Congress to use the revenues

4

essentially for governmental purposes or for charitable

5

donations or a couple of other purposes.

6

it's like a State lottery I suppose, although even there

7

the State legislature could decide to use the State

8

lottery for some other purpose.

9

The tribe cannot do that.

The

But it's not --

The second distinction really was I think

10

pointed out in -- in Justice Souter's question to -- I

11

forget whether it was to Mr. Kirby or Ms. McDowell.

12

-- but Congress has enacted the Foreign Sovereign

13

Immunities Act which provides that a commercial enterprise

14

of a foreign nation operating in the United States is

15

stripped of its sovereign immunity.

But

Congress has never done that for a tribe, and

16
17

it's very important to note that while sovereign immunity

18

in the tribal context is a common law doctrine developed

19

by this Court, it has been adopted by Congress.

20

importantly, in the Indian Self-Determination Act of

21

1975 -QUESTION:

22

Why aren't you relying on Kiowa

23

County?

24

and the Court said no sovereign immunity.

25

Most

Because that was as commercial as a deal could be

MR. CHAMBERS:

Justice Ginsburg, as you pointed

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

out, there was a dissent there, but a difference in Kiowa

2

County is that you had a tribe engaged in the commercial

3

operation outside the reservation.

4

This is entirely on the reservation.
QUESTION:

5

That's not so here.
It's a tribe --

That's a fortiori for you I would

6

think.

I would think that the difference in Kiowa is --

7

is -- it seems to me one -- one might say when the money

8

is coming -- when money is sought that comes out of the

9

tribal treasury, we're not -- we're not willing to take

10

into account the commercial nature of the enterprise.

11

It's still coming out of the tribal treasury.

12

But this is quite a different matter.

Nothing

13

comes out of the tribal treasury.

14

just seeking documents that belong to the commercial

15

enterprise essentially.

16

necessarily covers this case.

17

MR. CHAMBERS:

And you're -- you're

I -- I don't know that Kiowa

I hope I can persuade you that it

18

does, Justice Scalia, that -- that -- the sovereign

19

immunity basically covers funds and property and the

20

operation of a tribal or any government, whether it's the

21

Federal Government, a State government, or a tribal

22

government.

23

judicial process of a non-superior sovereign.

24
25

And it protects that categorically from

Here the tribe is not subordinate to the State
of California.

The tribe is subordinate to the United

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

States and the county is subordinate to the State of

2

California.

But the tribe is not subordinate to

3

California.

So the tribe's policy cannot be displaced by

4

California when it's operating its own government.
Now, this could apply to any record of the

5
6

tribe, and -- and the tribe operates, as I said, health

7

care programs, educational programs.

8

Indian tribes do this today, and it's -QUESTION:

9

All -- virtually all

The tribe is subordinate to this --

10

to this extent, that the laws of the State of California

11

can be enforced under -- under section 280.

12

MR. CHAMBERS:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. CHAMBERS:

Justice --

Under law 280.
Justice Kennedy, Public Law 280

15

confers criminal jurisdiction on California on offenses by

16

or against Indians.

17

280.

18

Bryan v. Itasca County case that Public Law 280 does not

19

apply to tribes, and in the second Three Affiliated Tribes

20

decision, the Court said that Public Law 280 does not

21

waive tribal immunity or interfere with tribal rights of

22

self-governance.

23

doesn't claim -- I'm sorry -- the county doesn't claim

24

that the State has any jurisdiction over the tribe under

25

Public Law 280.

That's the language of Public Law

It does not apply to tribes.

The Court held in the

So -- so Public Law 280 -- and the State

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

3

That proceeds really to another reason why the
-- why the warrant is not good here under Federal law.
QUESTION:

Well, but it -- but it has

4

jurisdiction over individuals who by hypothesis either in

5

this case or some hypothetical case might be given --

6

might be being -- being sheltered by the tribe.

7

MR. CHAMBERS:

Well, Justice Kennedy, the tribe

8

isn't sheltering anybody.

This tribe wouldn't shelter

9

anybody and -- and tribes don't do that.

10

QUESTION:

Well, why didn't the tribe --

11

QUESTION:

We're -- we're talking about

12

hypothetical instances --

13

MR. CHAMBERS:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

Okay.

-- as to how this -- as to how this

rule that you advocate would apply.
MR. CHAMBERS:

Justice Kennedy, I think how it

17

should apply is that the rule should encourage cooperative

18

intergovernmental agreements between tribes and counties,

19

and that is in fact what happens all over Indian

20

reservations today, that --

21
22
23

QUESTION:

Well, then why didn't it happen on

your side?
I would like to ask a question of the same

24

nature that Justice O'Connor asked the county.

25

employees of the casino.

These were

They had twice received notices

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

from the county saying, here's the payroll thing, what it

2

says you've got, and here is the welfare payment you

3

received.

4

employees didn't respond, didn't respond twice.

5

the county comes to the employer, the casino, and says,

6

help us out.

7

up, but we would prefer just to have you give us the

8

records that will enable us to determine whether there was

9

welfare cheating.

Would you please reconcile these?

And so

These people -- I guess we could lock them

MR. CHAMBERS:

10

And the

Justice Ginsburg, the tribe tried

11

to avoid this confrontation.

First, the tribe did get a

12

letter asking for information about three employees

13

without any specification of why.

14

that its policies do not allow a disclosure of employee

15

information without the consent of the employees.

16

without any further notice, the county came to the tribe

17

with armed officers and insisted on seeing the records.

18

Now, the reason that -- I mean, the tribe has

The tribe responded

Then,

19

20

part of the casino.

21

that kind of confrontation.

22

the records were.

23

into the tribe's building, cut the locks, and seized the

24

records.

25

They came in a private

But obviously the tribe doesn't want
They told the officers where

The officers went with deadbolt cutters

QUESTION:

Are you saying the tribe did not know

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

that this investigation pertained to welfare fraud?
MR. CHAMBERS:

2

I believe that is correct at the

3

time that the search warrant was executed, Justice

4

Ginsburg.

5

Now, the tribe took that hit basically.

I mean,

6

the tribe didn't do anything.

7

district attorney.

8

kind of thing happening again and offered to work it out

9

by accepting simply a copy of the last page of the --

10

California law requires a welfare applicant to sign an

11

acknowledgement that employers can turn records over to

12

the county investigating welfare fraud.

13

They approached the

They said we don't want to have this

QUESTION:

Mr. Kirby said there was some Federal

14

regulation that blocked that and then Ms. McDowell told us

15

that there is no such regulation.

16

MR. CHAMBERS:

I think Ms. McDowell is right,

17

Justice Ginsburg.

18

look at the regulation, and I'm sure the Court will.

19

But -- but I guess one would have to

QUESTION:

All right.

So what's your suggestion

20

on this point?

That -- it seems to me that what we have

21

is an instance where perhaps both sides feel the other was

22

being very unreasonable, but something that should have

23

been worked out.

24

it out, one way to work it out would be get the Federal

25

Government involved, but it couldn't be worked out.

And -- and so because you couldn't work

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

So now we're in a position of either having to

2

say no matter how unreasonable the tribe is in stopping

3

the State from getting evidence of a serious crime, well,

4

that's -- the tribe wins, or saying no matter how

5

unreasonable the State is in trying to interfere with the

6

activities of the tribe, they win.
Now, to me quite honestly, neither of those

7
8

solutions is satisfactory.

9

or the other?
MR. CHAMBERS:

10

Do we have to choose the one

I think that you have to choose a

11

-- a solution that respects the tribe's operation as a

12

government.

The tribe --

QUESTION:

13

If I have to choose, why wouldn't I

14

just say, if I'm trying to look for a compromise that

15

preserves the essence of it, very well, if I have to

16

choose between two imaginary, unreasonable warring

17

parties, I will say that where it's commercial, the tribe

18

loses; where it's noncommercial, the tribe wins.

19

wrong with that, which is where we started?
MR. CHAMBERS:

20

Well, what's wrong with that here

21

is we don't have imaginary parties.

22

here.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. CHAMBERS:

25

No.

What's

We have real parties

I understand that.
I understand your hypothetical

and I -- I don't want to say it's not this case.

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

I know

1

I'm not supposed to say that.
But I -- but I think that -- that the -- I mean,

2
3

here what you have is a tribe that tried to work it out.

4

The tribe was willing and is willing to sign an

5

intergovernmental law enforcement agreement with the

6

county.
Tribes and counties do this all over the

7
8

country.

You know this, for example, from the amicus

9

brief filed by four States on behalf of the tribe in this

10

case, four States that have two-thirds of the Indian

11

reservation trust lands in the country in their borders

12

and the majority of Indians who live on reservations

13

within their borders.

14

out between tribes and counties, tribes and States.

15

Tribes have agreements all over the country with counties

16

about domesticating search warrants, about extradition --

17

QUESTION:

Those States say that they work it

Those -- those agreements may be

18

prompted by at least the uncertainty of what would happen

19

if they didn't make an agreement.

20

that those agreements aren't prompted in part by the

21

uncertainty as to whether, if there were not an agreement,

22

the State couldn't come in anyway.

23

MR. CHAMBERS:

I mean, we don't know

Well, Justice Scalia, I -- I

24

think that ascribes -- tribes do try to operate -- tribes

25

have a very strong interest in law enforcement too.

43
Alderson Reporting Company

The -- the tribe does have the payroll records.
MR. CHAMBERS:

They would presumably, Justice

Ginsburg, I think have their bank accounts or -- or
cancelled checks or -- or other information.
QUESTION:

Suppose the question were the casino

didn't file whatever was required, the State -- whatever

13

payroll reports it was required to report to the State.

14

So it's the tribe's default.

enforce the requirement that -- that all employers in the

16

State file certain records about their employees.

17

the State, which could go after any other operation that

18

fails to file required papers, go after the tribe?

MR. CHAMBERS:

And the State now wants to

MR. CHAMBERS:

Yes, and if it doesn't -- doesn't -If it doesn't, there are dispute

resolution mechanisms in the compact and there's a waiver

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

of tribal sovereign immunity for the enforcement of those

2

dispute resolution provisions.

get that information.

QUESTION:

-- in State court?

2

MR. CHAMBERS:

They could not get discovery to

3

the extent that it would intrude on essential governmental

4

functions of the tribe because that would be -QUESTION:

5

Well, the very records that were

6

involved in this case -- some reason they had to identify

7

the particular person in the casino who was responsible

8

for the tort and you have to look at employment records to

9

find out.

10

Could they get that in a civil suit in State

court, do you think?
MR. CHAMBERS:

11

No -- no, they could not without

12

the tribe's consent, Justice Stevens.

But in the ordinary

13

course of business, if the tribe understood the nature and

14

need of the issue, why, almost surely it would comply with

15

a -- with a request like that.

16

QUESTION:

But --

You -- you say essential government

17

records, but these are basically commercial records, are

18

they not?
MR. CHAMBERS:

19

Mr. Chief Justice, I see I

20

haven't persuaded you.

Mr. Chambers, you -- the tribe filed
Is that correct?

It filed it under several --

under 1331 and 1983, Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION:

10

And one of the questions we have to

11

answer is whether the tribe is a person under section

12

1983.

13
14
15

MR. CHAMBERS:

Well, if you -- yes, if the Court

decides that -QUESTION:

And I -- I would appreciate it if you

16

would address that point because the interpretive

17

presumption is that the tribe, as a sovereign, which

18

you're so strongly urging here, is not a person under

19

section 1983.

20

as a person under section 1983?

21

Why should we recognize that it's covered

MR. CHAMBERS:

Justice O'Connor, you should do

22

so because -- because section 1983 is a broad remedial

23

statute for violations of Federal rights by States.

foreign governments.

11

Paraguay couldn't bring a 1983 suit.

We said a couple of years ago

MR. CHAMBERS:

Yes, you did.

No, but I mean --

Sure, it was -- it was late in

17

the day for capital punishment.

18

question of -- of the meaning of section 1983, and I don't

19

know why that isn't good for your case too.

20

MR. CHAMBERS:

We were deciding a -- a

Justice Souter, it's not good

21

because there wasn't a history in 1871 of States impacting

22

negatively on States' Federal rights or on the Federal

23

rights of foreign states and there was in the case of

24

Indian tribes.

25

cited in our brief involving the Kansas Indians and the

This Court had decided in 1867 two cases

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

New York Indians, and the Court had decided the Cherokee

2

cases about 30 years before where there were serious

3

intrusions on tribes' Federal rights by States.
So Congress, when it enacted section 1983, was

4
5

not only presumptively aware of those, but in the 1870

6

committee report relied on by the Government, by the

7

Senate Judiciary Committee, specifically makes reference

8

to the Kansas Indian case when it's considering whether

9

Indians are citizens under the Fourteenth Amendment and

10

when they're not.
QUESTION:

11

But -- but you agree, I think, that

12

the tribe is not suable.

13

tribe is not amenable to 1983 as a defendant.
MR. CHAMBERS:

14

Under -- as a defendant, the

That -- that is correct, Justice

But, for example, in the antitrust cases,

15

Ginsburg.

16

you've held that States can sue as plaintiffs.

17

held that foreign nations can sue as plaintiffs.

18

can't be sued as defendants under antitrust statutes.

19

I think in the Vermont Natural Resources Agency case on

20

the False Claim Act, you decided that while a State could

21

not be sued as a defendant under the False Claim Act, that

22

it wouldn't necessarily preclude it from suing as a

23

plaintiff.

Well, I certainly think in

tribes to bring preemption type claims against States

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. KIRBY

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

5

MR. KIRBY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

6

I would like to address very briefly the flip

7

side, if you will, of the categorical rule being proposed

8

by the tribe and the problems with that.

9

side involves not the police power of the State, which we

10

have already talked about, but the constitutional rights

11

of a defendant who is faced with criminal prosecution in a

12

State court when that defendant feels there is exculpatory

13

evidence in the possession of the tribe.

14

may be a video surveillance of the parking lot or whatnot

15

that shows perhaps a self-defense defense for this

16

particular person.

17

Under the tribe's rule --

18

QUESTION:

And that flip

For instance, it

It's odd for you to be raising a

19

tribal member as a defendant when you have potential

20

tribal members here who might be subject to suit.

21

seem a strange champion for such people.
MR. KIRBY:

22

You

It doesn't necessarily need to be a

23

tribal member who might be a criminal defendant, Justice

24

Ginsburg.

25

a patron, who feels that there is exculpatory evidence

It could be anyone, a non-tribal member or even

53
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

that the tribe possesses.

And under the Sixth Amendment,

2

that person has the right to have the State issue

3

compulsory process to obtain that exculpatory evidence.

4

Under the tribe's rule that's being proposed,

5

the tribe would have the ability to trump the Sixth

6

Amendment right of the accused in that situation and not

7

produce the exculpatory evidence.

8

have the right to trump the Fourteenth Amendment rights to

9

a fair trial of that particular person.

The tribe would also

And that's the

10

flip side of the categorical rule that's being proposed

11

and why we believe it's another reason it should not be

12

adopted by this Court.

13

With regard to the 1983 action, I would like to

14

say that not only is the tribe not a person within the

15

meaning of the statute and the interpretive presumption

16

that this Court has set forth in, I believe, the Vermont

17

Agency it was acknowledged.

18

tribe is asserting, the right to self-governance, is not a

19

Federal statutory right and it's not a constitutional

20

right, and as such, it cannot support a 1983 action.

21

that is another reason why 1983 provides no relief for the

22

tribe in this case.

23

But also the right that the

And

In -- in closing, I would like to say that this

24

case does not implicate traditional sovereign immunity

25

which is sovereign immunity from civil suit.

And there

was a question raised with regard to that, I believe by

Justice Scalia, pointing out that the tribe's treasury is

3

not at issue here.

4

dealing with is process, in this case the criminal process

5

of the court.

It's not at stake here.

What we're

And that's a totally different situation.

This Court has never addressed criminal process

6
7

as being subject to tribal immunity.

All of this Court's

8

decisions have addressed the tribe's immunity to civil

9

lawsuit.

That is not what we have here.

The doctrine of

10

tribal immunity should not be extended in this case to

11

include criminal process for the reasons that we have set

12

forth.
While there may not be any wholly satisfactory

13
14

result, Justice Breyer, we believe that our position is

15

the best position.

16

either of the two categorical approaches, simply even

17

looking at the rights of an accused and compulsory

18

process, that should mitigate toward the county's position

19

here.

Justice White in Brendale, as being a potential resolution

of this problem, maintaining the dignity of the tribe and

also allowing the State to exercise its police power and
