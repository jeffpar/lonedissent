ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KNEEDLER:

9
10

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:
In 1987, the Secretary of the Interior, at the

11
12

request of the Navajo Nation and Peabody Coal Company,

13

approved a package of lease amendments to two outstanding

14

leases between the parties.

15

principally at issue here, Lease number 8580, the

16

amendments increased the royalty to be paid by Peabody

17

from 37-and-a-half cents per ton to 12-and-a-half percent

18

of the value of the coal, a more than six-fold increase in

19

the amount of the royalty.

20

same as the standard royalty on Federal coal leases, and

21

it was well in excess of the then regulatory minimum that

22

the Secretary had prescribed for what a tribe and a coal

23

company could agree to, which was then only 10 cents per

24

ton.

25

With respect to the lease

That new royalty level was the

The package of lease amendments also contained

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

numerous other provisions that were of benefit to the

2

tribe, including amendments to the other lease, that

3

more -- that approximately doubled the amount of the

4

royalty and a substantial increase in payments for water

5

use at the mines.
The Secretary's approval of the lease package in

6
7

1987 fully complied with the Mineral Leasing Act and the

8

regulations that the Secretary has prescribed to govern

9

her approval of lease agreements under that act.
Because there was no violation of any act of

10
11

Congress or regulation of an executive department, much

12

less one that could fairly be interpreted as mandating the

13

payment of damages by the Government, there is no cause of

14

action in this case under the Tucker Act.

15

The Court --

16

QUESTION:

Is there some other possible cause of

17

action?

Certainly it was unfortunate, to say the least,

18

that the Secretary of the Interior at the time apparently

19

had private conversations that -- with representatives of

20

Peabody Coal to try to discourage the approval of the

21

20-dollar rate.
MR. KNEEDLER:

22
23
24
25

It was unfortunate, Justice

O'Connor.
QUESTION:

And is there any other remedy for the

tribe potentially for this action?

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think there -- it -- first of

all, I --

3

QUESTION:

Is there a lawsuit now pending --

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

Not -- not on that basis.

-- to cover something else?
There's a -- there's a suit by

7

the tribe against Peabody, but -- but the -- as a remedy

8

against the United States, the only suit would be

9

conceivably an APA action.
I -- I should point out that there was no

10
11

regulation or statute that barred that communication at

12

the time.
QUESTION:

13

It's the APA action.

I mean, is

14

this -- is this a proceeding -- was the proceeding

15

supposed to be a proceeding required by statute to be

16

decided on a record?

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

18

QUESTION:

19

No.

No, it was not.

Well, then that's an informal

adjudication.

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

21

QUESTION:

Right.

I'm -- I'm not --

Ex parte communications take place

22

all the time in those situations.

23

about it?

24

mean, legally --

25

So what's unfortunate

Maybe it was unfortunate politically, but I

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

1

QUESTION:

-- is there any -- is there any rule,

2

regulation, or anything in the APA that forbids an

3

ex parte communication --

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

5

QUESTION:

MR. KNEEDLER:

There was not and there was --

There was not and there was not

Would there be now?

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

I mean, I don't know any agency -No.

There's --

-- that ever forbids of something

14

like that, but I might be wrong.

15

it.

16

I did not

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

I want to find out about

No, there's -- there's not.

17

And -- and I didn't mean to imply that an APA suit would

18

be successful.

19

the avenue in which to test that because an argument that

20

that was a -- that that was a violation would be

21

essentially --

All I meant to say is that that would be

22

QUESTION:

Violation of what?

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

Of -- of some -- some standard of

24

procedure of fairness -- procedural fairness I suppose

25

that a court would impose.

Again, we don't think that a

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

court could do that.

2

if --

I -- I simply wanted to say that

QUESTION:

3

There are some D.C. Circuit cases

4

that suggest when there's a contest between a valuable

5

privilege, that ex parte communications are not -- not to

6

be permitted.
MR. KNEEDLER:

7

But that is -- that is not

8

something, first of all, that -- that appears in a statute

9

or regulation, and under Vermont Yankee, which I think

10

came after those D.C. Circuit decisions, it wouldn't be

11

proper for a court to impose that on a -- onto an agency.

12

In any event, there was no restriction here.

13

QUESTION:

14

The D.C. Circuit used to create its

own APA before -- before --

15

(Laughter.)

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

18

-- before Vermont Yankee.
That's -- that's correct.

And

we --

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

We don't think there's any legal

21

standard, but even if there were, that sort of thing is

22

not something that would mandate the payment of -- of

23

damages for a violation.

24
25

QUESTION:

The APA suit that you're -- you're

envisioning as a potential -- that doesn't have any

7

1

dollars attached to it.

injunction?
MR. KNEEDLER:

That would be for declaratory

3

To -- or to set aside the -- the

4

Secretary's subsequent approval of the lease or -- or

5

something of that nature.
QUESTION:

6
7

Well, the lease is now expired, I

take it.

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

The lease --

We're not still operating under that

same lease, or are we?
MR. KNEEDLER:

We -- we are.

The -- the tribe

12

and the -- and the Peabody are still operating under that

13

same lease.

14

after the -- the communication that -- that you're

15

referring to.

16
17
18

It was amended in 1987.

QUESTION:

This was 3 years

And there's been no application to

set aside the lease.
MR. KNEEDLER:

There has not.

And -- and as

19

I -- as I pointed out, there are numerous aspects of the

20

lease package that was approved in -- in 1987 that are

21

advantageous to the -- to the tribe.

22

QUESTION:

And since the events, has the tribe

23

obtained the authority to impose taxes that was not

24

previously --

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

It -- well, the -- this Court in

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

1985 in the Kerr-McGee case upheld the right of the Navajo

2

tribe to impose taxes, but that's without the Secretary's

3

approval.

4

amendments in 1987 were negotiated and arrived at in -- in

5

the context of that decision.

And these lease agreement -- the lease

Now, the -- the tribe has waived its right to

6
7

collect taxes with respect to coal that goes to the -- a

8

generating station in -- in Arizona.

9

coal, though, is subject to the -- to the tax.

10

The rest of the
There's an

overall cap on that.
QUESTION:

11

Mr. Kneedler, just -- could I just go

12

back for a second to the Secretary's private

13

communications with the -- the coal company?

14

position that did not breach any fiduciary obligation

15

whatsoever?

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

17

QUESTION:

18

Is it your

No --

They did not have a fiduciary

obligation to the tribes?
MR. KNEEDLER:

19

It did not -- it did not breach a

20

legal fiduciary obligation.

There is a -- there is a

21

sense in which everything that the Secretary of the

22

Interior does or, for that matter, everything the United

23

States Government does with respect to Indians is -- is of

24

a fiduciary nature in a moral sense.

25

sense --

2

QUESTION:

So at least in that respect, it's

different from the Vermont Yankee situation.
MR. KNEEDLER:

3

Well, but -- but it's important

4

to look at the context in which this communication

5

occurred.

6

was being asked to do or -- or what -- what the Interior

7

Department was being asked to do was to make an adjustment

8

under an existing -- a term of the existing lease that

9

said that the royalty amount that was then prescribed,

The -- what -- what the -- what the Secretary

10

which was 37-and-a-half percent, was subject to a

11

reasonable adjustment by the Secretary after the 20-year

12

anniversary of the lease.

13

QUESTION:

Well, isn't it -- isn't it -- maybe I

14

misunderstand the facts.

15

had this conversation not taken place, that the adjustment

16

would have been put into effect that the tribe wanted?

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

But wasn't it fairly clear that

I don't think that's clear at all

18

because the -- Peabody Coal Company -- aside from this

19

communication, Peabody Coal Company sent the letter to the

20

Secretary of the Interior in early July of 1985 in -- in

21

which the representative of Peabody said, it appears that

22

the tribe believes that there's an imminent decision in

23

its favor on appeal from the local BIA area directors

24

setting the 20 percent rate.

25

QUESTION:

Which was true, wasn't it?

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

true.

of constitutional law, and as a matter of the regulations

5

in effect at the time, the Secretary of the Interior had

6

the authority to take control of any matter that was then

7

pending in the Department.

9

But that's a subordinate official in the Interior
The Secretary of the Interior -- as a matter

But my important -- the important point is that
in that letter, Peabody Coal Company requested the

10

Secretary to assume jurisdiction over the matter, and to

11

either rule in its favor or, failing that, to -- to send

12

the parties -- request the parties to negotiate further,

13

which is exactly what happened.

14

QUESTION:

And that letter --

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

That letter -- that letter was --

16

a copy of that letter was sent to the Navajo Nation.

And

17

it -- it subsequently is clear that -- deposition

18

testimony of Mr. Nelson, which is in the joint appendix in

19

this case, makes it clear that he understood.

20

he was a special assistant to the chairman of the Navajo

21

Nation at the time.

22

Navajo Nation had understood that the Secretary preferred

23

for them to go back to negotiate, which was a -- a

24

perfectly reasonable response by the Secretary of the

25

Interior in that situation.

He was --

2

from approximately 1 percent or a little over 1 percent to

3

20 percent was unilateral by the area director.

there was not a -- input by -- by Peabody at that time,

5

even though the area director communicated with -QUESTION:

It --

Did both the tribe and Peabody

7

understand what was being considered, the increase that

8

had been recommended by the junior people in the

Department?
MR. KNEEDLER:

10

Yes.

That -- that -- the -- the

11

area director's increase of -- to 20 percent, an

12

adjustment of 20 percent, was appealed by -- was appealed

that was -- that area director's decision was in 1984.

The briefing was, I think, about 6 months later, and then

18

in July of 1985, the -- is -- is when the Secretary

requested the Assistant Secretary to put off deciding this

and have the parties negotiate.

the governing regulations that we quote in our brief the

QUESTION:

6

QUESTION:

There was -- you mentioned in your

7

brief another route, appellate route, that could have been

8

taken in this case which would have rendered a final

9

decision, one not subject to the Secretary's -MR. KNEEDLER:

10

No.

I believe that could have

11

still been subject to the Secretary's determination.

12

What -- what the Navajo Nation could have done, if it did

13

not want to continue with negotiations, was to request

14

that the matter be transferred from this informal appeals

15

process to the Assistant Secretary to a formal appeals

16

process which goes to the Interior Board of Indian

17

Appeals.

18

QUESTION:

Well, I think --

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

At that point the Secretary could

20

have assumed jurisdiction of the matter from the IBIA

21

under the same regulation I referred to.

22

always had it within his power to -- to take -- take

23

cognizance of a case and not leave it with the -- with the

24

board.

MR. KNEEDLER:

There was a prohibition against

ex parte contacts in that formal adjudication, but

otherwise the Secretary retained the authority to -- to

take the case.

QUESTION:

Mr. -- Mr. Kneedler, did the -- was

6

the Secretary's approval required on the contract that

7

included, or the -- the revision that included the

8

12-and-a-half percent royalty rate?

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, there were two leases, and

10

the Secretary's approval was required.

11

different for the two.

12

principally at issue here, 8580 --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

But the reason was

In the -- under the lease

Let's just take that one.
-- the -- the lease itself had a

15

clause that said that the royalty was subject to a

reasonable adjustment

QUESTION:

Right.

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

-- by the Secretary.

Right.
As to that, we believe that there

21

could be no claim under the Tucker Act for the -- for the

22

fundamental reason that that is not a -- a duty that is

23

prescribed by an act of Congress, or a regulation under

24

the Tucker Act.

25

QUESTION:

No, no.

I -- I understand.

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Wasn't

1

that also subject to the general statutory requirement

2

that these leases be approved by the Secretary?

3

you know, it would be negotiated by the tribes, but

4

ultimately didn't it require the Secretary's approval?

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

It -- it may well have and that

6

was not -- that was not addressed.

7

here was --

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

10

a duty under the lease.

11

QUESTION:

They --

The basis of the claim

Well --- that the Secretary had -- had

-- let -- let me just assume and --

12

and maybe I shouldn't do this, but you just briefly at

13

least assume that the Secretary's approval was required as

14

a -- a matter of statute.

15

responsibility -- in your judgment -- carry any duty

16

toward the tribe, anything comparable to a fiduciary duty

17

toward the tribe not to approve an amendment if that

18

amendment was not as good as the -- in the Secretary's

19

judgment, the tribe could have gotten?

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

Would that approval

No.

There's -- in -- in our view

21

there is no duty under this statute to maximize returns to

22

the tribe.

23

QUESTION:

What -- Tell -- let me ask you --

24

maybe it would be easier if I asked you kind of the

25

converse question.

What responsibility does the approval

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

responsibility include?

2

ministerial, or does it imply any duty at all toward the

3

tribe?

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

In other words, is it merely

I don't know that I would call it

5

ministerial, but -- but the statute is -- is rather bare

6

in its terms.

7

through its council -- and this is -- this is a statute of

8

general application -- may -- with the approval of the

9

Secretary -- lease its land for coal purposes.

It just says that the -- that the tribe,

What

10

the -- what the preconditions for the Secretary to give

11

his approval are then and now is a matter for the

12

Secretary to flesh out by regulations.

13

QUESTION:

So --

14

QUESTION:

Well, is -- does the United States,

15
16

though, have some general duty of trust to the tribe?
MR. KNEEDLER:

I think it would be fair to say

17

that -- that there is -- that there is a -- as I said, a

18

general moral and political duty.

19

QUESTION:

Sure.

And so when the Secretary has

20

to approve a lease, should that general duty be kept in

21

mind as part of that process?

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

Surely.

Surely, and again we're

23

not -- we're -- we quite agree that as -- that as a matter

24

of what -- what judgment should -- should inform the

25

Secretary in her approval of the lease.

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

No.

But suppose the Government has a

2

general moral and political duty to the entire citizenry

3

not to lease Government land at -- at bandit rates I

4

assume.

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

8

QUESTION:

9

But that -- but that doesn't -Yes, but I meant --

That doesn't give rise to a cause of

action.
MR. KNEEDLER:

10
11

Well --

That -- that's true.

Here there

is -QUESTION:

12

Nor -- nor is there any specific

13

statute, is there?

I mean, I -- I think the -- the point

14

that Justice O'Connor is -- is raising is -- is my point.

15

Once you get a specific statutory obligation, assuming

16

that approval carries some obligation of care, inquiry,

17

whatever, doesn't that carry with it some of the duty that

18

we normally have in mind when we talk about the trust

19

duty, and doesn't that take it out of the sphere of the

20

merely moral and the merely political into the legal?
MR. KNEEDLER:

21

Well, that -- let me answer it

22

this way.

The Secretary -- as I said, I believe it's up

23

to the Secretary to decide how to flesh out the regime for

24

her approval of leases and she has done this in the

25

regulations including, importantly, now and at the time

17

So there's still something to argue

about there, I would --

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, no.

And it's important to

11

understand why -- why I -- I think that's not correct the

12

way the Secretary's regulations are written.
This act has a number of goals, one of which is

13
14

revenue for the tribe, but another is tribal self-

15

determination, and this is clear from the legislative

16

history of the Indian Mineral Leasing Act as described in

17

1938 and described by this Court in its Cotton Petroleum

18

decision.

20

Secretary.

21

So the -- the point is that it is up to the

QUESTION:

Well, then I -- I think the

22

implication of your argument is that the approval is

23

purely ministerial.

24

responsible party, then the Government is not.

25

In other words, if the tribe is the

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, the -- the -- it's actually

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

something of a hybrid I -- I believe.

And what the

2

Secretary has chosen to impose on herself, which is not

3

the same thing as to whether it's -- it's legally

4

enforceable, is a set of regulations that would govern the

5

way in which she approves a lease.

6

again, with respect to royalty, there is a specific

7

regulation that says 12-and-a-half percent.

And with respect to --

What -- the way the Secretary has -- has

8
9

accommodated these competing goals is that there is a -- a

10

minimum set of standards to which any agreement between a

11

tribe and a lessee enter into, any -- a set of standards

12

that must be satisfied.

13

satisfaction of those standards, it is up to the tribe and

14

the -- and the lessee -QUESTION:

15

Beyond that -- beyond those --

Well, all right.

That's, I take it,

16

their argument -- as I understand their argument, or part

17

of it anyway, is that if you put -- we hold property in

trust for the tribe.

19

them.

That by itself doesn't do much for

That's Mitchell I.

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

21

QUESTION:

Right.

But when you get a whole lot of very

22

detailed rules and regulations about how the Government

23

needs to behave, well, then, you find that there is a

24

specific duty for the Government even if it isn't quite in

25

those rules and regulations to behave like a trustee of a

1

trust, i.e., use prudent care, reasonable care, whatever

2

the standards are.
So they're saying whatever the details of the

3
4

regs are here, there certainly was a highly detailed set

5

of something that governed how the Government would behave

6

in this particular lease complexity, a very complicated

7

situation.

8

there was also, because of that complexity, an obligation

9

for the Government to use reasonable, prudent care no

10

And therefore, regardless of what they said,

matter what the regs said.

MR. KNEEDLER:

And that's what they didn't do here.

You see, it's just like Mitchell II.

14
15

Well --

All right.

Now, what's your response

to that?
MR. KNEEDLER:

And I -- and I think the

19

important difference is in Mitchell II the Court recited a

20

number of specific statutory duties -- statutory and

21

regulatory duties that were directed at assuring a

22

particular amount of income for the tribe under the

circumstances.

I think you'd read Mitchell II as

even though there's no anti-termite regulation, still

there was a duty of care there for the Government not to

behave that way.
MR. KNEEDLER:

MR. KNEEDLER:

3

QUESTION:

But the --

If -- if I read Mitchell II somewhat

4

more broadly and thought that there was an obligation

5

there to behave like a trustee even if I couldn't pin it

6

to a particular reg, this particular action, would I then

7

have to decide against you here?

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

Well, no, because we -- we think

that there was -- that the Secretary's approval of the --

10

of the lease amendments in 1987 satisfied a duty of

11

reasonable prudence.

12

the documents presented to the Secretary for approval

13

was -- was whether the lease package could be regarded as

14

a reasonable exercise of -- of business judgment.

15

was set forward -QUESTION:

16

The standard that was articulated in

This

Well, but that -- that argument sort

17

of takes the lease terms simply in the context of the --

18

the 12-and-a-half percent minimum that the Secretary had

19

taken.

20

argument and it is closer to the termite argument.

21

the stronger argument is whatever your obligations as a

22

trustee may be under the approval responsibility, you at

23

least have an obligation not to skew the bargaining

24

process in a way that hurts us when you know that is what

25

it will do.

But it seems to me that they have a stronger

communication was per se unlawful.

wasn't.

resulted in action by the Secretary that, in effect,

6

induced the tribe to take a different negotiating posture

from the one it would have taken.

argument is like the termite argument:

supposed to introduce bad termites into the forest, and

The argument is that the ex parte communication

12

What is your response to that?

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, several things.

The -- the

14

an immediate physical impact on the -- on the trees -- the

substance of the trust.

MR. KNEEDLER:

This

They get

Well, the -- the -- secondly,

22

the -- there is no indication that the substance of the

23

communications was any different from the -- from what the

24

tribe knew anyway, which was that Peabody had requested

25

the Secretary not to act and to allow the parties to

then the -- this -- this -- these are all things that

happened in 1984 and 1985.

5

But beyond that, when they --

That was superseded by the

In 1987, as part of the lease agreement that was

submitted to the Secretary and that the Navajo Nation

requested that the Secretary approve, the area director's

decision that initially established a 20 percent rate

unilaterally was vacated and Peabody's appeal was

dismissed.

11

happened up until then.

12

That wiped the slate clean for everything that

The question then is what is -- was the 1987

13

lease amendment package proper?

14

see it, unless there is a violation of a specific

statutory or regulatory provision in the approval of the

lease, there cannot be a claim for money damages under the

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, you had started to

explain that the -- the responsibility, or the authority

came out of the lease itself with respect to -- to the

main lease --

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

23

QUESTION:

But

then you said that there was also Secretary approval

involved in the one where it wasn't a term of the lease.

1

I think you started to say that.

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

In -- in 1987, what the

3

parties presented to the Secretary was not a proposal to

4

adjust the royalty under the -- Article VI of the existing

lease.

things, superseded that clause of the lease and put in

But that 1987 package provided well in excess of

12

the minimum royalty rate both for the 8580 lease and also

13

the other lease with -- for the Navajo with respect to

14

coal it owned jointly with the Hopi Tribe.

15

satisfied the specific regulatory standard that the

16

Secretary had prescribed for deciding when she would

17

approve lease agreements.

18

QUESTION:

And that

What I can't quite understand with

19

reference to your position as to the correct reading of

20

Mitchell II is this:

21

there's a breach of a fiduciary duty, there still has to

22

be some specific statute or regulation which we violate,

23

and that specific statute or regulation must imply that

24

there is a cause of action for damages.

25

fiduciary component quite irrelevant.

It seems to me you say that even if

That makes the

Either there's a

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

specific statute, or there isn't.

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, I don't think it does because

3

it -- the fiduciary -- the important discussion in

4

Mitchell II of the fiduciary responsibility had to do with

5

whether the specific statutory or regulatory duty -- which

6

is prong one -- could in turn be fairly interpreted to

7

requirement -- require the payment of compensation.

8

That's where the fiduciary obligation comes in.

9

But this case fails at the first step because

10

there is no specific statutory or regulatory provision

11

that was violated. There's no need to get to the second

12

step in the analysis on that theory.

13

And this specificity requirement was reflected

14

in Testan and Sheehan, both of which were decided prior

15

to -- to Mitchell.

16

granted with specificity.

17

Both say that there has to be a right

It's also confirmed by things that have happened

18

since then.

That's the way the Federal Circuit in the

19

Brown and Pawnee decisions that we -- that were cited in

20

the decision below looked at Mitchell -- Mitchell II.

21

There had to be a specific provision that was violated.

22

And that's also entirely consistent with last

23

year's decision in the Gonzaga case under -- under the

24

very parallel situation of 1983 where the Court said there

25

has to be a -- a right granted with specificity -- an

is whether a -- a -- another Federal statute gives rise to

a cause of action under a general cause of action creating

a statute, in that case 1983.

is directly parallel.

MR. FRYE:

11
12

In listening -- Mr. -- Justice

Stevens, and may it please the Court:
In listening to the Government, it's clear that

13
14

the Government has not come to terms yet with the basic

15

principle established in Mitchell II, that where Congress

16

gives the Federal Government control of Indian property,

17

that control necessarily implicates trust duties.

18

violations of trust duties, when the Government is

exercising responsibilities, within the contours of those

statutes and regulations, gives rise to a claim for money

But

Here, it's the tribe that's negotiating the

It seems to me that's quite different.
MR. FRYE:

That's a two-part question.

One,

8

after the Navajo tribe signed the coal lease in 1964, it

9

had absolutely no control over anything.

I'd like to read

10

you one -- just one regulation, one operating regulation,

11

that the Secretary has.

It empowers -- and this is at

Did it do that or oversee it?

Oh, the Secretary doesn't mine coal

BIA oversees that timber production in the same way it

QUESTION:

Does it waive sovereign immunity in

Government?

23

It doesn't do so expressly.

MR. FRYE:

It doesn't do so expressly just as

24

the -- the timber statutes didn't do so expressly in

Mitchell II.

But it has that same overlay of

Alderson Reporting Company

1

comprehensive Federal control and regulation.
QUESTION:

2

That's true, but -- but the

3

Government had a good response to my question, which was

4

that if, in fact, I was agreeing with you for the purposes

5

of interpreting Mitchell II hypothetically, they said, you

6

know, this is a procedure, and it's a procedure that

7

you're complaining was violated.

8

for two reasons.

9

responsibility as creating procedures in identical

And that's significant

First, it would read this trust

10

circumstances where a party is an Indian tribe that do not

11

exist in respect to anyone else, and secondly, it would be

12

finding a -- money damages, $600 million in fact, for a

13

violation of this -- one of these procedural regulations.
And I cannot even think -- though there may be

14
15

some, I cannot think of an instance where a private person

16

who really has been badly hurt can recover money damages

17

from the Government where what the Government did was not

18

follow the right procedure.

19

the money damages, and you'd have to overcome all those

20

hurdles.

21

MR. FRYE:

So it's new procedures, plus

Okay.

We are not complaining,

Justice Breyer, about any procedural problem.

What we are

that was penned by Peabody's lawyers in -- in the

administrative appeal, and that's shown in the joint

appendix --

10

QUESTION:

Again, that's -- you know, in a

11

particular context, that might be terrible, but when

12

you're talking about administration, it's a very common

13

thing for parties to submit proposed findings, et cetera.

14

So I don't know about this circumstance, but that -- that

15

in and of itself is -- is not obviously it.

16

MR. FRYE:

That wasn't my entire answer.

17

Following that, the Secretary of the Interior

18

basically instructed his subordinate to lie to the Navajo

19

Nation so it would not know what went on.

20

subordinate was the last person that the Navajo Nation

would have expected to deceive it.

had named his son Peterson Zah Vollmann.

If the question is what the Secretary

All right, and so -- so then you --

you're down to what the Secretary did in response.

5

depends on what the Secretary's obligation is, I -- I

6

presume.

7

MR. FRYE:

Yes.

QUESTION:

And as I read the statute and

10

that a very low minimum was -- was complied with.

11

after that, the negotiation was up to the tribe.

Is that

The statutes and regulations did

require minimum royalty rates, and as this Court held --

QUESTION:

Which are very low.

17

MR. FRYE:

Very low.

Absurdly low.

I mean,

18

the -- the Government would say to this Court if we had

19

approved -- if we had misled the Navajo Nation so badly

20

that it would have taken 11 cents a ton, we could approve

21

the 11 cents a ton because the minimum royalty rate was

10 cents a ton even though we knew it was worth $4 a ton

in royalty.

Yes, but -- I'm actually having

What precisely is it that breached

the trust, without any characterization?

MR. FRYE:

Yes.

Who said -- what is the act that's

supposed to be the breach of the fiduciary duty?

Yes.

I mean, are there

There are a variety of things

that led the tribe to accept Peabody's proposed package

Well, would you --

MR. FRYE:

-- the culminating events of the

QUESTION:

Can I interrupt you, sir?

17
18

breach -Could --

19

could you specify what the variety is because I want to

20

know the same thing Justice Breyer wants to know.

21

MR. FRYE:

Yes.

The culminating event was the

22

approval of a lease for a less than 12-and-a-half percent

23

royalty rate where the tribe gives up -- has a negative

24

bonus of $89 million in back --

25

QUESTION:

All right.

But that's -- that's a

36
Alderson Reporting Company

1

lease that the -- that the tribe at that point had agreed

2

to.

3

number one, that led the tribe to act differently from the

4

way it would have acted otherwise?

Would you specify what the Government did or said,

MR. FRYE:

5

But for the Secretary's intervention,

6

20 percent would have been slipped in as the new royalty

7

rate.

8

QUESTION:

What intervention?

Precisely what?

9

MR. FRYE:

The -- the memo that Peabody's

10

lawyers wrote that Secretary Hodel signed telling the

11

deciding official to stop action.

QUESTION:

Well, now wait a minute.

When --

when the Secretary exercises his authority to approve

leases, is it your -- is it your contention that the only

15

obligation -- not to approve leases, but to -- but to --

16

to give effect to that provision of the lease which allows

17

him to increase the lease rates -- that's what we're

18

talking about here.

19

obligation, is it your contention that his only duty is to

20

the tribe?

When he -- when he approaches that

21

MR. FRYE:

Yes.

QUESTION:

MR. FRYE:

The key modifier is if he can get

away with it.
QUESTION:

3

-- I just don't read it that way.

4

seems to me that no -- anybody would be crazy to enter

5

into a lease like that.

6

the Secretary would act fairly.

7

what's fair for the tribe, but also what's fair for the

coal company that entered into a lease at a much lower

rate earlier at arm's length.

It

One would expect that the -- that
Sure, take into account

You think he -- you think

10

the Secretary couldn't take into account what's fair for

the coal company at all.
MR. FRYE:

12

What the Secretary had to take into

13

account is provided by the language of Article VI of the

14

lease.

The adjustment had to be reasonable.

And to --

And to find that out, the

includes what -- what's fair for the -- for the person

21

who -- on the other side of the lease who -- who is

22

suddenly getting socked with a 20-fold increase.

think that's unreasonable at all for the Secretary to take

that into account.

4

bankrupt the operation and stop the coal mining.

5

If it's reasonable, that means I think

QUESTION:

But that may be, but there must be a

6

statute -- there must be a statute that turned over to the

7

Secretary or his office the job of interpreting that word

8

reasonable in the lease.

9
10
11

MR. FRYE:

What -- what's that statute?

That would be the Indian Mineral

Leasing Act.
QUESTION:

And it gives the Secretary -- and

12

you're saying that that statute, when it gives the

13

Secretary the power to decide what is or is not reasonable

14

under the lease, means that the Secretary must really just

15

take the Indians' point of view into account?

16

MR. FRYE:

Absolutely not.

He needs to exercise

independent judgment to make sure that whatever the

MR. FRYE:

I agree with you.

I'd like to get back to Justice

23

Ginsburg's question about the second purpose of the

24

statute.

25

both purposes of the statute.

Here, the Department of the Interior thwarted

an informed way.

4

what the judge in the Court of Federal Claims said.

5

said, a negotiator's weapon is knowledge.

6

these things, the Navajo Nation was without critical

knowledge, and in fact, the record shows that the

Secretary was giving this knowledge and more to the people

9

who were negotiating against us.

Mr. Kneedler

14

earlier.

15

MR. FRYE:

The -- the request was -- was

16

included in that letter, and -- and the tribe did get a

17

copy of that letter.

18

19

Secretary told us the opposite.

didn't you know at least it was a possibility as long as

the letter was on the table?

25

I guess that -- it certainly would be

a possibility.
But there -- there was sort of a law of the case

Alderson Reporting Company

that developed in this administrative procedure.

MR. FRYE:

That is incorrect?

3

MR. FRYE:

Yes.

4

QUESTION:

Why?

5

MR. FRYE:

Volume II of the joint appendix in

6

this Court includes both the original lease and these coal

7

lease amendments, and they're virtually totally different

8

documents.

9

dedication of 90 million tons of coal.

There's new tax waivers.

There's a new
There's a -- for

10

the north lease and for the other lease another

11

180 million tons of coal, all without a competitive bid.

12

So we not only didn't get the Federal minimum,

13

we certainly didn't get 20 percent.

14

Federal minimum of 12-and-a-half percent, and we had to

15

pay a bonus to the companies of $89 million to get what we

16

got.

17

QUESTION:

We didn't get the

But you got a severance tax as part

18

of the package, and one of the things that the Government

19

suggested is if -- if you take the 12 percent and you add

20

the 8 percent, then you get up to the 20 percent, which

21

was your figure.

22

MR. FRYE:

Justice Ginsburg, we had the tax

23

before all of this happened.

24

Kneedler mentioned to the Court, we can't tax 60 percent

25

of the coal because it goes to the Navajo generating

2

So we're capped at the 12-and-a-half percent royalty level

3

for 60 percent of the coal.

4

these lease amendments, we were not restricted in the

5

amount of taxes that the Navajo Nation could impose.
QUESTION:

6

And before we entered into

And as I understand it now, it's --

7

what you're saying, it's just as if the trees in Mitchell

8

where the money from the tree was supposed to go to the

9

Indians, if the Government had cut it down and sold it for

10

a half a cent a tree.

11

MR. FRYE:

That's correct.

12

QUESTION:

All right.

And all this other stuff

13

with the procedures is just evidentiary of what was going

14

wrong.

15

trees at too low a price, if they were supposed to go to

17

that's the -- basically the argument.

But what was going wrong is it's like selling the

MR. FRYE:

I think that's right.

That's --

The damage-

19

causing activity finally was the approval of these

20

damaging lease amendments.

QUESTION:

Was the price above the minimum that

the Secretary's regulations provided for?

23

MR. FRYE:

Yes.

24

QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me the problem then

25

was with the Secretary's regulation, not with what went on

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

here.

That regulation was invalid as arbitrary,

No.

The regulation only set a

But that's -- but that's the point,

6

I mean, in order to leave full negotiating authority to

the tribe.

8

low that it -- it produces, you know, highway robbery.

9

seems to me that the problem is -- is with the regulation

10

and maybe you can get at it when the regulation is applied

11

this way.

12

And what you're saying is that minimum is so
It

I don't know.
MR. FRYE:

The -- in Mitchell II, for example,

13

there was a claim -- the Mitchell II claims did not track,

14

by the way, specific statutory and regulatory provisions.

15

There was a claim, for example, that was upheld for the

16

failure of the Department of the Interior to -- to develop

17

a system of roads and easements conducive to timber

18

harvesting.

19

There was no regulation that required that.

25

QUESTION:

It's the exact same

What we have here is the

The approval has a real

It's certainly not how -- how the

Court described it in Mitchell II because the Court spoke

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

about exclusive control, that the United States did all

2

the negotiating, that -- and it made all the arrangements.

3

Now, whatever you -- you say, you have to deal with what

4

is in that opinion, and it does stress the exclusive

5

control of the United States and distinguishes the prior

6

case on the ground that the other case was designed to

7

give the Indians autonomy to deal for themselves.
MR. FRYE:

8
9

The -- the Secretary certainly had

exclusive control over whether to approve this

10

transaction, whether to allow the trust asset to be sold

11

or not.

12

within the contours of the statutes and regulations.

He had exclusive control over that, and that is

13

And I --

14

QUESTION:

I thought that the -- the authority

15

came from the lease from the term that the -- that the

16

tribe agreed to, that the -- the authority to adjust the

17

royalty in this case comes from the lease, not from any

18

statute or regulation.

19

MR. FRYE:

Isn't that true?

That's correct.

Of course, that

20

lease itself was approved by the Secretary of the Interior

21

as trustee of these --

22

QUESTION:

Wait.

I thought you said some of

23

these were new leases.

I mean, that's what confuses me.

24

When I was making that point earlier, you said no, some of

25

them were new leases.

Now, the authority to adjust the

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

rate for the new leases certainly didn't exist in the old

2

lease, did it?
MR. FRYE:

3

That's not even at issue.

There

4

is -- there is no secretarial authority to adjust the rate

5

in the new lease.
QUESTION:

6

Well, that -- that's right.

So some

7

of your complaint does not rest upon the provision in the

8

original lease that gives the Secretary the power to

9

adjust the rate.
MR. FRYE:

10

Yes.

I -- I think in response to

11

Justice Breyer, the -- the event that caused the damages

12

here was the improvident approval, without observation

13

of --

14

QUESTION:

Of the new leases.

15

MR. FRYE:

Of the new leases.

16

QUESTION:

So that -- and that -- that's --

That is correct.

17

there isn't a -- sort of like a statute that says,

18

Secretary, give an approval or not.

19

tribe negotiates something.

20

director -- the area director, say, okay, that's all right

21

because the tribe asked him to say.

22

approve -- appeals to the Department of the Interior under

23

a regulation of the Interior Department allowing any

24

aggrieved party to go appeal.

25

intervenes in that, and then they don't tell the tribe.

What there is is the

Then they have the

And then somebody

And then the Secretary

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And because they don't tell the tribe, the tribe enters

2

into a different lease.

That's really what happened.

3

MR. FRYE:

Yes.

4

QUESTION:

And it's hard to fit that into the

5

model of the Secretary charging a penny for a tree.

6

Secretary, in a sense, didn't charge anything for

7

anything.

8
9
10
11

MR. FRYE:

The

The Secretary allowed this trust

asset to be conveyed for what he knew to be about half of
its value.
Now, the approval requirement has a history,

12

going back to the first administration of George

13

Washington.

14

first erected what this Court has called the strong shield

15

of Federal law, to prevent Indians from being despoiled in

16

their property.

17

legislates against this rich history, this background in

18

the context of the approval requirement.

19

In the Trade and Intercourse Acts, Congress

And Congress, when it legislates,

In the Anicker case in 1987, in a leasing

20

context, the -- the Court said that the -- this strong

21

shield of Federal -- of Federal law was designed to

22

protect the Indians from the designs of those who would

23

take their property for less than fair compensation.

24

That's the -- that's the meat of the approval --

25

QUESTION:

Okay.

So you're saying the approval

49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

was wrong for two reasons, I guess.

Number one, the rate

2

approved was less than half fair value.

3

MR. FRYE:

Correct.

4

QUESTION:

So that, in effect, every -- every

5

lease that was approved at the 12-and-a-half percent was

6

wrongly approved.
MR. FRYE:

7
8

coal.

No.

This is extraordinarily valuable

This is unusual coal.

9

QUESTION:

I see.

Okay. I --

10

MR. FRYE:

This is 12,500 btu coal.

11

QUESTION:

I stand corrected.

12

So it was the -- the approval was wrong simply

13

because the -- the particular value of this coal meant

14

that it was being conveyed away for -- for half what it

15

was worth.

16

MR. FRYE:

Yes.

17

QUESTION:

That's the substance.

18

And then you're also making the argument that it

19

was wrong -- and I think I used the word, the -- the

20

bargaining process was skewed, but you're -- you're making

21

that argument too?

22

MR. FRYE:

Yes.

The Secretary should have known

23

that the end result was going to be unfair because he had

24

skewed the bargaining.

25

QUESTION:

Okay.

May -- may I ask you this

Alderson Reporting Company

1

question as to whether he really did skew it?

2

understand what the skewing might be, it would be simply

3

the refusal of the Secretary to allow the administrative

4

process to go forward, as a result of which the tribe

5

ended up negotiating when it might not otherwise have

6

negotiated.

It might have held out.

My question is this.

7

As I

Didn't someone -- and I

8

forget who it was now -- on behalf of the Secretary come

9

right out and say to the tribe, the Secretary or the

10

Department or the Bureau thinks it would be better if you

resolved this by negotiating?

12

that that is practically saying, look, we're not going to

decide this thing?

negotiating.

tell them in substance what they were doing?

You go out and decide it by

And if that is true, didn't they, in effect,

MR. FRYE:

shouldn't have to guess what his trustee is really telling

him.

21

Peabody doesn't like, and -- and we're going to sit on

likes and you can live with.

approach.

I guarantee you.
Now, I think Justice O'Connor made the point

3

that if all we have -- if -- if the trust duty only

4

applies to specific statutory and regulatory violations,

5

then it's meaningless.

6

greater than that.

7

Corporation case about 6 years ago said precisely that.

The trust duty has to be something greater than the sum of

9

these distinct parts.

QUESTION:

The trust duty has to be something

And this Court in the Varity

So -- so the mere designation of a

trustee in these cases is a waiver of sovereign immunity?
MR. FRYE:

I would say not, Your Honor.

There

has to be this overlay of comprehensive Federal control

and supervision.

And I would note too in the Indian Tucker Act,

it doesn't restrict Indian plaintiffs to the same rights

cases that laws means Federal common law and the -- and if

there's anything that's grounded in the Federal common law

tradition, it's the trust duty owed to Indian tribes.

that's what we sue under, the Indian Tucker Act.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

14

First, with several factual points.

15

did know the substance of -- of what had happened with

16

respect to Secretary Hodel.

17

Mr. Nelson's deposition, which is excerpted in the joint

18

appendix, makes clear that the tribe had learned, he said,

19

from Washington that -- that it was requested there that

20

they go back to negotiations.

21

Thank you, Justice Stevens.
The tribe

As I pointed out earlier,

And also I would call the Court's attention to

22

page 2370 of the appendix, which are notes of the

23

negotiating session -- first negotiating session that

24

occurred after that on August 30th, 1985.

25

which Chairman Zah of the Nation acknowledges that

It's a note in

53
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Secretary Hodel apparently wanted them to go back and try

2

to reach an agreement.

3

entered into these negotiations with a full understanding

4

of -- of what the Secretary's preferred course was.

So it's clear that the parties

Secondly, I think it's -- it's completely not

5
6

true that Secretary Hodel directed a subordinate to lie to

7

the Navajo Nation.

8

appendix, there's a copy of the directive that -- or

9

the -- the memorandum that Secretary Hodel sent to the

The -- on page 117 of the joint

10

Assistant Secretary about this.

And he makes four very

11

significant points entirely reasonable under the

12

circumstances.
He -- he referred to the fact that affirming the

13
14

decision outright unilaterally might lead to prolonged

15

litigation, during which the -- Peabody might well put

16

the -- the royalties into escrow and the tribe wouldn't

17

get them.

18

It would impair the future ongoing contractual

19

relationship between the parties.

Peabody has a huge

20

presence on the reservation, and it was obviously

21

beneficial for the parties to resolve this peaceably and

22

not just this isolated royalty increase under this one

23

lease, but a whole host of issues that were -- that were

24

facing the two parties:

25

other -- other leases in which there was a significant

taxation, payment for water,

54
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

2

increase.
And those other leases, by the way, did not have

3

an adjustment clause.

4

not only of an increase on this lease, but an increase on

5

a lease that did not have an adjustment clause.

6

So the tribe here got the benefit

And Secretary Hodel then said it would be

7

preferable to allow the parties to negotiate, and then

8

importantly at the end, he said, I haven't reached a final

9

decision on the merits of the appeal.

I just think it

10

would be better if the parties went back and negotiated.

11

And since, as Justice Scalia pointed out, this was a lease

12

provision that was -- protected both parties, what is

13

reasonable for both parties, it was certainly an

14

appropriate resolution of that for the Secretary to say --

15

in the normal situation where you have a -- a

16

disagreement, or differing views under a lease, to send

17

the parties back and seek to have them negotiate.

18

Also, I would point out on page 125 of the joint

19

appendix, there's a letter from Mr. Vollmann in which he

20

points out that the Secretary is aware of each party's

21

concerns about the settlement, again making it clear

22

that -- that the Department in Washington was aware of the

23

state of affairs out there.

24
25

that, the claims about the negotiations that preceded the

claims, or claims about improper regulation of -- of a
