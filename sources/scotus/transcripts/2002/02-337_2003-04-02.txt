ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD E. PINAUD, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. PINAUD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is about the vitality and scope of the

12

rule of construction from Shamrock Oil that says that the

13

removal jurisdiction to Federal courts should be narrowly

14

construed.

15

As we see it, the overarching question in this

16

case is, as posed by respondent, whether or not the rule

17

from Shamrock Oil applies to cases brought in State court,

18

but based upon a Federal question.

19

three reasons, and I'd like to, if I can, list them, and

20

then I'll go back and -- and cover each of them

21

individually.

22

We think it has to for

First, respondent proposes an unworkable

23

distinction whereby the -- whereby Shamrock Oil is not to

24

be applied where a case is brought under the Fair Labor

25

Standards Act alone, but it should be applied if it's

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

brought together with some State law claims.
Secondly, Florida has a right to protect its

2
3

citizens.
And thirdly, the Fair Labor Standards Act is

4
5

just -- just as much a part of the law of Florida as any

6

act of the Florida legislature or any decision of the

7

Florida courts.
Let me cover that first point first, which is

8
9

the unworkable distinction.
Respondent concedes that Shamrock Oil would

10
11

certainly apply in a situation where a State law claim was

12

being brought together with a Fair Labor Standards Act

13

claim.

14

We only brought a Fair Labor Standards Act claim.

15

could have, but we didn't.

16

In this case we did not bring a State law claim.
We

If you were to -- if you were to have that rule,

17

you would have a situation where whether or not Federal

18

jurisdiction was proper would be wholly dependent upon

19

whether a State claim was brought with Federal action.

20

don't think that --

21

QUESTION:

We

But there are unworkable aspects to

22

your position, Mr. Pinaud.

For example, a Title VII case

23

combined with an equal pay case, the equal pay case could

24

not be removed, but the Title VII case could, and then you

25

would split what is essentially one controversy into two

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

parts because one is -- is not removable.

2

MR. PINAUD:

3

QUESTION:

4

Well --

The equal pay would be governed by

the same thing as --

5

MR. PINAUD:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. PINAUD:

There is --

-- the Fair Labor Standards Act.
There is, I think, no question that

8

the Equal Pay Act and the Age Discrimination Act -- Age

9

Discrimination Enforcement Act would be covered by the

10

Court's decision in this case because the enforcement

11

provisions of those statutes are tied to the Fair Labor

12

Standards Act.

13

QUESTION:

And if you're right -- if you're

14

right -- the equal pay case would have to stay in the

15

State court, although the Title VII case could go forward

16

in the Federal court.

17

MR. PINAUD:

18

The -- the second reason that I think Shamrock

That would be correct.

19

Oil applies in this case is because Florida has a right to

20

protect its -- its citizens.

21

Phillip Breuer, Mr. Breuer, who is a resident of the State

22

of Florida who lives in Duval County, who works for Jim's

23

Concrete of Brevard, which is a company in Brevard County,

24

in an employment relationship that took place in Florida,

25

governed by Florida law.

This is a dispute between

They worked in many counties in

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Florida.

Certainly then Florida has an interest in that

2

relationship and in this dispute.

3

Asahi where you have a -- a California court looking at a

4

dispute between a -- you know, a Taiwanese company and a

5

Japanese company.

This is not a case like

Florida has an interest.

The third point is that the Fair Labor Standards

6
7

Act is just as much a part of the law of Florida as any

8

decision of the Florida legislature or any -- or any

9

opinion of its court.

Under the Supremacy Clause, the

10

laws of the United States are the laws of Florida.

11

Florida courts have an obligation, an absolute duty, to

12

enforce and uphold the Fair Labor Standards Act just like

13

they have to enforce and uphold the -- the Fourth

14

Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment.

15

It -- it would be unrealistic to say that Florida has an

16

obligation to uphold these laws, but then has no right or

17

no interest in having them upheld in -- in Florida courts.
So for -- for those reasons, we think that

18
19

Shamrock Oil certainly has to apply to this case.
If you then go ahead and -- and apply the

20
21

Shamrock -- the Shamrock analysis to either the expressly

22

provided language of 1441 or the maintain language of the

23

Fair Labor Standards Act, you have to reach a decision

24

that these cases are -- are not properly to be subject to

25

removal.

6
Alderson Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

Well, one can certainly maintain an

2

action in the Florida courts, and unless it's removed, it

3

will continue there.

4

using the word maintain means that the action must

5

necessarily remain there.

I -- I -- it doesn't seem to me that

MR. PINAUD:

6

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, obviously

7

it's our position that maintain in this case does mean

8

that it should remain in State court, and we think it's

9

for a couple of reasons.
The first reason we would say is that once you

10
11

apply the Shamrock analysis, maintain has to mean what we

12

say because in the very worst-case scenario, at least for

13

our position, maintain is ambiguous or -- or capable of

14

two different constructions.

15

the Government argues and respondent argues -- that it's

16

ambiguous.

17

meaning you can maintain to a conclusion in State court,

18

or if it is, rather, capable of meaning that you can only

19

really bring or commence it, then under Shamrock Oil, when

20

we apply that analysis, we should use the conclusion that

21

most limits removal, which would be to -- which would be

22

to say that maintain means you continue on to -- to final

23

judgment.

24
25

Everybody here has argued --

Well, if it's ambiguous, if it's capable of

QUESTION:

Well, except -- except that you have

a later statute that says that it's removable unless --

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

unless it is expressly provided otherwise.

2

MR. PINAUD:

3

QUESTION:

4

Justice --

And I don't think something that is

ambiguous expressly provides otherwise.
MR. PINAUD:

5

Well, Justice Scalia, I think what

6

you have to do, though, is I think when looking at the

7

expressly -- expressly otherwise provided language, you

8

have to -- first, you have to apply Shamrock Oil to that

9

language.

Now, it's -- it's our position that when

10

Congress used the word expressly provided, otherwise

11

expressly provided, it meant it in a textual sense.

12

That is, the word expressly is capable of two

13

different meanings itself.

14

absolutely unambiguous, or rather, it can mean grounded in

15

some text.

16

meanings, we think that when you apply Shamrock to

17

expressly, you choose the textual meaning because the

18

textual meaning shrinks removal considerably whereas the

19

other meaning expands it.

20

It can mean super clear or

Because it's capable of two different

QUESTION:

But I think --

And your reading of the word

21

maintain -- and your whole case hangs on that word,

22

maintain -- suppose the case were brought initially in a

23

Federal court, and there were -- there was a motion, a

24

1404(a) transfer motion, to transfer the case from one

25

district court to another.

I take it on your reading,

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

1404(a) couldn't apply either because you would have to --

2

if the plaintiff chose to maintain it in one Federal

3

court, therefore it couldn't be switched to another?
MR. PINAUD:

4

Justice Ginsburg, I -- I don't

5

think that would be the case.

I -- I don't think that

6

that's really analogous to the situation of bringing it

7

from the State court to the Federal court.

8

it's -- the -- the forum choice I think is significantly

9

different.

It's --

When the employee brings his action in State

10

court, he's choosing that State -- that State forum, and

11

it's for a reason.

12

reasons are -- are actually well articulated in -- in the

13

Government's 1947 brief when they were actually supporting

14

our position.

So I -- I don't think it's --

QUESTION:

15

And -- and we think that -- that those

But if you're relying on the language

16

of the statute, maintain in any Federal or State court,

17

any State court, any Federal court.

18

conceding that you could transfer from one Federal court

19

to another, then the plaintiff's choice doesn't inevitably

20

prevail.

21

MR. PINAUD:

So if you are

Well, I think then my -- my answer

22

to that would have to be the rule from Shamrock Oil says

23

if there's two reasonable interpretations, we -- we make a

24

decision that limits removal.

25

reasonable to say that if you bring it in one Federal

I'm not sure it's

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

court, it can't be transferred to -- to another Federal

2

court on -- on the -- the concerns would -- that would

3

give rise to it.

4

If I could go back, just a moment, to what I was

5

talking about, the -- the expressly provided language,

6

addressing your question, Justice Scalia.

7

that the expressly provided language has to be the textual

8

basis based upon this -- this Court's construction of

9

28 U.S.C. 2283.

We also think

That's the anti-injunction statute.

In

10

that statute, Congress has provided that no -- that no

11

Federal court shall issue an injunction to enjoin a State

12

court proceeding unless expressly authorized by Congress.

13

We're dealing with expressly provided language in 1441.

14

We see the language as completely indistinguishable.

15

In Mitchum v. Foster, this Court construed that

16

language in 2283 as saying, look, that language does not

17

mean that you have to have a -- a statute that says you

18

can issue an injunction.

19

we look at the scope -- we look at the purpose and intent

20

of the statute and say is the purpose of -- and intent of

21

the statute to allow an injunction.

22

Court is saying in -- in Mitchum --

23

QUESTION:

Rather, what the Court said was,

So really, what the

That was just a magic language case.

24

I mean, I think all it was saying is you don't have to use

25

the -- the very words so long as you have clearly made

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

that disposition, but I don't know that I would go so far

2

as to say that it -- it stands for the proposition that

3

something has been expressly provided for when there is

4

simply an ambiguous provision that might be interpreted

5

that way, but then, on the other hand, might not be

6

interpreted that way, which is -- which is what I think

7

you have to fairly say about maintain.

8
9

I -- I don't think your maintain argument goes
anywhere unless you apply to it the -- the rule of

10

preference that you're urging upon us, that -- that you

11

have to interpret it so as to prevent removal rather than

12

permit it.

13

the later statute unless you -- unless you interpret that

14

expressly to mean that an ambiguous provision expressly

15

provides, and I just find it hard -- hard to swallow that.

16

And I just don't see any of our cases that -- do you have

17

a case that deals with what was truly an ambiguous

18

provision and -- and nonetheless said that it expressly

19

provided for something?

20

But that -- that preference is eliminated by

MR. PINAUD:

I -- I don't have -- there -- there

21

is no case that I know of that would be on point in -- in

22

this situation, Justice Scalia.

23

we do not -- though we think that the first analysis

24

should start with Shamrock because -- the first analysis

25

of maintain should start with Shamrock because at best

But I would also add that

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

everyone -- everyone agrees that the statute is ambiguous

2

and that is -- that is, that the respondent and the

3

Government would say, well, it could mean this but maybe

4

it doesn't.

5

everything hangs or falls on Shamrock necessarily.

I don't think we say that it's -- that

6

If you look at the way maintain was used in the

7

Fair Labor Standards Act, we think that the word maintain

8

is an express prohibition -- prohibition on its own.

9

is not just our opinion.

This

This was the opinion of the --

10

of the majority of judges, the majority of courts that

11

construed the statute prior to the 1948 amendment.

12

also the opinion of the United States back in 1947.

13

QUESTION:

What's the reason?

It was

I mean, leaving

14

the word out of it, I mean, normally the background rule

15

is -- this is an -- case arising under Federal law, and

16

the background rule through removal is if either party

17

wants to go into Federal court, you can.

18

there's an exception for this statute.

19

MR. PINAUD:

I'm saying leave the linguistic point out.
MR. PINAUD:

Why?

Justice Breyer, I'm not exactly

sure why we -QUESTION:

What -- what reason would there be

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

that people would want to make an exception for this

2

statute, the normal -- I'm not saying there is none.

3

just want to know what the reason is.

4

normal -- I would be just repeating myself.

5

what I'm saying?
MR. PINAUD:

Have you got

I -- I think I understand what

you're saying now --

8

QUESTION:

Yes, all right.

9

MR. PINAUD:

10

The -- the reason why Congress wanted an

exception in the Fair Labor Standards Act to allow

12

employees to bring these cases in -- in State court --

MR. PINAUD:

why Congress --

20

Give them a choice.

QUESTION:

Well, they can -- they can bring it
I mean, there would be no reason

The reason why Congress would want

21

employees to have a choice, but would not want the

22

defendant to have the choice or bring it to State court,

23

unlike other Federal statutes is?

24
25

MR. PINAUD:

Because in 1938, when this statute

was passed, it was difficult for many employees around the

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

country to -- to effectively vindicate their rights for

2

unpaid overtime if they had to go to Federal court.

3

is -QUESTION:

4

This

Mr. Pinaud, that's the same thing

5

with respect to the FELA, and -- and Congress therefore

6

expressly provided that if a railroad worker brings a case

7

in State court, it cannot be removed.

8

responding to the problem of the person who would find it

9

difficult to go to the big city to litigate in the Federal

And Congress was

10

court rather than stay in the State court close to home.

11

And so doesn't the -- the fact that Congress expressly

12

provided that FELA cases are not removable cut against

13

you?
MR. PINAUD:

14

Justice Ginsburg, I -- there are

15

certainly cases -- certainly statutes where Congress has

16

said this is not removable.

17

is to be held to a standard where they have to use magic

18

language in order to prohibit removal.

19

the -- the real analysis should be what was Congress

20

intending by the statute at issue or else you -QUESTION:

21
22

what was it -- what?

23

removable?

25

this.

We think that

But -- but before the -- the 19 --

MR. PINAUD:

24

We don't think that Congress

1445 -- before 1948, were FELA cases

I'm not sure.

I -- I will say

Before 1948, you know, Congress had used language

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

in other statutes that said you can't remove it, and --

2

and we recognize that.

3

to this magic language statute, then -- then nothing they

4

could do or nothing they could intend would matter unless

5

they use this specific language, and we're not sure that

6

that's what the standard should be.
QUESTION:

7

But if you -- if you hold Congress

But we have a string of specific

8

statutes, and then we have 1445 that lists in a row

9

non-removable actions, a catalog of actions that are not

10

removable.

And this one is left out.

11

from that, well, they --

Wouldn't one infer

12

MR. PINAUD:

Well -- I'm sorry.

13

The -- the Reviser's Notes to the -- the 1948

14

revisions are rather meticulous.

They talk about

15

everything they're accomplishing and what they're trying

16

to do.

17

changes that were made to the other sections, like

18

section (c), the other subsections, that in order to

19

accept the proposition proposed by respondent, you would

20

have to conclude that Congress throughout, with these

21

other sections of 1441, certainly intended to contract

22

removal, but yet with 1441(a), it grossly expanded

23

removal.

24

Standards Act cases were generally considered to be not

25

removable.

I -- I think it's noteworthy that with all the

I mean, this is a time now where Fair Labor

That was the prevailing opinion.

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

There's no mention in the -- in the Reviser's

2

Note or any of the history to the statute that -- that

3

Congress even thought about the Fair Labor Standards Act,

4

so I think the more realistic assumption in the enaction

5

of -- of that legislation was that Congress accepted

6

the -- the prevailing opinion which was that maintain was

7

good enough, that maintain was an express prohibition

8

against removal.

9

The -- when you're looking at the word maintain,

10

also I think it's to see obviously the -- the public

11

policy concerns that I was just addressing with Justice

12

Breyer, but we do think it's important, as did the

13

Government back in 1947, that in enacting this

14

legislation, as it was -- originally appeared back when it

15

was passed, Congress used the word maintain within 38

16

words in the same sentence.

17

be maintained in any court of competent jurisdiction, and

18

then 38 words later, it said it may be maintained by an

19

agent or representative of the employee.

20

to -- if you were to assume that maintained does not mean

21

what this Court essentially has said it meant in the

22

George Moore and Smallwood cases -- and that is that

23

maintain means to -- to continue on -- to continue or

24

uphold, continue on foot a suit already commenced --

25

QUESTION:

Congress said an action may

If you were

When -- when you say that the -- the

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

provision said it could be maintained by an employee, that

2

sounds more like a synonym for brought by the agent of the

3

employee, that the action could be brought an agent of the

4

employee, which of course does not help you.
MR. PINAUD:

5

Well, the way I think we look at

6

it, Mr. Chief Justice, is certainly Congress could not

7

have meant by saying it could be maintained by an agent of

8

an employee that he can file it, bring it, and then

9

somehow have the case ripped from his control.

10

That is

why we think that if you -QUESTION:

11

Well, but that -- that's the case in

12

any case of a Federal statute covered by the removal

13

statute unless -- unless Congress says otherwise.

14

to say it's ripped from his control by being removed, that

15

happens all the time.

16

MR. PINAUD:

Oh, no.

I mean,

I'm sorry, Mr. Chief

17

Justice.

18

talking about when -- when the Fair Labor Standards Act

19

was originally enacted -- it -- it no longer appears with

20

this language.

21

That -- that's not what I mean.

I don't -- I'm

When it was originally enacted, it said, an

22

action under this section may be maintained in any court

23

of competent jurisdiction, which we all agree is --

24

includes a State court.

25

sentence that that action can be maintained by an agent or

And it also said in the same

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

representative of the employee so that he didn't have to

2

do it himself.

Somebody else could do it for him.

And the point that we're making is certainly

3
4

when Congress said that that other person can maintain it,

5

they didn't mean that that person could start the case and

6

then have the case ripped from him and have somebody else

7

take it over.

So if you -- if you --

8

QUESTION:

Well, ripped from him in what manner?

9

MR. PINAUD:

Well, that's exactly it, Mr. Chief

10

Justice.

If -- if you were to accept the argument

11

proposed by respondent, you would have to accept that

12

the -- the agent or representative of the employee in 1938

13

could file the case, but then after he filed it, somebody

14

else or someone would have the authority to divest him of

15

his right to prosecute it.

MR. PINAUD:

MR. PINAUD:

MR. PINAUD:

No.

Justice Ginsburg about the definition and -- and so forth

2

of maintain.

3

has to mean more than simply start or bring or something

4

like that just because, if for no other reason -- if you

5

put aside Shamrock and you put aside the policy arguments,

6

for no other reason that Congress in this statute, in the

7

Fair Labor Standards Act, when it enacted it, used the

maintain twice, one to mean you can maintain the suit and

one to mean that a person can maintain it for you on your

him or her, certainly they didn't mean you can just bring

it and then somehow, not for removal purposes, but you

won't have the authority any more to prosecute it.

And obviously, if Congress is going to give the

QUESTION:

But you won't if the employee that

you're representing says, I don't want you, I want another

Well, I -- that's -- I suppose that

MR. PINAUD:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but that

would be the employee's decision.

That would be no

QUESTION:

I'm just questioning your -- your

saying no one could -- you couldn't wrench the case from

the agent because the word maintain is used.

Well, of

10

course, the employee could wrench it from him and give it

11

to somebody else.
MR. PINAUD:

12

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

The

13

employee could wrench it from him just as the employee who

14

was maintaining his suit could choose to dismiss it.

So I can't see the other wrencher in the picture.
MR. PINAUD:

Well, if the -- the point I -- I am

20

trying to make is that if this representative is

21

maintaining the suit for the employee, if it only means

22

bring, then one could conceivably fashion reasons why that

23

person wouldn't have a -- would not be able to continue on

24

foot that suit aside from the employee.

25

I -- I know we're kind of dealing with -- with

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the semantics of the word, but I think it's important to

2

show that the word means more than just bring or commence.

3

At this same time also -- and we've cited the statutes in

4

our brief -- the -- the Government passed a whole host of

5

laws where they used words like bring and commence.

6

choose the word maintain if it doesn't mean something --

7

something more in -- in this case?

Why

Also -- and I know I've mentioned this a couple

8
9

times -- the word maintain itself -- it was the prevailing

10

opinion back then, before 1948, that maintain was express.

11

That is the exact language that the Government used in its

12

brief filed in the Johnson case, that this was an express

13

prohibition against removal.

14

19

So these are the people that

And we think that that -- those are entitled to

There's -- you know, there is another argument

they're not experienced enough to handle it and so forth

13

Removal doesn't mean that the State court is in -- in any

respect incompetent.
MR. PINAUD:

15

I agree.

I don't think removal

means that the State court is incompetent.

I -- I was

addressing an argument made that essentially that, well,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW S. HAMENT

10

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

11
12
13

MR. HAMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Since 1875, a defendant in a civil action has

14

had a right to remove a case arising under Federal law to

15

a U.S. district court.

16

in 28 U.S.C. 1441(a), which authorizes a civil action --

17

the removal of a civil action of which the Federal

18

district court has original jurisdiction except as

19

otherwise expressly -- otherwise expressly prohibited by

20

an act of Congress.

21

provided language was added in 1948.

22
23
24
25

This right is currently codified

The except as otherwise expressly

The court below correctly ruled that respondent
had a right to remove this case for three reasons.
First, the plain language of 1441(a) which
allows removal of a case arising under Federal law, such

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

as a Fair Labor Standards Act case, unless Congress has

2

expressly prohibited removal.

3

text of the Fair Labor Standards Act or its legislative

4

history which even mentions the word removal much less

5

expressly prohibits it.

6

There is nothing in the

Second, Congress has explicitly prohibited

7

removal in a series of enactments, and when it has done

8

so, it has used very explicit language directly referring

9

to removal.

10

Third, the words, may be maintained, in any

11

court -- or any Federal or State court of competent

12

jurisdiction in the Fair Labor Standards Act is identical

13

to language that Congress has used in other statutes,

14

including the Family Medical Leave Act and the Employee

15

Polygraph Protection Act.

16

removal is barred under the Fair Labor Standards Act, then

17

this would affect those statutes.

18

nothing in the text of those statutes which suggests that

19

Congress was attempting to prohibit removal.

20

not mentioned in the text or the legislative history.

21

If this Court were to rule that

And again, there is

The word is

When Congress has prohibited removal in a series

22

of statutes, starting in 1910, it has very directly used

23

the word removal, and this has happened both before and

24

after it enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938.

25

In fact, in 1948, Congress created a section of

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the 28 -- Title 28 under section 1445 and entitled it

2

Non-Removable Actions.
In 1910, Congress stated that certain

3
4

railroad -- cases against railroads under the Federal

5

Employer Liability Act, FELA, that actions arising under

6

those laws may not be removed -- used the words, may not

7

be removed.

8

In 1914, Congress passed an enactment stating

9

that certain actions against common carriers may not be

10

removed.
In 1933, they passed the Securities Act and used

11
12

the words, shall not be removed.
So these laws were in place using very direct

13
14

language when the Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted in

15

1938.
Since the Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted,

16
17

we have examples of four different laws that were passed

18

by Congress, some in 1441(a), some stand alone, that use

19

the words, may not be removed or shall not be removed.

20

The last one was the actions under the Violence Against

21

Women's Act of 1994.

22

example what Congress had in mind in 1948 when it used the

23

words, except as other expressly provided.
QUESTION:

24

didn't.

So we know from example after

2

Standards Act cases were not removable.
MR. HAMENT:

Number one, Justice Ginsburg, at

3

this point the Department of Labor has changed their

4

position, and I think that's because of the addition in

5

1948 of the very express standard that except as otherwise

6

expressly provided by an act of Congress, this type of

7

case would be removable.

QUESTION:

Well, what do we care what their

20

QUESTION:

21
22

They have the power to persuade, and

they're knowledgeable.
MR. HAMENT:

Respondent's relying on the view of

23

Congress which set forth a very clear standard in 1441(a)

24

that these types of actions are removable unless expressly

25

prohibited, and we're relying on Congress.

MR. HAMENT:

wrong on its opinion.

Our position is that they were

Though what he I guess was driving at

is what the -- in 1938, the year I was born, I'm in San

10

Francisco, but there are a lot of workers down in Salinas

11

putting artichokes in cans.

12

was violating the law, so they go into the State court in

13

Salinas and the employer runs up to San Francisco.

14

once he can remove that case to San Francisco, it's too

15

expensive for the employee to run up there.

16

why your opponent says they -- they wrote this statute.

17

They used the word maintained, and the administrator who

18

was present at the creation, so to speak, had followed

19

that for quite a long period of time.

And their employer perhaps

And

And that was

Now, you're -- you're saying look at the

20
21

language.

The language just isn't good enough.

22

anything else you want to add on that?

23

MR. HAMENT:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. HAMENT:

Is there

Well, Justice Breyer --

You know, on the purposive part.
Yes.

Yes.

Justice Breyer,

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

there -- there is no legislative history to support that

2

Congress was intending to prohibit removal for that or

3

for -- or for any other reason.

4

there are small claims that are possible under the Fair

5

Labor Standards Act, but there are also very large claims,

6

including very large collective actions.

7

wanted to put a limit on the amount of claim that could be

8

brought in a Federal court, then Congress could certainly

9

do that, as it has done in other statutes, and as -- as it

And -- and yes, in --

If Congress

10

has also done in limiting removal of certain cases based

11

on amount.

12

But Congress hasn't chosen to do that.

Turning to the point of the effect of a ruling

13

that these words, may be maintained, could bar removal

14

under the Fair Labor Standards Act, as mentioned and as

15

counsel for the petitioner concedes, this would also

16

prohibit removal under the Family Medical Leave Act, the

17

Employee Polygraph Protection Act --

18

QUESTION:

Well, it might if you -- it might not

19

if you, in fact, did put considerable weight on the

20

knowledgeable views of the -- of the administrators who

21

were present at that time and the presence of a good

22

reason for wanting to have achieved that result.

23

grant you, I see problems with the approach I'm

24

enunciating, but -- but it wouldn't necessarily change

25

those other acts.

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

I -- I

1

MR. HAMENT:

I -- I think the problem would be

2

that the Court would have to -- to eliminate from 1441(a)

3

the expressly provided otherwise language to -- to achieve

4

that result.

5
6
7

QUESTION:

Is it meant to apply retroactively in

1948 to those statutes passed preceding 1948?
MR. HAMENT:

I believe -- I believe it was.

If

8

you look at the timing of the addition of that language in

9

1948, at that time, the right to remove didn't have the

10

expressly provided otherwise exception.

It just was a

11

right to remove, and it was at that time codified in

12

28 U.S.C., section 71, which had the right to remove.

13

But coupled in that same paragraph were two

14

examples of cases where Congress said there was no right

15

to remove, the FELA action and the action under the

16

Interstate Commerce Act dealing with loss of -- or injury

17

under certain actions against common carriers.

18

in the same paragraph was this language, may not remove

19

these two types of cases.

So right

20

When they reorganized, they moved that language

21

to 1440 -- 1441 -- 1445 and I think they were just making

22

clear, when they left the right to remove, that they may

23

from time to time, as they have, expressly prohibit

24

removal of certain actions.

25

addition of that language changed nothing.

So I -- I think the -- the
It is just

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

simply adopting what the Congress had already applied as a

2

standard.
QUESTION:

3

Are you saying then what it did was

4

to clarify what was ambiguous before, and the

5

clarification made it apparent that the Wage and Hour

6

Division had been wrong?

7

argument?

8
9

MR. HAMENT:

Is that -- is that your

I would be a little disingenuous if

I said I think that Congress had looked to the Wage and

10

Hour brief or the Johnson decision in doing that.

11

sure that they did and my guess is --

12
13

QUESTION:

I'm not

But in any -- in any event, they

-- what they did in 1948 so the error

16

of the Wage and Hour Division --

17

MR. HAMENT:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. HAMENT:

To the extent they --

-- meaning --- considered it, they overruled it

20

because Johnson in that case, although it reached the rule

21

that -- that there was no removal by implication, said

22

repeatedly in the decision that Congress was not clear in

23

expressing its intent.

24

paying attention to Johnson, it overruled it with the

25

expressly provided other language in 1948.

So to the extent that Congress was

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

If removal were barred in this case, just to

2

finish on the point of the effect on these other laws, you

3

could have a very problematic situation, which I'm sure

4

Congress never intended, of having, for example, an age

5

discrimination case which would not be removable under the

6

ADEA, but a race discrimination case under Title VII that

7

is removable, or a handicap or disability discrimination

8

case under the American with Disabilities Act which would

9

be removable.

You'd have ERISA claims which would be

10

removable, but not claims for leave benefits under the

11

Family Medical Leave Act.

12

discrimination claim due to unequal pay that would be

13

removable, but not an Equal Pay Act case under the Fair

14

Labor Standards Act.

15

that Congress, in using the words, may be maintained -- it

16

simply confers right of action -- would have ever intended

17

this effect.

18

You'd have a Title VII sex

And again, there's no indication

Finally, I'd like to just briefly address

19

petitioner's argument in the reply brief dealing with

20

Mitchum v. Foster.

21

language in the anti-injunction statute which says that

22

except as expressly authorized, a State court

23

injunction -- a -- a Federal court may not enjoin a State

24

court, and relies on Mitchum.

25

They're arguing that there's similar

This reliance is misplaced.

First, the underlying law in Mitchum was the

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Civil Rights Act, the 42 U.S.C. 1983 action.

2

Court determined that the power to enjoin a State court

3

under that statute was inherent in the necessary and

4

indispensable power to remedy civil rights violations.

5

And the -- the right to enjoin State court actions was

6

absolutely essential to the purpose of 1983.

7

And the

Second, the Court observed that it had a long

8

history of making exceptions to the anti-removal statute

9

without directly referring to the anti-removal statute or

10

State court injunctions.

11

And third, in --

12

QUESTION:

13

Are you talking about the

Anti-Injunction Act or the anti-removal statute?

14

MR. HAMENT:

Anti-injunction statute, I'm sorry.

15

And third, in Vendo Company versus Lektro, this

16

Court said that the fact that in Mitchum there was no

17

direct reference to the anti-injunction statute or staying

18

State court injunctions was cured by the fact that there

19

was relevant legislative history.

20

None of those factors are present here.

21

Obviously, the Fair Labor Standards Act does not rise and

22

fall on this removal issue.

23

repeatedly made exceptions very expressly and directly

24

referring to removal when it made an exception.

25

third, there is no legislative history.

Second, Congress has

11

MS. BLATT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The general policy of the removal statute is to

12

give the defendant the same right as the plaintiff to have

13

his case heard in Federal court.

14

achieves that objective by permitting the defendant to

15

remove an action to -- to Federal court if the plaintiff

16

could have originally filed his suit there.

The removal statute

There is no dispute in this case that the

18

plaintiff could have filed this action in Federal court

19

even had the -- even had the defendant preferred that

20

the -- that a State court adjudicate the dispute.

21

policies underlying the removal statute are therefore

22

served by giving the defendant the same right to insist

23

upon a Federal forum.

Now, the removal statute creates a narrow
exception to this policy when another statute expressly

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

bars removal.

And Congress has foreclosed removal in a

number of statutes in direct and explicit terms by

providing most notably in section 1445 of Title 28 that,

answering how Federal courts don't get things.

(Laughter.)

3

MS. BLATT:

There was division and there still

4

is division today, but we think that the 1948 revision

5

makes amply clear that what's required is an express bar.

6

And when compared to the established template of the other

7

statutes where Congress has foreclosed jurisdiction in

8

direct, unambiguous terms, it makes clear that the -- the

9

correct answer is that the actions are subject to removal.

10

And the example I wanted to give was about why

11

the word maintain doesn't speak to how the action may be

12

disposed of under other provisions was a bankruptcy

13

petition.

14

the continuation of any judicial proceeding, and a similar

15

result would hold true under State and Federal venue

16

provisions.

17

Federal removal legislation.

18

Under Federal law that would operate to stay

And we think the same result is true under a

There's nothing in the Fair Labor Standards Act

19

that suggests that the plaintiff's initial choice of a

20

State law -- State court forum must prevail over the

21

defendant's express statutory right to remove an action

22

under section 1441(a), and we think the employee's right

23

to sue accordingly is subject to removal.

24
25

And the only thing I -- I'd like to address in
response to the petitioner's argument is this principle of

35
Alderson Reporting Company

1

narrow construction.

2

applies for basically two reasons.

3

We don't think that principle

And the first is that because there was no

4

dispute about the Federal court's jurisdiction to hear

5

this case, again notwithstanding Florida's interest in the

6

case or even if the -- had the defendant preferred the

7

State court forum, the plaintiff could have insisted that

8

the Federal court hear the dispute.

9

relevant inquiry is not one of narrow interpretation, but

10

it's a standard that's set forth on the -- under the plain

11

terms of the statute itself, and that is whether another

12

statute expressly bars removal.

13

reasons that have been given, even if one were to apply a

14

principle of narrow construction, it would not be

15

plausible to construe the word maintain as an express bar

16

to removal.

17
18

And thus the only

And we think for the

And for those reasons, we would urge that this
Court affirm the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit.

Thank you, Ms. Blatt.

Mr. Pinaud, you have 5 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD E. PINAUD, JR.

22

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

23

MR. PINAUD:

24

Justice Ginsburg, you had asked respondent a

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

question about whether or not the -- the 1948 amendments

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

could have in any way been intended to -- to clarify the

2

removability of Fair Labor Standards Act cases.

3

as I think I mentioned earlier, I -- I just wanted to add,

4

I think respondent agreed with that.

5

because, as I stated, if you look through the Reviser's

6

Notes, they -- they are extraordinarily meticulous.

And as --

I don't agree

They

I didn't ask whether they intended

I asked whether they did.

I don't know that -- that

10

Congress paid any attention to this particular Johnson

11

against Butler Brothers case.
MR. PINAUD:

12
13

certainly did not.

Oh, no.

No, it did not.

It

And I -- I think that is important.

I -- I think also that these public policy

14
15

concerns that -- that Justice Breyer was -- was

16

discussing, these are really very important concerns that

17

we don't think should be overlooked.

18

you don't have an interstate highway system.

19

have a whole lot of time -- a whole lot of lawyers who

20

want to practice in Federal court or who can practice in

Federal court.

Nobody is going to take a case for $11 or

QUESTION:

Was there ever a proposal made in

5

Congress to give workers who have FLSA claims the same

6

express provision that is there for railroad workers?

7

MR. PINAUD:

Not that we know of, but it's our

8

position that that would be because Congress, at the time

9

it passed this law, believed it was express, that that was

10

the prevailing opinion, and that even now that was still

11

the opinion of about half of -- about half of the courts,

12

half of -- half of the district courts.

13

is -- district courts every day -- in fact, after this --

14

I think just before this Court granted certiorari, there

15

was a district court in -- in Texas that said, absolutely

16

these cases need to be staying in State court.

17

You know, this

So I think Congress didn't get -- I don't know

18

why Congress didn't get involved in it, but I would think

19

it would be because they thought maintained was express

20

enough, that maintain was good enough.

21
22

Mr. Chief Justice, if there are no further
questions, I have nothing further.
