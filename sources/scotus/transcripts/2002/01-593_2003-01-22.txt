ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER R. PADEN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

MR. PADEN:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

The Dead Sea Bromine Company is an

12

instrumentality of Israel under the Foreign Sovereign

13

Immunities Act for three principal reasons.
QUESTION:

14
15

capacity now as it was earlier?

16

MR. PADEN:

17

QUESTION:

18

Is it -- is it owned in the same

No -- no, it is not, Your Honor.
And was it owned at the time the suit

was filed?
MR. PADEN:

19

At the time this suit was filed, the

20

company had been privatized.

It was privatized in 1995.

21

QUESTION:

Right, and so are you going

Right.

22

to address, then, how it comes under the statute at all in

23

those circumstances?

24

MR. PADEN:

25

I certainly intend to do that, Your

Honor.

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. PADEN:

Yes.
The three reasons, in sum, are that,

3

throughout the period of time giving rise to the claims,

4

Israel owned a majority of the shares or other ownership

5

interests in the company.

6

phrase plainly encompasses the majority ownership of Dead

7

Sea Bromine that Israel indisputably possessed through a

8

tiered ownership structure.

9

We contend that this broad

Secondly, a contrary interpretation cannot be

10

reconciled with the basic purposes of the act.

11

policy that Congress found applicable to directly owned

12

entities apply equally to their subsidiaries where the

13

foreign State retains a majority interest.

14

instrumentalities to entities in which States hold legal

15

title to the shares of stock would exclude a large number

16

of the very types of State-owned commercial enterprises,

17

shipping and airlines, mining operations and the like,

18

that Congress specifically intended to bring within the

19

reach of the statute.

20

QUESTION:

The same

To restrict

Yes, but it's a lot of trouble to

21

track these things back, you know, who owns shares many

22

tiers up, and Congress might well have simply determined

23

we will honor the sovereignty of other States when they're

24

the principal stockholder of a corporation.

25

where they are not, we are not impugning their sovereignty

Where --

1

by going ahead and permitting -- permitting suit against

2

the entity.

3

disposition, and the language seems to suggest that.

4

That's certainly a rational -- a rational

MR. PADEN:

Well, Your Honor, I -- I don't

5

disagree that that would be a rational disposition, but I

6

don't think there's any indication in the case law, and

7

there have been numerous cases where tiered entities have

8

appeared before courts, that it's posed any particular

9

problem to identify the tiered ownership structure.

I --

10

I'm not aware of any cases where -- where that's posed an

11

enormous issue, and the computation of ownership and

12

corporate -- corporate responsibility for subsidiaries is

13

an issue that lawyers deal with every day in commercial

14

litigation, and lawyers have well-established techniques

15

to ferret out the corporate change of ownership and

16

it's -- it's done all the time.

17

We don't think -- it clearly can be an issue,

18

but we don't think that that's a particularly

19

insurmountable issue here, and, in fact, there's certainly

20

no indication --

21

QUESTION:

Your -- your principle would apply no

22

matter how many tiers up they go?

23

think the second tier is the limit?

24
25

MR. PADEN:

I -- I assume you don't

So long as the State's ownership

interest is the majority ownership interest, Your Honor,

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

3
4

there could be -QUESTION:

Even though the name of the State

does not appear until you get six tiers up?
MR. PADEN:

That's correct.

Our position would

5

be that so long as the State's interest is a majority

6

interest, that would be the limiting principle, and I

7

think that's what the words of the statute seem

8

to suggest --

9

QUESTION:

Why do you limit to the majority?

10

Supposing they have practical control as in other

11

situations, you look at who really runs the company.

12
13
14
15
16

MR. PADEN:

Well, the statute says majority

ownership, Your Honor, and we think that -QUESTION:

But it doesn't say majority ownership

of grandchildren of the parent.
MR. PADEN:

It says a majority ownership

17

interest, Your Honor, and we think a majority ownership

18

interest is about as broad a term as -- as could be

19

conjured up to try to describe generically the concept of

20

ownership.

21

was going to apply to entities from nations all around the

22

world, with many different kinds of economic systems, and

23

in some countries the notion of ownership isn't even so

24

clearly established.

25

I think Congress had in mind that this statute

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I suppose it could mean

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

ownership of other forms, for instance, an oil-drilling

2

venture, a working interest of 70 percent, which is not

3

usually called a share.

4

MR. PADEN:

5

QUESTION:

It's --

That's true.
So -- so there -- there's work for

6

that phrase in the statute to do without adopting your

7

position, it seems to me.

8
9

MR. PADEN:

There is.

There are certainly other

kinds of ownership in our legal system -- partnership

10

interests are an obvious example -- which don't

11

necessarily refer to share ownership.

12

But ownership interest is a very, very broad

13

term, and it -- we think that if Congress had intended

14

this to be so specifically limited to direct -- directly

15

owned entities, it would have said directly owned --

16

QUESTION:

Well, it can --

17

QUESTION:

Your argument would be stronger if it

18

were a stand-alone term, but it isn't.

19

shares, and so one can say, well, we're going to read

20

ownership interest, shares or other ownership interest as

21

something, say, equivalent to a stock certificate.

22

It comes after

You -- it -- it doesn't just say, ownership

23

interest, and I think that that's why the statute itself

24

doesn't answer the question.

25

MR. PADEN:

Well, we think, Your Honor, that the

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

phrase needs to be read as a whole, and we do not believe

2

that this is a situation, when the statute is read as a

3

whole, that the -- that the principle of redundancy and

4

superfluousness which Judge Kozinski felt, decided in this

5

case dictated the -- the restriction to direct ownership

6

should apply.
QUESTION:

7

Do you -- do you agree with the

8

respondents' contention, the United States' contention

9

that foreign countries would not -- would not give us this

10

break, that generally speaking, in international law

11

they -- they'll only look to the ownership of the

12

immediate company?
MR. PADEN:

13

I -- I think that that's true, Your

14

Honor, but I think it requires a comment.

15

the -- the structure of this statute very uniquely

16

reflects our Federalist system, and -- and the -- this

17

alleged disparity between treatment in this country and

18

other countries I think is something of a red herring.

19

Congress for the most part, in establishing this system,

20

I believe it's fair to say contemplated that commercially

21

owned ventures of foreign States would be subject to suit,

22

that --

23

QUESTION:

I think that

I -- I thought -- I remember when

24

they enacted the FSIA.

I was around, and I -- I recollect

25

quite vividly that its object was to bring United States

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

domestic law into conformity with the new, accepted

2

international determination of when -- when sovereign

3

immunity should be respected and when it shouldn't, and if

4

that's the case, and if you acknowledge that the general

5

principle internationally is not to go beyond the

6

ownership of the immediate company, then I don't know why

7

language which -- which is susceptible of that meaning

8

shouldn't be given that meaning.

9

MR. PADEN:

I think there's an answer to that

10

question, Your Honor.

11

would be subject to suit, but it would typically be

12

subject to suit -- I don't think there are too many

13

foreign countries that have our Federalist system, and

14

certainly not too many foreign countries that have our

15

deeply ingrained right to a jury trial.

16

most part, was saying these suits should go forward.

17

In -- in foreign nations, an entity

Congress, for the

One of the purposes of the act was to bring

18

commercially owned ventures of foreign States within the

19

subject of -- of litigation and make them susceptible to

20

claims, but Congress said that in doing that, because of

21

potential sensitivities that could exist, they would

22

accord those entities the same kinds of privileges that

23

the Federal Government gets when the Federal Government

24

waives its immunity, so that --

25

QUESTION:

How can they be sensitive to

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

something that they're willing to do to us?

2

the -- the potential sensitivity, if -- if they would hold

3

the United States liable in such a situation, I mean,

4

would -- would not recognize sovereign immunity of the --

5

of the indirectly owned United States entity, how could

6

they be offended by our doing the same?
MR. PADEN:

7

I mean,

My sense is that the Congress'

8

concern about sensitivities was -- was a little different

9

than that.

I don't think the notion was offense at being

10

sued.

11

have a -- an -- a -- an interest, potentially -- not in

12

every single case, but potentially significant interest in

13

the manner and treatment of claims against entities

14

that -- that they owned.

15

I think the notion is that foreign States would

QUESTION:

They may have --

Is your point that there are no other

16

countries that have our dual Federal system with State

17

courts and Federal courts, so you're not urging that

18

there's substantive sovereign immunity.

19

the jurisdiction side, you should have a right, or

20

Congress meant to give you a right to have access to

21

Federal court rather than State court.

22

MR. PADEN:

You're saying, on

That's correct, Your Honor.

23

There -- there are cases, but I think they're quite rare,

24

where a commercial entity might actually be able to

25

contend that it has immunity, but for the most part,

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Congress was thinking --

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. PADEN:

Are you contending that here?
Well, we've pled it in our answer,

4

Your Honor, but the issue has -- has not been crossed in

5

this particular case, because the judge in -- in the

6

district court held that we weren't even a foreign State,

7

so the question didn't even arise.
There are -- whether or not an entity is immune,

8
9

of course, if it is a foreign State, depends upon whether

10

one of the exceptions in the statute applies, and the

11

commercial activity exception requires direct effects on

12

the United States, and so forth.

13

issues of treaty waivers, there are a number of issues -QUESTION:

14

There's -- there are

For purposes of your argument now,

15

can we assume that you are not claiming the substantive

16

immunity and the question is a forum question, whether you

17

can have access to a Federal forum?
MR. PADEN:

18
19

I think you can assume that, Your

Honor, but I think -QUESTION:

20

Counsel for -- I'm just not sure we

21

ever get to this question.

This statute, the foreign

22

sovereign immunity statute is written in the present

23

tense.

person, and a majority of whose shares or other ownership

25

interest is owned by a foreign State, and when the action

It talks about an entity that is a separate legal

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

was filed, there was no such ownership, so how do we even

2

get to the first question?
MR. PADEN:

3

We get to the first question, Your

4

Honor, because the use of the present tense does not

5

clearly indicate the point in time at which the present

6

tense exists.

7

circumstances in some of the subsequent provisions that

8

discuss immunity to discuss actions that clearly took

9

place at the time the events arose.

This statute uses the present tense in many

QUESTION:

10

Well, what do we do with diversity

11

jurisdiction?

Supposing a person -- supposing diversity

12

jurisdiction exists at the time the suit is filed, but by

13

the time it gets up on appeal, it does not?
MR. PADEN:

14

I don't -- the font, the

15

jurisdictional font of this statute, Your Honor is not

16

diversity, it's Federal question.
QUESTION:

17

This --

No, but I -- I would like to know

18

just for purposes of analogy, the -- when something exists

19

at the time the suit is filed, but is lost during its

20

process.

21

MR. PADEN:

I think that's going to have to be

22

an issue that is decided in -- in cases as they develop.

23

There have been some cases where entities were privatized

24

during the course of litigations, and courts, I believe,

25

have consistently held that in that case, the immunity --

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act jurisdictional

2

premise is not lost because it existed at the time of the

3

claim.

4

The preponderant case law here, Your Honor, has

5

been to look either to the time of the acts that gave rise

6

to the claim, or to the time of the filing of the suit,

7

and there's a -- a nice opinion by Judge Kaplan in the

8

Southern District, in -- in the Belgrade case, which kind

9

of synthesizes those cases.

10

We -- the -- in the jurisdictional determination

11

under this statute, the way it's structured, a court very

12

frequently has to look at the acts giving rise to the

13

claim in order even to decide if it has jurisdiction,

14

because, as Your Honor will recall, in section 1330,

15

jurisdiction depends upon a determination, a) that a party

16

is a foreign State, and b) that one of the exceptions

17

applies, and most of those exceptions require an

18

examination, whether or not the acts that gave rise to the

19

claim were commercial in nature, where they took place, so

20

that the -- it's not at all unusual in the context of this

21

statute to say that the actions that gave rise to the

22

claim are the point of reference for the jurisdictional

23

determination.

24
25

QUESTION:

Why -- why would we do that?

we -- if we took your view, there are quite a few

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

If

1

jurisdictional statutes, I guess, which talk about action

2

against a foreign State.

3

all those to say they mean actions against a former

4

foreign State, so if you sued Illyria or Bohemia, you

5

would suddenly discover you could get into Federal court,

6

while if you don't take your -- your approach, you'd say

7

the -- the question of -- that you're worried about will

8

arise when they get to the substance of the issue in the

9

State court.

10

MR. PADEN:

Wouldn't we then have to read

Your Honor, we think that looking at

11

the time of the events that gave rise to the claim is the

12

approach that most closely comports with the policies and

13

purposes behind this act.

14

What Congress was sensitive about is when the

15

actions of foreign State instrumentalities are called

16

before the courts of the United States to be adjudicated,

17

and Congress indicated that there were sensitivities in

18

those situations that -- should be respected by according

19

a broad right to hear in court --

20
21
22

QUESTION:

What's -- what's the sensitivity if

somebody decides to sue Czarist Russia?
MR. PADEN:

Well, there's probably a statute of

23

limitations claims on that, Your Honor, but I think the

24

question is whether the -- whether the acts that gave rise

25

to the claim are at issue in the case, and I don't think

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

it's difficult to imagine --

2

QUESTION:

You know, there -- I -- I just don't

3

agree with you that that's -- that's the policy of the

4

United States.

5

Federal court, there -- there is in Federal law a thing

6

called the Act of State Doctrine under which we will -- we

7

will honor and accept the action of a foreign country

8

conducted within its own borders and will not allow that

9

to be challenged in a suit in the United States.

There -- apart from who can get into

It's

10

a -- it's a longstanding doctrine, and yet we do --

11

certainly do not say that any time an act of State is

12

involved in a piece of litigation, there's Federal

13

jurisdiction.

14

This act doesn't seek to do that.

It seems to

15

me the Federal jurisdiction has nothing to do with whether

16

the actions of a foreign State are the -- are the subject

17

matter of the litigation, but rather whether the foreign

18

State is a party to the litigation.

19

MR. PADEN:

Well, Your Honor, except for Judge

20

Kozinski below, every circuit court that has looked at

21

this and looked at the legislative history has concluded,

22

as did the ABA working group, which recently did an

23

extensive study of this statute, and that group was made

24

up of prominent international relations professors and

25

practitioners, that actions of foreign States remain

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

potentially politically sensitive even after an entity is

2

sold.

3

The potential here is the point.

This is kind

4

of a prophylactic statute.

5

that in each and every case, there will be intense foreign

6

relations issues, but I -- for example, the foreign State

7

may very well have ongoing financial obligations for

8

pre-privatization acts.

9

amici before the Court today in the State of France.

10

QUESTION:

I don't think anybody's saying

That's the case with one of the

Mr. Paden, if you would look

11

particularly to the diversity statute, and now there's

12

a -- a provision that expressly deals with a foreign

13

State, everything else in diversity, you would agree, it

14

depends on the time suit was brought, and so if you moved

15

in the interim -- there was diversity when it happened,

16

but you move in the interim, when the complaint is filed

17

there's no more diversity.

18

I take it you're asking us, within the very same

19

statute, 1332(a), to interpret a foreign State differently

20

so that its nationality at the time of suit doesn't count,

21

only at the time of the act, and that would be anomalous

22

within very same provision, 1332(a), that you would treat

23

one one way, citizens of different States, that has to be

24

as of the time the complaint is filed, but a foreign State

25

only at the time the event occurred.

17

1

MR. PADEN:

Well, two responses, if I may.

2

First of all, we're not suggesting that it should only be

3

the time of the events that gave rise to the claim.

4

believe the appropriate rule is the rule expressed in the

5

consensus of case law today, that it would be either the

6

time the claim was filed, or the time of the acts.

7
8

But your question about section -- section 1330
is -- is a very good question.

have to be a foreign entity at the time suit was brought?

MR. PADEN:

Honor, and invoke -- and -- and --

qualify as a foreign instrumentality when it brings the

MR. PADEN:

Can it

this incident that we're suing about?

11

MR. PADEN:

I believe that if the acts at -- at

stake took place at the time it was a foreign sovereign,
it should be able to do that, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Those are -- then you are

12

interpreting within the very same statute a citizen of a

13

State would be treated one way, or a -- a -- an entity

14

that was once a foreign State but is no longer would be

15

treated another way?

16

MR. PADEN:

That's correct.

I think the

17

question -- whether or not an entity is a foreign State,

18

the analysis is the same, but for purposes of when that

19

analysis is pertinent, it may be different.

20

different when we're talking about what -- the rules about

21

execution of judgments than at the time of filing a claim.

It may be

1

State instrumentalities are going to be adjudicated

2

outside the structure and protections of this act.

3

court juries all around the country will be sitting in

judgment on acts of State-owned entities, and that is

5

fundamentally contrary to what Congress wanted to -- to

6

have happen.

7

State

In this very case I think we -- we posed a

8

hypothetical that, if we just change the facts

9

significantly but slightly, if -- if Dead Sea Bromine was

10

the sole manufacturer of the toxic, the pesticide at issue

11

in this case, and if Dead Sea Bromine, the acts of a -- an

12

instrumentality of the State of Israel, closely monitored

13

and overseen through the Government company's law

14

structure, have been alleged to be the sole manufacturer

15

of this product, the man -- the party that sought and

16

obtained approvals through, as alleged in the complaint,

17

not being entirely candid about known health risks, had

18

knowingly marketed it in the Third World, had been --

19

whose actions had been called appalling by Senator Leahy

20

in a public hearing, if that entity was on trial before a

21

lot of different juries in various parts of Texas and

22

Louisiana, being called up as a Israeli chemical company

23

who had done all these things, I think it's not at all

24

difficult to imagine that the State of Israel might have

25

some interest in that case.

QUESTION:

Well, you've made another significant

2

change, because it wasn't the plaintiffs who brought the

3

Israeli corporations into this action.

4

sued Dole, I thought, and Dole impleaded the Israeli

5

company.
MR. PADEN:

6

The plaintiffs

That's definitely true, Your Honor,

7

but I'm simply trying to show that there could be a

8

hypothetical situation that's not entirely far-fetched,

9

where -- where a State's ongoing interest in litigation

10

against an entity for acts that took place when the State

11

had responsibility for it in the sense that it owned it,

12

were at stake.
QUESTION:

13

Well, but if the State gives up the

14

corporation, and no longer is part of it, I would have

15

thought that that's just one of the risks that they'd have

16

to run.

17

they're worried about it, keep control of the corporation.

18

If you're not that worried about it, then when you release

19

the corporation, you're subject to a lot of State court

20

lawsuits.

Why -- why -- I mean, they -- if they want -- if

Is that -- why is that --

21

MR. PADEN:

22

QUESTION:

Well -I can't get much of a feeling one way

23

or the other about that, to tell you the truth.

24

I don't -- can you say something that will make it quite

25

clear that would be a terrible thing?

I --

1

MR. PADEN:

That's clearly a policy judgment,

2

and what we're left with is this -- the wording of the

3

statute and the purposes and policies that lay behind it,

4

and we think that with that information before us,

5

Congress' concern about the risk and the sensitivities

6

both in terms of uniform -- the desirability for uniform

7

decisions and potential risks and bias that can take place

8

in multifarious State court juries, those were to be not

9

present when we were going to allow claims to go forward

10

against State entities, and where the acts at issue are

11

the acts of the State entity, those same interests would

12

seem to be implicated.
Many States -- privatization, of course, is a

13
14

fairly widespread phenomenon in the last decade, and what

15

happened to our client has happened to many formerly State

16

majority-owned entities.
QUESTION:

17

And a lot of those tort claims are

18

going to be for continuing actions, so in your view, if

19

the chemical is disseminated partly while the State is the

20

owner of the company and partly while it isn't, then what

21

happens?
MR. PADEN:

22

If -- so long as within the

23

allegations of the complaint, actions of a foreign State

24

instrumentality are at stake, then it should be within the

25

claim.

Your Honor, this case poses an even, I think

2

more stark example.

As -- as noted by the court below,

3

this particular litigation is, I think in Judge Kozinski's

4

words, one part of a large broadbased litigation, I think

5

he used the word war.
The Delgado case out of the Fifth Circuit was --

6
7

it arose out of cases that began in 1994 in Texas, based

8

on the same claims, based upon the same structure of

9

parties, and at that time we were majority-owned by

10

Israel, so under the rule propounded by the respondents

11

and the Solicitor General there would be Federal

12

jurisdiction over the -- that part of the cases, but if

13

someone waited to sue until later, there wouldn't be.

based upon the -- the information in the -- in the amicus

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. MASSEY

9

Yes, that's correct, Your Honor.

MR. MASSEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to begin with the first question

12

presented.

Owning shares of stock in a parent corporation

13

in our view should not be equated with owning shares in

14

the subsidiary.

15

act, the structure, and its purposes, beginning with the

16

distinctive text of 1603(b)(2), which, as Justice Ginsburg

17

noted, does not refer to ownership in the abstract, it

18

refers to a special legal kind of ownership.

19

majority of shares or other ownership interests and, in

20

using that familiar phraseology of corporate law, it's

21

borrowing something which is related to the Meyer opinion,

22

I think, that Justice Breyer delivered this morning, the

23

notion that there's a degree of separateness between a

24

corporation and a shareholder.

25

turned on the liabilities that the shareholder would not

MR. MASSEY:

QUESTION:

Are you talking about a phrase, or a

concept?
MR. MASSEY:

8
9

Well, the phrase in particular,

Your Honor.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. MASSEY:

12

Well, the concept of a majority of

shares.

6
7

Well, what -- what is the phrase that

Okay.
The -- as -- I'm sorry, the

concept.
QUESTION:

13

So you're not saying that the phrase,

14

shares or other ownership interest, is a familiar

15

phrase --

16

MR. MASSEY:

Phrase -- no, Your Honor, I'm

17

saying it's a concept, the concept of what it means to own

18

a majority of shares in a corporation and, in particular,

19

1603(b)(2) is written from the perspective of the

20

subsidiary.

21

rather than a top-down perspective, and it asks, from the

22

subsidiary's perspective, who owns the majority of its

23

shares and it is, in our view, the corporate entity which

24

sits directly atop the subsidiary, rather than the foreign

25

State, which may stand several tiers removed.

It's written from a bottom-up perspective,

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

It's sort of telling that in the Dead Sea

2

Company's own corporate disclosure statement, they list as

3

their -- as the owner of Dead Sea -- Israel Chemicals

4

Limited, which is the company which sits directly above

5

Dead Sea Bromine.

6

goes on to say that Israel Chemicals Limited is, in turn,

7

held by another company, which is the Israel Corporation,

8

and it doesn't claim that the Israel -- it doesn't state

9

that the Israel Corporation is the owner of Dead Sea

The corporate disclosure statement then

10

Bromine.

That's just the natural way we talk about it in

11

the -- in the -- especially in the corporate law realm,

12

which Congress was adopting in 16(b) -- 1603(b)(2).
There are several textual clues in section 1603

13
14

that Congress was adopting the principle of corporate

15

separateness.

16

be -- a -- a showing that the agency be a separate legal

17

person.

18

1603(b)(1) requires that a corporation

1610(b), which governs attachments, limits

19

attachments of property to claims against the particular

20

agency or instrumentality against whom the claim is

21

raised, and this Court, in the First National Citibank

22

case, held that the -- under the FSIA, the -- the property

23

and assets of a foreign-owned corporation are distinct

24

from the property and assets of the foreign State itself,

25

so this is not even a case like Bestfoods, where this

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Court said that Congress' silence was audible in -- in

2

that Congress was legislating against these background

3

corporate law principles.

4

textual signs that Congress was adopting a principle of

5

corporate law.

6

Here, there are quite clear

Now, the primary argument on the other side,

7

this is a -- the indirect shareholding is a form of other

8

ownership interest, and I -- we think that is not a proper

9

reading of this statute.

As Justice Kennedy pointed out,

10

there are other forms of ownership interests in the world.

11

There are shares in an oil venture.

12

Authority, for example, doesn't have stock.

13

Government simply owns it.

14

The Tennessee Valley
The Federal

The stock has been retired.

Congress was dealing here with foreign legal

15

systems which may have different ways of framing equity

16

interests.

17

imagine there might not be shares, so in our view the

18

phrase, other ownership interests, is meant to take into

19

account those sorts of equity holdings, so in this case --

Socialist countries, for example, you can

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. MASSEY:

22

Because?

Because?

Well, because Congress was dealing

with other foreign owners, other --

23

QUESTION:

You know, I mean --

24

MR. MASSEY:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- nobody doubts that there are other

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

ways of owning corporations.

2

other way of owning it is like, under the Public Utility

3

Holding Company Act, you have a -- a pyramid of shares

4

with intervening corporations.

5

the only other way.

6

and then you say, no, that one other way is not another

7

way, because?

8
9

They're just saying, one

They're not saying that's

They're saying that's one other way,

MR. MASSEY:

Because there -- we believe it's --

there are two reasons, primarily.

First, is -- the first

10

part of the phrase, shares, already takes care of stock.

11

It would be unreasonable, in our view, to say indirect

stock counts as other --

intervening corporations organized in certain ways --

22

MR. MASSEY:

23

QUESTION:

Right.
-- as under the Public Utility

24

25

heard the word -- you see, that's why I keep asking,

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

because.

2

MR. MASSEY:

3

QUESTION:

Right.
Because to me it's an unusual way,

4

not that unusual.

The -- the law books are filled with

5

cases involving that, under the act I cited, and -- and so

6

they say, that's one way.

7

MR. MASSEY:

8

QUESTION:

9

Now I want to know why that isn't one

way.

10

MR. MASSEY:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. MASSEY:

13
14
15

That --

stock.

Because it -One other way.
Right.

First, because it's still

Even if it's indirectly held, it's still stock.
QUESTION:

And I don't quite see that,

because --

16

MR. MASSEY:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. MASSEY:

Well -Go ahead.
Okay, and then second is, you're

19

absolutely right, the law books are filled, the U.S. Code

20

is filled with many other phrasings of direct, indirect

21

references to affiliates, references to beneficial

22

ownership, all the kinds of things, a control test, as

23

Justice Stevens mentioned, all the kinds of things that

24

could capture this kind of interest, but instead we have

25

the very distinctive phrasing that says, stock, and in our

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

view, once you count stock first as a direct majority

2

ownership, you shouldn't go back and count it again as an

3

indirect form.

4

QUESTION:

Now --

5

MR. MASSEY:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. MASSEY:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. MASSEY:

-- I know that's your -- your view.
I know.

I know.

Now -- but let me push the because --

QUESTION:

10

The other ought to be reserved --

Yes.
-- one step further.

Suppose I

11

thought that the word, other ownership interest, is at

12

least open to this unusual type of arrangement as one form

13

of ownership interest.

14

MR. MASSEY:

15

QUESTION:

Right.
Still you should say, you shouldn't

16

interpret it that way, because?

17

MR. MASSEY:

Because the number of principles

18

that animate the statute, first, this is a jurisdictional

19

statute.

20

precisely with clear, bright line rules and, in our view,

21

the -- the kind of direct legal ownership of stock is a

22

kind of bright line rule and the Court should not depart

23

from it.

24
25

Jurisdictional statutes should be construed

Second, the statute already contains, in the
first clause of 1603(b)(3), the -- the so-called Oregon

which perform sovereign functions which are staffed by

3

Government employees over which the Government has a

4

significant degree of control.

5

this case.

6

below adverse to the petitioners, and it's not before this

7

Court, but that clause would capture all of the

8

stereotypical cases at the heart of the Foreign Sovereign

9

Immunities Act, so we ought not stretch this part of the

10
11
12

The Oregon test captures governmental entities

That's not at issue in

That was decided both by -- in both courts

statute to cover it.
QUESTION:

All right, now if I think it is not a

stretch, but just another form of ownership --

13

MR. MASSEY:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. MASSEY:

16

QUESTION:

Right.
-- I'm putting this hypothetically -Right.
-- I then go on to think, you know,

17

I cannot think of a reason in the world, not even one, not

18

even a shadow of one, as to why Congress would have wanted

19

to say, when country X owns business A, it gets into

20

Federal court, but when everything is the same, but for a

21

stack of papers this thick which puts a bunch of

22

intervening paper corporations between A and Z, it doesn't

23

want it to get into Federal court, I think what could

24

they -- what human being could possibly think of any

25

conceivable reason for drawing that difference, and at

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that point -- I'm putting it as strongly as I can --

2

I come up with a blank.

3

I can't think of one.

I used to have relatives who had little tiny

4

corporations, and the number in between was a matter of

5

tax law or something.

MR. MASSEY:

-- doing the same thing.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. MASSEY:

Right.
Now, I put it as strongly as I can.
Right, and of course Congress is --

12

Congress has to legislate by category.

13

dealing with the example of 100 percent subsidiaries.

14

Congress is drawing a general rule and, as a general rule,

15

the -- the line it drew was reasonable because Congress

16

was interested in facilitating suits against foreign

17

States in the United States courts.

18

purposes that's laid out in 1602 in the statute, and

19

reading the statute the petitioners' way would disserve

20

those purposes.

21

It's not simply

That's one of the

First, it would impose important procedural

22

burdens on litigants that Congress did not want to impose.

23

It would eliminate traditional State long arm statutes.

24

It would eliminate the right to jury trial.

25

create immunity questions, because once immunity is

1

invoked -QUESTION:

2
3

Why -- why would it eliminate the

right to jury trial?
MR. MASSEY:

4

Well, under the FSIA, once a --

5

a -- an entity is deemed to be a foreign State, the right

6

to jury trial is lost, even if an exception to immunity is

7

subsequently found to apply.
It would -- the -- the other burdens it imposes,

8
9
10

it eliminates the traditional attachment provision
that's -QUESTION:

11

Of course it does have a few -- but

12

nonetheless my question is, what conceivable reason could

13

there be for saying those special advantages disappear

14

when there is country A, and when there is country A to Z,

15

since the only difference between A and A to Z, I'd

16

repeat, is a bunch of paper?
MR. MASSEY:

17

Well, again, as I said, Congress is

18

not just legislating with that specific example of

19

100 percent subsidiaries, it's using a -- the general

20

category.

21

It -- it has to operate by general rule.
I think other examples, though, would show that

22

when you have multiple tiers, there -- the surprise factor

23

significantly increases.

24

litigants would be surprised to discover that they were

25

not dealing with an ordinary commercial entity but,

Congress was concerned that

34
Alderson Reporting Company

increases as you go down the corporate tier to the nth

tier.

4

Also, there are potentially complex factual

5

inquiries as you go down the -- a -- a tier.

In this

6

case, there are organization charts which show how the

7

shareholdings have been computed, but consider, when

8

ownership is not expressed through shares but through some

9

percentage of assets or partnership interests which are

10

not going to be reflected in a shareholder ledger, but are

11

going to be the potential subject of controversy in a

court, and I think the potential for factual disputes

increases.

That -- that's -- that's correct,

Your Honor.

In our view, Congress didn't have to use

concept of a majority ownership of shares.

direct, because the owner of a majority of shares in -- in

independent way of resolving this case.
Ever since 1824, when Chief Justice Marshall

3

announced Mollan against Torrance, the rule has been that

4

jurisdiction is determined as of the date of filing the

5

complaint.

6

diversity cases?

7

diversity cases have been held to be -- to be governed by

8

that rule, and the response we hear is that this is a

9

Federal question case, but, of course, even Federal

The Chief Justice asked, what is the rule in
Well, since Anderson and Watt in 1891,

10

question cases are governed by the familiar rule that the

11

date is given by the -- the filing of the complaint.

12

That's -- United States against Keene Corporation in 1993

13

reflected that principle.

14

And as Justice Ginsburg noted, even if some

15

parts of the act are a Federal question, it's also telling

16

that in 1332(a)(4), Congress created a new species of

17

diversity jurisdiction, so accepting the petitioners'

18

argument here would lead to the anomalous situation where

19

there's a diversity part of the statute that's going to be

20

governed by the Mollan against Torrance rule, and there

21

will be a Federal question part of the statute that would

22

be governed by a different rule.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Paden said that that (a)(4) would

24

be interpreted by the different rule, so he's being

consistent with --

MR. MASSEY:

Okay -- well, I misunderstood.

2

I apologize, but then that also means that there are some

3

diversity rules that are being interpreted one way, and

4

other diversity rules being interpreted a different way.

5

Either way, there's an anomaly, and it appears to us the

6

simplest way to resolve it would simply be to adhere to

7

the longstanding principle that the date on which the

8

complaint is filed is the relevant time to take a

9

snapshot.
That's also more administratively feasible,

10
11

because you can imagine that the rule of when the

12

underlying conduct occurred is a -- is a -- might be

would be determinative.

QUESTION:

Well, their point, though, is that,

first my examples were slightly absurd, and -- which they

were -- and secondly, that in any real case where -- where

9

you have, say, Communist Russia you're suing, or -- or

10

more recent former States, you're -- you're actually suing

11

the State, and the -- the defense is, but that State no

12

longer exists, like Bosnia or something.

13

There are a few things that are more involved in

14

foreign relationships, and -- and boy, to suddenly throw

15

that to 50 State courts is a total nightmare if you're

16

really worried about the foreign State, so even though it

17

creates differences between the diversity jurisdiction and

18

the other, we better keep these in Federal court, or we're

19

all in trouble.

20

I mean, that's what I took them to say.

MR. MASSEY:

Right.

Well, I think the -- the

21

answer to the jurisdiction point and the sort of State

22

court point is that they're already is a provision in the

23

diversity statute, 1332(a)(3), I believe it is, that deals

24

with citizens of foreign countries, so there's already

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

11
12
13
14

Thank you, Mr. Massey.

MR. MINEAR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Congress enacted the FSIA against the backdrop

15

of venerable corporate law principles, including the

16

principle that a parent corporation and subsidiary are

17

distinct, and that the shareholders of a parent

18

corporation are not the shareholders of a subsidiary

19

corporation.

20

ownership in that familiar legal sense.

21

We submit that the FSIA refers to share

Viewed in that light, a foreign State's majority

22

ownership of the shares of a parent gives the foreign

23

State control over the subsidiary, but it does not give

24

that foreign State ownership of the subsidiary's shares.

25

If Congress had intended that the FSIA would extend agency

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

or instrumentality status to the foreign State's control

2

of the subsidiary, it could easily have said exactly that.

3

QUESTION:

Well, they don't think of these

4

things all the time, so -- so what -- what about -- they

5

just don't.

6

we have a difficult problem, so I wondered, with the

7

language, and nobody accepts -- I just want to know the

8

reason for this, and I'm sure it's not a tenable

9

interpretation, because nobody's advanced it, but if you

It's -- and that's -- we have -- that's why

10

look at the first part, literally speaking, it says a

11

foreign State includes an instrumentality of a foreign

12

State, and so an instrumentality of a foreign State, is,

13

among other things, a corporation, the majority of shares

14

of which the foreign state owns.

15

the first corporation in the tier, A.

16

is included in the term, foreign State, it therefore is a

17

foreign State.

18

a company whose shares, the majority of which are owned by

19

a foreign State, and so forth down the line.

20

And that's true as to

That's what it says.

Well, now, since A

And therefore, B is

Now, literally, that's what it says, and so

21

what's wrong if I can't think of any reason why they'd

22

want a difference, and the -- that language literally

23

covers it, what's wrong with that?

24
25

MR. MINEAR:

There's a very strong textual

indication that that's not a correct reading, and that is

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

found in section 1603(b)(2), where it speaks of a majority

2

of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by

3

the foreign State, or political subdivision thereof.

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

5

MR. MINEAR:

Now, obviously, if Congress had

6

intended that recursive use that you've described, they

7

would not have included, political subdivision thereof,

8

which is also a part of a foreign State and, in fact, that

9

provision excludes agency or instrumentality.
We think what the Court can draw from this is

10
11

that Congress was using foreign State in a very strict

12

sense of simply a foreign nation.
QUESTION:

13

Or -- but you're referring there back

14

to the intent of Congress.

I see that linguistic point,

15

but if we're referring back to the intent of Congress, I'm

16

back to my question I asked before, what possible intent

17

of Congress could the interpretation that you advance

18

further?

19

questions I asked before.

I mean, what reason is there?

20

MR. MINEAR:

21

QUESTION:

The same

I'm just --

We think --- you've got me back to that because

22

of your response, which referred to the intent of

23

Congress.
MR. MINEAR:

24
25

reasons.

We think there are two very clear

First of all, Congress was drawing a bright

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

line.

We think that Congress wanted to avoid litigation

2

over where to litigate.

3

that -- and by doing so it spoke to ownership of majority

4

of shares in the traditional legal sense, which provides a

5

very bright line rule.

6

Nothing's more wasteful than

We also think that this -- this reading must

7

be -- must take into account that we're not speaking

8

solely of the interest of foreign nations, but also of the

9

interest of American litigants.

Congress was trying to

10

strike a balance between the two, and the balance that we

11

suggest here is one that recognizes that American

12

litigants have an interest in a clear delineation of who

13

is entitled to foreign sovereign status and who is not.

14

We think our interpretation reflects both of those

15

concerns.

16
17

QUESTION:

But the statute does refer to other

ownership interests.

18

MR. MINEAR:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Yes, it -Other forms of ownership.

What does

that cover, then?
MR. MINEAR:

Again, Your Honor, we think that it

22

ought to be -- that this term ought to be interpreted in

23

terms of a -- a test that provides a bright line rule.

24

think other ownership interest refers to something that is

25

an alternative to shares, such as, as Justice Kennedy has

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

We

1
2

described in ownership in -- in a joint venture.
We don't think that Congress intended to

3

complicate the inquiry by making inquiries into whether

4

something that is sometimes described as control should be

5

treated as a different type of ownership interest.

6

think that here, that what Congress was seeking was

7

clarity, and the interpretation that we're providing is

8

designed to provide that clarity for foreign nations and

9

for American litigants as well.

10

We

Now, we think it's important to remember that

11

Congress drew this line with the understanding that

12

foreign instrumentalities is a narrow term, particularly

13

as used by foreign nations.

14

would not provide immunity to corporations.

15

that Congress took the step of extending it to a

16

first-tier corporation, but concluded that that is where

17

the line should be drawn, it should go no further, and we

18

think a narrow construction of this term is also

19

appropriate in -- in the face of the fact that Congress is

20

granting a special privilege, a comity-based privileged,

21

that not ought to be extended beyond what other foreign

22

nations recognize in applying their immunity laws to the

23

United States.

24
25

Foreign nations by and large
We believe

This is particularly so when the construction
that we urge is very unlikely to lead to foreign friction

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

with other nations.

Because, as -- because foreign

2

nations do not recognize the immunity that's being sought

3

here in their own courts, it's very unlikely that they

4

will object to our recognition of nonimmunity on the same

5

basis in our courts.

6

Now, even if this Court concluded that the FSIA

7

granted agency or instrumentality status to subsidiaries,

8

the Dead Sea companies would still not qualify because, as

9

noted before, they did -- did not have that status at the

10

time that this suit was brought.

We think that the

11

diversity statute model provides the appropriate test

12

here.
Diversity jurisdiction is predicated on whether

13
14

or not the parties are diverse at the time the suit is

15

brought.

16

Likewise, jurisdiction that is based on the status of a

17

foreign entity ought to be determined at the foreign

18

ownership's --

It's based on the status of the parties.

help.
MR. MINEAR:

17

that this problem would never arise, but typically, these

18

types of suits are brought against another State that now

stands in the shoes of the former State, and there might

MR. MINEAR:

We think it is primarily a

theoretical problem.
We think that Congress had no compelling reasons

4

to provide immunity for past agencies and

5

instrumentalities that are no longer associated with the

6

foreign -- foreign State.

7

there's other mechanisms, such as the Act of State

8

Doctrine, that provide protection of the foreign sovereign

9

interests in those cases and, in any event, a foreign

As Justice Scalia pointed out,

10

11

has access to Federal court jurisdiction under the

12

alienage diversity statute, provided that it satisfies

13

the -- the requirements that Congress has set forth.

14

Finally, I'd like to note that because two

15

questions are presented here, the Court does have

16

discretion to reach both of those questions, and we think

17

that there would be an advantage in clarity in the law if

18

the Court did address both the so-called tiering question

19

and the timing question, since they both have led to

20

disputes among litigants in the lower courts.

21

both issues have been fully briefed and, as I say, the

Court does have that power to make that determination if

it so chooses.

20

interest, Mr. Massey suggested that the issues here, and

21

I believe Mr. Minear as well, are related to the issues in

22

the recently decided Meyer case, with which I confess I'm

23

not familiar, but I think also the Bestfoods kind of case.

24
25

We think those cases are very different.

Those

cases relate to liability-creating statutes and, in the

51
Alderson Reporting Company

1

context of a statute that creates liability, whether

2

Congress intended for traditional rules of corporate

3

veil-piercing to be eased somewhat in assigning liability

4

in the case of the Superfund law to the -- to the owner of

5

the contaminated facility.

6

This is not a statute that gives rise to

7

liability.

It defines a category of entities that are

8

within the scope of the -- of the group that Congress

9

intended to -- to vest with a certain limited protection

10

when they will be sued in -- in the United States, namely,

11

a broad right to a Federal forum, and so forth.

12

QUESTION:

We -- we have always construed

13

jurisdictional statutes quite narrowly, going all the way

14

back to Strawbridge against Curtis, that said you have to

15

have complete diversity under the diversity statute, and

16

it seems to me you're asking for something different than

17

that here.

18

MR. PADEN:

I think, Your Honor, that the -- in

19

the first place, of course, the statute has to be

20

construed to the best one can on the words of the statute

21

and the congressional intent.

22

interesting language.

23

of the Sixth Circuit, or maybe the Texas Eastern case in

24

the Third Circuit -- talking about why, in the context of

25

this law, there actually should be a broad interpretation

I think there is some

I -- I believe it's the Delta case

52
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of diversity.

2

because Congress intended to bring within it a certain

3

defined category of -- of entities.

4

Really, that's just another way of saying

I think it's very hard to -- to articulate a

5

reason why Congress would have wanted to bring commercial

6

operations of foreign States within the scope of the

7

statute and say -- let me back up a moment.

8
9

There was a time when Dead Sea Works was the
immediate parent of Dead Sea Bromine, and Dead Sea Works

10

was owned by the State of Israel.

11

to extract manganese and potassium from the Dead Sea.

12

Dead Sea Bromine's job is to extract Dead -- bromine from

13

the Dead Sea.

14

why Congress wanted Dead Sea Works to be within the

15

purpose -- the purview of this statute and Dead Sea

16

Bromine not to be.

17

Dead Sea Works' job is

It's impossible to come up with a rationale

QUESTION:

Well, they listed two.

They said,

18

first of all it's easier for the court not to have to go

19

through the morass of paper and try to figure out who owns

20

what where, and the second one is that, because it's less

21

surprising, at least the customers and others will know,

22

likely, who owns the company, and know it's the State.

23

Those were their two responses.

24
25

MR. PADEN:

Correct.

I -- in terms of ownership

interest, I think it's -- it's a well-known and widely

53
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

used phrase in our law as well as others to be a generic

2

broadbased term.

3

publicly available information just to try to find

4

companies that I think we can say are well-known to be --

5

have certain relationships, and I think it's fair to say,

6

based on news articles and so forth, that General Electric

7

Company is widely understood to own NBC, the broadcasting

8

network.

9

We did a little research on some

It turns out that General Electric Company is

10

the 100 percent shareholder of a company called NBC

11

Holdings, Inc., which is the 100 percent shareholder of

12

NBC, Inc., the broadcasting company.

13

of the board of GE would be astonished to hear the United

14

States and the respondents explain that GE does not have

15

an ownership interest in NBC.

16

QUESTION:

I think the chairman

It's --

I think that was conceded, that for

17

purposes of newspapers reports, and -- yeah, we understand

18

that you would have five tiers down, if only one person

19

owns it, you say, well, that person owns it, even if it's

20

the fifth tier down, but the question is, in this context

21

of a jurisdictional statute -- and I wanted to ask you

22

particularly, you've just heard Mr. Minear's argument, do

23

we, as a Court, owe any special respect to what the

24

executive tells us a statute that deals in the foreign

25

affairs realm means?

54
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. PADEN:

Your Honor, I think in this case

2

that -- that we think that the respect that is owed to the

3

Justice and State Departments in this case is -- is

4

measured by the persuasiveness of the opinions that

5

they're offering.

6

interpretation of the meaning of the statute and

7

congressional intent.

Essentially, they're offering a legal

8

I don't think they've said that the

9

interpretation that we're offering here will impair or

10

jeopardize the conduct of our foreign relations.

11

the only comment in their brief about this is to note that

12

there have not been frictions in foreign relations as a

13

result of the extant state of the law, and the extant

14

state of the law is really in our favor on both points.

15

In fact,

There are a number of cases where privatized

16

entities have been held to be agencies or

17

instrumentalities, and certainly where tiered entities

18

have been, so we think it really is a matter of an

19

analysis of the legal opinions about statutory

20

construction and -- and whether --

21

QUESTION:

But the -- the Government says you

22

are the one who's saying, oh, a foreigner might be

23

offended by the jury trial, whatever.

24
25

MR. PADEN:

We're trying to honor the intent of

Congress, Your Honor.

Congress --

55
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

And -- and the Government answers no,

2

that we don't think this is going to be disturbing foreign

3

nations.

4

You're the one who says that it will.
MR. PADEN:

I think what's salient is what

5

Congress said, Your Honor, and Congress said that when

6

claims are brought, when we are going to allow claims

7

against foreign State entities for their commercial

8

activities or whatever in this country, we're going to

9

accord them the kinds of -- the Federal jurisdiction

10

breadth and lack of jury trial which we accord to

11

ourselves when we agree to be sued.

12

QUESTION:

May I ask you what the purpose of

13

filing this lodging was, this gigantic paper?

14

supposed to read this to figure out what the corporate

15

relationships were, or what was the purpose?

16

MR. PADEN:

Are we

Your Honor, that contains a lot of

17

very detailed material in support of the information that

18

we thought pertinent describing the particular structure

19

of the Government companies law and the legal regimes --

20

QUESTION:

But is this typical of what a

21

district judge would have to look through to figure out

22

ownership under your theory?

23

MR. PADEN:

No, sir.

24

[Laughter.]

25

MR. PADEN:

It doesn't --

-- not at all.

That had nothing

56
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

really to do with ownership.

2

put that material in the record in support of our argument

3

that the company was an organ of the State of Israel

4

within the kind of emerging case law there, and what that

5

material shows is the extensive, detailed

6

interrelationship between the Government companies

7

authority in Israel.

8
9

We -- we actually originally

They made decisions about whether or not the
company was going to have to use company cars, about

10

whether or not they were -- they made -- they made -- they

11

had input in the operation of this company to a minute

12

degree of detail and to, of course, very profound

13

decisions such as budget decisions, who would be on the

14

board of directors.

15

This company, under the Government companies

16

law, a Government subsidiary company is treated, for all

17

intents and purpose the same, whether it's indirectly

18

held, as a Government company which is directly owned, and

19

it -- and this detailed material is really in support of

20

several pages in our brief where we -- where we provide

21

a -- a long paragraph with a series of examples of the

22

extent of the interrelationship between the Government of

23

Israel, the ministers of finance, the Government companies

24

authority, and so forth.
