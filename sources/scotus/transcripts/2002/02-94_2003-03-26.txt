CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in No. 02-94, William Overton v. Michelle Bazzetta.
Mr. Casey.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. CASEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, the lower courts in this case were wrong for

10

two reasons.

First, because the Constitution does not

11

give prison inmates a right to receive in-person visits

12

since that activity is inherently inconsistent with the

13

status as a prisoner and with legitimate penological

14

objectives and second, because the Michigan visitation

15

rules are rational and reasonably related to legitimate

16

penological interest.

17

The Court has recognized the right of intimate

18

association with certain people in certain circumstances

19

outside of the prison context in cases such as Roberts v.

20

United States Jaycees.

21

In Turner v. Safley, the Court examined the

22

question of how to evaluate a right which is recognized

23

outside of the prison context and determine whether it

24

applies inside the prison.

25

The right there was the right to marry.

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

The

1

Court said you should look at the elements or incidents of

2

the rights to determine whether it is affected by

3

incarceration or the pursuit of legitimate corrections

4

goals.

5

attributes of the right of intimate association which

6

respondents assert.

In Roberts, the Court also identified several

These rights include a high degree of

7
8

selectivity and decisions regarding the affiliation,

9

seclusion from others, relative smallness of the group.
Our contention is that all of the these

10
11

attributes are significantly affected by incarceration and

12

they are inherently inconsistent with incarceration.

13

so the --

14
15
16

QUESTION:

And

Well, does the right to association

while in prison survive in some form, do you think?
MR. CASEY:

In -- the right to have the

17

relationship which is what was actually at issue in Safley

18

with marriage and in the Jones case with prisoner -- with

19

the union membership.

20

no effect on the relationship here.

21

about is activity --

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

That status can survive.

There's

What this case is

Noncontact visits, aren't we talking

about here?
MR. CASEY:

Noncontact visits but it involves

activities inside the secure prison walls in furtherance

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

of the relationship.

2

relationship itself, the question is, can prison officials

3

-- do the necessities of prison have an impact on the

4

right of association.

5
6
7

QUESTION:

There's no impact on the

What would exist outside -- what

relationship are you talking about?
MR. CASEY:

The relationships that the prisoners

8

are asserting are family members beyond the definition of

9

the Michigan prison system -- has adopted particularly

10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17

minor nieces and nephews.
QUESTION:

One of the problems with --

Well, presumably children of the

prisoner are included, are they not?
MR. CASEY:

Children of the prisoner are

included within the definition -QUESTION:

There are limited -- they have to be

accompanied by, what is it, a legal guardian?
MR. CASEY:

By a family member within the

18

definition or a legal guardian, that's the Michigan

19

regulation.

20

QUESTION:

As I understand it, the regs

21

originally would have prohibited visits from minor

22

siblings of the prisoner and that has been changed by

23

statute; is that correct?

24
25

MR. CASEY:

There was a statute passed, right at

the close of the district court opinion that permitted the

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Department to permit visits by siblings, the Department

2

changed the regulation to include siblings, minor sibling

3

visits, so that issue is no longer before the courts.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. CASEY:

6

QUESTION:

Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Pardon.
On the class of visitor eligibility

7

then, what we're arguing about is nieces and nephew, minor

8

nieces and nephews?
MR. CASEY:

9

That is the class with respect to

10

minor children, they also have a contention about former

11

inmates and -QUESTION:

12

That's, that's what I meant.

What is

13

the State's interest in -- in restricting visits from

14

minor nieces and nephews of the prisoner?
MR. CASEY:

15

The prison officials testified

16

uniformly that there were serious overcrowding problems,

17

prison management problems, concerns about safety, so the

18

overriding interest was to reduce the volume of visitors.
QUESTION:

19
20

volume?

21

relationship?

There's nothing peculiar to the niece/nephew

22

MR. CASEY:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

So it's simply a means of reducing

That's correct.
You just want to keep the numbers

down and this is one way to do it.
MR. CASEY:

To keep the numbers down, the

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Department is permitted to draw lines.

2

draw a line -QUESTION:

3

And that is to

Is it also of some concern with the

4

activities of children within the prison as opposed to

5

adults?
MR. CASEY:

6

Oh, absolutely.

That -- there was

7

-- there is extensive testimony that not only was there a

8

problem with overcrowding and management, just because of

9

the volume in general, but particularly, because of

10

children.
QUESTION:

11

Mr. Casey, I would like to back up to

12

go where you were when you were responding to Justice

13

O'Connor's question.

14

whatever rights there may be to have a relationship, for

15

example, by telephone call, correspondence, there is

16

absolutely no right to any visitation, even noncontact, so

17

that whatever you permit is a matter of administrative

18

grace?

Do I take it that your position is

Is that your starting position?

19

MR. CASEY:

20

QUESTION:

21

noncontact visitation at all?

22

MR. CASEY:

23

QUESTION:

Yes.

In response to --

There is no right to visitation,

That's correct.
So everything that we're arguing

24

about -- you -- in your view of this is a matter of

25

administrative grace?

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. CASEY:

2

QUESTION:

3

that?

That's correct.
Do you have a fallback position from

And if so, what is it?
MR. CASEY:

4

The Court specified three issues and

5

the first issue is whether there is a right to visitation

6

at all.

7

constitutional right.

8

right.

Our position on that question is there is no
It's a privilege.

It's not a

The second question was whether assuming there

9
10

is some limited right, are the Michigan regulations

11

rational and reasonably related to legitimate

12

correctional goals.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Casey, would you explain -- you

14

have been very clear of what is your position about --

15

round one of this case in the lower courts, when you

16

clarified that your regulations went only to contact

17

visits and then you came around and said it applies to all

18

visits.

19

MR. CASEY:

The way the case evolved -- the

20

regulations on their face apply to all visitation.

The

21

restrictions apply to both contact and noncontact.

When

22

the case was initially filed, there were motions for

23

summary judgment.

24

motion and most of the testimony that was introduced

25

related to contact visitation.

There was a 3-day hearing on that

So when the case first

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

went to the court of appeals, the court of appeals

2

mistakenly viewed the case as relating only to contact

3

visitation.
QUESTION:

4

Well, I got the impression that the

5

State had represented that they -- that they covered only

6

contact visitation?
MR. CASEY:

7

There were statements in the brief

8

referring to contact visitation, largely because that was

9

the evidence that was adduced at the summary judgment

10

proceeding.

11

in their entirety.

12

that it applied to both contact and noncontact.

And the parties, I believe, understood

QUESTION:

13
14

But the complaint challenged the regulations

But the Court thought it only applied

to contact visitation -MR. CASEY:

15

In the court of appeals' first

16

opinion it held that it applied only to contact.

17

went back to the district court and then we had longer

18

trial, more elaborative evidentiary proceeding.
QUESTION:

19

Then it

In the district court the first time

20

around the district court didn't think it was limited to

21

contact?

22

MR. CASEY:

The district court dismissed the

23

complaint in its entirety on our motion.

There was no

24

misrepresentation.

25

statements which led the court of appeals to conclude in

There may have been some unintentional

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the first view -QUESTION:

2

But the district court understood

3

that it was dismissing the complaint with respect to any

4

visitation, contact and noncontact, or we just don't know?
MR. CASEY:

5

The first order of the district

6

court dismissed the complaint in its entirety.

7

complaint, the initial complaint, did not say we are

8

challenging only contact.

9

way the summary judgment evidence went in, it evolved that

10

the -- the court of appeals thought it was related only to

11

contact.

12

distinction between contact and noncontact.

The -- as I say, because of the

But the rules on their face don't make a

QUESTION:

13

And the

May I ask this question? The rules as

14

I understand are at page 174 of the appendix of the cert

15

petition and they don't tell us anything, at least I

16

couldn't find anything, about the number of visits a

17

person can have or how often.

18

the number of times a particular visitor may visit an

19

inmate?

20

MR. CASEY:

Yes.

Do the rules regulate that

At page 111 of the joint

21

appendix, there's a memorandum that was issued in April of

22

1995, which sets out hours of visitation for different

23

institutions -- it varies between institutions.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. CASEY:

111 of the joint appendix?
Of the joint appendix.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

I see.

2

MR. CASEY:

Yes.

3

And it varies -- excuse me,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

4

It limits the number at any one time.

5

But does it limit, you know, you can only have so many

6

visitors a month?

7

MR. CASEY:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes.
Why isn't that sufficient to solve

the problem of overcrowding and too many -- too many

10

people?

11

solve it is just to reduce the number of visits each one

12

of the inmates is allowed to have per month.

13

If -- if you have too many people, an easy way to

MR. CASEY:

That would have been one solution.

14

The Department chose a solution where they evaluated the

15

visitors and concluded that it would be best to make

16

quality visits for close family members following

17

essentially --

18

QUESTION:

Is there any evidence they found out

19

how many nephews and nieces would be excluded by the rules

20

and, therefore, worked that into the quantity

21

determination, that's a strange way to regulate quantity.

22

MR. CASEY:

They did not know in advance how

23

many nieces and nephews.

24

of record.

25

QUESTION:

We simply don't keep that kind

Is there a specific anti-niece -- I

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

didn't understand this case, I guess.

I thought there's a

2

simple determination by the prison authorities, we don't

3

want children in the room, period.

4

exception for that if they're your children.

Now, we'll make an

5

MR. CASEY:

That's essentially what they did.

6

QUESTION:

And the reason had nothing to do --

7

it had something to do with a lot of people, but basically

8

they think children are more dangerous to the child or

9

more disruptive, because they're younger, harder to

10

discipline, they might run around in the room.

They might

11

learn things that -- that they don't want children exposed

12

to the language or behavior of the prisoners, et cetera.

13

So I just thought it was -- now maybe you're telling me,

14

no no, that's not the reason it was totally different.

15

MR. CASEY:

16

QUESTION:

This is quite interesting to me.

17

MR. CASEY:

No, that's one of the bases, it

18
19

No. That's --

would possible to prohibit all children in prisons.
QUESTION:

No, they don't prohibit all children.

20

They say generally children are more of a problem than

21

adults to have in visits.

22

MR. CASEY:

That's correct.

23

QUESTION:

So we draw a line.

24
25

We say no

children except for your own children.
MR. CASEY:

That's correct.

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. CASEY:

3

QUESTION:

4

Right.
That's our position.
So why don't you defend it on that

basis, if that's what it is?
MR. CASEY:

5

Well, I thought I was, I'm sorry if

6

I didn't make that clear, Your Honor.

The Department made

7

decisions on who is to visit.

8

to permit visits with close family members, children,

9

grandchildren, at some point they have to draw a line, as

And they said we are going

10

you've said, Justice Kennedy -- and they drew a line to

11

eliminate certain extended family members.
One of the problems is -- is -- if the Court

12
13

finds that there is a right to visitation, the -- there

14

will be -- I suspect a great deal of additional litigation

15

on where those lines can appropriately be drawn.
Michigan, for example, has very generous rules

16
17

concerning times of visitation, they permit visits on

18

evenings, on weekends and holidays, some States don't do

19

that.

20

will be litigation on --

21
22
23

If there's a right to visitation, I suspect there

QUESTION:

Is there any limit on the number of

times the same person can come in a given month?
MR. CASEY:

No.

There -- inmates, for example,

24

in the lowest security level are entitled to eight visits

25

per month.

And the time is -- is not regulated either. It

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

depends on overcrowding and situations like that.
QUESTION:

2

What adults are permitted? Suppose I

3

don't have any children, I don't have any spouse, I don't

4

even have any siblings.
MR. CASEY:

5

The rule permits an inmate to

6

designate immediate family members as defined by the

7

Department and 10 other individuals.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. CASEY:

Ten others, okay.
Now, there are certain prohibitions,

10

former prisoners are prohibited, I think, unless they're a

11

family member and receive the warden's permission.

12

is being challenged here as well, but -QUESTION:

13

That

In relation to the family, this one

you cut that back from any adult on the filing of the

affidavit to only an immediate family member.

No, it includes spouses, but it

would include, it would include -QUESTION:

But an unwed father would not be a

21

brings the child be that child's biological father, maybe

24

even care-giving father?

25

This is the child -- the mother is incarcerated,

MR. CASEY:

Can the person who

The child can visit if the child,

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

you know, is the biological child, but the child has to be

Someone other than

the unwed mother would have to bring that child under the
rules.

MR. CASEY:

The mother is in prison?
But someone other than the unwed

13

father would have to bring --

He is not qualified --

he's the guardian?

18

21

The unwed father would not qualify?

If he is the legal guardian, yes.
If he's the legal guardian, he would?
Yes.

If the mother, the custodial

parent, has gone through legal guardianship.
QUESTION:

That's enough family relationship

23

despite the lack of the wedding bond, he would probably be

the guardian, I would guess, wouldn't he?

And, again, this

This is a facial challenge not as an

as-applied?

Would an as-applied challenge be possible,

8

assuming we recognize some right of visitation?
MR. CASEY:

9

These rules could be challenged as

10

an -- on an as-applied basis but we did go through a

11

complete trial on the merits here.

There is evidence.

Our position is we submitted evidence to

MR. LAMKEN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court.

receive in-person visits other than those permitted by

10

Corrections Department rules is consistent neither with

11

inmate status nor with the legitimate penological

12

interests underlying Michigan's rules.

13

The right asserted here for inmates to

QUESTION:

But, Mr. Lamken, you are then

14

agreeing with Mr. Casey that there is no right of -- no

15

right to any visitation, contact, noncontact, that what

16

right -- what privilege is extended is a matter of

17

administrative grace?

18

MR. LAMKEN:

19
20

That is our initial position, yes.

And we also have two backup positions.
QUESTION:

On your initial position, in your

21

view, under a scheme like this could complete discretion

22

be given to the warden to determine who gets the

23

visitation and who does not?

24

didn't really -- you've been looking sloppy for a couple

25

of days so I'm going to take away your visiting

He said, you know, you

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

privileges?
MR. LAMKEN:

Not necessarily.

The fact that the

3

Federal Constitution itself does not create a liberty or a

4

property interest in visitation, does not preclude the

5

possibility that State prison regulations or State law

6

might create that type of interest.

7

away under --

8
9

QUESTION:

It could not be taken

I know it isn't an issue here.

But

one of the reasons I'm asking is because if the warden

10

doesn't have complete discretion, then that indicates that

11

maybe there's some right that's either conferred by the

12

statute or by the Constitution.

13

complete discretion?

14

MR. LAMKEN:

You say the warden has

The answer is not necessarily.

And

15

that is the Court would have to examine under the

16

standards established by -- in Sandin v. Conner, whether

17

or not State law provides a property or a liberty interest

18

that can't be taken away without sufficient process.

19

And that --

20

QUESTION:

21
22

As you read these regulations, does

the warden have the complete discretion?
MR. LAMKEN:

Well, it's not a question of what

23

the content of the regulations are.

That was -- Sandin v.

24

Conner got rid of that inquiry.

25

whether it is a grievous deprivation or an adverse -- or

excuse me, an atypical hardship that is contrary to the

typical norms of incarceration.
QUESTION:

3

And under that standard, do you think

4

the warden should have complete discretion to deny anybody

5

for any reason visiting privileges?
MR. LAMKEN:

6

We think that's a very difficult

7

question.

If push came to shove, our answer would be the

8

warden should have that discretion but I should point out

9

that Bureau of Prison regulations and the State of

10

Michigan both provide extensive hearing procedures before

11

such rights are withdrawn.

12

for example, in Michigan, you can challenge the underlying

13

finding of misconduct if your rights are going to be taken

away for the minimum 2-year period ban that's at issue

21

Then how would you distinguish the

22

holding in Turner against Safley pertaining to the right

to marry?

24
25

MR. LAMKEN:

On two bases, Justice Stevens.

First, marriage has or can have a religious, that is free

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

rights and the rights to certain benefits outside the

3

prison context.

4

visitation.

5

Neither is true of the right to -- of

Second, incarceration as a form of punishment

6

necessarily places a barrier between the prisoner and

7

those with whom he would otherwise associate.

8

essence of the punishment is that separation and the

9

vesting of control over exceptions to that separation, in

11

The very

the State and corrections authority.
Marital status in contrast, such as free

12

exercise of religion, doesn't have the necessary

13

relationship to incarceration as a form of punishment.

14

QUESTION:

But if you say there's --

15

QUESTION:

Do all prisons allow some form of

16

visitation for prisoners?

17

accepted practice?

18

MR. LAMKEN:

Isn't that a pretty universally

It is a universally accepted

19

practice, that for certain prisoners under proper

20

conditions, certain visits, will aid in rehabilitation and

21

that is the accepted view and one that the Bureau of

22

Prisons firmly supports.

23

QUESTION:

Right.

If you're going to release

24

somebody back into society, you don't want to cut off all

25

contact with family members or friends who might help that

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

person on release, do you?
MR. LAMKEN:

2

Well, that, Justice O'Connor, is a

3

matter of penological philosophy, but not a matter of

4

constitutional right.

5

penological philosophy, the Bureau of Prisons, for

6

example, does allow visits.

7

visits rather severely if the -- if the circumstances

8

provide.

10

But it will restrict those

And we believe that one -QUESTION:

9

And as a matter of sound

Well, why isn't the Turner/Safley

rule quite adequate here to deal with this?
MR. LAMKEN:

11

Well, Your Honor, you could decide

12

it -- actually Turner v. Safley, as we read it has two

13

components.

14

inmate retains those rights that are not inconsistent with

15

incarceration or with the penological interests of the

16

corrections system.

17

could resolve it under either of the inconsistent-with-

18

inmate status problem, which is to say that there is no

19

right.

20

and determine that, in fact, Michigan's rules do have the

21

requisite relationship to legitimate penological

22

objectives.

23

On page 95 in particular, it says that an

Or it could go into the Turner v. Safley balancing

But as to the first, if you're right

24

on the first point, which is what is disturbing about the

first point, a prisoner would have no right whatsoever to

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

any kind of visit or communication or association with

2

outside people, even if there were virtually no

3

penological reason for doing that?

4

you have to go that far?
MR. LAMKEN:

And that's -- why do

Justice Breyer, I think part --when

6

you say communication, I wouldn't go that far.

saying that -QUESTION:

9

You say that because that's what's

that the cases seem to say.
MR. LAMKEN:

10

We are

Communication, association.

Well, in fact, what incarceration

11

cuts off and what the punishment of incarceration is is

12

the physical separation of the inmate from the rest of

13

society.

14

for example, for a corrections official to have authority

15

to give an inmate a furlough to go outside to work for

16

example.

17

must give me a furlough to go outside because your failure

18

to do so interferes with my in-person associational

rights.

The inmate, for example, it's not inconsistent,

But it is inconsistent, for an inmate to say you

The very essence -QUESTION:

You're thinking of cases where that's

21

justified what the prison is doing.

22

your first point, you better think of cases where the

23

prison is unjustified, but it still wins.

24
25

MR. LAMKEN:

And if you win on

Well, I think the answer is, the

very essence of the punishment of incarceration is

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

separation from society and the vesting of exceptions

2

thereto in corrections officials.

3

and that is the difference between, for example, a broader

4

right to communicate, which wouldn't necessarily be cut

5

off.

6

That is the punishment

A broader right -QUESTION:

You would say that even if -- even if

7

the prison -- even if the prison administration is

8

unjustified in refusing to allow the prisoner a furlough

9

out into society, even if a thoroughly trustworthy

10

prisoner, you'd still say he has no right to that?

11
12

MR. LAMKEN:

Absolutely.

That is the nature of

incarceration as punishment, Justice Scalia.

13

Turning to the Turner balance argument --

14

QUESTION:

15
16

So you say there can be solitary

confinement for life, if that's what the State wants?
MR. LAMKEN:

Justice Kennedy, solitary

17

confinement should be distinguished from merely cutting

18

off visitors from outside.

19

question is, yes, under certain circumstances, solitary

20

confinement for life would be permissible, but one would,

21

as the Court has pointed out in various cases, have to --

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

And the answer to your

Well, then under all circumstances

under your view?
MR. LAMKEN:

Well, the barrier for solitary

confinement for life would be whether or not that's cruel

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

and unusual punishment.

that prisoners don't get to choose who their cellmates

are.

don't get to choose who they dine with.

to choose the institution in which they're incarcerated.

protected outside.

MR. LAMKEN:

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

MR. LAMKEN:

Yes, you can.

The facilities at issue in

these cases are portable booths, which separate the inmate

from its visitor but not the visitor from all the inmates

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEBORAH LaBELLE

20

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

21

MS. LABELLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and if it

22

please the Court.

The Court -- I would like to clarify

23

quickly the administrative proceedings before we got to

24

trial in this Court, because the Court asked an inquiry.

25

We did have a 3-day trial and a preliminary injunction

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

hearing and at that time the Corrections Department

2

represented that the rules were only as to contact visits

3

and the Court, recognizing that there were some smuggling

4

and contraband issues, thereafter denied a preliminary

5

injunction and followed with the summary judgment, summary

6

disposition based solely on the understanding that it was

7

limiting -- these rules only limited contact visits.

8

that's how it went to the Sixth Circuit.
QUESTION:

9

And

So there's nothing in the district --

10

in the district court's opinion or order that clarifies

11

that?
MS. LABELLE:

12

No.

The district court ruled only

13

with regard to thinking it was contact and the Sixth

14

Circuit accepted it that way, when it became clear, when

15

it was sent down, that the visits were being applied to

16

ban all visits for certain categories of people, we asked

17

for a rehearing in the Sixth Circuit, they used a

18

clarifying opinion and then said that, no, the

19

justification is given for limiting contact visits,

20

smuggling and contraband did not suffice for limiting all

21

visits for these categories of visitors.
QUESTION:

22
23

Did the case go to the Sixth Circuit

twice?

24

MS. LABELLE:

Yes, Your Honor.

25

It went to the Sixth Circuit after a whole --

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

first on the initial preliminary injunction, then it went

2

back down, it was tried on the issue of noncontact visits

3

and the permanent ban.

4

Justice, was not tried in the first go-around, because

5

they indicated that they had not yet implemented it in any

6

form, so it was not yet right.

7

QUESTION:

8

The permanent ban, Mr. Chief

Is that particular procedural history

significant in what we decide on the issues before us?
MS. LABELLE:

9

I think that it is not

10

significant, only to clarify one point, the issue of

11

whether the siblings are before this Court.

12

the district court's decision that the Department chose to

13

pass -- that a rule was passed voluntarily allowing the

14

Department to allow siblings in, which they have, but they

15

have put a position throughout the case and up through the

16

Sixth Circuit that they had the right, at any time, to

17

withdraw that voluntary choice to allow siblings.

18

think the siblings issue is still very much before this

19

Court.

20

QUESTION:

It was after

But their position is they have the

21

right to say no to all children?

22

MS. LABELLE:

That's correct, Your Honor,

23

including siblings, children, that it is all a matter of

24

discretion.

25

QUESTION:

So their position is not different

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

with respect to a child, a grandchild, a sibling.

They

2

say whatever we want to do, it's up to us to do in our

3

judgment and you have no right at all, whatever you get is

4

a privilege.

5

MS. LABELLE:

That's correct, Your Honor.

6

And I think that that is why the case has gotten

7

so far.

8

and prisoners do not retain the rights of intimate

association past the prison door.

10

It is because that the insistence that families

the intimate associational rights at issue, if that is the

25

purpose that we are going to target the intimate

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

associational rights, then a fundamental right has arisen

2

and then it's a Turner question.

3

QUESTION:

You're not targeting the rights.

4

Their object is not to cut off those rights.

5

is to reduce the number of children in the room, to reduce

6

the number of visitors, just as in the other case, their

7

object is to use prison facilities that are more -- that

8

are cheaper, that are -- that are more readily available,

9

so they send the inmates somewhere else.

10

Their object

But if you have a constitutional right to the --

11

to the visitations you're talking about, it doesn't seem

12

right to me that you should be able to be removed from the

13

people who could possibly visit you.

14

MS. LABELLE:

I think that, Your Honor, what's

15

going on here is that the decision to slice deeply into

16

the family and to make that decision as to who gets to

17

visit and who doesn't goes directly to, and that's exactly

18

what they did, they said, here are minors and we're going

19

to select out certain intimate associations, we're going

20

to slice --

We're going to have to pass on one by

MS. LABELLE:

I think you don't have to for two

reasons, Your Honor.

3

that the intimate associational rights that are at issue

4

here do pass through the doors for the families, that you

will have Departments of Corrections exercising their

6

discretion and their expertise under Turner, which they're

7

allowed to do, something that is clearly not evident here.
They didn't -- there is no expertise in their

16

MS. LABELLE:

of intimate association, and family association.

we have said here is that the Department can make its

It strikes me as the most

What's wrong with that?

MS. LABELLE:

And I think, Justice Breyer,

9

what's wrong with that is that it's not the business of

10

the Department of Corrections to start making decisions

11

once you decide that family members and children can come

in, that to make decisions as to which family members are

MS. LABELLE:

2

What about the rest of it?

I think that the question is

whether it's reasonable to slice off certain family

MS. LABELLE:

The reasonable

thing is we want as few children as possible.

And the unwed parent would not be

prison for 6 months, we're not going to allow you to come

QUESTION:

Okay.

If you're going to accept that

kind of categorization as legitimate, what's your basis

for saying that in the case of child visitation, it's got

to be content-neutral?

I think because --

I think that because there was

absolutely no basis, the only concerns -- I think because

22

it was a different -- a deference to the different

23

concerns articulated, the concern with regard to minors

24

was simply volume.

25

particular group of minors raised any specific concern.

There was no articulation that any

we will take their rationale at their word, and if we take

it, this is the only limitation that they could put on?

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

3

MR. CASEY:

I would just like to clear up a

4

couple of points initially.

5

from lawyers or clergy.

6

Persons can be or prisoners can be in minimum custody

7

level and still have these visitor restrictions.

8

Justice Kennedy referred to solitary confinement, Justice

9

Breyer, excuse me, we're not talking about that.

10
11

This case is not about visits

It's not about custody level.

So when

We're

just talking about visitation.
And Justice Ginsburg, I stand by my earlier

12

statements about the nature of the arguments in the

13

initial district court proceeding as it proceeded in the

14

first court of appeals.

15

between noncontact and contact visits simply didn't come

16

up in that -- -- in the -- in those district court

17

proceedings.

18

QUESTION:

The issue of a distinction

And do I understand your position

19

that you don't get to any Turner against Safley question,

20

because there's simply no right to beginning with, no

21

right that can be shown?

22

MR. CASEY:

That's our initial position, yes.

23

The limitation to contact -- or to noncontact

24

visits is not a panacea.

Children still present problems

25

of the -- they have unique risks and burdens.

When a

54

1

guard and a visitationer is watching a child, they're

2

distracted from watching some other visitation.

3

Michigan prison system, most facilities with multicustody

4

levels have one large room for visitation.

5

tables and chairs for the contact, along one wall, there

6

will be vending machines and along another wall, there

7

will be one or two of these temporary booths.

8

noncontact prisoners are brought through the contact room

9

to that booth.

The

They have

And

Visitors for the noncontact prisoner are

10

brought through the contact room.

11

opportunity for exchange of contraband and visibility of

12

other activity that's going on in this one room.

13

There's ample

With respect to the argument about content-

14

neutral regulations regarding children, prison officials

15

are entitled to make categorical decisions.

16

here is that it's better to permit the quality close

17

visits based on a parent-child relationship, partly

18

because of limitations on time as Justice Scalia alluded

19

to, there were overcrowding problems before the

20

regulations were put into effect.

21

testified after the regulations were put into effect, the

22

conditions were noticeably better.

23

The decision

All of the wardens

In closing, I would just like to emphasize, that

24

the -- the judgment of the corrections officials here was

25

a valid exercise of their informed discretion regarding

55

1

the conditions of confinements.

2

deferred to that, this Court has recognized deferral to,

3

deference to prison officials as an important factor.
And in summary the court of appeals should be

4
5

reversed.
QUESTION:

6
7

The courts should have

If you have a minute, I have one

factual question?

8

MR. CASEY:

9

QUESTION:

I would be happy to.
From the brief from the respondents,

10

I just want this clarified, there are a certain number of

11

prisoners who have families and they have children, but

12

they aren't legally married.

13

the impression that visits are allowed by those children,

14

even though they're not legally married, unless parental

15

rights have been terminated.

16

argument, I had the impression that you could not have a

17

visit from such a child, period, unless you went through

18

some formal adoption procedure.

19

MR. CASEY:

Now from the briefs, I had

But from respondents'

Which is it?

The -- a child of a prisoner is

20

entitled to visit if they're brought by a member of the

21

immediate family or a legal guardian.
QUESTION:

22
23

Whether they're married or not

married?

24

MR. CASEY:

25

QUESTION:

That's correct.
Thank you.
