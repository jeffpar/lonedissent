5

versus The United States.

Mr. Fahringer.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HERALD P. FAHRINGER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. FAHRINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We urge that the appropriate rule for the

12

resolution of ineffective assistance claims of counsel

13

guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States

14

Constitution is best handled in a collateral proceeding in

15

the first instance, without first resorting to direct

16

appeal and, if that claim might qualify for direct appeal,

17

it should not be a procedural bar.

18

QUESTION:

19

our decision?

20

think best, or --

21

What is the source of -- of law for

Is it our supervisory powers, whatever we

MR. FAHRINGER:

Well, certainly, Your Honor,

22

that is implicated, your supervisory powers.

I also think

23

that under the Fifth Amendment, which has often been

24

construed to contain the equivalent of equal protection of

25

the law, that this is a circumstance, with the division in

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the circuit, that calls out for uniformity.
QUESTION:

2

Well, you -- you're saying that if

3

there's a circuit different, there's a denial of equal

4

protection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment?
MR. FAHRINGER:

5

In this circumstance, Your

6

Honor, and I'm not urging the Fourteenth Amendment.

7

I'm urging is, you have in the past had this circumstance

8

with, for instance, the Wade hearings, where it was deemed

9

necessary that you unify the system in the country so that

10

there is the equal protection, particularly in an area as

11

important as criminal prosecution.

12

all agree that the -- the most important right a defendant

13

possesses in a criminal proceeding is the right to

14

effective assistance of counsel -QUESTION:

15

What

Certainly, we would

Well, you know, that's why we grant

16

certiorari in cases, because we don't think one -- one

17

rule should be -- obtained in New York and another rule in

18

New Orleans, but I don't think we ever thought it was the

19

Equal Protection Clause that -MR. FAHRINGER:

20

Well, Your Honor, if -- if I've

21

overstated, that I apologize, but certainly under your

22

supervisory powers, I think that this case calls for

23

unity.

24
25

QUESTION:

We could unify it the way that you

don't want.

1

MR. FAHRINGER:

Well, I -- I appreciate that,

2

Your Honor.

I -- I would urge that it is -- it lends some

3

force to our argument up here that certainly a majority of

4

the circuits and the highest courts of 36 States have

5

embraced the collateral review, and -- and the reason -QUESTION:

6

Well, let -- would -- would it

7

ever -- would the basis for an inadequate assistance of

8

counsel claim ever be apparent on the trial court record

9

without resort to extrinsic evidence?
MR. FAHRINGER:

10
11

I don't think so, Your Honor.

I

think that --

12

QUESTION:

Never?

13

MR. FAHRINGER:

-- it -- there may be one, one

14

rare case, but -- as Judge Easterbrook in the Seventh

15

Circuit said so eloquently, and that is that in the --

16

because of the unique nature of the ineffective assistance

17

of counsel, because of the relationship between the

18

attorneys, and the -- and so much is a matter of omission

19

and the confidential relationship that he stated in every

20

case there is something that you could do to add to the

21

record that might reinforce the claim.

22

Circuit, most respectfully, Your Honor, has said that only

23

in a very few cases would it be completely clear on the

24

record.

25

The Second

The other reason that I think this rule is

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

superior to the procedural default rule is that it would

2

bring certitude to this area, where people would know with

3

some degree of confidence that it should be brought in a

4

collateral proceeding.

5

in that it brings together in the 2255 proceeding all of

6

the ineffectiveness claims, so they can be resolved in an

7

adversary hearing, which is certainly the best method of

8

raising these claims, particularly when you need a full

9

record.

10

QUESTION:

It has the element of efficiency,

Is your position that it's 2255 only,

11

or that it is the new counsel's option whether he thinks

12

it's appropriate to raise the ineffective assistance claim

13

on direct appeal, or whether he thinks it's best to wait

14

until the 2255 stage?

15

MR. FAHRINGER:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

Or are you saying he can't bring it

17

earlier, even if he thinks that --

18

MR. FAHRINGER:

No, Your Honor, I think it

19

should be an option.

I don't think we can ever stop a

20

defendant from raising it on direct appeal if he makes

21

that choice.

22

respectfully, that he -- it -- it will be resolved,

23

whether he could have expanded the record or not, but

24

my -- my suggestion to the Court is, and I think logic

25

supports me in this respect, that with the 2255 collateral

He -- he assumes the risk, then, most

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

available to him proceeding, that certainly the

2

overwhelming majority of cases would be brought in that

3

forum.
QUESTION:

4

But there's something to be said for

5

winding the thing up and getting it over with, isn't

6

there?
MR. FAHRINGER:

7

But those fears, Your Honor,

8

that were expressed in Frady, for example, have not been

9

pretty much put to rest by AEDPA, because now you have a

10

statute of limitation, so that these are not going to go

11

on and on.

As a matter of fact, if you --

QUESTION:

12

If you -- if you have a choice

13

between two proceedings and one proceeding, certainly

14

there's something to be said for one proceeding, although

15

your argument is that one proceeding simply isn't as

16

effective as two, but I think you have to recognize that

17

all things being equal, it would be better having one

18

proceeding than two.
MR. FAHRINGER:

19

And -- and that one proceeding,

20

Your Honor, I -- I understand with the exception of an

21

individual choice that one proceeding really should be the

22

2255.

23

think of the dilemma a defense lawyer faces in the Second

24

Circuit where one, if he sees evidence of ineffectiveness

25

but it's not fully developed, and he doesn't raise it

What I might say, as an example to this Court,

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

because he doesn't think he's obliged to, there's a risk

2

of procedural default.
If he does raise it and it's not been fully

3
4

developed, it may be resolved by the court on a partial

5

record, whereas if he'd been in a 2255 proceeding, he

6

could have expanded and amplified the record, which would

7

have strengthened the claim.
The third option is, that the Second Circuit

8
9

seems to direct is, raise it at the earliest possible

10

moment, identify it, and then perhaps we will send it back

11

for remand.

12

matter.

Well, that, that seems to just complicate the

And then finally, Your Honor, I think one of the

13
14

most compelling arguments, which the Solicitor General

15

agrees with, that this would put an end to needless

16

expenditure of judicial resources on resolving the -- the

17

cause and prejudice rule.

18

Second Circuit, every single man, woman that goes into a

19

2255 proceeding because they have this direct appeal rule

20

as an exception must establish cause and prejudice at the

21

threshold.
QUESTION:

22

Remember, in a circuit like the

Well, not -- not everyone.

I -- I

23

mean, only one who -- who got new counsel on the direct

24

appeal.

25

MR. FAHRINGER:

That's right, Your Honor.

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

I'm

1

sorry.

I'm speaking in the terms of that.

Obviously, if

2

you had the same lawyer, that would -- Your Honor, that

3

would really be cause, so it may be that he would be able

4

to easily overcome the cause aspect, but he still has the

5

prejudice aspect that he has to establish.
In the other circuits, he can go right in on a

6
7

2255, and -- and 2255 itself says that unless it's

8

conclusively established that his -- his papers are

9

without merit, a hearing shall be granted, so there's a

10

terrible disparity in the way defendants are treated who

11

are trying to -- to restore this most important right.
QUESTION:

12

Suppose you have a case where -- and

13

you stated earlier that this doesn't happen very often,

14

but suppose it's evident on the face of the record that

15

the counsel was ineffective.

16

record, Your Honor, I wish the record to show I've been

17

asleep for an hour during the key cross examination.

He stands up and says on the

Isn't it there also an efficiency in just

18
19

sending it back for new trial right away, rather than

20

going through all of the other claimed errors?
MR. FAHRINGER:

21
22
23

Well, Your Honor, I think yes.

I -QUESTION:

I mean, if it's evident that the case

24

has to go back, why have the district court -- or, pardon

25

me, the appellate courts examine the entire record and --

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

and give a lengthy opinion that's obviously going to be

2

unnecessary?

3

MR. FAHRINGER:

And Your Honor, I hope I'm

4

answering your question, because I want to be direct.

5

avoid that by the 2255 collateral review rule.

6

the Second Circuit is involved in a large number of cases

7

where they come up and they just say, well, this really

8

should go back, and -- and that -- that prolongs the

9

appellate process.

10

QUESTION:

You

Right now,

Well, I'm a little confused on the

11

same point.

12

say that a defendant is forbidden to raise an ineffective

13

assistance claim on direct appeal?

14

MR. FAHRINGER:

No.

15

QUESTION:

You're just saying that if he

16

I thought that, suppose -- does -- would you

No.

doesn't, you can -- he can raise it later in 2255.

17

MR. FAHRINGER:

18

QUESTION:

19

That's right.

And the appellate court can't say to

him, oh, you should have raised it earlier, so you're out?

20

MR. FAHRINGER:

21

QUESTION:

Precisely, Your Honor.

The --

All right, and so all we're doing is

22

defining the -- the scope of the procedural bar rule when

23

a person goes into 2255.

24

says on his appeal.

25

MR. FAHRINGER:

We're not controlling what he

That's correct, Your Honor,

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

and --

2

QUESTION:

We're not.

3

MR. FAHRINGER:

-- it seems to me that if -- but

4

please understand, I think I have to say in all fairness,

5

if he takes and goes up on the direct appeal with his

6

ineffectiveness claim and the appellate court resolves it,

7

then he may be barred.

8
9

QUESTION:

Yes, so -- so in other words, if he

chooses to go and appeal, direct appeal --

10

MR. FAHRINGER:

11

QUESTION:

12

Yes.

-- he's not going to be able to make

exactly the same claim later in 2255.

13

MR. FAHRINGER:

14

QUESTION:

Precisely.

But if he doesn't make it on direct

15

appeal, you want him to be able to make it on 2255 and not

16

be met with the argument, oh, you should have brought it

17

on direct appeal.

18
19

MR. FAHRINGER:

Your Honor, in response to that,

there really is --

20

QUESTION:

Yes, all right.

21

MR. FAHRINGER:

I --

-- unanimity among all of the

22

circuits that the best forum -- the best -- the Second

23

Circuit agrees with this, too.

24

resolving ineffectiveness claims is in the collateral

25

proceeding, when you have access to discovery.

The best forum for

QUESTION:

May I ask you about this -- this

possibility?

which there are two bases for challenging the competence

of counsel.

the second ground is not plain on the record.

MR. FAHRINGER:

that's triggered another grave concern here.

of the spirit, at least, of the Strickland rule that they

2

that, you know, it's -- the -- the powerful arguments of

3

efficiency, simplicity, and fairness to all parties seems

4

to -- to argue for the -- the collateral review rule.

5

The only argument they lean against this is this

6

notion of -- of finality, but -- but I submit to the Court

7

most respectfully that that's an -- that's in a -- an

8

almost nonexistent, narrow margin of cases, because

9

there's always more you're going to develop on the record.

10

The lawyer's explanation, for instance, you know, you

11

never have that --

12

QUESTION:

Well, you know, you could go -- you

13

could have an entire separate proceeding, Mr. Fahringer,

14

and just have exhaustive discovery and so on, but there --

15

there comes a time when there is an interest in finality,

16

that you don't want the thing just postponed to another

17

day, which this does.

18

MR. FAHRINGER:

But Your Honor -- and -- and I

19

welcome that question, Mr. Chief Justice, and that is

20

this, that if, as the Second Circuit itself says, it is

21

only in a very few cases where it would be fully developed

22

on the record, that seems to me to be a small price to pay

23

for a much simpler, more straightforward rule that

24

everybody knows where they stand.

25

struggling with this decision in the Second Circuit,

Lawyers are not

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

should I raise it, should I not raise it, am I at risk,

2

and now what you've done is, under the Second Circuit's

3

rule, you have spawned a whole generation of -- of second

4

ineffectiveness claims, because if the lawyer doesn't

5

raise it and the defendant understandably says, well, you

6

should have raised it because they say it was fully

7

developed on the record and you thought it wasn't, now you

8

have another whole level that is added to this, so the

9

complexity is staggering that is developed.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Fahringer, is -- does AEDPA

11

require that all such claims have to be brought within 1

12

year in any event?

13

MR. FAHRINGER:

It does to this respect, Your

14

Honor, yes, because as a practical matter now, under AEDPA

15

as it had amended 2255, if you bring an ineffectiveness

16

claim in a 2255 proceeding, and they are resolved, and you

17

want to try to bring another one, you have to get

18

permission of the circuit court, of course, so you've got

19

some control over it, and -- and then all claims have to

20

be brought within a year in any event, so the fears that

21

were expressed in Frady have been put to rest, I believe,

22

and there's really no good reason.

23

reason the Solicitor General endorsed this rule for over

24

20 years, and they've changed their mind now, but

25

certainly we've cited case after case where they argued to

I -- I think the

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

this Court that -- that this is the best way to do it, to

2

bring it in a collateral proceeding, because that is the

3

fairest, the simplest.

4

QUESTION:

Am I right in thinking that most

5

cases, even in the Second Circuit, do go into the 2255

6

mold, because in most cases it will not be clear on the

7

record, and the Second Circuit rule that you must bring it

8

on direct review applies only when it is clear, the

9

ineffectiveness is clear on the record, if you need to

10

look outside the record, then the Second Circuit agrees it

11

doesn't belong on direct review?

12

MR. FAHRINGER:

Your Honor, in all due respect,

13

I'm not sure that's right.

14

cases that we were able to find in addition to this one

15

were defaulted, because the Second Circuit said it should

16

have been brought, there was enough on the record.

17

this is a terribly ambiguous and controversial -- and we

18

don't know how many cases where district courts just

19

simply issued an order.

20

of them, Your Honor, unpublished, but it --

21

QUESTION:

Since Billy-Eko came down, 35

So

These are written opinions, many

But there -- but are there not cases

22

where the Second Circuit has recognized this particular

23

claim depends on extra-record material?

24
25

MR. FAHRINGER:
Absolutely.

Absolutely, Your Honor.

As a matter of fact, what I think lends force

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

to our argument here is that even the Second Circuit

2

acknowledged it, and yet they persist in holding to that

3

narrow exception that it should be raised on direct

4

appeal, and that narrow exception means that in every 2255

5

proceeding, a defendant must overcome what is a fairly --

6

a large hurdle of -- of cause and prejudice, and that's

7

not true in the other -- in the other circuits, so we

8

believe, on balance, the better rule, and the one that

9

will more effectively administer justice, should be this

10

one.
With that being said, I'd like to close by just

11
12

simply urging the Court that since one of the most

13

cherished policies of this Nation is that, and of the

14

criminal justice system is that a person is entitled to

15

the effective assistance of counsel, but if that right is

16

rendered meaningless because if he's denied that

17

safeguard, he has no effective remedy to cure it, then it

18

seems to me the right has been sadly lost, and I would ask

19

this Court to adopt the rule that we urge.

20

Thank you so much.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRIKANTH SRINIVASAN

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Srinivasan, suppose you start by

4

telling us why the SG changed the position that it had --

5

that he had taken for so long on this point?

6

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Justice O'Connor, the -- the

7

Solicitor General's Office today, as before, believes that

8

in the majority of the cases, in the overwhelming majority

9

of the cases, claims asserting ineffective assistance of

10

counsel will be better resolved on collateral review.

11

question has been whether the costs of applying a

12

procedural default rule outweigh those benefits, and it

13

has been our experience, with the application of the rule

14

in the Second and Seventh Circuits over the past several

15

years, that the administrative costs that initially were

16

feared haven't -- haven't been borne out, and that the

17

degree of uncertainty that initially led us to -- to reach

18

the position that a procedural default rule should not be

19

applied hasn't been borne out either.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

The

So in effect you think that what's

happening now in CA-2 and CA-7 is just fine?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

In the main, we think that's

23

correct, Justice O'Connor.

It should not -- the rule's

24

operation should not result in unfairness to defendants,

25

and should not overload the courts with ineffectiveness

claims that are asserted prematurely on direct appeal.
QUESTION:

3

I mean, it's the -- we're arguing about a sub-class of

4

cases in which counsel changes between the trial and the

5

direct appeal.

6

terms, how many are we talking about?

Either in percentage terms or absolute

MR. SRINIVASAN:

7

Justice Souter, the best that

8

we can tell, and this is based on essentially anecdotal

9

reports of U.S. Attorney's Offices, it's somewhere on the

10

order of 20 to 40 percent, roughly, of cases in which new

11

counsel represents the defendant on appeal, but that --

12

I'd -- I hesitate to rely too much on that figure, because

13

it is based on the anecdotal reports --

14

QUESTION:

And --

15

MR. SRINIVASAN:

-- and additionally, it varies

16

significantly by locality, depending on the particular

17

rules that are in place for replacement of counsel on

18

appeal.

19

QUESTION:

Within that 20 to 40 percent,

20

whatever it may be, do you have any kind of a rough guess

21

as to the number of instances of this issue that arise?

22

MR. SRINIVASAN:

23

QUESTION:

This issue?

I mean, how -- how many times within

24

that 20 to 40 percent category do we get into an argument

25

later on as to whether 2255 can be availed of because, in

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

fact, a -- a record was sufficiently developed to -- to

2

raise the -- the claim on direct?

3

are there?

4

MR. SRINIVASAN:

How -- how many cases

We don't -- we don't have the

5

figures on that.

6

by substantive claims, and so it's been difficult to come

7

up with numbers that reflect the treatment of

8

ineffectiveness claims in particular.

9

We don't -- we don't track the figures

QUESTION:

So it's -- it's hard to say what the

10

sort of cost to the system, if there is one, would be of

11

going one way or the other?

12
13
14

MR. SRINIVASAN:

It's -- it's hard to say

because there's no hard scientific data, and I -QUESTION:

Well, how could there be?

I mean,

15

what the problem is, is in a very small number of cases,

16

hardly any, you have a case in the district court where

17

the judge is serving as a habeas judge, and the Government

18

in a very small number of cases comes in and makes the

19

argument, judge, he cannot raise this ineffective

20

assistance claim because he should have raised it on

21

direct appeal, although he didn't, and then the cost to

22

the system is hidden in the mind of the judge, in the

23

minds of the lawyers who have to spend time briefing that

24

and going and finding some affidavits, and trying to get

25

around it.

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

I mean, how could you get empirical information,

2

and what led you to change your opinion?

3

investigating the minds of the judge or the minds of the

4

lawyers in some way, that you know that they aren't

5

actually aggravated, that you know that they aren't

6

actually disturbed at having to waste their time on such

7

an issue?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

8
9

Have you been

No, we haven't been conducting

an examination of that, of that sort, of course.
QUESTION:

10

Oh, I'm sure you haven't.

I'm being

11

a little facetious, but it seems to me it's not empirical

12

data.

The world won't come to an end if you lose this

13

case.

All it will do is save judges and lawyers a certain

14

amount of time, which, if you win this case, they will

15

have spent for no reason.

16

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That -- Justice Breyer, it's

17

correct that it saves time at the stage of collateral

18

review, but the question for procedural default purposes

19

is the effect of the rule at the time of direct appeal,

20

and -QUESTION:

21

You could save no time on direct

22

appeal, it's nothing.

23

cases where the person didn't raise the argument on direct

24

appeal.

25

I mean, what we're talking about is

MR. SRINIVASAN:

But the consequences of having

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

a procedural default rule is that it encourages the

2

raising of ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal in any

3

essential issues.

4

QUESTION:

Yes, yes.

Everybody will have to go

5

and make the same argument twice.

6

go and make the argument on direct appeal, a lot of them,

7

and then they will have to remake the argument on

8

collateral review, this time trying to explain why it's

9

somehow different.

10

MR. SRINIVASAN:

First they'll have to

Justice Breyer, there are

11

situations in which ineffectiveness claims can be raised

12

and resolved on direct appeal, and --

13

QUESTION:

There are.

14

QUESTION:

Are there -- a fairly small number, I

15
16
17
18
19
20

would assume?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

It is a narrow category of

cases, Justice O'Connor, but those cases do exist.
QUESTION:

In any event, the AEDPA time limits

apply, do they not, even if we followed a different rule?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

As a -- that's correct, Justice

21

O'Connor, the 1-year statute of limitations applies, but

22

that's also true of other substantive claims, and yet the

23

Court has continued to apply the cause in prejudice

24

standard to encourage the raising of those claims at the

25

earliest available opportunity, and that's the -- that's

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the principal policy interest behind applying the

2

procedural default rule in this context.

3

QUESTION:

Is this just a Federal question,

4

Mr. Srinivasan, or are -- does it carry over to cases

5

going through State courts, too?

6

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, the question

7

before the Court is -- is purely a Federal question.

The

8

States have adopted varying approaches, as we've suggested

9

in our briefs.

A significant number of States require the

10

raising of ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal, and

11

judge the raising of an ineffectiveness claim on

12

collateral review by a cause in prejudice standard.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Isn't it true that the majority of

States go the other way?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

The majority -- it appears that

16

the majority of States go the other way, but it's not

17

entirely clear, Justice Stevens, because some of the

18

States haven't spoken directly on the question.

19

we -- what we know is that 19 States -- it was 20 at the

20

time we filed our brief, but it's now 19, follow the cause

21

in prejudice approach and require the raising of

22

ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal, and there's at

23

least a significant number of States that don't require

24

the raising of ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal,

25

but it's unclear whether there's more than 20, and so we

What

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

don't know exactly whether it's a majority or not, but --

2

but there at least are a significant number that apply

3

procedural default principles to the raising of claims on

4

direct appeal, and that's --

5

QUESTION:

Am I right that the Government's

6

position before the -- before we granted cert in this case

7

was, this lack of uniformity is all right, that either

8

rule will do, and that lawyers, defense lawyers in the

9

Second Circuit will file the Second Circuit's rule, and

10

defense lawyers in the Fifth Circuit will file the Fifth

11

Circuit rule, and that was okay?

12

Government's original position -- you were never saying,

13

it must be direct review if it's clear on the record?

14

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Wasn't that the

Justice Ginsburg, our position

15

was that there was no need for national uniformity in the

16

sense that the Court need not grant review to impose a

17

national -- national uniform rule.

18

thought that there was no unfairness in the existing

19

divergence of approaches among the courts of appeals,

20

because in each court of appeals, a defendant had notice

21

of the particular approach that applied in that circuit,

22

and so a defendant knew ahead of time whether he had to

23

raise its ineffectiveness claim on direct appeal, or

24

whether he could wait without penalty and raise it on

25

collateral review.

We didn't -- we

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

So effectively, you told us not to

2

bother with this case, but once we granted cert, then the

3

Government had to take a position?

4

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Correct, Justice Ginsburg.

Now

5

that the Court has granted certiorari, we think it would

6

be appropriate for this Court to adopt a Nationwide rule

7

similar to what the Court essentially did in Bousley,

8

where the question was the proper time for raising an

9

objection to a guilty plea on grounds that the plea was

10

not voluntary, or -- or intelligent, and the Court reached

11

a resolution that required the raising of those claims on

12

direct appeal and adopted, it -- it appears, a Nationwide

13

solution, and we think a similar approach would be

14

appropriate in this case, that the Court should decide

15

whether on a national scale ineffectiveness claims can

16

always be brought on collateral review without any

17

concerns about procedural default, or, as we think is

18

appropriate, that ineffectiveness claims should be

19

required to be raised on direct appeal in those situations

20

in which counsel is new and the record -- the record for

21

the claim is fully developed in the trial record.

22

QUESTION:

One can imagine, if the requirement

23

that the counsel be new in order to force you to raise it

24

on direct appeal, that in itself could be the subject of

25

controversy.

That is, if you take a Public Defender

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Office, and one Public Defender, one member of that office

2

conducts the trial, and then another member of that office

3

conducts the appeal, is that new counsel?

4

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Justice Ginsburg, there --

5

there are decisions that address that issue in the State

6

courts, and I believe at least a couple that address that

7

issue in the Federal courts, and generally, the approach

8

has been that defenders from the same Public -- attorneys

9

from the same Public Defender's Office are considered the

10

same attorney for purposes of conflict, determining

11

whether there's a conflict in one alleging that the other

12

rendered ineffective assistance.

13

And that, I think, comes from the ABA

14

professional rules, and I -- and I believe it's Model Rule

15

1.1, which suggests that competence is imputed to

16

attorneys that operate within the same firm, and that

17

confirms that, at least for private firm purposes, two

18

attorneys from the same firm would be considered to be the

19

same attorney for procedural default -- default purposes,

20

and we think the same approach would follow with respect

21

to Public Defender's Offices, so I don't think that the

22

question of the same attorney is going to give rise to a

23

great deal of litigation or uncertainty.

24

that area ought to be pretty clear.

25

QUESTION:

The rules in

Well, there's one aspect of the

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Government's decision, now that it has to take a position

2

one way or another.

3

counsel, deal with what went on in the trial court, and

4

ordinarily, the first view of such questions is taken by a

5

court of first instance, not an appellate court, and yet

6

here, the first look under the rule you are now supporting

7

would be taken by an appellate court.

8
9

These questions, ineffectiveness of

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Justice Ginsburg, that's

correct, but I think it's important to point out that that

10

question, that situation is going to arise regardless of

11

how this Court resolves the procedural default question,

12

because in all the courts of appeals a defendant can raise

13

an ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal.

14

QUESTION:

What -- what is the procedure in

15

the -- in the Federal system for a collateral --

16

collateral action, they have a claim that's ineffective.

17

Does that go back to the judge who was the trial judge?

18

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Typically, yes, that's the way

19

2255 works, Mr. Chief Justice.

20

QUESTION:

May I ask, under the Second Circuit

21

rule, if the defendant is represented by the Public

22

Defender's Office in the trial court, and then on appeal,

23

the Public Defender's Office continues to represent him

24

but by a different lawyer, they have different -- does

25

that -- is that a different lawyer within the meaning of

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

the Second Circuit rule, or is it the same lawyer?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

No, I think as I was -- as I

3

was attempting to suggest in response to Justice

4

Ginsburg's question, I think that would be considered the

5

same attorney, and that follows from conflicts principles.

6

QUESTION:

I see.

7

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That attorneys within the same

8

office are considered to be the same attorney for purposes

9

of conflicts, and that informs the proper approach in --

10

in the procedural default inquiry, but I think it's

11

important to note that all the courts of appeals are

12

confronted with ineffective assistance claims that are

13

raised on direct appeal.

14

the assertion of an ineffectiveness claim on direct

15

appeal, so in every court, the court of appeals is faced

16

with one of three options at the time an ineffectiveness

17

claim is raised.

18

No court of appeals prohibits

They can deny the claim on the merits if they

19

can conclude that in no circumstances the claim could

20

succeed, they could grant relief on ineffectiveness

21

grounds in the narrow category of cases in which

22

entitlement to relief will be apparent from the trial

23

record, or they could decline to resolve the claim and

24

remit its resolution to 2255, and that's precisely the

25

same three options that confront the Second Circuit and

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the Seventh Circuit, who apply the procedural default

2

rule.
So Justice Ginsburg, in response to your

3
4

question, the courts of appeals are faced with the same

5

array of options whether this Court adopts a procedural

6

default principle or not, and in the Ninth Circuit, for

7

example, in 2001, the Court faced roughly on the order of

8

50 direct appeals in which ineffective assistance of

9

counsel was asserted as a basis for relief, and in 10 of

10

those cases, the Court was able to decide conclusively

11

that the claim was lacking in merit and therefore couldn't

12

be brought again under 2255, and -QUESTION:

13

Then the court of appeals can always

14

say, we think it would be better to have this aired in

15

the -- in the court of first instance, so there will be no

16

prejudice to our rejecting it now, you can bring it in

17

2255, but the one that -- the concern here is the

18

defendant and his new counsel, whether the new counsel can

19

safely say, if I have any doubt, I'm going to hold it back

20

to the 2255, and one point that was made was that on

21

direct appeal, it's important for the appellate counsel to

22

have the cooperation of the trial lawyer to help him go

23

through the record and point out possible grounds for

24

appeal.

25

But if the new counsel is going to insert

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

ineffective assistance of counsel at that stage, it will

2

make the relationship between trial and appellate counsel

3

rather tense, will it not?

4

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That -- that possibility

5

certainly is there, Justice Ginsburg, but I think the same

6

possibility arises at the time of collateral review, when

7

the attorney -- when you'd expect the attorney equally to

8

desire the cooperation of trial counsel, but any effort to

9

assert ineffectiveness could create the same sort of

10
11

tension in the relationship.
QUESTION:

Mr. Srinivasan, do you have any idea

12

of what percentage of cases, of criminal convictions

13

result in inadequate assistance of counsel claims?

14

90 percent of them, 50 percent of them, what?

15

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Is it

Do we know?

I -- I don't have statistics of

16

that variety, Justice O'Connor.

17

generally recognized by several courts that ineffective

18

assistance claims are often raised on collateral review,

19

and I think it's fair to say that in a significant portion

20

of -- of 2255 petitions, an ineffective assistance of

21

counsel claim will be at least one ground for relief.

22

I think it's been

And one effect of applying a procedural default

23

principle would be to encourage the raising and resolution

24

of those claims on direct appeal in those situations in

25

which it's appropriate, and I think it's important to

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

point out that there are at least some cases in which a

2

court of appeals can resolve, on the basis of the trial

3

record, that the -- that trial counsel either was or was

4

not ineffective, and this Court, for example, in its -- in

5

its Kimmelman decision, the -- pointed out that trial

6

counsel's ineffectiveness, at least in terms of the

7

performance prong of the Strickland inquiry, was apparent

8

from the trial record, and there will be situations like

9

that that arise every so often, and perhaps more

10

frequently an appellate court will be able to determine

11

that trial counsel's performance was not ineffective and

12

will be able to make that determination perhaps because,

13

no matter how deficient the performance was, the -- the

14

particular matter at issue could never have resulted in

15

prejudice for the defendant.

16

For example, if the claim of ineffectiveness is

17

that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to

18

competently impeach a particular witness, an appellate

19

court could perhaps look at the trial record and determine

20

that the testimony of that particular witness was not

21

central to the prosecution's case, and in those

22

circumstances, could a more effective impeachment have

23

given rise to a reasonable probability that the result at

24

trial would have been different.

25

So there are going to be some situations in

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

which a court of appeals can resolve an ineffectiveness

2

claim at the time of direct appeal, and in those

3

situations, it seems appropriate to encourage the raising

4

of the claim at that stage in order to promote respect for

5

the finality of criminal judgments and also to promote the

6

resolution of legal claims at the earliest feasible

7

opportunity.

8
9

QUESTION:

Under your rule, as I understand it,

new appellate counsel has the obligation to search through

10

the record to show, to find ineffective assistance of

11

counsel, and the trial counsel doesn't have that

12

obligation.

13

arbitrary and, secondly, I'm wondering if that might not

14

itself have an effect on how often petitioner gets new

15

appellate counsel as opposed to having his trial counsel.

16

Do you think there might be some effect of this rule on

17

the decision to retain new counsel at the appellate stage?

That, number one, seems to me a little bit

18

MR. SRINIVASAN:

19

QUESTION:

We're not aware that --

Or maybe even some gamesmanship

20

playing, where that trial counsel is counsel of record,

21

but he really gets new appellate counsel to help him out?

22

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, we're not aware of any --

23

of any effect of that sort in either the Second or Seventh

24

Circuits which apply the procedural default rule, and --

25

and I think if trial counsel's involved in the

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

gamesmanship, one would have to conceive of a situation in

2

which trial counsel found it in his interest to ensure

3

that appellate counsel could confirm his ineffectiveness

4

at trial, and that situation perhaps is unlikely to arise.

5

And in terms of the distinction between

6

appellate counsel calling into question trial counsel's

7

ineffectiveness, and trial counsel calling into question

8

his own ineffectiveness, Justice Kennedy, this Court in

9

Kimmelman observed what I think would -- is a common sense

10

proposition, which is that trial counsel is unlikely to

11

bring into question his own competence at trial and, in

12

fact, he would -- he would create a conflict situation,

13

and therefore the system just doesn't operate on the

14

assumption that trial counsel should be required to

15

identify his own ineffectiveness and bring it to the

16

attention of the trial court.

17

QUESTION:

What about Mr. Fahringer's point that

18

if you follow your rule, you're going to get a second

19

generation of ineffective assistance claims, that is, that

20

the counsel who didn't raise or did raise something on

21

appeal was ineffective?

22

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, it's true

23

that -- that ineffective assistance of appellate counsel

24

is -- would constitute cause for failing to raise the

25

claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel at -- on

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

direct appeal, that that is also true in -- with all other

2

substantive claims, that ineffective assistance of trial

3

counsel for failing to raise any substantive claim at the

4

time of direct appeal could constitute cause excusing the

5

default, yet this Court has continued to apply procedural

6

default principles in the case of other substantive

7

claims, and so I'm not sure that that particular

8

consideration tips the balance decidedly in one direction

9

or the other.

10

And in fact, the Court has made clear in

11

decisions such as Murray versus Carrier and Smith versus

12

Murray, and -- and recently in Smith versus Robbins, that

13

it's difficult to make out a claim of ineffective

14

assistance of appellate counsel because appellate

15

counsel's decision whether to raise a particular claim is

16

the hallmark of effective advocacy, and one would have to

17

show that appellate counsel was unreasonable in failing to

18

present one claim instead of another at the time of

19

appellate briefing in order to establish that there was

20

cause for failing to raise ineffective assistance of trial

21

counsel at the time of direct appeal.

22

QUESTION:

Of course, the Government loses one

23

thing on -- on your theory in -- in certainly some of the

24

ineffective assistance records I've had here, or seen here

25

where the -- the issue arises whether, in fact, an

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

apparently foolish move on the part of trial counsel was

2

dictated by what ultimately was a very sensible tactical

3

reason which is not apparent on the face of the record.

4

In cases like that, the Government isn't going

5

to get a chance, in effect, to make that kind of rebuttal

6

if the issue is raised on -- on direct.

7

simply won't know.

8
9

MR. SRINIVASAN:

The Government

Justice Souter, the Government

won't get that chance if it's resolved on direct appeal.

10

If it's raised on direct appeal, the Government, of

11

course, shares an interest in assuring that the trial

12

court -- that the appellate court, excuse me, does not

13

resolve the claim because it would say --

14

QUESTION:

No, but you run the -- there's no

15

question the -- but the -- the trial court may not give

16

you the chance.

17

to get cut short on your opportunity to get trial counsel

18

to explain what may look like a very dumb thing on the --

19

on the record.

20

I mean, you run a risk that you're going

The risk you run is that the trial -- that

21

the -- that the appellate court on direct appeal is going

22

to say, this was crazy, no -- you know, there -- there

23

couldn't be any sensible explanation for this, and I -- I

24

don't understand -- I don't know, just as we were saying

25

before, there's no way to tell how -- how frequently a

34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

situation like this will arise, because we don't have any

2

hard statistics on any of it, but I -- I don't know why

3

you're giving that up.

4

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, in order to ameliorate

5

that possibility, Justice Souter, the Seventh Circuit, for

6

example, has adopted a standard under which it will not

7

decide a claim of ineffectiveness in the defendant's favor

8

unless there's no possible strategic rationale for

9

counsel's decision and, of course, to the extent that

10

there may be a strategic rationale for the counsel's

11

decision, it'll be in the Government's interest to bring

12

that to the court's attention in its appellate briefing,

13

and we haven't seen too many situations in which a court

14

grants a claim of ineffectiveness on direct appeal, but

15

yet there was potentially a strategic rationale for

16

counsel's decision.

17

In fact, the court should grant relief on

18

ineffectiveness grounds on direct appeal only in

19

situations such as the one that confronted the Court in

20

Kimmelman, where there was an extended dialogue between

21

trial counsel and the trial court concerning trial

22

counsel's assertively deficient decision --

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. SRINIVASAN:

25

I --- and trial counsel was able

to explain to the trial court the basis of its decision,

35
Alderson Reporting Company

1

and from trial counsel's explanation, one could determine

2

that it wasn't based on a strategic rationale, but instead

3

was based simply on a misunderstanding of the time, of the

4

timeliness of the rejection rule that was at issue.

5

QUESTION:

In a collateral proceeding,

6

Mr. Srinivasan, you're developing evidence, you have

7

the trial -- you put the trial counsel on the stand and

8

the new counsel cross examines him to see -- prove how

9

badly he did?

10

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That -- that could arise,

11

Mr. Chief Justice.

12

evidentiary way to show that trial counsel was

13

ineffective.

14

QUESTION:

That's -- that's one potential

And is there any limit on the -- can

15

you, you know, examine the trial counsel for his mental

16

processes and that sort of thing?

17

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I'm not -- I don't know the

18

answer to that, Mr. Chief Justice.

19

extent privileges weigh into it.

20

QUESTION:

I don't know to what

But the Government frequently in

21

these cases elicits testimony in response from the trial

22

counsel saying, well, yeah, I -- I didn't ask the question

23

because I didn't want to get into this sort of subject, so

24

I mean that --

25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's correct.

2

QUESTION:

-- I take it, is a relatively common

feature in these cases.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

3

That's -- that's correct,

4

Justice Souter.

It's in the Government -- the Government

5

does do that, and it's in their interest to do that to

6

ensure that the result of trial is upheld.
QUESTION:

7

There are no privilege problems, are

8

there -- or maybe I'm wrong -- if -- if the client himself

9

has the new attorney examine the old one.

10

privilege.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

11
12
13

He waives the

I think that's right, Justice

Kennedy.
If I could turn just for one moment to the

14

application of a procedural default rule to the facts of

15

this case, in -- if the procedural default rule were to be

16

applied, the question at the time of collateral review is

17

whether -- is whether the defendant has introduced

18

extrinsic evidence not available in the trial record in

19

support of this claim of ineffectiveness, and the court of

20

appeals in this case found that there was no extrinsic

21

evidence material to the claim of ineffectiveness

22

introduced in the affidavits on which petitioner relies

23

because the affidavits suggests avenues of inquiry the

24

trial counsel could have pursued that trial counsel in

25

fact did pursue.

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

For example, on the facts of this particular

2

case, that there was no blood spatter remaining from the

3

wound, and that -- that no blood spatter reflected on the

4

upholstery of the car, or no blood itself on the front

5

passenger seat, or that the body of the -- the position of

6

the body wasn't consistent with the testimony concerning

7

the firing of the second shot, and I think it's important

8

to point out that in all of those avenues were, in fact,

9

explored by the trial record -- excuse me, by trial

10

counsel, and were presented to the jury, and the jury

11

evidently found them not persuasive.

12

QUESTION:

And yet the -- the trial judge

13

herself said to defense counsel, aren't you going to move

14

for a continuance, when this bullet came -- was unearthed

15

after all that time.

16

that it would be -- might be a good idea for defense

17

counsel to seek a continuance?

18

Didn't she, a couple of times, hint

MR. SRINIVASAN:

She did.

She offered a

19

continuance on repeated occasions to trial counsel, and

20

trial counsel turned it down, but I think the defendant's

21

burden at the time of collateral review now is to show

22

that the refusal of a continuance worked to the

23

defendant's detriment and resulted in a reasonable

24

probability that the result at trial would have been

25

different had he -- had he accepted a continuance, and the

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

affidavits only present avenues of inquiry that trial

2

counsel in fact pursued, which indicates, and I think in

3

some sense confirms, that a continuance would not have

4

affected the result at trial.
If there are no further questions, Mr. Chief

5
6

Justice --

7

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Srinivasan.

8

Mr. Fahringer, you have 14 minutes left.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HERALD P. FAHRINGER

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FAHRINGER:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think

12

I'm going to have to use them, but let me go right to this

13

matter of prejudice.
The Court should understand that the district

14
15

court, nor the court of appeals, decided the prejudice

16

issue.

17

there was a sufficient record to raise it on appeal, and

18

what I think it's important for you to understand is that

19

although in the trial record you had the justice pleading

20

with defense counsel to take a continuance, investigate

21

this bullet that became the most important piece of

22

evidence in the case -- the prosecutor stated that in the

23

Second Circuit, this was our most important piece of

24

evidence.

25

and -- and the affidavits don't simply talk about avenues

This was decided purely on procedural ground that

That became the pivotal point of the trial,

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the defense lawyer should have taken, what the affidavits

2

say is that it is highly unlikely that this bullet was

3

fired in that car, and they say that it is not consistent

4

with the chief and one and only witness that was involved

5

in the homicide, so what was missing, the indispensable

6

component for an ineffectiveness claim was the prejudice.

7

That was not on the record.

8

taking an adjournment, but all you have in the record is,

9

the bullet and the prosecution's proof.

10
11

QUESTION:

Of course, we're not trying to decide

here whether --

12

MR. FAHRINGER:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

What you had is, you're not

No.

-- or not this claim should be

sustained or rejected.
MR. FAHRINGER:

No, I -- you're -- Mr. Chief

16

Justice, I agree.

17

the Solicitor General is mistaken when he responded to

18

your question and said that there would still be

19

ineffectiveness claims against appellate counsel.

20

Court adopts the rule that a ineffectiveness claim can be

21

brought under 2255 and does not have to be first explored

22

in those few cases on direct appeal, then there certainly

23

can be no claim made against appellate counsel for not

24

raising that claim.

25

What I would like to say is, I think

If this

The other issue that's been identified here,

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

which is one of some moment, is new counsel.

2

Second Circuit has held in a case, it's unreported so I

3

won't discuss it, but you should know that there's a

4

holding that the Legal Aid Society, when it went over to

5

the Appeals Bureau, that was a different lawyer, even

6

though it was the same society, so it -- it is -- there's

7

ambiguity there, too.
What if the trial lawyer goes out and gets what

8
9

The -- the

he thinks is a good appellate lawyer to come in Of Counsel

10

with him, and the new appellate lawyer comes in and he

11

sees the colleague who brought him into the case has

12

got -- I mean, it just is generating one complexity after

13

another.

14

If you look at the Seventh Circuit rule, they

15

have put so many exceptions onto this, as has been

16

identified, that -- that it's just becoming I think

17

unmanageable and the rule is becoming unadministratable,

18

and for that reason it cries out for a new rule.

19

Thank you, Your Honor.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

23

Mr. Fahringer.

Thank you,

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
