6

Lee Bollinger.

7

Mr. Kolbo.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KIRK O. KOLBO

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11
12

MR. KOLBO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher were denied

13

admission to the University of Michigan's flagship

14

undergraduate institution, the College of Literature and

15

the Science and the Arts under an admissions-- under

16

admissions policies that facially and flagrantly

17

discriminated on the basis of race.

18

The history of their case and of the

19

University's defense of its discriminatory admissions

20

policies is a powerful argument about the perils of

21

entrusting to the discretionary judgments of educators the

22

protection of the Constitution's guarantee of equality to

23

all individuals.

24

For nearly 5 years, the University vigorously

25

defended in the district court and the court of appeals

3

1

the admissions systems that were in place when petitioners

2

Gratz and Hamacher applied. These systems featured

3

separate admissions guidelines for different races,

4

protected or reserved seats in the class for select

5

minorities, that is blacks, Hispanics and Native

6

Americans, racially-segregated wait lists, and a policy of

7

never automatically rejecting students from their

8

preferred -- from the preferred minority groups while

9

doing so for others.
QUESTION:

10

Mr. -- Mr. Kolbo, as a preliminary

11

matter, would you address the question of whether the

12

named plaintiff Patrick Hamacher has standing in this

13

case.

He was denied admission, I think, in 1997?

14

MR. KOLBO:

15

QUESTION:

Correct, Your Honor.
And he claimed that he intended to

16

apply to transfer to the University of Michigan, from

17

wherever he was going to school, and yet the transfer

18

admissions policy, I guess isn't before us.

19
20

MR. KOLBO:

The transfer admissions policy

itself is not before you -- the Court, Your Honor.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. KOLBO:

No
-- but the policy is essentially the

23

same with respect to the consideration of race and the

24

Court did -- we did certify a class in this case, with

25

respect to Mr. Hamacher, and I believe it was December of

4

1

1998.

2

court granted that certification.

3

that, of course, anything with respect -- anything that's

4

happened with respect to Mr. Hamacher subsequent to that

5

time it seems to us is not irrelevant to the consideration

6

of standing.

7
8

We moved for class certification and the district

QUESTION:

And as a result of

Are you sure that the transfer policy

is the same as the admissions policy for new freshmen?

9

MR. KOLBO:

Well, it's not exactly the --

10

QUESTION:

We didn't find any such finding.

11

There was some little material in the record that gave me

12

a different thought about it.

13
14
15
16
17

MR. KOLBO:

The transfer policy considers race,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

I know it considered race, but not in

precisely the same way as this -MR. KOLBO:

Not in precisely the same way, and

18

the Court -- there -- there is nothing -- it may be,

19

perhaps included in parts of the appendix materials, but

20

the district court did not address the issue of the

21

transfer policy in it -- in Mr. Hamacher's potential for

22

transferring under the policy.

23

QUESTION:

Well, there's nothing, I take it

--

24

if Mr. Hamacher prevails on the transfer -- there is

25

nothing in his prevailing that would hurt any other class

5

1

member.

2

MR. KOLBO:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. KOLBO:

Nothing at all, Mr. Chief Justice.
It's not a -- okay.
No.

If Mr. Hamacher prevails, then

5

the rights of many thousands of others will have been

6

vindicated and they will be able to compete under a non-

7

discriminatory system.

8
9

QUESTION:

Of course that would be true even if

he doesn't have standing.

10

(Laughter.)

11

MR. KOLBO:

That's true.

Well, Your Honor they

12

would not be able to compete under a non-discriminatory

13

system unless this particular system is struck down.

14

QUESTION:

I understand if it's struck down, but

15

that -- that begs the question of whether the named

16

plaintiff has standing to represent a class of people who

17

want to get into the freshman class.

18

as a transferring student.

19

standing, but the mere fact that if he wins everybody will

20

benefit certainly doesn't speak to the question whether he

21

has standing.

22

MR. KOLBO:

He wants to get in

I mean, it -- maybe there's

No, Your Honor, but we -- we do

23

believe that because the -- the transfer policy and the

24

original admissions policy are fundamentally the same in

25

the respect that they both consider race in the admissions

6

1

process in a way that is discriminatory and we believe

2

that's -QUESTION:

3

And therefore if you're right that

4

any consideration of a race is enough to condemn the

5

program, then he would have standing, but if it -- if it

6

requires analysis of the particular components of the

7

policy, then we ought to know whether the transfer policy

8

is the same as the original policy.
MR. KOLBO:

9

That would be true, Your Honor, if

10

the case were decided strictly on the issue of narrow

11

tailoring, but my understanding is that the University

12

considers race for a purpose to achieve a diversity that

13

we believe is not compelling, and if that is struck down

14

as a rationale, then the law would be same with respect to

15

the transfer policy as with respect to the original

16

admissions policy, Your Honor.

17

QUESTION:

Oh, he has standing to challenge.

18

That's -- that seems clear, but the -- depending on the

19

rationale that the court adopts if it finds -- if it finds

20

the program unacceptable, he may not be entitled to

21

relief.

22

MR. KOLBO:

He would be -- it seems to me,

23

perhaps, Your Honor, entitled for relief for damages.

24

He's -- he's not at this point seeking to be admitted to

25

the University.

He's graduated with the passage of time,

7

1

it's been five-plus years since this suit was filed,

2

Mr. Hamacher has attended and graduated elsewhere.

3

seems to me he would be entitled to damages.
QUESTION:

4

It

And the Court agreed with him as far

5

as the program that was in place when he applied.

6

Court, I thought, held that program unconstitutional.

7

MR. KOLBO:

8

QUESTION:

9

The

It did, Your Honor.
And -- but upheld the program that

came into being after his application, and he hasn't

10

reapplied under the new -- but he -- but there was a class

11

certified, so I suppose you could substitute another

12

plaintiff, someone who is applying under the current

13

system.

14

MR. KOLBO:

Well -- well, our position, Your

15

Honor, is that because the class was certified with

16

respect to Mr. Hamacher, that that's sufficient; that if

17

the -- if the system is found unconstitutional, he is an

18

adequate class representative.

19

Sure.

Certainly.

One of the critical things that is demonstrated

20

in this case is how easy it is for one system to be

21

disguised as another.

22

that for five years again, the University defended the

23

system with its facially separate admission guidelines,

24

with its reserved seats, and then in -- two years into

25

this case, in fact, was still using some of these

What has happened in this case is

8

1

particular forms in its admissions policy.

2

indication, I think, of how difficult it is to conclude

3

that what we have here is a system that, for example,

4

comports with what Justice Powell indicated he was -- he

5

approved of in the -- in the Bakke case.

6

It is an

What we have here is a system that was -- is not

7

narrowly tailored to achieve any governmental interest,

8

any compelling governmental interest.

9

I would like, if I may, to return to the issue

10

of diversity and the diversity issue as a -- as a

11

compelling state interest.

12

the diversity rationale is that it depends upon the

13

standardless discretion of educators.

14

The fundamental problem with

It is a discretion that would be exercised in a
And we need to be clear

15

number of different respects.

16

about this.

17

it clear that in their judgment they ought to be entitled

18

to use race as much as necessary in their educational

19

discretion.

20

The University and its amicus have all made

If that is the rule that we end up accepting,

21

then universities are free in their discretion to choose

22

which races are discriminated against, which are favored.

23

We can have one institution that discriminates against one

24

group of individuals, and another against another.

25

have with the -- with shifting fashions and -- and

9

We can

1

preferences and time, the preferences for the races can

2

shift.

3

of this case to the Bakke case, wherein Bakke, Asian

4

Americans were included in the preference, and under the

5

University of Michigan's systems, they are excluded.

6
7
8
9
10
11

An example of that is found in comparing the facts

The -- the exercise of discretion will extend to
who's identified in a particular race.
It will be for educators to decide whether
someone of a mixed race is someone that is entitled to a
preference.
You can have anomalous situation of the

12

University's guidelines for example where someone who is

13

both half-white and half-black --

14

QUESTION:

15

Michigan decide those things?

16

self-reporting type of system on the application?

17

MR. KOLBO:

How -- how does the University of
Do they -- is it just a

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice,

18

it's a matter essentially of self-identification.

19

someone of mixed race who is white and black identifies

20

himself as white, then as far as the University is

21

concerned, they don't bring the diversity that they're

22

looking for.

23

then merely from that identification, they have fallen

24

within the diversity that the University seeks.

25

So if

If that person identifies himself as black,

QUESTION:

And -- and the reason that these --

10

1

QUESTION:

One thing I don't quite understand

2

what difference does it make to your client whether

3

they're three or four races or five or six races as long

4

as she's not one of them?

5

MR. KOLBO:

6

it -- the problem --

7

QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me, Your Honor,

She's equally being discriminated

8

against as a Caucasian, no matter how many other races are

9

preferred.

10

MR. KOLBO:

That's true, Your Honor.

I -- I

11

raised the point because it -- it indicates how

12

standardless this interest is.

13

respect to any constitutional principle like, for example,

14

an interest based on remedying discrimination.

15

entirely discretionary with the University.

16

QUESTION:

It is not defined with

It is

So is it entirely discretionary when

17

you read a set of exam books, you know, it's highly

18

subjective, which is a little better than its --

19

Often I'd make a mistake as a professor, so --

20

so the fact that there aren't written-down standards is --

21

is -- I'm -- I'm not sure of the Constitutional relevance

22

of that when what you're trying to do is something lawyers

23

don't normally do, which is to select among people

24

individually considered which one is better for this

25

particular slot.

Businesspeople do that, lawyers don't

11

1

except when they're hiring.

2

(Laughter.)

3

QUESTION:

But -- but I don't -- if you said to

4

a businessperson, this doesn't have standards, such a

5

thing, I think they might laugh and say my job and

6

experience is to select who's better for this slot, so --

7

so I'm not sure of the constitutional relevance of what

8

you say, which seems to me to me to grow out of the nature

9

of the problem.

10

MR. KOLBO:

Well, again, Justice Breyer, the

11

constitutional relevance derives from the fact that we're

12

talking about a constitutional right here, the use of

13

race, which is not the same thing as --

14

QUESTION:

Yes, yes, but I mean, as Justice

15

Stevens just said, the constitutional problem consists of

16

the injury to your client and that injury is the same

17

irrespective of the precise nature of the standards on the

18

other side.

19

here is I see your point, if you say you cannot use race

20

at all, period.

21

clear position, which I think is one of your positions.

22

But once you depart from that, now I'm -- I'm interested

23

in the detail.

24

relevance of what you're saying.

25

And -- and what I'm sort of struggling for

No matter what.

That's a -- that's a

At that point I'm not quite sure the

MR. KOLBO:

Well, Your Honor, what I'm

12

1

suggesting is the Court itself has made clear that for an

2

interest to be compelling, one of the considerations that

3

the Court must look at is whether there are standards --

4

independent, ascertainable standards apart from the

5

discretion exercised by, say, an employer to determine

6

whether the interest is one that's compelling and one that

7

the Court can oversee.

8

that standard exists, for example, when we have an

9

interest in remedying identified discrimination.

That interest, that standard --

The

10

Court has made it clear that what with can be done in that

11

case is you can measure the extent to which there has been

12

past discrimination, that's not a matter of discretion for

13

the employer to decide, and once you've measured the

14

extent of that discrimination, you can tailor your remedy

15

to that interest.
QUESTION:

16

Mr. Kolbo, because you mentioned the

17

employer and the employer's judgment, I gathered from your

18

brief that this case is not simply about public

19

universities.

20

you bring up Title VI -- under Title VI, this case is as

21

much about Harvard as it is about Michigan, isn't that

22

true?

23
24
25

Employment -- because you bring up 1981 and

MR. KOLBO:

The same standard would apply,

Justice Ginsburg, that's correct.
QUESTION:

And it -- and in the private sector,

13

1

employment in the private sector, there's 1981.

2

too.

3

public -- public universities.

4

universities, and it's the entire realm of employment if

5

you're right.

6

So there,

So this case is much larger than private --

MR. KOLBO:

It's all colleges and

Well, Your Honor, I want to be clear

7

about what it is that we're arguing for here today.

We

8

are not suggesting an absolute rule forbidding any use of

9

race under any circumstances.

What we are arguing is that

10

the interest asserted here by the University, this

11

amorphous, ill-defined, unlimited interest in diversity is

12

not a compelling interest.

13

nothing we seek to do today would undo the Court's

14

precedents that have recognized if some --

Nothing we argue today and

15

QUESTION:

As far as --

16

QUESTION:

But I think you are arguing that

17

anything except remedies for past discrimination is

18

impermissible.

19
20
21

MR. KOLBO:

Your Honor, that is not a conclusion

that we need to follow from this Court's decision.
QUESTION:

No, I -- I think that's your

22

position, is it not?

23

race is as a remedy for past discrimination?

24
25

MR. KOLBO:

That the only permissible use of

I would not go that far, Justice

Stevens, there may be other reasons.

14

I think they would

1

have to be extraordinary and rare, perhaps, rising to the

2

level of life or limb.

3

recognized past identified discrimination.
QUESTION:

4

We do know that the Court has

What about Weber, to take a specific

5

case?

Employment setting, the employer says I don't want

6

to confess to having been a past discriminator, but I'm

7

willing to engage in this voluntary affirmative action.

8

take it that that would be impermissible if we adopt your

9

view?
MR. KOLBO:

10

I

Weber, as I understand it, is a

11

Title VII case, Your Honor and it's not implicated by this

12

decision.
QUESTION:

13

But there's 1981, then -- then the

14

person who was attacking it on grounds that it's racially

15

discriminatory just says my lawsuit is under 1981, which

16

it could be as well as Title VII and then what is the

17

result?
MR. KOLBO:

18

Well, it seems to me, Your Honor,

19

that -- if the Court could resolve the issue consistent

20

with Title VII, which has remedial -QUESTION:

21

If the suit is brought under 1981,

22

the Court can decide what the plaintiff's complaint should

23

be?

24
25

MR. KOLBO:

No, no, if this Court decides this

case under section 1981, the only interest asserted here

15

1

at least is an interest in diversity that we are asking to

2

strike down.

3

interests, including a remedial one, that would be

4

justified under some other statute.

5

presented.

It may be that there are some other

QUESTION:

6

But the issue is not

But there was no -- this is a

7

voluntary affirmative action, no admission of prior

8

discrimination.

9

to stop that, your theory is that that person would

10

I gather if someone brought a 1981 suit,

prevail?
MR. KOLBO:

11

The use of race to exceed non-

12

remedial objectives, I think would have problems, Your

13

Honor.

14

QUESTION:

Congress wanted race to be considered

15

by private institutions such as Harvard and what-not, if

16

there's a problem with 1981, or any of the other Federal

17

statutes, they can simply amend it.

18

thing that the Constitution applies to is State action.

19

MR. KOLBO:

20

QUESTION:

What the -- the only

Yes, that's correct, Justice Scalia.
And all the rest is simply Congress'

21

decision to impose a similar restriction upon private

22

actors, which decision it can change if it wishes.

23

MR. KOLBO:

24

QUESTION:

25

That's my understanding, Your Honor.
Or suppose you say you used the word

extraordinary as compelling justification, and the other

16

1

side says, yes, extraordinary, we're 280 million people,

2

we have large racial diversity within the country, the

3

world is even more diverse, and we think from the point of

4

view of business, the Armed Forces, law, et cetera, that

5

this is an extraordinary need to have diversity among

6

elites throughout the country.

7

country will be much worse off. That's what we're being

8

told.

That without it, the

In fact, the country might not function well at

9
10

all.

11

right, now, how can you say, or can you say, that isn't

12

extraordinary?

13

the country?

14

people are telling us the contrary?

15

And we have to train those people.

We have to.

All

That isn't a question of life or limb for

It isn't really that necessary, when so many

MR. KOLBO:

Your Honor, because there are

16

important constitutional rights at stake.

And those

17

rights are the right to equal protection.

And a mere

18

social benefit that is having more minorities in

19

particular occupations or the schools simply doesn't rise

20

to the level of compelling interest.

21

It simply is not -- it doesn't remedy a

22

constitutional value, like --

23

QUESTION:

So if the University president or the

24

dean told you just what Justice Breyer said, you would

25

tell them there's -- and that we have underrepresentation

17

1

of minorities, you would tell them there's nothing you can

2

do about it?

3

MR. KOLBO:

I would say, Your Honor, that racial

4

preferences are not the answer.

5

again in not getting a sufficient number of -- if

6

minorities are not competing at the same level as other

7

racial groups then we should take steps to solve that

8

problem.

9

rights of innocent people, because it's a prohibition

If there are problems

But racial preferences, because they injure the

10

contained in our Constitution, simply aren't permissible

11

to remedy that problem.

12

my time, Mr. Chief Justice.

If I may reserve the remainder of

13

QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Kolbo.

14

General Olson, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

16

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

17

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

18
19
20

GENERAL OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The University of Michigan admissions program

21

has created a separate path and a separate door for

22

preferred minorities.

23

basic qualifications, their path is always clear and their

24

door is always open.

25

For those groups, if they meet

Non-preferred racial groups face rigorous

18

1

competition to get through the other door.
The University admits that race is such an

2
3

overarching factor in its admissions process that

4

eventually every qualified underrepresented minority

5

applicant will be admitted.

6

one full grade point, nearly twice the benefit of a

7

perfect SAT score, and six times better than an

8

outstanding essay, the -- that bonus is actually

unnecessary with the way the plan actually works, because

10

every qualified candidate who gets the bonus gets into the

11

University.

12

ticket.

The 20 point bonus, which is

It might just as well be an admissions

The University acknowledges that its pre-1999

13
14

admissions program used separate grids, separate

15

qualifications, separate standards and protected seats.

16

They acknowledge that this system was -- which was held

17

unconstitutional and was not challenged, yet they

18

stipulated that the only changes that they made from that

19

system affected only the mechanics, not the substance of

20

how race and ethnicity were considered in the admissions

21

process.

22

QUESTION:

First the changes were sufficient to

23

convince the district judge that it was on the other side

24

of the constitutional line?

25

GENERAL OLSON:

Notwithstanding the fact that

19

1

the -- the University -- we -- we respectfully disagree

2

with that conclusion, because the -- the University itself

3

admitted that it only changed the mechanics.

4

to produce the same -QUESTION:

5

It intended

Yes, but isn't -- isn't -- I mean,

6

mechanics is another word for tailoring.

And they're

7

saying we have tailored it differently.

Our objectives

8

are the same.

9

roughly the -- the same proportions, but the argument is

We may be reaching those objectives in

10

an argument about tailoring and we've changed the

11

tailoring.
GENERAL OLSON:

12

We submit Justice Souter, that

13

the changes which they referred to as mechanics were

14

cosmetics, that ultimately, the system was intended to,

15

and they acknowledge, to produce the same outcome as the

16

prior system.
QUESTION:

17

Yes.

The stipulation is that it did

18

not change the substance of how race and ethnicity were

19

considered.
GENERAL OLSON:

20

Correct, Justice Kennedy.

And

21

what the Court only needs to look at the operation of the

22

system.

23

minimum qualification standards at the University of

24

Michigan, you were admitted.

25

That 20 point bonus means that if you pass the

Everyone else just like in the Davis program,

20

1

had to compete -- people that were not in the preferred

2

races, who were not on the preferred class had to compete

3

with one another.

4
5

QUESTION:

It was the same 20 points given --

socioeconomic status also had 20 points?

6

GENERAL OLSON:

7

QUESTION:

8

GENERAL OLSON:

9

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

And atlethics, too, I think?
Yes, and you couldn't get both.

But if you had -- whether -- whatever your background,

10

whether you were an athlete or not, you got the 20 points

11

solely because of your race.

12

that the Constitution doesn't implicate.

13

QUESTION:

14

GENERAL OLSON:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

There were other systems,

I thought you got only one 20?
That's correct.

So if you were an athlete you

wouldn't get race?
GENERAL OLSON:

That's correct.

But if you --

18

irrespective of those other factors, if you didn't get the

19

-- the 20 point bonus for being an athlete or -- for

20

socioeconomic conditions, the only thing that was required

21

was to be a member of the preferred race.

22

program that we're hearing today, the same State, the

23

state Board of Regents, this plan violates every standard

24

that this Court has set for the examination of racial

25

preferences.

21

Like the other

1

It is a thinly disguised quota because there's

2

only one path, a segment -- Justice O'Connor put it this

3

way in Croson -- a segment of the class reserved

4

exclusively for certain minority groups.

5

a particular number.

6

on the basis of race.

7

It isn't tied to

It's a segment of the class reserved

It is -- it is based upon the stigmatizing

8

notion that if you are a certain race, you think a certain

9

way or if you're a certain race, you have certain

10

experience that's are common.

11

QUESTION:

What do you say to the argument that

12

number one, it's not stigmatizing, because the box study

13

certainly didn't show that it was, and number two, the

14

objective is not to show that there is a correlation

15

between race and one point of view.

16

show students what the correlation or no correlation is

17

between races and points of view. And it seems to me that

18

the Michigan plan is equally consistent with the latter

19

interpretation as with the former.

20

GENERAL OLSON:

The objective is to

What we're saying is that if you

21

assume that because you are white or you are red or you

22

are brown or you are black, you must have certain

23

experiences and you must have certain viewpoints.

24
25

QUESTION:

The argument is that you need to have

enough of them to demonstrate that the point of view does

22

1

not always fit just one person.

2

GENERAL OLSON:

3

QUESTION:

4

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, but Justice Stevens --

And that was a finding I think?
-- that's a self-contradictory

5

rationale that they've come up with.

6

of all you have these characteristics because you're black

7

but we must admit enough of you into the class to prove to

8

the other students that -- that black isn't the reason

9

you're --

10

QUESTION:

They've said first

No that is not -- the argument is

11

basically that, look, people who have grown up in America

12

and are black, regardless of race, no, not regardless of

13

race, regardless of socioeconomic background have

14

probably, though not certainly, shared the experience of

15

being subject to certain stereotypical reactions from

16

people throughout their lives.

17
18
19

Now, that may have led them to react one way, or
another way or not react at all.
And indeed many of the students in our class

20

will have stereotypical reactions.

21

as well as for everyone else to rid themselves of those

22

reactions.

23

who are black, because that will be helpful education.

24

Now, that's their argument, I think, in that

25

And it's good for them

And we want people in this school of all kinds

respect, not the argument that all black people are poor,

23

1

not the argument that all black people have been

2

discriminated against, not the argument that all black

3

people share a point of view.

4
5
6

As I read it, that's their argument.

And so

you're reply to that argument is what?
GENERAL OLSON:

Well, their argument, A, takes

7

several forms, at one point it's that, at one point, it's

8

the need to get more people elite -- of different

9

backgrounds, it's a -- but what this Court has said that

10

racial preferences, racial stereotyping, which it is, is

11

stigmatizing, it's divisive, it's damaging to the fabric

12

of society, it's damaging to the goal ultimately to

13

eliminate the problems that racial discrimination and

14

racial differences have created.

15

QUESTION:

General Olson -- we're part of a

16

world, and this problem is a global problem.

17

countries operating under the same equality norm have

18

confronted it.

19

the European Union, South Africa, and they have all

20

approved this kind of, they call it positive

21

discrimination.

22

recited as the ills that follow from this.

23

that from our view at all or should we consider what

24

judges in other places have said on this subject?

25

Other

Our neighbor to the north, Canada, has,

Do we -- they have rejected what you

GENERAL OLSON:

Should we shut

I submit, Justice Ginsburg that

24

1

none of those countries has our history, none of those

2

countries has the Fourteenth Amendment, none of those

3

histories has the history of the statements by this Court

4

which has examined the question over and over again that

5

the ultimate damage that is done by racial preferences is

6

such that if there ever is a situation in which such

7

factors must be used that they must be -- race neutral

8

means must be used to accomplish those objective, narrow

9

tailoring must be applied, and this -- this -- these

10
11

programs fail all of those tests.
QUESTION:

General Olson, do you know whether

12

any of those countries that Justice Ginsburg referred to

13

that have gone down the road of racial preferences, racial

14

entitlements, have ever gotten rid of racial preferences

15

or racial entitlements?

16

GENERAL OLSON:

17

QUESTION:

There --

Has it been the road to ultimately a

18

color blind society or has it been the road to a society

19

that has percentage entitlements for the various races?

20

GENERAL OLSON:

Sadly, I believe that that is

21

correct, Justice Scalia, and let me conclude by saying

22

that the Michigan Law School and the University of

23

Michigan ultimately must make a choice.

24

its elitist, as it refers to it, selection process without

25

regard to race, or it may achieve the racial diversity it

25

It may maintain

1

seeks with race neutral compromises in its admission

2

standards.

3

But the one thing that it may not do is

4

compromise its admission standards or change its admission

5

requirements for one race and not another.

6
7
8

That is forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause
of the Constitution.
QUESTION:

Is it also forbidden for the United

9

States military academy?

10

GENERAL OLSON:

It may well be Justice Stevens.

11

We're not defending the specifics of those programs, but

12

we have not examined them individually.

13

that the ultimate solution to the problem that race has

14

created -- that difference in race has created in this

15

country has got to be according to what this Court has

16

said, the most neutral race -- neutral means possible.

We -- we believe

Mr. Payton, we'll hear from you.

22

Thank you General Olson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN PAYTON
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. PAYTON:

Mr. Chief Justice and, may it

please the Court:

23

I think I want to spend just a few minutes

24

briefly setting the record straight on why it is the

25

educational judgment of the University of Michigan that

26

1

the educational benefits that come from a racially and

2

ethnically diverse student body are crucial for all of our

3

students and why those benefits do not depend in any way

4

on the assumption that, for example, all African Americans

5

think alike.
LS&A, our premiere undergraduate institution, is

6
7

an undergraduate college, most of its entering students

8

come in as 18-year-olds, about two-thirds come from

9

Michigan, and about half from Detroit or the greater

10

Detroit area.

11

very segregated State.
QUESTION:

12
13

Half of the ones who come from

Michigan come from Detroit?
MR. PAYTON:

14
15

Michigan, I think as everyone knows is a

Yes.

Half of our students come

from -- yes.
Michigan is a very segregated State. Detroit is

16
17

overwhelmingly black.

18

state are overwhelmingly white.

19

in this regard, it's not that extreme from the rest of the

20

country.

racial or ethnic lines.

While Michigan is extreme

They've certainly not gone to school together.

The result is often that these students come to

And often not even being aware of the
This gap allows

Ann Arbor is a residential campus, just about

7

every single entering student lives on campus in a dorm.

8

On campus, these 18-year olds interact with students very

9

different from themselves in all sorts of ways, not just

10

race, not just ethnicity, but in all sorts of ways.

11

Students, I think as we know, learn a tremendous amount

12

from each other.

13

Their education is much more than the classroom.

14

It's in the dorm, it's in the dining halls, it's in the

15

coffee houses.

16

nighttime.

17

It's in the daytime, it's in the

It's all the time.

Here's how critical mass works in these

18

circumstances.

19

students, to take that same example, there's a risk that

20

those students will feel that they have to represent their

21

group, their race.

22

well understood by educators. It results in these token

23

students not feeling completely comfortable expressing

24

their individuality.

25

If there are too few African-American

This comes from isolation and it's

On the other hand, if there are meaningful

28

1

numbers of African-American students, this sense of

2

isolation dissipates.
QUESTION:

3
4

number?
MR. PAYTON:

5
6

Mr. Payton, what is a meaningful

as critical mass.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. PAYTON:

9
10

It's what we've been referring to

Okay, what is critical mass?
Critical mass is when you have

enough of those students so they feel comfortable acting
as individuals.

11

QUESTION:

How do you know that?

12

MR. PAYTON:

I think you know it, because as

13

educators, the educators see it in the students that come

14

before them, they see it on the campus.
QUESTION:

15

Do they -- professors at the

16

University of Michigan spend a lot of time with the

17

students?

18

MR. PAYTON:

Yes, they do.

This is a incredibly

19

vibrant and complex campus that has diversity in every

20

conceivable way.

And I think --

21

QUESTION:

22

other than lecturing to them?

23

Do they spend a lot of time with them

MR. PAYTON:

They do.

In the record, we

24

actually have an expert report that's not contradicted in

25

any way by Professor Raudenbush and by Professor Gurin,

29

1

just on the issue of how do you know when you have enough

2

students in different contexts and circumstances so that

3

there will be these meaningful numbers.

4

QUESTION:

What do they say?

5

MR. PAYTON:

They said that given the numbers

6

that have been coming through in the last several years,

7

we are just getting to that critical mass.

8

they analyzed it was to look at the circumstances in which

9

students interact.

And the way

A entering seminar, a dorm context, a

10

student activities context, student newspaper context, to

11

see what would happen if you distribute the students

12

across these small encounter opportunities.

13

QUESTION:

Does Michigan have, as some schools I

14

know have, schools that have affirmative action program,

15

does it have a minority dormitory?

16

MR. PAYTON:

No.

The answer is no.

We have

17

dormitories like I said.

Just about every single entering

18

student stays in a dormitory.

19

dormitories where your entrance into it is governed by

20

your race.

21

dormitories because everybody has to stay there, okay?

We do not have any

But we have tremendous representation in our

22

So the answer is --

23

QUESTION:

I mean, apart from being excluded, if

24

-- it is in fact the residential pattern quite mixed and

25

there are no dormitories that are, you know, just as

30

1

sometimes there is -- there is the jocks dormitory, there

2

is really no African American dormitory?
MR. PAYTON:

3

The answer is there is no African

4

American dormitory, put it -- the full answer is more

5

complex.

6

they can choose to move off campus. They can choose to

7

stay on campus.

8

campus.

9

actually in the larger campus community and what they do

After students are there for their first year,

Many stay on campus, many move off

Ann Arbor is a college town and off campus is

10

off campus is obviously up to the students themselves, but

11

I think that's -- you know, that's the real world.

12

have the meaningful numbers of minority students, what

13

then happens is that students will see a range of ideas, a

14

range of viewpoints from and among those students and they

15

will then see things that they may not have expected,

16

similarities and differences, and those in turn will have

17

the result of undermining stereotypes, you know, and this

18

happens for the minority students, and the white students.

If you

19

This happens for all the students.

20

the benefits from this affect every single student that

21

comes through.

22

meaningful numbers, or critical mass, of minority

23

students, or the benefits don't come about.

24
25

You know,

And they're dependent on their being

That's the interest that the University is
asserting.

That's why they think that this is so crucial.

31

1

Education, understanding, produces citizens and leaders in

2

our complex society.
QUESTION:

3

But where we are is, there's an

4

assumption, you may not agree with it, but it's one

5

beginning assumption in this area, that there may not be a

6

quota, every -- all of the eloquent things you said could

7

be easily met by a quota.

8

argument, we cannot do.

That -- let's just assume for

I have to say that in -- in looking at your

9
10

program, it looks to me like this is just a -- a disguised

11

quota.

12

very hard, very proud of his athletics, he gets the same

13

number of points as a minority person who doesn't have any

14

athletics -- that to me looks like an overt quota.

15

You have a -- a minority student

who works very,

Here's how our system works and I

believe it's not a quota at all and I can believe -- I can

simply explain this.

23

other things that it values, in state, underrepresented

25

socioeconomic status, what your school is like, what the

The way it works, an application

It is in fact judged on the basis of

32

1

curriculum that you took at your school is like.

2

QUESTION:

But none of that matters.

3

MR. PAYTON:

4

QUESTION:

Your grades --

None of that matters if you're

5

minimally qualified and you're one of the minority races

6

that gets the 20 points, you're in, correct? The rest is

7

really irrelevant?

8

MR. PAYTON:

The way it works is that every

9

application comes through and it's read in its entirety,

10

it is evaluated taking all of these factors into account,

11

and then based upon the number that comes off the

12

selection index which can go up to 150, the students are

13

all competing against each other.

14

is evaluated throughout the year, because there's an

15

overenrollment problem that always has to be managed and

16

if the score is higher, you are in, and that doesn't

17

matter about anything other than what the score is.

18

addition, the counselor can on the basis of three factors

19

see that an application is reviewed by the admissions

20

review committee.

21

QUESTION:

There is a score that

In

Mr. Payton, in your brief, you say

22

the volume of applications and the presentation of

23

applicant information may get impractical for LSA to use

24

the same admissions system as the much smaller University

25

of Michigan Law School.

33

1
2

Now, you're saying that every single application
for admission to LSA is read individually?
MR. PAYTON:

3

Yes.

Sometimes twice. Because

4

every application is read when it comes in, and those that

5

a counselor flags that -- because they find that there's

6

three factors you have to have flag an application --

7

academically able to do the work, above a certain

8

selection index score and also contributes at least one of

9

various factors that we want to see in our student body,

10

including underrepresented minority status, but also very

11

high class rank and a whole range of other things.
QUESTION:

12

When you say underrepresented

13

minorities, what comparison are you making to say that

14

it's underrepresented?
MR. PAYTON:

QUESTION:

Compared to what?

6

MR. PAYTON:

Compared to -- we have very small

7

pools of African Americans, for example, that are

8

qualified to the extent that we require students to be

9

qualified to do the work at the University of Michigan and

10

what that means is that if we didn't take race into

11

account, we would not be able to get the numbers of those

12

students, the critical mass, necessary for the educational

13

benefits that we want.

14

QUESTION:

But --

15

MR. PAYTON:

16

QUESTION:

That's underrepresented.

When you say underrepresented, it

17

sounds like something almost mathematical, that you're

18

saying, we only have a certain percentage of -- and we

19

should have this percentage, well, what is this

20

percentage?

21

MR. PAYTON:

It's actually not a percentage at

22

all and it really is driven by the educational benefits

23

that we want from our diverse student body.

Kennedy's question.

22

the opinion of Justice Powell in Bakke when that was

23

called for individualized consideration?

24
25

We

Go ahead.

Are you finished?

Yes.

I wanted to go back to Justice
The point system here, does it meet

Now, the concern that it does not, is that you
under this system would seem to have the possibility that

38

1

two students -- one is a minority, African American, one

2

is not, majority, and they seem academically approximately

3

the same and now we give the black student 20 points and

4

the white student, let's say, is from the poorest family

5

around and is also a great athlete, and he just can't

6

overcome that 20 points -- the best he can do is tie.

7

And so that's the argument that this is not

8

individualized consideration.

9

know what your response is to that argument.

10

MR. PAYTON:

And I want to be sure I

I have two responses.

The first is

11

to say that it is individualized if that white student

12

actually was socioeconomically disadvantaged, that could

13

be taken into account.

14
15

QUESTION:

But remember he has that and gets 20

points for it?

16

MR. PAYTON:

17

QUESTION:

Yes.

And he also is a great athlete and

18

I've constructed this example to make it difficult for

19

you, and -- but I mean you see he can only get 20 points,

20

no matter how poor he is.

21

athlete he is as well, and the -- let's say the black

22

student who has neither ties him?

23

MR. PAYTON:

24

QUESTION:

25

And no matter how great an

Yes.

But on individualized consideration,

the black student might lose, if there were the

39

1

individualized consideration.

2

MR. PAYTON:

3

QUESTION:

4

giving him.

5

find your answer?

6

Well, he might --

And that's -- and that's what you're

Now what is the answer I'm -- I'm trying to

MR. PAYTON:

The answer is we value both of

7

those aspects of diversity.

8

represented in our student body, all right, if they tie,

9

they will being judged exactly the same as far as how the

10

We want both of those

selection index works.

11

QUESTION:

What you're saying is that race is

12

individualized consideration?

13

MR. PAYTON:

14

QUESTION:

I'm saying that each student --

Otherwise you're saying that only in

15

the hypothetical given that only the white student

16

receives individualized consideration?

17

MR. PAYTON:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. PAYTON:

No, no.

They both --

Some are more equal than others?
They both receive individualized

20

consideration.

21

They both may be sent to the admissions review committee

22

where they get a second reading.

23

They're both reviewed in their totality.

QUESTION:

In Bakke --

If in those circumstances, because we

24

have the white student who is both a good athlete and also

25

very poor, and the other student, the minority is not,

40

1

could that be sent to the -- the individual -- could that

2

be sent to the review committee and the review committee

3

would say, well, we have a special circumstance here, and

4

even though the points tie, nonetheless when we look at it

5

carefully, we see that the white student has these extra

6

pluses, despite the points, we let in the white student?
MR. PAYTON:

7

The admissions review committee --

8

about 70 percent of the applications that it reviews in

9

any given year are white student applications that are

10

sent to it.

Okay.

It can reach its judgment irrespective

11

of whatever happened in the selection index score.

12

QUESTION:

So they can ignore the points?

13

MR. PAYTON:

They can -- actually once it goes

14

to them they simply look at the application and make a

15

judgment.

16

QUESTION:

So I want a clear answer to this.

17

That review committee can look at the applications

18

individually and ignore the points?

19

MR. PAYTON:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. PAYTON:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. PAYTON:

It does.

Yes.

The answer is yes?

The answer is yes.

Okay.
And it does.

In Bakke, where

24

Justice Powell says that he could look at one example of

25

an admissions policy and he discusses briefly the Harvard

41

1

plan and then he has a long quote from it, there is the

2

footnote 50 that Ms. Mahoney mentioned.

3

50 and footnote 51 there is a citation to this study by

4

Carnegie and he introduces that by saying in the footnote

5

there are in this study examples of the actions by other

6

leading institutions, trying to get diverse student

7

bodies. That study indicates that there are plenty of

8

other models where in fact some effort to come up with a

9

system to handle these different factors was successful.
QUESTION:

10

In both footnote

Mr. Payton, it's easy to say they can

11

ignore the points.

Easy to say.

Do you know of any case

12

where a minority applicant, one of the minorities favored

13

in your program, who was minimally qualified, got the

14

20-point favor and was rejected?

15

MR. PAYTON:

16

QUESTION:

I don't know, Justice Scalia.

Well, it's important, I mean, to say

17

theoretically, it's fine, yes, theoretically, you can

18

reject it.

19

side is saying, it is automatic, if you are minimally

20

qualified, and you get those 20 points, you are in, that's

21

what they claim?

But as I understand what -- what the other

22

MR. PAYTON:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

Actually --

Now, do you assert that that is

false?
MR. PAYTON:

That is not correctly describing

42

1

what happens.

The way the policy works and the way it is

2

implemented is how I described the policy.

3

results of the policy are that most of the qualified

4

minority applications do end up getting admitted.

5

not the design.

6

here's how the decisions are made, either on the selection

7

index score, some are sent to the admissions review

8

committee.

9

review committee are in fact not minority applications,

In fact, the

That's

The design is here's how you do it,

Most of those that are sent to the admissions

10

but the design is not gee, admit all qualified minorities,

11

the design is to take these different factors into account

12

in order to achieve the student body that we think is

13

crucial here.
QUESTION:

14
15

So there are some qualified

minorities who get the 20 points and who are rejected?
MR. PAYTON:

16

I believe that is the case, all the

17

record says in this is that virtually all of the minority

18

students, as a result of the policy ended up being

19

admitted.

20

you one, I can't give you one, but there are certainly

21

some where if you work it out, you can see that won't

22

happen.

23

I think there are certainly some, I can't give

QUESTION:

But the design is to admit a higher

24

percentage of the qualified minority applicants that you

25

get, given the numbers that there are today, because if

43

1
2

you don't do that you won't get your mix?
MR. PAYTON:

The design is to make sure we get

3

to the critical mass of the meaningful numbers and given

4

the small pool size we have, the way it operates is as you

5

just described, but that's the way it operates, the design

6

is to make sure we get the critical mass of students that

7

are, in fact, necessary for the educational benefits that

8

we are asserting here.

9

QUESTION:

Has anyone at Michigan ever defined

10

critical mass as being anything more specific than

11

something beyond token numbers?

12

MR. PAYTON:

I think that the reason I

13

referenced the two expert reports by Professor Raudenbush

14

and Professor Gurin is to try to see this -- those two

15

reports try to put this in sort of an everyday example,

16

you know, students don't interact with the student body as

17

a whole, they interact in small settings and it's to see

18

if you see what our minority student population is how

19

that would distribute into these small settings.

20

the basis of how that distribution works, Professor Gurin

21

looked at it to see whether or not that looked like that

22

would be generating the interactions that she would expect

23

for these educational benefits.

24
25

QUESTION:

And on

But in the criteria used by the

admissions committee, did anyone put a percentage figure

44

1

or a specific number --

2

MR. PAYTON:

3

QUESTION:

4

No.

-- beyond the concept you've got to

get more than just token representation?

5

MR. PAYTON:

6

QUESTION:

No.

The answer is no.

And --

Mr. Payton, do you know the origin of

7

critical mass that is being spoken of here as though it

8

were something that were invented?

9

least with respect to the enrollment of women in law

I know it goes back at

10

school, the schools talked about we want to get a critical

11

mass, so women will feel welcome because when they were

12

one at a time curiosities they did have to do as you said

13

defend -- they were representatives of their sex and if

14

they failed, all women failed.

15

mass, it was no longer necessary, the woman was free to be

16

who she was.

17

But that term I certainly was familiar with that

18

term used in that setting.

19

sociology, doesn't it?

20

Once they had a critical

MR. PAYTON:

It's -- it comes from

It does, and I think you've

21

described it exactly as it has come about with respect to

22

diversity and critical mass.

23

Justice Powell's discussion of the Harvard plan, he

24

clearly acknowledges and -- because the plan acknowledges

25

that you must have meaningful numbers and it means more

In the Harvard plan, in

45

1

than token numbers and there's clearly an acknowledgement

2

that if you have too few numbers you get the dynamics of

3

isolation that you just discussed.

4

QUESTION:

In the law school context, there was

5

testimony, I think from one of the admissions officers

6

that said 5 percent is too few, 10 percent might suffice.

7

And he's talking in respect to what is a

8

critical mass.

9

like that or is that just out of -- what do I do with that

10
11

Now, do people coalesce around numbers

piece of testimony?
MR. PAYTON:

I think that in all of this, you

12

know, there's a false precision here that everybody wants,

13

which is tell me exactly what this is, and I don't think

14

it exactly works like that. You know, we have a lot of

15

experience as, you know, an educational institution about

16

what has happened on our campus and what has worked.

17

class that we've had, the entering classes that we've had

18

over the last 4 years or so, have ranged from 12 percent

19

to 17 percent, okay?

20

not saying it's a percent and I'm not saying it's that

21

fixed range, but 12 percent to 17 percent is sort of how

22

it is ranged and that has generated the representation in

23

the small groups that is what is working to achieve some

24

of these educational benefits that we're talking about.

25

But it's not quite that precise as far as how

Twelve percent to 17 percent.

46

The

I'm

1
2

4

all of this works.
QUESTION:

Mr. Payton, let me ask Justice

O'Connor's question, when does all of this come to an end?
MR. PAYTON:

I think that we all certainly

5

expect it to come to an end.

I think we're all quite

6

surprised if we looked back at Bakke, in 1978, I think all

7

of us would be quite surprised from that vantage point to

8

realize that today in Michigan students live in such

9

segregated circumstances growing up, it's really quite

10

unbelievable.

11

people thought that we were coming together in a way and

12

that hasn't occurred.

13

challenges and opportunities.

14

We could not have foreseen that.

I think

That's created some educational

The test score gap, I think is narrowing -- we
I think we're all quite optimistic

15

put that in our brief.

16

about how this is going to progress.

17

I think the pool is increasing.

18

long is it going to last.

19

confident that it's only going to last for X number of

20

finite years, I just can't answer with any precision that

21

question either.

22

QUESTION:

There is progress.

But I can't give you how

I think we're all quite

Suppose the Court were to say that

23

the 20-point system and the law school system looked just

24

too much like a quota and that quotas are impermissible?

25

As of that point, is it our burden to tell you what other

47

1

systems to use or is it your burden to come up with some

2

other system, say, more individualized assessment in order

3

to attain some of the goals you wish to attain?
MR. PAYTON:

4

I guess I'm not sure what the more

5

individualized assessment would be here.

I'm not saying

6

that obviously there are things that could be done

7

differently.

8

schools do things quite differently.

9

both trying to achieve the critical mass, that I think

10

there's no dispute at all from anyone that the critical

11

mass is essential to get the educational benefits that

12

we're talking about.

We've done things differently.

The two

But I think we're

If this goal is a compelling interest, then

13
14

critical mass is essential to its attainment, given the

15

small pool size that we're talking about.

crafted in another way?

briefs, there are a lot of schools that do it in different

18

ways.

19

fact does allow students to compete.

20

evaluated on the same criteria.

21

We do take race into account in the way that you've heard

22

described.

23

that you would be striving for.

24
25

Can it be

Obviously, from the amicus

We're doing it in a very individualized way that in
Every student is

You know, head to head.

But I'm not sure that lacks the individuality

This is, you know, an enormously important case.
When Justice Powell said in Bakke that it's not too much

48

1

to say that the Nation's future depends upon leaders

2

trained through wide exposure to the ideas and mores of

3

students as diverse as this nation of many peoples, I

4

think that statement was absolutely correct then.

5

it is, you know, it has never been truer than it is today.

6

This is of enormous importance and correct, not just to

7

the University of Michigan, but I'd say to all of higher

8

education and I think to our country as a whole to be able

9

to do things that bring us together, that bring us

I think

10

understanding, that result in tolerance and, I'd say, make

11

us the -- more -- closer to the day that we all look

12

forward to when, in fact, we are beyond some of these

13

problems that we've been discussing rather intensely here

14

today.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Payton, do you think that your

16

admissions standards overall at least provide some

17

headwind to the efforts that you're taking about?

18

MR. PAYTON:

Yes, I do.

I think they do in all

19

sorts of ways.

20

students, white students, Hispanic students, Native

21

American students who go out into our communities and

22

change their communities.

23

They are certainly producing black

QUESTION:

You may have misunderstood me.

I

24

mean the -- Ms. Mahoney said earlier that the problem of

25

law school admissions, in response to Justice O'Connor,

49

1

that it was for the elite schools, it was more a problem

2

at the elite schools, when she was talking about Boalt

3

Hall, for example, you meant -- you suggested or alluded

4

to in your argument today that, you know, you don't want

5

to choose between being an elite school and the whole

6

diversity issue.
It -- would it be easier to accomplish the

7
8

latter if the former were adjusted, that is the overall

9

admissions standard?

10

MR. PAYTON:

11

QUESTION:

I think that --

Now, I know you don't want to make

12

the choice, but will you at least acknowledge that there

13

is a tension?
MR. PAYTON:

14

I think that, you know, some of our

15

other schools, the non-selective schools, actually some

16

can end up with completely undiverse populations as well;

17

that the fact that a school does not have selectivity

18

doesn't mean that the community college, in fact, is

19

diverse.

20

So I don't think it necessarily follows at all

21

that if you lower your standards and distribute this all

22

across the country, we will get these educational

23

benefits, you know, throughout our educational system.

24
25

QUESTION:

Now -- about 10 terms ago, we had the

University of Mississippi higher ed. case in here --

50

1

MR. PAYRON:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- and the argument was made that the

3

historically -- the HBCs, the historically black colleges

4

provided a different benefit to minorities.

5

same arguments with respect to diversity apply to those

6

institutions?
MR. PAYTON:

7

Yes.

Would the

You mean do they benefit if

8

they had a racially and ethnically diverse student body?

9

I believe most every single one of them do have diverse

10

student bodies.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KIRK O. KOLBO

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KOLBO:

16

With respect to the point system,

17

that the University of Michigan has an admissions system

that ends up admitting -- admitting virtually all minority

20

students.

22

original system that was in place in 1995 and 1997.

23

the joint appendix, at page 80, it's made very clear that

24

the guidelines were set in 1995, when Jennifer Gratz

25

applied to admit all qualified minority students.

In fact, I want to talk a little bit about the
We put in the record the guidelines from the

51

At

It's

1

also undisputed in this record that the way the University

2

got to the 20 points was to statistically design it based

3

on the old model.

4

the old guidelines that were set to admit all qualified

5

minority students, statistically figured out how many

6

points they needed to give -- to give to students under

7

the new system to replicate the old system, and that's how

8

we ended up with 20 points.
So it -- it strikes me as disingenuous to

These policies have a purpose.

11

They grant a

preference for a purpose.

the old system did -- did, which is to create a two-track

qualifications, that's sufficient.

would actually look like.

With respect to the concept of critical mass,

all I have to say, if one can't ascertain from the way

it's defined, meaningful means sufficient, sufficient

53

definition, it seems to me, of an interest that's too

amorphous, too ill-defined, too indefinite, just like the
