ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. HURD

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. HURD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Before this trespass policy took effect, the

12

families in Whitcomb Court lived in the middle of an open-

13

air drug market.

14

housing ought not be required by the law to live in

15

greater danger from criminals than those who rent from

16

private landlords.

17

the decision below and its mistaken application of the

18

First Amendment.

19

Surely those who must rent from public

And yet, that is the consequence of

This defendant is a common trespasser, not

20

engaged in any expressive activity.

21

struck down the trespass policy only by indulging in an

22

extravagant expansion of the overbreadth doctrine.

23

QUESTION:

The court below

Well, was -- was the State applying

24

some State law notion of standing, because certainly

25

Virginia can have different rules for standing than the

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

Federal court might have.
MR. HURD:

There is absolutely no indication in

3

the record, Your Honor, that the State supreme court was

4

doing anything other than applying what it thought was

5

this Court's overbreadth jurisprudence.

6

QUESTION:

Well, but on -- on the matter of

7

standing, would we necessarily assume they were applying

8

some Federal standard?

9

MR. HURD:

Your Honor, you don't need to assume

10

that in this case.

They -- they discuss the question of

11

standing in their opinion, and they referred to this

12

Court and this Court's traditional rule and the

13

overbreadth rule, never suggesting for a moment that they

14

thought Virginia might have a more generous rule of

15

standing than this Court has required.

16

QUESTION:

Did they cite our cases?

17

QUESTION:

There's -- there's no --

18

MR. HURD:

They did.

19

QUESTION:

There's no citation of any Virginia

20

case in the opinion, is there?

21

MR. HURD:

There is no citation when discussing

22

the -- the standing issue, the overbreadth issue at all.

23

That's correct, Your Honor.

24
25

They -- they cite this Court's cases, and this
is found joint appendix page 159.

It says the Supreme

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Court -- and I'm quoting now from the second complete

2

paragraph -- the Supreme Court has held that in the

3

context of a First Amendment challenge, a litigant may

4

challenge government action granting government officials

5

standardless discretion even if that government action as

6

applied to the litigant is constitutionally permissible.
They then cite this Court's decision in Los

7
8

Angeles Police Department.

They then go on to cite this

9

Court's decision in Ferber and in Broadrick and in Gooding

10

v. Wilson and in Dombrowski and in Thornhill, never

11

suggesting for a moment that Virginia has a more generous

12

notion of overbreadth standing -QUESTION:

13

But if we were to hold for you on

14

that ground, the Virginia Supreme Court would be free to

15

say on remand, would it not, that it has decided to take a

16

more generous view of standing?
MR. HURD:

17

It certainly could do that, Your

18

Honor.

19

adhered very closely in its interpretation of the State

20

constitutional standards to the standards laid down by

21

this Court under the Federal Constitution.

22
23

The Virginia Supreme Court has historically

QUESTION:

But when we're not talking about

substantive law, why is that really an -- an issue for us?

24

MR. HURD:

Well, Your Honor --

25

QUESTION:

They can do what they want.

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

It's

1

their courts.
MR. HURD:

2
3

Your Honor, they -- they believe they

are required by this Court's jurisprudence to grant -QUESTION:

4

Well, but they didn't say that here.

5

I mean, they didn't say the Supreme Court requires this

6

and our standing doctrine would be narrower, but we feel

7

we must.

8
9

I mean, we -- we just don't know.
MR. HURD:

Your Honor, I believe we -- we do

know based on the portions of the record I read.

They

10

relied solely upon this Court's overbreadth standing

11

jurisprudence.

12

QUESTION:

Well, they -- they did with respect

13

to -- to substantive law -- the substantive doctrine

14

overbreadth.

15

entertain this matter if it were brought under State law,

16

but we are required to do so by the Supreme Court's

17

substantive doctrine.

18

But at no point did they say, we would not

MR. HURD:

Your Honor, I -- I think of the --

19

the recently decided case of Virginia v. Black cross

20

burning where in that case the criminal defendant raised

21

claims under both Federal and State law.

22

under the Federal.

23

QUESTION:

It decided it

It did not decide it under the State.
Mr. Hurd, that's not the issue

24

anyway, is it, whether they would have had a narrower

25

interpretation under State law?

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. HURD:

No, Your Honor --

2

QUESTION:

The issue is whether -- whether they

3

adopted a broader interpretation under State law than

4

Federal law would require.

5

MR. HURD:

That's --

6

QUESTION:

Isn't that the issue?

7

MR. HURD:

That's correct, Your Honor.

8

QUESTION:

There's no indication that they were

9
10
11

adopting a broader interpretation than Federal law
requires.
MR. HURD:

That is correct.

A -- a State may

12

well be able to adopt a broader interpretation of standing

13

than this Court requires, but it cannot adopt a narrower

14

interpretation.

15

direction that you give overbreadth standing according to

16

the Federal constitutional standards, according to this

17

Court's standards.

18

suggest at all that it was adopting a broader

19

interpretation.

20

paraphrasing, of course.

21

standing rule -- its traditional standing rules do not

22

apply in these overbreadth cases, and then it cites this

23

Court's decisions.

24
25

It cannot disregard this Court's

There's nothing in the record to

It said that this Court -- I'm

QUESTION:

But it says this Court's

And if they were correct about what

our standing rules are, they would have to follow those

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

standing rules, wouldn't they?

2

narrower --

They could not apply a

3

MR. HURD:

That's --

4

QUESTION:

-- basis for standing, could they?

5

MR. HURD:

That is absolutely correct, Your

6

Honor.

7

disregard this Court's application of the First Amendment

8

through its overbreadth doctrine.

9

The State supreme court has no discretion to

QUESTION:

Here, what happened --

If they -- if they were wrong in

10

interpreting our cases, they still could have done exactly

11

what they did.

12
13

MR. HURD:

They could have, Your Honor, but

there's no indication that they did.

14

QUESTION:

They didn't say so.

15

MR. HURD:

They didn't say so.

16

QUESTION:

So if we sent it back and then they

17

said so, then we'd have to take the case and decide

18

whether they're right or wrong on the merits.

19

MR. HURD:

That's correct, Your Honor.

20

QUESTION:

Yes.

I'm not sure why we -- why it's

21

called standing.

That's where I'm basically mixed up in

22

this case.

23

particular defendant.

24

a gun under a gun statute that forbids it.

25

to say that this law is unconstitutional because it might

The person has nothing to do with speech, the

2

wouldn't do it right.

3

speaking.

4

might apply to people who have a gun in a theater in a

5

part of a play.

6

unconstitutional as applied to him because of that problem

7

with it.

8

the law wouldn't be unconstitutional as applied to him

9

because in most of its applications, it would be

10

It might apply to people who were

It might apply to speech, just as the gun law

And he wants to say that this law is

And in the gun case, it would be apparent that

constitutional and he has nothing to do with speech.

11

And now you want to say, that's true here, too.

12

MR. HURD:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

13

QUESTION:

Well, why aren't you and he arguing

14

on the merits of a constitutional matter, whether this

15

statute is or is not unconstitutional because of the

16

possibility that it could be badly applied in a free

17

speech area that isn't this one?

18

MR. HURD:

Well --

19

QUESTION:

Why isn't that the merits?

MR. HURD:

Well, Your Honor, there are a number

20
21

Why is it

standing?

22

of problems with -- with Mr. Hicks' case, one of which is

23

exactly the one you described.

24

several aspects of that.

25

We think another aspect is that this Court's practice has

We think that there are

We think one aspect of standing.

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

been not to allow overbreadth challenges to be brought in

2

cases where it was not a -- a speech-related statute or a

3

statute governing something closely related to speech.
QUESTION:

4

Mr. Hurd, we don't normally decide

5

whether a statute is constitutional in the abstract, do

6

we?

7

been unconstitutionally convicted.

8

bashing statutes in their totality.

9

was unconstitutionally convicted.

10
11
12

I thought we normally decided whether someone has

MR. HURD:

We don't go around
We say this person

That's correct, Your Honor.

And --

and certainly -QUESTION:

And that's why it's -- it's a

13

question of third-party standing whether you can say I was

14

unconstitutionally convicted because if you applied this

15

statute to somebody else, he would be unconstitutionally

16

convicted.

17
18
19

MR. HURD:
Your Honor.

It -- that is certainly our argument,

Standing is one problem with Mr. Hicks' case.

But even if he had standing, there's a problem

20

here of not meeting the requirement that alleged

21

overbreadth be substantial.

22

court didn't address this prong of the overbreadth

23

doctrine at all.

24

there were some possible unconstitutional application of

25

this policy, that the overbreadth would not be

In fact, the State supreme

And it's clear, we believe, that even if

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

substantial.

The legitimate sweep of this policy is very

2

broad.

3

deal drugs and batter women and damage property and steal

4

and intimidate and try to make this property their turf.

It sweeps up those who come to Whitcomb Court to

QUESTION:

5

I didn't think it was limited to

6

those people.

7

coming in without permission.

8

MR. HURD:

9

I thought it was a total ban on people

Your Honor, that is -- that is not

exactly the -- what the policy says.

The --

10

QUESTION:

Well, what does the policy ban?

11

MR. HURD:

The policy is --

12

QUESTION:

It doesn't just ban drug dealers,

MR. HURD:

No, Your Honor, but in terms of -- of

13
14

does it?

15

the legitimate sweep, if we tried to contrast the

16

legitimate sweep of the policy --

17

QUESTION:

Well, I -- let's say it's legitimate

18

to keep all the drug dealers and all the armed robbers

19

out, but -- but how many other people does it keep out?

20

That's what I was curious about.

21

MR. HURD:

Well, Your Honor, we believe that the

22

risk that any legitimate speaker will be chilled is -- is

23

very small.

24

to chase away the ne'er-do-wells I have described, and if

25

we're unable to remove the criminals, it would not be safe

In fact, you know, the policy was developed

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

for people to come and engage in speech.

2

QUESTION:

3

apply to everybody?

4

wells, does it?

5

MR. HURD:

But doesn't the no trespassing sign
It doesn't just apply to ne'er-do-

Your Honor, it -- it does not apply

6

to -- just to ne'er-do-wells, and the problem is how do

7

you know until you actually catch them in the act of

8

dealing drugs?

9

QUESTION:

Well, it applies to -- it does not

10

apply to someone who is coming to see someone in the

11

housing development, as I understand it.

12

MR. HURD:

That's correct, Your Honor.

The --

13

the policy is explained by Gloria Rogers, the housing

14

manager, on page 32 of the joint appendix.

15

question and an answer at the bottom.

16

question -- if a nonresident is seen on privatized public

17

housing property and he cannot demonstrate that he is

18

either visiting a lawfully residing resident or conducting

19

legitimate business, is he an authorized -- an

20

unauthorized person?

21

QUESTION:

There's a

If a nonresident --

Which, as far as the text of the

22

ordinance is concerned, legitimate business could include

23

pamphleting.

24

MR. HURD:

It -- it certainly could, Your Honor.

25

QUESTION:

As far as the text is concerned.

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. HURD:

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

It all

2

could be included under the concept of visiting residents,

3

going door to door to visit them and hand them material.

4

QUESTION:

If -- if we agree --

5

QUESTION:

It wasn't the interpretation by one

6

of the administrators that leafleting was not ipso facto

7

legitimate businessing, or pamphleting or whatever.

8

that right?

9

MR. HURD:

Isn't

Your Honor, we would characterize

10

that not so much as an interpretation of the written

11

policy as an addendum --

12

QUESTION:

An addendum.

13

MR. HURD:

-- an addendum to it which requires

14

the demonstration of legitimate purpose, which is

15

discussed in the policy, which would require that

16

demonstration be made to the housing manager to show that

17

the leafleting is legitimate.

18

QUESTION:

That --

Suppose -- and suppose I -- the --

19

the Court were to agree with you that the speech analysis,

20

particularly the overbreadth analysis here, was wrong.

21

Does the case then go back to the Supreme Court of

22

Virginia in a posture where Mr. Hicks has the opportunity

23

to challenge the ordinance as being unconstitutional for

24

other reasons apart from the First Amendment?

25

It inhibits his right of -- of movement.

It's vague.

These are

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

streets that are the functional equivalent of a public,

2

whatever.

3

him on remand?

Does he have all of those issues preserved to

MR. HURD:

4

Your Honor, he certainly has this --

5

this due process right to wander issue preserved.

6

a question that the State supreme court did not address,

7

which is whether these streets and sidewalks are a

8

traditional public forum or a nonpublic forum.

9

certainly asserted the right to -- to be there -- the

10

And he has

right to -QUESTION:

11
12

There's

And in the context of that, to say

that the ordinance is vague for other reasons.
MR. HURD:

13

That would be a substantive due

14

process challenge there.

He also has raised below a -- a

15

vagueness challenge.

16

he raises here.

17

as well.

18

the only argument he raised below in the State supreme

19

court that would -- that would not be available to him

20

upon remand would be the one decided by this Court.

21

all the other issues he pressed below before the State

22

supreme court he could press again.

It's a little different than the one

But he would have that available to him

So that the -- the only -- Your Honor, the --

And

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Hurd --

24

QUESTION:

Mr. Hurd, could we go back just to

25

Justice Stevens' question for a minute?

And I -- I just

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

want to -- I want you to comment on the significance of

2

the -- of the -- the notice that you set out on page 5 of

3

your brief.

4

property, you are now entering private property and

5

streets, et cetera.

6

means, as -- as a no trespassing sign normally would, that

7

if you are not a -- the landowner or a licensee of the

8

landowner specifically, you're not supposed to enter.

The notice says:

no trespassing, private

That sounds to me as though it -- it

9

Then it goes on to say, unauthorized persons,

10

which I take it anybody who is not authorized to enter,

11

will be subject to arrest and prosecution.

12

to Justice Stevens' question, if -- if that notice, which

13

is posted all over the -- the area, is a statement of

14

policy, I assume it is excluding everybody --

So in answer

15

MR. HURD:

No, Your Honor, it's not.

16

QUESTION:

-- who is not a resident.

17

And -- and it then goes on to say that following

18

some review for what may or may not be authority, people

19

coming in can be arrested and prosecuted.

20
21
22

MR. HURD:

No, Your Honor.

The -- the policy is

not intended to convey the idea -QUESTION:

No, but is that what this says?

If

23

we -- if we stick simply to the notices that you've put

24

up, isn't that, in effect, the burden of the notices that

25

you've put up?

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. HURD:

No, Your Honor, I do not believe

2

that's the case.

3

unauthorized persons calls into question, well, who -- who

4

is authorized and --

5

I believe that -- that the phrase

QUESTION:

Well, but before we get to that, it

6

says, no trespassing.

7

if you are not the landowner or a licensee, you're

8

trespassing?

9

MR. HURD:

And doesn't that normally mean that

Your Honor, in the context of a

10

private apartment complex, it would not mean that.

11

private apartment complex or a public apartment complex

12

where a tenant has a leasehold interest has the right to

13

invite people to come to that premises without having to

14

have the landlord grant permission.

15
16

QUESTION:

Is it the signs that are under

challenge here, or is it the ordinance?

17

MR. HURD:

It is -- it is not the signs.

18

QUESTION:

It -- it may well be that the

19

A

ordinance is constitutional but the signs aren't.

20

MR. HURD:

It is -- it is the policy --

21

QUESTION:

That's possible.

22

MR. HURD:

It is the policy that is -- that is

23
24
25

challenged, not -- not the signs.
QUESTION:

But are you taking the position that

the policy and the signs are different in their content?

MR. HURD:

3

QUESTION:

4

We're taking the position they must

If you read them separately, are they

different?
MR. HURD:

5

A -- a person might be able to read

6

the sign in isolation and believe that they had to get

7

some permission to come in advance, but the people who

8

come to the -- to this housing complex and do so

9

legitimately typically receive invitations from the

10

residents.

So they understand.

11

what the policy is.

12

QUESTION:

The residents understand

13

this case, the fact background of it that perhaps you can

14

clarify.

15

mother and his child and the mother of his child all live

16

in this project, and one would think that he would

17

certainly have a basis to visit his family.

You keep saying legitimate visitor.

MR. HURD:

18

This man's

Your Honor, two -- two points on

19

that.

The -- the first point is had he not been barred,

20

certainly coming to visit his family would be a legitimate

purpose.

But once he is barred -- and he was -- he was

QUESTION:

And we don't know why.

MR. HURD:

Well, the -- the record suggests on

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

6

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

7

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
What makes this case distinctive as a First

11

Amendment case is the presence of a general law not

12

directed at speech at all but directed at conduct that's

13

under challenge and the absence of any expressive activity

14

whatsoever by the person seeking to raise the overbreadth

15

challenge.

16

This Court's cases have entertained overbreadth

17

challenges as a means of alleviating the chill of First

18

Amendment rights of persons who are not before the Court,

19

but the Court has never entertained overbreadth when the

20

consequence of doing so would be to invalidate a general

21

law that's primarily aimed at conduct and when the person

22

who's raising the challenge did nothing to engage in

23

speech or any expressive activity at all.

24
25

The costs of an overbreadth challenge, this
Court has recognized, are high because they prohibit the

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Government from enforcing a law against conduct that is

2

not constitutionally protected.

3

magnified when the law under challenge is not merely a law

4

that directs -QUESTION:

5

But those costs are

Mr. Dreeben, assume -- I know it's

6

not quite clear, but assume for the moment that Virginia

7

had clearly -- Virginia Supreme Court clearly said we're

8

going to allow standing as a matter of State law, but --

9

even though it wouldn't be allowed as a matter of Federal

10

law, and the case then came to us in that posture.

11

we then have authority to decide the overbreadth issue?
MR. DREEBEN:

12

Would

I'm not sure that this Court

13

would, Justice Stevens.

14

more analogous to the J.H. Munson case that was before the

15

Court in which the Court considered and Your Honor's

16

separate opinion addressed the question of whether, when

17

there was an independent State overbreadth analysis, could

18

an aggrieved State official then bring the case to this

19

Court.

20
21
22

It would then be in a posture

What is clear on the current record is that the
Virginia Supreme Court cited and relied on -QUESTION:

No.

I understand that.

But I'm just

24

that's true, but it was a matter of Virginia law.

Federal grounds that it violates the First Amendment.

2

Then my question is, could we review that holding, and if

3

-- if we reviewed it in that?
MR. DREEBEN:

4

Well, the question there would be

5

whether the State was sufficiently aggrieved so as to have

6

standing under the principles announced -QUESTION:

7

Some of our loyalty oath cases -- I

8

forget if it was Adler or Doremus.

Doremus was First

9

Amendment -- allowed us to relax our standing rules in

10

order to reach a substantive constitutional issue cited by

11

the State court.
MR. DREEBEN:

12

Well, the most relevant case is

13

probably the Asarco decision in which the Court concluded

14

that once the State court binds the State officials to a

15

particular ruling, that there may be the requisite case or

16

controversy to allow this Court to decide --

17

QUESTION:

There's -- there's also --

18

QUESTION:

The same party can have standing to

19

appeal.

20

MR. DREEBEN:

21

QUESTION:

That's right.

And --

There's also a question, isn't there,

22

Mr. Dreeben, of whether this overbreadth doctrine is

23

essentially a part of the First Amendment or a part of the

24

standing doctrine?

25

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, it has two aspects, Mr.

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Chief Justice.

2

there is a case or controversy, and there clearly has to

3

be a developed enough case or controversy to allow Article

4

III to be invoked for this Court to announce First

5

Amendment principles at all.

6

doctrine responds to those concerns.

7

One aspect of it does relate to whether

And part of the overbreadth

But another aspect of the overbreadth doctrine

8

is purely prudential, and this Court has adopted those

9

limits as a matter of -- of prudential principles to avoid

10

the premature adjudication of hypothetical and abstract

11

First Amendment questions.

12

QUESTION:

But it clearly relates to the

13

doctrine of standing, doesn't it, which doctrine says that

14

you normally do not have standing to raise the objections

15

of other people?

16

objections to your own treatment, not to the treatment of

17

others, right?

18
19
20

You only have standing to raise

MR. DREEBEN:

That's correct.

I wouldn't

dispute -QUESTION:

And overbreadth changes that.

It

21

says in this one area, you can object to the treatment of

22

other people.

23

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think overbreadth is -- is

24

an application of a more general principle that this

25

Court has adopted on -- in various circumstances to allow

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

a party who's before the Court and who is aggrieved to

2

raise the rights of others.

3

challenges, the Court allows criminal defendants to raise

4

the rights of the excluded jurors.

For example, in Batson

5

This is an example of third party standing

6

designed to implement First Amendment norms, but the

7

Court has recognized that the costs of invalidating a law,

8

when the person before the Court doesn't have

9

constitutionally protected conduct, are high, and those

10

costs are higher when what's being invalidated is not

11

merely a law aimed at speech, but a law aimed at access,

12

general conduct, as is this law.
QUESTION:

13

But the irony of what you're saying

14

is that the Virginia -- Virginia Supreme Court might

15

undertake that cost, invalidate a Virginia statute on

16

Federal grounds that we think are wrong and we couldn't do

17

anything about it.
MR. DREEBEN:

18

That is probably true unless the

19

Court applies the Asarco principle to allow an aggrieved

20

State official to bring the case here because its own

21

supreme court has interfered with the implementation of

22

Federal law -QUESTION:

23

See, but that's -- that's the

24

problem.

I mean, this is exactly -- that's why I'm mixed

25

up about the standing part versus the merits.

It seems to

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

me if it's a traditional question of standing, there --

2

there are a group of people who are trespassing who have

3

nothing to do with speech.

4

hypothetical people that might have to do with speech.

5

And the question is can these people who have nothing to

6

do with speech invalidate the statute because of the way

7

it applies to some other people?

8

Amendment area, we have normally let people do that, but

9

in other areas not.
All right.

10
11

can't.

And then there's some other

Now, in the First

So suppose the answer is not.

That's their problem.

You

Let them raise it.

Now, Virginia says, we want to let any taxpayer

12
13

raise it.

14

raise it, but then what?

15

holding would have meant it is not unconstitutional under

16

the Federal Constitution to convict this person.

17

and now, under -- under the guise of standing, they're

18

going to come back and say, oh, no, it is unconstitutional

19

because we let this person raise the rights of some

20

others.

21

If it were purely standing, any taxpayer could
I would have said that the first

And --

That's where I'm confused.
MR. DREEBEN:

I think the answer to this paradox

22

is that the State court can adopt much broader principles

23

of law with respect to standing than this Court would

24

impose, and it can administer them even when it's

25

adjudicating Federal light -- rights.

For example, a

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

State could allow a purely advisory opinion to be issued

2

by its State supreme court challenging this law by any

3

citizen.

4

QUESTION:

Well, fine, let them challenge it.

5

QUESTION:

Okay.

6

QUESTION:

But if you're right, no matter how

Does --

7

much they challenge it, the simple fact is, if you're

8

right, it doesn't violate the Federal Constitution to

9

convict this person.

10

MR. DREEBEN:

11

QUESTION:

12

That's true.

So what's raising it going to get

him?
MR. DREEBEN:

13

Well, that -- that is an

14

adjudication of the -- of the overbreadth challenge on the

15

merits.

16

sufficient real and substantial overbreadth to invalidate

17

this law, and we do think that that is a correct analysis

18

and would suffice to reject the Virginia Supreme Court's

19

holding in this case.

20

It would be a determination that there is not

QUESTION:

Okay, but you're -- I think you're

21

saying that -- that under Asarco, they can challenge the

22

substantiality point, but they wouldn't necessarily be

23

able to challenge the standing point which gets this

24

particular defendant in a position to raise the issue in

25

the first place.

Is that right?

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. DREEBEN:

It's not exactly right, Justice

2

Souter, because I think this is an area analogous to the

3

Court's rules in criminal cases under Michigan v. Long

4

where the Court has to decide, does this opinion rest on a

5

question of Federal law or does it rest on a question of

6

State law?

7

presumption that if what a State court does is cite and

8

rely on Federal precedents, we will presume that it did

9

what it did because it thought it was compelled to by the

10

And in Michigan v. Long, the Court adopted a

force of this Court's decisions.
QUESTION:

11

We certainly -- that certainly

12

applies when you're talking about substantive law whether

13

it -- it would be an extension of that to apply it to

14

standing.
MR. DREEBEN:

15

I think it would only be a modest

16

extension because in this case the court did not

17

separately analyze the questions of standing as such from

18

whether respondent could bring an overbreadth challenge,

19

and the question wasn't posed with a -QUESTION:

20
21

Why -- why isn't that a question of

standing by definition?

22

MR. DREEBEN:

23

QUESTION:

It -- what it --

Overbreadth is an exception to

24

standing, and -- and so why is it anything but a standing

25

issue?

Substantiality of overbreadth is -- is a

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

substantive issue, but -- you see my -MR. DREEBEN:

Let me -- let me explain it this

3

way, Justice Souter.

4

Amendment overbreadth doctrine requires that State courts

5

entertain overbreadth claims like this one even when it's

6

a general law and even when the party before the court has

7

been convicted of conduct that doesn't involve speech,

8

then State courts would be required to follow that rule

9

and could not adopt a different standing principle that

10
11

If this Court said the First

was narrower and that would exclude respondent.
And our reading of the Virginia Supreme Court's

12

opinion is that Virginia either thought or assumed that it

13

was required by this Court's cases to entertain an

14

overbreadth challenge.

15

agrees that it's not the State court's obligation to

16

entertain this overbreadth challenge, would be to vacate

17

the judgment, announce the correct First Amendment

18

principles, and remand the case to the Virginia Supreme

19

Court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

20

QUESTION:

The proper response, if the Court

But that would -- that would

21

basically be applying something like Michigan v. Long

22

rather than Asarco, right?

23

MR. DREEBEN:

In this case, it certainly would

24

because the State court hasn't relied on a clearly

25

insufficient case or controversy in order to adjudicate

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Federal rights.

QUESTION:

But I -- I take it that all of those

issues are open for you to argue if we were to agree with

3

the State that the Supreme Court of Virginia was simply

5

you would have all of those arguments to confront and to

6

see if you can prevail on if we remand it to the Supreme

7

Court of Virginia.

9

MR. BENJAMIN:

Your Honor, that's correct.

However, those same issues, of course, were before the

10

Virginia Supreme Court.

The -- the State, the petitioner,

11

did not even challenge standing until the State sought

12

cert at this Court.

13

The question presented concerning the closest

14

issue to standing was whether Mr. Hicks was untimely in

15

his challenge to the barment-trespass policy.

16

in all of the State courts argued that Mr. Hicks should

17

have challenged his barment in some civil proceeding, and

18

that's the question presented on page 97 of the joint

appendix and that was what the Virginia Supreme Court

20

dealt with, it having been the only issue presented to

21

them on this at page 158.

22

not the one that initiated the -- the matter?

4

not what our law says.
MR. BENJAMIN:

5

That's just

is true to say that the Virginia court necessarily decided

the standing order, it not -- the standing issue, it not

MR. BENJAMIN:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. BENJAMIN:

Yes, sir.

What do you think that was about?
Yes, Your Honor, that was on the

14

merits.

When the Virginia Supreme Court discussed the

15

merits, they discussed whether there was overbreadth and

16

whether it was substantially overbroad.
QUESTION:

17

But they didn't decide that

18

overbreadth was an issue.

19

decided if overbreadth had been an issue, this is how the

20

issue would be resolved.

21

overbreadth -- that is, the standing doctrine of

22

overbreadth -- was applicable to this case.
MR. BENJAMIN:

Your Honor, if the Virginia

Mr. Benjamin, certainly the

about overbreadth.

trespass policy as it was applied to him.

that is overbreadth.

I mean, the -- the one -- I'm just

MR. BENJAMIN:

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Thus, I

Now, that --

Yes, Your Honor.

So what is the answer then to the

10

overbreadth question?

11

presented in the petition for certiorari, which we

12

granted, asks, as I read it, the question of whether a

13

person who does not engage in expressive conduct at all

14

can ask the court and can succeed in having the court

15

strike down a statute as applied to him for the reason

16

that it might be unconstitutional as applied to other

17

people engaged in expressive conduct.

18

That is, the first question

The example would be, favoring their side, that

19

you have a gun statute.

Any person who possesses a gun is

20

-- goes to jail, and the defendant says, well, I did

21

possess a gun and I was trying to rob a bank, but maybe

22

this statute would be applied to a person in a play, in

23

which case it would be too broad.

24

that absurd example.

25

All right.

And they say it's like

Now, why isn't it close enough to

5

they do, let's consider it, when this statute is applied

to them, which it never has been in their view.

Now, what's your response?

MR. BENJAMIN:

They're also arguing that this is a
It deals with ordinary

A handful might, but if

Your Honor, my response is that

in the ordinary case, such as some of your hypotheticals

10

suggest, it would become instantly apparent that the

11

robber, although claiming that the statute or the policy

12

is overbroad -- it would become instantly apparent that he

13

had no basis whatsoever to bring this motion.

14

got to a hearing, there would be an immediate failure of

15

proof, but it wouldn't get to a hearing because there

16

would be a motion to quash the motion for lack of --

QUESTION:

If he even

You have some very important substantive issues here

MR. BENJAMIN:

Your Honor, I understand your

question, and Mr. Hicks at the inception was not outraged

18

about free speech and First Amendment issues.

19

outraged about the fact that he had been banned for

20

apparently nothing more, as the en banc Virginia court

21

found, going back to see his family repeatedly.

MR. BENJAMIN:

MR. BENJAMIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

Not the supreme court.
Not the supreme court, had found,

12

Your Honor, that the -- the charge of damaging property

13

had nothing to do with his barment, and there was nothing

14

in the record or in the evidence suggesting otherwise.
The testimony at page 60 of the joint appendix

15
16

does not permit the inference urged by the petitioner.

17

The inference at most urged -- that you could draw from

18

page 60, the testimony there is that the police quite

often saw Mr. Hicks in the development and he gave them an

address, and then Ms. Rogers would confirm that he did not

live there.

MR. BENJAMIN:

Your Honor, what Gloria Rogers is

specific question, how did Kevin Hicks come to be barred,

she begins, as she does, giving a general answer in how

to one of her own reasons of domestic violence.

No.

She's answering the question,

Please tell the court how that came about.

So, you know, to

We had sought

22

discovery of the reasons that he was banned, and counsel

23

at page 1312 and 13 had said that counsel needed to

demonstrate why Mr. Hicks was barred.

the housing authority counsel, objected that the reason

But RRHA counsel,

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

why Mr. Hicks was banned was irrelevant because being a

private property owner, the position was, they could ban

anyone at any time for any reason.

QUESTION:

Okay, Mr. Benjamin, I'm going to ask

5

you to assume that I at least do not accept the view that

6

the record shows that your client was there for an

7

expressive purpose that ought to be recognized by the --

8

by the First Amendment.

9

he was banned because he was a criminal.

I don't ask you to stipulate that
I will simply

10

assume that he is in some middle ground, that he is not

11

there for expressive purposes.

12

he's there.

13

Assume we don't know why

What's your -- your answer basically to the

14

question put to you by Justice Breyer?

15

necessary, in order to protect the First Amendment, to

allow a person in that position to -- to raise this kind

17

of -- of issue with respect, say, to leafleters or people

18

who are there for expressive purposes?

19

recognize this?

20

MR. BENJAMIN:

Why is it

Why do we need to

Because, Your Honor, as you --

21

this very exchange illustrates how unworkable that very

22

test would be because reasonable people will disagree over

23

whether any given conduct is in fact expressive.

24

very fact that Mr. Hicks --

25

QUESTION:

If the

Well, you're changing my hypo.

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

I

1

mean, I -- I said let's assume that we don't have a

2

predicate for saying this person's conduct is expressive.

3

I will grant you that there are always going to be points

4

on the margin in which we say, well, was he there for

5

speech or wasn't he.

6

the -- what is the best argument for recognizing his right

7

to raise a First Amendment claim?

8

MR. BENJAMIN:

9

Assume he wasn't.

What -- what is

Because the whole reason for the

exception is the importance of First Amendment rights and

10

values.

To impose this sort of a test would defeat the

to deal with laws that sweep this broadly and infringe

upon and violate people's -QUESTION:

14

Why -- why don't you have an adequate

basis to deal with them under the vagueness doctrine, for

16

example, that is open to you on remand, even if you lose

17

here?

18

issue?

19

Why do we have to turn this into a First Amendment

MR. BENJAMIN:

Because I think the Virginia

20

Supreme Court, when it saw the entirety of this policy,

21

including not just the First Amendment issues, but the

22

vagueness that permeates this policy -- I think that the

23

Virginia Supreme Court decided, from a conservative

24

approach, that it would deal with the most to it -- the

25

most obvious deficiency and that is the complete

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

unfettered discretion that -- that Gloria Rogers, the

2

housing manager, had, that every single police officer

3

had, and deal with it then while the policy was before it,

4

instead of going on and settling other questions, instead

5

of requiring that challenges -QUESTION:

6

But what you just said goes right to

7

vagueness, that you have an administrator who says, I'm

8

queen.

9

see why you need the First Amendment hook to challenge

10
11

I'll let you in or I won't let you in.

I don't

that point.
MR. BENJAMIN:

Mr. Hicks didn't need the First

12

Amendment.

13

the -- the vagueness that permeates this, but it -- he --

14

His issue from the very beginning began with

QUESTION:

But -- but maybe it's not your fault,

15

but that's what the Supreme Court of Virginia said, and in

16

the course of doing so, it arguably -- and there's a very

17

serious concern that it misapplied Thornhill.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Benjamin, I don't want to put

19

words in your mouth -- excuse me.

I'm sorry.

I didn't --

20

I don't want to put words in your mouth, but is this what

21

you're trying to say, that if the statute is so overbroad

22

it would be unconstitutional if the person has standing to

23

challenge it?

24

disability is -- is because it's not a First Amendment

25

issue at all or whether he's engaged in First Amendment

It doesn't matter whether he is -- his

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

conduct which is perfectly prohibitable as to him.

2

either event, it doesn't matter why he can't challenge it

3

as long as his -- as the statute itself is overbroad.

12

-- I don't know what they all say, but people who are

convicted of ordinary trespass -- and a lot of them apply

to public property, et cetera -- could then come in and

Alderson Reporting Company

then allowing people who trespass -- nothing to do with

the ground that if applied in the expression area, they

in that area.

In other words -- I would be -Yes, Your Honor.

I would be accepting that.

MR. BENJAMIN:

Yes.

And that -- that -- but

it's not much of a risk.

12

QUESTION:

Because?

13

MR. BENJAMIN:

Because those challenges would

14

fail almost immediately because it -- I know of no other

15

case where the trespass law has applied so pervasively to

16

the entire streets and sidewalks of a community.

17

QUESTION:

But trespass on public property --

18

there could be all kinds of situations, Federal buildings

19

and dozens of them, where in fact it's really applied

20

against people who are breaking in who have no business

21

there, and they just don't apply it or it never has come

22

up whether they would apply it were somebody interested in

23

a demonstration.

24
25

MR. BENJAMIN:

Yes, Your Honor, but the system

can easily deal with frivolous motions because of the

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

requirements already built into the requirement.

2

Overbreadth must not only exist and be articulable, it

3

must be substantial.

4

with sanctions if necessary.

And the system could deal with that,

5

In this case it wasn't enough for a citizen to

6

have, in fact, a legitimate purpose to use the sidewalk.

7

He had to be able to demonstrate that he had a legitimate

8

purpose.

9

to the subjective standards of any particular police

The legitimate purpose was by reference solely

what legitimate meant.

14

someone could go onto these streets and sidewalks if their

15

business was to argue and have it out with someone or to

16

go meet with abortion activists.

17

policy is that before you can use these sidewalks, you

18

must be engaged in a legitimate -- whatever that means --

19

business or social reason, which by its own terms -QUESTION:

20

There was no clear meaning as to

MR. BENJAMIN:

I'd sort of like to separate the

arguments that are going to vagueness and those that are

to overbreadth, it seems to me.

6

The ones you're making now don't go

to the heart of First Amendment.

Well, our cases have certainly

separated vagueness from overbreadth.
MR. BENJAMIN:

I think that this Court has used

the terms vagueness and overbreadth interchangeably and -QUESTION:

Well, let's -- let's assume that

we're up to the challenge.

15

(Laughter.)

16

QUESTION:

It -- it seems to me that there are

17

some very important vagueness arguments in -- in the -- in

the classical sense of that term that your client can and

should make, and they're unrelated to the speech point.

20

They're completely unrelated to it.

Court of Virginia thought about this just in the speech

That

No, but isn't it true -- but isn't

11

the problem with your argument this:

12

say that a statute that ostensibly addresses speech is

13

likely to have a serious overbreadth problem if it is very

14

vague in the way it does it, but it is a very different

15

thing to say that a statute that does not ostensibly

16

address speech, that addresses conduct, walking across a

17

line, becomes an overbreadth -- presents an overbreadth

18

problem simply because somebody who crosses that line

19

might want to talk.

cases in the first category, speech with vague

limitations, to tell us that we ought to -- that we ought

25

It is one thing to

And you're arguing on the basis of

Isn't that the -- the difficulty of your argument?
MR. BENJAMIN:

of your case.

authority cannot create, for people who live in projects,

You are essentially saying that a public

10

a gated community.

11

can have streets, everything just like this, but

12

government can't create it for poor people.

13

The people who live outside projects

MR. BENJAMIN:

Is that --

Your Honor, they -- they can't --

14

the Government can't do it by simply saying that the

15

streets are private and simply putting up signs because --

16

QUESTION:

Okay.

If you're right on that, we

17

don't have to get to the speech issue.

18

that, you have the problem that I just presented to you,

19

don't you?

20

MR. BENJAMIN:

21

QUESTION:

If you're wrong on

I don't understand.

If -- look, if -- if you're right

22

that the Government cannot, in their words, privatize the

23

streets, then that's the end of the case.

be prosecuted for trespass in this instance, and that's

the end of the issue here.

Your guy can't

If it turns out, on the other

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

hand, that the Government can indeed do what it purported

2

to do here, then it seems to me your argument suffers from

3

the problem that I raised.

4

case in which the statute doesn't address speech but

5

addresses conduct, crossing a property line, there is a

6

speech implication and every one of those trespass cases

7

becomes a First Amendment overbreadth case.

isn't that correct?

MR. BENJAMIN:

You're saying that even in a

Isn't --

I agree that the challenge can be

10

made if counsel sees fit to do so, but of course, he's

11

bound by the State's ethical requirements.

12

issue won't be there in most cases.

13

that is going to be as vague and overbroad, so pervasive

14

in its effect on First Amendment freedoms as well as --

15

QUESTION:

And the -- the

There is no policy

You're saying when it gets very,

16

very, very, very, very vague that's when it becomes a -- a

doesn't address speech.

19

MR. BENJAMIN:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. BENJAMIN:

Is that basically it?
Your Honor, yes.

How could we administer that?
It's not -- what you administer

22

is what has always been administered, the requirement of a

23

finding of substantial overbreadth.

Do we -- do we have any -- any

overbreadth cases that -- that would support that?

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. BENJAMIN:

We have cases such as Watchtower,

for example, where admittedly in Watchtower, Jehovah's

was nothing about the facts of that case or the ordinance
