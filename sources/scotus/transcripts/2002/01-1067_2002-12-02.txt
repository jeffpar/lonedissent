ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. GARRE:

9

it please the Court:

10

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may

In 1960, Congress declared the former Fort

11

Apache military post to be held in trust for the White

12

Mountain Apache Tribe.

13

QUESTION:

The specific --

What condition was it in in 1960?

14

Was it basically like it is today, or has it gotten worse?

15

What was it like then?

16

MR. GARRE:

Well, it -- it's certainly much

17

older today.

18

condition the -- the legislative history doesn't discuss

19

the condition of the fort in particular detail.

20

It's about 40 years older today.

The

It's important to recognize that the military

21

fort was built for temporary use -- today, some -- almost

22

a century ago, and in 1960 had been built for temporary

23

use, you know, more than 50, 60, or 70 years ago.

24

wouldn't at all have been surprising if there had been a

25

state of decay in 1960.

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

So it

1

And of course, when Congress passed the 1960

2

statute, there was no indication at all -- certainly not

3

on the face of the statute, or in the legislative history

4

that's contained in respondent's lodging -- that it had in

5

mind a historic preservation goal, or that it had in mind

6

that -- that it would require the Secretary of the

7

Interior to undertake the enormous financial

8

responsibility of having to restore a century-old fort.
QUESTION:

9

-- making use today of a portion of

10

the structures there for the school and administrative

11

needs?

12

MR. GARRE:

Absolutely, Justice O'Connor.

13

The -- the vast majority of the buildings and historic

14

district area of Fort Apache are used today for school and

15

administrative purposes.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

The Bureau of --

Are those maintained in some fashion

for that use by the Federal Government?
MR. GARRE:

They are.

As we point out in note 1

19

of our reply brief, the Department of the Interior has

20

spent more than $3 million over the past decade or

21

15 years on repair and maintenance projects at the fort.

22

It's also true that the tribe itself has engaged in

23

historic restoration efforts at the fort with the support

24

of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Department of the

25

Interior, and with the assistance of private, State, and

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

even -- in some cases -- Federal tax dollars.
QUESTION:

2

Well, the U.S. Government does hold

3

the property in trust for the tribe -- the White Mountain

4

Tribe.

5
6
7

Right?
MR. GARRE:

That's true.

Just like the U.S.

Government -QUESTION:

And what basic responsibility does

8

that entail, would you say, the fact that the Government

9

is a trustee?

10

MR. GARRE:

Well, when Congress places land in

11

trust for Indians, it has two well-settled meanings that

12

this Court has recognized.

13

on the alienation of property, and second, it immunizes

14

the property from State taxation.

15

pages 6 and 7 of the respondent's lodging, that indicates

16

that in 1958, when there was discussion about what to do

17

with Fort Apache, the tribe itself encouraged the

18

Department to have Congress place the land in trust so

19

that it was in a nontaxable status like the surrounding

20

reservation lands.

21

First, it places a restraint

And if you look at

Now, we know from the first Mitchell decision

22

decided by this Court that simply placing property in

23

trust does not in itself create a substantive right to

24

money damages.

25

QUESTION:

But there was an enormous difference

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

in that case in that the Indians managed the land.

2

the General Allotments Act, the idea was to make the

3

individual owner autonomous.

4

disputed that this land has been operated by the U.S.

5

Government, and the U.S. Government has exclusive control.

6

MR. GARRE:

Under

Here, I think it's not

Justice Ginsburg, that -- that may

7

be true in the factual sense, but the 1960 act -- that is,

8

that the Federal Government is using the property, but the

9

1960 act -- quite unlike the General Allotment Act --

10

specifically reserves to the Government the right to use

11

the property for Government uses.

12

think the trust relationship created by the statute in

13

this case is much more limited than the one that was

14

created by the statute in Mitchell I, and the existence of

15

factual Federal control cannot in itself give rise to a

16

damages action under the Tucker Act.

17

QUESTION:

And in that respect, we

Can you just explain one small point

18

to -- to me?

19

"administrative"?

20

with the school, or some free-floating administration?

21

I know what "school purpose" means.

What is

Is that administrative in connection

MR. GARRE:

Well, I -- I think generally, the

22

"administrative use" can refer to executive uses, and is a

23

very broad term.

24

instructive that Congress used that term.

25

I think that -- that "administrative purposes" has to be

In that respect, I think it's
Nevertheless,

Alderson Reporting Company

1

read with school purposes, and can be read to refer to

2

both uses for storage and the like, and also for

3

administrative purposes used by the Bureau of Indian

4

Affairs to undertake activities at Fort Apache or -- or on

5

the surrounding reservation.

6

administrative for the purpose of the Department of the

7

Interior, who operates activities there through the local

8

agent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

So in that respect, it's

Now --

9

QUESTION:

10

Mr. Garre, is -- is any of the -- or

11

let me ask you an open-ended question.

12

property which is the subject of this claim was within the

13

Government's control throughout this period, and how much

14

of it was not?
MR. GARRE:

15

How much of the

Oh, well, our position would be that

16

the vast majority, if not all, was -- well, that's not

17

true.

18

within the Government's control, but it's important to

19

recognize that the court of appeals' decision remands for

20

building-by-building, in a sense, trial on the existence

21

of Federal use and control.

22

access to the Fort Apache property.

23

The tribe even has a -- a cultural museum that it operates

24

on the property.

25

Federal enclave --

The -- the vast majority of the property has been

And the tribe does have
The tribe is there.

So it's -- it's not as though this is a

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Well, is the tribe making -- is the

2

tribe making a monetary claim with respect to property

3

which it has had in its control, as distinct from the

4

Government's, during this period?
MR. GARRE:

5

If you look at appendix A to the

6

tribe's complaint, which -- which has a detailed building-

7

by-building analysis of the ways in which the building

8

don't meet certain requirements, I think it's fair to say

9

the tribe's damages claim extends to all the buildings at

10

Fort Apache and that, therefore, it may extend to

11

buildings over which the Federal Government is not -- have

12

any active use or -- or control.
But we don't think that a damages action can be

13
14

brought against the United States based on some fact-

15

bound, manipulable notion of Federal control.
QUESTION:

16
17
18

No.

I -- I realize that.

I realize

that.
MR. GARRE:

Under the Tucker Act -- and this

19

Court emphasized it in the Mitchell decisions, and it's

20

emphasized it in other decisions -- a substantive right to

21

damages against the United States -- which, after all, is

22

a right to damages against the public fisc -- has to be

23

grounded in a source of substantive law.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, if -- can we talk just for a

moment about the analogy?

And we'll call it just that,

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the area of private trusts.

2

I -- I take it that usually a trustee, who has

3

the obligation to repair buildings for the beneficiaries

4

so they don't fall into disrepair, does so at the

5

beneficiaries' expense.

6

MR. GARRE:

7

QUESTION:

That -- that's true.
And that -- that didn't seem to

8

figure into your argument.

9

as -- reading the briefs -- that that was an argument --

10

Again, it -- it struck me,

you don't really make that argument.

11

MR. GARRE:

12

QUESTION:

Well -Is that because the trustee here is

13

both the beneficiary -- is -- is a co-beneficiary of the

14

trust?

15

MR. GARRE:

That is true and it's much unlike

16

the typical common law trust, but the -- the most

17

fundamental reason, Justice Kennedy, is we don't think

18

that a court should have to plumb through the common law

19

to determine whether or not Congress established a right

20

to damages against the United States in this case.

21

And it's also true -- if you look at the common

22

law, the first thing you -- you're met with -- with -- is

23

with the general rule that you can't get breach of trust

24

damages against the sovereign.

25

not only you'd have to get around the courts --

So you'd have to get --

1

QUESTION:

Well, but that -- but, I mean, that's

2

the whole purpose of the Tucker Act.

3

plead sovereign immunity begs the question.

4

exactly the question before us.

5

MR. GARRE:

I mean, to -- to
That's

Well, and I agree, Justice Scalia,

6

and we think that that question should be answered by

7

looking to the act of Congress on which the tribe relies,

8

which is the 1960 act.

9

QUESTION:

Well, but it would have seemed to me,

10

following Justice Scalia's question and my own, that if

11

the law of trusts gave a clear indication one way or the

12

other that there was a liability, then the Tucker Act

13

analysis might -- might be different accordingly.

14

MR. GARRE:

With respect, I disagree.

And I

15

think the Mitchell I case establishes that.

16

Mitchell I, both the Court of Claims and the dissenters on

17

this Court reasoned that because the General Allotment Act

18

placed land, quote, in trust, that therefore one could

19

look to the common law and therefore one could import into

20

the Tucker Act all the liabilities that would follow

21

against a private trustee, even liabilities that would

22

result in damages actions.

23

rejected that analysis.

24
25

In

A majority of this Court

Now, in Mitchell II, the Court specifically
affirmed the result in Mitchell I, and it emphasized that

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Mitchell II was different because in that case, the Court

2

had statutes and regulations that created specific

3

management duties that could be fairly interpreted as

4

mandating the payment of compensation for the breach of

5

those duties.
Now, the court of appeals recognized at page 18a

6
7

of the petition appendix -- and the -- even the tribe

8

recognizes on page 11 of its brief -- that the 1960 act

9

doesn't set forth any specific management duties on the

10

part of the Government.
QUESTION:

11

Do you think the Government could

12

have just destroyed the property or the structures on the

13

land?

14

MR. GARRE:

Well, I -- Justice Stevens, I think

15

that the notion that the Government would destroy the

16

property, if it did so in a way that was clearly

17

inconsistent with the terms of the act --

18
19
20

QUESTION:

Let me put it another way.

Do you

think they had a duty not to destroy the property?
MR. GARRE:

That -- that duty, if it exists,

21

comes from ordinary tort principles and from principles of

22

just compensation under the Fifth Amendment.

23

claims haven't been asserted in this case.

24

involves a breach of trust action, a claim for damages

25

based on the alleged breach of trust which the tribe

grounds in the 1960 act, and -QUESTION:

2

No, I understand.

But part of the

3

question we have is to what extent did the Government

4

assume duties beyond immunizing the property from State

5

taxation and preventing its alienation.

6

additional duties?

7

told me they had a duty not to destroy it or not.

9

Not under -- under the 1960 act, the

statute in this case.
QUESTION:

11

And I'm not clear on whether you've

MR. GARRE:

8

Now, if the Government had -But did they -- from any source, did

they have a duty not to destroy it?

You'd help me if you responded yes or

no, to be honest with you.

MR. GARRE:

Yes, it would under the Fifth

Amendment to the Constitution if Congress sold the fort to

someone else, or if Congress destroyed the fort.

2

Act for some kind of destruction of property.

3

hasn't brought that -QUESTION:

4

The tribe

So you are -- to this extent, you're

5

differing from counsel's position before the Federal

6

Circuit, because I believe at that level, counsel was

7

asked if the United States could dynamite all the

8

buildings to the ground with no liability to the tribe,

9

and the answer was yes.
MR. GARRE:

10
11

Well, it's -- it's not clear to me

the context in which that question came up.
But I also think that it's true that if the

12
13

Secretary decided that it was necessary to level a

14

building because it proves an attractive nuisance to

15

school children, or because it was desirable to build a

16

more -- newer and better educational facility at the fort,

17

that the 1960 act would authorize the Secretary to do

18

that.
But -- but we do recognize that there are other

19
20

principles in this area stemming from the Fifth Amendment,

21

a source of substantive law, stemming possibly from the

22

Federal Torts Claims Act, another source of substantive

23

law, which aren't invoked in this case, which might be

24

implicated based on the Government's management of the

25

property.

1

QUESTION:

Well, how about Mitchell II?

2

MR. GARRE:

Well, in Mitchell II, Justice

3

O'Connor, the statutes and regulations there, which --

4

which the Court described as a pervasive, statutory scheme

5

governing Indian timber management, provided specific

6

fiduciary management duties that could be fairly

7

interpreted as -- as mandating payment of compensation.

8

They -- they specifically govern the generation of profits

9

or proceeds for the Indian tribe, and in that case, the

10

Court held that the violation of those duties, grounded in

11

a statute or regulation, gave rise to a money damages

12

action under the Tucker Act.

13

QUESTION:

This case is --

Well, how would -- how would you

14

describe the duties the United States has as trustee with

15

relation to this property?

16

total of its duties?

17

MR. GARRE:

How would you describe the sum

I think the -- the principal duties

18

are the ones that the Court has always recognized when it

19

places land in trust:

20

it immunizes it from State taxation.

21

QUESTION:

not to alienate the land and -- and

In -- in effect, I think what you're

22

saying is that there are no trust duties.

There's a

23

peculiarity here.

24

in the argument, simply has those two implications:

25

give it away and place it in a -- in a condition or -- or,

The word trust in -- as you're using it

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

don't

1

by virtue of the word trust, it is in a condition to avoid

2

taxation.

3

MR. GARRE:

4

QUESTION:

Well -I think you're saying that there are

5

no fiduciary duties beyond that.

6

beyond that, it's got to come from the Constitution, or

7

it's got to come from a specific provision of -- of a

8

statute creating a duty not necessarily as -- as that of a

9

trustee, but simply as a statutory duty.

10
11

If there is any duty

Isn't that

correct?
MR. GARRE:

That's correct when the tribe comes

12

into court under the Tucker Act and asserts a claim for

13

monetary damages against the United States Treasury.

14

We're dealing against an area of sovereign immunity where

15

the United States is immune from damages for breach of

16

trust unless Congress --

But I think you're saying two things,

and they -- they mesh perfectly.

1

that there might be equitable remedies based on -- on a

2

theory of fiduciary duty?
MR. GARRE:

3

It's conceivable that there would be

4

an equitable remedy based on a violation of statute, not

5

on equitable duties.

10

Stevens used?

If the Government said, 30 days from now,

11

we are going to blow up all the buildings, there would be

12

a -- an -- an equitable remedy based upon fiduciary duty?
MR. GARRE:

13

I think in that situation, Justice

14

Souter, the tribe might be able to bring an injunction --

15

injunctive action perhaps under the APA claiming that that

16

use of the property, the destruction of it, would exceed

17

the scope of the Government's use right under the 1960

18

act.

Justice Souter's question back before you -- and my own:

fiduciary obligations to the Indian tribes that this

4

Court has recognized.

5

recognized -- and I think it rejected the notion in the

6

Mitchell I case that --

7

QUESTION:

But the Court has never

Well, but do those general

8

obligations with reference to this property import any

9

duty other than the duty not to alienate and to ensure

10
11
12
13

that it's immune from State taxation?
MR. GARRE:

Not a duty and certainly not a duty

that's enforceable in an action for monetary damages.
QUESTION:

Well, I would have thought there

14

might well be a duty for the trustee -- the U.S.

15

Government acting as trustee here -- not to lay waste to

16

the property held in trust for the tribe --

17

MR. GARRE:

18

QUESTION:

Well --- not to affirmatively lay waste to

19

it or -- or allow something to happen that just the

20

ordinary care would suggest should not happen.

21

MR. GARRE:

Justice O'Connor, that duty

22

certainly is not expressed in the terms of the 1960

23

statute, and -- and, of course, there are other

24

statutory --

25

QUESTION:

Well, except to the extent that the

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

statute does say, all right, this property, Fort Apache,

2

is to be held by the U.S. Government in trust for the

3

tribe.

4

not alienating it, not laying waste to it.

5

what's done fits that I don't know.

6

and tear isn't covered, but --

7

MR. GARRE:

And maybe that conveys some notion, in addition to
Now, whether

Maybe ordinary wear

I -- I don't think that that

8

position would be consistent with the Court's ruling in

9

Mitchell I, where the Court rejected the notion that the

10

use of language, in trust, subjects the United States to

11

all the liabilities of a private trustee.
QUESTION:

12

Well, there's a little more here than

13

was true in Mitchell I.

14

in trust, and the Government can use it for a school or

15

administrative needs, but there -- there's something more

16

than was in Mitchell I.
MR. GARRE:

17

It's specific property, hold it

With respect, I think that there --

18

there's less, Justice O'Connor, that -- that Congress

19

specifically carved out of the trust relationship the

20

right of the Government to use the property for the

21

Government's purposes.
QUESTION:

22

Mr. Garre, there -- there is one

23

significant difference, and that is the control element.

24

Mitchell I stressed that the control was with the

25

allottee.

Mitchell II has a whole paragraph that says

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

what's key is who has control.

2

that these specific instructions were an indication that

3

the U.S. had exclusive control, but that the real thing

4

was the control, who has control of this property.
MR. GARRE:

5

And as I read it, it was

But -- but there's a key difference,

6

Justice Ginsburg, between this case and Mitchell II with

7

respect to the question of control.

8

Court emphasized throughout its decision and -- and

9

discussed the statutes and regulations in detail for more

In Mitchell II, the

10

than four pages.

The control stemmed from specific

11

statutory and regulatory duties that were created by

12

Congress in that case, and the Court found that the

13

violation of those specific duties, which could be

14

fairly -- fairly interpreted as mandating compensation,

15

gave rise to a damages claim against the United States.
In this case, the tribe can't point to a single

16
17

statute or regulation, and the only statute it relies in

18

this case -- in this Court is the 1960 act that creates

19

any --

20

QUESTION:

Well, then you're -- you're reading

21

it differently than I have just set it out.

As I take the

22

Court to have said control is key, and these specific

23

regulations show that there is indeed control, that the

24

United States runs the show.

25

trust, there wouldn't be any instructions.

But the nature of this

The question is

question?

The trust here refers not only to the land but

8

to the improvements.

9

a -- in a private situation wouldn't that normally create

10

in the -- the trustee a duty to ensure against fire, and

11

to take care of the improvements as opposed to just bare

12

legal title to the property?
MR. GARRE:

13

Doesn't that make a difference?

In

It -- it might, Justice Stevens, but

14

I think the reference to that also is important in terms

15

of Congress' express delegation to the Secretary the duty

16

to use all of the trust property, the land and the

17

buildings, to operate an Indian school there, which is

18

the -- the use that -- that the property had been put

19

since the 1920s.
QUESTION:

20

So in your -- in your opinion, if

21

this statute had added the words, and if the Government

22

does take control, it shall use ordinary prudence and

23

skill to preserve the property, then they'd have a claim.
MR. GARRE:

It -- it certainly would be a

When you say might, I'm just

imagining the same statute, everything that's gone on this

ordinary skill and prudence to preserve the property.

11

MR. GARRE:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. GARRE:

14

The -The answer then is yes or no?
Well, I think it would be no,

Justice Breyer, and if I could explain why.

QUESTION:

It would be no even then.

16

have we been arguing about --

17

MR. GARRE:

18

QUESTION:

Then what

Well --- because, I mean, everybody has

19

been asking you whether that can be implied here?

20

impression was you said yes.

21

MR. GARRE:

And my

I mean, if it --

Congress creates a number of duties.

22

And Congress has legislative -- of course, in the area of

23

historic preservation, and it creates duties that the

24

courts below found are procedural in nature.

25

And so if they said, and by the way,

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

if in fact they take control, the trustee -- i.e., the

2

United States -- has a duty when they take control to use

3

ordinary skill and prudence to preserve the property.
MR. GARRE:

4

Then the statute -- they would --

5

they would have a specific management duty.

6

question -QUESTION:

7

And so the answer is then they would

have -- they could -- then they'd win.

that.

11

And then the

MR. GARRE:

Right?

If it said

I -- I think they might under that

situation.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. GARRE:

Okay, fine.
But there's a second question under

14

the Court's cases that the Court would have to answer it,

15

and that's case two, and that's whether or not that

16

specific statutory duty can be fairly interpreted as

17

mandating the payment of compensation.

18

And it adds, and indeed if they

violate this, they have to pay a lot of money.

MR. GARRE:

MR. GARRE:

23

QUESTION:

Of -- of course, in that situation.
Okay.

Then we're all right.

Of course, in that situation -So our issue here -- what I'm getting

at is our issue then is whether that word control implies

MR. GARRE:

3

That's the question.

4

MR. GARRE:

Well --- that were, in fact, left out.
Is that right or not?
I don't think it's the question

5

because the word control doesn't appear anywhere in the

6

face of the statute.
QUESTION:

7

I'm sorry.

I -- I was reading --

8

it's subject to the right of the Secretary of Interior to

9

use any part of the land in improvements.

10

MR. GARRE:

11

QUESTION:

12

So I -- we have to decide right to

use -- does that imply those words that are left out.

13

MR. GARRE:

14

15

Right.

Right.
It didn't say he had to use it, did

it?

16

MR. GARRE:

17

QUESTION:

No.

QUESTION:

So in order to say he controlled it,

20
21

you -- you would have to say he -QUESTION:

QUESTION:

25

I misspoke.

I'm sorry to have mixed

people up.

22

24

No, not at all.

Right.
I meant right to use.

Does it imply

the words that are not there when they use it?
MR. GARRE:

Yes.

And -- and I think -- and if I

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

could be more clear, I think that we think the Court's

2

cases and the Tucker Act -- and -- and we think can also

3

look to cases in the section 1983 context -- establishes a

4

two-step inquiry.

5

duty on the Government's part, and second, can that duty

be fairly interpreted as mandating a payment of

trust and special relationship?
MR. GARRE:

I think the Court refused to do that

in the Mitchell I case because there, the Court used the

is destroying the land.

the City of Falls Church?

MR. GARRE:

I think what the -- I mean, there

24

you might have a situation where the question is whether

25

you could enforce obligations against a private individual

MR. GARRE:

The Little League or something.
-- that we referred to incorporate

14

the doctrine of sovereign immunity in this area, and you

15

could impose possibly injunctive -QUESTION:

16

Oh, is that all that -- that Scott on

17

trusts was referring to, just the doctrine of sovereign

18

immunity?

19

MR. GARRE:

20

QUESTION:

Well -Because if that's all he was

21

referring to, you know, that's been waived by -- by the

22

statute here.

23

MR. GARRE:

24

QUESTION:

25

No.
I thought there was something quite

different he was referring to, that the whole nature of a

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

public trust is different from a private trust.

2

not the case, then all of that is quite irrelevant it

seems to me.

MR. GARRE:

If that's

I -- I think it's both, Justice

5

Scalia, that the public trust is different in that we

don't ordinarily assume that the Government acts in all

its capacities as a private trustee.

true in the Indian law context.

This Court -- there are

10

11

use of the word in trust, the Government had assumed all

12

the liabilities of -- of a common law trustee, then that

13

would be an enormous potential liability that there's no

14

indication whatsoever Congress ever agreed to assume.

15

If the Court assumed just by Congress'

QUESTION:

Okay, Mr. Garre.

You're -- you're

16

arguing that you can't infer from the use of the word

17

trust that all of the obligations and all of the potential

18

liabilities of a private trustee are carried by it.

19

your argument seems to go, if I understand it, to the

20

other extreme, that the use of the word trust seems to

21

imply no obligation and no responsibility unless it is

22

followed by a specific delineation of what those

23

responsibilities are.

24
25

But

And my question is -- Justice Breyer a minute
ago was saying, well, what would be different if we added

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

certain words.

And my question is what would we -- be

2

different if we subtracted certain words on your theory?

3

What if the statute had not included the words, in trust?

4

Wouldn't your argument be exactly the same?
MR. GARRE:

5

Under the Tucker Act -- and, of

6

course, the Tucker Act doesn't refer to claims for breach

7

of trust.
QUESTION:

8
9

No, but would you answer my question?

Wouldn't you be -- aren't you making the same argument

10

under a statute that says in trust that you would be

11

making under a statute that did not include the words, in

12

trust, at all?

MR. GARRE:

13
14

Isn't that so?

Souter.

Yes.

That -- that's true, Justice

But I -- I think -QUESTION:

15

Then you -- what -- what are we to do

16

with the usual canon of construction that we assume that

17

Congress does not use useless words?
MR. GARRE:

18

Those words had great effect here.

19

They had the same effect that the words have -- this

20

Court has recognized -- with respect to the alienation of

21

land and with respect to immunization of land to State

22

taxation.

23

QUESTION:

Yes.

They -- they couldn't alienate

24

under a statute that says the -- the land and et cetera

25

will be held by the United States for the tribe.

And if in fact that's all the

phrase, in trust, that normally carries enormous

18

implications?

19

MR. GARRE:

The -- that -- that line of argument

20

is the argument that we think that the court of appeal --

21

the Court of Claims made in Mitchell I and that the

22

dissenters made in Mitchell I, and we think that the

majority of the Court rejected --

MR. GARRE:

Yes, and it -- and it would do so

under the statute if the words, in trust, weren't used.
MR. GARRE:

That -- that -- it also has -- in

MR. BRAUCHLI:

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:
If the Secretary of the Interior had never taken

7
8

control of these buildings, we would not be here.

9

would be a -- a bare trust.

Simply putting these

10

buildings in trust does not create any fiduciary

obligations.
But the Secretary did take control.

12

It

It's not

13

mandatory; it's voluntary.

14

exactly like Mitchell II.

15

between the General Allotment Act and managing a forest.

16

But when you look at the forest management statute,

17

there's a direct nexus from the forest management statutes

18

to control of the forest, and when you control the forest,

19

to the exclusion of the tribe, then you are responsible as

20

a fiduciary.

the water and sewer system, the electrical system, as well

as the buildings that they used and controlled.

total, exclusive control.

QUESTION:

They had

But if they didn't -- in Justice

14

Kennedy's question, if the United States didn't use it for

administrative and school purposes, then the United

States, under the terms of the trust, has no right to hold

it because they have this exclusive right of occupancy

18

only for those purposes.

19

it would be -- wouldn't it belong to the tribe?

20

MR. BRAUCHLI:

And if they just let the -- then

It expires and they -- they said

21

that in the court of appeals below that the -- the circuit

22

judges said, well, can you use it as a uranium dump?

23

the Department of Justice said, no, because that would be

24

a breach of the trust because we're only allowed to use it

for school or administrative purposes.

Therefore, a

2

I think waste is a use outside what Congress

3

allowed them, and it's a specific use and it should be

4

construed against the easement.

wide open.
QUESTION:

6

The easements are not

Yes, but I'm not sure you confront

7

the question, and I'm not sure what the answer is.

If the

8

waste -- duty to protect waste requires spending some

9

money, whose money do you spend?

The trustee's or the

10

trust's?

11

If you buy an insurance policy, does the trustee pay for

12

out of his own pocket or out of trust assets?

13

The beneficiary's money or the trustee's money?

MR. BRAUCHLI:

Well, I think in this case the

14

United States was obligated to prevent the deterioration.

15

All they have to do is repair -- they have

basketball-sized holes in the roof letting rain in which

17

progressively deteriorates -- deteriorates the property.

20

QUESTION:

Could the United States have used

MR. BRAUCHLI:

I think they should use their own

protect the property because they have --

MR. BRAUCHLI:

QUESTION:

I don't -- well, they

Could they cut down some trees and

MR. BRAUCHLI:

Would that have been

Of the tribe's timber?

Yes.
I would say they cannot do that

without the tribe's permission.

So it's literally got to come out of

18

a pocket of the National Government which has no relation

19

to the tribe's assets is what you're saying.

MR. BRAUCHLI:

That's what I'm saying.

we decide if it's that third party's responsibility, or if

3

trust assets should have been used?

4

thinking that --

5

MR. BRAUCHLI:

6

QUESTION:

How do

I mean, here I'm

Well --

-- the trustee is both the trustee

7

and the third party himself because he's using it for his

8

own purposes.

9

MR. BRAUCHLI:

Well, under landlord and tenant

10

law, the tenant would certainly be liable for the waste,

11

and this Court said that in the Bostwick case.

12
13
14

QUESTION:

Would the tenant have to repair the

holes in the roof?
MR. BRAUCHLI:

The tenant would be responsible.

15

Any lease of tribal property by a -- a tenant, the -- the

16

duty is to the United States as well as the tribe.

17

the United States under the leasing regulations has an

18

absolute duty to go in there and protect the -- to protect

the value of the property -- and I put that in my brief --

20

the value of the property from a tenant who's injuring

And

So here they're saying we're like a

you're --

What is the measure of the damages

MR. BRAUCHLI:

3

I think the measure of damages

would be against the measuring stick of a reasonable

trustee in like circumstances in total control of the

6

trust corpus of his beneficiary.

7

amount of damages necessary to bring it up to code, less

So it would be -- that -- that would

be the -- 14 million-dollar figure to bring it up to code?
MR. BRAUCHLI:

11

Well, that was been altered

12

because the tribe has engaged in a little self-help, and

13

we actually took over five -- five buildings, and we had a

14

grant from the White House Save America's Treasures and

15

the National Endowment of the Humanities and the State of

16

Arizona, and the tribe put 2 million of their own dollars.

17

So I think that figure is more like $8 million, and

18

that's -QUESTION:

19

But you're still -- what you're

If you want them, they're yours and

MR. BRAUCHLI:

6

They don't own them, and under

Mitchell II, this Court said that when the United States

8

is in control of a -- of a resource of a tribe, a -- a

9

fiduciary relationship is established in respect to that

10

resource.
QUESTION:

11

No, but isn't your argument that

12

they -- I -- I'm not saying whether you win or lose on it,

13

but isn't your argument that they are obliged to give us

place when they were in control?

(Laughter.)

3

MR. BRAUCHLI:

It's -- it's a progressive

4

deterioration of the buildings.

5

that -- they just started to board them up, and -- and we

6

said, okay, we'll take -- they said -- well, actually,

they wrote a letter, said they're yours.

what do you mean they're -- they're ours?

And then when they felt

Congress intended.

So here's the executive branch saying,

we don't care what Congress gave you.

And that's the point of the damage claim.

18

We went to the Secretary and they said -- after

19

a year of wasting my time at the solicitor's office, they

20

said -- finally, the Special Assistant to the Secretary

said, you're going to have to sue us because we're not

going to give you the money, and we feel we have the right

23

to destroy this property.

1

2

act, we have the right to dynamite it.
And somehow it's been held in some kind of

3
4

purgatory state where what Congress intended to give to

5

the tribe wasn't really intended to give to the tribe.

6

It's a -- it's a plaything for the BIA to play with and

7

destroy.

8

And that's not the fiduciary relationship that

9

this Court has been noted for in -- in respect to a one-

10

on-one relationship.

In Nevada versus United States, we

11

said, when it's one on one, a fiduciary relationship and

12

there's a fiduciary obligation incumbent upon the United

States when it deals with Indian people.

We're saying take the 1960 condition,

and the waste you committed from 1960 when it's under your

control.

restore it back to its -- as they say -- Old West shape.

5

We're just asking it -- for the condition that when we got

I'm not.

Is it your theory that they are responsible for

Because I take it those -- for some buildings --

MR. BRAUCHLI:

Yes.

There's -- they maintain

21

that they relinquished some buildings and therefore it's

22

barred by the statute of limitations.

23

QUESTION:

No.

But what is your theory?

Is it

24

that their responsibility is measured by the date at which

25

they ceased to use, or the date at which they relinquished

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

MR. BRAUCHLI:

It was the date when they

relinquished control and we accepted it because we refused

to accept them without the money to repair them.

MR. BRAUCHLI:

None.

Can the Government terminate this

the Court said that there's an implied covenant against
