ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
When libraries block Internet pornography from

12

their computer terminals, they are simply declining to put

13

onto their computer screens the same content they have

14

traditionally excluded from their bookshelves.

15

offering Internet access without pornography, freedom of

16

speech is expanded, not abridged.

17

Internet Protection Act, or CIPA, no Internet speech is

18

prohibited, inhibited, threatened, or chilled.

19

are simply exercising their discretion as to the content

20

that their libraries will contain, the historic discretion

21

to exercise that -- that authority, and to how their

22

library resources will be used.

23

QUESTION:

By

Under the Children's

Libraries

Mr. Olson, you have a number of

24

important legal concepts to address.

25

questions.

I have three factual

I've been through the extensive opinion of the

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

district court, and -- and they may be important for me.

2

Three different things.
When the library patron requests that the filter

3
4

be disabled, does he have to explain why he wants it

5

disabled?
MR. OLSON:

6
7

No.

Shall I wait until you've

asked --

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. OLSON:

Go ahead.
It's my understanding that the --

10

the library patron would not have to explain any reason

11

why he was asking a site to be unblocked or the filtering

12

to be disabled.
QUESTION:

13

That's the next question.

Do you ask

14

site by site or can I -- can the library patron say,

15

unblock the whole thing?
MR. OLSON:

16

The library patron, if the patron is

17

an adult, can ask the -- the entire filtering to be

18

disabled, and the library may disable -- I mean, eliminate

19

the filtering with respect to specific sites either on

20

their own or at the request of a patron.

21

QUESTION:

All right.

22

And third, the district court said in some cases

23

it takes 24 hours to a week.

Is that the usual thing or

24

does -- in many cases can the librarian just push a

25

button?

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. OLSON:

I think that it is -- it is -- the

2

record is not clear on that, and I -- but my -- my

3

experience and my judgment in connection with our

4

preparation is that it need not be a very difficult thing.

5

It's something that libraries can do without a great deal

6

of difficulty.

7

all, it would be the same as asking for a book that is not

8

on the shelf or asking for an inter-library loan, the kind

9

of customary things that library patrons do when they ask

10
11

But to the extent that it took any time at

for a book or a resource in a library.
QUESTION:

Is -- is there anything in the

12

statute that would prohibit a library from doing the

13

following?

14

the screen, come up and ask, do you want to do it, and you

15

-- we can tell you, don't watch these obscene child

16

pornography, et cetera.

17

statute prohibit the library from doing that?

18

Any adult who wants to watch the thing without

MR. OLSON:

Then we disconnect it.

Does the

If I understand your question

19

correctly, I -- I know of nothing in the statute that

20

would prohibit the library from doing that, provided that

21

the -- the person asks and the patron asking is an adult.

22

The First Amendment does not require libraries

23

to sponsor the viewing of pornography.

When Government

24

gives financial aid to speech on Government premises, it

25

may make rational choices as to what not to finance.

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Those -- that -- that doctrine is consistent with this

2

Court's previous decisions.

3

particular content, Congress and this Court have found

4

that Government has -- the Government has a compelling

5

interest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity,

6

child pornography, and in the case of minors, material

7

that is harmful to children.

8

traditionally excluded from public libraries, and

9

Government has a basic, fundamental right in addition not

10
11

In connection with this

Such material has been

to associate with or finance pornography.
QUESTION:

Isn't part of the problem that a lot

12

more is being excluded?

13

statute requires that a -- a filter of some sort be used.

14

Filters are not sold -- the blocking devices are not sold

15

or prepared apparently in terms of the concepts that the

16

statute uses.

17

even disclose what in fact they are blocking so that it

18

seems that an inevitable price of this is blocking more

19

than -- than the statute requires, and that's even without

20

getting into the question of blocking material for adults

21

as -- as opposed -- that -- that might be unsuitable for

22

children, but certainly aren't for adults.

23

I mean, as I understand it, the

The companies that do prepare them will not

How do you -- how do you get over the problem of

24

the -- sort of the -- the imprecision, the crudity, the

25

overkill of the blocking devices?

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. OLSON:

Justice Souter, that is -- that is

2

true that any system is going to involve some over-

3

blocking and under-blocking because it's impossible to

4

know what is going to be coming over the Internet or

5

impossible to make systems that are perfect.

6

consistent with what -- the historical decisions that

7

libraries have made.

8

QUESTION:

But that's

But there's one thing that is clearly

9

inconsistent I think, and that is when the libraries make

10

-- historically have made these decisions, they've known

11

what they weren't buying or weren't stocking on their

12

shelves, and here they don't --

13

MR. OLSON:

14

QUESTION:

15

Well --- because they -- the blocking

makers regard that as proprietary information.

16

MR. OLSON:

It's -- there's several answers to

17

that it seems to me.

In the first place, libraries have

18

known that they have not stocked pornography, and it's not

19

because of space, popularity, or expense.

20

chosen traditionally not to stock that type of material.

21

Every time a library decides not to subscribe to a

22

magazine, it is over-blocking in a sense.

23

have three pornographic pictures in it or sexually

24

explicit pictures in --

25

QUESTION:

They have

A magazine may

But it -- but it does know what the

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

magazine is, and here it does not know what the website

2

is.
MR. OLSON:

3

It knows what the magazine has been.

4

It may not know what the magazine is in the future.

5

Furthermore, librarians don't read every book.
QUESTION:

6

No, but it -- you know, it knows it's

7

Playboy or whatever the magazine is, and here it doesn't

8

know what the website is that's being excluded.
MR. OLSON:

9

Yes, but it can -- it can test this

10

-- what we're saying here with respect to that is over-

11

blocking or under-blocking is a necessary part of the

12

library function of making appropriateness judgments with

13

respect to content generally.

14

distinction -QUESTION:

15

That's the type of

Well, I -- I have a problem with --

16

with that.

17

argument is you want us to think of this just in the same

18

context of the librarian going through a list of books and

19

deciding what books to buy.

20

that.

21

into the system every day?

22

It's not like a library.

23

It -- it seems to me a large part of your

What is it?

But the Internet isn't like

There's a -- 1.5 million new entries

MR. OLSON:

Yes.

This is a whole new medium.

And, Justice Kennedy, it seems

24

to -- it seems to the Government and it seemed -- it

25

seemed to Congress that gross judgments are going to have

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

to be made.

These libraries, as the record reflects and

2

the findings of the district court reveal, traditionally

3

or -- or customarily block e-mail, chat, gambling, gaming,

4

dating services, and some of them, as reflected -- I think

5

it's on page 37, 38 of the appendix to the jurisdictional

6

statement -- make -- make judgments with respect to what's

7

appropriate, what's offensive.

8

are being made.

Those types of judgments

Yes, this is a new medium and it's --

9

QUESTION:

10

Well, but General Olson, there are

11

supposed to be 90,000 books a year published in the United

12

States.

13

know of the existence of all of those 90,000 books?

14

Do you think librarians know the contents or even

MR. OLSON:

No, that -- Mr. Chief Justice,

This is a difference in quantity, but

15

that's our point.

16

it is not a difference generically from what libraries

17

traditionally have done.

18

QUESTION:

But when the library makes a book

19

decision, doesn't it make a decision that says, we will

20

not put God's Little Acre on our shelves?

21

no decision with respect to the book.

22

there are lots of books out there that the library not --

23

may not know about, but when it makes a decision not to

24

put it on the shelf, it knows what it's deciding not to

25

do, and here it doesn't.

It's a yes or

It's quite true

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. OLSON:

Well, in a specific situation, a

2

library might know that.

3

would just stock history books or just stock -- stock

4

novels of a particular period.

5

that libraries don't have the right to make those

6

decisions and customarily make those decisions.
QUESTION:

7

A library might decide that it

There's nothing to suggest

Sure, but somebody along the line

8

knows what they've decided to buy within the category and

9

what they haven't decided to buy.
MR. OLSON:

10

Well, that's right, but the

11

traditional decisions that libraries have made -- and the

12

appellees do not dispute this -- is that libraries have

13

not chosen to stock the types of material on their shelves

14

that they're now being asked to keep out with respect to

15

the Internet.

16

medium.

17

This is a similar decision with a different

QUESTION:

No, but that's -- that's true.

But I

18

think the thing that -- one of the things that's troubling

19

us is they're -- they're -- they are -- they are forced,

20

by virtue of that decision, not to stock a lot of other

21

material, and they don't even know what it is and there's

22

no way for them to find out.

23

MR. OLSON:

But, Justice Souter, they -- they

24

may on their own -- there's a -- there's -- one of the

25

materials that's in the record is someone that made a

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

study of several hundred thousand sites and decided which

2

ones were properly blocked or improperly blocked.

3

types of studies may be used to unblock sites, to modify

4

the filtering system.

5

create their own filtering system rather than the ones

6

that are --

7

QUESTION:

Those

Libraries could get together and

Could the library in -- General

8

Olson, in view of what you answered earlier, you said any

9

patron could say, I want to unblock everything.

Could the

10

library say, well, we want our staff to have access to

11

everything?

12

for the computers that we use internally.

13

answer to that question was no, but it seems inconsistent

14

with the answer that you gave.

15

see everything.

16

Therefore, we are going to unblock everything
I thought the

A patron says, I want to

Fine.

MR. OLSON:

Well, I -- I believe that the answer

17

is that, A, the librarian can, in response to a request

18

from a patron, unblock the filtering mechanism altogether.

19

And secondly, I think it's not entirely -- it's not -- the

20

statute doesn't get into it, but it -- but it seems

21

entirely consistent with what I've just said, and I think

22

consistent with the import of your question is that the

23

library staff can disable the filter in order to make

24

judgments about whether something has been, quote,

25

properly or improperly blocked.

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Because one of the things that was

2

criticized about this statute was that every terminal,

3

even the ones in the librarian's own office, closed

4

office, has to have this filtering.

5

no, they don't.

6

the library's option.

7

they can.

You -- you make it sound like it's really

MR. OLSON:

8

But your answer is,

If they want to put everything on,

I -- I was answering your question

9

with respect to what the staff may review in making the

10

administrative decisions with respect to unblocking or

11

other decisions with respect to the implementation of the

12

statute.

13

this technological mechanism by which this material can be

14

filtered out or is designed and calculated to do that.

15

doesn't -- the statute does not require perfection.

16

doesn't require librarians to act in --

17

The statute speaks in terms of having in place

General Olson, if I understand the

18

situation correctly, the libraries are wasting a lot of

19

money litigating.

into the library everyday and say, please unblock

21

everything, and then they could do it.

22

It

They could simply hire somebody to come

MR. OLSON:

With respect to that patron.

I

23

mean, the -- the -- if my answer suggested that the

24

library could just switch off the filter on a daily basis,

25

I didn't mean to say anything remotely like that.

QUESTION:

MR. OLSON:

Oh, okay.
It -- this -- particular patrons may

3

say, I'm investigating breast cancer.

This -- the sites

4

-- some of the sites that I'm looking for I can't find,

5

and they appear to be on block.

I've heard about these sites -- be unblocked?

Can those sites -- or

MR. OLSON:

I just want

Isn't that right?
That's -- that's correct.

Yes,

that's correct.
QUESTION:

13

I wonder how -- how effective that --

14

that system is in -- in achieving some of the goals of the

15

statute which -- which is not just that -- that some

16

people using the -- the Net happen to stumble across

17

pornographic stuff but also, passing by, see it, and --

18

and including children.

The system is not perfect.

It is not going to be

Why couldn't the -- why couldn't the

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the other isn't.
MR. OLSON:

2

Well, I think that is -- again, is a

3

practical judgment that may work in some libraries.

4

might require a great deal more resources from librarians.

5

It might require establishing different screens and

6

mechanisms.

7

have done this differently, but this is a rational

8

judgment, consistent with --

Yes, there are ways in which Congress could

QUESTION:

9

It

May I go back to Justice Ginsburg's

10

question with respect to the library staff on the

11

unblocking?

12

the library say, we want our staff to have free access on

13

the computers that they use, not that we want them to be

14

able to look behind the block to see what's being kept

15

out.

16

that a violation of the statute?

17

I -- I think her original question was, could

We just want them to have a free computer.

MR. OLSON:

Is -- is

I had thought it was --

I think that the -- my answer to

18

your question, if I understand it correctly, is that the

19

computers in the library, if the library uses the -- the

20

Federal funds with either respect to the discounts or the

21

subsidies, direct subsidies, all the computers in that

22

library must be equipped with the technology protection

23

measure with respect to each of those computers.

25

QUESTION:

And that would include the staff

computers.

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

MR. OLSON:

Yes.

But that does not preclude the

2

staff from determining, in connection with specific

3

requests --

4

QUESTION:

Yes, but that's not the question.

5

The question is can the library say, this is ridiculous

blocking this stuff for our staff.

block them.

no blocks or every morning we will press the button that

9

unblocks the staff computers.

The staff computers are either going to have

We're not going to

Well -That would violate the statute,

wouldn't it?
MR. OLSON:

Well, one could -- you're in an

14

area, it seems to me, that -- where there might be an as-

15

applied challenge.

16

to the constitutionality of the statute.

17
18
19

We're talking about a facial challenge

QUESTION:

And we want to know the extent of the

statutory prohibition.
MR. OLSON:

I -- I understand that.

I -- and

discretion with respect to a filter.

MR. OLSON:

I don't think so, Justice Souter.
That would violate it.
That's right.

But remember, this is

in the context of -- of material that's been traditionally

10

excluded by libraries, that libraries are free to put on

11

their shelves in the form of books anytime they want.
It -- the -- the position of the district court

I don't -- I don't

believe that the statute would prohibit that set of

QUESTION:

20

Yes, but it would apply if they had,

say, ten computers and nine of them were financed by the

22

That one would be covered by the statute.

MR. OLSON:

17

QUESTION:

18

Well, you -- you could have it on a

separate phone line, it seems to me.

13
14

In the first place,

is it's -- the -- the library would have to decide --

11
12

Because it's a reasonable condition

The statute would still apply.
Yes, it would.

Yes, it would.

And how do you justify that under the

Spending Clause?
MR. OLSON:

19

We believe that it's a reasonable

20

condition that Congress reasonably -- the patrons may not

21

be able to distinguish where the -QUESTION:

22

Well, wouldn't it be equally

23

unreasonable if we said it applies to separate facilities

24

too?

25

distinction between a branch library that has one computer

I don't know why -- I don't understand the

1

in it and a big central library with 10 computers, one of

2

which is separately financed.

3

MR. OLSON:

Well, again, as we said in our

4

briefs, that to the extent that that is an issue, it

5

should be made -- that point should be made in a -- in an

6

as-applied challenge to the statute, as opposed to a

7

challenge on the face.

8

technologically going to be a problem and we do think that

9

Congress can reasonably have assumed we're using Federal

We don't think it's

10

money to finance Internet in this library.

11

going to be exposed.

12

we would like patrons not to be exposed in this manner to

13

that material, and the Congress could well have decided

14

that it -- the taxpayers don't want to be associated with

15

a subsidy of that types of material -- that type of

16

material which has traditionally been excluded from the

17

libraries in any event.

18

QUESTION:

Patrons are

If you're going to take the money,

Well, you're saying not only that

19

they -- that they don't want to be associated with the

20

subsidizing of it, but they -- you're saying they don't

21

want to subsidize an operation which includes some non-

22

subsidized material of this sort.

23

that in --

24
25

MR. OLSON:

Don't you have to say

I -- well, I think that that would

be a reasonable choice for Congress to make.

QUESTION:

2

MR. OLSON:

You say they've made it.
Well, with respect to all of the

3

computers in the library in -- in that narrow context,

4

yes, but I do think that that's the -- we're getting down

5

to the refinements of particular applications and those

6

types of challenges have not yet been made.

7

QUESTION:

General Olson, the words of the

8

statute itself, though -- there is some ambiguity.

It's

9

-- with regard to disabling the filter, the words are for

10

bona fide research or other lawful use.

11

thinking that your prior answer meant other lawful use

12

means anything?

13

obscenity would be a lawful use.

14

And am I right in

So, in effect, for an adult anything but

MR. OLSON:

I believe that that's -- that's --

15

well, child pornography would also be excluded.

16

obscenity and child pornography --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. OLSON:

Both

Yes.
-- there are Federal criminal

19

statutes with respect to both of those.

20

this is a reasonable effort by the library -- by the

21

Congress to make rational decisions with respect to

22

allowing for some escape for people who are doing research

23

or for other appropriate purposes.

24
25

QUESTION:

And -- and again,

Yes, but -- but how would that

authorize the unblocking entirely which would let in not

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

just the material that's useful for research, but also

2

obscenity, also child pornography?

3

-- a lawful use?

4

it?

That's allowing an unlawful use, isn't

5

MR. OLSON:

6

QUESTION:

7

Well, I -- I agree with that, but -So if you agree with it, it means

that -- that -MR. OLSON:

8
9

How is that allowing a

If -- if -- excuse me, Justice

Scalia.
QUESTION:

10

No.

I think if you agree with it, it

11

-- it means that you can't unblock a whole channel.

12

can say, I'll let you have this material, but I can't

13

unblock this channel.

14

MR. OLSON:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

You

The -- the -God knows what else there is out

there.
MR. OLSON:

The statute put it in terms of bona

18

fide research or other lawful purposes.

19

bound to be some interpretive -- given the joints there.

20

And again, to the extent that that would trigger a funding

21

decision with respect to the enforcement authority or

22

something, that's appropriately raised in an as-applied

23

challenge.

24
25

That -- there's

I think it's important to stress the converse of
what the appellees are asking for here.

They're asking

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

this Court to make a judgment that the First Amendment

2

prohibits them from exercising the discretion to make that

3

kind of choice with respect to the Internet that they've

4

always made or traditionally made with respect to the

5

books on their shelf.

6

The consequence of that, it seems to me, would

7

be strict scrutiny applicable to librarians' judgments

8

with respect to not just the Internet, but microfilm,

9

television, other medium that might -- other media that

10

might come into the library, and that librarians, instead

11

of spending money on books, are going to be spending money

12

on lawyers defending cases brought by authors saying, you

13

-- you violated my First Amendment right not to have

14

strict scrutiny, and that instead of librarians making

15

these --

16

QUESTION:

But, General Olson, Justice White

17

wrote a number of opinions in the First Amendment area

18

where he started out saying, this is a case about

19

billboards, or this is a case about something else.

20

would think this is a case about the Internet.

21

case about books.

22

MR. OLSON:

I

It's not a

Well, it might be if the decision

23

was written that way, Justice Stevens, but if -- if the

24

appellees are right, the types of decisions that

25

librarians have been making, appropriateness is -- is the

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

word, quality, appropriateness, and appropriate decisions

2

-- it's -- it's in the record.

3

the librarians are saying -- asking this Court to say are

4

subject to strict scrutiny and violate the Constitution.

5

This Court would have to make a First Amendment

6

distinction between the selection of a book and the

7

selection of another source of information.
QUESTION:

8
9

Those types of decisions

But isn't there a practical

distinction that's got to be taken into consideration in

10

your argument?

And that is, not every library can have

11

every book.

12

start with the assumption that the librarians have got to

13

make these judgments.

14

in the case of the Internet at all.

Something has got to be excluded.

So we

We don't start with that assumption

And the question in the case of the Internet is

15
16

the different one.

Can you require them to exclude

17

certain materials that it would be illegal for them to

18

have as -- as an abstract matter?

Sure, I suppose.

But the -- the tough question is, can you

19
20

require them necessarily to exclude a great deal more

21

about which they make no decision whatsoever and which

22

would be perfectly legal for them to have?
MR. OLSON:

MR. OLSON:

But the case comes to this Court in the posture

15

that the district court has held and the appellees are

16

arguing that for the library voluntarily to make that

17

choice on their own, irrespective of any Federal

18

Government subsidy or anything, would violate the First

19

Amendment rights of their patrons.

20

QUESTION:

General Olson, what does the record

disclose is the percentage of lawful material that is

Now, the

MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Children's Internet Protection Act is

presumptively unconstitutional.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

-- in conduct that is presumptively unconstitutional?
MR. SMITH:

2

This Court's whole series of cases

3

involving the public forum doctrine, Your Honor, which I

4

noticed was -- was not really mentioned by my colleague,

5

Mr. Olson.
The Internet, when it comes into the library, is

6
7

-- all of the information available on the Internet, as

8

diverse as human thought -- immediately available to the

9

patron.

10
11

It is the most pure form of public forum that you

can possibly imagine.
QUESTION:

Yes, but it begs the question.

The

12

-- the point is that the Government is saying, if you want

13

to get our money, you don't let it all come in.

14

not -- it is not a public forum once -- once the -- once

15

the blocking is applied.

16

MR. SMITH:

So it is

Well, Your Honor, the whole question

17

about whether the library could do it this way depends on

18

how you view the public forum doctrine.

19

the Court has said again and again is in deciding whether

20

something is or is not a public forum, you look at whether

21

the access is selective or general.

MR. SMITH:

The Internet terminals in the

library are a designated public forum, Your Honor.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. SMITH:

Not the whole library?
Certainly not.

We do not say that

12

strict scrutiny applies to the decisions that the library

13

makes about which book to buy because when the library

14

buys books, it chooses books one by one.

selective access as opposed to general access.

It engages in

With the Internet, on the other hand, the entire

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:

It has not been selected --

Not --- by the library in any way.
Not necessarily.

I mean, a library

22

says -- and some have -- some did this before -- before

23

the Federal statute was in effect.

24

there's this whole wide world of the Internet out there,

25

but we don't want all of it.

A library says,

Some of it is garbage, and

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

therefore we're going to block the obscenity.

2

to block the child pornography, and we're going to block

3

the -- the pornography that's harmful to children.

4

once they've made that decision, hey, presto, it is not a

5

public forum anymore.

6

MR. SMITH:

We're going

Now,

That -- that -- with respect,

7

Justice Scalia, the way the public forum doctrine works in

8

our judgment -- and we're basing this as -- as close as we

9

can on this Court's cases -- is that the one thing that

10

Government can't do is allow all content under the sun,

11

not even knowing what content is there, and then exclude,

12

cull out one area of disfavored content.

13

that that exclusion, that -- that pointing at that one

14

particular area of content and excluding it, is the same

15

as not making it a public forum, then -- then the public

16

forum doctrine no longer has any meaning.

MR. SMITH:

I would have to know how the

QUESTION:

No, no.

Exactly everything is the

6

same.

I just want to know on your theory of the public

7

forum doctrine is the 10th grade library or in an

8

elementary school or a high school -- they have -- they do

9

exactly what the libraries do here.
MR. SMITH:

10
11

13

Then I -- then I do say it's a

12

Is it a public forum?

If they allow students --

All right.

So on your theory of the

case --

14

MR. SMITH:

15

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- then if it is a public forum, the

tailoring, less restrictive alternatives, compelling

these other alternatives and all -- all the -- I'm -- I'm

7

just -- I'm not putting a -- I'm putting a difficult --

8

what to me is -- is a difficult problem with your

9

doctrine.

10

And I -- I want to see how it works here.
MR. SMITH:

But I think the Constitution

11

analysis may well come out differently with respect to

12

young children, Your Honor.

13

QUESTION:

Well, but I -- I need to know fairly

14

specifically because I don't want if there -- if -- to me

15

frankly if -- if your theory of it means that every public

16

school has to have a computer attachment which bring this

17

material into the school, I suppose a lot of schools

18

wouldn't have computers at all in their libraries.

19

and that is worrying me.

And --

So I'd appreciate --

20

MR. SMITH:

Well --

21

QUESTION:

-- a fairly definite answer on this.

22

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, I think that -- that,

23

first of all, classrooms are different from libraries even

24

in the school context because a school classroom --

25

library -- a computer is obviously not used for

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

independent research.

If the -- in the library situation

in the school, you would have different age groups.

have different considerations.

5

distinguished from this case.

You'd

You'd have different

There's a lot of different things that could be

6

And I think it -- it's important --

7

QUESTION:

So your answer is that in your

8

opinion now you think it probably would be constitutional

9

as applied to school libraries but not as to public

10
11

libraries?
MR. SMITH:

It -- it may well be, Your Honor,

12

depending on the age group, depending on the

13

circumstances, depending on the way the -- the library is

14

used by the students.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, why shouldn't we be

16

conscious of the holding of this Court in Denver Area v.

17

the FCC where the Court concluded it might be premature to

18

apply forum analysis due to changes taking place in the

19

law, the technology, and the industrial structure related

20

to telecommunications?

21

area for caution, is it not, in importing wholesale public

22

forum analysis in the library?

23

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:

25

I mean, this too seems to me an

Well, Your Honor -I would think Denver Area would have

some bearing on that.

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. SMITH:

Denver Area has a substantial

2

bearing and I think it's one of the strongest cases

3

supporting our position.

4

not go -- it -- the -- the plurality opinion in -- in the

5

case did not go so far as to say we're going to apply a

6

public forum analysis and strict scrutiny, but -- but

7

Justice Breyer's opinion went much -- very close to that

8

and said we're going to apply very heightened scrutiny.

9

We're going to look very carefully at this.

It is true that the Court did

And this was a law that is in many ways closely

10
11

analogous to what's going on here.

12

said, we have a public access station.

13

outside world can come in and put whatever programming

14

they want on that station, but we're going to exclude

15

indecency, just that one area of content, because we don't

16

think that belongs in the home.
QUESTION:

17

It was a law that
Anybody from the

But the -- the other part -- assuming

18

it's some kind of stricter than just reasonable, however

19

that is brought about, the -- I'm very much concerned also

about something Justice Kennedy raised.

statute means is that a person who wants access to the

22

These 10,000 pages which now were

to the desk and says, please unblock it.

want.

7

child pornography.

8

say, fine.

I want to use --

I'm not going to look at material that is

And then the library is free -- will

9

MR. SMITH:

10

QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor -Now, if all that's necessary, you

11

have to go to the desk, what is the great burden on

12

speech?

13

to keep certain materials in a special place in the

14

library and you had to go and ask for them.

15

After all, I grew up in a world where they used

MR. SMITH:

So?

Well, Your Honor, the -- the way the

16

disabling provision is set up, first of all, is it's

17

designed to give the library some job to determine whether

18

your purpose is bona fide or not.

It says bona fide

19

research or other lawful purpose.

So the first problem is

20

you go to the librarian's supervisor who has the authority

21

under the statute to turn off the filter and you have to

22

explain to them what your purpose is to look at the --

23
24
25

QUESTION:

General Olson said no, you don't have

to explain.
MR. SMITH:

Well, the -- the statute on the face

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

of it says the library is required to inquire into your

2

purpose and make a decision about whether it is a bona

3

fide research purpose or other lawful purpose for looking

4

at the material which has been filtered out by the -- by

5

the filter.
So you have a discretion problem of severe

6
7

proportions, I submit.

8

very much like the one -QUESTION:

9

Plus, you have a stigma problem,

But not if you read other lawful

10

purpose to mean everything except the specific categories,

11

child pornography, obscenity.
MR. SMITH:

12

They will presumably have to have

13

some information about what sites you're interested in

14

looking at in order to determine whether that would be

15

lawful or not.

16

well, what's -- what is it you need to get that's being

17

blocked?

So they will then have to inquire into,

Why are you looking at it?
QUESTION:

18

Is it lawful?

It doesn't say that in the statute.

19

All it says in the statute is that the administrator may

20

disable a technology protection to enable access for a

21

lawful purpose.

22

paper saying I do not want to use this for an unlawful

23

purpose?

24

prevents the library from accepting that?

25

So why couldn't you just sign a piece of

Period.

End of the matter.

MR. SMITH:

What in the statute

Well, clearly the library is

34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

responsible for determining whether or not you fall within

2

the exception.

3

the statute -- and I think this is unclear -- just to

4

accept your representation without any further

5

explanation, you still have the problem that you're going

6

There's a third problem, which is

you have -- a lot of times this will only come up in the

middle of your research session.

14

you're going to be blocked getting access to the

15

Republican National Committee site or to the site for some

orphanage that is trying to raise money.

17

the -- many of the blocks are so irrational, you can't

anticipate it.

getting this site unblocked.

But in a library, when you're looking

23

for a book, it might not be there, and you might have to

go to the librarian and order it or borrow it from another

I don't think that's atypical of what

happens in research.

2

MR. SMITH:

But certainly, Your Honor.

But --

3

but our submission is that you shouldn't just willy-nilly

4

compare the Internet in the public library to books and

5

how they're handled by libraries because the Internet is a

6

public forum.

7

prescreened or preselected by the Government which they

are making available to you --

MR. SMITH:

That's what we're here to

Indeed, Your Honor.

And -- and the

19

Court has repeatedly cautioned that when you're making a

20

decision about whether something is a public forum, you

21

have to look at the particular medium of communication

22

that is at issue, not the broader context.

23

So, for example, when the Court in Cornelius was

24

looking at the Combined Federal Campaign and trying to

25

decide whether that was a public forum, the Government

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

said, well, it's the Federal work force.

basis.

Well, if you say that the world we

11

look at is the people using these programs under the

12

Federal law requirements in libraries, then it isn't a

13

public forum.

14

MR. SMITH:

Well, Your Honor, if you allow the

15

Government to define its forum as all content under sun --

16

under the sun ever invented by mankind except the piece

17

that they don't like, then I submit that -- that will be

18

the end of the public forum doctrine because there will

never be any situation in which the Government will be

20

constrained in any way to censor out a particular piece of

21

content that it -- from the public forum.

MR. SMITH:

Traditional public forums will always

QUESTION:

But -- but you -- you said at the --

2

at the outset that it would be -- as I understood it, that

it would be unconstitutional for you to do this on your

4

own initiative.

And now you're saying that you could?

MR. SMITH:

5

No, no, no.

It would be -- it would

the statute requires.

say if they allow the whole Internet in except this one

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:

I just want to be -- I just want to

Yes, sir.
Could it voluntarily do exactly what

the statute tells it it must do?
MR. SMITH:

Our position is that that would

18

trigger strict scrutiny that they would then have to

19

satisfy and --

20
21
22

QUESTION:

Well, and how would the strict

scrutiny come out?
MR. SMITH:

Excuse me?

Well, in -- in most, if

23

not all, cases it would come out against it.

It would be

24

unconstitutional, clearly, because they're blocking a vast

25

amount of speech that is not even sexually explicit.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

so we have a narrow tailoring problem.

The library -- I'm sorry.

Please go ahead.

14
15

Exactly, Your Honor.

I appreciate it, Your Honor.

Okay.

One last question before you

get to the second one.
What if the library said, we're not letting in
the whole Internet?

We think there are some sites that it

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

would be valuable for our research patrons to have.

2

going to -- we're simply going to select 100 websites or

1,000 out of the millions that are there and we're going

to let them in.

Would that be a violation of designated

6

MR. SMITH:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. SMITH:

9

We're

Clearly not, Your Honor.
Okay.
There's no -- there's no argument

that we -- we'd make that that would be unconstitutional.

10

They would then be letting them in as they would books,

11

using their collection development policies, deciding

12

what's valuable, and that would not be a violation.
QUESTION:

13

But -- but how did -- I mean, it's

14

fine to say it's no violation of the Constitution.

15

you're also saying yet it remains a designated public

16

forum.

17

MR. SMITH:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

No, Your Honor.
Oh, it -- you agree it would not be a

designated public forum.
MR. SMITH:

Absolutely not.

If they're not

21

letting everybody in, as -- as general access.

22

exercising selective access.

23
24

But

QUESTION:

They're

But don't -- don't many libraries

already exclude, for example, chat rooms?
MR. SMITH:

It's not a question of exclusion.

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

It's a question of affirmative inclusion through

2

selection --

3

QUESTION:

No, no.

I mean, but -- but my

4

understanding was that some libraries that -- that have

5

access to the Web do not allow access to chat rooms.

6

don't think that that's a proper library -- library

7

function or whatever.

8

assume you would acknowledge that there's no designated

9

public forum.

10

MR. SMITH:

At least as to those libraries, I

No, Your Honor.

11

acknowledge that excluding --

QUESTION:

13

MR. SMITH:

I didn't think you would.
-- excluding an area of content can

take it out of the forum doctrine.
Let me get to my second point, though, which -which is -QUESTION:

When you start on your second point,

18

let me just ask you to comment on one thing because I want

19

to be -- I want the Solicitor General also to comment on

20

the same thing.

21

record now, if we agreed with the Government's submission

22

that the district court's rationale was wrong, would it be

23

proper for us to decide to rule on the second theory?

24
25

Do you think, given the state of the

MR. SMITH:

Oh, clearly, Your Honor.

I don't

think there are any -- any facts that it would be

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

necessary for the Court that haven't been brought out in

2

that -- that trial and that lengthy opinion.
Now, our position with respect to point two

3
4

is --

5

QUESTION:

What is point two?

6

MR. SMITH:

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. SMITH:

It is that libraries --

-- even -- even if the Internet is

9

precisely analogous to books in the library context, that

10

something about the library context lets librarians in the

11

exercise of professional judgment that they ordinarily

12

exercise, even in deciding to edit the Internet, that the

13

Federal Government under the First Amendment has no

14

business using the spending power to try to distort that

15

medium and push librarians away from their professional

16

judgment toward the most restrictive possible policy on

17

information flow into the library setting.

18

In other words, our second point is that a

19

library is very much like a public university which this

20

Court has several times indicated is a -- is a special

21

sphere set off for the governmental promotion of private

22

and free expression, that in that kind of a setting, the

23

Federal Government should not use the spending power to

24

impose a one-size-fits-all policy about --

25

QUESTION:

Is this a federalism concept and you

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

-- and you would cite our cases like Printz and so forth?
MR. SMITH:

No, Your Honor.

I'm citing only

3

First Amendment cases.

4

concept that there are certain kinds of relationships or

5

certain kinds of institutions in which the amount of

6

speech that is being allowed is decided by the people who

7

are designated as professionals to run that institution.

8

For example --

9

QUESTION:

I believe it is a First Amendment

So -- so your argument would be the

10

same if the -- if the State of California were doing it.

11

It's not just the Federal Government.

12

MR. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor.

13

If it was done by statute.

But -- but, for

14

example, professors should set the curriculum at a public

15

university.

16

the universities of this country, we've given you money,

17

you therefore have to cut your departments.

18

you take the money --

I don't think that the Congress can say to

19

QUESTION:

20

set the curriculum?

21

MR. SMITH:

If you -- if

How about -- can the board of regents

I think it -- when you get to the

22

people who run the -- run the university as their job,

23

that's fine, yes, Your Honor.

24

QUESTION:

25

I mean, that's pretty far-reaching.

It's very interesting.

But the -- the question -- I'm --

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

I don't suppose you object to the Federal Government

2

saying, even if it's money to be spent on books, you

3

cannot spend this money for material that it is unlawful

4

for the student to see, such as child pornography.

5

you objecting to that?

6

were to say, no child pornography.

7

MR. SMITH:

8

QUESTION:

9

Are

Suppose the Federal Government

Certainly not, Your Honor.
Certainly not, okay.

So then what

you're objecting to is we let them cut that stuff out, but

10

you're objecting to the requirement of a particular

11

technology where the technology may exclude some other

12

things.

13

MR. SMITH:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SMITH:

Well -That's your objection.
-- first of all, let me address the

16

book question.

17

applied to the book context, a law where the Government

18

says we're going to help you buy books.

19

of your book budget a year, and it doesn't just say you

20

can't spend our money on books of a particular content.

21

It says you can't have in your library books of a

22

particular content.

23

professional judgments of librarians about what books

24

would need to be to their patrons.

25

What this law is analogous to is, as

Here's 10 percent

It starts to try to invade the

And we have here a situation where 93 percent of

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the libraries have made a more liberal, more open policy

2

decision than the one that the Congress favors, and

3

they're now using the spending power to push them in --

4

QUESTION:

Well, what if -- what if the Federal

5

Government said, we're going to give you 10 percent of

6

your annual appropriation and you can't use that money to

7

acquire a particular class of books?

8
9
10
11

MR. SMITH:

I think as long as it was viewpoint

neutral, Your Honor, and otherwise a legitimate line, that
would be not a problem.
QUESTION:

But -- but here --

Well, supposing you -- you can't use

12

it to acquire soft pornography.

13

MR. SMITH:

To the extent one could define that

14

concept, I think that generally the Government -- the

15

Court has said the Government can decide what -- what the

16

money that it uses to subsidize the -- the local

17

government with -- what it will be spent on, but it can't,

18

I think, then expand the subsidy into attempting to

19

regulate things like the other book decisions that the

20

library might make.

21

QUESTION:

Well, even in areas where it's

22

already against the law to have materials that are obscene

23

or harmful to minors?

24

authority to prohibit its aid to be used for that?

25

MR. SMITH:

You think the Government has no

Of course not, Your Honor.

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Certainly the Government can say that you shouldn't make

2

available materials to people that -- that -- for whom

3

they have no constitutional right to see them, obscenity

4

for adults --

5

QUESTION:

Right.

Now, should we make any

6

allowance here?

7

because the technology is not yet available to filter

8

perfectly where it's evident that there isn't a huge

9

percentage amount of things that are being excluded, but

10

Is there any leeway, if you will, simply

the software isn't perfect?

11

MR. SMITH:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

Well -Should -- should our doctrine take

that into account, do you suppose?
MR. SMITH:

If -- if I might, just in answer to

15

that question, Your Honor, take a moment to describe what

16

-- what it really is that the record shows about how these

17

filters operate because I -- I think that that's really

18

very helpful.

19

What these -- these filters are, are lists of --

20

of sites that are banned for access in the -- in the

21

setting where they're -- where they're in effect, and the

22

-- the findings are that there's about 100,000 sexually

23

explicit sites on the Internet at the time of trial.

24

so we can assume that some high percentage of that 100,000

25

are on the list, 90,000 perhaps, because there were some

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

And

1

that they missed constantly.

2

Now, in addition, the court found that the --

3

the very same list blocks at least tens of thousands of

4

additional sites that are not sexually explicit at all or,

5

if they have sexually explicit materials, are educational.

6

They -- they teach people about gay sexuality or they

7

teach them about safe sex techniques.

8

on these lists is a proportion, a huge proportion, perhaps

9

25, perhaps 50 percent of the sites that are blocked that

10
11

And so we have --

are not illegal even for children.
Now, of the 90,000 or so that are blocked that

12

are sexually explicit, there isn't a shred of evidence in

13

this trial record that the Government attempted to put in

14

about whether any of those are obscene.

15

showing of any kind that the filters ever actually find

16

speech that is illegal for adults.

17

reason to think that there isn't a lot of it on there

18

because clearly illegal material is distributed in a

19

different way than the -- than the way that would allow

20

the filtering --

There was no

And there's good

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. SMITH:

Mr. Smith, you used -- you said
This -- and General Olson said tens

Well --- in relation to the Internet.

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

In this record, at least in this opinion, this

2

was the finding made more often than any other by that

3

three-judge court, but every time they used the word

4

substantial -- and they don't give us any 50 percent.

5

Substantial over-blocking is the word that's come up over

6

and over again.

7

a dozen findings.

8
9

I think you must have said it in at least

MR. SMITH:
that, Your Honor.

If I could -- if I could address

The -- the court did say at least tens

10

of thousands and they used the word pages at that point.

11

But it's quite evident, if you look at the way they were

12

reasoning from the evidence, that they meant sites.

13

the evidence is that there's about 11 million websites on

14

the Internet, in -- in the accessible part of the Internet

15

and that 100,000 of those are the sexually explicit ones

16

and that the -- there are at least tens of thousands more

17

that are on the list.

18

And

So it's -- the Government also says in their

19

brief that about one percent of the Internet is over-

20

blocked, which would be about 100,000 sites.

21

So it is a substantial percentage.

It is also a

22

substantial amount.

23

large percentage of what they're blocking is not what they

24

intend to block.

25

QUESTION:

And most importantly, it's a very

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Oh, you mean the Government --

2

QUESTION:

-- can I ask you a question about --

3

about the public forum doctrine?

As I understood your

4

earlier answer, the Internet is not a public forum if a

5

library does not take all of it and chooses to exclude

6

chat boxes.

7

MR. SMITH:

No, that is not my answer.

8

QUESTION:

Oh, that isn't your answer.

9

MR. SMITH:

10

QUESTION:

No.

Our answer is --

It -- it remains a designated public

11

forum even if you don't take all of it, you say.

12

rooms.

We don't want them.
MR. SMITH:

13

Chat

The way for it not to be a public

14

forum is for them to decide affirmatively what they do

15

want to include, not simply to say we'll take the -- the

16

content of 400 million people contributing to the

17

Internet, but we'll carve out one thing.

18

that, then there is no designated public forum doctrine,

19

and the Court has repeatedly said the distinction between

20

a public forum and not is whether or not there's been

21

selective access, which -- by which it means case by

22

case --

23

QUESTION:

If you allow

Why isn't that selective access?

MR. SMITH:

Maybe chat rooms are okay because

the question is whether that's a content-based exclusion.

But clearly, here you have a content-based exclusion.

No.

Okay.

It's not a content-based --

9

It isn't content-based.

And it -Now, so if they say no chat rooms, it

doesn't become a designated public forum.
Why does it remain a designated public forum if

11

what they say is, in addition to chat rooms, we don't want

13

into our computers obscenity, child pornography, material

The fact that they may -- may or may

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

6

MR. OLSON:

Thank you, Mr. Smith.

I would like to invite the Court's

7

attention to page 37a of the appendix to the

8

jurisdictional statement which is the decision of the

9

court below.

In the first full paragraph, the court found

10

approximately 95 percent of libraries with public Internet

11

access have some form of acceptable use policy or Internet

12

use policy governing patrons' use of the Internet.

13

Now, what the libraries are saying here is the

14

exercise of certain discretion violates the First

15

Amendment rights of their patrons, and therefore every

16

time they exercise that type of discretion in this

17

context, they're subject to strict scrutiny.

18

What this statute does is gives the libraries

19

the right, if they choose to accept Federal funds, to make

20

what kind of decisions, to exclude pornography which

21

there's no dispute in the record libraries have, from time

22

immemorial, chosen not to put in their libraries.

23

decision that they're making is the same one they have

24

already voluntarily made over the years.

25

So the

It would inhibit their decisions to exclude

things that this part of the court below's decision held

3

that they are doing already.

4

discretion that libraries have exercised with respect to

5

whether they be -- want to be a fiction library or a

6

library that's specializing in this or that or technology

7

or anything along those lines.

Amendment rights are the types of discretion precisely

10

It's the traditional type of

General Olson, I hate to use part of

I -- we have no problem if the Court

18

decides it, although it wasn't briefed and it wasn't the

19

decision below, but we don't think it's remotely possible

20

for this Court to decide that question in this context

21

against the Government.

22

they're saying they don't have a First -- they can't have

23

it both ways.

2

that is an unconstitutional -- or giving us an incentive

3

to make that very decision is an unconstitutional

4

condition.

5

This is a condition that's connected with

6

libraries' traditional decisions.

It's in an area where

governmental interest already.
