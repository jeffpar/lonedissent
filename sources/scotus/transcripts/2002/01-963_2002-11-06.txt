ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In 1997, this Court recognized that there is an

12

asbestos litigation crisis confronting the Nation, and

13

nothing in the last five years has -- done anything other

14

than to show that that crisis is more acute now than at

15

any other time in our history.

16

report just two months ago concluded that there are now

17

6,000 defendants confronted with asbestos litigation

18

claims, that the estimated value of those claims in

19

litigation costs exceeds $200 billion.

20

The Rand Corporation in a

The six plaintiffs who are involved in this

21

case, the respondents here today, are emblematic of at

22

least a fundamental element of the problem that confronts

23

asbestos litigation.

24

in some instances more than a million dollars in

25

compensatory damages for claims of asbestosis.

Each of them received close to, and

The basis

4

1

for their claim, the primary basis for their claim was

2

that they confronted a fear of cancer.

3

Asbestosis does not convert into cancer --

4

QUESTION:

How do we know that?

I mean, I

5

notice that the awards there seem to grow with age, and

6

they don't seem to vary depending upon smoking.

7

they're inversely related to age, they don't seem to be

8

affected by smoking, and that suggested to me that maybe

9

it didn't play a major part, this fear of cancer.

10

I mean,

How do

we know that it played a major part?
MR. PHILLIPS:

11

Well, there is a legal answer and

12

there is a factual answer.

13

have to assume it because the jury was instructed to

14

include it as an element, and under West Virginia law, it

15

is absolutely settled and respondents don't contest it.
QUESTION:

16

The legal answer is that you

Well, but that, the fact that it's

17

one element doesn't mean it's the primary element, does

18

it?

19

of the asbestosis itself, did they not?

They did all suffer physical impairment as a result

MR. PHILLIPS:

20
21

They all suffered asbestosis, and

they all suffered some physical elements of it.
QUESTION:

22

And how do you know that the physical

23

impairment was not the primary ingredient in the jury

24

verdict.

25

I don't understand that.
MR. PHILLIPS:

I don't know that it's not the

5

1

primary ingredient, Justice Stevens.

2

that as a matter of law, you can't ignore the fact that

3

the -- that fear of cancer was put before the jury as a

4

significant component of the plaintiff's case in chief,

5

that the jury was instructed to include that, and that -QUESTION:

6

What I do know is

Yes, but you said it was the primary

7

element of damages, and that's what I think Justice Breyer

8

and I are wondering whether the record really

9

supports that element -MR. PHILLIPS:

10

Well, I think the record supports

11

it in the sense that we know that these are asbestosis

12

claims that even the respondents' expert testified were

13

mild, for the most part.

14

that, but these are still relatively mild asbestosis

15

claims, and mild asbestosis claims do not typically

16

generate million-dollar damages awards --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

19

One or two differences about

Did the defendant --- particularly where there's no

cost of medical care as part of the component.
QUESTION:

20

Mr. Phillips, did the defendant

21

attempt to test this by seeking a special verdict so that

22

the damages could be broken down by the jury?

23

general verdict, so we don't know how much they gave for

24

anything.

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

This was a

No, the defendants didn't -- the

6

1

defendant did not ask for that.

2

QUESTION:

But it could have --

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

What the defendant did ask for,

4

Justice Ginsburg, was to have fear-of damages eliminated

5

as a component of the case in a case like this -QUESTION:

6

But they could have -- if they tested

7

this, isolated this, and then we'd know how much was

8

actually allocated, whether it was as he initially said

9

the primary, or whether it was a lesser thing.

10

We just

don't know.
MR. PHILLIPS:

11

Oh, and that's because it's the

12

plaintiff's burden.

13

they didn't want to take the risk of a general verdict

14

being set aside because there's an element of damages

15

that's included that the court ultimately decides should

16

be excluded as a matter of law, they then bear the risk

17

and the burden of having the case sent back for a new

18

trial.

19

QUESTION:

If they didn't want to have -- if

Oh, but the relevance of this, I

20

think your overall point, in my mind, is that the other

21

side would say, I think they do say that this is a case in

22

which there was an impact, and as a result of the

23

impact -- the thickening of the lungs -- the person does

24

have a fear of getting cancer greater than most people,

25

that that's -- entitles them under traditional law to some

7

1

damages, and where you can get a special verdict, it's

2

easy to see, if the jury has awarded too much damage for

3

that, in which case you get a reversal under -- you get a

4

reversal if they give too much for it, and -- so what's

5

the problem here that has anything to do with there being

6

6,000 plaintiffs and enormous damage and problems overall?

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, the problem's easy to

8

identify, that is that if the instruction is that everyone

9

who suffers a diagnosed case of asbestosis is entitled to

10

go to the jury on fear of cancer claims, then the amount

11

of damages that will be generated as a consequence of that

12

will run completely out of sync --

13

QUESTION:

Why?

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

15

QUESTION:

-- with the damages that --

Why would it?

Why -- maybe they're

16

entitled to some fear.

17

world has a 1 in 4 chance of dying in cancer.

18

who's subjected to asbestos may have a 1 in 3 chance.

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

20

QUESTION:

21
22

A person who has no problem in the
A person

But this Court --

That gives them entitlement to some

little amount, anyway.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Breyer, you said, or the

23

Court said in Buckley that you don't analyze these issues

24

case by case.

25

about the category of cases that's based on the policies

What you have to do is make a judgment

8

1

of the Federal Employers Liability Act, and the policy -QUESTION:

2

Mr. Phillips, under West Virginia

3

practice, is it -- if a plaintiff or a defendant requests

4

a special verdict, is it automatically allowed, or is it

5

in the discretion of the trial court?
MR. PHILLIPS:

6

It's in the discretion of the

7

trial court, and it is also clear under West Virginia law

8

that if two theories are put before the jury with respect

9

to damages and one of them is impermissible, the answer is

10

you strike down and you get a new trial on damages, so

11

that's -- that's clear.

12

respondents as arguing anything to the contrary.
QUESTION:

13

And I don't -- I don't hear the

Mr. Phillips, do we look at this case

14

as one of a claim for traditional pain and suffering

15

damages?

16

Is that how we should view it?
MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

This Court said in Gottshall

17

that pain and suffering damages are describable as

18

sensations stemming directly from a physical injury or

19

condition.

20

The physical injury that -- that's identified

21

here is asbestosis, and to be sure, the pain and suffering

22

that an asbestotic would be allowed to recover for might

23

be a fear of shortness of breath or other symptoms that

24

arise out of asbestosis, but the notion that cancer that

25

doesn't exist currently, may never take place, stems from

9

1

the existence of asbestosis is not a fair application of

2

that rule of law, particularly when there is no evidence,

3

and again, I don't think respondents challenge this, that

4

asbestosis does not cause cancer, it does not lead to

5

cancer.
QUESTION:

6

But, it sounds like you want us to

7

say there is some limitation on the availability of pain

8

and suffering damages in the context of an asbestosis

9

case.

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

11

QUESTION:

All -- Not --

It would be something different than

12

one would think of in a traditional pain and suffering

13

case, wouldn't it?
MR. PHILLIPS:

14

Well, I think it's the

15

respondents who are asking you to do something different

16

with a pain and suffering case, and actually I'm not even

17

sure that's a fair way to characterize the respondents'

18

argument.

19

is a classic pain and suffering --

20
21
22

I don't understand them to be arguing that this

QUESTION:

Well, I'm trying to find out what

you're arguing.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, and my argument is, this

23

is not under any circumstances the kind of pain and

24

suffering that we traditionally think of.

25

something that emanates directly out of the existing

It's not

10

1

injury.

Second, it's not negligent infliction of

2

emotional distress, and it's not emotional injury as a

3

component of a negligence claim.
QUESTION:

4

Well, what was it -- was the case

5

presented as a separate claim for negligently-caused

6

emotional distress?

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

argument.

No.

No.

It was --

It was a pain and suffering

That's what it was, wasn't it?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, it wasn't clear exactly

11

what it was until the jury -- until we got to the jury

12

instructions.

13

view these as pain and suffering.

At that point, the trial judge did say, I

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

As pain and suffering.
Yes.

I mean, I thought that's what we were

confronting here.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, except that the traditional

19

standard for pain and suffering doesn't permit the kind of

20

disconnect between the fear of cancer that you're talking

21

about here and asbestosis.

22

and suffering as sensations that emanate directly from the

23

injury itself, and fear of cancer doesn't emanate at all

24

from asbestosis.

25

QUESTION:

You normally associate pain

But it can include fright.

11

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

4

QUESTION:

Fright from asbestosis --

Yes.
-- to be sure.

Is it conceded -- I think you said it

5

was conceded, but is it conceded that fear of cancer does

6

not emanate from asbestosis?

7

a greater risk of cancer if you have contracted

8

asbestosis, why isn't the fear connected to the

9

asbestosis?

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

If it's clear that you have

Well, it's interesting, you know,

11

the testimony itself was simply, do you have a fear

12

because of exposure to asbestos now that you have

13

asbestosis.

14

fear arises out of the asbestosis.

15
16
17

They didn't even ask the question whether the

QUESTION:

Did you ask questions about the

causation theory that you're now espousing?
MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

Our argument, Justice

18

Souter, was that fear of cancer is too unrelated, as a

19

matter of law, to be an element of pain and suffering.

20

QUESTION:

Okay, but I take it your argument is

21

that the mere fact that there is an association between

22

asbestosis and a higher risk of developing cancer,

23

depending on whether you smoke and so on, is not enough of

24

an association to support a -- in effect, a separate

25

element of damages for fear of cancer?

12

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

2

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

What is your authority for that?

In

3

other words, you're saying there's got to be some kind of

4

a different, or more intense causal relationship than

5

simply this association that can statistically be shown.

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think --

What's the basis for that?
Buckley, frankly, is as close to

9

anything on that score, because Buckley says even if you

10

accept as an article of faith, as I think the Court did,

11

that each of those individuals who'd been exposed to

12

asbestos felt that he or she would be more seriously at

13

risk -Did they have asbestosis?

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

18

QUESTION:

No, none of the --

No -No.

-- they didn't, and the point here

19

is that there is proof of asbestosis, and there is a

20

statistical showing that you don't deny, I think, of a

21

higher degree of risk, what -- however the causal chain

22

works -- which associates asbestosis with fear of cancer,

23

so this is not a Buckley situation, and my question is,

24

why isn't that statistical association sufficient to

25

ground an instruction allowing for compensation for fear

13

1

that results from this association?
MR. PHILLIPS:

2

There are two answers to that,

3

Justice Souter.

In the first place, the -- there is no

4

strong common law doctrine that says that those -- that

5

that kind of a disconnect between the damages is a core

6

element of what the common law routinely grants for --

7

QUESTION:

8

calls it a connect.

9

undenied statistical association between asbestosis and a

10

Well, you call it disconnect, he
What it is, there is, I take it, an

probability of developing cancer --

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

12

QUESTION:

Right.

-- and that's the basis for the claim

13

of the fear.

Why is that inconsistent with a common law

14

theory of pain and suffering damages?
MR. PHILLIPS:

15

Well, the core of the pain and

16

suffering -- the pain and suffering theory is that it is a

17

fright that emanates directly out of the particular

18

condition you have, which is asbestosis.
QUESTION:

19

All right, if you want to use that

20

kind of terminology, I don't see why you haven't got it

21

here.

22

got asbestosis, and people with asbestosis have a higher

23

chance of developing cancer.

24

your terms?

25

The reason these people are worried is that they've

MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

Isn't that enough out of, in

Even if you accept that

14

1

premise, Justice Souter, you still have to confront the

2

overall policies of the Federal Employers Liability Act,

3

and the question of whether not allowing a recovery that

4

might otherwise be legitimate -- and that is precisely

5

what the Court said --

6

QUESTION:

So, are you saying that even if the

7

common law allowed it, we should not allow it under the

8

act, or the act doesn't allow it?

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

10

law clearly allows it.

11

QUESTION:

12

that proposition --

Okay.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

Well, I don't think the common

Have you got any authority for

No, because --

-- that an association between these

two conditions is insufficient to support a damage award?
MR. PHILLIPS:

There are lower court -- we cite

17

the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decisions, the Eleventh

18

Circuit decisions -- there are decisions out there that

19

have said we're not going to allow fear of cancer in cases

20

involving asbestosis, but I --

21

QUESTION:

Well, there does appear to be a

22

minority of jurisdictions that have said -- and have

23

held -- that you have to show as a plaintiff in a case

24

like this a verifiable causal nexus between cancer and the

25

injury suffered in cases where you're dealing with

15

1

exposure to a hazardous material.

That -- maybe that's a

2

reasonable requirement, but it appears to be a minority

3

view.

Are you suggesting that we should adopt that here?
MR. PHILLIPS:

4

Well, I'm not asking you to -- I

5

don't think the answer to this case resides in the common

6

law, because I think the common law is essentially a

7

muddle.

QUESTION:

8
9
10

to be some verifiable causal nexus?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Absolutely, Justice O'Connor, and

the reason to do that -QUESTION:

13
14

Well, are you -- do you think we

should adopt an interpretation of FELA that says there has

11
12

There are cases on both sides.

Do you acknowledge that that is a

view that is generally a minority view in the country?
MR. PHILLIPS:

15

I -- I -- I'll concede that it is

16

a minority view in the sense that there are maybe five

17

cases on one side --

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

20

Yes.
-- and three or four on the

other.

21

QUESTION:

Yes.

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

This is not an area that's been

23

litigated sufficiently to be able to say where the trends

24

are.

25

QUESTION:

It may make sense, but I just want to

16

1

know where we are here.

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

Well, I've only got two

3

or three cases that identify it in the context -- the way

4

you just did, Justice O'Connor, and my colleague on the

5

other side will identify four or five cases that don't

6

impose that requirement, but what remains absolutely

7

critical in the analysis of this case, I think, is the

8

core policy that this Court identified in Gottshall and in

9

Buckley that says if you don't have a clear answer from

10

the common law, you have to look to see whether or not

11

this particular damages remedy creates the possibility of

12

unpredictable and unlimited damages, and that's the reason

13

why the Court needs to adopt a more restrictive view of

14

the standard to be applied under the Federal Employers

15

Liability Act.

16

That may not be the rule that would be required

17

as a matter of common law in any particular State, but

18

under FELA, the notion that you're going to create

19

unlimited liability in circumstances in which the

20

plaintiffs are allowed significantly reduced requirements

21

in order to prove the basis for their claim suggests that

22

this Court has consistently taken the position that it

23

must cut back and not allow on a category basis -- on a

24

categorical basis -- not allow damages to extend to --

25

QUESTION:

But what -- I mean, what -- unlimited

17

1

damages, I don't know what you want us to do.

2

statistical chance of your getting cancer if you have

3

asbestosis is -- is your chances are doubled.

4

be enough to create the kind of a fear that we could allow

5

damages for it?

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

QUESTION:

10

13
14
15

Would that

No, I don't think so --

I see.
-- Justice Scalia.

What if it's 90 percent certain that

if you have developed asbestosis, you will develop cancer?
MR. PHILLIPS:

11
12

What if the

case.

I think that would be a different

I think once you get past more likely than not -QUESTION:

Okay, so it's somewhere between 50

and 90 percent?
MR. PHILLIPS:

I think when you get past more

16

likely than not that you will incur cancer, there is a

17

risk, then at that point -- but remember, the flip side of

18

this is the two-disease rule, and that's an important

19

element in how the Court ought to analyze this problem,

20

because not only -- by allowing fear of cancer damages

21

now, you essentially say to the world, the sky is the

22

limit, inconsistent with what the Court said in Gottshall

23

and Buckley.

24
25

The flip side is, if you don't allow the fear of
cancer damages now, but allow fear of -- but allow the

18

1

plaintiff to come back after he or she contracts cancer

2

and allows as a part of that recovery for fear of cancer,

3

then the people who are most seriously injured are made

4

whole at the appropriate time in the appropriate

5

circumstances.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, I know your light is

7

on, but there's a second question and you haven't even

8

talked about it, the joint and several liability --

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

12

QUESTION:

The apportionment.

-- the apportionment.
Thank you, Justice O'Connor.

And I wasn't sure that there was any

13

support in the statute or in the evidence at trial here

14

for how some apportionment should have been made.

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, the quick answer on

16

apportionment is that in 1908, it was absolutely clear

17

there was several liability.

18

injuries you cause.

19

statutory language that says that the railroad is

20

responsible for the injuries while employed.

21

language has been interpreted as recognizing we only pay

22

for the things that we cause.

You're only liable for the

That's embodied, I think, in the

23

The Third Restatement --

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

That

Cause in whole or in part?
But that goes to the question of

19

1

what you need to show a jury in order to get a negligence

2

claim to the jury in the first instance.

3

you're -- you're liable for the entirety of the damages in

4

whole or in part.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

It doesn't say

It could be read to say that.
It could, but I don't think

7

that's the most natural reading of that particular

8

language, and I don't think it's an appropriate one where

9

the policies in 1908, and the policies of the law under

10

the Third Restatement quite clearly say that you should

11

apportion, because that is the fair way in order to ensure

12

that a defendant is not -- does not -- is not forced to

13

overcompensate.

14

QUESTION:

It's really a question of who should

15

bear the burden of bringing in those other people.

16

it's joint and several, you could join other people.

17

your view, you say to the plaintiff, "Unless, plaintiff,

18

you bring in all these other people, you can only get a

19

small piece from any particular one."

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

If
On

Right, and I think the statute

21

and the existing common law clearly suggest that the right

22

answer is that because you've reduced the burden of the

23

plaintiff in order to get into court and to be able to

24

make a case, the quid pro quo for that ought to be that

25

you only hold the railroad liable for the amount of the

20

1

injury it caused, and here it is not contested that -- and

2

Mr. Butler's case is the prototype example of it -- he had

3

three months of exposure when he was with Norfolk &

4

Western, he had 30 years of exposure with others.

5

a reasonable basis on which to apportion for cause, and

6

that -- and no one has contested that.

7

I'd reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Salmons, we'll hear from you.

That is

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS

11

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

12

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

13
14
15

MR. SALMONS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Respondents may not recover damages under FELA

16

for their anxiety about developing cancer in the future as

17

part of their emotional injuries from the separate disease

18

of asbestosis.

19

have considered the relationship between asbestosis and

20

cancer have concluded that they are separate diseases that

21

result in separate injuries to the plaintiff --

The overwhelming majority of courts that

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. SALMONS:

24

QUESTION:

25

May I ask in that --- and give rise to separate --

May I ask this question?

I really

wanted to ask it of Mr. Phillips, but his time was running

21

1

out.

2

the asbestosis actually is a cause of cancer, as opposed

3

to a case like this, in which asbestos and cancer --

4

asbestosis and cancer -- are the result of a common cause?

5

Would you draw a distinction between a case in which

MR. SALMONS:

Your Honor, I do think there would

6

be a difference between those two instances.

Here, the

7

Court can look to the evolving tort law principles in

8

cases involving asbestos, where the overwhelming majority

9

of courts have concluded they are, indeed, separate

10

diseases with no causal connection between them only in

11

the sense that they both stem from the same exposure --

12

QUESTION:

-- that in this

13

MR. SALMONS:

14

QUESTION:

-- to asbestos.

that in this case, then, if it were

15

true, which I understand it is not, that the asbestosis

16

itself is a contributing cause to cancer, that then there

17

would be liability?

18

MR. SALMONS:

Well, Your Honor, I think that --

19

you know -- the Court may still need to look at what

20

type -- what exactly the causal connection is -- and it

21

would still need to take into account both the text and

22

the purposes of FELA, and -- and in particular, the

23

concern --

24
25

QUESTION:

But taking all those things into

account, what do you do in a case in which the cancer is a

22

1

result of the asbestosis rather than the result of a

2

common source?

3

MR. SALMONS:

I -- I do think, Your Honor, that

4

if -- that if the cancer, in fact, results directly from

5

the disease of asbestosis, then that puts you more

6

directly in the category of pain and suffering damages

7

that would be available traditionally in tort law, and

8

that probably would be recoverable there, but --

9

QUESTION:

Why --

10

QUESTION:

Isn't that a jury question?

11
12

Do we

know for sure that the one does not lead to the other?
MR. SALMONS:

I do think, Your Honor, that this

13

Court can look to the experience of courts that have

14

considered the relationship between the two diseases, and

15

have adopted legal rules to govern the disposition of

16

these claims, and have concluded that they are separate

17

diseases that result in separate injuries and give rise to

18

separate causes of action, and I think this Court can look

19

to that and -- and -- and can conclude that as a matter of

20

law both because of --

21

QUESTION:

22

that factual point?

23
24
25

Do the respondents agree with you on

MR. SALMONS:

That the majority of courts have

concluded -QUESTION:

No -- no, that -- that asbestosis

23

1

does not lead to cancer, but rather, is -- is produced by

2

the same -- by the same cause that produces cancer?
MR. SALMONS:

3

Your Honor, I do think that the

4

respondents have taken that position in this case.

On

5

page 20 of their brief, they say that the relationship

6

between asbestosis and cancer is two-fold.
First, the asbestosis confirms the extent and

7
8

severity of the initial exposure to asbestos which, of

9

course, under Buckley is not a separate injury or impact

10

that can give rise to liability under FELA, and second,

11

that they both -- both the cancer and the asbestosis would

12

result from the same negligent conduct of the defendant,

13

but I do not read respondents to be alleging in this Court

14

that there is any causal relationship between cancer and

15

asbestosis in terms of asbestosis actually turning into

16

cancer.
There may be a correlation, but you know,

17
18

that -- the reasonableness of the fears is really not the

19

question.

20

QUESTION:

The question I had is, if there is a

21

causal correlation, if 50 percent of the people who have

22

contracted asbestosis as a result of exposure to asbestos

23

will also contract cancer, why does that matter?

24

what I didn't quite see.

25

MR. SALMONS:

I -- I think --

That's

24

1

QUESTION:

Because I understand -- I think you

2

do correctly state their -- they agree with you on the

3

facts on this.
MR. SALMONS:

4

Yes, Your Honor.

I think that in

5

terms of -- of the existing tort law principles that, as

6

this Court noted in Gottshall, and even prior to that

7

around the time of the enactment of FELA, that pain and

8

suffering damages are limited to those damages that flow

9

directly from the injury that allows you to sue, and

10
11

that -QUESTION:

But both of those cases were a self-

12

standing claim of emotional distress.

13

any existing injuries.

14

It wasn't pinned to

Here, the difference, and at least as portrayed

15

by the judge who made it part of pain and suffering, is

16

you do have an injury, you have the asbestosis, and one of

17

the elements of damages is pain and suffering, and this is

18

included in pain and suffering.

19

the judge saw it, as distinguished from Buckley and

20

Gottshall, which were self-standing claims of emotional

21

distress not tied to any preexisting injury.

22

MR. SALMONS:

At least that's the way

Yes, Your Honor, that is the way

23

the court below approached the question.

We think the

24

problem with that is that, as the overwhelming majority of

25

courts that have considered the issue of the relationship

25

1

between the diseases have concluded, they are separate

2

diseases that result in separate injuries and separate

3

causes of action, and the test of FELA -QUESTION:

4

But doesn't it matter what form --

5

I'm familiar with one of those cases, and that was the

6

question --

7

MR. SALMONS:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes, Your Honor.

-- when does the statute of

limitations start to run when you get the virulent form of

10

cancer?

11

because that should have tipped you off and you should

12

have sued then?

13

Does it begin to run when you got the asbestosis,

The answer in that context, and there are many

14

courts that say that cancer is a separate claim, is not

15

necessarily what it should be in this context.

16

MR. SALMONS:

We do think it is instructive,

17

however, Your Honor, and that's particularly true because

18

FELA provides for liability -- to any person suffering

19

injury while employed -- for such injury, and we think,

20

consistent with the text of that statute, which limits the

21

employer's liability to the injury that's actually

22

suffered, and not the fear of suffering a future -- injury

23

in the future -- that the rule we are propounding today is

24

the most consistent with that text and the most consistent

25

with the purposes and -- and policy considerations this

26

1

Court articulated in both Gottshall and Buckley, and in

2

particular -QUESTION:

3

You did say -- you said in your brief

4

that it's a question of not whether, but when, because

5

when you get cancer, if you get cancer, you get the

6

damages for past, present, and future pain and suffering,

7

but that's not quite right, is it, because you are leaving

8

out the category of person who has asbestosis and never

9

gets cancer, which will be most of these people?

Those

10

people -- for them, it is a question of whether, not when,

11

right?

12

MR. SALMONS:

It is true, Your Honor, that

13

people who now have asbestosis and fear getting cancer in

14

the future may never get cancer.

15

overwhelming number of them won't get cancer --

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. SALMONS:

18

QUESTION:

19

collect for this alleged fear.

20

In fact, the

And then they -But --

-- they never -- they can never

MR. SALMONS:

That is true, Your Honor, and

21

that's also true for the snowmen of Metro-North that were

22

at issue in Buckley.

23

though, their fears were not reasonable.

24

court of appeals in that case had found that they were.

25

The Court -- this Court did not say,
In fact, the

What this Court said was, they didn't fit within

27

1

the common law categories that allowed recovery because

2

the exposure itself was not an impact or injury, and our

3

position is that while the asbestosis gives them an

4

ability to sue for their injuries related to that

5

asbestosis, they cannot reach back to that initial

6

exposure and recover the damages that were precluded in

7

Buckley, namely -QUESTION:

8
9

more.

But here -- here we've got something

We've got the proof that this is a serious risk,

10

and that proof consists of the fact that asbestosis has,

11

in fact, developed.

12

MR. SALMONS:

That is correct, and they can

13

recover for all of their harms related directly to that

14

asbestosis, but our position is they can't recover for

15

their fears of the future disease of cancer --

16

QUESTION:

I know that that's your position, but

17

once we cross that threshold, as we have in this case --

18

the threshold that shows that the fear is, in fact, a

19

serious one, because at least asbestosis has now

20

developed, why isn't their fear of cancer just as

21

reasonable whether that fear rests upon the fact that in

22

10 percent of asbestosis cases, the asbestosis progresses

23

to cancer -- which isn't true -- or, on the other hand, in

24

the same percentage of asbestosis cases, cancer will also

25

develop as a result of the common cause for which the

28

1
2
3
4

employer is liable?
Why is the fear any less reasonable in either of
those cases?
MR. SALMONS:

Your Honor, with respect, we don't

5

think the question is whether their fears are reasonable,

6

but their question is whether their fears are recoverable

7

at this time.

8
9
10

QUESTION:

Well, I know that, and one of the

questions we want to know in determining whether recovery
is possible is whether the fear is reasonable.

11

MR. SALMONS:

12

QUESTION:

And we do not --

One threshold test that we all agree

13

on is, the fear has at least got to be confirmed by some

14

physical manifestation.

15

Okay, we've got this here.

Once the physical manifestation is shown, why is

16

reasonable fear -- why should reasonable fear -- not be

17

enough for recovery, whether the causal connection goes

18

from asbestosis to cancer, or common cause to cancer?

19

MR. SALMONS:

Your Honor, we think that one of

20

the primary reasons why it should not be enough -- that

21

reasonableness of the fear should not be enough in and of

22

itself -- even assuming for a moment that the statistics

23

that are at -- that were in evidence here are, in fact,

24

sufficiently conclusive to draw those assumptions -- I

25

mean, I do think it's important to remember that this

29

1

Court in Buckley referred to these same types of figures

2

as being uncertain and controversial, and I think that

3

that description is probably still true here.

4

But the purposes and policies of FELA, which

5

this Court recognized in Buckley, and in particular the

6

fear that plaintiffs with relatively minor injuries now

7

will come into court being drawn by the opportunity to get

8

front-loaded, significant damages for future harms, will

9

end up frustrating the system, and will end up hurting the

10

plaintiffs that in fact develop cancer later, and I think

11

that this case implicates those policies and concerns of

12

FELA and tort law generally just as much as was the case

13

in Buckley, that the vast majority, the number of people

14

that will actually get cancer in the future is relatively

15

low, and there is a significant risk --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. LAZARUS

20

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

21
22
23

MR. LAZARUS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The only issue raised by the first question

24

presented in the cert petition is whether the trial

25

court's jury instruction correctly described the legal

30

1

standard for when a physically injured plaintiff can

2

recover for related emotional distress injury, and the

3

sufficiency of the evidence and the jury's application of

4

that legal standard to the evidence at trial is not one of

5

the questions presented in this case, and it is quite

6

clear that the --

7
8
9

QUESTION:

Well, the question presented doesn't

speak in terms of the instruction, as I read it.
MR. LAZARUS:

No, but the question poses a pure

10

question of law, and that is whether, when you have a

11

physical injury, what the relationship has to be between

12

the emotional distress and the physical injury, and our

13

argument, Your Honor, is that under traditional tort law,

14

it is not required that the emotional stress immediately

15

accompany the physical injury; that it have its own

16

physical manifestations; that it be severe.

17

Tort law, as this Court explained in the Metro-

18

North case, approaches the recovery for emotional distress

19

injury from a categorical perspective, and tort law

20

categorically distinguishes between two different

21

situations.

22

First, the situation where one has a stand-

23

alone claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress

24

where the emotional injury itself the element of the

25

offense, the injury element, and second, the so-called

31

1

parasitic damage context, where there is a threshold

2

physical injury which supplies the essential element, and

3

what many courts do is they impose very significant

4

limitations on the recovery of emotional distress in the

5

stand-alone context such as physical manifestations,

6

immediacy, and severity, but --

7
8
9
10

QUESTION:

And you say this case is not brought

on this theory?
MR. LAZARUS:

The jury instruction is reproduced

on page 573 of the joint appendix.

11

QUESTION:

Where do we -- 573?

12

MR. LAZARUS:

573 on the joint appendix, and

13

that jury instruction makes it absolutely clear that

14

respondents were entitled to recover for their reasonable

15

fear of cancer as part of their overall damages only to

16

the extent that that fear related to -- the Court's

17

words -- related to proven physical injury, and there is

18

absolutely no merit to petitioner's argument --

19
20
21
22

QUESTION:

Do some jurisdictions go further

these days and require there be a reasonable causal nexus?
MR. LAZARUS:
jurisdictions do.

There are really only two cases --

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. LAZARUS:

25

Your Honor, almost no

I thought there were a few that did.
But almost all the cases go the

other way, and the reason, Your Honor, is because --

32

1

there's some confusion in petitioner's argument here about

2

what "pain and suffering" means.

3

instruction very closely on page 573, the trial judge in

4

this case was very careful, knew exactly what he was

5

doing.

If you look at the jury

6

In the paragraph right before the "fear of

7

cancer" paragraph, he refers to the entitlement of a

8

physically injured plaintiff to recover for physical and

9

mental pain and suffering.

In the next paragraph, where

10

he refers to reasonable fear of cancer, he refers only to

11

mental pain and suffering, and this is a longstanding

12

distinction in tort law.

13

the kind of pain which is immediate and intimately

14

associated with the bodily injury.

15

QUESTION:

Physical pain and suffering is

All that is true, what you say, but I

16

felt the question was open, and the reason that I thought

17

it was open is because probably I once learned that this

18

area of the law arose out of an English case where

19

somebody is watching a coffin fall off in an accident, and

20

the rule was that you can't recover unless something hits

21

you, but what you were recovering for was the coffin, and

22

the pain and suffering that a family member would feel.

23

MR. LAZARUS:

24

QUESTION:

25

Right.

That was immediate, directly related

to the accident, and quite clearly present and measurable.

33

1

MR. LAZARUS:

2

QUESTION:

Right.

This is the kind of thing that is not

3

immediate.

It's a fear of something way in the future.

4

It is very hard to determine whether it is right or wrong,

5

and it has no causal relation to the physical thing, and

6

therefore, I thought that it's open.

7

MR. LAZARUS:

8

QUESTION:

Your Honor, it's really --

You want to say -- I'll look it up,

9

but if you were to say it's absolutely not open, I mean,

10

they have, you know, lots of briefs where they've made a

11

pretty good case it's at least open.

12

MR. LAZARUS:

13

QUESTION:

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. LAZARUS:

It's open and shut.

Oh, all right.

If one looks to the Restatement of

16

Torts, section 456, which ascribed -- well-settled, widely

17

applied, and it describes the circumstances when a

18

physically injured plaintiff can recover for related

19

emotional distress injuries.

20

includes in comment c, it expressly denies the validity of

21

their physical manifestation requirements --

22

QUESTION:

No.

It fits this case, and it

I mean, you saw their reply

23

brief, and their reply briefed that is that the underlined

24

phrase -- the italicized phrase -- or from conduct which

25

causes it, is not really what's at issue.

What's issue

34

1

are the words in that called "emotional disturbance," and

2

the question is, what kind of emotional --

3

MR. LAZARUS:

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- disturbance, and I think that

5

their argument is, which if I put numbers on it is, each

6

one of us in this room has 1 in 4 chance that we will die

7

of cancer, and the difference between us and a plaintiff

8

in this case is that he has a 1 in -- 1 in 5 -- 1 in 5 --

9

wait -- We have 1 in 5, 1 in 5 and he has 1 in 4, and what

10

they're saying is, I think, that the difference between a

11

1 in 5 chance of dying of cancer, and a difference of 1 in

12

4 chance of dying of cancer is intangible -- hard to

13

measure in anyone's psychology.

14

distinctions rational, and therefore don't open this up to

15

juries awarding large amounts of money.
MR. LAZARUS:

16

Nobody really makes such

Your Honor, one really can't in

17

the beginning start to entertain their evidence that

18

they've introduced which wasn't part of the trial record

19

in this case.

QUESTION:

20
21

The trial record -No, I don't think their evidence is

relevant.

22

MR. LAZARUS:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

Right.

I would say this is a question that's

being put to us as a matter of law.
MR. LAZARUS:

Right.

35

1
2

QUESTION:

And it is up to us to look at the

numbers.

3

MR. LAZARUS:

4

QUESTION:

Right.

And in reaching those numbers I gave

5

you, I've assumed everything in your favor.

6

really -- because you're a railroad and not the kind of

7

thing that was involved in the studies you cite -- it

8

could be a lot less than what I say, but it's not going to

9

be more.

10

MR. LAZARUS:

That is, it's

Well, actually, it may well be

11

more, but let's put that aside.

12

Honor, as this Court explained in the Metro-North case, is

13

that just because there are background risks, that doesn't

14

mean that one can't have a reasonable apprehension based

15

on an increased risk.

16

What is quite clear, Your

For instance, it is 100 percent sure, Your

17

Honor, that every one of us in this room will die.

18

have a background risk.

19

negligent conduct causes us a physical injury which

20

increases our risk of dying sooner does not mean we can

21

recover for that.

22

We

But the fact that someone through

And the place to look in the Restatement of

23

Torts, Your Honor, to see that this is a classic thing

24

that one can recover for, if you look to section 456, you

25

look to comment c, and then it referenced comment -- it

36

1

referenced Restatement section 905, and Restatement -- and

2

it says that when you have a physical injury, then it

3

triggers the whole panoply of emotional distress injuries,

4

and section 905 of the Restatement of Torts describes what

5

is encompassed by "emotional distress," and comment e

6

describes how it goes, as always, to fear, anxiety,

7

apprehension of future consequences.

8

QUESTION:

Mr. Lazarus --

9

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Lazarus, what if you put a

10

physician on the stand, and the physician says, this man

11

was 25 years old when he was injured, he ordinarily would

12

be expected to live to be 75, but as a result of this

13

injury he's only going to live to be 72?

14

sort of thing that's compensable?

15

MR. LAZARUS:

Now, is that the

Well, Your Honor, I don't know.

16

I don't know -- I don't doubt, Your Honor, that in tort

17

law, that there is a level of probability of risk below

18

which one can say as a matter of law there's not a

19

reasonable apprehension.

20

case, first of all, that there's any question that

21

statistics support a reasonable apprehension, but even

22

more importantly, the question whether they do or don't in

23

this case is not one of the issues here.

24

whether that's enough.

25

QUESTION:

I don't think, though, in this

The issue is

The issue is whether you --

Mr. Lazarus, may I ask you on that

37

1

point -- let's for a moment not think of ourselves as

2

lawyers.

3

snowman, and the person who has asbestosis, both of those

4

people may have a real fear of cancer, and we may find

5

them credible witnesses.

Here are two people, the person in Buckley, the

I thought in the Buckley situation that one

6
7

concern is, it's too easy to make this up, and for some

8

people facing that risk, they'll say, "Well, yeah, I might

9

be run over tomorrow, it doesn't bother me."

Isn't the

10

real problem that the fear of something, when that fear

11

doesn't have the physical manifestation, that these things

12

are too easy to make up, too uncontrollable, and I frankly

13

can't see the difference from the point of view of a

14

sufferer between the person in Buckley and the person

15

here.

16

The person in the Grand Central Station case

17

could say "I had the same fear that that person has.

18

hasn't proved his fear any more than I proved mine, why

19

should he recover and not me?"

20

MR. LAZARUS:

He

Well, Your Honor, because as the

21

Court, I think, explained quite well in Buckley, the way

22

tort law approaches the question is on a categorical basis

23

and distinguishes between those with physical injury,

24

because if you have that threshold physical injury, that

25

gives you the corroborating evidence you need that you

38

1

have, now, a legitimate plaintiff -- a legitimate

2

plaintiff -- who has established their cause of action.

3

You're not adding new cases to the docket, and even more

4

importantly, as the court has --

5

QUESTION:

Well, what's more legitimate -- and

6

there was no doubt about the conditions under which the

7

people worked in Grand Central Station -- that they were

8

exposed to asbestos, that they should have been told much

9

earlier about their exposure, and they must have been very

10
11

angry that they weren't told.
MR. LAZARUS:

Well, Your Honor, first of all,

12

those who have asbestosis, as the trial record in this

13

case referred, those with asbestosis have a statistically

14

higher significance of getting the other kinds of cancers,

15

because what -- it's not just a mere exposure, unimpaired,

16

and what the asbestosis requirement does by requiring that

17

kind of serious physical injury is, as everyone

18

understood, and the rail industry argued in Metro-North,

19

it dramatically limits the number of --

20

QUESTION:

Well, is there --

21

MR. LAZARUS:

22

QUESTION:

-- possible plaintiffs.

Mr. Lazarus, is their increased

23

chance of cancer because they have asbestosis, or because

24

the asbestosis originates from their exposure to asbestos,

25

and it's the exposure to asbestos, not the asbestosis,

39

1
2

that will cause cancer?
MR. LAZARUS:

Your Honor, we do not know, and no

3

one knows, whether the asbestosis itself transforms itself

4

into cancer.

5

QUESTION:

Well, I -- then you do challenge the

6

statement by your opponents that asbestosis itself cannot

7

change into cancer?

8
9

MR. LAZARUS:
experts --

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. LAZARUS:

12

QUESTION:

13

No, Your Honor, their own

Well, no, now, wait a minute -Yes.

Yes.

I --

-- I asked you a question.

What's

the answer?

14

MR. LAZARUS:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. LAZARUS:

-- I do.

I do challenge that.

You do challenge that?
Their own expert, Your Honor, on

17

page 470 of the joint appendix, Dr. Renn -- their

18

expert -- testified on page 470 that one could not

19

contract lung cancer from exposure to asbestos until one

20

had asbestosis.

21

We're willing to admit that the science is more

22

unclear that asbestos -- whether it actually transforms

23

itself or not, we don't know, and we don't think as a

24

matter of law it's necessary.

25

trial who testified that actually to get lung cancer from

It was their expert at

40

1

asbestos exposure, it was a necessary prerequisite to

2

first have asbestosis.

We think --

3

QUESTION:

Well, can I ask you one other --

4

QUESTION:

That question wasn't put to the jury.

5

I mean, the fact is that the jury was not required to find

6

that the fear was a fear that the asbestosis would turn

7

into cancer.
MR. LAZARUS:

8
9

Honor.

That's absolutely right, Your

We -- and we think that was not an error in the

10

jury instructions.

11

refer to this one case, a case they cite in their reply

12

brief on page 2 --

13

QUESTION:

There's many cases out there -- let me

Why wouldn't that be error?

I mean,

14

the instruction does say that a plaintiff who's

15

demonstrated that he's developed a reasonable fear of

16

cancer related to the proven physical injury from asbestos

17

can be compensated for the fear.

18

MR. LAZARUS:

19

Right, and it has to be related to

the proven physical injury, and it was in this case.

20

If I can give the example --

21

QUESTION:

But it's so -- in the same

22

instruction the court says, you cannot award damages for

23

cancer or any increased risk of cancer.

24
25

MR. LAZARUS:

Right, Your Honor, and that's

where the court got it actually --

41

1

QUESTION:

Which is so contradictory.

2

MR. LAZARUS:

No.

No, it's not, Your Honor.

3

What the court is doing here is exactly what courts do who

4

adopt the separate disease rule which says, you can only

5

recover for your present injuries now, and you can't

6

recover for future injuries.

7

risk, is a future injury.
QUESTION:

8
9

The cancer itself, or the

I was going to ask this.

What if one

of these -- if you prevail, and then one of these

10

plaintiffs develops cancer, I assume he can go in and sue

11

again?

12

MR. LAZARUS:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

That's right, yes, for the cancer.

All right.

Is there some kind of a

discount now for the fear that he -MR. LAZARUS:

No, no, just like there are

16

separate causes of action for assault and battery.

17

are two different injuries.

18

is a separate injury, and for these plaintiffs -- the

19

respondents -- it is a current --

20

QUESTION:

Those

The apprehension of something

So the fear that you're going to die

21

of cancer is compensable before you get it, and it's

22

compensable again after you get it?

23

MR. LAZARUS:

24

the cancer would be --

25

QUESTION:

No.

No.

The fear would not be --

Oh, I thought that the -- you can

42

1

recover for the fear in both cases under your theory.
MR. LAZARUS:

2

I -- sorry, I wasn't -- if you've

3

recovered once, you aren't going to be allowed to recover

4

again.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. LAZARUS:

7
8
9
10

So there would be a discount.
Yes.

If you'd brought the

first -QUESTION:

All right.

So then your first answer

was, you changed it from -MR. LAZARUS:

I'm sorry.

I thought your

11

question was whether they could recover for cancer in the

12

second one.

13
14
15

I didn't understand you were referring to --

QUESTION:

Do we have cases in the law where you

give discounts for the first verdict?
MR. LAZARUS:

Your Honor, I'm not sure.

I don't

16

think this issue has come up, but I don't think it's a bar

17

to the recovery here.

18
19
20
21
22

If I can refer to the radiation burn case that
they referred to on page 2 of the reply brief -QUESTION:

Well, but it indicates that maybe the

recovery now is problematic.
MR. LAZARUS:

No, Your Honor, it's not

23

problematic, because we have a present injury, and where

24

you have a present physical injury and you have a present

25

emotional injury, an apprehension based on that, those are

43

1

two types of injuries.
QUESTION:

2
3

Well, don't you think that emotional

fear ought to be one that is reasonable?

4

MR. LAZARUS:

5

QUESTION:

6

And a causal nexus there between the

asbestosis and the fear?
MR. LAZARUS:

7
8

Yes.

Well, Your Honor, we do think

there is a causal nexus -QUESTION:

9

There should be, shouldn't there?

MR. LAZARUS:

10

We -- but we do think there's a

11

causal nexus here, and under the Restatement of Torts, all

12

right, there are two different possible causal nexus under

13

section 456 of the Restatement.

14

those are met, and that is, we think that the fear is

15

caused by the physical injury.

16

same negligent conduct, but that is also a sufficiency of

17

the evidence question, and what they are positing here is

18

what the legal standard should be for physically injured

19

plaintiffs and the recovery for related emotional stress

20

harm.

21

We actually think both of

It's also caused by the

An example, the Anderson case they cite on

22

page 2 of their reply brief -- a radiation burn case --

23

which they say is distinct from this case.

24

the same as this case.

25

QUESTION:

It's exactly

I think you're right, and the dog

44

1

bite cases support you, and the radiation cases support

2

you, and if it's cut-and-dried, as you say, then you win.
But if, when I look at all this stuff again, and

3
4

I come to the conclusion -- if I were to come to the

5

conclusion that it wasn't cut-and-dried, then I'm much

6

more at sea, and I want you to see why.
One was the reason I gave, which is the risk

7
8

problems, and the other, which is driving that, and I'd

9

just like you to comment on this, is -- is my concern that

10

if we begin to compensate people for fear of small changes

11

in risks when the law doesn't -- is open on the point --

12

what will happen in the asbestos cases, and that was their

13

initial point, is that we will -- there's $200 billion at

14

stake, and the fund will run dry.
When the people who really get the cancer come

15
16

into court, the cupboard will be bare, and I think that's

17

a serious policy problem, and it's worrying me quite a

18

lot, and that's why I keep coming back to the open nature

19

of this.

20

MR. LAZARUS:

Your Honor, I think that the way

21

to address that kind of issue is not to change decades of

22

settled tort --

23

QUESTION:

Well, I say, is there any answer --

24

MR. LAZARUS:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, there is.

-- other than the law that is

45

1

clear --

2

MR. LAZARUS:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. LAZARUS:

There is.

There is --

Yes.
-- and what can be done in a case

5

like that is, the defendant in that case can request a

6

verdict form which requires the jury to allocate out, and

7

that would allow a judge and an appellate, if appropriate,

8

to review, and jury trials --

9

QUESTION:

MR. LAZARUS:

10
11

Yes, but --- trials, it happens all the

time.
QUESTION:

12

-- that isn't automatic in most

13

jurisdictions, Mr. Lazarus.

14

special verdict," and if the court says "No, I don't think

15

I'll give you one," that's pretty much the end of it,

16

isn't it?
MR. LAZARUS:

17

You can't say "I want a

Your Honor, they didn't request

18

one here, but that is the proper way to address the issue,

19

and that's why you see -QUESTION:

20

I don't understand what you're

21

saying.

22

money is still paid to this claimant, so that when the

23

person who actually has cancer comes into court, this

24

company is bankrupt.

25

What -- allocate out -- how does that -- the

MR. LAZARUS:

No, but Your Honor, it addresses

46

1

Justice Breyer's concern, and that is, it allows you to

2

have a record upon which one can make sure that the jury

3

hasn't awarded a disproportionate amount based upon this

4

one element, that you don't have the tail wagging the dog.

5

QUESTION:

But what's disproportionate?

6

QUESTION:

What's disproportionate?

7

QUESTION:

Suppose you take one plaintiff who is

8

very nervous, very apprehensive, and for that person this

9

increased risk --

10

QUESTION:

Right.

11

QUESTION:

-- is going to be much more

12

aggravated.

Then, take another person who's subject to

13

the same risk, but has a thicker skin and says, "Well,

14

I'll take it in stride."
MR. LAZARUS:

15

Well, Your Honor, it's a

16

reasonable apprehension.

This is why there's an objective

17

standard which applies to emotional recovery which doesn't

18

require the physical.

19

standard.

It has to meet an objective

20

If someone has a very, very thick skin in tort

21

law and they, in fact, as a result of that, don't suffer

22

damage, then they haven't suffered damage.

23

very, very, very thin skin, and they suffer a lot of

24

damage, then they don't recover everything --

25

QUESTION:

If they have a

When the person gets cancer --

47

1
2

MR. LAZARUS:

-- unless it's a reasonable

apprehension.
QUESTION:

3

If a person gets cancer -- and I take

4

it you agree with the Government that such a person could

5

get past, present, and future anxiety as part of pain and

6

suffering, but suppose that person had earlier had

7

asbestos, and then brings his claim for lung cancer,

8

couldn't -- if you prevail today -- the defendant say

9

"Well, at least for the apprehension in the past, you know

10

you're precluded, because you could have brought that

11

claim when you got asbestosis"?
MR. LAZARUS:

12

Your Honor, that might be

13

possible.

14

here before this Court, and I haven't looked at the issue

15

preclusion there between the two.
What is clear is, if you have a current physical

17

That is not an issue which has been addressed

injury --

18

QUESTION:

It would be claim preclusion.

19

MR. LAZARUS:

Yes, right, and it's not an issue

20

which has been briefed here, because I think that when you

21

have a case like this with a present physical injury, and

22

you have a present emotional injury based on that, or as

23

this Court has actually said in Metro-North, related to

24

the physical injury, that's sufficient.

25

I would like -- if -- to address the second

48

1

issue, with the Court's --

2

QUESTION:

Before you do, may I ask one --

3

QUESTION:

Let me ask one -- please.

4

QUESTION:

Just one quick question.

Do you

5

agree with Mr. Phillips' appraisal of the facts as -- we

6

should assume that the fear of cancer was the major

7

element of damages?

8
9

MR. LAZARUS:

No, Your Honor.

All one has to

assume here is that there was sufficient evidence that a

10

reasonable jury could give some money based on fear of

11

cancer, not that they had to, and not, certainly, that

12

they gave $4.4 million, just sufficient evidence that a

13

reasonable jury could have given a dollar, or some money.

14

That's all that would be necessary.

15

The second -- sorry.

16

QUESTION:

Was there testimony here that

17

plaintiff A had heavy, or severe asbestosis and

18

plaintiff B had mild, and was it based on any lung X-rays

19

to show that this person's very badly infected and the

20

other wasn't?

21

MR. LAZARUS:

Yes, Your Honor.

There is --

22

there's lots of record evidence in this case to establish

23

the asbestosis and how there may have been different

24

degrees of asbestosis.

25

QUESTION:

All right, and since that's dependent

49

1

on dosage, why isn't this a case in which we can apportion

2

causation?
MR. LAZARUS:

3

Your Honor, for very simple a

4

reason.

5

itself on its face actually directs there to be joint and

6

several liability when you have single injuries.

7

our first argument, that FELA on its face answers the

8

question, or that FELA provides that the railroad should

9

be liable, quote, "for such injury or death resulting in

10
11

The first reason is that we think that FELA

That's

whole or in part from the negligence of the railroad."
QUESTION:

Correct me if I'm wrong, is it a

12

principle of tort law that if causation can be

13

apportioned, that the injury is -- that there is then

14

several liability on that tort --

15

MR. LAZARUS:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. LAZARUS:

Your Honor --

-- or am I wrong about that?
No.

The background principle of

18

the common law of torts here is that there are -- if there

19

is a single injury, then there is joint and several

20

liability unless there's a reasonable basis for

21

apportionment.

22

Our threshold argument --

QUESTION:

And since asbestosis is peculiarly

23

related to dosage and exposure, why isn't that a proper

24

ground for apportionment here?

25

MR. LAZARUS:

Assuming that FELA doesn't answer

50

1

the question, let me answer it based upon the common law.

2

Because the plaintiff has the burden -- sorry, the

3

defendant -- petitioner has the burden in that case to

4

establish 1) what the doses were, and 2) what the dose

5

relationship was, and the one thing we know here, the

6

prototype example that Mr. Phillips referred to is

7

Mr. Butler, and the fact is that Mr. Butler apparently

8

worked for three months exposed to asbestos for

9

petitioner, and for many, many years exposed to asbestos

10

at other workplaces.

11

While we don't know what the dose relationship

12

is, Your Honor, we do know for the record the one thing

13

the dose relationship isn't is time.

14

one time to another.

15

On page 420 of the joint appendix, their expert testified

16

that one is far more likely to contract asbestosis from

17

high concentrations over a short period of time than low

18

concentrations over a long period of time, and there's a

19

reason for that.

One can't compare

Let me tell you why we know that.

20

As Dr. Brody explains on page 87 of the joint

21

appendix, the lungs can naturally rid themselves of the

22

fibers at the low concentrations.

23

concentrations -- the macrophages.

24

concentrations that the lungs can't rid themselves of the

25

fibers.

It's only at the high
It's only at the high

51

1

While we have no idea how low the concentration

2

levels were at these other workplaces, we do know how high

3

the concentrations levels were at petitioner's workplace,

4

because Mr. Butler testified on page 249 of the joint

5

appendix that during those three months, he worked in the

6

location of petitioner's workplace where the asbestos

7

concentrations were at the highest.

8

that he worked in the room where the engines were stripped

9

of their fibers, and more fibers were placed on.

Mr. Butler testified

10

He testifies on page 249 he looks at these same

11

pictures, which were trial exhibits -- they're reproduced

12

in our brief.

13

yes, that's the kind of room I worked in.

14

and 250.

He looks at these pictures and he says,

Yes, that's the kind of exposure I faced.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. LAZARUS:

17
18

This is 249

Well -So we know he had the very high

concentrations -QUESTION:

Well now, how do we know that?

19

You're saying he worked in the place with the highest

20

concentrations so far as the railroad is concerned, but

21

how do we know how that compares with where he worked

22

elsewhere?

23

MR. LAZARUS:

Your Honor, we have no idea, and

24

they -- because they never introduced or sought to

25

introduce any evidence, but what we do know is that very

52

1

low concentrations -- here we can turn to the Rand report,

2

which they filed with this Court -- lodged with the

3

Court --just two weeks ago.

4

testimony of this case makes absolutely clear that in low

5

concentration employment centers, at low concentration

6

exposures, one is very unlikely to have any kind of

7

physical injury, asbestosis or cancer ever develop, which

8

is why there are hundreds and hundreds of thousands of

9

plaintiffs, many of which come from low exposure, which,

10

as the Rand report makes clear, is not likely to lead to

11

any kind of disease.

12

We know how high it was here.

The Rand report and the

We have no idea how low it was here.

13

I have no doubt, Your Honor, that petitioner

14

would have been very hard-pressed at trial to actually

15

show what the doses were, and to show what the dose

16

relationship is, but what I do know is, whatever their

17

reason was at trial for never trying to introduce this

18

evidence, and they never -- if you looked at their motion,

19

where they made the motion for this jury instruction, they

20

never even remotely suggest what the basis for

21

apportionment would be, but whatever their strategic

22

reason for doing that at trial, what is absolutely clear

23

is they are not allowed in the first instance to come to

24

the United States Supreme Court and proffer newspaper

25

articles, magazine articles, selected journal articles and

53

1

try to argue that there is a reasonable basis for

2

apportionment, or they're entitled to a remand to litigate

3

a issue which they failed to litigate in the first

4

instance.
The simple truth, Your Honor, is that at trial

5
6

in this case the respondents established all of their

7

essential elements of their negligent cause of action.

8

They established their physical injury, and they received

9

a jury award which certainly, compared to the jury awards

10

that I see mentioned in the amicus briefs, is a jury award

11

which seems relatively modest, and certainly a jury award

12

which on its face doesn't suggest that there was some

13

outrageous amount given for reasonable fear of cancer.
QUESTION:

14

May I just ask you, you say there's

15

no evidence of what the degree of exposure in other areas,

16

and so forth and so on.

17

proof with, or did they just the prove the time that they

18

worked --

19

MR. LAZARUS:

Didn't they make any offers of

They really just proved the time.

20

They -- we know the nature of the work, but what we don't

21

know, Your Honor --

22

QUESTION:

Well, but then that would be a

23

question of the weight of that evidence, rather than

24

whether they preserved the point.

25

MR. LAZARUS:

Well, Your Honor, I'm not -- they

54

1

never offer a basis of apportionment.

2

and the evidence at trial made clear, to know the dose and

3

dose relationship you'd have to know the air flow rates,

4

the pathways of exposure --

5

QUESTION:

We'd have to know,

At what point in the trial did it

6

become clear, by a ruling of the trial judge, that they

7

could not rely on the exposure in other areas?

8

MR. LAZARUS:

Your Honor, they were not denied

9

this opportunity at trial to introduce the evidence with

10

respect to the non-railroad employment, and you can see

11

that because they actually did do some cross-examination,

12

they did try to introduce the evidence of three months,

13

they did try to refer to the other workplaces, they could

14

have tried to introduce more evidence.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Well, why was that relevant if

there's joint liability?
MR. LAZARUS:

Well, we thought it was

18

irrelevant, Your Honor, but they were clearly thinking

19

about the possibility of requesting an apportionment

20

instruction, but the fact is, they never laid out a

21

reasonable basis.

22

If you look at the memorandum --

23

QUESTION:

24
25

Oh, but they did request an

instruction, didn't they?
MR. LAZARUS:

They did request the instruction,

55

1

but --

2

QUESTION:

So the point was preserved.

3

MR. LAZARUS:

Right, but the trial court was

4

correct in denying the instruction because they had not

5

met their burden of proffering a reasonable basis for

6

apportionment, and in the absence of that evidentiary

7

basis, the trial court was absolutely correct in denying

8

it.

9

reached.

10

This was a jury verdict, Your Honor, this was

QUESTION:

Oh, but that theory, then, is that

11

several liability would have been appropriate if the

12

evidence were sufficient?

13

MR. LAZARUS:

Well, no, Your Honor.

Our

14

threshold argument is that it would not -- asbestosis,

15

this is a classic individual injury.

16

courts who have talked about this, and they said, well, in

17

theory, asbestosis is dose-related.

18

QUESTION:

There are many

With respect, Mr. Lazarus, isn't

19

your -- the bottom line in this argument that this is

20

simply not an issue in the case, because they didn't

21

provide a basis?

22

MR. LAZARUS:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. LAZARUS:

25

Yes, that's absolutely right.

So you're saying, forget it.
That's right.

They had the burden

and they simply didn't meet their burden.

56

1

QUESTION:

And they say you had the burden.

2

MR. LAZARUS:

3

QUESTION:

Well, but it's quite --

It seems to me that argument goes to

4

the weight of the evidence they offered, rather than to

5

the -- your legal position.
MR. LAZARUS:

6

I may be missing something.

Well, Your Honor, no, they have to

7

as a matter of law, right, proffer some kind, and here

8

there's absolutely nothing --

9

QUESTION:

Well, but they did proffer -- if I

10

remember it, they did proffer evidence as to the time that

11

these people worked in other areas where they were exposed

12

to asbestos, didn't they?

13

MR. LAZARUS:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. LAZARUS:

There is some evidence --

But you're saying that's not enough.
There's some evidence as to that,

16

but in fact if you can look to their instruction they

17

don't even say what -- that time is the relevant factor,

18

and I think the evidence at trial shows that time is not

19

even close to establishing what the dose relationship

20

would be.

21

This is very complicated.
QUESTION:

But aren't you really saying that

22

unless there's an abuse of discretion on the part of the

23

trial judge in refusing to send this to the jury, based on

24

what you've just described, insufficiency of evidence on

25

their part, that it's not in the case for us?

MR. LAZARUS:

That's absolutely right, Your

Honor.

Thank you.

Mr. Phillips, you have two minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Very well, Mr. Lazarus.

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

9

I want to be absolutely clear about the

10

apportionment in this case.

We put in an instruction on

11

apportionment based on a reasonable basis following

12

Justice Kennedy's analysis of the law, which says if

13

there's a reasonable basis to apportion, you do that.
The trial judge did not reject that on the basis

14
15

of insufficient evidence.

16

volume 9 of the transcript is, if you've got a joint tort­

17

feasor, that tort-feasor is liable for all of the

18

injuries.

19

several liability.

20

ruling we challenged.

21

Court.

24
25

He said it as a matter of law.

It's joint and

There is no apportionment.

That's the

That's the legal issue before this

The second question, then, with your leave, is

22
23

What he said at page 179,

to -QUESTION:

Well, but should we adopt your

position if it's as difficult to show this separate

58

1

causation as your brother argues?

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, Dean Prosser said from day

3

one it's always going to be difficult to apportion, but

4

that's no reason not to have the jury undertake to

5

apportion.

6

that are very hard to make, but the better rule is to

7

apportion, because that's the fair outcome that will arise

8

in these cases.

There are lots of decisions that juries make

With respect to the fear of cancer damages, the

9
10

key to this case, it seems to me, is just how big a

11

gatekeeper function the fact of asbestosis can be, and

12

my -- the argument is, asbestosis is extraordinarily easy

13

to diagnose.

in West Virginia.

claim of asbestosis.

supported by an expert.

There are currently 5,500 cases under FELA
Every single one of them involves a
Every single one of them will be

What you get is, that's not a gatekeeper.

17

Those

18

cases are going to come in, and then you're going to have

19

exactly the kinds of evidence you had in this case, I'm

20

afraid of cancer, give me whatever you think is the right

21

number.

22

unlimited damages.

under FELA in Buckley.

That is the essence of unpredictable and
This Court declined to allow that
It should decline to allow that
