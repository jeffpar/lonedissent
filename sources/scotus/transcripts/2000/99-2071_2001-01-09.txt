CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Ms. Davis.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTHA F. DAVIS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MS. DAVIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

This case raises the question of whether

11

differential treatment of mothers and fathers under

12

federal citizenship law violates the equal protection

13

component of the due process clause of the Fifth

14

Amendment.

15

son from infancy.

16

wedlock mother of a foreign-born child can establish her

17

child's citizenship at birth upon proof of three things:

18

U.S. nationality at the time of the child's birth,

19

parentage of the child, and prior physical presence in the

20

United States.

Joseph Boulais has raised his out of wedlock
Under 8 USC Section 1409, an out of

21

Joseph Boulais meets all of these criteria.

22

However, solely because he's the male parent, the law

23

imposes two additional criteria. First, Mr. Boulais, as a

24

father, must produce a signed statement that he will

25

support the child until his 18th birthday.
3

The father

1

here supported his son, but he never signed a statement.

2

Second, the father must before his child's 18th

3

birthday, either legitimate, adjudicate paternity or

4

formally acknowledge paternity, and here the father has

5

formally acknowledged paternity, but not until his son was

6

in his 20s.

7

QUESTION:

8

a facial challenge?

9

MS. DAVIS:

Miss Davis, is this an as-applied or

Justice O'Connor, this is a facial

10

challenge.

We do not believe there is any constitutional

11

basis on which this statute could be applied to

12

individuals.

13

QUESTION:

How do you deal with the Fiallo case?

14

MS. DAVIS:

Your Honor, the Fiallo case concerns

15

the situation of some individuals who are citizens

16

applying for special immigration preferences for children

17

of those citizens or relatives of those citizens.

18

Court here ruled that that was covered by the plenary

19

power.

20

trying to transmit citizenship at birth, benefits to -- to

21

parents, and so the difference is the question of what the

22

extent of plenary power is.

23

power should stop, at the very least, before it reaches a

24

situation where a citizen, here Mr. Boulais, is seeking to

25

transmit citizenship benefits to a child who, as the

The

Here the issue concerns only citizens applying for

And we believe that plenary

4

1

statute indicates, once citizenship is recognized will

2

relate back to the date of birth.

3

So I guess there are two basic distinctions.

4

One, that there's a relation back issue, so the citizen's

5

child -- the child here, once his citizenship is

6

recognized, will have been deemed to have been a citizen

7

from birth, and therefore there isn't any of the concern

8

about transfer of allegiances that's the case in

9

naturalization or also potentially the case in immigration

10

sorts of situations.

11

QUESTION:

12

with transfer of allegiances?

13

it retroactive as far as the law is concerned, but that

14

doesn't change the reality of it. The reality of it is

15

he's not an American citizen until these conditions are --

16

are met, and he's proclaimed to be such.

17

he's not an American citizen, is he?

18

MS. DAVIS:

Well, wait.

Why is there no problem

I mean, it's fine to make

Prior to that

As soon as those conditions are met,

19

then his citizenship is recognized at the time of birth.

20

That's recognized under statute --

21

QUESTION:

22

country before then.

23

MS. DAVIS:

But he was a citizen of some other

And once his citizenship is

24

recognized, he will be deemed to have been a dual citizen

25

of the country from the date of birth, but the statute
5

1

itself recognizes that there isn't a transfer of

2

allegiances by virtue of the fact that there isn't an oath

3

of allegiance that's required for, to establish

4

citizenship at birth, unlike naturalization, where that's

5

a substantive requirement of the -- of the recognition of

6

the status.

7

QUESTION:

Miss Davis, do I take -- do I

8

understand correctly the point you're making is that the

9

people who are being brought in or sought to be brought in

10

in Fiallo were coming in as aliens who might never become

11

citizens, they were not coming in as citizens?

12

coming in as preference, preference-eligible aliens, and

13

now you're saying, the distinction that you're making, if

14

I grasp it correctly, is these people, if you are correct,

15

will never come in as aliens.

16

citizenship should be recognized immediately.

17

distinction you're making?

18

MS. DAVIS:

19

QUESTION:

They were

The application is that the
That's the

That's correct, Your Honor.
No, but Miss Davis, you're not

20

suggesting that there's a constitutional right to have

21

your citizenship conferred on an American, the child of an

22

American parent brought abroad?

23

MS. DAVIS:

Not at all, Your Honor.

What we're

24

saying is the immigration statute makes a distinction

25

between citizenship at birth and other forms of
6

1

immigration status, and that because of that distinction,

2

the plenary power that shields in some instances

3

immigration actions from full constitutional review should

4

not apply here.

5

constitutional review or ordinary constitutional review of

6

transmission of citizenship from a citizen to a plenary

7

citizen.

8
9

It should stop short of barring full

QUESTION:
me why, why that is?

But the plenary -- can you explain to
I assume that the plenary power has

10

its basis, its rationale in the interest that the United

11

States has with its relations with foreign powers.

12

why is that inapplicable in -- in any case arising under

13

this particular statute?

14

MS. DAVIS:

15

QUESTION:

16

And

Justice Kennedy -And why -- to say that plenary power

stops puzzles me.

17

MS. DAVIS:

Yes.

Justice Kennedy, this Court

18

has never extended plenary power to every statute that

19

potentially implicates foreign relations.

20

there are many, many that do that, including child support

21

and environmental laws.

22

extended plenary power to every action under even the

23

Immigration Nationality Act in INS versus Chadha, for

24

example.

25

QUESTION:

There's only --

This Court has also never

What's the rationale for extending

1
2

plenary power to the alien cases?
MS. DAVIS:

The rationale that this Court has

3

offered is the idea that foreign relations is directly

4

implicated, I presume in part because of this transfer of

5

allegiances.

6

QUESTION:

You say -- you say Fiallo would have

7

come out differently if these aliens were not only

8

admitted but having been once they are admitted are

9

proclaimed to have been American citizens from birth?

10

That would wash out the plenary power of the federal

11

government?

12

MS. DAVIS:

Your Honor, then they would be in

13

the same category as the citizens here.

14

been citizens from birth.

15

QUESTION:

They would have

That doesn't make any sense to me.

16

If -- if -- if -- if you admit them without making them

17

citizens from birth, you have plenary power, but if you do

18

even the greater thing, admit them and make them citizens

19

from birth, suddenly your plenary power disappears.

20

seems to me, if anything, it ought to be the opposite.

21

MS. DAVIS:

It

Your Honor, here what we base our

22

argument on is the structure of the statute as well as the

23

long history of jus sanguinis citizenship, and this

24

Court's ruling in Rogers versus Bellei which also

25

indicated that citizenship at birth was subject to
8

1

ordinary constitutional scrutiny, even though there isn't

2

a right under the Fourteenth Amendment to that

3

citizenship, even though Congress could change the rules

4

of citizenship tomorrow, still the statute itself, the

5

history of jus sanguinis citizenship and this Court's

6

construction of that, of that law in Rogers versus Bellei

7

we believe supports limiting the extension of plenary

8

power authority to a situation where a citizen here is

9

seeking to transmit citizenship to his child who will be a

10

citizen at birth at the time that citizenship is

11

recognized.

12

QUESTION:

Let's assume the statute was slightly

13

different and the citizenship to be conferred did not

14

recognize -- did not relate back to birth.

15

say that the statute with that one change in it exceeded

16

Congress' plenary power under the naturalization clause?

17

MS. DAVIS:

18

QUESTION:

Would you then

Your Honor, I guess I'm -Maybe it would be simpler if I asked

19

the -- I think I can ask the question a different way.

20

you think that the -- the -- the act of recognizing

21

citizenship here for children born abroad is

22

naturalization within the meaning of the naturalization

23

clause?

24
25

MS. DAVIS:

Yes, Your Honor, it is

naturalization within the meaning of the constitutional
9

Do

1

naturalization clause.

2

that clause, has made choices about how to implement it

3

that we believe --

4
5

However, Congress, in implementing

QUESTION:

Right, that's what I wanted to get

MS. DAVIS:

-- that we believe implicate the

at.

6
7

extent of the plenary power.

8

QUESTION:

9

So that Congress, so far as the

clause is concerned, Congress could do this, leaving aside

10

equal protection.

Congress can do this if it simply did

11

not have the relation back provision?

12

MS. DAVIS:

13

QUESTION:

14

MS. DAVIS:

That's -- that's correct.
Yeah.
Your Honor, I mean, we certainly

15

wouldn't be able to argue that the transfer of allegiances

16

and those issues no longer implicated foreign relations,

17

and that's a critical part of our argument here.

18

Let me turn --

19

QUESTION:

Well, I wonder, suppose there were no

20

naturalization clause, suppose it didn't exist.

Wouldn't

21

Congress still have the power to enact this statute?

22

one is being naturalized. They are simply stating who is a

23

citizen.

24

in the United States of America or very few, and there had

25

to be rules as to who was a citizen and who isn't --

No

Just as, after all, no one in 1789 had been born

10

1

MS. DAVIS:

2

QUESTION:

3

Your Honor --- so what is this to do with

naturalization?

4

MS. DAVIS:

Your Honor, this Court has held in

5

the past, most notably in Rogers versus Bellei, that the

6

authority to grant citizenship at birth, jus sanguinis

7

citizenship, derives from the naturalization clause.

8

whether in the absence of that clause Congress could still

9

go forward I don't know because we, you know -- the Court

10

Now,

hasn't had to confront that issue.

11

QUESTION:

If Congress said everyone in 1780 who

12

has been born in the United States is a citizen of the

13

United States, would that have been naturalizing

14

everybody?

15

MS. DAVIS:

Your Honor, I think it would depend

16

upon what the term naturalization meant even at that time.

17

We know what it means now because Congress itself has

18

defined it in the statute to apply only to those

19

individuals who have citizenship that is prospective only,

20

and here Mr. Boulais and his son come forward with a claim

21

for citizenship that relates back to birth, so it's

22

clearly not in the same category as naturalization is

23

defined under the current statute.

24
25

QUESTION:

But it is -- it is naturalization in

the broader sense of referring to the constitutional
11

1

authority?

2
3
4

MS. DAVIS:

That's correct, but in implementing

-QUESTION:

And to that extent I think it makes

5

it somewhat difficult to distinguish Fiallo. Are you

6

arguing that we need to reverse Fiallo if necessary?

7

MS. DAVIS:

Your Honor, we don't believe that

8

Fiallo must be reversed in order to rule in our favor

9

because of the distinction that we just discussed.

10

However, as we indicate in our brief, there are reasons to

11

reassess Fiallo, given, in particular, the subsequent

12

development of equal protection law that might suggest

13

that the result in that case is one that the Court would

14

no longer --

15

QUESTION:

But if you were to reexamine Fiallo,

16

I suppose under your view, the amendment in 1986 to the

17

statute involved in Fiallo that adopted the position of

18

the dissenters in Fiallo would also be unconstitutional

19

because it basically followed the same pattern as this

20

statute does.

21

MS. DAVIS:

That's correct, Your Honor, yes,

22

because it retains the sex-based classifications.

23

course, there the Congress was not responding to a finding

24

on constitutionality, so they weren't bound by that kind

25

of a ruling.
12

Of

1

QUESTION:

Miss Davis, may we go back a few

2

steps because you said something that surprised me.

3

know that the Solicitor General took the line in its brief

4

that there are only two kinds of citizens -- born in the

5

United States, and everybody else for constitutional

6

purposes is naturalized.

7

I

My grandson was born in Paris of U.S. citizen

8

parents.

9

of the United States, but is that his correct status?

10

I had never considered him a naturalized citizen

MS. DAVIS:

Your Honor, we don't quarrel with

11

the construction that Rogers versus Bellei adopted, which

12

is that citizenship at birth is a form of naturalization.

13

However what we argue is that the Congress in implementing

14

that power has made a distinction between naturalization

15

under the statute and citizenship at birth under the

16

statute, and the implications of that distinction are that

17

the plenary power of Congress to regulate immigration does

18

not extend to citizenship at birth because citizenship at

19

birth relates back to the date of birth because

20

naturalization is defined to be prospective only because

21

there isn't a requirement of an oath of allegiance in

22

order to have citizenship at birth acknowledged.

23

QUESTION:

24

MS. DAVIS:

25

Can such a person be denaturalized?
Your Honor, I believe that that

person would be covered in the same way that those
13

1

citizens concerned in Afroyim and those cases whereby the

2

Constitution for denaturalization purposes, that person

3

could have additional conditions placed on citizenship

4

that would not be appropriate for a jus soli citizen.

5

-- yes, for a jus soli citizen.

6

Or

So, for example, the conditions placed on the

7

individual in Rogers versus Bellei, who was a citizen at

8

birth, the residency conditions are permissible under the

9

Constitution even though if those conditions are not

10

filled, the individual will lose citizenship at the time

11

that they fail to comply with those conditions.

12

QUESTION:

Miss Davis, I gather your position

13

would be different if in addition to the three conditions

14

that you mentioned there were a fourth condition, and that

15

is that the child of the American father swear allegiance

16

to the United States.

17

MS. DAVIS:

18

QUESTION:

If the child of the American?
Yes, yes.

Before he could

19

retroactively be deemed a United States citizen from

20

birth, in addition to the other three factors, he must

21

swear allegiance to the United States.

22

MS. DAVIS:

Your Honor, no, our argument would

23

not be different.

24

indication of the fact that Congress --

25

QUESTION:

I'm raising that because it's an

Well, I thought your argument hinged
14

1

entirely upon the fact that there's no problem about

2

changing allegiances, and this would require him to change

3

allegiance, to swear allegiance to the United States over

4

whatever other country he had come from.

5
6

MS. DAVIS:

Yes.

No, Your Honor, our argument

doesn't hinge entirely on that, no, but I raise that --

7

QUESTION:

I don't know what opinions -- it

8

seems to me so artificial to say that simply because you

9

make the admission retroactive and say he shall be deemed

10

to have been a citizen from birth, somehow the power of

11

Congress to make people who are not born in this country

12

and therefore automatically citizens, citizens somehow

13

becomes abridged.

14

retroactivity -- it's such an artificial device.

15

could make it retroactive or not retroactive.

16

I don't -- I just don't see how the

MS. DAVIS:

Congress

Your Honor, I believe that the

17

argument that I'm making reflects the construction of the

18

statute.

19

citizenship and citizenship at birth and naturalization.

20

It lists in the section 1401 jus soli citizenship along

21

with citizenship at birth.

22

The statute itself makes a distinction between

QUESTION:

I understand that, but we're not

23

talking about the statute.

I can agree that you can --

24

you can make a statutory distinction between those two

25

situations, but does that convert into a constitutional
15

1

distinction?

2

that there is some things you can constitutionally do when

3

you make the person retroactively from birth a United

4

States citizen or things that you can't do when you do

5

that that you could do if you didn't make him

6

retroactively.

7

And that's what you're arguing before us,

MS. DAVIS:

Yes, Justice Scalia, the issue is

8

the extent of the plenary power doctrine, which this Court

9

has, as I suggested earlier, has not always applied in the

10
11

immigration area, and we believe that -QUESTION:

And has never been applied in that

12

whole line of cases.

They are all cases of people who are

13

admitted as aliens, so if it were to extend to such a

14

case, it would be an extension.

15

MS. DAVIS:

That -- that's correct, Your Honor.

16

Applying it to citizens and citizens at birth, would

17

extend the plenary power doctrine beyond where it has ever

18

been extended in the -- in the past.

19

QUESTION:

Well, that assumes the person is not

20

an alien simply because Congress says the person shall be

21

retroactively deemed a citizen.

22

purposes, it seems to me, as opposed to statutory

23

purposes, whether the person is an alien or not should

24

depend upon whether the person is a natural born citizen

25

of the United States or whether citizenship must be
16

But for constitutional

1
2

conferred by Congress.
MS. DAVIS:

Right.

Well, in fact, Your Honor,

3

you mentioned natural born citizen, and many commentators

4

believe that citizens at birth are deemed to be natural

5

born citizens, so this is a category of citizenship that

6

traditionally has had a different status than naturalized

7

citizenship for many, many years, for centuries.

8
9

QUESTION:

The debate over whether someone born

abroad could be a candidate for President?

10

MS. DAVIS:

11

QUESTION:

President, correct, Your Honor.
But someone -- someone born abroad is

12

not in the same class as someone born jus solus here in

13

the United States, which they are citizens by virtue of

14

the Fourteenth Amendment, are they not?

15

MS. DAVIS:

That's correct, Your Honor. However,

16

the statute, the immigration and naturalization statute,

17

treats those jus soli citizenship -- citizens and citizens

18

at birth in the same section, so they clearly are

19

contemplating that many of the same protections are going

20

to apply to those citizens.

21

QUESTION:

May I just clarify one thing? Your

22

view is the statute is invalid on its face, which, as I

23

take it, means that the requirements as to the children of

24

female parents have to be applied in the same way to

25

children of male American citizen parents born abroad?
17

1

MS. DAVIS:

2

QUESTION:

That's correct.
So that anyone anywhere in the world

3

at any time can prove that his parent, his father was an

4

American citizen, has been a citizen since that person's

5

birth, even if it was 60 years ago?

6

MS. DAVIS:

Your Honor, there -- according to

7

the remedy that we've proposed, there would still be some

8

criteria to be met, yes, but the remedy --

9

QUESTION:

Okay, criteria other than those

10

applied to children of mother -- of mother -- whose mother

11

was an American citizen.

12

MS. DAVIS:

A mother currently can sponsor a

13

child, transmit citizenship at any time during the child's

14

life.

15

QUESTION:

16

MS. DAVIS:

17

Correct.
Our argument is that a father, that

--

18

QUESTION:

19

MS. DAVIS:

Has precisely the same right?
Should have the same right, the

20

remedy that this Court should impose should be one that

21

gives the --

22

QUESTION:

Well, he doesn't have the right.

23

It's whether he has -- he has already done it, merely by

24

virtue of being a citizen and by having lived in the

25

United States for a certain period of time.
18

1

MS. DAVIS:

What this Court has indicated, both

2

in Rogers v. Bellei and also in a majority of the justices

3

in the Miller case --

4
5

QUESTION:
wanted to --

6
7

MS. DAVIS:

-- stated that it's recognition of

existing citizenship and continuing citizenship.

8
9

But that's your position is all I

QUESTION:

Well, if we agreed with your equal

protection argument, I suppose we would have the

10

alternative to say not simply that the father is pushed

11

into the same favorable position as the mother, but the

12

mother is pushed into the same unfavorable position as the

13

father.

14

MS. DAVIS:

Your Honor, that would remedy the

15

equal protection issue, but we believe that it would run

16

contrary to what we know about the Court's principles in

17

crafting a remedy.

18

QUESTION:

Has the Court ever in those extension

19

versus invalidation cases, has it ever taken the route of

20

lessening the benefits instead of equalizing up?

21

ever equalized down instead of up?

22
23

MS. DAVIS:

Has it

We have not been able to find a case

where there has been equalization down, as you say.

24

QUESTION:

But there is always a first time.

25

QUESTION:

In this case the government's
19

1

argument, the stateless person problem, takes much more

2

prominence than it did in our earlier case, and that would

3

seem to state a rational basis for this distinction.

4

Would you comment on the government's argument in this

5

regard?

6

MS. DAVIS:

Certainly.

I mean, our position is

7

that they need to meet the heightened scrutiny standard.

8

But even --

9
10
11

QUESTION:

Well, and I think it might meet that

as well, but would you comment on that?
MS. DAVIS:

Sure.

The issue is whether or not

12

-- well, to start out, we believe that that issue is not

13

properly in the case because we haven't challenged the

14

physical presence requirements here, and the government as

15

well as Congress have indicated that the way they have

16

dealt with statelessness, concerns about statelessness is

17

to have differential physical presence requirements for

mothers and fathers.

20

requirements.

21

those physical presence requirements will remain and will

22

continue to do the job that the government says they are

23

needed for in terms of addressing the potential for

24

statelessness, but even beyond that, even assuming that it

25

is in the case, the risk of statelessness is not gender

Some of those laws are

MS. DAVIS:

There are some nations that are not

13

14

those children are currently not getting the benefit of

15

the generous physical presence requirements.

16

There are some nations where there's a

that if a child is born abroad and doesn't maintain

U.S. father, the father can no longer transmit the

citizenship to the child, so in fact that child of U.S.

concerns about statelessness by either having a more

statelessness, so it could have more generous require --

case he has no standing to raise that problem since he

12

amply meets the residence requirements, so he can't raise

13

somebody else's case.

14

MS. DAVIS:

Exactly right.

Because in this

I mean, the remedy

15

that we seek -- the Court would have to go beyond the four

16

corners of the complaint or of the issue here, the case

17

here in order to address the physical presence

18

requirements.

19

QUESTION:

And the things that hold him back,

20

the two things, seem to me to have nothing to do with the

21

statelessness concern anyway, the formal acknowledgment of

22

paternity and proof of support, of 418.

23

MS. DAVIS:

24

QUESTION:

25

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.
It has nothing to do with

statelessness.
22

1

MS. DAVIS:

And as I said, in fact, may increase

2

the risk of statelessness because any barrier that's

3

placed on transmittal of citizenship increases the risk of

4

statelessness, especially absolute cutoff at age 18.

QUESTION:

Are you saying that children of

6

American parents born abroad, of whom there are millions

7

and millions, are naturalized citizens and could never be

8

President like George Romney couldn't have run for

9

President?

10

MS. DAVIS:

I'm sorry, the children of parents

11

born abroad are naturalized?

12

QUESTION:

Yes, I mean, their -- their

13

citizenship is conferred by statute, and they are citizens

14

from birth, and there are probably tens of millions of

15

them, and George Romney was one of them, and I had not

16

thought that they were naturalized citizens.

17

they were citizens who were citizens by virtue of their

18

birth, and they're citizens from birth, but you were

19

saying they're the same as naturalized.

20

misunderstood.

21

MS. DAVIS:

Yes.

I thought

Or maybe I

22

Constitution is natural born citizens for purposes of

3

QUESTION:

But that's a different term

If that's so, then those who -- then

4

those who are born abroad of an American parent are

5

natural born citizens in your view?

6

MS. DAVIS:

7

QUESTION:

That's correct.
Contrasted with naturalized citizens

8

who would have been aliens who previously were aliens and

9

would have become citizens by virtue of a naturalization

10
11

law; is that right?
MS. DAVIS:

Your Honor, I guess the question is

12

whether the term naturalized in the Constitution also

13

encompasses natural born citizens. In Rogers versus Bellei

14

suggested that it did.

15

QUESTION:

Well, I -- for present purposes what

16

we're interested in is what standard of review to apply,

17

and whether the extremely deferential standard applies to

18

these natural born citizens.

19

MS. DAVIS:

I think it's -- I think it's totally

20

clear that jus sanguinis citizenship has a different

21

history than naturalized citizenship and has traditionally

22

by this Court as well as by Congress been treated

23

differently.

24
25

QUESTION:
citizenship?

They wanted natural

6

MS. DAVIS:

Yes, by the same token --

QUESTION:

That is jus soli, isn't it?

8

MS. DAVIS:

9

By the same token, one could say

that the provision would apply now to ensure that Congress

10

can't apply suspect classifications to keep certain

11

individuals from aspiring to those offices.

12

QUESTION:

Well, maybe.

I'm just referring to

the meaning of natural born within the Constitution.

don't think you're disagreeing.

-QUESTION:

There is a debate over whether my

MS. DAVIS:

-- whether he can be Vice President.
25

1

QUESTION:

Of course the interesting thing about

2

that provision, it requires that he be natural born at the

3

time of the adoption of the Constitution. That's what it

4

literally says.

5

(Laughter.)

6

MS. DAVIS:

To return to that issue briefly, I

7

want to make sure that the Court understands that applying

8

heightened scrutiny does not mean that the government then

9

does not get to make its case, that the concerns about

10

dual citizenship or concerns about statelessness might

11

meet heightened scrutiny.

12

in those unusual instances where they can establish that

13

they meet that standard, apply classifications that would

14

otherwise be suspect.

15

cases, but it's not that there is no review.

16

means is simply that you're saying, or that the citizens

17

transmitting citizenship would be able to invoke the same

18

constitutional standards as are usually invoked.

19

reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

Very well, Miss Davis. Mr. Kneedler,

22

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

23

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

24
25

I

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, the naturalization clause of the United
26

1

States Constitution commits to Congress the plenary power

2

inherent in the sovereignty of every nation to determine

3

which aliens will be granted United States citizenship.

4

As this Court said in the Ginsburg case, no

5

alien has the slightest right to naturalization unless all

6

statutory requirements are complied with.

7

QUESTION:

Well, you've heard all these

8

arguments this morning that this isn't a case of

9

naturalization and not part of Congress' plenary power

10
11

when a child is born of a parent that's a U.S. citizen.
MR. KNEEDLER:

With respect to that, I think

12

this Court's decision in Wong Kim Ark is dispositive.

13

There the Court traced the history of United States

14

citizenship with reference to the common law of England

15

prior to the adoption of the Constitution, and in that

16

case the Court pointed out that at common law, in order to

17

be a citizen at common law, it was necessary for the

18

person to be born in England.

19

on people who were born abroad to British subjects was

20

conferred only by statute.

21

regarded historically in England as a fundamental --

22

QUESTION:

The citizenship conferred

In other words, it was not

That's not so.

I mean, you're right

23

in saying by statute.

Normally in all countries

24

citizenship was conferred by statute.

25

Amendment was passed to the problem of slavery.
27

The Fourteenth
But

1

statutes traditionally transmitted citizenship most cases

2

through blood.

3

that when the United States passes a statute like any

4

other country that transmits citizenship through blood

5

that they treat that person who results as a citizen the

6

same way precisely as a naturalized citizen?

7

Isn't that true?

MR. KNEEDLER:

And so would you say

Yes, I'm not disputing that.

The

8

point I'm making is that this Court held in Wong Kim Ark

9

and also held in Rogers v. Bellei that the conferral of

10

citizenship on someone born abroad to a United States

11

citizen is encompassed in the naturalization clause, and

12

the important thing about Wong Kim Ark is the Court

13

distinguished persons born to U.S. citizens abroad not on

14

the ground that that was a more fundamental form of

15

citizenship, but if anything, a less fundamental form of

16

citizenship.

17

QUESTION:

So, in other words, in your view, the

18

hundreds of millions of people by now who may have been

19

born abroad of American parents are suddenly subject, when

20

their constitutional rights are at stake, to a less basic

21

review by the courts than citizens who are born in the

22

United States?

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

24

QUESTION:

25

No, once --

Citizens of service people, citizens

of millions of people who have lived abroad?
28

1

MR. KNEEDLER:

Once the person is a citizen, of

2

course, then that citizen, like every other citizen, is

3

entitled to all the rights of a citizen under the United

4

States Constitution.

5

entitled to enter the citizenship of the United States to

6

begin with, and in that respect we think this case is

7

identical to -- at least as strong as Fiallo versus Bell,

8

and, if anything, stronger, because it is not merely the

9

question of who will be entitled to physically enter the

But the question here is who will be

10

United States, but who will be regarded as a member of our

11

society on a permanent basis. Citizenship is essentially

12

irreversible.

13

permanent member of the community.

14

An alien can be expelled.

QUESTION:

A citizen is a

Mr. Kneedler, when you say, when you

15

say in effect that all citizens are treated alike,

16

certainly a naturalized citizen in the nonargumentative

17

use, someone who has been an alien and comes here, can

18

have his citizenship revoked.

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

Oh, absolutely.

No, I didn't

20

mean to suggest -- yes.

21

naturalized citizen can have his naturalization revoked.

22

For example, if it was procured by fraud, but the other

23

important -- and this was significant in Rogers v. Bellei,

24

which had to do with the constitutionality of a condition

25

subsequent for a citizen, a person who was born abroad to

It's absolutely clear that a

29

1

United States citizens.

2

provision here in 1401 (g) until, I believe, it was 1978,

3

someone in that situation had -- the child had to reside

4

in the United States for some period of time after birth

5

in order to establish the requisite connection with the

6

United States, and that was challenged on the ground that

7

the person having been declared a citizen at birth, there

8

could not be a condition subsequent to perfecting it.

9

In that case, it was the parallel

And this Court upheld that provision in Rogers

10

v. Bellei, and importantly, it did so by distinguishing

11

the children of U.S. parents born abroad from those who

12

are born in the United States with the suggestion that

13

Congress has greater latitude with respect to the

14

naturalization of those persons than it does to others,

15

precisely because they are not encompassed by the terms of

16

the Fourteenth Amendment.

17

The Fourteenth Amendment refers to citizens who

18

are born or naturalized in the United States, and the

19

Court pointed out that persons who are born to United

20

States citizens abroad do not fall within that description

21

and therefore are not citizens for Fourteenth Amendment

22

purposes.

23

QUESTION:

So, if any -- may I ask just a

24

question.

Are there any statistics anywhere that tell us

25

the size of either of the classes of children born abroad
30

1

of an unmarried female parent and those born abroad of an

2

unmarried male parent?

3

people are going to be affected by this decision?

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

Do we have any idea how many

I'm sorry, I do not know the

5

totals.

6

Court's opinion in Miller v. Albright suggest that the

7

pool is probably larger for the U.S. citizen, children of

8

U.S. citizen fathers rather than mothers, which I think,

9

by the way --

10

I think the statistics that were cited in this

QUESTION:

That's unquestionable, isn't it?

And

11

isn't that perhaps one of the reasons behind the

12

differentiation in this statute?

13

populations of children of United States servicemen in the

14

Far East and in Germany, and -- service personnel.

15

expect very few of these are the children of female

16

service personnel.

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

There are large

I think that's true.

And I

And one

18

point I wanted to make, Justice, an aside here, that goes,

19

that would go critically to the question of remedy in this

20

case.

21

If we were -QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, before we get to that,

22

why would it?

You said it in your brief.

23

you have a tremendous hurdle in the beginning.

24

notion is that there are these men out there who are being

25

Johnny Appleseed around, to prove by clear and convincing
31

It seems to me
If the

1

evidence that they are the father, for the person to even

2

-- the woman even to identify this person seems to me an

3

-- but most of the cases of men who don't want to be

4

fathers who have in fact have sired children abroad, it

5

isn't difficult at all to escape that obligation.

6

they have to do is say, you know, I have nothing to do

7

with this person.

8
9
10
11

All

I met her once, and that was it.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I think there is probably a

wide variation of the fact pattern.

I took the question

to mean -QUESTION:

I thought we were assuming it was not

12

13

it's very easy to establish the relationship now.

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

16

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

What is

Well, I took the question to be

Once we find out who he is -Right, right, and even --

It may even take an awful lot of

resources to find out who he is, to get him to take it.
MR. KNEEDLER:

It may or may not, but if the

22

possibility of citizenship was available to people who had

23

no prior assumption that they had any claim to United

24

States citizenship, it is valuable enough in the world

25

community that we would expect people to look for it.
32

1
2

QUESTION:

In many, many cases, all the child

would have to do is ask his mother.

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

In many cases that is correct.

4

would like to go back to the point about Fiallo v. Bell

5

because, as I said, I do believe this case is controlled

6

by Fiallo v. Bell, if anything, the reasons for the

7

deference to congressional powers are stronger here than

8

they were in Fiallo v. Bell.

9

QUESTION:

Before you do that, Mr. Kneedler, you

10

did say something.

11

mine.

12

the Fourteenth Amendment, but I assume he had the same

13

equal protection rights and due process rights --

14

I keep worrying about this grandson of

You said that he's not a citizen for purposes of

MR. KNEEDLER:

Absolutely.

Once a person is a

15

citizen, they are a member of our national community and

16

entitled to all of the rights of any other citizen.

17
18
19

I

QUESTION:

But you think he might be

denaturalized, the way a naturalized citizen could be?
MR. KNEEDLER:

There would have to be, certainly

20

as a statutory matter and perhaps as a constitutional

21

matter, some defect in the original naturalization or the

22

original --

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. KNEEDLER:

25

But there was no naturalization.
No, but that's why I think the

prospect -- I mean, I suppose if in a situation like this
33

1

the child was recognized as a U.S. citizen on the ground

2

that the parent was a U.S. citizen and then it turned out

3

that the parent was not a U.S. citizen after all, then the

4

child's citizenship could be revoked on the ground that it

5

was fraudulently or improperly procured, so it would be a

6

situation with a factual predicate for the grant of

7

citizenship in the first place.

8
9

QUESTION:

The problem with those things is

usually, is insofar as you get a lesser degree of, for

10

example, procedural protections, in certain instances

11

there are conflicts about what the facts are, and insofar,

12

if it is ever true that a person who is involved in

13

naturalization gets less than full judicial review, would

14

that same be true of, say, my daughter or millions of

15

others, say, servicemen's children who are born abroad and

16

who the children of servicemen and women who are abroad

17

and not born in the United States?

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

19

QUESTION:

I would think --

Naturalized people get lesser

20

protection, less than full review.

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

I believe that if the question

22

ever arose of the denaturalization of someone who was born

23

abroad to United States citizens, the same standards would

24

apply to anyone who was naturalized in the United States

25

and therefore is a Fourteenth Amendment citizen, and I
34

1

believe the standard for denaturalization is clear and

2

convincing evidence.

3

that's correct.

4

QUESTION:

I'm not sure of that, but I believe

I'm concerned that your time will

5

expire before you've addressed either point that may be

6

critical here -- the application of Fiallo and if we

7

disagree with you and think there's some equal protection

8

problem, what about the remedy?

9

both of those.

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

I will.

Will you try to touch on

In fact, with respect to

11

Fiallo, we think that all of the reasons why deference to

12

the political branches in this area applied to immigration

13

in Fiallo apply equally here, first of all in Fiallo

14

itself, the Court lumped together immigration and

15

naturalization at page 79, I believe it's 792 of its

16

opinion, in describing Congress' plenary powers.

17

first of all a reason why Fiallo applies is it's a

18

question of who is going to enter our society.

19

the children or parents in Fiallo were seeking to come

20

into the United States with the hope eventually of being

21

citizens.

22

one-step, but we don't think that the analysis in Fiallo

23

should change on that.

24
25

And also

Certainly

In Fiallo it was a two-step task. Here it's a

And therefore deciding who should be a citizen
is also an aspect of who is an alien.
35

They are flip side

1

to the same question.

And Congress has plenary power to

2

control which aliens will be entitled to enter the United

3

States.

4

Third, it's intimately tied up with foreign

5

relations, and again this is a point that was made in

6

Fiallo itself.

7

at page 730 that the concerns about foreign relations only

8

have to do with situations where there are grave threats

9

to the national security or the general welfare of the

There the Court rejected the proposition

10

United States. The Court said it had never deferred to the

11

branches depending upon whether there was some threat of

12

that nature or some more individualized determination as

13

to who will be entitled to enter the United States.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, I have this problem

15

with it.

16

problem if you didn't recognize that the child born abroad

17

to U.S. citizens is a U.S. citizen because, as you point

18

out in most countries in the world, they go by blood, not

19

by land of birth. So -- but you don't have that situation

20

with -- an alien coming to our shores is a citizen of

21

someplace. So the -- you call the child born abroad an

22

alien, but in most places in the world that child would

23

not be a citizen of the place in which that person is

24

born; isn't that so?

25

You would surely have a huge statelessness

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, again, that may depend.
36

I

1

mean, if you have a child born abroad to two U.S. citizen

2

parents, that may be true, it may not be true, depending

3

on the country.

4

QUESTION:

Well, I thought you said in your

5

brief that in most places, and I think it's right, they do

6

not go on just solely, they go on the parentage.

7
8

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, there are countries that go

both ways, but what --

9

QUESTION:

But the person coming in in Fiallo is

10

a citizen of someplace.

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

That is true, and of course

12

someone declared to be a citizen under this statute may

13

also be a citizen of someplace else as well. There are

14

questions of dual nationality that can arise.

15

QUESTION:

But you brought up the problem, you

16

said one of the reasons for this is that the child and the

17

mother will be a citizen of no place if not of the United

18

States.

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

That is the justification for the

20

shorter residency requirement because that is apt to be

21

true in many cases, but the broader point --

22

QUESTION:

And on that point, you heard

23

obviously the colloquy between me and the petitioner's

24

counsel.

25

are statements, problems on the side of the father, too,

Petitioner's counsel indicates, oh, well, there

37

1

just as great.

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

They are certainly not just as

3

great.

4

where the problem would arise, but your question and

5

Justice Ginsburg's questions highlight another reason for

6

deference to Congress in that area, and that is that

7

Congress has to strive to make the laws of this nation

8

with respect to immigration and naturalization respond or

9

make sense vis-a-vis the laws of not just one other

10
11

There may be an isolated country here and there

nation, but many, many other nations.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, if Congress went back

12

to the way it when was everything was determined by the

13

14

Congress accepts your argument or we accept your argument

15

and say plenary power, they can do whatever they damn

16

please, so they say children born abroad of fathers who

17

are U.S. citizens can become U.S. citizens, but not

18

children who are born abroad of U.S. citizen mothers where

19

the father is an alien. That's the way it used to be in

20

the bad old days.

21

Congress wanted to go back to that, it would not offend

22

anything in the U.S. Constitution to do so.

23

I take it from your argument if

MR. KNEEDLER:

It would be subject to judicial

24

review, and under the facially legitimate bona fide

25

standard of Kleindienst v. Mandel and Fiallo, it would be
38

1

necessary to ask what Congress was up to in a situation

2

like that, so we are not suggesting that there is --

3

QUESTION:

Suppose Congress wants to restore the

4

way it was, the way it was for most of our Nation's

5

history, that the father's citizenship gets transferred to

6

the child, not the mother's?

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

Given the developments of equal

8

protection under the law in this country, this Court might

9

well conclude that it would not be facially legitimate for

10

Congress simply to decide to go back to as you described

11

it, the bad old days where all rights were thought to

12

derive from the father or the husband.

You said that might violate equal

protection, but even under some plenary power notion.
MR. KNEEDLER:

The standard that the Court

19

applied in Fiallo v. Bell was that -- was the facially

20

legitimate standard drawn from Kleindienst v. Mandel.

21

law is subject to scrutiny, and whatever rationale is

22

posited has to be regarded by this Court as legitimate.

The

Is there any case in all the area

24

where they do apply the lesser standard that has ever come

25

out against the government, against the classification
39

1

that Congress made?

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

I believe the Wauchope decision

3

that struck down the provision that you're referring to,

4

the pre-1934 decision, if I'm remembering correctly, the

5

Ninth Circuit decision I believe invalidated it under that

6

standard.

7
8

QUESTION:

Could the statute we're considering

here meet heightened scrutiny to think that applied?

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

We believe it could because

10

fundamentally what this is about is trying to put fathers

11

of children born out of wedlock abroad in a position where

12

they can do the same thing that a mother can in order to

13

put them on an equal plane with women.

14

product of trying to discriminate.

15

trying to put men or fathers in a position where they can

16

do the same thing that mothers can do.

why --

It is not a

Why wouldn't the simpler way to do

that be simply to have one uniform support or recognition

22

your -- on the factual assumptions that you are making,

23

which may well be true, it would be easier for the

children of American mothers born abroad to satisfy the

having differential standards.

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, if I may explain what, as

3

we understand it, is going on here precisely, and that is

4

that Congress made a judgment that it wanted, while the

5

child is still a minor, for there to be established a

6

legal, formal recognized relationship between parent and

7

child.

8

After the child is no longer a minor, at that

9

point the child is an adult and can seek citizenship in

his own right.

12

became an adult and did not do so.

13

In this very case, petitioner Nguyen could

one is under the care of the parent.

that's not so.

just biological paternity, but a recognized formal

18

relationship that outside people could look at and say,

19

yes, that is a father-child or mother-child relationship.

20

After adulthood,

So what Congress was focusing on was not

QUESTION:

So why not have the same criteria to

21

determine whether that relationship, if proven, is

22

adequate for citizenship purposes?

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

We believe that -- let me start

24

by explaining what the situation is for married parents.

25

When you have a child born to married parents, you have a
41

1

legal relationship with mother and father at the moment of

2

birth.

3

the father by virtue of the marriage to the mother.

4

marriage legitimates the child and establishes a legal

5

father-child relationship.

6

children, there is no lawful relationship -- or legal

7

relationship between man and woman, that in turn creates a

8

legal relationship between father and child.

9

else needs to be done.

With the mother by virtue of the birth and with

19

out is that it would be much easier for the child of the

20

American mother to prove the things that perhaps we would

21

all agree should be proven if citizenship is to be

recognized, but I don't see how it goes to the

justification of the differential standards.

You're talking to children not born

MR. KNEEDLER:

QUESTION:

Yes.

It used to be in the old days, even

18

though the mother bore the child, she was not the parent

19

that counted.

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

Prior to 1986 the only

21

way that that legal relationship could be established with

22

respect to the child who was born out of wedlock was by

23

legitimization, and --

MR. KNEEDLER:

QUESTION:

MR. KNEEDLER:

Because Congress --

Either way.
Because Congress decided that

4

derivative citizenship from a U.S. citizen should only

5

apply while the child is, in fact, a child.

6

formal legal relationship which can then be a springboard

7

for a practical relationship between parent and child, but

8

not only that, citizenship itself is a formal relationship

9

between the citizen and the country, and Congress could

10

reasonably conclude that in order to recognize a formal

11

legal relationship between a child in the United States, a

12

central element of that, the relationship of the child to

13

parent should have a comparable formality and recognition

14

so that it is recognized by the father and child and by

15

those looking at that relationship as not just a

16

biological relationship, perhaps even a deep biological

17

relationship, but a lawful, formal recognized one that the

18

rest of the world and this country can look to, because

19

citizenship, in fact, carries rights and responsibilities

20

on behalf of both the citizen and the nation, rights of

21

protection, rights of duties to serve in the Armed Forces,

22

and Congress could reasonably decide that it is not

23

sufficient that out there somewhere during a child's

24

minority there was someone who was a biological parent.

It is necessary that the formal legal relationship be

That is correct, unless and until

the father's paternity is formally established.
QUESTION:

Isn't that the crucial point? Isn't

it the case that if you were arguing this case 20 years
45

1

ago before DNA testing had become current, one of your

2

arguments and one that we might well accept would be,

3

there's a terribly difficult problem of proof here, and

4

one of the interests of the United States is to avoid

5

fraud in claims of citizenship. But that issue is gone

6

now, isn't it?

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

It's not entirely gone because

8

while DNA -- it's important not to focus solely on the

9

domestic situation in the United States in looking at this

10

law, and that goes both with respect to assumptions about

11

proving paternity and assumptions about what the law is or

12

ought to be. The other nations in the world are not

13

necessarily living under the same availability of medical

14

care, the same --

15

QUESTION:

Well, if that's the case, then the

16

proof of the relationship is simply going to be much more

17

difficult for the child who is in this other country

18

without the benefit --

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

20

QUESTION:

That's true, but the age 18 --

And how does the United States suffer

21

simply because under a nondifferential standard the child

22

abroad without a DNA lab nearby is going to have a tough

23

time proving the relationship?

24
25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, although the age 18 would

help to deter some fraudulent claims, but that's not our
46

principal submission here.

that the recognition of the legal relationship is itself a

legitimate interest, and in this respect we think this

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, Congress could reasonably

both mothers in wedlock and out of wedlock, that the legal

relationship is established at the moment of birth.

22

We think that's true for several

For one thing, if this Court were to broadly

23

declare that a whole new category of persons were United

24

States citizens there may be some question as to whether

25

Congress could undo that. That, coupled with the point
48

1

that this Court made in Ginsberg and Pangilinan that it's

2

questionable whether a court can ever declare someone to

3

be a citizen when Congress has not so declared, we think

4

way powerfully in the direction of striking section 1409

5

and letting Congress decide what is the proper remedy in

6

the situation.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, how does that differ

8

from the clause of the Constitution that says no money

9

shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of

10

appropriations made by law, no money, and yet you know the

11

whole line of cases from Frontier out to Wescott that this

12

Court thought was compatible with that clause.

13

see any difference, frankly, between those two.

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

I don't

Because in our view the admission

15

to citizenship is so central to the formation of our

society and -- our society under the Constitution that it

No money shall be drawn from the

you're describing, you're describing situations that arise

wholly in the domestic context. Here we have --

QUESTION:
question.

May I ask you just one brief

After our decision in Miller against Albright,
49

1

did anyone in Congress raise this issue for further

2

consideration, to your knowledge?

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

I'm not aware whether a bill was

4

introduced.

I did want to point out one further, one last

5

thing on the question of remedy. If one thing is clear

6

from 1940 until 1986, it is Congress did not want U.S.

7

citizenship to pass solely by virtue of mere biological

8

paternity.

9

and 1952 and 1986, in 1952.

Congress insisted on something more in 1940

10

In all of those situations, Congress moved to

11

make things easier for U.S. citizen fathers to transmit

12

citizenship.

13

which often meant marrying the mother, was adequate.

14

1986 Congress tried to ease things to make it easier for

15

U.S. citizen fathers to put themselves in the same

16

position as U.S. citizen mothers, by providing for the

17

acknowledgment of the child in writing so that it would

18

not be necessary to resort to the varying state laws

19

regarding legitimization or elsewhere.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARTHA F. DAVIS

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

6

MS. DAVIS:

Thank you.

First, in response to

7

Justice Stevens' question about whether or not any bill

8

was introduced in Congress, no, there was not.

9

Mr. Kneedler spent a great deal of time talking

10

about the legal relationship which he asserts is

11

automatically established at the time of birth between a

12

father and child.

the extent that that exists, it's a legacy of coverture

and common law discrimination which this Court has

previously condemned in Frontiero versus --

was correctly decided?

18

MS. DAVIS:

QUESTION:

20

Do you think Lehr against Robertson

I'm sorry?
Do you think Lehr against Robertson

was correctly decided?

21

MS. DAVIS:

Your Honor, I think it can be

22

distinguished from this case, aside from my view of its

23

propriety.

24

required the state to decide between competing parents,

25

and to do that quickly because of the emotional trauma

This -- in Lehr versus Robertson the issue

51

1

involved with the adoption.

2

Here there isn't any need to create a hierarchy

3

between parents, any need to create those kind of

4

classifications to make that decision proceed quickly, and

5

so therefore, the government interests are different --

6

QUESTION:

Is there a problem for the child in

7

Lehr?

Lehr, one of the grave concerns I thought was

8

holding up an adoption, holding up placing a child in a

9

secure setting.

Here you have none of that.

It would

10

benefit the child, surely, to be a U.S. citizen.

11

not hurting the mother. It's worlds different from Lehr.

12

MS. DAVIS:

Right.

You're

Exactly, Your Honor. And so,

13

no, I don't believe that a ruling in our favor in this

14

case would require this Court to reassess the decision in

15

Lehr.

16

In addition, the Court asked about the question

17

of the numbers that would be involved here, and there's no

18

indication in the legislative history that the Congress

19

has been concerned about that in looking at this statute,

20

as Mr. Kneedler just indicated.

21

In fact, the statute has progressively gotten

22

more liberal, and I think that that underscores the fact

23

that in -- as this Court looks at the intent of Congress

24

in crafting a remedy that the Court should take into

25

account, that Congress has progressively gotten more
52

liberal in addressing this issue.
Most recently in 1986, the Congress eliminated

effect on the additional numbers of individuals who could

6

seek transmission of citizenship under this law.

7

there was no mention of that in the legislative history as

view of this.

10

Now, that had presumably a significant
