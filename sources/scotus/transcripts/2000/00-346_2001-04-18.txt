ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES T. FERRINI

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. FERRINI: Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the
Court:

11

This is a decidedly local tort action which

12

defendant respectfully submits does not invoke a federal

13

uniformity interest; certainly it does not invoke a need

14

for such interest so compelling as to require this Court

15

to create or infer a wrongful death cause of action based

16

on general negligence under circumstances where there is

17

no claim of vessel liability.

18

case which would involve any concept endemic to or

19

originating in or peculiar to the sea.

20

concerned about seamen's responses; we are not concerned

21

about unseaworthiness or any form of vessel liability.

22

QUESTION:

What this case is not is a

We are not

Mr. Ferrini, how does your case

23

differ from the Kermarec case, the one this Court decided

24

in 1959?

25

MR. FERRINI:

In Kermarec, Your Honor, which

1

involved negligence, the negligence was negligence in the

2

operation of a vessel, either with it navigating or the

3

manner in which it was operated, but nothing like our case

4

where we have a local enterprise that was operating a

5

crane that was located on a pier over a --

6

QUESTION:

But it was -- that case did

7

recognize, didn't it, a claim for negligence under general

8

maritime law?

9

MR. FERRINI:

Your Honor, I believe it did, but

10

again, that was a case of a visitor on a vessel, and the

11

captain of the vessel had an obligation to make sure that

12

the stairway was in good condition, etcetera, but there

13

you're dealing with a concept which I think to be very

14

akin to that in Moragne.

15

a concept of the manner in which a vessel is operated, a

16

vessel is maintained for the safety of people on it, and

17

that is the kind of concept which requires uniform

18

treatment.

19

QUESTION:

What we're dealing with there is

But Moragne dealt with -- by its

20

terms at any rate -- with unseaworthiness, and the

21

question you've presented here is whether Moragne is a

22

basis for also extending that doctrine to negligence as

23

well as unseaworthiness, and yet in Kermarec it seems that

24

we've already recognized a general maritime claim for

25

negligence.

You feel this is different?

1

MR. FERRINI:

Your Honor, I think what we have

2

to do is look at the concept of uniformity in the context

3

of Article 3, Section 2 in the Federalist Papers, and

4

think in terms of why is it that this particular body of

5

law, as of all bodies of law there are -- this substantive

6

body of admiralty is given to this Court and to Congress,

7

and the purpose is so that the nation speaks with one

8

voice under circumstances where there can be an impact on

9

our relationship with our partners in trade.

10

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Ferrini, the question which

11

we granted certiorari, I thought, was whether a general

12

maritime law cause of action for wrongful death in

13

negligence exists or should exist.

14

whether Moragne should extend to wrongful death action

15

based on negligence, and I didn't -- have you raised below

16

the question of even if it does -- even if the answer is

17

yes, it should, it shouldn't apply here because these are

18

all land-based actors.

19

would be a logical defense to raise, but I don't see that

20

as part of the question.

21

MR. FERRINI:

22

QUESTION:

In other words,

I mean, I would have thought that

The way they are --

Suppose I say yes, Moragne extends to

23

wrongful death based on negligence, but does it extend to

24

totally land-based action like this?

25

that apparently.

You didn't raise

1

MR. FERRINI:

Your fourth circuit, Your Honor,

2

quite frankly, the focus of the court and the parties was

3

upon what does Moragne create rather than should it create

4

an exception.

5

QUESTION:

Well, answer my question.

Suppose I

6

say yes, Moragne, sure it extends to that.

7

saying that all along in dicta, at least.

8

yes.

9

whatever Moragne extends to, it doesn't apply to totally

10

We've been
Suppose I say

Is that open then to make your argument that

land-based actors like these?

11

MR. FERRINI:

Is that open?

I think it's certainly open, Your

12

Honor, because when we -- when you made your decision in

13

Moragne, the idea was not just is there a general cause of

14

action for all circumstances for wrongful death?

15

focus was on unseaworthiness and on maritime duties.

No, the

16

And by the same token, if you're going to here

17

decide if there is a wrongful death action created under

18

the Moragne rationale, if that much of Moragne is even

19

left existent, certainly I think this Court has the

20

jurisdiction to determine under what circumstances, and

21

just as --

22

QUESTION:

I just didn't think you raised that

23

here. I mean -- and we ended up with this very limited

24

question about whether Moragne, to the extend it applies

25

at all, extends to wrongful death actions based on

But these other questions I didn't think were

MR. FERRINI:

Your Honor, with all due respect,

4

I view our question as having been raised as whether there

5

is a wrongful death cause of action under the

6

circumstances with which the Court is presented.

7

QUESTION:

But you're arguing -- the limitation,

8

it seems to me -- death wouldn't matter.

It would be just

as land-locked if it had been mere injury, and that's the

question I'd like you to answer under the law as you see

18

MR. FERRINI:

19

QUESTION:

He would.

He would?

He would.

So, then you can't -- then

20

you're not making a distinction based on land-locked

21

versus something else; you're making a distinction based

22

on death versus injury.

23

MR. FERRINI:

In that respect I am, Your Honor,

24

because this Court has created a general maritime body of

25

law dealing with injury.

There is no two ways about that.

1

But the result would be different because that -- the fact

2

that the state law does not give the same remedy that that

3

general body of law gives is not an objective of

4

uniformity.

5

QUESTION:

But all of your -- your discussion

6

about state domain versus admiralty, maritime -- it seems

7

to fall apart when one recognizes that it can be the very

8

same accident.

9

no maritime responsibility if he's killed.

It's maritime if he's merely injured, but
And that seems

10

to be a hard line to explain to anyone, at least who's not

11

a lawyer.

12

MR. FERRINI:

Well, maritime law has been

13

described as one of the most complex areas, and it

14

certainly is a patchwork, and that is the historical

15

consequence of the way things developed.

16

QUESTION:

But you were giving something beyond

17

historical patchwork -- you were giving some kind of

18

rationale distinction between land-locked, sea duty,

19

Federal/state -- and I could accept all that were it not

20

for that the distinction is only death versus injury.

21

MR. FERRINI:

Well, I respectfully submit that

22

to create a monistic single area of law covering both

23

death and injury, the first thing this Court would have to

24

do is overrule the Tungus.

25

QUESTION:

Why?

It would have to overrule -Tungus just said you can take

the state wrongful death claim.

2

take Yamaha, where we, this Court recognized that you

3

could have a claim under the state wrongful death act.

4

took that position even on the assumption -- and it was

5

only an assumption in that case -- that you could also

6

have a claim under Moragne.

7

MR. FERRINI:

Doesn't -- well, let's

It

Yes, this Court did not decide,

8

however.

In footnote 7 we said -- this Court said we are

9

not deciding that there is such a cause of action, but I

10

take it a step further.

What this Court, I believe, was

11

assuming was the existence of a cause of action against

12

the manufacturer of a vessel, because that is what a jet

13

ski has been determined to be.

14

same concept of what is the purpose of uniformity?

15

don't think the purpose of uniformity is that all remedies

16

be the same in all circumstances, because that's exactly

17

what Your Honor said was not the objective of uniformity

18

in the Yamaha case.

QUESTION:

And it comes back to my
And I

But that was a case where you could

20

have both State and Federal remedies if there was a

Federal remedy, and we said if there was a Federal remedy,

22

that wouldn't preclude also having a state remedy.

MR. FERRINI:

I think it is very -- I think what

Your Honor is driving at is the possibility of concurrent

QUESTION:

Yes.

3

MR. FERRINI:

And I point out -- I hasten to

4

point out that that is the one thing my opponent has not

raised or urged, and why is that?

6

believe that that is consistent with uniformity.

7

uniformity -- the purpose of uniformity is going to be

8

that there is some semblance of reliability in knowing

11

insurance questions, your rates, everything is up in the

12

air, because we don't know in any individual death what

13

law the plaintiff is going to invoke.

14

QUESTION:

So then your answer must be in the

15

case of injury it's only maritime law -- it's only Federal

16

law, not state law.

17

MR. FERRINI:

I think that that is -- in the

18

case of injury, absolutely.

19

this existing body of law, and I don't think, however that

20

that -- that the fact that that is a solitary body of law

21

is a matter of uniformity.

22

QUESTION:

I agree with that.

There is

But regardless of whether it's a

matter of uniformity or not, if the Federal maritime law

MR. FERRINI:

2

QUESTION:

Well, just --

I mean, I think you -- I think maybe

3

I misunderstood your answer to several questions, but

4

going back to the Chief Justice's question about Kermarec,

5

I understood you to assume that yes, there is a general

6

maritime cause of action for negligence.

7

MR. FERRINI:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes.

And I understood you to have said

later on in the argument that if this individual had

10

merely been injured but had not been killed, that that

11

cause of action would apply.

12

question for us I think is why should we have a separate

13

regime when the negligence is efficient enough to cause

14

his death?

15

MR. FERRINI:

And if that's the case, the

First, I would like to correct an

16

answer I gave earlier to the Chief Justice.

I forgot -- I

17

believe Kermarec was an injury case and not a death case,

18

a totally different situation.

19

QUESTION:

It was an injury case, and I think

20

what we're driving at is why should it be a different

21

situation?

22

MR. FERRINI:

Again, it comes back to what this

Court sees as the purpose of uniformity.
QUESTION:

Well, before we get to uniformity,

what about irrationality?

The question is, why shouldn't we?

Because this Court never has,

Then I would ask --

What is the rational basis for

distinguishing the one from the other?
MR. FERRINI:

To me, Your Honor, because that

11

would be result-oriented.

12

in a situation where the State law is more favorable --

13
14

QUESTION:

You're going the other way then

Why is it result-oriented to have

symmetry in the law?

15

QUESTION:

Well, isn't your answer historical?

16

MR. FERRINI:

It's historical, and it's a

17

departure from the objective with which this Court is

18

granted the power of uniformity.

19

QUESTION:

Well, is the Court -- is the Court

20

wrong under uniformity to have Federal admiralty law with

21

reference to injuries?

22

MR. FERRINI:

I think, to be quite frank, that

23

things developed beyond a clear view of what the mission

24

of the Court was.

You don't agree with Moragne,

basically.

2

saying here about uniformity, you probably don't agree

with Moragne.

4

I mean, if -- if you're saying what you're

MR. FERRINI:

5

agree with Moragne.

6

QUESTION:

Not at all, Your Honor.

You do agree with Moragne?

I do

Well, I

7

really can't say why, having decided Moragne, we want to

8

draw the line between -- if indeed we didn't already cross

9

that bridge in Moragne -- I don't know why we would want

10
11

to draw a distinction between injury and death.
MR. FERRINI:

Because this Court has recognized

12

time and time again that you must treat everybody the

13

same, no matter where they are on the sea.

14

you're dealing with unseaworthiness, that vessel had

15

better be operational regardless of whether it's in

16

territorial waters or in the Sea of Japan or next door,

17

because everybody has -- let's put it this way, I think

18

uniformity -- the concept of uniformity is very similar to

19

the concept of the diversity of citizenship, which the

20

purpose of which is fair treatment of foreigners.

21

And when

And regardless if you're dealing with a seaman

22

who gets in, in Italy and he comes over here and he's

Doesn't Federal law do that in other

MR. FERRINI:

I can't comment on the full area,

17

but certainly the Tungus case said you take state law --

18

if you're taking state law, you take state law as it is

19

with the all the parts of it.

20

QUESTION:

Yes, but I wasn't asking you, the

21

state law in Tungus was the liability as well as who picks

it up.

you had Federal law, you would also have to invent who the

survivors are for purposes of wrongful death, and I'm

MR. FERRINI:

I don't see that as consistent

3

with uniformity but again, Your Honor, what I think the

4

Court is doing is proposing to fashion a remedy to benefit

5

an individual in very limited circumstances where the

6

bottom line is that the state application of state law,

7

consistent with this Court's majority concurring and

8

dissenting opinions in American Dredging, has no impact on

9

commerce.

I think we're losing sight of the objective in

10

order to fashion a remedy. I think that -- I would suggest

11

that --

12

QUESTION:

Again, if you're going to talk about

13

impact on commerce, there really can't be any difference

14

between injury and death, so I think once you concede that

15

the injury would be covered by Federal law, you can't make

16

an argument about the Commerce Clause that wouldn't apply

17

to both.

18

MR. FERRINI:

I do not believe that everything

19

this Court has developed in the way of substantive law for

20

injury is necessarily something that is required for

21

uniformity in the sense of the constitutional basis of it,

22

but rather a symmetry.

developed, but let me point out in Pope & Talbot, my

24

opponent points out that in that particular case, look,

25

they refused to apply the state contributory rule because

there was a Federal rule of comparative negligence.

That wasn't -- this Court didn't say that that

saying, look, we have considered -- we've already created

decision of this Court, a state can't take it away.

So that body of law is not representative as a

10

whole of a need for uniformity in all aspects of law.

11

respectfully submit that what I'm offering this Court is a

12

predictability, that we look as Professor Fore suggests to

13

our national interests -- that we look as this Court

14

suggested in American Dredging to the impairment of

15

commerce or to the Kamen court where the Court of Appeals

of New York looked to whether state law had

extraterritorial effect, and if it didn't have that kind

of effect, then there was no need for pre-emption.

in Moragne itself points in the direction of extending

of liability extends beyond the owners of the vessels to

There's nothing about that conduct of

something that -MR. FERRINI:

Well, I don't -- I don't purport

12

to give you an answer for every case that will arise in

the future, but I think that if that banana peel was

14

dropped by a crew member, you could have a breach of a

15

maritime duty, but if it was dropped by another visitor

and the crew had no chance to clean it up, that that's

negligence but that is not a breach of a maritime duty.

I would like to first address one of the points

maritime negligence law which has been dubbed vessel

16

negligence was raised below.

17

raised for the first time in the reply brief, and we

of land-based, is there any distinction between Robins and

this?

3

MR. O'DONNELL:

I would submit not.

He was

4

involved in the same activity, and he was injured in that

5

activity, and the Court recognized he had a general

6

maritime cause of action for negligence.

7

Robins, and the only distinction I can find in that is

8

that it was an injury versus a death case.

9

QUESTION:

So we do rely on

Well, why isn't that something that

10

the Court should now respect, even if it made no sense but

11

it was -- it emerges from the English common law, that

12

there was no common law action for wrongful death, and now

13

we have DOHSA and we have the possibility of picking up

14

State wrongful death acts for watery deaths.

15

Why couldn't one say, even if it made no sense,

16

this distinction between surviving injury and death?

17

the field is so occupied by statutes -- State wrongful

18

death statutes, DOHSA for death on the high seas -- that

19

the Court ought to stay out of it and leave it all to

legislation.

21

MR. O'DONNELL:

Now

I think what exists under a view

22

that Moragne does not extend to negligence-based wrongful

QUESTION:

Well, when you say gap, that just

3

means a situation unfavorable to the plaintiff in your

4

view, I take it.

5

MR. O'DONNELL:

Well, it's a gap in that the

6

Federal law does not permit it, but in this instance and

7

in other instances, what it will mean is that State law,

8

State law which incorporate principles which are directly

contrary to Federal maritime principles would govern, and

10

they would deny the remedy, and we would submit that in

that instance --

QUESTION:

Well, you say they're directly

What do you mean by that?
MR. O'DONNELL:

Well, for instance in Virginia,

15

the Virginia statutory employer statute says that in these

16

circumstances, Norshipco would be immune from suit whereas

17

the Federal statutory employer statute would reach the

18

exact opposite result.

of all there's a presumption that where Federal maritime

10

jurisdiction exists, Federal maritime law ought to apply.

11

We would also submit that in this very instance, the

12

Robins case would hold that maritime law ought to apply.

13

We would also say that the need for uniformity in the

14

administration of maritime law counsels in favor of

15

applying the Federal standards.

16

QUESTION:

Well, but you get to a point,

17

certainly, where you have to pick up some parts of the

18

various state regimes.

19

MR. O'DONNELL:

Well, if this Court recognizes a

20

Moragne negligence-based wrongful death action, I'm not

21

sure that's entirely true. I think what would happen in

22

those instances -- and what we are asking for is just that

QUESTION:

Well, if you're going to get a

2

wrongful death cause of action, you're going to have to

3

turn to State law to decide who the beneficiaries are, are

you not?

5

MR. O'DONNELL:

Well, perhaps with regard to --

6

to simply deciding the beneficiaries, but not the

7

liability.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, then, you say simply deciding.

You couldn't proceed without some scheme for deciding who

the beneficiaries are, could you?

11

MR. O'DONNELL:

Not in ultimately giving out the

12

remedies. That's true. But the fundamental liability

13

standards, we submit, must be governed by Federal maritime

14

law to preserve uniformity, and for that reason we think

15

that applying the State standard would get the Court

16

right, and the lower courts, right back into the Tungus

17

mess, whereas the Court is, the lower courts now have to

analyze every aspect of the State law in order to

determine which it would apply.

whether you could apply the State wrongful death act.

What do you think about Mr. Ferrini's

His point I think, if I understood it, is that

look, I agree -- imagining he's making this argument -- I

21

agree with you if a seaman is involved, you need a uniform

admiralty law. If the seaworthiness of the vessel is

involved, you need a uniform admiralty law. If a sea owner

is involved, you need a uniform admiralty law.

hadn't yet answered.

clear as the one Justice Breyer gave you which was --

18

yeah, you have, your argument is now that we take away the

19

limitations that Moragne is just unseaworthiness; it

20

applies to negligence as well; then we have Yamaha which

21

means that anyone in the situation of Mr. Garris or his

survivors has a choice between the state remedy or the

was.

it's something I have to worry about.

arguments, my deciding you are right in this case means

I've wiped out all the wrongful death actions belonging to

may not have understood it, but I thought what we were

MR. O'DONNELL:

No, Your Honor.

MR. O'DONNELL:

Why would it apply in the

QUESTION:

Yeah.

Why was the employer entitled

to invoke the bar under Virginia law?
MR. O'DONNELL:

Because that, unlike the

there's no prohibition on Norshipco using that bar even

MR. O'DONNELL:

They were paid under a Federal

QUESTION:

All right.

So ultimately it is a

Federal act that is the reason you have a bar.
MR. O'DONNELL:

No, because the Virginia bar

would apply whether or not he received funeral benefits

QUESTION:

Well, I'll think about it. I still

ultimately there's -- it's, ultimately it's the existence

of the Longshore Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, and the

MR. O'DONNELL:

MR. O'DONNELL:

If you are the -- if you're in

there's no exception to it as there is under --

QUESTION:

It's much --

And because your subsidiary paid

QUESTION:

All right.

Thank you.

QUESTION:

Would you go back to Robins.

You

6

pointed out in your argument a second ago that the Court

in Robins had made the remark that negligence in the

8

course of this kind of repair work is not a matter of

9

purely local concern, that it was properly maritime.

10

Has there been any litigation -- and sorry, and

11

what I further assume to be the case is that the cause of

12

action that Robins recognized if it were to have a

13

counterpart, it had a parallel in state law because Robins

14

didn't say it was a purely maritime issue.

15

as I understand it, left State law wherever it might be,

and I presume there would have been a State law negligence

action as well.

that there was a State law negligence action parallel to

can you tell me whether there has been any litigation in

the ensuing sixty years, I guess, on the issue of whether

light of the fact that there is also a Federal cause of

MR. O'DONNELL:

Well, it's -- I would concede

2

it's a confusing area.

I don't know if there is any case

3

that -- first of all, with regard to Robins, I don't read

Robins as preempting State wrongful death statutes

In a non-conflict situation,

MR. O'DONNELL:

I'm not aware of anything except

-- and as Justice Ginsburg points out, Yamaha did not

precisely deal with this issue of negligence, but in

Yamaha, I don't read any suggestion that the existence of
