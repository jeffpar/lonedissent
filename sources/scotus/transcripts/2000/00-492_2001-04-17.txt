ORAL ARGUMENT OF SANDRA JEAN STEWART

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

We'll hear argument

MS. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
We are here today not because a possibly

11

innocent man was unjustly convicted nor are we here

12

because he was possibly denied a constitutional right nor

13

are we even here because he possibly was denied one of the

14

rudimentary demands of a fair trial.

15

today to resolve whether or not a guilty man should escape

16

his just punishment as a result of a technical violation

17

of a statute.

18

We are simply here

Specifically, the question presented here is

19

whether or not Michael Bozeman is entitled to have his,

20

was entitled to have his indictment dismissed with

21

prejudice as a result of a one-day transfer from Federal

22

custody into State custody for purposes of arraignment and

23

appointment of counsel.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, that's the clear provision of

Article IV(e) of the Interstate Agreement, here, on

Detainments.

2

there that the court shall enter an order dismissing with

3

prejudice an indictment or complaint if he isn't tried

4

immediately.

5

It couldn't be more clearly provided in

MS. STEWART:

Clearly the language, when it's

6

read in isolation, seems to indicate that the indictment

7

must be dismissed with prejudice --

8

QUESTION:

Yeah, that's what it says.

9

MS. STEWART:

-- but the language simply can't

10

be read in isolation.

11

background principle of harmless error, which was in

12

existence at the time the IAD was passed.

13

QUESTION:

It has to be read against the

Well, I would think you maybe ought

14

to just seek an amendment of the agreement. It's just

15

clear.

16

MS. STEWART:

Well, there's a question whether

17

or not the parties to the agreement can actually amend the

18

agreement.

19

involving 48 different states.

20

QUESTION:

21
22

24
25

This is not a -- this is an interstate compact

time they want?

Can Alabama just get out of it any

How does that work?

MS. STEWART:

They would have to go to their

legislature and repeal participation.
QUESTION:

But the State could through this

legislature just withdraw from the whole country?

1

MS. STEWART:

Yes, according to the act itself,

2

it could withdraw from the whole Act itself, but to do so

3

it would have to give up certain rights that are bestowed

4

upon it in the Act that are very beneficial to the States

5

in disposing of detainers.

6

QUESTION:

Supposing there was an effort to

7

amend this provision, if it proves that you're wrong about

8

the -- how could it be done?

9
10
11
12
13

MS. STEWART:

Could Congress alone do it?

Congress could not unilaterally

change the provision of the compact.
QUESTION:

Congress did it, didn't it, for

Federal prisoners?
MS. STEWART:

Congress did do it in Section 9 of

14

the Agreement, but when Congress passed the original

15

Agreement in Section 7, they reserved to themselves the

16

right to amend the agreement.

17

Alabama, do not have such a reservation clause in the

18

Agreement, which would make it more difficult certainly to

19

amend the Agreement. Now, there are some other States that

20

have amended the Agreement unilaterally, but it's not been

21

challenged whether or not that was permitted --

22

permissible under the Agreement itself.

23

QUESTION:

Other States, specifically

Well, you shouldn't sign agreements

24

that say this then if you don't intend to abide by it.

25

just couldn't be clearer.

It just says if trial is not

It

had, the information or complaint shall not be of any

2

further force and effect, and the court shall enter an

3

order dismissing.

4

that if it wasn't prepared to abide by it.

5

Why did your State sign that, adopt

MS. STEWART:

Well, the State adopted the

6

Agreement partially -- certainly because of the benefits

7

to it, but it also adopted the Agreement against the

8

background principle that harmless errors shouldn't apply.

9

QUESTION:

I do not know a background principle

10

that overcomes the explicit mandate of a statute, shall

11

enter an order dismissing the same. Do you have cases that

12

simply don't talk about where the implied effect of a

13

provision in most cases is to cause dismissal of the suit,

14

we won't let it happen when there's been no substantial

15

prejudice, that I can understand, but here you have

16

language that is categorically mandatory.

17

MS. STEWART:

No, Your Honor, I do not have a

18

case where this Court has specifically held harmless error

19

applicable where there is a specific type of remedy such

20

as this contained within the Agreement.

21

QUESTION:

Isn't there a broader problem? And I

22

have the same difficulty, I guess, with the Government's

23

de minimis argument, and that is, it's true there is a --

24

there is a, as you put it, a sort of background principle

25

of the harmless error doctrine, and there's a background

1

de minimis, but I don't think that there is a background

2

to the effect that these either/or of these doctrines may

3

be used to excuse an intentional and systematic series of

4

violations of the statute, and it seems to me that that is

5

what you are arguing for.

6

move the person for two days for an arraignment here, we

will continue to do it or we should be entitled to

8

continue to do it, and even though that's a technical

9

violation of the statute, we would in each case be excused

You're saying not only would we

10

on harmless error. Do you know of any instance in which

11

harmless error or de minimis, for that matter, has been

12

used in effect to excuse a systematic violation of the

13

statute?

14

MS. STEWART:

I do not know of a case where that

15

has been done.

16

intentional violation act would certainly, whether or not

17

it was intentional, would be a part of the harmless error

18

analysis, and here I don't think there was an intentional

19

act whatsoever. I think the prosecutor simply misread the

20

Act and dropped the ball, and as a result Mr. -- if this

21

Court holds that dismissal is required, then of course

22

then the result, the purposes of this Act have not been

23

maintained --

However, I would say, number one, that an

2

the value of making this transfer so that somebody who is

3

not willing to waive arraignment can at least get counsel

4

appointed and get the ball rolling toward prosecution, and

5

I thought you were making the broader argument, not merely

6

that this was a one-time mistake, but that for the good

7

reasons that support this procedure, we ought as a general

8

matter to apply harmless error whenever it occurs.

9

It is -- I mean, I can certainly see

MS. STEWART:

Mr. Justice Souter, I am making

10

the broader argument that harmless error should apply to a

11

statute unless there's an indication of an intent contrary

12

to it that says that harmless error should not apply, and

13

it's my position that this statute does not indicate such

14

an intent that harmless error should not apply.

15

QUESTION:

How do we know it's harmless?

16

MS. STEWART:

QUESTION:

So you're going to put him in the

QUESTION:

Right.

But you have the indictment before

you get him, is that right?

MS. STEWART:

QUESTION:

That's correct.

So what's he coming for, just the

trial?
MS. STEWART:

Under the Act, that is the

10

purposes, he's supposed to -- if you read the language in

11

its technical, in its -- on its face, then, yes, that

12

seems to be the only purpose which you can bring him to.

13

QUESTION:

The only reason that a State -- Joe

Smith is in California.

15

Act, you're bringing him, you're under this Act in Article

16

VI, you don't even want to see him until you're ready to

go to trial, is that the theory of it?

MS. STEWART:

That seems to be the theory, if

you read it, on its face.

How do trials work in that State?

1

Don't you sometimes have to see a defendant before he goes

2

to trial?

3

MS. STEWART:

Absolutely.

And that is why this

4

individual was brought to Alabama, to have the appointment

5

of counsel.

6

QUESTION:

So this must come up all the time, I

7

mean, you bring a person into the State, we say it's not,

8

we're not ready for trial yet, but we're going to the

9

arraignment or we're going to have a hearing on

10

suppression or a lot of things.

11

MS. STEWART:

12

QUESTION:

Certainly.

All right.

So what are they thinking

13

in this, there might be lots of instances where there are

14

days that pass between bringing him into the State and

15

trying him, and what's supposed to happen in that time?

16

Are you supposed to always keep him in a county jail, even

17

if you're in Maryland, and in fact the other prison

18

happens to be two feet away in Virginia?

19
20
21
22
23

MS. STEWART:

And the State of Alabama's

position is, no, you don't always have to keep them there.
QUESTION:

But that's what it says.

So what are

they thinking?
MS. STEWART:

I think that's not what it says.

24

I think that there's enough ambiguity in the statute that

25

is not required that you keep them there until trial.

QUESTION:

Well, you said the prosecutor dropped

the ball, I think candidly, which leads to Justice

would have stayed in the county jail and not, and would

not be returned to the original place where we get can get

MS. STEWART:

QUESTION:

Right.

Yes.

Can he be brought to another State

for questioning just to meet with police officials?

16

MS. STEWART:

QUESTION:

18

MS. STEWART:

Certainly.

Or is it just a court proceeding?
Certainly he can be brought to

19

another State just for questioning or for other purposes,

20

but the position of Mr. Bozeman is that under the Act you

21

can only bring him for trial.

22

is that, no, there are other reasons you can bring him

under detainer to Alabama.

QUESTION:

No, that's not the question that's

The reason I ask is the only sense I

4

can make out of it, given the realities, is this is some

5

kind of prophylactic rule, and the prophylactic rule would

6

be, we know it's nutty in a lot of circumstances, but

7

nonetheless the only way to get the States to move off the

8

dime is to insist that they try him before they send him

back, even if the jail's next door to the prison he came

10

from.

11

de minimis violation.

12

Now, if it's a prophylactic rule, you don't have a

MS. STEWART:

And certainly this Act was passed,

13

this remedial legislation, it was passed specifically to

14

address certain problems that occurred as a result of

15

detainers, there being no formal procedures, and there

16

being no way to bring an inmate into a State and have the

17

detainers disposed of, and to do so in such a way that it

18

didn't interfere with the rights to rehabilitation, that's

19

the specific purposes behind this Act.

20

Act specifically says that it should be construed in such

21

a way as to effectuate those purposes, and to construe

22

this Act as requiring dismissal of the indictment is not

23

going to effectuate those purposes.

presumably agree with you in the normal case?

They are interested in the

But why can't that be achieved by just

MS. STEWART:

Supposedly you could, you know,

7

theoretically you certainly could ask for a waiver, but

8

that is not what happened in this case, and it shouldn't

9

be required that you ask for a waiver in order to --

10

QUESTION:

Why not?

I mean, if everybody is

11

fully informed about the statute and the procedures, why

12

couldn't that interest be adequately protected by saying,

13

counsel, here's the problem, we can't try this fellow for

14

another 30 days, so we'd rather -- we can either let him

15

stay here in the county jail or go back to his regular

16

rehabilitation program and then give the person the

17

choice.

18

MS. STEWART:

We could give the person the

19

choice, but certainly again that could just simply lead to

20

more litigation, and whether or not he understood what he

21

was waiving and what right he had, and also we have to get

22

him here practically in Alabama, the practical way, you

have to get the person into Alabama before you can appoint

QUESTION:

Well, but that just means that

2

instead of a 24-hour turnaround, make it 48 hours, so you

prisoner would say, yes, it makes more sense to go back,

but assuming I guess he lived in Alabama, didn't he?

9

That's part of the problem.

10

MS. STEWART:

I would think very often the

Yes, he did, Justice Stevens.

11

Certainly that's one way that this Act could be

12

implemented, but the State's position is that that's not

13

required under the Act because simply the transfer did not

14

violate --

15

QUESTION:

Well, it's clearly required if you

16

read it literally, but you're sort of saying for this

reason we should not read it literally and therefore it's

not required.

MS. STEWART:

QUESTION:

21

MS. STEWART:

Yeah.
And of course this Court, at the

time that this case was decided and at the time we were

talking about whether or not Mr. Bozeman, whether his

rights had been violated by the transfer, this Court had

not decided New York v. Hill and decided whether or not

1

waiver applied to the Act, and similarly the argument made

2

there was that because the Act said that it shall be, that

3

if there's a violation of the 120-day provision that the

4

Act shall be -- or the indictment shall be dismissed with

5

prejudice, that waiver shouldn't apply because and that

6

the Act specifically should say whether it should or

7

shouldn't.

8

QUESTION:

There was an enormous difference, Ms.

9

Stewart, between that case and this one, and that is the

10

defendant did something that caused -- the defendant was

11

sitting right there, and agreed to something, here the

12

defendant hasn't agreed to anything at all.

13

thing to say a defendant can't say, yeah, go ahead and try

14

me and then the trial date comes and he says, uh-huh, it's

15

too late.

16

So it's one

Here the defendant didn't do one thing.
MS. STEWART:

I think there is a significance in

17

that that case involved waiver, but it's not for the

18

purposes of the argument that I'm making which is that the

19

IAD was silent on whether or not waiver principles applied

20

to it, just as it's silent as to whether or not harmless

21

error principles apply to it.

22

because it was silent and because the general principle,

23

there's a presumption that waiver applies that waiver

24

should apply there.

25

harmless error is, there's a presumption that it applies

This Court held that

Similarly, I'm arguing that because

1

to statutes as well as to constitutional errors that it

2

should apply in this case.

3

QUESTION:

It seems it would apply then in every

4

case, and here was a prosecutor who made a perfectly

5

reasonable choice were it not for this IAD to say, we're

6

going to turn him around in 24 hours, just want to arraign

7

him and send him back, but the literal reading of this

8

cuts the other way, and if you don't hold prosecutors to

9

that literal reading, then every case would be harmless,

10

and must, shall would have no teeth at all.

11

MS. STEWART:

I don't think that every case

12

would result in harmful error.

13

a perfect example where there was no harm -- I'm sorry, I

14

got that back --

15

QUESTION:

16

MS. STEWART:

Certainly in this case is

I'm saying there would be -Certainly there are cases where

there would be harm to the defendant by the transfer, for

MS. STEWART:

result, and it wouldn't be given for, you know, another

the defendant, so there could be harm from a single day

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

11
12

Very well, Ms. Stewart.

MR. LAMKEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

13

As the majority of Federal courts have held, a

to lose his place in programs and then he would also, may

lose his priority --

3

QUESTION:

That's the -- the interruption part

4

wouldn't.

I mean, if he was in the county jail for a

5

month or a year and then they sent him back, the sending

6

back wouldn't cause any problem.

7

MR. LAMKEN:

That's correct, Your Honor. Our

8

view is that the interruption is what is de minimis in

9

this case, and when the interruption is merely for an

10

overnight period, it does not cause a disruption in the

11

inmate's participation in programs of rehabilitation in

12

the original institution of confinement.

13

long period of interruption, in contrast, the inmate would

14

have to start over in the programs or could possibly lose

15

his place as priority of the programs, depending on the

16

institution, so we believe that, yes, in fact, there could

17

be a longer interruption that would cause harm to the --

the interests of the prisoner, why isn't the waiver the

get waivers, but in our experience this situation arises

because of miscommunications.

States attorney's office was not aware of that detainer.

Consequently, when they obtained custody of the prisoner,

they said -- the magistrate specifically asked, is there a

5

no.

QUESTION:

But we can't make the law take care

7

of miscommunication within the United States Department of

Justice, can we?

9

what's going on?

10

We've got to assume everybody knows

MR. LAMKEN:

Of course, Your Honor, but the rule

11

of de minimis that when the event is so insubstantial in

12

relationship to the purposes of the statute, the law does

13

not take cognizance of it, and a single overnight

14

transfer, like the one at issue here, is insubstantial in

15

relationship to the purposes of the prohibition, and that

16

purpose is to ensure rehabilitation of the prisoner and

17

the prisoner's participation in the rehabilitation

18

program.

19

QUESTION:

Yeah, but to the extent you rely on

20

the interests of the prisoner, it seems to me that

21

interest is totally protected by a simple requirement that

22

he can waive because he would presumably have counsel to

23

advise him, listen, you're better off if you go back and

24

continue your program. I just don't understand why the

25

waiver isn't a complete answer.

MR. LAMKEN:

Your Honor, it's not a complete

2

answer for two reasons.

First, one, oftentimes prisoners

3

would prefer that there is a mistake and that they

4

actually got sent back and the indictment be dismissed,

5

and second, there is an interest in the institution, the

6

sending institution in receiving the prisoner back because

7

it's the State's interest to ensure that its prisoners are

8

undergoing the rehabilitation programs that they are

9

providing, and when the prisoner is away for an undue

10

period of time, such as the sometimes lengthy period

11

between arraignment and trial, they are not participating

12

in those numerous programs, and it is to the State's

13

detriment, and so in that sense, although we often rely on

14

the prisoner as in the context of waiver to --

15

QUESTION:

Was this the essential rationale for

the Act, that the prisoner have these correctional

entitled to impose its punishment for retribution

purposes?

20

MR. LAMKEN:

The Act has twin purposes, and the

21

two purposes are, one, to set up a system of an

22

expeditious system whereby States could obtain prisoners

23

from other jurisdictions and exact their punishment or

24

impose the penalties prescribed by law, and the other

4

QUESTION:

Would the Act have been complied with

5

here if the prisoner, instead of being returned to

6

Florida, the Florida prison, had gone to some other prison

7

because it says he has to be returned to the original

8

place of imprisonment?

9

MR. LAMKEN:

Your Honor, if one were to read the

10

language quite literally, they could have sent him to a

11

Federal institution, for example, in some other part of

12

Alabama, and it would not have invoked the literal

13

language of the statute, and dismissal would not have been

14

required.

15

2

require dismissal with prejudice, there were two courts of

3

appeals that were to the contrary, and Congress therefore

stepped in with a different rule and amended the Act as it

5

was entitled to do under Article -- under Section 7 of the

6

implementing legislation.

7

QUESTION:

But States couldn't replicate that

8

because they all have to be bound by the same, is that so

9

or don't you know what is the answer to that?

10

MR. LAMKEN:

The Fourth Circuit has addressed

11

that issue in a case called Bush v. Muncie, and it's not a

12

matter of any clarity, but it appears that it would be

13

somewhat difficult for a State to unilaterally amend its

14

implementing legislation without withdrawing unless it, as

15

Congress did in Section 7, had expressly reserved that

16

right, and then if it had, if it did enact the provision

17

that was inconsistent with the Agreement, there would be

18

an issue among the States as to whether or not those

19

States were willing to give that amending State the

20

benefits of the Agreement, notwithstanding its departure

21

in some degree.

QUESTION:

Wouldn't the easy way to do it,

5

tough.

6

I mean, that wouldn't be all that

MR. LAMKEN:

Oh, for 48 states to arrive at the

7

Agreement, to pass it as implementing legislation in each

8

of those 48 states and to get Congress to pass on the

9

compact is a somewhat arduous, although it is potentially

10

viable prospect. However, we believe that just as Congress

11

resolved, in effect, a 4-2 circuit conflict in favor of

12

the rule of de minimis and in favor of permitting these

13

returns, we believe that this Court could take cognizance

14

of the rule of de minimis as well and rule that because a

15

single overnight transfer is so unlikely to interfere with

16

the purposes of the Act that it falls within the rule of

17

de minimis and therefore should not result in harsh

consequence of complete frustration of the State's efforts

to enforce its criminal laws.

MR. LAMKEN:

Next best case would probably be

7

case after that would probably be Anderson v. Yungkau.

8

Those cases all involved intentional conduct that was in

9

violation of a specific prohibition, but in each of those

cases this Court contemplated that because the conduct

itself was of de minimis proportion in relation to the

recognition that there are some applications that are so

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
All courts that have taken up the issue of the

7

Interstate Agreement on Detainers have recognized the

8

mandatory language, the only issue to be resolved is

9

whether or not that language is given effect. Ms. Stewart

10

stated that one of the reasons that Alabama joined the IAD

11

was because there were certain benefits to the State, and

12

I believe that there's a sort of implied consent doctrine

13

that's at issue here that if the State joins the IAD and

14

the prosecutor takes the initiative to place a detainer,

15

because that's the only way that this Act is activated, is

16

by the placing of a detainer, then they have to be bound

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

From IV(c), the arrival of the

QUESTION:

All right, maybe that's it.

I can

read those, but you don't want to say -- okay, maybe

that's the answer.

15

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

I think so.

I think also

16

since we are on the time period that's contained in IV(e),

17

the 120 days, I believe that that also militates against a

18

finding of harmless error or a requirement that one has to

show prejudice. Certainly 120 days is in the vast majority

of cases is going to be nowhere near what the

QUESTION:

Well, but there are many cases in

which the Federal prison is right across the street from

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Yes, and there is a special

provision in the IAD for that, Justice Kennedy, where the

10

Federal Government can maintain custody of a prisoner and

11

merely make them available for trial without turning over

12

the temporary custody. That's not the situation here, but

13

that -- in those cases, that would be a perfectly good,

14

logical ending, keeping with the statute.

3

I would like to talk about the Federal circuits

4

because I'm, even though I concede that there is a

5

majority that have said something to the effect that a

6

brief transfer doesn't harm a prisoner's rehabilitation,

7

but I find that those statements are in many cases are

8

dicta or not persuasive, and these cases all tend to be

9

somewhat incestuous also in that they rely upon one

10

another. The earliest is a Chico case from the Second

Circuit which would not have --

QUESTION:

Mr. Christensen, can I ask you,

before you get on to that, why one couldn't read the

simply does not apply to bringing somebody in for pretrial

18

matters.

19

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

I would disagree with that,

20

Justice Ginsburg, because the Act itself says that it

21

applies when there's a detainer and someone has been

22

brought in for purposes of prosecution. Now, if you've

placed a detainer on someone for questioning or as a

QUESTION:

Well, how could -- how could this

have been done?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

An arraignment is certainly

part of a prosecution.

says I want him here for one day.

11

To avoid this trap of

somebody up for purpose other than trial?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Certainly.

You can have a

12

hearing and ask the prisoner to waive.

13

fact, this Court in United States versus Mauro, which is

14

the first IAD case that this Court has dealt with, the

15

Court clearly agreed with the idea that Ford had waived

16

the antishuttling provision.

17

trial provision, and so this Court affirmed the dismissal

18

of his indictment, and I would also point out that that

19

was without any requirement that he had been prejudiced by

20

this and he was brought to trial within about five months

21

of having been transferred into the receiving State, which

22

is just over the 120 days, so I would suggest to this

Court that you have dealt with this issue of prejudice

before and resolved it in favor of the prisoners.

I mean, what are they trying to do? Once the

person gets out, you know, once you take the prisoner in

for a preliminary proceeding or something, it interferes

4

with his rehabilitation in the initial prison more rather

5

than less to keep him in the State.

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Well, and that's a presumption

that is perhaps intuitive but one that I'm not convinced

is borne out by the facts, and in the record below here

9

there simply is nothing.

10

12

QUESTION:

That issue was not dealt with.

I'm asking for your experience as a

criminal lawyer.
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Mr. Bozeman has informed me

13

that he lost his position as a barber in the prison at

14

Mariana because of the one day transfer, so he was

prejudiced, although that's not in the record below.

in this case.

looked at all these statutes, what's your view of what the

20

theory of this thing is? How is it really supposed to work

21

because intuitively I'd think that a person who comes from

22

a preliminary hearing, the longer he stays away, the worse

23

things are, but this provision seems to force the State to

24

keep him away.

QUESTION:

But if you're bringing somebody in

many detainers from so many different jurisdictions that I

feel quite certain that the Second Circuit was looking for

any reason whatsoever to keep from excusing him.

had another case in the Seventh Circuit which referred to

the Second Circuit case and to the Chico case, and in fact

the same transfer was complained about in the Second

The Taylor case that Mr. Lamken mentioned does

Mr. Roy

say that a brief transfer doesn't happen, but the prisoner

there asked to be transferred back to State custody.

There's quite clearly a waiver, although the Court for

some inexplicable reason doesn't seem to reach that.

inexplicable that these courts have this Federal amendment

available to them, but it's evidently not being used

because none of the opinions that I've found have done

more than mention it in a footnote.

QUESTION:

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

I find it somewhat

Well, were these Federal prisoners?
Yes, sir.

So they could get, the State could

get, the Government could get the advantage of the Federal
amendment?

11

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Yes, all these are cases where

12

the United States was the receiving State.

The Eighth

13

Circuit Baxter case mentions this but it's again citing

14

Chico, Taylor, and Roy, but it really resolves the issue

15

on the fact that Mr. Baxter was transferred by writ of

16

habeas corpus ad prosequendum before a detainer had been

17

lodged, so it really doesn't add to the argument other

18

than to saying, yes, us, too, and the Ninth Circuit

19

Johnson case simply comes down saying well, we've looked

20

through and this is what the majority thinks, and we think

21

that also.

22

I would also point out that another reason I

23

believe this cannot be de minimis or harmless error is

24

that we tend to focus in on the phrase, the Court shall

25

enter an order dismissing with prejudice, but there's also
43

1

a self-executing clause in there, it seems that by the

2

transfer itself, ex operi operato, the indictment becomes

3

without further effect.

4

believe that it requires an objection prior to trial to

5

preserve that, just like any sort of defect in an

6

indictment would require, yet it's not something that you

7

can apply harmless error or de minimis analysis to.

8
9

Now, that is something that I

If the -- it seems somewhat redundant to have,
then having the court enter a ruling dismissing the charge

10

but I believe that that's to prevent the prosecutor from

11

coming back and reindicting on these same charges, and it

12

also recognizes that there really is no indictment,

13

self-executing clauses being somewhat difficult to enforce

14

otherwise.

15

I would also point out, it's not very difficult

16

for the States to follow these rules.

It's laid out quite

17

clearly.

18

the red brief, the prosecutor had ample opportunity to

19

know what the statute said and to follow the rules.

20

even had notice from Mr. Bozeman himself who had filed a

21

pro se motion objecting to a prior transfer that said the

22

IAD requires dismissal.

23

I believe, would be saying that a prosecutor can do

24

whatever he or she pleases and that they hope to be able

25

to get away with it by claiming that it's harmless.

In this particular case, as I have set out in

1

As a practical matter, a trial court judge is

2

almost always going to rule that an error is harmless.

3

He's going to rule against the prosecutor unless there is

4

some real teeth given to the wording of the statute.

5
6

QUESTION:

Against the prosecutor or against the

defendant?

7

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Against the defendant. Well,

8

it is a sanction, I suppose, against the prosecutor and

9

they understandably don't like that because it's so rare

10

that that happens, and as a defense lawyer, it gives me

11

that small bit of cheer to occasionally have the upper

12

hand.

13

think that there are going to be endless hearings on

14

whether or not harm has taken place if this Court rules

15

that harmless error can apply.

16

strict language applies, the Court needn't -- merely see,

17

has there been a transfer, and if so, has there been a

waiver.

And also, this statute provides a bright line.

Thank you, Mr. Christensen.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SANDRA JEAN STEWART
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. STEWART:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

7

Just a few points.

I wanted to point out, the respondent

8

has conceded that there are some exceptions to the actual

9

wording of section, of Article IV(e), he has conceded that

10

the language is not that clear and that there might have

11

to be some construction of that statute in order to make

12

it effectuate its purposes.

13

Also, it's very important to point out that the

14

agreement was not just for the benefit of the prisoner

15

here, this agreement was entered into for the benefit of

16

the party States as well as for the benefit of the

17

prisoner, and that purpose is specifically stated in

18

Article I, and it is one of the purposes that needs to be

19

considered in determining whether or not a harmless error

20

analysis should apply.

21

In response to Justice Stevens' question about

22

waiver and whether or not we could just have the prisoner

23

waive, I think it's important to point out that the

24

respondent has argued that one of the problems with

25

implementing harmless error is it would lead to additional
46
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

litigation in the trial courts, and I would point out that

2

if we have a hearing every time we need to determine

3

whether or not the prisoner wants to waive the right, then

4

again we're going to have additional litigation, so either

5

way we're going to come up with additional litigation.

6

In answer to Justice Breyer's question about

7

what's the purpose behind Article IV(e), I think it's

8

simply meant to implement Article IV(c), and it's a way to

9

bring the prisoner over, and we need to have him here,

10

dispose of the charges, and bring him back, but I don't

11

think the purpose is to give the prisoner some sort of

12

benefit, some sort of way to have the charges disposed of

13

short of a trial.

14

Finally, Mr. Bozeman made no argument below

15

about harm and that he suffered any harm, so it should not

16

be considered here, and if this Court has no further

17

questions, I thank you.
