ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. EDLIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. EDLIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

The decision of the Second Circuit adopting a

11

scope of employment test should be rejected and reversed

12

for three principal reasons.

13

employment test cannot be reconciled with the plain

14

language of the statute.

15

contrary to this Court's decision in Reves, as well as in

16

Turkette and as well as in Scheidler.

decision below would unnecessarily eviscerate the ability

18

of private litigants in the Government to bring 1962(c)

19

actions.

QUESTION:

Are we talking about only a really

odd situation?

A situation where we're talking about one

individual?

clearly applies, but we're only talking about a

6

circumstance where there's just like one person.

Because if there are several individuals in a

MR. EDLIN:

I think the problem with the Second

problem.

14

person, and the rest of the corporation is the enterprise,

15

I see no problem with that case.

16

this case.

17

introduction of the corporate form changes things, and

18

whether it's a one-person corporation or a multiple-person

19

corporation, the issue is precisely the same.

Clearly if you have a corporation that has many

I think the problem with the Second

Circuit's decision is that it may well say the same thing.

it seemed to me in any real corporation it's not going to

2

be following what the corporation wants to commit a crime,

3

so it's not in the scope of your employment to commit a

4

crime.

5

you're suddenly -- unless we're talking about a

6

corporation that wants to go off and commit crimes, the

7

person's never going to be acting in the scope of his

8

employment, so always he's caught within the statute.

9

there's, you know, several people, certainly.

10

And so under the Second Circuit's rule, unless

If

Am I right?

Can you explain that very clearly?

11

MR. EDLIN:

The problem that we have with the

12

Second Circuit's decision is that it is hard to

13

rationalize with the meaning of the statute and with the

14

Court's decision in Reves.

15

confers liability on all inside managers.

16

it does, it certainly confers liability on all inside

17

managers.

18

would be included within the operation and management test

19

that this Court adopted there.

20

Reves clearly, for example,
Whatever else

There's no question under Reves that Mr. King

The Second Circuit's decision immunizes

21

precisely the same group of people, or a single person,

22

that Reves would impose liability upon.

23

Circuit's decision is not limited and does not distinguish

24

between corporations in which there is one principal party

25

or corporations in which there are many parties.

I agree with you the scope of management test

2

doesn't really work, but it's because it doesn't work.

3

It's not because the Second Circuit has limited it to just

4

this fact item.

5

QUESTION:

In any case, I was going to ask

6

basically the same question.

7

scope of management test includes at least, as I assume it

8

must, some reference to the purposes of the corporation,

9

then no corporation, whether it's a regular corporation or

It seems to me that if the

10

a pure formality, can be organized as a matter of law to

11

commit acts of racketeering.

12

the Second Circuit's opinion is the notion that one would

13

be within the scope of employment while engaging in the

14

prohibited activities.

15

was a legal impossibility.

16

MR. EDLIN:

17

So the odd thing to me about

And I would have thought that that
Am I missing something?

Your Honor, I -I should ask your opponent that

question, but just to stir him up -MR. EDLIN:

If you're missing something, I am

20

too, and I am eager to hear an answer from Mr. Fleming on

21

that question.

22

RICO reaches both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises

23

and, in the context of the illegitimate enterprise, scope

24

of employment analysis makes no sense at all.

25

think that when you look at what the Second Circuit is

But even beyond the corporation, certainly

So I just

1

doing, it can't be reconciled with what the words of the

2

statute said.

3

The words of the statute are extraordinarily broad.

4

This Court has had many opportunities to look at this

5

section of the statute, and when we look, for example, on

6

page one of the blue brief, at the definitions, person

7

includes any individual or entity, and an enterprise for

this purpose includes any corporation.

9

to any person employed by an enterprise.

10

QUESTION:

And 1962(c) refers

On these facts, could you have

11

alleged that King was the enterprise and the corporation

12

was the person?

MR. EDLIN:

guess your answer to Justice Kennedy means that in your

complaint you could have alleged it both ways and then

MR. EDLIN:

I think that that's no doubt

technically correct, but I don't think that's what we're

trying to do just because you can plead in the

alternative means that you can plead wholly inconsistent

I don't think that pleading in the

10

theories of facts.

11

I don't think that a pleading in the alternative like this

12

would pass a motion simply because I do think that in

terms of the structure of the person and the enterprise,

14

you do have to pick it.

MR. EDLIN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

In that

case, a sole proprietorship with employees would be an

pleadings which are again not at issue in this case have

2

routinely been upheld as appropriate pleadings.

3

Justice Ginsburg, that our circuit just got this one

4

wrong, and I think that it's very simple to address it.

5

I think,

Moving past the language of the statute and on

6

toward the Reves case, again as I mentioned just a moment

7

ago, Reves carefully considered the appropriateness of

8

imposing liability upon employees or others who were in

9

operational and management control of the corporation.

10

There is no question that under that test Don King would

11

qualify as someone in operational or management control of

12

this enterprise, and that is the appropriate standard to

13

use here.

14

Reves is the appropriate standard, and under Reves Mr.

15

King would have liability.

16

simply immunizes that.

17

It is not a scope of employment standard.

The Second Circuit's decision

The final vice with the Second Circuit's decision

18

goes toward the evisceration of 1962(c) actions.

MR. EDLIN:

I don't, Your Honor.
Yes.

I don't know.

That would be a more

4

interesting statistic as far as whether your

5

interpretation really fulfills the purpose of RICO.

6

MR. EDLIN:

Your Honor, there is no doubt that

7

the statute was targeted at organized crime, but there is

8

also little doubt --

9

QUESTION:

That's right.

And all your statistic

10

may prove is that the statute is being used excessively

11

for a purpose that it did not have in mind at all.

12

MR. EDLIN:

Your Honor, there is little question

13

that what you're saying is true, except for the fact that

14

this Court has read in Sedima into the statute the fact

15

that it has an extremely broad sweep and it catches

16

precisely this kind of activity.

17

in unveiling the broadest possible statute, that it would

18

err on the side of including these kinds of cases,

19

possibly even shifting the burden to Federal courts to

20

deal with these kinds of claims so that loopholes were not

21

created for clever racketeers to slip through and avoid

22

liability.

Congress made a choice

I believe that that demonstrates the breadth of

24

the statute, and if that is a problem to be remedied as

-- again, to my last point, the problem with the Second

to bribe public municipalities, or whether you take our

example of an organized crime family incorporating and

MR. EDLIN:

Did you urge that case

We urged it in the Second Circuit.

16

We argued it extensively in the Second Circuit, and what

17

is interesting to me at least in the Second Circuit's

decision -- there are a couple of points of interest.

19

One, it did not discuss Reves.

Circuit owns up to the fact that its decision, it's

other circuit on this point, I think demonstrates in some

way that the Second Circuit was inviting this certiori.

6

QUESTION:

Well, a visiting judge is expected to

follow the precedent in the circuit which he visits.

7

MR. EDLIN:

I'm simply observing that I found

8

how the court issued its decision interesting, given the

9

fact that it does not mention Reves.

It is very difficult

10

to understand how this case, which is so close to Reves,

11

is not even mentioned in this very short Second Circuit

12

decision.

reconciled. There is no way to take the facts of this case

and support them under any reading of Reves.

And I think the reason is obvious.

QUESTION:

about, if I'm trying to imaginatively put myself in their

shoes, is that a person could claim the following.

manager in that company who, on a couple of occasions, at

21

least two, told the salesmen to overstate or to lie about

However, this Court has rejected every instance in which a

is with Congress.

10

This statute was not passed without Congress

observing that these exact criticisms were possible.

12

was passed over opposition.

13

was simply that the protections of the statute did not

14

take place in the definitional sections, it took place in

the pattern and enterprise sections so that garden-variety

frauds are typically not committed with a pattern and

inconsistent with the Court's holding in Reves that a

defendant, under Section 1962(c), must participate in the

If participation and operation and management is necessary

for there to be liability, then carrying out the affairs

of the business cannot prevent liability.

An employee who controls a corporation would,

2

we do believe that if thinking along with us the Court

3

concludes that the Second Circuit's reading of 1962(c) and

4

its application is correct, the absurdity of the other

5

reading would lead acceptance of its result.

6

We do not rely upon that, although

Mr. Justice Breyer, our case is not limited to a

single employee situation.

Then that's their concern, because if

11

that's right, then the one time when the interest of the

employee committing the crime and the interest of the

corporation are likely to be congruent is where you have

14

an evil corporation, and that seems to be the one time

that clearly the Second Circuit rule would exempt from the

its impact is bad in terms of the statutory purpose.

Well, that -- that's an easy

conclusion to draw if your sole test of scope of

employment is intent to benefit the corporation, but the

scope of employment inquiry is broader than that and, even

13

apart from the fact that there's always a policy component

14

to it, you've got to take into consideration in some way

corporate purpose, and I take it we at least have common

ground that there is no -- there is not State corporation

law that would charter a corporation to commit within the

MR. FLEMING:

And if that has got to be

MR. FLEMING:

5

QUESTION:

Right, but that's true only if that's

7

to be the case, it would just, it seems to me, make for

clearer thinking if we didn't talk about scope of

employment and instead said, look, the test is whether

10

it's to further the financial interest of the corporation.

11

MR. FLEMING:

And what the court of appeals said

MR. FLEMING:

No, you wouldn't say that's the sole

MR. FLEMING:

There's the

The thing that strikes me as a little

bit odd about the scope of employment test is that the

scope of employment in Reves is one we usually make as

relevant to whether the employer is liable, and it's not

the inquiry we make when we're looking to see if the

All the circuits agree on that, and all the

QUESTION:

You could have a sole proprietorship

2

The question is whether the Second Circuit's view of the

3

application of 1962(c) should prevail, or whether the view

4

of other circuits should prevail.

5

The Second Circuit is saying that corporate

of the corporation are really a part of the corporation

8

and are not distinct from the corporation for the purposes

9

of the distinctness required by RICO.

QUESTION:

The United States is one example

where the Second Circuit position would meet, and it says

But the conduct could be reached

under RICO under Section (a), both as to the corpora --

scheme, you have a situation where under (a) the

12

beneficiary corporation -- what Mr. Blakey calls the

14

It doesn't make any sense.

liable for the wrongdoing of its employees is when the

employee is acting for the employee's benefit and not for

that is the ambiguity in this statute which we think takes

away from applying meaning.

This statute says, as interpreted, says any

fair inference from that, which is also consistent with

from that is that Congress intended the persons to be
