CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

4

now in Number 99-1680, City News and Novelty, Inc. v. the

5

City of Waukesha.

6

Mr. Olson.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFF S. OLSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:

11

This case is controlled by the interaction of

12

four principles, all designed to eliminate the danger of

13

censorship by delay, from this Court's decisions on speech

14

licensing schemes.

15

First Amendment, a speech licensing scheme that acts as a

16

prior restraint must guarantee an applicant a prompt final

17

administrative decision in a short, fixed period of time.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. OLSON:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. OLSON:

First, in order to comply with the

Mr. Olson -Yes.
-- is this a speech licensing scheme?
It is a speech licensing scheme

22

because it requires a license to operate an adult book

23

store.

24
25

QUESTION:

But it's different than Freedman, in

the sense that Freedman was expressly designed to permit
3

1

or not permit speech based solely on its content.

2

MR. OLSON:

3

QUESTION:

You're correct.
And it seems to me this is not that

4

at all.

5

directly controlling, it seems to me.

6

I recognize the analogy, but Freedman is not

MR. OLSON:

You're right that the Waukesha

7

ordinance doesn't permit licensing decisions on its face

8

to be made on the basis of content, but the Court I

9

believe has recognized in City of Lakewood and in FW/PBS

10

that licensing decisions that are not expressly content-

11

based can still be used for covert content-based

12

censorship.

13

QUESTION:

Are you claiming that any of the

14

reasons that were given -- this is a case of a license

15

that was in existence, and it was -- it's a nonrenewal

16

case, right?

17

MR. OLSON:

18

QUESTION:

Yes.
And the nonrenewal was based on

19

violation, alleged violation of the terms of the license.

20

Are you contesting that any of those terms, like no minors

21

on the premises, open booths, that any of those terms

22

violate the First Amendment?

23

MR. OLSON:

Not in this case.

We will do that

24

in some future case, but we have not made that argument in

25

this case and we don't think the Court should reach that
4

1

argument in this case.

2

not about the substantive disqualification criteria.

3

QUESTION:

This is a case about procedures,

I suppose a book store, or a

4

newspaper has to -- they're in a building, and I guess

5

they can't have holes in the floors and unsafe electricity

6

and maybe they wouldn't be able to run a business if they

7

did. They don't have to meet -- for that safe electricity

8

or working conditions and so forth there isn't some

9

special test, is there?

10

MR. OLSON:

Oh, all of those laws of general

11

application that don't act as prior restraints targeted at

12

speech can be enforced.

13

QUESTION:

How are the violations here targeted

14

at speech?

15

involve conduct, nothing to do with speech in the books in

16

the store.

17

I believe that the accusation was they were --

MR. OLSON:

They're targeted at speech in the

18

sense that they're tied to the license, and they're tied

19

to the permission to continue your ongoing speech.

20

QUESTION:

Well, so you have a book store, and

21

it says you can have a license to sell a book store, open

22

your book store provided there isn't electricity running

23

all over the floor and electrocuting people.

24

MR. OLSON:

25

QUESTION:

Those -Is that then subject to some special
5

1

test because it's a book store?

2

MR. OLSON:

If the requirement to have the

3

electricity only applies to book stores, yes, it would be

4

subject to the Freedman guarantees.

5

everybody, as all those building code requirements do as

6

far as I know, then they're not subject to the Freedman

7

guarantees, and that's what the Court said in Lakewood.

8
9

If it applies to

The second principle that I think controls the
Court's disposition of this case is that a speech

10

licensing scheme violates the First Amendment if it

11

permits the status quo to be altered to the applicant's

12

detriment during the administrative proceedings.

13

QUESTION:

How do you get that from Freedman,

14

because Freedman, the status quo was no speech.

That is,

15

the Court said you must have a graphic procedure, because

16

you're not allowing someone to speak.

17

been permitted to speak, has a license, and the question

18

is whether it will be renewed.

19

MR. OLSON:

20

QUESTION:

Here, a speaker has

So --

That's -So you're asking for, the continued

21

speech is the status quo, as distinguished from Freedman,

22

where no speech was the status quo.

23

MR. OLSON:

That's absolutely correct.

In

24

Freedman and in Southeastern Promotions the Court said

25

that a prior restraint before judicial review can be
6

1

imposed only where it maintains the status quo.

2

Where the status quo is speech, obviously you

3

can't impose a prior restraint prior to judicial review,

4

and in the tail-end of Southeastern Promotions the Court

5

listed the constitutional deficiencies with the law at

6

issue there, and one of the deficiencies listed was that

7

it permitted the status quo to be altered to the

8

applicant's detriment before judicial review.

9

QUESTION:

That was another Freedman-type case,

10

wasn't it, where the performance could not go on under the

11

existence.

12

MR. OLSON:

It was a new speech case, that's

13

correct, but I believe the Court found that the status quo

14

was altered to the applicant's detriment because the show

15

in the presentation of Hair in Southeastern Promotions had

16

to be postponed and they lost their date for the

17

presentation.

18

We believe that the third principle governing

19

this case is that a licensing scheme that acts as a prior

20

restraint must confer upon an unsuccessful applicant the

21

right to prompt judicial review, and the fourth principle

22

is that --

23

QUESTION:

Do you really -- is that really your

24

principle?

As I understand your case, it's not prompt

25

judicial review as such, as was the case in Freedman, but

1

here you would be delighted to have delayed judicial

2

review as long as you keep your license until judicial

3

review is over, so what you're really saying, it's not a

4

question of prompt, it's a question of until the end of

5

the judicial road, however long that road is, your license

6

can't be revoked.

7

MR. OLSON:

We believe that's what Southeastern

8

Promotions requires, and we believe that's the only way to

9

prevent injury from lack of prompt judicial review.

10

QUESTION:

But then if that's the case it's

11

nothing to do with the promptness of judicial review.

12

It's simply that you retain your license until judicial

13

review is over, however long it takes.

14

MR. OLSON:

It's right that that's the rule

15

we're urging the Court to find in Southeastern Promotions

16

and FW/PBS and apply in this case, but it's wrong to say

17

that it has nothing to do with the promptness of judicial

18

review, I think, because the question on which the Court

19

granted certiorari is does the licensing ordinance have to

20

contain language to prevent injury from want of prompt

21

judicial review, and the only way to prevent injury from

22

want of prompt judicial review when you're enacting city

23

licensing ordinance is to maintain the status quo,

24

guarantee the status quo --

25

QUESTION:

But that can be done by the court.
8

1

If that's constitutionally required, as you say, when you

2

have the ordinance providing for prompt commencement of

3

judicial review, what would go along with the prompt

4

commencement of judicial review is the ability of the

5

court, indeed the obligation of the court, if the

6

Constitution is as you say it is, to immediately issue a

7

stay order preventing the cancellation of the license.

8
9

Why isn't that sufficient?

Why does it have to

be in the statute if you provide for judicial review and

10

if, as you tell us, the court having judicial review must

11

maintain the status quo?

12

MR. OLSON:

Justice Scalia, it's not sufficient

13

for five reasons.

14

temporary relief is in the discretion of the circuit court

15

and can depend on lots of factors, including docket

16

pressure --

17

First, the timing of that sort of

QUESTION:

Not if it's constitutionally

18

required, as you tell us.

19

has to be maintained.

20

know, a lock on a stay order from the court as soon as the

21

case gets there.

22

MR. OLSON:

You tell us that the status quo

If that's so, you have a -- you

Well, that really depends on what

23

this Court says in this case.

If the Court says in this

24

case, as we urge it to say, that the status quo through

25

judicial review must be guaranteed, then I suppose we
9

1

could go into circuit court and get on the schedule for a

2

motion and have the judge receive briefs and decide our

3

motion and, after a period of time, issue an order

4

implementing this Court's decision.

5

QUESTION:

It would also mean that you've

6

brought this case before you have any reason to believe

7

you've been harmed.

8

MR. OLSON:

9

QUESTION:

No.
I mean, why should we pronounce that

10

advisory opinion?

11

is, that the court must issue a stay order, why can't we

12

await that event?

13

stay order, then you've been harmed.

14

If it is indeed the case, as you say it

If and when a court doesn't issue a

MR. OLSON:

I don't think that a stay order, the

15

possibility of a stay order in the circuit court is an

16

adequate substitute for Freedman safeguards, including

17

maintenance of the status quo as written into the

18

ordinance.

19
20

QUESTION:

held -- was it the supreme court, or the court of appeals?

21

MR. OLSON:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

Well, the supreme court of Wisconsin

Court of appeals.
The court of appeals held that what

you're asking for was not required here, didn't it?
MR. OLSON:

The court of appeals believed that

the status quo would be maintained through the
10

1

administrative proceedings automatically, and the court of

2

appeals held that it wasn't necessary to maintain the

3

status quo through the termination of judicial

4

proceedings.

5

QUESTION:

So under that holding, if you went

6

into the Circuit Court of Waukesha County you might get a

7

stay and you might not.

8
9

MR. OLSON:

Well, we wouldn't have much of a

claim on a stay today except by making the arguments from

10

Freedman and Southeastern Promotions that we're making

11

here today.

12

QUESTION:

Well, couldn't you argue that the

13

administrative determination by the city was arbitrary or

14

capricious?

15

administrative order?

16

Isn't that a ground for judicial review of an

MR. OLSON:

We could.

That would be an argument

17

going to the merits of the claim and, of course, it would

18

be relevant to the issuance of a stay, because we have to

19

show probability of success.

20

QUESTION:

Your position basically is, even

21

though your claim substantively has no merit, you're still

22

entitled to an automatic stay.

23

MR. OLSON:

I don't even get to whether we're

24

entitled to an automatic stay in my thinking, because I

25

don't think that the possibility of a stay being imposed
11

1

in a discretionary manner in the circuit court is

2

sufficient to satisfy Southeastern Promotions, Freedman,

3

FW/PBS.

4

QUESTION:

It is sufficient if they decide your

5

case -- if the circuit -- you have some claim on the

6

merits.

7

license.

8
9

You say they're arbitrary in taking away my

MR. OLSON:

Or some provision is

unconstitutional.

10

QUESTION:

Yes, all right, you say this, we have

11

a claim on the merits, and you say, judge, decide it.

12

Decide it before we have to close down.

13

it's fine, right?

14

judge decides your claim on the merits before you have to

15

shut the door.

16
17

Now, if they do,

You have no complaint as long as the

MR. OLSON:

In an as-applied challenge that

would be correct, but this is a facial challenge.

18

QUESTION:

No,

but I'm not saying about this

19

case.

Suppose it was always true that the judges would

20

decide on the merits before anyone had to shut the door.

21

MR. OLSON:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. OLSON:

If that were always true, then -No problem, all right.
-- the court wouldn't have to worry

24

about a specific guarantee --

25

QUESTION:

Fine, then why aren't you better off,
12

1

not worse off, if the court decides a stay before you have

2

to shut down, for after all, a court will give you the

3

stay as long as there's a reasonable probability of

4

success, but the court will allow you to stay open on the

5

merits only if you're right.

6
7
8
9
10
11

MR. OLSON:

Getting that stay does require us to

show a reasonable probability of success on the merits.
QUESTION:

But to win, you have to win, so

you're easier -- it's easier for you to get the stay than
it is to win.
MR. OLSON:

Not -- not really, in terms of

12

timing especially.

13

of success on the merits in an administrative review until

14

that administrative record gets to the court, and there's

15

no time limit on that under the unamended ordinance.

16

QUESTION:

We can't show a reasonable probability

This case has an air of unreality to

17

it, because in fact your client did get a stay until the

18

end of the judicial road without making a showing of

19

probability of success on the merits and, in fact, the

20

entire case has been now adjudicated on the merits, is

21

that not so?

22

MR. OLSON:

That's correct, and we have no as-

23

applied challenge here.

24

challenge case.

25

QUESTION:

This is strictly a facial

But isn't it also have an air of
13

1

unreality because your client is not in business any more

2

and doesn't intend to go back into business, as I

3

understand the proceedings.

4

MR. OLSON:

Our client is still just barely in

5

business operating as a nonadult store, and intending to

6

close even that operation within a matter of days, but as

7

we pointed out in our brief --

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. OLSON:

Why isn't the case moot?
The case isn't moot because there's

10

a disability from licensure that flows from having

11

violated the ordinance by operating without a license,

12

which I told them they were entitled to do under

13

Shuttlesworth, because --

14

QUESTION:

But there's a disability for

15

licensure for a business he has no intention of engaging

16

in, as I understand it.

17

MR. OLSON:

Well, there's no showing that they

18

intend to engage in this business, or that they have not

19

applied for a new license and they don't have an

20

application pending now, but they haven't foresworn any

21

intention to apply for a license at some other location in

22

the future.

23

QUESTION:

I have the impression -- I may be

24

unfair to you -- that you may be representing interests

25

other than the named party to the case here.
14

1

MR. OLSON:

Not -- my client has a real,

2

concrete interest in having a facially valid,

3

constitutional ordinance on the book in Waukesha.

4

News and Novelty and its officers have real interests in

5

that --

6

QUESTION:

City

Sufficient interest to finance

7

extensive litigation in the United States Supreme Court.

8

I guess that's the answer, right, and of course he's

9

paying the bills, I suppose.

10

MR. OLSON:

Yes.

The City News and Novelty is

11

footing the bill for this case because they believe

12

they're right, they believe in it's important principle,

13

and they don't want the 5-year disability from licensure

14

that will fall on the corporation and its officers.

15

they're determined to have been operating without a

16

license in violation of a valid ordinance up until

17

February 14, 2000, which is when they stopped operating as

18

an adult book store, they'd be disabled from licensure in

19

Waukesha for 5 years after that, until Valentine's Day

20

2005.

21

QUESTION:

If

That disability has nothing -- I

22

mean, that disability has something to do with a defect in

23

the system that might have produced a merits decision that

24

was contrary to the facts, or contrary to the law, but I

25

don't see how that disability has anything to do with the
15

1

question of timing that you're now bringing before us.

2

mean, if, indeed, your client was properly found to be in

3

violation of the substantive provisions of the ordinance,

4

then it seems to me he deserves to be disabled from future

5

licensing.

6

What does that have anything to do with the

7

timing question of, you know, he has to be allowed to

8

continue operation before the adjudication is made?

9

mean, I see that you have some continuing interest, but

10

it's not an interest that depends at all upon the issue

11

that you're bringing before us here.

12

MR. OLSON:

I

Justice Scalia, they do in the

13

following sense.

14

path in this licensing ordinance, then there's no valid

15

renewal mechanism, and the whole licensing requirement

16

becomes facially invalid.

17

operate without a license.

18

I

If there is no valid judicial review

QUESTION:

Then they're entitled to

But you're not saying that the whole

19

judicial review mechanism is invalid in the sense that it

20

has produced an unjust or incorrect substantive decision.

21

You're saying that there's one feature of it, namely

22

whether your client was allowed to operate in the meantime

23

that rendered it unfair, but I don't see how that has

24

anything to do with your -- the propriety of preventing

25

your client from operating in the future, once a
16

1

substantive violation has properly been found.

2

Or, you say it can't properly be found, that the

3

entire judicial proceeding is invalidated by reason of the

4

fact that your client could not be allowed to continue

5

operation pending the proceeding?

6

MR. OLSON:

My client was allowed to continue,

7

but my client was entitled to have that guaranteed on the

8

face of the ordinance, and we contend that the --

9

QUESTION:

Well --

10

QUESTION:

There is a -- there was a -- I forgot

11

what the title of the case was, but a decision of this

12

Court explaining that if you were entitled to something as

13

a matter of constitutional right, due process, like

14

notice, it doesn't matter that the notice provision isn't

15

in the law itself, as long as the court insists on it.

16

Then you have no constitutional right that has been

17

violated.

18

MR. OLSON:

That's right.

There are some of the

19

cases going to the requirement of, for example, explicit

20

and specific and objective licensing standards that

21

recognize that these could be -- these could come from

22

usage or authoritative construction, as well as on the

23

face of the legislation, but here there is no usage or

24

authoritative construction that builds a status quo --

25

QUESTION:

Well, do you have -- all we know is
17

1

in your case you were allowed to remain in operation until

2

the end of the line.

3

record to show that that doesn't routinely happen?

4

MR. OLSON:

Do you -- is there anything in this

Well, as far as I know, this is the

5

only establishment ever to be licensed in Waukesha as an

6

adult book store.

7

There's nothing --

QUESTION:

So you're saying in another case

8

someone else might suffer the violation of a

9

constitutional right, but certainly that has not been your

10

experience, and I don't know why we shouldn't assume that

11

other cases would proceed in this same pattern and not in

12

some other pattern.

13

MR. OLSON:

The Court has held in more than one

14

case that license applicants are entitled more to the hope

15

of the grace -- to more than the hope of the grace of the

16

Government.

17

words, maybe they will.

18

stay open, too, or maybe they'll say that we let Olson's

19

clients stay open because that was test case, raising

20

constitutional issues about our ordinance and we weren't

21

sure how it was going to come out, now we know, so you've

22

got to close with our nonrenewal decision.

23

entitled --

24
25

They're entitled to a guarantee.

QUESTION:

In other

Maybe they will let the next guy

We're

Mr. Olson, does the fact that you're

making a facial constitutional challenge here in your view
18

1

make any difference on the question of mootness or

2

ripeness?

3

MR. OLSON:

Yes, I think it does.

I think if we

4

were making an as-applied challenge the -- Justice Scalia

5

would be right in the sense that we haven't suffered any

6

injury, because we were allowed to remain open.

7

that we're making a facial challenge, I think first of all

8

it focuses the Court's attention on the ordinance as it

9

stood in 1995, and that's -- in '96, and that it prevents

The fact

10

it from being mooted out by the subsequent amendments to

11

the ordinance that have taken place four times this year.

12

QUESTION:

Maybe, is it standing?

I mean, as I

13

understand it you're saying -- you're complaining about a

14

procedural flaw, call it X.

15

MR. OLSON:

16

QUESTION:

17

Yes.
And as far as your client is

concerned, X never happened to him.

18

MR. OLSON:

19

QUESTION:

Correct.
As far as your client was concerned,

20

it's now been determined that he violated the statute on

21

the merits.

22

MR. OLSON:

23

QUESTION:

Correct.
And your client says, I'm out of

24

business anyway, I've made an agreement not to try to get

25

back into it.

1

Now, it sounds as if that should violate some

2

prudential principle.

(Laughter.)

QUESTION:

MR. OLSON:

6

QUESTION:

7

I'm not totally sure which one.
Well -You've looked into this more

thoroughly.

8
9

I just --

QUESTION:

Can I add one fact before you answer

Justice Breyer?

10

MR. OLSON:

11

QUESTION:

Sure.
Generally the purpose of the facial

12

challenge is to protect third parties who may not be

13

before the court, but here, is it not a fact that the

14

third parties are largely, maybe not entirely protected by

15

the amendment to the ordinance, from the very danger that

16

you're seeking -- the very principle you're seeking to

17

vindicate?

18

MR. OLSON:

The third parties are protected from

19

a couple of the original problems.

They're protected from

20

indefinite time -- indefinite times in the administrative

21

procedure.

22

judicial review and lack of preservation of the status quo

23

during judicial review.

24

will apply for renewal in the future under this ordinance

25

will still face those facial problems with the scheme as

But they're not protected from lack of prompt

The third parties out there who

20

1
2

it stands today.
QUESTION:

But those third parties will be in

3

exactly the position that your client has been in during

4

the course of this litigation, isn't that correct?

5

What I'm getting at is, the kind of the classic

6

third-party right that we recognize is the right in the

7

case in which the individual defendant in effect says,

8

yeah, as applied to me the ordinance is perfectly

9

constitutional, but there are these other people and as to

10
11

them it would not be.
But here your client is in exactly the same

12

position as the other people, and should that make a

13

difference?

14

if it turns out that this supposedly facially invalid

15

ordinance in practice is applied in a perfectly valid way

16

to you, should we therefore assume that it will be

17

different when the ordinance is applied to third parties?

One reason why it might make a difference is,

18

MR. OLSON:

19

QUESTION:

I -So I'm wondering whether you're

20

really in a situation in which our cases recognize your

21

right to raise a third-party right where you're in the

22

same boat with them.

23

MR. OLSON:

I think your cases prevent you from

24

assuming that we are in the same boat with them.

25

they prevent you from assuming that they won't be required
21

I think

1

to close pending judicial review, for example, or that --

2
3

QUESTION:
with them?

4

MR. OLSON:

5

QUESTION:

6

Well, why aren't you in the same boat

Because -You say our cases prevent me from

making that assumption.

7

MR. OLSON:

Why aren't you?

We got the grace of the Government

8

and a special dispensation to be allowed to remain open.

9

Future applicants, there's no reason to believe that they

10

will get that, and they are entitled --

11

QUESTION:

There's also, usually a champion

12

comes forward and says, other people are going to be

13

chilled, but in this case not only aren't others chilled

14

from getting into this business, but you're being edged

15

out not because of any ordinance, but because a bigger

16

player has taken over and there's not -- and has squeezed

17

you out of the market.

18

MR. OLSON:

Maybe not totally out of the market.

19

They might want to apply for a license at some other

20

location.

21

QUESTION:

But they are perfectly adequate

22

champion of themselves.

It's not like the person who is

23

going to be afraid to demonstrate for fear of being

24

arrested.

25

what is it, the B -- whatever the organization that has

It's -- I don't see any chill of people like,

22

1

come into this town with a bigger and better adult book

2

shop.

3

MR. OLSON:

Setting that particular organization

4

aside and looking at future operations that might be

5

deciding whether or not to locate in Waukesha, I don't

6

think it's beyond the stretch of the imagination to

7

suggest that they might decide to go elsewhere if this

8

Court decides that Waukesha's ordinance is just fine and

9

you can be nonrenewed administratively for popcorn on the

10

floor, and you have to close until you get a judicial

11

decision on the merits that that's an unconstitutional

12

criterion.

13

QUESTION:

Maybe we have been misconstruing your

14

argument.

15

party right that you were raising, but an argument that

16

even as to you in this case, in which you were allowed to

17

operate as the proceedings progressed, even as to you in

18

this case, the statute was simply flatly unconstitutional

19

and therefore the entire proceeding was unconstitutional,

20

even though you weren't shut down pending the

21

determination.

22

Is your argument not that there is a third-

MR. OLSON:

We do contend that, and we do

23

contend that at least on remand the nonrenewal order will

24

have to be vacated because it was issued pursuant to an

25

unconstitutional licensing scheme.
23

And with the Court's permission, I'd like to
reserve my time.

QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Olson. Mr. Meitz,

we'll hear from you.

5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURT MEITZ

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7
8
9

MR. MEITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The petitioner in this case was denied a renewal

10

of its adult license for committing nine separate

11

violations of our municipal code, including permitting

12

minors to loiter and allowing sexual activity to both

13

occur on the premises.

14

that a guarantee of a prompt judicial determination, as

15

required in Freedman in the context of a censorship

16

scheme, is neither applicable or required for a licensing

17

ordinance that focuses on the secondary effects of such

18

establishments and targets prior misconduct not protected

19

by the Constitution.

20

The City of Waukesha maintains

The specific issue before this Court, which is

21

before the Court today, is that -- whether such an

22

ordinance, which has neither the effect or purpose of

23

limiting or restricting the content of any commutative

24

materials must provide either a guarantee of a prompt

25

judicial determination, versus the availability or access
24

1

to prompt judicial review for administrative decisions

2

that are made concerning conduct which is unprotected by

3

the First Amendment.

4

QUESTION:

Well, if we accept your statement of

5

the question, I think it's perhaps an easier case than I

6

believe they mean to bring, because I think part of their

7

point is that even under a scheme which is justified on

8

the secondary effects analysis, so it's not content-based

9

in the classic sense, even under that scheme, there is

10

still going to be a content restriction on speech if this

11

establishment is shut down, and that is true simply

12

because the nature of the establishment is rather content-

13

specific, so you're going to have a content -- you're

14

going to have an effect which is correlated to content, so

15

that's why I wonder if it's fair for you to say that the

16

ordinance does not have the effect, in addition to not

17

having the purpose of a content restriction, because I

18

think they're saying it does have the effect of a content

19

restriction, and that's why you ought to have some

20

safeguards.

21

MR. MEITZ:

In answering your question, Justice

22

Souter, this Court said in the seminal cases, in the first

23

and the plurality of American Mini Theatres, and in

24

Renton, that these types of establishments, adult

25

establishments do have a effect on the surrounding
25

1

environments.

2

The Court said in Renton, the majority said that

3

you are capable of regulating, you have a substantial

4

important interest, and as long --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. MEITZ:

No question.
As long as your regulations are

7

justified without regard to the content of what they sell,

8

in this case what they sell or rent, that is content-

9

neutral.

10

Certainly -QUESTION:

It is content-neutral for certain

11

purposes, but he is saying that there ought to be some

12

procedural safeguard that recognizes the fact that even

13

these so-called content-neutral limitations based on

14

secondary effects do have an effect on speech, and that

15

effect is at least very closely correlated with content,

16

and he's saying that for that reason, even though you can

17

regulate it -- that's not being contested, is it, as a

18

broad proposition -- even though you can regulate it,

19

there ought to be some limits on your regulation because

20

of the damage that you can and do on a content-basis, in

21

effect.

22

MR. MEITZ:

And I think that is clear.

As the

23

Court -- a plurality stated in FW/PBS, technically this is

24

a -- requires prior restraint analysis, and we do

25

initially, we provide the objective standards for review,
26

1

because if you don't have, as the case was cited in

2

Lakewood, where there are no standards, you have unbridled

3

discretion, and without any standards there's that hidden

4

idea of censorship, and we provide, as the court of

5

appeals determined, objective, definitive standards.

6

The other key here, as FW said, is you must

7

provide, the licensor must provide a determination in a

8

reasonable, specific period of time.

9

QUESTION:

But I think, and I don't want to cut

10

you off, but I think what you're saying -- and this may be

11

fine, but I want to make sure I understand it.

12

saying, yes, so long as we meet certain conditions, not

13

all the conditions he wants, we can have an effect on

14

content.

15

MR. MEITZ:

16

here is certainly --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. MEITZ:

You're

I think what we're going to find

But isn't that your position?
There will be what we consider an

19

incidental burden on content.

20

this Court on numerous occasions involving time, place,

21

and manner restrictions where you have in place some

22

restrictions, as long as they're incidental, and

23

incidental as this Court has defined on many occasions, is

24

that the regulation is essential to the furtherance of the

25

interest, and clearly here, our interest, our interest in
27

There clearly will be, but

1

protecting the health, safety, and welfare of our

2

citizens, is geared on not what they're selling, not what

3

they're renting.

4

We're concerned about keeping minors out of

5

these establishments.

6

sexual activity from occurring.

7

peep booths not being obstructed, which would discourage

8

sexual activity.

9

QUESTION:

We're concerned about keeping
We're concerned about

We accept that and he accepts that.

10

All he's saying is, if you're going to regulate on that

11

perfectly legitimate basis, you've got to do it promptly.

12

That's the argument.

13

MR. MEITZ:

14

QUESTION:

Why can't you do it promptly -And I --- and therefore why is it a burden?

15

I mean, that seems to me what the issue is in this case.

16

Why is it a burden that you should not carry?

17

MR. MEITZ:

We would agree with that.

We

18

believe that the argument of administrative determine --

19

of prompt judicial administrative determination is not the

20

issue before the Court.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. MEITZ:

23

QUESTION:

But do you agree that it's required?
Absolutely.
Well then, what's the difference

24

between an administrative delay, which you concede the

25

Constitution prohibits, and a judicial delay?
28

1

MR. MEITZ:

The big difference is this, and I

2

think there were six justices in FW/PBS v. Dallas that

3

recognized the distinction between content-based

4

censorship schemes and the Freedman analysis, which was --

5

required these safeguards to obviate the dangers of a

6

censorship system, and those licensing ordinance that do

7

not pass judgment on the content of any commutative

8

material.

9

QUESTION:

But what sense would it make for the

10

Court to have strict rules about administrative expedition

11

but not judicial, other than what Justice -- the line of

12

questions Justice Scalia was indicating, that there is

13

authority to issue a stay?

14

the reason?

15

MR. MEITZ:

Other than that, what would be

The reason is, is the requirement

16

for a guarantee of a prompt judicial determination in

17

Freedman is because the licensing scheme in Maryland was

18

passing a determination on the content of what is

19

obscenity.

20

associated with that the judiciary has the expertise to

21

make determinations concerning the constitutionality or

22

whether a matter is protected or unprotected.

23

clear, that an administrative review body is not the final

24

arbiter.

25

This Court has stated, to obviate the risks

That is

If they want to declare something obscene or
29

1

not, the burden is upon them -- the burden upon them of

2

going to court and proving that is there, and the

3

requirement of prompt judicial determination is because

4

the judiciary has the necessary sensitivity towards what

5

is protected or not protected versus an administrative

6

body.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Meitz, if some kind of provision

8

for prompt administrative review is required in these

9

license revocation cases, do you think this Court has ever

10

decided whether the ensuing judicial review, whether it

11

has to provide for a prompt decision or just prompt access

12

to the courts, to courts having a power to maintain the

13

status quo if the appropriate showing is made.

14

MR. MEITZ:

15

QUESTION:

We believe that -Is there a difference between access

16

and final decision and what do you think our cases hold in

17

that --

18

MR. MEITZ:

For matters involving censorship or

19

content-based situations, it's clear from Freedman and its

20

progeny, Southeastern, that a prompt judicial, guarantee

21

of a prompt judicial determination is necessary to

22

minimize the risk, and the --

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. MEITZ:

25

QUESTION:

You mean final determination?
Yes.
As opposed to access?
30

1

QUESTION:

Yes.

However, as the plurality

2

stated in FW, the words availability, avenue, and

3

possibility, that that is appropriate considering the fact

4

that what we are doing here, the municipality is not

5

passing judgment on the content.

6

irrelevant.

9

What they sell is

We do it every other Tuesday in the City

QUESTION:

Well, I'm not clear on what you think

10

is necessary.

11

provision on the face of the statute for prompt final

12

judicial decision, or just prompt access to the court for

13

judicial review?

14

Is it necessary here that there be a

MR. MEITZ:

Prompt access, Justice O'Connor,

15

because we believe that the purpose, the reason for a

16

prompt judicial determination to eliminate that

17

discouraging effect on the individual film exhibitor to go

18

into court and the expertise, which only the judiciary

19

has, that is not applicable.

20

QUESTION:

But it seems to me it would go the

21

other way around.

If the administrative agency has

22

expertise, and it's required to expedite, in your case,

23

but the judiciary doesn't, then you're allowing the entity

24

without expertise to delay.

25

backwards.

That seems to me, you have it

31

1

MR. MEITZ:

Not with regard to matters that are

2

not content-based.

3

whether minors are loitering or not, that is within the

4

particular realm of municipal body.

5

like that all the time, and that decision is, in effect,

6

final, unless there is an appeal taken, and that's clearly

7

unlike the censorship scheme, where you have to go to

8

court Maryland, if you want this to be declared obscene

9

you better get authorization --

10

QUESTION:

If you're making a determination on

They make decisions

I go back to my earlier question.

If

11

the premise is that the Constitution requires expedition

12

at the administrative level, why doesn't it have the same

13

requirement at the judicial level?

14

answer, because that works against you, it seems to me.

15

MR. MEITZ:

Expertise can't be the

The reason it would not be required,

16

you have to look at the underlying rationale of Freedman

17

and why Freedman required a prompt judicial determination,

18

because of specifically what the Court said -- filed like,

19

the 37 photographs.

20

censor -- you are -- you're in the business of censoring,

21

and you are not sensitive to the protected versus

22

unprotected speech.

23

QUESTION:

You are not in the position,

Well, isn't there something, too, to

24

the idea that when you get into court, you're dealing with

25

a neutral tribunal, whereas perhaps the administrative
32

1
2

tribunal might be thought not to be neutral.
MR. MEITZ:

This is true, and I think as you

3

pointed out earlier the deferential standard of review

4

exists virtually in every State that I'm aware of.

5

pointed out by the Solicitor General, is whether there --

6

whether the administrative body was arbitrary and

7

capricious, exercises will versus its judgment.

8
9

QUESTION:

It's

Mr. Meitz, would you be making this

same argument if what was at issue here was not a statute

10

directed at adult book stores but a statute directed at,

11

let's say, radio stations?

12

business, just radio stations.

13

It's not addressed at all

It picks them out, and it addresses the external

14

effects of radio stations.

15

violation of the sanitary code because they're infested

16

with rats, or because the plumbing is unsafe, or because

17

the electricity is unsafe, their license can be revoked.

18

It seems to me a very parallel situation.

19

say that you could have a hearing under that statute

20

directed only at radio stations, and shut down the radio

21

station before the opportunity for complete judicial

22

review has been accorded?

23

MR. MEITZ:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. MEITZ:

If they're found to be in

Now, would you

If you're obviously not trying to -I am worried --- control the content, but if it's
33

1

like you said --

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. MEITZ:

That's right.
-- rats, or whatever, I would say,

4

absolutely, because if you -- you have an interest in

5

maintaining the sanitation and health of the community --

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. MEITZ:

Yes.
-- and if there happened to be a

8

licensing scheme that allowed them to be shut down, I

9

think the municipality would have a real substantial

10

interest in controlling, and as part of its public --

11

QUESTION:

A court would want to inquire into

12

why only radio stations were prohibited from having rats

13

in them, as opposed to every other kind of business, I

14

suppose.

15

MR. MEITZ:

I would agree with that, but I

16

think, again I bring the Court back to the seminal cases

17

of American Mini Theatres and Renton.

18

recognized that these secondary effects associated with

19

such establishments are important and substantial, and

20

they allow the municipality some flexibility with dealing

21

with these very serious problems, so yes, in a sense --

22

QUESTION:

Those cases just dealt with the

23

location of the business.

24

at all, Renton and Mini Theatres.

25

MR. MEITZ:

The Court

They didn't go into procedures

Renton and Mini Theatres was a
34

1

licensing, albeit you're correct, Justice Stevens, it did

2

involve the zoning, but I think there have been other

3

cases since then, and I'll use -- although not in the

4

adult book scheme, but I will mention Ward v. Rock Against

5

Racism, where there was a clear burden, or incidental

6

burden placed upon speech from the standpoint of how loud

7

the music could be in Central Park, and the interests of

8

the municipality being, you know, the neighbors around

9

Central Park had the right to quiet enjoyment --

10

QUESTION:

But again, that didn't have anything

11

to do with the timing of the decision, as I remember it,

12

did it?

13

MR. MEITZ:

Well, the Court there analyzed that

14

as intermediate scrutiny, time, place, and manner

15

restriction.

16

QUESTION:

I'd just like to get quickly your --

17

what's the procedural doctrine that -- is -- look, they're

18

complaining about X.

19

decided definitely they're not entitled to a license

20

anyway and they're going out of business, all right.

21

They've agreed to that, and yet they want to complain

22

about X.

23
24
25

They weren't hurt by X.

They've

What's the procedural doctrine that bars them?
MR. MEITZ:

I'm not sure if I understand the

question.
QUESTION:

Well, you don't think they ought to
35

1

be here making this argument.

2

we just went --

3

MR. MEITZ:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. MEITZ:

7

QUESTION:

9

Yes.
Remember what I just went through

with him?

6

8

You called it moot, or --

Yes.
I want to know, what's the procedural

doctrine that says we can't get to the merits of this?
MR. MEITZ:

I -- the reason we brought this

10

issue to the Court's attention, and for the very limited,

11

unique situation, was the issue upon which you granted

12

review, and that is whether you require a prompt judicial

13

determination.

14

they were not injured.

15

and that -- again, we would prefer that this matter be

16

litigated on the merits.

17
18
19

The fact whether it was expedited or not,

QUESTION:

They were allowed to stay open,

We have many municipalities --

I just want the name of the doctrine.

What is the law that stops them from doing -MR. MEITZ:

I would cite Asarco from the

20

standpoint at least that you have to have some kind of

21

likelihood of redress that's available from this Court,

22

and it's very speculative at this point in time.

23

QUESTION:

But you called it moot.

You did

24

label it mootness, as opposed to standing, because I

25

suppose, on the theory that going in, when this whole
36

1

thing started, they appeared to be -- to have a live

2

interest in this, but now at the end of the line they

3

haven't maintained that interest.

4

you were saying, but maybe not.

5

MR. MEITZ:

I thought that's what

Only since the Court granted this

6

petition for review, we felt it was our obligation to

7

bring it to your attention because of the limited issue

8

upon which you granted the review, not because we amended

9

the ordinance.

10

QUESTION:

11

than Pap's and Erie was moot?

12

MR. MEITZ:

Well, is the -- is this any more moot

I think it's distinguished from

13

Pap's, because one, as the Court stated in Pap's, they

14

were -- this is clearly not an attempt by us -- they

15

arrived at a favorable decision from the lower court,

16

number 1.

17

O'Connor said in Pap's, there's some ongoing injury that

18

occurred in that case to the City of Erie --

19

Number 2, we don't know what -- as Justice

QUESTION:

The difference seemed to me to be, in

20

Pap's it's solely a question of mootness.

21

different thing.

22

never hurt by the provision of which they're complaining.

23
24
25

Here there's a

The additional thing is that they were

MR. MEITZ:

And that's exactly why we brought

that to the attention -QUESTION:

I know, and I'm trying to look for
37

1
2

the doctrinal handle.
MR. MEITZ:

Yes, and we look at it, if the Court

3

would have granted cert on all issues that would have been

4

a different case, because that might, if you were -- the

5

standards issued, or there was some impartiality question

6

of City of Waukesha panel, then that would maybe undermine

7

the entire licensing process, but this was a very limited

8

issue, and we fail to see how this -- how they are harmed

9

by this, or there's any redress likely by this Court.

10

The Court here is -- there's 21,000

11

municipalities in this country, approximately, all of

12

which have a substantial interest and -- in seeing --

13

preserving the quality of urban life in America.

That's my understanding.
Okay.
They're closing down this week.
Now, if they were to win their case,

would they be entitled to a license renewal under your

ordinance, even though they do not at the present time

25

wish to operate the business?

MR. MEITZ:

We don't believe so, because of the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

25

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE
39

1

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

2
3

MR. FELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

4

It's our position that the city's ordinance in

5

this case satisfies First Amendment procedural standards

6

in that prompt judicial review is available and therefore

7

the judgment below should be affirmed.

8

QUESTION:

9

to decision-making?

10

You mean access to review, as opposed

MR. FELDMAN:

Yes.

I think that actually is the

11

question on which the courts of appeals were divided, and

12

that's the question that the Court ought to reach and

13

decide, whether what's necessary is access to prompt

14

judicial review, or a final judicial determination on the

15

merits within a particular period of time.

16
17

QUESTION:

Mr. Feldman, are those cases

involving renewals, or initial issuance of licenses?

18

MR. FELDMAN:

I think all of the -- at least all

19

of the court of appeals decisions I think were initial

20

licenses.

21
22
23

QUESTION:

Do you think the considerations are

the same in the two situations?
MR. FELDMAN:

Yes, I do.

I think there are

24

differences in a due process analysis between someone who

25

has applied for renewal of a license and hasn't gotten the
40

1

renewal and has a property interest, perhaps, in that

2

license, and that may have due process implications, but I

3

think from the standpoint of the First Amendment the

4

question is, is there going to be a period of time during

5

which the expression doesn't occur, or does occur, and

6

it's just an interest in expression, and it doesn't matter

7

whether before that time the person was licensed and

8

had -- expression occurred or not.

9

QUESTION:

Of course, the status quo is entirely

10

different, because in one case the status quo is that the

11

First Amendment materials are being sold, and in the other

12

they're not in -- they're not being sold.

13

MR. FELDMAN:

I think that's true.

I think that

14

status quo issue has to -- may have to do with a due

15

process analysis.

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

17

MR. FELDMAN:

From the standpoint of the First

18

Amendment, the Court's references in Freedman and the

19

other cases to maintaining the status quo was -- in the

20

context of those cases what that meant is, there can be a

21

period of time during which the expression doesn't occur,

22

and I think that's the same principle that applies here.

23

There can be a period of time in this case pending

24

judicial review, as long as the judicial review is

25

available, during which the expression doesn't occur.
41

1

I think what's necessary in this context is, the

2

license applicant has to have the availability of -- has

3

to be able to go immediately into court once the

4

administrative decision is made, the licensee has to have

5

the ability to get temporary or preliminary relief if the

6

facts of the case warrant it, and there has to be no

7

particular obstacles that are placed in the licensee's

8

way, and if all of that is satisfied, then the court is in

9

the position to safeguard the licensee's interest and no

10
11

further requirements are necessary.
QUESTION:

So you think the availability of

12

temporary relief on a substantial showing is a necessary

13

component of the review?

14

MR. FELDMAN:

It's not directly presented here,

15

because that is available under this statute, but yes, I

16

think it's probably -- if you had a scheme -- and they are

17

unusual, but I think they may exist here and there.

18

a court doesn't have the power to grant the temporary

19

relief, I think that would raise other -- that would raise

20

First Amendment concerns.

21

I think --

22

QUESTION:

Where

Mr. Feldman, does the Government have

23

a position on mootness, or whatever you want to call it,

24

or the justiciability of this case at this time in its

25

current posture?
42

1

MR. FELDMAN:

I think it's our position that

2

essentially for the reasons given by the petitioner, that,

3

although it might be a close question, the case is

4

probably not moot.

5

interest that the petitioner has in the case.

6

There still is some continuing

QUESTION:

Why do these adult book store owners

7

keep going out of business and not intending to get back

8

in?

9

occupational hazard, I gather.

I mean, we had the same question in Pap's.

10

(Laughter.)

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. FELDMAN:

It's an

I don't understand.
I'm really not aware of the

13

economics that lead to that.

14

QUESTION:

But how does he have the right to

15

raise the claims of people who are not here whom would be

16

affected by this procedural provision, when he himself is

17

not affected by it?

18

MR. FELDMAN:

I think that his -- I think his

19

basic claim is this, is this procedure that the city's put

20

into effect, this licensing procedure, is

21

unconstitutional, and therefore I don't really even need a

22

license, or if I need a license, I ought to be able to get

23

one immediately.

24
25

That's the basic claim that --

QUESTION:

He's saying the whole thing is

unconstitutional because -43

1

MR. FELDMAN:

2

QUESTION:

Right.

-- it doesn't have sufficiently quick

3

judicial review, which he himself wouldn't have been

4

affected by.

5

MR. FELDMAN:

That's right, but I -- the fact

6

that in this particular case he wouldn't have been

7

affected by it --

8
9

QUESTION:

Can you think of another case where

it was that distant and somebody was allowed to raise

10

somebody's First Amendment rights when the other people

11

were perfectly able to raise it themselves?

12

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, I think the FW/PBS case, for

13

example, or in the Lakewood case, I think in a couple of

14

those cases you've had people who say, that there are

15

these -- that there are First Amendment procedural

16

safeguards that are required, and the party is able to go

17

into court and say, his claim is that the scheme is

18

unconstitutional.

19

is --

20

QUESTION:

21

all.

22

people --

23

Now, I'm not -- we don't agree that it

Even though it doesn't affect them at

Even though they're not affected and the other

MR. FELDMAN:

They're not affected in this case.

24

I suppose the theory would be that when he goes for

25

renewal again he might be affected, or that he -44

1

QUESTION:

Well, if the theory is if he goes for

2

renewal again and he's not going back into the business,

3

it's a little far-fetched, isn't it?

4

MR. FELDMAN:

5

QUESTION:

Right.

I think -- yes.

Well, I take it that the classic

6

Thornhill doctrine, where I'm allowed to raise somebody

7

else's rights, is because it's a content-based statute,

8

and this is not content-based.

9

MR. FELDMAN:

That's right, and I think that's

10

the crucial -- this is not contents-based, it's true, but

11

although in the FW/PBS case, which was identical to this

12

in terms of whether it was content-based, the Court said

13

the party could also raise these procedural interests,

14

First Amendment interests, could make a challenge to the

15

constitutionality of that scheme.

16

I do think that on the merits the important --

17

the crucial point here is that the decisions the city

18

makes are not content-based.

19

Freedman, where the Court said, this Court said that a

20

reviewing court has to be able -- has to -- is necessary,

21

because what the State was doing was looking at the

22

particular movie and making a judgment based on that

23

content about whether that movie should be allowed.

24
25

QUESTION:

Unlike in a situation like

Can you explain to me why the

administrator must act promptly, but the judiciary does
45

1

not?

2

MR. FELDMAN:

Yes, I hope so.

I think in -- in

3

FW/PBS what the Court held was that some of the Freedman

4

requirements are not necessary in this context and, in

5

particular, it said the city doesn't have to go to court.

6

You can let the other party go to court and the city

7

doesn't have to bear the burden of proof when it goes to

8

court, and I think the point of that decision was that the

9

municipal decision here, since it's not content-based, can

10

be allowed to go into effect and have final effect even

11

with no judge ever looking at it.

12

In the Freedman context, it's quite different.

13

In the Freedman context, what the Court was saying, we

14

don't want this censor's decision to go into effect for

15

any significant period of time without a judge looking at

16

it.

17

you go into court, until a judge has a chance to look at

18

it and decide whether the material --

It's not really a final determination of law until

19

QUESTION:

I thought --

20

MR. FELDMAN:

21

QUESTION:

-- is constitutionally protected.

Am I wrong, I was thinking, look,

22

normally where your courts are at stake a preliminary

23

injunction is good enough, but that isn't good enough

24

where it's the administrator, because the administrator

25

might not be as fair.
46

1
2

MR. FELDMAN:

I'm not sure I understand the

question.

3

QUESTION:

Well, the reason that you have to

4

protect them more about -- against the administrator than

5

a judge is, you think, well, the judge will be fair.

6

sees irreparable injury, and if there's some probability

7

of success he'll give you the injunction.

8

MR. FELDMAN:

9

QUESTION:

He

That's correct.

But you have to be tougher than that

10

on administrators, because they're already taken a side

11

and they're not judicial and so forth.

12

MR. FELDMAN:

That's correct.

I was only making

13

the point that there was a unique feature present in a

14

Freedman-type case, which is, you don't want any effect to

15

be given, or any substantial effect to be given to the

16

administrative decision because it's a content-based

17

decision on the content of that speech.

18

any effect to be given to that, basically, until it gets

19

into court.

20

You don't want

Here, the point of FW/PBS was, that can have

21

some effect as long as the proper procedures are required,

22

and --

23

QUESTION:

Excuse me, until it gets to the

24

court?

Are you saying that if it's a content-based

25

restriction you cannot impose it until the judicial review
47

1

is complete?

2

MR. FELDMAN:

No.

No, but I do think that the

3

Freedman safeguards were designed so that it has a very

4

limited effect, and that was the reason why in Freedman

5

you needed the judicial determination, not just the access

6

to the judge, to be within a very prompt period of time,

7

because there was a concern that that administrative

8

decision just shouldn't have a final effect until -- not

9

for a very long time, only for the minimum possible time,

10

until the judge decides the --

11

QUESTION:

Why wouldn't a stay by the judge, if

12

the judge thought there was any question about it, why

13

wouldn't that have sufficed in that context as well?

14

MR. FELDMAN:

15

look at the Freedman decision --

16
17

QUESTION:

Yes, but that would be changing the

status quo.

18

MR. FELDMAN:

QUESTION:

21

situations.

22

That would, but I think you could

Excuse me.

That would be changing the status

The State problem is different in the two

MR. FELDMAN:

The stay, in my view, in our view

23

those are really procedural due process issues and not

24

First Amendment issues, but I think that would be

25

sufficient.

I think you can look at the Court's decision
48

1

in Freedman as essentially saying that the -- saying that

2

either a judge has to grant a stay in each one of these

3

cases regardless of the merits, or there has to be a

4

prompt judicial determination within a very short period

5

of time.

6

QUESTION:

Yes, but the stay in the case

7

involving an initial issue, a stay would be a mandate to

8

grant the license, rather than a stay to maintain the

9

status quo.

10

MR. FELDMAN:

11

QUESTION:

12

That's correct.

That's correct.

So it's really not a stay, it's more

of a mandamus.

13

MR. FELDMAN:

That's correct, but I -- that's

14

correct.

That's correct, but I do think the difference is

15

that in the initial -- whether, in -- under a procedural

16

due process analysis there is a difference.

17

Amendment the question is, is that speech occurring during

18

that period of time, and how long a period of time can

19

that be allowed to happen.

For the First

20

The decisions that the city makes in a scheme

21

like this are decisions about things like whether there

22

were minors in the store, what was the age of the people,

23

were they there, were they not there, were the booths

24

covered or were they not covered so that you could be able

25

to tell what was going on inside them, was there sexual
49

1

activity that some of the patrons were engaging in or not.

2

Those are very, very different from the kinds of

3

decisions that were made in the Freedman context, and

4

since those decisions are the kinds of things that

5

municipalities make in generally in enforcing police

6

power-type ordinances, there's no reason for them not to

7

be given, in fact, when they make them.

8

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Feldman.

Mr. Olson, you have 4 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFF S. OLSON

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. OLSON:

Thank you.

If I'm operating a radio

13

station and the city takes my license away because I've

14

let the fence around my tower get into slight disrepair,

15

and my defense is that the provision of the ordinance that

16

says you can lose your license for having your fence in

17

disrepair slightly is unconstitutional, I can't even raise

18

that defense until I get to court, and if I don't get

19

prompt judicial review or a stay of the status quo and be

20

allowed to operate until my judicial decision, I will in

21

all likelihood be out of business and I won't have any

22

effective judicial review on that constitutional defense,

23

and the administrative process can't touch that

24

constitutional argument.

25

This Court's decisions are clear that delay in a
50

1

licensing process can lead to content-based censorship

2

just as easy as lack of standards, even in a situation

3

where licensing decisions are not expressly based on the

4

content of the material.

5

Lakewood I think also warns us that an ongoing

6

business is a more likely target of content-based

7

discrimination in the licensing process at the

8

administrative level.

9

QUESTION:

The -Then I don't understand why the

10

proper answer isn't, because there is this danger, the

11

court will look at it case-by-case and if, indeed, this is

12

a situation where the administrator is abusing authority

13

to disguise what is really content-based regulation, the

14

court can say in that situation, we put a freeze on it.

15

We allow you to keep your license pending the decision.

16

But if there's no basis for that, so that it is

17

just a time, place, and manner-type restraint, why should

18

you be able to maintain the status quo, which is, allowed

19

to go on with the business, in face of very serious

20

charges of violations that have nothing to do with the

21

content of the books and tapes that are sold?

22

MR. OLSON:

On the face of the ordinance, those

23

violations may or may not be very serious.

24

required for one single, trivial violation of a provision

25

of the ordinance that may well be unconstitutional.
51

Nonrenewal is

We

1

can't test the constitutionality of that provision on the

2

face of the ordinance until we get to court.

3

There are really large numbers of people out

4

there, highly motivated, with influence in municipal

5

affairs, who are waiting for this Court to give them an

6

opening for the covert censorship of sexually explicit

7

speech through delay of licensure, or through any other

8

method that allows room for indirect action.

9

Not only my client, as an adult book store, but

10

other people who are engaging in unpopular speech and

11

mainstream media ask this Court not to create that opening

12

for covert censorship by delay of the judicial review

13

until that delay becomes fatal to many businesses who

14

won't have meaningful judicial review because they'll just

15

die on the vine while they're waiting for a judicial

16

decision.

17

A temporary injunction that they have to take

18

the burden of getting in circuit court is not going to be

19

an answer.

20

time-consuming and expensive measure that, as Justice

21

Harlan, concurring in Shuttlesworth, said, you shouldn't

22

have to engage in to pursue your free speech rights, and

23

second, it's a flawed process because you have to wait for

24

the administrative record to prove you've got a chance of

25

prevailing.

First of all, it's the kind of cumbersome and
