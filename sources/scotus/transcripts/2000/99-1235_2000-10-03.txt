ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and

may it please the Court:
The central flaw in the jurisdictional and the

12

enforceability of holdings in the court of appeals in this

13

case is the manifest hostility that court demonstrated

14

towards arbitration.

15

is, to use a phrase that this court used in similar

16

circumstances, quote, far out of step with this Court's

17

endorsement over the past 15 years of arbitration as an

18

effective and an efficient method of dispute resolution of

19

Federal statutory claims.

20

QUESTION:

The view reflected in those holdings

I can understand your

21

characterization of the second holding that way about the

22

possibility that the arbitration might entail costs, but

23

the jurisdictional holding, do you think that manifests a

24

hostility to arbitration?

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

I do, Mr. Chief Justice, largely
3

1

because it's reasonably clear that had the Court treated

2

that order as an interlocutory order, then this matter

3

would have gone immediately to arbitration, and the

4

arbitration process would have been allowed to go forward.

5

By treating it as a final judgment, as the Court did, it

6

then undertook to review the merits of arbitrability --

7

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Phillips, there was a

8

crucial difference here.

9

all the claims.

The Court purported to dismiss

It didn't just enter a stay order, as

10

would typically be the case.

11

dismissed, and I take it that would mean then that the

12

statute of limitations might run before the case ever got

13

back, or something like that, and isn't there a real

14

difference between the entry of a stay order pending the

15

arbitration versus a dismissal?

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

It said everything else is

There is no question, Justice

17

O'Connor, that this case would have and probably should

18

have been dealt with as a stay order.

19

QUESTION:

Yes.

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

Section 3 of the Federal

21

Arbitration Act quite plainly states that the Court shall

22

enter a stay.

23

clear his docket, although that was not specifically our

24

request.

25

In this context I think he did this to

That was his decision.
QUESTION:

Well, why is that wrong,
4

1

Mr. Phillips, if what the district judge says is, gee,

2

there's nothing before me, I think every single issue in

3

this case belongs in the arbitral forum, so I'm going to

4

dismiss, and I look at section 3.

5

telling me is, don't move forward.

6

dismissal, but it's stay versus letting the case continue.

7

What I see that as
It's not stay versus

Why should a district judge who says, there's

8

nothing to come back to me, this is not a case where some

9

issues are to be referred to other -- to the arbitral

10

forum, and then there are other issues that I'll decide

11

after the arbitration.

12

a district judge to say, there's nothing here for me to

13

decide, everything is for the arbitrator?

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

Why isn't it perfectly proper for

Well, I think at the end of the

15

day this is still an embedded proceeding, and even though

16

he ultimately dismisses everything, it is certainly

17

available to come back to him at the end of the

18

arbitration and have these issues reviewed, and it would

19

certainly be much easier --

20

QUESTION:

What issues?

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

22

QUESTION:

-- as a matter of judicial --

What issues?

In this case, as I

23

understand it, I understand the formal distinction.

24

is the plaintiff consumer suing rather than an action to

25

order arbitration, but it seems to me even if you're right
5

This

1

that the district judge should have stayed, what in fact

2

happened was the district judge dismissed, total, case

3

gone, and that seems to me as final a judgment as there

4

could be.

You could argue, he shouldn't have done that.

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

6

QUESTION:

Right.

Just like erroneously entering

7

summary judgment, we don't say it isn't the final

8

judgment.

9

defendant.

Judge says, I award summary judgment to
Plaintiff says, gee, judge, you shouldn't have

10

done that, but it doesn't make the judgment any less final

11

that the judge maybe should have done something other than

12

dismiss.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, if you take it to the flip

14

side, though, Justice Ginsburg, what happens in the

15

situation where you deny summary judgment but style it as

16

formally a final judgment, even though it in fact isn't a

17

final --

18

QUESTION:

It doesn't matter how you style it.

19

You've got something before you.

20

something.

21

If a district judge disassociates itself from the case,

22

that's the classic definition of a final judgment.

It doesn't matter what label you pin to it.

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

24

QUESTION:

25

You've held onto

Well, I --

This district judge says, out.

This

case isn't here any more, gone, as distinguished from, I'm
6

1

entering an interlocutory order. It's not what's --

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

Clearly that's not what the judge

3

did here, and the question is, what should an appellate

4

court do when it's presented with this particular problem,

5

and my answer to you is to recognize that the dismissal in

6

this context was an inappropriate way to proceed, treat it

7

as a stay, and therefore conclude that it was not

8

appropriate to go beyond that, and entertain the question

9

of arbitrability, because to do that is to create a new

10

class of problems under section 16 that otherwise wouldn't

11

exist.

12

We know that if it's a true independent action

13

and you order something to arbitration, then there's an

14

appeal on that --

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

17
18

But when you say treat it as --- but that's the only case like

that.
QUESTION:

When you say treat it as, you're

19

already saying -- this district judge says, dismissed.

20

Treat it as, district judge, your wrong, you should not

21

have dismissed, we have to review and reverse at least

22

that much to say, you should not have dismissed the case,

23

you should have stayed it.

24
25

So I could see if you're right about that, that
the proper result here is always stay, never dismiss, then

1

the court of appeals says, this judge was wrong in

2

dismissing, we certainly have to review that, that's as

3

final as it could be, and on the merits of that decision

4

to dismiss, just as we would do with a summary judgment,

5

we say, district judge, you're wrong, you had no authority

6

to dismiss, you should have stayed.

7

courts of appeals treat dismissals that are wrong as if

8

the judge had not dismissed.

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

I don't know that

Well, the ultimate question, it

10

seems to me, Justice Ginsburg, is going to be whether you

11

treat form or substance in this context as the most

12

important, because it's pretty clear to me that while the

13

judge did, in fact, formally dismiss the action, what was

14

both required under section 3 of the Federal Arbitration

15

Act and what we asked for him to do was to stay this.

16

This is the plaintiff's choice of forum.

17

There's no reason the case couldn't have stayed

18

there.

We can respond directly to the Chief Justice's and

19

Justice O'Connor's concerns about judicial administration

20

by retaining the case under those circumstances, and we

21

can fulfill the overall purposes of the Federal

22

Arbitration Act appellate review standards by insisting

23

that matters, when all doubts are -- you know, when you

24

can resolve all doubts in favor of making sure they go to

25

arbitration, rather than go through what we are today,
8

1

which is having adjudicated this issue at three different

2

levels of the Federal court system over 5 years, tens of

3

thousands of dollars, and we're no closer today to

4

resolving the merits of this dispute over the $15 charge

5

and whether that's a finance charge or not --

6

QUESTION:

Sure, but if you lose this case it

7

won't take another 5 years and another case, because

8

everybody will know pretty much where we stand.

9
10
11
12
13

MR. PHILLIPS:
QUESTION:

Well, there's no question --

I mean, the problem of the long

litigation here is that you've got an unresolved question.
MR. PHILLIPS:

There's no question about that,

Justice Souter.

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

16

QUESTION:

You -What we need is an answer.

You said the -- we should see this as

17

a choice of form versus substance.

18

versus substance problem, in effect, whichever way we go?

19

I understand your form and substance argument here, but if

20

we follow the embedded-independent distinction we've got a

21

form and substance problem, too, and it seems to me that

22

if we follow the embedded-independent distinction we are

23

in effect going to be leaving it up to a matter of

24

pleading in a great many instances as to what the

25

appealability may be, and let me just throw out the
9

Haven't we got a form

1

suggestion that we might be better off to let district

2

judges, in effect, make the form-substance distinction and

3

decide the appealability question than leave it to parties

4

who are pleading to make that distinction for us.

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think where we ought to look

6

for the appropriate legal standard is the statutory

7

scheme, and I think Congress clearly incorporated embedded

8

versus independent into the subcomponents of section 16.

9

They clearly recognize there are independent proceedings

10

and there are embedded proceedings, and it has specific

11

rules about how appeals ought to be followed in that

12

course.

13

So to be sure, there may be some potential for

14

manipulation by the parties, but I don't know of much

15

evidence to reflect that that's any kind of a problem, and

16

Congress essentially bought into that distinction in 1988

17

when it adopted the statute in the form that it did.

18

QUESTION:

Well, it did set forth specific

19

rules, but it certainly didn't adopt the embedded-

20

nonembedded criterion as a test for anything else, and the

21

word it used for appealability was a classic word that has

22

nothing to do with embedded versus nonembedded.

23

if that's what they meant by final, you know, final

24

decision, they should have said something else.

25

very strange word to use to convey embedded versus
10

I mean,

It's a

1

nonembedded.

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

To be sure, Congress could have

3

been clearer here, and I think what the Court said in

4

Cortez-Byrd last term applies equally here, that

5

enlightenment is not going to come from parsing the

6

language of this particular statute.

7

At the end of the day what we know is that the

8

final decision language in section 16(a)(3) covers the

9

classic situation involving an independent proceeding.

10

Whether it should be extended beyond that to a new class

11

of claims that will interfere with the implementation of

12

the goals of arbitration is the issue before this Court.

13

I find it difficult to get passionate about this

14

because I believe Justice Souter is right, at the end of

15

the day what really matters is that we have a rule.

16

we have a rule, the rest of us will presumably --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

19
20

Once

What did they mean --- be able to line up behind that

rule.
QUESTION:

What did the -- the only -- I'm

21

totally puzzled, frankly, by this statute, and I did

22

notice the only people who seem to understand it, because

23

I guess they wrote it, was the judicial conference, and

24

they put in the legislative history that it would allow

25

appeals from final judgments, including the final judgment
11

1

in an action to compel arbitration, or a final action

2

dismissing an action in deference to arbitration, so I

3

didn't see that last -- what could that last statement

4

mean, other than this case?

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think that last statement could

6

be read directly to apply to this case.

7

was meant, and whether Congress adopted that, I've no

8

idea.

9

QUESTION:

Whether or not it

I mean, it's not a -- an obvious

10

thing that you would want to allow an appeal in this kind

11

of a case.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

13

QUESTION:

14
15
16

Exactly.

And it's not obvious that you

wouldn't.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Oh, I think it's quite obvious

you would not want --

17

QUESTION:

Why not?

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

-- to appeal in this -- no,

19

Justice Breyer -- that's wrong.

20

you would not want to go through the delay and

21

forestalling, allowing these matters to go to arbitration.

22

That's what the parties voluntarily agree to.

23

QUESTION:

It is clear to me that

But you do the other way.

You see,

24

there's situation A, where a plaintiff -- a plaintiff

25

wants arbitration, and the defendant doesn't.
12

1
2

MR. PHILLIPS:
talking about.

3
4

QUESTION:

That's right.

Well, the plaintiff

would love to go to arbitration, defendant doesn't.

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

6

QUESTION:

7

An independent action you're

Right.

So what is he supposed to do?

The

defendant won't show up in the room, won't set it up.

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

QUESTION:

Right.

He goes to court and asks the judge,

10

judge, send him to arbitration, and the judge does or he

11

doesn't.

Either way, he gets an appeal.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

15

QUESTION:

16

That's correct.

Either way.
No question.

Now, the converse case, the plaintiff

does not want arbitration, but the defendant does.

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

18

QUESTION:

Right.

The plaintiff runs into court and

19

brings his case.

The defendant says, judge, send me to

20

arbitration.

21

arbitration, there's an immediate appeal, and if he does

22

send him to arbitration, on your view he's out to lunch,

23

stuck.

If the judge doesn't send him to

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

QUESTION:

Right, because --

On their view it's at least -13

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

2

QUESTION:

3

-- consistent.

MR. PHILLIPS:

5

QUESTION:

7

You know, both

ways --

4

6

Right.

Well --

-- you get an appeal under both

situations.
MR. PHILLIPS:

It's not consistent in the sense

8

that if you look at the way 16(a) and 16(b) are set up,

9

they really are designed basically to say if you have an

10

ultimate order that says arbitrate you don't want to go to

11

appeal, and if you don't --

12

QUESTION:

But you can do it where it's --

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

There is -- there is a --

-- where's the --- there's a single exception,

16

that's true, Justice Breyer.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, that's a big exception.
And all I'm saying is, the

19

question is, do you want to drag in another exception

20

under these circumstances where it's a perfectly sensible

21

to say, what should have been entered in here in this

22

context was a stay that's not appealable, and in the

23

future, go on forward in other cases.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, if we look at the language of

the statute dealing with the final decision, we look at
14

1

the fact that it was a dismissal, so we say, okay, there's

2

jurisdiction.

3
4

Now are you going to talk about question 2?

MR. PHILLIPS:
2.

I'd love to talk about question

Thank you, Justice O'Connor.

5

(Laughter.)

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

Obviously, if the Court finds

7

that there is jurisdiction, the hostility that I mentioned

8

at the outset of my argument applies with particular force

9

with respect to the presumption that the court of appeals

10
11

employed in deciding -QUESTION:

May I ask a question, to be sure I

12

get it in before the hour goes by, on question 2.

13

think there are -- let's assume you're dead right, that

14

the arbitration clause does not have to specify the costs

15

in detail and so forth.

16

wondering in -- take care of this one -- in which an

17

arbitration clause could be so one-sided that it's not

18

enforceable?

19

Do you

Now, are there cases, and I'm

This clause, as I read it, preserves the

20

company's right to judicial remedy.

21

arbitration clause shall not interfere with their right to

22

use the judicial process to secure relief, but it does

23

interfere with the other side's right.

24

whether that's sufficiently one-sided to raise a question

25

or not, but are there clauses that are so one-sided that
15

It says the

Now, I don't know

1

it might not be enforceable?

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

There may well be.

My -- let me

3

answer the first part which is that we know -- is that --

4

is the particular imbalance in this clause sufficient to

5

render this unenforceable.

6

the other side to have argued that.

7

below, they -- clearly that was rejected because the

8

district court analyzed and dealt with all of the

9

unconscionability issues, so I don't think that issue's on

10
11

I don't -- I don't understand
If they did argue it

the table.
With respect -- I mean, is it possible to have

12

an arbitration clause that says in order to get entry into

13

arbitration you -- you know, the plaintiff would have to

14

file a million dollars, I think obviously a clause like

15

that would be unenforceable under those circumstances

16

because it would interfere with the ultimate enforcement

17

of the statutory right, and that is one of the conditions

18

of allowing arbitration of general statutory claims, and I

19

don't have any problem with that.

20

The problem is that if you have a clause like

21

the one we have in this case, which is silent on these

22

issues, the clear presumption, then, must be that you

23

would favor arbitration.

24

costs are going to be extreme or excessive.

25

QUESTION:

You would not assume all of the

You're saying in effect that the
16

1

burden is on the person challenging the fairness of the

2

clause to show some unfairness --

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

4

QUESTION:

That --

-- and that the, what, the Eleventh

5

Circuit here just, without any showing on the part of

6

the -- that party simply said because it might --

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

That is exactly right, Mr. Chief

8

Justice.

The Eleventh Circuit said we will presume all of

9

the potential costs, large filing fees, pay for the costs

10

of the arbitrator and pay for everything else, without any

11

showing being made by the plaintiff under the

12

circumstances of this case, and therefore we're going to

13

say that there is an inherent conflict.

14

What I suggest to you is that the language,

15

inherent conflict, doesn't remotely entertain that kind of

16

an analysis.

17

QUESTION:

Is the relief you're asking for on

18

that ground that we send it back and give the plaintiff

19

the opportunity to make that showing?

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

The plaintiff had the

21

opportunity to make that showing.

22

opportunity to engage in all of the discovery she wanted

23

to.

24

materials from the American Arbitration Association over

25

the transom to try to make some kind of a showing.

She had a full and fair

She chose, on a motion to reconsider, to throw some

17

1

The answer is, she should go to arbitration,

2

ascertain whether the arbitrator -- whether the fees for

3

arbitration would be waived, what the costs of the

4

arbitrator will be, and then, if it turns out at the end

5

of the day that either those costs are unconscionable as a

6

matter of state law --

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, from what you just said

8

I take it you disagree with the D.C. Circuit.

The D.C.

9

Circuit said, plaintiffs, employees -- and I take it

10

consumers would fall in that same boat.

11

not go to an arbitration if they're gong to face the

12

possibility, which they never face in court -- in court,

13

they don't have to pay the judge.

14

They're going to

Arbitrators sometimes charge a lot of money per

15

hour of their time, so unless the contract says, or unless

16

the court reads into the contract that the seller in this

17

case, or the finance company, the employer in that case,

18

pays at least for the judge, then this would be an

19

unconscionable arrangement.

20

consumer or the employee to pay the judge, and that has to

21

be clear.

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

You can't require the

I think that the decision of the

23

court in Cole is completely premature for this Court to

24

entertain at this point in time, because we don't know

25

what kinds of costs we're talking about.
18

In the record

1

before the D.C. Circuit in Cole, they had some evidence

2

about what they thought the costs would be, given the

3

nature of those claims.

4

that.

5

Here, we have no evidence like

Is it possible in a particular case that the

6

court could declare something unenforceable because the

7

costs are too great?

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

10

Well, but -As I say, yes, I think you could

but --

11

QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, supposing that, unlike

12

the case here, the person objecting to arbitration had

13

made a significant showing in the district court, not

14

going to arbitration but saying, look, here are some

15

figures from past arbitrations; we think this is going to

16

be just like this one; the party who wanted to go to

17

arbitration doesn't contradict that; the district court

18

says yes, these kind of costs are going to be incurred in

19

the arbitration, and therefore it's unconscionable.

20

don't see why the -- that party should have to go to

21

arbitration if they can make a persuasive showing to the

22

court.

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

I

I don't disagree with that,

24

Mr. Chief Justice.

I think that you have either of two

25

ways to try to prove up your case, either through

1

discovery, which she had a full and fair opportunity to

2

do, and didn't present any evidence with respect to that,

3

or, assuming that there's going to be doubts -- and I

4

think all doubts, again, ought to be resolved in favor of

5

pushing toward arbitration in order to ascertain this.

6

Remember, if you read the American Arbitration

7

Association's amicus brief it says that they consistently

8

waive their filing fees, they often reduce arbitrator's

9

fees, and we know -- and it's the reason why I think it

10

makes much more sense for the court to entertain these

11

issues after an arbitration rather than before an

12

arbitration -- is that we may find out at the end of the

13

day, if the plaintiff prevails, that all of those costs go

14

back to her, and so she's really out of pocket nothing

15

except for the marginal costs during the pendency of the

16

proceedings.

17

QUESTION:

But supposing the arbitration, say,

18

goes on for a week, and the arbitrator's time is consumed,

19

and the plaintiff's, and the defendant's, and then it

20

turns out that a court is going to find the arrangements

21

were unconscionable, that the plaintiff was required to

22

put up thousands of dollars, or the party objecting, and

23

so you've basically spun your wheels in the arbitration

24

proceeding.

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, hopefully that wouldn't
20

1

happen, obviously, and you wouldn't expect it to happen

2

very often, but again I don't disagree with you, Mr. Chief

3

Justice.

4

If what you're saying is, should the plaintiff

5

have an opportunity to prove unconscionability at the

6

outset of the process, I don't have any problem with that,

7

assuming she does more than what she did here, which was

8

to say, I'm not going to arbitration, I'm not going to do

9

anything, I'm simply going to put in a study from the AAA

10

which may or may not apply to the circumstances of this

11

case.

12

they're willing to pay for the fees in the circumstances a

13

la what the D.C. Circuit required in the Cole case.

14

I'm not even going to ask Green Tree whether or not

QUESTION:

Well, she had other reasons, too, and

15

one the Eleventh Circuit didn't deal with because they

16

didn't have to, and that is, she said, I don't have to go

17

to arbitration because under the Truth-in-Lending Act I

18

have a right to make this a class action and I'm not going

19

to get the class action.

20

The Eleventh Circuit, as I understand it, said

21

we're not going to address that issue because we've

22

already decided she has to have security that she's not

23

going to have to pay for the arbitrator under any

24

circumstances.

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

They make that argument, and they
21

1

ask the Court in this case to affirm on that alternative

2

ground, and our position here is that there is no

3

distinction between this case and Gilmer with respect to

4

the treatment of class action.

5

to a class action --

6
7

QUESTION:

There is no greater right

Yes, but we can't address that as a

matter of first view.

I mean, the --

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

QUESTION:

As a matter, I'm sorry, of what?

First view.

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

11

QUESTION:

Oh, first view.

The Eleventh Circuit didn't address

12

it at all.

It said, that's a question we leave open.

We

13

don't have to get to it on our theory of the case.

14

theory of the case is that the party seeking arbitration

15

has to pay the arbitrator, period.

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

17

QUESTION:

Our

Right.

So we -- so at least I feel that the

18

class that question, whether there could be arbitration at

19

all because of the class action provision of the Truth-

20

in-Lending Act, we can't address that in this proceeding

21

because it hasn't been aired below.

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, you know

23

as well as I do that it's largely a matter of the court's

24

discretion what alternative grounds which are asserted by

25

a party in litigation to defend a judgment the court will
22

1

entertain.

2

They have raised a class action issue.

We have

3

responded to the class action issue.

The Court of Appeals

4

for the Third Circuit in a recent decision in Johnson,

5

which we filed a supplemental brief on, has exhaustively

6

analyzed the class action issue, and the bottom line is

7

there is nothing in TILA that is any more pro-class action

8

than there was in the Age Discrimination in Employment

9

Act, which this Court held in Gilmer did not prevent

10

enforceability of the arbitration clause in that context

11

and, indeed, TILA has provisions that clearly envision

12

providing significant opportunities for plaintiffs to

13

recover in these kinds of cases.

14
15

There are statutory damages provisions that give
significant moneys even without showing of injury --

16
17

QUESTION:
in here --

18
19

The -- you're saying there's enough

MR. PHILLIPS:

-- and there are attorney's fees

and reasonable costs.

20

QUESTION:

-- for us to deal with the class

21

action issue, but you've mentioned Gilmer more than once,

22

and one of the things about Gilmer that struck me is that

23

the securities industry said, unlike what you're saying --

24

you say, wait and see.

25

does.

Let's see what the arbitrator

We're not going to tell you one way or the other.
23

1

The securities industry said, we pay for the judge, and so

2

that was out of the case.

3

When Gilmer came to this Court it was presented

4

with a situation where the employee was not going to have

5

to pay the cost of the arbitrator because the party

6

seeking arbitration, the securities industry, said,

7

what -- don't worry about that.

8
9

MR. PHILLIPS:

We pay the arbitrator.

But the problem with the

situation is that you don't presume, in the face of

10

silence, that there's going to be a problem with going to

11

arbitration.

12

This Court has said consistently for 15 years,

13

in interpreting the relationship between the Federal

14

Arbitration Act and Federal statutes, that we presume they

15

should go to arbitration and, if there are gaps, we assume

16

that the arbitrator will provide for them and we know, as

17

this case comes to the Court at this point based on both

18

what was in the record below and what the amici briefs

19

have shown, is that this does not need to be an expensive

20

enterprise.

21

either filing fees or arbitrator's fees.

22

It may not cost her anything with respect to

QUESTION:

In taking this position you have to

23

be saying the D.C. Circuit not only was premature, but it

24

was just wrong.

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

No.
24

1

QUESTION:

Because as I read the D.C. Circuit

2

they said, to make this contract fair and enforceable, it

3

must be not the arbitrator's decision, it must be, as a

4

matter of law, that the party seeking arbitration pays for

5

the arbitrator, as a matter of law, not for the individual

6

arbitrator to decide in each arbitration.

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

I am troubled, Justice Ginsburg,

8

by the idea that you would adopt a rule judicially that,

9

as a matter of law, one party must always front the costs

10

regardless of the circumstances of the particular case,

11

and I agree with you, to that extent I think the D.C.

12

Circuit's opinion is overbroad.

13

I don't know whether it would necessarily be

14

applied as broadly as the language seems to suggest, but

15

what I do know is that the problems inherent in that kind

16

of a rule, which has not been tested particularly, are

17

such that it's completely premature for this Court to go

18

down that path.

19

was before the district judge when that court decided to

20

send it to arbitration, and what was before that judge at

21

that time was, silence, which you construe favorably to

22

arbitration and therefore send the matter to arbitration

23

with no further judicial review.

24
25

Where this Court ought to focus is, what

QUESTION:

Did your client makes its position on

this issue known to the district court, what the -- how
25

1

the costs would be allocated and so forth, or did they

2

just say, we'll fight it out when we get to the

3

arbitrator?

4
5

MR. PHILLIPS:

We said -- we were never asked

specifically our views with respect to this.

6

QUESTION:

You didn't volunteer them, of course.

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, the issue came up in a

8

motion to reconsider, Justice Stevens.

9

time they suggested that these costs were excessive.

10

That was the first

They did raise the class action earlier in the

11

process, but they didn't raise the question of costs

12

specifically and, frankly, even in the Eleventh Circuit

13

the cost question was more of a second thought than it was

14

a primary portion or focus of the attention of the court.

15

If you're asking me, would we pay those costs in

16

most cases, I can tell you that I know that Green Tree

17

does pay those costs in a lot of instances, but that's the

18

whole point.

The plaintiff has the obligation --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

Even if they --- at least to ask that question.

They pay the costs even if they

didn't lose?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Even if we didn't lose.

We front

24

the costs at a minimum, and oftentimes we can't get those

25

costs back.
26

1
2

If there are no questions, further questions,
I'd reserve the balance of my time.

3

QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Phillips.

4

Mr. Sellers, we'll hear from you.

5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH M. SELLERS

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7
8

MR. SELLERS:
the Court:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

I am happy to address the first issue briefly,
and then turn to the second issue, second question.

11

Very importantly, the Federal Arbitration Act

12

did not divest the district courts of discretion to

13

dismiss cases, as the district judge did here, as opposed

14

to staying a case.

15

discretion, exercised the discretion and, as Justice

16

Ginsburg observed, I think once the decision was made to

17

dismiss with prejudice there was nothing else left for the

18

Court to do, and that satisfied the classic standard of

19

finality that made it subject to immediate appellate

20

review.

21

QUESTION:

Therefore, the district court had that

But Mr. Sellers, if you took the

22

position that I thought Mr. Phillips -- he will straighten

23

us out on it -- was embracing at this argument, although

24

not in his brief, that Alabama -- the amici, The Housing

25

Institute took, they said, yeah, you could say this was a
27

1

dismissal in the final judgment, but the Eleventh Circuit

2

should say, district judge, you're wrong, because you

3

don't have any authority to dismiss.

4

because section 3 says must stay.

5

MR. SELLERS:

You must stay,

Actually, Justice Ginsburg, I

6

don't think that's a fair reading of the Federal

7

Arbitration Act.

8

there's nothing inconsistent about section 3, as the

9

majority of the circuit courts have recognized, and

10
11

Section 3 says you must stay, but

ultimate dismissal.
Section 3 was designed to ensure that there

12

would be no further pursuit of the merits of the action,

13

that that would be the end of the litigation of the action

14

in that court until the arbitration concluded.

15

nothing improper, however, about a dismissal following

16

that and, by the way, if I might just add, Green Tree did

17

ask to dismiss this case.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. SELLERS:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. SELLERS:

There's

They --

They alternately --- requested --

Alternately they -Alternately, that's correct, and

22

the district court, if nothing else in responding to Green

23

Tree's request for relief, was properly -- acted properly

24

in granting that request.

25

But even if Green Tree had not requested the
28

1

dismissal, there's nothing impermissible about a

2

dismissal.

3

Arbitration Act in any respect divested the district

4

courts of a fundamental aspect of the discretion --

5

Again, I must add, I don't think the Federal

QUESTION:

Well, even if there is something

6

improper about a dismissal, it's nonetheless a

7

dismissal --

8

MR. SELLERS:

9

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

-- isn't it?

I don't think we're in

10

the habit of looking into whether the dismissal was

11

correct or not and deciding whether something was

12

appealable.

13

MR. SELLERS:

That's correct, and the Eleventh

14

Circuit permit -- was legitimately entitled to rely on the

15

dismissal as a basis for appeal --

16

QUESTION:

Well, suppose that you -- this is

17

what's bothering me a lot.

You have a plaintiff bringing

18

a claim.

19

II, nothing to do with arbitration, III, nothing to do

20

with it, count IV, arbitration's at issue.

Count 1, nothing to do with arbitration.

Count

21

The judge, instead of staying it, dismisses it.

22

MR. SELLERS:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. SELLERS:

25

That --

Appeal?
That I think would be reversible

error, Your Honor, because I think it's clear that that
29

1

would not be an interlocutory -- that would be an

2

interlocutory --

3

QUESTION:

So you'd have to -- the other side

4

would have to cross-appeal.

5

would say is, this should have been stayed and not

6

dismissed.

7

MR. SELLERS:

8

QUESTION:

9

They would say -- what they

That's correct.

All right.

Now, what's bothering me

about accepting your position, which is very logical and

10

may be absolutely the right one, but we're going to create

11

now a whole spin-off web of law, and the web of law is

12

going to be -- because the first thing that's going to

13

happen every time, you see -- not every time, but what

14

will happen is the judge -- the plaintiff brings a case.

15

Judge dismisses it.

16

appeal, and there will be a cross-appeal, and the claim

17

will be that in fact this is a case where there should

18

have been a stay, and not a dismissal.

Aha, says the plaintiff, now I can

19

MR. SELLERS:

20

QUESTION:

But --

And pretty soon rules of law will

21

develop as to just when it's the one, and when it's the

22

other, and all that means, delay, delay, delay, the very

23

opposite of what the Arbitration Act is designed to do.

24
25

MR. SELLERS:

Justice Breyer, I think the rules

could be articulated fairly clearly that will avoid the
30

1

multiplicity of appeals that concern you.

If there is

2

a -- in the hypothetical you gave, where the referral to

3

arbitration did not refer all claims that were pending

4

before the court --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. SELLERS:

Mm-hmm.
-- I think it would be reversible

7

error to dismiss the case, or if it was dismissed it would

8

be treated as an interlocutory and the court of appeals

9

could legitimately direct the court to reinstate the case,

10

and --

11

QUESTION:

And you don't think you as a lawyer

12

will be capable, even in my imaginary case, of arguing

13

that, although the judge thought it had nothing to do with

14

it, or it really did, or the judge thought it did but it

15

really didn't, et cetera?

16

MR. SELLERS:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

I

17

think that the law is pretty clear, and the choices that

18

Congress made in enacting section 16(a)3 are pretty clear,

19

and that kind of scenario would not ordinarily give rise

20

to an appealable order and I think, as Justice Souter

21

observed, once the rules are set out here, I think we will

22

all be able to follow them.

23

confusion.

24
25

QUESTION:

Right now there's some

I don't understand what you mean by

saying, if it's dismissed it would be treated as
31

1

interlocutory.

2
3

MR. SELLERS:

I'm sorry.

What I meant was, it

would be reversible error.

4

QUESTION:

And the court of appeals would then

5

instruct the district judges, when there's something left

6

over, of course you don't enter a final dismissal.

7

MR. SELLERS:

8

QUESTION:

9

That's correct.

And that would be -- and that would

be the end of it.

10

MR. SELLERS:

11

QUESTION:

That would be the end of it.

The -- so the court of appeals would

12

take it to final judgment and then say, if there are

13

issues left over, you must stay, not dismiss.

14

are no issues left over, then it was perfectly proper to

15

dismiss.

16

MR. SELLERS:

Right.

If there

If there are no issues

17

left over, the court may have some discretion, but it

18

certainly is permissible to dismiss, as the district court

19

did here, and I would ordinarily think most district

20

courts would dismiss under those circumstances, because

21

there'd be nothing left for the district court to do.

22

QUESTION:

What is your take on the argument

23

that was made in that amicus brief that under section --

24

is it 3?

25

MR. SELLERS:

16(a)3, Your Honor.
32

1

QUESTION:

16(a)3, the words say, must stay.

MR. SELLERS:

Oh, I'm sorry, section 3.

Yes.

Section 3.
Forgive me.

Yes.
The term, must stay, we read to

10

mean that it may not permit.

11

the key is what it's nondiscretionary as to.

12

not -- the district court must stay any litigation of the

13

merits of the underlying claims.

14

the question of whether the district court has discretion,

15

if it refers the entirety of the claims to arbitration, to

Okay.

It is nondiscretionary, but
It may

Thank you.

with.

Correct.

Period.
Correct, and I think that's
33

1

consistent with the way Congress would have viewed it in

2

1925, when it was originally put in place.

3

May I turn to the second issue that I understand

4

is also of central concern to the Court.

5

Mr. Phillips, in using a hypothetical, or responding to a

6

hypothetical of the Court, illustrates the problem with

7

costs, and the reason why the circuit court was correct in

8

holding the agreement unenforceable because of the risk of

9

the imposition of large costs.

10

I think that

The example given, well, suppose the plaintiff

11

was expected to put up $1 million in costs, or, if we can

12

be a little more realistic, suppose the cost of

13

arbitration were $5,000, just the initial

14

arbitration-specific costs, the costs of filing, the cost

15

of the arbitrator, because he or she's setting aside a day

16

or two to come out, they want to check in advance, which

17

often happens, suppose that they have to rent a room,

18

suppose there's a stenographer, and they want all that

19

payment up front.

20

QUESTION:

Well, but you -- you're necessarily

21

requiring -- required to say suppose, Mr. Sellers, because

22

your client made no showing below.

23

MR. SELLERS:

24

QUESTION:

25

Well --

And it seems to me that unless we're

to say that, contrary to our other statements about
34

1

arbitration agreements, that an arbitration agreement is

2

suspect, and unless the party can come in and defend its

3

reasonableness -- why didn't your client make any showing?

4

MR. SELLERS:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, in fact,

5

she tried and she was unsuccessful, but not through any

6

fault of her own.

7

I might begin by noting that she -- that

8

Ms. Randolph did request, and did mention costs, well

9

before this time of reconsideration was --

10
11
12

QUESTION:
on any showing.

But the court of appeals doesn't rely

The court of appeals just speculated.

MR. SELLERS:

Well, the court of appeals is

13

relying on the showing that Ms. Randolph made of the

14

average cost from a AAA survey because, notwithstanding

15

her request for discovery, and she filed a motion for

16

discovery, I might add, which is found -- it's docket

17

number 11 in the --

18

QUESTION:

19
20

And this is discovery going to the

costs of the arbitration?
MR. SELLERS:

It was discovery with respect to

21

arbitration procedures.

22

which I think is fairly -- could be fairly construed to

23

include costs.

24
25

It was not -- it was procedures

That motion, pursuant to that motion she
eventually took a deposition pursuant to rule 30(b)(6).
35

1

That was taken in December of 1996. It is not in the

2

record, and in that deposition testimony was elicited

3

about whether Green Tree was prepared to -- the question

4

specifically was posed as to the cost of arbitration.

5
6

QUESTION:

Well now, are you -- if it's not in

the record, is it properly before us?

7

MR. SELLERS:

It is not properly before the

8

Court, and I want to explain why it was not put in the

9

record.

10

QUESTION:

Well, but if it isn't in the record,

11

and it's not properly before the Court, I should think

12

that would be the end of it.

13

MR. SELLERS:

Very well, Mr. Chief Justice.

I

14

merely want to note its existence, because I think if the

15

Court is not satisfied with the showing that was made on

16

costs, I would like it to entertain the request, or the

17

question that Justice Stevens put to my colleague, and

18

that is that a remand be permitted so that the record may

19

be more fully substantiated.

20

I might add that Green Tree, during the course

21

of this litigation, was asked -- was -- there was

22

litigation over the issue of costs both at the district

23

court and the court of appeals.

24

oral argument, as is apparent from the appeal -- from the

25

opinion from the Eleventh Circuit about the costs, and it
36

Green Tree was asked at

1

was unprepared to say that there were specific costs, or,

2

as Mr. Phillips has now allowed, that they might very well

3

allow costs in the outset.

4

QUESTION:

The court of appeals, as I understand

5

its opinion, didn't talk about actual costs.

6

said that because these might -- these things might

7

happen.

8
9

MR. SELLERS:

It simply

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I

think --

10

QUESTION:

You know, you've put the burden --

11

MR. SELLERS:

12

QUESTION:

I understand --

-- basically on the parties seeking

13

arbitration, rather than on the party challenging the

14

arbitration.

15

MR. SELLERS:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. SELLERS:

I --

I question the propriety of that.
I understand, Mr. Chief Justice.

18

I refer now to the section of the opinion that's found at

19

appendix 17(a) and (b) -- I'm sorry, 17(a) and 18(a),

20

where the Eleventh Circuit refers to some questions and

21

answers given to it by the -- by Green Tree's counsel at

22

argument, and they asked about whether AAA rules are

23

normally used.

24
25

They say, we don't typically do that.

Then it says, the opinion on top of page 18(a)
says, Green Tree also asserted at oral argument the
37

1

arbitrator may apportion the fees of the arbitration in

2

his award, but that provides no guarantee that a consumer

3

successfully arbitrating under this clause will not be

4

saddled with a prohibitive cost order, and it goes on.

5
6

They were asked and given an opportunity,
apparently, to indicate what are the costs for --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. SELLERS:

9
10

Why should the burden be on them?
Well, I think that the -- there

was -QUESTION:

They weren't challenging the

11

arbitration agreement.

12

MR. SELLERS:

Your client was.
I understand, but I think that's

13

part of the record that we have here as to what those --

14

there was a consistent difficulty in pinning down Green

15

Tree as to what the costs were.

16

QUESTION:

Why doesn't Alabama law cover that?

17

I mean, maybe it -- I found, or my law clerk found a case

18

here involving Green Tree where the Alabama supreme court

19

says, where a clause in a contract is silent on a

20

particular question, notions of fairness and settled

21

principles of Alabama law prevent us from deciding the

22

question by indulging in assumption that the proof would

23

support a worst-case scenario.

24

MR. SELLERS:

25

QUESTION:

It's a rather --

I understand.

So why, following just Alabama law,
38

1

wouldn't you say, well, what we're going to do is assume

2

that it will be interpreted in a reasonable way that would

3

support the arbitration --

4

MR. SELLERS:

Because -- because, Justice

5

Breyer, that would put Ms. Randolph in the untenable

6

position where, in the pursuit of a claim that had

7

economic damages of about $15, she would be forced to go

8

forward with an arbitration on the presumption that the

9

fees and costs would ultimately be allocable in a fair way

10

without knowing what that would be --

11

QUESTION:

I don't think that --

12

MR. SELLERS:

13

QUESTION:

-- and challenge it later.

I don't think that's necessarily

14

correct, Mr. Sellers.

15

could be offered in the district court, before the

16

arbitration, that the fees would be, you know, way, way

17

out of proportion, but it just wasn't done here.

18

Conceivably some, you know, proof

MR. SELLERS:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, what they

19

did offer was information that was taken from the AAA

20

survey.

21

that it was not taken from this case, and I have explained

22

the reason for that, but that is evidence in the record

23

before the district court as to the average costs of

24

arbitration and filing fees.

25

QUESTION:

There was information in the record.

It is true

But that's either fair or not.
39

You

1

said, it will make her go forward on an assumption the

2

costs would be allocated in a fair way.

3

wrong with going forward on an assumption that they'll be

4

allocated in a fair way?

5

that?

6

MR. SELLERS:

Well, what's

How could anybody object to

Because -- because, Justice

7

Breyer, nobody knows what that means, and the -- it would

8

cause her to go for --

9

QUESTION:

10

Well --

MR. SELLERS:

I'm sorry, if I could just finish.

11

It would cause her to go forward in pursuit of a claim of

12

very limited economic value on the possibility at the

13

end -- let's suppose that the fair way in the mind of the

14

arbitrator was to split the costs, regardless of outcome.

15

Each side bears its own -- bears half the cost of the

16

arbitration, and if the arbitration was $5,000, and her

17

share was $2,500, she might very well not go forward under

18

those circumstances.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

Then that wouldn't be very fair,

would it?
MR. SELLERS:

No, I don't think it would be, but

22

that might be in the eye of the arbitrator, the result

23

that is awarded, and we won't know that unless it's

24

determined or ascertainable at the beginning.

25

We don't take the position that the costs have
40

1

to be set forth specifically in the arbitration agreement,

2

but that they be ascertainable, and in fact the American

3

Arbitration Association last year adopted new rules

4

pursuant to a consumer protocol which set forth the

5

provision that a maximum of $125 must be borne by the

6

consumer and the rest would be borne by the company for

7

smaller claims.

8
9

That is a -- had this agreement simply said, we
will follow that kind of rule, or refer to it an outside

10

source of that kind of rule, that would have been fine.

11

But complete silence.

12

there were costs.

13

somebody who went forward with an arbitration would have

14

to bear costs.

15

It was even silent as to whether

There was not even an indication that

She'd have to be -- have to know that, and have

16

confidence that in going forward there would be a

17

reasonable -- there'd be an expectation of an allocation

18

that is fair, whatever that means.

19

We submit that that kind of uncertainty creates

20

a disincentive to go forward and enforce the rights under

21

the Truth-in-Lending Act that this Court in Mitsubishi and

22

in Gilmer made clear is the basis either to decline to

23

enforce the agreement altogether or, as was asked about

24

the Cole decision -- if I may address it for a moment.

25

We understand there's a split in the circuits as
41

1

to whether, under section 4 of the Federal Arbitration

2

Act, there is any authority that the district courts have

3

to insert provisions into an agreement to have it conform

4

with the law as they view it.

5

Whether or not that authority exists, ultimately

6

the outcome ought to be that the district court should

7

tell the parties, I won't permit this to go forward unless

8

you spell out costs or give the party against whom the

9

arbitration agreement is being enforced the opportunity to

10

be assured that they're not going to bear costs beyond

11

those that would be -- they would ordinarily expect if

12

they went forward in court.

13

That is the forum that they chose.

14

judicial and arbitral forums are to be comparable, you

15

can't impose on one party costs well in excess, or create

16

the risk that they would bear those costs --

17
18

QUESTION:

If the -- if

Why can't you just ask the arbitrator

to make that decision at the outset?

19

MR. SELLERS:

20

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy.

Why can't the claimant simply ask the

21

arbitrator to please make the determination at the outset

22

as to what the fees are going to be?

23

fee and you'd say, for your first hour, first half-a-day,

24

tell me what's involved, I might want to get out of here.

25

MR. SELLERS:

You'd have a filing

And of course if the plaintiff did
42

1

that, she -- Ms. Randolph would have already incurred

2

costs going forward --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. SELLERS:

5

I know there'd be a filing fee --- even if she later wanted to

back out.

6

QUESTION:

-- an initial fee, but --

7

MR. SELLERS:

Well, and maybe the costs -- you'd

8

have part of the costs of the arbitrator, and again, I

9

must add, the arbitrator said, as again, people who are

10

busy and expected to arbitrate cases are often called upon

11

to do, I'm going to have to bill you for a day because

12

I've set aside all my other work in order to attend to

13

this arbitration, so if you take 10 minutes or 10 hours,

14

that's the time I'm charging you for.

15

that is a risk that a prudent person I don't think ought

16

to be expected to --

17

QUESTION:

That is a cost --

Well, if the parties agree on

18

arbitration, and the arbitrator has to be fair not only in

19

the decision but in the allocation of costs and expenses,

20

it seems to me that that's for the arbitration.

21

MR. SELLERS:

Well, again, I -- we submit

22

that -- we understand that that determination may and

23

properly should ultimately be made by an arbitration, but

24

costs are really unique, and --

25

QUESTION:

Could you do this in respect to
43

1

costs --

2

MR. SELLERS:

3

QUESTION:

4

I'm sorry.

Could you do the following?

I'm not

sure you can.

5

MR. SELLERS:

6

QUESTION:

Okay.

But I see that Alabama says customer

7

usage is used to interpret the silent contract, and there

8

are a lot of associations like the American Arbitration

9

Association that have gone to enormous trouble to figure

10

out how to structure costs and procedures so as to be fair

11

to consumers or others who don't have the money, and they

12

might be frightened of the costs.

13

MR. SELLERS:

14

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

Well, could you read that customs or

15

usage in Alabama as embodying some such system, or the

16

like, not necessarily the --

17

MR. SELLERS:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. SELLERS:

20

QUESTION:

I understand.

-- arbitration one, but -Right.

-- some such system that would avoid

21

the problem of later unconscionability, and would

22

therefore make the thing valid, and both valid and fair?

23

MR. SELLERS:

Justice Breyer, I certainly think

24

you could do that, but I think the key to it is that it be

25

established at the outset, and not at the end of the
44

1

arbitration.

2

QUESTION:

All right, then couldn't the court in

3

this instance have said, look, we have a silent contract

4

here.

5

they mean customer usage that will make the provision

6

valid if it exists, and here is a body that does that, and

7

so we assume something like that will be.

8
9

Alabama tells us to use customer usage.

MR. SELLERS:

By that,

Yes, I think the district court

had that authority, and could and should have exercised

10

some additional authority in telling the parties at that

11

juncture, before it sent them off to arbitration, I am

12

concerned about the silence on costs.

13

to give effect to this agreement.

14

intention of the parties.

15

the potential imposition of excessive costs.

16

I believe -- I want

I believe that's the

But I am also concerned about

In Alabama there's a customer usage provision,

17

and I want to establish, before I send this off to

18

arbitration, or have a initial conference with the

19

arbitrator to determine at no expense to the parties what

20

cost is going to be assessed, and how it's going to be

21

allocated, and at that point go forward and arbitrate.

22

That would satisfy us.

23

But it's got to be done at the outset, not at

24

the end, because at that point you bear the costs, you're

25

stuck with them, or, as in the case of Ms. Randolph,
45

1

you're so deterred by the possibility of excessive costs

2

that you won't go forward, and that's the prospective

3

waiver of the TILA claims that this Court has expressed

4

concern if it were to arise.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. SELLERS:

7

We don't want that to happen

either.

8
9

So you're saying if --

QUESTION:

Mr. Sellers, that if the Eleventh

Circuit had taken the D.C. Circuit route, that is, not

10

tossed out this arbitration, which would allow your

11

client -- as I understand the posture now, your client can

12

go into court with a Truth-in-Lending Act suit and is

13

freed from the yoke of arbitration, is that correct?

14
15

MR. SELLERS:
understand the question.

16
17

QUESTION:

As I understand the Eleventh Circuit

decision --

18

MR. SELLERS:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. SELLERS:

21

QUESTION:

22

Oh, yes.

-- this contract is no good.
Right.

Therefore, your client can go to

court --

23

MR. SELLERS:

24

QUESTION:

25

I'm sorry, I misunder -- I didn't

Correct.

-- and bring a Truth-in-Lending

Act -46

1

MR. SELLERS:

2

QUESTION:

3

Correct.

-- action, class action and the

works.

4

MR. SELLERS:

5

QUESTION:

Correct.

You have indicated that you would

6

have found acceptable the D.C. Circuit solution, which is

7

the arbitration agreement is preserved, we just read in

8

the provision that we think is necessary to make it

9

enforceable.

10

MR. SELLERS:

That's -- either -- either,

11

Justice Ginsburg, either the D.C. Circuit and Cole's

12

approach is acceptable, or the approach I was suggesting

13

to Justice Breyer, which is that the Court convene the

14

parties, say to them, you have to pencil in this cost

15

rather than the court doing it, and -- because I'm not --

16

I want to enforce this agreement, and I understand you

17

both agree to it, but we need to spell out these costs.

18

So it's either the district court does it as the

19

Cole court endorsed at the outset, or, instead, the

20

parties are directed to do it.

21

outset, before they're compelled to go to arbitration.

22
23

QUESTION:

But it's always at the

Now, did you argue that to the

Eleventh Circuit?

24

MR. SELLERS:

25

QUESTION:

The specific course?

Yes.
47

1

MR. SELLERS:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. SELLERS:

The --

You can answer yes or no, can't you?
No, not in those words, but yes,

4

insofar as we are -- forgive me for -- I feel a need to

5

explain my answer.

6

Yes, insofar as we argued to the Eleventh

7

Circuit that there -- they had an option that was other

8

than simply to invalidate the agreement in its entirety,

9

that the cost had to be established up front.

10

QUESTION:

And no --

11

MR. SELLERS:

No, I didn't present the options

12

in the way I've just presented to the Court today, but I

13

think that it's reasonable to infer that if the district

14

court regarded itself as lacking authority to pencil in

15

anything as the Cole court allowed in the D.C. Circuit.

16

That's clear, and it is also clear that there

17

was issue about the cost presented to the district court,

18

and about their being excessive, and the record was

19

developed.

20

case or not to satisfy the court, I think we may have a

21

difference of opinion, but I think it's fair to say that

22

the issue of costs was raised early, and it was raised

23

several times.

24

was raised to the court of appeals in the same fashion.

25

Whether it was sufficient on the costs in that

It was not a last-minute concern, and it

And if I might add, if I can turn for just a
48

1

moment to the class action issue, which I understand was

2

not decided by the court of appeals, because it apparently

3

didn't feel it needed to reach the issue, but I think at

4

least I want to make clear that much the same kind of

5

approach we advanced here could be taken with respect to

6

the class action issue.

7

Ms. Randolph has taken the position here that,

8

not that class actions under Truth-in-Lending Act are

9

always exempt from arbitration.

Any time a lawyer styles

10

a case as a class action it's exempt from arbitration.

11

That is not the position that we've taken here.

12

The position is likewise, the agreement was

13

silent on class actions.

14

silence meant it's excluded.

15

discussion, even though the district court expressed some

16

sympathy for Ms. Randolph's concerns about aggregating

17

small consumer claims in the absence of that, the parties

18

being left with no recourse, and I submit that once again

19

the district court could have and should have been able to

20

say to the parties, I see also that Ms. Randolph has

21

styled this case as a class action.

22

The district court viewed it as
That's the end of the

I believe that the Truth-in-Lending Act, while

23

the language of the statute itself contemplates class

24

actions, but more importantly, Congress made it clear,

25

echoing the views of the Federal Reserve Board, that there
49

1

was great importance attached to the enforcement of the

2

statute through class actions.

3

And the district judge could have said and

4

should have said, I think that the view -- I don't know

5

whether you intend to include class actions here, although

6

Green Tree had already made its position clear by opposing

7

class certification, that it presumably didn't want it and

8

may very well have hoped that it would never see another

9

class action again and these kinds of boiler plate

10
11

agreements.
But that I'm going to send this to arbitration,

12

but I want you to understand that I regard -- the district

13

court says this, I regard class action to be an option,

14

either left to the arbitrator to determine whether to

15

certify the class, or for the district court itself to

16

determine whether to certify the class, and then, upon

17

review at the end, to satisfy itself that the interests of

18

absent class members have been adequately protected.

19

I think the district court viewed its role in a

20

way that was much too passive for the circumstances of the

21

Federal Arbitration Act, but we do not take the position,

22

and I want to be very clear about it, that we do not take

23

the position that all TILA claims should be exempt from

24

arbitration, or even all TILA class actions should be

25

exempt from arbitration, nor that the district court was
50

1

without recourse to have the parties put in place some

2

assurances about cost, or to actually insert a provision

3

about cost, as the Cole court seems to have contemplated.

4

QUESTION:

Well, why should the district court

5

do that?

6

construe the contract against the drafter, the drafter

7

didn't put it in, so the contract is no good?

8
9
10
11

I mean, if you're right, why not say, we

MR. SELLERS:

Well, certainly Mastrobuono allows

for that possibility, this Court's decision in
Mastrobuono.
We also recognize, however, that there's a

12

strong policy favoring the enforcement of appropriate

13

arbitration agreements, and all we are saying here is that

14

either there has to be, as the Eleventh Circuit did, a

15

conclusion that the agreement is not enforceable, or the

16

district courts could have some discretion to ensure that

17

the parties put in place at the outset, not at the end of

18

the arbitration process, but at the outset, mechanisms to

19

ensure that these kinds of protections --

20

QUESTION:

The class -- I don't -- the class

21

action issue seems harder to get a hold of to me at the

22

moment because it's -- seems like a pure State law issue.

23

They're interpreting the contract, and they simply

24

interpret the contract, perhaps wrongly, so that the class

25

action in this case, in this contract, is not excluded
51

1

from the arbitration.

2

The other questions, of course, are also State

3

law questions, but they basically are questions of State

4

law that are made Federal because of the policy of the

5

arbitration act, contrary to hostility by the State law.

6

MR. SELLERS:

Justice Breyer, it would be --

7

might be State law, but the district court treated --

8

interpreted the question in the context of section 4 of

9

the Federal Arbitration Act.

10

QUESTION:

The class action --

11

MR. SELLERS:

The class action issue.

It never

12

got to the question of whether class certification was

13

warranted under State law.

14

it's silent, therefore I have no discretion to consider

15

it, and then expressed some sympathy for the plaintiff's

16

view that class action might be appropriate here, but I

17

have no authority to interpret this silent -- this

18

agreement that was silent on this as permitting class

19

actions.

20

It stopped at the issue of,

That, I think, is a view of its role, the

21

district court's role that is too passive, given this

22

statute.

Mr. Phillips, you have 4 minutes remaining.

1

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

4

Unless you have further questions on the jurisdictional

5

issue, I'm going to focus on the question of

6

enforceability.

7

It was only at the very tail end of Mr. Sellers'

8

remarks that he identifies the fact that there is a

9

national policy favoring arbitration, and I don't think we

10

should lose sight of the fact that in this context there

11

was a voluntarily entered into arbitration clause that

12

ought to be enforced under these circumstances, and there

13

are no guarantees, when you go down arbitration as opposed

14

to litigation.

15

We are in a situation now where we have

16

litigated this issue in three different jurisdictions and

17

levels of this court.

18

anticipated any of those costs, and certainly no one is in

19

a position to give a guarantee that any process of dispute

20

resolution is going to be cost-free or have cost

21

constraints and, indeed, the plaintiff never asked the

22

district court for any of the specifics that counsel has

23

identified in the context of this particular case.

24
25

I don't think anybody going in

What she said is, plaintiff does not have the
resources to arbitrate, notwithstanding her agreement.
53

1

Therefore, plaintiff's only option is to forego any claims

2

against this company.

3

her position with respect to costs, not some kind of more

4

restrained action, and that's why the district court

5

rejected the notion --

6
7

QUESTION:

What about the notion that she wanted

to have --

8
9

That is the sum and substance of

MR. PHILLIPS:

-- that those costs were

unconscionable.

10

QUESTION:

-- discovery into what the

11

arbitration proceeding would be, and why couldn't one

12

assume that that discovery would inevitably involve issues

13

about the costs of arbitration?

14
15

MR. PHILLIPS:
discovery.

16
17

There's no problem with seeking

The question is, did she -QUESTION:

But I thought that she was told she

couldn't have discovery in the district court.

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

It's not in the record in this

19

case.

20

additional discovery.

21

litigants make every day, and the point is, it's certainly

22

not appropriate for this Court in a case in which the

23

Eleventh Circuit quite clearly handled all of this as a

24

matter of law.

25

She sought some discovery.

She didn't seek

Those are reasonable choices

The Chief Justice is absolutely right.
54

You read

1

17(a) and 18(a) and it says, presume everything adverse to

2

the lender in this case, and only then can you come to the

3

conclusion that this arbitration clause should be

4

enforced.

5

particular case, and that's the judgment that ought to be

6

reversed.

7
8

That's clearly wrong, as an approach to this

The rest of these issues I think legitimately
ought to be considered somewhere down the line.

9

QUESTION:

10

Including whether --

MR. PHILLIPS:

But Cole and reasonableness and

11

unconscionability are questions that need to be resolved

12

in a framework that is fundamentally different from a

13

litigant who throws up her hands and says, I'm not going

14

to participate in this particular process.

15

QUESTION:

But you are asking us to reject the

16

D.C. Circuit solution.

17

Eleventh Circuit that said, no arbitration, you can have

18

your suit in court, the D.C. Circuit said, you must go to

19

arbitration but we're going to relieve the party resisting

20

arbitration, relieve her of the anxiety of thinking she's

21

going to have to pay costs by telling her that's a term of

22

law that we -- not asking the district court to do it, the

23

court of appeals saying we write that into the contract.

24
25

That is, in contrast to the

What is -- you said it was premature.
wrong?
55

Is it

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

It may be wrong, if we have the

2

right facts.

3

that the lender will always pay the fees, regardless of

4

the circumstances in a particular case.

5

I think it is a mistake to say categorically

Now, you know, if the case came up in the right

6

context, I could well imagine the court might adopt a view

7

like that.

8

dissenting opinion in Cole and say, no, it still requires

9

more of a case-by-case analysis in order to properly

I could also imagine it might adopt the

10

balance the interests of both sides, but the clear thing

11

you shouldn't do is reject sending this case to

12
