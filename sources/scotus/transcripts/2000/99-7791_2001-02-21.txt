ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT MA

10
11

MR. STANSELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

I'd first like to start

by emphasizing three

13

points to the Court, first that the Government's

14

interpretation -- the Government s - construction of the

15

statute in this case is extreme.

17

because their country of origin will not take them back.

It allows the INS to

20

power to create categories to deport them, and to deport

22

right to liberty, which they retain until they are

23

deported from this country.

They are simply asserting their Fifth Amendment

in this case, in these cases.

regulatory authority to supervise Mr. Ma and Mr. Zadvydas

3

and those similarly situated.

4

The INS retains a substantial statutory and

In stark contrast to the Government's statutory

5

construction, the circuit court suggested a reasonable

6

construction of this statute that allows for the detention

7

beyond the removal period for a reasonable time period.

8

This interpretation, this construction is consistent with

9

the silence of the statute, which, as explained by the

10

circuit court, invites the question of what time period

11

are we talking about.

12

period of "indefinitely", that word to be read into the

13

statute.

14
15

QUESTION:

The Government would seek a time

We're talking about the language,

"may be detained beyond the removal period"?

16

MR. STANSELL:

That's correct, Your Honor, and

17

what Congress has not done is specify how long beyond

18

the -- how long, following that, Mr. Chief Justice, they

19

would intend to detain.

20

QUESTION:

Well, do you think that some

21

reasonable period of time is permitted under that

22

language?

23

MR. STANSELL:

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

I think

24

the Court's -- or the circuit court's construction is

25

entirely consistent with the historical treatment.

the Ninth?
MR. STANSELL:

I'm sorry, I'm talking about the

Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

7

specifically to the Ninth Circuit's decision dealing

8

purely with the statutory construction issue and putting a

9

reasonable construction on the statute that avoids the

constitutional issue.
QUESTION:

What about the construction that the

12

INS has put on it?

I'm referring

Isn't that entitled to some deference

MR. STANSELL:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the

15

Chevron deference simply doesn't apply when you're

16

applying the constitutional avoidance doctrine, because I

17

believe that agencies are not -- while they may have

18

expertise at interpreting their own statute, they don't

19

necessarily have expertise in interpreting the

20

Constitution, and even most recently this past term this

21

Court in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County did

22

not grant Chevron deference when there was a

23

constitutional problem indicated.

3

that is reasonable is the time that is necessary to

protect the public from depredations by these people, who

5

are deportable because they've committed crimes.

I guess the Government here would say that they're

Well, Your Honor, the circuit

7

court did not specifically define what is a reasonable

8

time period.

11

I think our position would be --

QUESTION:

You mean an absolute time limit at

some point, don't you?
MR. STANSELL:

Your Honor, our position would be

12

if it's not reasonably perceivable, if deportation is not

13

perceivable, there's not some objective fact that they can

14

point to that this individual is going to be deported,

15

then holding that person beyond that period would not be a

16

reasonable time.

17

QUESTION:

So even if you're talking about, you

18

know, a real life Hannibal what's-his-name, you know, a

19

really wicked, evil person who is going to harm people,

20

there's every reason to believe that this person who's

21

been deported because of serial murders, if you can't find

22

a country to send him to, you have to let that person out?

23

That's correct, Your Honor, and

appropriate term here, any other person who has finished

QUESTION:

Well, any other person is entitled to

be in the United States.

Would it be unconstitutional for

the law on its face, when aliens are admitted, to say that

5

you are admitted to this country only on the condition of

6

good behavior, and that that permission will be terminated

7

if you commit a felony, and upon its termination, it is up

8

to you to find a country to get sent back to.

going to be allowed into the public in this country, where

11

you have not been given any permission to be?

unreasonable?

MR. STANSELL:

Why is that

Well, Your Honor, the first part

14

of your hypothetical I think is essentially what the law

15

is.

QUESTION:

I know.

I'm just spelling it out

more explicitly, that the condition of your admission is

QUESTION:

Your Honor, I --

And we will send you back to whatever

country you can find that will take you, but if no country

24

will take you, you will not be allowed into the general

populace. That permission has not been given, period.

MR. STANSELL:

Your Honor, I think because the

Constitution has the paramount -- is the paramount

authority under which all statutes have to be gauged, I

QUESTION:

Everyone retains the right to liberty

Well, the Government says here that

Mr. Kestutis is in the same position as someone, as an

10

entering alien, who we've said has virtually no

11

constitutional rights.

12
13

MR. STANSELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, the -- I think

you're referring to the Mezei decision and --

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

15

MR. STANSELL:

-- the Mezei decision is a unique

16

and very distinguishable case on its facts.

17

an individual coming to the border, seeking entry, not

18

bringing any constitutional rights, and it involved an

19

individual who was also ordered excluded on public safety

20

or national security grounds, and it also came at a time

21

prior to the Court's development of its jurisprudence on

22

some sort of due process in the civil detention scheme.

QUESTION:

We've never questioned it so far as I

know.
MR. STANSELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, that's

4

entirely correct, but what's important is that on the

5

other hand Mezei never questioned the general rule that it

6

was setting out the narrow delineated exception for --

7

QUESTION:

Well --

8

MR. STANSELL:

-- and that general rule is that

9

once an alien has passed through our gates, and it is more

10

or less a direct quote, has passed through our gates, even

11

illegally, they're entitled to the protections of the

12

Fifth Amendment.

13

QUESTION:

You're saying, then, that even though

14

an alien obtains admission to this country illegally, that

15

he's fully protected by our Constitution?

16

MR. STANSELL:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. STANSELL:

Yes, I am, Your Honor.

Well, but protected in what sense?
Well, Mr. Chief Justice, he's

21

QUESTION:

Yes, but will you -- answer my

question, if you will.
MR. STANSELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, I think, you

7

know, I perhaps misspoke, that, of course, the Government

8

has countervailing interests that they can detain any

9

individual for a number of reasons.

It's been recognized

10

by this Court that detention pending deportation

11

proceedings is one of those circumstances, and this

12

Court's decision in Carlson supports that.

13

What this Court has never done is taken this a

14

step further and essentially condoned what could be

15

lifetime detention for individuals who have in hand their

16

full Fifth Amendment protections, and I would want to

17

emphasize that Mr. Ma and Mr. Zadvydas today are

18

substantially constrained.

not the same currently.

QUESTION:

They're both out in the world.

They're both out, aren't they, and

MR. STANSELL:

That's exactly correct.

And is there some opportunity for

judicial review after a period of time under the proposed

What if the punishment for the felony were life in prison?

2

That, I assume, would not be unconstitutional?

3

MR. STANSELL:

4

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Then why is it unconstitutional to

5

say to an immigrant, if you commit a felony, we're not

6

going to put you in prison for life, but we are simply not

7

going to let you back into the general populace, and we

8

will deport you if you can find a place to be deported to,

9

but otherwise you will be held under house arrest, not

10

punitive, but you will not be allowed into the general

11

population?

12

Why is that lesser punishment, if you consider

13

it that, although it really isn't punishment, it's -- you

14

know, that was the deal.

15

unconstitutional, whereas sending the felon to jail for

16

life and punitive treatment for life would not be

17

unconstitutional?

18

MR. STANSELL:

Why is that lesser sanction

Well, Your Honor, it -- the

19

hypothetical you lay out would allow somebody through the

20

administrative action of an administrative agency to be

21

put in -- to be incarcerated for life, and this Court has

22

never condoned such an extreme civil detention process.

QUESTION:

hypothetical, then, slightly and say that there is a

fact can be terminated upon deportation, if deportation is

United States?

8

MR. STANSELL:

Well, you know, I think it raises

9

a number of different issues, but what's at the heart of

10

this is the fact that Mr. Ma and Mr. Zadvydas, when they

11

entered the country, they were cloaked with the

12

Constitution, and this Court has delineated a very narrow

13

exception in Mezei, an exception that recognized the

14

general rule set out in Wong Wing in 1896 that has

15

stood -- that withstood, has withstood this test of time

16

and has been cited by this Court in modern cases.

17

That general rule remains, and all they are

18

asking for in this case, and the substantive due process

19

claim here, is simply to ask INS to take into

20

consideration the fundamental aspect that is really

21

driving these cases, the fact that people are locked up

22

for life.

balanced that against the other interests, then it would

MR. STANSELL:

Your Honor, I'm not sure.

It

2

strikes me that that raises other issues that aren't

3

raised in this case, and all we are saying in this case is

4

that where no consideration is given to the foreseeability

5

of deportation, and it's not a criminal charge and a

6

criminal sentence that any of these people are serving,

7

it's unconstitutional, and that's what's informing --

QUESTION:

Would you say there's something --

that it might be something different, is that a little bit

10

like Plyler, that you would take one category of people

11

who commit the same offense and subject them to much

12

harsher punishment than another class?

13

MR. STANSELL:

I think that might be.

I think

14

there might be an equal protection issue that's raised,

15

and quite frankly I hadn't thought about that question.

16

QUESTION:

Well the -- but the Government's -- I

17

mean, if it comes to justification, the Government's

18

justification is going to be essentially what we have

19

heard here, and that is that it is demonstrably more

20

difficult to keep track of such individuals so that they

21

may be deported if, in fact, it is possible to deport

22

them, and number 2, the recidivism rate by such

23

individuals is distinctly higher than the recidivism rate

24

in the generally released criminal population, so those

25

would be the two justifications for the disparate

Would those justifications be constitutionally
adequate?
MR. STANSELL:

I don't think so, Your Honor, and

5

I think that the surveys that the Government relies upon

6

had a much broader sweep to them.

7

individuals that we've represented, who are in custody by

8

INS, seeming like they're in custody for life, and they

9

get a district court order to release, are doing quite

10

well, by and large, because they think that their next

11

mishap will put them in custody for life.

I don't think these

There's no indication that Mr. Zadvydas or Mr.

Four-and-a-half decades ago Mr. Zadvydas came to

this country as a stateless person.

rest of his life.

He's stateless today,

QUESTION:

Because of this, the Government was

Are there no ongoing negotiations --

7

I got the impression from the briefs that there had been

8

efforts both to Lithuania and some other country, and

9

neither of them had presently admitted him, but that it

10

was not regarded as completely hopeless.

11

MR. BARNARD:

Your Honor, as a factual matter,

12

the only thing that has happened in the last 2 years that

13

I know of is that Mr. Zadvydas wrote a letter to the

14

consulate in Chicago seeking some citizenship papers, or

15

granting him citizenship, and other than that nothing has

16

happened in the last 2 years.

17

At issue in this case, the constitutional issue

18

in this case, is that people who enter this country are

19

regarded as persons under the Constitution once they

20

enter.

21

that rule is a very narrow exception which is called the

22

entry fiction, which is applied to people who are detained

23

or interdicted at the border, and what the Government is

24

proposing here is to have the exception swallow the rule.

25

That is the rule that pertains.

country can be found to send them to.

10

I don't think they are.

I think they're

The Government acknowledges all of that, and

11

under Mezei you wouldn't have to let these people out at

12

all, even if you knew that they wouldn't flee, and even if

13

you knew that they might possibly pose a threat to the

public, isn't that right?

MR. BARNARD:

So they're not going as far as

extending Mezei to these people entirely.
MR. BARNARD:

Well, I think they are, but as far

19

as the constitutional deprivation that's being imposed

20

here, they're confining people indefinitely, potentially

21

for life, based on a finding of dangerousness and/or a

finding of a flight risk, and --

to return, and this Court did not see a need to extend

MR. BARNARD:

She was in the process of

committing a crime when she entered the country, Your

3

Honor.

4
5

QUESTION:

Well, but your clients have committed

independent felonies.

6

MR. BARNARD:

Yes, and I would get back to the

7

point I made a moment ago, which is that they're being

8

treated differently than any other class of persons under

9

the Constitution in this country.

We're now not according

10

them the same degree of constitutional rights we would

11

some else.

12

QUESTION:

Well, but I don't think the

13

Constitution requires you to treat people who have done

14

particular things the same way as people who have not done

15

those things.

16

MR. BARNARD:

But what we're saying, Your Honor,

17

is, if you take another person in this country who has a

18

felony conviction, and he's determined to be dangerous,

19

but only dangerous and not some other element, not the

20

other element that we find in Kansas v. Hendricks, a

21

mental abnormality, simply dangerous like the individual

22

in Foucha, that person would be entitled to release.

23

QUESTION:

But that person is not an alien, and

24

the Government has much more power over aliens than it

25

does over citizens.

1

MR. BARNARD:

Which is another reason, perhaps,

2

that release would be more called for in this instance,

3

because the Court -- the Government is not without

4

recourse with aliens if they violate their terms of

5

supervision.

6

We're not asking for Mr. Ma and Mr. Zadvydas to

7

have the same freedom that a citizen would have.

They

8

would be under supervision. If they violated the terms of

9

that supervision they could be punished for up to 1 year

10

for failing to abide by the terms of the supervision, and

11

they could be punished up to 10 years if that misbehavior

12

was seen as obstructing the actual deportation process.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Can they be detained, under your

view, for a reasonable time after the 90-day period?
MR. BARNARD:

Yes, Your Honor.

I believe the

16

test, the civil and regulatory detention test had a

17

weighing analysis built into them.

18

QUESTION:

All right.

In determining the

19

reasonableness of the more lengthy detention period, do we

20

take into account the fact that there are review

21

procedures, and that the Government under its regulations

22

has to give periodic review?

MR. BARNARD:

into the consideration.

12

MR. BARNARD:

I understand that, Your Honor,

is that the way the regulation is constructed, it violates

a basic -- the basic right to substantive due process.

Either they can't detain him for any

circumstances of each case.

3

If someone had a shoplifting conviction and they

4

were detained for 90 days, or 120 days, and it wasn't

5

reasonably foreseeable they'd be deported, perhaps that

6

would be a reasonable period to release them, but if

7

someone had a more serious conviction, I believe a

8

district court could hold them somewhat longer.

9

But if you're asking for a time period, I would

10

suggest that the traditional time periods when the statute

11

was silent -- the 1970 statute, it was 2 to 4 months, the

12

statute in the fifties was 6 months -- and that would be a

13

guidepost, but at some point you could not detain them

14

beyond that, because the person is being held merely based

15

on the fact that he's dangerous, and he's being treated in

a manner that is different than any other person in this

country.

how dangerous they are in any other setting.

12

the only legitimate consideration is, does the Government

find a place to accept this person.

Therefore,

Once it's clear that that's not in the cards,

the description of at least one of the two here, I would

not be very much inclined to say, oh yes, he is a German

citizen, send him back.

4

Now, I might be inclined to do that if I knew

5

that the poor devil is not going to be allowed into the

6

general population, that his choice is to be kept in

detention in the United States. You're loading the dice

against anybody being willing to take back bad actors.

Why should they do it?

The consequence of not taking them

back is, they'll just be released in the general public in

and the two examples would be Wong Wing and Witkovich.

3

There were other countries involved in those cases, and

not only did this Court reach the constitutional issue,

but resolved it in the alien's favor.

So if there were some attenuated foreign policy

interest there, I would say that this Court in previous

cases has not allowed that --

QUESTION:

I also assume that one of the things

10

that induces these foreign countries to take them back is

11

lobbying and pressure from the individual himself and from

his family, and they have a great incentive to do that if

the consequence of Germany's not taking him back is that

QUESTION:

May I ask, just as a matter of

clarification, if this -- if your client were a German

citizen, would Germany have the option to take him or let

him stay here, or would they not be obligated to take him?

I think under the reduction

convention they do not have to take him back, but I'm --

QUESTION:

So really the question whether

he gets back or not depends on whether he's a citizen of
the country that they want to deport him to.

12

Yes.

MR. BARNARD:

If he's stateless, which my client

is, there's a special --

QUESTION:

They can define him to be a citizen

14

or not to be a citizen.

15

made by the authorities in Germany.

16

MR. BARNARD:

I mean, that's a judgment to be

Well, if they find him not to be a

17

citizen, if they find him to be stateless they don't have

18

to take him back.

19

QUESTION:

Well, you're not assuming that the

20

Germans just do this willy nilly, and they don't have

21

rules that decide whether these people are citizens or

22

not.

MR. BARNARD:

That's correct.

If he is with a country with whom we

Government at this point is somewhat less than sanguine

that he's going to be taken anywhere, because the only

RESPONDENTS IN NO. 99-7791 AND

10
11

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Congress in the exercise of its plenary

12

authority over immigration enacted section 1231(a)(6) in

13

196 -- 1996 to afford the Attorney General the authority

14

to detain dangerous criminal aliens beyond the 90-day

15

removal period if they cannot be removed to their

16

countries of nationality or to some other country during

17

that 90-day period.

18

That enactment was the culmination of measures

19

beginning in 1988 by which Congress sought to address what

20

had become the serious problem of criminal aliens within

21

the United States.

22

information in 1996 in particular, about both the high

23

rate of recidivism among criminal aliens as well as the

24

very high rate of flight among aliens who are released.

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- on that point?

Does your case,

4

your submission depend on an assumption that these people

5

are more dangerous than citizens who have committed

6

precisely the same crime?

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

It does not, no, but what I --

8

the important element, though, is that future

9

dangerousness is a legitimate basis on which to detain

10

someone.

Under this Court's civil commitment cases, and

11

this does not remotely resemble civil commitment because

12

it's an exercise of Congress' plenary power over

13

immigration, but one of the bases on which someone may be

14

civilly committed is their potential dangerousness.

15

the Court --

16

QUESTION:

That is not a --

There's always a plus.

Not mental abnormality, not a short

respect, and I think this is a critical factor to

2

understanding this case.

3

Hendricks, for example, is that in the civil commitment

4

cases the Court has said it's dangerousness plus some

5

other factor, such as mental illness.

6

What the Court said in

Here we have a critical other factor, in

7

addition to dangerousness, and that is that both Mr. Ma

8

and Mr. Zadvydas in this case had had their right to

9

remain in this country extinguished.

10

QUESTION:

That's the question.

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

12

QUESTION:

Pardon me?

That's the question.

We agree it's a

13

civil statute.

14

cases would you say that there is a factor involved of not

15

knowing whether you could find a country for them?

16

How many days after the 90 in these two

MR. KNEEDLER:

In our submission the detention

17

of the aliens is reasonably related to the basis for

18

detention, as long as there is a basis for concern about

19

threat to the community and removal.

20

QUESTION:

No, no, I'm just trying to figure

21

out, though -- I'm trying to figure out what the issue is

in this case, and I'm having some trouble, because I want

to know -- to separate out the problem that you're just

talking about, risk of crime --

it that we're supposed to be deciding?

MR. KNEEDLER:

QUESTION:

Because at that moment, if it's not

question of whether it would be reasonable to maintain

them simply to be sure they're around if you find a

the potential for dangerousness to the community.

The Attorney General has

General had broader authority to detain someone

might conceivably be returned in the future.

that nothing has been done with respect to him recently,

2

we point out at page 48, footnote 22 of our brief, facts

3

have happened after the letter that he referred to that

4

Mr. Zadvydas wrote to the Lithuanian consulate.

5

As we point out in that brief, the INS twice

6

last summer called Mr. Zadvydas in for an appointment,

7

after he asked that that appointment be postponed, so it

8

could be explained to him what information the INS had

9

obtained from the Lithuanian consulate as to what

10

information would be necessary to apply to Lithuania for

11

citizenship based on the Lithuanian citizenship of his

12

parents.

13

On both instances, he did not show up for the

14

appointment, so he is not cooperating with the known

15

procedures for submission of documents that Lithuania has

identified as germane to the question of whether he would

be granted citizenship.

QUESTION:

That would be separately

3

Now, having said that, under the regulations

that I've described, even before the formal regulations

5

went in place in December, up to 50 percent of the people

6

who were reviewed under the interim procedures that were

7

in place were released during that period of time, so

8

these regulations do afford a periodic opportunity --

9

QUESTION:

How many of those 50 percent had

10

previously been determined to be dangerous to the

11

community?

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

I'm not -- well, all of them, or

13

almost all of them in the sense that they were convicted

14

of a crime.

15

have a criminal history, maybe a few who do not, but the

16

two aliens before the Court right now were convicted of a

17

crime in which they had all of the procedures to which

18

they were entitled in determining that, and this Court has

19

said --

QUESTION:

And they had served their sentences,

presumably.
MR. KNEEDLER:

They have, but as this Court

continuing dangerousness from the conviction of a crime,

But didn't that involve more aliens

MR. KNEEDLER:

But it is our submission that

once an alien has been ordered removed from the country,

11

as both of the aliens here have been -- not only have they

12

had a criminal conviction, with all the protection that

13

affords, but they have -- are subject to final orders of

14

removal under an administrative process in which that had

be proven by clear and convincing evidence.

16
17
18

The procedures are unquestioned in this case.
The consequence of the final order of removal -QUESTION:

But Mr. Kneedler, isn't there a vast

19

difference between saying, if a person -- partly

20

fictional -- has never been in the country at all, he has

21

never acquired the protection of the Constitution, isn't

22

that quite different from saying that a person who has

23

acquired that protection, simply because an order of

24

deportation has been entered, he totally loses the

25

protection?

Isn't there a difference between the two?

MR. KNEEDLER:

There's not, and if I may explain

2

why, there is no difference from the point of view of the

3

status or the interests of the alien, there is no

4

difference with respect to the sovereign powers of the

5

QUESTION:

Well, there's a big difference in

7

being, say, in Seattle, Washington, and Ellis Island,

8

never being able to get off the island.

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

I'm speaking of the legal status

10

of the alien, and the third is with respect to the

11

interests of the United States.

12

With respect to the status of the alien, it's

13

important to consider the consequences of a final order of

14

removal.

15

terminates the person's status as a lawful, permanent

resident.

It is not simply an order of removal.

QUESTION:

It also

Well, may I go back to that question

18

Mr. Kneedler, because there's an issue that's come up.

19

think it's inherent in Justice Stevens' question, and I

20

think it was raised by your response to Justice Ginsburg's

21

Hendricks question, and I think it's focused by one of the

22

green briefs, amicus briefs filed by, I think it was a

23

group of law professors, and they said, what's wrong with

has not yet been admitted is this: The status, the

2

constitutional status of the individual who has never been

3

admitted rests upon a patent fiction, and the patent

4

fiction is that the individual is not in the United

5

States, when we all know that the individual is in the

6

United States.

7

and the Fourteenth Amendment does not distinguish between

8

citizens and others in this respect.

9

Illegally, yes, but in the United States,

It may very well be that that legal fiction is a

10

very justifiable fiction, because otherwise the United

11

States is defenseless against Mariel boat lifts and things

12

like that, but it's another thing, as Justice Stevens'

13

question suggests, to extend that legal fiction and say

14

that the legal fiction takes you one step more, and that

15

is, we're going to now assume that an entire further class

16

of individuals, in fact, is not in the United States and

17

is not subject to whatever the territorial claim that the

18

Fourteenth Amendment seems to respect.

19

What is your answer to the problem of extending

20

legal fictions, because, what's in back of my mind is, in

21

the back of my mind is, if legal fictions can support this

22

restriction back on whatever the rights of persons are,

23

then I suppose other legal fictions could accomplish the

24

same purpose for other classes, so what is your response

to the problem of legal fictions?

just to finish the -- because this is important to

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right,

but then the further

consequence is, under 1182(a)(9) of the act, the alien is

Well, that may very -- I don't doubt

that that is true so far as legal definitions are

concerned, but that doesn't drive the constitutional

we'll accept the legal fiction that the person who has

important thing about -- the important thing to consider

19

if you look at someone like Mezei, who was here for 25

years, and went abroad for I think 19 months before he

21

came back in, the Court said that he was an arriving

22

alien, even though he had a long time in this country, but

the important point is that Mezei was about procedure, and

to the alien.

Even Justice Jackson in his dissent in Mezei

rejected the notion that there was a substantive due

7

QUESTION:

Well, whether there is or is not a

8

substantive due process problem, it seems to be the case

9

that you still want to respond to the substantive due

10

process argument by saying that the people who have been

admitted ordered deported are exactly in the same status

12

for constitutional purposes as those who have never been

admitted.

MR. KNEEDLER:

And here --

If one is a fiction, the second is a

greater one.

MR. KNEEDLER:

No -- and the other part of

Mezei, that was the part of Mezei that depended on the

19

entry fiction, but the other part of Mezei is, he had no

20

liberty interest to be at large in the United States, and

our point is that that liberty interest to be at large in

the United States was extinguished by the final order of

You're saying legal status here is the same because the

Mr. Kneedler, I don't follow this at

all, frankly, because I thought the so-called entry

we're going to let you set foot on land and not drown in

the sea or starve to death, but we're going to treat you

as though you never came in, and that's a fiction, but

they are persons, and the Constitution says, nor shall any

7

QUESTION:

We're not dumping them in the sea,

are we?
MR. KNEEDLER:

That was exactly the point I was

8

going to make.

One could make the same point here with

9

respect to the removal of an alien who was previously

10

here, and whose right to remain here has been

11

extinguished.

12

The United States would not do this, but one way

13

to remove the alien from the United States would be to put

14

him on a boat, or to insist that he find a county and,

15

unless he finds a country he will be detained here.

16

QUESTION:

I take it what we're arguing about

17

now, or discussing, is whether the Attorney General has

18

the right to put this person in custody for his entire

19

life solely on the basis of risk, and I'm not sure that

20

this case really raises that, but if it does, so be it,

21

and my question to you would be simply this.

22

Is there any precedent at all, where the

liberty without due process of law, justifies putting a

2

order, no judge, no jury, no judicial process?

3

I just can't think of an instance, and I would

4

be surprised if other countries with similar systems do

5

such a thing, depriving a person of his liberty forever,

6

on the basis simply of an administrative order, so what is

7

the precedent?

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

There's not a precedent, put

9

this -- put that way, but if I may respond, the basis for

10

the removal order in this case were criminal convictions,

11

in which the aliens' criminal trials --

QUESTION:

I have no doubt you could do that as

a criminal punishment.

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

QUESTION:

17

But --

Is that what we're talking about?

That's a judicial process.
MR. KNEEDLER:

No, but you said where the basis

18

for the detention is not preceded by any criminal trial.

19

Here, there was a criminal trial.

20

QUESTION:

No, no, my problem is the problem

21

that judicial due process, normally means judicial process

22

where you are depriving a person of liberty.

23

it's very hard to think of instances -- well, I'd be

with you.

My problem is that that's not what's at issue
here --

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

Well --

-- to my understanding.
Well, with all respect, the

criminal conviction in this case, in both of these cases

10

and in the great majority of cases in which people are

11

being detained, plays a critical role in their continued

12

detention.

13

This was something that the Court found to be a

14

permissible factor in both Foucha and in -- and

15

particularly in Jones, where the Court said that there

16

could be a presumption of continuing dangerousness subject

17

to rebuttal by the individual, which is exactly what we

18

have here.

19

QUESTION:

Yes, but we're trying to explore what

20

precedent of this Court comes closest to saying that,

21

based on the prior conviction of someone who was lawfully

22

here at the time of that conviction, can the Government,

23

by administrative order, detain the person indefinitely

24

because of dangerousness.

Other than Mezei.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

Several.

The first is Fong Yue

Pardon me?
Fong, F-o-n-g, Yue, I think it

12

is, Y-u-e, Ting, T-i-n-g, which says that Congress' power

13

over -- power to expel aliens, in other words to deport

14

them, is the same and is as absolute as Congress' power to

15

exclude aliens, and we've set out the relevant quote in

16

our brief in the Zadvydas case, which I believe is at

17

pages 37 and 38.

18

So I think that is an important constitutional

19

basis for the point I was making earlier, that once

20

someone's right to remain here is extinguished, and he's

21

put back in that status, it is proper to equate them to

Mezei.

presumption coming out of a criminal conviction of

continuing dangerousness.

Yes, but were any of those

presumptions operative on purely administrative

determinations?

I would have thought not.

MR. KNEEDLER:

I mean, that's

No, but it seems to me another

important point that the Court has said with respect to

10

aliens, and this, I can't remember the case in particular,

11

but the Court has said on a number of occasions that

12

Congress can commit the determination of immigration

13

matters to the executive branch, and have determinations

14

made --

QUESTION:

These cases involve deportation.

think my question was precedent in respect to putting

person in prison --

MR. KNEEDLER:

QUESTION:

Well, I --

-- and Fong Yue Ting, if I'm right,

20

was a case where the Court was considering a law that said

you had to have a credible, white witness for a Chinese

person to remain in the United States, is that right?

QUESTION:

And there's no provision for judicial

We do not challenge the right of an alien who is held

subject to the Attorney General's authority under the

statute to seek habeas corpus challenging the

constitutionality of the detention, so if there is an

argument --

Once you lose it here, there isn't -- in other

no -- if you are successful today, in any one of these

situations, be it a shoplifter, be it someone who

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think you are correct the alien

7

It is no part of our submission that an alien

who is illegally present, or who has been paroled into the

United States in a case like Mezei, is not a person for

10

purposes of protection independent of the immigration

laws, but it's quite a different matter to say that the

Due Process Clause was somehow intended to limit Congress'

plenary power to protect the United States, and the safety

of the United States.

One other point that I'd like to make, because

16

it's important to bear in mind, protecting the safety of

I see your point about a dictator who

MR. KNEEDLER:

It goes beyond the excludable

QUESTION:

I'm just thinking in terms of your

with one voice to a dictator and saying, we're not going

MR. KNEEDLER:

Speaking

Well, it's we don't want them any

more, and it is your responsibility to take him back, and

10

the pressures on that other country, not simply from the

11

United States Government but from the alien himself, from

12

human rights groups, from his family, are much greater for

13

that other country to take him back when he's in

That's certainly true.

The Attorney General -- first of

discretion of the Attorney General.

16

As we point out in our brief, the Attorney

17

General in issuing the final regulations in December

pointed out that INS had commissioned a study of other

methods for supervision of aliens who might safely be

released to see if there's some middle ground, half-way

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

I thought under

give the Attorney General the authority to insist that the

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, what are the conditions

of the releases of the two litigants in this case now?

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

I'm not sure of all of them, but

5

there are periodic reporting requirements and not leaving

6

the jurisdiction.

7

QUESTION:

Is there any reason why those very

8

conditions that are in place now would not be adequate as

9

a general rule, subject to severe punishment if they were

10
11

violated?
MR. KNEEDLER:

What the Attorney General has

12

concluded is, for people who do not pose a threat to the

13

community -- reporting requirements are not going to stop

14

someone from being a threat to the community.

15

guard against flight, but they are a far more inadequate

16

protection against danger to the community.

17

QUESTION:

They may

But insofar as you rely on threat to

18

the community, it's the same threat for the citizen who

19

had the same criminal history.

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, but the important -- the

21

balance of interest is completely different with respect

22

to a citizen and an alien who not only --

QUESTION:

Why is the balance different if

1

example, the Court said that an individual's interest in

2

liberty can be outweighed by important governmental

3

interests.

4

There is a compelling interest in protecting the

5

safety of the community, but where the liberty interest

6

that is going to be --

7

9

QUESTION:

But you conceded earlier it's no

stronger than it is for the average citizen.
MR. KNEEDLER:

But the countervailing liberty

10

interest is far, far less, to the extent the alien has any

11

remaining liberty interest, because his right to be at

12

large in the United States has been extinguished.

13

QUESTION:

But in Salerno and in Hendricks and

in these other situations where people are being held and

1

but the -- again, coming back to the central issue in this

2

case, all that is at issue here is whether the Attorney

3

General's detention pursuant to expressed statutory

4

authority is reasonably related to the goals that have

5

been advanced, and as long as the person was found by the

6

Attorney General to be dangerous or a flight risk, the

7

detention is reasonably related, and that detention is

8

subject to periodic, automatic review by the Attorney

9

General every year, and in intervening periods the alien

10

can request a review of his status by presenting changed

11

material circumstances.

12

In that situation, we think that is a very

13

reasonable response on behalf of the two political

14

branches about how to deal with the severe problem of

15

dangerous criminal aliens in our midst.

16

It is an inherent part of the sovereignty of

17

every nation to protect itself against aliens who that

18

nation does not believe should be in its presence for

19

purposes of national sovereignty, national security, but

20

also the safety of the populace of that country, and that

21

is what Congress and the Attorney General are responding

22

to.

23

Safety is not simply a question to be addressed

24

by the States.

When it comes to aliens in this country,

25

it is Congress' responsibility, not that of the States, or

1

in addition to that of the States, to protect the populace

2

of the United States against the presence of dangerous

3

criminal aliens in the United States, and that is what has

4

been done here on the basis of a criminal prosecution and

5

administrative procedures that unquestionably satisfied

6

due process, and the only remaining -- in terms of giving

7

Congress an interest with respect to aliens, it is the

8

equivalent of a State's interest with respect to the

9

mentally ill.

10

In that situation, it is directly parallel to

11

the interests of a State.

12

intervene with respect to the liberty interest of an

13

individual?

14

the context of mental illness which gives the State a

15

right to come in and look after the individual and protect

the individual and the State.

When does a State come in and

With respect to civil commitment, it is in

With respect to aliens, it

That has been satisfied.

That has been

20

remains, then, is the question of dangerousness, and, as

21

this Court has held in the civil commitment cases, a State

22

may place on the alien the burden of showing that he is no

23

longer dangerous at the end of a particular period.

MR. STANSELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

I have just four points I would like to make.

12

The first is that the administrative process in this case.

13

What 's fundamentally wrong about it, it takes absolutely

14

no consideration that deportation is not foreseeable.

15

it did, and if the agency weighed foreseeability with

16

actual and real evidence of dangerousness and flight risk,

17

we would have no quarrel with the agency applying that

18

constitutional test in reviewing these individuals.

If

19

Secondly, as I just said, the test in any case

20

has to be, is detention excessive in relationship to the

21

legitimate Government's interest, and we feel like the

22

district court in Mr. Ma's case had the proper test,

23

balancing foreseeability of deportation with

24

dangerousness, real evidence of dangerousness and flight

25

risk.

We would draw the line at, is deportation

foreseeable, and say on balance everyone would get out on

this case.

broader balancing test where actual foreseeability might

be a gradiated scale and allow for different balances to

applied.
