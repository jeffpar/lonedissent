ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The Controlled Substances Act prohibits the

12

distribution of marijuana outside federally authorized

13

research programs because Congress, the Attorney General

14

and the Secretary of Health and Human Services have each

15

determined that there is no currently accepted medical use

16

for the drug, and it has a high potential for abuse.

17

The statute also recognizes that new information

18

might come to light that would justify less restrictive

19

controls so it establishes administrative procedure for

20

changing the classification and the restrictions for

21

marijuana and other controlled substances.

22

That statutory scheme leaves no room for the

23

Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative to distribute

24

marijuana without the approval of the Attorney General

25

under a claim of medical necessity, and it leaves no room

1

for a court to consider such a claim as a basis for

2

refusing to enjoin the marijuana operations of the

3

cooperative.

4

The Ninth Circuit's ruling in effect authorizes

5

the operation of marijuana pharmacies outside the

6

safeguards and restrictions of the Act and undermines the

7

ability of the Act to protect the public from hazardous

8

drugs.

9

The common law defense of necessity can

10

sometimes authorize a person to violate the law in order

11

to avoid a more serious harm but it doesn't apply here for

12

three reasons.

13

balanced the harms and come to a different conclusion.

14

First, because the legislature has already

Congress anticipated there would be claims of

15

medical uses for controlled substances and provided an

16

administrative procedure for evaluating them allowing

17

trial judges and juries to redetermine that balance in

18

individual cases would undermine the procedure established

19

by Congress.

20

Second, because the defense has no application

21

because the co-ops members and the co-op itself have

22

alternatives to violating the criminal law.

23

substantive alternatives, other lawful medications

24

including a synthetic form of the active ingredient of

25

marijuana.

They have

QUESTION:

May I ask one question on that

2

subject Ms. Underwood?

3

footnote 11, that describes some of the situations there

4

that gives the impression that this whole case is a sham,

5

that it's really just a front for using marijuana and I'm

6

wondering if -- and your argument you're just making now

7

suggests there are always alternatives.

8

should take the case on the assumption that there really

9

are some people for whom this is a medical necessity or

10

You have a footnote in your brief,

Do you think we

should we assume that there are no such people.

11

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

The -- on the assumption

12

that there are no such people because the Food and Drug

13

Administration charged with evaluating the medical -- the

14

scientific information and the DEA, that is the agency

15

that report to the Attorney General and the Secretary of

16

Health and Human Services having evaluated the claims of

17

medical use have found that there is no accepted medical

18

use, that some of the claims of medical use are simply

19

wrong.

20

QUESTION:

General Underwood, may I just stop

21

you there because take one of the examples that was in the

22

brief, the one about the man who was constantly vomiting

23

and the only thing that calmed him down, he had a lymphoma

24

or something like that, that is not an uncommon experience

25

and what surprised me about this case was that that kind

of thing has been going on, individual doctor prescribing

2

marijuana just to prevent that kind of extreme suffering,

3

and that seemed to have gone without enforcement until

4

California passes this proposition and you get clinics

5

selling it, not individual doctor.

6

that there has been quite a bit of this going on in the

7

medical profession.

8
9

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

Am I wrong in thinking

The record doesn't reflect

and I don't know how much of it has been going on.

I

10

think there are two things to say in response to that

11

though, one is that the agencies charged with evaluating

12

the medical uses here have ongoing studies and have so far

13

concluded that there are -- that the particular use that

14

you're describing is best served -- there's now an extract

15

of marijuana that's been on the market -- been available

16

and been put on the lower schedule than schedule one for

17

15 or 16 years which is this Marinol and efforts are being

18

made to find other methods of administering the pure

19

substance and determining whether it has the effect that's

20

described.

21

QUESTION:

Ms. Underwood, these judgments made

22

by the federal agencies, the FDA and the DEA, I think they

23

take into account the overall public interest, I mean,

24

they -- I'm not sure that they have come to the conclusion

25

that marijuana would never ever, ever be helpful to

someone who's in extreme pain.

2

probably done is made the judgment that the chances of its

3

being that helpful and not being replaceable by something

4

else are so slim that in view of the abuses to which

5

general permission for its use would lead it's best that

6

it be proscribed, is that an inaccurate determination on

7

my part?

8

determination by the federal government that marijuana is

9

never medically useful.

10

I think what they've

Could you really say that there has been a

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

Well the determination

11

that's been made is that the medical utility of it has not

12

been established which is a slightly different way of

13

putting it but there is a separate determination the FDA

14

makes determinations as it does with substances that

15

aren't on the controlled substances list, that is there

16

are new drugs that are proposed all the time which might

17

possibly be useful and aren't authorized for use until

18

after tests satisfy the FDA that the drug is safe and

19

effective for use and marijuana has not passed that

20

screen.

21

There is an additional screen for controlled

22

substances that is in addition to considering and the

23

scheduling decision takes into account not just medical

24

utility but also the potential for abuse, but the FDA's

25

role in it, the Health and Human Services role in it is

just to assess or it has a role in simply assessing the

2

medical evidence and has concluded that to date there is

3

insufficient reason to think that it is a safe and

effective drug although there are continuing research

5

projects going on to try and pursue the anecdotal

6

information that it is sometimes helpful or that

7

components of marijuana are sometimes helpful.

QUESTION:

Ms. Underwood, it would help me,

General Underwood, if you would tell me why the word

10

preemption doesn't appear in the government's brief

11

because I took the simple-minded approach looking at this,

12

Congress says this is a schedule one drug and California

13

says you can have it if you've got a note from a doctor

14

that says you have a migraine headache.

15

federal law that says this is the schedule one drug

16

preemptive, it must have been with some thought that you

17

didn't use that word.

18

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

Why isn't the

Well the California law

19

doesn't actually purport to authorize the distribution of

20

marijuana with a doctor's note, it provides a defense to

21

California law.

22

made here to invoke the judgment behind that law as in

23

support of the claim of medical necessity, but California

24

didn't purport to create a defense to federal law as it

25

couldn't have if it had tried it would have been

Now it is true that an effort is being

presumably preemptive -- preempted.

2

possible to comply with both California law and federal

3

law. There isn't that kind of conflict here.

QUESTION:

But it's perfectly

Explain that to me because I thought

to comply with federal law you can't sell it.

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

Well that's right but

California law doesn't require you to sell it.

says that you won't be -- California could remove the --

could eliminate --

the feds and we won't go after you.

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

That's correct. That's

13

correct.

14

federal agencies not to accept the kind of anecdotal

15

evidence that you're suggesting is a decision that the

16

federal -- the Food and Drug Administration has made again

17

not just in the controlled substance area but it has

18

concluded that the anecdotal reports of individuals are a

19

basis for research, a reason to conduct research and not a

20

basis for authorizing the use of a drug or changing its

21

scheduling.

22

And I should say that the decision of the

QUESTION:

General Underwood, there's some

23

indication in the trial court's observation, he had no

24

choice but to enter this injunction, that's something of

25

an over-reading, but suppose I were the district judge and

I said, you know, General Underwood, you want me to

2

basically supervise what's going to be a major effort to

3

prosecute people and you're doing this under my contempt

power, I don't want the court to get involved in this, you

have your own United States and assistant United States

6

attorneys, you have investigate these, bring these as

7

prosecutions and then we'll hear these cases and if

8

there's a necessity defense or something we can rule on

9

it, but you're basically asking me to issue an injunction

10

and in order to enforce it I'm going to have to make

11

prosecutorial decisions, I don't want to be bothered with

12

that because I think it intrudes upon a separation of

13

powers balance, it's making me more of a prosecutor than a

neutral judge.

15

discretion.

16

If he said that would he be abusing his

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

Yes.

There are grounds on

17

which a court can deny injunctive relief. For example, if

18

the court found that violations had stopped and are

19

unlikely to recur and an injunction wasn't necessary to

20

effectuate the purposes of the act, this Court noted that

21

in Hecht against Bowles, and there may be other grounds

22

but I would say that the judge who said what you just said

23

would be, in fact, intruding on Article II executive

24

prerogatives by insisting that when Congress has provided

25

both civil and criminal enforcement mechanisms as it often

does that the executive is not free to choose the

enforcement mechanism, the civil enforcement mechanism

that --

QUESTION:

May I ask this question, does the

executive, the district attorney have prosecutorial

6

discretion not to bring a case if he thinks a particular

7

defendant really is a person that has this serious illness

8

and so forth.

10

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

There's always prosecutorial

discretion.

11

QUESTION:

12

discretion than a prosecutor?

13

Why would a judge have less

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

The judge has different

14

discretion from a prosecutor, it is for the prosecutor to

15

decide whether a case merits prosecution or whether a

16

civil injunction is worth bringing.

17

QUESTION:

If the judge reacts to precisely the

18

same reasons that motivate a prosecutor not to bring a

19

case, would that be an abuse of discretion?

20

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

Yes it would.

The court's

21

role in the process is not the executive's role.

22

court cannot deny an injunction on the grounds that the

23

executive should for instance have chosen the criminal

24

sanction or should not have brought the case at all.

QUESTION:

Suppose the judge has legitimate

2

concerns that given the resources of the court that it's

3

going to make him basically substitute for the United

4

States attorney in the Northern District of California,

5

he's going to have to decide who to prosecute for contempt

6

and it's going to be criminal contempt and so forth,

7

basically it seems to me that he's now being put in the

8

role of the supervising prosecutor just in order to

9

enforce his injunction.

10

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

Well no the contempt actions

11

of him would be brought by prosecutor and I'd like to

12

point out why civil --

13

QUESTION:

I'm sure that he has or should have a

14

major say in how he's going to enforce his injunction, who

15

he's going to bring to court for the contempt action in

16

the first instance, what kind of examples he's going to

17

make, et cetera.

18

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

There's a reason why civil

19

injunctive enforcement is authorized and why it's

20

appropriate.

21

second-guess the prosecutor but there is a reason. The

22

civil injunctive remedy in this statute was patterned on a

23

similar provision in the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and

24

the purpose of that was to provide a way to resolve legal

25

disputes without the harshness of a criminal prosecution.

I don't think it's for the court to

1

This is just that kind of dispute, open and ongoing

2

violations of the law designed to test its statute with

3

the California state law in the background, once --

4

there's no reason to think that once a court resolves the

5

question that -- holds, for instance, that there is no

6

medical necessity defense or holds that in any event

7

whatever medical necessity defense there might be doesn't

8

authorize the operations of marijuana pharmacies as in

9

this case, that the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative

10
11

won't comply with the law.
QUESTION:

Well, maybe it will, but isn't the

12

real concern, and I want to state a variant on Justice

13

Kennedy's question, isn't the real concern behind this

14

that with the passage of the California proposition and

15

the popularity within the California population that that

16

necessarily entails, it will be very, very difficult for

17

the government ever to get a criminal conviction in a jury

18

trial, and the reason, it seems to me, that the reason I

19

assumed this was being brought was to avoid hung juries in

20

criminal cases.

21

If the trial court in fact were to conclude that

22

that is the reason and that's why the injunctive remedy

23

was being invoked, would that be a good reason for the

24

court to say it is not certainly a necessary and maybe not

25

an appropriate use of equity to give the government an

2

contempt in order, in effect, to make a criminal statute

It would not be an appropriate ground for

15

out that the statute, this statute, perhaps out of a

concern like that or perhaps for some other reason,

contains a jury trial requirement -- provides a jury trial

QUESTION:

Do we know whether this United States

attorney brought this as a civil -- as a civil matter

it is.

consequences.

this Act is enforced by a criminal prosecution rather than

enforcement practice with respect to the CSA.

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

I know that civil

5

injunctions have been used on other -- exactly on

6

occasions under this statute as well as under other

7

statutes where there is a business enterprise going on

8

that has a dispute with the government about whether what

they're doing is outside the statute.

11

I don't think it's

-QUESTION:

Romero-Barcelo was a civil injunction

12

in connection with the EPA, wasn't it?

13

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

That's correct but -- and

14

under this statute in particular though the Controlled

15

Substances Act it is not customary to seek injunctions

16

against street dealers of narcotics but it is customary to

17

seek injunctions against, for instance, manufacturing

18

plants that are claiming that their use of particular

19

chemicals is -- what they're doing is within the Act or

20

without the Act, I mean, when there is essentially a

21

dispute with the business enterprise about the legality

22

and propriety of what they're doing and that is actually

23

not just under the Controlled Substances Act but under

24

many statutes, the kind of occasion when an injunction is

once that legal dispute is resolved it will not be

necessary to seek further enforcement but there will be --

3

QUESTION:

Of course you can make the same

4

argument for bringing criminal prosecution, so presumably

5

you put somebody in jail, they'll stop doing it too.

6

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

Yes, but what Congress said

7

actually in authorizing injunctive relief is that when

8

there is this kind of dispute it is desirable to provide a

9

mechanism for resolving it without putting people at risk

10

of going to jail if -- and that's one --

history I presume, it doesn't say that in the statute,

Your view here that violation of law is

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

That's our view but there is

a claim to the contrary and I don't think it requires that

7

we credit that claim to decide that an appropriate way to

8

resolve that dispute is in a civil enforcement action, and

9

that -- so that's the story about when we sometimes use

10

civil enforcement actions.

Actually very often --

12

because there aren't reported opinions, the most common

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

It isn't necessary to reach

reason the injunction -- the reason the Ninth Circuit was

wrong to suggest that the injunction might not issue or

might be limited that the court predicated that holding on

a court might exercise its discretion but it is not a good

reason to exercise its discretion to rely on a mistake of

General Underwood, if you take it as

Underwood's answer was they get a jury trial in any case.
MR. UELMEN:

It's a jury trial in accordance

No fine was imposed.
What was requested when you went to

6

as punishment we're going to ask for a fine as punishment,

did the government make any specification of that sort?

MR. UELMEN:

No, the government asked that the

sheriff or the marshal seize the premises in which the

business was being operated and of course the Respondents

11

were at risk of incarceration if they remained in

contempt.

QUESTION:

Well, that's just like a civil

nuisance action, it's just a nuisance action in the

federal court is all it amounts to.

MR. UELMEN:

the Respondents wished to assert were never determined by

QUESTION:

But presumably if it did it itself,

3

it must have thought that it qualified for schedule one

under those criteria, it just didn't want to leave it up

6

MR. UELMEN:

All it had to conclude in terms of

7

a rational basis test was that it wanted to impose the

8

most restrictive limitation and that is schedule one, no

9

use without a prescription, but we're saying even that

10

finding, that there's no use without a prescription, is

11

not a rejection that under limited circumstances where a

patient is facing imminent harm and has no reasonable

alternative, the drug cannot be used without a

prescription, it's a classic illustration of the

QUESTION:

Okay, so it's not just a requirement

of a prescription that Congress is prescribing.

4

MR. UELMEN:

Well, by putting it on schedule one

5

they're saying you can't -- you can't use it by

6

prescription, now when a doctor issues a prescription all

7

he's concluding is that this will help you, he's not

8

required to conclude that you have no other alternative.

9

He's not required to conclude you have a serious condition

10

and you may die or go blind if you don't have this

11

medicine, all he's got to say is, this will help you,

12

here's a prescription, go get it and take it.

But the

13

medical-necessity defense requires much more.

It requires

14

a conclusion that the patient is facing a serious medical

15

crisis.

2

MR. UELMEN:

3

QUESTION:

Yes, it is.
What you have here is a statute that

4

Congress enacted that quite arguably simply ruled out the

5

sort of defense that you're urging.

6

MR. UELMEN:

Well, Congress certainly didn't

7

explicitly rule it out.

8

that we can imply this limitation from the structure of

9

the Act and from its purpose, but a careful --

11
12

QUESTION:

What the government is arguing is

Or from its placement on schedule

one.
MR. UELMEN:

Well, its placement on schedule one

13

involves this issue of currently accepted medical use

14

which is a term of art that does not address the question

15

of whether under particular circumstances of an individual

16

patient facing a medical crisis there might be medical

17

utility for the drug.

18

QUESTION:

Do I understand you correctly Mr.

19

Uelmen from what you've argued about medical necessity,

20

the California initiative is essentially irrelevant

21

because you'd be making the same argument in any state; is

22

that correct.

23

MR. UELMEN:

That is absolutely correct. This

defense should be available to any patient in any state

3

QUESTION:

I guess would it be limited to

4

cannabis or would you have a similar exception to any of

5

the prohibitions.

6

MR. UELMEN:

Well, if the conditions are met

7

that you face this imminent crisis and no other

8

alternative is available, yes, it should be available for

9

other medications as well.

10

QUESTION:

It would be up to the individual who

11

wants it to take his chances and say I think there's

12

medical necessity and then try and prove that later --

13

MR. UELMEN:

That's a risky venture because that

14

individual is going to have to prove in a court of law

15

that in fact he had -- he was facing this crisis and he

16

had no alternative.

17

QUESTION:

Well, you know if he really thinks

18

he's going to die that's an easy gamble right, a jury

19

versus the grim reaper, I'll take the jury any day.

20

MR. UELMEN:

Well, at least in the confines of

21

the modification of this injunction we're talking about

22

more than that, we're talking about a requirement that you

23

prove that you have tried all of the other alternatives

24

that might be available and they didn't help.

MR. UELMEN:

QUESTION:

Well, it may be better.
Which led me to question that the

whole use of the injunctive power to begin with but so

4

long as we have the injunction, the statutory authority,

5

it seems to me you have to wait for a specific case to

raise this defense.

7

MR. UELMEN:

Well, that's our position Justice

8

Kennedy that the availability of the medical-necessity

9

defense should await a criminal prosecution in which the

10

defense is asserted and evidence is presented and --

11

QUESTION:

Well, but in the meantime it seems to

12

me that nuisance can be enjoined and if the defendant

13

wants to take his chances on a criminal contempt he can do

14

so.

15

MR. UELMEN:

Well, our contention is that you

16

can decide this Court just based on the traditional

17

discretion that a court of equity has to allow this

18

exception to the injunction.

19

QUESTION:

I think it was pointed out earlier

20

that the district court here whose discretion it is

21

originally granted the injunction just what the government

22

asked for, and it was the court of appeals who does not

have discretion which directed the district court to

exercise it in a different way.

2

the court was asked to modify the junction.

3

QUESTION:

And what should we do if we decide

4

that the court of appeals misconceived the law?

5

what should we do with this case?

6

MR. UELMEN:

I mean,

Well, if you feel that the court of

7

appeals misconceived the law then of course you're going

8

to have to reverse the court of appeals, but our position

9

is the court of appeals was essentially correct on both

10

grounds, that the court does have discretion to decline to

11

enjoin and these -- this conduct doesn't violate the

12

statute because it comes within this medical necessity

13

defense.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Uelmen, let me talk about the

15

medical, I had understood medical-necessity defense, if it

16

existed, to be a defense on the part of the person who is

17

in medical necessity and who uses marijuana or any other

prohibited drug when he shouldn't.

19

this also to the person who provides it to any persons who

was in such needs.

2

MR. UELMEN:

3

QUESTION:

Well it's perfectly -I've heard of necessity defense on

the part of defendant who used it or whatnot, but you're

saying by reason of a necessity defense you can open up a

6

business to provide for these necessities.

7

MR. UELMEN:

If it's perfectly consistent with

8

the choice of evils concept of the necessity defense

9

because the person who provides the substance to the

10

patient is also faced with a choice of evils. The case of

11

United States versus Newcomb which we cite in our brief on

It's another thing to say that

Well the government's position

5

actually is that there is no necessity defense for any

7

very important that the court realize that the reason

8

we're here is because the government shut down the only

9

program that could accommodate these patients.

For many

10

years they provided Cannabis and still do for eight

11

patients who come within this medical necessity criteria,

12

and they closed that program down in 1992 and they say in

their brief we can do it because we're the Federal

You can't do it because you're a private

Well, we're saying if you won't do it, we can do

it because the only justification you have to do it is the

same necessity defense that we're asserting and the way

the necessity defense works is if a patient comes in and

says I have to have this to live and the court says well,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

A medical necessity defense

13

is foreclosed here not only by the fact that Congress

14

contemplated and rejected it and not only by the fact that

15

alternatives are available but also because any necessity

16

defense is a response to unusual and unforeseen

17

circumstances.

18

necessity defense couldn't possibly authorize an ongoing

19

enterprise designed to stand ready and provide supplies to

20

people who might show up with their own individual claims

21

of medical necessity.

22

It couldn't possibly, the common law

There's no constitutional problem with the

Respondents in this case have never presented

their claims, the claims they're making here, to the FDA.

They've never sought review of the classification of

at least so far as the record reflects, to the clinical

trials that are ongoing right now to deal with synthetic

manufacture of components of marijuana, and on the remedy

for contempt at the petition appendix at 25 A and again at
