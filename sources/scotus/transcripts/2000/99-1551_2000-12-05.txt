ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL GOTTESMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This is a business tort action based entirely on

12

State law, filed in the Maryland State court.

13

was filed within Maryland's time limits, but the Maryland

14

courts believed that they could not entertain the suit

15

because it was barred by operation of Rule 41(b) of the

16

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

17

believed, because a Federal district court in California

18

had dismissed an earlier assertion of the claim on the

19

ground that it was untimely under the California statute

20

of limitations and it declared that dismissal to be on the

21

merits.

22

The suit

It was barred, they

Now, that earlier California case had been filed

23

by the plaintiffs in State court and, of course, we now

24

know it was untimely.

court and had been dismissed as untimely by the State

If the case had remained in State

1

court, it is absolutely clear that under California law it

2

would not have precluded the suit in Maryland, and that's

3

because the California supreme court has stated repeatedly

4

that dismissals based on the statute of limitations do not

5

extinguish the substantive right.

6

concerned --

7

QUESTION:

So far as California is

Would it have been -- would the

8

California judgment have been binding on Maryland if the

9

same issues were involved, i.e., the statute of

10

limitations are about the same, and the question was when

11

the tolling period -- whether there was a tolling period

12

or something like that, and the California court had ruled

13

on the merits in the sense of -- on the issue, on the

14

issue of whether or not there was tolling?

15

MR. GOTTESMAN:

16

QUESTION:

Well --

Then I take it Maryland, a) would

17

have and b) perhaps must give credit to the earlier

18

judgment?

19

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, certainly if it -- if

20

Maryland was borrowing the California statute of

21

limitations it would certainly have to give credit, but

22

even if it was relying --

23

QUESTION:

No, suppose the statutes were exactly

24

parallel, and the issues were exactly parallel, but a

25

disputed issue of fact as to whether or not there had been

1

tolling?

2

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, I think if it was a

3

disputed issue of fact it would probably be collaterally

4

estopped.

5

Maryland might have a different definition of what

6

constitutes fraud, in which case the finding of fact in

7

California would not necessarily dispose of the comparable

8

question under the Maryland statute of limitations.

9

was a close question here about exactly how much knowledge

10
11

There would be issue preclusion.

But of course

There

do you have to have to be compelled to file.
QUESTION:

So there is some instance in which

12

California's judgment has extraterritorial effect.

13

all I was trying to say.

14

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Yes.

That's

It might have

15

issue-preclusive effect, but what the California supreme

16

court has been very clear about is that so far as your

17

right to assert the underlying -- you still possess your

18

underlying tort rights, this being a tort suit, even

19

though we have dismissed this suit on the basis of the

20

statute of limitations.

21

QUESTION:

If it's an ordinary statute of

22

limitations; but suppose it was what was once called a

23

built-in statute of limitations, a proscription period

24

that bars not merely the remedy, but the very right.

25

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, surely, if California had

1

a statute and it was construed to mean that it bars the

2

right, then yes, that would preclude you going to another

3

State.

4

California is clear that its general statutes of

5

limitations do not have that effect.

We would agree with that, Your Honor.

But here,

6

Now, as a result, when the defendant removed the

7

California case to the Federal court and immediately moved

8

to dismiss, so it's clear that it understood at the time

9

it was removing, we're going to move to dismiss this case

10

based on the statute of limitations, but by moving it from

11

the State court to the Federal court and getting the exact

12

same ruling, a ruling on California law, because, of

13

course, the Federal court was obliged to apply the State's

14

statute of limitations, by getting that ruling in a

15

Federal court, it is now claimed, and the Maryland courts

16

accepted the claim, that the rights which California's

17

statute of limitations preserve had been extinguished

18

because the statute of limitations was applied by the

19

Federal court.

20

QUESTION:

Well, isn't the position of your

21

opponents here, Mr. Gottesman, that there is a Federal

22

rule as to res judicata issue preclusion?

23

with the idea that there is a Federal rule, or just

24

disagree with their version of the Federal rule?

25

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Do you disagree

Well, that's -- as this Court

has said in the O'Melveny & Myers case, it's -- you know,

2

it -- there's a little riddle attached to that.

3

mean, if Erie, for example, is a Federal rule, if

4

Dupasseur is a Federal rule, then yes, we would agree that

5

it is a Federal rule, but the Federal rule is that the

6

State's determination controls, so in some sense, clearly

7

it is a Federal rule, because this Court decides what law

8

applies.

9

QUESTION:

We -- I

Your opponents also argue, I think

10

with some merit, that Dupasseur has been superseded by the

11

Rules of Civil Procedure.

12

MR. GOTTESMAN:

What's your position on that?
Well, absolutely, that we regard

13

as the critical -- for us, the critical threshold question

14

is, we must persuade you that Rule 41(b) is not a rule of

15

preclusion, or that if it is, it violates the Rules

16

Enabling Act, because it is substantive, and so let me

17

turn to that.

18

should be not understood to be a rule of preclusion.

Rule 41(b) we submit for five reasons

19

QUESTION:

May I ask you, before you --

20

QUESTION:

Before you say that, do you mean

21

issue preclusion or claims preclusion, or does that make a

22

difference?

23

MR. GOTTESMAN:

24

QUESTION:

25

Well, it doesn't --

I mean, can we say that it is a rule

of issue preclusion and you still prevail?

1

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, I mean yes, we would

2

prevail if you said that in this case, but I don't think

3

that that's -- analytically it's not our position that it

4

is a rule of preclusion, but only issue preclusion.

5

QUESTION:

We --

It isn't termed as a rule of issue

6

preclusion, because Rule 41(b) says that unless it's a

7

jurisdictional thing it counts as a dismissal on the

8

merits, even though nothing may have been adjudicated, so

9

it may be that 41(b) would be applicable despite the

10

absence of any specific issue of adjudication.

11

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, that's correct, Your

12

Honor, surely, but I understand the question to be, what

13

if an issue was adjudicated, would the party be barred

14

from relitigating that issue.

15

may well be barred, but it's not 41(b) that causes the

16

bar.

or State law, issue preclusion rules generally are --

I think the answer is, they

1

advisory committee notes, and states repeatedly, the

2

Federal rules do not state rules of preclusion and it

3

would be improper if they attempted to do so, because such

4

rules are substantive.

5

The third is this Court's decisions since the

6

Federal rules were enacted.

Now, this Court has not had a

7

preclusion case involving a State law diversity action

8

since the rules were enacted, but it's had a number of

9

Federal question cases, and so it's had an opportunity to

10

discuss what are the sources of the preclusion rule that

11

the Court applies in Federal question cases and it has

12

never suggested that the source is Rule 41(b).

13

Quite the contrary, the Court has repeatedly

14

said these rules of preclusion are judge-made and the

15

decisions of this Court that we have the power to

16

determine when exceptions to the general rule are

17

appropriate, et cetera, so that it's clear that this court

18

does not understand Rule 41(b) to be directing the answer

19

to rule preclusion questions.

20

The fourth, and I hope I have time to explain

21

this, is that the rule would be incongruous and in some

22

respects implausible in operation if it were a rule

23

preclusion law, and the fifth is that it would violate the

24

Rules Enabling Act and would undermine important questions

25

of sensitivity to State interests, these being things that

1

would cause the Court, when in doubt, to interpret it as

2

not being a rule of preclusion.

3

Let me start with the text, because the argument

4

on the other side is principally that the words of 41(b)

5

are a rule of preclusion.

11

QUESTION:

So what happens if we have a

12

litigated case, a litigated diversity case in the Federal

13

court and a judgment is entered, and then a question

14

arises as to the preclusive effect of that judgment, any

15

of the many different issues surrounding res judicata?

16

it established, or is -- are those matters adjudicated --

17

are they determined as a matter of State law or Federal

18

law?

19

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, if they were State matters

20

that were adjudicated we would suggest it would be State

There is -QUESTION:

4

Does that second Federal judge look to the

Well, we believe that the judge

looks to State law.

It may be a Federal rule that is

21

Right.

So I was just looking for a precedent

MR. GOTTESMAN:

I don't know of a case like

that, and part of -- one of the reasons is that in all 50

23

States if you had a case litigated on the true merits to a

judgment, everybody would regard that as claim-preclusive,

so the issue would never arise.

it's split on that, that there's a split in the circuits.

MR. GOTTESMAN:

In the circuits, just as there

is a split on this.

QUESTION:

9

when we decide this, I guess.

10

Well, then we're really deciding that

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, the first step is to

11

decide whether Rule 41(b) is the controlling answer.

12

it's not, you then have to decide, well, if it's not, what

13

is, and I -- that's the second part of our argument, and

14

our argument for what is, is that Dupasseur or Erie, we

15

think they are both actually grounded in exactly the same

principles.

QUESTION:

If

Mr. Gottesman, at least 41(b) would

govern if you tried to bring the very same case back in

far, that this would operate as an adjudication on the

merits, it would be preclusive of any further claim?

the very same tort claim were reinstituted it would at

least be preclusive of bringing it back to the very same

2

it's on the merits, and California would regard that as --

QUESTION:

All right.

41(b) says

Then let's switch to the

8

would it look to the district court in California and copy

9

what that court would do?

10

Two

Would the district court in Maryland be

MR. GOTTESMAN:

We think it doesn't matter

11

whether the second suit is filed in the State court or a

12

Federal court, that either way preclusion is determined by

13

the law of the place where the original judgment was

14

rendered, because it's there that a ruling or judgment

15

gets its preclusive effect, and whatever court is

16

receiving that, or is considering that in a second case,

17

must refer back to the first case to determine that.

18

So as we understand what the right answer should

19

be, it would not matter whether the second case is in a

20

State court or a Federal court.

21

happened in that first court preclusive of the suit that's

22

being filed in the second court, and we have to answer

that by looking to the law that appropriately applies to

masse, or doesn't it depend upon what the dismissal was

2

for?

3

not on statute of limitations grounds, this removed case,

4

this diversity case, but because the plaintiff was

5

recalcitrant and wouldn't comply with discovery requests,

6

and the district judge gives lots of warnings and he said

7

finally, plaintiff, I'm dismissing your case as a sanction

8

under Rule 37 for your recalcitrance.

9

Suppose, for example, the Federal case was dismissed

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, we think in that case the

10

dismissal is not for a reason of State law.

11

that Your Honor is describing, the dismissal is for

12

behavior in front of a Federal court, a matter which the

13

Federal court polices as a matter of Federal law.

14

that's what causes the dismissal, then we would agree that

15

there is certainly at least a strong argument and maybe a

16

compelling argument that a Federal rule of preclusion

17

would apply to that, but the Federal rule of preclusion

18

still would not be 41(b).

would be something independent of that.

it is under State law it is the State preclusion rule that

would apply.

No, where that's likely to come up, I

The principle is that if this is

But it wouldn't be -Once you move -- and that's our

case.

Once you move me away from that and start

introducing Federal elements that induce the dismissal,

the case becomes more complicated.

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, isn't that example that

that isn't going to go very -- won't be very effective if

the recalcitrant litigant or the frivolous litigant can

advisory committee to the rules, not in the case of Rule

Are they then precluded -- if they lose, if the class

11

loses, are they precluded from bringing their own lawsuit

12

in another court?

13

When Rule 23(b)(3) and (c) were drafted the

14

advisory committee said, we cannot state in the rules that

15

your failure to opt out means you are bound because we are

16

not allowed, by the Rules Enabling Act, to declare what

17

the res judicata effect of that is, so all we say in the

18

rules is, if you don't opt out of the class you will be,

20

those who determine what the preclusion rules are to

determine what that means, and we think they're likely to

say that that means that they are preclusive, but that's

not for us to say.

3

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Yes.

What does answer the

We think, Your Honor, that

the question is then answered by either Dupasseur and that

line of cases which, if Rule 41(b) did not overturn that,

6

which is what our first position is, then that is still

7

the law of this Court.

8
9

Now, of course, one more thing has intervened
since Dupasseur, and that is this Court's decision in

10

Erie, and this Court's decision in Erie would

11

independently suggest that if this is, quote, substantive

12

in the sense that Erie makes the distinction, that State

13

law would control, and it would be difficult to find

14

anything that was more substantive than this in the two

15

senses, the twin aims of Erie.

16

First of all, California law says that the fact

17

that you filed untimely here does not extinguish your

18

substantive right.

19

somebody who will hear it.

20

the Federal court is -- if it invokes a rule that would

21

say, ah, but your right is not alive if it was issued by a

22

Federal court you're getting exactly the opposite outcome

23

on whether there exists a tort right, depending on --

question, you're barred under State law by the statute of

2

limitations, but the right isn't extinguished?

3

have they ever applied that to allow a plaintiff to

4

prevail?

5

MR. GOTTESMAN:

I mean,

Yes, they have, Your Honor.

6

There are three different ways that rule plays out in

7

California.

8

-- if you -- for example, if you are dismissed because

9

your complaint did not state a claim, because you failed,

Two of them are within California.

You can

10

for example, to allege one of the elements, even on that

11

very claim you can file it again in a California court if

12

you can, you know, write a complaint that does state a

13

claim.

14

Secondly, even if you are foreclosed from

15

pursuing that claim in California, you can take the same

16

set of facts and say, well, we first alleged it as a tort.

17

That was untimely, but those same facts actually add up to

18

a breach of contract, and California will allow you to

19

refile and pursue the claim as a contract claim.

20

But thirdly, the California court has expressly

21

said, and this is the Western Coal case, which is cited in

22

our brief at page 48, that even if you are precluded from

23

coming back to the courts in California you are free to go

24

to a sister State if they are willing to hear the claim.

25

Now, Your Honor's question is why?

QUESTION:

Okay.

Well, then I will --

Mr. Gottesman, I would have thought

7

that the rule, Rule 41, does appear expressly to cover

If it doesn't,

Hannah.

11

MR. GOTTESMAN:

12

QUESTION:

Right.

And Hannah seems to say that a

13

Federal diversity court should apply a Federal rule of

14

civil procedure to the case before it whenever the rule

15

covers the point in dispute and isn't unlawful under the

16

Rules Enabling Act or the Constitution.

17

So you would then have to persuade us that the

Rules Enabling Act makes this rule unlawful, as applied in

argument I'd prefer to leave to the briefs.
Yes, that is why Rule 41(b) has to be the

threshold point.

Now, the reason -- in explaining why it

does -- it is not itself a rule of preclusion, even the

QUESTION:

What about Justice -I'm sorry.

I just don't want you to lose, before

11

you sit down, Justice O'Connor's argument that she just

12

asked about, why would it be a violation of Erie?

13

is, another way of looking at this is, what you've all

described, you've described what California does that

isn't a judgment on the merits, so the district court here

used the wrong word.

MR. GOTTESMAN:

nature of the case.

QUESTION:

Mr. Gottesman, let me pursue one more

12

thing that I think bears on what I'm interested in and

13

perhaps what Justice Breyer's asking about.

14

After the Federal district court in California

15

proposed to enter the order it did, did your client then

16

ask for an amendment of that judgment or explain the

17

problem, or ask the court, look, here's the problem, we

18

want to go to Maryland, would you clarify this and make

19

sure that we're not bound or prevented from going to

20

Maryland?

21

It seemed to me that your client had the first

22

opportunity to do that and perhaps just bypassed it, and

23

so there's no inequity here if you're bound.

24
25

MR. GOTTESMAN:
opportunity.

Well, surely they had the

prevailed or not on that, and if they -- if Rule 41(b) is

2

a rule of preclusion their failure to avail themselves of

that opportunity obviously will be fatal, but if we're

right that it is not a rule of preclusion, then their

failure is irrelevant.

QUESTION:

Yes, but that -- isn't that a pretty

tough argument, because the text of the rule says,

operates as an adjudication on the merits --

MR. GOTTESMAN:

QUESTION:

-- which sounds like issue-preclusion

language, and I guess that -- which leads to my question.

10

MR. GOTTESMAN:

11

QUESTION:

Claim preclusion.

Is -- yeah.

Assuming that we accept

12

your position, what function does the phrase, operates as

13

adjudication on the merits, perform in a case like this?

14

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, first of all it is there

15

because it informs whatever the rule preclusion rule is.

16

When 41(b) was adopted there were two preclusion rules

17

announced by this Court, one for Federal question cases,

18

one for State cases.

if it was, quote, on the merits it is precluded unless we

20

find an exception.

The Federal question rule was that

21

22

determine what the rule preclusion is, so obviously 41(b)

plays an important role.

preclusion rule says that on the merits dictates claim

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER E. DELLINGER, III

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9
10

MR. DELLINGER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

Mr. Gottesman has described what seems to be an

12

utterly unworkable system in which we have a State court

13

that is in the process of recognizing an earlier Federal

14

judgment begin the process of deciding what the Federal

15

district court should have done.

16

Rule 41 serves an extremely important function

17

in the structure of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

18

It reflects an understanding by the Advisory Committee on

19

the Federal Rules that it is very important to determine

20

at the time a Federal civil action is dismissed whether

21

that judgment of dismissal brings an end to litigation

22

arising between those parties and their privities on the

23

same set of facts.

24

everyone knows whether this is an adjudication on the

25

merits.

It gives you that answer so that

It is not, as Mr. Gottesman suggests at some

point, a complete rule of preclusion.

2

QUESTION:

But the question is, on the merits of

3

what?

You want to say, on the merits of the suit, and the

4

rule doesn't say that.

5

presented to the court, and this sounds to me like issue

6

preclusion.

It's on the merits of what was

7

Now, it may be that if you're dismissed on the

8

merits for failing to comply with the rules of the court

9

there's a strong Federal policy there, but here there's no

10
11

Federal policy.
MR. DELLINGER:

With all due respect, Justice

12

Kennedy, two responses.

13

can be read to be merely issue-preclusive rather than

14

precluding the claim and, secondly, even if it were so

15

read, it would lead to very unpalatable consequences on

16

the first question.

17

One, I do not think that Rule 41

This Court, I think, has passed this point in

18

Plout, where you specifically held that Congress violated

19

Article III of the Constitution when it tried to reopen

20

and revive Federal cases that had been adjudicated and

21

determined to be found outside the statute of limitations

22

and Congress tried to retroactively extend the statute of

23

limitations, and the parties seeking to defend the act of

24

Congress said, well, that's just statute of limitations,

25

and this Court says in Plout that -26

1

QUESTION:

But that was because they were trying

2

to reopen the judgment on the same grounds that the

3

judgment was granted.

4

MR. DELLINGER:

I understand that, and I will

5

come to that point.

6

there is -- there's clear -- that what the Court does in

7

Plout is to analogize a statute-of-limitations dismissal

8

to a failure to prove substantive liability and a failure

9

to prosecute.

10

I just wanted to make it clear that

That is a judgment on the merits.

The Court said, to be precise, the rules of

11

finality treat a dismissal on statute-of-limitation

12

grounds the same way they treat a dismissal for failure to

13

state a claim, for failure to prove substantive liability,

14

or for failure to prosecute, as a judgment on the merits,

15

citing for that proposition Federal Rule of Civil

16

Procedure 41(b).

17

parcel of why it violated Article III.

18

That wasn't dicta.

QUESTION:

That was part and
41(b) stands --

Mr. Dellinger, I don't think your

19

colleague contests that.

20

when it says, on the merits, does preclude another Federal

21

court, and any State court, where the question is a

22

Federal question and, therefore, where it is up to the

23

Federal Government to say what an on-the merits -- what

24

effect an on-the-merits decision has.

25

I think he agrees that 41(b),

But I think what he says is, it's up to the

1

State courts to decide what an effect an on-the-merits

2

decision has with regard to State causes of action.

3

is there some reason why that can't be true?

4

MR. DELLINGER:

Now,

Yes, and since there are two

5

issues on the table, 1) that they should win because this

6

should be only claim-preclusive, which is what Justice

7

Kennedy asked, and your question, they should win because

8

this is a diversity case.

9

QUESTION:

10

I'm talking the whole hog, right.

MR. DELLINGER:

On the whole -- and if I could

11

just make the most critical point to Justice Kennedy, and

12

then I'll return, which is that the structure of Rule

13

41(b) says that all dismissals, involuntary dismissals are

14

on the merits except those for lack of jurisdiction, lack

15

of venue, and failure to join an indispensable party.

16

Those three are claim-preclusive.

17

are issue-preclusive, and because we know that the three

18

exceptions are issue-preclusive, we therefore know that

19

the basic part of the rule, not the exception,

20

extinguishes the claims, and I think Plout makes no sense

21

otherwise.

22

I'm sorry.

Those three

With respect to the fact that -- the notion that

23

Rule 41(b) should only operate where the first case is a

24

Federal question case and not a diversity case --

25

QUESTION:

No, I'm not saying it should not only

operate.

2

effect of being an adjudication on the merits is only

3

determined by 41(b) in Federal cases, because that is a

4

Federal determination of what the effect of an on-the-

5

merits decision is in a Federal case, and what Mr.

6

Gottesman is saying is that it's up to the States what the

7

effect of an on-the-merits decision is in a non-Federal

case.

QUESTION:

covers both of these.

1

Also, it's important to note how difficult it

2

would be to follow the notion that Rule 41 provides the

3

preclusive effect only in Federal question matters because

4

often, increasingly these days, a lawsuit will encompass

5

both Federal and pendant or supplemental State claims, so

6

that there's simply no indication in the rule that when a

7

Federal court reaches a judgment of dismissal in a case

8

involving Federal questions, in a case involving State law

9

claims, or in a case involving mixed claims, that you

10

don't judge the preclusive effect by looking at Rule 41

11

and how it operates as a judgment of dismissal in the

12

Federal courts.

13

Whether it is a Federal question case or a

14

diversity case, the Federal courts have a strong interest

15

in establishing at the time of dismissal, whether this

16

does extinguish the claim or not, and their suggestion

17

that, you know, why would the Federal courts have an

18

interest -- you may be asking whether the Federal courts

19

have an interest when it's a State law cause of action.

20

I'm just saying that that's the -- let me explain why the

21

Federal courts do have an interest.

22

They would say, look, this is a State law cause

23

of action, and the next lawsuit is going to be filed

24

outside the Federal court system in State courts, but it's

25

important to recognize that the Federal courts do have a

very vital interest in not allowing people casual access

2

to try their cases in Federal court and not be bound by

3

the results.

4

QUESTION:

But access to what?

This is my

5

problem, Mr. Dellinger, with your position.

This is a

6

case that was begun in California State court -- you're

7

relying on Erie and no forum-shopping -- begun in a

8

California State court, removed by the defendant to a

9

California Federal court, and then the case is begun again

10

in Maryland, which has a longer statute of limitations.

11

But for the removal of that diversity case to

12

the Federal court, this case, when it's reinstated in

13

Maryland, would have been heard under the 3-year statute

14

of limitations and one thing we know for sure, there is no

15

substantive policy that either California or the Federal

16

court there is putting forward.

17

They're saying, we don't want to clog our courts

18

with a stale claim, a claim we regard as stale.

If

19

Maryland wants to have its courts occupied by old claims,

20

it's none of our business.

21

this is a procedural policy in that sense, what cases do

22

we want our courts to be dealing with.

23

statute of limitations, as opposed to one that bars the

24

right, is one that's directed to how long we want to open

I agree with the question that

4

California doesn't have much of an interest here, and if

5

you think of this, if we get to it in Erie terms, and I

6

think because this is a Hannah case with a Federal rule

7

squarely on point we never get to Erie, but if you think

8

of it as an Erie case, you're exactly right that

9

California doesn't have an interest.

10

California has determined that the substantive

11

policy should be that there will be a cause of action for

12

business torts.

13

between keeping that alive and the interest of repose in

14

favor of settling at 2 years for how long that should be

15

tried in California.

16

California has balanced the interest

produce?

7

MR. DELLINGER:

Why isn't that a substantive

That's because what is at issue

8

here is not a determination of what the law of business

9

torts ought to be in California.

10
11

What is at issue here is

not even how long one has to sue.
What is at issue here is the effect of a

12

judgment of a case that has been adjudicated in a Federal

13

court, where the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure set up a

14

clear system, a signalling system for saying, all

15

voluntary dismissals are not on the merits, are not claim-

16

preclusive, all involuntary dismissals are, that's a

17

default rule unless you otherwise specify.

18

Now, there may be many reasons why you would

19

think, Justice Scalia, that a Federal judge sitting in

20

diversity ought to make a decision dismissing the case on

21

statute of limitation grounds or any other grounds not

22

claim-preclusive, that the judge ought to specify

23

otherwise, and Rule 41(b) provides for that, so that

2

you ought to take into account is the existence of a

contrary California law on claim preclusion.

4

One of the factors

And if the judge insists on not otherwise

5

specifying, or in this case making it absolutely clear, by

6

saying this dismissal is in its entirety with prejudice

7

and on the merits, you can seek relief under Rule 59 from

the form of that judgment and you can go to the Ninth

Now, that case dealt with Rule 3 of the Federal

that the proper thing for a Federal court to do sitting in

with what Judge Collins should have done in the Federal

words, on the merits, are not peripheral because if they

MR. DELLINGER:

QUESTION:

If they mean any --

-- and therefore, if you apply it,

you can't just look to State law because that would make

the words meaningless in that Heartland issue, and if you

put that -- you applied it where it's not applied, that's

just a mistake like any other court, any other Federal

court.

That's -- is that what your answer is?

MR. DELLINGER:

QUESTION:

6

That's exactly right.

But that's not a good answer, because

they wouldn't --

7

(Laughter.)

8

QUESTION:

I didn't say it was a good answer.

9

QUESTION:

They would not make the words

10

meaningless, you acknowledge, in those cases where you're

11

dealing with a Federal cause of action and where it is

within the power of the Federal courts to say what the

effect of a judgment on the merits is.

give the words meaning.

QUESTION:

That's enough to

It would also finally resolve the

16

merits of the question whether the statute -- whether the

17

claim is barred by the California statute of limitations.

18

That issue is resolved on the merits.

19

MR. DELLINGER:

Well, this Court has never held

20

that a Federal rule simply doesn't apply in diversity

21

cases when the plain text of the rule says it applies to,

22

you know, all suits of a civil nature under Rule 1, and

23

there's just no way to tease that out of the rule.

the question of whether the dismissal of a claim in

California for the running of statute of limitations

3

should preclude the same claim from being brought in

another State.

QUESTION:

Mr. Dellinger, it is the normal rule,

and I think you're well aware that in the -- the Ryder

has been that it's free to proceed with the second action

if the State has a longer limitation.
MR. DELLINGER:

Justice Ginsburg, if I may

12

interrupt, as a matter of full faith and credit, but

13

increasingly -- as a matter of full faith and credit if

14

there's not been a first lawsuit, a State -- the second --

15

the second State in a case like Sun Oil, the second case

16

can apply its own longer statute of limitations, period,

17

even though the first State has a shorter limitations

18

period and is providing the cause of action.

QUESTION:

Well, I wish that you hadn't

interrupted --

MR. DELLINGER:

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

-- only for this reason, because the

next sentence goes on to say, Civil Rule 41(b) is even

24

more clearly inapposite to these problems than to the many

25

other difficult preclusion questions it may seem to touch.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL GOTTESMAN

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Three

8

short points.

First, I think it must be evident that if

9

respondent is right, every defendant in the 25 to 30

10

States which still adhere to the traditional preclusion

11

rules is going to remove every possible case it can to

12

Federal court if it thinks there's a time bar question

13

because, by removing it, it will get preclusion unless,

14

and this is now my second point, unless Justice Breyer's

15

solution becomes the solution.

16

Now, I want to make clear we do not believe

17

41(b) is a preclusion rule, but still I will address the

18

question of whether these problems can get solved that

19

way.

20

advisory committee has said it is not the function of the

21

rendering court, the first court, to worry about the res

22

judicata effect of its decisions.

23

committee notes to Rule 23(c) in 1966, and that is a

24

traditional Hornbook rule.

25

sit around and say, now, let's see what the preclusive

For three reasons, I think they can.

effect of my decision will be.

2

Secondly, it would be --

3

QUESTION:

But the recognition court must look

4

to the rendition court to find out what the preclusive

5

effect --

6

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Right.

Well, to the law of the

7

rendition court.

Not to the court itself, but to the law

8

of the state of the rendition court, that's correct, Your

9

Honor, but you rarely see an opinion in which the opinion

10

ends by saying, and I think this decision ought to have

11

res judicata effect.

12

13

rules.

I mean, it just isn't done, and the

The Court's going to have

If it's -- if the argument is, State law isn't

20

tailor your order appropriately, the parties are going to

21

sit there and analyze the entire jurisprudence of that

22

State in order to write in what it does preclude and what

23

it does not preclude.

24
25

It would be an impossible task.

And thirdly, it would mean that you would have
constant appeals, because districts -- we now have created

a whole nother issue to litigate in the rendering court.

2

Parties might not ultimately decide to bring a second

3

lawsuit, but they're got to worry that in case I might I'd

4

sure better get this thing right, and we are going to have

5

endless litigation in that first court, and it will be a

6

Federal court, because we're talking about Rule 41 here.

7

Now, the third point I want to make is this.

8

There's something very asymmetric about this.
