CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Guttentag.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LUCAS GUTTENTAG

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. GUTTENTAG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The jurisdictional issue presented in this case

12

is whether a legal ruling by the Attorney General on a

13

pure question of law compelling the deportation of long-

14

time legal permanent residents is reviewable in any court.

15

Never in our country's history has an alien been subject

16

to deportation without the judicial branch determining the

17

legal validity of the administrative deportation order.

18

We submit that the Constitution does not permit

19

denying judicial scrutiny of the Attorney General's

20

ruling, and that the statute did not deprive this Court

21

and the district court and the courts of appeals of

22

considering the pure question of law presented in this

23

case.

24
25

QUESTION:

You say the legal validity of his

deportation is at issue.

In what respect to you claim he

MR. GUTTENTAG:

3

QUESTION:

4
5

Your Honor --

As I understood it, it is conceded

that he met the qualifications for deportation.
MR. GUTTENTAG:

He is -- our clients are subject

6

to the deportability grounds, but they are not subject to

7

deportation without an adjudication of the application for

8

discretionary relief.

9

QUESTION:

The final order of deportation -What you're complaining about is that

10

the Attorney General did not accord them discretionary

11

relief, but all of your grounds for asserting that you're

12

not deportable you had an opportunity to challenge in

13

court, didn't you?

14

MR. GUTTENTAG:

Well, Your Honor, the question

15

is whether the final order of deportation was properly

16

entered and, under this Court's case law --

17

QUESTION:

It was properly entered if all of the

18

qualifications for deportation existed.

19

that the Attorney General did not exercise his discretion

20

to let your client stay in the country nonetheless.

21

MR. GUTTENTAG:

Your complaint is

No, Your Honor, we disagree with

22

that, respectfully.

The final order of deportation cannot

23

be entered until there is an adjudication on the

24

application for discretionary relief if the person is

25

eligible to apply.

In this case, the Attorney General -4

QUESTION:

What is your authority for that

proposition, Mr. Guttentag, your case authority?

3

MR. GUTTENTAG:

The Chadha case, Your Honor, the

4

Foti case, all said that the final order of deportation is

5

contingent on --

6
7

QUESTION:

Attorney General's discretion, was it?

8
9

But that was not talking about the

MR. GUTTENTAG:

Yes.

In all those cases, Your

Honor, the question was whether a final order of

10

deportation, and whether the discretionary element

11

that's -- on which the final order is contingent was

12

reviewable in court, and the way the Immigration Act is --

13

Well, that was before the IIRIRA, or

however you pronounce it.

Act, both before and after, there is a two-part process

20

whether a person falls within the grounds enumerated in

21

the statute.

QUESTION:

Then the second

And also that all of those grounds

4

can be challenged in court, that IIRIRA does not prevent

5

judicial review of all of those grounds of deportation,

6

right?

7

MR. GUTTENTAG:

Well, that's a construction of

8

the statute, Your Honor, that the Government's offered.

9

We don't dispute that, although we come to that conclusion

10

for different reasons, but the question is whether the

11

final order of deportation itself is reviewable, and the

12

final order cannot be entered -- and I believe the

13

Government will concede this, Your Honor --

14

QUESTION:

Could I just interrupt you with one

15

quick -- do you concede that a conviction prior to the

16

date of the enactment of the statute is proper ground for

17

deportation without having an opportunity for

18

discretionary review?

19
20
21

MR. GUTTENTAG:

Well, the conviction itself is a

basis for triggering the grounds of deportability.
QUESTION:

Well, I understand, but are you

22

conceding convictions prior to the enactment of the

23

statute have the same legal effect as convictions after

24

the enactment of the statute?

entitled to an adjudication at the administrative level,

contains this discretion.

10

MR. GUTTENTAG:

That's -- isn't that your basic

Yes.

Our basic claim, Your

Honor, is -QUESTION:

Now -- okay.

Let me ask you part 2

11

of my question.

Do you also claim that if you are, or if

12

your client in this case is entitled to an exercise of

13

discretion, that the exercise of discretion itself is

14

reviewable for abuse of discretion?

15

MR. GUTTENTAG:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. GUTTENTAG:

No, we do not, Your Honor.

Okay.
Our claim is that the question

18

of legal eligibility to apply for the discretionary relief

19

is reviewable.

The Attorney General --

QUESTION:

Mr. Guttentag, may I just add a post

21

script on that question to -- suppose the Attorney General

22

were to say, in light of AEDPA, and however you pronounce

23

the other statute, I have decided that henceforth I will

24

exercise my discretion never to be gracious, and I will

25

simply deny these applications.

It is as an exercise of

discretion, and it's in tune with what I think is the

2

current climate in the legislature.

3
4

You just answered Justice Souter that you would
not challenge an exercise of discretion.

5

MR. GUTTENTAG:

Your Honor, we believe that the

6

question of a categorical denial raises a different issue,

7

and whether that's permissible or not, raises a distinct

8

question.

9

But just to be clear, the Attorney General has

10

not done that in this case.

11

said is that he lacks the legal authority to exercise

12

discretion, on a pure question of interpreting the statute

13

that Congress has divested him of the legal authority to

14

consider applications for discretionary relief.

15

What the Attorney General has

We do not believe that the Attorney General, if

16

he interpreted this statute correctly, would adopt a

17

categorical rule.

18

has determined that he lacks any discretionary authority.

19

How he exercises that authority would be a separate and

20

distinct question.

21

QUESTION:

There's no reason to believe that.

He

Suppose there's a case in which it's

1

final order of deportation?

2

MR. GUTTENTAG:

3

QUESTION:

4

No, there's not, Your Honor.

Why do you concede there's a final

order of deportation here, or do you?

5

MR. GUTTENTAG:

6

QUESTION:

Well, we do not --

Because it seems to me that may be

7

important under the interpretation of the statute.

It

8

seems to me you can argue that where, as in your case,

9

the alien requests the Attorney General to exercise the

10

Attorney General's discretion, there is no final order of

11

deportability until he does so.

12

MR. GUTTENTAG:

Well, we certainly agree that

13

there's not a legally valid final order of deportation.

14

There was an order issued by the Board of Immigration

15

Appeals, so in that sense there's a piece of paper that

16

constitutes a final order, but we agree that there's not a

17

legally valid final order.

18

QUESTION:

19

order under the statute, 1252?

20

Well, do you think there's a final

MR. GUTTENTAG:

The (a)(2) -- well, we believe

21

there's a final order for purposes of seeking judicial

22

review of the BIA's decision.

23

constitutes a final order.

24

legally valid final order because of the Attorney

25

General's ruling.

3

QUESTION:

Do you think this is a final order of

removal against an alien who is removable?
MR. GUTTENTAG:

Well, Your Honor, we believe

4

that the statute, the (a)(2)(C) does not apply to bar

5

review of this claim.

6

provision barring review does not apply.

7

because it doesn't constitute a final order within the

8

meaning of the statute as intended, because there's a

9

legal error underlying the adjudication, or whether there

10

is a final order but it's reviewable nonetheless for that

11

legal -- because it lacks legal validity, either way

12

there's review of that determination.

13

QUESTION:

What the -- we believe that the
Whether it's

Well, I'm just -- in just looking at

14

this statute, it seems to me that the Attorney General

15

does not give much force to the phrase, who is removable.

16

MR. GUTTENTAG:

17

QUESTION:

Right, and that is an --

It makes for an awkward statute,

18

frankly, if you take it out, but it's -- I thought that

19

your argument might be that this -- your client is not an

20

alien who is removable under a final order.

21

MR. GUTTENTAG:

We would certainly accept that

22

interpretation, Your Honor, if removable is not the term

23

that normally appears in the Immigration Act, because the

24

technical term would be deportable.

25

QUESTION:

But you're saying that because

1

removable means a person who is potentially deportable,

2

that your client is removable?

3

MR. GUTTENTAG:

No.

We would -- I -- Your

4

Honor, we believe that it's very difficult to interpret

5

this statute, that --

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. GUTTENTAG:

That the one thing it doesn't do

8

is preclude review of the legal claim presented here.

9

Whether that's because the term is removable --

10

QUESTION:

Well, I'm asking if you could make

11

the argument that your client is not removable because the

12

statute does not prevent discretion being exercised as to

13

him, you've asked for discretion, it hasn't been

14

exercised, so there is no final order against an alien who

15

is removable.

16
17

MR. GUTTENTAG:

We would certainly accept that

interpretation.

18

QUESTION:

But you didn't -- you don't --

QUESTION:

I'm sure you would, but

20

unfortunately --

21

QUESTION:

But did you argue -- you don't argue

that?

We've argued principally that

1

because of the constitutional problems that would be

2

raised by barring all review.

3

QUESTION:

We believe that --

Well, under my submission, and

4

frankly I don't think this works, because the statute is

5

pretty awkward and because of what you've already said

6

about removal, but under -- if there was some merit to

7

this interpretation and it could be adopted to avoid the

8

constitutional problem, then the review wouldn't even be

9

by habeas, it would be just under the review mechanisms of

10

the statute.

11

MR. GUTTENTAG:

12

QUESTION:

13

And we --

You don't seem to be too happy with

that.

14

MR. GUTTENTAG:

15

that, Your Honor --

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. GUTTENTAG:

No, we absolutely will accept

Well --- because we believe that there

18

can be review in the court of appeals, and that if the

19

term removable means only a properly entered final order

20

of removable -- removal, then our clients are not

21

removable.

QUESTION:

MR. GUTTENTAG:

13

Not all of them
Subsection (g),

It does not contain the language that you now

MR. GUTTENTAG:

But Your Honor, we don't -- that

14

language does not preclude review of our claim, because

15

what 242(g) does is place all review in the court of

appeals, and we agree that review can be in the court of

appeals.

permits that, because we agree that the final order of

We believe that habeas corpus

10

review in the district courts is not barred by the

11

language of this statute, but that the scope of review

12

that would be heard in the district courts can certainly

13

be placed in the court of appeals, as this Court has

14

always said that the --

16
17

QUESTION:

Well then, you don't agree with the

Second Circuit's decision here.
MR. GUTTENTAG:

We -- the Second Circuit held

18

that there was district court habeas corpus jurisdiction

19

because it first concluded that there was no review

20

possible in the court of appeals.

21

review is possible in the court of appeals, and we believe

22

that it is, because (a)(2)(C) should be construed as to

23

permit review in the court of appeals, then the district

court habeas corpus procedure need not be available.

2

MR. GUTTENTAG:

Your Honor, I think the term is

3

ambiguous, because it is not the term, deportable, which

4

is what the immigration statute uses to determine what --

5

to say that someone is subject to deportation.

6

not say, subject to a final order of removal, which is --

7
8

QUESTION:

So what do you --

It does

what do you -- how

do you interpret it?

9

MR. GUTTENTAG:

Your Honor, we believe it means

10

that someone who could be removable, but is not subject to

11

final order of removal, so therefore the statute would not

12

apply to that individual.

13

It's a term that appears in various places in

14

the Immigration Act.

15

can tell, a consistent meaning throughout the Act.

QUESTION:

And it doesn't have, as far as we

Was it adopted just in connection

1

under that kind of a reading, embrace the requirement that

2

he actually committed a criminal offense covered in

3

section 1182(a)(2)?

4

I mean, if you're going to read removable, who

5

is removable that broadly, that is to say that any defect

6

in the proceedings which rendered the order of removal

7

invalid causes him not to be removable, you simply open up

8

the whole statute.

9

not to be removable takes him out of (a)(2)(C).

10
11

You say any defect which causes him
I mean,

it just cuts a swath through the entire statute.
MR. GUTTENTAG:

Well, we don't believe it does,

12

Your Honor, but the critical question is whether this

13

claim must be reviewed in some court, and we believe that

14

the answer to that question is clear.

15

QUESTION:

That's your constitutional argument,

16

but we're trying to discuss first a proposed statutory

17

argument which would avoid our reaching that, and I'm

18

suggesting that if you read who is removable to embrace --

19

to make a person unremovable where anything that should

20

have been done has not been done, you open up the whole

21

prior proceedings.

22

MR. GUTTENTAG:

Well, but I believe it's

possible to read it, Your Honor, providing a properly

24

entered final order of removal, and that would include the

relief, that if the statute entitles --

2

QUESTION:

But, of course, the discretionary

3

relief provision was changed, too, wasn't it, and doesn't

4

afford it now for people convicted of this type of crime.

5

MR. GUTTENTAG:

Right, but our contention on the

6

merits, Your Honor, is that our clients are eligible for

7

the discretionary relief as it existed at the time of the

8

preenactment event.

9

Attorney General has determined that they're not eligible.

10

The question of eligibility for that relief was decided by

11

a legal ruling of the Attorney General that -- and that

12

determines whether or not it was a properly entered final

13

QUESTION:

Getting back to the statute, and

18

Justice Scalia's question, the question was, well, suppose

19

he hadn't committed a criminal offense, would that be

20

grounds for saying that the statute doesn't apply?

21

thought your answer would be yes, even the Government

22

concedes that --

MR. GUTTENTAG:

Yes, and that whether or not the

2

person actually committed the offense is a question of

3

whether they fit within one of the enumerated categories

4

that are set forth in the statute, and I believe the

5

Government does concede that.

6

QUESTION:

7
8
9

Well, are you saying you could go

behind a judgment of conviction?
MR. GUTTENTAG:

No, absolutely not, Your Honor.

That's a determination that's made in the criminal

10

procedure, and when that certified conviction is brought

11

before the immigration judge, that's dispositive on the

12

question of whether or not there's a disqualifying

13

conviction.

14

But then the question is whether that conviction

15

constitutes a deportable offense within the meaning of the

16

Immigration Act, and that's a question that the Government

17

agrees is reviewable and, as I indicated, that the

18

question of whether or not the final order of removal was

19

properly entered must be reviewable as well, and if

20

there's been a failure to allow the person to apply for

21

the discretionary relief for which they are entitled by

22

statute, then that cannot be a legally valid order of

23

removal, and again I --

24
25

QUESTION:

But the one difference, then, that

has been made, that as I understand it that you concede,

is that on your view, once it is determined that the

2

Attorney General did apply the statute that authorizes

3

discretion, that would be the end of the review.

4

could not be a further step in which you say, the refusal

5

to exercise it in favor of my client was an abuse of

6

discretion.

You concede that, I take it?

MR. GUTTENTAG:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. GUTTENTAG:

Yes, we do, Your Honor.

Okay.
We believe that Congress did

10

significantly restrict the scope of judicial review of

11

final orders issued against so-called criminal aliens.

12

recognize that.

13

We

Our contention is only that the core review that

14

has always existed and that has never been prohibited as

15

to questions of law and as to the legal validity of the

16

deportation order, that that issue must remain reviewable;

17

that there's never been a time during the entire period

18

when review was severely curtailed under the finality

19

provisions that we detail in our brief at some length;

20

that there was a long period of time when there was no

21

review of orders of deportation except in habeas corpus

22

proceedings, and what this Court repeatedly recognized is

23

that that scope of review is extremely narrow, but it does

24

encompass a question of the legal validity of the order,

25

and questions of the construction of the Immigration Act,

2

and that's what's at issue here.
The Attorney General has construed the

3

Immigration Act to say that our clients are not eligible

4

to apply for the exercise of discretion to which the

5

statute entitles them.

6

in a court to determine whether the Attorney General

7

improperly excluded an entire class of people from

8

eligibility for discretionary relief, and this Court's

9

decision in Foti and in Chadha and in other cases

That question must be reviewable

10

recognized that the final order is contingent on the

11

issuance -- the adjudication of discretionary relief, and

12

that means two questions.

13

QUESTION:

One is --

Again, does that mean there is no

14

final order here, or is it a contingent final order,

15

because this is very important for the statutory argument.

16

MR. GUTTENTAG:

Your Honor, if there is no

17

legally issued adjudication, then I suppose it's accurate

18

to say there's no legally valid order, and so therefore

19

there isn't a final order.

20
21

QUESTION:

But that -- but then Justice Souter's

question is, suppose the discretion was just abused.

22

MR. GUTTENTAG:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. GUTTENTAG:

Would there then be a final order?

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

Don't you need a final order to go to

7

the court of appeals in the first place?
MR. GUTTENTAG:

Yes, Your Honor.

As I

indicated, there must be that piece of paper from the

9

Board of Immigration Appeals saying this person is ordered

10

removed from the United States.

12

QUESTION:

That's what triggers

So you've got a final order for

13

purposes of seeking review, but if you get the review, you

14

say, well, it is not a valid final order because it was

entered without application of the authority to grant

16

discretion.

MR. GUTTENTAG:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. GUTTENTAG:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Yes.
That's exactly our -- and the

20

question of eligibility for relief is entirely distinct

21

from the exercise of discretion.

decision as to eligibility for discretionary relief, then

6

questions that would be raised if there were no review at

decision, and that ambiguity can come from the term,

ambiguities in one sentence that you've focused on?
MR. GUTTENTAG:

We think there are many

ambiguities.

I believe the Government as well is finding

ambiguities in this statute.

20

to limit the role of the courts, and our contention is

21

that it can do that, but it cannot preclude the courts

22

from reviewing and determining the legal validity of the

We think the Accardi case is very significant in

2

this respect, because in the Accardi case, this Court

confronted the question of the scope of habeas corpus

case of an alien who was admittedly deportable, there was

no issue about that, and claimed that he had not gotten a

had refused to exercise his discretion, as was required.

ground that habeas corpus did not encompass the claim

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In 1996, in two separate statutes, Congress

22

fundamentally restructured the Nation's immigration laws.

23

There are amendments of general applicability, and also

24

ones specifically dealing with criminal aliens to ensure

25

that criminal aliens were expeditiously removed from the

1

United States.

2

Briefly, the three amendments of general

3

applicability that are most relevant to these two cases

4

this morning are Congress's elimination of deportation and

5

exclusion proceedings, and replacing them with a single

6

proceeding called removal.

7

the prior 1182(c) under which petitioners here seek

8

relief, and replaced it with a new proceeding, or form of

9

discretionary relief called cancellation of removal, and

Secondly, Congress repealed

10

third, Congress reenacted, or enacted a new judicial

11

review provision which channeled judicial review, if it's

12

to be had at all, to the courts of appeals.

13

The two amendments specifically dealing with

14

criminal aliens that are relevant here is that Congress

15

not only repealed the prior 1182(c), but rendered

16

aggravated felons and in some cases other criminal aliens

17

altogether ineligible for cancellation of removal, and

18

secondly, Congress provided in section 1252(a)(2)(C) of

19

the Act that no court, which includes both the court of

20

appeals and the district court, shall have jurisdiction to

21

remove -- to review an order of removal entered against an

22

alien who had committed one of the specified criminal

23

offenses.

24
25

The theory was that an alien, just like a
citizen, would have full access to the courts to contest

the criminal conviction in the criminal proceedings, both

2

direct review and collateral attack, but once that was

3

done, the validity of the conviction was established, and

4

therefore, with respect to access to the courts, there was

5

really no further need to test the central basis on which

6

the alien was to be removed.

7

QUESTION:

Could you just remind me, what

8

happens if a collateral attack is underway and the Justice

9

Department institutes deportation proceedings?

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Unless and until the criminal

11

conviction was set aside, it would be a conviction on

12

which the removal order could be based.

13

QUESTION:

Suppose there were a very strong

14

showing of deficiency in the conviction, a Brady

15

violation, Gideon violation, would the collateral review

16

court have the authority to stay the deportation?

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

I wouldn't think that would be

true, but I think typically what would happen is the

immigration judge would stay the removal proceedings.

I'm not certain which avenue --

QUESTION:

Oh, but I thought there was no

review -MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

There is -- if the claim

11

was -- if the alien was in a position that the substantive

12

ground for removal may be invalid, and that's -- not the

13

eligibility for discretionary relief, but the substantive

14

ground of removal may be invalid because there's an

15

ongoing collateral attack, then I -- my assumption is that

16

some court -- first of all, I think the immigration court

17

would stop it, or the BIA could prevent the proceedings

18

from going forward, either one, or the Attorney General,

19

but failing that, I'm confident that some court would

20

probably have review.

21

I'm not sure whether -- perhaps the collateral

22

review court, although I'm not sure why that would be so,

23

because it could be a State collateral proceeding that the

24

alien was trying to have his conviction, State court

the more fundamental point is, the alien wouldn't be

first -- I was just addressing the question of power, not

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

How do you draw that

Well, this was a preclusion of

17

review that was obviously intended to accomplish

18

something, and petitioners --

19

QUESTION:

And their answer is, what it

20

accomplished is, no more review of the exercise of

21

discretion when the discretion is exercised.

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

That is not governed by paragraph

23

(C).

That is governed by the preceding paragraph,

1252(a)(2)(B) on the same page, which independently bars

any judgment regarding the granting of relief under

certain specified sections, or any other decision that is

2

vested in the discretion of the Attorney General, so that

3

category of decisions that are -- that petitioners are

4

conceding is not even addressed by this provision.

5

This provision must mean something else, and we

6

think it quite clearly encompasses denial of discretionary

7

relief by the Attorney General, whether that denial is

8

based on an exercise of discretion or the Attorney

9

General's determination that Congress has not conferred on

10

him the power to exercise discretion.

11

the alien has been denied relief that Congress has

12

specified is discretionary, and as that --

13

QUESTION:

In either event,

What Justice Kennedy started out

14

with, I thought, was that their claim here is, there is a

15

section of a new statute, and that section doesn't apply,

16

because it isn't retroactive.

17

this Court doesn't have jurisdiction to adjudicate a claim

18

under that section because it doesn't apply.

19

Now, that's like saying,

Now, maybe they're right, maybe they're wrong,

20

but it sounds as if they're making a claim that is a claim

21

of jurisdiction, or very similar to one, and how do you

22

distinguish that very basic claim that there is no

23

jurisdiction because there is no applicable law from the

24

claims that you admit you could hear, which include, I am

25

not the alien, I am not removable -- you say in your brief

1

they could hear whether the alien is removable, whether

2

the ground of removal is one which precludes judicial

3

review, whether the statute is unconstitutional, and

4

whether the proceeding is fundamentally unfair.

5

those, you say, could be heard under this statute --

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

7

QUESTION:

All of

Because they --

-- and I want to know what is

8

different about a claim, there is no jurisdiction because

9

this whole section of the new statute simply doesn't

10
11

apply.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, The Attorney General

12

certainly has jurisdiction to decide whether to grant

13

discretionary relief.

14

The Attorney General can decide that on a

15

variety of factors, including the Attorney General's

16

understanding of the statute, just as a discretionary

17

determination to exercise prosecutorial discretion not to

18

bring an administrative proceeding that was before this

19

Court in Food and Nutrition Workers you could decide, the

20

agency could decide not to bring the case because they

21

didn't think the equities warranted it, or because of an

22

interpretation of the statute.

23

That interpretation may be wrong, but when

24

something -- when Congress intends to vest something in

25

the discretion of an administrative officer, that includes

legal issues that may bear on the exercise of

2

discretion --

3

QUESTION:

And that includes saying you didn't

4

intend us to have discretion?

5

If the question is, is there discretion, then how is it

6

compatible with that scheme for the secretary to say, I'm

7

going to determine as a matter of administrative fiat that

8

there is no discretion.

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

That seems to me very odd.

No, what Congress has done is

10

vest in the Attorney General of the United States the

11

responsibility for interpreting and administering the

12

immigration laws, and in section 1103, that this Court

13

relied upon in the Ageri-Ageri case, this Court said that

14

the Attorney General's interpretation of the immigration

15

laws is controlling.

16

Congress -- in other words, what Congress did

17

with respect to the question at issue here was to vest the

18

final determination whether to grant discretionary relief

19

in the Attorney General, whether that is based on an

20

interpretation of the statute, or the exercise of

21

discretion, or sometimes a combination of the two.

22

QUESTION:

But this claim comes very close to

23

being covered by the combination of the Heikkila and

24

Accardi cases, which together indicate that the

25

Constitution requires some kind of judicial review over a

claim that an executive actor unlawfully failed to

2

exercise any discretion.

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, in Accardi, as Justice

4

Scalia pointed out, it's difficult to figure out exactly

5

on what basis jurisdiction was exercised in Accardi.

6

Supreme Court -- this Court --

7

QUESTION:

The

True, it didn't spell it out, but if

8

you look at Heikkila and Accardi together, there's some

9

indication of support for the position of your opposing

10

counsel.

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, one thing to bear in mind

12

is that the petitioner in Accardi argued the case in terms

13

of a due process violation.

14

that the Attorney General had engaged in prejudgment and

15

had deliberately subverted an administrative scheme for

16

adjudicating discretionary applications, and the

17

petitioner argued that that was a violation of due

18

process.

19

What was alleged there was

Now, this Court subsequently has said in the

20

University of Missouri, in 435 U.S., that Accardi did not

21

state a rule of constitutional law binding on the States,

22

so in light of subsequent understandings of what Accardi

23

stood for, it would seem odd that if it didn't state a

24

fundamental rule of constitutional law that is binding on

25

the States, that it would nonetheless be the sort of thing

I wanted to respond to two statutory questions,

and then perhaps explore this point further.

exercise of discretion, in those cases suspension of

That -- the Court explored that, though, solely

10

for purposes of deciding which court would, as a statutory

11

matter, have jurisdiction over the particular claim there,

12

and what the Court said is, sensibly it only -- it makes

13

sense for suspension of deportation claims to be heard in

14

the courts of appeals because the Attorney General has

15

chosen to adjudicate applications for suspension of

16

deportation together with the substantive basis for

17

deportation in one single proceeding.

18

But the Court made pretty clear in Foti that the

19

Attorney General was not required to do that, and it would

20

have been equally consistent with the Act for the Attorney

21

General to determine whether to grant relief to particular

22

aliens outside of the affirmative removal proceeding as a

23

matter of discretion, maybe on a sort of certiorari

24

jurisdiction to the Attorney General to decide at the

close of the case whether to do that or not, and that

remains the case under the current law.
Nothing in the Act requires that the Attorney

3

General adjudicate an application for 1182(c) relief, or

4

for cancellation of removal before entering a final order

5

of removal.

6

The regulations provide that method of

7

adjudication, but nothing in the Act does, and the

8

question, I think, for purposes of whether judicial review

9

is compelled is whether there is a statutory right,

10

because after all, Congress has plenary power over

11

immigration, over the jurisdiction of the lower Federal

12

courts, and broad power over the fashioning of the writ of

13

habeas corpus, as this Court said in Felker, and Congress

14

could legitimately decide if there is

15

right to have an application for cancellation or 1182(c)

relief adjudicated in a particular --

have to decide the question of whether they have

statute just doesn't apply?

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

For the reasons that I said,

8

that -- for the reason that I said, is that the Act does

not require that.

All 1182(c) said is the Attorney

General may admit an alien.

what proceeding that will be held in.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, whether or not there would

be -- whether or not there would be a review of a

constitutional claim we think would be a different matter.

For example, in Chadha, Chadha was a constitutional

that the Attorney General may admit an alien and, with

has said in cases like Jay v. Boyd, and maybe five terms

It is

admitted consequences of an order of removal, to lift the

It is a matter of grace, in no sense a matter of right.

13

QUESTION:

But is the concept of abuse of

discretion -- his authority to exercise discretion,

there's lots of discretion in Federal agencies, but

there's also a concept of abuse of discretion, and you

seem to be saying no, there isn't.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, not every situation in

20

a right to exercise discretion, is there judicial review

21

of that.

like Heikkila v. Cheney, and like Food and Nutrition

QUESTION:

The refusal to grant a pardon, since

you're analogizing this --

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

-- to the pardon power.

I assume

6

we wouldn't review the President's refusal to exercise the

7

pardon power for abuse of discretion.

8
9

MR. KNEEDLER:

Absolutely, and this isn't to say

that the Attorney General may not -- or the President at

10

some point may decline to exercise the pardon power for a

11

reason that would be thought contrary to law, but that

12

doesn't mean that the possibility of getting a pardon, or

13

in this case a discretionary dispensation from removal,

14

gives right to a personal right that the Constitution

15

requires Congress to provide access to the courts to

16

litigate.

17

And Congress enacted IIRIRA against the

18

background of great frustration with the inability of the

19

system to remove criminal aliens from the United States,

20

and because of the potential for criminal aliens to tie up

21

the courts in trying to stave off the removal.

construction of the statute is right, but sort of in the

background of this case is the question whether

have the same legal significance as convictions obtained

afterwards, and am I correct in understanding that the

MR. KNEEDLER:

That is true, because again, what

Congress has done has granted a discretionary authority to

13

the Attorney General to decide whether to dispense with

14

removal or not, and let me --

15

QUESTION:

What you are doing when you say that,

16

it seems to me, is reading the words of the statute that

says, removable by virtue of the criminal convictions and

so on, to mean not removable, but to mean ordered removed

19

by the Attorney General.

20

says removable, and you are reading it to say, ordered

removed, thereby insulating the courts, or the alien from

the possibility of challenging the correctness of the

removal proceedings, and it says -- now, again, it says in

this section, meaning the section dealing with removal,

3

and the next section, which deals with cancellation of

removal, the statute says, the term removable means, in

5

the case of an alien who hasn't been admitted, that the

6

alien is inadmissable under 1182 of the Act, or, in the

7

case of an alien admitted to the United States, such as

8

the aliens here, that the alien is deportable under

section 1227 of this title.

In other words, the term is

meant to identify the substantive ground on removal

QUESTION:

Nobody is removable by reason of that

alone.

I mean, if you take removable in the broad sense

5

to mean all of the conditions have been complied with to

6

make the removal proper, if you take it in that broad

7

sense, this provision makes no sense, because in that

8

broad sense, nobody is removable solely by reason of

9

having committed a criminal offense.

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's true.

I mean, as you

11

pointed out, read expansively it could go to any question

12

that might be thought to call into question the propriety

of the Attorney General's action.

order.

I was trying to envision what such a challenge
would be, given the tightness of the statute.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I suppose there could be --

7

we don't think it would fail, but I mean -- we don't think

8

it would succeed, but if there were some argument that it

9

would be constitutionally impermissible to apply a ground

10

of deportation to conduct that arose before the statute

11

was passed, or that there was some sort of equal

12

protection violation in singling out one ground of removal

13

over another in providing a ground for removal, that could

14

be a constitutional challenge to the statute under which

15

the person is being ordered removed.

16

QUESTION:

If you concede that, why couldn't the

litigants in this case say, we make that constitutional

to challenge the constitutional ground of removal.

Congress -- as we point out in our brief, the

one thing that is clear from the legislative background of

the passage of IIRIRA and AEDPA is that Congress wanted to

expeditiously remove criminal aliens from the United

States, and it regarded the entry of the judgment of

conviction as a sufficient ground for doing so.

Congress eliminated discretionary grounds for removal, but

it surely would not have intended to have litigation over

that.

QUESTION:

Yes, but that's all perfectly clear

with respect to convictions after the statute is passed,

15

but the problem is, it's not quite as clear, as least, as

16

to convictions before the statute was passed, and that's

17

why we have the problem.

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

It is, but it wouldn't be at all

19

surprising that in the climate in which Congress acted,

what Congress wanted to do was to vest the final

determination on questions such as that in the Attorney

Well, I have some question about

that.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, this Court held in the

Lopez case -QUESTION:

I thought the Chennary case, which I

11

never fully understood, says that if the exercise of

12

discretion is committed to an official, the official must

13

exercise that discretion in some instances.

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, this is a statute -- again,

15

looking at the statute, in which Congress has given the

16

power to the Attorney General, but unlike, for example,

17

the asylum provision, the asylum provision says in section

18

208, the Attorney General shall establish a procedure for

19

aliens to file applications for asylum, meaning that the

20

Attorney General has to at least be in a position to

21

receive an application and do something with it.

22

There is no such provision in this Act that

23

requires the Attorney General to receive and consider a

24

particular application for relief from deportation, just

25

as there is nothing to require the President to actually

entertain and pass upon an application for a pardon, and

2

this Court said in Jay v. Boyd that this relief is to be

3

regarded much as the application for a pardon to the

4

President of the United States.

5

One final point I want to make clear is that,

6

whatever else may be true with respect to judicial review,

7

the court of appeals was certainly wrong to say that

8

judicial review would be in the district court.

9

stand this Act on its head to suggest that criminal aliens

It would

10

whom Congress wanted to remove from the country with

11

particular emphasis would be able to go to the district

12

courts, get a level of review there, go to the court of

13

appeals, and then perhaps to this Court.

14

QUESTION:

Well, what was wrong with the court

15

of appeals saying, if there's nothing else, there's always

16

the general habeas, unless Congress says specifically --

17

mentioning the statutory provision by number or name.

18

That essentially was the Second Circuit's position, was it

19

not?

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, there's no requirement that

21

Congress, in order to channel all review to a court of

22

appeals, has to specifically mention 2241, but --

23

QUESTION:

Yes, but the answer -- the Second

24

Circuit was saying, we accept what the Government tells

25

us, there's no review in the court of appeals, but

Congress has not deleted the general habeas authority.

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

Congress did two things before

3

IIRIRA was enacted in section 401(e), in a provision

4

called, Elimination of Habeas Corpus, Congress repealed

5

the prior provision for habeas corpus relief and secondly,

6

in the provision enacted here, it channeled all review to

7

the courts of appeals.

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.

Mr. Guttentag, you have 4 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LUCAS GUTTENTAG

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12

MR. GUTTENTAG:

Thank you.

13

I want to be clear that, under the statute,

14

there's no final order of deportation until the

15

application for discretionary relief is adjudicated.

16

has been the case since these statutes were first enacted

17

in 1917, when discretionary --

18

QUESTION:

That

Can you give me some authority for

19

that proposition, either under the statute, or under our

20

cases?

21

MR. GUTTENTAG:

22

proposition, Your Honor.

23

that proposition.

24
25

QUESTION:

The Chadha case stands for that
The Foti case clearly stands for

The Government says that those cases

came out that way simply because the Attorney General had,

1

as a discretionary matter, decided to determine the

2

discretionary element together with the merits

3

determination, so as a matter of fact, it happened to have

4

been preceding the order of deportation, but that there

5

was no legal requirement that that be the case.

6

MR. GUTTENTAG:

There continues to be the case

7

that the regulations require that, Your Honor.

8

doubt about that, that the regulations require the

9

immigration judge to adjudicate an application for relief.

10

There's no

That, in and of itself, is a duty.

11

Secondly, the cases do say that the final order

12

is contingent on the determination, and this is not about

13

the exercise --

14

16

QUESTION:

Do you have a regulation number for

that, or -MR. GUTTENTAG:

It's 212 -- it was 212e(b)(2), I

17

believe, and it's currently also the regulation governing

18

the current version of that, which is the cancellation of

19

removal, and I'd be happy to provide it at the next case,

20

if that's -- that that final order -- and I don't believe

21

the Government would actually contend that under the

22

statute as it's currently implemented, and as it has been

23

since 1917, and under the regulations that govern, that a

24

final order could be entered with the immigration judge or

25

simply say, I refuse to adjudicate your application for

2

relief.

3

If the Attorney General determines that the

4

individual is not legally eligible, then so be it, but

5

that claim is reviewable.

6

exercises discretion, then that is not reviewable, and we

7

concede that.

If the Attorney General

The -- what the -- what this Court has said
about the pardon analogy to the discretionary decision

10

goes to the exercise of discretion.

11

from the Jay v. Boyd case.

12

Your Honor, where the exercise of discretion is not

13

reviewable, but the question of whether the Attorney

14

General has properly construed who is eligible, the

15

Attorney General in this case has said that an entire

16

class of individuals is ineligible because I determined

17

that, Congress instructed me to apply this law

18

retroactively.

19

That's very clear

It's clear from the Yang case,

Whether the statute applies retroactively or not

20

is a question that the courts must decide.

21

Landgraf said, and it's for Congress to legislate clearly

22

and specifically what the temporal scope of the statute

23

is, and that's not for the Attorney General to determine.

24
25

That's what

I also, in regard to the particular provision
governing the review of discretionary decisions that

1

Mr. Kneedler referred to, that refers to particular

2

determinations there in the -- that are in the discretion

3

of the Attorney General.

4

remain reviewable, so it's clear that the preclusion

5

provision here still would do a significant amount of

6

work, and as far as the definition of what constitute --

7

of what removable means, that definition does not

8

specifically apply to the term in section 1252, in the

9

judicial review provision.

10

For example, asylum claims

It is a definition, but it

does not specifically apply to what we have at issue here.

11

And finally, in terms of the Government arguing

12

that the Attorney General could simply decide to deny any

13

exercise of discretion, that is the Chennary principle,

14

that the decision of the Attorney General must be, correct

15

or not --
