ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The harmonized tariff schedule employs more than

12

9,000 individual categories and more than half-a-million

13

words to classify every conceivable article of commerce

14

for tariff purposes.

15

initially by an international commission, and in 1988 it

16

was enacted in its entirety as a law of the United States.

17

Two terms ago in the Haggar case this Court held

This massive document was drafted

18

that courts should defer to the reasonable interpretive

19

regulations adopted by the customs service to implement

20

these complex tariff provisions.

21

however, the Federal Circuit held that it would give no

22

weight whatever to the interpretive rulings adopted by the

23

customs service to apply the tariff provisions in specific

24

situations under the very same statutory provisions.

25

In the present case,

The court, having concluded it would give no

1

deference to the agency rulings, then held that the

2

particular item involved in this case, known as a date

3

planner, would not constitute a bound diary within the

4

specific meaning of the tariff provision we have here

5

before us.

6

and its ultimate classification determination are both

7

incorrect.

8
9

In our view, the court's method of analysis

In enacting a harmonized tariff schedule,
Congress specified that -- its understanding and intent

10

that the customs service would be responsible for

11

interpreting and applying these provisions, and for that

12

purpose Congress gave broad and varied types of

13

interpretive authority to the agency.

14

In particular, in 19 U.S.C. 1502, Congress

15

provided that the agency could adopt rules and regulations

16

for the classifications of goods under the tariff

17

schedules, and it was under that provision that this Court

18

applied Chevron and Haggar to say that reasonable

19

interpretations of ambiguous provisions set forth in

20

regulations should be applied by the courts.

21

Now, Congress understood, however, that the

22

regulations alone would not be sufficient to address the

23

infinite myriad of small interpretive problems that arise

24

under this kind of tariff legislation, and so Congress

25

specified and gave authority to the agency to adopt

1

binding interpretive rules for the purpose of applying the

2

statute in these discrete situations.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, there is kind of a curious

4

feature.

As I understand it, if a case on a tariff ruling

5

were to go to the Court of International Trade --

6

MR. JONES:

7

QUESTION:

8
9

Yes.
-- as I understand it, it engages in

de novo review of the classification rulings?
MR. JONES:

I think the -- we have used that

10

expressing in describing it --

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. JONES:

Yes.
-- but as the Court pointed out in

13

Haggar, and as we have argued in these two cases, what

14

really happens is there is a de novo fact-finding on the

15

record made in the Court of International Trade.

16

QUESTION:

Do you think that court affords some

17

kind of deference to the views of the customs service, and

18

would it be some kind of deference to the ruling such as

19

we have here?

20

MR. JONES:

Well, Haggar also pointed out that

21

what the court does is, in determining what the law is

22

that it applies these facts to, it looks to the agency's

23

interpretations, and we think it should look to the

24

agency's rulings.

25

QUESTION:

That's -And you think that's clear?

And what kind of deference to do they

Is it Chevron, or something less --

4

6

Yes.

Well, what they have --- such as so-called Skidmore, and

what are you urging us is the proper rule?
MR. JONES:

Our -- what we are urging you is

8

that it is the deference that the Court described in

9

Chevron, that is that you -- that the Court is to defer to

10

the reasonable interpretations set forth in these binding

11

rulings, and what -- in the NationsBank v. Variable

12

Annuity case the Court described these as a deliberative

13

conclusions set forth in the agency's interpretations.

14

QUESTION:

But not adopted after notice and

15

comment, and so is there some lesser kind of deference,

16

such as suggested in the Skidmore case?

17

MR. JONES:

Not in this context.

I mean, let me

18

point out that when we're talking about interpretive

19

rulings they are routinely initiated by the importer

20

themselves.

21

comments on how they think this procedure should be -- how

22

that statute should be interpreted, and when the agency --

23

if the agency adopts that interpretation and then some

24

other importer doesn't agree and they want to ask for a

25

different ruling, they can submit and request an

interpretive ruling, and that's what's --

2

QUESTION:

How does this differ from the Labor

3

Department ruling in Christiansen, which we said was not

4

entitled to Chevron deference?

5

MR. JONES:

In Christiansen the Court said that

6

there was an informal opinion stated in a format that

7

Congress had not provided for official interpretations.

8

Here, we have a formal provision of Congress directing the

9

agency to make these kinds of interpretive determinations

10

and to make them in a binding way.

11

QUESTION:

It was dictum in Christiansen anyway,

12

wasn't it?

13

reasonable interpretation?

14

Didn't the Court find that it wasn't a

MR. JONES:

I believe that's correct.

The Court

15

concluded that it was not, in the words of Skidmore,

16

entitled to any consideration because it wasn't

17

persuasive, but I -- clearly the Court was of the view

18

that it was not a reasonable interpretation, and --

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, could we just back up a

20

bit?

Your answer to Justice O'Connor about the Court of

21

International Trade owing some deference --

22

MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- to the customs rulings, as far as

24

I recall, in this very case, although the Court of

25

International Trade upheld the customs classification,

1

there wasn't one word that they said, so we don't know

2

from this case what position the Court of International

3

Trade takes on this question.

4

MR. JONES:

Well, historically we know the court

5

said that it would defer to reasonable interpretations of

6

the service, but in this -- you're very right about the

7

oddity of the specific issue, the way it came up, and we

8

addressed that at the petition stage.

9

What happened was that when Haggar was before

10

this Court, the United States did not press the lower

11

court to apply what is now to be called Haggar or Chevron

12

deference because the Federal Circuit had said in Haggar

13

that it would give no weight to customs service

14

interpretations, and so at the time the case was in the

15

Court of International Trade, that court was not asked to

16

give that type of deference to the agency's

17

interpretation --

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. JONES:

20

But the --- because that was the law of the

circuit.

21

Once this Court reversed the circuit ruling in

22

Haggar, this -- the Federal Circuit then addressed how the

23

principles of Haggar and Chevron applied.

1

MR. JONES:

In the Federal Circuit, but I would

2

point out that respondent has agreed, and we think it's

3

clear that the Court of International Trade applied the

4

same definition of bound diary that the ruling sets forth.

5

QUESTION:

May I ask you before we get to the

6

specific ruling, you're asserting that there should be

7

deference equivalent to Chevron deference.

8

MR. JONES:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.
And yet, as I understand it, there

10

are two features of this that would lead me to hesitate

11

about that.

12

rulings, as I understand it, are just you'll classify

13

this,

14

and the other is that you don't have one decisionmaker, as

15

you would have, say, for the EPA.

16

decisions that are dispersed among 45 ports of entry.

17

One is that the vast majority of these

you'll classify that, with no reasons elaborated,

MR. JONES:

Instead, you have

Well, let me address the second

18

point first.

I think in Smiley v. Citibank the Court had

19

a similar situation where there was a subsidiary

20

determination that was then reviewed by the headquarters

21

office to result in a final agency determination, which is

22

the process that we've gone through with respect to these

23

rulings, and the Court said, well, that doesn't result in

24

a change of view, it results in a proper application of

25

the agency's ruling process.

1

With respect to the first point, the respondent

2

says, well, there are 10,000 a year of these kinds of

3

rulings made in the head -- in the regional offices.

4

fact, we do not claim that there's -- we are unaware of

5

any of those rulings in which there would be what the

6

Court, in the opinion you authored for the Court in the

7

Variable Annuity case call the deliberative conclusions.

8

It is only the deliberative conclusions that set forth the

9

actual interpretations of provisions that the Court can

10

look to to defer to.

It's not simply the result.

And in most of the simple tariff entry at issue

12

determinations, of course it's a very simplified

13

procedure.

14

transactions at issue, and those kinds of entry-level port

15

determinations are very simple, and the Trade Bar

every instance no discussion.

QUESTION:

And you'd say that any ruling by the

MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

That is correct.

To the extent --

But not the rulings that come out of

11

the field and are not reviewed.

12

MR. JONES:

As a practical matter, that's true,

13

but I would say that either of them would be entitled to

14

deference to the extent they contain deliberative

15

conclusions, and I'm just being finicky about that because

16

as a practical matter the entry-level port determinations

17

don't contain those kinds of --

18

QUESTION:

Why is that?

I mean, if it comes out

19

of headquarters it's obviously been considered at a high

20

level within the agency and they say, this is the answer.

21

Why should --

MR. JONES:

I think as a practical matter the

23

agency would have no objection to a determination of that

type.

by which the Court would reach such a determination.

It's just, all I'm addressing is the logical basis

QUESTION:

Well, but I mean, if we're going to

2

use that criteria -- you see, I thought Chevron was just,

3

if it's an authoritative agency position we defer to it,

4

but if you're going to hang qualifications on that, that

5

is, it has to be an authoritative agency position that is

6

explicated in written opinion, you might as well add the

7

fillips that your brother suggests, which is only those

8

rulings that are the product of formal rulemaking.

9

one is as logical to me as the other.

10

MR. JONES:

The

Well, the -- I'm not -- I think what

11

I'm trying to describe and not doing a very good job at it

12

is simply that it's up to what -- the ultimate question is

13

what did Congress intend?

14

agency to function?

How did Congress intend the

15

The best evidence of that is probably the

16

agency's regulations pursuant to the authority that

17

Congress gave the agency to provide for a binding ruling

18

program.

19

service's rulings are precedential and binding, but they

20

don't go on to say, because it's up to this Court to say,

21

the extent to which those precedential binding

22

determinations are to be given deference by the courts,

23

and all I was trying to say was that it seems to me that

24

when this Court has addressed interpretive rulings in

25

prior cases, like Variable Annuity, PBGC v. LTC, it has

looked to the question of whether the -- you can look to

Well --- and find in it a reasoned -Well, you say that Christiansen was

not an interpretive ruling?
MR. JONES:

Not in the sense that we're using

that term in this case.

What Christiansen was was the

private correspondence that was sent --

QUESTION:

12

MR. JONES:

13

Well, private correspondence by the

Well, actually it was sent by the

Wage & Hour Division of the Labor Department.
QUESTION:

Okay, but you wouldn't call that --

those people are paid by the Government.
MR. JONES:

Right, but what the -- but I think

17

what this -- the Court's concern in Christiansen was that

18

there was no evidence that that was an official

19

interpretation of the type that Congress had authorized

20

the agency to use to interpret the statute.

21

Here, we have a statute that expressly tells the

22

agency to make these kinds of binding determinations, and

23

the agency's done it just the way Congress said.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, could you go back for a second

on that to the first question that Justice O'Connor put to

you, and she said there's a statute that says, in effect,

2

that the Court of International Trade is to review these

3

things de novo, to which you replied no, it's just

4

reviewing matters of fact.

5

MR. JONES:

Yes.

6

QUESTION:

7

nothing about matters of fact.

8

of International Trade shall make its determinations upon

9

the basis of the record before the court.

But my copy of the statute says
What it says is, the Court

The importers

10

tell us, the textile importers tell us there's hardly ever

11

a dispute of fact.

12

You know, this is what it is.

Everybody knows

13

that, that almost all these things concern how you apply a

14

tariff or -- to the facts and the Customs Trade Bar tells

15

us that if we set down the distinction you want to make

16

between facts and application of the tariff, this whole

17

thing's unworkable, because people would never be able to

18

figure out, or hardly ever, what's going on, which is

19

which.

20

that Justice O'Connor's initial characterization was right

21

as opposed to the application of these tariffs, and I'd

22

like you to respond to that.

23

So that would seem to be a pretty strong argument

MR. JONES:

The function of the interpretive

24

binding ruling program is to make the system more workable

25

by providing effective advanced guidance.

1

QUESTION:

They didn't say that was unworkable.

2

What they said would be unworkable would be for the Court

3

of International Trade to figure out, you know, is it a

4

question of fact, is it a determination of application of

5

the tariff, et cetera.

6

MR. JONES:

It's -- this -- I believe the Court

7

has already addressed this very point in the Haggar case.

8

Chevron deference is about how you decide what the law is.

9

There are other doctrines, burden of proof, presumption of

10

regularity, that go to about how you decide what facts are

11

and how the facts apply to law.

12

Chevron is simply a doctrine about how does a

13

court decide what the law is, and in this case the agency

14

made a determination about legal issues and said what it

15

believed a diary was, for example, or what it believed the

16

law, properly interpreted was, bound for this purpose is.

17

Having made that legal determination, it's then

18

up to the Court of International Trade to decide whether

19

these facts represent such an item.

20

agency's binding rulings state its own view of what the

21

facts are and how they apply to these legal

22

interpretations, but that's what the Court of

23

International Trade has the right to do de novo, to decide

24

whether these facts fit within the legal determination,

25

the legal interpretation that the agency has expressed in

Of course, the

QUESTION:

Suppose we were to hold --

MR. JONES:

It's just like tax cases.

4

QUESTION:

Suppose we were to hold that Chevron

5

deference applies to regulations that are adopted under

6

the EPA with notice and comment, and that this does not

7

qualify, but that this ruling, or this determination gets

8

a Skidmore deference.

9

Do you think that the courts would find that

10

that's a meaningful difference?

Because if we -- if you had the sort

of sliding scale approach of the Skidmore doctrine, then

know, how much -- how effective the agency's

approach, if you needed to look at it in a practical

Now, I would like to point out that this Court

Okay.
In one of your earlier responses,

12

oh, no, Skidmore deference would be inappropriate.

fallback position, if we say, no Chevron deference, I

14

assume you would urge some sort of Skidmore --

15

MR. JONES:

As a

I would assume that if the Court

16

were to conclude that Chevron deference didn't apply it

17

would then conclude Skidmore was an appropriate formula to

look at this issue under.

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, you said something very

2

quickly, but I wanted to be sure I understood your

3

position about tax rulings, revenue rulings.

4

MR. JONES:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.
How do they compare to customs

6

classifications, and if you could just -- probably you

7

made this clear already.

8

for just stamped, this, that.

9

MR. JONES:

10

QUESTION:

You are not claiming deference

That's right.
It's only when we have a reasoned

11

decision as we do in this case.

12

MR. JONES:

Right.

Okay.

With respect to revenue

13

rulings, the history on this is sort of interesting, and

14

it'll take me a minute to explain it all.

15

States v. Correll, this Court held that revenue rulings

16

should be upheld when they're reasonable, and the Court

17

emphasized that it was based on the expertise of the

18

agency and the fact, to quote the Court, that it doesn't

19

sit as a committee of revision to perfect the

20

administration of the tax laws.

21

agency to do that by authorizing it to issue all necessary

22

rules and regs.

23

In United

The Congress told the

Now, the tax counsel amici says no, that case

24

was really about a regulation, not about a ruling.

25

that's simply and flatly, clearly wrong.

Well,

The regulation

1

they cite had something to do with the procedures as used

2

to make a claim for a deduction.

3

When Justice Marshall was Solicitor General, he

4

filed the Government's brief in the Correll case.

5

successor, Solicitor General Griswold, filed a reply

6

brief.

7

They rely just on the revenue ruling of the service and

8

ask the Court to defer to it, which is what Justice

9

Stewart's opinion for the Court said was appropriate.

Neither of those briefs mention any regulation.

11

QUESTION:

MR. JONES:

13

QUESTION:

15

But that was pre-Chevron, so we don't

know --

12

14

His

Yes.
-- exactly what they meant by

deference.
MR. JONES:

Well, we know exactly what they

16

meant, if we -- I mean, reading the opinion it says that

17

the agency's reasonable interpretation should be accepted.

18

It was a pre-Chevron Chevron case.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

Well, have we addressed this issue

post-Chevron?
MR. JONES:

That's where it became confusing,

22

and there's a nomenclature shift that occurred that really

23

hasn't been addressed.

24

two kinds of rulings.

25

1

rulings that were published in what's called the

2

Cumulative Bulletin.

3

The Cumulative Bulletin pointed out before 1960

4

that the Commissioner's rulings were not approved by the

5

Secretary, therefore they weren't binding on the agency.

6

In 1961, the Commissioner was given interpretive

7

authority in a regulation we've cited in our brief, and

8

that interpretive authority is subject, however, to the

9

approval of the Secretary, and since that time, what are

10

now called Revenue Rules, with a capital R, are issued by

11

the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary.

12

They are functionally the same as Treasury

13

decisions were before 1960, and in the cases before 1960

14

the Court had pointed out Treasury decisions were entitled

15

to substantial deference, and even in Skidmore the Court

16

pointed out they were often decisive.

17

After Correll -- I'm sorry.

After Correll and

18

indeed, I think after Chevron, but in any event in that

19

time frame, Justice Marshall wrote an opinion for the

20

Court, bringing this full circle, in which he said that a

21

Treasury decision issued in connection with a customs

22

ruling should be given -- should be accepted if it's

23

reasonably -- if it's sufficiently reasonable.

24

way -- that's why I pointed out that revenue rulings and

25

Treasury decisions and customs interpretive rulings have

QUESTION:

But here we're -- we get back to

something you've already talked about, which is a little

curious.

MR. JONES:

There isn't an interpretation stated

simply says an apple's an apple.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, could I ask just one

20

clarifying question?

I'm having difficulty drawing the

21

line between what it is the international court has to do

22

de novo and what is entitled to deference, and I thought

23

you said that they're entitled to deference if they're

MR. JONES:

Isn't that what they always do?
But they -- to make that second

20

step, they have to know what the law is and all -- and

21

what Haggar said and what we think is clear in Chevron

cases generally, is that in deciding what the law is the

Court should defer to the agency's reasonable

interpretations.

They're supposed to decide whether

-- constitutes a bound diary, and in

deciding whether it's a bound diary, they have to know

by pointing out that the -- here's the way it worked in

Now, what the court of appeals said was, well,

we think that -- we want to add two things to that.

it has to be retrospective, but the diary definition

usage is inconsistent with that.

-- why wouldn't a judgment that's

into court, presumably the agency at a high level decides

that this ruling, made out in the field, ought to be

By comparison, the headquarters rulings are

3

thorough, they provide a definite description of the text,

4

and internally the agency has advised its regional offices

5

to not include a full discussion of text, and I'm going

6

outside the record, but I have to answer your question,

7

and internally the understanding is that if the issue is

8

complicated enough it will get referred to the

9

headquarters.

10

Now, that doesn't mean that complicated issues

aren't resolved at the field office, but it does mean that

QUESTION:

points about the deference that the agency itself gives to

that Justice Souter just asked, and that is, may it be

As the record reflects, in June of 1991 they

classified this day planner as a unbound diary, duty free.

3

In 1993, without notice, without any further proceeding, a

that classification had been changed.

With no waiting period?

7

MR. COLL:

No.

8

QUESTION:

So that the very day of the notice,

it became dutiable?

10

MR. COLL:

We --

We had the opportunity, which we took

11

advantage of, which was to get a detrimental reliance

12

letter from the customs service that said to the effect

13

that those imports that were in process we were able to

14

rely on the previous ruling, on the previous

15

classification ruling, but that we could not rely in the

16

future, so that the first revocation allowed us to take

It was not in force at

There was -- there's a second notice provision

that has been raised by the Government in its brief, and

10

that relates to change in practice, but this was not a

change in practice, either, as the courts have defined

QUESTION:

Now --

Now, with respect -- with respect to

not certain that it is even in effect any longer because

of the way the rule -- because of the way the service runs

that there's a second sentence that says, if you want to

MR. COLL:

No, I don't believe it does.

The

problem here, as I see it, to ask for Chevron deference,

5

which I view as mandatory, controlling weight deference,

rather than Skidmore deference --

QUESTION:

Well, on that point, Mr. Coll, this

Court had a holding in NationsBank v. Variable Annuity

9

Life Insurance where we held that a letter ruling by the

10

Comptroller of the Currency warranted Chevron deference.

11

How is this different?

12

MR. COLL:

Well, I would focus on the question

13

in that case as posed by Justice Ginsburg, which said, may

14

or can national banks in the United States sell variable

15

annuities, question mark, and that was -- as I understood

that question, viewed by this Court, that ruling was now

going to be applicable to every national bank in the

United States and as I've just discussed --

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose that we can assume

20

that the customs service made clear that it thought that

anything like a filofax here with the little entry spaces

MR. COLL:

MR. COLL:

Well, we don't know that under the

they tell us similar articles, or identical articles or

similar circumstances, and therefore they hedge that

relative to every importer who comes to a dock --

is, I could imagine -- it's all hypothetical -- being a

Well --

And I'd like to hear both the answer

to that question and something about the statute.

12

MR. COLL:

Well, I'd like to go to what Congress

13

may have said with regard to whether or not the customs

14

service should be binding, and we looked to the

15

legislative history in 1979 with regard to de novo review,

and that legislative history said, in light of the Zenith

deference would be inappropriate.

QUESTION:

To --

I don't understand.

What is the

8

criterion for just saying we're going to give deference

9

to, you know, formerly adopted regulations?

I can

10

understand a criterion that tries to assess whether the

11

agency's view that has been expressed is authoritative,

12

but surely the agency's view on this issue has been

13

authoritatively expressed in this case by the Solicitor

14

General.

15

I mean, we know that the agency believes that

16

this is what the law says.

17

sort of deference if the agency tell us that in a

18

regulation with notice and comment and another kind of

19

deference if it comes to us in some other fashion?

20

long as it's the agency's authoritative view, what

21

difference should it make?

22

MR. COLL:

Now, why should we give one

So

Well, that question, as I would

23

understand it, starts from the premise that we're going to

somehow narrow this field of classification rulings from

the 10 to 15,000 that issue each year to some smaller

group that purportedly are qualitatively better, certainly

2

quantitatively less, and if that's the case, then I think

3

we also need to not lose sight of the fact that these are

4

mixed conclusions of fact and law, even when articulated.

5

And for example, in our particular ruling, the

6

third ruling, the one that I assume the Solicitor General

7

says that the deference to attach -- should attach to, not

8

the earlier ones, the last.

9

There, the -- Mr. Durant, who was the fellow who

10

exercised that discretion, that interpretation, and who

11

signed that letter, says that he has reached his

12

interpretation on the basis of factual analysis, ex parte

13

factual analysis, ex parte to anything that this importer

14

had an opportunity to respond to.

15

It says -- this is at 32a of -- it begins at the

16

bottom of 31a.

It's 32a in the petition for the writ of

certiorari, and it says, the rationale for this

determination was based on lexicographic sources as well

19

as extrinsic evidence of how these types of articles are

20

treated in the trade and commerce of the United States.

21

Now, that record was made --

QUESTION:

Mr. Coll, does that get a presumption

of deference -- of correctness?

That's the other piece of

this statute, that this Court of International Trade is

correctness, is that right, and that's statutory?

2

MR. COLL:

That's correct, and it's as to facts,

3

and it's part of the process.

4

QUESTION:

I mean, this process --

You're getting into the same problem

5

that we have in discussing this with Mr. Jones, what is

fact as opposed to law in these customs classifications?

MR. COLL:

Exactly.

QUESTION:

Well, gee, I don't think that -- you

What we have here --

say, was based on lexicographic sources.

I assume he's

talking about dictionaries.
Now, I guess you can say it is a question of

12

fact whether dictionaries say this or that.

I mean,

13

everything in the world is a question of fact, but when we

issue a ruling on a point of law that relies in part on

15

dictionaries, I don't consider that a mixed -- a ruling on

a mixed question of fact and law, did the dictionary say

this and is it accurate that that produces this result.

we talk Chevron deference, we talk about the Haggar case,

that you should be arguing, then, not that all these

MR. COLL:

That goes to the second question that

of reasons.

QUESTION:

Mr. Coll you were --

QUESTION:

Do you accept what Justice Scalia

thought the difference between this and Smiley is, here

11

there is a specific statute, and that statue says that the

Now, the Government says that that word,

determinations, means simply matters of fact, not matters

of whether, given agreement about the facts, this is a

bound or unbound thing for purposes of the tariff.

disagreeing with Haggar in your answer to Justice Breyer.
MR. COLL:
Your Honor.

Haggar is a much different situation,

Haggar arose when Congress passed a

10

particular provision of the tariff schedule that left a

11

gap to be filled, and they delegated that filling of the

12

gap, specific gap to the customs service.

13

incidental to assembly outside of the United States, and

14

it listed such as, it left obvious gaps for filling.

15

It was matters

had a regulation promulgated that furthered that

definition.

and this Court found that that created normal law similar

to a statute.

it -- the promulgation of the regulation, notice and

6

It impacted it in that there was no

Now we had -- the question that remained was

what had occurred outside of the United States, and did

that fall within that language, so that now we were

focused, as I understand this Court's direction, on that

fact, what was happening outside the United States, and

11

does it fit into that articulated definition in the

12

regulation.

QUESTION:

Mr. Coll, let me approach this from a

different vantage point.

QUESTION:

So I would have thought, then, if you

apply Chevron deference that's the end of the case for

9

you.

10

MR. COLL:

Well, their interpretation is

11

predicated upon one provision, an explanatory note that

12

isn't applicable at that level of the tariff schedule,

13

which doesn't relate to whether or not things are bound.

14

It relates to what things are made of.

15

The schedule, this particular provision, this

16

particular chapter, 4820, relates to paper, and what this

17

explanatory note says, if things come with packaging that

18

has metal, leather, et cetera, they will still be

19

classified as paper that the other substance, the other

20

material will not predominate.

21

has to be held together in some fashion, because the

chapter note says that these -- this provision does not

cover loose sheets, so everything has to be --

Maybe there's an easy answer to it.
You talked about the provision that says, de

presumption of correctness.

Those two seem to be at

Why are they not?

You told me that the facts found by customs get

MR. COLL:

On the other hand, the

of correctness, then the burden is slightly different on

12

the plaintiff, the importer, than it might otherwise be,

13

that he has a presumption that is working against him, and

14

it's a burden of proof.

15

It's a matter that because there's a presumption

It doesn't relate to deference.

But focusing on chapter 4820 and why this is not

16

appropriate interpretation and would be unreasonable even

17

under Chevron, though we don't believe Chevron applies,

18

the statute is fairly clear.

there are diaries, and there are similar articles, and

then breaks it down further to diaries bound in all these

other items that would be similar articles.

within the diary category is that it's not adapted for

5

It's a schedule.

But in the statute itself, which you quote on

term refers to diaries.

respect to either recording past events or noting future

If we don't engage in the ellipsis that you did

bearing on what a diary is, your argument is considerably

weaker, isn't it?

this point in time to customs practitioners, who tell me

that you cannot look in a classification as to this

statute becomes progressively more detailed, it becomes

progressively more indicative of what it may have in mind

by similar articles, and it seems to me that by the

QUESTION:

Do you think that this statute would

2

be very important in another case, insofar as whether or

3

not these rulings are -- should be accorded Chevron

deference because they're very much like a regulation, or

5

do you think both cases, a case arising under this statute

6

and your case, should be dealt with the same?

7

MR. COLL:

I think it enhances part of their

8

argument.

It does not enhance their whole case, because I

9

believe that it does not enhance the particular point,

10

which is that these are conclusions of fact and law as to

11

which one cannot dissect neatly those interpretive legal

12

norms that would be required for Chevron deference.

13

But in terms of process, in terms of notice, in

14

terms of procedural regularity, it certainly is better

than receiving a letter in the mail 2 years after you've

gotten a classification ruling telling you that the

We have a legislative regulation there and as I

understand the Court, the Court was trying to explain how

those two elements, a statutory regulation that creates a

legal norm, would -- could still be harmonized with the de

that it was to assemble the record and make factual

determinations and apply those facts to the law, but in --

the Court said that deference can be given to the

7

regulations without impairing the authority of the court

8

to make factual determinations and to apply those

determinations to the law de novo.

And what the Court said in Haggar was that the

deliberative analysis to find out what the agency's
