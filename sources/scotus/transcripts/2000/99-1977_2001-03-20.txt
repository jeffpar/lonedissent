ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

We'll hear argument

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Qualified immunity has an important role to play

11

in Fourth Amendment unreasonable force cases just as it

12

does in Fourth Amendment unreasonable search cases and in

13

other constitutional contexts.

14

effectively merged the qualified immunity and Fourth

15

Amendment tests in the case of unreasonable force cases.

16

The court reasoned that because both tests are framed in

17

terms of objective reasonableness, the qualified immunity

18

test had nothing to add to the underlying Fourth Amendment

19

test.

20

line of reasoning in Anderson against Creighton and with

21

good reason.

22

The decision below

This Court rejected a virtually indistinguishable

The Fourth Amendment and qualified immunity

23

tests are distinct and serve different purposes.

at the preexisting law and asks whether that preexisting

3

law would have put a reasonable officer on notice that his

5

recognizes that even competent officers will make

6

reasonable mistakes and government officials should not be

7

held personally liable when they make reasonable judgment

8

calls just because their judgment turns out to be

9

mistaken.

10

The qualified immunity test by contrast looks

QUESTION:

Qualified immunity thus

Could you tell me how the test works?

11

I take it qualified immunity is presented initially to the

12

trial judge as a basis for dismissing and then if he

13

rules, is the jury also instructed about qualified

14

immunity?

15

MR. CLEMENT:

Well in many cases, once the case

16

is -- the issue of qualified immunity is brought before

17

the judge, the judge can rule on whether there's a

18

qualified immunity protection in the case and there'll be

19

no issue that needs to go to the jury in that case.

20

QUESTION:

Now suppose he overrules the

21

qualified immunity defense, does the jury then determine

22

both qualified immunity and, in this case, whether or not

23

the force was reasonable?

24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

It would depend on the

circumstances of the case.

In some cases, the judge may

1

want to try to isolate the factual issues that are at

2

stake in the qualified immunity context and just have the

3

jury focusing on those factual situations.

4

QUESTION:

In other words, a bifurcated trial.

5

MR. CLEMENT:

Well that may actually end up

6

being the only issue that jury really needs to focus on.

7

If I could give you an example, in a recent Tenth Circuit

8

case called Cruz against City of Laramie, the Tenth

9

Circuit decided that the use of a hog-tie restraint was

10

unreasonable when used with an individual who exhibited

11

signs of diminished capacity.

12

reserved the question about whether that restraint was

13

unreasonable when used on an individual who did not

14

exhibit signs of diminished capacity.

15

QUESTION:

In that same opinion, they

I mean the reason I'm asking is that,

16

if the jury hears both questions, I want to know what the

17

instructions sound like, and whether or not the jury can

18

make this distinction.

19

MR. CLEMENT:

In many cases, I think the jury

20

will not really, if there's no liability -- I'm sorry, if

21

there's no issue about injunctive relief, it may just be a

22

situation where the court can simply decide what the

23

clearly-established law is and instruct the jury on that

24

clearly-established law and then the jury can make its

25

determination.

1

To pick up the example from the Tenth Circuit

2

case, if in a subsequent decision, the Tenth Circuit

3

extended its rule and applied the rule to all individuals,

4

saying the hog-tie restraint is never reasonable, I think

5

because the court had previously expressly reserved the

6

question of whether the hog-tie restraint was reasonable

7

when applied to an individual who did not exhibit signs of

8

diminished capacity.

9

would be whether or not the individual who was arrested

In that case, the issue for the jury

10

exhibited signs of diminished capacity and that would

11

really be the only issue the jury needed to decide because

12

if the individual had exhibited signs of diminished

13

capacity, under the court's prior decision in Cruz, that

14

-- that conduct would be not only unlawful but clearly

15

established.

16

On the other hand, if the jury decided that the

17

individual had not exhibited signs of diminished capacity,

18

then in that instance, although the conduct was unlawful,

19

by virtue of this hypothetical second decision, the

20

conduct would not be clearly established and there'd be no

21

liability in that situation.

22

QUESTION:

So you're saying the only situation

23

in which the two increase in effect will be exactly the

24

same, is the situation in which the general standard has,

25

by course of judicial decision, been reduced down to a

precisely the same result necessarily.

And in the case in which immunity is

That's the only I case, I take it on your

MR. CLEMENT:

I disagree.

I think that in

Anderson against Creighton itself, this Court noted that

10

there's not a requirement that the previous case law be on

11

all four --

12

QUESTION:

Oh, I'm not saying that there is a

13

requirement, but I'm saying that, if in fact the previous

14

case law has got to the pinpoint stage and the facts

15

claimed by way of defense precisely fall within that

16

pinpoint, then the two increase will not be different, but

17

that's the only case I take in which that will be true on

18

your view.

19

MR. CLEMENT:

I'm not sure if that's the only

20

case where that's going to be true.

21

cases where the preexisting law, although not showing the

22

way with pinpoint accuracy, it still provides the officers

23

with sufficiently clear notice that there's no real rule

24

for qualified immunity in those particular cases.

gave us, what would be the -- suppose the judge thinks, I

don't want to decide the qualified immunity myself because

3

I think there's some fact questions involved about what

happened here.

wants to charge the jury so they'll understand the

difference between excessive force that violates the

7

Fourth Amendment and qualified immunity.

8

9

MR. CLEMENT:

So let's take this very case and the judge

How would the

I think the judge in this case

10

would charge by using the language from this Court's

11

previous qualified immunity opinions, language from cases

12

like Malley and Hunter against Bryant and would charge the

13

jury with finding -- in order to find liability in this

14

case, the jury would have to find that the individual

15

officer exhibited -- either was plainly incompetent or

16

exercised judgment that was outside the range of

17

professional judgment.

18

necessary in a case where the only issue is liability to

19

really direct the court's attention a great deal to the

20

liability standard because that issue's going to

21

effectively drop out of the case.

I'm not sure it would really be

22

To be sure, the jury may need to be instructed

23

on what the relevant law of excessive force is, but once

that instruction is put in place as sort a background

follow that.

9

Now you say, ordinarily the -- something

MR. CLEMENT:

All I meant by that is that since

10

there will be no liability imposed in the ordinary case

11

without a finding that the officer's not entitled to

12

qualified immunity, it'll be the qualified immunity

13

question that will really be the ultimate focus of the

14

jury's attention because that'll determine whether or not

15

they find sufficient cause to award damages.

16

QUESTION:

But if -- then the jury, if a jury

17

decides that there is not qualified immunity then they

18

have to go further, do they not?

I don't believe so.

No, I'm sorry

you're right.

don't know that they really need to go further because

telling us they don't have to and that seems to be

inconsistent with your position that there are two tests.

MR. CLEMENT:

I'm not sure how the jury

No, all I'm saying is that in the

ordinary case --

QUESTION:

That's the trouble I'm having and I

think was at the root of Justice Ginsburg's question as

well.

10

MR. CLEMENT:

I'm sorry.

I think -- perhaps my

11

focusing on the cases that go to the jury, we're obscuring

12

the fact that the real virtue of qualified immunity is in

13

many of these cases, even under the plaintiff's versions

14

of events, the conduct will not be so clearly

15

unconstitutional by virtue of higher precedent that the

16

court can just end there.

17

And after all, as this Court emphasized in

18

Harlow against Fitzgerald and subsequent cases, the

19

qualified immunity is not just an immunity from liability,

20

but it protects the officers from the chilling effect of

21

the inconvenience of having to stand trial in those

22

situations where prior decisions have not clearly marked

23

the individual's conduct as being unlawful.

have to be submitted to the jury, won't they?

2

let's say in the present case, if there's a dispute as to

3

whether more force was used than was necessary, the jury

would have to determine whether more force was used than

was necessary.

that is the case, was that use of excessive force so

Wouldn't both questions

MR. CLEMENT:

I think both questions certainly

12

could go to the jury.

13

question actually entails the answer to the first.

14

the jury's instructed and finds that the officer's conduct

15

was so excessive as to put it outside the range of the

16

conduct of a reasonable officer under the circumstances it

17

would necessarily entail a finding in liability.

18

It just seems to me that the second
So if

And because by hypothesis I'm talking about a

case where all the individual plaintiff seeks is monetary

officer might have thought was okay.

MR. CLEMENT:

That's right.

Nothing will turn

on the underlying constitutional issue because it's --

QUESTION:

Justice Scalia may see what you mean,

but I'm not sure I do.

jury with respect -- does he tell the jury, first go to

8

qualified immunity or first go to constitutional

violation?

10

MR. CLEMENT:

Tell me how the judge charges the

I guess what I'm envisioning is

11

that the jury would first be instructed on what the law is

12

of excessive force based largely on this Court's decision

13

in Graham against Connor.

14

instructions, the Court would focus in on what it is the

15

jury needs to find in order to find liability and impose

16

liability on the officer.

17

QUESTION:

Then at the end of the

Can you give my just a quick sample

18

instruction rather than this kind of theoretical

19

description?

20

MR. CLEMENT:

Sure.

I think the instruction, I

21

mean the instruction that the Government typically uses in

22

these cases or typically offers in these cases, is based

23

on this Court's decision in Malley and Hunter against

24

Bryant and it asks the jury whether or not the officer's

conduct was such that it was plainly incompetent under the

1

circumstances and the use of force was outside the range

2

of professional and competent judgment.

3

-- that's the question that jury ultimately focuses on.

4
5

QUESTION:

And then the jury

And that's the Fourth Amendment

question?

6

MR. CLEMENT:

No, that's the qualified immunity

7

question because that's what makes the difference between

8

whether the jury in a specific case imposes damages or

9

doesn't impose damages.

10

QUESTION:

Tell me then, what is the difference

11

between the Fourth Amendment question and the qualified

12

immunity question?

13

MR. CLEMENT:

The difference is -- well there's

14

a couple of ways of expressing it, one way to express it

15

is that the Fourth Amendment test looks only at the

16

conduct and asks whether the force used was unreasonable.

17

The qualified immunity test takes a broader look at what

18

the preexisting law was and asks whether the officer was

19

on notice that his or conduct violated clearly-established

20

law.

21

Another way of looking at is that the question

22

in the first case is simply, looking at what the officer

23

did, was what the officer did reasonable?

24
25

QUESTION:

Let me ask, in the context of this

very case, the officer sought summary judgment on the

MR. CLEMENT:

QUESTION:

Right?

That's correct.

And the Court denied it.
That's also correct.

So in this case, then did that

10

MR. CLEMENT:

No, I mean -- and I think that

11

raises two important points.

what issue goes to the jury and how does the underlying

the second point, which is this would be a particularly

judge should have granted summary judgment to the officer,

2

is that it?

3

MR. CLEMENT:

4

QUESTION:

That's exactly right.

And so we don't get beyond all these

5

other things.

In your view the error was in denying

6

summary judgment on qualified immunity?

7

MR. CLEMENT:

8

QUESTION:

9
10
11

That's exactly right.

Now was there a factual component to

that issue that makes it impossible for the trial judge to
determine or could there be?
MR. CLEMENT:

Certainly not in our view.

I

12

mean, our view you can take every fact in this case in the

13

light most favorable to the plaintiff and the proper

14

analysis should still be that the Petitioner was entitled

15

to qualified immunity.

16

simply refused to undertake that analysis because they

17

thought the two standards were effectively merged.

18

QUESTION:

And the Court of Appeals below

It's that last bit.

Sorry, that last

19

bit that I'm confused on, why isn't it the same standard?

20

I was just listening to the answer and I agree that in

21

Anderson v. Creighton it isn't, but in Anderson v.

22

Creighton the underlying constitutional standard is what

23

society thinks is reasonable, basically.

24

underlying constitutional standard is what an officer

thinks is reasonable and since it's what a reasonable

Here the

officer thinks is excessive, they become the same

standard.

3

so.

That's just a coincidence, but it happens to be

4

That is, I don't see how -- think of an example.

5

Can you think of a single example in which you're prepared

6

to say it is excessive force.

7

i.e., an officer, a reasonable officer would have known it

8

is excessive because otherwise it isn't excessive force.

9

And you're prepared to say it is excessive force, but

It is excessive force,

10

you'd also say he has qualified immunity, i.e., a

11

reasonable officer couldn't have been expected to know it

12

was excessive.

That's logically impossible.

13

MR. CLEMENT:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

With all respect, I --

Now so give me an example as a test,

as a test.
MR. CLEMENT:

First of all, an example would be

17

in the Tenth Circuit situation where the court finds in

18

the same case that the hog-tie restraint when applied to

19

someone who's exhibited signs of diminished capacity is

20

unreasonable.

21

QUESTION:

It is unreasonable, i.e., an officer,

22

an officer they are saying, a police officer, should have

23

know that that force was excessive.

24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

No, the should have known aspect

of the test is precisely what qualified immunity adds.

QUESTION:

And if a reasonable officer, if a

reasonable officer, looking at the situation would have

thought it was not unreasonable, then is it excessive?

from the perspective of the reasonable officer and it

QUESTION:

The officer may still

That simply means I think that, if

6

you have a very general -- if your Fourth Amendment

standard has never been rendered anything but general in

formulation, then there is a greater possibility, there is

9

a possibility for disagreement about the application of

10

that standard to specific fact circumstances.

11

isn't the relationship between the two inquiries this, if

12

the first standard, the Fourth Amendment standard has

13

never been stated by the courts, except in general terms,

14

then probably there will be room for some reasonable

15

disagreement about its application.

16

And so

You're saying in this case the Graham and Connor

17

standard is at a pretty high level of generality and

18

therefore you can charge a jury on the Graham and Connor

19

standard and they'll decide whether in their judgment the

20

officer's conduct was or was not reasonable.

21

will also have a second question and that is to say, was

MR. CLEMENT:

Yes, yes.

And we submit this is an

appropriate case to resolve even before the jury that the

facts and circumstances of this case, even if they

9

constitute a Fourth Amendment violation, which I think is

10

a reasonable question under the facts of this case, they

11

nonetheless were not so clearly established that the

12

officer was on notice and qualified immunity is

13

appropriate.

14

QUESTION:

You'd have to say that you think

15

there's a reasonable question whether they constitute a

Fourth Amendment violation in this case.

a reasonable question whether they constituted a Fourth

Amendment violation, you wouldn't have any immunity claim,

would you?

If there weren't

I think that's right.

there may be situations where the claim is fairly well-

decided, but there's some reason why a reasonable officer

MR. CLEMENT:

I'll get to that right now.

I

think one way to focus on this case is, if the Court of

10

Appeals had done the proper analysis, how would they have

11

defined the Fourth Amendment violation in this case?

12

seems to us that one of the things they would have focused

13

on is the failure of these officers to announce their

intention to take Mr. Katz out before they actually

15

grabbed him and took him out of the area.

nondeadly-force context, seems to us to be a new rule or

something that's certainly not clearly established on

It

Now that kind

If the Court of Appeals had approached it that

way, focused in on that as being the key factor that made

the actions of the officers here unreasonable then we

We have these issues here, would

Absolutely.

I think the first

7

thing to recognize is the Ninth Circuit took an extreme

8

view, that qualified immunity is never appropriate in

9

excessive force cases.

The first and most important thing

10

this Court can do is to disabuse the Ninth Circuit of that

notion.

could usefully decide whether or not there's qualified

immunity in this case.

In doing so, it could very well follow the

15

reasoning that I just outlined which is to say what would

make this case an example of excessive force, if anything,

must be this failure to warn first.

Circuit -- this Court can either decide that issue if it's

trial or a trial judge.

as the plaintiff asserts them insofar as they survive

reasonable officer have believed there was too much force,

in light of preexisting law?

would stop you there.

11

whether on those facts the use of force from the

12

perspective of a reasonable officer was reasonable. Now if

the court thinks not --

The first question is simply to ask

Now is there a difference between

the judge should address the issue.

address the issue of liability because that's what this

Court has said on a number of occasions, including Siegert

against Gilley and --

5

QUESTION:

First they should

No, but I'm trying to write down.

6

only have one more step.

7

what to do with the facts, we know what the qualified

8

immunity question is, at least my statement of that was

9

all right.

So we have the right, we know

And then I go on to say, by the way, if the

10

answer to that question is yes, a reasonable officer

11

should have believed there was too much force, then the

12

third step is direct a verdict for the plaintiff unless

13

the underlying facts are in dispute.

14

that question is no, then direct the verdict for the

defendant.

I understand it's very complicated and you may have had a

different way of looking at it.

3

MR. CLEMENT:

Yeah, and all I want to emphasize

4

is I think that misses the Fourth Amendment step that this

Court has said has to proceed the qualified immunity test

and it's helpful to establish what the qualified immunity

or not the officers had fair notice that that Fourth

MR. BOYD:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
I would like to walk this Court through the

17

process and the steps so that there's an understanding of

18

how Anderson and Graham are being used effectively now in

19

the trial courts in order to weed out insubstantial cases

20

and to have the jurors decide these issues in a way that

21

both the individual's right to a remedy and provides the

22

insulation that the officers need.

23

Now the starting point is with a motion to

24

dismiss or a motion for summary judgment and at that point

25

from representing plaintiffs at trial in the federal trial

courts.

defense side and you take out Anderson and you say could

4

the officer have -- whether the officer could have

5

reasonably believed that they could use the amount of

6

force that they did.

7

The first step is, you move to dismiss on the

Anderson sets that straight out.

And then the next thing you do is you take

8

Graham to inform the decision, which is why the opinion is

9

such a brilliant one, because it provides the specifics.

10

It provides a three-step test.

11

Was the person armed and dangerous, dangerous to the

12

police and to the other members of the public and was

13

there resistance?

14

instance, they claim that Dr. Katz had resisted arrest.

15

Now if Dr. Katz resisted arrest in this case, Judge

16

Jensen, a seasoned trial lawyer himself, would have thrown

17

this case out in an instant using Anderson and using

18

Graham.

19

believe that because there was resistance, you can use

additional force.

How severe was the crime?

19

indeed that Dr. Katz was resisting then, yes, that was a

20

fair amount of force to use, but that's the question that

21

has to go back to the trial court here too, is that Dr.

Katz said that he was not resisting and when you do look

at that video you can see that he was not.

else you want to say?

At the summary judgment level, yes,

qualified immunity and on the Fourth Amendment and they

on whether the jury was right or wrong about whether in

its judgment there was a Fourth Amendment violation, but

whether the officers should have anticipated, on the basis

of prior precedent, that the jury would come out the way

it did and if the officer should reasonably have

the officer need not reasonably have anticipated that,

then there is.

Isn't that what the defense is asking for?

It's unclear what they're asking for,

I thought it was here on summary judgment and they take

MR. BOYD:

Your Honor, I think this may answer

that because qualified immunity now is going to provide

for the higher standard.

that he could act in a fashion, which has later been found

MR. BOYD:

And do you know when they go over the

MR. BOYD:

Yes.
Therefore, if you're -- if we're

3

simply talking about this particular decision, we don't

get to any jury instructions at all.

5

MR. BOYD:

No, the only -- the concern though,

6

is that whatever you establish as the summary judgment

7

standard gets carried over to the directed verdict and

8

that's why the decisions that have been made by the Sixth,

9

Seventh, Ninth and D.C. Circuits are so solid is because

10

they take Anderson and Graham and apply them together and

11

that the big mess arises when you try to then put an

12

additional boost on qualified immunity.

13

QUESTION:

Okay, but on this particular record,

14

the Vice President is speaking, this guy gets up to the

front, raises a banner and he's taken out and put in a

What's unreasonable about that?

MR. BOYD:

The part that's unreasonable is the

way that he was put into that van if he was not resisting

MR. BOYD:

That that

Well, this is why you have a disputed

The video shows that Dr. Katz was not

resisting and yet you wouldn't assume that as a fact.

That's a fact for the jury to decide.

They will decide

I might have thought that the Ninth Circuit

And in thinking about that, I thought, well,

12

maybe that's an instance where suddenly the underlying

percent on whether the policemen in the field would

QUESTION:

Mr. Boyd, I think you answered

Justice Scalia's question a second ago and I wanted to

5

suggested the following to me.

6

that the way the unreasonable or reasonable excessive

the officer the benefit of the doubt, you know, none of

the 20/20 hindsight and so on, the guy in the field and

MR. BOYD:

First thing you ask is the Anderson

he's also flunked the substantive test.

MR. BOYD:

Exactly.

QUESTION:

Well that's fine, but that still

8

leaves me the question of why you don't get the same if

9

you consider that a double benefit?

Why is that double

10

benefit not conferred in the Anderson type case, in the

11

probable cause type case?

12

no crime in progress, but a reasonable officer could have

Justice Souter pointed out that -- that -- here, and I

your view on something that Mr. Clement brought up and I

important thing here, and this gets to the crux of the

because with unreasonable force you're dealing with an

MR. BOYD:

Because of the nature of it.

This

2

cuts right to the heart of the intent of the Fourth

3

Amendment to serve as a check on federal officials and

4

there's nothing in the Fourth Amendment making a textural

5

analysis of it that provides for an immunity.

6

there should be one, but it should not be untethered and

7

so in the excessive force case we have the benefit of

8

Graham.

9

cited 2,685 times and the reason for that is because it's

Graham has left a wonderful legacy.

And so

It's been

10

working and it's working along with Anderson.

11

they're talking about now is an expansion of the qualified

12

immunity that would just supplant Graham, unnecessarily

13

so, and raise Seventh Amendment issues.

14

QUESTION:

But, you know, without Graham we have

the legacy of several centuries of probable cause law,

circumstances so long as it was a reasonable judgment on

see why it's any different for excessive force even though

remember the words of Justice Marshall saying that if

we're to be a government of laws and not of men that there

must be a remedy for the violation of a constitutional

the Court in its opinion really needs to come out and --

QUESTION:

You say in almost every case it goes

to the jury?
MR. BOYD:

Well, it depends.

Some of the time

6

it's going to the jury on two sets of jury instructions.

7

This is where there's confusion in the Circuits and some

8

of the time it's going to the jury on Graham and then they

9

give it to the judge, as in McNair, to apply qualified

10

immunity after the jury.

11

direct conflict with the Seventh Amendment.

12

why the most important thing for this Court to make clear

13

and why to adopt the Ninth Circuit standard is because it

14

sets forth a clear workable test so that after the jury

15

has decided based on jury instructions incorporating both

16

Anderson and Graham, that then there's no second guessing

17

by the judge.

18

And that's when you run into
And that's

Because, Your Honors, it's in the -- there are

19

moments when it's up to the judges to decide to make sure

20

that the rights are not deteriorating and that's exactly

21

what's happened here both with Judge Jensen and with Judge

22

Thompson in the unanimous decision of the Ninth Circuit.

23

And so we would urge this Court to follow the decisions of

24

the Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, Tenth and D.C. Circuits that

25

strike the proper balance between preserving the remedy

Mr. Clement,

you have three minutes -- or four minutes.

Thank you, Mr. Boyd.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

10

Like to make three points.

11

have reviewed the videotape, the very fact that this Court

12

could disagree with Ninth Circuit about whether there was

13

excessive force used in this case underscores the need for

14

qualified immunity for officers in the field because

15

clearly Graham against Connor did not answer every case

16

and did not provide officers on crystal clear notice of

17

where the lines were in the excessive-force context.

18

First for those of you who

The second point I'd like to make is simply that

19

jury instruction issues and the question of what goes to

20

the jury and what the judge should decide, those issues

21

are not unique to the excessive-force context.

22

issues arise under probable cause and exigent circumstance

23

in Anderson against Creighton.

24

correct that some of the Circuits have taken divergent

25

views on that.

Those same

And Mr. Boyd's actually

eventually to take up that issue, but as Justice O'Connor

2

has pointed out, this case would be an incredibly poor

3

vehicle to do so since we're here on summary judgment and

4

the Ninth Circuit's denial of summary judgment and the

5

Government's position continues to be that that grant of

6

-- that denial of summary judgment was inappropriate and

7

this Court should reverse that.

8
9

Finally, I want to clarify that despite what may
have been said here it is not accurate to say that the

10

Ninth Circuit, or at least Graham itself, incorporates the

11

test of Anderson against Creighton.

12

allow officers the benefit of the doubt when it comes to

13

reasonable mistakes of fact.

14

benefit of the doubt when it comes to reasonable mistakes

15

of law.

16

reasonableness test the notion of what the preexisting law

17

was and it's a good thing that it doesn't because if that

18

were the case, then the Fourth Amendment law would be

19

frozen in place.

20

Graham itself does

It doesn't grant them the

And it doesn't incorporate into its

QUESTION:

It seems to me that what you're

21

asking is to say that the police officer is entitled to

22

know in every case precisely what he must do and I'm not

23

sure either under qualified immunity and then certainly

24

under general Fourth Amendment principles we can do that.

25

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't think that's what we're

asking, with all due respect Justice Kennedy.

I think

2

what we're asking is that the officers be put on fair

3

warning that their conduct is unlawful.

4

an opinion for the Court in United States against Lanier

5

addressed this issue in the context of 18 U.S.C. 242 and

6

made clear that what's required in that context, and he

7

noted that the same rule applies in qualified immunity, is

8

the officers have fair warning because the principles, the

9

general principles, have been made specific is the term he

Justice Souter in

10

used, by application through prior cases.

11

Circuit in a case called Lassiter against Alabama A&M

12

expressed the same concept by saying that what you need is

13

the prior case law that's materially similar.

14

QUESTION:

All right.

The Eleventh

Well, if the standards

15

are the same, sometimes by coincidence it could turn out

16

that the qualified immunity standard and the underlying

17

substantive standard are the same.

18

only one question to ask and if not there are obviously

19

two questions to ask.

20

arguing is that this and the Ninth Circuit says by

21

coincidence they happen to be the same.

22
23

All right, I thought all they're

1

MR. CLEMENT:

Absolutely.

Absolutely, because

2

Graham against Connor itself does not build in reasonable

3

mistakes of law or take into account what the preexisting

4

law was.

5
6

QUESTION:

Only reasonable mistakes of fact, is

that your point?

7

MR. CLEMENT:

That's exactly right, because if

8

it were otherwise then the very fact that prior law didn't

9

put an officer on notice and there was unclarity would

10

itself mean that the conduct was lawful and then there'd

11

be no mechanism for the law to provide clarity in the

12

Fourth Amendment context.

13

this Court asked lower courts to deal with the liability

14

-- the constitutional issue first and only the immunity

15

question second.

16

It's the same idea as to why

The last point I'd like to make is in response

to Justice Ginsburg's question about what the rationale of
