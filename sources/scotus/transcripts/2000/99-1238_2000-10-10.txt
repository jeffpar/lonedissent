Mr. Castellano.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. CASTELLANO

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. CASTELLANO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The issue before the Court in this case is

12

whether a State prisoner can extend the 1-year limitations

13

period for Federal habeas corpus petitions by filing

14

repetitive motions in State court that are procedurally

15

barred from review under State law.

16

three reasons why these motions should not be afforded

17

tolling.

18

QUESTION:

There are at least

I take it it all comes up because

19

we're construing the language, properly filed, in the

20

applicable statutory provision.

21

MR. CASTELLANO:

Absolutely, Your Honor, yes.

22

These State post conviction motions, Your Honor, cause

23

unnecessary delays from repetitive litigation that advance

24

no purpose of the tolling provision.

25

prisoners with a simple expedient to defeat the statute of
3

They provide State

1

limitations at will, and allowing tolling for such motions

2

undermines core principles of comity and federalism.

3

They're at the heart of this Court's habeas corpus

4

jurisprudence, and at the core of the AEDPA.

5

The statutory language supports the position of

6

the States here.

7

language the words, properly filed, must mean something

8

more than simply filed.

9

Under a plain reading of the statutory

QUESTION:

Well, the courts are all over the lot

10

on what the words, properly filed, mean.

11

there are several different approaches.

12

properly filed in the sense of being timely and in the

13

proper place, or maybe getting permission from the State,

14

a certificate of appealability if the State requires it,

15

that kind of thing.

16

MR. CASTELLANO:

17

QUESTION:

It seems to me
Maybe just

Yes, Your Honor.

So not every lower court has thought

18

that it also encompasses a review of substance to see

19

whether it's procedurally barred.

20
21
22

MR. CASTELLANO:

Yes, that's right, Your Honor.

There are many -QUESTION:

And I guess the court has to later

23

decide whether it's procedurally barred.

24

presumably would reach that question, or the Federal

25

court, in due course, wouldn't it?
4

The State court

1

MR. CASTELLANO:

2

QUESTION:

3

Yes.

The Federal habeas court would, I

suppose, at the end of the day have to address that issue.

4

MR. CASTELLANO:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. CASTELLANO:

Yes, absolutely, Your Honor.

Yes.
Here there are several

7

different definitions.

8

the respondent relies, and that demonstrates, if anything,

9

that there is some ambiguity in the language of the

10

statute.

11

definition.

12
13

Even among the cases upon which

The word properly is not easily susceptible of
Here --

QUESTION:

And what is your definition of

properly filed?

14

MR. CASTELLANO:

It's this, Your Honor.

There's

15

really a three-step analysis, if you will.

16

is this.

17

filed, in addition to the ordinary rules of statutory

18

construction, which would so indicate.

19

The first step

Properly filed must mean something more than

In addition, here Congress used the word filed

20

24 times in the habeas corpus statute but modified it with

21

the word properly only once, so it must have meant that

22

the words properly filed had something more than an

23

inconsequential or nominal meaning.

24
25

Second, there's a plain sense, plain common
sense reading of the words, properly filed, under which a
5

1

document, to be properly filed, has to be filed in the

2

right place, in the right court, and even some of the

3

cases upon which the respondent relies so indicated.

4

QUESTION:

That gets you to the situation where

5

the petition is filed in a court that didn't even have the

6

authority to grant any sort of relief.

7

MR. CASTELLANO:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. CASTELLANO:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

But you want to go further than that.
Yes, Your Honor.

We say that

10

here this Court did not have the authority to grant the

11

relief requested because there was an absolute mandatory

12

State procedural bar in the way.

13

QUESTION:

And is that the third part of your

14

test, or the second part of your --

15

MR. CASTELLANO:

That's the second part of the

16

test.

17

common sense understanding of the words, right place, or

18

right court, under which a document can't be filed in the

19

right court if it's filed in a court that can't entertain

20

the merits of it.

21

The third part of the test is that a -- is a plain

QUESTION:

That's really the third -Well, but does it follow that the

22

court can't entertain the merits?

23

bar is something that can be waived and, as

24

counterintuitive as it may be, I mean, we occasionally do

25

get cases before this Court in which there seems to have
6

I mean, a procedural

1

been a procedural bar that the State didn't invoke, so it

2

seems to me that we're not in the position of even being

3

able to analyze this on a merely -- or I shouldn't say

4

merely, on a jurisdictional basis, because it really

5

doesn't go to the State court's jurisdiction.

6

the discretionary decision by the State prosecutor to

7

invoke the bar, and so I don't think we can do it on the

8

third prong that you mentioned, which I understood was in

9

a sense in effect a jurisdictional prong.

10

MR. CASTELLANO:

It goes to

No, Your Honor, the third prong

11

is not a jurisdictional prong.

12

says that if the State court can't, under the State's

13

procedural rules, adjudicate the merits, then that motion

14

is not properly filed in that State court.

15
16

QUESTION:

It's simply a prong that

You mean, if it can't adjudicate the

merits it's not properly filed.

17

MR. CASTELLANO:

It's not properly filed if it

18

can't adjudicate the merits.

19

QUESTION:

No, but it can adjudicate the merits.

20

It can adjudicate the merits if the State doesn't invoke

21

the bar.

22

MR. CASTELLANO:

Not in this case.

First of

23

all, Your Honor, these are absolute mandatory bars, and

24

there's no indication that if the State waives these bars,

25

that the Court has the authority to examine these
7

1
2

issues -QUESTION:

But doesn't this --

doesn't your

3

answer, and I realize I'm shifting my position here, but

4

doesn't your answer point out another difficulty of your

5

position, and that is, a Federal court is, it seems to me,

6

hard-pressed in these cases if it's got to decide whether

7

a particular bar is jurisdictional or whether it's not

8

jurisdictional under State law, and this is just adding

9

one more complication, as against the position of the

10

other side, which takes a kind of a plain language, almost

11

physical act interpretation.

12

You're putting yet another burden on the State

13

court to decide whether a bar is jurisdictional or not,

14

and it seems to me that that counts against adopting your

15

interpretation.

16

MR. CASTELLANO:

17

we are imposing an additional bar.

18

sense jurisdictional.

19

procedural bar which, under the procedural default

20

doctrine, is a concept that the Federal courts are very

21

familiar with.

22

No, Your Honor, I don't believe
I wouldn't use the

I would use mandatory State

This Court in Teague v. Lane, for example, did

23

the type of analysis that we're advancing here.

24

words, it decided whether or not to send a State prisoner

25

back to State court in order to pursue a State remedy, or,
8

In other

1

on the other hand, whether that State remedy is no longer

2

available --

3

QUESTION:

Well, there's no question that the

4

Federal courts in a sense can do this.

5

Federal courts have to do it, but it seems to me that it

6

does count against your position that a Federal court will

7

have to go through this every time a State court issues a

8

laconic one-word order, denied.

9

QUESTION:

Sometimes the

And that essentially usurps the

10

function, or at least duplicates the function of the State

11

court and is, it seems to me, contrary to the Federal

12

interests that underlie this statute.

13

MR. CASTELLANO:

I don't believe it duplicates

14

the function of the State courts at all.

I believe that

15

simply it shows respect to the State court procedural

16

rules and respect to the individual State court decisions

17

that have been --

18

QUESTION:

Could I --

19

QUESTION:

Well, presumably the State court made

20

that determination when it made the underlying order, and

21

it seems to me that this is really contrary to the

22

federalism concerns that in large part were the basis of

23

the statute.

24

determination which brushes up against the merits, just in

25

order to determine the tolling provision.

You're asking the Federal courts to make a

9

1

MR. CASTELLANO:

Actually, Your Honor, what the

2

Court could do is to adopt the Harris v. Reid plain

3

statement rule, and the Coleman exception to the Harris v.

4

Reid plain statement rule and in this -- so that

5

ordinarily there would be a plain statement on behalf of

6

the State court applying the particular State procedural

7

bar in that individual case.

8

QUESTION:

9

Let's back up just a minute, Mr. -- I

suppose you'd be on stronger ground if you're talking not

10

about a procedural bar to the merits in the sense of plain

11

statement, that sort of thing.

12

failure to file within the time limit provided by the

13

State.

14

MR. CASTELLANO:

15

QUESTION:

16

Supposing you just have a

Yes, Your Honor, that's --

I take it you believe that in order

to be properly filed the thing must be timely.

17

MR. CASTELLANO:

18

QUESTION:

Yes, absolutely, Your Honor.

Even though perhaps in a pleading

19

sense, in the New York courts, a statute of limitations,

20

if it isn't pleaded by the defendant, might be waived.

21

MR. CASTELLANO:

Right, Your Honor.

In New York

22

there is no statute of limitations for post conviction

23

review, but certainly in many States, such as Florida,

24

which is represented here, there's a statute of

25

limitations that does have exceptions to it, and as to
10

1

which there should be some judicial review with regard to

2

the application of that particular --

3

QUESTION:

So then the Federal court would have

4

to determine not only if there is a procedural bar, but

5

what exceptions exist, and whether this particular case

6

fits within that exception, like statute of limitations

7

often have tolling accoutrements, so you're getting the

8

Federal court involved in a lot of up-front decisonmaking

9

that substitutes for the State, and my question is I think

10

the same as Justice Kennedy's.

11

Federal court, as it does in the Erie area, to make a

12

determination of what State law is.

13

That is, you're asking the

Isn't it more respectful of the States to say,

14

State -- State court, this is for you to decide.

We don't

15

know how to apply your procedural bar rule.

16

have you tell us, does this fall within an exception?

We'd rather

17

It seems to me that ordering the Federal court

18

to decide the State law question is not as respectful of

19

the States as it would be to say, that's a question that

20

the State courts should decide.

21

MR. CASTELLANO:

Well, Your Honor, in the

22

ordinary case the State court will have already decided

23

that very particular issue and applied that procedural bar

24

to the very case that's now in front of the --

25

QUESTION:

But here we don't know, because the
11

1
2

State order is opaque.

It doesn't tell us.

MR. CASTELLANO:

I think the application here is

3

a little bit different.

If you apply, for example, the

4

Harris v. Reid plain statement rule, and the Coleman

5

exception to it, we fall within that, so for example,

6

under Coleman this Court held that there was no need to --

7

there was no need to have a plain statement, because from

8

all the facts and circumstances it didn't fairly appear

9

that the State court decision was based primarily on

10

Federal law or interwoven with Federal law.

11

exactly the situation that we have here as well.

12

QUESTION:

That's

The Federal court is always going to

13

have to decide, when this question comes up, whether or

14

not the State petition was, quote, properly filed.

15

mean, that was Congress' choice.

16

necessarily any court's choice.

17
18
19

MR. CASTELLANO:

I

I mean, it isn't

Yes, absolutely, Your Honor,

and it's the exact same interpretation.
QUESTION:

And the question is what properly

20

filed meant, and one thing to say, we look to State law to

21

see if this is an application for whatever, and we look to

22

see that it is, in fact, filed in the court, the stamp and

23

everything, there it is in the properly filed, in the

24

right court.

25

are easy for a Federal court to check, but going beyond

It seems to me that those mechanical things

12

1

that, this is a rather complex operation.

2

MR. CASTELLANO:

The problem with reducing the

3

word properly to such a limited view, to a view that just

4

says, rudimentary filing requirements, is in part this.

5

That means that a document that satisfies service and

6

notice requirements only, but is filed in, for example, a

7

surrogate's court, or a court that's -- can't possibly

8

decide the claim, might be included.

9

QUESTION:

So what?

10

QUESTION:

Well, but if -- I suppose that a

11

State could have its own State rule for second or

12

successive petitions in State court for post conviction

13

relief, such as a requirement that the applicant get a

14

certificate from some reviewing court as a prerequisite to

15

filing the successive petition, and if there were that

16

kind of mechanical requirement, just like the requirement

17

for a filing fee, or filing in a certain court or within a

18

certain time, all those things are in the nature of kind

19

of mechanical rules, so the State can certainly protect

20

itself, it seems to me.

21

MR. CASTELLANO:

Yes, Your Honor, the State can

22

protect itself.

The problem with that is this.

23

only very few States that enacted their post conviction

24

review schemes in terms of prefiling review, and it would

25

mean -13

There are

1
2

QUESTION:

Yes, but it's open to a State to do

it.

3

MR. CASTELLANO:

4

QUESTION:

It's open to a State to --

I mean, there's no reason why we have

5

to construct something to save the State that the State

6

can take care of on its own.

7

MR. CASTELLANO:

But it would be to assume that

8

Congress meant that it's statute would not have any real

9

or meaningful effect in all of those States in which there

10
11

was no prefiling review, and that it would be -QUESTION:

Well, it does have a meaningful

12

effect in the sense of looking to any State requirements

13

for timing, place, et cetera.

14

MR. CASTELLANO:

Except that that view, the

15

respondent's view and the Second Circuit's view here

16

doesn't look to all of the procedural rules.

17

a very small subset.

18

QUESTION:

It looks to

Well, maybe we should expand it

19

slightly, but not to include a procedural bar and

20

substantive law component.

21
22

QUESTION:

We don't have to take either all one

or all the other.

23

MR. CASTELLANO:

24

QUESTION:

25

Absolutely, Your Honor, yes.

If we go beyond the mechanical,

mechanical things are easy to check, but once you get
14

1

beyond the mechanical, you both have the Federal courts

2

interpreting State law later, and it seems to me something

3

worse.

4

certainly, who has any kind of complicated State issue,

5

will know that he better file a protective habeas petition

6

in Federal court.

7

Any reasonable defendant who has a lawyer,

Now, what's the Federal judge supposed to do

8

when he gets that habeas petition --

9

MR. CASTELLANO:

10

QUESTION:

That --

-- prior to the State court deciding

11

the issue, and that's going to happen all over the place.

12

He now has to decide questions of State law which the

13

State court might later say he's wrong about or risk

14

dismissing it, or avoid the exhaustion problem.

15

like a real mess as soon as you depart from the

16

mechanical.

17

MR. CASTELLANO:

It sounds

No, not at all, Your Honor,

18

because that's the same position that that Federal court

19

is in if it's deciding whether to send that petitioner

20

back to State court to exhaust his State remedies.

21

say, make that exact same determination.

22

We

In other words, when it comes to Federal court,

23

you make that Rose v. Lundy determination.

24

to send that petitioner back to State court, or are you

25

going to presume that there's a State court procedural bar
15

Are you going

1

that's in the way, that renders that remedy no longer

2

available.

3

Make that determination, and that's a

4

determination that's made regularly by the Second Circuit

5

with regard to the very same procedural rules that are at

6

issue in this case, and made regularly with regard --

7

with -- by the Federal circuit courts in New York with

8

regard to the very same procedural rules that are at issue

9

in this case.

10

QUESTION:

But I'm --

11

QUESTION:

What difference does it -- go ahead.

12

QUESTION:

Well, I'm puzzled.

There's

13

litigation in the State court over whether or not a

14

procedural bar exists.

15

what is a Federal judge supposed to do, decide the issue?

While that litigation goes on,

16

MR. CASTELLANO:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Your Honor --

Or say the remedy hasn't been

exhausted?
MR. CASTELLANO:

There's more than one

20

alternative.

One of the reasonable alternatives would

21

just be to dismiss the case under Rose v. Lundy to allow

22

the exhaustion to take place.

23

QUESTION:

Right, and then it takes more than a

24

year to resolve the procedural bar issue in the State

25

court, and eventually you end up saying you're
16

1

procedurally barred.

2

limitation, then?

3

procedural bar?

4

Why do you need the statute of

Why don't you just rely on the

MR. CASTELLANO:

The statute of limitations is a

5

timing device, separate from the procedural bar.

6

words --

7

QUESTION:

In other

Yes, but whether the statute has run

8

or not depends on whether or not the case was procedurally

9

barred, and if it was procedurally barred, why do you need

10

the statute of limitations?

11

MR. CASTELLANO:

12

individual claims.

13

the --

14

QUESTION:

The procedural bar goes to

The statute of limitations goes to

Right, but you find in the State all

15

the claims were procedurally barred, otherwise the statute

16

would not have run, and if they find that, why do you need

17

the statute of limitations?

18
19

MR. CASTELLANO:

You need -- well, you need the

statute of limitations for other types of cases.

20

QUESTION:

That are not procedurally barred.

21

MR. CASTELLANO:

22

QUESTION:

No --

Under your rule, what would happen if

23

there were some petition -- some claims that were

24

procedurally barred and some that were not?

25

MR. CASTELLANO:

Under our position, that
17

1

petitioner would receive exhaustion, and to go back to

2

Justice Stevens' example, the court should dismiss that,

3

or could, at least, dismiss that claim under Rose v. Lundy

4

and during that period of time, that period of time in

5

which the State -- in which the State prisoner was

6

exhausting State remedies, he should receive tolling if

7

this was a proper dismissal under Rose v. Lundy.

8

should be an automatic result of the dismissal under Rose

9

v. Lundy, is to allow the tolling for the petitioner.

10

QUESTION:

That

Yes, but then I'm asking you, at the

11

end of this 14-month litigation in the State procedure the

12

State court ends up saying, all the claims are

13

procedurally barred.

14

limitations if that's the holding of the State court?

15

Why do you need a statute of

MR. CASTELLANO:

You need the statute of

16

limitations because that petitioner, first of all

17

shouldn't be -- that petitioner, if he knows beforehand

18

that those claims are procedurally barred, of course,

19

shouldn't be --

20

QUESTION:

Well, I'm assuming he doesn't know

21

until the 14 months of litigation in the State court have

22

resolved the issue, and there are lots of times

23

MR. CASTELLANO:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. CASTELLANO:

Right.

-- it's a contested matter.
Well, you need the statute of
18

1

limitations for one thing to keep that -- to encourage,

2

not just that petitioner, but other petitioners who don't

3

have to go through that process of 14 months of litigation

4

into Federal court more quickly.

5
6

QUESTION:

But they all have to go through that

process if the State's going to plead a procedural bar.

7

MR. CASTELLANO:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

I'm sorry, Justice --

I really think there's tension

between the exhaustion rule and your interpretation of
properly filed.

11

MR. CASTELLANO:

Not at all, Your Honor.

12

That -- this interpretation follows the exhaustion rule to

13

a tee.

14

State court for exhaustion purposes, then this petitioner

15

receives tolling.

16

wouldn't send it back for exhaustion purposes, then you

17

don't receive tolling.

It says that if you would send this case back to

18
19

If you wouldn't receive -- if you

I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for
rebuttal.

20

QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Castellano.

21

Mr. Schweitzer, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN SCHWEITZER

23

ON BEHALF OF FLORIDA, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

24

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

25

MR. SCHWEITZER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
19

1

please the Court:

2

The language, structure, and objectives of

3

section 2244(d) tell us that Congress intended the tolling

4

provision to harmonize the limitations period and the

5

exhaustion doctrine.

6

term, properly filed application, undermines the

7

limitation period and reads the word properly out of the

8

statute.

9

Respondent's construction of the

I'd like to turn to some of the federalism

10

questions that were raised in terms of how the State's

11

construction of the term furthers the State's federalism

12

interests.

13

limitations period itself was enacted by Congress to

14

further the State's comity concerns by speeding up the

15

date at which the Federal habeas process will take place.

16

It does so when we recognize the fact that the

Congress was motivated by the fact that it often

17

took many, many years for the Federal courts to possibly

18

order a new trial, or generally to provide finality to the

19

State conviction.

20

State rule there will be a protective Federal filing such

21

as that which Justice Breyer and Justice Stevens

22

mentioned.

23

It may be that as a consequence of the

Notwithstanding the fact that this may take

24

place at the same time that the State proceeding is

25

occurring, it still furthers the State's comity interest,
20

1

because often the State -- the Federal court will be able

2

to recognize that the application is plainly procedurally

3

barred, at which point the Federal court can proceed to

4

rule on the habeas application and would be doing so many

5

years sooner than it otherwise would have been, which is

6

precisely the goal that Congress had in enacting the

7

limitation --

8
9

QUESTION:
isn't clear?

What about the case where it just

I mean, the easy cases can sort themselves

10

out under either interpretation, I think, but what about

11

the cases which are tougher?

12

MR. SCHWEITZER:

Where it's not clear, and so

13

the prisoner isn't certain --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SCHWEITZER:

16

QUESTION:

It's a difficult -- you know -Right.

-- frivolous cases aren't really that

17

tough.

18

might -- may have some merit, and you're not sure, and the

19

State law's uncertain, those are the ones that take the

20

time.

21

I mean, we deal with them.

MR. SCHWEITZER:

But the cases that

Though I should make clear, a

22

large percentage of these cases will be the frivolous

23

ones, the second, third, fifth applications, but --

24
25

QUESTION:

It's no problem, if the Federal court

sees somebody abusing the State system this is an
21

1

equitable statute, tolling, and they can deal with it.

2

But I'm worried about the complicated, close cases.

3

happens there?

4

MR. SCHWEITZER:

Right.

What

In that case where the

5

protective Federal habeas filing is made, and the Federal

6

court looks at the case and says, it's a close call

7

whether or not the State procedure is available, so it

8

might be possible for the State remedies to be exhausted.

9
10
11

At that point the Federal court would dismiss
the Federal application under Rose v. Lundy.
QUESTION:

It goes back, and now the State court

12

says, oh, well, I guess, in fact, there's a independent

13

State ground, or the statute of limitations wasn't tolled

14

under State law, et cetera.

15

MR. SCHWEITZER:

Now what happens?
Right.

If, upon return to the

16

State court, the State court says, in fact, this is

17

procedurally barred, in that case we believe would be an

18

appropriate instance for equitable tolling to toll that

19

time back --

20
21
22

QUESTION:
interpretation?

How could you, under your

It's more than a year.

MR. SCHWEITZER:

Right, but the time back in

23

State court would equitably toll the Federal 1-year

24

limitations provision.

25

QUESTION:

Even though it turns out that, in
22

1

fact, it's not -- even though it was in the wrong court,

2

it should have gone to the surrogate court, or something?

3

MR. SCHWEITZER:

Well, if the Federal court,

4

upon looking at the habeas petition says, this might, in

5

fact, be a proper case to be back in the State courts,

6

there may be those State remedies available.

7

prisoner properly invokes those very State remedies that

8

the Federal court had in mind --

9
10

QUESTION:

It was wrong.

MR. SCHWEITZER:

12

QUESTION:

14

It was wrong under

State --

11

13

If the

Well, the Federal --

The Federal court was wrong.

It was

a close question.
MR. SCHWEITZER:

But in essence, since the State

15

prisoner shouldn't be penalized for the Federal court

16

being wrong, we think that would be an appropriate time

17

for the limitations period to be tolled.

18

that Federal statutes have equitable tolling available,

19

and we don't challenge that here.

20

QUESTION:

It's presumptive

Mr. Schweitzer, the problem I have

21

with your position is, I don't know how you can get out of

22

the word properly the kind of line that you want to draw.

23

I can see how you can say, properly filed means, you know,

24

the technical things, the proper court, the name's right,

25

that I can understand, but you want to say it includes
23

1

procedural bars, that the claim is invalid on the merits

2

because of a -- it's invalid because of a procedural bar.

3

If that is embraced within the word, properly

4

filed, why wouldn't the fact that the claim is

5

unmeritorious for a substantive reason be included as

6

well?

7

a ridiculous, nonmeritorious complaint.

8

the word properly to cover only procedural bars and not

9

substantive bars?

10

It's not properly filed if it's a -- you know, it's

MR. SCHWEITZER:

How do you get

Well, the first answer to that

11

question is that we think it makes sense to believe that

12

Congress took the word -- inserted the word properly here

13

and created the phrase, properly filed application,

14

borrowing from its past use of the word properly with

15

respect to the terms, proper exhaustion, and proper

16

presentation, both of which deal with the presentation of

17

claims to State courts which, if it's properly done,

18

provides the State courts with the opportunity to rule on

19

the merits, regardless of how the court ultimately rules

20

on that merits decision.

21

In terms of the question respondents focus on,

22

which is, how does properly modify file, it's just that it

23

means more than mere filing requirements.

24

treat the word properly as merely modifying how a document

25

is filed, almost the physical manner by which it's filed,
24

Respondents

1

but properly can also be read to modify the question of

2

whether the document should have been filed in the first

3

place.

4

If the lawyer drafts a complaint that clearly

5

violates Rule 11, but then files that complaint anyway,

6

that's an improper act on the part of the attorney, and it

7

would be an improperly filed complaint.

8
9
10
11

QUESTION:
merits claim.

So also if it makes a frivolous

You could say that's not properly filed.

There's no substance to it.
MR. SCHWEITZER:

Well, in the habeas corpus

12

context, where there's such a focus on compliance with the

13

various procedural bars, and where the procedural default

14

context expressly exists to accommodate the situations

15

where State procedural rules aren't complied with, but

16

prisoners aren't considered to have done anything wrong if

17

they have exhausted their State remedies but lost on the

18

merits, we think that same -- Congress had that same mind

19

set here, where the prisoner isn't treated as having done

20

anything wrong, having done anything improper or incorrect

21

by bringing losing claims, but the prisoner has done

22

something wrong by bringing claims that are barred by

23

mandatory State court rules, and then attempting to delay

24

the limitations period, possibly indefinitely, by filing

25

repetitive, improper claims in the State court.
25

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Schweitzer, does Florida have

2

either a statute of limitations or any rules taking care

3

of the repetitive and successive filing problem as a

4

matter of State law?

5

MR. SCHWEITZER:

Well, Florida has a 2-year

6

limitations on noncapital cases and a 1-year limitation on

7

capital cases, both of which have exceptions for new facts

8

or new law, and mere existence of that exception means

9

that under respondent's theory you can violate the time

10

bar, and that's -- and it would still be a properly filed

11

application.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Schweitzer, you have conceded, I

13

think, in agreement with Mr. Castellano, that Congress

14

could have been, as he put it in his brief, more specific

15

in defining the scope of the tolling provision.

16

MR. SCHWEITZER:

17

QUESTION:

Yes.

And you say that -- well, Mr.

18

Castellano says the reason probably that Congress was not

19

more specific, that 1) it's Members couldn't agree on a

20

definition, or because the types of State procedures that

21

could be invoked were so varied, Congress thought it best

22

to leave the application of the provision for the courts,

23

but that seems -- why shouldn't the court say, well,

24

Congress, we'll just go as far as you did.

25

ambiguous about this.

You left room for one

You were

26

1

interpretation or the other.

2

that favors the petitioner.

3

MR. SCHWEITZER:

We're going to pick the one

I wouldn't want to speculate as

4

to why Congress didn't do a better job of defining the

5

exact contours of the tolling provision, but I don't think

6

that an ambiguity in the statute requires an answer one

7

way or the other.

8

left with the task of trying to determine what makes sense

9

in light of the limitations period generally.

10

QUESTION:

I think for better or for worse we're

Well, it's not one or the other,

11

because everyone would agree that at least it's got to be

12

an application for habeas corpus, and has got to be filed

13

in the court, so it's not -- it's -- that's -- no question

14

about it.

15

than that, and I'm asking why the Federal court should

16

read something into the statute that Congress didn't

17

clearly put there.

18

The question is whether there is something more

MR. SCHWEITZER:

Because the problem, without

19

reading more into it, is that it would essentially allow

20

subsection 2 of 2244(d), the tolling provision, undermine

21

subsection 1, the limitations period, and it's an unusual

22

provision of law which defeats itself.

23

As Mr. Castellano mentioned, if subsection 2,

24

the tolling provision, is read as respondent suggests,

25

then repetitive filings can be made by the prisoners who,
27

1

at will, can extend the limitations period indefinitely,

2

and there's certainly no --

3

QUESTION:

Not if the States, as Justice

4

O'Connor suggested, enacts one of these -- you have to get

5

permission before you can file such an application.

6

QUESTION:

7

Mr. Futerfas.

8
9

Thank you, Mr. Schweitzer.
Am I pronouncing your name

correctly?
MR. FUTERFAS:

Yes, you are, Mr. Chief Justice.

10

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN S. FUTERFAS

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12
13
14

MR. FUTERFAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The State of New York has stood before you for

15

the last half-an-hour, as well as Attorney General from

16

Florida, and argued for a rule which, if adopted, will

17

ensure that thousands of prisoners will file their Federal

18

habeas petitions before exhausting their State post

19

conviction remedies.

20

If adopted, it will be malpractice for a lawyer,

21

we respectfully submit, not to file in Federal court

22

first, or as soon as possible, because the defendant and

23

the lawyer will never know under the State's rule whether

24

or not they are properly filed until it is determined

25

whether or not their claims are procedurally barred.
28

1

We respectfully suggest that that rule is

2

inconsistent with 2244(d)(2), other provisions of the

3

AEDPA, and this Court's decisions which encourage

4

exhaustion.

5
6
7

QUESTION:

What do you think the term properly

filed means, Mr. Futerfas?
MR. FUTERFAS:

As we state in the brief in the

8

Second Circuit, and in fact the majority of the circuits,

9

I tend to disagree with petitioner.

10

There are a number of

circuits who have construed this in --

11

QUESTION:

I mean your position.

12

MR. FUTERFAS:

Our position is, a properly filed

13

application is an application which is delivered to the

14

custodian designated to receive it in accordance with the

15

rules governing its acceptance for filing.

16

QUESTION:

Well, supposing, to use Mr.

17

Castellano's example, there's a habeas corpus petition

18

that is delivered to the clerk of a surrogate's court

19

which has only probate jurisdiction?

20

MR. FUTERFAS:

It's not properly filed.

21

Properly filed -- the word properly, we respectfully

22

submit, has meaning, has real meaning.

23

to exhaust their State remedies, Congress has created a

24

simple mechanism for them to do so, but they must follow

25

it accurately.

Prisoners who want

They must file the right document with the
29

right custodian in the right time.

MR. FUTERFAS:

QUESTION:

10

That's correct.

And in the correct court that would

It's a burden

Yes.

When we look at what --

How about a State requirement for a

successive position, petition that there be some -something akin to a certificate of appealability?

They have to require -- our

12

position is -- our position, we respectfully submit,

13

respects State court systems.

14

procedure for its judicial screening, prisoners are on

15

notice through the word properly that they have to file

16

that.

17

If a State court sets up a

They have to get it to the right recipient,

18

whether it's a judge or a clerk, and they have to put it

19

in the right document, on the right time, and we think

20

it's a simple mechanism, but it's one that -- you know,

21

Congress has kind of allocated burdens and risks here.

22

They want State petitioners to be able to exhaust and not

23

have to worry about making a protective filing.

24

don't have to worry about going to Federal court, but they

25

have to do it right.
30

They

1

QUESTION:

Your quarrel then, really, with the

2

petitioner is on the procedural bar type of thing, where

3

it's uncertain whether this can be raised.

4

MR. FUTERFAS:

That's exactly the problem.

5

If -- and I call it, for lack of a better word, the

6

uncertainty principle.

7

If a petitioner, or the lawyer knows with

8

certainty that tolling will be affected, the lawyer will

9

not have to file a protective filing, but if there's

10

uncertainty as to whether tolling will be affected, that

11

uncertainty creates, there's no question, as I stated in

12

my opening statement, that it be almost malpractice not to

13

file a protective filing, and what's wrong with protective

14

filings?

15

I think the petitioner takes a somewhat relaxed

16

view of how Federal district court judges are going to

17

view protective filings.

18

court judges are going to be happy with them at all.

19

What really will happen if there's uncertainty of tolling

20

is that all State -- word gets around quickly in the

21

jails.

We all know that.

I don't think Federal district

This Court knows that.

22

These State prisoners will begin filing first in

23

Federal court, and what they will be seeking and obtaining

24

is essentially a declaratory judgment by the Federal judge

25

on State substantive and procedural law, so they'll have a
31

1

Federal judge in the first instance say, okay, these three

2

claims are exhausted, these four claims are not exhausted,

3

so now you can go back.

4

And now, of course, the certainty of tolling,

5

which Congress set up to be in the mechanism of the

6

properly filed application, now that certainty of tolling

7

is resulted by pronouncement of a Federal district court

8

judge and, of course, this increases a Federal judge's

9

workload immeasurably, because many of these claims, or

10

some percentage of these claims where a State prisoner is

11

exhausting will be resolved.

12

will get relief on the merits in State court, and they'll

13

never have to bother a Federal district court judge.

14

if there's uncertainty of tolling, the Federal judge will

15

deal with all these cases before they're allowed to run

16

through the State court system.

17

Maybe the State prisoner

But

And the other thing to, I think respectfully to

18

focus on is, as this Court stated unanimously in Michael

19

Williams v. Taylor, quote, we start as always with the

20

language of the statute.

21

filed application.

22

verb filed.

23

This statute says, properly

Properly is an adverb, modifying the

The subject of that phrase is an application.

The State and amici have suggested that although

24

Congress chose the words, properly filed application, it

25

really meant to say something else, a properly presented
32

1

claim, an application presenting claims the defendant has

2

a right to raise, but in fact, Congress had all of that

3

phraseology and language at its disposal, and it's used

4

that very language in other parts of the statute.

5

For instance, where Congress sought to define

6

exhaustion, they did so.

2254(c), as this Court's

7

recognized in the Wainwright and Duckworth and O'Sullivan

8

decisions, that statute defines exhaustion, so if

9

Congress -- if Congress wanted to write a statute that

10

conditioned tolling on actual exhaustion, they could have

11

simply said that tolling will occur with a properly filed

12

application presenting questions the applicant has the

13

right to raise by any available procedure.

14

was right there for Congress to use just a few pages

15

later, after 2244.

16

That language

Congress did not use that language.

Where Congress sought to limit successive

17

applications and predicate tolling on one application

18

only, they did so not in one but in two places,

19

2244(b)(3), which requires judicial approval, and 2263 in

20

the opting provision, where you have tolling for a first

21

post conviction application, so Congress had that language

22

available it could have used.

23

In the very statute at issue, 2244, Congress

24

specifically sought to address a claim presented in an

25

application.

Those series of words occur a number of
33

1
2

times, at 2244(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(4).
So all of this language that the petitioner

3

suggests really, Congress really meant to say, was used,

4

and under this Court's decisions we start with the

5

language of the statute and I think in this case we also

6

end with the language of the statute.

7

QUESTION:

May I ask a question about the

8

operation of the State procedural bar in this scenario?

9

Let's assume that as your opponent suggests, that there

10

is, in fact, a State procedural bar in this case, and

11

let's assume that you're right that that doesn't factor

12

into this 1-year statute of limitations determination by

13

the Federal court.

14

State procedural bar have on the Federal habeas corpus

15

proceeding?

16
17
18

Then what impact, if any, would the

MR. FUTERFAS:

I'm not sure if I understand Your

Honor's question.
QUESTION:

In other words, there is a State --

19

the State will not hear this case because its court will

20

determine there's a procedural bar.

21

Mr. Castellano is right about that, what a State court

22

would do in this very case, but that you are right that

23

that kind of complex determination should not be made by

24

the Federal court, so the Federal court just checks to see

25

that it is an application, and that it has indeed been
34

Let's say that

1
2

filed in the right court.
What impact, if any, does the State rule that

3

this claim is procedurally barred in State court have in

4

the Federal habeas corpus proceeding?

5

MR. FUTERFAS:

Well, in terms of tolling, I

6

don't think it would have any effect.

7

granting of an application, which is I think what Your

8

Honor's question concerns, rules governing whether an

9

application shall be granted, whether relief shall be

10

granted, are different than State rules governing the

11

filing of the application, so in one instance whether a

12

defendant's claims are procedurally barred or not should

13

not have any effect on whether they toll the statute.

14

suggest that properly filed application was meant to

15

promote federalism, promote defendants --

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. FUTERFAS:

18

QUESTION:

Rules governing the

We

Yeah --- and encourage them to exhaust.

-- I'm accepting both their position

19

that this is, in fact, procedurally barred in the State,

20

your position that that doesn't -- you don't get into that

21

on the statute of limitations question.

22

then, when there's no time bar in the Federal court, what

23

effect, if any, does the State rule that this claim would

24

be procedurally barred in State court, have on the Federal

25

habeas proceeding?
35

I'm asking you

1

MR. FUTERFAS:

Well, if I understand Your

2

Honor's question, certainly the time -- if the application

3

is filed and it contains barred claims -- that's -- under

4

the hypothetical it contains barred claims, the time is

5

tolling.

6

question is to suggest that if we don't -- if it's not

7

tolling, and the defendant's petition in State court

8

contains barred claims, and there's not tolling

9

occurring --

I think the best way I can answer Your Honor's

10

QUESTION:

Right.

11

MR. FUTERFAS:

-- then this Court's decisions,

12

for example in the Coleman case, where this Court has a

13

whole body of law governing cause in prejudice or

14

miscarriage of justice, that will essentially almost be

15

rendered a nullity, because yes, a defendant can have --

16

can be procedurally barred, and procedurally defaulted,

17

and have waived everything, and not really present a good

18

procedural picture when it gets to the Federal court.

19

But at least under Coleman, and the other

20

decisions of this Court, at least when the defendant gets

21

there, if the defendant can prove cause in prejudice, if

22

the defendant can show a miscarriage of justice, then a

23

Federal habeas court can overlook those procedural

24

defaults and still reach the merits.

25

However, if, under the State -- if the State's
36

1

rule is adopted, the State determines that there's

2

procedural bar, it makes that determination a year

3

after -- you know, after 1 year has passed, now the whole

4

jurisprudence allowing delving into the merits on cause in

5

prejudice will not happen, because now the State prisoner

6

can't even get before a Federal court because the

7

statute's been tolled.

8
9

QUESTION:

The significance of the procedural --

of the bar decision in State court is that you have to

10

show cause in prejudice when you come into Federal court

11

before those claims could be reached, don't you?

12

MR. FUTERFAS:

Well, you -- in -- I'm not -- I

13

apologize, I'm not sure I understand Your Honor's question

14

--

15

QUESTION:

Well, perhaps my question -- I think

16

Justice Ginsburg asked, you know, then what is the State

17

court determination that a claim is procedurally barred

18

reduced to if it doesn't have any effect of tolling.

19

Well, it still has an effect on the Federal court's

20

ability to review the merits of the claim, doesn't it?

21

MR. FUTERFAS:

22

QUESTION:

23

Yes.

Because unless the person can show

cause in prejudice the Federal court can't reach it.

24

MR. FUTERFAS:

25

QUESTION:

No, that's right.

Yes -37

MR. FUTERFAS:

We understand that, but that

2

assumes, obviously, that the defendant can file, and that

3

the tolling is occurring, so the defendant can at least

4

get into the door in Federal court and try at least to

5

avail himself or herself of the Coleman doctrine.

6

There were -- there was a question of

7

petitioner, I believe by Justice Souter concerning whether

8

or not the statute would be mooted.

9

essence of the question, and we suggest that it would be.

I think that was the

10

If -- I think we can safely assume that adoption of the

11

State's rule would encourage protective filings.

12

The result will be, we respectfully submit, as

13

if Congress said there's a 1-year limitations period which

14

is tolled where a Federal court finds a mixed petition,

15

because that essentially will be the result, the practical

16

result of adoption of the State's rule.

17

The -- there were concerns certainly raised in

18

petitioner's brief about vexatiousness, about a defendant

19

who's going to file and file and try to basically abuse

20

the State court system.

21

case.

22

First, we don't have that in this

Mr. Bennett filed only two post conviction

23

applications.

A second 440 is the one that's here before

24

this Court, and there's no question he wasn't trying to

25

delay.

Right in that second application he cited 2254, he
38

1

wrote in the application that I'm doing this to exhaust.

2

When he didn't get a decision quickly, within a couple of

3

months, he actually wrote to the courts.

4

court and he said, when am I getting a decision, and he

5

continued writing, and --

6
7

QUESTION:

MR. FUTERFAS:

No, it did not, so in terms of

delay, Mr. Bennett --

10
11

Did the State court here ever issue a

written order?

8
9

He wrote to the

QUESTION:

To this date we have no written order

from the State court?

12

MR. FUTERFAS:

That's correct, so the delay here

13

has been a 4-year delay, but the 4 years is in truth

14

attributable to the State.

15

that there was actually a decision, something he didn't

16

learn until a year after the decision took place, he

17

immediately, 3 days later he wrote to the court and he

18

said, please get me written order so that I can at least

19

seek leave to appeal.

20

Once Mr. Bennett found out

And again, this is inconsistent -- consistent

21

with this Court's rule in O'Sullivan, which says, if you

22

want to exhaust you have to try, at least seek leave to

23

appeal on these claims that you're trying to exhaust, and

24

he did so.

25

again.

He wrote to the court.

He wrote again and

All of 1997 was utilized by him writing four or
39

1

five letters to the court saying, when am I getting a

2

decision.

3

It was only until February of '98, after '97 had

4

gone, that he finally went in on 2254 and in his habeas

5

petition itself -- he wrote to Judge Gershon.

6

it says, well, why haven't you appealed, and he said

7

because the State hasn't given me the order, so this case

8

certainly is not a question of delay.

9

In the form

This is a defendant who clearly did try to

10

exhaust, and there's no question here that he complied

11

with New York's filing requirements, filed his motion.

12

The State responded, he filed the reply, and the court

13

eventually ruled.

14

properly filed document here within the meaning of New

15

York State's filing rules.

There's no question that there wasn't a

16

With respect, however, to the vexatiousness

17

concerns that the petitioners have addressed in their

18

brief, we think there are a number of answers to that.

19

One answer is that properly filed application only permits

20

tolling.

21

repetitive filings.

22

paternalistic, and I don't think we should suggest to

23

States -- there may be some States who say, you know, we

24

have no problem with successive applications.

25

need to amend our laws because we have no problem with

4

going to amend our laws.

5

6

the numbers of successive filings so --

7

QUESTION:

We're

We're going to put strict

Of course, counsel, the States draw a

8

distinction between noncapital cases and capital cases.

9

It's always in the petitioner's interest to get prompt

10

disposition when he's not -- in a nondeath case.

11

death case, the stakes are reversed, and there is a motive

12

-- a potential for repetitive filing just to delay the

13

execution, so maybe you should address the capital cases,

14

too.

15

MR. FUTERFAS:

Very well.

In a

concerned with delays in capital cases.

19

concern.

20

Commission.

21

report called the Powell Commission report.

22

findings were embodied in very large part in Chapter 154,

23

so delays in capital cases is something that Congress has

24

been concerned about.

25

The first answer is that Congress was very
That wasn't a new

In 1989, the Chief Justice appointed the Powell
The Powell Commission assembled, wrote a
Those

They -- a commission was -- dealt with it, and
41

1

they recommendations of that commission were largely

2

incorporated in Chapter 154, so with respect to death

3

penalty cases, one thing is for sure, Congress said yes,

4

we're concerned about it and we have an answer, and our

5

answer is the opt-in provision, so if States comply with

6

the opt-in provision, they get the one collateral review,

7

and they have 180 days to go to Federal court, with some

8

exceptions, so that's clearly -- Congress has dealt with

9

that, number 1.

10
11

Number 2, States can always set an execution
date, and in that regard --

12

QUESTION:

How many States have opted in?

13

MR. FUTERFAS:

At this point I'm not aware of

14

any that have adopted -- opted in at this point, but that

15

was Congress' -- that was Congress' considered judgment on

16

the issue and I respectfully submit that this statute, a

17

tolling statute, should not be judicially amended in order

18

to somehow satisfy States that for whatever reason have

19

not adopted in -- opted into the -- to Chapter 154.

20

In addition, this Court's decision in Gomez is

21

very important, because it sets an incentive for

22

defendants.

23

is, the defendant did abuse the State court system and

24

started bringing last minute claims, new claims on the eve

25

of the execution, and finally came before this Court and

What happened in Gomez, this Court may recall

42

1

said, well, please grant me a stay, and this Court in

2

Gomez said no.

3

you've let too much time gone by, you haven't properly

4

presented your claims, we're not going to give you a stay.

5

You've abused the State court process,

So the Gomez decision provides an enormous

6

incentive on a capital defendant to use the State court

7

process wisely and not abuse it.

8
9

Rule 9(a) -- Rule 9(a) of 2254 talks about
laches.

There again, where a defendant abuses a State

10

court system, and the State can come in and say, you know,

11

defendant abused the State system.

12

because so much time has gone by.

13

themselves of Rule 9(a) and preclude a defendant from

14

filing.

15

Now we are prejudiced
Courts can avail

We respectfully submit that problematic

16

defendants, defendants who are abusing State court

17

systems, that's an ad hoc problem and it can be dealt with

18

on an ad hoc basis.

19

cases where clearly petitioners maybe with mental problems

20

that filed 40 or 50 or 60 applications with this Court,

21

that's an ad hoc problem, and this Court took ad hoc

22

measures and said with respect to those defendants we will

23

not grant an in forma pauperis application, so there are

24

many measures --

25

QUESTION:

This Court, even in some of those

But it still is the case that if a
43

1

State has not opted in and a petitioner wishes to simply

2

continue the tolling period he can make repeated filings

3

in the State and if a district judge prefers not to hear

4

the habeas petition he can just simply wait.

5

MR. FUTERFAS:

The -- I think there is a

6

theoretical possibility of a defendant filing repetitive

7

applications for whatever reason to toll the time that the

8

defendant has to go into Federal court.

9

clearly is a theoretical possibility.

I think that
In practical

10

effect, practical effect I think most defendants who are

11

noncapital defendants are going to have an incentive to

12

get their claims dealt with promptly, number 1.

13

Number 2, if that happens, the State can --

14

State judge can simply send an order to the clerk's

15

office, do not accept this defendant's applications either

16

without leave of court, or simply don't accept them any

17

more.

18

In death penalty cases, a State can say, we've

19

had enough of this, we're setting an execution date, and

20

that will force the defendant to go straight to Federal

21

court, so I think there are a lot of ways to deal with the

22

vexatious litigant.

23

And also, keep in mind that even though tolling

24

occurs, that during the periods of time that there is no

25

tolling, that the clock is running, so if defendant files
44

1

an application and the application is denied, and then a

2

month later files another one, or 2 months later, that

3

time is going to toll, but I think these are ad hoc

4

problems, and that State courts are certainly

5

well-equipped.

6

If a State determines that there is a general,

7

more general delay problem the State, under our version of

8

the rule, has absolute freedom to adopt any kind of

9

procedure the State wishes to do, whether it's timing

10

requirements or successiveness limitations.

11

2244(b)(3) is a wonderful model that States could follow.

12

They could set up a system where, under successive

13

application, the State prisoner must obtain judicial

14

review first, or approval first to file, so there is a

15

whole panoply, really, of options available to a State to

16

deal with these problems.

17

In fact,

One concern that we suggest occurs with respect,

18

however, to the interplay between 153 and 154 is the

19

following hypothetical.

20

penalty case, the State opts in, the defendant gets an

21

attorney, a competent attorney, the defendant gets one

22

run-through of the State collateral review process, and

23

there's no question that they can bring up any claim they

24

want, there's no suggestion in the State's briefs that

25

they're limited on what kinds of claims they can bring up

If a State opts in, in a death

45

1

in that one review process, be it procedurally barred

2

claims or otherwise, when that petition is disposed of,

3

they have 180 days to get into Federal court.

4

Now watch what could happen with a death penalty

5

defendant if the State's rule is adopted, because under

6

153, the death penalty defendant now is convicted, files a

7

post application, post conviction application, does -- may

8

or may not have a lawyer, because the State has not opted

9

in, and it turns out all of the claims in the post

10

conviction application are procedurally barred and more

11

than 1 year has gone by.

12

The defendant, who is not represented because

13

the State has not opted in, now has lost his or her right

14

to even get into Federal court on a habeas, so that's a

15

possibility with the State's view of the rule.

16

If I may just have a moment.

17

The other cases that we respectfully suggest the

18

State's rule conflicts with are this Court's decision in

19

Rose v. Lundy.

20

application should be dismissed.

21

well, we can kind of modify Rose v. Lundy and say that the

22

application will be held in abeyance, but Rose v. Lundy

23

says no, it should be dismissed.

24

application is dismissed, and 1 year passes, that

25

defendant could be deprived of going into Federal court.

Rose said that an application, the mixed

46

The State suggests,

Of course, if the

1

The O'Sullivan decision was just decided a year

2

ago says the defendants must bring all their claims --

3

must seek leave to bring their claims to the highest court

4

in the State.

5

this case, Tony Bennett's case, is O'Sullivan, because

6

here Tony Bennett is, having lost in the trial court, now

7

is trying to seek leave to the Appellate Division, Second

8

Department, hasn't received the order for 4 years in which

9

to do so, so he's trying to comply with O'Sullivan.

10

There again, this is exactly, actually,

But meanwhile, the clock is running, and under

11

the State's rule -- well, because the trial court

12

determined that his claims are procedurally barred, he's

13

already lost his right to get into Federal court, even

14

though at the same time O'Sullivan says you must be trying

15

to seek leave and appeal your petitions in order to

16

exhaust, so there's a conflict there as well.

17

Finally, this Court's decision in Lonchar v.

18

Thomas, this Court said that dismissal of the first habeas

19

corpus is a very serious matter, and any rule that would

20

deprive a first habeas corpus application should be clear

21

and fair.

22

habeases or second habeases, or first post conviction

23

applications or second post conviction applications, so we

24

respectfully submit that the State's rule is inconsistent

25

as well with this Court's considered judgment and

There's no limitation in 2244(d)(2) as to first

47

1

pronouncements in Lonchar v. Thomas.

And if no Justices have any further questions, I
will submit.
