ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA McDOWELL

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MS. McDOWELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The assessments imposed under the Mushroom

12

Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information Act do not

13

abridge the freedom of speech of any mushroom producer.

14

No producer is restrained by the Act from communicating

15

any message to any audience, no producer is compelled to

16

speak, and no producer is compelled to fund the expression

17

of others' political or ideological views.

18

producers are simply required to contribute to the costs

19

of a program of commercial speech and other activities

20

designed to further the economic interests of their own

21

industry.

22

QUESTION:

23

MS. McDOWELL:

Mushroom

Not in their view?
Not entirely, Your Honor, no, but

24

Congress is entitled in this sort of economic program to

25

make the determination that the interests of the industry

1

as a whole would benefit from such a program.

2

QUESTION:

Well, you speak of the economic

3

program.

4

program requiring contributions to this advertising

5

scheme?

6

What is the economic program other than the

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, the program is not limited

7

to advertising, Justice Souter.

As the title of the

8

statute suggests, it's promotion, research, and consumer

9

education, so the programs authorized by the Mushroom

10

Council can and in some instances do include more than

11

advertising.

12

QUESTION:

But I take it it's your position that

13

if it were solely confined to advertising, it would be

14

constitutional nonetheless.

15

MS. McDOWELL:

That's correct, Justice Kennedy,

16

as long as Congress has a legitimate interest in

17

strengthening the market for a particular agricultural

18

commodity, Congress is entitled under Wileman to enact

19

this sort of program and impose it upon an industry.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

Is this commercial speech that is

within the First Amendment for some purposes?
MS. McDOWELL:

Yes, it is, commercial speech.

23

Certainly if an individual producer was engaging in the

24

same sort of message, the Government would be constrained

25

by the commercial speech doctrine from restricting the

speech.

2

QUESTION:

So your position is that in some

3

instances industries or persons can be compelled to

4

contribute to commercial speech when there is no other

5

program that's connected with it?

6

MS. McDOWELL:

That's correct.

Of course, such

7

programs are subject to other constitutional constraints,

8

such as rational basis considerations and --

9

QUESTION:

10

ideological speech.

11

suppose I am a member of the People for the Ethical

12

Treatment of Mushrooms, and I think that mushrooms should

13

not be eaten at all, can I be compelled to take part in

14

this advertising?

15

And you say it can't cover
What is ideological speech?

MS. McDOWELL:

I mean,

Well, then presumably you

16

wouldn't be a mushroom producer and you wouldn't be

17

covered by this statute.

19

QUESTION:
happy.

20

Oh, no, I produce them to make them

I just don't harvest them.
MS. McDOWELL:

Well, I still think in those

21

circumstances you would be outside the statute because you

22

wouldn't be selling them for consumption.

QUESTION:

On the other

Would it be ideological?

is this ideological line that you're drawing?

I mean what
I mean,

1

what if I feel adamantly about a free market and this

2

advertising is slanting the market?

3

that as an ideological matter a free market is a good

4

thing.

5

MS. McDOWELL:

I feel passionately

It's a line that the Court drew

6

in Wileman Brothers itself contrasting those sorts of

7

objections of fruit producers with the kinds of objections

8

that were asserted in cases like Abood and Keller,

9

objections to, for example, a nuclear freeze initiative

10

that the California bar had supported or contributions to

11

political candidates in the Abood context.

12
13

QUESTION:

So nuclear freezes and political

candidates are ideological.

14

MS. McDOWELL:

Those would clearly fall on that

15

side of the line, whereas --

QUESTION:

MS. McDOWELL:

QUESTION:

MS. McDOWELL:

Free economy is not?
Pardon me?

Free economy is not?
Well, certainly respondent and

20

others are free, notwithstanding the Mushroom Act to

21

express their own views about the benefits of a free

22

economy.

23

QUESTION:

Ms. McDowell, I take it you're making

24

a point that in that respect it's no different from

25

Wileman, but you've gotten away from a point that you

1

started on when Justice Kennedy put a question to you.

2

You of course are trying to make this as much like Wileman

3

as you can.

4

was in that one, other than the advertising?

5

statute authorizes research and something else you

6

mentioned, but in fact is anything going on other than the

7

advertising?

8
9

Is there anything in this program, as there

MS. McDOWELL:

You said the

Yes, in fact, Justice Ginsburg,

other programs are going on.

There has been research into

10

the nutritional and health benefits of mushrooms, there's

11

a considerable amount of working with grocery store

12

managers in terms of the placement of mushrooms, safe

13

storage of mushrooms, other programs of that nature, but

14

probably the bulk of the expenditures of the program to

15

date have been for public relations and publicity-type

16

activities, but there are other activities going on here

17

as well.

18

QUESTION:

Is it correct, as your opponent in

19

the red brief says, that there are actually two different

20

rather dramatically different kinds of programs in the

21

Department of Agriculture and that this is not in the same

22

group that the one in Wileman was involved in?

23

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, it's true, Justice Stevens,

24

that the program in Wileman Brothers was authorized under

25

the Agricultural Marketing Agreements Act and programs

1

authorized under that Act sometimes, in most cases, in

2

fact, do include other regulations, but there are some 11

3

promotion, research, and consumer information programs

4

that are quite similar to this one, including the ones in

5

the beef, pork, and cotton industries.

6

programs in different years involved different components

7

of research, consumer information, and promotion.

8

would be difficult to draw a line between which were more

9

and less like the ones in Wileman Brothers.

All of these

10

QUESTION:

But did those --

11

QUESTION:

I presume you can be forced to

So it

12

contribute to a program that is clearly against your

13

economic interests.

14

you're compelled to contribute to an advertising program

15

promoting yellowish peaches whereas you're growing orangey

16

peaches.

17

I mean, you're a peach grower and

You could be compelled to do that?
MS. McDOWELL:

Well, that was certainly one of

18

the complaints that was raised in Wileman Brothers, and it

19

wasn't given constitutional significance.

20

QUESTION:

So your answer is yes?

21

MS. McDOWELL:

Presumably Congress could

22

determine that there were benefits to be obtained to the

23

entire industry by promotion that focused at least in one

24

year on particular products.

25

QUESTION:

And make you contribute to the saying

that my competitor's product is better than mine?

2

MS. McDOWELL:

Presumably Congress could do

3

that, Justice Scalia, but that's not what this program

4

does.

5

QUESTION:

But in Wileman, the argument, I

6

didn't think it was a persuasive one, but the argument

7

that carried the day in Wileman was that the restrictions

8

on speech, which I agree fall within Justice Scalia's hypo

9

were justified because they were incidental to and they

10

were germane to what was a true act of market regulation.

11

There was regulation by quality control on what could be

12

marketed, and there was regulation in terms of quantity

13

that could be marketed.

14

features in this case?

15

MS. McDOWELL:

Now, I take it there are no such

That's correct, but I would

16

disagree with your premise that there were quantity

17

controls in Wileman Brothers.

18

only quality and maturity controls.

19

QUESTION:

There weren't.

I'm sorry, you're right.

There were

The

20

standards for bringing fruit to market were in Wileman,

21

you're right.

22

MS. McDOWELL:

Yes.

We don't think that those

23

differences in regulation make any difference with respect

24

to the First Amendment interests that are implicated here.

25

QUESTION:

Well, what do you make of the

1

germaneness argument in Wileman and its relation to this

2

case?

3

Wileman was that the restrictions were germane to these

4

other market regulatory activities, and what you have

5

described as the Government's activities here seem to be

6

entirely either advertising or other promotional

7

activities.

8

managers where to put the mushrooms in the stores.

9

mean, that isn't market regulation. It's, I would say it's

I mean, it's got to be germane, the argument in

You said, well, they tell the produce
I

10

simply promotion, teaching them how to sell mushrooms.

11

I don't see that there is anything to which this is

12

germane which is comparable to the scheme in Wileman.

13

QUESTION:

Ms. McDowell, is that perhaps why you

14

raise an alternative argument, that this, in fact, is

15

Government speech?

16
17
18

So

MS. McDOWELL:

We had raised that alternative

argument, Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION:

And is it because of this problem

19

that you've been listening to this morning that it doesn't

20

appear to be part of a broader regulatory program?

MS. McDOWELL:

argument because we think it's also a viable argument.

23

QUESTION:

24

MS. McDOWELL:

25

We raised the Government speech

Was that argument made below?
No, it wasn't made below.

We

believe that it's encompassed by the question presented in

1

our petition, and that the Court has the discretion to

2

reach that question if it wants to.

3
4

QUESTION:

And are you going to address it in

your argument?

5

MS. McDOWELL:

Yes, I will, if I could just

6

return briefly to Justice Souter's question because I

7

think our argument in Wileman Brothers and how we read the

8

Court's opinion is not that the generic advertising

9

program has to be germane to some separate regulatory

10
11
12
13

program.
QUESTION:

Then why did the court spend all the

time that it did discussing germaneness?
MS. McDOWELL:

Well, as we understand the

14

Court's opinion, the Court was saying that the generic

15

advertising program was germane to Congress's interest in

16

strengthening and stabilizing the market for an

17

agricultural product, and that's precisely the same

18

interest --

19

QUESTION:

So in that case then you're simply

20

saying that the advertising scheme was in effect germane

21

to a general scheme of addressing the desirability of

22

marketing this material, and that seems to me to read the

23

germaneness requirement right out of, you know, right out

24

of any significance.

25

MS. McDOWELL:

We would disagree.

We think that

in both this case and Wileman Brothers there was a

legitimate nonspeech purpose for the regulation, and that

was strengthening and stabilizing the market for a

commodity.

It wasn't there and it isn't here simply to

QUESTION:

Well, if you're -- I'm sorry.

7

QUESTION:

Couldn't at least one read -- there

8

may be ambiguity in it, but Wileman to have alternative

9

arguments that is one is the germaneness thing, but then I

10

think the Court used expressions like in any event, which

11

sounds like that's a self-standing ground, that it wasn't

12

necessary to have both, if it had either, it would do.

13

MS. McDOWELL:

The opinion certainly can be read

14

in that manner, and here, as in Wileman Brothers, there is

15

no political or ideological content to the speech.

16

QUESTION:

Ms. McDowell, if germaneness to a

17

Government regulatory program is irrelevant, how do you

18

explain the limitations we've placed upon compulsory union

19

dues?

20

to union activities other than those of representing the

21

employees so long as those other union activities are not

22

ideological?

23

Could a union compel nonunion members to contribute

MS. McDOWELL:

Yes, the Court has so held in

24

cases such as Lehnert where the Court allowed nonmembers'

25

dues to be used to fund certain union programs which were

not ideological and were not particularly germane to the

2

purpose of collective bargaining but were nonetheless

3

considered to be permissible.

4

QUESTION:

So the line gets back to ideology

5

again, and I do want you to address the Government speech

6

argument Justice O'Connor -- let me, just one

7

hypothetical.

8
9

Suppose that the Government decides that kids
are spending too much money on designer clothes, and they

10

want them to buy generic clothes, and because they're

11

causing jealousy in the high schools and all that stuff,

12

so the Government has a huge advertising campaign, buy

13

generic clothes, but assesses all the clothing

14

manufacturers, including the designers, is that

15

ideological?

16

MS. McDOWELL:

We would still view that I think

17

as a commercial message, but it would be somewhat more

18

problematic because the clothing producers would be

19

required to fund a program that's directly contrary to

20

their interests.

21

QUESTION:

But you're controlling consumer

22

tastes, demands, attitudes.

This it seems to me, is

23

something that our culture, rightly or wrongly, is very

24

interested in, and you're saying that the Government can

MS. McDOWELL:

It's a somewhat more difficult

question than this one, Justice Kennedy, I will agree with

you.

interest, it might well be permissible.

8

apply, and it might not seem rational to single out the

clothing producers in this instance for that sort of an

If there is a sufficiently important Government

assessment.

It seems much more rational to impose an

11

assessment on those members of the industry that benefit.

12

QUESTION:

Oh, so now you have to have some

13

special Government interest?

14

MS. McDOWELL:

15

QUESTION:

Pardon me?

Now you have to have some special

16

Government interest, some compelling interest that the

17

Government is accomplishing?

18

MS. McDOWELL:

Perhaps an important interest

19

under the Abood standard if one is to view this as

ideological speech.

QUESTION:

Do you know the last case in which a

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, the Court certainly has

done that in instances where the group singled out the

taxation was, for example, the media, but obviously the

hypothetical posited by Justice Kennedy wouldn't involve

that.

11

QUESTION:

I think we deflected Justice

O'Connor's question about Government speech.

12

MS. McDOWELL:

I was about to get back to that,

13

thank you.

It's our view that the speech here is speech

14

of the Government, funded by taxes or user fees on those

15

who are perceived by Congress to benefit the most from the

16

speech.

17

QUESTION:

But does the tax apply to everybody

MS. McDOWELL:

Pardon me?

Is the tax imposed on every producer

Yes or no.

7

MS. McDOWELL:

8

QUESTION:

9

MS. McDOWELL:

No, no.

Okay.
And indeed Congress perceived the

10

statute to benefit the entire agricultural industry, and

11

indeed the entire agricultural industry does not pay those

12

assessments, either, but Congress determined that the

13

major mushroom producers would be the ones who benefited

14

the most, and the vast majority of the industry does

15

contribute to the assessments.

16

QUESTION:

Well, how about our old Butler case

17

you know, in 1936, where there was a tax on processors

18

that the Court held was unconstitutional because it was

19

misdirected.

20

anymore, but certainly you've got some problem with a tax

21

which is imposed on some people but benefits a lot of

22

other people.

23

Now, then the case may not be good law

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, Congress could reasonably

24

determine that the costs of imposing the tax on the very,

25

very small producers would exceed the benefits of doing

so.

For example, under the current assessment of a

2

quarter cent per pound of mushrooms produced, the smaller

3

producers, those who are exempt, would pay at most $1250 a

4

year, and that's really a very small amount.

5

QUESTION:

If you treat this as simply a tax

6

thing, a tax scheme, that's probably our most lenient

7

standard of review, but you have the commercial speech

8

cases which talk about an intermediate level of scrutiny

9

well above even ordinary rational basis.

10

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, that's correct, but we

11

don't believe that the commercial speech cases, Central

12

Hudson, and so on are applicable here because we're not

13

talking about restrictions on anyone's speech or

14

regulations of speech.

program that imposes a tax or user fee for the purpose of

encouraging more consumer speech, not less.

QUESTION:

Is there any message here other than

Well, that argument's rejected in

Rather, we're talking about a

-- mushrooms are so good for you? I

mean, I thought that that was your central point, that

unlike Central Hudson, this is not a restriction on what

anybody can say.

25

MS. McDOWELL:

2

QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.

The argument you just made, that the

3

Government is paying to have more speech was exactly the

4

argument we reject in Buckley where the campaign finance

5

rule that we struck down said, you know, we need to hear

6

from more people, not less, and so we're going to restrict

7

some people's speech, and the courts refused to go along

8

with that.

9

MS. McDOWELL:

Yes, in contrast to Buckley,

10

though, this isn't a program that restricts people's

11

speech, that limits how much mushroom producers can speak.

12

They are free to speak as much as they want to. They are

13

only required to contribute money to this program in

14

addition so that there can be generic speech.

15

QUESTION:

What is our closest case that

16

supports this kind of fee to pay for some kind of

17

Government-designed speech?

18

MS. McDOWELL:

What do you rely on?

I'm not sure that we have any

19

case of this Court that involves a targeted fee to pay for

20

a Government speech program.

21

recognized, although not necessarily relied as a holding

22

on the principle that the Government isn't subject to the

23

constraints of the First Amendment when it speaks on its

24

own behalf, and the Court has recognized that all

25

Government programs don't have to be funded through

general tax revenues but can be targeted, can be funded

2

through a variety of user fees and other targeted taxes.

3

QUESTION:

Well, I'm not sure it would be a

4

stable or a workable line, but it does seem to me that

5

there's not much we can do about Government speech, but

6

maybe at least we can say it has to be funded by general

7

revenues and not from a targeted group that objects to it.

8
9

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, that would obviously be a

line could you draw, Justice Kennedy.

There are some

10

cases that have similar aspects, where the Government has

11

imposed a user fee on individual speakers, for example in

12

the context of the Cox case, the Court recognized that

13

user fees could be imposed to reimburse local Government

14

for the costs of administering parades, and so there seems

15

to be nothing inconsistent with the First Amendment with

16

requiring special taxes or assessments for speech

17

activity.

18

QUESTION:

Is there anything --

QUESTION:

May I ask, if the Government has made

20

this argument, and there have been a bunch of these cases

21

involving different programs, meat and pears and so on.

22

Has the Government made the Government speech argument in

23

any of these other cases?

Yes, we made the argument in the

case, the Wileman case, saying that the Government said

11

they would lose if it were not a marketing program like

12

this, is that a correct statement?

13

MS. McDOWELL:

No, it's not a correct statement,

14

Your Honor.

What we said was that if the Court didn't

15

recognize that there was an important purpose to be served

16

by these programs, we would lose, but we didn't tie our

argument in Wileman to the existence of additional

to apply in these cases, and under Abood the speech

were arguing that the purpose was at least important.

would argue, of course, that the purpose of the Mushroom

QUESTION:

A subterranean group, no doubt.

3

MS. McDOWELL:

To get back to the Government

speech argument, we would emphasize that the Mushroom

5

Council, the entity that engages in this speech, was

6

created specially by Congress, Congress specified that the

7

Secretary of Agriculture would appoint all members of the

8

Mushroom Council, Congress specified the categories of

9

activities in which the Mushroom Council could and could

10

not engage and Congress provided that the Secretary of

11

Agriculture would have to approve each plan, project, and

12

budgeted the Mushroom Council before it was --

13

QUESTION:

Well, what's the case or the rule or

14

the line of doctrine that says speech interests can be

abridged because there's an important, as opposed to

simply a rational, Government interest?

17

like a new line of cases.

18

MS. McDOWELL:

That sounds to me

Well, we would suggest that this

19

particular program doesn't involve any infringement of

20

speech interests at all.

21

there are some First Amendment interests --

were nominated by members of the mushroom industry to

MS. McDOWELL:

Such complaints can certainly be

voiced to the Secretary of Agriculture as well. There's

not a mechanism, for example, for obtaining a refund for

this sort of expression with which one might disagree, but

5

there are avenues for expressing objections.

MR. TRIBE:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Because something in this case does appear to

21

turn on whether merely rationality review is appropriate

22

or whether one needs something more important, we would

23

suggest very much more important since we do think this is

24

a free speech case, I wanted to begin with Justice

25

Scalia's question, is there anything that Congress does
25

1

that is not important.

2

I think it's a question, however couched, that

3

one really has to address in the context of these programs

4

because, as the Solicitor General mentioned, there are a

5

dozen programs in which Congress has essentially provided

6

for the Government to mandate that growers and producers

7

pay for advertisement and then although there is some

8

other informational stuff, that's the core of it, and in

9

this case, as we point out in footnote 7 of our brief,

10

it's 98 percent of it.

11

These other programs are really quite haphazard.

12

They cover blueberries but not raspberries. They don't

13

cover strawberries.

They cover avocados, not artichokes.

14

They cover popcorn.

At 1996 Congress found specifically

15

that popcorn has all of the characteristics of mushrooms

16

vital to the economy, and indeed it was in 1996 determined

17

by Congress that canola is even more important to the

18

survival of the economy and yet no canola program was put

19

in place, and maybe that explains why problems are

20

occurring.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Tribe, how does that differ from

22

some tree fruits that were covered and others weren't in

1

Justice pointed out in his concurring opinion in the

2

Greater New Orleans case, the various haphazard features

3

of the commercial regulation there, of commercial speech

4

might have been constitutionally tolerable if Congress had

5

undertaken substantively to regulate the gambling

6

industry.

7

That's a very fundamental difference.
Of course, one finds a crazy quilt pattern and

8

one doesn't inspect Congress' findings when merely

9

rationality is involved, but if we are to accept the

10

Government's theory, and I want to turn to Government

11

speech in a moment, if we're to accept the Government's

12

theory that whenever there is an interest, not a program,

13

not a regulatory regime, nothing like collective

14

bargaining or a labor union with an integrated set of

15

obligations or an integrated bar, as in the Keller case,

16

but just an interest, like the interest in not having kids

17

waste too much money on designer clothes.

18

can posit an interest in the air and then you can find

19

speech that would advance that interest, that's all you

need.

should turn to whether this is speech for which the

2

Government bears responsibility because it seems to me

3

that in all of your cases, whether the ultimate vehicle

4

for the speech is the tobacco council or the Government,

5

it's the Government's message.

6

say that we're going to take money from private

7

enterprise, private individuals, we're going to give it to

other private individuals so that they can compose a

message, like a message that brands don't make any

It's quite different to

difference, if you've seen one mushroom, you've seen them

11

all, a message which is very much opposed to the interest

12

of those who are forced to pay.

13

Now, if this were Government speech, where

14

Government is accountable to the people, a principle like

15

Justice Kennedy, saying that as long as the beneficiaries

are the ones who are taxed might suffice, but let me turn

17

to whether it's Government speech because I think when we

get back to the question of whether it can survive on any

other theory, it will be fairly clear that it cannot.

MR. TRIBE:

description is that the agricultural marketing service

17

only reviews materials to ensure that they are in

compliance with the applicable legislative authority. I

19

don't know if one could construe this statute to make the

Secretary of Agriculture assume a purely editorial

capacity, I rather doubt it, but clearly no such

construction has been suggested by the agency that

MR. TRIBE:

Justice Breyer, I think there is a

tire makers to simply advertise that they have been

inspected by the Government and the tire makers are

21

required to do that.

MR. TRIBE:

Well, I wouldn't minimize the

2

importance of the slippery slope, but I'm not sure that

3

the advertisement of the fact, the mere fact that you've

been inspected by the Government is anything more than

5

requiring you to be a vehicle for Government speech, and

having the Government force them to speak, to limit the

14

Government's power with respect to mandating speech or

mandating the funding of speech to cases where the

the Court that the issue here is principally whether this

whether it is bad under the First Amendment.

the justification for the smoking example, as you put it,

Whether this program

whether it is ancillary to something, that is, it's not a

question of exactly what all the bells and whistles look

like in the regulatory program for nectarines and peaches.

13

It was clear, as this Court repeatedly

14

emphasized, including in the section of the opinion

15

explaining why the Central Hudson framework didn't fit, it

16

was clear that the fundamental structure of the program

was to replace individual choice and competition with

collectivization, and when you do that, the premises of

Central Hudson don't work, and when you collectivize,
