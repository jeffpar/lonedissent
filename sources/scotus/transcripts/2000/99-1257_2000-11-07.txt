ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL SETH P. WAXMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

There are two principal issues in this first

12

case and, with the Court's leave, I'll address each in

13

turn.

14

nondelegation doctrine.

15

First, the Clean Air Act does not violate the

The Act prescribes the following:

EPA must set

16

national ambient air quality standards for a limited set

17

of ubiquitous pollutants.

18

to protect public health with an adequate margin of

19

safety.

20

latest scientific knowledge about the identifiable effects

21

of the pollutant in the ambient air, and the administrator

22

must consult an independent body of scientific experts and

23

explain any significant departure from its

24

recommendations.

25

The standards must be requisite

They must be based on criteria that reflect the

For 30 years, successive administrators have
3

1

applied the Act's terms consistently.

2

sufficient, but not more than necessary to protect public

3

health with an adequate margin of safety.

4

Requisite means

Public health addresses not all biological

5

effects, and not even all medical effects, but only those

6

adverse health effects that threaten populations.

7

identifiable effects means those that are shown to exist

8

not hypothesized.

9
10
11

And

The Court of Appeals --

QUESTION:

Did those effects have to be

medically significant?
MR. WAXMAN:

They do; that is, the legislative

12

history -- says that they must be adverse, which the

13

administrator and the Court of Appeals means medically

14

significant.

15

significant to a sufficient population to constitute a

16

public health effect.

17

Now, they have to be also medically

The Court of Appeals held that the Constitution

18

requires more, specifically the articulation of what it

19

called a determinate criterion to govern the setting of

20

the precise standard for each pollutant.

21

to this Court's precedents which require that the Court

22

articulate only an intelligible principle or, as the Court

23

has otherwise put it, that the Court delineate the general

24

policy, the public agency that is to accomplish it, and

25

the boundaries of the delegated authority.
4

That is contrary

1

QUESTION:

2

intelligible principle here?

3
4

MR. WAXMAN:

And in simplest terms, what is the

I believe I can say it in one

sentence, Justice O'Connor.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. WAXMAN:

Good.

Okay.

For a discrete set of pollutants

7

and based on published air quality criteria that reflect

8

the latest scientific knowledge, EPA must establish

9

uniform national standards at a level that is requisite to

10

protect public health from the adverse effects of the

11

pollutant in the ambient air.

12

Now that, in our view, means that Congress has

13

made the fundamental policy choices, and it is also

14

articulated both substantive and procedural constraints on

15

EPA's application of the specified standard.

16

Constitution simply does not require more.

17

The

There is a second issue in the case, if I can

18

outline what our position is.

19

QUESTION:

Before you get off the first issue,

20

you say it's easy to say, but, but, but what does

21

requisite to protect public health consist of? I mean,

22

suppose, you know, the scientific evidence indicates that

23

there is some risk beyond -- below a certain level of

24

pollutant in the air, but that risk has not been -- the

25

extent of that risk has not been scientifically
5

1

determined.

2

health?

3

Now, what is requisite to protect the public

Everything above zero risk?
MR. WAXMAN:

No.

Absolutely not.

And let me

4

answer your direct question first, and if I can and if it

5

would be helpful to the Court, quickly outline the steps,

6

the serial steps, that the Agency must go through every

7

time the administrator has to modify it.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, before we get to the steps, I

mean, I don't think that an accumulation of procedures is

10

going to make -- is going to create a criterion that

11

doesn't otherwise exist.

12

you decide how much risk is too much risk, or is that just

13

up to the Agency?

14

MR. WAXMAN:

What is the criterion?

How do

The Agency looks first based on the

15

criteria documents at the identifiable effects.

16

effects that science has identified will happen to people

17

not hypothesized risks about what might happen.

18

number one.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. WAXMAN:

Those are

That's

Okay.
Number two, it then looks at

21

whether those demonstrated effects rise to the level of

22

medical significance, not whether they are -- there is

23

some effect on the biology of a cell, but whether it rises

24

with respect to any person to the level at which a

25

physician applying in this case the standards of the
6

1

American Thoracic Society would determine that that person

2

requires treatment, that that person, if you will, is ill

3

or manifesting a significant medical symptom.

4

QUESTION:

That's easy.

You are talking about

5

demonstrated effects, but my question went to those areas

6

in which we don't know what the effects are.

7

MR. WAXMAN:

8

QUESTION:

9

Well -There is a risk that there may be

some effects, but we do not know what they are. What is

10

requisite to protect the public health?

11

clear what's requisite?

12

MR. WAXMAN:

Has Congress made

Well, requisite has been defined by

13

the Agency, and it's supported both by the legislative

14

history and the D.C. Circuit, to mean sufficient, but not

15

more than necessary.

16

been clearer that zero risk or background levels of a

17

pollutant, that is levels that exist in the ambient air

18

without man-made activity, is not what the administrator

19

is aiming for or what the Act is designed to protect.

20

QUESTION:

That is, the Congress could not have

Okay.

Then what is it?

It's

21

something above zero, but what is it to decide whether the

22

risk is too much risk?

23

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, perhaps I -- if I may,

24

perhaps I can, to answer your question by reference to

25

either or both of the two pollutants that are at issue
7

1

here.

With respect to particulate matter, for example,

2

there was a preexisting standard that was set in 1987.

3

The Agency pursuant to the Act's requirements that the

4

standards be reviewed every five years in light of the

5

latest scientific knowledge went back and collected all of

6

the medical and scientific study and prepared them in a

7

criteria document, which is a multivolume set that is

8

reviewed by CASAC, the independent advisory committee,

9

which agreed that it was what it called the best ever

10

compilation of the health effects of small particulate

11

matter on public health.

12

The EPA then created a -- what is called a staff

13

paper.

14

the data in a series of recommendations.

15

reviewed by CASAC, which agreed that the ranges of

16

concentrations -- and this I think is what you're getting

17

to -- provided the appropriate parameters for the

18

administrator's decision.

19

The staff paper distills the science and organizes
That, too, was

Now, with respect to particulate matter, the

20

staff recommended, and CASAC agreed, that it was important

21

to separately measure particulate, fine particulate

22

matter; that is, matter that is equal to or less than 25

23

micrograms per cubic meter.

24

approval set both the upper bound and the lower bound for

25

the administrator's decision based on what the science

And if the staff with CASAC's

8

1

revealed.

2

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question right there

3

about the CASAC reviews, so called, the scientific

4

committee.

5

to advise the EPA of any adverse public health, welfare,

6

social, economic, or energy effects which may result from

7

various strategies for attainment and maintenance of the

8

national standards. I mean, the statute does require the

9

scientific committee to look at all those things and to

10

I thought the statute required that committee

report it to the EPA.

11

Now, why would Congress want that advice on

12

economic and energy effects if Congress didn't want the

13

EPA to consider those in setting the standards?

14
15

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, a couple of reasons, Justice

O'Connor.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.
First of all, as I think we'll

18

probably address in some detail in the next hour, the EPA

19

uses costs and feasibility standards in many, many of the

20

things that it does, and it uses the information, this

21

information that CASAC provides for that purpose.

22

example, in all -- the Act essentially creates a two-part

23

process.

24

standards that set a floor for ambient air across the

25

whole country and do not apply of their own force to any

For

The first part is the setting of these national

9

1

source of polluting, whether it's me driving my car or the

2

utility plant that generates my power.

3

The second part of the Act is implementation;

4

that is, how do you go about achieving these standards,

5

and the states and EPA have vast authority and discretion

6

to determine how that's done, and costs and other

7

implementation factors, like technological constraints,

8

are used at that point to determine what's reasonable.

9

This Court in Union Electric in 1976 pointed out that

10

costs and technological considerations are amply used in

11

the implementation process, so long as they don't avoid

12

it.

13

QUESTION:

But in your view in looking at the

14

standards governing EPA's setting of these national

15

ambient air quality standards, you think that the EPA may

16

not consider any of these economic or cost factors --

17

MR. WAXMAN:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

Yes, since --- as part of its required

consideration of factors in setting?
MR. WAXMAN:

The legislative history and the

21

text of the '70 Act are absolutely clear, and the EPA and

22

the D.C. Circuit have been unanimous for 30 years that in

23

the first part of the Clean Air Act, that is in setting

24

the standards, the EPA is to consider only what the

25

criteria documents reveal as the effects on public health
10

1

and welfare of the pollutant in the air, and that costs

2

are determined at the implementation phase by the states,

3

by EPA, and by Congress.

4

Now, your point about CASAC, I think is very

5

important to understand.

The CASAC was created in the

6

1977 amendments, and it was directed to do two things, and

7

it's reflected at pages 112-A and 113-A of the appendix to

8

our petition.

9

both the criteria, which I was just discussing, and the

First, in 109(d)(2)(b) it is told to review

10

national ambient air quality standard that EPA proposes in

11

light of its scientific knowledge and what the criteria

12

document reveals, and that is part of the NAAQS

13

standard-setting process, and in this case the CASAC

14

issued what they called closure letters, both with respect

15

to the criteria documents on PM and ozone and with respect

16

to the staff papers on particulate matter and ozone.

17

You have directed my attention to a separate

18

section of the statute which says that such committees

19

shall also, and then it lists a series of things that it

20

should do.

21

implementation technologies, et cetera relates to the

22

implementation process of the standards.

23

example, with respect to the PM and ozone standards, the

24

CASAC has not yet issued any of that information because

25

the Agency has not yet either begun to implement the

That section, the section that relates to

11

The EP -- for

1

eight-hour standard or the 2.5 standard, or indicated in

2

notice and comment rulemaking how it will go about doing

3

that.

4

The provision that you have questioned, Justice

5

O'Connor, ties in perfectly with the provision in -- also

6

in Section 7409, I can't remember which subsection it is,

7

which requires the EP -- or maybe it's Section 7408.

8

any event, I'll explain to you what I have in mind.

In

9

The 1970 Act, which required EPA to set national

10

standards for the first time under the 1967 Act, they were

11

set by the states.

12

to set them by reference to two things that EPA's

13

predecessor, HEW, would supply them.

14

criteria document accumulating the science data on health

15

effects, which is the same thing we have today.

16

second thing was a description of costs, pollution control

17

technologies, feasibility, et cetera, and the '67 Act told

18

the states that they were to conform their standards to

19

both of those documents.

20

In the 1967 Act, the states were told

The first was the

The

Now in 1970, the Congress did two very

21

significant things.

First of all, it gave, it made the

22

requirement to set standards mandatory and upon EPA, that

23

is, on a national basis, so we would have a national

24

floor.

25

to your question is that it separated out the two things

Then the second thing which is really significant

12

1

that EPA was collecting and providing.

2

that EPA was to still do the criteria documents, but that

3

the NAAQS, the national standards, would be based on those

4

criteria documents only, and the Act provides that at the

5

time that the criteria documents are issued, EPA shall

6

also provide to the states and to Congress information

7

about costs, implementation, and available control

8

technologies so that they can use that information in the

9

standard-setting process that this Court reviewed in Union

10

Electric.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. WAXMAN:

13
14

And it provided

I -- were you finished?
I can talk until interrupted, but I

would prefer to answer questions, of course.
QUESTION:

The -- the -- I'm not, don't -- I'm

15

accepting this for the sake of argument only.

Don't

16

assume it's my position.

17

argument on the delegation part, the nondelegation part in

18

light of what you have just said, it seems to me that they

19

are saying that when we look at it, specifically the

20

health part, what we are talking about with ozone is

21

coughing outdoor children.

22

outdoor children we see with .09 in the air, approximately

23

.9 of 1 percent of all the coughing outdoor children will

24

cough and it will hurt.

25

1 percent and if we go to .07, we get .3 of 1 percent.

But the -- if I look at their

And if we look at coughing

And if we go to .08, we get .6 of

13

1

See, it's a line they draw between points.

9, 6, 3.

And

2

they say there is no way to draw, nowhere to stop on that

3

line. Absolutely not.

4

Once you take all costs and these other things

5

out of it, why are you protecting the .6 and not the .3?

6

Why the .3, not the .9?

7

is their main claim on the nondelegation point and so I

8

would like to you respond to that directly.

9

MR. WAXMAN:

That's, I think, what I take it

I do believe it is their main

10

point, and it is -- it fundamentally misconceives both

11

what the Act requires and what every administrator since

12

1970 has done.

13

administrator gets the decision, it gets a staff report

14

validated by CASAC that shows the upper bound and lower

15

bound of where a standard should be set based on the

16

application to the latest scientific knowledge of the

17

standard requisite to protect public health, and in this

18

case, you gave the ozone standard, the standard was at the

19

upper level .09 parts per million over an eight-hour

20

period and at the lower level, .07.

21

As I was saying before, when the

Now, the question about why the administrator

22

chose one number within that range is, of course, the

23

question that the Court of Appeals under Section 307(b)(1)

24

to which it will apply the arbitrary and capricious not in

25

accordance with law standard that it has not yet done in
14

1

this case, but I can articulate for you why both why no

2

one thought the range should be below .07, that is

3

regulating down to zero risk, and why the administrator

4

chose .07 versus .08.

5

make sure that I get to the salient point.

6

I'll start with the second first to

.07 was, and this is reflected in the Federal

7

Register notice promulgating the rule at pages 38863 to

8

38868.

9

demonstrated adverse health effects below .08.

.08 was chosen over .07 because one, there were no
Two, the

10

average responses, even at .08 were typically small or

11

mild. Three, the most certain effects at or below .08 were

12

transient and reversible.

13

above peak background levels in some locations.

14

not one single member of CASAC recommended .07 and in the

15

legal challenges in the Court of Appeals to the standard,

16

no party has challenged the administrator's decision not

17

to go to .07.

18

Four, .07 is at or slightly
And five,

.07 was viewed by CASAC and the EPA staff as

19

within the lower range because with respect to two of the

20

six testable health effects or end points or lung

21

function, that is, the ability to exhale, the volume you

22

exhale in one second and symptoms, it was possible to

23

extrapolate from studies done at and above .08 to levels

24

all the way down to zero just by using an arithmetic

25

extrapolation.
15

1

QUESTION:

Well, fine.

I mean, I understand

2

what you are saying, but it still leaves open the

3

question, why aren't transient health effects health

4

effects?

5

hurt as much.

I mean, so it's less coughing, and it doesn't
Why do you say that that should be ignored?

6

MR. WAXMAN:

7

QUESTION:

There may be certain -And as for CASAC and the parties not

8

favoring going below what you finally picked, I mean, that

9

can be explained because they, unlike, unlike EPA, may

10

have been taking economic effects into account.

11

if it required closing down the entire, the entire steel

12

industry, for example.

13

MR. WAXMAN:

You know,

Justice Scalia, there is no

14

evidence in the record and no basis for an assertion that

15

either CASAC or the EPA or the administrator have done

16

what they have said the law does not permit them to do.

17

That is, to take economic or cost effects into account.

18

QUESTION:

Then come back and tell me, tell me

19

why transient coughing effects are -- shouldn't be

20

considered.

21

MR. WAXMAN:

When there is an observed

22

symptomatic -- as I said, there are six different health

23

effects that are measured, and these are reflected in the

24

staff papers.

25

potentially not serious at all. The first two are

They range in level from very serious to

16

1

mortality and emergency room hospital admissions.

2

middle two are:

3

do the lungs manifest an unnatural responsiveness to

4

pathogens or infection, and the two smaller ones which I

5

addressed as to which there is data below .08 are, does it

6

limit the amount of volume you can expel?

7

The

is there inflammation in the lungs, and

QUESTION:

But all you are telling me, General,

8

is that -- is that there are -- there are reasons why one

9

would pick the higher levels and not pick the lower

10

levels.

It makes more sense to pick the higher levels,

11

but you still haven't given me a criterion of where you

12

stop.

13

transient health of adverse health effects?

Why not go lower? What's the matter with stopping

14

MR. WAXMAN:

There may be some transient

15

effects.

16

admission may reflect a transient effect, but the

17

administrator since 1970 has viewed that as by definition

18

adverse.

19

Inflammation in the lungs for -- a hospital

QUESTION:

Is that the principle?

Then one of

20

the principles that EPA has applied and can derive from

21

this statute is that transient health effects are not to

22

be taken into account.

23

MR. WAXMAN:

No, I may have misspoken. But there

24

are -- if you are -- EPA concludes that if epidemiological

25

studies show that you are required to go to the emergency
17

1

room, they deem that to be an adverse health effect.

2

is, a medically significant health effect.

3

That

What the administrator does when she gets the

4

data within the range is to make a judgment.

5

requires her to make a judgment within that range by

6

reference to three factors.

7

Scalia, at the nature and severity of the health effects.

8

A cough is not like a death, obviously.

9

QUESTION:

The statute

She looks first, Justice

She looks at --

10

MR. WAXMAN:

11

QUESTION:

So coughs don't count?
Coughs may count.
Is that a -- I'm looking for some

12

criterion I can glom on to and say this is the standard.

13

Coughs don't count or transient effects don't count.

14

MR. WAXMAN:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. WAXMAN:

The criterion -Is there anything that doesn't count?
The criterion -- nothing that --

17

anything that does not rise to the level of a medically

18

significant health effect does not count.

19

QUESTION:

That's circular.

20

significant health effect?

21

medically significant health effect?

22

MR. WAXMAN:

What is a medically

Is a transient cough a

As I explained earlier and as the

23

Agency has explained and the D.C. Circuit has explained,

24

it is a health effect that rises to the level at which a

25

medical professional would deem it to be a concern that
18

1

should be treated.

2

pulmonary effects, the Agency has always applied the

3

standards of the American Thoracic Society.

4

In this case, with respect to

I understand, I do understand the question.

You

5

are asking for a determinant criterion, but this -- this

6

Court's precedents have not and cannot require an agency

7

with respect to an area where there are many different

8

pollutants, many different kinds of health effects, many

9

different kinds of health effects and many different kinds

10

of science and scientific uncertainty to provide that

11

criterion.

record in detail why she made the choice within the range

13

provided her that she did, and for 20 years, the D.C.

14

Circuit has had no problem applying arbitrary and

15

capricious review to that.

She exercises her judgment and explains in the

QUESTION:

She hasn't said why.

things are worse, and we are banning them. These things

18

are not so bad, and we are not going to ban them.

19

But you could have drawn the line anywhere and

20

said the same thing.

You could have gone up from, you

21

know, 0.8 to 1.0 and said the same thing. The things above

22

here are very bad.

The things below here are not so bad.

23

MR. WAXMAN:

24

QUESTION:

25

the line at 0.8.

Justice -I want a criterion for why she drew

Now maybe, maybe you don't need it for
19

the constitutional point.

2

her, you know, to pick a reasonable point.

3

has to say the basis on which she picked the reasonable

4

point, at least for the arbitrary or capricious point,

5

don't you think?

6

MR. WAXMAN:

Maybe Congress can leave it to

Of course.

But gee, she

For the arbitrary and

7

capricious review, she has to explain why she made the

8

decision she made, given what the scientific data showed,

9

what the legal factors are, what the -- and that's test --

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. WAXMAN:

12

QUESTION:

Is that an issue before us?
No, it's not.
Okay.

So I mean, your -- your

13

position, as I understand it, is that -- that this

14

determinant point is not necessary to satisfy the

15

delegation doctrine, and the -- and as you have just said,

16

the question of reasonableness or capriciousness is not

17

before us because it was never reached by the court below.

18
19

MR. WAXMAN:

That is correct.

May I reserve the balance of my time?

20

QUESTION:

21

Warren, we'll hear from you.

22

ORAL ARGUMENT OF

23

Yes, you may, General Waxman.

Mr.

EDWARD W. WARREN

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

24
25

May I reserve?

MR. WARREN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
20

1

From what you have already heard this morning,

2

it simply cannot be true that Congress intended for the

3

administrator to make decisions which would cost nearly

4

$50 billion annually by 2010, when the administrator

5

herself frankly admits, and I'm quoting, that she followed

6

no generalized paradigm in making these decisions.

7

could Congress have intended for the administrator to

8

regulate ozone and particulate matter by controlling

9

combustion emissions from every automobile, factory, and

Nor

10

commercial activity nationwide when again using her words,

11

she never determined what risk is acceptable through

12

quantification or any other metric, any other metric.

13

This Court's decisions do not lightly presume

14

that Congress delegated questions of such great economic

15

and political significance to an administrative agency,

16

nor as this Court said in Benzene, in the Benzene

17

decision, do they allow an agency like EPA to regulate

18

broadly across the entire economy without determining what

19

risks are acceptable or unacceptable in an everyday common

20

sense manner.

21

QUESTION:

Can you explain, because this goes to

22

the heart of, I think, of our understanding of your case,

23

why your argument relates to delegation as opposed to the

24

arbitrary and capricious stand, the point at which we

25

ended up with -- with your brother.
21

1

MR. WARREN:

Yes, Justice Souter.

Because the

2

prerequisite, the logically antecedent question for

3

arbitrary and capricious review is an intelligible

4

principle.

5

an intelligible, substantive principle against which the

6

rulemaking can be conducted, expert advice can be given,

7

and judicial review can take place.

8
9

This Court has for 70 years said there must be

QUESTION:

True, but we're living under a regime

in which things like just and reasonable and public

10

convenience and necessity pass muster, and so it's not

11

clear to me why the delegation here, in light of those

12

examples, is wrong, as distinct from the argument that

13

what the administrator has done does not satisfy the

14

arbitrary and capricious standard.

15

MR> WARREN:

Let meke one thing absolutely clear

16

from the outset -- it should be clear from our briefs.

17

And that is that we are not saying that this statute does

18

not provide an intelligible principle, what we are saying

19

--

20
21
22

QUESTION:

Isn't that the end of the delegation

issue?
MR. WARREN:

No it's really not, because the

23

Court of Appeals was confronted with an interpretation of

24

the statute from the Lead Industries case and the cases

25

that followed on, which gave rise to the delegation
22

1

problem.

2

respond to your question, I do, just like General Waxman

3

had to, I have to refer to the statute in talking about

4

the intelligible principle and I will do so this morning

5

in my discussion.

6

And so it is true, I think, Justice Souter, to

QUESTION:

But your defending, Mr. Warren, are

7

you not, a decision that said that said there is no

8

intelligible principle in this statute.

9

someone has to make it up, either the Court or the Agency.

10

MR. WARREN:

11

QUESTION:

To get one,

Justice -What is the intelligible principle in

12

the statute.

Surely it's not in the statute that there

13

must be a cost/benefit analysis.

14

MR. WARREN:

If I may.

First, we are saying

15

that it is the Lead Industries line of cases that created

16

the delegation problem here.

17

intelligible principle in this statute that derives from

18

public health, from requisite to protect the public

19

health.

20

which I may get time to deal with in my second argument

21

but I want to focus right now on public health, because I

22

think it brings clearly into focus what is missing from

23

General Waxman's argument.

24
25

We do argue that there is an

There are a number of other words in the statute

General Waxman referred to medically significant
risks and talked about the American Thoracic Society.
23

1

He's talking as if the statute said we want to protect

2

personal health.

3

the statute says is we want to protect public health, and

4

that difference is terribly significant because let me

5

explain what happened in 1970.

6

That's not what the statute says.

What

The Senate bill said we want to set national

7

standards which will protect the health of persons, a term

8

that was interchangeable in the previous Act with health

9

of any persons.

The House had a bill that said, no, we

10

want to protect public health.

11

that had been used consistently since 1955 in the statute

12

and connoted just what, as we say in our briefs, public

13

health does connote, which is a comprehensive cost

14

included evaluation in order to reduce sickness and to

15

improve longevity of the population.

16

Public health was a word

What the conference committee did is it accepted

17

the House version, public health, which has a meaning

18

which I'm going to be discussing further this morning.

19

And what Mr. Waxman or what General Waxman has been doing

20

this morning is referring to legislative history from the

21

Senate bill from which he -- not just he, I don't want to

22

blame Mr. Waxman -- but EPA has derived this notion of

23

medically significant risks.

24

QUESTION:

25

from public health.

And you've derived the notion of cost
I mean, that is as obvious or not
24

1

obvious, one or the other, and this regime has been going

2

on -- Lead Industries was 1980, and this debate has been

3

going on and yet when Congress made adjustments, it always

4

made adjustments on the implementation end.

5

what could have been, what could have ended this debate

6

very swiftly.

7

MR. WARREN:

It never did

Let me start with the latter part

8

of your question and then kind of trip back to some of the

9

things you said previously.

First of all, this is -- the

10

Congress has taken no action with respect to Section

11

109(b).

12

change by inaction by the Congress.

13

common ground for everybody.

14

QUESTION:

15

We all know that.

There is not going to be any
I think surely that's

But there has been some action by

Congress stretching out the time to achieve attainment.

16

MR. WARREN:

But Congress has never, has never

17

done anything to the central standard-setting provision,

18

and it has never said anything which is different than

19

what I'm saying about public health. And I think for a

20

very good reason.

21

context.

22

in the Court of Appeals at the time.

23

Let me just kind of put those cases in

I know that you had some role because you were

But Lead Industries involved a not very

24

ubiquitous pollutant.

Lead in the ambient air principally

25

resulted from gasoline emissions which had already been
25

1

regulated by EPA, and that case was tried very much as a

2

technological feasibility case, not as a public health

3

case such as we are talking about here.

4

that the standards there protected public health in the

5

very sense that I'm talking about in my argument this

6

morning.

7

There is no doubt

The problem with the decisions following Lead

8

Industries, it's not that Lead Industries on those facts

9

concerning the contentions being made in that case was

10

wrong.

It is rather that the Court of Appeals then

11

conflated the idea of technological feasibility with the

12

question -- separate question -- of whether cost and other

13

kinds of countervailing considerations can be taken into

14

account in setting the standards in the first instance.

15

Now, with respect -- and let me go ahead and say

16

here we are with the two most ubiquitous pollutants, ozone

17

and particulate matter, where the regulatory scheme

18

requires everything I said in my first moments of argument

19

this morning where we are in the last mile, and all of a

20

sudden the question which has been present all along in

21

public health is now front and center.

22

Now, we talk about the implementation process

23

here.

I think two things are significant about what

24

General Waxman had to say about this -- that this morning.

25

First of all, I think he is conceding logically that costs
26

1

must play a role or else he wouldn't be making this

2

argument about the implementation phase.

3

misstating with all due respect what this Court's Union

4

Electric decision said.

5

says is that the standards are set by EPA and they cannot

6

be changed when EPA approves a state implementation plan.

7

Those standards are set and whether they protect public

8

health or not, they can't be changed in the implementation

9

process.

10

QUESTION:

But he is

What the Union Electric decision

But I think it is the case, number

11

one, that the implementation process, may, and I presume

12

does, consider economics when it determines the period of

13

time in which compliance must be reached, and of course,

14

Congress may do that.

15

anybody's premises to say that economics is excluded from

16

the process.

17

And so that I think it's wrong on

Now, it may very well be that if the cost is so

18

horrendous, that there is -- that there is no

19

implementation period in which the cost would not be very

20

great on an annual basis.

In 20 years, it's still going

21

to be enormously costly.

I think the Solicitor General's

22

response to that, if I understand the briefs, is that, in

23

effect, is the decision that Congress reserved to itself

24

by periodically taking up the question of revising

25

implementation standards as it has, as we are going to get
27

1

to, I guess, in the next case.

2

MR. WARREN:

Justice Souter, if I may, this

3

Court's decisions very clearly distinguish between

4

feasibility analysis and cost/benefit analysis.

5

will say, recognizing you said the opposite, cost in the

6

sense of cost/benefit analysis can never be taken into

7

account in the implementation process at all.

8

standards are set, and they can't be modified in the

9

implementation.

10

QUESTION:

Right.

Now, I

Those

Let's assume, let's assume

11

that is so, and I don't believe the Solicitor General will

12

agree, but let's assume it is so.

13

government's answer would be Congress has set out the

14

scheme which in effect reserves to Congress the right to

15

revise implementation, and that's the point at which

16

economics definitely will be given its place.

17

your kind of worst case argument, I think the government's

18

response is that's what Congress wanted, and Congress has

19

reserved to itself the power to interfere in the process.

20

MR. WARREN:

Then I think the

But even on

First of all, I'm going to be

21

talking about why that isn't what Congress wanted, but let

22

me continue on the implementation part of this.

23

Union Electric case says is that only the states can even

24

look at these questions at implementation, and then they

25

can only look at them and say who's going to bear the
28

What the

1

burden of the standards that are already set by EPA.

2

call it triage, but, I mean, I think you get the idea.

3

It's essentially who's going to bear the burden.

4

QUESTION:

I

And they can say how long their time,

5

how much time will be allowed for that burden to be borne,

6

which has an obvious economic consequence.

7

MR. WARREN:

But even that's not true. Those

8

standards have to be met by the deadlines established by

9

Congress.

10

There is only -- this kind of consideration

that you are wishing were there isn't there.

11

QUESTION:

Then the argument is that Congress

12

has reserved something and it shouldn't have reserved it.

13

It should have given the power in the first instance to

14

the administrator.

15

MR. WARREN:

Now, but that -- first of all, I

16

would think that it would be common ground that we don't

17

construe statutes on the assumption that Congress will

18

change them, and that we don't construe the words, because

19

it seems to me when we come to the words here, we come

20

back to what really went on.

21

QUESTION:

But the words that you are

22

ultimately, the word that you are depending on is the term

23

public health as distinct from individual health.

24

say, you say that imports.

25

criterion.

You'll

That implies an economic

And I have to say even as a threshold matter,
29

1

I don't know why that implies an economic criterion in

2

some different way than a reference to or a different

3

degree than a reference to individual health would do.

4

MR. WARREN:

Well, I think, the distinction,

5

Your Honor, is very much like the idea of managed care.

6

mean, what we are talking about is a world of limited

7

resources, and the decision is being made on the

8

population as a whole.

9
10

QUESTION:

I

There are other provisions in this

very statute --

11

MR. WARREN:

Right.
-- that use the term public health,

13

and then add to the term public health the impact upon the

economy.

health, the economy and the environment.

For example, Section 76.12, which commissions a

MR. WARREN:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

And -You're saying they didn't really have

to say economy.
MR. WARREN:

No.

I'm saying that those three

21

terms, public health, environment, and the economy,

22

overlap and interrelate and so that when -- when, for

23

example, Congress was asking for advice about the effects

24

on the environment, they were not excluding effects on

25

public health and so, too, when they were asking for
30

1

effects on public health, they were not excluding effects

2

on the economy.

3

a way that the advice -- they are not mutually exclusive -

4

-

5

Those terms are obviously set up in such

QUESTION:

There are several other places in the

6

statute where -- where public health is added or, or, or

7

referred to separately from economic effects.

8
9

The second problem I have, and I would like you
to address that if you can is, I don't see how it helps

10

your delegation problem to simply add the economy to the

11

ineffable pot of things that the administrator is supposed

12

to consider.

13

on, you know, is, is a -- is a cough too much.

14

know if a cough is too much.

15

hard call, but does it make it easier to say, well, you

16

know, if you are going to stop a cough, you are going to

17

-- it's going to cost $1,000 a cough.

I mean, I was pressing the Solicitor General

I suppose, you know, it's a

18

Does that help you?

19

MR. WARREN:

20

QUESTION:

Well, I don't know.

Is that a clear standard?

Yes.
Is $1,000 too much for a cough, or

21

2,000, 3,000?

22

add, add economic effects to the thing.

23

me quite as --

24
25

Why does it give you a standard simply to

We are adding factors that countervail. They're

2

on the other side of the equation. Could I -QUESTION: But they're just as indeterminate.

seems to me it's not enough to have other factors on the

4

other side.

this statute, you need more determinative factors, not

6

just more factors.

It

If you're going to bring more certainty to

MR. WARREN:

Justice Scalia, with all respect, I

8

think that when you add countervailing factors, you narrow

9

the range of outcomes.

Let me illustrate by just and

10

reasonable rates which we talk about in our brief.

11

think you'd have a great big constitutional problem if you

12

didn't take investor interests and consumer interests and

13

weigh them one against the other.

your argument --

21

MR. WARREN:

22

QUESTION:

Yes.
All right.

I could ask the same

23

question with just and reasonable rates.

I could ask the

24

same question with picking out trucking routes or picking

25

out airline routes.

I mean, why is this worse than those?
32

1

You just say there are interests on both sides, so --

2

well, there's no way to -- there's no scale in heaven or

3

anything else, other than judgment, that tells us what the

4

just and reasonable rate is in terms of return to an

5

investor, and similarly there's nothing other than

6

judgment that would tell you here how far down the health

scale you go before it's not really required by public

MR. WARREN:

Justice Breyer, the judgment is

That's the

This is different because --

I agree with you on that, but I now
That is, I agree

I don't see how it's one wit more

MR. WARREN:

Justice Breyer, I don't think law

20

and jurisprudence requires determinative outcomes.

21

Justice Scalia likes a world of rules.

22

But a lot of law is standards.

24

for a law of rules.

25

I understand that.

A lot of law is --

Don't blame it on me.
You're --

(Laughter.)
33

You're arguing

QUESTION:

You're saying that Congress can't

2

give this to the EPA unless it holds the rein pretty

3

tight.

I thought that's your argument.

4

MR. WARREN:

No, I think -- when you say hold

5

the rein tight, what I'm saying is that public health

6

necessarily conveys and connotes the kind of

7

countervailing factors that I'm talking about.

8

not mean the agency lacks discretion.

9

just as Justice Breyer was suggesting, that the FPC, when

solution of a differential equation.

14

that you have to have the competing factors.

That's really not my argument

I'm not arguing that we're going to get to a

15

QUESTION:

What I'm saying is

And the Government says the competing

16

factors, the countervailing factors are identified, among

17

other things, by looking to norms today about the need for

18

treatment.

19

to treat it, don't you have to treat it?

20

transitory, is it nontransitory?

21

to-what kind of analyses, and they're saying you get those

22

compared-to-what kind of analyses without having to get

23

into economics at the front end when you're setting the

24

standard, so they say your own argument is met.

25

That's a countervailing factor.

MR. WARREN:

Do you have

Is the effect

Those are all compared-

But with all due respect, they are
34

1

bucking the whole regulatory process, because what they're

2

talking about is characterizing a risk.

Science helps to

3

characterize risks, I don't doubt that.

The question is,

4

how do you manage risks?

5

you've got to take into account countervailing factors,

6

otherwise you're in the situation that the Court of

7

Appeals, I think, pretty aptly described.

8
9

QUESTION:

When you're managing risks

Right, but they're saying that at the

standard-setting stage the question is not risk

10

management, the question is risk identification, and we

11

identify the risks by bearing in mind these various

countervailing factors.

13

the implementation stage.

14

MR. WARREN:

We manage the risk at stage 2, at

But with all respect, Your Honor,

15

they are managing risks when they set those standards

because the standards can't be changed in the

MR. WARREN:

QUESTION:

I realize I'm just folding back

Can I ask a clarifying question?
Yes.
Are you saying -- I want to be sure I

22

understand your argument -- that although the terms,

23

requisite to public -- protect the public health are too

24

vague and too standardless, it would be all right if it

25

said, are requisite to protect the public health provided

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH L. FRENCH

19

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

20
21
22

MS. FRENCH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
EPA'S promulgation of a revised ozone standard

23

was unlawful because it conflicts with Congress' specific

24

and comprehensive plan for ozone regulation found at

25

subpart (2) of part (d) of the Clean Air Act.
36

1

In 1990, Congress rewrote the law that applies

2

to ozone.

Congress rejected the old and failed one-size-

3

fits-all approach to ozone attainment.

4

implemented instead a comprehensive and unique scheme that

5

combines realistic expectations with measures of progress.

6

EPA's position has changed repeatedly over the last few

7

years, but there is no question the EPA intends to take us

8

back to that failed approach.

9

a return to unrealistic deadlines, inflexible

Congress

For the states, that means

10

requirements, and certain failure.

11

affirm the lower court's judgment that EPA may not

12

implement a different standard.

I mean, one part

of this I thought was that the Congress has instructed EPA

periodically to review these national ambient air quality

16

standards and revise them based on more current

17

information, so it seems that the obligation on EPA to

18

review and revise is one clear instruction that Congress

19

has given.

20

MS. FRENCH:

Not with respect to ozone, Your

21

Honor.

22

very first sentence of Section 181, which is the first

23

section of subpart (2), states specifically that each

24

area --

25

We need to look at Section 181 of the Act.

QUESTION:

The

Where do we find the section you're

referring to?

MS. FRENCH:

That would be in the brief of

respondents American Trucking in Case Number 99-1257,

4

their red brief, at page 15-A.

QUESTION:

6

MS. FRENCH:

Thank you.
The first sentence of that section

7

reads that each area designated nonattainment for ozone

8

shall be classified according to table 1 that's provided

9

there, and using -- by operation of law, and using the

10

design value for each area.

11

The second sentence tells us that the design

12

value is calculated according to the methodology that EPA

13

had in place most recently before November 15, 1990.

14

those two sentences in table 1, we have a specific

15

standard in place --

16
17

QUESTION:

So you mean the 1990 standard has to

last forever?

18

MS. FRENCH:

QUESTION:

20
21

That's true, Your Honor.
To 2010, it's still the 1990

standard?
MS. FRENCH:

Yes, Your Honor.

Congress left no

22

room for EPA to promulgate a different standard.

prevent the EPA from enforcing new ozone national ambient

MS. FRENCH:

4

MS. FRENCH:

For ozone, yes, Your Honor -For ozone.
-- that's exactly correct, and we

5

make that argument based on the specific language of

6

Section 181, in particular, table 1.

7
8

QUESTION:

Does that have the effect of reading

subpart (1) sort of out of existence?

9

MS. FRENCH:

Not entirely, Your Honor.

However,

10

there are specific limitations in subpart (1).

For

11

instance, in Section 172 of the Act, that's the section

12

that gives EPA its general authority to classify areas and

13

to set specific attainment deadlines, Congress stated in

14

the 1990 amendments that those paragraphs giving EPA that

15

general authority do not apply where those classifications

16

and attainment deadlines have been set in other parts of

17

the Act.

Then Congress --

apply for other pollutants --

Yes, and it would also -If Congress wanted to say you can't

10

pass any new tougher ozone standard, why didn't it just

11

say it, instead of having a provision in there that says

12

you should revise it every 5 years?

13

MS. FRENCH:

Your Honor is correct that EPA --

14

I'm sorry, that Congress could have put it in the

15

negative, that thou shalt not revise the standard.

16

However, they put it in the positive.

17
18

QUESTION:

They didn't say that you shall revise

the ozone standard every 5 years, did they?

19

MS. FRENCH:

20

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, they did not.
They said, you shall revise standards

21

every 5 years, and that's their general provision.

22

they had a more specific provision dealing with ozone

23

which said, this is going to be the standard.

24
25

MS. FRENCH:

Then

Exactly right, Your Honor, and that

more specific language came later in time.

QUESTION: Was there any legislative history
which is where they all got up on the floor even which

10

would be significant to me, not to everyone, where they

11

said and now this means, this means that the EPA has no

12

more power to revise the standards.

13

MS. FRENCH:

There are references, Your Honor,

14

to the number of other kinds of revisions that Congress

15

considered.

16

have given EPA authority to revise the standard within a

17

certain period of time following the '90 amendments.

18

There were other bills that would have given EPA, for

19

instance, the authority to change the averaging time from

20

say a six-hour standard to a 12-hour standard.

21

Congress put into place was the specific standard we find

22

in subpart (2) which gives us the one-hour standard using

23

the design value that was in place at the time of the '90

24

amendments.

Congress considered other bills that would

Attainment areas across -- there were nonattainment areas

5

across the country and Congress got it right this time,

6

after 20 years of failure, we've had 10 years of success.

7

The state of Ohio is a good example of that.

ago today, the state of Ohio ranked third among the 50

states for areas that were out of attainment for ozone.

15

MS. FRENCH:

QUESTION:

Judge Tatel had a different view of

how these two subparts worked, did he not?
MS. FRENCH:

He did, Your Honor, and what he

12

suggested was that once an area met the standard, that

13

then EPA could change the standard for that specific area.

14

That doesn't work with subpart (2) for three reasons.

15

The first is that subpart (2) is a comprehensive

16

scheme that applies nationwide.

The second is that

17

Section 172 of the Act takes away EPA's general authority,

18

not just general authority with the 1-hour standard, but

19

its general authority for classifying areas and for

20

setting deadlines.

21

itself in Section 181 refers to areas that are currently

22

in attainment but may fall out of attainment.

23

specific provisions in place that would apply subpart (2),

24

and specifically table 1, to those areas.

25

no room left, whether now, in the future, until Congress

The final reason is that subpart (2)

43

There are

There is simply

1

acts to change the specific standard.

2

We've got an extraordinary case here where

3

Congress balanced the interests, many of the interests

4

that we're talking about this morning with respect to

5

ozone.

6

to simply affirm the lower court's judgment that EPA may

7

not implement the standard, but we are offering as an

8

alternative basis that EPA cannot implement the standard

9

because Congress gave it no authority to revise the

10

Congress got it right, and we're asking the Court

standard in the first instance.

11

Again, we need to look only specifically at

12

Section 181, at the very first sentences, the sentence

13

that provides that each area designated nonattainment for

14

ozone shall be classified in accordance with table 1.

15

I would be remiss if I didn't state here that we

16

won below.

A majority of the D.C. Circuit agreed the EPA

17

had no enforcement authority to enforce a different

18

standard.

19

on alternative grounds, and that is that EPA cannot

20

implement a different standard because it may not revise

21

the standard.

22

implement the standard because it becomes unworkable. It's

23

unworkable because Congress never anticipated that the 1-

24

hour standard would be changed without congressional

25

change.

We are asking the Court to go one step further

EPA's argument is that they cannot

1

Just as the states and EPA, I may remind the

2

Court that EP -- this was EPA's bill.

This was the

3

President's bill before Congress asking for certainty,

4

asking for a specific standard, a specific set of

5

classifications, and specific deadlines.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13
14
15

Thank

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The state of Ohio is asking this Court to rule

16

that the administrator may not revise national ambient air

17

quality standards for ozone, and that even if she can

18

revise them, that she cannot implement them either for

19

primary or secondary standards.

20

The District of Columbia Circuit held, in a

21

judgment that no one petitioned from, that the clear

22

language of the statute requires EPA to revise and, as

23

appropriate, promulgate new standards for ozone, and that

24

nothing in Section 181 in any respect impairs her ability

25

to enforce the secondary standard, which is identical, and
45

1

we think, therefore, that those questions are not properly

2

before the Court.

3

What is before the Court is the question of

4

whether, having resolved the legal question before it,

5

which is the challenge to EPA's authority to revise and

6

provide a new standard, the Court of Appeals acted

7

properly in going beyond that and opining, based on some

8

preamble language, to the new rule that EPA promulgated,

9

that EPA could either not implement the new primary

10

standard, or implement it only in conformity with subpart

11

(2), which are the specific implementation provisions that

12

Congress enacted in 1990 for the

13

1-hour ozone standard.

14

We think -- we have two submissions.

First,

15

there was -- the Court of Appeals did not properly address

16

the issue of how EPA will implement the new standard that

17

it said it had authority to set, because EPA has not

18

undertaken any final agency action to do so, and the time

19

for doing so has not yet come.

20

Second of all, the question is, because it

21

hasn't engaged in the notice and comment rulemaking about

22

how to implement the

23

8-hour standard, the EPA has not -- the Court of Appeals

24

decision is perforce phrased in terms of such a high level

25

of abstraction that not even any of the respondents can
46

1

agree what the Court of Appeals meant when it said in its

2

third try at this that EPA may implement the 8-hour

3

standard only in conformity with subpart (2), and

4

therefore we think that the Court of Appeals should not

5

have reached this issue.

6

The administrator will engage in notice and

7

comment rulemaking specifying how the Act is to be

8

implemented at the time that she promulgates the area

9

designations that the states have provided to her and sets

10

the schedule for what are called state implementation

11

plans, and at that point she will have issued a rule and

12

undertaken an action supported by an explanation that

13

this, or the Court of Appeals could review.

14

Thank you.
