CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

I think it's fitting

4

to note that February 4th, last February 4th, marked the

5

200th anniversary of John Marshall's swearing in as the

6

fourth Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United

7

States, as it then was called.

8

I am quite convinced that Marshall deserves to

9

be recognized along with George Washington, Alexander

10

Hamilton, and Thomas Jefferson as one of the Founding

11

Fathers of this country.

12

Marshall served as Chief Justice from 1801 until

13

1835.

14

of the important cases the Court decided during his

15

tenure.

16

He authored more than 500 opinions, including most

Using his remarkable ability to reason from

17

general principles to conclusions based on those

18

principles, he derived from the Constitution a road map of

19

how its checks and balances could be enforced in practice.

20

I don't think I overstate the case to say that it is in

21

large part because of Marshall's tenure on the Supreme

22

Court that the third branch of our Government occupies the

23

coequal position it does today.

24
25

One occasionally hears the expression that an
institution is the lengthened shadow of an individual.

It

1

may be risky to suggest that any institution which has

2

endured for over 200 years, the way the Supreme Court of

3

the United States has, could be the length and shadow of

4

one individual, but surely there is only one individual

5

who could possibly qualify for this distinction, and that

6

is John Marshall.

7

In honor of the 200th anniversary of John

8

Marshall's appointment to the Court, our curator's office

9

has put together an exhibit located near the statue of

10

John Marshall on the ground floor.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

14

States.

15

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH LERNER

16

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

17

MR. LERNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

18

the Court, this case is about thermal imaging of a home

19

without a warrant, and whether that constitutes an

20

impermissible search under the Fourth Amendment.

21

is the basic refuge for all citizens.

22

our greatest expectations of privacy, where we are free to

23

let down our guard, and where we should have our greatest

24

feeling that we are free from government spying.

25

Unreasonable and unwarranted searching of the home is the

Our home

It's where we have

1

chief evil that the Fourth Amendment protects us against,

2

and it has a specific -- the home itself has a specific

3

mention in the Constitution, and as a bedrock principle,

4

the home is a place where we have our most heightened

5

expectations of privacy.

6
7

QUESTION:

Mr. Lerner, I thought the district

court here made some findings in that regard.

8

MR. LERNER:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.
To the effect that the thermal

10

imaging device cannot and did not show any people or

11

activity within the walls of the structure, and the device

12

cannot penetrate walls or windows to reveal conversations

13

or human activities.

14

emitted from the home.

15

findings, do you not?

16

MR. LERNER:

It recorded only the heat being
Now, I guess you accept those

Well, I accept the finding, Your

17

Honor, that the thermal imager is capturing emissions as

18

they are coming from the wall.

19

QUESTION:

Well, let me ask you this.

Do we,

20

reviewing the judgment here, have to accept those findings

21

as correct?

22

MR. LERNER:

Well, I think some of those

23

findings are mixed questions of fact and law, such as what

24

is activity and what activity does the Constitution

25

protect.

I don't think those are findings that the Court

1

has to accept, but I am perfectly comfortable with the

2

finding that the thermal imager was capturing the

3

information on the outside of the home.

4

that is an incomplete view of thermal imaging because

5

there would be no image at all if it weren't for the

6

thermodynamic process.

7

source to heat up the wall so that you will see it.

8

Therefore there is something behind the wall that provides

9

and radiates heat to the wall, the wall reradiates it out,

However, I think

There must be a constant heat

10

but if it's not constant, if it's not a dynamic process,

11

you will not see anything, and therefore it is the purpose

12

of the thermal imager and the function of the thermal

13

imager is to detect what is beneath the surface by

14

scanning that surface.

15

QUESTION:

Well, don't we have at least a

16

lodging here that indicates that the thermal imager will,

17

in fact, or can, in fact, produce images of what is

18

happening of objects and what is happening to those

19

objects inside the walls?

20

MR. LERNER:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

Yes.
All right.

What's the status of the

lodging, what are we supposed to make of it?
MR. LERNER:

Well, I think the Court should look

24

at, first of all, the videotape that's been lodged, and a

25

few things you should know about the videotape.

First of

1

all, it is not an original exhibit.

2

has been misplaced or lost in some way, but you have a

3

third generation copy of the original thermal image that

4

was taken at the time in front of Mr. Kyllo's house.

5
6

QUESTION:

Was the original of that introduced

in evidence?

7
8

The original exhibit

MR. LERNER:
evidence.

Yes, the original was introduced in

So I don't know exactly --

9

QUESTION:

How could the judge make the finding

10

that he made if he accepted the original item of evidence,

11

assuming that it is substantially identical to what we

12

have lodged with us, because one of the sights that

13

appears from the videotape is the sight of individuals

14

moving inside a house, I believe with the shades drawn.

15

MR. LERNER:

Well, that is one of the exhibits

16

that we have lodged, Exhibit 107 and 108, do show an

17

individual inside behind glass, but there is nothing with

18

the shades drawn.

19

--

That was -- if that was ever mentioned

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. LERNER:

22

QUESTION:

Was it supposedly taken in darkness?
The thermal imaging?
Well, tell me, was the -- I looked at

23

the lodged videotape, and it showed individuals moving, or

24

an individual moving inside the building, inside an

25

apartment.

Was that image made solely with the infrared

process?

2

MR. LERNER:

3

QUESTION:

4

That's right.
So that in total darkness of visible

light --

5

MR. LERNER:

6

QUESTION:

7

10

-- that image could have been made by

the thermal imaging device?

8
9

That's right.

MR. LERNER:

That's correct.

That is correct.

And that was a demonstration that our expert provided to
the court.

11

QUESTION:

12

when it made these findings?

13

MR. LERNER:

14

QUESTION:

The district court had that before it

Yes, it did.
So presumably to the extent the

15

findings are inconsistent with that exhibit, the district

16

court did not give full accord to it?

17

MR. LERNER:

That's correct, Your Honor, and I

18

would like to say that I think Judge Frey at the district

19

court level, was trying to determine what this thermal

20

imager would do and what it did in this case, and she did

21

not --

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Lerner, would you qualify --

23

QUESTION:

I think he is answering my question.

24

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

25

MR. LERNER:

And so there is -- apparently

1

that's what the limit of her factual holding is that in

2

this particular case, it did not show any person or

3

activity, but she did not say that it's not capable of

4

showing what our expert did show, that it can show people

5

inside of windows.

6

QUESTION:

Now may I qualify that what you're

7

talking about now, the one that shows people, was not the

8

one that was involved in this very case?

9

MR. LERNER:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. LERNER:

12

QUESTION:

That's right.
It was a different one?
That's right.

13

that point.

14

or didn't show any --

15

MR. LERNER:

So I think there is some confusion on

The one in this case didn't show any people

That's right.

What you'll see on

16

Government's Exhibit Number 2, which is lodged with this

17

Court, is a very slanted image, almost as if Picasso was

18

taking a video, and it's an indistinct image of the home,

19

but you can clearly see the home, and what I would like

20

the Court to look for is towards the end of the videotape,

21

as it shows the back view of the home, you can see three

22

distinct circles of light along the very top of the roof,

23

which is the heat from heat lamps coming out of the roof,

24

and that is what the thermal imager was capturing in this

25

particular case.

1

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Lerner, you say that in

2

this particular situation the thermal imaging did only so

3

much, but we shouldn't just look at that we should look at

4

what it's capable of.

5

MR. LERNER:

6

QUESTION:

Absolutely.
I don't think you're correct in that.

7

I think in a Fourth Amendment case we decide what was

8

actually done, not what something was capable of doing.

9

MR. LERNER:

Well, you know, you're the Supreme

10

Court, so you will do what I assume you will do, but I

11

think that you will probably have then a series of cases

12

every time a thermal imager is used on a different wall or

13

on a window or the newest version of the technology comes

14

up, and I think it really makes sense, unless the Court

15

wants to revisit this every few years, to look at what the

16

capability of the science is.

17

QUESTION:

Well, what about the proposition that

18

so long as it is not showing anything that couldn't have

19

been discovered without the visual imager, in this case

20

when you're talking about how warm the roof is, I assume

21

that if the police had waited for a good snowfall, they

22

could have found out exactly what they found out through

23

this thermal imaging.

24

MR. LERNER:

25

QUESTION:

Well, I -I mean, the snow would have melted on

other roofs, it would not have melted -- I mean, it would

2

have melted in these portions, it wouldn't have melted

3

elsewhere.

MR. LERNER:

Well, two things I would like to

5

say about that Justice Scalia.

6

snow on Mr. Kyllo's roof, and we don't dispute that.

7

there had been snow and it had been melting, they could

have seen that, but there was no snow, and it does not

snow very frequently in Lawrence, Oregon, because it's on

First of all, there was no
If

the Oregon coast, and it's not something that normally

11

would be expected, and so you would not be able to see

12

anything from a normal vantage point that the public would

13

maintain on a regular basis.

14

QUESTION:

Well, have we upheld, for example,

15

the use of night vision glasses by law enforcement

16

personnel to see things that they couldn't see with

1

question, I just don't know if there's authority for that.

2

Suppose we had a case and we stipulate that it's lawful

3

for the police to listen with an electronic, enhanced

4

listening device to a conversation that takes place on the

5

street, let's assume that's lawful.

6

under its own terms.

7

could potentially have been -- had its listening power

8

turned up so it could hear what was going on inside.

9

don't decide cases that way, do we?

10

We would judge that

We wouldn't say, oh, well, now, this

MR. LERNER:

We

Well, I don't know if you do or you

11

don't.

It seems like you would want to look exactly at

12

what happened in this case and what the technology does

13

and can do because this is a new technology and it

14

supersedes the human senses.

15

QUESTION:

Well, on that point, it seems to me

16

you take somewhat inconsistent positions.

17

you said this could pinpoint with great accuracy what

18

happens, and then in the next couple pages you say, well,

19

now, these images can be manipulated by the police.

20

mean, which is it?

accurate?

On the one hand

Is this thing accurate or not

Those seem to me like inconsistent -MR. LERNER:

Well, that's not the question

23

that's before this Court, but in the lower court we did

24

claim that it was not accurate and should not be used in

25

search warrants.

It's not accurate because it can be

QUESTION:

But my point is, you do make this

invasion of privacy because it's so accurate.

You say, number one, it's an unacceptable

14

that was our complaint.

15

thermal imagers do, which is pinpoint the heat at a

17

private place.

18

It's based upon the thermodynamic process, and on

We were concerned about this

But it still does what all

It didn't matter it came from a

20

information that the police derived was that there was an

extraordinary amount of heat being generated in this

house, right?

23

I mean, what was the significant

MR. LERNER:

amount of heat in the house.

It was the extraordinary

amount of heat in very particular locations of the house.

2

QUESTION:

Well, would it have mattered whether

it was in the cellar or in the roof?

3

MR. LERNER:

4

QUESTION:

I mean --

It may or may not have.
Well, it seems to me, would it have

5

been a violation for the police -- I think they did use in

6

the search warrant here the fact that the utility bills

7

for this home were much higher than surrounding homes.

8

that a violation of the privacy of the home, the police

9

finding out that these people are using an extraordinary

10
11

Is

amount of electricity?
MR. LERNER:

We haven't raised that as an issue,

12

Your Honor, and I think this Court's holdings in Miller

13

and Smith versus Maryland seem to say that if someone has

14

records that are being held by a third party, they don't

15

have an expectation of privacy that those records might

16

not be searched, so the fact that they were able to

17

subpoena and obtain Mr. Kyllo's energy records I don't

18

think is a matter that we've raised as --

19

QUESTION:

May I ask you if you think the --

20

that that information in those records would have been

21

adequate probable cause to get a warrant to use the device

22

in this case?

MR. LERNER:

We don't believe that it would,

is not just procedural, but whether or not they can use

2

these devices at all?

3

MR. LERNER:

4

That's right.

Well, whether they

can use the devices without a warrant on the home.

5

QUESTION:

And would the --

6

QUESTION:

And if they had enough probable cause

7
8
9

to use the device, they probably wouldn't need the device?
MR. LERNER:

Well, that's absolutely true, and I

think that's the same argument that was used in Karo, that

10

if we need probable cause to use this to monitor the

11

beeper, then we'll effectively use this.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. LERNER:

14
15

Let's go in the house and look.
So the court said that's not a good

enough reason.
QUESTION:

Well, could it vary?

How fixed is

16

that in the precedents?

17

cause to warrant a beeper -- warrant a thermal imager,

18

which is far less intrusive than going into the house?

19

do you think it's absolutely fixed that you either have

20

probable cause to rummage through the bedroom or you can't

21

do anything?

22

MR. LERNER:

I mean, could you have enough

Or

I think anytime that the Government

23

is seeking to capture information from a private place

24

like the home, and they cannot do it with their own

25

unaided human senses, then they may not use technology to

1

do the same thing.

2

QUESTION:

Suppose your choice was exactly that,

3

that you -- when faced with that dilemma, the court holds

4

that you can use it without any warrant, and how would you

5

prefer as a fallback, you need at least a warrant but less

6

cause than to rummage in the home itself or is that so

7

fixed in the law there is really just the absolute

8

dichotomy?

9

MR. LERNER:

Well, I think the Court has

10

repeated so many times that to enter the home or to search

11

the home that you need a warrant --

12

QUESTION:

Well, I know that, and what you'd

13

have to say is it's probable cause not to enter the home.

14

It's probable cause to get an imager.

15

MR. LERNER:

Well, I think that's a very

16

dangerous road to go when we start talking about imagers

17

and technology because what it's capturing really is

18

molecular information that migrates through our walls and

19

therefore if we are now saying that we can capture that

20

kind of information without a warrant, we can reduce our

21

whole world to that type of wave and molecule, and our

22

walls mean nothing because our walls cannot contain that

23

kind of information.

24

Mr. Lerner, could you just explain to

me what this thermal imaging revealed that was not

revealed by the utility records which you say under our

2

precedent it was permissible for the police to obtain?

3

MR. LERNER:

Well, utility records give you

4

generalized information about someone's electrical use,

5

and we actually did have quite a complete hearing about

6

those records and heard from utility industry people, and

7

people's energy bills vary quite dramatically depending,

8

frankly, on how many women live in the home versus men,

9

how many times you do laundry, who is taking showers,

10

things that you plug in.

11

you're using heat lamps or that you're growing marijuana.

12

So it's too generalized type of information to really

13

persuade a magistrate that that means there's marijuana

growing.

QUESTION:

16

MR. LERNER:

17

QUESTION:

It doesn't necessarily mean that

Mr. Lerner -In this case --- you say that you can't use -- look

18

into the home with anything other than the unaided senses.

19

Is it unconstitutional to use binoculars to look into a

20

window that's left unclosed without a curtain?

21

what our case law says? I don't think it does --

22

MR. LERNER:

Is that

The Court hasn't really addressed

23

that point yet, so that's going to be a very difficult

24

question when it comes up.

it right now because that ought to be our standard of what

2

is reasonable expectation.

3

MR. LERNER:

Wasn't that your argument?

My standard is if it is unavailable

4

to the unaided eye, simply because there is a window and

5

you can see deep inside that window that no one else in

6

the normal course could have seen with some high-powered

7

technology --

QUESTION:

9

MR. LERNER:

But eyeglasses are okay?

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. LERNER:

Eyeglasses are fine.
Okay.

But not binoculars?

Well, eyeglasses give you normal

12

vision, and they are an accepted way of repairing disabled

13

vision --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. LERNER:

Why should --- but when you start to use

16

technology, that takes us beyond the human senses, now the

17

Court has said --

18

QUESTION:

How about --

19

QUESTION:

Why is that relevant?

I mean, you're

20

saying some things that take us beyond the human senses

21

are okay, eyeglasses, binoculars, maybe not.

22

that are sort of abnormal in use cross the line.

23

should the line be drawn there? What's the -- what's your

reasoning behind that?

because the privacy is predicated upon what someone can

2

knowingly or unknowingly expose, and once we're in the

3

level of technology, people have no way of knowing when

4

they are voluntarily exposing something. Yes, we could all

5

live in rooms that totally close the windows off --

QUESTION:

So you're saying that reasonable

7

expectation is in part based on fact, what do you, in

8

fact, expect, and that informs, should inform the standard

9

of reasonable expectation, is that the nub of what you're

10

saying?

11
12

MR. LERNER:

It is partly what we all

expect.

13
14

Yes.

QUESTION:

What about a dog sniff, how about a

dog sniff?

15

MR. LERNER:

16

QUESTION:

How about a dog sniff?
Yeah, we've used dog sniffs to detect

17

something that the human nose doesn't detect, haven't we?

18

So under your test that's out, too, but we've upheld some

19

of those.

20

MR. LERNER:

Right.

The Court -- well, I'm not

21

going as far as the Court did in Place because Place was

22

limited to narcotics and sensing only, very specifically

23

contraband in a very public place and a very transitory

24

place, and I think that the Court has been careful to

25

limit Place to that circumstance.

We're not saying that

you can't use technology out in the world, but we're

2

saying that the home has such a heightened expectation of

3

privacy, to use technology to pry into our homes is a

very, very different point, and the Court has not

addressed whether we can just have police dogs running

QUESTION:

I'm not -Mr. Lerner, you were explaining to

13

me, and I haven't quite grasped it, why the utility

14

records wouldn't tell you the same thing. Will the thermal

imaging tell you that it's not women taking showers?

16

MR. LERNER:

The thermal imaging will give you a

17

more specific impression such as here it showed three

18

distinct, evenly spaced circles of light at the peak of

19

the roof from which they could conclude that this is very

20

similar to other marijuana growing that they have seen.

21

They did not have any other information about Mr. Kyllo,

22

no one had been inside his home, there was no tip that he

23

was growing marijuana, so sometimes the utility records

24

are enough when you have a specific tip about what someone

25

might be doing in their home, but when you lack that type

1

of specificity, the normal heat and electrical records

2

don't really tell you whether the high electricity is

3

because they're growing marijuana or if it's because they

4

take a lot of showers and do a lot of laundry, have a lot

5

of appliances or an inefficient heating system or

6

anything, taking saunas or anything else.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. LERNER:

9

And the imaging will tell you that?
The imaging will give you specific

heat impressions from various places in the home, coming

10

through the wall, telling you what's on the other side of

11

the wall.

12

QUESTION:

May I ask to what extent your theory

13

depends on the sophisticated nature of the equipment?

14

Supposing the police had rented the house next door, and

15

they leaned out the second story window with a long pole

16

with a thermometer on it, they could kind of track the

17

wall and find out what part was hot and what wasn't, would

18

that violate the Fourth Amendment?

19
20

MR. LERNER:

Well, that would be a different

question than the use of technology.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. LERNER:

Why would that be different?
Because they would be intruding on

23

the curtilage, where they physically invading and touching

feet apart and they could stay on their side of the

2

boundary line.

3

MR. LERNER:

I'd say then that is something that

4

would be permissible because it's something that is akin

5

to our normal human senses, that they could determine how

6

hot the wall was by feeling it.

7

QUESTION:

No, not feeling it.

They had to use

8

a thermometer, and they had to reach out parallel to the

9

walls of the houses to do it. They're using some kind of a

10

magnifying equipment.

11

MR. LERNER:

Well, obviously I don't think that

12

we would prohibit things like thermometers or watches or

13

things that we typically use in our daily lives.

14

QUESTION:

But a drug-sniffing dog you couldn't?

MR. LERNER:

I think that --

In your view, you couldn't do that?

question, yes.

Why don't

because you know people have binoculars?

3

MR. LERNER:

4

QUESTION:

Right.
And so also you know there are things

5

such as thermal image, and so if you're really concerned

6

about that degree of privacy, I'm sure there are means of

7

preventing the heat escape from the house, and therefore

8

preventing that technology from being used.

9

have to assume that we live in a world without technology?

10

MR. LERNER:

Why do we

We don't have to assume that we do,

11

Your Honor, but technology has the ability to penetrate

12

into our private lives, and that's the problem.

13

QUESTION:

Yes, it does and we have the ability

14

to protect our private lives as well if we really have

15

expectations of privacy.

16

MR. LERNER:

So that what I'm -- I guess our

17

position is that the burden really is improperly placed on

18

the citizen to anticipate what type of technology the

19

Government may come up with, and perhaps you're correct

20

that if it's sufficiently sophisticated rather than

21

something that's very common and ordinary, then it

22

shouldn't be the burden of the citizen to anticipate what

23

they can't particularly know or may not know, and then

24

take safeguarding measures.

if thermal imaging becomes very common and every school

would be unreasonable not to expect that the Government

was going to use to it figure out what's going on in the

MR. LERNER:

I'm not saying that because I think

once we --

QUESTION:

9

MR. LERNER:

What's the effect of sophistication?
Well, at this point the effect of

10

sophistication is that it is not commonly used by normal

11

people in their every day life.

QUESTION:

Yeah, but in my example, the school

kids have all got thermal imagers.

Why not?

Why not?

I mean, people

would at that world, which is an odd world, all the time

be expecting everybody under the sun to know whether they

19

are taking baths or not.

under the sun to do it, you don't have an expectation of

privacy, just as is the case with binoculars.

22

doesn't that make the difference?

where the Court needs to say, we don't expect or even if

2

we do expect we do not want people to be intruding into

3

our homes and finding out things that heat can reveal

4

about our private activities.

5

QUESTION:

Okay, then if that's the case, then

6

the criterion of sophistication is not sufficient because

7

if that's the case, then when thermal images are no longer

regarded as sophisticated, when every kid has one, you are

saying we still may, in fact, find that there is a Fourth

into evidence.

So I think --

MR. LERNER:

QUESTION:

That's right.
-- you're getting -- I think you're

14

dropping your sophistication point as being determinative.

15

It may be helpful here, but if pushed you're saying, no,

that is not really what it turns on.

MR. LERNER:

That is not the value, that's

correct, and unfortunately we do have already technology

that the Court has already approved, such as field glasses

that nature without analyzing it under Katz or the vantage

MR. DREEBEN:

No, but what is picked up and what

13

is discerned is the exact reproduction of the words that

14

the person is speaking, and that is the invasion of

15

privacy that Katz was concerned with. The whole point of

16

Katz was not to look at it as a technological invasion or

17

to focus on whether the police actually went inside the

18

phone booth in order to acquire that information.

19

point was that the information that was acquired was from

to determine by a high probability analysis what the heat

coming from the building shows about its source within the

is being made of the sound waves that penetrate through

the phone booth in Katz.

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Souter, I think that

it's not only considerably less sophisticated, but it is

also picking up something that is very different in

character from the words that people speak within a

particular place.

13

on in Katz.

That is unquestionably a private and

that is lost is heat that's generated inside a structure

19

of power was going into the house, which logically

supports the inference that an abnormal amount of power

MR. DREEBEN:

But the critical point here,

2

Justice Souter is the thermal imager doesn't tell you that

3

he's lying in the house under sun --

4

QUESTION:

It doesn't tell you that because it

5

at this point is not sophisticated enough to do it, but it

6

takes you one step in the way.

7

this case, yeah, this abnormal electricity usage which is

8

showing up on the phone bill is apparently accounted for

9

by certain uses, I forget whether they were in the attic

It says, for example in

10

or someplace like that, so it's getting you one step in

11

the way of figuring out exactly what, in fact, the use is

12

that's causing the electric bill to go up.

13

doesn't get you 100 percent of the way the way the bug

does in Katz.

that will allow them to draw inferences about the inside

QUESTION:

Yeah, well, that's the question.

We

4

said in very narrow circumstances in Place that is true,

5

and we said in Katz where the inferential process is

6

simpler, all you really have to do is listen, that it's

7

not so, and I think what your argument boils down to is if

8

there are more interim steps to figure out what's really

9

happening inside than was necessary in Katz, it's okay,

10

it's not an invasion of privacy, and it doesn't violate

11

reasonable expectation, but if there are fewer steps, then

12

maybe it does.

13

Is that the nub of your argument?

MR. DREEBEN:

I think that the argument that I'm

14

trying to present, Justice Souter, is more complicated

15

than that because it's really focusing on the core

16

question of whether there are reasonable expectations of

17

privacy in heat loss, and in order to assess that --

18

QUESTION:

It's not in heat loss.

It's in what

19

is going on in the house, and I suppose it's a question of

20

what's going on in the house, and do you have a reasonable

21

expectation of privacy, do you have a reasonable

22

expectation that the kind of thing you're doing in the

23

house will not be picked up by somebody out of the house,

MR. DREEBEN:

I realize that -- the point that

you're making but I actually think that the physics of it

are that if you use more electricity, probably a lot of it

will end up as heat, but the point that the thermal imager

gives you is real-time information, that there actually is

you're saying here they're revealing the quantity of heat

come out differently if what was being learned was nothing

is that somebody was using the booth.

MR. DREEBEN:

That's right, and I want to --

We're very clear about this for

here something more than what you want to characterize as

the amount of heat or the amount of heat loss is being

revealed because the image is revealing a pattern, it is

probably don't know what's going on inside of those

consumption of energy, which is not private.

factor is that the imager is not picking up, again,

whole point of getting the warrant.

3

There's an element of circularity necessarily in our

opinions as a reasonable expectation of privacy because

expectation of privacy because this Court made the

that we don't want our private conversations intercepted

What is

Well, I think there are several

critical differences, Justice Kennedy.

The first is that

I think that's somewhat of an issue.

1

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, in addition, the fact that

2

heat is generated in a structure is largely a product of

3

the power that's going into the structure, the electrical

4

and other utilities that are brought into the structure,

5

and there's no secret about that information because it

6

comes from the utility company.

7

Third factor is that heat loss itself is

8

observable in a variety of circumstances without the aid

9

of any technology whatsoever.

In the examples of when

10

snow is melting on a house or when, for example, smoke is

11

in which the analogy would fit better; for example, where

there is a very active ventilation system that is

specifically attempting to draw the heat out of the house

in order to provide a suitable climate for growing the

details about what is going on inside of the house.
QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, what about a more

3

general proposition, that there is no unconstitutional

4

invasion of privacy when the police deduce from what goes

5

on outside the house what is going on inside the house,

6

intimate or not.

7

surveil a house over a long period and see people carrying

8

in hot dogs every day, and they can deduce that the eating

9

of hot dogs is going on in that house.

10

12
13

I suppose the police can certainly

And that is surely

no violation of the Constitution, is it?
MR. DREEBEN:

Absolutely correct, and I do think

that that illustrates -QUESTION:

If you accept that rationale, it

14

seems to me you would decide Katz differently if instead

15

of having the device on the roof of the phone booth they

16

had it six feet away.

17

MR. DREEBEN:

No, I don't think so.

I think the

18

whole point of Katz, Justice Stevens, was that that

19

physical intrusion is irrelevant.

20

information you were acquiring, and in Katz, and in the

21

hypothetical of removing the bug from six feet, the

22

information that you are acquiring is direct information

23

from inside the house.

24

It's a fusion of heat from a variety of sources.

very weak correlation between what's going on outside the

It's a

house and what's going on inside the house.

2

seeing a visual heat impression of a particular object

3

that's outlined as if it were in silhouette on the outside

4

of the house.

5

It's not like

Nothing of the kind occurs.

QUESTION:

Okay, but that gets back to I think

6

to the point, that it's the process of inference necessary

7

to reach the ultimate conclusion you want, e.g. marijuana

8

in the house, that makes the difference between a search

9

and a nonsearch and I guess makes the difference between

10
11

reasonable expectation and nonreasonable expectation.
MR. DREEBEN:

Certainly if what you are

12

acquiring is information that is not itself the product of

13

a search, as in Justice Scalia's hypothetical, the fact

14

that you can draw inferences, including very detailed and

15

intimate inferences about the inside of the house doesn't

16

convert the original observation into a search.

17

QUESTION:

Absolutely right.

But the question

18

here is whether part of that -- whether that information

19

is acquired as a result of a search so that you can't use

20

that rationale to answer the question in front of us.

21

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think that the opposite is

22

actually what holds true.

23

inferences can be drawn from the observations to

24

categorize the observations as a search.

25

QUESTION:

You cannot use the fact that

That's right.

That's exactly right.

1

But Justice Scalia had an inference, had a situation where

2

you use your eyes and your brain. Nothing against that.

3

Here they are using a machine. You keep telling me that

4

what's inside the house isn't that important, it's very

5

vague and general. What is the nature of the information

6

to do with it? I would have thought nothing.

7

somebody's inside the house singing Maresy Dotes, Doesy

8

Dotes, who cares what he's singing?

9

was singing it, and he was singing it inside his house. So

10

you're taking information from inside the house. Maybe our

11

problem is my seventh grade science class. I mean, I used

12

to think, perhaps wrongly, that sound went to a wall, then

13

the electrons start to vibrate in the wall, and pretty

14

soon the wave goes outside, and here it seems to me heat

15

goes to the wall, heats up the wall, and then the heat

16

goes outside, so I just find it difficult to distinguish

17

between sound and heat, but I find it easy to distinguish

18

in terms of whether a person inside the house has a

19

reasonable expectation that a lot of people outside the

20

house are going to be using this machine.

21

MR. DREEBEN:

If

The fact is where he

Well, but my seventh grade science

22

classes don't help me very much with this, either, and I

23

think what the Court's cases indicate is that it's not

24

essentially a science question. It's a question about, as

25

the latter part of your comment indicated, the reasonable

expectations that people have, and I think people have

2

different expectations about what is outside of their

3

house from what is inside of their house, and there are a

4

variety of ways --

5

QUESTION:

Right, good, that's exactly it. What

6

is it that would lead me reasonably to expect a lot of

7

these machines around picking up the heat?

8
9

MR. DREEBEN:

Probably very little, although so

far there has been some commercialization of thermal

10

imaging in cars that will help it detect animals in the

11

road and so forth, and there probably will be other uses

12

in the future.

13

whether thermal imaging is so prevalently in use that

14

everybody would expect it would be used on their house.

15

think the core question is whether the heat loss on the

16

outside of their house is sufficiently revealing of what's

17

inside of the house to be considered a search.

18

I don't think that this case turns on

MR. DREEBEN:

We

No, but the California versus

used for expectations of privacy.

The Court was clear in

10

that, but that doesn't mean that people do intrinsically

have an expectation of privacy that their houses are

QUESTION:

But if the device became more

1

begin to approach an x-ray device or some other device

2

that could actually penetrate the barriers of the walls,

3

and there the expectations that would be intruded upon

4

would not be simply heat leaving the house but would be

5

the very detailed activities that go on inside of the

house.

7

QUESTION:

Let me ask you a question. Does the

8

record tell us how extraordinary the amount of heat

9

produced by these lamps and so forth is as compared to

10

normal use?

11

slightly more?

12

Is it five or six times the amount or just

MR. DREEBEN:

I think there's information in the

13

search warrant that tends to show that they produce --

14

that they consume an inordinate amount of electricity, and

15

there is testimony that the halide lights that are used

16

for growing marijuana generate a high amount of heat.

17

QUESTION:

But they don't tell us what -- they

18

don't quantify that, say it's ten times as much the normal

use or anything like that?

or something, and here if you had heat that, you know,

2

really was a tremendous amount of heat you might say well

3

you really didn't expect that to be private, but we don't

4

measure it that way.

5

MR. DREEBEN:

The thermal imager doesn't really

6

measure it that way, either.

All it detects is relative

7

amounts of heat.

8

heat, and accordingly, officers tried to use a reference

9

structure.

It doesn't detect absolute amounts of

Now, they're going to have to draw a lot of

10

inferences by comparing one structure to another because

11

it's not a perfect control.

12

going on inside the house next door, and even the

13

inference that there's an anomalous amount of heat that's

14

going on in 878 Rhododendron Drive, which is what the

15

thermal imager produced in this case, is an inference that

16

depends on things that the officers don't really know,

17

that what is going on in the house next door that makes it

18

look cooler compared to the house that they're actually

19

surveying, and all of those factors contribute to make the

20

data that is obtained in this case qualitatively different

21

than the data that would be obtained in a wiretap case or

22

in a case where an x-ray-type device actually penetrated

the house.

on uses of the thermal imager other than the kind of use

2

that it was put to in this case. Thermal imagers are often

used in fugitive apprehension, in perimeter surveillance

for law enforcement, and for search and rescue operations

MR. LERNER:

is not correct.

it is information that they could not have determined any

other way.

23

I disagree with that.

If you look at the

It's not generalized heat loss, and

really going to lead down a difficult road for this Court.

protected or when is it going to be specific enough that

it should be protected?

3

that every case is going to turn on the specifics of the

facts which I think is going to be very troubling for

courts and for the police in the future, and really don't
