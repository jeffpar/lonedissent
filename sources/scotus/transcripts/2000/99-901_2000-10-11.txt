CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

next in Number 99-901, Brentwood Academy v. Tennessee

5

Secondary School Athletic Association.

6

Mr. Blumstein.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES F. BLUMSTEIN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This case involves the State action status of

12

the regulatory conduct of a high school athletic

13

association, the respondent, the Tennessee Secondary

14

School Athletic Association, or what we call the TSSAA.

15

Under the analysis of this Court's decision in

16

NCAA v. Tarkanian, State action exists in this case

17

because first, the regulatory conduct of the TSSAA is

18

attributable to the entity or entities that control the

19

organization and, secondly, Government institutions, in

20

this case public schools, control the TSSAA's conduct and

21

are therefore constitutionally accountable for its

22

regulatory conduct.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Blumstein, the court of appeals

24

in this case went through three different tests that they

25

thought our cases support, a public function, State
3

1

compulsion, symbiotic, and said this didn't fit into any

2

one of those three.

3

of appeals on those points, or do you think we should

4

simply expand the State action concept?

5

Now, do you disagree with the court

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, the court of

6

appeals did not look at the local level interactions

7

between the TSSAA and the public schools.

8

exclusively at the State-level relationships, and so we

9

think it overlooked the core ingredients of the Tarkanian

10

analysis.

It looked

11

It was the local-level interconnections.
There are two levels of State interaction with

12

the TSSAA.

13

Education for 24 years explicitly designated this

14

organization as its agent to regulate interscholastic

15

athletics for all schools in Tennessee.

16

At the State level, the State Board of

That was repealed, or changed in 1996, and now

17

it recognizes, continues to recognize the role of the

18

TSSAA and specifically authorizes the schools to maintain

19

their membership in the TSSAA and the court of appeals

20

focused exclusively on that State-level relationship.

21

Under the Tarkanian analysis, Your Honor, the

22

local levels, the public schools that control this

23

organization, that comprise 84 percent of the membership,

24

where there's one school, one vote, control the

25

organization and under the Tarkanian analysis we think
4

1

the --

2

QUESTION:

Well, would you state what you think

3

the test is, without being so fact-specific?

4

test for State action, in your view?

5
6

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Justice O'Connor, in this case,

building on the --

7
8

What's the

QUESTION:

Not in this case, in all cases.

What's the test?

9

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Well, whether the -- in this

10

case whether the governmental institutions, in this case

11

public schools, control the activity and so that it is

12

fair to say that this is attributable to the Government

13

because the Government, or its public schools in this

14

case, control the decisionmaking.

15

This is -- case is unlike many of this Court's

16

other cases, such as Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, involving a

17

school, Blum v. Yaretsky, involving a nursing home,

18

Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison, involving a private

19

utility.

20

the privateness, if you will, the formal privateness of

21

the organization was assumed, and the question was whether

22

the Government as purchaser, or Government as regulator,

23

transformed that private, concededly private entity into

24

State actor status.

25

In all of those circumstances, Justice O'Connor,

In this case, that very threshold question is
5

1

what is at stake.

2

formally private, about this organization.

3

controlled by public schools, 84 percent of the membership

4

is public schools, it's run by public --

5

There is nothing really private, except

QUESTION:

It is

Wait, let's -- it's controlled by

6

public schools.

You say that because a majority of its

7

board are public school principals?

8

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

9

QUESTION:

Of its members, Justice Scalia.

Of -- well, of its -- but principally

10

its governing board.

11

if its governing board, I assume, were overwhelmingly

12

governmental you'd say it's still a governmental agency.

13
14

It wouldn't matter if its members,

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Well, I think that under the

control principle --

15

QUESTION:

Oh.

You're relying on the

16

membership, not -- I thought you were relying on the

17

control.

18
19

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

On the composition.

We think

both are important, but it's --

20

QUESTION:

I see.

21

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

-- ultimately the control of the

22

organization in a one-school, one-vote situation is the

23

membership of the organization.

24
25

QUESTION:

So if this organization were composed

of 49 percent public school -- public schools and 51
6

1

percent private schools, it would be okay?

2

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Justice Scalia, we think there's

3

an analogy to the separation of powers cases, the

4

Washington Metropolitan Airports case, and Bowsher v.

5

Synar and the question of control -- there's an effective

6

control question and a formal control question.

7

anywhere close to the effective control question here.

8
9

QUESTION:

We're not

But in the Washington Airport case it

was the Government which said the decisionmakers here

10

shall be ex officio members of certain committees.

11

the Government that said that.

12

It was

Here it is not the Government, it is the

13

organization which has a rule that you have to be a

14

principal to be -- to serve on the governing board, and it

15

is the organization, certainly not the Government, that

16

says, you know, what schools will be a member, members of

17

the organization.

18

from --

19
20
21

It seems to me that's very different

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

But it is the organization

that's controlled by governmental institutions, so -QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Blumstein, supposing that

22

all the principals, say in Eastern Tennessee, or Middle

23

Tennessee, some area, got together, private schools,

24

public schools, and said we want to form a principals

25

association and get together once a month and we'll have a
7

1

convention in the summertime, and they don't get paid,

2

they do it on their own time, and they decide they're

3

going to give a principals' award to the best student in

4

Eastern Tennessee, and they give that award.

5

State action?

6

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Now, is that

Your Honor, if the

7

organization -- if they're serving in their official

8

capacity as principals, if they're representing the

9

schools, and if they are allowing private and public

10

schools to participate in some awarding process, whether

11

it be a principals' association or a German Club, if the

12

German departments of the State decided that they --

13

QUESTION:

Well, my hypothesis was that the

14

principals did it on their own time.

15

organization because they're a principal of a school, but

16

the Government isn't paying their way, and they're not

17

exercising any State power, really, when they do this.

18

They're just conceiving this award on their own and

19

they're giving it away.

20

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

They're in the

Your Honor, as one moves towards

21

the -- a coaches' association or principals' association,

22

I concede that it is conceivable that public officials

23

will have a nonpublic function, or nongovernmental

24

function that they can perform, and they would not be

25

State actors.
8

1

I think in this case the public officials are

2

serving because of their relationship to the school,

3

because they are the principals in the school, and the

4

clearest example of that is in the constitutional

5

provision of the TSSAA regarding vacancies.

6

If there is a person who is a member of the

7

board of control, or a member of the legislative council,

8

and that person's school disaffiliates with the

9

organization, then that person's term of office on the

10

board of control or the legislative council terminates, so

11

it is clear that these persons are not there as

12

individuals, but there as -- in their representative

13

capacity of the schools that they represent.

14

QUESTION:

You could have had the same rule in

15

the hypothetical that the Chief Justice posed.

16

rule have changed your answer to that question?

17
18
19

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Would that

Well, Your Honor, in this

case -QUESTION:

That sure doesn't seem to me to

20

establish whether the principal is serving as an agent of

21

the Government or is serving on his own.

22

that's the crucial question.

23

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

It seems to me

Well, I agree, Your Honor, and I

24

think that in this case, as the Government argues in its

25

amicus brief, that you have control linked with a
9

1

functional analysis as to what is the function that is

2

being performed, and here the public schools, all of which

3

have joined this organization, so that if you want to play

4

a game against a public school, you must either be a

5

member of this organization or you must get game-by-game

6

written approval by the organization.

7
8
9

QUESTION:
question.

Well now, that's a different

I mean, you have a remedy there.
I assume that there could be a constitutional

10

violation in a Government turning over its determination

11

of who will play in intramural sports to an organization

12

that is not providing due process, or to an organization

13

that discriminates on the basis of race, but that's not

14

the argument that you're making here, that it's improper

15

for the schools to deal with this organization.

16

saying this organization itself is the State.

17

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

You're

Well, we're saying that it's

18

controlled by governmental institutions, whether formally

19

we are -- we want to argue, following the Court's decision

20

in Lebron, that this is an arm of the State, or whether we

21

want to provide a bright-line rule so that we don't have

22

to traverse this difficult area of State action in every

23

case, this case is different from every other case that

24

the Court has decided in this regard because the control

25

is by governmental institutions, and the organization is
10

1

exercising a governmental function.

2

QUESTION:

And it hasn't --

3

QUESTION:

You say the control is by

4

governmental institution, and the principal of the school

5

goes to this -- sits on this board, or belongs to the --

6

by reason of the fact he's a principal.

7

control does the school he comes from exercise over him?

8

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

9

QUESTION:

10

What other

Over him?

Yes, or over his vote in the

association.

11

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Well, the --

I mean, does the record show?
The record only shows that the

14

vote must -- can only be done by a principal or by a

15

teacher of the school as the representative of the school.

16

We don't know exactly how control is exercised within the

17

institution of the Government, but this person is acting

18

in his or her official --

19

QUESTION:

How -- why do you say that?

20

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

21

Because the schools are the members of the

-- ex officio.

22

organization.

It's not the officials.

It's not a

coaches' association.

It's not an association of

1

QUESTION:

And -- but the fact that the

2

principals are joined in the organization by private

3

school principals too makes no difference?

4

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Well, the control in this case

5

is with the schools that run the organization and I think

6

under the circumstances the decision is fairly

7

attributable to the State.

13

thought this was run by a governing board, and your

14

complaint is that the governing board is what, elected by

15

all the principals, which come from mostly public schools?

16

I -- every issue isn't brought to the whole

How does the body adopt that rule?

23

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Okay.

In a one-school, one-vote -That is done on a floor vote?
Yes, and the as-applied
12

1

challenge focuses on the implementation, the disciplinary

2

proceeding, and that requires a decision at first by the

3

executive director, and then it was appealed through

4

the -- an internal procedure, appeals procedure,

5

ultimately ending up at the board of control, which is

6

this governing body, and they affirmed the decision and

7

ultimately the disciplinary action was taken by the board

8

of control, which was composed in the relevant time frame

9

of 100-percent public school principals serving ex officio

10

again.

11

QUESTION:

Do you have to -- if you're a school

12

that plays in this league, do you have to send somebody to

13

this organization to vote on such things as this rule that

14

you're objecting to?

15

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

16

QUESTION:

17

there on the floor?

18
19

Is there a duty to vote?

Is there a duty to have a person

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

I don't believe that there is,

Your Honor.

20

QUESTION:

So -- and although being a principal

21

is a condition of being a member, a voting member, can a

22

principal decide, I'm not interested in this and I won't

23

do it?

24

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

25

QUESTION:

Not to participate in --

Yes, not to participate in the
13

1
2

organization.
MR. BLUMSTEIN:

I believe the school can

3

exercise its right not to vote in the process, but they

4

have ultimate control and in Bowsher v. Synar we were told

5

that it is the ability to control, not how the control is

6

exercised, that is critical.

7

QUESTION:

8
9

Mr. Blumstein, isn't a question of

not simply control, but control over what?
For example, returning to the Chief's

10

hypothetical, if this were a group of principals meeting

11

not to make an award to a student for diligence, but were

12

meeting to set the curriculum that would be used in all

13

the schools within the association.

14

purpose of the principals' meeting, and what they decided

15

became the curriculum for the school --

16

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

If that's what the

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

There

17

has to be a mixture of the control and also an analysis of

18

the function, the governmental function that is being

19

performed and in this case you're quite correct, if it

20

were a curriculum matter, or in this case an

21

extracurricular matter that this Court in the Santa Fe

22

case talked about being a highly visible, Government-

23

sponsored school-related activity, under those

24

circumstances the allocation of this resource, the ability

25

to play against the public schools in sports, is the
14

1

public, or governmental function that is being performed

2

in this case.

3

It's part of the overall educational process of

4

the State of Tennessee, and it's part of the fabric of the

5

educational institution, and in the Santa Fe case this --

6

QUESTION:

So you would say it's just like if

7

they were having a body that would decide what will be

8

taught in the math courses in the schools.

9

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Well, Your Honor, if this -- if

10

the lower court is affirmed in this case, then we can

11

expect to have associations of the German department

12

chairs, and of the history department chairs and so forth,

13

and if the court of appeals is right in this, that all

14

that it takes is a formalistic change in a State-wide

15

rule, then we can see delegation and privatization I think

16

of many other areas of our school activity and

17

noneducational activity as well.

18

QUESTION:

In this case I suppose it follows

19

from your argument that all of the rules and regulations

20

that are promulgated by the association are promulgated by

21

a State entity, correct?

22

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

23

QUESTION:

From the TSSAA, Your Honor?

These are just like -- there are --

24

all rules and regulations they pronounce after -- if you

25

prevail will be State rules.

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

QUESTION:

members of this association?

4
5

If those rules --

Are there parochial schools that are

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

There are religious schools that

are members of this association.

6

QUESTION:

And so the result would be that all

7

rules and regulations must be governed by the First

8

Amendment, no crucifixes in the locker room.

9

be a permissible regulation.

10
11

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

That would

If the -- I'm sorry, if the

association promulgated --

12

QUESTION:

Under your view, all of the rules and

13

regulations are now the rules of the State actor, and

14

parochial schools are members of this body.

15

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Yes, Your Honor, the parochial

16

schools are members of the body, and if the organization,

17

the TSSAA had a rule that, for example, banned prayer at

18

games in which the organizations participated, then it

19

would be -- the rules would be subject to constitutional

20

scrutiny.

21

to constitutional scrutiny.

25

The rules of the association would be subject

QUESTION:

But do you agree that the -- even if

two parochial schools were playing each other?
MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Well, under the TSSAA bylaws,

schools do not have the authority to undo these rules.
16

1

They are bound to abide by the rules, and the rules

2

themselves would -- I think would be subject to scrutiny.

3

If a religious organization is uncomfortable with a

4

constraint upon its religious exercise, then it has the

5

ability to choose not to play against the public schools.

Well, I suppose we could say the same

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

position, Your Honor, but if you want to play against the

11

public schools --

QUESTION:

I thought you just said that was your

position with reference to the parochial schools.
MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Yes, Your Honor, but it

15

wouldn't -- I'm staying with the State actor status.

16

would be a State actor, and I'm trying to be consistent

17

with our position that the activity of the association as

18

controlled by these governmental institutions would be

19

subject to constitutional scrutiny, and if --

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

5

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
When a group of public schools, all State

6

actors, join together in an association to run a program

7

for students, that association is a State actor, too, and

8

its status should not change when it admits a relatively

9

small number of private school members.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

What if it admitted a huge number of

private school members?
MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, if the -- if it

13

admitted -- if the membership were more private school

14

than public school, it would cease to be a public entity

15

on the theory that we're advancing here.

16

to look at other questions.

17

why its actions should be attributed to the State, or they

18

might not be.

19

QUESTION:

One would have

There might be other reasons

Well, assume -- let's assume that it

20

performs the same function that is being performed here in

21

regulating public school contests.

22

that was a factor that ought to be considered, even though

23

the membership was predominantly private?

24

QUESTION:

5
6

Sure.
-- NCAA v. --

But that's one of the things you'd

look to?
MS. UNDERWOOD:

Absolutely.

Absolutely, but

7

this case is easier, because in fact -- well, Tarkanian

8

held that an association of mostly private colleges from

9

many States did not acquire State actor status from one of

10

its members, the member, the public university that was at

11

issue in that case.

12

be different if the members were largely public and from

13

the same State, and that's this case.

14

QUESTION:

The court noted that the case would

And it would be the case, I take it,

15

any State athletic association, given the current mix of

16

public and private schools.

17

MS. UNDERWOOD:

That's correct.

The litigation

18

against -- involving these associations in many States

19

across the country where the record shows the numbers,

20

shows similar numbers to this case -- that is, 80 percent,

21

or 85 percent public, the world could, of course, change

22

and then the issues might be different, but that is the

23

case in Tennessee and, as far as the cases show,

24

everywhere else as well.

25

QUESTION:

I wanted to see the cases you thought
20

1

most applicable, and in your brief at page 8 you cite the

2

Gerard College case, Evans and Newton, and Lebron.

3

I think Lebron is not so much in point because

4

there was a lot of top-down governmental delegation there

5

that is different than in this case, precise delegation

6

from the legislature, Pennsylvania and Evans, much closer.

7

In those cases, as I recall, the public trustees

8

were voting in their public capacity.

9

that's happening here as well, to you?

10

MS. UNDERWOOD:

11

happening here.

12

different, of course.

Is it clear that

It is clear that that's

I mean, each of these cases is slightly

13

QUESTION:

Sure.

14

MS. UNDERWOOD:

But in this case it is the

15

schools that are members, not the individual coaches.

16

They are members in order to provide a program for their

17

students.

18

public function, and this is a piece of that function, and

19

they represent their schools.

20

That's what schools do.

That's their general

So that it seems to me that there's no other

21

capacity in which they could be acting than in their

22

public capacity as officials of their -- of the public

23

schools.

24

the private school members are representing their private

25

schools, but they are a very small minority.

That is, the public school members.

21

Obviously,

1

And on the question whether it's the board or

2

the membership that's important here, it seems to me --

3

and membership isn't entirely the right way to describe

4

it.

5

and they can remove their board members, and so it seems

6

to me that the -- it is the membership.

7

it's not surprising that this membership has chosen

8

governing boards that are either exclusively or

9

overwhelmingly composed of public members, but --

10

These are voting members.

QUESTION:

They choose their board,

It happens that

What if the rules were changed so

11

that to be a delegate you didn't have to be a principal,

12

that you were just a parent from the school in question,

13

so there's a representative from each one of the schools?

14
15

MS. UNDERWOOD:
sort of association.

It would be less clear.

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. UNDERWOOD:

18

QUESTION:

19

Well, that would be a different

I know it would.
It would be less --

I know it would, but would it --

would that still be --

20

MS. UNDERWOOD:

21

QUESTION:

22

MS. UNDERWOOD:

It would be like --

-- State action?
It would depend on what that

23

parent's responsibility was.

It would be less -- I

24

understand your hypothetical to say that that parent does

25

not take direction, or cannot be directed by the school in
22

1

the way --

2

QUESTION:

Right.

3

MS. UNDERWOOD:

-- the school employee does, and

4

so I think it would be less clear to say then that the

5

schools control the organization.

6

QUESTION:

So this hinges on whether the

7

principals take directions from the school.

Is there any

8

indication that the principals act in anything other than

9

their own best --

10

MS. UNDERWOOD:

11

whether they in fact do.

12

schools and, indeed, in this case ultimately the State

13

legislature and the State Board of Education to whom the

14

schools are accountable have the capacity to give them

15

direction, that they act in their official capacity, and

16

whether they in fact give direction as to any particular

17

decision or not is not the point.

18

have the ability to do so.

19

QUESTION:

I don't think it hinges on
It hinges on the fact that the

The point is that they

Is that conceded, that the principals

20

could be instructed to vote a certain way in this

21

organization?

22

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, I don't believe the issue

23

was squarely joined, but they are school officials, and

24

the schools are members, and --

25

QUESTION:

Who instructs principals?
23

I thought

1

the principals instruct the other people in the schools.

2

MS. UNDERWOOD:

They do, but ultimately a

3

principal of a public school is accountable to a Board of

4

Education, and ultimately to the State Board of Education

5

or to the legislature.

6

QUESTION:

Oh, but do you think the Board of

7

Education is apt to tell a principal what to do when he

8

goes to these meetings?

9

the first place?

10

MS. UNDERWOOD:

I mean, is there any finding in

Well, the record establishes

11

that the State Board of Education so recognized the

12

important role of this association in the provision of

13

educational activities to its students that it has sent

14

members ex officio to the board meetings, and it has

15

reserved -- over an extensive period of time it reserved

16

the right to review the rules of the association, so I

17

think --

18

QUESTION:

That ceased, did it not, the review?

19

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, actually the district

20

judge found that nothing changed when the regulation

21

changed, so I'm not sure that it's fair to say that that

22

ceased.

23

It is true that the State Board of Education

24

revised the regulation that it had that expressly reserved

25

the right to review the rules.
24

It isn't clear that they

1
2

stopped reviewing the rules at all.
QUESTION:

In fact --

Is there any question that if the

3

State board did, in fact, instruct the principals by

4

passing a general standard that would be applicable to

5

these athletic contests that the principals would be bound

6

to follow the State board's rule?

7

For example, a State board says, no athlete will

8

be allowed to play in intramural games who is found

9

drinking beer within a month of the game.

10
11

I mean, would a

principal be free to disregard that?
MS. UNDERWOOD:

I don't think he would, but if,

12

under the particular structure of education in Tennessee

13

he might be, then it is surely within the power of the

14

Tennessee legislature to arrange things to give the board

15

that power.

16

That is, I don't know whether the board

17

currently has that power, although I would assume so.

18

it doesn't, Tennessee, as a State, in some capacity

19

certainly does have the power to instruct -- to direct the

20

conduct of public education in Tennessee, including the

21

rules that govern interscholastic athletics.

22

If

If this association is not a State actor, then a

23

gap will open up in the constitutional coverage of public

24

school programs, because schools may often collaborate in

25

providing programs for their students, not only in
25

1

athletics but also, for example, in language and travel

2

and music and art, in devising and administering

3

standardized tests, and that collaboration should not

4

shelter the programs from constitutional accountability.

5
6

QUESTION:

You don't think a line can be drawn

between German and sports?

7

MS. UNDERWOOD:

I do think a line can be drawn,

8

but in fact both the Tennessee Board of Education and

9

Boards of Education in general have regarded sports as

10

part of the educational program.

11

so, but they have done so here, and have typically done

12

so, and it's not -- it was suggested that it would be

13

sufficient to hold each public school accountable, but in

14

fact the individual public schools have no power one by

15

one to change the rules or the actions of the association.

16

They wouldn't have to do

Together they control it, but alone no one of

17

them does, so unless the association itself is regarded as

18

a public actor because it is the -- an aggregate of public

19

actors, then collective action by the association could

20

escape constitutional review.

21

QUESTION:

Perhaps I should have asked the

22

question of petitioner, but his time was running out, as

23

yours is.

24

paragraph says that for a school to be a member, its coach

25

must be a full-time employee of the Board of Education.

On page 8 of the blue brief, the first full

26

1

Does Brentwood's coach have to be a full-time employee of

2

the Board of Education, as you understand it?

3

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, that's my understanding of

4

the rules, but I'm really not sure of the answer to that.

5

Perhaps Brentwood --

6
7

QUESTION:

Because it seems to me that would

have certainly a bearing on the case.

8

MS. UNDERWOOD:

9

QUESTION:

10

I think that's correct.

Thank you, Ms. Underwood.

Mr. Colbert, we'll hear from you.

11

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. COLBERT

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

13
14
15

MR. COLBERT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
TSSAA's authority to enforce rules for high

16

school sports competition comes from the private choice of

17

the schools that join TSSAA to abide by those rules and

18

not from any authority given to TSSAA by the State of

19

Tennessee, and whether the court examines the case as the

20

Sixth Circuit did, using Jackson, and Blum, and Rendell-

21

Baker, and the U.S. Olympic Committee case, and Tarkanian,

22

and Sullivan, the result is the same.

23

The question is, where does the authority for

24

the power exercised by the association come from, and in

25

this case it is quite clear in Brentwood Academy's case
27

1

and in the case of the other member schools, it comes from

2

the decision, school-by-school, which each school is given

3

the choice to make under State law, of joining the

4

association and abiding by those rules.

5

QUESTION:

Suppose all of the schools in the

6

association were public schools.

Suppose everything is

7

the same, except that the organization is only for public

8

schools, and only public schools compete in these

9

competitions.

Would your answer be the same?

Based on

10

what you just said, I take it it would be.

11

wouldn't be a State actor, even if it regulated only

12

public schools.

13

MR. COLBERT:

It still

My answer would be the same, Your

14

Honor.

15

engaging in a function that is not a function that the

16

State of Tennessee has chosen to regulate by statute or by

17

constitution.

18

activity, high school sports competition.

19

competition, cheerleading, art competition, forensics --

20

It would not be a State actor because it is

The function involved is an extracurricular

QUESTION:

Like band

The students get some credit for

21

physical education, toward that requirement, from being on

22

this varsity team?

23

MR. COLBERT:

There is a statute, the only

24

statute in Tennessee that addresses interscholastic

25

athletics at all allows a local public school board, if it
28

1

chooses, to give credit for participation in

2

interscholastic sports or band, either one, to allow that

3

in lieu of physical, the required physical education

4

classes, but Tennessee does not regulate, the State does

5

not regulate, the State says nothing about, in

6

legislation, how interscholastic sports competitions from

7

one school to the next will be conducted.

8
9

Now, I would agree, Your Honor, that any
individual school would be a State actor in the decisions

10

that school makes for its own athletic program, but the

11

school, the principal of school A has no authority from

12

the State of Tennessee to regulate school B's athletic

13

programs.

14

QUESTION:

But why wouldn't the principal, when

15

he or she goes to the meeting and casts a vote, it seems

16

to me that that principal, when he or she casts a vote,

17

must be acting in a State capacity because that's why that

18

principal is there.

19

MR. COLBERT:

The principal is actually there in

20

a capacity -- and I need to clarify this, because I think

21

there was a misstatement made about how the rules get

22

adopted.

23

rules, and this is in the -- part of the TSSAA

24

constitution is in the appendix.

25

There's a board of control that enforces the rules.

The membership at large does not adopt the

29

There's a separate body.

1

There's a legislative council that enacts the rules.

2

also a nine-member representative body.

3

It's

The principals who are there, voting, who are on

4

that body, are serving in a representative capacity.

5

have been elected by the member schools, both public and

6

private, to serve in a representative capacity on that

7

board.

8
9

QUESTION:

They

Well, the record doesn't tell us, but

it's just incredible to me that the principal would not be

10

accountable to the Board of Education for the principal's

11

actions in voting.

12

MR. COLBERT:

13

QUESTION:

Well, the --

And it seems to me somewhat unlike

14

the Chief Justice's hypothetical of a principals'

15

association, because the principal is there in order to

16

advance the interests of the school as a school.

17

MR. COLBERT:

The principal is there on the

18

legislative council or on the board of control in order to

19

advance the interests of the voters who elected him and

20

represent -- to serve in a representative capacity on the

21

legislative council.

22

QUESTION:

That may be public schools -So in your view the principal would

23

be quite unconstrained by the Constitution from voting to

24

deny membership to a school because its athletes were

25

black, or Catholic, or something like that?
30

1

MR. COLBERT:

The principal as a representative,

2

as a representative of Brentwood Academy and any other

3

school who elected him, would not be accountable

4

constitutionally for that.

5

Now, if the principal of a public school does

6

not allow his school to participate, refuses to schedule a

7

contest against a school because of -- for

8

unconstitutional reasons, then he, as the principal of his

9

school, makes his school accountable for that, but he is

10

not acting as the principal of his school when he serves

11

on the board of control or the legislative council.

12

He's eligible to be on the board or the council

13

because he is a principal of a member school, just like

14

the headmaster of Brentwood Academy is eligible.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Except that's the only reason he's

there, is because he is the principal.
MR. COLBERT:

He -- well, he is there to further

18

the interests of the entire association, which includes

19

the public and private school members as well.

20

eligible to be there because he is a principal.

21

QUESTION:

He is

Is it theoretically possible that the

22

legislative council could be -- which enacts the rules

23

could be composed of a majority of private school

24

principals?

25

MR. COLBERT:

It's entirely possible, Your
31

1

Honor.

2

decide to run for the body and which principals are

3

elected to serve on the body, and there have been private

4

school principals or headmasters who have served on one

5

body or the other, so it's -- you could have -- even

6

though, because in the State of Tennessee, as in any other

7

State at the secondary level, there are more public

8

schools than there are private schools, there are going to

9

be more public schools engaged in extracurricular

10

It's strictly a function of which principals

activities than there are private schools.

11

QUESTION:

Mr. Colbert, you told me, and I think

12

you were quite candid in this, that it doesn't matter,

13

that you would be arguing the very same thing if this were

14

an association where the members were all public

15

schools --

16

MR. COLBERT:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. COLBERT:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Right.

-- and it excluded private schools.
Right.

Your argument would be identical to

what it is.
MR. COLBERT:

That's right.

That's right, and

22

I'm -- simply, in answer to Justice Scalia's question, you

23

could have an association that has 86 percent public

24

school membership, as TSSAA does, and have the entire

25

board of control consist of private school -32

1

QUESTION:

But that's surely more hypothetical

2

than real, because at least for this board, and every

3

other similar State association that we've ever heard of

4

either has either all public school on its board or

5

overwhelming majority.

6

operate in the real world.

7
8
9

MR. COLBERT:

That's in -- how these things

That's because there are more of

them and they're more -QUESTION:

Yes.

10

MR. COLBERT:

11

QUESTION:

And they're more likely to run.

And they might change, as counsel for

12

the Government told us, if there were a different mix of

13

school at some future time, but right now, these leagues

14

are overwhelmingly public.

15

MR. COLBERT:

But Your Honor, I don't know that

16

a different mix of schools would necessarily make a

17

difference in the governing body.

18

QUESTION:

No.

I think you've clarified that,

19

that if you're dealing with a universe that's all public

20

schools, your argument is still the same, no State action.

21

MR. COLBERT:

Well, if you -- and in the

22

Tarkanian case, for example, you were dealing with a

23

universe of, as reflected in the argument transcript,

24

roughly 1,000 schools, a roughly even split between public

25

and private schools, but you had a committee on
33

1

infractions that made the challenge decision there, and

2

four of the five members of the committee on infractions

3

came from public schools, so the make-up of the membership

4

at large does not necessarily dictate the makeup of the

5

governing body in the organization.

6

choice, just like --

7

QUESTION:

It is a function of

In that case the Court seemed to be

8

impressed by the fact that it wasn't -- any one State

9

could never have control of that organization.

You

10

couldn't belong to one State, because it covered all the

11

States.

12

MR. COLBERT:

Well, that's right, Your Honor,

13

but there was also -- there were also some other issues in

14

that case, such as whether UNLV as a single State actor

15

had delegated its authority to regulate its athletic

16

program to the NCAA, and whether that delegation was

17

sufficient to make the NCAA a State actor, and the Court

18

said no, because there was no statutory or constitutional

19

requirement that UNLV engage in interscholastic athletics

20

at all, much less that it defer to the NCAA for the

21

regulation of interscholastic athletics.

22

And you have the same thing in Tennessee.

There

23

is no statutory or constitutional requirement that any

24

school, public or private, have an interscholastic

25

athletic program, much less that they defer to the TSSAA
34

1
2

to regulate that program.
QUESTION:

Does the record tell us if there are

3

any private, substantially equivalent league which is --

4

well, any league which is made up of all private schools

5

which is substantially equivalent?

6

MR. COLBERT:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. COLBERT:

9

The --

In the State of Tennessee?
The record itself does not --

there is some mention of that in the brief, Your Honor,

10

that there is one in East Tennessee, but that's not in the

11

record itself.

12

QUESTION:

While I've got you on the facts, is

13

it correct where the blue brief says at page 8 that for a

14

school to be a member its coach must be a full-time

15

employee of the Board of Eduction?

16

MR. COLBERT:

17

QUESTION:

There --

Is Brentwood's coach a full-time

18

member of the Board of Education?

19

MR. COLBERT:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. COLBERT:

No, he is not.

There is a --

Full-time employee.
There is a rule that as you read

22

it, and if you apply it to -- in the public school context

23

it would require a public school coach to be an employee

24

of the public school system.

25

QUESTION:

Just in the public school context?
35

1

MR. COLBERT:

Not -- right, and the key is so

2

that the coach is not somebody off the street who has no

3

accountability to the member school.

4
5

In Brentwood Academy's case, the coach would
have to be an employee of the member school.

6

QUESTION:

So it -- but it wouldn't rule out a

7

part-time coach, I take it, so long as the part-time coach

8

was an employee rather than an independent contractor?

9

MR. COLBERT:

That's right.

It allows for --

10

and actually the rule -- the rules now do allow some

11

assistant coaching from individuals who are not full-time

12

employees of the school.

13

Every aspect --

14

QUESTION:

But the main coach, even in the

15

private school, would have to be a full-time employee?

16

Because the rule as quoted on page 8 says, have a

17

Tennessee State teacher's license, be a full-time

18

employee.

19

for the main coach, not the assistant coach?

20

main coach be a full-time employee of Brentwood under

21

these rules?

22
23
24
25

How does it work now for the private schools,

MR. COLBERT:

Must the

The coach is -- the head coach is

expected to be a full-time employee of the school.
QUESTION:

So that this rule, to the extent that

it requires a full-time employee, does apply to private
36

1

schools as well.

2

MR. COLBERT:

It applies to private schools,

3

except that they're not required to be -- the term Board

4

of Education connotates a public school board.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. COLBERT:

7

And that's not -- the rule does

not apply to private schools in that respect.

8
9

Yes.

QUESTION:

But it does in other respects.

That

is, full-time employee --

10

MR. COLBERT:

Of the school.

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

12

QUESTION:

May I ask whether you think your

13

client was a State actor before -- 1995, was it, they

14

changed the rules?

15

MR. COLBERT:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. COLBERT:

1996.

1996.
No, Your Honor, we do not.

TSSAA

18

was formed in 1925 without any involvement of the State.

19

TSSAA operated for 47 years, until 1972 without any

20

involvement of the State.

21

In 1972, the State Board of Education on its

22

own, without any legislative action, without any

23

constitutional authority, passed an administrative rule

24

designating -- it doesn't -- the language of the rule is

25

important.

It doesn't delegate to TSSAA.
37

1

It designates TSSAA as the association for

2

public schools to join for their -- for the regulation of

3

their interscholastic athletic programs, but that

4

designation is no more than an authorization, or an

5

acquiescence by the State in the function of the private

6

entity, which this Court has held over and over, back

7

starting with Jackson and Blum and Rendell-Baker, that

8

State acquiescence, State approval of the private actions

9

of a private entity is not tantamount to State action and

10

does not convert the private entity's acts into State

11

action, and that's what you have here.

12

And in fact, analytically speaking, the argument

13

of the petitioner that somehow the makeup of the board of

14

control converts TSSAA's action into State action is

15

really no different than the principle that this Court has

16

rejected in Rendell-Baker, which is extensive State

17

regulation of a private entity does not convert the

18

private entity's --

19

QUESTION:

But there's something really

20

different about that Rendell-Baker and -- and here, it's a

21

public official being paid by the State, goes to meetings.

22

It's not out of his own pocket, is it, the principal, when

23

he goes to the board it's on State time, or municipal

24

time, whoever hires him?

25

MR. COLBERT:

The record reflects that there
38

1

have been times when meetings were held during the school

2

days, meetings of the board of control or the legislative

3

council.

4

They're held on Saturdays or in the evenings.

5

There are other times when meetings are not.

QUESTION:

Is the principal expected, out of his

6

private purse, to fund his participation in this

7

organization?

8

MR. COLBERT:

There -- yes.

9

strictly up to the local people.

I mean, that's left

There is no requirement

10

in the State of Tennessee, in the law, that a principal be

11

reimbursed for service on the board of control.

12

QUESTION:

Do you know what the practice, the

13

custom or practice is?

14

MR. COLBERT:

I could not tell you what the

15

custom or practice is, Your Honor.

16

different customs and practices from one person to the

17

next and one school system to the next, and I think in

18

some systems there is some reimbursement, I think in

19

others there is not.

20

QUESTION:

I think there are

Could the State Board of Education,

21

if it so chose, say we're no longer going to rely in any

22

sense upon this organization, and we ourselves will set

23

the rules for intramural contests?

24

authority legally to do that?

25

MR. COLBERT:

Would it have the

Yes, Your Honor.
39

I believe the

1

State Board of Education would have the authority to do

2

that.

The State --

3

QUESTION:

So that what this organization, then,

4

is doing in effect is filling the vacuum created by the

5

choice of the State Board of Education not to regulate.

6

MR. COLBERT:

That's correct.

The State Board

7

of Education, the State of Tennessee has chosen not to

8

regulate interscholastic athletic competition, and let me

9

clarify that.

The State Board of Education has the

10

choice, if it wants to regulate interscholastic athletic

11

competition among public schools in Tennessee.

12

have the choice to regulate that competition among private

13

schools.

It has the choice to regulate among public

14

schools.

It has chosen not to.

15

QUESTION:

It doesn't

But it could -- if it were the

16

regulator in the first instance it, I presume, would have

17

the authority to say that no public school may engage in

18

an interscholastic contest with a private school unless

19

these rules are observed.

20

authority, wouldn't it?

21

MR. COLBERT:

That would be within its

Yes, but it has -- the State of

22

Tennessee -- and that's an important part of Fourteenth

23

Amendment jurisprudence, Your Honor, is the entire premise

24

of the State action doctrine is to, a) ensure that private

25

parties are free to conduct themselves as private parties
40

1

without constitutional restraint, and b) to ensure that

2

the State does not have to take responsibility for every

3

private activity that it allows to occur, simply because

4

it does not exercise its extreme authority to take over

5

certain responsibilities.

6

QUESTION:

I suppose in Jackson v. Metropolitan

7

Edison the Pennsylvania legislature could have legislated

8

and controlled what Metropolitan Edison did.

9

MR. COLBERT:

The Pennsylvania legislature could

10

have taken over responsibility for providing electric

11

service to residents rather than leaving it up to a

12

privately owned utility to provide that service.

13

State chose not to involve itself in that activity, and

14

the Fourteenth Amendment State action requirement gives

15

the State that right without the State having to take

16

responsibility simply because it could have taken over

17

something.

18

QUESTION:

The

Isn't there a difference -- and maybe

19

there isn't historically in Tennessee, but isn't there a

20

difference in the fact that intramural athletic contests

21

are sort of accepted as a standard part of the educational

22

scheme, whereas State provision of electric power is not?

23

Is that a fair distinction?

24
25

MR. COLBERT:

No, Your Honor, I don't believe

that is a fair distinction.

At least in Tennessee I don't
41

1

believe it is, because interscholastic athletic

2

competition in Tennessee has been something that's been

3

entirely voluntary for the history of that competition,

4

dating back all the way to 1925.

5

requirement that any public school have interscholastic

6

athletic competitions --

7

QUESTION:

There has never been a

All right, but since 1925, I take it,

8

it has been the common practice of the schools in

9

Tennessee to engage in interscholastic athletic contests.

10

MR. COLBERT:

Well, it is, but it varies from

11

one school to the next, and even among public schools,

12

what activities they may engage in for --

13

QUESTION:

But nobody in Tennessee would say,

14

when they heard that the X school was having -- was

15

engaging in interscholastic athletics, no one in Tennessee

16

would say, what are they doing that for, that's crazy for

17

a school to be doing that.

18

MR. COLBERT:

No.

That -- well, they might.

19

They might when they find out they're engaging in swimming

20

competition, for example.

21

Tennessee --

Tennessee?

25

MR. COLBERT:

There are schools in Tennessee -42

in Tennessee, swimming competition is very unusual.

MR. COLBERT:

In Tennessee, hockey competition

is very unusual, but there are schools that have it.

It's

Mr. Souter's from New England.

QUESTION:

Different mores.
It's -- now, football --

Yes, what have they got against

hockey?
MR. COLBERT:

It's a bit unusual to say someone

13

doesn't play football, but in Tennessee there are sports

14

like swimming, for example, that some schools have chosen

15

to engage in and to compete in, and compete for

16

championships in.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

TSSAA doesn't even regulate -Okay, but the basic point is, schools

customarily play each other in Tennessee.
MR. COLBERT:

That's right.

That's right.

But

20

that, we submit, Your Honor, does not establish State

21

action simply because it is an action that's customarily

22

engaged in.

23

QUESTION:

I thought that there was a finding

24

in -- that the principals who attend these meetings are

25

customarily reimbursed.
43

1

MR. COLBERT:

There was not -- there's a --

2

there is a statement in the petitioner's brief about that

3

that suggests that the meetings of the board of control

4

occur during the school day, and that the principals are

5

reimbursed, but there's -- that does not appear in the

6

record, that I'm --

7

QUESTION:

8

Do you dispute that as a matter of

fact?

MR. COLBERT:

Yes, Your Honor.

There is no standard practice in that respect.

They may occur on a school

They may occur on a Saturday.

In this case there are several problems with the

that cause that rule of law to run contrary to the

Fourteenth Amendment.

22

rule -- and this is even consistent with the Solicitor

23

General's remark.

24
25

The first problem is that the

The rule proposed by Brentwood Academy would
mean that if schools in extra -- in any extracurricular
44

1

activity compete with each other in Tennessee, that -- the

2

regulation of that interscholastic activity is going to

3

amount to State action regardless of how it's conducted.

4

Forensics, band competition, cheerleading competition, any

5

sort of regulation of those activities would all be State

6

action.

It would -QUESTION:

On the other hand, if your position

8

is right, then this association, where most of the members

9

are public school principals, can decide as far as the

10

Fourteenth Amendment is concerned, we don't want to have

11

any teams for girls.

12

teams to boys.

We're going to limit our varsity

MR. COLBERT:

The -- you have to distinguish

14

between what the association can do and what the

15

individual schools can do.

16

could not do that, and if an individual -- and that's one

17

of the problems with the amicus briefs in this case, is

18

they suggest that there's no remedy for any sort of

19

discrimination if you hold that TSSAA is not a State

20

actor, and that's simply not the case, because an

21

individual public school still makes the choice of whether

22

it's going to be a member of the association or not, and

23

whether it's going to abide by the rules or not, and if --

QUESTION:

An individual public school

No, but that association could impose

that rule on Brentwood.

It could say, Brentwood, if you

want to be a member of our association you can't let women

participate in intercollegiate sports, or interscholastic

3

sports.

QUESTION:

7

MR. COLBERT:

And Brentwood Academy would be

Right.
And any public school would be

8

free not to join the association, and if a public school

9

joined the association and followed a rule like that,

10

there would be constitutional recourse against that

school, or against that local school board.

turn the actions of the association itself into State

action.

QUESTION:

Even though the people who have made

up that rule are the very same principals of the schools

that would be sued individually?

That's right.

That's right, but

And even though they're appearing in

that body as a representative of their school, not as an

individual?

Well, that's -- that's where I

disagree, Your Honor.

They're not appearing as a

representative of that school.

They're appearing as an

example, to constitutional challenge.

you are subjecting the private schools --

If you're going to

Oh, but that's not right.

I don't

6

think there's any claim that Brentwood is a State actor,

7

is there?

8
9

MR. COLBERT:

Well, I don't think there is a

claim that Brentwood is a State actor, but if you allow

10

the Constitution -- if you allow the Fourteenth Amendment

11

to reach the individual schools not by challenge to the

12

action of an individual school, but by challenge to the

13

action of the association, then you're allowing the

14

Fourteenth Amendment to reach the private school members

15

of the association as well.

No, you're just allowing it to say

that the rules that the association imposes on its members

would not be a State actor.

That doesn't mean that the individual

But the association has no power

to impose those rules --

Well, but that's one of the issues.

MR. COLBERT:

-- except to the extent that the

47

1

The -- ultimately, this case really goes back to

2

Justice O'Connor's first question when Mr. Blumstein stood

3

up and that is, what should the test be and I think, as

4

Justice O'Connor mentioned in the dissent in the Amtrak

5

case, if you look at Blum, if you look at Rendell-Baker,

6

if you look at Jackson, if you look at all the different

7

cases that have phrased the test in all different ways,

8

they really come back to whether the challenged action

9

results from a matter of private choice, and that's

10
11

exactly what you have here.
Membership in TSSAA, service on the board of

12

control, following the rules or not following the rules is

13

a matter of private choice.

14

private choice that it wanted to play in the TSSAA and

15

compete for TSSAA championships, and now it doesn't want

16

to follow the rules, and that's what this case is about.

17

QUESTION:

Brentwood Academy made the

Well, surely it's not a matter of

18

private choice whether a public school chooses to join the

19

association or not.

20

decision is an official public school decision?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES F. BLUMSTEIN

9

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

10
11
12

Thank you, Mr. Colbert.

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
The TSSAA has been very candid in stating the

13

breadth of its position, but I'd like to point out on page

14

32 of its brief their position seems to be that even a

15

coach who is a public school teacher and a public school

16

official is not a State actor, so their position is that

17

extracurricular activities are so outside of the scope of

18

public accountability that even if there is a decision by

19

a coach about a decision affecting athletic contests, that

20

that does not fall within State action.

21

The other -- another point on the question of

22

control, in the joint appendix at page 89 and page 92 it

23

makes it pretty clear that the principals are

24

representatives of the school in voting on the legislative

25

council and on the board of control, and joint appendix 89
49

1

and 92 sets that out.

2

And finally, I would like to just indicate, we

3

haven't talked about the existing state of the law, but

4

this circuit, the Sixth Circuit decision is the only

5

decision that finds a comparable institution not to be a

6

State actor.

7

law has been settled for over 30 years.

8

concerns that the respondent has I think have not been

9

manifested.

This case is an outlier in that sense.

The

Some of the

10

The way that the courts have dealt with the

11

issue of reviewing decisions of these associations is

12

through a proper level of deference on a matter of

13

substantive law, and so if the Court affirms below it will

14

be unsettling what has been settled law in every

15

jurisdiction that has heard this case for 30 years.

Thank you, Your Honor.
