ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID I. BRUCK

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. BRUCK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

In this case the State of South Carolina raises

11

three arguments designed to evade this Court's prior

12

decision in Simmons v. South Carolina.

13

Carolina supreme court cited a -- an extraneous feature of

14

a post-Simmons amendment which, the main thrust of which

15

was to abolish parole in all cases of murder, to hold that

16

Simmons v. South Carolina does not apply to South

17

Carolina.

18

First, the South

Secondly, the State argues that even though

19

Simmons recognized a due process right to inform the jury

20

that the defendant was ineligible for parole, arguments of

21

counsel and instructions of the court that never did that

22

nevertheless somehow satisfy the due process requirements

23

of Simmons in any event, and finally the State argues,

24

seizing on a single word culled from the opinions in

25

Simmons, the word argue, submits that because counsel
3

1

rather self-evidently, out a desire to evade and avoid the

2

due process rule in Simmons, declined to drive home in

3

jury argument their future dangerousness case as it had

4

been presented to the jury, therefore the rule in Simmons

5

was not triggered.

6
7

QUESTION:

decision here did not really reach that issue --

8

MR. BRUCK:

9

QUESTION:

10

was argued, did it?

11
12
13
14

Well now, the court of appeals

MR. BRUCK:

No.
-- of whether future dangerousness

No, it didn't.

I should note that

-QUESTION:

I think the trial judge thought that

the prosecutor had not, in fact, made that --

15

MR. BRUCK:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. BRUCK:

Yes.

The trial judge --

-- argument.
-- focused entirely on this word

18

argue which, of course, came from Simmons, because Simmons

19

was a case where the State presented no evidence in the

20

penalty phase, no new evidence in aggravation, except, I

21

think, for the indictments about Simmons' prior record,

22

but all the facts of his prior conduct had come in in the

23

guilt phase, and what the court did in Simmons was present

24

a veiled metaphorical argument which a majority of the

25

Court found to raise the issue rather indirectly.
4

1
2

QUESTION:

You said the court presented a veiled

metaphorical argument.

3

MR. BRUCK:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. BRUCK:

Excuse me.

The prosecutor.

The prosecutor -- yes.
The prosecutor presented a veiled

6

metaphorical argument that the majority of this Court

7

found raised the specter of future dangerousness in the

8

Simmons case, and therefore on occasion members of this

9

Court in the various opinions in Simmons referred to the

10

rule in Simmons as one involving a triggered-by argument

11

relative to future dangerousness.

12

However, at other points in the opinions the

13

Court also used terms such as, where the prosecution seeks

14

to demonstrate.

15

I think that was the formulation in --

QUESTION:

Well, Justice O'Connor's opinion in

16

that case, which two of the rest of us joined, does say

17

that one of the conditions of Simmons is the prosecution

18

argued that the defendant will pose a threat to society in

19

the future.

20

MR. BRUCK:

21

QUESTION:

22

holding of the case?

23

MR. BRUCK:

Yes.

In formulating --

Why shouldn't we take that as a

Because of the fact that at other

24

points in Justice O'Connor's same opinion she used the

25

term, show future dangerousness, where the State seeks to
5

1

show that the defendant would be dangerous in the future.

2

It --

3

QUESTION:

Well, even if we thought that future

4

dangerousness must be argued or, as you now put it, shown,

5

the supreme court of South Carolina didn't reach that

6

question.

7

MR. BRUCK:

8

QUESTION:

9

That's correct.
So what we really are left looking at

here, I suppose, is whether this other sentencing option

10

that the trial judge would have if the jury does not find

11

an aggravating circumstance would trigger Simmons.

12

MR. BRUCK:

That's correct, and here I think the

13

State court is simply confused about what Simmons

14

required.

15

The South Carolina procedure is that the -- a

16

jury is instructed to determine first whether any

17

statutory aggravating circumstance is shown.

18

Georgia-type nonweighing statute in which the finding of

19

an aggravator is a threshold finding.

20

instructed, pursuant to the statute, and this jury was

21

instructed that if the jury does not unanimously find the

22

existence of a statutory aggravating factor, it goes no

23

further.

24
25

It does not sentence.

This is a

The jury is

It simply reports its

failure to find the aggravator to the judge, and the judge
6

1

sentences, and at that point the judge has the option, and

2

only under those circumstances the judge has the option of

3

either imposing a 30-calendar-year sentence or life, of

4

course without the possibility of parole.

5

QUESTION:

Would I be right to observe -- maybe

6

it's not right.

7

third option, or was it instructed to that effect?

8
9

Did the jury know in this case about this

MR. BRUCK:

They were not instructed about the

30-year option because it's none of their concern.

10

were simply told --

11

QUESTION:

They

So far as the jury knew, it was

12

determining just between life imprisonment, however they

13

might define that, and the capital punishment.

14

MR. BRUCK:

Well, that's correct, because that's

15

all the jury needs to know.

16

the jury finds an aggravating factor, then and only then

17

the jury becomes the sentencer.

18

don't need to know about parole.

19

about aggravation, mitigation.

20

anything.

21
22
23

QUESTION:

That's the jury's job.

Once

Prior to that time, they
They don't need to know
They don't need to know

And the 30-year alternative doesn't

exist if aggravating circumstances have been found.
MR. BRUCK:

That's -- if they have them, that's

24

exactly correct, and so the judge correctly told the jury,

25

if you find aggravation, then you become the sentencer,
7

1

and there are only two alternatives, the death penalty or

2

life imprisonment.

3

This is exactly the situation in Simmons.

It

4

cannot be distinguished.

5

-- if the jury never acquires sentencing responsibility in

6

the first place, there is another option.

7

reason why the jury should know about that.

8

of their job.

9

The only difference is that the

There's no
It's not part

It's not part of their responsibility.

The State supreme court just yesterday filed

10

another case which my friend helpfully filed, lodged with

11

the court yesterday, State v. Kelly, in which the court

12

finally explained its rationale -- this is the State

13

supreme court -- for this holding.

14

It said in Kelly that where another sentence

15

other than life without parole was available to the

16

defendant as an alternative to the death penalty -- this

17

is at page 11 of the slip opinion -- then a Simmons charge

18

would actually mislead the jury by representing that the

19

defendant would never be released from prison, when, in

20

fact, a 30-year sentence is a potential sentence for the

21

defendant.

22

Now, it's clear what has happened.

23

explanation doesn't appear in the Shafer case or in the

24

accompanying Starnes case, but now apparently the South

25

Carolina supreme court is laboring under the misconception
8

This

1

that a Simmons instruction is a prediction to the jury as

2

to the defendant's fate, rather than an explanation of the

3

sentencing option of life imprisonment that the jury is

4

given.

5

Of course, the Simmons instruction is the

6

latter.

7

is going to happen to the defendant as of this moment,

8

when the jury hasn't yet found aggravation.

9

It has nothing to do with a prediction about what

In any event, none of this really matters.

10

The -- it's quite clear, I think, that Justice Kennedy's

11

plurality opinion in Ramdass, which we quoted in our brief

12

and, indeed, in the question presented in the cert

13

petition, three times stated the holding of Simmons in a

14

way that precisely encompasses this case.

15

He said, the parole eligibility instruction

16

is -- of Simmons is required only when, assuming the jury

17

fixes the sentence at life, the defendant is ineligible

18

for parole under State law.

19

the opinion only to instances where, as a legal matter,

20

there is no possibility of parole if the jury decides the

21

appropriate sentence is life imprisonment, and I can go

22

on.

23

Simmons applies elsewhere in

That is the holding of Simmons.

That is the

24

holding which was clearly violated in this case and which,

25

according to the South Carolina supreme court, no longer
9

1

applies in South Carolina.

2

been made and we submit that it should be corrected.

3

Now, clearly a mistake has

This leaves the question of what to do with this

4

case.

The State asks you to remand the case back to the

5

South Carolina supreme court to perform the rest of the

6

Simmons analysis.

8

9

that future dangerousness had not been placed in issue in

We submit that the case has been fully

Surely if the South Carolina supreme court thought

10

this case, they would not have gone to such a

11

constitutionally tenuous attempt to reconsider the first

12

--

13

QUESTION:

Well, yesterday's --

14

QUESTION:

The -- go ahead.

15

QUESTION:

Yesterday's case -- is it

16

Williams? -- or Kelly, the Kelly case does indicate that,

17

to me that the South Carolina supreme court takes a very

18

formal view of the issue of future dangerousness.

19

it seems to me that the argumentation by the prosecution

20

was really much more geared towards future dangerousness

21

even than yours, and even in that case the supreme court

22

of South Carolina thought that that issue had not been

23

submitted to the jury in a way to trigger the Simmons

24

instruction.

25

MR. BRUCK:

There

Yes, before Kelly I would have said
10

1

that the South Carolina supreme court required the word

2

dangerousness to actually be used in jury argument.

3

Kelly they actually used the word dangerousness, and

4

apparently that's still not enough, so I was coming around

5

to saying that while I had thought that South Carolina did

6

not accept the State's argument on the dangerousness prong

7

of Simmons, Kelly does cast that into some light.

In

8

Certainly, this whole little saga leaves us with

9

the -- I think should leave the Court with some confidence

10

that it's time to decide this case, the whole aspect of

11

it.

12

QUESTION:

Do you associate yourself with the

13

position that was taken by a friend on your side that

14

inevitably, in any capital murder case, future

15

dangerousness is present as a factor, so that it isn't a

16

case-by-case thing, that the jury in every case is

17

determining whether it's going to be death rather than

18

life?

19

MR. BRUCK:

Well, as a lawyer who tries these

20

cases in the trial court I think there is considerable

21

merit to that view, but I don't endorse it or embrace it

22

on behalf of my client, because there's no need to.

23

rule in Simmons is workable and is certainly more than

24

enough to warrant relief in this case.

25

QUESTION:

The

When --

Mr. Bruck, you said that the State
11

1

asks us to remand.

2

first ask us to affirm and then say, if the Court decides

3

to reverse it, it should be remanded.

4
5
6

MR. BRUCK:

As I understand their brief, they

I stand corrected.

That is what

they ask.
Now, it is possible to imagine cases which do

7

not raise future dangerousness.

We should keep in mind,

8

though, the nature of the South Carolina statute, in which

9

it is especially difficult, I agree, to draw a line.

10

This is a very open-ended statute, in which there is no

11

limitation on the nonstatutory evidence that the jury may

12

consider as weighing on the death side of the question.

13

Once a statutory aggravator is found, in this case the

14

entire penalty phase showing by the State consists of

15

Wesley Shafer's prior convictions for criminal sexual

16

conduct and burglary, his failure as a, quote, high-risk

17

probationer, who is incapable of rehabilitation, according

18

to the State's claims and evidence, who is prone to angry

19

outbursts of explosive behavior even in the highly

20

restrictive confines of the Union County jail, and who

21

exhibits lack of remorse and lack of insight about his

22

prior behavior.

23
24
25

Now, this is a classic showing of future
dangerousness.

This is exactly why --

QUESTION:

It has to be future dangerousness to
12

1

the general public.

I mean, one assumes that any brutal

2

murderer is going to be dangerous in the prison setting.

3

As I understand Simmons, the only reason it's relevant to

4

the jury to know whether this person will be paroled or

5

not is because the jury is worried that he will be a

6

danger to the general public.

7

He'll be a danger to other inmates in the prison

8

whether he's going to be paroled or not, so don't you have

9

to establish that what has been argued is future

10

dangerousness to the general public?

11

MR. BRUCK:

Yes, but the fact that a person is

12

dangerous in prison is ipso facto evidence that if the

13

bars are removed, and the jail door is opened, and he's

14

allowed to go into the far less protected and restrictive

15

environment of society -- I mean, it would be farcical to

16

argue, well, this person will be dangerous in prison, but

17

if you let him out there's no reason to think he won't do

18

just fine.

19

The State supreme court, I submit, has become,

20

with all due respect, confused on this issue as well and

21

in the --

22

QUESTION:

So you're saying that a prosecutor

23

cannot argue that, you know, the death penalty is the only

24

adequate remedy here because this person is a brutal

25

murderer.

He has killed before in prison.
13

There is no

1

assurance that if we just put him into prison he will not

2

kill again in prison --

3

MR. BRUCK:

4

QUESTION:

Certainly --- and you're saying if the

5

prosecutor makes that argument, Simmons is triggered,

6

because obviously if he's going to be dangerous in prison

7

he's going to be dangerous out of prison, although the

8

prosecutor does not make that point.

9
10
11
12

MR. BRUCK:
QUESTION:

Yes, and -But you're saying you can't say he's

going to be dangerous in prison?
MR. BRUCK:

He can say it, but the defense is

13

entitled to Simmons instruction, and seven members of this

14

Court joined opinions which said that in Simmons.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. BRUCK:

The --

Which said what?
Which said that the -- that when a

17

Simmons instruction is given, of course the State may

18

still show -- Justice O'Connor's plurality opinion made

19

this point, as did the -- Justice O'Connor's concurrence,

20

as did the plurality opinion.

21

that he will nevertheless be dangerous in prison, but

22

everything must come out.

23

The State may still show

There is no warrant whatsoever for saying that

24

someone is so dangerous that he will kill again in prison

25

and yet pretend as though the jury is not going to draw
14

1

the inevitable common sense conclusion that if he's that

2

dangerous in prison, with concrete and bars all around

3

him, he will also be dangerous if he's released on parole,

4

and if there's any doubt --

5

QUESTION:

Well, but that doesn't necessarily

6

follow so far as I can see.

7

restrictive environment, and a person who is prone to

8

dangerousness might well confine themselves in prison

9

during -- under constant supervision.

10
11

I mean, prison is a much more

He gets out, and he

isn't under any supervision, and might behave differently.
MR. BRUCK:

That is exactly my point, that the

12

fact that even under all this supervision he is

13

explosively angry, and the jailer has to slam the door,

14

the cell door to constrain his rage when his -- the

15

telephone is cut off --

16

QUESTION:

This argument proves too much.

I

17

mean, it just washes the Simmons requirement that you have

18

argued future dangerousness out.

19

I mean, suppose the prosecution just shows

20

during the course of the trial -- he never argues

21

dangerousness, but he shows this is a person with a mean,

22

nasty temper, uncontrollable, many instances of killing

23

many, many people.

24

you're making now, it's obvious to the jury that this

25

person's going to be dangerous if we let him out again,

You could make the same argument

15

1

and therefore a Simmons instruction has to be given.

2

I don't think that that's what we said in

3

Simmons.

4

dangerousness be argued.

5

--

6

I think in Simmons we required that

MR. BRUCK:

If it's not argued, then, then

Well, if that had been the holding

7

of Simmons, then Simmons would stand for the very strange

8

proposition that the State is entitled to prove future

9

dangerousness, to call witness after witness, and indeed

10

that's what they did here, and the State's own pretrial

11

notice described this evidence as evidence of future

12

dangerousness.

13
14

QUESTION:

I dissented, of course, so I do think

it stands for a strange proposition, but --

15

(Laughter.)

16

QUESTION:

17

Can you tell me -- I don't want to

take you too far away from this case.

18

MR. BRUCK:

19

QUESTION:

That's okay.
In other States that do apply Simmons

20

almost as a matter of course, do many of those refrain

21

from giving this instruction of future dangerousness if

22

it's not argued?

23

MR. BRUCK:

No.

In fact, this is an argument

24

which has almost run its course in the entire Nation.

25

our count there are 37 States that have a policy, statute,
16

By

1

rule or court decision on this issue.

2

jury the law about parole release, which in most cases is

3

no parole release.

4

35 of them tell the

The only States in which Simmons has any

5

application at all, and I include South Carolina here,

6

although the State supreme court says it has almost none,

7

are Pennsylvania and South Carolina, and Pennsylvania, the

8

Pennsylvania supreme court is divided 4 to 3 on whether to

9

give a Simmons instruction in every case, and there is an

10

arguable distinction in Pennsylvania that does not apply

11

in South Carolina, a way of distinguishing the two States,

12

which is that in Pennsylvania aggravation is limited.

13

This Court knows the statute from Blystone v.

14

Pennsylvania.

15

factors may be considered as reasons to impose the death

16

penalty, and future dangerousness is not one of them, so

17

in theory there is nowhere for the jury to give

18

aggravating weight to the likely dangerous behavior of the

19

defendant.

20

State supreme court has required that a Simmons

21

instruction be given.

22

Only designated statutory aggravating

Nevertheless, when the argument is made, the

That is the entire roster of States that don't

23

just tell the jury what's going to happen if they spare

24

this man's life, so as I say, this is an issue, a debate

25

which is really to all intents and purposes virtually
17

1

over, except in South Carolina.

2

Now, part of -- I think part of the proof

3

that -- and it does not depend on the jury's questions,

4

but the jury's questions really remind us that we really

5

have encountered a pretty serious problem here.

6

why did they ask?

7

if not for the fact, having found an aggravating

8

circumstance and turned to their sentencing

9

responsibility, they were worried about whether he was

The jury,

Why would they have asked about parole,

10

going to get out or not because he was dangerous.

11

is relevant because of future dangerousness, and that is

12

probably what was happening.

13

Parole

The prosecutor's evidence, his case of

14

dangerousness, did resonate with this jury, which is

15

entirely to be expected.

16

if -- if an actual formal argument or statutory allegation

17

were required to trigger the rule in Simmons, then it

18

would be entirely all right for the prosecution to do

19

everything they could through evidence --

20

QUESTION:

As I was getting ready to say,

Well, Mr. Bruck, suppose -- I take

21

it, does the Governor in South Carolina have the power to

22

pardon?

23

MR. BRUCK:

No.

No.

We are one of only two

24

States in which the Governor has only clemency power over

25

the death sentence.

He cannot reduce -- this is as
18

1

airtight a system as the mind of man can devise.

2

without parole in South Carolina means just that.

3

is a statutory provision which by its terms requires the

4

most extraordinary circumstances.

5

noted --

QUESTION:

There

In Simmons, this Court

That statute can be amended, I

presume, right?

8

MR. BRUCK:

9

QUESTION:

10

Life

Yes, of course.
You can't really tell the jury he

will never get out of jail.

11

MR. BRUCK:

But that's not the instruction we

12

asked for.

13

language about parole.

14

The instruction we asked for was the statutory

QUESTION:

Well, supposing in a State where the

15

Governor does have the power to pardon, and the court

16

says, we want to give -- we want you to give a Simmons

17

instruction, could the State say, well, in addition to

18

that, please say that the Governor does have the authority

19

to pardon this defendant?

20
21

MR. BRUCK:
v. Ramos.

Yes.

You so decided in California

That's --

22

QUESTION:

So that -- okay.

23

QUESTION:

In those cases, let's say a Simmons

24

instruction is given, can the prosecution stand up and

25

say, well now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, it's true
19

1

that there's life parole, but you know, these legislatures

2

change things, and 10 years from now this defendant may

3

get out.

Would that be proper argumentation?

4

MR. BRUCK:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. BRUCK:

No.
Has that ever been passed on?
It never has been passed on, but

7

that is a -- that is a peculiar problem, because to argue

8

that the law that must guide the jury is like ice, it's

the jury with a rather brutal fact that only death is

wants to know whether this person is going to be a danger

to the general public, it seems to me you have to advise

17

them of that.

18

That law isn't directed to the jury.

It's

reads, but there's a great anti-capital punishment

proposition is that States enjoy broad discretion under

California v. Ramos to tell all sorts of things like this

said, you know, will he get -- does life in prison mean

earlier, you think that that alone would trigger Simmons,

MR. BRUCK:

You know,

10

the capital case tried before this one, in this very

11

courtroom in Union County, South Carolina was the case of

12

the State of South Carolina v. Susan Smith.

a paradigmatic example of a case in which future

dangerousness was not at issue.

18

Now, there are rare cases, but family murders, for

circumstances are certain never to recur, do not implicate

future dangerousness.

argument that we need to make, because the reason, in this

case, the jury probably asked is that the State proved

at it, as they said they were going to do in their

pretrial notice.

I think that is the

Mr. Bruck, you said a moment ago that

stated to the jury, he'll never get out of prison because

15

the alternative is life without parole.

16

Certainly the defense counsel could have

MR. BRUCK:

No, Your Honor.

As a matter of

17

fact, counsel requested the right to read that statute to

18

the jury.

19

ordered him not to do it, and as a result, all he was left

20

with was various metaphors for the term, life

21

imprisonment, which by its terms -- I mean, if you analyze

22

it closely --

23

The State opposed the argument, and the judge

QUESTION:

Well now, are you saying that -- in

24

South Carolina do you have to submit in advance your

25

arguments to the other side?
23

1

MR. BRUCK:

No, you don't, but in the course of

2

argument about the statute, the -- about the jury

3

instructions, defense counsel I think very properly, when

4

the court indicated he wouldn't give the charge, counsel

5

said, well, I would at least like to read to the jury,

6

which of course Simmons says is another way to take care

7

of this problem, this statute, and the prosecution said

8

no, that will educate the jury about parole and you can't

9

do that either, and the judge sustained the State's

10

position, so he said nothing about parole, and the jury

11

clearly noticed the omission.

12

QUESTION:

Well, that's a different problem.

13

That's not the problem you're complaining about here.

14

mean, that may well be a violation not to let counsel

15

argue it.

16

quite a different question from whether a State must

17

require the judge to instruct the jury concerning it.

18

I

Whether a State has to let counsel argue it is

MR. BRUCK:

Well, in this Court -- in this case,

19

seven members of this Court said that it was all

20

encompassed within the Simmons rule, and that's the way it

21

was addressed in this case.

22
23

QUESTION:

Was that part of your assignment of

error, that counsel was not allowed to read the statute?

24

MR. BRUCK:

No.

25

QUESTION:

Okay.

We did not make that a --

24

1

MR. BRUCK:

-- a separate assignment of error.

QUESTION:

That might well have been a problem.

MR. BRUCK:

If I may, Your Honor, I would like

to reserve the remainder of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD J. ZELENKA

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9
10
11

MR. ZELENKA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In the 1994 decision of Simmons v. South

12

Carolina, Justice O'Connor in her concurring opinion

13

stated that when the State puts the defendant's future

14

dangerousness in issue and the only alternative sentence

15

to death is life imprisonment without possibility of

16

parole, due process entitles the defendant to inform the

17

capital jury by either argument or instruction that he is

18

parole-ineligible.

19

For three separate reasons, we submit the South

20

Carolina trial judge in 1998 did not violate due process

21

or the mandates of this Court in Simmons in failing to

22

specifically instruct the jury that the petitioner was

23

parole-ineligible.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, you want us to interpret the

concurring opinion in Simmons as a formal submission of an
25

1

aggravating factor of future dangerousness as the basis

2

for triggering the Simmons requirement.

3

there's other language in the concurring opinion that goes

4

somewhat further than that.

5

often emphasize the defendant's future dangerousness in

6

their evidence and argumentation at the sentencing phase.

7

That's not a formal -- of future dangerousness in the

8

sense of a statutory aggravating factor.

9

MR. ZELENKA:

There -- I think

It says that prosecutors

We're not asserting, and South

10

Carolina does not have a formal statutory aggravating

11

factor of future dangerousness.

12

of evidence concerning the defendant's character as a

13

fact.

14

QUESTION:

It allows the admission

I understand that, so we're talking

15

about the argumentation that's made at the sentencing

16

phase.

17

MR. ZELENKA:

That's correct.

Based upon

18

argument or evidence, the issue of future dangerousness to

19

society is what would be necessary in this particular

20

case.

21

we think that the South Carolina supreme court

22

appropriately followed the mandates of Simmons in making

23

its determinations that Simmons did not apply because

24

there was at the time --

25

For the reasons that we've set forth in our brief,

QUESTION:

Well, the supreme court, as I read
26

1

the opinion, really rested its holding on this new

2

sentencing option for the trial judge of 30 years in the

3

event the jury did not find an aggravating factor.

4

MR. ZELENKA:

5

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And it really didn't reach the

6

question of whether future dangerousness was argued or

7

presented.

8
9

MR. ZELENKA:

question of whether future dangerousness --

10
11

It did not appear to reach the

QUESTION:

No, so are you going to talk about

the ground that the supreme court rested on?

12

MR. ZELENKA:

13

QUESTION:

Yes, I am, and --

And if you do that, it seemed to me

14

that at the time the jury was instructed and given an

15

instruction about what it could do, that it was told if

16

they found an aggravating circumstance, then its options

17

were life imprisonment or death, right?

18

MR. ZELENKA:

19

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And the jury is not told about what

20

might happen by sentencing by the trial judge if they

21

don't find an aggravating circumstance.

22

MR. ZELENKA:

They were not told in this

23

situation.

24

aggravating factor they should stop.

25

They were told if they did not find an

QUESTION:

Well, I would think that Simmons
27

1

would apply to the jury instruction at that stage,

2

assuming future dangerousness is in the case.

3

MR. ZELENKA:

We believe that the South Carolina

4

supreme court correctly decided the case because when the

5

jury instructions were given, after the jury arguments

6

were made there was another option that was available for

7

sentencing, and that option was a 30-year sentence --

8
9

QUESTION:
jury.

That option was not available to the

It had nothing to do with what the jury was told

10

its function was.

11

would not apply, assuming future dangerousness was at

12

issue.

13

I just don't understand why Simmons

MR. ZELENKA:

Because the question as to whether

14

that statutory aggravating circumstance existed, which was

15

the factor which would make a determination as to whether

16

the 30-year-without-parole option was available, had not

17

been decided by the jury at that particular time, so when

18

it was facing its decision --

19

QUESTION:

Well, but that's what the jury had to

20

decide.

If it found an aggravating factor, then its

21

options were life imprisonment or death, and the jury sent

22

around questions saying, what does it mean if it's life

23

imprisonment.

24

MR. ZELENKA:

25

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And I would have thought that Simmons
28

1

would be triggered there, despite the fact that if they

2

found no aggravating circumstance, then something else

3

would --

4

MR. ZELENKA:

Okay, well, we think they were not

5

faced with the false dilemma that this Court was concerned

6

with in Simmons, because there was a potential that he, in

7

fact, would be released from prison.

8
9

QUESTION:
before it.

10
11

It was not a potential the jury had

I just don't understand this argument at all.
QUESTION:

It was not a potential the jury knew

anything about.

12

MR. ZELENKA:

The jury did not know anything

13

about it, but it was still faced with the situation that

14

its decision did not create that false dilemma because, in

15

fact, he would be available to be released in society

16

based upon a determination the jury made, that

17

determination, whether in fact an aggravating factor

18

existed.

19

At the time that question was asked, at the time

20

the jury was making its determinations, that aggravating

21

factor had not been found, and in fact he was still

22

available to be sentenced to be released from prison.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Zelenka, just as a matter of

24

curiosity, since this new option came in for the judge

25

alone, not for the jury, in capital murder trials in South
29

1

Carolina, on how many occasions has the jury failed to

2

find an aggravator so that the judge would be sentencing

3

under the 30-year mandatory minimum?

4
5

MR. ZELENKA:
number.

I'm not aware of that particular

I apologize for not knowing that, Your Honor.

6

QUESTION:

Have there been any?

7

MR. ZELENKA:

I could not say that there have

8

not been any.

Those cases generally would not have been

9

brought to my particular attention.

10

QUESTION:

11

this judge option of 30 years?

12
13

MR. ZELENKA:

The statute became effective in

January 1996.

14
15

And how long has it been in force,

QUESTION:

So there would have been some time,

if --

16

MR. ZELENKA:

There has been some time in that

17

option.

18

is, of course, one of fact.

19

a reasonable doubt its existence depends upon a matter of

20

proof which goes to the judge.

21

The existence of a statutory aggravating factor
Whether the jury finds beyond

There has been sentencing under that option.

22

Now, whether that was done based upon the jury's failure

23

to find the statutory aggravating factor or another

24

reason, it's unclear to me.

25

plea situation where they have sentenced beyond that 30-

It may have been a guilty

30

1

year mandatory minimum up to a sentence of 40 and 50

2

years.

I am aware of those situations.

3

QUESTION:

I'm not clear on your answer.

Have

4

there been cases, capital murder cases where the jury has

5

failed to find the aggravator --

6

MR. ZELENKA:

7

QUESTION:

8

What I'm --

-- that they were charged they could

find?

9

MR. ZELENKA:

It's -- I do not have a true

10

understanding as to whether the jury did not find those

11

factors, or whether it was a guilty plea situation

12

where --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. ZELENKA:

15

Oh, a guilty plea, yes.
-- the judge did not find those

factors --

16

QUESTION:

Right.

17

MR. ZELENKA:

--

for a bench trial.

I do know

18

that there have been sentences above that 30-year

19

mandatory minimum sentence.

20
21

QUESTION:

Which could have come about as a

guilty plea?

22

MR. ZELENKA:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. ZELENKA:

25

That's correct.

Okay.
It's our position, as we've

stated, because the finding of the statutory aggravating
31

1

factor is not a ministerial act, up until the time the

2

jury enters its verdict, that in fact the potential for

3

release into society is still there, and it was no false

4

dilemma --

5

QUESTION:

Well, I think you're right, as a

6

metaphysical matter, for a moment in time this was like

7

Ramdass.

8

a functional standpoint, the jury didn't know anything

9

about it, and that's what Simmons is directed to.

10

There were more than two options open.

MR. ZELENKA:

But from

They did not know anything about

11

it, but if they had been advised as to what the actual

12

answer is particularly to their question, they would have

13

been advised, yes, there is an option that is available

14

for release, a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence, which

15

would cause him to be possibly available for release at

16

that time, while those deliberations were going on.

17

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose that you would agree

18

that if there were a trifurcation here, and the jury first

19

found that there was an aggravating factor and then came

20

back, then the Simmons instruction would have to be given

21

if future dangerousness was going to be --

22

MR. ZELENKA:

Yes, that would be correct.

23

would be consistent with this Court's decision in the

24

Simmons case.

That

25

For the second reason, we submit that future
32

1

dangerousness was not presented in this case, Simmons was,

2

in fact, not triggered.

3

QUESTION:

We agree that --

Before we get to that, could a

4

defense attorney say, judge, I want you to bifurcate.

5

First tell the jury, come and say whether or not they find

6

an aggravator, and that would set the defense up to get

7

the Simmons charge.

8
9

MR. ZELENKA:

There's nothing in our particular

statute that I see that would have prevented that

10

situation from occurring.

I don't know how it would have

11

been set forth.

12

there's nothing in the statute, necessarily, that would

13

have prevented that situation from occurring.

14

asked for in this case.

It may require some statutory change, but

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. ZELENKA:

It was not

Has it been asked for in any case?
I'm not aware of it being asked

17

for in any of the cases that have gone up to the South

18

Carolina supreme court, which would be three cases, the

19

Shafer case, the Starnes case, and the Kelly case that was

20

decided yesterday.

21

With respect to the second issue, we submit that

22

while the South Carolina supreme court did not expressly

23

decide future dangerousness as additional sustaining

24

grounds, Simmons did not apply in this situation because

25

future dangerousness was neither presented by the evidence
33

1

nor argued in this particular situation by the prosecutor

2

from Union County.

3

Particularly, this Court determined that when

4

the State argues future dangerousness, it urges the jury

5

to sentence an individual to death so that he will no

6

longer be a threat to society.

7

presentation that was made in this particular case by the

8

prosecution.

9

determination of the sentencing instructions, the trial

That was not the

In fact, at the time, prior to the

10

judge conceded that future dangerousness had not been

11

presented in this case.

12

The prosecutor, recognizing the ability in

13

Simmons that it was their option to not argue future

14

dangerousness, which would not bring the parole issue

15

before the jury, chose not to do that, and expressly

16

stated to the court that it was not going to do that.

17

QUESTION:

I thought the prosecutor argued that

18

the victim, or somebody in the store had kept saying, they

19

might come back, they might come back, and then he tells

20

the jury, remember, remember, they might come back, they

21

might come back, and he presented quite a lot of evidence

22

that this person had committed other crimes, and that he'd

23

even committed crimes when he was in custody, and that he

24

didn't show any remorse.

25

I mean, what's that telling the jury?
34

It sounds

1

the jury might conclude from that that what he's worried

2

about is they might come back, including this man.

3

MR. ZELENKA:

I think your -- the petitioner's

4

assertion is taken somewhat out of context.

5

phrase, they might come back, that was raised at the time

6

of the crime itself by individuals who came upon the crime

7

12

In the

QUESTION:

What the --

I thought he repeated that in

argument, didn't he?

13

MR. ZELENKA:

He repeated it in argument about

14

the circumstances of the crime, when the victims came upon

15

the crime -- when the victims, witnesses came upon the

16

crime scene at that particular situation, but then he

17

followed that up with, in utilizing the phrase, they might

18

come back, that was not directed towards this defendant

19

may come back, but it was directed towards other

20

individuals who may come into the counties of South

21

Carolina.

22

It was an argument not for specific deterrence

23

of this defendant, but for general deterrence for society

24

as a whole to make that determination, that a death

25

sentence in this case, based upon the facts and
35

1

circumstances of this crime, not the circumstances of the

2

defendant, would be appropriate.

3

QUESTION:

Of course, we wouldn't care if they

4

came back if they weren't going to be dangerous when they

5

got back, would we?

6
7

MR. ZELENKA:

Well, that was part of -- I mean,

that was what the victims said at the time of the crime.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. ZELENKA:

10

QUESTION:

No, I'm addressing -The emotional trauma --

I'm addressing your point about the

11

argument, and you just said that what they were concerned,

12

what the prosecutor was concerned with was that other

13

persons, other than this defendant might come into the

14

county.

15

MR. ZELENKA:

16

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And my suggestion is that I don't

17

suppose that would have been relevant unless those

18

persons, when they came into the county, would be

19

dangerous, and if that's true, it sounds like a future

20

dangerousness argument that would apply not only to those

21

other people, but to this person.

22

MR. ZELENKA:

23

No, it was not phrased as that.

There was nothing --

24
25

Isn't that so?

QUESTION:
that.

Well, I know it wasn't phrased like

sentence.

What he was asking for was a

15

It was not a question -QUESTION:

Would it be fair for me to infer from

16

this record and from what I read in the Kelly case that's

17

just been submitted that prosecutors in your State

18

sometimes are a little careful about arguing future

19

dangerousness so that the Simmons instruction will not be

20

triggered?

21

MR. ZELENKA:

I think they recognize the

22

language from Justice O'Connor's statement to say if

23

future dangerousness is not argued, then parole

24

eligibility does not become an issue for the jury, so they

25

are cognizant of that particular situation.
38

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. ZELENKA:

3

As a tactical decision.
They're making that as a tactical

decision --

4

QUESTION:

That seems to me to --

5

MR. ZELENKA:

-- realizing the benefits and the

6

concerns that it would have.

7

QUESTION:

Well, that seems to me to indicate

8

there's a very strong reason for Simmons instructions to

9

be given, because it does affect what the jury's going to

10

do.

11

MR. ZELENKA:

What they're -- what they

12

understand that it's doing is to try to not raise that

13

issue, where there may be some due process concerns.

14

QUESTION:

Well, what's the matter with telling

15

the sentencer what the statutory scheme is?

16

such a problem?

17

says?

18
19

Why is that

Why not just tell them what the statute

QUESTION:

It was just three lines, three or

four sentences.

20

QUESTION:

I just don't understand that.

21

MR. ZELENKA:

Well, I think -- I think first off

22

is we've asserted in the third argument the statute was

23

initially given to them when they were told on three

24

occasions that life imprisonment means until the death of

25

the offender, or life imprisonment means incarceration
39

1

until the death of the offender.

2

QUESTION:

The concern --

Well, but they weren't read the one

3

or two sentences that strictly follow that from the

4

statute.

5

It takes 30 seconds to read it, if that.
MR. ZELENKA:

I understand that, and in the

6

South Carolina supreme court we believe, following this

7

Court's mandate in California v. Ramos, believes that as a

8

policy that, in fact, the jury's attention should be

9

directed towards the characteristics of the defendant and

10

the circumstances of the crime and not other potential

11

release mechanisms which may exist also.

12

QUESTION:

It was the prosecutor's decision.

13

mean, if the prosecutor had given the instruction, the

14

supreme court wasn't going to somehow revoke it.

15

it was up to the prosecutor, wasn't it, whether to agree

16

to allow the statute to be read?

17

MR. ZELENKA:

I

I mean,

Well, it's up to the trial judge

18

to make a determination as to what is consistent with the

19

law, and under the decisions of the South Carolina supreme

20

court they have held --

21

QUESTION:

But if the prosecutor said, judge,

22

we're perfectly willing to have the statute read, that

23

would be okay, wouldn't it?

24
25

MR. ZELENKA:
that.

The prosecutor could have said

The judge would not have been bound by the
40

1

prosecutor's statement.

2

follow the decisions of the South Carolina supreme court,

3

which consistently have said, parole eligibility is not an

4

appropriate factor for a juror's consideration, in the

5

same way that they have implicitly said the other

6

collateral matters of potential release are not

7

appropriate matters.

8
9

QUESTION:

The trial judge would be bound to

I suppose if the prosecutor had said,

I have no objection to the giving of a Simmons

10

instruction, that would not necessarily have meant it

11

would have been given if the trial judge had felt it was

12

not consistent with the rulings of the South Carolina

13

supreme court or this Court.

14

MR. ZELENKA:

That's correct.

The prosecutor

15

may have been willing to do it, the defense counsel may

16

have been willing to do it, but the trial judge

17

necessarily would not have had to do it under the decision

18

of the supreme court, which expressly says it's not

19

supposed to be given except when future dangerousness is

20

argued.

That was the land of the law --

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Zelenka --

22

MR. ZELENKA:

23

QUESTION:

-- at that time.

-- what other State -- do you know if

24

any other States are relying upon our language in Simmons

25

that said that future dangerousness had to be argued?
41

1

MR. ZELENKA:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

I mean, suppose we changed that in

3

this case and just said, oh, foo, it doesn't matter

4

whether it's argued or not, what State would have their

5

judgments of conviction and death penalty overturned?

6

MR. ZELENKA:

Pennsylvania would be directly

7

affected by it.

The cases we cite in Pennsylvania look to

8

whether an argument of future dangerousness is given.

9

They've determined arguments or evidence of future

10

dangerousness are not given when they have an aggravating

11

factor, if the defendant has a prior history of violent

12

crimes, when his prior record is presented.

13

the same way we submit the South Carolina supreme court

14

has been looking, as to whether in fact future

15

dangerousness is there.

16

They look, in

In fact, I believe the Pennsylvania supreme

17

court says future dangerousness has to be specifically

18

pointed out to the jury for that argument to in fact come

19

in, so Pennsylvania would be also directly affected by

20

whether that future dangerousness --

21

QUESTION:

Your opponent tells us that South

22

Carolina and Pennsylvania are the only two States who are

23

sort of the rear guard against giving the Simmons

24

instruction.

25

you tell what is the State's interest that's really served

Just so you have a fair opportunity, would

42

1

by refusing to give the instruction that most States seem

2

to think pretty ordinary?

3

MR. ZELENKA:

Well, I think the State interest

4

is basically that the supreme court of South Carolina

5

wants the jurors to focus on the particular

6

characteristics of the defendant and the particular

7

circumstances of the crime, and not be concerned with

8

potential collateral matters such as potential release

9

which may divert the attentions to some speculative issue

10

which may not in fact ever occur, that in fact the life in

11

prison that they would get with the jury sentence, whether

12

it's parole-eligible or not, may, in fact, under the

13

unique characteristics of this defendant, be as much as a

14

life sentence whether there's parole eligibility or not,

15

that he would serve the entire time in prison.

16

Again, addressing one of the questions about the

17

existence of pardon, pardon exists in South Carolina.

18

It's not in the hands of the Governor.

19

of the South Carolina Department of Probation and Parole.

20

They make that determination, so that also does exist as

21

soon as a conviction is entered on any inmate in South

22

Carolina.

23

MR. ZELENKA:

It's in the hands

I suppose that a State could game

24

the system, couldn't it, by providing for parole

25

eligibility even when there is a life imprisonment
43

1

sentence but appointing a parole commission that is so

2

tough that it never gives parole.

3

instructed that unless you condemn this person to death,

4

there's a possibility that he'll be paroled, although in

5

fact the possibility's not very realistic.

6

MR. ZELENKA:

Then the jury would be

I think that's the State interest

7

that is concerned about going into those collateral

8

matters, that in fact those issues may weigh upon the

9

jurors' decision but may not, in fact, be what exactly

10

happens, because the parole board may be such that it

11

would never parole.

12

always paroles, but again there's -- they're elected every

13

4 years, essentially, in South Carolina and that may

14

change every 4 years, so we can't predict how that

15

situation would arise any more than pardon, any more than

16

a change of law.

There may be a parole board that

17

We submit that the instructions that were given

18

in this case adequately complied with South Carolina law.

19

Further, if -- we also submit that in fact what occurred

20

in this case should be seen to satisfy Simmons because, as

21

I said, the jury was instructed on three occasions that

22

life imprisonment in fact means until death of the

23

offender, that life imprisonment in fact means

24

incarceration until the death of the offender.

25

not the -44

That is

1

QUESTION:

But when a jury asks -- I mean,

2

obviously this jury thought that was ambiguous because

3

they asked the judge, in effect, what does it mean --

4

MR. ZELENKA:

5

QUESTION:

They --

And the judge did read the statute up

6

to that point, life imprisonment means until death of the

7

offender, right?

8

MR. ZELENKA:

9

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And just didn't go on with the rest

10

of the statute, which would have made it plain what that

11

meant.

12

MR. ZELENKA:

Well, we take the position that it

13

was plain that life imprisonment means until the death of

14

the offender in fact means imprisonment until the death of

15

the offender.

16

understand that, and --

17

Reasonable juries we think should

QUESTION:

But when the judge couples that with

18

a statement, now, don't you worry about parole, that's

19

none of your business, the implication is that there is

20

such a thing.

21

MR. ZELENKA:

Well, consistent with South

22

Carolina law they said that parole eligibility or

23

ineligibility is not for your consideration, but that

24

followed the language that life imprisonment means until

25

the death of the offender.

We think a juror should have
45

1

understood that to mean, in fact, that he will be in

2

prison forever.

3

QUESTION:

But if that's the case it would be

4

just harmless to give me -- it would be harmless to give

5

them the additional sentence, if you're reading is

6

correct.

7

doubt?

8

Why not read the other sentence and remove any

MR. ZELENKA:

Because under South Carolina law

9

they were required under State v. Southerland to limit the

10

way that answer was made, and the judge was complying with

11

the South Carolina law mandate on that, but also the jury

12

did not appear to be confused because, consistent with

13

this Court's opinion in Weeks v. Angelone, they're

14

presumed to follow their oath and instructions, and they

15

did not come back and ask a further question after they

16

received that information.

17

The defense counsel was not prevented from

18

making his argument that the defendant, in fact, would

19

serve life in prison, in jail.

20

with the information the defense counsel made, they

21

stated, and it's set forth at page 39 and 40 of our brief,

22

that the question is, will the State execute him, or will

23

he just die in prison?

24

his natural life there.

25

Wesley Shafer is going to prison and staying there.

In fact, it's clear that

We ask that he be able to spend
Life in prison until death.

46

1

QUESTION:

But is not the case that the defense

2

attorney asked if he could read the rest of the statute,

3

including, starting with no person sentenced to life in

4

prison is eligible for parole?

5

read that, and he was not allowed to.

6

MR. ZELENKA:

He was not -- he wanted to

That's correct.

He asked that

7

that be read as part of the instruction, and he was not

8

authorized to have that happen.

9

determination that that shouldn't be presented, because --

10
11

QUESTION:

The judge made a

Not the judge, and not defense

counsel?

12

MR. ZELENKA:

13

QUESTION:

That's correct.

I had understood from your colleague

14

that not only was the instruction refused, but the effort

15

of the defense counsel to himself read the statute as part

16

of his closing argument was refused.

17

MR. ZELENKA:

No, I don't recall that occurring

18

within this particular record.

It may have, but my

19

understanding was, what he was seeking to do was to in

20

fact have the judge make that instruction at the time --

21

at the outset of the case, that that language be given.

22

Now, if the judge made that instruction --

23

QUESTION:

24

if that's the case?

25

but advise us subsequently?

Can you check the record and tell us
Not right now, you have no time left,

47

1

MR. ZELENKA:

Yes, I will.

I know that there

2

was an earlier motion in limine made by the prosecution

3

that he not be able to say that there -- the defendant be

4

in prison for the rest of his life.

5

That was removed, based upon the way the

6

instructions ended up coming and, in fact, the defense

7

counsel at page 198 said, when they say give him life,

8

he's not going home, a child spend the rest of his life in

9

prison, send a 19-year-old to prison for the rest of his

10

life, was the argument that he made.

11

We submit that due process in this particular

12

case was satisfied.

There was no false dilemma presented

13

by either the facts or circumstances, or the law as

14

defined in this particular case, and we would request that

15

the conviction and death sentence of Wesley Shafer be

16

affirmed.

Thank you, Mr. Zelenka.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. BRUCK

20

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

21

MR. BRUCK:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Justice

22

O'Connor asked whether the prosecutor or judges had the

23

power to give this instruction whether Simmons is seen to

24

require it or not.

25

In the record of this case that you have here,
48

1

there is an excerpt from a subsequent case tried by the

2

same trial judge, Judge Hayes, State v. Robertson, which

3

was added to this record in the lower court, in which the

4

same argument by the same prosecutors in an adjoining

5

county was made in which Judge Hayes ruled that he would

6

give the instruction and stated, this has bothered me ever

7

since the Shafer case, so until the Shafer decision from

8

the State supreme court, this was an area of considerable

9

discretion and, in fact, most prosecutors didn't make an

10

issue of it and the instruction was very often given.

11

But now, the South Carolina supreme court has

12

made quite clear that except in very rare cases involving

13

a recidivist statute that's almost never invoked, the

14

life-without-parole section of the statute will never be

15

given unless this Court rules otherwise under the Simmons

16

case.

17

The last thing I want to say is that the

18

near-unanimity of the States on this issue really does

19

demonstrate, I think, a paradigmatic example of a due

20

process violation, where the considered judgments of the

21

American people on this claim, as expressed through their

22

courts and legislatures, is already quite, quite clear.

23

Now, I had thought that Simmons was also clear

24

as to what the Due Process Clause required, but clearly in

25

South Carolina it is not clear enough, so I would hope
49

1

that this Court will decide all of the issues that are

2

presented by this record whether the South Carolina

3

supreme court reached them or not.

4

need for another analysis such as went on in the Kelly

5

case.

6

QUESTION:

I think there's no

Mr. Bruck, do you know the answer to

7

the question that was asked about -- I was under the

8

impression that defense counsel had asked to be allowed to

9

say this, or was told he couldn't say it.

10

MR. BRUCK:

Your Honor, I was under that

11

impression, too, and I was just looking through the joint

12

appendix right now.

13

saying that he wanted to read that to the jury, but I

14

can't put my finger on it right now.

15

file a letter with the Clerk giving the citation if, in

16

fact, my recollection is correct.

17

I recall Mr. Banks, defense counsel,

If I may, I will

And for those reasons we hope that the Court

18

will take up all of the issues presented by this case and

19

will reverse the death sentence imposed.
