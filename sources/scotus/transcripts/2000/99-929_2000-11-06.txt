ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. McADAMS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

There are three Democratic principles
First, the people may instruct

Second, the people may request

10

information and receive information on the ballot about

11

candidate behavior.

13

of these activities violate any provision of the United

14

States Constitution.

With regard to the instruct provision first,

Article 8.

The instructional provisions are contained in

The Eighth Circuit said these instructions

Article 5 doesn't say that.

Article 5 provides a specific mechanism by which

25

government to perform.

any specific one of those functions does not exclude the

2

people from the right to communicate to their

3

representatives that they want the Constitution amended.

QUESTION:

Mr. McAdams, precisely what is the

5

instruction provision?

6

three you are talking about?

8

MR. McADAMS:

You say this is the first of the

Yes.

This is the first of the

three principles that I'm talking about, Your Honor.

9

QUESTION:

10

Okay.

MR. McADAMS:

And the instruction is physically

11

contained in Section 17, paragraph one of the proposed

12

amendment, and it relates to Sections 15 and 16 of the

13

amendment, Your Honor, Section 15 stating the intention of

14

the Missouri voters, and Section 16 specifically stating

15

the proposed constitutional amendment that the voters

16

support.

17

QUESTION:

Well, are you arguing to us now on

18

the assumption that the instruction standing alone has no

19

teeth, no enforcement part, and you are going to get to

20

the enforcement part, the teeth part later?

21

MR. McADAMS:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Standing alone, the instructions provisions, these three

23

sections, have no teeth.

Article 5.

QUESTION:

And this is the provision that Judge

Hansen voted to uphold?

MR. McADAMS:

QUESTION:

7

MR. McADAMS:

That is correct.

In doing his dissent?
That is correct, Your Honor.

8

Although I should say, he did not specifically mention

9

Section 17.1.

He only specifically mentioned 15 and 16.

10

The instruction provision of 17.1 would be included in his

11

logic.

QUESTION:

But part 2 of the Missouri

constitutional Article 8, Section 17, is severable, is it?

14

MR. McADAMS:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. McADAMS:

Yes, Your Honor.

The ballot proposition?
Yes, Your Honor.

Pursuant to

17

Section 22 of Article 8, any provision the Court would

18

find unconstitutional in Article 8 is severable from the

19

remainder.

20

QUESTION:

And your point is just that

21

disregarding for the moment the provision that has to

22

appear on the ballot by a candidate's name, that the rest

23

of it doesn't violate Article 5?

24

MR. McADAMS:

25

Moving on to the second principle, Missourians

That would be correct, Your Honor.

I think their argument is that it

of their objection.

That's a kind

How do you respond to that?

MR. McADAMS:

Well, Your Honor, there is nothing

14

that really goes to point three that I made in my opening,

15

that it goes to the specific ballot information and I

respond to that by saying, there is nothing that provides

voters as the basis for a decision to vote against a

MR. McADAMS:

There is something comparable,

Your Honor.

In the State of Nebraska, in the early 1900s

8

as the people became disaffected with Congress'

9

unwillingness to amend the Constitution to provide for the

10

direct election of senators, they placed labels on the

11

ballot about whether state legislative candidates --

QUESTION:

Well, do you have any other example

2

of someone running for federal office, the House or the

3

Senate, where there is such a label?

MR. McADAMS:

I believe there -- not exactly

5

like this label, Your Honor.

6

federal candidates have, for example, their address

7

disclosed.

9

QUESTION:

There are situations where

I think in Arizona, at least at one

time, candidates for the Senate and the House of

10

Representatives had to say they were pledged to recall,

11

which meant that if the state legislature recalled them,

12

they would have to resign.

13

of course, it never happened, so --

14
15
16
17

MR. McADAMS:

Because they all pledged, and

I was not aware of that example,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Excuse me.

And that was shown on the

ballot in Arizona as well?

18

MR. McADAMS:

I'm not aware of that, Your Honor.

19

The rules would seem to provide states, the

20

election clause would seem to provide states an

21

opportunity to place information on the ballot.

22

QUESTION:

Well, doesn't the information, given

23

the courts' cases here anyway, have to be generally

24

applicable and evenhanded, like all the regulation because

seems to me, that if it's not generally applicable and

MR. McADAMS:

There is nothing about providing

information that dictates that it is the basis upon which

14

voters will choose.

15

QUESTION:

Well, of course, that's generally

16

true, and it's for that reason that when we get down to

17

the ballot itself, which normally, regulation of the

18

ballot is not for information providing purposes.

19

for fair vote purposes. And that's why it seems to me that

20

these cases have held when we come down to ballot

have a situation where the state only provides information

about party affiliation.

QUESTION:

Party affiliation is not -- the

that and wants that on the ballot.

QUESTION:

You can argue about whether a party

that this label is just as evenhanded as a party label, or

are you denying the principle?

MR. McADAMS:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.

That's correct, Your Honor.

But the state ballots have lines for

6

the major parties that in the last election got enough

votes, so the reason they show that is they are showing

8

you why you are on the ballot, and if you are on the

ballot for some other reason, you think they could make

somebody who got on the ballot by popular referendum or

QUESTION:

It certainly would change the

5

MR. FRANKLIN:

Certainly, Your Honor.

A

6

decision by this Court that an instruction to a sitting

7

member of Congress to vote in a certain way may be

8

implemented or enforced, we believe would be contrary to

9

the Constitution.

10

It would violate the First Amendment.

It would be a chilling effect on speech.

11

QUESTION:

But what if Missouri had done nothing

12

but pass that part which said we instruct senators and --

13

there is no known prospect of enforcement at all.

14

MR. FRANKLIN:

We would argue in such a case

15

that it would contravene the First Amendment because it

16

would be a chilling effect on speech for the reasons

17

essentially that George Washington stated, which is that

18

the sense, but not the law of the district, may be given.

19

This is unprecedented. We are not aware of any --

Honor.

You don't have to reach that in this

MR. FRANKLIN:

No.

No.

We do not.

And the

17

reason is because the instructions are part and parcel of

18

the law which the Court of Appeals has said stand or falls

19

on its own, and the principal reason that the law as a

20

whole falls is because it does exceed the state's neutral

power to serve as a, an administrator of federal elections

and instead has the state putting its thumb on the

electoral scale.

MR. FRANKLIN:

Yes.

The reason that party

labels would be permissible generally speaking is because

they are integrally related to the conduct, the orderly

conduct of an election which itself is organized around

5

party lines.

6

come to be on the ballot strictly as an individual, but

7

rather as the nominee in most instances of a party.

8

would be a different case if the state, and I understand

9

it to be conceded here, if the state said to an individual

In Missouri, as in elsewhere, one does not

It

10

who had achieved a ballot spot as an independent, that

11

nevertheless, that person must disclose that they are, for

12

example, a member of the communist party or the socialist

13

party.

14

of an election organized around party lines because that

15

would not have anything to do with how the person got on

16

the ballot.

17

That would not be related to the orderly conduct

Second, a party label unlike the labels in this

18

case, a neutral requirement that all party labels be

19

listed is not related to the content of any individual's

20

views on an issue.

21

between parties and viewpoints is imperfect at best, but

22

more important, it's a connotation that the party and the

23

candidate voluntarily associate themselves with in the

24

process of running in an election which itself is

25

organized around party lines.

Here, by contrast, the labels are both content

Mr. McAdams' point was that the First

1

MS. UNDERWOOD:

The word manner, in the context

2

of the Time, Place and Manner clause, means the mechanics,

3

the procedures of an election, neutral, evenhanded

4

regulations that enable the orderly election process to

5

occur, and what it particularly doesn't mean is putting a

6

thumb on the scale to influence the result.

7

QUESTION:

Of course that refers to the

8

legislature, too, and not to this, not to this process,

9

the state legislature?

10

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Yes.

There is a question as you

11

have noted, about whether the time, place and manner

12

authority that the Constitution gives to the state

13

legislatures goes to any entity that the state gives

14

legislative authority to, or whether it actually only goes

15

to legislatures.

16

assuming that it isn't restricted to the legislature as

17

such, it's our position that the power has simply been

18

exceeded, doesn't go, doesn't authorize the making of

nonneutral regulations that are designed to and have the

20

effect of attempting to influence the outcome.

2

label should apply or not, as this regulation does here.

3

The secretary of state, subject to a state review process,

4

has to determine whether the label applies, and the label

5

is a judgmental label, not simply an identifying piece of

6

information.

7

The other thing about parties, of course, is

8

that party labels recognize the role political parties

9

play in the electoral process, provide candidates with a

10

reasonable level of community support, provide voters with

11

a means of exercising their First Amendment right of

12

political association, and the party label therefore

reflects that the party is the mechanism that put the

candidate on, on the ballot.
