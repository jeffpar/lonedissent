CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

5

Displays, Inc.

6

Mr. Roberts.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

The president and founder of Marketing Displays,

12

Incorporated, MDI, invented a new type of sign stand, one

13

with a dual-spring design that allowed the stand to resist

14

the wind.

15

of its patents, MDI labeled its sign stands as patent-

16

protected to warn of copiers, touted in its trade

17

literature the benefit of its, quote, patented dual-

18

spring design, end quote, and when another company,

19

Windproof, tried to market a copy of MDI's patented stand,

20

MDI sued it for patent infringement and won.

21

MDI patented that invention and, for the term

But then MDI's patents expired, as under the

22

Constitution all patents eventually must.

Sometime

23

thereafter, Traffix Devices, the petitioner, copied MDI's

24

stand, added some improvements of its own, and marketed a

25

competing version.

No longer armed with its patents, MDI
3

1

tried a new tack to exclude competition.

2

the configuration of its stand, the same dual-spring

3

design that it had touted as patent-protected during the

4

term of the patents, was protected as trade dress and

5

could not be copied.

6

QUESTION:

It claimed that

Mr. Roberts, how do we determine what

7

the patent covers?

Does it -- I mean, I can look at it,

8

but I'm still not sure.

9

material here, we have a copy.

I think in the record, in the
Does it include in this

10

case the legs and the whole structure, or just the dual

11

spring, and how do we normally determine what the patent

12

covers?

13

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, in this case, of course,

14

it's easy to determine that the patent covers this

15

particular sign stand because MDI labeled that sign stand

16

as patent-protected.

17

QUESTION:

The whole thing?

18

MR. ROBERTS:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. ROBERTS:

The whole sign stand, yes.

Legs, spring, and all?
And all, but in its trade

21

literature, for example, it focused on the dual-spring

22

design.

23

what allows it to resist the wind, and it said, this is

24

our patented dual-spring design and, of course, it not

25

only labeled the stands but in its trade literature, and

That is what makes the invention work. That's

4

1

in the Windproof case it sued when somebody made an exact

2

replica, the same replica that Traffix Devices --

3

QUESTION:

So under your view of the case, if

4

the legs that the patentee had had a very special color,

5

like the John Deere green or something, that could be

6

copied after the patent ran?

7

MR. ROBERTS:

8

QUESTION:

9

Because I notice --

Well --

-- in the pictures the legs were

orange in your client's stand and aluminum in the other.

10

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, incidental ornamentation

11

that is not part of what the patent protects does not give

12

rise to the right to copy.

13

symmetry.

14

the patent bargain, the public has the right to copy.

There should be an exact

Whatever the patent had protected as part of

15

Now, the color of the legs probably would not

16

have been claimed in the patent, and wouldn't have been

17

part of the invention, and therefore it would not give

18

rise to a right to copy that color.

19

QUESTION:

In any event, they're different in

20

this -- if I'm looking at the right diagrams the -- your

21

client has a different -- has the orange color.

22

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, it depends on which stand is

23

involved.

The steel stand is one color and the aluminum

24

stand is another, but in terms of what they claimed in the

25

patent as -- the part that makes the invention work, it's
5

1

not the legs that made this invention.

2

It is the dual-spring design.

3

patented.

4

exclusive right to do so, they focused on that in their

5

trade literature, said this is our patented dual-spring

6

design, and that is the same claim they now raise in their

7

trade dress assertion.

8
9

It's not the sign.

That's what they said was

When they marketed this, when they had the

QUESTION:

But Mr. Roberts, didn't the court of

appeals say, at least as I understood it to say, okay, the

10

dual springs Traffix could have, but you have to devise

11

some kind of other stand, curved legs, or a double stand.

12

I thought that's --

13

MR. ROBERTS:

14

had to design around their stand.

15

could use three springs or four springs, I guess it would

16

never end, five springs, or you could put a little skirt

17

around the springs so people wouldn't see them, or, as

18

Your Honor points out, if you're going to use the springs

19

you have to change something else so it doesn't look like

20

it.

21

It said we -- it said we basically
Now, if they said, you

But that's not what this Court's cases have

22

held.

What the Court has said, Singer and Kellogg and

23

Sears, is that the public has the right to copy the

24

patented invention in precisely the form in which it was

25

practiced, and that's critically important.
6

The idea of

1

designing around what had previously been patented is a

2

significant hindrance to competition, and this case is a

3

good example.

4

When we copied the sign we added an important

5

improvement of our own, the step-and-drop leg.

Under

6

MDI's stand you have to bend over and pull the pins out.

7

Under ours, you just step and the legs come out.

8

Now, if the rule were the rule that the

9

respondents are arguing for, we would have had to add that

10

new improvement to some different sign stand, but the

11

right to copy attaches to the product as it was practiced

12

during the term of the patent.

13

around their superior stand -- that's why it succeeded in

14

getting the patent -- to add improvements of our own.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

We don't have to design

Does it depend in part on how we

define functionality under the trade dress inquiry?
MR. ROBERTS:

We think there is a freestanding

18

right to copy from an expired patent, that it doesn't

19

depend upon what functionality is.

20

QUESTION:

And you think that there can never be

21

a trade dress protection in some aspect of an expired

22

patented item?

23

MR. ROBERTS:

If the item was simply incidental

24

ornamentation -- one of their amici used the example, if

25

you're patenting a chair and the drawing shows a purple
7

1

bow.

2

purple bow, because the purple bow is not covered.

3

not the invention.

4

Well, we don't think there's a right to copy the

QUESTION:

So there could be a trade dress in an

5

expired patented item.

6

MR. ROBERTS:

In the item itself, yes, but not

7

in the subject of the patent.

8

QUESTION:

9
10

That's

And I suppose that depends on how we

define functionality, in a sense.
MR. ROBERTS:

Functionality I think leads to the

11

same place that we come to from looking at patent law, if

12

you define functionality as it has traditionally been

13

defined, as turning on usefulness.

14

If functional -- if functional means useful,

15

then our case comes out the same way, because you have to

16

be useful to get a patent, and if it's been the subject of

17

a patent, the feature has been useful, therefore it's

18

functional, therefore it's not eligible for trade dress

19

protection.

20

QUESTION:

Justice O'Connor's question suggests

21

this to me.

You're arguing for the rule that you maintain

22

here so that you will not have to litigate functionality.

23

MR. ROBERTS:

24

QUESTION:

25

Exactly, and functionality --

But why isn't functionality

sufficient protection, particularly in this case?
8

1

MR. ROBERTS:

Functionality is sufficient if

2

functionality means useful, but if functionality means, as

3

the lower court said in this case, something for which

4

there is a competitive need, or for which there are not

5

available alternatives, and there's a multi-factor

6

balancing test to determine so-called legal

7

functionality --

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, I guess the court, the Sixth

Circuit pulled that out of Qualitex' opinion.

10

MR. ROBERTS:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, we --

The competitive need.
I don't think Qualitex opined on

13

the exact definition of functionality in this case, or it

14

was misread by the lower court.

15

Qualitex had a very important connector there.

16

useful product feature, or, and then it went on to talk

17

about competitive need, so --

18

QUESTION:

19
20

The definition in
It said, a

So as far as you're concerned, if

it's useful, then it's functional?
MR. ROBERTS:

Period, without regard to

21

competitive need, available alternatives -- MDI's position

22

is, look, you can make a sign that stands up to the wind

23

that's just as good as our sign stand, so don't make it

24

the way we made it, but the patent, the expired patent

25

gives us the right to copy -9

1

QUESTION:

Well, it gives you -- this -- I think

2

my question is related to Justice O'Connor's, and this is

3

a problem that I have in understanding, and maybe you can

4

help me.

5

follow that you have a right to copy the configuration

6

that that invention took in the hands of the patent

7

holder?

8
9

You have a right to copy the invention.

MR. ROBERTS:

Does it

in Kellogg answers that.

I think Justice Brandeis' opinion
Kellogg did not have to show

10

that there was no way to make or sell shredded wheat other

11

than in the pillow-shaped biscuit form that Nabisco had

12

made famous when it had its patent.

13

that was the form in which Nabisco had practiced its

14

patent.

15

could have made shredded wheat some other way, and that's

16

important precisely because of the purpose of the patent

17

bargain to promote competition.

18

It was enough that

Kellogg therefore could copy it, even though they

As I said, why -- if we have an improvement to

19

this sign stand, the step-and-drop legs, why should we

20

have to add it only to a very different sign stand?

21

the commercially proven version that the public has the

22

right to copy.

23

To require people, if they're going to make improvements,

24

to design around the form that the public had become

25

accustomed to, would inhibit competition, and --

It's

That is important to enhance competition.

10

1

QUESTION:

If we were dealing, Mr. Roberts, with

2

just the patent law, that would be one thing and, as I

3

understand it, although it's confusing, the word useful is

4

a patent term of art and functionality is a trade dress

5

term of art, but you're trying now to equate these two

6

terms in answer to questions that you've had as one and

7

the same, but they have different purposes, as I

8

understand it, in the patent law, the idea of useful,

9

trade dress, the idea of functionality.

10

You recite the old cases like Kellogg.

It's

11

been argued that on the trade dress side the law has

12

evolved since those old cases, and it's now, trade dress

13

gets more protection.

14

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

You're dealing with what is

15

in the trade dress area essentially judge-made law, and it

16

has expanded in various ways, and functionality -- it

17

doesn't interfere with the patent bargain if functionality

18

means a broad range of other things, but so long as it is

19

also satisfied completely by a demonstration that it is a

20

useful product feature.

21

There may be other limitations on a trade dress

22

claim going to competitive need, available alternatives,

23

any of the various multi-factor tests, but if

24

functionality is going to serve the purpose of demarking

25

the regime of trademark and trade dress and patent law, it
11

1

must be satisfied by a showing that it is a useful product

2

feature and in our case that's significant, because you

3

can't get a utility patent as MDI had, without showing

4

that it's a useful product feature, so the fact that they

5

had a utility patent, that it covered the dual-spring

6

design, should be enough to establish functionality and

7

therefore should be enough to reject their trade dress

8

claim.

9

QUESTION:

Do you agree that at least one basis

10

on which we could decide this case would simply be on the

11

basis of how expensive a concept of configuration trade

12

dress we want, because if we take your position,

13

configuration trade dress is going to be, at least in

14

formally patented matters, a pretty narrow concept, and if

15

we're going to have coherence within the concept of

16

configuration trade dress, we're going to have to make it

17

equally narrow.

18

I mean, we can't have different functionality

19

tests, I presume, and if on the other hand we find good

20

reason to think configuration trade dress is desirable,

21

then we're going to go the other way with a different

22

concept of functionality, I suppose.

23

MR. ROBERTS:

I think it is the expansion of the

24

concept of configuration trade dress that has given rise

25

to this issue and the problem.
12

If you go back to where

1

trademark was limited to marks on the product, of course,

2

the product could be patented, the trademark is fine.

3

you even then go the next step, and you're talking about

4

trade dress and packaging, again, so long as it's distinct

5

from the product, there's no interference with patent.

6

If

But when you start saying that the configuration

7

of the product itself is entitled to protection as trade

8

dress, you bump right into the patent law, because the key

9

to the patent bargain is, if you're going to control a

10

useful product feature, as the Court said in Qualitex,

11

that's the regime of patent law, and it's no answer to

12

say, well, we're protected by patent law and when the

13

patent expires we're protected under trade dress law,

14

because that takes away the public's half of the patent

15

bargain.

16

a term of years on the condition that he or she disclose

17

what the invention is, and that the public obtains a right

18

to copy it when the patent expires.

19

We're giving exclusive right to an inventor for

So yes, I mean, it is the expansion of product

20

configuration trade dress that has given rise to this

21

problem, and I would at least suggest that the Court

22

should not get on board with that expansion without

23

waiting for Congress to say something about it,

24

particularly given the fact that it so directly impinges

25

upon the central patent bargain underlying the patent
13

1

system.

2

QUESTION:

Of course, Mr. Roberts, you rely

3

heavily on the patent in this case, and that's the

4

question presented.

5

question.

6

been no patent issued in this case, no patent application,

that this was nevertheless functional?

You've presented only that narrow

But I take it you would argue even if there had

MR. ROBERTS:

9

QUESTION:

Certainly, yes, and --

The fact of the patent really is just

10

evidentiary support for the ultimate conclusion that this

11

is a functional feature.

12

MR. ROBERTS:

13

important distinction.

14

covered by the patent, another producer knows that when it

15

comes off patent he can copy it, and that's how it worked

16

in this case.

18

make it, it comes off patent, they can make it.

19

Well, it gives rise to an

It depends on consumer surveys.
14

By that time

1

the producer says, forget it, it's not worth the candle,

2

I'll go make something else, and competition suffers.

3

QUESTION:

The difficulty, I guess is, would you

4

make the test absolute, because if you make it absolute,

5

you know, you're going to get into huge litigation about

6

whether this thing in the patent was or it was not an

7

essential element, and then somebody will say, oh yeah, I

8

guess I did include it as one of the specifications in the

9

patent, but it really wasn't that important.

10

I mean, should you make it absolute never, or

11

should you allow somebody to defend on the ground that,

12

look, it wasn't that crucial to the patent, and

13

everybody's come to identify it, and please let me make an

14

exception here, and then they give some fabulous reasons.

15

Should it be absolute, or leave them a little bit of a

16

loophole?

17

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, you know, a little bit of a

18

loophole suddenly expands, particularly when you have a

19

multi --

20

QUESTION:

But it goes both ways, because if you

21

allow no loophole you're going to get the same kind of

22

arguments about whether it was or was not an essential

23

part of a patent.

24
25

MR. ROBERTS:
easy.

Well, of course, in this case it's

The key to the invention -15

1

QUESTION:

In this case it may be easy, but the

2

question is, what about the rule?

3

MR. ROBERTS:

-- and producers all the time

4

compete all the time in the confines of patents.

They

5

have to look at a patent and decide, can I make a

6

competing product or not, so it's not a new inquiry, and

7

in the typical case such as this, where you have a product

8

coming off patent, you will have the conduct of the

9

patentee, which will illuminate exactly what he thought

10

was covered.

Here, we not only have the labeling and the

11

trade literature, we have the Windproof litigation.

12

Someone made the exact same sign here and he said, a-ha,

13

that infringes my patent.

14

patent, and the Ninth Circuit concluded it did, then the

15

public has a right to copy.

Well, if it did infringe his

16

I'd like to reserve --

17

QUESTION:

Wasn't the exact same sign -- I

18

thought one of the points that was made was that in the

19

patent infringement case, that sign didn't look as much

20

like the Market Display signs --

21

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

The patent displays what

22

they call a business sign, with two springs far apart.

23

The Traffix sign, the one at issue in Windproof and at

24

issue here, the springs are closely together.

25

MDI argued successfully that made no difference,
16

1

that the two closely spaced springs were covered by the

2

patent to the same extent as the farther apart springs.

3

Thank you, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

5

Very well, Mr. Roberts.

Mr. Wallace,

we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

8

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Our brief is built on the premise that the

12

functionality doctrine, the traditional functionality

13

doctrine of trademark law is what makes trademark

14

protection of trade dress and other symbolic elements

15

consistent with this Court's patent law jurisprudence, as

16

synthesized and reaffirmed as recently as the Bonito Boats

17

case, but I think part of the reason the two laws

18

harmonize is because the use of functionality doctrine is

19

to limit the scope of protection of the device.

20

Its traditional function was to bar the holder

21

of a patent or other utilitarian device, even if

22

nonpatented, from withdrawing that device from the public

23

domain when there's no longer the protection of the patent

24

as trade -- withdrawing it from the public domain as trade

25

dress because people have a right to practice and use as
17

1

the building blocks for further innovation whatever

2

devices are in the public domain that are utilitarian in

3

nature, including their overall configuration, but there

4

is still protection against confusing similarity through

5

requirements of labeling, packaging, avoiding palming off

6

and other misrepresentations.

7

Functionality really goes to the scope of

8

protection, and limits the scope of protection available

9

under trademark law by preventing someone from

10

monopolizing and withdrawing from the public domain

11

utilitarian features or the entire utilitarian device in

12

the absence of valid patent protection.

13

domain of patent law, and one must qualify for a patent

14

and have a valid patent in order to have a legal monopoly

15

that withdraws, that prevents others from using the

16

device, but there -- as I say, these other protections are

17

still available as well as the ability to exclude

18

ornamental or incidental features.

19

harmonizes the two statutory schemes.

20

That is the

That is what to us

The traditional understanding of functionality

21

was not an artificial concept.

It was the ordinary

22

meaning of the word.

23

is what is functional.

24

quotation we have in a footnote on page 17 of our brief by

25

Representative Lanham himself, when someone raised

What enables the device to function
That was reflected in a very terse

18

1

concerns about whether the trademark law might result in

2

compromising of the public's right to use useful

3

inventions, and he said --

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, may I ask if you would

5

answer the question that Justice Stevens posed to Mr.

6

Roberts in the same way?

7

now giving us as functional sounds like you would come out

8

the same way on this alleged trade dress infringement,

9

even if there had never been any patent in the picture,

That is, the definition you're

10

because this sign, all the ingredients are functional.

11

There's no purple bow on it.

12

MR. WALLACE:

That is absolutely correct.

We

13

would come out the same way as we were -- I think this

14

Court's decision in Bonito Boats is an example of that,

15

because there was no patent shown in the record, as the

16

court noted, of the boat hull that they said could not be

17

copied.

18

QUESTION:

So your position is the utilitarian

feature of the patent is a conclusive presumption in a

20

trade dress suit where functionality would otherwise be at

issue?

22

MR. WALLACE:

With regard to the scope of

23

protection, that others cannot be excluded from using

24

something utilitarian.

25

As we compressed our brief down to our allotted
19

1

30 pages we carefully preserved a quotation on page 11

2

that you can see at the top of the page from the 1917, or

3

1911, excuse me, Seventh Circuit decision because it

4

states the common sense of it.

5

features that didn't even meet the standard for getting a

6

patent, they should not be given a perpetual monopoly in

7

contrast to what was then the 17-year monopoly that you

8

could get if you met the criteria for patentability.

9

If you have utilitarian

The other protections available against

10

confusing similarity make the need for a right to exclude

11

imitation of trade dress relatively unimportant compared

12

to the policies this Court has reiterated at least since

13

1896 in the Singer case about the need for utilitarian

14

features to be used as building blocks and to be in the

15

public domain except for the limited period of time in

16

which they are protected by a valid and unexpired patent,

17

and we understand this Court's decision in Qualitex to

18

mean much the same thing.

19

The difficulty has arisen because an alternative

20

test of functionality has also become appropriate as the

21

scope of trademark protection has extended to matters that

22

don't have utilitarian features to them.

23

particularly to the protection of color as an example,

24

where there is relevance to looking at competitive need

25

in -- we give an example in our brief of an orange-colored
20

We point

1

can of soda.

2

There were other amicus submissions in the

3

Qualitex case in which people were making claims that

4

raised issues that went quite beyond what was involved in

5

the press pad that was at issue in Qualitex.

6

for example, involved orange-colored sprinkler system

7

piping.

8

result would necessarily be different, but one would have

9

to examine whether a competitor who wanted to compete for

Well, it raised other questions.

One of them,

I don't say the

10

replacing a portion of the piping would be disadvantaged

11

if he couldn't match the color of it.

12

It was a different case from the Federal

13

Circuit's Corning, Owens-Corning case involving the pink-

14

colored insulation, because that goes behind the wall and

15

people don't see it.

16

connotes danger, and perhaps there is marketing

17

significance to that.

The orange coloring in some contexts

18

But the mistake that I think some of the courts

19

of appeals have made, including the Sixth Circuit in this

20

case, is to say that that is now the exclusive approach,

21

and you wind up with multi-factored tests that don't

22

really give an adequate guidance to what the law is.

23

A very good example is found on page 17 of the

24

light green amicus brief filed by the International

25

Trademark Association in this case, in which they speak
21

1

approvingly of various multi-factored tests that the

2

courts of appeals have adopted in this area, which leaves

3

open what this Court in its salutary opinion in Wal-Mart

4

v. Samara Brothers referred to as the plausible threat of

5

litigation which can discourage competitors and become an

6

impediment to the benefits that consumers would get from

7

competition, and to have tests of this kind applied to

8

displace the traditional approach to functionality would

9

be very detrimental to competitors for the very reasons

10

the Court has recognized in the cases synthesized in the

11

Bonito Boats opinion.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, I'm not sure what your

13

proposal is, that we use the simple test for what, for

14

useful features --

15

MR. WALLACE:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

That --

-- whether or not they are patented,

and the more complex test for -- for what?
MR. WALLACE:

Both -- either test can show that

19

something is functional, whichever one suits the needs of

20

the particular factual situation.

21

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Wallace.

22

Mr. Artz, we'll hear from you.

23

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. ARTZ

24

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

25

MR. ARTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
22

1

the Court:

2

This Court granted certiorari due to a conflict

3

between regional courts of appeals on one issue, and that

4

is whether or not the visual image and appearance of a

5

product -- with a product whose operation and performance

6

was covered by a utility patent, can still be protected as

7

trade dress under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act.

8

imposition of any per se rule, whether the Government's

9

rule or Traffix rule, which says it cannot be protected in

10
11

The

my opinion is unnecessary, unjustified, and unworkable.
It's unnecessary because there are already

12

adequate rules in place, the trade dress rules and

13

functionality that have been referred to already.

14

unjustified because it would cause harm to the public's

15

right not to be confused or deceived.

16

in trade dress and trademark cases under the Lanham Act.

17

That's a touchstone of the Lanham Act.

18

QUESTION:

It's

Those are paramount

It would also --

It's a touchstone of patent law that

19

an expired patent can be copied, so we really do have to

20

make the two doctrines mesh well.

21

MR. ARTZ:

Yes.

22

QUESTION:

And the concern we have is with this

23

expanded competitive need test that some of the lower

24

courts have begun employing, and I am quite interested to

25

know how you think the two doctrines can fit neatly
23

1

together, because in an ideal world a trade dress could

2

not cover something that was covered by a patent that's

3

now expired.

4

MR. ARTZ:

Well, Justice O'Connor, the mediating

5

factor between the two is the functionality test, in my

6

opinion.

7

got the trademark laws and the Lanham Act, two federal

8

laws --

9

There's -- you've got the patent laws, you've

QUESTION:

And it's possible that some of the

10

courts have lowered the bar too much on the functionality

11

inquiry.

12

I mean, I think that's what we need to look at.
MR. ARTZ:

Well, in the Qualitex case, the

13

Qualitex gave a specific definition of functionality, and

14

remember now, in 1998-1999, Congress made some amendments

15

to the trademark act, or Lanham Act, and in this they

16

specifically mentioned functionality several times.

17

They added it to the fact that you can't have

18

functional trademarks -- you can't have trademark that's

19

functional but if it's nonfunctional you can, and they

20

knew about the Vornado case at that time because it was

21

decided in 1995, and that's the Tenth Circuit, and there's

22

a lot of flurry of activity in the intellectual property

23

bar because of that, so all that was before Congress when

24

it amended it, and Congress did not go to any per se test

25

at that time, and so you've got two Federal laws here, and
24

1

under the Morton case and the Ruckelshaus case which are

2

cited.

3
4
5

QUESTION:

Is there evidence, Mr. Artz, that

Congress affirmatively approved the Tenth Circuit case?
MR. ARTZ:

No, they did not.

I mean, because

6

they -- what they -- they actually -- the legislative

7

history mentions the fact that their patent expiration,

8

and people might be trying to get trademark protection

9

after the expiration of the patent, and then they go on to

10
11

add functionality.
QUESTION:

Well, I -- you -- I thought part of

12

your argument was that the Tenth Circuit had decided this

13

case in 1995 and it was quote, before, close quote,

14

Congress at the time it made the amendments.

15

purport of that?

16

MR. ARTZ:

What is the

Well, what I'm saying is, in 1995

17

that Vornado case was there, and in 1998 Congress amended

18

the trademark act.

19

that I can see that actually mentioned the Vornado case.

20

I'm saying that it probably --

21

QUESTION:

22

Now, there's no legislative history

But you're not -- you're arguing, I

hope, something more than post hoc ergo propter hoc.

23

MR. ARTZ:

Yes.

24

QUESTION:

Would you go back to Justice

25

Yes, I am, Your Honor.

O'Connor, which I thought was the key question, and I
25

1

didn't --

2

MR. ARTZ:

Yes.

3

QUESTION:

-- hear the answer.

I mean, I know

4

Qualitex.

5

that's your job, but I'm pretty surprised at the Tenth

6

Circuit, the court, which -- I learned you read the whole

7

case, what the context is not just a sentence taken out of

8

context, so I obviously thought that Qualitex was about a

9

doctrine called aesthetic functionality.

10

I'm surprised not at your reading, because

I thought, on page 165 where the court quotes

11

the tradition, what's in quotes, the definition, a product

12

feature is functional if it is essential to the use or

13

purpose of this article, all in quotes, or if it affects

14

the cost or quality of the article, okay, end of the

15

matter.

16

relevant to aesthetic functionality, that is, if exclusive

17

use of the feature would put competitors at a significant

18

nonreputational disadvantage.

19

relevant to what happens to be the subject of this case,

20

called aesthetic functionality.

Now it adds, because that's what happens to be

That last clause is

21

MR. ARTZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

22

QUESTION:

Two pages later, in case that wasn't

23

clear, the case quotes Restatement Third about aesthetic

24

functionality and says, in respect to aesthetic

25

functionality, i.e., color, quote, the ultimate test is
26

1

whether the recognition of trademark rights would

2

significantly hinder competition, all right.

3

MR. ARTZ:

Yes.

4

QUESTION:

But nothing in the case --

5

MR. ARTZ:

No.

6

QUESTION:

-- purports to change any earlier

7

test in respect to anything else --

8

MR. ARTZ:

Well, that's --

9

QUESTION:

-- or even change anything there, so

10

as I read the case that seemed to be its reading, which

11

would say in this case, which isn't about aesthetic

12

functionality, we apply what is the traditional test.

13

MR. ARTZ:

Well, every case which has actually

14

looked at functionality actually has come up with the

15

result that the Sixth Circuit did, the Seventh Circuit

16

did --

17

QUESTION:

Maybe, but I thought the place you

18

look for a test is in the Supreme Court opinions, and in

19

the Supreme Court opinions, Qualitex quotes the

20

traditional test.

It didn't make it up.

21

MR. ARTZ:

That's correct.

22

QUESTION:

It said, in general terms a product

23

feature is functional if it is essential to the use or

24

purpose of this article, or it affects the cost or quality

25

of the article.

That's all in quotes.
27

The rest is

1

explanation as applied here.

2
3

So if we take that as the test, why isn't that
the test?

4

MR. ARTZ:

Well, the Supreme Court goes on in

5

the Qualitex case and says, that is -- that is, if

6

exclusive use of the feature would put competitors at a

7

significant nonreputational related disadvantage.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, that was my question.

My

question was as to that add-on, doesn't that have to do

10

with an explanation of the test as relevant to the issue

11

before the Court in Qualitex --

12

MR. ARTZ:

I think that --

13

QUESTION:

-- namely, aesthetic functionality,

14

which is an aspect of quality I think people could argue

15

about.

16
17
18
19

MR. ARTZ:

I think that is the test, Your Honor,

whether or not -QUESTION:

The test in the case of aesthetic

functionality?

20

MR. ARTZ:

Yes.

21

QUESTION:

Fine.

22

Is this a case of aesthetic

functionality?

23

MR. ARTZ:

I believe it is, yes.

24

QUESTION:

Aesthetic?

25

MR. ARTZ:

It involves how things look, the
28

It involves color?

1
2
3

appearance, visual -QUESTION:

Everything in design involves how

things look.

4

MR. ARTZ:

Okay.

5

QUESTION:

I mean, that's --

6

MR. ARTZ:

Well, it's aesthetic in that sense,

7

but it's not -- it doesn't involve color, no, it does not.

8

It's not like the color that was allowed in the Qualitex

9

case, but I think that is the test.

10

QUESTION:

It involves size and shape, and this

11

discussion about Qualitex and aesthetic functionality

12

doesn't get into what effect the patents, if any, has on

13

functionality, and in your view does the patent -- your

14

having had a patent, building up goodwill, free, over 20

15

years, nobody can compete with that, so if you've got

16

secondary meaning it's because you have been able to keep

17

everybody off.

18

We've been dealing with cases in your discussion

19

where there was no patent in the picture.

20

fact that there was a patent bear on the inquiry that was

21

made in cases where there was no patent?

22

MR. ARTZ:

How should the

Justice Ginsburg, I think that the

23

case, Midwest case by the Federal Circuit, the Thomas &

24

Betts case of the Seventh Circuit, our case, Sixth

25

Circuit, and the Sunbeam case, Fifth Circuit, all apply
29

1

the proper test.

2

intellectual property laws, or IP laws, as I call them,

3

you've got five different basically Federal laws on

4

intellectual property, patents, copyrights, trademarks,

5

trade dress, unfair competition.

6

distinct.

7

There are different forms of

They're all separate and

The fact that you have a patent on something,

8

that is different than whether or not you can have a trade

9

dress on something.

Patent would be relevant in the sense

10

that under this commercial necessity test, if there's only

11

one way to make that product, that was look and

12

experience, then it's functional, and so in that sense the

13

functionality test would apply and the patent, if it says

14

something about the functionality, that would be relevant

15

to the functionality test in the trade dress area, but

16

they're separate and distinct, and they always have.

17

Design patents, for example --

18

QUESTION:

They may be separate and distinct,

19

but they bear upon one another, and there seems to be

20

something horribly unfair about allowing someone who has

21

acquired a secondary meaning in the trade dress only

22

because of the patent -- let's say the shape of a Coca-

23

Cola bottle.

24
25

I mean, you know, if that wasn't patented,
somebody else could have come out with the same shape
30

1

bottle as soon as it -- you know, as soon as the first

2

ones came off the line they could say, gee, that's a nice-

3

looking bottle, and they could have copied it, but you

4

couldn't copy it because it was patented, and therefore,

5

by reason of the patent, for 17 years Coca-Cola acquires a

6

secondary meaning.

7

it's Coca-Cola.

8
9

Anyone who sees that bottle would say,

Then, when the patent expires, Coca-Cola in
effect extends the patent by parlaying what was the design

10

patent into what is now trade dress protection, because

11

they say, well, gee, everybody knows that that's a Coca-

12

Cola bottle, but the only reason they know is because

13

you've been given a monopoly for 17 years, and it doesn't

14

seem right to enable you to extend that monopoly

15

indefinitely.

16

meaning was because of the patent.

17

companies that get secondary meanings without a patent.

18

Doesn't there seem any incompatibility with the patent law

19

to you?

20
21
22

The only reason you acquired the secondary

MR. ARTZ:
Your Honor.

That's unlike other

No, I don't think it's unfair at all,

I think they're separate and distinct.

I agree that perhaps, if you have this 17-year

23

monopoly on this patent, that might help you on the trade

24

dress area with respect to secondary meaning, but then, of

25

course, just as we found here, the functionality test, the
31

1

fact that you had a patent on it actually hurts you.

2

might be a wash between those two.

3

It

The trade dress has three separate and distinct

4

tests.

You have to show it's distinctive -- in other

5

words, it has secondary meaning -- and the public

6

recognizes it as something which comes from a certain

7

source.

8

nonfunctional.

which specifically says you have that burden of proof if

It's a source identifier.

You have to show it's

However, trademark law has been amended,

10

it's unregistered.

11

Under the Qualitex case in my opinion you have to show

12

whether it's competitive necessity, then you've got to

13

show whether there's a likelihood of confusion.

14

You have to show it's nonfunctional.

You may have a product that looks exactly the

15

same as yours, but if you can't show there's a likelihood

16

of confusion, you don't win.

tests in the trade dress area.

There's a problem --

QUESTION:

Well, it's the second that we're

arguing about, I think.

I think it's the second, when you

You only give patents to things that are functional.
MR. ARTZ:

I think functionality, Your Honor,

legal functionality is really a misnomer, like I believe
32

1

in the Wal-Mart case the secondary meaning was looked at

2

as being a misnomer.

3

acquired meaning afterwards.

is a misnomer.

It was really acquired meaning,

QUESTION:

Aesthetic functionality isn't

conceivably in this case.

They're the ones that argue

13

functionality, not you.

14

the product is functional.

15

functionality of your product arises from the way it

looks.

17

that the boat's black.

They're the ones that say that
They're not saying that the

18

They're saying that the functionality of the

19

product is that the springs prevent it from twisting in

20

the wind.

21

functionality, and I don't see how you could even closely

22

claim that it is.

23

Now, that isn't a claim of aesthetic

MR. ARTZ:

Well, I think the functionality test

24

that's been developed in Qualitex applies to any type of

25

trade dress -33

1

QUESTION:

Ah, wait.

I thought what you said

2

is, you agreed with me before that Qualitex is talking

3

about aesthetic functionality, that we apply the normal

4

test without that little add-on, but we apply Restatement

5

Three, the aesthetic functionality test, which is the add-

6

on, where they make the claim that the reason this product

7

is functional is because of the way it looks, i.e., the

8

pipes are painted orange as a warning, which is not their

9

claim in this case.

10

Am I -- now, where am I wrong in that?

11

MR. ARTZ:

I think the test that's set forth in

12

Qualitex that Your Honor says is for just aesthetic

13

functionality applies in every functionality test.

14

think that's the difference.

15

QUESTION:

I

So then the pages written at 169 and

16

170, and trying to explain just what we're driving at are

17

sort of beside the point.

18

MR. ARTZ:

Yes.

It says in general terms a

19

product feature is functional and cannot serve if, and

20

then you say it's essential to use or purpose.

21

that's broad and ambiguous.

22

purpose, and then you say, if it affects the cost or

23

quality.

24

quality, so it seems to me the only objective test you

25

have here, because it relates to competitors and

I mean,

Everything has a use or

Virtually everything affects the cost or

34

1

consumers, is whether or not it puts competitors at a

2

significant disadvantage in the marketplace.

3

QUESTION:

Can we apply that test, because I'm

4

having a little trouble connecting to the real world and

5

the device before us and these multi-factor tests and even

6

what you've just been saying.

7

Tell me what it is in your formerly patented

8

device that Traffix can copy now that the patent has

9

expired.

10

Can it make a sign with those two coil springs

adjacent to each other?

11

MR. ARTZ:

Yes, it can, Your Honor.

12

QUESTION:

If you could describe to me what it

13

can copy and what it must change I would have a more

14

secure handle on what your case is.

15

MR. ARTZ:

Our trade dress, Your Honor, it's

16

really a combination of five features.

17

shaped legs, a narrow base, a pair of upright vertical

18

coil springs, an upright attached to that, as well as this

19

diamond-shaped sign above it, and I have a model of it

20

that actually shows what it is here.

21

record before the court of appeals.

22

It's got your X-

This is in the

Now, they could change any one of those.

They

23

could keep the coil springs if they change some other

24

configuration to make it look different, to give it a

25

visual -- different visual appearance.
35

Like, right now,

1

even the vice president and their technical expert say

2

that when they see a sign like this one driving along the

3

road, they know it comes from Marketing Displays.

4

know it's a Windmaster.

5

QUESTION:

They

But there aren't that many things to

6

adjust.

I mean, one of the things about Qualitex and the

7

green/gold you could have tan/silver, any number of

8

combinations that would serve that purpose, but for that

9

road sign that's not going to blow in the wind you have to

10

have those springs, and you have to have some kind of

11

base, and there aren't that many variations.

12

QUESTION:

And the law requires the shape of the

13

sign.

I mean, in many States that shape of a sign

14

indicates a certain type of warning, so what's left?

15

There's nothing left but the legs, and --

16

MR. ARTZ:

You have --

17

QUESTION:

And your friend over there says that

18

they changed the legs.

They did change the legs.

19

MR. ARTZ:

Now --

20

QUESTION:

Somebody who sees their legs say,

21

gee, it has the -- what do you call them -- step-down

22

legs, or whatever it is, so the one thing it seemed to me

23

that they could have changed, they did change.

24
25

MR. ARTZ:

No, they kept the same visual

appearance and image, Your Honor.
36

1

This was what the patent covered with a product

2

such as this.

3

this, with a wide base, a pair of springs way apart, they

4

could have gone to straight legs like this, they could

5

have gone to an upright like this, rather than this, and

6

attached the sign to it.

7

They could have gone to something like

This is what the patent covered.

This is what

8

was shown in the patent.

This is only found to infringe,

9

under the doctrine of equivalents, which took several

10

years and several thousands of dollars for MDI to prove

11

it, and that's the problem with a per se test.

12
13

QUESTION:

Because that one in your right hand

probably works better.

14

MR. ARTZ:

15

(Laughter.)

16

QUESTION:

17
18

I think so.

Yes, and that's why they wanted to

copy it, and not something that worked less well.
MR. ARTZ:

Well, the thing here is a competitive

19

necessity test.

I think it's important, because there are

20

really, like, eight competitors in this marketplace, MDI,

21

Traffix, and six others.

22

stands which looked different.

23

mechanisms in particular.

24

horizontal spring, there's a torsion spring, and so

25

Traffix said, I had to copy MDI's, yet all the other

Six others all came up with sign
They have different spring

There's flat springs,

37

1

competitors made their own design.

2

stands which look different.

3

appearance.

4

there, MDI's, six others, and then Traffix'.

5

They came up with sign

They have different visual

So there are seven types of sign stands out

QUESTION:

You know, I have to confess that

6

I'm -- I find it a little difficult to imagine that most

7

motorists are looking at what -- the legs of the sign

8

instead of the message on the sign.

9

(Laughter.)

10

QUESTION:

I find it hard to believe that people

11

really identify with two legs or three.

12

slightest idea how many legs there were on most of the

13

signs I've looked at when I was driving along.

14
15

QUESTION:

I don't have the

I've been looking in the last week.

It's very interesting.

16

(Laughter.)

17

QUESTION:

18

motorists.

19

departments.

I gather you don't care about the

You just care about the highway purchasing

20

MR. ARTZ:

That's it, yes.

21

QUESTION:

Right?

22

MR. ARTZ:

It does -- confusion as to the

23

purchaser, who the relevant purchasers --

24
25

QUESTION:
motorists.

You couldn't care less about the

You just want to sell the signs.
38

1

(Laughter.)

2

QUESTION:

Could I ask you a question about the

3

patent part?

4

and will you assume for purpose of this that Qualitex is

5

about color, which is a matter that doesn't easily fit

6

within the terms, you know, purpose, use, cost or quality,

7

and suppose here we're dealing with something that does

8

easily fit within those terms, all right, so keep Qualitex

9

out of it.

10

I'd like to ask you about the patent part,

Now, assuming that that's so, what would be

11

wrong -- and they come in and they say, look, these

12

springs are part of the function.

13

function.

14

this way.

15

They're part of the

They're essential to the use, these springs, in

Now, should there be an absolute presumption

16

that if you one day said -- I'm not saying what you did

17

say, but we'll assume this.

18

patent application, I have a great idea here, and my idea

19

is to have two springs just like this, and then later on,

20

when it's expired, they say, that was the heart of it.

21

was useful.

22

the patent be the end of the matter, nobody ever looks

23

further?

24
25

If you one day said in the

It

Should the fact that you said that one day in

There is a -- what the Government said here is
where as an expired utility patent discloses that the
39

1

feature alleges trade dress contributes to the operation

2

of the formerly patented device, the feature must be

3

considered function.

4

suggestion.

Now, that's the Government's

5

MR. ARTZ:

Okay.

6

QUESTION:

All right.

Now, you can of course

7

argue that wasn't essential, et cetera, but my problem's a

8

general one, leaving this case out of it.

9

the test?

Should that be

10

MR. ARTZ:

No, it should not be the test.

11

QUESTION:

Because?

12

MR. ARTZ:

Because I think what you say in the

13

patent could be relevant, and the patent obviously is

14

going to be put into every trade dress case, and that is

15

one of the reasons I think that trade dress tests, that

16

their absolute test is unworkable, because in every

17

trademark case now what you're going to have is, a

18

defendant's going to run out and scour the 5 million

19

expired patents, find one which has a claim which may read

20

on this trade dress, accused trade dress and say, a-ha,

21

it's dedicated to the public on this other, somebody

22

else's patent.

23

See, one of the things that --

24

QUESTION:

25

It would seem to me that would be,

even under your rule, a -- well, maybe not under your, but
40

1

under the Government's rule, quite an appropriate thing to

2

do, to show that there is functionality that the patent

3

office has recognized.

4

MR. ARTZ:

Well, again I don't want you to

5

confuse legal functionality with something that's useful

6

in purpose, because legal functionality is different.

7

It's a legal test.

8

believe, or it means what is competitive necessity to use

9

it, and just now, recently, in the 1998-1999, Congress

It means, as in the Qualitex case, I

10

made amendments to the Lanham Act and it did not go for an

11

absolute test.

12

purpose.

13

burden of proof of functionality is going to be on the

14

party saying it's nonfunctional.

It did not go for a test for use or

What it did, it just said, if it's -- you know,

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Artz --

16

MR. ARTZ:

Yes.

17

QUESTION:

-- I hadn't realized it, you are not

18

complaining about their use of the double spring feature.

19

That's not the complaint.

You said they could have --

20

MR. ARTZ:

No.

21

QUESTION:

-- used the double springs if they

22

had put them separate --

23

MR. ARTZ:

Yes.

24

QUESTION:

-- separately and apart.

25

MR. ARTZ:

-- possibly, in a bit different
41

1

visual image and appearance, Your Honor.

2
3

QUESTION:

And the double springs next to each

other was not part of your original patent application --

4

MR. ARTZ:

No, it was not.

5

QUESTION:

-- that they were originally apart.

6

MR. ARTZ:

That's right.

7

QUESTION:

So the issue, really, is simply the

8

functionality of putting the springs close together.

9

Now, what if putting the springs close

10

together -- it would have nothing to do with the patent,

11

but what if putting the springs close together makes the

12

sign more stable?

13

MR. ARTZ:

14

it less stable.

15

twist.

16

Actually, technically it would make

It would make it easier, more easy to

QUESTION:

Okay, but if it made it more stable,

17

then you would acknowledge that they could copy even that

18

feature, the unpatented feature?

19

MR. ARTZ:

No.

They have an improvement in

20

performance that they say is more stable, but it doesn't

21

mean that they can still copy it if it's part of our trade

22

dress.

23

There's a -- the -- our trade dress has a number

24

of features, as I mentioned before.

25

coil springs.

It's not just the

They could use coil springs close together
42

1

as long as they change the base, or change the legs, or

2

change something which gave it a different visual

3

appearance to the public.

4

One of the touchstones here of the trademark

5

Lanham Act is to prevent confusion of the public, the

6

public buying this.

7

the public, which this does --

8

QUESTION:

9

You don't want to confuse or deceive

Well, the public isn't buying it.

It's highway departments that are buying it.

10

isn't buying this sign, is it?

11

MR. ARTZ:

12

That's the relevant public for this

purpose, Your Honor, yes.

13
14

The public

QUESTION:

Yeah, it's the highway department

purchasers.

15

MR. ARTZ:

That's correct.

16

QUESTION:

And doesn't the State typically

17

regulate the shape of the sign, as Justice Scalia asked

18

you?

19

MR. ARTZ:

Yes.

20

QUESTION:

I mean, diamond shape indicates a

21

certain kind of warning, does it not?

22

MR. ARTZ:

Correct.

23

QUESTION:

So they can use that shape and color,

24
25

presumably.

That's necessary.

MR. ARTZ:

Yes, I agree, Your Honor.
43

1
2

QUESTION:

So what are we arguing about, the

MR. ARTZ:

The -- yes, legs, the shape, the

legs?

3
4

base, and the springs, and then the upright.

5

single upright, too.

6

because it's a small model.

7
8

QUESTION:

It's a

This doesn't have the single upright

Well, what is the base, after you get

through with the legs, and the upright, and the springs?

9

MR. ARTZ:

Uh-huh.

10

QUESTION:

I mean, could you -- you indicate,

11

what are we arguing about, the legs and the base.

12

MR. ARTZ:

There's no -- I don't think there's

13

any doubt that these have a different visual appearance.

14

One has a wide base, one has a narrow base, one has

15

straight legs, one has X-shaped legs.

16
17

QUESTION:

So when you say base, that really is

another way of saying the legs?

18

MR. ARTZ:

No, it's what the legs are attached

19

to.

20

and here are the bases.

21

to.

22

It would be this -- this part in between the legs,

QUESTION:

It's what the legs are connected

But obviously you're holding up one

23

that's a rectangle, so it makes sense to have the posts on

24

either side, as opposed to the diamond shape, where it

25

makes sense to have it in the middle.
44

I mean, you're not

1

showing us an equivalent-shaped sign.

2

MR. ARTZ:

Well, this, under the doctrine of

3

equivalents, this was held to be an infringement.

But

4

right, individual appearance, I think they are different,

5

and so from a trade dress standpoint these are two

6

different products.

7

QUESTION:

Well, you're willing to fight out

8

the -- I gather you're willing to fight out the

9

functionality battle as to whether putting the two springs

10

right next to each other instead of apart is a functional

11

matter.

12

that ground?

13
14
15
16
17

You're willing -- are you willing to combat on

MR. ARTZ:

Well, I -- whether it's useful, has a

purpose, I mean, if that's functionality -QUESTION:

Whether it's functional within the

meaning of the trade dress restriction.
MR. ARTZ:

Well then the answer, I agree -- I

18

think is no, because is there a competitive necessity to

19

have them together?

20

QUESTION:

21

The answer is no.
Okay, but you would agree that that

inquiry would be addressed to the spacing of the springs.

22

MR. ARTZ:

Only --

23

QUESTION:

Even if we think that the use of

24

double springs is automatically no basis for giving you

25

trade dress protection, since you had patented the double
45

1

springs, you hadn't patented whether they were close

2

together or far apart and so whether putting them close

3

together, as your opponent did, is a violation of trade

4

dress protection would depend upon whether putting them

5

close together is functional within the meaning of trade

6

dress law, right?

7

MR. ARTZ:

It's whether or not their whole

8

visual appearance, of a combination of five features, is

9

functional in the competitive necessity test.

10
11

That's

why -QUESTION:

I thought you a minute ago

12

acknowledged that if the two springs were closer together

13

it would be less wind-resistant than otherwise, which

14

seems to me demonstrates it has some functional

15

significance whether they're close or not.

16

-- better resistant to the wind than the other, doesn't --

17

isn't that functional, isn't that enough to prove

18

functionality?

If one is a

19

MR. ARTZ:

Not the legal functionality test --

20

QUESTION:

Not under all these tests, but why

21
22

shouldn't it be enough?
The Government argues that the competitive need

23

is a sufficient proof but not a necessary proof of it as a

24

defense to the trade dress argument.

25

MR. ARTZ:

Well, the problem you have, Your
46

1

Honor, is that tests -- either the Government's test or

2

Traffix' test is going to be unworkable, because you could

3

have company A that makes this product, or comes up with

4

this idea, company B.

5

17 years.

6

Company A gets a patent on it, goes

Company B doesn't get a patent, and gets trade

7

dress protection on it, and yet company A for some reason

8

doesn't sue them, but when this patent expires, that means

9

all the trade dress that company B has developed over all

10

those years is shot.

11

happens to be the subject of a patent.

12
13
14

It's out the window, because it

See, that's a problem with this per se test that
they're saying.
QUESTION:

I don't -- I thought as a factual

15

matter that there are five features in your patent,

16

including the legs, all the other things of appearance,

17

but the district court found that there are a lot of other

18

competitors that have every one of those features, so it's

19

not unique but for the spaced-apart coil springs, so that

20

all were -- is that true?

21

MR. ARTZ:

That's true.

22

QUESTION:

All right, so all we're talking

23

about -- and then I thought also as a factual matter that

24

somebody before the patent expired used those two spaced-

25

apart springs in that narrow configuration that your
47

1

finger's on right now.

2

MR. ARTZ:

Uh-huh.

3

QUESTION:

And you sued them, and it was found

4

in your claim, in your view, those spaced-apart that much,

5

not wide apart, violated your patent, and you won.

6

MR. ARTZ:

Well, the patent covered some other

7

things other than that.

8

compression along the coils of the spring.

9

to meet a certain geometric relationship with the center

10
11

They had to have initial
They also had

of gravity -QUESTION:

But they didn't get out of it -- they

12

didn't get out of your patent, because the springs were

13

close together rather than being far apart.

14

MR. ARTZ:

15

equivalents, and --

16

QUESTION:

Yeah.

17

MR. ARTZ:

-- one language of the claim which

18

Well, that's the doctrine of

calls for spaced-apart springs, and then we --

19

QUESTION:

That's right.

20

MR. ARTZ:

It was equivalent from a patent

21

standpoint whether two springs together were the

22

equivalent of two springs spaced apart.

23

QUESTION:

That's right, so I --

24

MR. ARTZ:

That was that issue.

25

QUESTION:

Yeah.
48

1

MR. ARTZ:

That's only one of several issues in

2

that patent case, and the fact that the others happened to

3

use this coil spring, they used the other parts, that

4

shows you that you can change one or two parts of this

5

particular trade dress and comes up -- have something that

6

looks completely different.

7

made a flat spring, they had a horizontal spring, they put

8

two springs at 45-degree angles, you could change the

9

legs, you could change the upright -- all of those might

In that case, the competitors

10

give a different visual impression.

11

Circuit said.

12

That's what the Sixth

See, the district court in this case

13

concentrated on just the two springs, and the Sixth

14

Circuit said that was not proper because it's the overall

15

appearance, visual, visual and image of the product which

16

really controls.

17

You can't look at one --

QUESTION:

But it seems to me if the different

18

spacing is the functional -- is a functional equivalent

19

for patent law, then it seems to me that the spacing of

20

the spring is part of your patent protection.

21

MR. ARTZ:

All right.

22

QUESTION:

As well as the nature of the springs,

23

and so the square stand is no different for purposes of

24

the issue in this case than the diamond-shaped stand.

25

MR. ARTZ:

As long as you don't confuse the
49

1

patent law with the trade dress law, Your Honor, two

2

separate and distinct, but from a patent law standpoint

3

you're right, but not from the trade dress standpoint.

4

There's another -- right now we're looking at

5

the public domain, and the difference is where it comes

6

from.

7

recognition.

8

it doesn't, then you can use it.

9

real consistent -- not a real consistent argument.

If it comes from a patent, it's given special

10

You can't use it for the trade dress, but if
Now, that to me is not a

You also have the fact that as -- where do you

11

look at the trade dress and this functionality, look at

12

one patent, look at two patents, what if there are several

13

patents that show it.

14

You know, what if you don't even own the

15

patents?

16

What if you didn't own it?

17

or if a third party owns the patent.

18

things, questions we raise at the back of our brief that

19

Traffix and the Government really can't answer.

20

really do admit that if someone is the subject matter of

21

one patent by one person, and it expires, somebody else's

22

trade dress will expire.

23

What if we were just a licensee and asserted it?
Would that make a difference,
There are several

They

I mean, right now we also have a situation where

24

they're trying to get special protection for utility

25

patents, which is different than, for example, for design
50

1

patents.

Or, talk about something being nonfunctional,

2

design patenting in which having this right, as you

3

mentioned before, of an exclusive period of 14 years

4

develop secondary meaning.

5

There's no question whatsoever that courts do

6

allow parties to get trade dress protection in such a

7

matter of design patents, and there you've got this

8

secondary meaning over 14 years in which you've used it

9

exclusively, and that goes to the look and appearance of

10

the product, but there's no problem with having trade

11

dress protection afterwards because it isn't functional,

12

so why should utility patents be treated any differently?

13

And as I said initially, there are different

14

areas of intellectual property law, you have different

15

standards, different tests, different remedies.

16

in trade dress law you have -- in trademark law you have

17

much different remedies to protect the public and

18

consumers.

You know,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.

24

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

25

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Your Honor.
51

1

There was until this morning no dispute that

2

moving the springs closer together was functional.

3

look at petition appendix page 54a, there is the

4

explanation from MDI's chief engineer that doing so makes

5

the sign more compact and weighs less, very important if

6

you're ferrying these things up and down the highway, and

7

also makes it less expensive to manufacture.

8
9

If you

As far as the two different sign stands, the
diamond one with the closely spaced springs, joint

10

appendix page 236, MDI said that those signs, even though

11

the other one was depicted in their patent, that the

12

closely spaced springs were, quote, slavish copies from

13

the standpoint of function of the sign stand described and

14

claimed in the Sartesian patents.

15

Third, that is the form in which they practiced

16

their patent, the closely spaced springs.

Kellogg,
