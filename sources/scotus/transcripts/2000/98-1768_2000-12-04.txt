ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

We'll hear argument

MR. GELLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

The plaintiffs in this case are people who

12

underwent back surgery in which particular medical devices

13

were used.

14

recover for injuries allegedly caused by their -- by these

15

devices, but this is a very unusual form of State law

16

product liability action.

17

these devices were in any way defective.

18

here of manufacturing defect.

19

design defect.

20

surgeons who used these devices did anything wrong.

21

There's no claim here of medical malpractice.

22

They brought this suit under State law to

The plaintiffs don't claim that
There's no claim

There's no claim here of

The plaintiffs also don't claim that the

Instead, the plaintiffs' sole claim in this case

23

is the following.

They assert that the Federal Food &

24

Drug Administration was deceived into giving regulatory

25

clearance to these devices, that, absent this deception,

1

these devices would never have been on the market, and

2

that, if the devices had never have been on the market,

3

they wouldn't have been used in their surgeries and they

4

wouldn't have suffered any injuries.

5

So this lawsuit is, in other words, a direct

6

attack under State law on the decision of the Federal Food

7

& Drug Administration applying Federal law to allow these

8

devices to be marketed in interstate commerce and, if this

9

suit is allowed to proceed, it means that a jury applying

10

State law would have to decide such issues as, what sorts

11

of disclosures have to be made to the Food & Drug

12

Administration in the context of seeking 510(k) approval

13

for a device?

14

devices and their intended use?

15

any way in granting regulatory clearance?

16

What did the FDA know about these specific

QUESTION:

Was the FDA deceived in

Do they really have to get into all

17

of those issues, because I thought at least one theory of

18

the plaintiffs' case was simply representation as

19

determined on an objective basis and the only thing the

20

jury would have to decide was whether, on an objective

21

basis, the representation that the devices were intended

22

for, what was it, long bone surgery, something other than

23

spinal surgery, was true or false?

24

go beyond that?

MR. GELLER:

Why would they have to

do that because there's a fraud claim and if you look at

the complaint --

QUESTION:

Well, that would be a question of

intent on the part of the company, but it --

5

MR. GELLER:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. GELLER:

It would -I'm sorry, go ahead.
It would be more than that, Justice

8

Souter.

If you look at the complaint, for example, at

9

page 21 of the joint appendix, paragraphs 131 and 132

10

allege not only that a false statement was made but

11

reliance and causation and all the things that you have to

12

prove in order to prove a State law cause, State law fraud

13

action.

14

So it's not enough simply to prove that a

15

misrepresentation was made in order to recover on it.

16

would also have to prove whether the misrepresentation was

17

material, whether the FDA knew what was allegedly not told

18

to it, whether the FDA thought that it was relying on the

19

absence of the information, relied on the

20

misrepresentation and then finally, what would the FDA

21

have done if it had been told the truth, the causation

22

theory.

23

QUESTION:

You

Mr. Geller, why wouldn't it be

24

adequate to show that, that there had been two prior

25

applications that were rejected for use of this device for

spinal surgery?

2

MR. GELLER:

Your Honor, the -- what the

3

manufacturer has to show in seeking 510(k) is, in addition

4

to showing that the device has the physical technological

5

characteristics of the predicate device the manufacturer

6

also has to put down what the intended use of the device

7

is.

8

put down any intended use it wants, as described in the

9

labeling.

10

It's -- the manufacturer under the law is entitled to

What the plaintiffs seem to claim here is that

11

the FDA, is that the manufacturer had to allege not simply

12

that the intended use was for the long bones, which was

13

the manufacturer was entitled to allege, but also,

14

according to the complaint, that once the device got on

15

the market the manufacturer intended that it be used for

16

spinal applications, and that our -- and therefore a State

17

jury would have to determine what would the FDA have done,

18

if it had been told, as the plaintiffs allege the

19

manufacturer should have told the FDA, that once this

20

device gets on the market the intent was to see it used

21

significantly for spinal applications.

22

QUESTION:

But my point was simply that we do

23

have two applications that said the intended use is for

24

spinal surgery and both of those applications were turned

25

down.

Isn't that enough to infer that if they had for a

1

third time said the same thing they'd be turned down

2

again?

3

MR. GELLER:

Well, I think the opposite, Justice

4

Ginsburg. I think it shows that the FDA was well aware of

5

the possibility of using these devices for spinal

6

applications and when the manufacturer came in, as it was

7

entitled to do, and that now we want to seek 510(k)

8

approval to label these devices for the long bones of the

9

arm and leg, the FDA was well aware that the devices had

10

some possibility of being used for spinal applications.

11

After all, I think the mistake here --

12

QUESTION:

So you're saying in effect that there

13

would be an issue of whether the FDA was complicit in the

14

deception itself?

15

MR. GELLER:

Absolutely, what did the FDA

16

actually know about the use of these devices, and that's

17

in our view not an inquiry that should be made under State

18

law.

19

In fact, one of the -QUESTION:

We know -- I mean, as Justice

20

Ginsburg's question suggests it would be fairly easy to

21

prove what the FDA knew about possible applications, but I

22

think, if I understand your answer to her, your answer is,

23

well, that still doesn't simplify the case, because the

24

issue then would become, even on that assumption, did the

25

FDA understand perfectly well that this fraud was nothing

but a fraud, and they winked at it and said, sure, this is

2

an easy way of letting them do what they want to do even

3

though we've said before that we won't let them do it.

4

other word -- is that in effect what you're --

5

MR. GELLER:

In effect, although whether it was

6

even a fraud at all -- you see, I think one of the

7

problems here is in viewing the intended use statement

8

under 510(k) as a factual representation at all.

9

a factual representation at all.

10
11

In

It's not

It's simply a request

for marketing clearance.
The manufacturer decides by its labeling what

12

sort of marketing clearance it seeks for its devices.

13

FDA's role is simply to look at the labeling and determine

14

whether there was a device on the market prior to 1976

15

with those physical characteristics and that labeling.

16

QUESTION:

The

It's really a misnomer, then, if

17

they're going to use it the way you say they have been and

18

ought to use it, they shouldn't call it intended use.

19

They should have -- it should be called permitted use, or

20

approved use, or something like that.

21

MR. GELLER:

Absolutely, Justice Scalia.

I

22

think intended use is a misnomer.

It's a term of art in

23

the food and drug law, and I think the statute and the

24

regulations are as clear as can be, it is simply a request

25

for marketing clearance by describing how you intend to

2

representation as to how that device will actually be used

3

off-label once the device is on the market, which is, I

4

think, one of the many problems with the plaintiffs' claim

5

here.

6

It is not at all a factual

But the point that I was simply making is the

7

sorts of inquiries that a State judge or jury would have

8

to make if this State law claim were allowed to proceed

9

are inquiries that would delve heavily into the

10

intricacies of the Federal regulatory process and, in

11

addition, in addition to prevail on their claims the

12

plaintiffs would have to convince a State jury that these

13

devices should never have been on the market and were not

14

lawfully on the market, even though the FDA has decided as

15

a matter of Federal law that the devices are lawfully on

16

the market, so to rule for plaintiffs, a jury under State

17

law would have to essentially disregard and nullify a

18

binding decision of the FDA.

19

Now, our position is that a claim such as this,

20

which essentially amounts to an attack under State law on

21

a binding determination by a Federal agency is both

22

expressly and impliedly preempted by the Federal food and

23

drug laws.

1

whether the plaintiffs' cause of action really is an

2

attack, at least on its face, on an FDA decision, because

3

the FDA decision, as I understand it, is a decision to

4

allow the devices to be marketed for the long-bone use,

5

and their cause of action, as I understand it, is that in

6

fact, as a result of this lie, this fraud on the FDA, it

7

was, in fact, allowed to be used, or it was possible to

8

use it, I guess is the neutral word, on the spine.

9
10

MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

Yes.
But that is not attacking a decision

11

of the FDA because, in the sense that the FDA, as I

12

understand it, says yeah, we'll permit it for the purposes

13

of long-bone use.

QUESTION:

Oh, it's true, and the surgeons are

for more than long bones, hasn't the FDA in effect washed

MR. GELLER:

But it is not inconsistent in any

way with the FDA's decision.

The FDA decided here that

10

the -- that this 510(k) satisfied the statute in the sense

11

that the device was similar, substantially equivalent both

12

in its characteristics and its intended use to a predicate

device.

In fact, it had a right to be on the market.

it was lawfully on the market.

For instance, the use of, what is it,

the cholesterol-reducing drugs for memory enhancement and

3

that sort of thing is perfectly okay, even though it's

authorized only for the cholesterol?

MR. GELLER:

Absolutely.

The statute is quite

clear.

Congress made it quite clear that the FDA has no

7

control over the practice of medicine.

8

approve drugs and devices to be marketed for particular

9

purposes.

All it does is

Once they're on the market, physicians and

10

surgeons are entitled to use the devices for any purpose

11

consistent with their own medical judgment, and off-

QUESTION:

Now, I assume these plaintiffs would

have a cause of action against the physicians who made the

In fact, Justice Souter, you can imagine a

that I was trying to raise was how we ought to

What happened thereafter, it may have been a

It is perfectly

It is perfectly lawful, perfectly consistent

10

with the statute, perfectly protective of the public

health, to seek approval under section 510(k) for a device

by saying it has intended use A, even though you hope,

13

expect, intend that once the device gets on the market it

14

would be used primarily, or even exclusively, for use B.

15

That's perfectly consistent with the Federal statutory

16

scheme.

17

Now, what you can't do is market it for use B,

but it's perfectly appropriate, under the statute, to

Suppose a consultant like your client here, in assisting

the labeling of a drug or device, does not disclose a side

effect, and the side effect is not on the label, and

Very well, Mr. Geller.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

insofar as they would be asserting an essential element of

I'm not aware of cases, but we

think the same general principle, if a court is defrauded

does is that an essential element of this claim is that

2

the devices never should have come to market under Federal

3

law, whereas the FDA has determined that they should, and

4

the fact that there is an allegation here that that

5

decision was secured through fraud does not avert the

6

conflict, because the FDA can reconsider its decisions and

7

withdraw them if it determines they've been secured by

8

fraud, but unless and until it does that, those decisions

remain binding and authoritative, and they preempt any

conflicting State law claims.

question about whether or not the Food, Drug and Cosmetic

21

founded on a violation of Federal requirements, and what

22

the Court said, and said so unanimously, was that there is

23

nothing in Federal law which prevented the States from

24

affording a private damage remedy, one not given by

25

Federal law at all, for violations of the Food, Drug, and

act, and that was not limited to negligence cause of

actions.

4

It was focused on violations of the act.
In the present case, our claim does not derive

from some newfangled principle of tort law.

Our claim

6

derives from a longstanding principle of tort law which

7

has been in force in this country, in the States, in

principle reflected in section 536 and 557(a) of the

does not only go to negligence per se, but tort law says

that where one is required to file, furnish, or publish

that is where the culpable conduct lies.

Now, of course, it's true that that principle is

not frequently invoked, because in many cases it's easier

QUESTION:

And the intended use, according to

2

Mr. Geller, is a term of art, which means the use for

3

which you want FDA approval.

4

MR. FISHBEIN:

I disagree with that, Justice

5

Scalia, and I think that it's clear, and the Government

6

agrees with this position, that intended use not only in

7

this section of the statute but every other place is

8

defined objectively by the manner in which the proponent

9

of the device intends to characterize the device in the

10
11

market.
And I think it's significant that in the

12

regulations governing 510(k) disclosure -- I believe it's

13

807.87(e) of title 21, or of 21 C.F.R. -- what the FDA

14

says is, don't just give us the label that's going to

15

accompany this product.

16

labeling sufficient to describe the intended use of the

17

device, and labeling through a series of case law and

18

decisions says that it is not only -- and in your decision

19

in Cordell, in fact, it is not only what is on the

20

product, it is the promotional materials which accompany

21

the product which demonstrate how the product will be

22

characterized in the marketplace which determine intended

23

use, and that is consistent with the legislative scheme.

say, here is a screw, I'm going to use this as a screw to

6

build crutches, when you know darned well that you're

never going to characterize it that way in the market.

8

It's not a crutch screw, it's a bone screw, and --

9

In this case they were not, and my point is

QUESTION:

But the thing that makes this case so

10

peculiar is, a Government agency, a private Attorney

11

General coming in to say that the agency has been

12

defrauded.

citizen coming in and saying, Government agency, I'm going

14

to be your champion, you have been defrauded.

15

It's not like in the SEC.

I don't know of any precedent for a private

The SEC says, yeah,

we need people to help us enforce because we can't go

after all those bad actors, quite different from here,

saying, agency, you've been defrauded, and we private

citizens are going to decide.

20

anything like this?

21

MR. FISHBEIN:

Is there any precedent,

I believe that there is, Justice

22

Ginsburg.

I think, in fact, your opinion in Medtronic, at

23

least the unanimous portion, says that private plaintiffs

24

can rely upon violations of food, drug, and cosmetic law

if they can otherwise do so under State law to recover

I don't mean the FDA, because as far

as I know this is a novel claim.

10

QUESTION:

Is there any case where

I can't cite the case, but your --

Where there's a claim for fraud on

the SEC?

11

MR. FISHBEIN:

Sure.

Where you have a false

12

filing with the SEC and people purchase in reliance on the

13

false information contained in that filing, I think it is

14

actually a statutory cause of action.

15

QUESTION:

That's a -- but that's --

That's fraud on them.

you have a false -- you made a false statement in a filing

1

QUESTION:

Do you have another example besides

2

the SEC filings, which are, of course, meant to be

3

presented to the investors and therefore constitute fraud

4

on the investors themselves?

5

MR. FISHBEIN:

There was a case, an important

6

case decided by the Third Circuit, not by you, by Justice

7

Becker, called Stanton By Brooks v. Astro Pharmaceutical,

8

which held in the early 1980's that the failure to

9

discharge duties of disclosure in connection with a drug

10

or device rendered the product defective per se under

11

section 402 of the Restatement, and allowed a court to

12

award damages based on the theory that the FDA, had they

13

received appropriate disclosures, would have acted

14

differently and would have protected the plaintiff from

15

injury and therefore which allowed recovery.

16

There are also other appellate cases within the

17

appellate system which are cited in our brief, Learjet v.

18

Spindlauer, which I think is a Fifth Circuit case, and

19

there are a few others which recognize -- and that case

20

was an aviation case, where a fraudulent -- a license was

21

obtained fraudulently from the FAA, also a case called

22

Hawkins, cited in our briefs, where the -- again a Federal

23

court case, an appellate case, where the court recognized

24

that that kind of misrepresentation changes the whole

25

regulatory calculus, deprives the public of an informed

1

decision with respect to the product, and that could

2

render the product dangerous and people can recover based

3

on that.

4

So there is a recognition both in the common law

5

of that, and what I would suggest is that in Medtronic,

6

both explicitly and as a matter of implied preemption

7

which is not dealt with directly in Medtronic, that States

8

are not foreclosed from doing that, because there is no

9

impact here on any function with which the FDA is

10

entrusted.

11

QUESTION:

Well, I found it rather hard to find

12

that in my opinion in Medtronic, which was a separate

13

opinion.

14

MR. FISHBEIN:

Your opinion, Justice Breyer, was

15

the one opinion which didn't go off on the distinction

16

between remedies and requirements and the State --

17

QUESTION:

I mean, I would find it surprising,

18

wouldn't you, that if you have a private right of action,

19

to say in any of the thousands and thousands of State

21

see, what these people did is, they got their brief in

QUESTION:

There would be no cause of action

MR. FISHBEIN:

QUESTION:

No, there wouldn't be.

No, all right, so -- and because it

5

would be up to the agency to enforce its own rule, isn't

6

it?

7

MR. FISHBEIN:

No.

I would have a different

8

reason for that, Your Honor, and the reason I would

9

advance for that --

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. FISHBEIN:

Is?
-- is that in that particular

12

circumstance the failure to follow Federal law was not

13

something that had to do with the safety of --

14

QUESTION:

No, no, no.

Whether it's Federal or

15

State, I don't care.

I mean, take any agency you want.

16

Take a municipal council, I don't care.

17

amazing to me that you'd find somebody getting a private

18

right of action based upon, under ordinary tort law

19

principles, based upon the agency not following its own

20

procedural rules, that the person violated some procedural

21

rule, because you'd say that's up to the agency, and of

22

course my question is, how is this any different, and of

23

course my opinion in Medtronic says that we look to see

24

what the agency wants and if the agency thinks it's

25

preempted, good-bye, and that seems to me in essence what

you have here.
Now, I'm putting it that to you to get an
answer, not because I'm wedded to it.
MR. FISHBEIN:

There's a couple of embedded

5

questions in there, Your Honor.

One, I do believe it's a

6

traditional principle of tort law, not as a matter of

7

implying cause of action but as a matter of negligence per

8

se, or liability per se, that where somebody violates a

9

statute or regulation, regardless of who's in charge of

10

administering that statute or regulation intended for the

11

protection of the public, any harm caused by that is

12

actionable under State law, not because you're implying a,

13

in the case of Federal law a Federal cause of action, but

14

just as a matter of negligence per se.

15

So the question then is, is this a substantive

16

safety regulation that we're talking about here, or is it

17

a procedural regulation, and I say it's a substantive

18

safety regulation, because the heart of the Federal

19

scheme, and there's hundreds of cases on this regulating

20

food, drug, and cosmetics, is, you are only regulating

21

by -- with respect to what the device or drug is, and that

22

is a function of two things, both what it physically is

23

and what it's conceived to be for marketing purposes, and

24

if you misrepresent to the public what it is, or you

25

misrepresent to the agency what it is, you're undermining

the central safety aspects here.

2

For -- it's easy to see that in this case,

3

because when the agency was told this was a spinal

4

fixation device and that that's what it was, they said,

5

you can't put that on the market.

6

QUESTION:

There are a number of things.

We're

7

on precisely the same track, because in my mind I was

8

thinking substantive/procedural, something like that, and

9

what's fraud, and then if I push it towards -- I can be

10

elliptical because I think we're thinking alike.

11

The -- if you push it towards the substantive

12

side, then I get into the problem of the agency having a

13

bunch of powers.

14

relief, monetary penalties, seizure, criminal

15

prosecutions, withdrawal of market clearance.

They could enforce it through injunctive

particular misrepresentation is not that serious in light

of their basic job, shouldn't it be up to them to decide

21

how to enforce it rather than up to a jury?

22

I mean, after all, their job is to protect the

MR. FISHBEIN:

We don't know here whether they

23

think it's serious or not, so that's the first point, but

24

more fundamentally, insofar as the remedies that you've

25

enumerated are concerned, I do believe that the FDA has

exclusive prosecutorial discretion.

2

section 337 of title 21 does preempt the ability of States

3

to give, for example, injunctive relief, civil penalties,

4

and to suspend somebody's license to sell these products.

5

I agree with all that.

6

I do think that

But what the Federal law doesn't give, and what

7

Congress reserved to the States when it passed the Federal

8

law, it doesn't give anybody the ability to compensate the

9

victims that I represent for the damages that he's

10
11

sustained as a result of the fraud.
QUESTION:

That's because the FDA doesn't want

12

them compensated for this kind of thing because it's

13

decided that the harm to them, which they're not

14

understating, would be outweighed by the need to get this

15

drug on the market to fight the monopolistic advantage

16

that people would have without it being there.

MR. FISHBEIN:

Your Honor, they made no such

determination in this case.
QUESTION:

No, no, that's true, but they say,

the way we make these determination is by deciding which

21

remedy to pick, and we pick the lesser ones when we think

22

we want this thing on the market.

23

ones when it should be gotten rid of, and if you leave it

24

up to the jury, of course, that's the same as getting rid

of the product.

MR. FISHBEIN:

I disagree that it's the same as

getting rid of the product.

What happened is, the product

as bone screws entered the market, I say unlawfully.

4

if the FDA has not revoked the 510(k) clearance it's

because the product is still legitimately on the market as

concedes was pretextual and would be improper if the facts

we allege are true.

MR. FISHBEIN:

The F -- we have gone to the FDA

and they have not ruled yea or nay, and I believe that

their brief concedes that they have not made a

determination as to the lawfulness of this conduct in any

20

context, both when the application was received by them,

21

or subsequently, and they take the position that when

22

someone applies for 510(k) clearance they cannot simply

23

list a use, an intended use, in quotes, which is

24

pretextual.

right, is that the use must be bona fide.

intend, the product must have an intended use, meaning you

3

intend to characterize it in the market for that use.

Now, true --

5

QUESTION:

You must

Shouldn't there be some, even a

6

notion of -- assuming that there could be such a complaint

7

at all, of primary jurisdiction, or exhaustion or

8

something, to let the agency speak for itself?

9

doesn't think that it's been defrauded, that should be the

10

end of it.
MR. FISHBEIN:

The doctrine of exhaustion I

12

think does not apply here, because that presupposes that

13

the agency has the power to give a remedy that the

14

plaintiffs want and in this case that would be damages,

15

and the agency clearly does not have that power.

16

The doctrine of primary jurisdiction is a

17

doctrine which enables a court to make a referral to an

18

agency to make a determination of some issue of fact

19

that's germane to the case.

20

such a referral here and, looking at your recent case,

21

Southwest Marine, Inc. v. Gissone and Rider v. Cooper, it

22

seemed to me that if there was no primary jurisdiction

23

asserted in those cases, one, for example, whether someone

status or seaman status, that was not to be referred to

the agency there, that this seemed to me to be an

2

inappropriate case for the exercise of primary

3

jurisdiction.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Fishbein, even if you say in this

5

case the agency hasn't ruled yea or nay on the particular

6

facts here, do you have at least some other case where the

7

FDA, which has this authority to find that it has been

8

defrauded, has withdrawn something from the market or has

9

imposed some other penalty because the application did not

10

contain uses that were anticipated, although they were not

11

set forth in the application?

12
13

MR. FISHBEIN:

I know of no such case, Justice

Scalia, but that's not our position.

14

QUESTION:

Don't you think that's significant?

15

Doesn't it tend to support Mr. Geller's contention that

16

all the FDA cares about is what use do you want authority

17

to market for, and so long as you set forth that use,

18

you'll have authority to market for it, and anything else,

19

you may anticipate it's going to be used for other things,

20

but that's all we're approving, is this marketed use?

21

MR. FISHBEIN:

But Justice Scalia, that's not

22

the agency's position and that's not what its regulations

say.

That's not correct, Justice

Scalia.

8

QUESTION:

It isn't?

9

MR. FISHBEIN:

The allegation to the complaint

here and the factual support here indicate that this

So they lied to the FDA, then they got clearance,

MR. FISHBEIN:

The answer to your question,

As to other

defendants, yes, but as to other defendants, why would we

bring Buckman in this if we had other solvent defendants?

QUESTION:

So Buckman is the one that has the

that's correct, and we are attempting to try to recover

widespread and caused so much injury that there's simply

not enough money with the potential culpable defendants.

I suspect even Buckman does not have sufficient

QUESTION:

But the cause of action does require

the jury to decide, in effect to second-guess the FDA?

MR. FISHBEIN:

I disagree with that, Justice

O'Connor, and here's why.

14

nothing that needs to be second-guessed.

told -- if we look at page 58 of the joint appendix, the

FDA asked Buckman, what is the intended use of this

because the FDA had reviewed this and seen it was a spinal

device before.

The FDA did nothing wrong, or
They were

Page 58 is a letter from Buckman back to the FDA,

Now it's being presented as a long-bone device,

and Mr. Shlerf of Buckman said, for purposes of this

QUESTION:

In fact --

Well, except section 132 of the

5

complaint says, were it not for these fraudulent acts and

6

statements the FDA would not have issued the 510(k)

7

clearances for the screw for any purpose, the devices

8

wouldn't have been introduced into interstate commerce,

9

and plaintiff wouldn't have been exposed.

MR. FISHBEIN:

11

QUESTION:

12
13

Yes, Your Honor.

I mean, that looks pretty much like

second-guessing to me.
MR. FISHBEIN:

Actually, it's enforcing what the

14

FDA had previously determined on two occasions, one of

15

which was about 3 or 4 months before that.

16

specific determination that these devices were not

17

substantially equivalent for pedical screw use or spinal

18

use twice, and the consequence of that was that they

19

didn't belong in the market.

20

The FDA made a

So what we're doing here is simply vindicating

21

an explicit regulatory determination made to protect

22

persons in the position of the plaintiff from the kind of

23

harm that occurred here.

has various authorities to follow this thing up and may

2

choose not to follow it up.

3

MR. FISHBEIN:

That's correct, Your Honor, but

4

the Government's authority is in its capacity to protect

5

the public through the remedies given to it, and my

6

contention is, and I think --

7

QUESTION:

8

Well, the Government's authority is

also to limit those remedies if it so chooses.

9

MR. FISHBEIN:

I would suggest, Your Honor, that

10

the Government has no power to limit the availability of

11

damage relief and that Congress did not want it to limit

12

the availability of damage relief.

13

QUESTION:

Well, if you say Congress didn't

14

intend to limit damages you're probably right, but the

15

Government -- assuming if Congress felt otherwise it would

16

be true, too.

17

MR. FISHBEIN:

Oh, if Congress said no damages?

18

There's no question that Congress has the power to do

19

that.

20

QUESTION:

No, but specifically, assuming what

21

you say is right, after the event the FDA finds out about

22

this, it says, we want to leave this stuff out there,

23

because it's more helpful than it is harmful, and

24

therefore we give you a wrist slap, you see, and why are

25

they doing that?

Because they want the drug out there to

lower price.
Now, you come along and say, I'm going to a
jury, and that will make sure it can't be out there.

4

Now, why doesn't this range of remedies give the

5

FDA just the authority that I mentioned, an authority that

6

you'll take away from them if you go to the jury, however

7

meritorious your case might be here?

8

MR. FISHBEIN:

I think, Your Honor, that

9

Silkwood basically answers that question both in terms of

10

the majority and the dissent in Silkwood, which said that

11

there is an independence here of regulatory restraint and

12

damage recovery which can and should and must peacefully

13

coexist with one another, so that the FDA, or in that case

14

the nuclear regulatory authorities, regulate -- from a

15

public regulatory standpoint they do what they do and the

16

State courts administer a remedy system which may, in

17

fact, have penal aspects to it, because in Silkwood,

remember, there was an award of punitive damages.

20

We're

So I think that the two can peacefully coexist,

21

and it's up to the State system applying State rules --

22

there are some States that would not allow us to recover

23

here, but there are many others that would, and there's --

have certain nondamage remedies should not usurp the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Fishbein.

MR. GELLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Just

a few things.

12

First, in response to Justice Scalia's question,

13

there is no precedent for this cause of action.

14

court of appeals, with the exception of the court below,

15

has held that the so-called fraud-on-the-agency claims are

16

preempted.

17

Every

Secondly, I want to address Medtronic, which is

18

the centerpiece of the plaintiff's argument here.

This

19

case is completely unlike Medtronic, in part for some of

20

the reasons Mr. Gornstein was getting into.

21

a garden-variety product liability claim under State law,

22

design defect, failure to warn.

23

in Medtronic that the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act be

24

construed, there was no suggestion that you had to inquire

25

into any agency determinations, there was no fraud-on-

Medtronic was

1

the-agency claim in Medtronic, and there was no claim of

2

implied preemption in Medtronic.

3

In fact, the existence of Medtronic suggests,

4

the decision in Medtronic suggests that the plaintiffs

5

have many common law claims available to them if these

6

products were defective, so it's not a case that the Court

7

was confronted with in Medtronic, where the argument of

8

preemption would have wiped out many preexisting State law

9

claims.

Here, no claim -- the States would not be ousted

10

of any claim that would have existed prior to the

11

enactment of the medical device amendments in this case.

12

Third, I just want to focus for the Court's

13

attention at, if you look at page 136 of the joint

14

appendix there's a strong suggestion here that what the

15

plaintiff's label as fraud on the FDA the irony here is,

16

actually was an idea that originated with the FDA to break

17

up this one device into its two constituent parts and to

18

seek 510(k) approval for each, so the notion that a State

19

court years later could conclude this was a fraud on the

20

FDA and enter a judgment that would -- might have the

21

effect of removing the device from the market is

22

completely inconsistent, we think, with Congress' scheme

23

here, which is to centralize enforcement authority with

24

the FDA.

MR. GELLER:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.
I don't want to eat up your time,

MR. GELLER:

MR. GELLER:

You do not have to -What does bona fide mean, then?
It's not our -- it's not our word,

16

it's the plaintiff's word.

What you have -- you're

17

seeking approval to market for a particular -- for a

18

particular use.

19

there's no requirement under the law that you market for

20

that use.

You can't market for some other use, but

21

Many devices and drugs are on the market --

QUESTION:

Then why do we have a fraud cause of

action, as opposed to a cause -- on the part of the

24

agency, as opposed to a cause of action for failing to
