ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. SUTTON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and

may it please the Court:

11

The Massachusetts Attorney General's advertising

12

ban constitutes a prohibition, based on smoking and

13

health, imposed under State law with respect to cigarettes

14

and other tobacco products.

15

reasons, it is preempted by Federal law and, for these and

16

other reasons, it abridges free speech in violation of the

17

First and Fourteenth Amendments.

For those straightforward

As to the preemption argument, the Court of

Appeals analysis is no longer being defended.

It cannot

Nor can the ban, alternatively, be defended on

23

the ground that it is not based on smoking and health.

Massachusetts' alternative argument is that the

ban can be sustained so long as there are other

permissible nonpreemptive grounds for the ban, but if --

QUESTION:

Well, what is it on the face of the

statutory scheme, of the Massachusetts scheme that tells

7

us that it is based on health?

8

MR. SUTTON:

9

Well, we know, Your Honor, as a

matter of motivation, it's based on, the phrase is based

10

on, so it has a subjective component to it and, as the

11

Attorney General acknowledged when he announced the

12

regulations -- look at J.A. page 251.

16

if I look at this on its face, what tells me that it's

MR. SUTTON:

Well, the very fact, Your Honor,

19

that the word based on, if you look at 5(b), they use the

Can you

MR. SUTTON:

2

QUESTION:

3

why is this based on health?

4

Well, if you look at the -Just from an objective standpoint,

MR. SUTTON:

Well, the fact is, under the ban

5

you're not allowed to have advertisements specifically

6

with the warning label that is required under Federal law,

7

so in that way, operationally, it's precluded.

8
9

But I just want to make sure that our position
is clear.

It has both an effects and an intent component

10

to it, the based-on-smoking-and-health language, and

11

that's why it's banned under either theory.

12

QUESTION:

So the fact that the Surgeon

13

General's warning cannot be advertised in conjunction with

14

a proposal for a commercial transaction means that health

15

is adversely affected?

16

MR. SUTTON:

Absolutely, Your Honor, and here's

17

the resaon.

18

amend section 5(d) and how to amend it, one of the great

19

concerns was that States or localities ultimately would

20

respond to the FTC's warning requirement on advertising by

21

ultimately expressing disagreement with that warning

22

requirement.

23

In 1969, when they were looking at whether to

The concern was after '69 they'd say, that's not

24

enough, we don't like it, and so what they'd do in

response is, they'd say, we're just going to ban

advertising altogether, and that's exactly what California

2

was considering in '69, New York City was considering in

'69.

4

they banned this very type of thing.

It was before the Congress in 1969, and that's why

QUESTION:

Other than the elimination and the

6

unavailability of the Surgeon General's warning, are there

7

any other objective and not subjective or motivational

8

features that I -- that show that this is based on health

9

that I can determine from the -- by looking at the

10

regulatory scheme itself?

11

MR. SUTTON:

Everything, Your Honor -- you're

12

saying specifically regulations themselves, and you're

13

saying we're not going to look at why Massachusetts did

14

that, and so just for a second we'll suspend that and

15

assume you don't look at intent.

intent, at what they did in effect, it's not just that you

of advertising suggests something peculiar about tobacco

that they didn't like.

1

that alone on the face of the statute proves the very

2

fact.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Sutton what are -- the response

4

to that was -- or one response to that was in the

5

Massachusetts brief, and it said, look, in the real world,

6

any -- as the Chief Justice suggested, any advertising ban

7

or lmitation directed to tobacco is going to be based on

8

smoke -- on the relationship between tobacco and health.

9

We recognize that.

10

They said, however, if you read the ban that

11

broadly, if you read the preemption that broadly, rather,

12

then the words of limitation, which are -- which refer to

13

smoking and health are going to have no limitation at all,

14

becasue it's going to include everything, and therefore

15

you've got to pull back or the words become meaningless.

16

What is your response to that?

17

MR. SUTTON:

Well, Your Honor, that's an

18

important point.

In 1969, the reason you had to have

19

based-on-smoking-and-health language there is, otherwise

20

this ban would apply to all general zoning laws.

21

words, you'd have ERISA II without the based-on-smoking-

to tobacco, it wouldn't be confused with a -- it wouldn't

2

be thought to raise a conflict with the general zoning

law, would it?

4

MR. SUTTON:

No, but that's my point.

My point

5

is that, without the based-on-smoking-and-health language

6

you'd have ERISA in the sense that every State law that

7

had any application to cigarette advertising would be

covered.

couldn't have general zoning laws regarding advertising,

QUESTION:

The based-on-smoking-

Well, that would assume -- it would

13

assume that the State laws would be interpreted to mean

14

that they were intended to modify zoning laws rather than

15

intended to regulate tobacco, and I don't know that that

16

would have been a realistic interpretation, would it?

MR. SUTTON:

question, but -QUESTION:

You're talking about general zoning

22

MR. SUTTON:

Exactly. Exactly, and I'm making

the point that, without the based-on-smoking-and-health

language you'd have a situation where section 5(b)

QUESTION:

Rather, it could have said,

specifically directed to cigarettes, and that would have

9

done it just as easily.

10

MR. SUTTON:

Well, the based-on-smoking-and-

11

health language, I think, does it very directly.

12

keep in mind, they were amending section 5(b) in 1969.

13

Prior to 1969 they had the language that said, statements

14

in advertising.

15

prohibitions with respect to advertising.

cover an awful lot of general laws but for the based-on-

but not sale, so for example -- and this is in Cippolone

2

at footnote 26 --

3

QUESTION:

Well, it's not that the State has to

4

address all aspects of the problem, but is the State not

5

entitled to do something about promotion and advertising

6

to the extent that it encourages underage people to smoke?

7

MR. SUTTON:

Well, I think there would be some

8

situaitons where State laws along those lines would not be

9

preempted, but they're very few.

10
11

Let me give you one

example.
QUESTION:

Well, and these laws have some of

12

that in there.

cigarettes it has to be a person-to-person transaction.

14

You can't get it from a vending machine, in order to

protect children.

For instance, the requirement that to sell

MR. SUTTON:

But that's not a law at this Court

17

that we're arguing is preempted here, and it's not one we

18

sought preemption on.

19

QUESTION:

Okay, so now what we have is outdoor

20

advertising, in effect, which the State says would

21

encourage children to smoke, so they want to restrict it.

22

MR. SUTTON:

I understand what you're saying.

I

23

think there is a line here that the Court is going to have

24

to draw, and I think it goes something like this.

That also must mean you couldn't have offers to

sell, conspiracies to sell, or a direct solicitation

3

for --

4

QUESTION:

Well, there may be limits on

5

advertising of some kind.

6

here, so I think the focus on smoking and health may be

7

just slightly off-base here.

8
9

MR. SUTTON:

That's what we're dealing with

But Your Honor, once you're beyond

a direct solicitation for a legal sale, you're into the

10

main core language of section 5(b), and keep in mind,

11

Congress was not unaware of the problems you're raising,

12

and that's why they made sure that the FTC had authority

13

in this industry to investigate unfair and deceptive trade

14

practices.

15

QUESTION:

But when you read the Federal

16

statute, it does seem to be directed more toward what has

17

to be on cigarette labels than anything else.

18

they didn't want a whole conflicting array of State

19

requirements of how the package had to be labeled.

20

MR. SUTTON:

I mean,

I respectfully disagree, Your

21

Honor, and this was the quid pro quo in 1969.

On the one

22

hand, in the same act they said there shall be no

23

cigarette advertisiing on radio and TV.

24

hand, the other side of the bargain is, we're not going to

25

let localities and States after the fact start to ban it

as well, just as they were considering doing.

2

But I think -- there are two things that get to

3

the children's solicitation.

If it is not a direct

solicitation for an illegal sale, then it is preempted,

but there are two reasons the Court may not be concerned

about that.

Massachusetts in 1993 asked the FTC to investigate a

9

tobacco company on just these accounts.

First, the FTC does have authority to

understand it.

19

If there's doubt on this, as to how this should

be interpreted, doesn't the presumption against preemption

of State control prevail, and isn't -- has -- it's not

embraced by only one circuit, the Fourth, and --

3

QUESTION:

How many circuits have held that

there is no preemption of size and location regulations?

4

MR. SUTTON:

Well, all told, four, but the three

5

others that have done it have done it with respect to

6

advertising, which is a theory that is no longer being

7

defended.

8

smoking-and-health theory was the fourth, and the Second

Circuit dismissed that as mere sophistry, as I think they

QUESTION:

With respect to allowing States to

regulate the location and the size, of signs.

13

MR. SUTTON:

14

QUESTION:

Exactly.
There are four circuits that have

held that there is no preemption of that.

given different reasons, but four have said that the

17

States' authority has not been taken away from them by the

MR. SUTTON:

They may have

And I'm just making the point that

20

three of those circuits embraced a reasoning that is no

21

longer being defended, which leaves the based-on-smoking-

22

and-health theory advocated here, and I don't know how you

23

can look honestly at their brief, the press release of the

24

Attorney General when he announced these regulations, and

25

say they weren't based on smoking and health.

That

animated everything they did.

QUESTION:

So would you like this Court, then,

to send it back and say, First Circuit, consider the

theories that other courts of appeals have accepted?

alternative ground that Massachusetts presented, but if

the Court wishes to send it back, that's fine.

agnostic about that point.

I mean, we've been willing to argue the

We're

But we do think either theory

does not work.

11

And the other point I wanted to make that I

12

think gets to your point, Justice Ginsburg, and yours,

13

Justice O'Connor, is, keep in mind these children's

14

solicitation hypotheticals are really hypotheticals.

15

mean, all of the major tobacco manufacturers entered into

16

an MSA, multisettlement agreement, multi-State settlement

17

agreement, in November of 1998, that prohibits this very

18

thing.

country.

I

I mean, this is something that cannot happen after

QUESTION:

Can I go back to your first point?

22

You started off saying this is a ban, and suppose

23

hypothetically I were to think that it's okay for the

24

State to regulate location, but not okay for them to ban

25

all advertising.

Then, at that point, you get to your

You have a number, and you have the maps.
When I saw the number, I thought, well, this is

3

a ban, because 90 percent of the area can't advertise.

4

Then I looked at the maps.

5

can't make heads or tails out of them.

6

thought the right question is, of the area previously

you no longer advertise as a result of this, and I can't

to your argument, on my assumption.

MR. SUTTON:

I mean, most of the population

Your Honor, this provides a

16

transition to the First Amendment argument.

17

ultimately, you are allowed to aggregate all State

18

conduct, so the 90-percent figure is a legitimate figure,

19

because it is aggregating all State conduct.

20

QUESTION:

I mean,

I'm not saying legitimate or not, but

21

in my own mind, I thought the relevant distinction turned

22

on taking the area previously available for advertising.

23

What percentage of that area was cut off?

cannot get an answer to that question in the State of

to whether this is more a ban, which sounds like content,

would submit it is an advertising ban.

MR. SUTTON:

Your Honor, the legislative history

Of course they're doing this because they feel there's a

bad relationship between smoking and health.

answer to that?

I'd find it hard to say that with a straight

I don't know what I'm supposed to say about that.

MR. PORTER:

What's the

The answer, Your Honor, is that the

17

phrase, based on smoking and health in section 5(b),

18

should obtain a more objective meaning than that, and the

19

objective meaning comes from construing that phrase in the

20

larger context of the act as a whole, otherwise, what we

21

have is a situation where the phrase, based on smoking and

22

health, really does become virtually unlimited.

Two things, Your Honor.

Again, I

think a close look at section 1331, the statement of

18

achieve is to obtain control over the health-related

information in cigarette advertising, and we see that with

specific language in section 1331, where Congress says,

we're going to provide a warning and we want to avoid

Your Honor, I think that what is

significant is what Congress didn't change in 1969.

MR. PORTER:

Your Honor, I -- the 1969

2

amendments clearly did expand the possible forms of

3

regulation that could be preempted, but it still retained

4

the focus on health-related content by virtue of the

5

retention of the phrase, based on smoking and health.

6

In addition, Your Honor, the fact that Congress

7

at the same time prohibited advertising on television and

8

radio, I don't think provides any basis for an

9

inference -- I think it would be a great stretch to infer

10

from that that Congress was invading the traditional

11

authority of the States to regulate the location of

12

advertising.

No, but it may well have been part of

MR. PORTER:

Your Honor, I don't think we should

the environment in 1969, and this is apparent in the

6

legislative history, Congress was concerned in general

7

with the prevalence of tobacco advertising and what to do

about a warning.

in advertising.

10

At the same time, considering

It provided, ultimately, for a warning
It did prohibit advertising on television

and radio.

11

But what you see in the legislative history is a

12

great concern that the advertising dollars that were saved

13

when TV advertising stopped would simply migrate to other

14

places.

15

throughout.

16

kind of concern, at the same time Congress would pass a

17

preemption provision that would essentially guarantee

18

tobacco, cigarette advertisers the right to advertise

19

anywhere.

20

Well, Congress -- that concern is expressed
It would be unlikely that in the face of that

you to put it this way.

I'm looking on page 15 of the

Government's brief that sets out the text of the

predecessor section, the one that Justice Scalia quoted.

It starts by saying, no statement relating to smoking and

You acknowledge that at least that has been

2

broadened to the extent of saying, no statement shall be

required or prohibited, I suppose.

4

MR. PORTER:

QUESTION:

Yes.
Now, it seems to me that where you

come out is to say that the new section means basically

what the old one did, except that it adds prohibited to

required.

does the new preemption section preempt?

Yes, on the State's reading.

The

allows the potential for preemption of certain common law

5

QUESTION:

That wouldn't have been possible

under the phrase, in the advertising?

6

MR. PORTER:

I don't believe so, Your Honor,

That, I must point out, is a significant
exception to the master settlement agreement.

significant increase in cigarette advertising at retail

Thank you, Mr. Porter.

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS
GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This State regulation is not preempted, because
it is not based on smoking and health within the meaning

1

of the Federal cigarette labeling and advertising law.

2

The regulation is based on smoking and health for purposes

3

of that statute only if it requires or prohibits claims

4

about smoking and health, and not just because it was

5

motivated by some underlying concern about smoking and

6

health based on --

7

QUESTION:

Why isn't a rule that says you can't

8

advertise at all a rule that prohibits claims based on

9

smoking and health?

10

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

Well, a rule that says that

11

you can't advertise at all is a blanket rule like a rule

12

that prohibits deception, which might also prohibit some

13

claims about smoking and health and isn't aimed at claims

14

on smoking and health, so I would say it's not prohibited

15

under that understanding of the preemption statute, but

16

one could distinguish that from this case.

17

I'd like to point out that based on can have

18

different meanings in different contexts, but when one

19

statute describes another statute as a rule based on

20

something, as a regulation based on something, that

21

language ordinarily refers to the operating criteria of

22

the regulation, and not the reason why it was adopted.

23

For example, when Congress in one statute refers

24

to another statute -- to taxes based on revenues, or it

25

refers to requirements imposed on vehicles based on size

or weight, it is using a shorthand description of a

category of statute, and it is describing the text of

statute uses, and not the reasons it came into existence.

It is, of course --

QUESTION:

Would you explain -- to make that

clear to me, would you explain to me, as I asked your

brother to do, what, then, on your view, the differences

9

are between the old preemption section, assuing that, what

10

was it, prohibition had been added to requirement, and the

11

new preemption section?

12

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

Yes.

Of course, the 1965

13

version expressly preempted laws that required statements

14

relating to smoking and health.

15

designed, said the Senate report, as a clarification and

16

not a radical reform.

17

The '69 amendment was

That doesn't mean nothiong was changed, but it

18

does mean that it was designed to reach various devices

19

that were the functional equivalent of required

20

statements, and weren't picked up by the old language.

So the old law was thought to have no

application to implicit statements.

By

1

dropping the term, statements, what Congress reached was,

2

with apologies to Justice Scalia, common law duties which

3

the Cippolone plurality noted might be requirements, but

4

weren't required statements, because required statements,

5

in the '65 act, was thought to refer to specific texts

6

that were required and it may also, as, Justice Souter,

7

you suggested, have reached attempts to regulate claims

8

that were made not by statement but by implication, such

9

as by images, or other implication.

10

And then by adding prohibitions Congress reached

11

State laws that would have the effect of requiring new

12

warnings, but would do so in the form of a prohibition,

13

say, for example, no advertising without this warning,

14

which in effect requires a warning, but does it in the

15

form of a prohibition, and it would also reach State laws

16

prohibiting affirmative health claims about filters, say,

17

or the safety of a particular cigarette.

18

There was for a period an incipient advertising

19

war about the safer cigarette, and there was some concern

20

about whether the States would choose to bar that, and the

21

FTC at various times had thought it was desirable to

22

promote that sort of competition or not, depending on --

No requirement or

health, assertions, representations.

And you think that based on smoking

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

I think that regulation

14

that tells you what the operating criteria of the

15

regulation are.

16

you look to weight to find out if it applies or not, and

17

if a regulation is based on -- if a tax is based on

18

revenue, then you look at revenue to find out whether or

19

how it applies.

If a regulation is based on weight, then

QUESTION:

How are these regulations based on --

21

the ones that you say are prohibited, how are they based

on health?

On smoking and health.

But one change in the statute was

that the '69 statute was just based on -- just applies to

11

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

12

QUESTION:

13

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

That's correct.

Yes.
Another thing that happened

14

is that promotions were added.

15

only with respect to advertising, but also with respect to

16

promotions, because give-away hats and T-shirts and

17

keychains can also make claims about smoking and health,

18

and because promotions in the form of endorsements or

19

events could be subject to a State requirement that health

disclaimers, that health warnings be given, and what

21

Congress wanted to do was take the States out of the

business of making judgments about and regulating on the

explanation of your views about the First Amendment

issues?

3

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

Yes.

I think the State's

4

interest in preventing school-age children from smoking is

5

truly compelling, in light of all the evidence that has

6

been recited, and that this regulation under Central

7

Hudson serves that goal in a significant way, because the

8

State had evidence showing that the ban to sales to

9

children was not effective, that it was reducing retail

10

sales to children, but not underage smoking, because

11

presumably that suggests that the children were getting

12

their cigarettes from people --

13

QUESTION:

If there was a prohibition as to all

14

advertising, would that be no more extensive than

15

necessary, in your view?

16

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

If there was a prohibition

17

as to all advertising, I think that would be more

18

expensive -- extensive than necessary.

19

QUESTION:

And if that were the practical effect

20

of this regulation because of the 1,000-foot dynamic,

21

would that change your answer?

22

GENERAL UNDERWOOD:

No, because this is just

23

outdoor -- I'm sorry.

A prohibition on all advertising is

24

different from a prohibition on outdoor advertising.

the window of time between 14-1/2 and 18 is the critical

It's the average -- the evidence is that the
