ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID E. NAGLE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. NAGLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Federal Arbitration Act is a declaration of

12

Federal policy favoring arbitration, arbitration

13

agreements, and its coverage extends to the very limits of

14

Congress' Commerce Clause power.

15

the act, the scope of which is in dispute today.

16

respondent asserts that all contracts of employment are

17

excluded from the coverage of the act.

18

be correct.

19

There's an exception to
The

That simply cannot

The act does not say that it excludes all

20

contracts of employment.

21

kinds of employment contracts, the contracts of employment

22

of seamen, railroad employees, any other class of workers

23

engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.

24
25

Section 1 excludes only certain

Beginning nearly 50 years ago, 11 courts of
appeals have read that text in a uniform, consistent
3

1

manner, finding it to create a narrow exclusion applicable

2

only to those workers who are actually engaged in the

3

movement of people or goods across State lines, and we

4

contend that that's the only interpretation consistent

5

with the text of the statute.

6

QUESTION:

7

argument?

8

MR. NAGLE:

9

QUESTION:

10

Is the word class important to your

Your Honor -Or would your argument be just the

same without --

11

MR. NAGLE:

I do not believe that it

12

significantly alters it.

13

which is used in the Railway Labor Act, for instance,

14

which was under consideration and passed the following

15

year to refer to categories of craft or class of

16

employees.

17

QUESTION:

I think the class is a term

Well, it would seem to me to help

18

your argument somewhat, because we -- the statute asks us

19

to think in terms of classes of workers, rather than

20

individual workers engaged --

21

MR. NAGLE:

Oh, certainly, Your Honor.

It

22

identifies a group or a category of employees in the same

23

manner that seamen and railroad employees are grouped.

24

Seamen, of course, was a recognized term.

25

of the Court -- as Justice O'Connor's opinion for the
4

As the opinion

1

Court in McDermott International recognized, seamen was a

2

term having specific meaning.

3

term defined under the Transportation Act of 1920 and also

4

in the Railway Labor Act, so --

5
6

QUESTION:

MR. NAGLE:

8

QUESTION:

10

13

Yes, Your Honor.
We had not taken as broad a view of

the Commerce Clause power as is true today, is that
correct?

11
12

Mr. Nagle, I guess at the time that

this act was adopted in -- what, 1925?

7

9

Railroad employees was a

MR. NAGLE:

I would acknowledge that, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

And so Congress probably didn't have

14

in mind that its jurisdiction was as broad as we would

15

have subsequently indicated, and apparently it intended at

16

least that the act not include or cover contracts of

17

employment over which their authority to regulate was very

18

clear, right?

19
20
21

MR. NAGLE:

That is correct, Your Honor.

They

were specifying seamen and railroad employees.
QUESTION:

And the indications were that at

22

least then Secretary of Commerce Hoover thought employees

23

shouldn't be covered at all, and he presented language to

24

the Congress which approved it, and yet you want us to say

25

that Congress did intend to include for arbitration
5

1

contracts of employment over which the jurisdiction was

2

most questionable, and yet exclude it for those where the

3

jurisdiction of Congress was clearest at the time, which

4

seems a little odd to me.

5

MR. NAGLE:

Well, there are several points in

6

response, Your Honor.

First, the letter from Secretary

7

Hoover was a letter submitted to the committee in 1923,

8

written on the day that it was entered, and there was no

9

further explanation.

10

I would also submit that we need to look to the

11

language of the coverage provision, section 2 of the act,

12

and contrast that with the language contained in section 1

13

of the act.

14

I acknowledge that Commerce Clause authority

15

over seamen and railroad employees would have been clear,

16

but I would also point -- bring to the Court's attention,

17

of course, the fact that there were statutory mechanisms

18

in place, and also the single item that we know most

19

clearly is that the seamen as a group, through their

20

representative, Mr. Bruce, have specifically asked that

21

they be carved out.

22

determine exactly what Congress' motive was, they were

23

responding to a request from a constituency group to be

24

carved out.

25

QUESTION:

While it may be somewhat difficult to

Well, the other most troublesome
6

1

point for me, anyway, is this Court's decision in Allied-

2

Bruce, which dealt with section 2, and said that we're

3

going to interpret it now as reaching the full scope of

4

Congress' Commerce Clause power.

5

same for this section 1?

6

MR. NAGLE:

Why would we not do the

Well, in Allied-Bruce, which is one

7

of the cases upon which we would principally rely, that

8

was an interpretation of section 2, the coverage, and

9

certainly was making it clear that the Court recognized

10

that Congress was acting to the full with respect to its

11

Commerce Clause power.

12

Section 1 is an exclusion.

It is to be narrowly

13

construed.

I would submit that there is a general policy

14

that whenever we have a statute which clearly enunciates a

15

public policy of broad scope that any exclusion to that

16

should be narrowly construed.

17

QUESTION:

Why is that?

I mean, it seems to me

18

an exception is just as important as the rule.

19

we unrealistically construe it just because it's an

20

exception?

21
22

MR. NAGLE:

Why should

I certainly would not suggest

that --

23

QUESTION:

Would you tell that to the members of

24

Congress?

When you vote for this exception, bear in mind

25

that we're not going to take it to have its most
7

1

reasonable meaning.

2

Why?

3

We're going to construe it narrowly.

Why would we do that?
MR. NAGLE:

I apologize, Your Honor.

4

suggesting that we take an unreasonable meaning.

5

I'm suggesting that we take the most reasonable

6

construction that Congress --

7

QUESTION:

I was not
In fact,

Well then, fine, so your case really

8

turns, it seems to me, on the point that the language used

9

by the Congress that enacted this statute in section 1 was

10

at that time narrower than the language used in section 2.

11

MR. NAGLE:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

Absolutely, Your Honor.
Now, what support do you have for

that?
MR. NAGLE:

I would point the Court first to --

15

for contemporaneous construction of the language I would

16

point the Court to Illinois Central Railroad v. Behrens, a

17

1914 case, where the Congress clearly recognized -- the

18

Court clearly recognized that the Congress had very broad

19

authority under the FELA statute over instate commerce,

20

recognized that even trains, for instance, moving in

21

intrastate commerce were nevertheless in the channels of

22

commerce, and so when the FELA in 1914 limited its

23

coverage to an employee who was injured while employed in

24

commerce, this Court found that that was a narrower

25

construction -8

1

QUESTION:

Employed in is not the same as

2

engaged in, but I'd like to go back, first, to the

3

involving term.

4

MR. NAGLE:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.
You're using words and say that --

6

saying that in the second section, involved is a very

7

broad term, and in the first section engaged is a narrow

8

term.

9

MR. NAGLE:

10

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
But some of the briefs in this case

11

tell us that involved in is not affecting commerce, that

12

indeed this is the only piece of Federal legislation that

13

uses the words, involved in.

14
15

MR. NAGLE:

Is that so?

To my knowledge it is, and that's

what the Court indicated in the Allied-Bruce decision.

16

QUESTION:

So -- but you're asking us to say

17

that Congress meant in 1925 something different in using

18

these two words.

19

MR. NAGLE:

In involving commerce says, as this

20

Court found in Allied-Bruce, that it's the functional

21

equivalent of affecting commerce, which is --

22

QUESTION:

23

words.

24

involving commerce?

25

Well, let's be precise about the

Are we talk about, involved in commerce, or

MR. NAGLE:

Involving commerce, in section 2,
9

1
2

the coverage.
QUESTION:

That's quite different than involved

3

in commerce.

4

I think that's quite different from saying that somehow

5

this -- it's a contract involving commerce.

6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14

You can say someone is involved in commerce.

MR. NAGLE:

I -- I'm sorry, Your Honor, I'm not

using the phrase, involved in -QUESTION:

I think it's important to your case

that involving commerce is a broader concept than involved
in commerce.
MR. NAGLE:

Yes, Your Honor.

I"m not aware that

involved -QUESTION:

Involving commerce means pertaining

to commerce.

15

MR. NAGLE:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Involved in commerce means pretty

17

much the same as engaged in commerce, it seems to me, and

18

so if involving commerce is the same as involved in

19

commerce, and involved in commerce is the same as engaged

20

in commerce, you lose.

21

MR. NAGLE:

Your Honor, I --

22

QUESTION:

To put it shortly.

23

MR. NAGLE:

24
25

I am not referring to the phrase,

involved in commerce.
QUESTION:

Because it doesn't appear.
10

The

1

phrase is involving commerce.

2

MR. NAGLE:

3

QUESTION:

4

Yes, Your Honor.
That's the broad coverage of

section --

5

MR. NAGLE:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. NAGLE:

Section 2, yes.
Of section 2.
Yes.

Section 1's exclusion is for

8

contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, and

9

other workers engaged in commerce.

10

QUESTION:

And they could have said in that

11

section, don't you think -- do you think it would have

12

been any different if they had said, seamen involved in

13

commerce, as opposed to engaged in commerce?

14

MR. NAGLE:

As Your Honor has recognized, they

15

did not use involved in.

16

supported Mr. Adams' argument that they were trying to

17

show parallel construction. I would submit, Your Honor,

18

that the fact that the Congress could have ended with the

19

phrase, contracts of employment, then we would not be here

20

today if that was their intent, or could have used

21

parallel language, which would have supported respondent's

22

suggestion that they had the same meaning.

23

QUESTION:

That perhaps would have

But isn't the Congress' notion of the

24

limits of its power, doesn't that explain why they didn't

25

say contract of employment, period?
11

1

MR. NAGLE:

I would not, Your Honor, because if

2

section 2 is the coverage provision and Congress was

3

making reference to its Commerce Clause power in coverage,

4

there would certainly be no reason for them to make

5

reference to or be concerned by the limits of their

6

Commerce Clause power in drafting an exclusion from the

7

statute. If they had --

8
9

QUESTION:
explanation?

Well, can you give us a better

I mean, this goes back to Justice O'Connor's

10

question about the oddity of an exclusion which excluded

11

those contracts which were most obviously at the time of

12

drafting within the congressional power, without touching

13

those as to which the power was doubtful, or perhaps

14

absent, and as I understood your answer, your answer was a

15

suggestion that perhaps politics was simply the answer.

16

mean, the one particular political group had asked for it.

17

Can you think of any other reason to draw what

I

18

to me also seems like an odd distinction in the

19

congressional mind?

20

MR. NAGLE:

I would point to Judge Posner's

21

opinion in the Pryner case out of the Seventh Circuit, in

22

which he concluded that the Seventh Circuit concluded in

23

his opinion that this section 1 exclusion should be

24

narrow.

25

union, and the recognition that they were a heavily

He pointed again to the advocacy of the seamen's

12

1

regulated industry that already had a statute in place

2

that provided for an administrative process for resolution

3

of disputes.

4
5

QUESTION:

Then why didn't they just stop with

seamen?

6

MR. NAGLE:

His -- Judge Posner's suggestion is

7

that the railroad industry, the Railway Labor Act was in

8

the works at the time.

9

QUESTION:

10
11

MR. NAGLE:

Okay.
It was also a similarly heavily

regulated --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. NAGLE:

All right.
-- heavily unionized industry, and

14

Judge Posner's opinion goes on that Congress may have

15

anticipated, quite correctly, that motor carriers would

16

also become a heavily regulated industry, and in the --

17
18

QUESTION:

What conclusion do you draw from

that?

19

I'm wondering, under your view, are employees of

20

travel agents covered within the exclusion, or are they

21

covered?

22

MR. NAGLE:

Travel agents, I would -- under our

23

interpretation I do not believe that they would be covered

24

because they're not engaged --

25

QUESTION:

How about ticket agents for
13

1

railroads?

2

MR. NAGLE:

Railroad employees, to the extent

3

that they fall within the definition of employee, for

4

instance, under the Railway Labor Act, I would submit that

5

because railroad employees is a -- or employees is a term

6

under that statute, which includes various employees --

7

QUESTION:

So you draw a distinction between

8

ticket agents who sell them as employees of the railroad

9

and those who sell them as employees of the travel agent?

10

MR. NAGLE:

11

QUESTION:

12
13

I draw a distinction -You think that's what Congress had in

mind?
MR. NAGLE:

I draw the distinction because

14

Congress specifically referred to railroad employees.

15

When we get into travel agents -- and I apologize if you

16

were saying employees of railroads who are travel agents,

17

but I think --

18

QUESTION:

-- railroad employees engaged in

19

foreign or interstate commerce.

20

MR. NAGLE:

21

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
But I take it what you're suggesting,

22

you have to give some content to other class of workers

23

engaged in commerce.

24

engaged in transportation or something?

25

MR. NAGLE:

Don't you suggest that that's

Yes, Your Honor.
14

Certainly, in

1

trying to read the statute --

2

QUESTION:

You see, if we accept your view we

3

have to have a jurisprudence of what transportation is.

4

If we accept the respondent's view, we have to have a

5

jurisprudence on what an employment contract is.

6

require interpretation, but the latter is a statutory

7

term.

8

MR. NAGLE:

Yes, Your Honor.

9

QUESTION:

The former is not.

10

MR. NAGLE:

Both

I would acknowledge that in order to

11

determine the meaning of the final phrase there, any other

12

class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate

13

commerce, that we need to -- that we need primarily to

14

recognize the doctrine of ejusdem generis, and the fact

15

that it does follow after the references to seamen and

16

railroad employees.

17

They are specific groups in a list.

They

18

certainly have something in common, that being that they

19

are transportation workers, and I would also submit that

20

it's inappropriate to read a statute to eliminate the

21

reference to seamen and railroad employees.

22

as respondent contends, it's essentially an exclusion for

23

all contracts of employment of all workers engaged in

24

foreign or interstate commerce, and that's, as Judge

25

Edwards said in the Cole v. Burns Security case -15

If reading it

1

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose their answer is,

2

Congress has already regulated seamen, they're about to

3

regulate railroad employees, so they want to make very

4

sure that those are excluded, and then they go on to the

5

limits of their Commerce power, which were vague at the

6

time, and give everyone else the same protection that

7

seamen and railroad workers have.

8
9

MR. NAGLE:

I simply don't think that that

conforms with the statute.

If we are just reading the

10

exclusion, Congress has -- section 2, the coverage is very

11

broad, using the language to demonstrate the breadth of

12

coverage.

13

chooses to look to the legislative history that Mr. Adams

14

and his amici point to, there's very, very limited

15

legislative history.

16

before a Senate committee in 1923 with three Senators

17

present.

18

The exclusion is very narrow, and if one

QUESTION:

There's essentially one hearing

Well, skipping the legislative

19

history, Mr. Nagle, why is it so narrow?

20

in commerce, and even in 1925 that extended beyond

21

transportation workers.

22

transportation workers, I take it.

23

MR. NAGLE:

It says, engaged

You want the cutoff to be

Your Honor, I'm not aware of cases

24

that in 1925 would have said, engaged in commerce would go

25

beyond transportation workers.
16

I think that involving

1

commerce would -- the section 2 language goes to the

2

breadth of it, but in commerce, this Court, as I

3

mentioned, Illinois Central Railroad case, the Gulf Oil

4

Corporation case, the Bunte Brothers case, in each of

5

those the Court said that in commerce is not the

6

equivalent of affecting commerce.

7

In the Bunte Brothers case the Court said, words

8

derive vitality from the aim and nature of the specific

9

legislation.

10
11

QUESTION:

not included as engaged in commerce?

12

MR. NAGLE:

13

engaged in commerce.

14

So communications workers, those were

QUESTION:

They would not have been included as

You say as of 1925, the only workers

15

engaged in commerce were those who were engaged in the

16

moving of goods, is that --

17

MR. NAGLE:

18

across State lines, Your Honor.

19

QUESTION:

In the movement of people and goods

Well, if that's the case, then I

20

think what we're faced with on your own interpretation is

21

an exclusion which is as complete in relation to the

22

coverage of employees as the inclusion at the beginning of

23

the provision is in relation to commerce in general, and

24

so it seems to me that your argument supports the

25

interpretive theory that Congress was, in fact, in each
17

1

instance, in the coverage and in the exclusion,

2

legislating to the limits, and if the limits change as to

3

the one, we ought to recognize a change in the limits as

4

to the other.

5

MR. NAGLE:

I would disagree, Your Honor, in --

6

with respect to the example that Justice Ginsburg just

7

gave, with respect to telephone, telegraph workers.

8

1877 this Court in the Pensacola Telegraph case had found

9

that telephone telegraph workers affected commerce, were

In

10

involved in commerce, but they were not engaged in

11

commerce in that they were not actually moving goods --

12

certainly we would acknowledge that telephone operators

13

were not moving goods across State lines.

14

QUESTION:

When you are talking about all

15

workers, a lot of water has flowed over the dam or under

16

the bridge since 1925.

17

MR. NAGLE:

18

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
I just would like to focus, you to

19

focus for a minute on the consequences.

20

that's strongest for you is that in all the other circuits

21

but the Ninth, for a long time have limited to

22

transportation workers this exemption.

23

MR. NAGLE:

24

QUESTION:

25

the Ninth Circuit?

One of the things

Certainly, Your Honor.
So what bad would happen if we bought
That is, in thinking about it, I
18

1

thought that the purpose of this act is to stop State

2

court hostility to arbitration.

3

idea?

4

MR. NAGLE:

5

QUESTION:

Isn't that the basic

Yes, Your Honor.
All right.

So if we read workers out

6

of it you still have the NLRB there today, and doesn't the

7

NLRB have the power today to protect any worker, just --

8

you wouldn't need this -- to protect them because the NLRB

9

operating under section 301, or just its general power,

10

could protect all these workers adequately, and therefore

11

there's no reason not to read them out and to invent

12

distinctions between transportation and other kinds of

13

worker.

14

Now, what's your response to that?
MR. NAGLE:

Well, certainly the National Labor

15

Relations Act and the Labor Management Relations Act come

16

into play in the collective bargaining context.

17

QUESTION:

Who wouldn't they have power to

18

protect?

19

become unreasonable in respect to arbitration, i.e., they

20

stop enforcing arbitration agreements with workers,

21

couldn't the NLRB come right in there and say, don't be

22

unreasonable, we want the right rules here, and we'll both

23

get the arbitration and protect the workers?

24
25

Who wouldn't they have power -- if the States

Is there anyone on -- in other words, on the
Ninth Circuit interpretation, that's somehow going to be
19

1

left out in the cold when they want an arbitration

2

agreement?

3

MR. NAGLE:

Your Honor, certainly the Ninth

4

Circuit started its analysis in the Craft case, which was

5

a collective bargaining agreement case --

6

QUESTION:

I mean, I'm interested in a practical

7

fact.

This statute is to stop the hostility of the States

8

to arbitration.

9

arbitration to be left out in the cold, any more than

I wouldn't want workers who wanted

10

anybody else, and then I thought, well, if we accept the

11

Ninth Circuit they're not going to be left out in the

12

cold, because they have the NLRB in there to protect them

13

and, moreover, it will help them somewhat in terms of the

14

purposes because they won't get these agreements shoved in

15

their face and they will be able perhaps to have more

16

freedom to choose.

17

But I'm not -- I'm not expressing a view on

MR. NAGLE:

The consequences, Your Honor, is

24

that arbitration and the Federal policy favoring

25

arbitration, which is designed to reduce litigation, will
20

1

lead to a period of tremendous turmoil while the courts

2

are trying to grapple with the application and enforcement

3

of arbitration agreements.

4

The extent to which they're enforceable under

5

various laws, choice of law provisions, when arbitration

6

agreements contain a governing law provision, the question

7

that I think is very significant, although it's only

8

mentioned in Mr. Adams' brief in footnote 19, the question

9

of arbitrability of Federal employment statutes, if the

10

FAA is taken out of the mix, where this Court relied in

11

part on the liberal Federal policy favoring arbitration in

12

Gilmer and used that to -- as a consideration with respect

13

to enforcement of arbitration agreements, if the FAA is

14

taken out of the mix, I think note 19 in Adams' brief

15

suggests that there's an effort to avoid arbitration of

16

even the Federal claims, and --

17

QUESTION:

Well, even if the FAA doesn't apply

18

to employment contracts, State arbitration rules can --

19

they can be used, can they not?

20

MR. NAGLE:

There are State arbitration rules

21

which vary dramatically from State to State, Your Honor,

22

certainly.

23

because, as this Court has recognized on a number of

24

occasions, one of the great advantages of the broad

25

application of the FAA is providing that substantive law

That I think does not solve the issue,

21

1
2

of arbitrability.
If we are to revert back to the State

3

substantive law of arbitrability, we will have the

4

determinations made on various statutes, we'll have the

5

issues that arise when a contract arbitration agreement is

6

entered into in one State, performed in a third, a claim

7

is brought in a third, we'll have removal to Federal court

8

and a question of which State substantive statute on

9

arbitrability --

10

QUESTION:

Why would you have removal to the

11

Federal court unless you had diversity if it's State law

12

that controls?

13
14
15

MR. NAGLE:

In -- there may be cases where there

is diversity, just a -QUESTION: Well, if these are employment

16

relations, wouldn't most of them be diversity -- most of

17

them be nondiverse, that is, a worker and employer in the

18

same State?

19

MR. NAGLE:

I would disagree, Your Honor.

I

20

think there are many large national corporations that --

21

such as Circuit City which is primarily -- principal place

22

of business is in Virginia, and so to the extent that

23

large companies have employees in many States there may

24

very well be diversity, and then when the matter is

25

removed on diversity grounds there will be the question as
22

1

to which State substantive law of arbitrability would

2

apply.

3
4
5

QUESTION:

Wouldn't it be the place where the

work is performed?
MR. NAGLE:

Well, it may be, Your Honor.

On

6

some occasions this Court has had arbitration agreements

7

such as in Allied-Bruce, where it was essentially one

8

sentence in a termite prevention contract.

9

employers since Gilmer, and in reliance on Gilmer, have

10

developed very sophisticated arbitration programs which

11

include, among other things, governing law provisions, and

12

so you may have a corporation which is based in one State,

13

has a detailed arbitration rules and procedures, as

14

Circuit City does --

15
16
17

QUESTION:

A number of

Nevertheless, it would be State law

that would control, some State law.
MR. NAGLE:

It will be some State law.

One of

18

the issues that the courts will need to determine is when

19

we have a governing law provision such as in the Circuit

20

City agreement, specifying that the Virginia Uniform

21

Arbitration Act would apply, and then the question will

22

arise whether, for instance, California would honor that

23

reference to that State statute.

24
25

I think it's simply an issue that the courts
will have to grapple with for a number of years until
23

1

someone returns here on that issue.

QUESTION:

Mr. Nagle, at the time this -- the

3

exclusion was passed, can you tell me whether it was

4

customary to require each party to bear a portion of the

cost of the arbitration, so was it -- would it have been

customary at that time to require employees to pay part of

the up-front arbitration costs?

MR. NAGLE:

Yes.
It was an administrative machinery

14

that was put in place.

that it would have been customary on that.

Your Honor.

17

QUESTION:

I cannot represent to the Court
I do not know,

Could you tell me just for the

18

record, what are the best cases that you have to establish

19

the proposition that at the time this legislation was

20

enacted it was already well-established that engaged in

21

commerce was not the limit of the Congress' power over

22

interstate commerce?

23

MR. NAGLE:

What are your best cases?
Illinois Central Railroad v.

Behrens, the Shanks v. Delaware, the railroad case.

5

In fact, another point to note on that case is

6

that they noted where it was reenacted in 1950, and that

7

Congress did not change the language, despite the fact

8

that this Court had made clear there was a difference

9

between in commerce and affecting commerce.

The

10

reenactment without change seemed to suggest that Congress

11

had acquiesced in that.

12

I would point out that the Federal Arbitration

13

Act was reenacted in 1949 without change, after the law

14

had become quite clear over that respect.

15

QUESTION:

Have you -- just, I want to be sure

16

you give us your best answer to Justice O'Connor's initial

17

question as to the reason why there's this rather narrow

18

exception from a broad provision.

19

MR. NAGLE:

I would say that while Congress'

20

motives are not always clear, and the very limited

21

legislative history doesn't provide any guidance on that,

22

what we know is that Mr. Furiceff of the Seamen's Union

23

specifically asked that his union be carved out.

24

that seamen and railroad employees were groups that

25

already had by statute an administrative mechanism for

We know

1

resolution of disputes.

2

Pryner and Asplundh Tree both point out that

3

they were heavily regulated, and that there -- I would

4

conclude, if I could, that there is nothing in the

5

legislative history to suggest that Congress was

6

contemplating the scope of its authority when it crafted

7

the words in section 1.

MR. RUBIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
We agree with petitioner in response to the

16

question from Justice Scalia that the focus of the Court's

17

inquiry today has to be on what Congress meant in 1925,

18

whether it intended the section 1 exclusion to go -- to

19

remain symmetrical with the section 2 coverage.

QUESTION:

MR. RUBIN:

'25.
Secretary Hoover, just 2 weeks after

11

the seamen's union expressed concerns not only about its

12

application to seamen, but according to Mr. Furiceff to

13

seamen, railroad men and sundry other workers in

14

interstate and foreign commerce, wrote a letter to the

15

chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee in which he said,

16

if there appear to be objections to the inclusion of

17

workers' contracts, then he proposes that the following

18

language be used.

19

The language that he proposed is the identical

if it was not going to end the sentence there, at least

use the same language in section 1 that it did in section

it.

While Congress could have limited that

QUESTION:

I gather he failed, since he sent the

letter in 1923 and the bill was passed in 1925.

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. RUBIN:

He did -- he was successful in

20

getting the language that he proposed included in the bill

21

immediately after he proposed it, but why is the

22

additional language in there, what purpose does it serve,

23

because that, I think, is the response to the Chief

24

Justice's question.

25

Well, we start with the first two phrases, the
28

1

first two classes, seamen, and railroad employees.

2

in 1925, given how limited Congress' Commerce Clause power

3

was, there weren't that many categories of workers who

4

were actually covered by Congress. In fact, the only

5

private sector employees that were covered by any Federal

6

statute under the Commerce Clause power in 1925 were

7

seamen and railroad employees, so not only was --

8
9
10
11

QUESTION:

Now,

They were covered by the Commerce

Clause power, or by any Federal statutes?
MR. RUBIN:

I'm sorry.

They were covered by

Federal statutes.

MR. RUBIN:

QUESTION:

15

MR. RUBIN:

By Federal statutes.
Excuse me if I misspoke.
No, I -Then -- then, because the objection

16

from labor, which Secretary Hoover at least urged Congress

17

to overcome, however quickly or not it might have

18

happened, referred more broadly to all classes of

19

employees, because the underlying concern was the

20

disparity in bargaining power, as this Court acknowledged

21

in Prima Paint in its footnote 9, when it referred to the

22

section 1 exclusion, because the disparity in bargaining

23

power applies between all workers and bosses as perceived

24

by labor at the time, and as reflected by Congress in 1932

25

in the Norris La Guardia Act.
29

Congress went beyond that.

Your position is simply covering the

MR. RUBIN:

Just like FELA at the time, we

11

believe, would have covered an on-the-job injury by a high

executive of a railroad company, it is our construction

that worker and employee means anyone employed by a

company.

There was not.

We have cited

numerous statutes, as well as cases of the time.

6

not a single statute in effect in 1925 or a case

7

describing the commerce power as it pertained to employees

8

that used a broader term than engaged in.

9
10

QUESTION:

There is

What about the case cited by opposing

counsel, Behrens.

11

MR. RUBIN:

Behrens and Shanks.

The Behrens and

12

Shanks case arose under the amended FELA, the 1908 version

13

of FELA.

14

then on two separate occasions had what we characterize as

15

a temporal limitation.

That act referred initially to engaged in, but

It said, while engaged in.

16

It specifically limited the scope to less than

17

the full commerce power, as would have been expressed by

18

the term, engaged in, and in Shanks and in Behrens, and in

19

several other cases, this Court expressly noted that

20

whether workers were covered by the amended FELA or not,

21

turned upon whether the injury they suffered occurred

22

while they were engaged in.

23

It didn't focus on the type of work they

24

generally performed.

It -- for instance, in Behrens, I

25

believe, the worker was working on an interstate -31

1

intrastate traffic.

His job often included interstate

2

traffic.

3

the time he was hit by the locomotive he was engaged in

4

solely intrastate work, the Court said that, given the

5

temporal limitation of FELA, it doesn't apply.

6

So those cases support our position.

He would be engaged in commerce, but because at

Shanks in

7

particular supports our position because Shanks goes to --

8

the FELA law was very complicated.

cases coming before this Court trying to decide who is and

There were many, many

10

who is not covered by the various limitations.

11

goes through and summarizes the Supreme Court

12

jurisprudence of the time under FELA and makes very clear

13

that engaged in is as broad as it gets, because it

14

includes not just those narrowly working on the trains as

15

they were going down the tracks, but everyone whose job is

16

sufficiently related as to be practically a part of the

17

interstate commerce.

18

Shanks

So at the time, in 1925, engaged in was a term

19

of art.

It was a term of art that reached to the full

20

scope of Congress' commerce power.

the answer as to -- actually, it doesn't quite complete

That may well be, but -A --- that's terrible drafting.
The -I mean, Congress is supposed to come

16

up with a coherent bill, and we usually assume it was all

17

drafted at the same time and somebody sat down and used

18

the same words to mean the same things throughout the

19

statute, and we usually assume that when they use

20

different words they mean different things.

21

MR. RUBIN:

There is a reason why the locutions

22

in section 2 are different from those in section 1, and

23

that is because the language in section 2, the coverage

24

provision refers to -- and it's an odd locution, one that

25

we've certainly not seen in other statutes -- contract
33

1

evidencing a transaction involving commerce.

2

The word engaged, had engaged come first, would

3

not have fit in that phrase, because there can't be a

4

contract evidencing a transaction engaged in commerce,

5

because a transaction cannot engage in commerce.

6

By the same token, in the section 1 exclusion it

7

would have made no sense to use the word, involving,

those who were objecting, because it used the exact

22

language that they proposed.

exactly that, any other.

5

That's as broad as it gets.

That is language without limitation, and instead

6

of saying, any other class of workers in transportation,

7

which is essentially what petitioner's argument would have

8

the Court read section 1 to mean, commerce was a defined

QUESTION:

Mr. Rubin, there's also the phrase,

20

that you consider workers to include any employee, even

21

managerial employees.

contracts?

23

fall within the section 1 exclusion?

24
25

You were candid in telling us

What about collective bargaining

MR. RUBIN:

Yes, and in fact the majority of the

circuits agree with the proposition that collective

bargaining agreements are excluded.

2

totalled up, I think 5 to 3, but yes, collective

3

bargaining agreements --

4

QUESTION:

Various amici have

How was that consistent with -- we're

5

told that the Ninth Circuit is the only one that holds

6

that all employment contracts are out under section 1,

7

but --

8
9

MR. RUBIN:

I believe the more accurate

statement would be that those circuits that focused solely

10

on individual employment contracts drew that distinction,

11

because in fact, going back to 20, 25 years, the majority

12

of the circuits have said the collective bargaining

13

agreements are excluded.

14

The practical effect is minimal, because the

15

Labor Management Relations Act, Section 301, as this Court

16

clearly held in Lincoln Mills v. Textile Workers, does

17

ensure the Federal common law of arbitrability for

18

collective bargaining agreements.

QUESTION:

What was the reasoning in the

20

circuits for saying that collective bargaining contracts

21

are excluded?

22

employment?

23

Is it that they were not contracts of

MR. RUBIN:

No, no, no.

It's precisely the

24

opposite, because they were contracts of employment of any

25

other class of workers.
36

QUESTION:

And some of the examples involve

2

collective bargaining agreements outside of the

3

transportation industry.

4

MR. RUBIN:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes.

But why wouldn't those courts have

6

said that the National Labor Relations Act is just a

7

superseding statute?

8

MR. RUBIN:

9

The National -- the -- section 301

of the LMRA is a different statute.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. RUBIN:

Or, LMRA, yes.
Is a -- well, this Court in Lincoln

12

Mills was faced with a choice as to whether, in deciding

13

to hold collective bargaining agreement arbitration

14

provisions enforceable, it should do so under the FAA, as

15

the lower court had held, by the way, in the Fifth Circuit

16

in Lincoln Mills, or whether to hold it enforceable under

17

section 301, which was enacted in 1947.

18

The Court chose section 301.

The Court made no

19

reference whatsoever in its opinion to the FAA, and that's

20

where Justice Frankfurter in his dissent first laid out

21

the argument that we're following up on in our briefs to

22

say that the FAA is inapplicable for this --

23

QUESTION:

Why doesn't the 301 reasoning explain

24

what the circuits have done and say, well, these are just

25

controlled by another statute?
37

1

MR. RUBIN:

The circuits who have drawn that

2

distinction have not relied on 301.

3

arise in the question of which statute of limitations

4

applies, whether you borrow the Federal Arbitration Act

5

statute of limitations or not, but that hasn't been the

6

distinguishing characteristic and, of course, this case

7

not being a collective bargaining agreement, certainly

8

LMRA section 301 does not apply to this case.

9

QUESTION:

Sometimes the cases

Is it true that all the other

10

circuits but the Ninth have restricted this to

11

transportation workers?

12
13

MR. RUBIN:

No.

Some have, as we pointed out,

restricted it to employees of common carriers.

14

QUESTION:

Well, all right, but I mean,

15

restricted it, then it can't be that there are a lot of

16

circuits that have held that collective bargaining

17

agreements are excluded as a contract of other workers.

As far as I understand it, when I'm

10

hostility to arbitration in the States, and I also think

11

that there are a lot of unfair arbitration agreements, but

12

there are even more that are fair and many of them help

13

the average worker, maybe not your client.

14

All right.

Given that background, who's going

15

to be left out in the cold?

16

such that if we accept the Ninth Circuit they will

17

suddenly not be able to get arbitration agreements that

18

might help them because of State hostility or complex

19

State rules, et cetera?

20

MR. RUBIN:

21

QUESTION:

22

Are there a class of workers

No.
Can the NLRA, NLRB take jurisdiction

over such a class?

MR. RUBIN:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. RUBIN:

There -Is there a problem?
There are several levels of
39

1

responses, but I think to address what I understand your

2

concern to be, workers and employers can always enter into

3

voluntary arbitration agreements.

4

between themselves after a dispute arises, for example,

5

that they choose to pursue an arbitration mechanism rather

6

than to go into court.

They can always decide

7

If they agree to arbitrate, there is no problem.

8

It's not like the old common law hostility to arbitration.

9

There's no question that it would be enforceable.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

Your response is, then, look, they

can still agree, just not in the employment contract.
MR. RUBIN:

They -- in a few -- the ultimate

13

issue here is whether States can determine whether the

14

employment relationships in those States, whether an

15

arbitration agreement is enforceable or not.

MR. RUBIN:

Well, you're going to be -In those -You're going to be arbitrating under

MR. RUBIN:

Yes.

It's either the State law or

the Federal law that will apply in this case determines

whether --

QUESTION:

Mr. Rubin, your argument assumes that

6

giving a broader modern meaning to section 2 and giving a

7

broader modern meaning to section 1 are one and the same

8

things.

9

I really don't think that that's what's going on

10

here.

11

change the language of section 1 in light of the fact that

12

we now know that Congress could have gone further than it

13

chose to go in that language.

14

where we've done that.

15

I mean, what you're really asking us to do is to

I don't know any other case

You're not asking us to simply give that

16

language its modern, more expansive meaning.

You're

17

asking us to say, you know, in light of the fact that we

18

now know that it's not just employees engaged in

19

interstate commerce who can be covered.

20

known that then, they would have written a different

21

provision and so, Supreme Court, why don't you rewrite it

22

for Congress, because they surely would have put it this

23

way if they had known then what we know now.

24

any case where we've done that?

25

MR. RUBIN:

Had Congress

Do you know

I'm not asking you to rewrite the
41

1

language, Justice Scalia.

2

Congress in 1925 saw a symmetry, saw an objection,

3

responded to it by making sure that any worker that might

4

be -- if there were any worker out there whose contract of

5

employment evidenced a transaction involving commerce,

6

they would be taken out of the act completely.

7

QUESTION:

I'm asking you to accept that

You're saying they saw a symmetry

8

which now no longer exists because we've given the first

9

part a much broader meaning, and now this other part,

10

which they once thought was symmetrical, is no longer

11

symmetrical, so now we should read it to mean something

12

more --

MR. RUBIN:

QUESTION:

To --- than a class of workers engaged in

15

foreign or interstate commerce.

16

MR. RUBIN:

To get back to the very first

17

question you asked petitioner's counsel, what did Congress

18

mean by the language used in 1925.

19

never been used before in a commerce relationship and has

20

never been used since, could not have meant anything more

21

than engaged in, because engaged in was as far as it got.

22

Involving, which had

So to the extent there has been a rewriting --

23

and I'm not contending there's been a rewriting.

24

contending there's been an application under the modern

25

interpretation of the Commerce Clause.
42

I'm

As this Court in

Terminex said, you have to look to see what Congress is

trying to achieve.

QUESTION:

What were the purposes?

And when the

5

reason of future changes, future changes in the law, or

6

future changes in circumstances.

7

do is, in light of future changes in the law, make this

8

statute read the way Congress thought it was going to

9

operate when it was enacted, but we don't usually do that.

What you're asking us to

10

If, in fact, engaged in interstate commerce is something

11

narrower and is no longer symmetrical, tough luck.

12

Congress can amend it.

13

it in order to preserve symmetry.

QUESTION:

rewritten section 2.

16

MR. RUBIN:

But we don't go around rewriting

Maybe your answer is, we've already

In fact, in Terminex in 1925,

17

that -- that's what happened.

18

maintained that symmetry, maintained that symmetry for

19

purposes that were stated that are in the record.

20

is no indication of any reason why Congress would have

21

disrupted that symmetry, what purposes could be served,

22

how it could be --

QUESTION:

The language in 1925

But it isn't symmetry.

There

I mean,

there's different language used in the two sections.
MR. RUBIN:

It's symmetry, Your Honor, in the
43

1

sense that because some felt that the coverage language

2

might encompass workers' contracts of employment,

3

Congress, to the fullest extent it could, pulled those

4

workers out.

5

7

QUESTION:

That's a very odd definition of

symmetry.
MR. RUBIN:

Symmetry may not be the right word.

8

The concept is the word that I'm trying to convey to the

9

Court, and the concept is the concept of ensuring that no

10

contracts of employment that might be covered under

11

Congress' commerce power would be covered.

12

should not be read dynamically, as this Court did in

13

Terminex, while the other is read statically.

Congress didn't use the word, transportation.

It had enacted numerous statutes by 1925 that had limited

17

the scope to transportation, or to common carriers, or to

18

common carriers by railroad.

19

available to it had it intended the carve-out, but there

20

is no gap between the section 2 coverage and the section 1

21

exclusion and, therefore, just as in 1925, all workers'

22

contracts of employment were excluded, any other class of

23

workers, the broadest possible language, so, too, we urge

24

the Court to construe the statute that way now.

It had that language readily

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID E. NAGLE

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. NAGLE:

Thank you.

Very briefly, first,

8

with respect to the particular questions that have arisen

9

regarding our citation of Behrens, I would ask the Court

10

to look at the sections on pages 7 and 8 of our reply

11

brief, where we specifically tried to address that the

12

1925 Congress that had used the words, engaging in

13

interstate commerce, that -- I'm sorry, with respect to

14

Behrens, had indicated that that applied only to employees

15

who were actually engaged in interstate transportation or

16

closely related functions, and not to other employees that

17

Congress had the constitutional authority to regulate.

18
19
20

QUESTION:
mind.

You cite Behrens -- you cite -- never

Go ahead.
MR. NAGLE:

Yes, Your Honor.

With respect to

21

the questions on section 301 of the Labor Management

22

Relations Act, that, of course, affects those in the

23

unionized context.

24

pointed out, that this would lead to the anomalous result

25

that a CEO of a multinational corporation who has an

I would note, as Justice Scalia had

45

1

arbitration provision in his or her employment contract,

2

that it would not be enforceable pursuant to the FAA.

3

I would note that in Prima Paint, at note 7, the

4

Court made reference -- albeit it in dicta the Court made

5

reference to certain kinds of employment contracts being

6

excluded under section 1, which is consistent with our

7

view that it was not intended to cover the entire range of

8

that which was covered.

9

Ultimately, I would suggest that as the court of

10

appeals have consistently held, the narrow reading of

11

section 1 is the only reason which is based on and

12

consistent with the text, that makes use of the full text

13

and conforms with the principles of statutory

14

construction, so that we don't read words to be

15

meaningless and that we do apply the canon of ejusdem

16

generis.

17

As this Court noted in Allied-Bruce, and

18

particularly in Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion

19

there, there's value in uniformity and stability of the

20

case law which has developed.

21

of agreements to arbitrate employment claims have been

22

entered into in reliance, and I would suggest that

23

Congress is certainly well aware of this case law

24

development, has had the opportunity to correct it if they

25

thought the Court had gotten it wrong, and they have
