ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. KILBERG

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. KILBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Washington State's divorce revocation law

12

strikes at the very heart of ERISA's comprehensive

13

regulatory scheme for employee benefit plans.

14

by purporting to revoke ERISA plan beneficiary

15

designations upon divorce.

16

It does so

We submit that the Washington statute is

17

preempted by ERISA on two independent grounds.

18

because it relates to an ERISA plan within the meaning of

19

ERISA's express preemption provision, section 514(a) and

20

second, because it conflicts with ERISA's other

21

provisions.

22

First,

Turning first to section 514, this Court has

23

made clear that a State law relates to an employee benefit

24

plan if it mandates employee benefit structures or their

25

administration or binds plan administrators to particular
3

1

choices.

Washington's divorce revocation statute has

2

precisely that forbidden effect.

3

As applied by the courts below, the statute

4

invalidates the beneficiary determination and benefit

5

payment scheme provided for by the terms of the ERISA

6

plans here and instead mandates payment according to a

7

different State-imposed scheme.

8

determination of beneficiary status, and the payment of

9

plan benefits, lie at the very heart of ERISA's concerns.

10

Moreover, the

Indeed, the determination whether particular

11

alleged beneficiaries are entitled to obtain plan benefits

12

is so crucial to the entire Federal scheme created by

13

ERISA that such benefits claims are deemed to arise under

14

Federal law under this Court's decision in Metropolitan

15

Life v. Taylor even if they purport to raise only State

16

law claims.

17

QUESTION:

Of course, what you say applies

18

exactly similarly, I take it, to a State statute that

19

would say, if A murders B, A shall be treated as having

20

predeceased B for purposes of inheriting from B, or in a

21

word, A can't inherit from B.

22

apply to that similarly, so what's the difference?

23

MR. KILBERG:

24

would be preempted.

25

QUESTION:

All that you've said would

If that were a State law, then it

In other words, you're saying that
4

1

basically this ERISA preempts all of what you call the

2

slayer statutes, I guess, that traditionally have said you

3

can't inherit from a person you murder.

4

MR. KILBERG:

It preempts the slayer statutes.

5

However, the slayer rule may very well be incorporated

6

into ERISA, because the slayer rule was extant at the time

7

of ERISA's passage in 1974, was a common law rule, and had

8

been applied in numerous cases, Federal cases with regard

9

to a death benefit statute, so it was a gloss on the law.

10

QUESTION:

All right.

So does it also

11

incorporate statutes where people die simultaneously?

12

There are a complicated set of State rules as to how you

13

treat what assets for purposes of inheritance.

14

MR. KILBERG:

15

death, a simultaneous death rule.

16

QUESTION:

It may encompass simultaneous

All right, so if it -- now we have it

17

interpreting a considerable area of State probate law.

18

there any reason why Congress would have wanted ERISA to

19

preempt a traditionally State-regulated subject like

20

probate and -- you know, at least where it doesn't

21

interfere with some important policy, or -- I don't know.

22

I mean, you see the -- that's what I want you to address.

23

MR. KILBERG:

24

Justice Breyer.

25

those laws.

Is

I can imagine where you're headed,

Yes, the answer, of course it preempts

There's no reason to believe that it doesn't.
5

1

We're talking about employee benefit plans.

2

nothing more central to an employee benefit plan than

3

benefits, how it pays them, to whom it pays them, and

4

ERISA has specific provisions with regard to the exception

5

for State law with -- in the context of the payment

6

employee benefit plans in a divorce situation.

7

QUESTION:

There's

I'm not sure about you -- how you

8

distinguish the slayer statute.

You say it's been around,

9

it's part of the common law, it's part of the background.

10

Why -- suppose the case we have here has been around a

11

long time.

12

MR. KILBERG:

Well, the difference, Justice

13

Kennedy, is that the slayer -- the slayer rule was part of

14

the common law, was part of the common law of trust at the

15

time that ERISA was enacted, and it may be presumed that

16

the Congress, seeing that as a backdrop, incorporated,

17

impliedly incorporated the slayer rule into ERISA.

18
19

QUESTION:

But not simultaneous death statutes,

because they vary from State to State, or --

20

MR. KILBERG:

Well, I'm not sure about

21

simultaneous death statutes, quite frankly.

They may,

22

too, have been incorporated, but with regard to a divorce

23

revocation rule, that was not the state of the common law

24

in 1974.

25

few States, fewer than a third of the States have any sort

Indeed, it's not the state of the law now.

6

Very

1

of divorce revocation rule.

2

developed --

3

QUESTION:

Only 10 States have

May I just -- is your point that it

4

was the law before ERISA was passed, or that it's part of

5

the common law.

6

MR. KILBERG:

7

QUESTION:

That's correct.

I mean, which is true?

In other

8

words, supposing this statute had been passed before

9

ERISA.

10

Would that make a difference?
MR. KILBERG:

No, not the statute.

If -- if the

11

divorce revocation rule had been commonly accepted in the

12

common law at the time ERISA was passed and had been used

13

as a gloss --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. KILBERG:

16

QUESTION:

17

So your point is that --- on similar Federal statutes --

Your point is, the other was a common

law rule, not the timing.

The timing is --

18

MR. KILBERG:

19

both, Justice Stevens.

20

and it was a common law rule at the time of ERISA's

21

passage in 1974.

22

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Well, it's really

It is that it is a common law rule

Yes, but you've said that if there

23

had been a statute which is in effect that wouldn't have

24

done the trick.

25

MR. KILBERG:

That's correct.
7

1

QUESTION:

Well, when you say a common law rule,

2

we're dealing with a country with 50 different States.

3

mean, don't you think the law might have been different in

4

some of those States?

5

MR. KILBERG:

I

Not with regard to the slayer

6

rule, in fact, and indeed what is important here is that

7

the slayer rule had been applied in Federal cases as a

8

gloss to death benefit statutes, and so one can assume

9

that the Congress, or one can rule that the Congress had

10

impliedly incorporated that common law rule into ERISA.

11

QUESTION:

Even in the face of a provision in

12

ERISA that says benefits have to be paid to the named

13

beneficiary?

14

MR. KILBERG:

With regard to the slayer rule, if

15

it had been incorporated into ERISA, then it would be

16

incorporated as an implied exception.

17

QUESTION:

What is the mechanics of the working

18

of a plan?

19

beneficiary, and the insurance company or whoever goes and

20

pays -- goes on and pays out to the beneficiary.

21

the beneficiary killed someone and he's disqualified from

22

inheriting.

23

insurance company responsible for that sort of an error?

24
25

Supposing that you have a designated

In fact,

If he's still the named beneficiary, is the

MR. KILBERG:

Yes, they would be responsible

under those circumstances.

The plan administrator has to
8

1

make a decision as to whether a benefit is to be paid out.

2

The plan administrator does so by looking both to ERISA

3

and to the terms of the plan.

4

QUESTION:

Well, does he have to look into a

5

whole bunch of factual matters like, you know, whether

6

this beneficiary might be disqualified by some State,

7

State statute like the slayer's --

8
9

MR. KILBERG:
State law.

No.

No.

He would not look at

He would not have to look at State rules

10

unless, not finding the answer in his plan, and not

11

finding the answer in ERISA he may choose to look to State

12

law, but --

13

QUESTION:

It seems to me that would be a much

14

narrower ground for ruling in your favor here, rather than

15

these general assertions about the incorporation in the

16

common law, that perhaps if a State statute actually

17

directly affects the designation of a beneficiary, the way

18

the Washington statute does, it may be different than the

19

slayer statute.

20

MR. KILBERG:

But we believe that State law, Mr.

21

Chief Justice, that a State law like this, which is

22

essentially a rule of decision for employee benefit plan,

23

is preempted both as a matter of express preemption and as

24

a matter of conflict preemption under ERISA.

25

QUESTION:

But you agree that your argument is
9

1

stronger -- let's assume that the statute does not

2

incorporate slayer statutes, or simultaneous death

3

statutes --

4

MR. KILBERG:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- or simultaneous death rules.

6

Would you agree that your argument is much stronger than

7

if you rely on conflict preemption than if you rely on

8

statutory relating-to preemption?

9

MR. KILBERG:

10

QUESTION:

I believe it's equally strong.

Well, if it's a flat conflict

11

preemption, it seems to me relatively easy for us to say,

12

look, the statute says, beneficiaries or plans designate

13

the --

14

MR. KILBERG:

15

QUESTION:

16

beneficiaries.

Participants.

-- participants or plans designate

This says they don't.

Clear conflict.

17

But if you get to relating-to preemption, which

18

we do not find it easy to understand, then it seems to me

19

the force of the argument for anomalous results which my

20

colleagues were making is simply a stronger argument,

21

because the concept of preemption is a comparatively

22

weaker concept.

23

MR. KILBERG:

Well, obviously, we believe that

24

there is both conflict preemption and express preemption

25

here, and the Court can certainly, as it did in Boggs, not
10

1

reach the question of express preemption and go off on

2

conflict preemption, but --

3

QUESTION:

Well, except your -- I think the

4

point being made is that your preemption is stronger if

5

you're willing to swallow the bitter pill of not including

6

the slayer statutes, but once you say the slayer statutes

7

don't pose any conflict, it's hard to see why they pose

8

any more of a conflict than -- or, excuse me, any less of

9

a conflict than the statute here.

10

MR. KILBERG:

In Ridgeway v. Ridgeway, which was

11

a decision of this Court involving the Servicemen's Group

12

Life Insurance Act, the Court noted the slayer rule and

13

determined that it did not have to deal with it in the

14

context of that case and that it was an extreme example.

15

The Court certainly is free to do the same in this context

16

and that, I believe, was also an express preemption.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Kilberg --

18

QUESTION:

But is -- is the answer that you gave

19

in talking about the administrative burden -- my

20

understanding, and correct me if I'm not right, that this

21

statute says that if a trustee of a plan doesn't know

22

about this problem, he doesn't have to pay, and if he does

23

know about the problem, he doesn't have to pay until the

24

State courts resolve it, and if that isn't good enough, he

25

can opt out of the whole thing just by putting a sentence
11

1
2

in the plan that says, I opt out, in effect.
So where is the administrative burden, and is it

3

the same -- they also say there are 47 other States that

4

have similar statutes, and so I'm trying to get an idea

5

for what this administrative burden is.

6

MR. KILBERG:

Oh, indeed, as we point out in our

7

brief, I believe it's at footnote 8 on page 20 of

8

petitioner's brief.

9

QUESTION:

10

Yes.

MR. KILBERG:

It's also described in amicus

11

briefs for the National Coordinating Committee and in the

12

Western Conference of Teamsters.

13

vary dramatically.

14

revocation rule at all.

15

In fact, the State rules

Most States do not have a divorce

Most States, more than two-thirds of the States,

16

the rule is simply that you go with the main beneficiary.

17

It is in a handful of States that you have divorce

18

revocation rules, and they vary among themselves, so there

19

is that burden that plaintiffs would have to deal with.

20

Moreover, the opt-out provision that you're

21

referring to in this State law merely adds another layer

22

of complexity.

23

yet another State standard, so at the end of the day --

Now, in order to opt out you have to meet

24

QUESTION:

Which is?

25

MR. KILBERG:

Well, which is that you have to
12

1

specifically opt out, and you have to opt out in the

2

manner in which the State tells you you have to opt out.

3
4

QUESTION:

And you may not know which State is

the State that will govern.

5

MR. KILBERG:

6

QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.

But before we get into that, I'm

7

still a little confused on the nature of the common law

8

that we're talking about.

9

Mr. Kilberg, you are not talking about the common law of

10

As I understand you,

California or Massachusetts or anything.

11

MR. KILBERG:

12

QUESTION:

That's correct.

You're talking -- and you're not

13

talking about the pre-Erie general common law, either.

14

You're talking about what Judge Friendly called, in praise

15

of Erie and the new Federal common law.

16

common law that fills in the interstices of Federal

17

statute, so you would not be incorporating any particular

18

State's slayer rule.

19

MR. KILBERG:

20

QUESTION:

21

That is, Federal

That's correct.

But it would be a Federal, a true

Federal common law rule.

22

MR. KILBERG:

23

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And that with all Federal statutes,

24

or most Federal statutes, there will be a penumbral area,

25

and what would fill that in would not be the law of any
13

1

particular -- common law of any particular State, but

2

Federal common law.

3

MR. KILBERG:

That's correct.

I'm talking about

4

the common law of trusts, Federal common law, which in

5

prior decisions of this Court has been understood to apply

6

to ERISA but, more importantly, or as importantly --

7

QUESTION:

I mean, if there is such a Federal

8

common law I suppose we could invent a -- you know, the

9

same spousal substitution rule that the State has done by

10

statute here.

I mean, if there is -- if we have that

11

common law power to say, fill in the interstices in

12

statutes --

13

MR. KILBERG:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. KILBERG:

I'm afraid not, Justice Scalia.

No?
I was moving on from Justice

16

Ginsburg's question to distinguish between Federal common

17

law which is incorporated into a statute, because it is

18

the common law against which the Congress legislates,

19

which is what I would be referring to with regard to the

20

slayer rule, and that would be the common law in extant in

21

1974 that had been applied in other Federal cases to other

22

Federal death benefit statutes.

23

There is also a notion that if a statute does

24

not answer a question, if there are interstices that the

25

Court -- a court may apply a Federal common law rule, but
14

1

that's not the case here.

Here, ERISA speaks specifically

2

to the issue at hand, and I believe --

3

QUESTION:

4

in the case, whether it does.

5

Well, of course, that's the question

But suppose there's an ambiguity in the

6

designation, that there's a State rule of law that would

7

resolve, would the trust look to the State rule of law or

8

would it look to some Federal common law rule about

9

ambiguities.

For example, say the beneficiary named my

10

son Joseph, and it turns out that the -- that he has -- he

11

gave the middle name Joseph to four different sons, and

12

how would you go about resolving that?

13

a State rule or a Federal rule?

14

MR. KILBERG:

Would you look to

It looked -- it would be the plan

15

administrator's choice.

16

State law, and the plan administrator would look to see if

17

there were any guidance in the plan, in Federal common

18

law, and then the plan --

19

QUESTION:

It would not be a decision under

He would confine his inquiry entirely

20

to the terms of the plan itself?

21

MR. KILBERG:

He -- no.

He may -- in making a

22

decision he may, of course, look to State law if he

23

chooses.

24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Kilberg, the Washington supreme

court seems to have analyzed the decedent's life insurance
15

1

policy separately from the pension plan in doing the

2

preemption analysis.

3

plans separately, or do we apply the same analysis to both

4

of them?

5

Do we have to consider those two

MR. KILBERG:

I believe we can apply -- the

6

Court can apply the same analysis for both of them with

7

one exception.

8

conflict with ERISA's antialienation provision.

9

provision, which is found in section 206 of the statute,

One of our arguments is that there is a
That

10

applies only to pension plans, but all of our other

11

arguments would apply to both welfare and pension plans.

12

If the Court has no further questions, I would

13

like to reserve the remainder --

14

QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Kilberg.

15

Ms. McDowell, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL

17

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

18

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

19
20
21

MS. McDOWELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Washington statute relates to employee

22

benefit plans within the meaning of ERISA's express

23

preemption provision and also conflicts with several

24

specific provisions with ERISA.

25

viewed as a matter of express preemption, conflict
16

Accordingly, whether

1

preemption, or appeal preemption, the Washington statute

2

in its application to ERISA plans is preempted.

3

QUESTION:

Suppose, Ms. McDowell, you have a

4

trustee under an ERISA plan who has a designated

5

beneficiary and so forth and perhaps, you know, ambiguity

6

as suggested by Justice -- something else -- and then you

7

have simply a trust company that has exactly the same

8

provisions but it's not an ERISA plan.

9

their duties different?

10

Are -- does -- are

Say when you come to an

ambiguity -- you're both sitting in Seattle.

11

MS. McDOWELL:

As a practical matter, they may

12

do essentially the same thing interpreting the terms of

13

the plan, or whatever instrument governs it.

14

question is what happens after the plan makes the decision

15

in the ERISA context.

16

and an action under ERISA section 502(a).

17

action the Federal court would apply common law.

18

QUESTION:

The key

That decision is subject to review
In that sort of

So -- but would the Federal common

19

law likely be different from the State of Washington's

20

law, or is it just up for grabs, kind of?

21

MS. McDOWELL:

In many instances the appropriate

22

rule would presumably be for the plan administrator of the

23

ERISA plan to look to State law for guidance, for example,

24

in determining who was a spouse, who was a child, et

25

cetera.

It would only make sense for the ERISA plan to
17

1

essentially require looking to the relevant State law that

2

creates the relationship.

3

the State law is one that conflicts with the provisions of

4

an ERISA plan such as the one here, which --

5

QUESTION:

That's not so, however, where

May I ask two questions?

First, do

6

you agree that the State law here is a law of general

7

applicability?

8

MS. McDOWELL:

9

insurance, but it's more general.

10

QUESTION:

Yes, it is.

It refers to

My second question is, in weighing

11

the various interests at stake here, should we give any

12

weight at all to the interests in carrying out the wishes

13

of the former employee who -- whose assets are being

14

distributed?

15

MS. McDOWELL:

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. McDOWELL:

18
19

his wishes.

No, we shouldn't

We shouldn't.
In the first place, we don't know

In the second place --

QUESTION:

Well, we know he presumably was

20

advised by a lawyer, who was a State lawyer who told him

21

what the State rule of law was, and presumably he was told

22

he could rely on the fact that he didn't have to change

23

his designation for his sons to get the property.

24

that the normal thing you would expect a divorce lawyer in

25

that State to tell him?
18

Isn't

1

MS. McDOWELL:

This individual in fact was not

2

represented.

3

that a participant in an ERISA plan would look at a

4

variety of sources, most specifically including his

5

summary plan description, which in this case made quite

6

clear that the only way to change a beneficiary is to file

7

the required form, that such documents as divorce decrees

8

would not --

9

It was a pro se divorce.

QUESTION:

One would assume

Of course, unless as a matter of law,

10

there is a rule of law that automatically changed the --

11

such as the slayer rule.

12

reasonable probability here that the plan participant

13

thought the money would not go to his divorced wife?

14

What about ordinary common sense,

that a person who just divorces his wife, gives her half

10

the property, might prefer that the other half of the

11

property go to his children, rather than this wife, who's

12

now going to get more than her fair share, and whom he's

13

just divorced?

14

I mean, suppose I thought the common sense of it

15

in my knowledge of human nature is that people would

16

prefer their half share to go to their children rather

17

than the just-divorced wife.

18
19
20

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, that's a sensible approach,

and ERISA plans could adopt that approach -QUESTION:

And is there some reason -- all

21

right, is there any -- so then is there any reason to

22

think that Congress wouldn't have wanted State statutes

that don't interfere that much with anything and in fact

embody that common sense notion, like you wouldn't like

25

your property to go to the guy who kills you.
20

You know,

1

that's another common sense notion.

QUESTION:

Ms. McDowell, that common sense

approach is disagreed with by two-thirds of the States, as

4

I understand it, right?

5

think that that's common sense and don't provide for

automatic substitution in the event of a divorce.

QUESTION:

And I assume that any -- that once

you have a statute like ERISA, which avowedly supersedes

State law, if you're dealing with a lawyer who doesn't

(Laughter.)

23

QUESTION:

Mine

I wasn't just making a comment.

I wanted you to respond to the notion

24

that State statutes, probate -- you know, that traditional

25

State area that embody that kind of a notion, what I'd
21

1

call a notion of trying to carry out the wishes of the

2

testator, or whoever, that those are not preempted unless

3

they impose a real burden upon the ERISA plan.

4

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, you began your question

5

with a reference to what Congress would have intended

6

here, and we do know that Congress intended to permit the

7

nationally uniform administration of ERISA plans.

8

why it included an express preemption provision.

9

QUESTION:

That's

Ms. McDowell, I would like to go back

10

to your prior concession, or maybe I shouldn't use the

11

word concession, but is it not within the realm of the

12

possible that a man who has just divorced a woman, he's

13

tired of her, he's used her up, he's thrown her over, he's

14

off with a young thing but not married, and he's feeling

15

tremendous remorse, so he says, I'm going to leave that

16

pension plan alone.

17

(Laughter.)

18

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, that's true, and perhaps

19

the more common situation is where the divorced spouse has

20

custody of the couple's children.

21

probably be a matter of relative indifference to the plan

22

participant whether the money went to the spouse directly

23

or the children, or --

25

QUESTION:

In that case, it would

(Laughter.)

2

QUESTION:

-- divorced husband, isn't it more

3

likely that the wife, in striking her deal for the divorce

4

settlement, having an ERISA plan, knowing there's an ERISA

5

plan which names her as the beneficiary, assumes that

6

that's her money?

7

MS. McDOWELL:

She may well do so, although she

8

would know that at the time of their divorce the -- her

9

spouse would be free to --

QUESTION:

And knowing that ERISA supersedes

11

State law, as well --

12

(Laughter.)

13

MS. McDOWELL:

With respect to express conflict

14

15

submit conflict with the Washington statute.

both agree to that?

MS. McDOWELL:

QUESTION:

25

And the husband doesn't do it?

Right, and then you have this -- then

you have this -MS. McDOWELL:

procedural requirements.

QUESTION:

But the QDRO has to be forwarded to

MS. McDOWELL:

that.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

8
9
10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I will turn quickly to the mistaken notion that

11

the Washington statute at issue in this case conflicts

12

with ERISA, but I want to explain from the outset exactly

13

what this statute does and why it does it.

14

Washington, like a number of States, as a number

15

of the questions have reflected, recognizes the

16

unsurprising proposition and, Justice Scalia, it is

17

recognized by an increasing number of States very rapidly,

18

that when two people divorce they try to give each other

19

less money, not more.

20

Particularly relevant here, the designation of

21

one spouse as a death beneficiary, whether in a will, and

22

there are will statutes in 49 out of the 50 States, or in

23

some other asset, is premised on the idea that at the time

24

of death the couple will still be married.

25

Applied to this case, and I think it very
26

1

important that we talk about the facts of this case, the

2

statute rests on the idea that when petitioner sought and

3

received a divorce from David Egelhoff, and after they

4

entered a very detailed divorce decree, to the level of,

5

he got the tan area rug and she got the Exercycle, that he

6

did not walk out of the courthouse thinking, oh, and I

7

want her to get the pension and the life insurance, too.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

10
11

Maybe she thought she got it.

QUESTION:

That is --

Maybe she had a good lawyer who read

ERISA --

12

(Laughter.)

13

QUESTION:

-- and said that, you know, there is

14

this statute, but it ain't going to affect whether you get

15

your ERISA payment.

16

doesn't know that, but boy, we're walking away with a good

17

settlement here.

You have that one.

18

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

expectations were.

Fortunately --

You really can't predict what the
It's hard to do.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

With respect, we can here for

22

two reasons.

23

says that he gets the pension.

24

doubt that that was the parties' intent.

25

Now, maybe he

First, the divorce decree itself explicitly
It says so, and there's no

And second, there is a declaration
27

1

uncontradicted in the record that she basically went

2

around telling people that David would roll over in his

3

grave at the notion that she was going to get this money.

4

QUESTION:

Well, just addressing the first, the

5

fact that the husband has the property interest means that

6

he simply has the power to designate the beneficiary.

7

That's quite consistent with his wanting to let her remain

8

the beneficiary.

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

With respect, in terms of just

10

what the parties understood would happen to the money, and

11

in particular, Justice Scalia, what Donna's expectation

12

was, he got the pension benefits.

13

the entirety of the pension benefit, and she could not

14

have an expectation that she would ever get the money,

15

because she knows that he could change it the next day.

16

Moreover, this is a community property State.

The death benefit is

17

They had to divide up the marital property, which included

18

the value of the pension at the time of divorce, and she

19

had to get equivalent assets at the time of divorce.

20

is nothing more than a double recovery in the purest

21

sense.

22

QUESTION:

This

Well, maybe it is, but I guess the

23

point that I don't seem to grasp is why it makes a dime's

24

worth of difference.

25

We've got a statute.
28

If the statute means what

1

they say it does, you lose.

2

but the particular expectations of the parties in a

3

particular divorce, even if there's an evidentiary basis

4

for it, seems to me irrelevant.

5

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

If it doesn't, maybe you win,

It is relevant in the sense --

6

in two senses, Justice Souter.

7

trying to explain to you the rationale and why it is so

8

rational that Washington did what it did, and second, it

9

goes to the question now speaking to the statute, what the

10

standard is for finding a conflict and finding preemption,

11

and that is that in this area, from cases like Hisquidero

12

on, there must be a clear and manifest conflict.

13
14

The first is that I'm

And now let me turn directly to the notion of
whether or not there is a conflict.

15

QUESTION:

Before you do that, can you just

16

clarify -- you said that this is a galloping thing in the

17

States.

18

How many States have these statutes now?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

There are 20 States that have

19

the statute now -- the number has been growing rapidly --

20

with respect to nonprobate assets.

21
22

QUESTION:

So the majority of States still do

not.

23

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

24

QUESTION:

25

It was --

They do not.

Is this the case:

47 States had

divorce revocation when the instrument is a will -29

1

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

2

QUESTION:

Exactly.

-- and about 20 have it when divorce

3

revocation is a nonprobate asset, and it's not

4

nonuniform -- that is, the States that have it are copying

5

the Uniform Probate Code, which has such a provision in

6

it?

Is that right?

7

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes.

All right.

If that is right, do

these 20 States all say, or most of them say, like

10

Washington, that if you expressly deny the applicability

11

of a divorce revocation statute, you're home free?

12

they all say that?

13

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

16
17

Do

They do not --

Some of them?

They all say that?

They do not all say that, but

almost all do, because that's in the UPC.
QUESTION:

All right.

Do almost all of them

18

provide, as Washington does, that if a trustee doesn't

19

know about a conflict among beneficiaries, he needn't pay?

20

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

21

QUESTION:

The majority do.

All right.

Do the majority also

22

provide that if the trustee does find out about it he also

23

need not pay until the State courts resolve the matter?

24

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

All right.
30

1

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Breyer has helpfully

2

just identified three different opt-out provisions that go

3

directly to the question of whether or not there's an

4

actual burden on the plan.

5

Chief Justice Rehnquist --

6

QUESTION:

Now, is it the case that -- does the

7

preemption provision at issue here say that preemption

8

only occurs when there's an administrative burden on the

9

plan?

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

The courts --

Is that the criterion?

I mean --

It is a principal criterion.

13

Whether or not there's an --

14

QUESTION:

Oh, I have no doubt that if there is

15

an administrative burden you will be much more likely to

16

find preemption, but if, on the face of it, there is

17

preemption, does there need to be an administrative

18

burden?

19

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

We do not believe so, and Boggs

20

is an example, that the Court did not reach the question.

21

Four justices of the Court in Justice Breyer's opinion

22

explained that there really wasn't a burden and there

23

wasn't field preemption.

24

conflict preemption here, but it is worth noting that

25

Justice Kennedy's opinion in that case did explain why

The majority said there is

31

1

there would be real administrative trouble if you

2

recognized nonparticipant interest.

3

Chief Justice Rehnquist -- so if I could

4

continue for the moment to focus on the practicalities of

5

what happens to an ERISA plan, turn to the specific

6

alleged conflicts with the statute in just a moment.

7

Chief Justice Rehnquist, you asked how this

8

worked in operation, and I'd like to refer to you -- refer

9

you to the respondent's lodging for a moment.

10

Respondent's lodging at tab 3 has the designation form for

11

the life insurance plan, and it explains that David

12

Egelhoff designated Donna R. Egelhoff, wife -- I

13

apologize.

14

8-1/2 X 11 lodging that may not have come upstairs.

There may be some confusion.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

17

What is the tab that you --

QUESTION:

19

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

20

QUESTION:

24
25

On this so-called lodging -Yes.

-- this isn't part of the joint

appendix, apparently.

22
23

I'm starting at tab 3, Justice

Kennedy.

18

21

This is an

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That is correct, Justice

O'Connor.
QUESTION:

And it's not a brief of yours, and by

what authority did you file it, if I may ask?
32

1
2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

We conferred with the Clerk's

Office and received permission to file a lodging.

3

Let me explain also that these are materials --

4

it's particularly important, because this is not something

5

that translates at all well into --

6

QUESTION:

Well, normally things that the

7

parties intend to refer to are incorporated in a joint

8

appendix, and I did not know that we accepted these

9

independently submitted supplemental documents.

10

I

couldn't believe it when it came in.

11

QUESTION:

The fact that the Clerk's Office

12

gives you leave to file it doesn't mean that it's a

13

desirable or even a permissible thing to do so far as the

14

Court is concerned.

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That point is well-taken, Mr.

16

Chief Justice.

17

Court that the documents that I am about to refer to are

18

part of the record.

19

Let me just specify for the benefit of the

I understand the point is well-taken that

20

counsel are much preferred at the beginning of the case

21

within the joint appendix to have one consolidated

22

document.

23

along, for example, after we received the petitioner's

24

brief, other documents become relevant that we want to

25

bring to the Court's attention.

It is the case, however, that as the case moves

33

1

QUESTION:

And these are part of the record?

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and so

3

let me just be absolutely clear these are not pedagogical

4

devices, anything outside the record.

5

I'm going to take you now are in the record of the case.

6

Tab 3 is the designation form, and it says that David

7

designated Donna R. Egelhoff, wife.

8

The two documents

The reason I point to it is that when the

9

administrator receives a claim for death benefits it's

10

common ground that he or she pulls out the designation

11

form.

12

13

dead.

14

Before paying the benefits, he or she must get the
We have to be sure that the person is

That's common sense.
On the death certificate it explains that David

15

Egelhoff died, and on line 14 -- or, excuse me, in cell

16

14, three lines down, it explains that he was divorced,

17

and that is the sum total of the administrative burden

18

that is put on ERISA plan administrators.

19

the exact same documents.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

They look at

Death certificates always say whether

you're divorced or not?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

So far -- I will not represent

23

to the Court that I have been able to identify every

24

State, but I have not been able to find one that hasn't.

25

There was no easy way of identifying every State's death
34

1

certificate, but yes, because they have to notify

2

next-of-kin, and remember as well, Justice Scalia, that

3

when you try to pay on death the survivor annuity required

4

by ERISA you must make the same inquiry.

5

if the participant was married at the time of death, and

6

so --

7

QUESTION:

But it's not married.

You have to know

I mean, do

8

they put down never married so you know that?

9

they must put down divorced.

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

You said

The question for the survivor

11

annuity, Justice Ginsburg, is, at the time of death was

12

the person married.

13

mandatory --

14
15

QUESTION:

That -- and if so, there must be a

So it will say -- it will say either

married or divorced.

16

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Exactly.

There are two lines in

17

the death certificate.

18

second is, there is, in fact, a surviving spouse, so --

19

One is married or divorced and the

Now, a number of the questions have focused on

20

whether or not there is a conflict with the terms of

21

ERISA.

22

be that there would be preemption even if there was no

23

additional burden.

24

it's going to work.

25

different.

Justice Scalia, you pointed out that it may well

This is -- Congress said, this is how
Washington can't say anything

35

1

Justice Souter, earlier you inquired similarly

2

whether or not there might not be conflict preemption,

3

because the statute mandates that you have to pay the

4

benefits to the named beneficiary.

5

the statute does not say that.

6

here is with the term, beneficiary, and with the --

7

QUESTION:

The difficulty is that

The only claimed conflict

I think I was referring to the

8

definition of beneficiary as being the individual

9

designated by the participant or by the plan, and I

10

thought there was an apparent conflict between that and

11

any statute which in effect superseded that.

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That occurs, with all due

13

respect to my colleagues, because in their briefs there is

14

an ellipsis of an important phrase, and the definition of

15

a beneficiary is -- and I'm going to now refer to 29

16

U.S.C. 1002 sub (8).

17

QUESTION:

Where do we find it?

18

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, it is at the

19

appendix to the petitioner's brief at page 2, and I --

20

when I refer to statutory section, from henceforth it will

21

always be in that brief.

22

QUESTION:

Page 2a?

23

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

This is

24

1002, sub (8).

The term, beneficiary, means a person

25

designated by a participant or by the terms of an employee
36

1

benefit plan who is or may become entitled to a benefit

2

thereunder, and let me explain how Washington law operates

3

here.

4

Washington law at the time of divorce does not

5

say, if you divorce you are no longer a beneficiary, the

6

money instead goes to the children.

7

the designation is ineffective and it is up to the terms

8

of the plan to determine who gets the money, and that's

9

exactly what the children were here.

It instead says that

They were persons

10

who may become entitled to a benefit thereunder.

11

have always been, because the plan specified.

12

QUESTION:

Two things -- excuse me.

They

Two things

13

occur to me.

14

a matter of Washington law, the children don't become

15

entitled under the plan.

16

if they are entitled at all, under the Washington -- under

17

the State law of Washington.

18

One is, doesn't -- first I guess is, just as

They end up becoming entitled,

And number 2, would you comment on what I

19

speculated when I read that last phrase, who are or may

20

become entitled.

21

referring to, in effect, a contingent designation.

22

referring to.

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I understand.

I have both

points firmly in mind.

say that the children become entitled because of the

statute.

designation -- it reflects, again, the common-sense

7

understanding that the meaning of the designation -- I

All that Washington law says is that the

Well, the form is, first becomes

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

13

QUESTION:

Becomes disentitled, and then --

We agree with that, and isn't that

14

enough for the conflict?

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

16

QUESTION:

No, Justice Souter.

Because the participant, or the

17

plan -- I guess the participant in this case -- is

18

designated and the statute says no, that designation is

19

not operative.

20

Isn't that a conflict?

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No.

The actual conflict, to

21

make it even more specific, the conflict would have to go,

22

if petitioner's position were accepted, ERISA says, pay

23

the beneficiary, which is correct, absent this special --

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, ERISA says, sure, but ERISA

says, by means of the definition section, pay the
38

1

beneficiary, who is the designee either of the participant

2

or of the plan.

3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, then we come to your

4

second point, because we have, or may become, because it

5

doesn't say the person who is entitled to receive by that

6

-- under the designation or under the plan.

7

become.

8
9

It's, who may

I agree with you that that is intended to
trigger contingent beneficiaries.

Our point is that the

10

children are as much contingent beneficiaries in the

11

meaning of that term as is the participant, because --

12
13

QUESTION:

They are if you first assume there is

no conflict and therefore the statute prevails.

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

15

QUESTION:

16

circularity in your position.

17

Well, we are looking --

That's -- I mean, that seems to me a

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I will give you an interpretive

18

aid in trying to decide what it means to be, or may

19

become, and that is that it can't be the case that

20

the children -- let me take you to Boggs.

21

Justice Kennedy's opinion for the Court in Boggs

22

explained that there are a class of people that ERISA is

23

intended to protect, participants and beneficiaries.

24

position is, is that before the death of David, and before

25

the administrator looked at the alternate beneficiary
39

Our

1
2

provisions, the children were protected by ERISA.
They were in the class of people who could bring

3

an action and say, look, you're misadministering plan

4

assets, just as much as Donna could.

5

class of people that ERISA intended to protect, and so if

6

you are going to call them not beneficiaries, they are

7

excluded from the rest of the statute entirely and they

8

receive none of the protections.

9

They are within the

Our understanding is that if Congress wanted to

10

say -- use more limited language than or may become, it

11

could have.

12

It could have said --

QUESTION:

Yes, but it's also the case that

13

the -- and I will assume the premise of your argument that

14

there may be a considerable class of individuals who may

15

object to plan administration.

16

that that every one of those individuals in fact gets some

17

money in the pocket at the point of distribution.

18

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It does not follow from

No, but the first class, the

19

group of people who are protected by the statute, are

20

denominated in the statute as beneficiaries.

21

QUESTION:

It seems to me what you're arguing is

22

that it does not pose a conflict with the plan if you

23

require the plan to pay out to a contingent beneficiary

24

instead of to the main beneficiary.

25

I mean, the mere fact that it's somebody who was
40

1

not entitled to it, but would be entitled to it if the

2

person entitled to it weren't around, that's still a

3

conflict, it seems to me.

4

called beneficiaries of some sort, you're still requiring

5

payment not to the beneficiary named.

6

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Just because they both are

Well, Justice Scalia, there are

7

many times when an ERISA plan pays benefits to someone

8

other than a named beneficiary, so we're going to have to

9

find the conflict somewhere else.

10

ERISA plans pay benefits out under the spousal

11

annuity.

12

QDRO provisions.

13

pay it out directly to the person whose name is on it.

14

fact, the plan here reserves the right to determine that

15

the individual named is incompetent, and not to pay them

16

then, either.

17

ERISA plans pay ERISA benefits out under the
It is many times not the case that they

QUESTION:

In

But the spousal annuity provision, I

18

mean, the spouse at the time of death may not be named,

19

but it's clear on the face of the plan and the

20

accompanying law of ERISA that the spousal annuity goes to

21

the spouse at the time of the beneficiary's death, or --

22

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Let me deal with what I take to

23

be the premise of your point, which is that a conflict

24

with the terms of the plan would be sufficient to cause

25

preemption, if the plan said, you can't do this, and
41

1

second -- so I'll return to that in just a moment, whether

2

or not that would be sufficient to cause ERISA preemption,

3

but let me deal with it on the facts of this case, and it

4

is important to return to the text of the statute again.

5

With the stroke of a pen, you can write into any

6

nonprobate asset, including an ERISA plan, divorce

7

revocation statutes do not apply.

8
9

Justice Ginsburg, you asked the petitioner's
lawyer, wouldn't there also be the problem you wouldn't

10

know which State law applies.

The Attorney General of

11

Washington in her brief at footnote 6 has explained under

12

this statute, you don't have to say, Revised Code 1107010

It is, you just

And so in terms of getting to the

16

practicalities, Justice Ginsburg, of how is this going to

work for administrators --

18

QUESTION:

Doesn't that conflict with ERISA?

I

19

mean, isn't he supposed to pay out the money promptly to

20

the person entitled to it, and you're saying it doesn't

21

conflict with ERISA to tell him to sit on his hands until

22

litigation terminates 2 years hence?

23

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Scalia, it is frequently

24

the case, in fact, that ERISA plans have some doubt.

25

Court discussed probably the most obvious cases, slayer
43

The

1

statutes, simultaneous death happens actually not

2

infrequently, but there are lots of times -- Justice

3

Stevens, the middle name of all the children is Joseph.

4

There are many times when you don't pay immediately.

5

ERISA provides in its enforcement section, and

6

the circuits uniformly agree, that what the plan should do

7

there is simply put the money aside and wait for the

8

claiming participants to fight it out.

9

QUESTION:

Would you refresh my recollection?

10

Does the statute take care of the situation when the

11

beneficiary is incompetent, or a child, or something like

12

that?

13

done as a matter of State law?

Does it provide paying to a conservator, or is that

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

15

QUESTION:

Does -- ERISA does not.

It doesn't contemplate that.

So if,

16

in fact, the plan administrator knows that the -- say, the

17

beneficiary is in prison, or is having a mental problem or

18

something, he doesn't have to pay out right away?

19

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

22
23

That's correct.

Yes.
There are many times this

happens.
QUESTION:

If -- is there -- you're asking us, I

24

take it, to interpret the statute, ERISA, which

25

effectively says pay the money to the primary beneficiary.
44

1

You want to say, well, pay the money to the primary

2

beneficiary who is a beneficiary and isn't disqualified by

3

certain State laws, and now this is one of the State laws

4

that might disqualify a person, and another one is a

5

slayer statute, and a third one, I take it, is a

6

simultaneous death statute, and are there any others --

7

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

8

QUESTION:

9

Those --

-- that anybody's been able to think

of?

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No, and it is important to

11

understand in terms of what the court is opening the doors

12

to, that the States have been regulating this area for

13

centuries, and that is the -- you know, this is in the

14

area of divorce.

15

have limited themselves, and if I could just mention one

16

point --

17

There are normal probate areas that they

QUESTION:

Do -- I mean, one of the ways they

18

used to regulate it is that, you know, the wife would get

19

half the estate automatically upon death.

20

a State enacts a law that says, you know, if this benefit

21

is not given to the spouse at the time of death, it must

22

be.

23

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

24

QUESTION:

25

Suppose the --

I understand.

And this is probate, this is our

concern with the family and with marriage and all of that.
45

1

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

2

QUESTION:

3

would be overcome with that.

4

Yes.

Surely you wouldn't say that ERISA

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That's exactly right, because

5

that's a prohibited alienation.

6

explain why this is not.

7

That's Boggs, and let me

Congress provided that there are certain people,

8

participants and their beneficiaries, when it's a spousal

9

annuity, who have an expectation that they are going to

10

live off pension benefits, and it specified when an

11

alienation would occur.

12

This is not a situation where the money is taken

13

away from the participant or anyone else who has a

14

mandated right to it and give -- and let me take you to

15

the definition.

16

reprinted in the appendix to any brief -- I apologize --

17

but I will simply read it to you.

18

and that is at the appendix to petitioner's brief at page

19

4, and it simply says, not very helpfully, each pension

20

plan shall provide the benefits provided under the plan

21

may not be assigned or alienated.

22

The alienation definition is not

Well, the statute is,

Justice Kennedy's opinion in Boggs looks to the

23

IRS's definition and I will read it to you.

24

record is at 26 C.F.R. section 1.401A-(13)(c)(i) -- (ii).

25

The terms, assignment and alienation, include any direct

This for the

1

or indirect arrangement, whether revocable or irrevocable

2

whereby a party acquires from a participant or beneficiary

a right or interest enforceable against a plan in or to

QUESTION:

That's what I thought alienation

6

means.

It means from a participant.

7

not from the participant.

8

law.

This alienation is

It's by operation of the State

9

You're not getting it from the participant.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

We agree.

It's not an

10

alienation.

That's our point, and that's the difference

11

from the hypothetical you asked.

12

decree that said, look -- if the divorce decree here said,

13

Donna Egelhoff is going to get 100 percent of David's

14

pension, if that is not, Justice O'Connor, registered as a

15

QDRO that's an alienation.

You can't do it.

16

Now, the petitioner --

17

QUESTION:

18

Excuse me, that is an alienation?

Why is that an alienation?

19
20

If there was a divorce

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Because it takes it from David

and gives it to Donna.

21

QUESTION:

But David is not alienating himself.

22

He's not taking it from himself and giving it to Donna.

23

thought you agreed with me that that's what alienate

24

means.

25

not that operation of law can't take it away from you and

It means you can't transfer it to someone else,

I

47

1

give it to somebody else.

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I apologize, Justice Scalia.

3

was focusing on the take it from the person to another.

4

You were focusing on the operation of law.

5

agree with your interpretation of operation of law.

6

Unfortunately, I think it's precluded by Boggs.

7

State community property law.

8

might -- some might think he had the better of that

9

argument.

10

I

I actually

That was

I think Justice Breyer

That is water under the bridge, and that was

community property law.

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.
Remember, the second wife,

13

community property law, took it.

She -- the community

14

property law is what gave it to her.

15

on, though, is that this does not take it from somebody

16

and give it to somebody else.

So what I'm focusing

17

Now, there was the question put before, well,

18

should this have been a QDRO, and there is the negative

19

inference suggested by petitioner that Congress occupied

20

this field, that really these sorts of things are supposed

21

to be done by QDRO's, and I will explain to you why that's

22

not so.

23

Washington law doesn't intend to say that the

24

kids will get the money.

That's the whole point, that the

25

plan will decide who gets the money.
48

Washington law wants

1

David, after the divorce, to decide who will get it.

2

there's a third wife.

3

If there's a third wife, David wants to be able to name

4

her.

5

said, the money goes to the kids, he's out of luck.

6

That's a registered decree under Washington State law.

David -- say he's a serial marrier.

If there's a QDRO, he can't.

7

Say

If the divorce decree

All Washington is trying to do here is say,

8

look, when you divorce, the intent is that the spouse,

9

your ex-spouse isn't going to get the money.

Go fix the

10

problem some other way, and it says to the plans, or any

11

other nonprobate asset, you don't want to comply, say

12

you're not going to comply.

13

comply.

14

don't want this to be the rule, just say so, either in the

15

divorce decree or even in your designation.

16

You have any doubts, don't

And it says to the participant himself, if you

There really is nothing going on here that

17

Congress didn't want to happen.

18

Boggs, where we had the actual spouse who was going to get

19

the spousal annuity, or we had the pension benefits after

20

death in the hands at least of the estate of the

21

pensioner, none of that applies here.

22

There's nobody -- unlike

We're in a situation where Congress left it up

23

to anybody to name a designee, and unless there's some

24

real practical problem for the ERISA plan, unless

25

something's -- it's just not workable, I could understand
49

1

a reason to preempt it.

But when you're going to take

2

away simultaneous death, slayer statutes -- in the

3

footnote in which they address the issue in their reply

4

brief, petitioner says, Justice Scalia, that it preempts

5

state law definitions of what it is to die, who's a

6

spouse, what's a child, common law issues frequently

7

regulated by the States.

8

I should make one final point, and that is that

9

there is at the very least one alternative narrow holding

10

that I don't understand the answer to for this Court, and

11

that is that we sued petitioner under a provision of State

12

law that lets us just sue her, and if the problem is the

13

practical administration of this rule, that it will cause

14

a burden for ERISA plans, the rule at the least ought to

15

be that that's not preempted.

16

suit.

It's a State law conversion

We can go after her for the money.

17

QUESTION:

It seems to me, and maybe you have an

18

answer to it, that the manner in which this State law

19

differs from laws that say who a wife is, who a child is

20

and so forth, is that this is a State law that is directed

21

explicitly to the manner in which a contract, an ERISA

22

contract in particular, should be interpreted.

23

directed precisely to the intent of the parties to an

24

agreement, and it says this is what they shall be deemed

25

to intend.

It is

It operates directly and explicitly upon the
50

1
2

agreement itself.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Two points.

The first is that,

3

of course, it doesn't operate in such a fashion if there's

4

any contrary expression of intent by any of the parties,

5

be it the plan or the participant.

6

The second is that I do think in these ERISA

7

cases we get the unfortunate sense that this statute is

8

about ERISA plans, and it's not.

9

statute, of course, that deals with every form of will.

There's a separate

10

This statute deals with every conceivable form of

11

nonprobate asset.

12

It's really important under State law.

Most of the money that is held by individuals

13

now is either in your home or in a life insurance plan or

14

in a pension, whether qualified or not, and you get the

15

situation that you have here, and that is that Donna

16

Egelhoff already got equivalent assets.

come along and recover again.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. KILBERG

23

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Thank you, Mr. Goldstein.

24

MR. KILBERG:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

25

Just a few points.

The last point that Mr.
51

1

Goldstein made, which suggests broader preemption than I

2

think the statute entails, ERISA preempts State law only

3

insofar as it relates to an employee benefit plan.

4

is suggesting that the State statute is preempted with

5

regard to other nonprobate assets.

6

No one

Mr. Goldstein also mentioned that they had sued,

7

the respondents here had sued petitioner, not the plan.

8

Well, that is true.

9

well and, as the Court said in the Boggs decision, there,

That, of course, was true in Boggs as

10

as here, the premise of the lawsuit is based on a

11

displacement of ERISA provisions and plan provisions.

12

A point with regard to the contingent

13

beneficiary notion.

14

respondents are beneficiaries under ERISA because they

15

have a contingent right, then their only cause of action

16

would be under section 502(a) of ERISA.

17

their exclusive right, and they would have had to sue the

18

plan under those provisions rather than the petitioner

19

under the State statute.

20

If Mr. Goldstein is correct, and

That would be

With regard to the QDRO point, Qualified

21

Domestic Relations Order point, the fact is that a QDRO

22

could have been fashioned that provided that the spouse

23

had given up any interest that she might have as a

24

beneficiary.

25

provision is a relatively easy one to effect.

The fact here is, that wasn't done.
