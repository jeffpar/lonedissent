ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

MR. DRAPER:

Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and

may it please the Court:

11

The parties are here on exceptions to the third

report in this case.

State of Colorado had violated the Arkansas River Compact

in 1995, the case was returned to the Special Master for

15

further proceedings.

16

After the Court determined that the

Colorado had violated the Arkansas River Compact in every

18

year from the inception of their compact to the date of

19

filing of this case in 1985.

since the filing of the lawsuit, that Colorado has

21

continued to violate the compact in every year through

22

1996, except for 1987.

He further determined that,

these losses, which are both past and future, because of

the lingering effects of the violations by Colorado,

QUESTION:

And is there any provision in the

compact for the provision of prejudgment interest?
MR. DRAPER:

No, there is no specific provision

on prejudgment interest, nor is there any provision

specifically addressing the remedy, just as there was no

provision in the Pecos River Compact, which this Court --

QUESTION:

Well, the common law rule, I assume,

is that you don't award prejudgment interest for

9

unliquidated damages.

10

MR. DRAPER:

That is the traditional rule, Your

11

Honor, but it is a largely discredited rule at this point

12

in history, and the Court has recognized that most

odd to me that we would all of a sudden craft some rule

MR. DRAPER:

In almost every case, the compacts

that are in place now do not specify the precise remedy,

Court.

Did they just assume that, what,

I think that is the correct
The Court has said in 1987, in the

10

Texas v. New Mexico litigation, that the contract remedies

11

should be looked to to determine the proper remedy for

12

13

QUESTION:

Was that the very first case in which

14

damages, money damages were even awarded in one of these

2

MR. DRAPER:

In this case, Your Honor, if I

understood your point, Colorado took the position

4

initially that compensation should be in water, without

5

interest.

6

should be in money with interest.

7

The State of Kansas took the position that it

QUESTION:

Right, and this is the first case

8

we've had where that conflict has been presented to us.

9

One of the parties doesn't want to pay money damages.

10

MR. DRAPER:

11

QUESTION:

That is correct.
And if we didn't allow money damages,

12

I presume it would -- and if one of the parties would

13

prefer monetary damages, I presume they could negotiate it

14

out and pay -- I mean, Colorado could negotiate it out and

15

pay money instead of water.

16

MR. DRAPER:

That's correct, and Colorado is not

17

challenging the determination by the Special Master here

18

that the remedy should be in money.

19

QUESTION:

I know they're not, but --

20

QUESTION:

If money damages were not awarded,

21

and some form of water relief, then you have a master

Colorado says, that's your water coming down in payment

for our past violations.

You look at the river, and

I can tell when we get a check.

It's -- the interest question was

never adjudicated before, but you're saying as well the

8

damages question was never adjudicated, because last time

10

MR. DRAPER:

Last time around it was not clear

11

that the parties were in agreement on the possibility of

money damages, but this Court ruled that that was an

option that should be considered by the Special Master.

QUESTION:

So I mean, and that wouldn't put the

burden on us to try to figure out how you compute money

damages for failure to deliver water.

21

of the big issues in this case, I suppose, isn't it?

22

You're going to get to that, whether we compute the losses

Yes.

point in the case, Your Honor, that the compensation

2

should be paid in money.

3

was quantified by Kansas in large part by assessing the

4

injuries suffered by the water users in Kansas, mostly

5

irrigating farmers.

6

That, as Your Honor alludes to,

The approach was taken to assess the losses in

7

value suffered by the water users in Kansas because we had

8

no ready market for water to which we could turn for the

9

value of an acre foot of water in 1950, 1951 and so on.

10

If we had that, that would have been the most direct way

11

to do it.

12

QUESTION:

I take it your argument for interest

13

here is that there were -- that the money -- I'm sorry,

14

that the water you didn't get in the 45 years in which the

15

violations went on is translatable into crop loss, crop

16

loss is translatable into money and, in order to be made

17

whole on the money, you should be made whole on the loss

of use of the money.

argument, isn't it?

MR. DRAPER:

QUESTION:

I mean, that's your interest

That's exactly right, Your Honor.
Okay.
Yes.
Did you -- was there an inflationary

factor added so that the damages, say for the early

sixties were computed in 1995 or year 2000 dollars?

MR. DRAPER:

For the years that were denied

2

prejudgment interest treatment, 1950 through 1968, the

3

Special Master did adjust those, at the suggestion of

4

Colorado, not on the basis of principal, but simply

because Colorado was not objecting to that.

adjusted, which is only a fraction of the time value of

7

money that occurred from that period to the present.

QUESTION:

Those are

But the people who are paying are

really the present taxpayers, and they're paying for

10

something that older generations of taxpayers maybe didn't

11

do, and it could be horrendous amounts, if you have a

12

violation that's 200 years old, as you could in a

13

different case.

14

Rather than getting into all that, why wouldn't

15

we assume that the States didn't want to unless they said

16

it specifically in the compact?

MR. DRAPER:

Your Honor, there are limits to

Now, what prevents that from happening, once we

The Court has stated that the

losses that the State of Kansas, as State, is entitled to

materially depleted in usable quantity or availability for

5

We believe that it is not the proper

6

characterization of this case that it is going to be --

7

that is a problem for the individuals, either as taxpayers

8

in Colorado or the water users in Kansas, but that these

9

are State obligations, and they need to be settled between

10

States on fair, compensatory rules that are normally

11

applied in contract situations, because, as we know,

compacts are contracts between the compacting States.

Your Honor, there is no specific

evidence in the record on that, but from my knowledge the

used primarily for irrigation purposes.

As I understand, the Master decided that the

interest ought to run from 1969, which was the date upon

which each side either knew or should have known that a

violation of the compact was taking place.

5

MR. DRAPER:

QUESTION:

Yes.
The Master also decided that there

had been no undue delay on the part of Kansas in not

something like that?

11

MR. DRAPER:

That's correct.

It was -- suit was

filed at the end of 1985.

12

QUESTION: Indeed.

The two dates, or the

13

findings with respect to the two dates struck me as being

at least possibly in tension.

15

Kansas would have been obligated to file suit, of course,

16

in 1969, the year that it first knew or should have known,

gap between that time and the time that Kansas actually

one area being where there was unreasonable delay, and the

other area being whether prejudgment interest should be

awarded, is inconsistent.

We suggest that it is impossible to find
unreasonable delay if the plaintiff was unaware of the

doctrine of laches, would they not?

3

MR. DRAPER:

Yes, Your Honor.

This Court in

4

1995 did not go so far as to decide that laches is

5

applicable, but found that in this case there was

6

unreasonable delay and that, either through the doctrine

7

of laches or acquiescence, there was the ability of the

8

Court to deal with stale claims.

QUESTION:

Mr. Draper, could I come back to

10

Justice Souter's question?

11

that Kansas should not have known enough to bring the suit

12

until 1987, but Colorado should have known that it was

13

wrongfully taking too much water 17 years before that?

14

seems to me the two should go hand in hand.

15

MR. DRAPER:

I don't understand how it is

We believe that the existence or

16

nonexistence of knowledge on the part of Colorado is

17

absolutely irrelevant as a matter of law, and we have

18

taken no position on what the right date might be if --

purpose of the common law rule against prejudgment

violation either was or should have been known, and from

the problem of allowing a State, as apparently Kansas did

here, to sit on its rights from 1969 to whatever it was,

There are two answers to that, Your

MR. DRAPER:

There are two answers.

One is

17

that this Court has already determined that there was not

unreasonable delay in bringing this suit, and the Special

Master did not base in any way his decision to limit

prejudgment interest on any delay other than that

considered in the laches analysis.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS INTERVENOR

9
10

It's simply

MR. MINEAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The United States would like to address two

12

issues with respect to the Master's proposed remedy.

13

First, the Master's calculation of damages here does not

14

violate the Eleventh Amendment and, second, this Court

15

should allow prejudgment interest on a discretionary basis

16

in interstate compact suits.

17

QUESTION:

When you get to the second point, and

18

I don't mean to spoil your order, but will you sort of

20

of us seem to be having in finding that there was

knowledge, or should have been knowledge in '69.

in fact, to preserve the continuity of the argument.

2

Your Honor, first of all, the Master's finding

3

with respect to knowledge here related to Colorado's

4

knowledge, and not Kansas' knowledge, and Colorado had

5

knowledge that there was the prospect of some violation

6

because it had complaints within its own State borders

7

with respect to groundwater pumping depletion, depleting

8

stream flow and, as you may recall, that is the basis for

9

liability here, that Colorado had allowed its citizens to

10

pump groundwater which reduced the State line flow.

11

QUESTION:

No, I realize that.

Did he, did the

12

Master specifically find that Kansas was not under an

13

obligation to have known in '69?

14

MR. MINEAR:

15

He found that Kansas did not know

at that time.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. MINEAR:

QUESTION:

Did not know in fact?
Did not know in fact.
And I suppose Colorado did not know

'69.

Kansas should have known in '69?

MR. MINEAR:

I do not believe that he did.

don't believe that he specifically addressed that issue.

in which there is no question about Kansas being thrown

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Minear, one thing seems to have

14

gotten lost in this discussion.

15

when Colorado, or perhaps Kansas, knew that Kansas water

16

was being depleted, and when you were able to prove in

17

court how much, wasn't there something in the record that

18

until there was computer modeling you couldn't estimate

with any degree of accuracy --

20

MR. MINEAR:

QUESTION:

22
23

I thought that it was --

That's --- how much was involved, and that

wasn't until the eighties.
MR. MINEAR:

That's correct, Your Honor, that

24

also there was difficulty in determining exactly how much

25

water had been depleted.

It wasn't clear when that

1

knowledge was available, but it certainly was after, we

2

believe, 1968.

3

QUESTION:

No, but couldn't they have brought a

4

suit in equity to stop depletion, and if they had done

5

that, the damages wouldn't be running, we wouldn't have

6

the interest question.

7
8

MR. MINEAR:

Well, I agree with that as well,

and again I think this focuses --

9

QUESTION:

So the fact that they may not have

10

been able to prove the precise predicate, which is the

11

modeling predicate for the computation of money damages

12

now, doesn't prove that they shouldn't have sued earlier.

13

MR. MINEAR:

Your Honor, I agree with all of the

14

points that are being made here, and the United States

wishes to emphasize the principle that a rigid rule one

1

contrary.

2

MR. MINEAR:

Your Honor, because I think that

3

doesn't adequately address the common law rule, which I

4

think we should look to the Restatement of Contracts in

5

stating the rule in a compact case.

6

That's the closest analogy to the contract

7

situation, and in the Restatement of Contracts, since 1932

8

the rule has been that, where damages are a fixed sum of

9

money, or a performance that has a fixed value,

10

prejudgment interest does apply, but in those cases, in

11

all other cases prejudgment interest is applied under a

12

rule of reasonableness, based on the aspects, the

13

circumstances of the particular case.

14

So our position really simply suggests that the

15

Restatement rule is what ought to be applied here.

16

States would have been on knowledge of that principle as a

17

background principle in this case.

18

Both

I would like to address the Eleventh Amendment

issue, because I think that also merits this Court's

Kansas is entitled to money damages as a basis for

violations, and he calculated those damages by determining

2

evaluated the cost to Kansas farmers, which was reflected

3

in two matters, increased groundwater pumping costs, and

also lost crop production.

Colorado has challenged that aspect of the award

we disagree.

damages here was simply by reference to what the water was

worth to the Kansas users, not to provide any sort of

Our view is, the Master's determination of

compensation for the Kansas users themselves.
QUESTION:

Well, you mean Colorado can't turn

deprived of it, if they're still around?

The -- later in the compact, in the enforcement

Neither State expressed an understanding that there was

activities in Colorado or in Kansas.

17

Prior to that time, both States cooperated together

Remember, if you look again at Article 4(d), it

18

applies to both States, not just Colorado, so what we need

19

to do here is understand what the deal was, and the deal

wasn't that Colorado was automatically guaranteeing that

it was going to deliver a certain amount of water every

If there's something different about this one,

it must stem from the fact that in a very old case what

that the agreement that was reached between the two States

was, 1) that contemplated the States would work together

to ensure that additional usable flows did not --

MR. ROBBINS:

The reason that Colorado engaged

in the evidentiary proceeding to determine what the

permit the assessment of general damages, and the Master

made a finding about general damage to the Kansas economy

which is called secondary damages, and it was, in fact --

that number was derived and is contained in his report.

MR. ROBBINS:

The problem that we have is this.

3

In North Dakota v. Minnesota, you set out a fairly bright

4

line between what a State could, in fact, recover in the

5

way of damages and what it could not.

6

In this case, as the record, as the briefs made

7

clear, if you calculate the specific amount of damage that

8

each individual suffered, and if you award prejudgment

9

interest on the rate at that, that that individual would

10

have enjoyed or paid if he had had the money, or obtained

11

if he'd had the money, and you add all that up, and simply

12

say, that is the amount of money that the State of Kansas

13

is entitled to, and then, reading Texas v. New Mexico, you

14

say a State can decide in the public interest, which is

15

the term used in Texas v. New Mexico, they can return that

money to the individuals, you have simply permitted, in

avoid North Dakota v. Minnesota.

What we do not want to do is see damages paid to

17

the State of Kansas that represent individual damages

18

impermissible under the Eleventh Amendment from being

19

brought against the State, summed up, and paid to the

20

State of Kansas.

21

In my view, the way in which this case has

22

unfolded, there is a significant risk, if one assumes that

23

allowing a State to distribute any damages it receives in

24

the public interest, that a State can simply, by clever

25

pleading, fail to announce that it is seeking the damages

QUESTION:

That was not -Mr. Robbins, I was thinking when you

3

were making the argument in your brief, of what you would

4

say the Eleventh Amendment means in the kind of claim you

5

say that the Secretary of Labor would bring against a

6

State for violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act where

7

the recovery would go directly into the pocket of the

8

affected worker.

Eleventh Amendment?

10

Are those suits impermissible under the

MR. ROBBINS:

That is pursuant to Federal

11

statute, and that's a topic that I know this Court has had

12

a significant amount of debate about.

13

QUESTION:

Well, why isn't the compact on the

14

same level as a Federal statute?

it.

MR. ROBBINS:

QUESTION:

18

Congress had to approve

I assume it has the status of a

Federal statute --

MR. ROBBINS:

-- so I assume the analogy is exact.

QUESTION:

Well, the United States can sue for

damages without an Eleventh Amendment problem.
MR. ROBBINS:

That's correct, and it has been

described as a Federal statute, but it is a -QUESTION:

can, but what you're saying here is, it's not the State.

2

You're not questioning that one State can sue another

3

without an Eleventh Amendment barrier, but you say what

4

makes it no good is that it's for the benefit of the

5

farmers, so similarly, in the Fair Labor Standards Act,

6

the United States is suing, but if you apply your

7

reasoning, the workers are the same as the farmers.

MR. ROBBINS:

Justice Ginsburg, I am arguing

North Dakota v. Minnesota to you, which -- in which case a

10

lawsuit was filed by the State of North Dakota against

11

Minnesota.

12

They asked specifically for an injunction, which the Court

13

found was appropriate.

14

They claimed -- they asked for three things.

They asked for proprietary damages, or damages

15

to the State itself, which the Court found was

16

appropriate, and they asked specifically for specific

17

damages to individual farmers who were injured by the

18

actions of Minnesota, and the Court found that was

19

inappropriate, because North Dakota was trying to stand in

20

the shoes --

QUESTION:

Yes but in this case there is not a

claim comparable to your third example.
MR. ROBBINS:

In this case --

That is absolutely correct, and

that's why I say it becomes a matter of pleading.

If you

1

farmers when you file your complaint, but simply seek

2

their damages, and those damages are then permissible to

3

be collected, and then you say, under Texas v. New Mexico,

4

I can distribute them as I wish, if I determine it's in

5

the public interest, I can turn around and give them back.

QUESTION:

Was there a compact in Minnesota v.

North Dakota?

MR. ROBBINS:

9

I thank you very much for your time.

There was not, Mr. Chief Justice.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you,

Mr. Robbins.

The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
