ORAL ARGUMENT OF WEBSTER J. ARCENEAUX, III

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12

MR. ARCENEAUX:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents a simple issue, whether the

13

Fourth Circuit's decision in this case that a party is not

14

a prevailing party unless they obtain a judgment, consent

15

decree, or settlement is in accordance with this Court's

16

prior decisions and the intent of Congress in establishing

17

the term, prevailing party, in the Civil Rights Attorneys'

18

Fees Award Act of 1976, commonly referred to as section

19

1988, and the two statutes at issue in this case, the Fair

20

Housing Amendments Act, and the Americans With

21

Disabilities Act.

22

When Congress enacted all three of these fee-

23

shifting statutes, it did not condition an award of fees

24

only upon the result of a judgment, consent decree, or

25

settlement.

In fact, nowhere in these -3

QUESTION:

Well, the language of the statutes in

each case, does it not, refers to prevailing party?

3

MR. ARCENEAUX:

4

QUESTION:

5

So we do have to be satisfied that

the person seeking fees is a prevailing party.

6

MR. ARCENEAUX:

7

QUESTION:

8

Yes, Your Honor, it does.

Absolutely.

And how is that to be determined

where the case is dismissed as moot?

9

MR. ARCENEAUX:

Well, I think in that situation,

10

we have a declaration that the case is moot, so -- in this

11

particular case we had that as well -- and then we can

12

look and see under what is known as the catalyst theory,

13

whether that lawsuit caused the defendant to act to render

14

that suit moot.

15

QUESTION:

I would have thought the language,

16

prevailing party, suggests something else, that there

17

ought to be some nominal damages, or some judgment, or

18

some indication that the person seeking fees did, in fact,

19

prevail in a judicial proceeding.

20

MR. ARCENEAUX:

If we look just to the word,

21

prevail, I believe it is a broad word, and this is my

22

point.

23

decree, or settlement, Congress said prevail, and I

24

believe that --

25

Congress didn't say prevail by judgment, consent

QUESTION:

But the term, prevailing party, has a

1

pretty well-established meaning in the law, doesn't it?

2

It means you prevailed by getting something in a lawsuit.

3

MR. ARCENEAUX:

Yes, and I think that's a fine

4

way to put it.

If I sued someone for damages I think is

5

an easy way to put it, if I sue them for $50,000, and they

6

hand me $50,000 and say, go dismiss this lawsuit, I don't

7

have a judgment, I don't have a consent decree, I don't

8

have a settlement, but I have the $50,000.

9

QUESTION:

But that's not the way lawsuits are

10

ordinarily settled.

11

will probably pay it, but you'll get a stipulation and

12

order dismissing the thing.

record --

If someone sues you for $50,000, you

14

MR. ARCENEAUX:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

It will be a matter of court

That's correct.

-- that it was dismissed not because

of mootness but because you're paid.
MR. ARCENEAUX:

That's right, but -- and that's

18

the same thing in this situation, where, when I sue

19

somebody and I say, don't shut down my home, don't throw

20

the residents out of the home, and they say, okay, we

21

won't do that, now, I don't have a judgment, consent

22

decree, or settlement, but I have the same effect, the

23

same result as if they had handed me the $50,000.

24
25

QUESTION:

But that's not what the statute says.

It says you have to be a prevailing party, and I think

prevailing obviously means prevailing in the lawsuit,

2

not -- it doesn't say the happy party, you know, the party

who goes away smiling.

4

think it means prevailing in the litigation, and to

prevail in the litigation there has to be something that

ties the result to the litigation, it seems to me --

It says the prevailing party.

that is looked at, whether there is a causal relationship

between --

QUESTION:

But you would have to establish it.

It's not just a factor.

You would have to show --

15

MR. ARCENEAUX:

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

-- that the litigation caused the

17

result, caused, in this case, the homes to remain open,

even though they didn't have the --

19

MR. ARCENEAUX:

Absolutely, and that is what we

20

intend to do.

speak, because we were not allowed to proceed with any

22

factual development of that, but we think that we have a

23

very strong case, and we will absolutely be able to

establish the causal relationship.

MR. ARCENEAUX:

When you look to the prior

decisions of this Court, the definition of prevailing

party under the cases has been, they personally achieve

15

some of the benefits they sought in bringing the suit.

There are obviously numerous

Then we're back to my question.

Why,

given this statute, is the word prevailing party here to

be interpreted to mean you are a prevailing party, even

though there is no piece of paper saying anything in the

Two reasons.

think it's consistent with the meaning of the word,

influence another to act, and second, because I believe

that's what Congress intended.

When one looks at the House report, for

instance, it says similarly, after a complaint is filed,

3

the defendant might voluntarily cease the unlawful

practice.

may conclude as a matter of equity that no formal relief

The Marr case was a Supreme Court

case, wasn't it?
MR. ARCENEAUX:

Yes, and this was section 1988.

where this Court had said in Alyeska that we were not

going to have attorney's fee award under what was called

10

the Private Attorney General, and so Congress intended to

11

have these type of civil rights lawsuits filed, and they

wanted to encourage these type of lawsuits.

the language says, and this is what is under the

that what Congress intended, we think that you can look to

Well, most of the cases that

7

I've seen where they talk about the legislature -- and

there are some cases that are simple.

have found, and it's right there in the legislative

10

history, they enacted this provision -- Paris is an

11

example, where they say in the legislative history, we

12

don't have documented legislative history.

13

saying is, there should not be a per se rule just when the

14

legislature acts that we cannot then present our evidence.

The second thing is, unlike a lot of the

16

legislative cases, when they talk about the legislative

17

cases they talk about intervening causation, that here is

some third party that has taken the lawsuit away, the

19

legislature has acted.

20

We don't believe there's any intervening

causation here, because we were suing the fire commission

MR. ARCENEAUX:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

Which, if you had done nothing would

3

have surely followed, and then you would have been the

4

object of an adverse judgment.

5

MR. ARCENEAUX:

Yes, and we believe that we

6

prevailed.

We were under cease and desist orders, and the

7

homes were going to be shut down, and all the residents

8

were going to be thrown out, and we presented expert

9

testimony -- these were clients that were 102 years old,

10

and that they could suffer transfer trauma just by the

11

very act of them being moved into another home.

12

in on a TRO.

13

That agreed order remained in place for the duration of

14

the litigation, and no one was ever thrown out of the

15

home.

16

We went

We were able to obtain an agreed order.

The homes were never shut down.
QUESTION:

Well, my goodness, you don't become a

17

prevailing party by getting a preliminary order just

18

leaving the status quo in effect while the case is being

19

adjudicated.

22

I mean, is that all it takes to prevail?

MR. ARCENEAUX:

We think that it is part.

We

understand that it was only a interim relief.
QUESTION:

Does it matter to your case whether

23

the fire -- whatever it is, the fire marshal's judgment,

24

or for that matter the legislature's judgment, was based

25

on the fact that they thought the law was outrageous, as

QUESTION:

I think we have to show --

-- whether they simply said, we're

10

suddenly aware of the law and we think it's bad and it

ought to be changed, or on the other hand they say, we

Isn't there causation in either case?
Yes.

The one cause, the lawsuit brings it

11

to the attention, but for the lawsuit it would not have

12

come to the attention, it wouldn't have been changed.

13

In the other case, there's a different chain of

causation, but it's still the same causation.

3

complies with the demand without a court order.

QUESTION:

In this case, was the matter moot as

a matter of Article III jurisdiction, so the judge had no

choice, or would the judge have had some discretion to

retain jurisdiction to enter some sort of declaratory

relief?

9

MS. BRINKMANN:

It appears, Your Honor, that it

10

was, in fact, moot because of a legislative change under

11

this Court's standards in Laidlaw and City of Mesquite.

12

There's such a minuscule likelihood that that law would be

changed back.

3

QUESTION:

Oh, okay.

4

MS. BRINKMANN:

That's often the situation.

5

Also, there are several statutes that we cite in a

6

footnote of our brief that limit relief in civil rights

7

cases to injunctive relief, and those are often the most

8

important kinds of cases that the fee-shifting statutes

9

are intended to get at, where a plaintiff has a

10

meritorious claim for injunctive relief to enforce a civil

11

rights law, but does not have the money to pay an

12

attorney, and no possibility of a damages relief that

13

could perhaps pay those attorneys' fees.

14
15
16

The court of appeals' categorical rule
undermines that.
QUESTION:

Ms. Brinkmann, what if I were a

17

member of the West Virginia legislature and I know this

18

suit has been pending for a long time, and they have hired

19

very expensive lawyers to sue the State, there's a lot of

20

money involved, and I would really -- I think this is a

21

dumb law that's on the books, and I would really like to

22

change that law, but then the fire marshal comes to me and

going to be liable for millions of dollars in attorneys'

money.

3

Why would we want to distort the legislative

4

process in West Virginia by making a change in the law

that the members of the legislature think desirable costly

because of the existence of a lawsuit, even though the

State believes it can win the lawsuit?

later that it also applies in settlements and consent

19

a situation in which there is a legislative change that

20

would -- the legislature would want to make as a matter of

has available.

QUESTION:

MS. BRINKMANN:

QUESTION:

Why wouldn't it, Ms. Brinkmann?

8

MS. BRINKMANN:

Because it would not establish

that that change was made as a result of the lawsuit.

10

There's two aspects of the causation, Mr. Chief

11

Justice.

12

then there's also the question more of a proximate

causation, that that change has to be because of the

QUESTION:

Yes, but except that a typical

MS. BRINKMANN:

MS. BRINKMANN:

But, Your Honor, it depends.

If

the court incorporates that, otherwise you just have a

You have to go prove the validity of that

There will simply be the voluntary provision of the

MR. CLEEK:

Your Honor, this Court has

13

recognized in Maher and Farrar as well, and also it's

14

indicated in the legislative history, that settlements

15

constitute prevailing party status.

16

Now, if your question is, if the State or any

not enter into an enforceable agreement, is that going to

judge would approve it, and the defendant agrees in that

kind -- in a settled case to provide exactly what the

plaintiff wants, there'll be no more settlements.

6

So it won't affect the split-the-difference

settlement, but it will affect the give-them-what-they-

9

MR. CLEEK:

It could affect, in candor, a

settlement where a regulation is involved or where a

11

policy is involved, because in that case it is arguable

12

that the governmental body could simply stop the conduct

The catalyst theory

What about the House report?

I took

7

it that Hewitt and the House report in particular are

thinking of the case where a complaint is filed charging X

as unlawful, and before there is an adjudication the

defendant ceases the unlawful practice, and it says in

that instance the Court should still award fees, even

12

though it concludes that no formal relief is necessary.

Now, as I read that report, I thought it

certainly favors your opponents, and then the question

would be whether this Court should credit it.

QUESTION:

Well, in looking -- right in this,

where it says voluntarily ceasing, I didn't think it was

formal, but then I thought many of these statutes were

11

passed at a time where civil rights violations all over

12

the country were common, and many of the statutes were

13

passed to end widespread violations of civil rights.

14

Now, with that in the back of my mind, would I

must be read together.

attributing a House report to the entire Congress.

would much rather look to the language of the statute, but

isn't it -- if you look to the reports, isn't it possible

that when whoever wrote it was speaking about voluntary

cessation of the unlawful conduct, he was talking about

voluntary cessation of conduct acknowledged to be

21

unlawful, that there's a difference between ceasing it

By the way, I'm not sure whether that makes the

MR. CLEEK:

Your Honor, that argument has been

made by the petitioners and their amici in this case, and

what I think you're suggesting is, if you have a

5

settlement that Congress has recognized and this Court has

recognized grants prevailing party status, then if you

7

have a voluntary act that affords the same sort of relief,

8

how is that any different.

9

The difference is this.

could possibly tie it to the litigation is the

acknowledgement that the litigation was correct.

4

The acknowledgement, since you don't have a

written settlement, that, indeed, our action was unlawful

6

and therefore we're going to stop it, at least that ties

7

it to the litigation somehow.

8

MR. CLEEK:

9

QUESTION:

That would be correct.
Whereas just stopping it, without any

10

acknowledgement that what you were doing was wrong, you

11

have no idea whether the litigation was what produced it,

12

or whether the West Virginia legislature just decided this

13

was a stupid law, which is frankly what I think it

14

thought.

15

MR. CLEEK:

Your Honor, and let me follow up

16

that with this comment.

If Congress, when it enacted

17

1988, understood the difficulties that the courts faced in

18

controlling their dockets, and congested dockets, if they

understood the difficulties that this catalyst theory

might present in this kind of case, where you may be

The only way that I can respond to that is to suggest what

8

I suggested to Justice Breyer's question, is that all

9

these cases must be read in context.

QUESTION:

12

MR. CLEEK:

14

If you isolate that

language out, then you have difficulty.

11

13

That language

Wasn't that language dicta?
It was, Your Honor.

It was not

necessary for the resolution of that case.
And let me say this about Hewitt, and Your

15

Honor, of course, this is perhaps suggesting hypotheticals

16

one ought to be entertaining from the Court, but if we

17

took Hewitt out, let's assume that Hewitt never happened,

18

and you read Hanrahan and Hensley and Rhodes and Texas

19

Teachers and Farrar, there is no support in any of those

20

cases for the catalyst theory.

23

judgment, but it was just for $1, so anything that Farrar

24

said would have been the clearest dictum, because there

25

was a prevailing party, not by much, and there were no

The only support --

Well, it wasn't at issue.
There was a judgment.

It wasn't

There was a

fees, because the Court said, I'm not going to give you

2

attorneys' fees for a $1 judgment.

3

MR. CLEEK:

4

QUESTION:

5
6

That's correct, Your Honor.
But there was no doubt that there was

a prevailing party in that case.
MR. CLEEK:

In fact, this Court found that they

7

were a prevailing party because even the $1 caused a

8

change in the legal relationship between the parties,

9

because the defendant had to pay something to the

10

plaintiff he otherwise wouldn't have had to pay, but

11

Farrar still -- and you know, if we have dicta in Hewitt,

12

and dicta in Farrar, both sides are arguing that they have

13

some value, but if we look at Farrar just for the purpose

14

of establishing what this Court said is a definition of

15

the parameters of prevailing party, if we look at it just

16

for that purpose alone, then I think that the argument

17

that we made that it's not consistent with the catalyst

18

theory is very easily made and very easily understood.

19

Now, if the Court was willing to say --

20

QUESTION:

Well, I thought you accepted that

21

this Court had said in Friends of the Earth that the

22

catalyst theory remained an open question and that Farrar

23

did not deal with it.

24

Friends of the Earth, and I didn't think --

25

MR. CLEEK:

That's what the Court said in

Yes.

QUESTION:

2

MR. CLEEK:

-- you were quarreling with that.
I'm not quarreling with that.

The

language is clear in Friends of the Earth that Farrar was

not a catalyst case, and I'm not arguing that Farrar was a

What I'm arguing is that Farrar set out

So we have -QUESTION:

-- simply whether or not someone who

received the nominal damages a prevailing party?

MR. CLEEK:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. CLEEK:

That's correct, Your Honor.
Okay.
And the Court found that they were a

15

prevailing party --

16

QUESTION:

17

were not a prevailing party?

18

MR. CLEEK:

And the holding below was that they

That's correct and, of course, the

19

Court continued to say that under those circumstances,

20

even to be given that designation was insufficient to

21

award fees, because there were just some cases where there

22

was no entitlement.

QUESTION:

24
25

Refresh my memory.

In Farrar, did

they affirm or reverse the judgment?
MR. CLEEK:

You reversed the lower court, I

believe, Your Honor.

3

QUESTION:

We held there was a prevailing party,

but didn't we say there were no fees that were due?

4

MR. CLEEK:

That's correct, and I think what the

5

lower court had said, that there wasn't prevailing party

6

status, that's my recollection, and there was some

7

difference there.

8

had found that there were no fees, no entitlement to fees

9

and, of course, Farrar found that there were no

We had -- essentially the lower court

entitlement to fees as well.

11

If there are no further questions --

QUESTION:

13

why?

14

no entitlement?

15

The lower court found no entitlement,

I don't recall that.

MR. CLEEK:

Why did the lower court find

It seems to me, Your Honor, in

Farrar that --

MR. CLEEK:

Right, that it was just such a --

We found it was a prevailing party, but no

entitlement because of --

No, we found that they were a

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WEBSTER J. ARCENEAUX, III

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

13

MR. ARCENEAUX:

14

Mr. Cleek was assuming a hypothetical.

15
16

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
I want

to assume a hypothetical for the Court as well.
Let us assume this Court does not accept the

17

catalyst theory.

This Court is concerned with the issue

18

of administration of justice, and I am concerned that if

19

this Court does not accept the catalyst theory, then the

20

game's been shifted we talked about that Justice Scalia

21

pointed out, where a defendant that might be incredibly

22

guilty on the eve of trial, after the plaintiff has

23

incurred a lot of expenses, can moot the case out.

24

On the other hand, there may be motivation on

25

the plaintiff's part to start engaging in gamesmanship.

1

We recognize that once we had the consent or the agreed

2

order, we did not have damages.

3

down, the people weren't thrown out, we had no damages, so

4

we stipulated to take damages out of it.

5

The home wasn't shut

Had we known that this rule might have jumped up

6

at us, we might have thought otherwise about the damages

7

issue, so there can be gamesmanship on both sides if we

8

don't have the catalyst theory.

9

We think -- and one of the points that seems to

10

get lost, we often talk about this as if the catalyst

11

theory doesn't exist, but the fact of the matter is, the

12

catalyst theory has existed.

13

years, and the courts have not had trouble.

14

at the cases, the courts are able to apply the causation

15

test.

16

It has been applied for 30
When you look

They are able to deal with these issues.

The district courts are equipped to make these

17

decisions, and they have made these decisions for 30

18

years, and we think that the Fourth Circuit is wrong, and

19

this Court should find, inasmuch as it did in the Laidlaw

20

case, that Farrar had no catalytic effect, that the Fourth

21

Circuit has misread Farrar, and that we should have our

22

opportunity, our day in court to present the motion for

23

attorneys' fees.
