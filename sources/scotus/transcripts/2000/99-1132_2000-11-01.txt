CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 99-1132, Illinois v. Charles McArthur.

5

Mr. Bertocchi.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL D. BERTOCCHI

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

Thank you.

Good morning,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

10

In this case, a police officer who had probable

11

cause to believe that readily destructible evidence was

12

concealed in Charles McArthur's home secured that home

13

from the outside while his partner went to see the judge

14

to get a warrant.

15

Officer Love, prevented what, as it turned out, would have

16

been the certain destruction of that evidence.

17
18

By doing so, the police officer,

He also avoided doing something that this Court
has often condemned in its Fourth Amendment cases.

19

QUESTION:

May I stop you there, please,

20

counsel?

21

of the day the respondent would have entered the home and

22

destroyed the evidence if he'd had the chance, but the

23

police didn't know that at the time, did they?

24
25

As it turns out, and you mentioned, at the end

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

I don't think they knew it,

certainly, Your Honor.
3

1
2

QUESTION:

And I think that we have to take the

case on the assumption that they didn't know.

3

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

4

QUESTION:

5

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

6

QUESTION:

7

Isn't that right?
I agree.

So I don't think we should look at

the fact that he said that later in resolving the case.

8
9

Correct.

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

Your Honor, by mentioning

that I didn't mean to suggest that the Court should.

I

10

think that demonstrates something about the fact that

11

people can intend to destroy evidence without telegraphing

12

it.

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

14

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

But I agree that the

15

officers certainly didn't know it.

16

say so.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. McArthur didn't

Well, can we take the case on the

18

assumption that there's a substantial risk that in this

19

context he would have destroyed the evidence?

20

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

I agree, Your Honor.

I

21

believe that the police believed that, that they were

22

concerned about the risk to evidence, but I can't say that

23

they could read his mind.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, but didn't the evidence that

they had before them establish at least exigent
4

1

circumstances?

2

circumstances exception?

3

Could they have gone in on an exigent

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

Well, Your Honor, I believe

4

in this case they could have, although I would emphasize

5

again that they never actually went in at all except

6

briefly with --

7

QUESTION:

No, I realize that, but I mean, in

8

deciding the reasonableness of the -- of blocking the

9

individual from going back in, it seems to me we ought to

10

consider that they could have gone in themselves under an

11

exigent circumstances theory, if that is so.

12

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

I believe that is so, Your

13

Honor, and certainly it demonstrates that the intrusion

14

that we're asking for here is amply justified.

15

QUESTION:

But then you run up against your

16

opponent's argument that the police themselves created the

17

exigent circumstances, because they told -- they told the,

18

later, defendant that his wife had snitched on him, and if

19

he didn't know that, then he wouldn't have any incentive.

20

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

I understand that argument,

21

Your Honor, and I don't believe it applies in this case

22

for a couple of reasons.

23

officers had genuine concern sufficient to allow them to

24

impound, certainly, and perhaps to go in even before they

25

spoke with him.

One is that I believe the

5

1

Mrs. McArthur told the officers that she had

2

just seen Mr. McArthur conceal the marijuana under the

3

couch.

4

house, and I believe that that told the officers not only

5

that there was marijuana inside, which provided them with

6

probable cause to search, I think that also demonstrated

7

to them that Mr. McArthur, or at least would give them

8

reasonable grounds to suspect that Mr. McArthur was

9

interested in preventing them from getting access to the

She told them that when she came out into the

10

evidence and had already at least once translated that

11

idea into action.

12

QUESTION:

Well, I want to know how fine you're

13

slicing it when you say reasonable cause to believe.

14

you mean probable cause?

15

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

16

QUESTION:

Do

No, I don't, Your Honor.

Well, if you don't mean probable

17

cause, then I think your response to Justice Ginsburg is,

18

there were no exigent circumstances sufficient to support

19

an entry but for the police's statement to him that they

20

knew about the drugs and they wanted to go in.

21

right?

22
23
24
25

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

Am I

I -- Your Honor, I -- that

isn't what I intended to say, I'm sorry.
QUESTION:

Okay.

Now, assume they did not --

assume we remove from consideration the fact that they
6

1

told him that the wife had snitched on him and they would

2

like to search.

3

exigent circumstances search?

Did they have probable cause to make an

4

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

5

believe -- I do believe that they did.

6

believe --

7
8

QUESTION:

Your Honor, I don't
I don't -- I do

And the reasons are?

The reasons

are?

9

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

The reasons are, Your Honor,

10

that they -- as I indicated, that they had -- they were

11

aware that Mr. McArthur, while they were present, and he

12

knew they were present, had already taken action to

13

conceal the evidence from them, and I think it would be

14

reasonable for them to believe that he might take

15

additional action, or decide that that action wasn't

16

sufficient.

17

QUESTION:

18

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

19

22

In addition, Your Honor, I

would suggest to the Court that --

20
21

Okay.

QUESTION:

When you say he knew they were

present -GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

Yes, Your Honor.

He -- the

23

police had been outside for some time while Mrs. McArthur

24

was moving her items out, and they wouldn't have been very

25

good peacekeepers if they didn't let it be known, or she
7

1

didn't let it be known that the police were outside while

2

she was moving her items out.

3

So at the time Mrs. McArthur came out and said

4

all this, the police knew that Mr. McArthur knew they had

5

been outside for some time, that they were in the company

6

of his wife, who was angry at him and might be motivated

7

to snitch on him, and she also told them that he had

8

already taken at least some action to conceal marijuana,

9

the marijuana that was inside, from them.

10

QUESTION:

Did she indicate how much marijuana,

11

because much is made by McArthur that this was -- this is

12

very small stakes.

13

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

Your Honor, she did not say

14

anything -- there is no testimony in the record that she

15

said anything other than that it was marijuana, and that

16

is really one of our central points in response to that

17

argument, is that the officers had no reason to know just

18

what the stakes would be for any number of reasons.

19

of them was that.

20

One

It is certainly unlikely that if they had asked

21

her Mrs. McArthur could have said 2.3 grams.

22

might have said, a little, but a little can rise to the

23

level of a felony in Illinois, and even a little little is

24

a jailable crime.

25

QUESTION:

At most she

But in any case she didn't say
8

1

anything one way or the other about quantity --

2

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

Correct.

3

QUESTION:

4

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

5

QUESTION:

6

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

7

Your Honors, Officer Love's conduct in this case

-- as far as the record tells us.
Correct, Your Honor.

Is that correct?
That is correct.

8

was restrained and, indeed, specifically calibrated to

9

intrude no more than necessary while giving full effect to

10

the warrant requirement, and we ask that this Court

11

approve that conduct because it will both protect both

12

evidence and privacy.

13

There are two facts that we believe demonstrate

14

that Officer Love's conduct fell clearly within the limits

15

of reasonable conduct under the Fourth Amendment.

16

them, of course, is that there was no entry necessary in

17

this case, and we believe that that substantially lesser

18

intrusion is very important.

19

Mr. McArthur's possessory interest in his home, and while

20

those interests are certainly protected by the Fourth

21

Amendment, the -- they are not -- they do not receive the

22

high level of protection that privacy interests do,

23

particularly where a home is concerned.

24
25

QUESTION:

One of

It interfered only with

May I ask if, in your view, the

length of time that it takes to get the warrant is
9

1

relevant at all?

2

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

3

QUESTION:

4

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

I believe it is, Your Honor.

And in this case, what was it?
Your Honor, I think on this

5

record the most you could say would be 2 hours, but I

6

believe that the more justified conclusion would be about

7

an hour and 15 minutes from the time the impoundment was

8

imposed to the time that the warrant was signed.

9

QUESTION:

If it took, say, 8 or 10 hours, you

10

would say that's probably unreasonable?

11

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

Your Honor, I would say that

12

was a much harder case, but it would depend on the

13

circumstances that caused it to take that long.

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

15

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

I think this is an amount of

16

time that you could almost say was per se reasonable.

17

think, in fact, that it was surprisingly brief, in --

18

particularly in light of the fact that this is a small

19

rural jurisdiction with a small police force and --

20
21
22

QUESTION:

I

But you would say the length of time

would be a relevant consideration?
GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

Certainly, Your Honor.

I

23

know the Court has said on many occasions that an

24

intrusion on Fourth Amendment rights can start off okay

25

and become unreasonable by degree.
10

1

QUESTION:

Would you also -- what is your

2

position on whether the quantity of drugs is relevant to

3

the inquiry?

4

you take one view, and an ounce of marijuana you can get a

5

little different reaction intuitively, but do you think

6

legally it should make any difference?

7

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

I mean, if it was a bomb about to explode

Your Honor, I think under

8

Welsh you can't say that it doesn't figure into the Fourth

9

Amendment calculus.

We believe that there was ample

10

justification in this case in light of the quantity of

11

marijuana.

12

legislature has decided you can go to jail for.

13

case that the county prosecutor, who is the original

14

jurisdiction prosecutor in the county, has decided was

15

worth a search warrant --

16

This is a case which the State of Illinois

QUESTION:

This is a

If it were different -- if, for

17

example -- some counties around the country don't

18

prosecute on cases like this, or maybe the quantity would

19

have to be a little smaller.

20

prosecuting minimal amounts of possession of marijuana,

21

then I take it, it would or would not be reasonable to go

22

in?

23

If they had a policy of not

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

Your Honor, I think if they

24

had a blanket policy that was known to the police

25

officers, then I think they would -- you know, before they
11

1

even got to that question they would doubt, or be sure

2

that they couldn't get the prosecutor to approve the

3

search warrant in the first place.

4
5

QUESTION:

Could they have arrested this

defendant without a warrant, without an arrest warrant --

6

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

7

QUESTION:

8

Yes, Your Honor.

-- based on the information that they

had?

9

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

I believe that they could

10

have.

I believe they had probable cause both to search

11

the house and to arrest Mr. McArthur.

12
13

QUESTION:

Mr. Bertocchi, how far did the police

have to go geographically to get a warrant in this case?

14

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

Your Honor, I am not aware

15

of that.

16

that Sullivan is the county seat of Moultrie County, so

17

they didn't have to leave the town of Sullivan to get to

18

the courthouse.

19

I know that Mr. McArthur lived in Sullivan, and

QUESTION:

Mr. Bertocchi, I guess your case is

20

easy if you assume, as you do, that they had authority to

21

enter without a warrant on the basis of exigent

22

circumstances, but assuming I don't agree with you on that

23

point, I'm concerned about complicating the criminal law

24

more than is necessary.

25

You're asking us to establish some standards
12

1

below the exigent circumstances standard which would

2

dispense with a warrant, and you're saying if you don't

3

actually go into the house we want yet another test that's

4

a little bit less than exigent circumstances.

5

sure that human beings are capable of entertaining as many

6

variations and figuring out what is less than exigent

7

circumstances but still enough to justify this.

8
9

I'm not

Why shouldn't we just have one single rule?
It's an exigent circumstances rule.

If there are exigent

10

circumstances, you can either go in the house or exclude

11

the homeowner from going back in himself.

12

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

Your Honor, I agree that

13

impoundment does present something of a complication, but

14

I don't think it's that serious, and I think that the test

15

is not all that different, because it's a balancing test

16

ultimately, always.

17

distinguish, as does --

18

QUESTION:

I think that in this case we also

Well, it's not a balancing test with

19

exigent circumstances.

If there are exigent circumstances

20

you can go in.

21

it a really expensive house, or is it a less-expensive

22

house, or, you know, is this person really concerned with

23

his privacy, or is he the kind of guy who leaves his

24

window shades up anyway?

25

there are exigent circumstances, you go in.

You don't have to say, you know, well, is

You don't balance anything.

13

If

1

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

2

QUESTION:

I understand --

And when you have that test the

3

courts know how to deal with it.

4

flat rule, if there are exigent circumstances, you can

5

either go in or you can stop him from going in?

6
7
8
9
10

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

Why don't we just have a

Well, Your Honor, it's our

position -QUESTION:

Life is too complicated.

We can't

engage in all of these myriad levels of police activity.
GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

Your Honor, if the Court

11

were to agree with me that exigent circumstances were --

12

particularized exigent circumstances were present here,

13

sufficient to allow an entry, that would be very

14

satisfactory, because I'm sure that would result in the --

15

QUESTION:

But the question presented is, is it

16

reasonable under the Fourth Amendment for police officers

17

who have probable cause to believe a residence contains

18

evidence enough to secure the residence from the outside,

19

so your question certainly assumes the existence of

20

probable cause.

21

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

Yes, Your Honor.

It doesn't really say anything about

exigent circumstances.
GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

Your Honor, our position is

that no specific or particularized exigent circumstances
14

1

were required to do what Officer Love did.

2

QUESTION:

3

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

4
5

You say probable cause is enough.
Probable cause is enough

that you don't have to make an entry, yes, Your Honor.
Your Honors, as I was indicating in response to

6

Justice Stevens, the intrusion in this case lasted a

7

surprisingly brief amount of time, but another important

8

aspect of its limitation is that it was always intended

9

only as a step on the way to getting a warrant.

10

Impoundment is really not capable of analytical

11

separation from getting a search warrant.

12

its execution which is designed to assure that if there is

13

evidence in the house at the time probable cause arises,

14

it will still be there by the time the judge -- the

15

officers come back with the warrant if the judge signs it.

16

QUESTION:

It is a step in

Suppose that the wife had told the

17

police officers not that he had hidden some contraband

18

under the sofa but, rather, that he had it in his pocket.

19

Are we going to have to, in the next case, ask whether,

20

although the police could not arrest him without a warrant

21

on the basis of just that probable cause, they could

22

nonetheless prevent him from putting his hand in his

23

pocket or, you know, follow him around and make sure that

24

he doesn't put his hand in his pocket, which is a lesser

25

intrusion than arresting him, arguably a lesser intrusion
15

1

than stopping him -- I mean, is there any end to the

2

number of variations of lesser, lesser, lesser intrusion

3

that we'll be confronted with?

4

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

Well, Your Honor, in this

5

case I think if -- that once he had come outside the house

6

they could have arrested him because they had probable

7

cause to arrest him and then, incident to that, I think

8

they could have reached into his pocket.

9

situations where there is probable cause to arrest,

So in those

10

personal search issues are going to be subsumed in search

11

of the person incident to arrest.

12
13
14

QUESTION:

You think they didn't need an arrest

warrant, they could just have -GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

I believe that when they had

15

this -- that -- the record demonstrates that Mr. McArthur

16

came out of his house to speak with the officers, and I

17

believe that at that point he was in a public place and

18

could be arrested without a warrant, yes, Your Honor.

19

QUESTION:

Of course, your theory, I take it, is

20

that he could have been arrested in the house without a

21

warrant because the indication that the police had was

22

that he was possessing drugs inside, but they didn't have

23

particularized knowledge that the amount of drugs was

24

only -- only carried the offense to the misdemeanor level,

25

so I take it you would have said he could have gone -16

1

they could have gone in and arrested without a warrant.

2
3

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

I believe that -- I believe

that they could have, again based on the exigent --

4

QUESTION:

Why shouldn't -- given the fact that

5

we do have -- we do make a distinction between arrest with

6

or without warrant in one's own home, why shouldn't the

7

police have the burden of demonstrating that they had

8

probable cause to believe that the drugs were in a felony

9

quantity before they went in to arrest?

10

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

11

in this instance had they gone in to --

12

QUESTION:

Your Honor, I believe that

No, but even apart from this, and

13

just as a general rule, why shouldn't that be the general

14

rule, that the police would have to establish a felony

15

level before they go into a house to arrest without a

16

warrant?

17

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

Your Honor, I believe that

18

in some cases that might very well be a difficult rule to

19

administer, and I think this is a good example of that,

20

Your Honor.

21

have been able to give them, even if they had asked, the

22

detail --

23

I don't think Mrs. McArthur would likely

QUESTION:

Well, that's right, and therefore

24

they couldn't have gone in.

It would not be difficult to

25

administer, it would be easier to administer, but you'd
17

1

lose.

2

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

Your Honor, I believe that

3

they did have sufficient cause in this case had they

4

needed to enter to effectuate this impoundment, but I

5

don't believe that they needed it to do it in the way that

6

they did.

7
8
9

If there are no other questions I would reserve
the remainder of my time, if I could.
QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Bertocchi.

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

QUESTION:

Thank you.

Mr. Roberts, we'll hear from you.

12

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

13

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

14

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

15
16
17

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
For three reasons, police officers who have

18

probable cause to believe that a residence contains

19

incriminating evidence may prevent entry for a reasonable

20

period of time in order to preserve the evidence while

21

they obtain a search warrant.

22
23
24
25

First, there's a strong law enforcement interest
in preserving evidence pending issuance of a warrant.
Second, securing the premises from the outside
by preventing entry is a limited and temporary intrusion.
18

1

Third, it's less intrusive than other means of

2

preserving evidence, and it promotes fidelity to the

3

Fourth Amendment's preference that searches be authorized

4

by a warrant.

5

When a residence contains evidence of a crime,

6

there's an inherent danger that the evidence may be

7

damaged or destroyed if people are allowed on the

8

premises, and therefore, unless police have a means to

9

protect the evidence during the time that it takes to

10

obtain a warrant, the search pursuant to the warrant may

11

often be fruitless.

12

QUESTION:

13
14

Mr. Roberts, do you think all

evidence is fungible?
MR. ROBERTS:

No, all evidence is not fungible,

15

Your Honor, but almost all evidence is capable of

16

alteration or destruction, or damage in some way.

17
18

QUESTION:

Is all evidence that's capable of

alteration or destruction fungible?

19

MR. ROBERTS:

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. ROBERTS:

No.

All evidence that's capable of

22

alteration or destruction isn't fungible either, but

23

there's a sufficient inherent danger of some kind of

24

damage with -- damage or destruction of evidence under the

25

cases to warrant asking for some particularized -QUESTION:

Let me make the question a little

3

more precise.

4

into the analysis at all in your view?

5

Does the seriousness of the offense weigh

MR. ROBERTS:

Certainly not when all we're

6

talking about is temporarily preventing entry for a

7

limited period of time.

8
9

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, you say that, you know,

there's a great law enforcement interest in preserving the

10

evidence, but there's also a considerable interest on the

11

part of the individual in going into his own home.

12

MR. ROBERTS:

13

QUESTION:

Yes, and --

What if he tells the police officer,

14

gee, I have to get back in there, I have something on the

15

stove that's going to burn.

16

in there that I have to attend to.

17

Or, you know, I have a child

Now, are we going to have to weigh all of those

18

additional factors in this subtle balancing test once we

19

abandon the exigent circumstances rule and ask in each

20

case, well, this isn't just getting back into his home,

21

it's getting back into his home to turn off his computer,

22

or to take care of a child.

23

trying to balance these things all the time.

24

stick with the exigent circumstances rule?

25

MR. ROBERTS:

We're going to go crazy
Why not just

Our rule that we're proposing here
20

1

that has already been reflected in cases involving

2

containers, vehicles, and evidence in plain view, and the

3

Court suggested in dicta it applies to securing residences

4

as well, is easily applied.

5

probable cause to believe that the residence contains

6

evidence of a crime, and if there is probable cause to

7

believe that, then there is a consequent --

8

QUESTION:

9

needs taking care of, right?

The issue is, is there

Even if there's a child in there that

10

MR. ROBERTS:

11

QUESTION:

12

going to take that position?

13

Well, the Court's made clear --

That's a clear rule, then.

MR. ROBERTS:

You're

The Court's made clear that any

14

search or seizure, even one that's justified by a warrant,

15

can be rendered unreasonable by the manner in which it's

16

executed, and one factor that you would consider in

17

determining whether the seizure --

18

QUESTION:

Well, that's not a manner of

19

executing it.

20

into the house, but you're saying it isn't just the house

21

you have to consider, it's also all these other factors,

22

why he wants to go in, right?

23

They're executing it by not letting him go

MR. ROBERTS:

No, Your Honor.

The basic

24

principle would still apply, but the police officers have

25

to act reasonably.

That's, the fundamental principle of
21

1

the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, and if under the

2

circumstances reasonableness required some accommodation

3

of the needs that were -- that the occupants were impeded

4

from addressing because of the seizure, the police would

5

have to reasonably address that.

6

inside, I think that would create exigent circumstances

7

that would justify them going in to take care of the child

8

if there were some need to do that.

9

QUESTION:

If there was a child

But in effect you're saying that yes,

10

balancing is going to have to be done in the field, so I

11

think your answer to Justice Scalia is, we don't have just

12

a simple rule that if there's probable cause they can

13

impound.

14

there's probable cause they can impound, but there may be

15

circumstances which vary the permissible application of

16

that rule.

17

Your rule is, there's a general rule that if

MR. ROBERTS:

There may be circumstances which

18

require the police to take other actions to address the

19

needs as reasonable, but the fundamental rule remains the

20

same, and I don't think that is different than in any

21

other circumstance, any other kind of --

22

QUESTION:

That rule would depend on the facts

23

as they are known to the officer, even -- so that so long

24

as the homeowner says, I have a kid in there, even if he

25

doesn't have a kid in there, it would be unreasonable for
22

1

the police officer to stop him from going in, I assume.

2

MR. ROBERTS:

I think that if -- if -- unless

3

the officer had -- knew that there wasn't a kid in there,

4

which in this case he might know because the wife --

5
6

QUESTION:

Well, maybe the police officer could

go in himself and bring the kid outside.

7

MR. ROBERTS:

8

inside.

9

Justice.

He could.

He could accompany him

That's what I was trying to say before, Mr. Chief
If there was a child who was -- who needed

10

protection that much that required the respondent to

11

enter, then that would justify the police officer going in

12

in the interest of public safety.

13
14

QUESTION:

What if the child is old enough to

destroy the evidence and sees what's happening?

15

(Laughter.)

16

QUESTION:

17

child come out, too?

18
19

Can the police go in and make the

MR. ROBERTS:

If the child were outside and

wanted to go in and was old enough --

20

QUESTION:

No, no, no, the child is inside, and

21

the officer realizes, well, maybe he'll destroy the

22

evidence.

23
24
25

MR. ROBERTS:

Oh, the officer could ask the

child to come out under those circumstances.
QUESTION:

He could ask him to, but the child
23

1

says I'm too busy destroying evidence.

2

(Laughter.)

3

MR. ROBERTS:

Well then, that would certainly

4

create exigent circumstances that would justify going in

5

to secure the premises from the inside, but this case

6

involves a very different and much more limited situation,

7

where all that was necessary was to prevent entry and that

8

kind of intrusion is extremely more limited, because it's

9

only possessory interest in the premises.

It lasts only

10

long enough to get the judicial determination about

11

whether there's probable cause to search and seize, and

12

it's far less intrusive than the other alternatives.

13

For instance, if the police officers here had

14

arrested respondent, that would have invaded his personal

15

privacy and his liberty.

16

QUESTION:

The other thing I wondered about is,

17

what would have happened -- this case arose out of an

18

argument between the husband and wife, as I remember.

19

What if she changed her mind when she got to the

20

magistrate and decided not to support the probable cause

21

and they never got the warrant, would the seizure then

22

have been unlawful?

23

MR. ROBERTS:

24

QUESTION:

25

The --

Does the legality depend on the fact

that the warrant was ultimately issued?
24

1

MR. ROBERTS:

The legality depends on the

2

presence of probable cause.

3

conducted the seizure they would have had probable cause

4

and the seizure would be legal.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. ROBERTS:

7
8
9

I think at the time that they

Even if the warrant were not issued?
Even if the warrant were not

issued.
As I was saying before, the -- part of the
reason that the intrusion is so small, is limited here,

10

and that this is particularly reasonable, is that the

11

other alternatives such as arresting the occupants, such

12

as a warrantless entry, are more intrusive, involve

13

invasions of privacy.

14

providing an alternative to immediate warrantless entry

15

this external impoundment option actually encourages

16

police officers to seek a warrant before they search.

17

Court has therefore recognized a principle that the

18

interest in protecting evidence can temporarily supersede

19

possessory interest in property for the time that it takes

20

to get a warrant in a variety of contexts.

They're more serious, and by

The

21

As I noted before, the Court's done it in dictum

22

in situations involving securing premises, but the Court's

23

held that that's true in a variety of cases like container

24

cases, where the Court has held that if the police have

25

probable cause to believe the container holds evidence
25

1

they can seize the container pending a warrant to search

2

it, and the Court's held that if the police have probable

3

cause to believe that evidence that's in plain view is

4

associated with criminal activity, they can seize it.

5

The same principle that underlies that, the

6

interest in protecting the evidence, the inherent danger

7

that the evidence may be damaged or destroyed if there

8

isn't an ability to freeze the status quo while the police

9

get a warrant, the fact that the police are getting the

10

warrant here, all point to the fact that it's eminently

11

reasonable for the police to be able to secure the

12

premises from the outside for a temporary time while they

13

obtain a warrant to search.

14

If there are no further questions --

15

QUESTION:

16

Ms. Jones, we'll hear from you.

Thank you, Mr. Roberts.

17

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE F. JONES

18

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

19
20
21

MS. JONES:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:
The question presented by these facts is, what

22

analysis should this Court employ in determining under

23

what circumstances and by what method the police can seize

24

a home in order to preserve evidence of a crime?

25

The State of Illinois and the United States of
26

1

America want this Court to issue a broad rule that it is

2

always all right for police officers to seize a home on

3

the basis of probable cause alone.

4

that such a rule violates the Fourth Amendment for two

5

reasons.

6

high esteem in which this Court's decisions place the

7

home, and it is also not a logical extension of other

8

cases concerning the seizure of property.

9
10

This Court should find

First of all, it does not take into account the

QUESTION:

Well, it was suggested in Segura, I

guess, as a possible rule.

11

MS. JONES:

Your Honor, in the dicta in Segura

12

there is some suggestion that external seizure of the home

13

would have been justified in Segura's case, and perhaps

14

that is because everyone with a possessory interest in the

15

apartment in Segura was in custody and therefore the

16

police really weren't interfering with anyone's possessory

17

right.

18

In this case you do have the homeowner present,

19

and his possessory rights in the home are being

20

substantially interfered with, and the Government's test

21

of probable cause only simply does not take in to account

22

the high esteem in which the home is held and the fact

23

that it's very intrusive.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, what should the police have

done to preserve evidence that they know is at risk?
27

1

MS. JONES:

Your Honor, there were two

2

alternatives for the police in this case.

First of all,

3

once Mrs. McArthur told the officers that she saw her

4

husband slide marijuana under the couch, the first thing

5

they could have done is simply left with Mrs. McArthur,

6

went down to the courthouse, and obtained a search

7

warrant.

The second alternative was to --

8

QUESTION:

Well, but they knew of the risk of

9

destruction of the evidence.

My question is, what could

10

they do to preserve the evidence in these circumstances,

11

nothing?

12

MS. JONES:

No, Your Honor, there is nothing

13

they could do, and the reason I'm suggesting that is, in

14

Welsh v. Wisconsin the officers on that scene were faced

15

with a similar dilemma.

16

evidence of Mr. Welsh's blood alcohol level is to do what

17

they did, which was to enter the home without a warrant

18

and arrest him before his blood alcohol level went down.

19

This Court found that because that was a minor

The only way they had to preserve

20

offense, the police officers could not do that in order

21

to --

22

QUESTION:

Well, the offense in Welsh was quite

23

different than the one here.

24

colleague at any rate, this -- the -- it could -- was

25

grounds for arrest, and also he could have served time in

Here, according to your

28

1

jail.

2

MS. JONES:

Your Honor, there is a distinction

3

between the offense here and the one in Welsh.

4

a nonjailable offense, that's true.

5

C misdemeanor, which is the lowest category of crime.

6

QUESTION:

Here, we have a class

Well, is that important, Ms. Jones,

7

to your argument?

8

large stash of heroin.

9

different?

10

Welsh was

I mean, supposing there had been a

MS. JONES:

Would that make this case

Yes, Your Honor, it would make this

11

case different, for two reasons.

12

suggesting you reject the probable cause only test and

13

stick with the probable cause plus exigent circumstances

14

test, and the reason the quantity of the drugs would be

15

important is because that goes to the exigency.

16

Court observed in Welsh v. Wisconsin, the prevention of

17

the destruction of evidence is not an exigent circumstance

18

when you're talking about a minor offense.

19

then, it is when you're talking about a major crime.

20

QUESTION:

First of all, I'm

As this

Presumably,

But the police had no way of knowing

21

the quantity at that point.

I think you just told us, and

22

correct me if I'm wrong, that if the crime would be a

23

felony, then what was done here was okay.

24

premises pending receipt of a warrant by the police

25

officer.

Secure the

But if the crime is only a misdemeanor, then,
29

1

too bad, you have to take the risk that the evidence will

2

be destroyed.

3

I think that's the line you're drawing.

MS. JONES:

Two responses to that, Your Honor.

4

First of all, the line that I'm drawing is that the

5

officers have to have probable cause and exigent

6

circumstances.

7

had neither, but the line I'm asking the Court to draw

8

again is probable cause and exigent circumstances.

9

In this case, it's my position that they

QUESTION:

Well, is it exigent circumstances if

10

it's a felony but not if it's a misdemeanor?

11

I don't fathom, because I thought from your brief and from

12

what you said before that you were making a distinction

13

between lesser offenses and felonies.

14

MS. JONES:

That's what

I am, Your Honor, that's true, and

15

the reason I make the distinction is again, it's part of

16

that analysis of whether or not the exigent circumstance

17

of destruction of evidence is present.

18

what the Welsh decision suggests, that if you're trying to

19

preserve evidence of a minor crime, then the officers are

20

not justified in entering the home to preserve evidence of

21

that crime, so it's a factor of determining whether or not

22

there's an exigent circumstance of destruction of

23

evidence.

24

QUESTION:

25

MS. JONES:

That's at least

Why isn't -- sorry.
Your Honor, if I may, she had a
30

1

question before that.

2

officers knew about the quantity of marijuana at the

3

scene.

4

precisely 2.3 grams of marijuana present.

5

officers could easily have asked Mrs. McArthur about the

6

quantity she saw, and the fact that nobody really seemed

7

to be taking this incident very seriously suggests that

8

the officers knew they weren't talking about --

9
10
11

You had also asked me about if the

The officers I'm sure did not know that there were

QUESTION:

However, the

Why are they not taking it seriously?

They immediately go off to get a warrant.
MS. JONES:

Your Honor, if they -- they didn't

12

ask Mrs. McArthur questions about the quantity.

13

didn't ask her questions about whether her husband was

14

dealing drugs.

15

and they thought they had probable cause at the scene they

16

could have placed Mr. McArthur under arrest immediately.

17

Mr. McArthur evidently --

18

They

If they thought they had a serious offense

QUESTION:

Well, I'm surprised you say that no

19

one was taking this seriously when the police went to get

20

a warrant and secured the house.

21

MS. JONES:

Your Honor, they did go and get a

22

warrant, but what I'm suggesting is, you're not taking

23

about a major crime here where the police felt that they

24

had the immediate need to make an arrest of Mr. McArthur.

25

QUESTION:

Well, but you know, there's always a
31

1

great deal of second-guessing in these Fourth Amendment

2

cases.

So I think you

Yes, Your -Wouldn't an arrest have been more

intrusive?

9

MS. JONES:

10

QUESTION:

Your Honor -I would have thought so.

I would

have thought that the police were acting in a restrained

12

fashion by getting a search warrant, finding out what they

had, and then taking action.

MS. JONES:

Your Honor, I respectfully disagree

24

for two reasons.

First of all, Mr. -- or, excuse me,

25

Officer Love did not ask Mrs. McArthur that very important
32

1

question of whether she was familiar with what marijuana

2

looked like.

information from an informant about the existence of

contraband, Illinois law generally requires that you have

some indication --

MS. JONES:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

Well, wasn't a warrant obtained from

Your Honor, it was, and if you -And was it obtained without probable

cause?
MS. JONES:

No.

Your Honor, there was probable

12

cause for the search warrant, and if you compare the

13

search warrant application and the affidavit submitted --

14

you'll find those in the joint appendix, I believe

15

beginning on page 5.

16

search warrant and the affidavits, there's a lot of

17

information contained in those affidavits that were not --

18

that was not given to Officer Love at the scene.

19

If you look at the application for a

For example, in the application for a search

20

warrant the State's Attorney thinks it's important enough

21

to put in there that Mrs. McArthur is familiar with the

22

appearance of marijuana.

23

includes in there that Mrs. McArthur has seen marijuana on

24

the presence -- or on the premises several times.

25

He has

QUESTION:

All Officer Love had at the scene was

All right.

Suppose -- is it -- all

right, the wife says, I -- you know, she lives in the

10

trailer with her husband, and the wife says, he hides dope

11

under the couch, okay?

12

MS. JONES:

13

QUESTION:

And he's -- there's some there.
I'm sorry.

She -- the wife says, who lives in

14

the trailer with the husband, that her husband has put pot

under the couch.

MS. JONES:

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. JONES:

19

QUESTION:

Mm-hmm.
That's what happened.
Yes.
Okay.

Now, why wouldn't the officer

20

think that if I say goodbye, I'm going off to get a search

21

warrant, the husband would take the dope and flush it down

22

the toilet.

23

wouldn't he think that?

24
25

That's what I would think.

MS. JONES:

In fact, if he's intelligent, that's

He hadn't had time, or had he had time?

10

McArthur was aware of their presence, yet he didn't take

11

any steps to destroy the evidence.

12

13

QUESTION:

All right.

He simply hid it under

I'm just saying, is there

14

any reason why the police wouldn't think, if he gets back

15

in the house, he will go take the marijuana and put it

16

down the toilet?

17

that an unreasonable thing to think?

18

Is there anything here that would make

MS. JONES:

Your Honor, it may be a reasonable

19

thing to think, but that certainly does not then give the

20

police the power to take the next step, which is to either

21

seize the home or make a warrantless arrest.

22

QUESTION:

Why isn't that -- and this is now a

23

legal question.

I was trying to -- why isn't that an

24

exigent circumstance that would give the policeman the

25

right to go in and preserve the evidence?
35

1
2

MS. JONES:

Your Honor, the reason why it's not

is --

3

QUESTION:

4

MS. JONES:

Because?
-- this Court's holding in Vale v.

5

Louisiana suggests that evidence has to be in the process

6

of destruction before it's considered to be an exigent

7

circumstance permitting the officer to make a warrantless

8

entry inside.

9
10

QUESTION:

You mean, they've got to hear the

sound of the water flushing, or something like that --

11

(Laughter.)

12

QUESTION:

13

MS. JONES:

14

QUESTION:

-- before they can go in?
No, Your Honor.

I'm not --

No, but seriously, I mean, what --

15

how could that standard ever be satisfied in the case

16

Justice Breyer gave you, except on -- you know, some silly

17

assumption like that?

18

MS. JONES:

Your Honor, I agree that the

19

evidence having to be in the process of destruction is a

20

high standard for the police to meet, and that's why lower

21

courts have taken the Vale case and have reduced that

22

somewhat to require a fear that the evidence is in

23

imminent danger of destruction.

24
25

QUESTION:

All right, why -- going back to his

question, why wasn't there a basis for -- to conclude that
36

1

it was in imminent risk of destruction?

2

MS. JONES:

I'm sorry, I'd like to clarify.

3

you asking in my particular case, or are you asking in

4

general?

5

QUESTION:

Yes, your particular -- well, I'm

6

talking about Justice Breyer's hypo, which I think

7

responded to your case.

8

10
11

MS. JONES:

Are

First of all, the reason why this

Court should continue with that standard that the evidence
has to be in imminent danger of destruction -QUESTION:

No, but assuming we -- assuming that

12

is the standard, why isn't it satisfied in the

13

hypothetical that you gave, which I think is descriptive

14

of what we know about this case?

15

MS. JONES:

Your Honor, the reason the officers

16

should not have considered the evidence to be in imminent

17

danger of destruction is, again, Mr. McArthur took no

18

steps with regard to that --

19

QUESTION:

No, but you're saying that -- and I'm

20

not quite sure why, but you're saying we know for a fact

21

that at a given moment he had not taken a step to destroy

22

the evidence, but the hypothetical is, and I think the

23

facts of the -- in the record support the hypothetical,

24

that the wife from whom he is estranged and who has an

25

obviously rocky relationship with him, has just been in
37

1

the trailer, has seen the drugs, is now outside talking to

2

police officers.

3

Isn't a person of any intelligence going to say,

4

she is very likely to tell them what she saw, I'd better

5

get rid of the drugs?

6

given moment he had actually started flushing them away.

7

The question is whether there was probable cause to

8

believe that he would do that, and why isn't there, or why

9

wasn't there in this case?

10

The question is not whether at any

MS. JONES:

Your Honor, first of all -- I

11

believe this is in the joint appendix, and I'm sorry I

12

don't remember the page number for this, but Officer Love

13

or Mr. McArthur, one of them was asked the question

14

whether or not Mrs. McArthur saw him conceal the

15

marijuana, and nobody knew the answer to that, so first of

16

all maybe Mr. McArthur --

17

QUESTION:

Well, she had come out and said,

18

there are drugs under the sofa, after having been in the

19

trailer extracting personal possessions.

20

reasonable to assume, to infer that she had seen them?

21

She'd just been there.

22
23
24
25

MS. JONES:

Isn't it

Your Honor, I would disagree that

it's reasonable to infer that she saw them.
QUESTION:

All right.

was no probable cause.
38

So your claim is there

1

MS. JONES:

Your Honor, I'm claiming there was

2

no probable cause and no exigent circumstances, and a

3

probable --

4
5
6

QUESTION:

I thought you had conceded that there

was probable cause to get the warrant.
MS. JONES:

There was probable cause to get the

7

warrant because the information that was given to Judge

8

Flannel was different than the information that Officer

9

Love had at the time that he made the determination to

10

seize the home.

11

QUESTION:

All right.

Now what I'm trying to --

12

QUESTION:

Well, could I come to the question

13

presented here, which -- I had thought, frankly, that the

14

question presented posed neither the issue of exigent

15

circumstances, nor the issue of probable cause.

16

it seems to me this is not a hard case if there were

17

exigent circumstances.

18

you would acknowledge, I think, that if he could have gone

19

into the house, he could do the lesser thing of stopping

20

your client from going into the house.

21

MS. JONES:

I mean,

If you -- if the police officer --

Your Honor, yes, if probable cause

22

and exigent circumstances --

23

QUESTION:

24

MS. JONES:

25

QUESTION:

Right.
-- existed, yes.
So I mean, there's no reason to take
39

1

this case if there were exigent circumstances.

2

probable cause, the way I read the question presented, is

3

it reasonable under the Fourth Amendment for police

4

officers who have probable cause to believe that a

5

residence contains evidence that could readily be

6

destroyed, to secure the residence by preventing its

7

occupant and others from entering unaccompanied.

8
9
10
11

And as for

I thought that -- you're not conceding the
existence of probable cause to believe that a residence
contained evidence that could readily be destroyed?
MS. JONES:

Your Honor, I'm not conceding that

12

probable cause existed in this case, and I'm also

13

asserting that a rule that permits external seizure of the

14

home on probable cause only does not take into account,

15

first of all, this Court's holdings with respect to the

16

home and second of all, does not really weigh, or doesn't

17

fairly balance the State's interest in prosecuting the

18

particular kind of issue.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

Did you challenge the question

presented in your brief in opposition?
MS. JONES:

Your Honor, we -- we're still

22

sticking with the question presented, whether this is

23

reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.

24
25

QUESTION:

Yes, and -- but it is -- is it

reasonable under the -- for police officers who have
40

1

probable cause, so that is the premise of the question

2

presented, that the police officers have probable cause.

3

Unless you disputed that, you're not in a position now to

4

challenge probable cause.

5

MS. JONES:

Your Honor, I understand what the

6

question presented is and, as a general rule, we disagree

7

that that ought to be the rule that applies in all

8

seizure-of-the-home cases.

9

State of Illinois and the United States of America is

The Court, or excuse me, the

10

asking this Court to permit seizures of the home on

11

probable cause only, and it is our contention that this

12

Court should not adopt such a rule.

13

QUESTION:

Well now, that is obviously an

14

argument you're very much entitled to make, but I think

15

you've been making a different one, that there was no

16

probable cause, and I think it's questionable whether

17

you're entitled to make that argument here.

18

MS. JONES:

Your Honor, I guess what I'm doing

19

is, I'm suggesting that no matter which rule you adopt,

20

the one advocated by the State or the one that we're

21

presenting, when you apply that rule to our case in

22

determining whether or not the Illinois Appellate Court

23

should be affirmed, I'm suggesting to you reasons that, no

24

matter which rule you adopt, the decision of the Illinois

25

court -41

1

QUESTION:

Well, you're basically arguing, then,

2

if you say there's no probable -- that the decision should

3

be affirmed on an alternate ground?

4

MS. JONES:

5

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, I'm -Well, Ms. Jones, how can you do that?

6

The Appellate Court of Illinois found that the police had

7

probable cause here.

8

that.

You didn't take a cross-appeal from

9

QUESTION:

In fact, at page 7 of your --

10

QUESTION:

I would assume we would accept that

11

finding.

12

no probable cause at the scene.

13

contrary to what the Illinois, Appellate Court of Illinois

14

found, and contrary to the assumption made in the question

15

on certiorari.

16

I don't know why you're here arguing there was

QUESTION:

That seems to be both

In fact, in your brief in opposition

17

you said, although probable cause existed, and the police,

18

so forth, so on.

19

opposition, you assumed there was probable cause.

20

You did, I think in your brief in

MS. JONES:

Your Honor, again, we're not

21

contesting probable cause to issue the search warrant, and

22

that's true the Illinois Appellate Court --

23

QUESTION:

Well, but the question presented

24

says, is it reasonable under the Fourth Amendment for a

25

police officer who had probable cause to believe a -- this
42

1

is probable cause for the police officers to act.

2

MS. JONES:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.
So the fact you say you concede

4

there's probable cause to issue the search warrant doesn't

5

really get to that point, does it?

6
7

MS. JONES:

You have to look at

the probable cause at the time that the home was seized.

8
9

No, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Precisely, and that's what the

question raises, and that's what the lower courts found

10

against you.

11

opposition.

12

That's what you've conceded in your brief in

MS. JONES:

Your Honor, in our brief in

13

opposition we do state that the Illinois Appellate Court

14

was incorrect in finding that we never contested probable

15

cause.

16

QUESTION:

We're talking about your brief in

17

opposition to the petition, not the brief in opposition on

18

the merits, and you do say on page 7 of your brief in

19

opposition to the petition, and that's the basis on which

20

we decide whether or not to accept these petitions, what

21

is the issue presented.

22

taken this case to decide whether in -- on these

23

particular facts there was probable cause or not.

24

not the kind of thing we normally do here.

25

We don't -- we wouldn't have

That's

But you had said in your opposition, although
43

1

probable cause existed, and the police entry was made

2

peaceably.

3

warrant was issued, and I took that to mean accepting the

4

question presented, is it reasonable for police officers

5

who have probable cause to believe.

6

contest that, you should have made that clear when you

7

opposed the petition.

8

You're obviously talking about before the

9

MS. JONES:

If you were going to

Your Honor, again, let me state that

I do accept the question presented as it is, and it's our

10

argument that this Court should not adopt a rule that

11

permits a seizure of the home on probable cause alone.

12

QUESTION:

All right --

13

QUESTION:

Can you tell me this -- out of a

14

very -- say, just a person who knew nothing about the law

15

approaches this and says, the wife says there's -- he put

16

some pot under the sofa.

17

door and says, did you put pot under the sofa?

18

no.

19

Okay?

The policeman then goes to the
He says,

Off to get a search warrant.
If I were a policeman I would think, he's going

20

to flush that right down the toilet.

21

off, right?

22

MS. JONES:

23

QUESTION:

That's where we left

Okay.
Okay.

Now, I would think that

24

instead of going into the house, which I'm not sure why he

25

couldn't have done it, he says, look, I'll just keep you
44

1

outside the house.

2

house.

3

Amendment medal, instead of Fourth Amendment criticism,

4

because what he's doing is, he's trying to do the least

5

restrictive thing possible consistent with the evidence

6

being preserved.

7

That way I don't have to go into the

I would think he might have gotten a Fourth

Now, why isn't what he did a good thing rather

8

than a bad thing from a Fourth Amendment point of view,

9

and what is the case that makes it impossible for him to

10
11

do that thing?
MS. JONES:

Your Honor, first of all, if you

12

adopt that rule, then you're agreeing with the State and

13

the United States of America that probable --

14

QUESTION:

I haven't said what a rule was.

I

15

just wanted to say, the common sense of it seeming to be

16

that he should keep the person outside rather than go in

17

the house, and the only alternative being that you have to

18

let these people who have marijuana in violation of the

19

law destroy the evidence.

20

alternatives.

21

MS. JONES:

Those seem to me to be the two

Your Honor, if he's keeping the

22

person outside of the home because he believes it contains

23

marijuana and he's concerned that the marijuana is going

24

to be destroyed --

25

QUESTION:

Right.
45

1

MS. JONES:

-- then he's making the seizure on

2

probable cause and exigent circumstances, and that's the

3

test that we want this Court to adopt with respect to

4

seizures of the home, and --

5

QUESTION:

I don't understand.

I'm saying why

6

exactly can't he just keep the person outside?

7

say from a Fourth Amendment point of view you'd say yes,

8

he can keep the person outside because it's the least

9

restrictive way to preserve the evidence.

10
11

The only

alternative is to let him preserve the evidence.
Now, the thing that would be wrong with that

12

hypothetical rule is what?

13

just want to get what's the objection to it.

14

I would

MS. JONES:

I'm not saying I adopt it.

I

Your Honor, if there's probable

15

cause and exigent circumstances, there's nothing wrong

16

with that, and also what the Court should keep in mind is

17

external seizure of the home may not always be --

18

QUESTION:

19

wrong with my rule.

20

All right, so you say there's nothing

Now, you must think there's something wrong with

21

it, because you want to come out the other way.

22

thing you'd say was wrong with it was because he didn't

23

have probable cause.

24

second thing you think is wrong with it is because the

25

circumstances don't justify it.

We've discussed that enough.

Now, one

46

The

1

You use this word exigent, but the reason why

2

they don't justify it, what he's got before him is, the

3

wife's told him there's pot under the sofa, the man lives

4

in a trailer, he's told the man he's looking for the pot,

5

and his knowledge of human nature.

6

the things he has before him.

7
8
9

MS. JONES:

All right.

Those are

Now, why isn't that enough?

If you're asking me why that isn't

exigent circumstances in this particular case -QUESTION:

Asking you why that isn't enough to

10

justify keeping the man outside the trailer so he won't

11

destroy the evidence.

12

MS. JONES:

That's my question.
Probable cause and exigent

13

circumstances would be sufficient to seize a home.

14

I'm arguing is, that's the rule we want you to adopt,

15

probable cause and exigent circumstances.

16

What

Now, when that's specifically applied to our

17

case, the reason there are no exigent circumstances here

18

are twofold.

19

the exigency of the destruction of evidence, and several

20

lower courts have held that when police officers create

21

the exigency of destruction of evidence, they cannot then

22

use that exigency to turn around and enter a person's home

23

without a warrant in order to preserve that evidence.

One, Officer Love is the person that created

24

Here, Officer Love admitted --

25

QUESTION:

May I stop you at that point, because
47

1

I think you're telling the police, don't be candid with

2

the people who you suspect about what's going on.

3

seems to me here the officers did everything by the book.

4

They asked him whether he had contraband.

5

they said, we're going off to get a warrant, and it seems

6

what you're saying right now is that the police would have

7

been in a better position vis-a-vis the Fourth Amendment

8

if they had not told him what's up.

9

MS. JONES:

It

When he said no

That's correct, Your Honor, I am

10

suggesting that.

11

Seventh Circuit in United States v. Roselli, have held

12

that when it is reasonable or it is foreseeable that

13

evidence will be destroyed if you ask for permission to

14

search, if you go ahead and take that step and ask for

15

consent and it's denied, you can't then turn around and

16

use that exigency to enter the home without a warrant,

17

because the police have created the exigency.

18

Several lower courts, including the

Here, if you look on page 20 of the joint

19

appendix, Officer Love testifies that at the time Mrs.

20

McArthur told him that Mr. McArthur hid marijuana under

21

the couch, Mr. -- or Mr. McArthur was still free to come

22

and go from his home.

23

Mr. McArthur for permission to search and is denied, from

that point on, Mr. McArthur can't go in because now

Officer Love is concerned that the evidence is about to be

QUESTION:

I suppose we could posit a situation

3

in which officers think that a really big drug ring is

4

cutting heroin in a particular apartment, and you

5

certainly wouldn't expect them to knock on the door and

say, you know, are you guys cutting heroin in there, do

you mind if we come in and look, and they say no, we don't

want you to come in and look.

allow that, would we, so you don't have to be frank with

12

with the criminal.

13

It's sometimes a good idea not to be frank

MS. JONES:

Your Honor, if you know that there's

14

an apartment where people are cutting drugs, then the step

15

that the officers should take in that hypothetical --

QUESTION:

MS. JONES:

-- they should have went and gotten

a warrant.

QUESTION:

I agree.

point have exigent circumstances to believe that he will

MS. JONES:

QUESTION:

9

the evidence?

He sees

Don't the police at that

No.
Wouldn't any sensible person destroy

I mean, wouldn't he reasonably say, she has

10

just been in here, she has seen the drugs under the sofa,

11

she's talking to the cops, she hates my guts, she is

12

probably going to tell the cops what she saw in here, I'd

13

better get rid of it?

14

process for someone in his position?

15

MS. JONES:

Isn't that a reasonable thought

Your Honor, the problem with having

16

that be the standard to determine the exigent circumstance

17

of the destruction of evidence is that you could say that

18

in any case where someone has evidence of a crime inside

19

of their home.

20

I believe Justice Stevens --

QUESTION:

No, you can't say that.

What makes

21

this exigent is the confluence at a particular point in

22

time in which the -- it isn't merely a case in which he

23

has drugs, he knows somebody knows that he has drugs, he

24

knows that maybe that somebody may go to the police.

25

all happening in front of him at that time.
50

It's

He has the

1

drugs, the person who's going to snitch on him has just

2

seen the drugs, he can see the person outside his trailer

3

talking to the police.

4

of all of this that gives it the exigency, and why

5

doesn't -- that's my argument.

6

sufficient exigency?

7

MS. JONES:

It is sort of the temporal unity

Why doesn't it give a

Your Honor, two reasons why it

8

wouldn't give a sufficient exigency.

First of all, the

9

police were out at the McArthurs for a while and again,

10

Mrs. McArthur was coming and going out of the trailer this

11

whole time the police were there.

12

from whatever he could gather from what was occurring

13

there, wasn't concerned enough that his possession of

14

marijuana was going to be reported that --

15

QUESTION:

Evidently Mr. McArthur,

No, but you're trying to answer the

16

hypothetical by adding facts about something that was

17

going on in the trailer that the police could not know,

18

and if the police didn't know it, it doesn't get into the

19

analysis.

20

could infer an exigency.

I don't see how it affects the fact that they

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL D. BERTOCCHI

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

4

QUESTION:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Bertocchi, I would not normally

5

intrude upon your time, but you know, I've just criticized

6

or discussed with Ms. Jones whether she wasn't altering

7

the question presented.

8
9

I have the same question for you.

I had frankly thought that this case involved
neither the question about whether there was probable

10

cause, nor the question about whether there were exigent

11

circumstances.

12

policeman could have gone in, this is an easy case.

13

you come up and argue exigent circumstances.

from the question that you show in your blue brief.

What are we talking about here?

If there were exigent circumstances so the

All of a sudden

19

I'm discussing a case that bears no resemblance to the

20

case that I thought we were going to hear.

21

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:

Your Honor, I believe when I

22

was addressing the question of exigent circumstances that

23

I was doing so in response to specific questions about the

24

facts of this case, and it is our position that if the

25

Court were to determine that particularized exigent
52

1

circumstances were necessary, then they were present if

2

the Court wanted to ask that.

We do stand behind the question presented.

We

do believe that the officer had --

Even without exigent circumstances

you think that he could have made the exclusion from the

house?

GENERAL BERTOCCHI:
Honor.

Yes, I believe that, Your

That is our position, and if I may speak up for

10

the question presented and for the rule it proposes, I

11

would submit that that is not going to be a difficult rule

12

to apply, because it will only require police officers to

13

know two things, 1) that they have probable cause to

14

search, and 2) the character of the evidence, and if they

15

don't know that, then they shouldn't be looking for a

16

warrant, and if they shouldn't be looking for a warrant,

17

they would have no basis and no need to impound.

Thank you, Your Honors.
