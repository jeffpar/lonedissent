ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMIAH A. COLLINS

8

ON BEHALF OF PRIVATE PETITIONERS

11

MR. COLLINS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
In a society that values personal freedom and

12

autonomy, there is a vital interest in securing the

13

ability of individuals to exclude unwanted intruders from

14

their private activities.

15

consists of speech there is a particularly vital interest

16

in preventing intrusion so that individuals may conduct

17

their private communications freely and securely.

18

that reason, Congress and the legislatures of virtually

19

every state in this country have made it unlawful to gain

20

access to a private communication.

21

QUESTION:

And where the private activity

And for

Well, let me stop you right there and

22

ask you why should the question of whether private

23

information about someone is published turn on how the

24

information was obtained?

25

it is and focus there?

Why don't you just look at what

Why does it become secondarily

1

such an important interest to focus on how it was

2

obtained?

3

MR. COLLINS:

Because I think Justice O'Connor

4

what Congress and the state legislatures and in some

5

respects the common law have recognized that separate and

6

apart from the question about whether there is certain

7

information that is so private that it should or shouldn't

8

be revealed which raises content discrimination problems

9

among other things, there is a vital interest in people

10

having private places in their lives where a stealthy

11

intruder cannot come in whether or not the individual --

12

QUESTION:

Well -- well, it ought to turn on the

13

public significance perhaps of the information and

14

presumably the state can prevent unlawful tapping of wires

15

directly and get at the bad actor, but why should it

16

extend to the subsequent user who didn't do anything

17

wrong?

18

MR. COLLINS:

Because Your Honor, as Congress

19

and some forty states have reasoned, if there is intrusion

20

into an individual's private communications, a tap, a bug,

21

a scanner, whatever, and then what is obtained is

22

broadcast to all the world or under these statutes

23

exploited in any other way, the same interests that are

24

harmed by the initial intrusion are harmed again and all

25

the more severely because in essence, you have invited in

this instance a hundred thousand people to eavesdrop, and

2

as petitioner Bartnicki stated in her deposition, when

3

she, having no idea that anyone had intruded into her

4

communication with Mr. Kane, when she heard on the radio

5

it being broadcast she felt that she had been violated in

6

front of a hundred thousand people and that is true I

7

believe independent of the content.

8

today, hear a radio station broadcasting a conversation

9

where I convey my grocery list to my wife or vice versa, a

10

feel a violation of my person autonomy. Just as if someone

QUESTION:

If I, riding home

But you want to say that if I also

13

hear that and tell my wife that I'm committing a crime.

That's what this statute says.

like that.

Now maybe there'll be some creative

But that's not what the statute says.
MR. COLLINS:

Well, the far downstream uses are

not at issue -QUESTION:

Oh, but it seems to me with all

23

respect that they are because the respondents can raise

24

those issues on an overly-broad statute under the

25

Thornhill doctrine even if this does not apply to them.

MR. COLLINS:

Well they -- I think Your Honor,

2

first of all they can't raise it when they they've brought

3

explicitly an as-applied challenge and at no point in the

4

litigation until this Court have they started raising the

5

other applications that they now posit, and secondly this

6

Court in The Florida Star and all the preceding case

7

emphasize that in the very difficult area and it is

8

difficult of conflicts between privacy-type interests and

9

First Amendment interests the Court should decide only as

10

much as it needs to decide in a particular case.

11

QUESTION:

I suppose it's very difficult, is it

12

not, to enforce the prohibition against wire tapping

13

against the person who actually -- who actually does the

14

tapping.

15

to come to light or publicize the thing.

16

person does the work is to push it on to somebody else who

17

will do the disclosure.

That is certainly true in this

very case --

Which is what happened here, right?

21

MR. COLLINS:

QUESTION:

That's what happened in this case.

An anonymous tape was sent to the

23

radio station which is almost always the way it will

24

happen.

MR. COLLINS:

And Congress -- that is what

1

happened in this case and Congress was told in both 1968

2

and '86 that it happens very frequently.

3

QUESTION:

I think --

Well, let's change the facts just a

4

little bit.

Suppose what the conversation revealed was

5

not some conversation about we're going to have to commit

6

some violent acts but let's suppose it revealed that in

7

fact, a murder had been committed because of this very

8

situation.

9

the police and your going to punish the person who passed

And the anonymous tape then is passed on to

10

on that tape when a very serious crime has been committed.

11

Now how is the public interest served by that?

12
13

MR. COLLINS:

Your Honor, I believe the same --

I think there are two responses to that.

14

QUESTION:

Oh, I actually had that very

15

situation as a trial court judge in a murder case.

16

a hard time understanding how the public interest was

17

served by punishing the person who passed on the

18

information.

19

MR. COLLINS:

I had

I think there are two responses to

20

the question, Your Honor.

The first is there is in the

21

law, as the Government's reply brief points out a doctrine

22

of necessity which in some narrow circumstances, and it's

23

not precisely clear how far it extends, in essence

24

privileges what would otherwise be a violation of a

25

statute.

If the statute doesn't rule that defense out.

1

So an action to protect life and limb may be an exception.

2
3

The second answer though, is that -- because it

4

is a very hard question, but there are -- when there are

5

content-neutral laws that say that because of the way in

6

which information came to someone, that information is not

7

to be revealed be it these statutes or be it for example a

8

protective orders in the Seattle Times, that generally the

9

fact that what was revealed is a matter of public

10

importance does not automatically say that the interests

11

that are being served by the content-neutral law that says

12

either you should not have this information at all or you

13

should not be able to use it, they don't necessarily give

14

way.

15

received in discovery I believe under Seattle Times the

16

press could again be prevented from making use and

17

publishing the tape.

18

And that's indeed if this exact tape had been

QUESTION:

And the key is that -Well, but in Seattle Times and

19

Rhinehart and in the Aguilar case, we were controlling the

20

people who received the information under a court order.

21

They were within our immediate control.

22

case would be as if somebody surreptitiously took this

23

tape and gave if to a person and then that person gave it

24

to the newspapers.

Quite the contrary.

that they will not come home some day and have a hundred

thousand people hearing a phone call that they made. And I

20

submit that what unites those cases and in essense solves

21

the problem here is the fact that we're dealing with a

22

totally content-neutral statute and one which as applied

23

does not unduly interfere with the ability of the press --

25

QUESTION:

But merely because it's content-

neutral does not mean you can't regulate it.

seditious.

2

that I know of which allows you to regulate it. It's

3

intercepted which is now going to be a new category under

4

your rule and there is no precedent for that.

5

It isn't obscene.

MR. COLLINS:

And there is no category

Your Honor, I don't know of any

6

case in which this Court has struck down a statute which

7

is content-neutral in the full sense that this one is

8

except in some rare circumstances where the Court in

9

essence has determined that too much speech is going to be

10

supressed.

In other words, we are not saying, we don't

11

have to say, that some of this is a category of speech of

12

no First Amendment significance whatsoever.

13

saying is that there are important governmental interests

14

harmed not only by the interception but by the disclosure.

What we are

15
16

If those are then taken into account through a

17

content-neutral statutory regime, we believe and we have

18

argued that that in essence exhausts the First Amendment

19

concerns both as to level of scrutiny and as to satisfying

20

scrutiny as long as we are not in one of the rare

21

situations such as City of Ladue, for example, where the

22

Court would say granted it's content-neutral, but you're

23

just restricting too much speech and we think in this case

the question would be, the concern about whether this

MR. COLLINS:

Does that alter the

We submit that it does not for two

reasons.

9

interests and secondly -- and I do think this is critical,

10

we then have to ask ourselves is this one of the very rare

11

cases in this Court's jurisprudence where one would say

12

that even though a statute is totally neutral, doesn't

13

lend itself to Government thought control, to supression

14

of ideas in any way, it's not reshaping public debate,

15

totally neutral, does it in some way restrict too much

prevent the press from doing what it needs to do?

believe this is not such a narrow -- one of those rare

situations because as the Court says Branzburg --

Branzburg, for example, the Court says that we know the

QUESTION:

And even

Well, the difference is in one case

15

they're acting unlawfully and in the other case they have

16

information that they just came across because someone

17

else acted unlawfully and that'd be a big difference?

18

MR. COLLINS:

I think in the final analysis, no,

19

Your Honor, because as I understand Florida Star and this

20

Court's jurisprudence, the question here is whether there

21

are sufficient Government interests to justify a content-

neutral application of these laws in this manner.

not a question of is the press a bad actor or not to be

briefed the way that the reason to factor can be construed

under this statute, but I don't think that the proper

analysis of the issues here can ultimately turn simply on

did the press violate a law when they received the

information or not, otherwise of course Congress could

take a jab with the pen and say, oh, and also it's illegal

correctly, that Pentagon Papers which was a prior

anybody else who published the materials could after the

publication be held responsible in money damages.

MR. COLLINS:

Possibly, Your Honor, but Pentagon

MR. WAXMAN:

2

the appropriate level of scrutiny is intermediate-level

3

scrutiny because this is a totally content-neutral law of

general applicability that protects fundamental values of

privacy and private speech and denies third parties

nothing that they otherwise would have had if the act's

prohibition on interception itself was fully effective --

8
9

QUESTION:

General, isn't the problem with the

10

easy analogy to the other intermediate-scrutiny cases that

11

here there in effect is a complete suppression of speech,

12

whereas in the paradigmatic intermediate-scrutiny cases,

13

somebody can speak somewhere, sometime.

14

what he thinks about the draft without burning his card,

15

you can speak at some other time or some other place in

the time, place, and manner cases. That's not so here.

O'Brien can tell

Well, I think that is so here, and

of all the intermediate-scrutiny cases.

that's why we think that unlike Cohen v. Cowles Media

true that when you do the balancing, whether you call it

to put it on, you're -- what you've got to balance is that

if this law is good, then the disclosure which apparently

GENERAL WAXMAN:

That is absolutely true and

that is why heightened scrutiny applies. It is our

submission that it's significant that if the same

6

information comes from any other source, it can be used or

7

disseminated with impunity which is another way I think,

8

of what I'm trying to suggest, which is that there is no

9

suggestion here, unlike the Pentagon Papers case, or the

10

Florida Star line of cases of a censorial motive by the

11

Government, an effort to take certain facts off the table,

question about why we should care how the information came

private expression implicates other constitutional values

as this Court recognized in Cox and Florida Star and in

11

the result of a failure of a trusted responsibility, which

12

was at issue in Florida Star and perhaps at issue in

there is quote, almost -- there are almost always less

can be more careful about who you trust, and secondly,

My problem is that in order to make

taking a class of speech and saying this is now tainted

simply no precedent for that in the cases of this Court.

GENERAL WAXMAN:

with your characterization of this as tainted speech that

says that if you know that this is the result of an

illegal intrusion into a zone of conversational privacy,

you cannot use it until it becomes publicly known.

that you want to dry up the market for this sort of thing

And I think the scarcity of cases suggest that enforcing

this rule really would not do very much to dry up the

market but maybe you'd comment on that.

15

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well, I think that that's

wrong; that is the scarcity of cases shows it because if

you look at the cases, for example, that are reprinted in

the appendix to our reply brief and in respondent Vopper's

blowing off -- the willingness to blow off porches is a

Mr. Chief Justice, we believe

that the solution adopted by the Third Circuit, the narrow

the difficult position that this argument is made in one

if you receive innocently a tape recording and merely

The second is that it applies to

The fact that, and Justice -- there was
In this context

10

12

literally any datum about the conversation. The third is

13

that it imposes civil and criminal liability and permits

14

the commencement of litigation even when there has been no

15

injury at all.

16

any claim that they had been actually been hurt.

17

fourth is that it applies equally no matter whether the

18

information and indeed the conversation in question was

19

even private.

20

question is that the information that was spoken and was

21

heard and intercepted could have been a completely public

22

fact but the fact that it was said in a conversation would

23

be disclosed, and fifth and this one is the particularly

Now, the reason I mentioned these five is that

2

you have to look at someone who is in the position of

receiving a piece of information and there is the grave

4

concern that when you get a piece of information

notwithstanding the reason to know limitation which is

what the Solicitor General points had to saving the

are going to have a situation where you attempt to discern

operates only in the circumstance where the newspaper

doesn't know the intercepting party. If the newspaper

because the newspaper will be subpoenaed and will have to

person will be prosecuted.

about potential victims of porch blowings, were we?

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

So that

When he gave it to the radio

station, yes, we were.

6

QUESTION:

And at the same time, he was making

7

it known, I forget how, but he was making it known to the

8

victims so that the radio station was not necessary to

9

make it known to the victims and the people who learn

10

through the radio station weren't potential victims.

11

That's correct, isn't it?

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That is correct.

Our point is

13

that when you have a piece of information and the

14

prophylactic goals of the statute have broken down and it

15

is a matter of public significance, you are not involved

16

in anything that Congress attempted to stop.

17

of the highest interest.

18

like the third circuit did here under intermediate

19

scrutiny, if it is only speech on matters of public

20

significance and by someone who had nothing to do with the

21

interception, has no idea who was, that speech is

22

protected.

there is reason to know here.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

4

QUESTION:

That's correct.

All right, and -- and Congress

5

certainly did intend to stop that, it seems to me,

6

contrary to what you said. Why do you suggest that this is

7

outside of ambit of what concerned Congress.

8

obvious market than the market of a radio station which

Congress

10

has reason to know that it is publishing illegally seized

interceptions.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Souter, if I said this

wasn't what Congress was trying to do, I misspoke.

14

QUESTION:

I thought you did say that.

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

We agreed that that was

16

Congress' goal.

17

that neither the Congress nor the plaintiffs or the

18

Government have attempted to develop any record that that

19

was a series problem.

20

Our point in that respect is twofold, is

And second is that -Then they should have time to do it

22

If that's the flaw --

2

no one has suggested that they are going to develop any

kind of record.

4

QUESTION:

Then, but tell me if I'm wrong.

I

5

thought the district court kept the case there, certified

6

questions to the third circuit. The third circuit didn't

7

say but now you have a chance to show it, just cut him

8

off. They prevailed in the district court.

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

They did not attempt in this

10

case to put forward any record regarding the efficacy of

11

the statute.

12

QUESTION:

If they knew they were required to do

13

something beyond the intuitive judgment that people make

14

that of course nobody is going to do this if nobody is

15

going to touch it, if it's going to be treated like a hot

potato.

Ginsburg, are speaking about two slightly different

things.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER UNITED STATES

6

MR. WAXMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

7

Questions about the extent of the necessity

8

defense which we mentioned in our reply brief or the

9

meaning of the word disclosure are all, of course,

10

questions of application that will be given judicial

11

interpretation in appropriate cases where they arise.

12

salient point here is that the respondents have not made a

13

case, either in their briefs or here, that going solely

14

against the wiretapper is going to significantly protect

15

privacy.

16

legislative history does, in fact, reflect both great

17

solicitude for the privacy rights involved and that's

18

quoted at page 3 of our reply brief and also repeatedly

19

the recognition that wiretapping and bugging and now of

20

course we have hacking into e-mails is almost completely

impossible of interception or even detection.

1

Congress thought was appropriate and Congress said in the

2

legislative history was appropriate to vindicate the

3

privacy rights of the people whose privacy interests were

4

not vindicated.

5

The notion that there is a limiting principal

6

for facts of public significance, I think, is fatal.

7

First of all, if there were such an exception, that would

8

not -- that would deprive the statute of being content

9

neutral.

And second of all, there is almost no way to

10

draw the line, as Justice Scalia suggests, for what is

11

publicly significant.

12

that the name of a woman who has been raped, not the fact

13

that there was a rape or the name of the perpetrator, but

14

the victim is a matter of public significance and public

15

interest.

constitutional way to draw a line here.
