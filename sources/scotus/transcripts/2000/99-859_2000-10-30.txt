ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY JONES

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

Petitioner's property is being damaged by water

12

leaking from the Madera Canal.

13

facility and it passes irrigation water to the farmers of

14

Madera County.

15

below that all of the water in this canal constitutes

16

flood water under the immunity provisions of the Flood

17

Control Act of 1928 solely by virtue of the fact that this

18

canal is part of the Central Valley project, a large

19

Federal water project covering one-third of the State of

20

California, with multiple component parts and with

21

multiple originating purposes, only one of which was flood

22

control.

23

The Canal is an irrigation

We were told by the Ninth Circuit panel

The Ninth Circuit made this ruling noting that

24

this canal was not a flood control project by itself, and

25

served no flood control purpose.
3

The Ninth Circuit

1

further indicated --

2
3

QUESTION:

flood control purpose?

4
5

Did they concede that it served no

MR. JONES:

I wasn't aware of that.
They being the United States, Your

Honor?

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

7

MR. JONES:

No.

8

served no flood control purpose.

9
10

QUESTION:

13

And did the Ninth Circuit said that

it served no flood control purpose?

11
12

They did not concede that it

MR. JONES:

Yes, it did, as part of its

decision.
QUESTION:

Now, do you concede that water could

14

be released into the Madera Canal for flood control

15

purposes, for example to make more room in the reservoir

16

for flood waters that are anticipated?

17

MR. JONES:

Yes.

Could that happen?

It would be under a relatively

18

limited circumstances and the problem there is, this water

19

is liquid gold.

20

they know where it goes and why, and if they're going to

21

spill it into that ground --

22

QUESTION:

It's liquid gold until December.

23

MR. JONES:

Actually, not necessarily, Your

They marshall it, they organize it, and

24

Honor, because for most of the years in question they

25

don't put water into that canal even in December.
4

The

1

amount of flood space that they reserve in this canal is

2

only 30 percent of the entire -- in the lake is only 30

3

percent of the entire facility.

4
5

QUESTION:

Well, I have to say -- I recognize

the case is here on dismissal of the pleadings.

6

MR. JONES:

7

QUESTION:

Correct.
And that you have indicated in your

8

brief that in some events maybe the case should go back,

9

that we shouldn't just rule for the Goverment.

I am

10

troubled by the assumption of the Ninth Circuit that the

11

canal is not related to flood control in any respect.

12

That's the inference I get from its statement, and I find

13

that somewhat troubling.

14

MR. JONES:

That issue was not briefed at the

15

Ninth Circuit level, Your Honor, but the canal itself was

16

authorized under the reclamation laws and 100 percent of

17

its costs were reimbursed to the United States under those

18

rules.

19

system of Millerton Lake.

20

The canal itself is not part of the flood routing

QUESTION:

Well, can't it be, though -- I mean,

21

the Government points out in the brief that there are

22

limitations in a flood situation on the amount of water

23

that can be discharged downstream, and in order to comply

24

with those limitations they might have to use this canal

25

to run off surplus water, so the United States is saying
5

1

that there certainly are situations in which this canal

2

would have a flood control use.

3

that's at least possible?

4

MR. JONES:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. JONES:

Do you concede that

I do.
Okay.
But the fact of the matter is that

7

the facility itself is operated -- if that ever occurred,

8

still it would be a question of fact we'd have to address

9

below, but --

10

QUESTION:

And you would say that if the

11

escaping water resulted from that particular kind of flood

12

control use there would be immunity.

13

water was not so related there would be no immunity, and

14

you'd in effect have to apportion the damage -- well, not

15

apportion the damages.

16

analysis.

If the escaping

You'd have to do a causation

17

MR. JONES:

That is exactly correct, Your Honor.

18

QUESTION:

Yeah.

19

QUESTION:

So you say flood waters would include

20

two things, waters going through a facility that was

21

primarily built for flood control purposes, no?

22

your categories?

23

What are

What does flood waters consist of?

MR. JONES:

Flood waters consist of, and I think

24

this Court's statement in United States v. James at page

25

605 is relatively clear.

It requires a Federal flood
6

1

control project, and the flood waters must be waters that

2

are contained in or passing through that project for

3

purposes of or related to flood control.

4

QUESTION:

Well, related -- related to -- I

5

mean, that's pretty wide.

6

lose here.

7
8
9

MR. JONES:

If we'd apply that, I think you

I would challenge that a little bit,

Your Honor, respectfully.
QUESTION:

I think --

You acknowledge it's remotely

10

enough -- it's remotely related to flood control in that

11

should there be a flood they can release some of the

12

excess flood waters through this canal.

13

MR. JONES:

That might make the canal remotely

14

related to flood control, but it doesn't make the waters

15

that are passing through the canal -- under circumstances

16

in the middle of summer, it's 100 degress out, the river

17

is dry down below the dam 20 miles, and they're diverting

18

the water into the canal under contractual obligations,

19

where it's bought and paid for.

20

circumstances, I think the water, which is what the

21

statute speaks to, is not flood water.

22

QUESTION:

Under those

Suppose at that point the dam itself

23

started to leak and caused damage.

24

be immune in that instance?

25

MR. JONES:

Would the Government

Assuming it's a Federal flood
7

1

control project, Friant Dam is, it's leaking water into

2

the river channel.

3

you're looking at is the natural flow of this river and

4

they put a dam in it, and if it leaks into the river --

5
6

That is part of the floodway.

QUESTION:

And you're saying the Government then

would be immune because it's in the river bed?

7

MR. JONES:

It's leaking into the floodway of

8

the river itself.

9

the very river course.

10
11

What

It's leaking into the channel, which is

QUESTION:

So whether or not it's flood water

depends on where it ultimately comes out?

12

MR. JONES:

It might if that's part of the

13

facility.

I mean -- what you're looking at is, is the

14

river chanenl runs -- this facility, if it were operated

15

as a flood control facility, would impound water at most

16

once every 4 years.

17

QUESTION:

Well, in effect you want the

18

opportunity to go back and establish that the water in the

19

Madera Canal has never been released in connection with

20

flood control purposes.

21
22

MR. JONES:
things.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. JONES:

25

Well, Your Honor, I think two

Is that right?
Yes, we want the opportunity to go

back, and I think that we want to be able to establish
8

1

that the water has never been -- or at least at times has

2

been released for purposes other than flood control.

3

QUESTION:

May it not depend on the kind of

4

claim you're making against the Government?

5

water is -- someone is drowned in a boat accident as a

6

result of flood waters being released out of a dam, you

7

have a single incident that occurs right then.

8

your claim is based on leaching out, or some sort of

9

damage to the soil over a period of years.

10

MR. JONES:

That's correct.

I mean, if

I take it

The canal is -- the

11

lining of the canal is cracking, and it's leaking water,

12

it's raising the water table and it's --

13
14

QUESTION:

So it didn't happen on any one day.

It happened --

15

MR. JONES:

16

QUESTION:

That's right.
It seems to me that makes your case a

17

little harder, because it's project-related.

18

like the case where the Corps of Engineers boat was being

19

driven by a drunk driver, which doesn't seem to have much

20

to do with floods at all.

21

This is not

But here, it has to do with the way the whole

22

facility was constructed, and that seems to me to be a

23

harder case for you.

24

MR. JONES:

25

I'm not sure I understand the part

about the way the facility was constructed.
9

Are you

1

talking about the canal or the dam?

2

QUESTION:

It's a long-term damage.

The damage

3

occurs over a period of time because of the way that the

4

canal was constructed, or misconstructed, and that seems

5

to me to be more closely related to the purpose of

6

immunity, which is to protect the Government when it

7

erects this facility, than in some of these cases where

8

you have -- where people are sucked down into tunnels and

9

so forth during irrigation season.

10

MR. JONES:

I don't think that that's what we're

11

saying.

12

of our claims is that they're just not maintaining it.

13

The concrete cracks, they patch some of it, they don't

14

patch the others, and some of it is deteriorating, and it

15

needs to be repaired.

16
17

What we're saying is, is that the facility -- one

QUESTION:

But you could say the same thing if

it were the dam.

18

MR. JONES:

We could, except the dam would be

19

passing water right into the floodway itself.

20

passes on to other people's property.

21

rights.

22

rights to pass water in cetain ways and

23

dam is either leaking or has its gates open isn't going to

24

give rise to a claim.

25

This, it

The dam got flowage

When Friant was built they obtained flowage

QUESTION:

the fact that the

This whole scenario, in effect, was
10

1

quite beyond the contemplation of Congress in 1928.

2

it's talking about flooding on the Mississippi.

3

no dams on the Mississippi River, needless to say.

4

MR. JONES:

When

There are

I understand, Your Honor, and that's

5

very true.

6

Court in James said that, that the context was a

7

floodworks project like the Mississippi River, and we're

8

not dealing with a floodworks project like the Mississippi

9

River.

10

This -- the clear context, and I think this

We're dealing -QUESTION:

You say, if I understand your case,

11

you wouldn't take a position that flood waters are

12

never -- you're not going to try to prove that flood

13

waters were never released through this canal, but you

14

would say categorically that the canal itself, when

15

constructed, had no flood control purpose.

16

MR. JONES:

I think that's absolutely true,

17

because if this was -- if this canal was going to be

18

constructed for flood control they would have never built

19

it.

20

it much lower -- there's only a fraction of the space of

21

this whole facility that serves any flood purposes.

They'd have never built that dam.

22
23

QUESTION:

Well, would you concede that the

Friant dam has a substantial flood control purpose?

24
25

They'd have built

MR. JONES:
relief.

It definitely provides some flood

I don't know that I would say it provides a
11

1

substantial flood purpose, because if they open the gates

2

to channel capacity it would not impound a drop of water

3

for 3 years at a time, maybe 1 year it would impound water

4

for a limited period of time and they'd never reach 25

5

percent or 20 percent of this capacity --

6

QUESTION:

But it's part of an entire project.

7

The Sacramento River waters couldn't go to the San Joaquin

8

if the Friant didn't back -- didn't stop the natural

9

tributary.

10

MR. JONES:

Yes they do route the Sacramento

11

River water down into the San Joaquin Valley and they do

12

route the water of the river --

13
14
15

QUESTION:

And they can only do that because of

the Friant Dam.
MR. JONES:

But you don't impound water like

16

this for flood control.

17

in the way they impound it -- I mean, the United States

18

said in their brief at page 3, you impound water as soon

19

as posisble for irrigation, and you hold it as long as you

20

can until you need it, and that's what they do with this

21

facility, and they said you impound water only at the last

22

moment for flood control when you have to and you evacuate

23

it as quickly as possible.

24

operated that way.

25

QUESTION:

If you're going to impound water

This facility just isn't

Well, suppose it is, in the sense
12

1

that when the people were thinking of building this, they

2

thought, we'll use it mostly for irrigation, but you know

3

the San Joaquin floods sometimes too and then what we'll

4

do is we'll have the water held behind the dam.

5

normally will go into the San Joaquin River, sometimes

6

there's too much of it, sometimes we'll divert it up

7

through the canal, it'll run into the Chowchilla River or

8

the Fresno River.

9

most of the time, irrigation, some of the time, for just

So they're thinking both.

They agree

10

overflow of flood water.

11

there's a crack in the canal, so that means most of the

12

time the water that's running out is water that would be

13

there for irrigation, and some of the time the water that

14

runs out through the crack is water that would be -- would

15

have been released because there was too much water behind

16

the dam and the San Joaquin River was filled up.

17

now, who wins under those circumstances?

18

MR. JONES:

And who wins?

It

And moreover,

Right,

The first presumption -- the reason

19

the dam is because of the irrigation retention, but

20

assuming I understand the hypothetical, and I think I do,

21

the water that would go into the canal under those

22

circumstances may very well be flood water, and it may

23

very well carry the immunity, but it would be in a very

24

limited circumstance.

25

QUESTION:

All right, so you want to divide it
13

1

say proportionate 90-10.

2

that so long as the water that's sometimes in that canal

3

and running out through the crack that was too big is

4

flood water, so long as that's so, as long as that's a

5

substantial amount of the water that's causing the damage,

6

i.e. as long as a substantial amount is water that would

7

have otherwise gone into the San Joaquin River but did not

8

because there is too much water behind the dam and the

9

river was filled up, as long as that's substantial, the

10
11
12
13
14
15

But another to do it is to say

Government's entirely immune.
MR. JONES:

Is that -- I mean, it sounds like

that's a causal -QUESTION:

That's the opposite theory one way,

it's very simple case that way.
You know, there's no doubt that there's

16

substantial -- that this is, I'd say, substantially

17

related to flood control, though mostly related to

18

irrigation, the canal, then there's no doubt that some of

19

the time the river, the water that goes through that canal

20

is water that would otherwise be dumped into the San

21

Joaquin, that it was all filled up, but that's a fairly

22

small but still substantial amount of time.

23

And there's no doubt that that water causes some

24

of the damage, but surely not even half.

25

then I think it comles down to, do we do it on a
14

All right.

So

1

proportional basis, or do you do it on a, well, if it's

2

substantially mixed in, you lose?

3

MR. JONES:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. JONES:

I think our position -How do you analyze it, really?
Well, it seems to me there's a

6

couple of different issues, and if I understood the

7

question properly you're saying if you have a certain

8

percentage of the water going down the canal is flood

9

water, and a certain percentage of the water going down

10

the canal, a larger percentage, is irrigation water, is

11

not immune, then wouldn't you simply look at the damages

12

and deal with that as a matter of causation, because some

13

of that water was not subject to the immunity.

14

wasn't, and if that wasn't enough to damage the trees, if

15

the amount of water that went in the canal was not enough

16

to damage the trees, that was not immune.

17

QUESTION:

It clearly

Well, I gather it's already a stretch

18

to say, as James said, that water which is held behind a

19

dam that is not really flood water, it's water that's been

20

accumulating over the summer, but if the dam is for flood-

21

control purposes we're going to consider all that water

22

flood water.

23

That's a very unusual use of the term, flood

24

waters.

I mean, you think about the raging Mississippi.

25

Those are flood waters.
15

1

Then what the Government wants is yet another

2

extension, and what Justice Breyer was proposing, and that

3

is that any facility that is even used in part for flood

4

control purposes, all the water passing through that

5

facility, including the nonflood water part, becomes flood

6

waters.

7
8

MR. JONES:

Then that's what we think happened

here.

9
10

That stretches it pretty thin, pretty thin.

QUESTION:

But that's the Ninth Circuit test, in

effect.

11

MR. JONES:

Well, yeah.

What the Ninth Circuit

12

said is that this immunity, the way they're construing it

13

is so broad that they could not think of a single instance

14

where the immunity did not apply in the Central Valley --

15

QUESTION:

It almost reads as though the Ninth

16

Circuit said that but didn't want to say it, that it was

17

very troubled by it's own holding.

18

MR. JONES:

I was there at the argument, and I

19

think the court was very troubled by what they were having

20

to do.

21

QUESTION:

I think what Justice Breyer's

22

question suggests is that if we were trying to determine

23

causation in order to impose liability, to impose

24

liability, if there are multiple causes, multiple actors,

25

if there's a substantial cause then the actor is joint and
16

1
2

severally liable for 100 percent of the damage.
The mirror image of that might be that you have

3

100 percent immunity if a substantial purpose of the

4

facility is irrigation, and I guess the problem with that

5

from your standpoint is that we're just stacking the deck.

6

MR. JONES:

7

QUESTION:

Right.
We're saying, well, you also have a

8

substantial cause, which is irrigation, and you're not

9

immune for that, which leaves us, I guess, right back

10

where we started.

11

seem to help us much.

12

QUESTION:

I guess standard tort principles don't

Well, are you -- I take it that all

13

you really want us to do here is to say that the Ninth

14

Circuit test,

15

not-wholly-unrelated test, either is a matter of substance

16

or is a matter of creating a presumption in applying the

17

James test, went beyond James, and that we ought to

18

reverse or vacate because that erroneous standard was

19

applied, and I take it that you don't really need to have

20

us or want us necessarily to do anything more at this

21

stage except send it back and say, apply James the way we

22

wrote James, and then if you don't like it later, maybe

23

there'll be another appeal, but am I right that that's all

24

you really want us to do, is to say that not-wholly-

25

unrelated goes beyond James?
17

1

MR. JONES:

Yes.

I think that their test is

2

not-wholly-unrelated to the project, which I think is also

3

compounding the problem.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. JONES:

6
7
8
9
10

Yes.
And so we think the not-wholly-

unrelated test is the wrong test applied to the wrong -QUESTION:

So you're saying they're using the

wrong category: project.
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

Right.
And they're using in effect a --

11

they're creating a kind of presumptoin in applying that

12

category and that presumption is also inconsistent with

13

the way we wrote James, even if they got the category

14

right, is that --

15

MR. JONES:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. JONES:

18

QUESTION:

That's correct.
Do I understand you?
That's correct.
I thought you were asking to do more,

19

not to leave -- to say the Ninth Circuit test is no good,

20

because it's wholly-related -- not-unrelated won't do.

21

thought you were asking us to substitute another test

22

which you had identified as a primary purpose test.

23

Justice Breyer introduced yet another test,

I

24

which sounded to me like you figured out how much of the

25

flow was for irrigation, how much for flood control, and
18

1

then you do kind of an apportionment that wouldn't be an

2

all-or-nothing immunity.

3

saying.

4

I thought that's what he was

But you're saying, if the primary purpose is

5

irrigation, then there's no immunity, even if a

6

substantial purpose would be flood control.

7
8

MR. JONES:

What happened is, we don't believe

we need to go much beyond the language of James as long as

9
10

not-wholly-unrelated means something more than remotely

11

incidental, but we offered -- in the case the Court

12

decided to try to use this case as a test, we offered a

13

test.

14

of the Flood Control Act and the Federal Tort Claims Act

15

and tried to determine how it would be applied in a

16

multipurpose facility.

We put together what we thought made sense in light

17

QUESTION:

Well, James, as the Chief Justice

18

indicated, didn't apply to a system where we had

19

irrigation facilities.

20

It does seem to me that the -- that your primary

21

purpose does not give the Government quite enough

22

protection, because a major purpose, part of the major

23

design of this entire system is for flood control

24

purposes.

25

On the other hand, I'm not quite sure how to
19

1

answer your argument that that protects the Government in

2

every single instance.

3

the -- if flood control is a substantial reason for the

4

facility and for the operation that caused the damage,

5

could you go back for trial on that?

6

MR. JONES:

7

QUESTION:

8
9

Is a substantial -- if we said

Yes, it -And would it give the district court

enough guidance?
MR. JONES:

It would if you didn't take

10

substantial-to-the-injury and say, if flood water was a

11

substantial contributing cause to the injury you have no

12

claim at all, as opposed to saying, if it's a substantial

13

part of the facility, flood control is a substantial part

14

of the facility and, in order for the flood water to be

15

flood water, it has to have a substantial relationship to

16

flood control, then that's fine.

17

But if you take it to the next step of the

18

injury as a cause, then you could wipe out our injury

19

completely, even though three-quarters of it was caused by

20

the United States --

21

QUESTION:

Well, can you sustain a proposition

22

that the facility that should be examined is the Madera

23

Canal in this case?

24

MR. JONES:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.
Because it seems to me if the only
20

1

facility we examine is the Madera Canal, and what it may

2

get -- you certainly do not give anything close to a

3

substantial use for flood control.

4

MR. JONES:

I think that there is no substantial

5

use of that canal for flood control based on anything I've

6

seen.

7

QUESTION:

Do I understand correctly, Mr. Jones,

8

that you're willing to acknowledge that the damages your

9

client received should be reduced by the proportion of the

10

total water going through the canal that is really flood

11

water under your interpretation of flood water?

12

MR. JONES:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. JONES:

15

QUESTION:

I think we'd have to.
Okay.
Yes.
Let me ask you a question which I

16

should know the answer to, but I don't, and I want help.

17

Who has the burden of proof on the immunity here?

18
19
20
21
22

MR. JONES:

It's raised as a matter of

jurisdiction, and so I think it's our burden -QUESTION:

So it's your burden.

It's a

jurisdictional issue and it's your burden.
QUESTION:

With respect to the James test, Mr.

23

Jones, there's a phrase in it that I don't understand, and

24

could you tell me how you read the phrase that says that

25

immunity extends to waters flood control projects cannot
21

1
2

control?
MR. JONES:

Yeah, we read that language to say,

3

first of all, the reference to waters is flood waters, not

4

any water, and we read it to say that in the normal

5

operations of the facility, if the water overrides the

6

banks, or overrides whatever control facilities are

7

constructed, the United States would not be liable for

8

injuries caused by that overriding.

9

We think that's wholly different than what we're

10

dealing with here, where it's just a continuous leak out

11

of a nonmaintained facility, and if the water was not

12

flood water going into the canal, it can't be flood water

13

leaking out.

14

QUESTION:

I have some difficulty in adopting a

15

test that this is an irrigation facility.

16

that the whole design of the Central Valley project is

17

that it's an integrated whole, and I don't know how we

18

could take different pieces, the Madera Canal, the Friant

19

Current Canal, which I take it takes a much larger volume

20

of water, and even the Friant Dam itself and say, well,

21

this is primarily irrigation.

22

do that with the Central Valley project.

23

MR. JONES:

It seems to me

I just don't think you can

I think the Central Valley project

24

can be identified by segments of the project.

25

wouldn't -- I can't speak to all of it, but I can speak to
22

I

1

the Madera Canal.

2

The Madera Canal itself was funded as an

3

irrigation project.

4

so to speak, into another natural waterway that itself is

5

out of the same watershed, so when you look at the

6

totality of it, it doesn't make sense for them to operate

7

this for a flood facility.

8

the Madera Canal necessarily just to run it to another

9

river that itself would be flooding.

10

QUESTION:

It can relieve the lake of pressure,

They wouldn't put water into

Well, I have trouble with that in

11

times of high water.

12

that's for the trier of fact to figure out.

13

sure what test we'd use in order to separate out discrete

14

parts of the Central Valley project and say some are

15

irrigation, some are not.

16
17

irrigation.

There's no flood danger.

MR. JONES:

19

QUESTION:

23

That's true.

This Court did --

There's latent flood danger, and the

entire project is designed to accommodate that.

21
22

I'm just not

Much of the time, all the project is used for

18

20

I just don't think that's right, but

MR. JONES:

I think that that's a fair

statement.
QUESTION:

May I just ask this -- isn't it true

24

that the Government itself classified -- has class I water

25

and class II water that goes through this project, and
23

1

that class I water would never be flood water?

2

MR. JONES:

I believe that that's correct, and I

3

think they have conceded that.

4

Interestingly enough, in their contract with the

5

Madera Irrigation District they define irrigation water as

6

water used primarily in the production of agricultural

7

crops or livestock, including domestic use incidental

8

thereto and watering of livestock.

9

their supplemental lodging.

10

QUESTION:

That's at page 8 of

Does the agreement require some kind

11

of consent by the parties to release any flood water in

12

the Madera Canal?

13

MR. JONES:

14

required.

the circumstances.

16
17
18

I'm not aware of any consent being

I think they have the power to do that under

QUESTION:

Unilaterally?

I thought there was

something in the agreement.
QUESTION:

I think Justice O'Connor is right.

19

In a document I have called the Post Flood Assessment it

20

says that flood releases may also be made of the Friant

21

Current Canal and Madera Canal if all parties agree, and

22

that's rather baffling to me --

23

MR. JONES:

Well, I apologize, but that

24

obviously is in the contract.

25

QUESTION:

I thought it was.
24

1

QUESTION:

You mentioned, or Justice Kennedy

2

earlier mentioned some problems that the trier of fact

3

would have.

4

of records for the purpose to apply this apportionment

5

rule.

6

keep sufficiently detailed records to know when they're

7

using the canal for flood control run-off and when they're

8

using it for normal irrigation purposes?

9
10

One of those problems might be the existence

Do you -- can you represent that in fact they do

MR. JONES:
definitely exist.

11

I believe those records most

They calibrate --

QUESTION:

Okay, but they're not -- I mean, this

12

is a preliminary pleading issue, so they're not in the

13

record of this case, and we'd better -- I suppose we had

14

better be sure of that before we come up with a rule that

15

requires apportionment.

16

MR. JONES:

17

QUESTION:

We -Or at least we ought to be sure that

18

they can keep these records in a practical way, and we

19

don't know that, do we?

20

QUESTION:

Well, don't we know that they charge

21

a different rate for class I water than they do for class

22

II water, so they have to have some way of apportioning

23

it.

24
25

MR. JONES:

We know that the gauging of the

water coming into the lake, we know how much is impounded,
25

1

we know what the storage is, we know what's diverted and

2

when it's diverted and why it's diverted and who's paying

3

for it and why they're paying for it and whether it's

4

class I, class II, or class II obligation.

5

I think that because this is operated for the

6

economic use of the facility, all of that information is

7

very --

8

QUESTION:

They must have it.

9

QUESTION:

There's some loss from evaporation.

10

I mean, I don't think you can take figures in the lake and

11

just assume that all of that water ends up in the ditch.

12

MR. JONES:

13

Unless there's any questions I'd like to reserve

14

I think that that's true.

the rest of my time.

15

QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Jones.

16

Mr. Frederick, we'll hear from you.

17

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

18

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

19
20
21

MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Multiple purpose projects throughout the country

22

operate like the Friant Division of the Central Valley

23

project, which collects water behind Friant Dam to avert

24

flooding along the San Joaquin River and then gradually

25

releases that water to serve both flood control and
26

1

irrigation needs.

2

QUESTION:

Yes, but the Ninth Circuit did say

3

that the Madera Canal is not a flood control project and

4

serves no flood control purpose.

5

on the Friant Dam and you look at the overall project in a

6

third of the State of California, you can say it's related

7

to flood control, but if you focus instead in the Madera

8

Canal, the Ninth Circuit said it just wasn't -- it serves

9

no flood control purpose.

10
11

MR. FREDERICK:

QUESTION:

13

MR. FREDERICK:

15
16
17

Justice O'Connor, we don't know

why --

12

14

Now, if your focus is

So where do we focus?
Well, you focus on what the

reality is.
QUESTION:

Well, the reality is the Madera Canal

serves irrigation purposes, that's the reality.
MR. FREDERICK:

It serves multiple purposes,

18

Justice O'Connor.

19

Madera Canal for 10 months out of every year has to comply

20

with flood control rules set by the Corps of Engineers.

21

The Bureau of Reclamation cannot release that water, and

22

it must make daily decisions about how much water goes

23

into the canal, and which canal it goes into, and whether

24

it goes in the downstream river, and for that reason --

25

QUESTION:

The water that is released into the

But presumably it can't, under that
27

1

agreement, release more than the farmers can use for flood

2

control purposes without the agreement of the parties.

3

MR. FREDERICK:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. FREDERICK:

Wrong.

That is --

Doesn't it say that?
That is incorrect.

What the

6

agreement says is that the Government can put water into

7

the canal, and it can be flood water, and even the water

8

that the irrigators take and use for irrigation can serve

9

flood control reasons if it has to be released from

10

Millerton Lake to avert a flood, or if putting that water

11

down the San Joaquin River would cause a flood, the dam

12

operator diverts it into the irrigation canals --

13

QUESTION:

What if the plaintiffs below show

14

that never in the history of the Madera Canal has that

15

happened?

16

MR. FREDERICK:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. FREDERICK:

That would be --

Never.
Well, first, the fact that they

19

have asserted in their complaint that it serves an

20

irrigation purpose is not legally relevant to the question

21

of whether sovereign immunity applies, because sovereign

22

immunity is jurisdictional, and the court must satisfy

23

itself that it has jurisdiction --

24
25

QUESTION:

Justice O'Connor asked you a

question, Mr. Frederick.

I hope you'll get to the answer
28

1

quite soon.

2

MR. FREDERICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think

3

there's any way that the plaintiffs could show that in

4

this case.

5

QUESTION:

Well, but if this was dismissed on

6

the pleadings -- they said they were prepared to show

7

that.

8
9

MR. FREDERICK:

Justice O'Connor, Congress, when

it created this project in the 1930's, was facing a fact

10

that between 1900 and 1944 there were 38 devastating

11

floods along the San Joaquin River, and it, in the course

12

of its legislative fact-finding, determined that the way

13

to deal with flooding along this river was to harness that

14

river and then to put it to productive use.

15

Of those 38 floods, 15 were from rain during the

16

period between October 1 and roughly March 15, 23 from

17

snow melt run-off --

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Frederick, I don't mean to

19

interrupt you, but I hope you'll tell us some time in the

20

argument what you don't tell us in your brief, whether you

21

defend the Ninth Circuit's test.

22

MR. FREDERICK:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

We do defend --

If you do, you don't need all these

facts.
MR. FREDERICK:

Well, Justice -29

1
2

QUESTION:

All you need is some flood control

purpose in the project and that's enough, and you win.

3

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. FREDERICK:

6

QUESTION:

Then we don't need these facts.

7

QUESTION:

Do you also accept the Ninth

Is that your position?
Yes.

8

Circuit's statement that the Madera Canal is for

9

irrigation purposes only?

10

MR. FREDERICK:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

No.

You disagree with that?
We disagree with that.

The 1937

13

Rivers and Harbors Act said the entire Central Valley

14

project is for, among other purposes, flood control.

15

undisputed that --

16

QUESTION:

It's

Justice O'Connor asked the question,

17

suppose the trier of fact found 100 percent of the water,

18

or let's say, 98 percent of the water over the last 10

19

years in Madera Canal has been for irrigation purposes

20

only, any difference in the case?

21

MR. FREDERICK:

I don't think so, Justice

22

Kennedy, and the reason is the congressional design behind

23

the project, as one of your earlier questions pointed out,

24

it is an integrated project, and the part of the report

25

that you were talking about, if all parties agree, those
30

1

parties are the Bureau of Reclamation and the Corps of

2

Engineers.

3

QUESTION:

The language Congress used is, floods

4

or flood waters.

5

for going down -- back to the design of an entire project,

6

instead of looking as to whether the particular waters

7

here were in fact flood waters.

8
9

I don't know that that affords any basis

MR. FREDERICK:

The way, Mr. Chief Justice,

courts have consistently looked at the question of what is

10

a flood water is, is that water that would overflow the

11

banks unless controlled by man-made structures, and that

12

was the assumption that the Court in James made behind

13

having the water behind this dam be deemed flood waters.

14

If the waters not controlled by that dam would

15

overflow the river, then it would be deemed flood waters

16

and that's --

17
18
19

QUESTION:

But then 98 percent of the water in

this canal isn't.
MR. FREDERICK:

And our submission, Justice

20

Breyer, is that the -- first we can show as a matter of

21

historical fact that that's not the case here, that --

22

QUESTION:

98 percent?

23

MR. FREDERICK:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. FREDERICK:

You can show that the --

Yes.

What percent is it?
Well, our brief demonstrates
31

1

that even if you take class I water out of the picture,

2

and class I water in many circumstances would have to be

3

released for flood storage reasons --

4

QUESTION:

Well, I mean, I used to live in

5

California.

6

would be amazing to me if like there's going to be a flood

7

in summer there.

8
9

I mean, it's dry most of the time, so it

I --

MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Breyer, a flood control

project is created for the cataclysm.

10

QUESTION:

No, but we're talking about flood

11

water, and the flood water the Chief Justice just pointed

12

out, he gave that definition, and I was saying it seemed

13

to me that 98 percent -- I'll give you at the moment that

14

the canal is part of a flood control project.

15

define that as a project that's substantially, but not

16

entirely, used for flood control.

17

that for the sake of argument.

18

We could

But what about the water?

Okay, I'll give you

The water, you've got

19

the definition he just said.

20

don't see how more than about 1 percent, if that, could be

21

flood water, water that would have overflowed the banks of

22

the San Joaquin or any other of these dry places.

23

mean --

24
25

MR. FREDERICK:

Adopting that definition, I

I

Justice Breyer, to answer your

question, one must look at the flood rules that are set
32

1

down by the Corps of Engineers with respect to this

2

project.

3
4
5

They were set out in 1955, and -QUESTION:

Well, why do we look at that when we

have a congressional definition of flood waters?
MR. FREDERICK:

Well, you -- the Congress didn't

6

define the term, flood waters, Mr. Chief Justice.

This

7

Court in James defined the term flood waters in section

8

702(c), but what the Corps of Engineers has done in flood

9

control projects is to set out the rules for how those

10

projects operate so that waters do not become floods, and

11

in the establishment of those rules the Corps made very

12

clear that water has to be diverted from Millerton Lake to

13

the canals that are adjoining the dam so that flooding --

14

QUESTION:

But surely the inquiry is a factual

15

one, not some directive from the Corps of Engineers that

16

says what may occasionally happen, you know, what has in

17

fact happened with respect to the Madera Canal over the

18

last 10 years.

19

MR. FREDERICK:

To the contrary, Mr. Chief

20

Justice, for sovereign immunity to be a functional

21

principle, the Government should be entitled to go into

22

court to say Congress and the applicable agencies have

23

designed and operated this facility for flood control

24

reasons and avoid --

25

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Frederick, that just isn't
33

1

the immunity statute.

That is what we look at, not the

2

construction of the Central California project.

3

to focus on the immunity statute that was passed in the

4

wake of that 1927 massive flood of the Mississippi River.

5

Congress didn't have, in this immunity section, in mind

6

the kind of situation we've got with the Madera Canal,

7

where it's used for irrigation purposes and it's alleged

8

to have been constructed in a faulty manner, it's cracked

9

and the water's leaking out.

Apparently, to a nonuser of

10

the canal, but flooding the property.

11

have that in mind.

12

MR. FREDERICK:

13

O'Connor.

14

aqueducts and canals --

We have

Now, they didn't

To the contrary, Justice

The entire Central Valley project uses

15

QUESTION:

She's talking about the 1928 act --

16

QUESTION:

I'm talking about the immunity

17

language, and you seem to conflate the purpose of the

18

construction of the Central California project, and I

19

just -- I have a -- I have trouble converting --

20
21
22

MR. FREDERICK:

Okay.

Let me see if I can help,

then.
In James what the Court said was that flood

23

waters within the meaning of the immunity statute is all

24

waters carried in or contained through a flood control

25

project for purposes of or related to flood control.
34

1

QUESTION:

James had a very different situation

2

in mind.

3

through the system and somebody drowning as a result when

4

it flooded over.

5

It did have genuine flood, water escaping

This is far removed from that.

MR. FREDERICK:

We don't think so, Justice

6

O'Connor, for this reason.

On an average year, Millerton

7

Lake will have 1.7 million acre feet of run-off into it.

8

That's the average year.

9

has to be emptied, and then it will refill three-and-a-

It has to empty itself, or it

10

half times during the course of the year.

11

is not released there will be a flood.

12

controlled, there will be a flood along the San Joaquin

13

River.

14

QUESTION:

If that water

If it's not

Well, but blessedly there are farmers

15

who want to use it, so of course it's released.

It could

16

be used five times over if there were enough water.

17

farmers are there, dying for water.

18

MR. FREDERICK:

The

And the fact that there is a

19

multiple benefit, and the hydropower is another benefit,

20

does not mean that the water loses its character as flood

21

water if it is stored to protect against a flood along the

22

river, and what -- in James this Court considered the

23

question of flood waters that were being used for

24

recreational purposes.

25

issue in that case was deemed to be for flood control

The specific discharge that was at

35

1

reasons.

2

But here, the same principle applies because the

3

water is released into the irrigation canals for a flood

4

control purpose.

5

QUESTION:

I see that, but -- okay.

Suppose --

6

I'm now giving you this.

A flood control project is a

7

project that has a substantial purpose related to flood

8

control.

9

water, as you pointed out, is it's contained or carried

Then I think you have to get to water, and the

10

through a flood control project for purposes of or related

11

to flood control.

12

All right.

Suppose I were to say, what that

13

means is that the water is where it is for a purpose

14

substantially related to flood control.

15
16

Now, if that's so, except for a tiny little bit,
this is not flood control water.

17

MR. FREDERICK:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. FREDERICK:

To the contrary.

Because?
Because every release from

20

Millerton Lake has to serve a flood control purpose,

21

number 1.

22

QUESTION:

Ah, but I said, is where it is, and

23

it's not in the San Joaquin bed, which is where it would

24

be.

25

August, okay.

It's diverted over because -- and let's take it in
In August, that water would normally be
36

1

released into the San Joaquin bed, and now it isn't

2

released to the San Joaquin bed, why, for irrigation

3

purposes, 100 percent.

4

question, nothing to do with flood control.

5

MR. FREDERICK:

That's the answer to that

Justice Breyer, if I could

6

answer your question in two ways.

7

complaint alleged a discrete release of water, there might

8

be an argument that the Government was not entitled to

9

immunity under your theory because the discrete purpose of

10

The first is, if this

the release could be identified.

11

But this complaint asserts that this canal has

12

leaked, and on page 54 of the joint appendix they say, we

13

don't know when the leaking started, so you have to look

14

at the overall purposes of the project, and you have to

15

look at the reasons why water gets released from Friant

16

Dam.

17

QUESTION:

Okay, let's accept that.

That's why

18

I think you have to get to the third part of this, which

19

is the causation part, if we're going to say anything

20

useful, and on that I thought you'd say, look across the

21

year about 98 percent of the time it is diverted from the

22

San Joaquin bed just for irrigation purposes.

23

Some percent of the time -- I'll give you as

24

much as you want, but it's not going to be more than 50 --

25

it's diverted for, let's say, flood control purposes, and
37

1

now we have to say that the causation problem is solved by

2

saying, you know, one, this water wouldn't have been

3

substituted by some other water, and the second thing is,

4

you have to apportion the damages, I think.

5
6

Now, I'm putting that whole thing out to get
your comment.

7

MR. FREDERICK:

8

QUESTION:

9

Well, my --

But I don't see how else to make it

work.

10

MR. FREDERICK:

Okay.

My comment is that if

11

you're looking at why Congress would have put billions of

12

dollars into these water projects, it did so with the

13

assumption that the immunity would apply, and that is a

14

very important principle here, because when establishing

15

sovereign immunity principles you don't allow the

16

Government to be engaged in fact-finding.

17

for every single document relating to this project since

18

the 1930's as part of their discovery effort.

They've asked

19

QUESTION:

What is --

20

QUESTION:

Well --

21

QUESTION:

-- the basis for your statement that

22

Congress assumed that immunity would apply when it did

23

this particular project?

24

held that immunity applied to anything except property

25

damage.

It wasn't until James that we

38

1
2

MR. FREDERICK:
Justice Stevens.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. FREDERICK:

5

QUESTION:

6
7

Because this is property damage,

I know.

I know.

It -- the Court --

But it hadn't been addressed until

then.
MR. FREDERICK:

In 1936, when Congress directed

8

the Corps of Engineers in the Flood Control Act of 1936 to

9

study the San Joaquin River and figure out a way to stop

10

flooding on the San Joaquin River, it incorporated by

11

reference the 1928 flood act which contains the immunity

12

provision in this case.

13

In 1937, Congress then authorized --

14

QUESTION:

And of course, which except for

15

property damage wasn't even necessary, because the Federal

16

Tort Claims Act --

17

QUESTION:

There was no Federal Tort Claims Act.

18

QUESTION:

-- hadn't even been passed.

19

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, no, but the case of United

20

States v. Cress had been in present -- by -- decided by

21

this Court, and the question of whether or not and when

22

flooding would constitute a taking.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. FREDERICK:

25

That's right.
And so the issue was very much

how will Congress protect the Government from paying out
39

1

in lawsuits for faulty structures or negligent design or

2

damage from flood waters, you know, for decades out into

3

the future, and the interrelationship between the flood

4

control purpose and irrigation is probably the most

5

important thing that we would like the Court to understand

6

here, because you cannot segregate the purposes.

7

all serving these purposes simultaneously.

8
9

QUESTION:

They're

All right, then on your theory -- and

what you've just said raises the same question that your

10

answer to Justice Breyer raised with me.

11

will there ever be a situation in which the immunity won't

12

apply?

13

MR. FREDERICK:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. FREDERICK:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. FREDERICK:

18

QUESTION:

On your theory,

Yes.

What?
When, in an accident --

The discrete situation?
The discrete situation.

All right.

If the discrete situation

19

applies in the accident, why shouldn't the discrete

20

situation, in effect, rule apply here if they can show by

21

the records kept by the dam that except in, let's say,

22

five instances in which the canal was used for overflow

23

for flood control purposes, all the other water that was

24

diverted into that canal was for nonflood-control purposes

25

and therefore you would get your immunity on some
40

1

apportionment theory?

Why wouldn't that apply, if you

2

accept the discrete release exception --

3

MR. FREDERICK:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, first it would be --

-- to liability?
First, it would be an unusual

6

way to treat subject matter jurisdiction of the courts, on

7

an apportionment basis.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, it may be an unusual way,

unless we are going to allow your theory of immunity to

10

become a plenary theory in which there will never be

11

liability, isn't that what we're going to have to do?

12
13

MR. FREDERICK:

project itself and how the project --

14
15

QUESTION:

No, but isn't that what we're going

to have to do?

16

MR. FREDERICK:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. FREDERICK:

19

When you were talking about the

Well, I --

Yes or no.
No, I don't think so, Justice

Souter --

20

QUESTION:

Why?

21

MR. FREDERICK:

-- and the reason is that

22

Congress wanted there to be broad immunity.

23

this statute in the broadest possible --

24
25

QUESTION:

It drafted

But it didn't want there to be

complete immunity, did it?
41

1

MR. FREDERICK:

2

QUESTION:

No.

All right, so we're going to have to

3

have some kind of mechanism to apportion causation for

4

jurisdictional purposes, don't we?

5

MR. FREDERICK:

No, I -- no, Justice Souter, I

6

think there ought to be a discrete -- I think conceptually

7

there are two different problems dealing with this

8

statute.

9

accident occurring in flood waters within a project and is

James dealt with the conceptual problem of an

10

there a relationship between the accident that occurs and

11

the flood control purpose of the project, and what the

12

Court there said was, if it -- if the accident is related

13

to the purposes of the flood control project, the immunity

14

applies.

15
16

QUESTION:

Okay, and that was a -- that really

stretched the statute, didn't it?

17

MR. FREDERICK:

18

QUESTION:

19

This --

Because the statute didn't have a

related-to condition.

20

MR. FREDERICK:

This problem, Justice Souter, is

21

really at the core of what Congress was getting at in 1928

22

which is, we're going to pour billions of dollars into

23

building these structures to protect flood water, and

24

we --

25

QUESTION:

Now, wait a minute, you think
42

1
2

Congress was talking about damming the Mississippi River?
MR. FREDERICK:

No, but Mr. Chief Justice, when

3

Congress created the extensive levee system it spent four

4

times the amount that it had on the Panama Canal, and it

5

also appropriated money in the 1928 act to put dams on the

6

Sacramento River and to protect against flooding on the

7

Sacramento River, which is integrated in the water system

8

with the San Joaquin River.

9

QUESTION:

And you think Congress really thought

10

that if they built the levee on the Mississippi, and the

11

if the levee leaked during the middle of the summer, when

12

there were no flood waters in sight, that the immunity

13

would attach?

14

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

15

QUESTION:

Then I still --

16

QUESTION:

It isn't clear to me.

I think it's

17

already a stretch to say that the waters held behind a

18

flood control project even during a period when there's no

19

risk of flood are flood waters.

20

the English language, and to carry it further, as you now

21

want us to do, that even canals leading off of the main

22

flood control project which are sometimes used for the

23

release of flood waters, it's so breathlessly beyond what

24

Congress has said in the statute.

25

MR. FREDERICK:

That's just a stretch of

Justice Scalia, first the Court
43

1

took a different view in James, and that view is

2

certainly --

3

QUESTION:

Whatever view it took in James was

4

dictum.

5

occurred from flood waters, in the real sense of flood

6

waters.

7

It couldn't be clearer that the accident there

MR. FREDERICK:

No, those waters were captured

8

behind the dam, and they were being released to create

9

more flood storage space in that lake, just as here, the

10

waters released into the irrigation canals to create more

11

flood storage space --

12
13

QUESTION:

Well, but it will create much more

flood storage space.

14

MR. FREDERICK:

15

QUESTION:

I'm sorry?

It will create more flood storage

16

space by releasing into the canals, but I don't know that

17

we can or should make the assumption that it was released

18

into the canals for that purpose.

19

MR. FREDERICK:

We can because in -- the way the

20

project was designed, in 1944 the Corps of Engineers

21

reported back to Congress and it said that if more than

22

7,000 cubic feet per second of water is released into the

23

San Joaquin River there will be a flood at Skagg's Branch,

24

and it also said the flood capacity of the dam is 12,000

25

cubic feet per second, and if you add 1,000 for the Madera
44

1

Canal and 4,000 for the Friant Current Canal, it is

2

unmistakably clear the Corps of Engineers intended for

3

these canals to receive the flood waters.

4

QUESTION:

But that's true -- that's true, and

5

so you take those times when in fact the San Joaquin below

6

the dam is filled to more than 7,000 -- what is it, cubic

7

feet per second.

8
9

Now, when we look at those days, we get maybe -I don't know how many days per year, but not all that

10

many, and maybe one every 3 years or something, but let's

11

say it's 100 days a year.

12

it isn't anywhere near that, but still, let's assume that.

13

Very well.

It's not more than that, which

On those 100 days, those releases

14

put water in the canal where it is at that time because it

15

is flood water, but on all the other days the water in

16

that canal is not where it is, because of any flood

17

control purpose, so we're talking about the water on all

18

those other days.

19

MR. FREDERICK:

MR. FREDERICK:

23

MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Breyer --

Yes.
-- as a factual matter --

the water had not been put into the canals, there would

have been flooding on the San Joaquin River.

QUESTION:

Excellent. Now let's talk about the

other 10 months.

theory, is not where it is in the canal because of flood

12

control, and so I think what Justice Souter was driving

13

at, and what I was, if all the water in the canal is

14

causing that damage, what reason would there be for

15

calling the water in those other 10 months flood water and

16

subjecting it to immunity?

17

The other 10 months, the water, on your

MR. FREDERICK:

Because they are making space so

that floods don't occur in those months.

QUESTION:

But let me ask you -- let me ask you

20

a hypothetical I have.

Suppose in the Madera Canal

21

there's a valve, and it goes into field A or field B.

22

Both are -- just for irrigation, and by mistake they open

23

the valve and it goes into field A and they leave it open

for 24 hours when it's only 12, and the barn gets flooded.

Immunity?

irrigate field B, or vice-versa, and there's damage.

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

That would be immunity.

QUESTION:

No, no, just change the hypothetical

24

to say that the release didn't cause a flood, it didn't --

25

but it was sudden release and somebody drowned in the

accident, then would there be immunity?

MR. FREDERICK:
has so held.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. FREDERICK:

6

QUESTION:

7

10

There would be immunity there?
Yes.

Even though it was released for

irrigation purposes?

8
9

Yes, and every court of appeals

MR. FREDERICK:

If the project is a flood

control project and there is a relation to flood control,
the courts have upheld the Government's immunity.

11

QUESTION:

In response to a question from

12

Justice Souter you agreed there could be an accident where

13

there wouldn't be immunity attached.

14

MR. FREDERICK:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes, and that would be --

What is your example?
Where a Government official like

17

a Fish & Wildlife Service official is on a flood control

18

facility, commits an act of negligence that causes a

19

person to drown --

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. FREDERICK:

22

25

-- that would not be covered by

the immunity.

23
24

Okay.

QUESTION:

So it's only the difference

between -QUESTION:

1

Ninth Circuit test, would it not?

MR. FREDERICK:

3

QUESTION:

4

It -- arguably, yes.

All right.

Yes.

So you don't really

support the Ninth Circuit test.

5

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, Justice Stevens, let me

6

just say that the Ninth Circuit itself is not wholly

7

consistent on this point.

8

a personal negligence case, the Ninth Circuit said there

9

must be a substantial factor between the Government's

In the McCarthy case, which was

10

activities and the accident, so even in the McCarthy case

11

the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit did not

12

strictly hew to its wholly-unrelated standard.

13

But I would point out --

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Frederick, may I go back to your

15

answer to Justice Stevens' question?

16

that the only -- that there will always be immunity if the

17

release is, in fact, an intentional release as opposed to

18

the negligent release, because whenever there is an

19

intentional release, as I understand your reasoning, there

20

will be, in fact, the creation of space to hold flood

21

water.

22

MR. FREDERICK:

23

QUESTION:

I take it, then,

That's correct.

And so that the only case in which

24

there will be -- there will not be immunity is the

25

negligence case, as in your example.
50

1
2

MR. FREDERICK:

QUESTION:

4

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, you just gave -For precisely the same reason.

That's flood water --

6

QUESTION:

7

there would not be immunity.

8
9

The immunity would apply to

negligence cases, too, Justice Souter, for precisely --

3

5

No.

-- an example of a case in which

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, let me distinguish

between --

10

QUESTION:

A negligence case like the negligence

11

case you just posited to Justice Stevens, that will be the

12

only kind of situation in which there will not be

13

immunity?

14

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

Escaping waters cases,

15

which is what this one is.

This water is not where it's

16

supposed to be.

17

Congress built the project to keep the water contained,

18

and that project is --

It has escaped from the project.

19

QUESTION:

But wait --

20

MR. FREDERICK:

-- collectively failing, is

21

foursquare within what Congress debated in the 1928 act.

22

It wanted these structures to succeed, but it did not want

23

the Government to have to defend lawsuits like this one

24

for time immemorial if they did not.

25

QUESTION:

I'll grant you, and this is directly
51

1

related to what was just said, that the water has come out

2

from behind the dam in order to make space for other

3

water.

4

That's flood control.
But the question here is, the water that came

5

out from the dam would naturally go into the San Joaquin.

6

It wouldn't naturally go into the Merced Canal, and if you

7

focus on the month of August, and you focus on the

8

decision to turn it from the San Joaquin below the dam

9

over to the Merced Canal, what has that to do with flood

10
11

control?
MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Breyer, I conceded that

12

if you were not to accept our broad view of every release

13

being for flood control, that you would then look at

14

whether or not there was a relation between the release

15

and flood control activities.

16

QUESTION:

Well, isn't part of the answer that

17

it allows release from the Sacramento into the San

18

Joaquin, which --

19

MR. FREDERICK:

20

QUESTION:

21
22

Yes.

I mean --

-- greatly alleviates the flood

waters on the Sacramento?
MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct.

It is a totally

23

integrated system, but Justice Breyer, if you were not to

24

accept our broadest submission, even under our narrower

25

submission we should prevail and get immunity in this
52

1

case, because it can be shown through contracts, through

2

regulations, through statutes that this canal serves and

3

is related to a flood control purpose, and the empirical

4

water data collected by the U.S. Geological Service that

5

we quoted in our brief indicates that well over half of

6

the water released in the last 20 years undoubtedly serves

7

a flood control purpose.

8

I mean, you know --

9

QUESTION:

10

Was this brought out at trial?

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

This was done on the

11

pleadings, Mr. Chief Justice, and we are allowed to defend

12

the judgment on an alternate ground and to provide public

13

record material --

14
15

QUESTION:

We rarely affirm on an alternate

ground.

16

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, in a way this is and this

17

is not an alternate ground.

18

judgment and the rationale for the judgment by showing the

19

relation of flood control in this particular project, and

20

we have --

QUESTION:

It is support for the

22

ground, this Court rarely takes submissions, even judicial

23

notice submissions as a matter of first instance.

24

would be asking us to sit essentially as the court of

25

first view on this theory and to look at things that were
53

never presented below, and that is an extraordinary thing

2

to ask this Court to do.

MR. FREDERICK:

6

This is stipulations they have agreed to in the

7

stipulations of fact.

8

This is the statutes.

This is the

This is historical public record material.

QUESTION:

No, but don't we have to understand

9

the terms of the contract where they have class I water

10

and class II water and class I water is for irrigation,

11

they pay a higher -- or they pay a lower rate, I guess, or

12

a higher rate for class I and so forth?

13

MR. FREDERICK:

No, you don't need to understand

14

all the terms of the contract to get the central point,

15

which is that --

16
17
18

QUESTION:

You don't want us to know about water

being in two classes?
MR. FREDERICK:

No, Justice Stevens.

What we

19

want you to know is that the contract provides for flood

20

water to be put into the Madera Canal, and therefore it

21

serves a flood control purpose.

22

need to understand about the contract, because it is a

23

matter that they've stipulated to, this is how the water

24

gets into the canal, and the parties have agreed that

25

flood water will be put into the canal as a matter of
54

That's all you really

1

agreement.

2

So when you look, Justice Ginsburg, at the

3

sources that we have relied upon to defend the judgment

4

and the rationale of the court of appeals, there is not

5

anything that would be developed by going back.

6

would be accomplished is that the Government would be

7

forced to defend, you know, document requests that called

8

for every scrap of paper in the Central Valley project and

9

in the Madera Canal over the last 65 years, and the

All that

10

question of sovereign immunity would not be one that could

11

be established at the pleadings stage.

12

It would, in fact, be subject to proof at every

13

step of the way, and this Court has made clear that not

14

only is sovereign immunity a principle of jurisdiction,

15

but it

but it's also a principle to avoid the Government having

MR. JONES:

If I could take you to our reply brief, because

4

we did address, although we objected to the judicial

noted that in a majority of the years in the 1979 to 1999

river bed never approached 8,000 cubic feet per second,

9

which petitioner gauged by setting thresholds of 7600

10

cubic feet per second on a single day of the entire year

11

and so, as far as petitioner could determine on those days

12

that flows into the river bed did approach 8,000 cubic
