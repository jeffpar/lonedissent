ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES S. REISCHEL

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. REISCHEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The principal issue here today is fundamental to

12

the functioning of our civil jury system, but it is one

13

which the courts of appeals have disagreed about for

14

decades.

15

aside a jury verdict in a civil case as against the weight

16

of the evidence is entitled to very substantial deference

17

by an appellate court.

18

That issue is whether a trial court which sets

We submit that the trial court is entitled to

19

such substantial deference.

20

standard is whether any reasonable judge could have

21

concluded that the verdict was against the weight of, the

22

great weight of the evidence.

23

Indeed, we submit that the

We submit that the D.C. Circuit below applied

24

the strict scrutiny standard, which boils down in practice

25

to whether there was sufficient evidence for the question
3

1

to go to the jury.

2

inconsistent with what a trial court does.

3

QUESTION:

We submit this was error.

It's

I thought that the court of appeals

4

used the expression, a more searching inquiry than had the

5

motion been denied.

6

strict scrutiny.

7
8

I didn't realize they used the term,

MR. REISCHEL:

I'm sorry, more searching inquiry

is the phrase that they do use.

9

QUESTION:

And they use the term, more searching

10

inquiry, as I understand it, to compare it with the sort

11

of inquiry where the district court has denied the motion

12

for a new trial?

13

MR. REISCHEL:

14

QUESTION:

15

Yes.

Certainly it's comparing it with

something.

16

MR. REISCHEL:

Yes, and there are also other

17

distinctions about the sort of error that's involved, but

18

yes.

19

QUESTION:

Is it your position that it is

20

exactly the same inquiry in the court of appeals whether a

21

district court grants a motion for a new trial or denies

22

it?

23

MR. REISCHEL:

Yes, Your Honor, it is, and our

24

position is, can any rational judge have made that

25

decision.
4

1

QUESTION:

It seems somehow counterintuitive,

2

though I realize that doesn't make it wrong, that where a

3

district -- where the trial judge is in effect giving

4

effect to the jury's verdict, he shouldn't get a more

5

lenient standard of review than when he disapproves it or

6

sets it aside.

7

MR. REISCHEL:

I don't think, on analysis, it

8

is.

This is ultimately rooted in the unique perspective a

9

trial court has on the evidence.

As Justice Black said in

10

Cone v. West Virginia Pulp & Paper, when a trial court in

11

ruling on a motion to set aside a trial, to order a new

12

trial, he has a fresh perspective on the evidence, he has

13

just seen it go in, he has also got a fresh perspective on

14

the effect, the impact of the evidence on the jury --

15
16

QUESTION:

But that's true whether he denies the

motion or grants it.

17

MR. REISCHEL:

That's true.

It's true in either

18

case, but the trial judge is there.

19

what happens, and for that reason the trial judge and the

20

trial judge alone can actually engage in weighing the

21

evidence.

22

QUESTION:

The trial judge sees

Well, when you say what this is

23

ultimately rooted in, I mean, whatever decision we come

24

out with has to be ultimately rooted in the Seventh

25

Amendment, I assume.
5

1

MR. REISCHEL:

2

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

And the Seventh Amendment certainly

3

has quite different application when you're talking about

4

a trial judge who has accepted the jury's verdict and, on

5

the other hand, a trial judge who has rejected the jury

6

verdict, in effect overridden it and said we have to have

7

a new trial.

8

has to apply to both of those situations when the Seventh

9

Amendment treats them differently.

10

I don't know why the same standard of review

MR. REISCHEL:

Well, the -- there is one minor

11

difference, and that is, the court has to look to whether

12

the trial court applied the proper standard.

13

when he sets side a verdict that's contrary to the weight

14

of the evidence, the question is, can a rational judge

15

have made that decision?

16

to the weight of the evidence.

17

QUESTION:

That is,

That is, was it clearly contrary

Sometimes the evidence would be

18

evidence that juries have particular ability to evaluate,

19

or at least the power is given to them saying witness

20

demeanor.

21

is not particularly one that's suited to a jury.

22

There could be other cases in which the matter

I mean, it turns -- he gives a new trial because

23

of something to do with a document and its admissibility

24

or something like that.

25

it's a matter that the juries are entrusted with the

Would you at least say that where

6

1

decision, a trial judge should be particularly careful of

2

granting a new trial contrary to the jury?

3

I mean, what I'm wondering at is -- what I'm

4

wondering about is if it perhaps is the same standard, but

5

in applying that same standard you should pay particular

6

attention when you overturn a jury verdict because, judge,

7

the jury has responsibilities to decide things that you

8

don't have.

9

MR. REISCHEL:

That's true, but the trial judge

10

has a much better take on both the force of the evidence

11

and the impact on the jury.

12

QUESTION:

No, if that's true, would you be

13

satisfied with that result?

14

well, in a sense it's the same standard, but what

15

searching inquiry means is, it means, after all, here you

16

are upholding the jury, not going against the jury, and if

17

you were going against the jury there are many reasons why

18

you should be very careful.

19

MR. REISCHEL:

Suppose this Court said,

Does that satisfy you?

I think that's implicit in the

20

great weight of the evidence part of the test.

21

rational judge has to be able to say that this was against

22

the great weight of the evidence.

23

QUESTION:

The

Oh, well then are we arguing about

24

anything other than just, which is often true in such

25

cases, words?
7

1

MR. REISCHEL:

I think the words have had real

2

consequences in appellate review.

3

what the D.C. Circuit and other circuits following the

4

Lindh decision actually do is, it boils down to was there

5

evidence to support the jury verdict?

I think if one looks to

6

If there was, they say that it was an abuse of

7

discretion to set it aside, but it's Hornbook law that a

8

court can set aside a jury verdict even if there's

9

substantial evidence to support it if the court makes an

10

independent determination, without drawing inferences for

11

the verdict, an independent determination that it's

12

contrary to the great weight of the evidence.

13

QUESTION:

Do you think that a jury verdict can

14

be against the great weight of the evidence when the only

15

thing that the judge disagrees with, the trial judge, is

16

the jury's evaluation of credibility?

17

MR. REISCHEL:

18

QUESTION:

19

great weight of the evidence?

Can that possibly be against the

20

MR. REISCHEL:

21

QUESTION:

22

There are a -- my answer is yes.

And if -- let me tell you why I asked

the question --

23

MR. REISCHEL:

24

QUESTION:

25

There are --

My answer is yes it can be.

-- because if not -- if not, then the

court of appeals is fully able to evaluate the issue as
8

1

effectively as the trial judge is.

2

MR. REISCHEL:

There are, Justice Scalia, a

3

range of different kinds of credibility determinations.

4

One might be what someone might call eyeball credibility.

5

You look at a person testifying, and are they lying, are

6

they sweating, are they nervous, all of that.

7

The other kind of credibility finding is, is

8

what they're -- does what they're saying make sense, and

9

to the extent that there's a credibility determination

10

involved here, the question went to the credibility of the

11

financial expert because the financial expert, Dr. Morris,

12

based his financial projections on data that wasn't rooted

13

in, and was contrary to, what the industry expert,

14

DiRenzo, said.

15

QUESTION:

Well, that's queer -- that's a queer

16

description of credibility.

17

facts that don't make sense are incredible.

18

suppose that's right, but I wouldn't consider that a

19

credibility determination.

20

determination of whether there was substantial evidence on

21

the record.

22

I mean, on that basis any
Yes, I

I'd consider that a

If there's something on the record that is

23

utterly incoherent and makes no sense, that's not

24

evidence.

25

appeals can evaluate that.

It's not adequate evidence, and a court of

9

1

I thought that when we're talking about

2

credibility we're talking about the eyeballing the

3

witnesses.

4

eyed, or whatever.

5

I don't believe this fellow, he's shifty-

MR. REISCHEL:

If we're talking about what I

6

would call eyeball credibility, the courts are -- the

7

circuits are in disagreement as to whether the trial judge

8

can reevaluate that independently.

9

QUESTION:

Some of them say no.

Mr. Reischel, I wasn't of the view

10

that this turns -- this power relates only to the

11

credibility of witnesses.

12

their determination to turn over a jury verdict based on

13

maybe a whole range of things that occur at trial,

14

including a judge might feel, I gave instructions that

15

would pass muster with the court of appeals, so they're

16

reversal-proof, but the jury didn't understand a damn word

17

I was saying.

18

I thought the judges exercised

Or a judge might say, I excluded certain

19

evidence that was favorable to the defendant.

20

could survive appellate review, but on thinking it over I

21

should have admitted the evidence and, either way, the

22

court of appeals wouldn't touch me.

23
24
25

That, too,

Those kinds of considerations don't go to
credibility of witnesses.
MR. REISCHEL:

That's true.
10

1
2

QUESTION:

But it's a sense that the judge has

that something went wrong at this trial.

3

MR. REISCHEL:

That's true, and the judge here

4

made two kinds of findings.

5

he excluded evidence he should not have and disabled the

6

jury in performing its function, and the most important

7

evidence that he excluded was the October 15 invitation to

8

be heard.

9

One, he made a finding that

The harm here was that Tri County Industries

10

said they were harmed because they hadn't been heard, but

11

then they turn around and spurn an invitation to be heard,

12

and the judge excluded that evidence, and he did so in

13

part because of his ruling that all these issues had been

14

resolved earlier, and then when he thought about it said,

15

that wasn't -- that isn't right, and it probably confused

16

the jury.

17

But -QUESTION:

Those things -- my point maybe wasn't

18

clear.

I'm not saying that eyeball credibility is the

19

only thing that the district judge can take into account.

20

Of course he can take into account these other things, but

21

these other things are evaluable by the court of appeals

22

just as readily as they're evaluable by the trial judge.

23

A court of appeals can say, well, this stuff was excluded.

24

It could have been let in, and if it had been let in, then

25

it would be different.
11

1

This instruction to the jury was confusing, you

2

can tell that from the cold record, and if that's so, I

3

don't know why you should give any special deference to

4

the trial jury.

5

MR. REISCHEL:

Well, the court of appeals can't

6

see the witnesses, and it can't see the jury, and it can't

7

tell what impact a particular witness might have on the

8

jury.

9

The key witness here for purposes of future

10

earnings was Dr. Morris, Dr. Morris who came on as a Ph.D.

11

and said, I've read a ton of things and I'm an expert in

12

this field, and I can do all these mathematical things,

13

but when he was cross-examined said, yes, but I based all

14

of my industry stuff on -- all my prices on the Apex

15

report by DiRenzo, and what DiRenzo's report said was that

16

prices were being driven down so that they barely covered

17

costs.

18

QUESTION:

Doesn't that go to the credibility of

19

the expert, whether what he relies on is worthy of

20

credence by the fact-finder?

21
22

MR. REISCHEL:

It goes to the probative force, I

think, of his testimony.

23

QUESTION:

24

testimony, which I thought --

25

How much weight you should give the

MR. REISCHEL:

That's correct, and that -12

1

QUESTION:

-- is a form of credibility.

2

MR. REISCHEL:

That's right, Justice O'Connor,

3

and that's precisely what the trial court could weigh and

4

what an appellate court cannot weigh.

5

QUESTION:

Well, but that's precisely what the

6

jury, the fact-finder must determine, and in this case it

7

was a jury.

8
9

Do you think that the appellate standard for
review is basically an abuse of discretion standard?

10

MR. REISCHEL:

11

follows from Gasperini.

12

correctly, that an appellate court can assess matters of

13

fact only if there's no reasonable disagreement about the

14

facts.

15

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

We think that

Gasperini says, if we read it

Okay.

Well, if it is abuse of

16

discretion there is still room within that standard, I

17

suppose, to say that a jury fact-finder determination on

18

credibility of witnesses is not to be disturbed by the

19

trial judge, and if the trial judge does, it's an abuse of

20

discretion.

21

MR. REISCHEL:

But this wasn't simply eyeball

22

credibility.

This was, is what the expert is doing here,

23

does it make sense?

24

future profits where the underlying industry evidence, the

25

only industry evidence produced also by Tri County, showed

He's testifying about projected

13

1

that this heat remediation that they were getting into was

2

a declining industry, and that the last --

3
4

QUESTION:

Yes, but didn't the jury discount his

testimony by about 50 percent anyway?

5

MR. REISCHEL:

The jury discounted his

6

testimony, but the jury still came up with a $4.64 million

7

return --

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. REISCHEL:

10
11
12

QUESTION:

And he said it should have been --- on a $9 million investment.

Well, I understand, but he said it

should have been twice that amount, didn't he?
MR. REISCHEL:

He said -- yes.

He said, 150

13

percent return per year, or 125 percent return per year.

14

The jury found 49 percent return per year for each of 7

15

years, in an industry where the segment of the industry

16

was shrinking, and the last entrant who had tried to come

17

in had found it necessary to gain market share to cut

18

prices below cost and had failed.

19

QUESTION:

I understand all that, but I thought

20

it was fairly elementary damage law that if you prove the

21

fact of damage, and I guess that was proved here, that --

22

and if there isn't a clear measure of damage out there,

23

the jury's allowed quite a bit of leeway in figuring the

24

amount of damage, and here they took half the expert's --

25

MR. REISCHEL:

The question is whether or not
14

1

the damage assessment is a reasonable one.

2

QUESTION:

Correct.

3

MR. REISCHEL:

And where Tri County's own

4

evidence is that the last person who entered failed, it's

5

a shrinking industry, and that prices are being driven

6

down just barely to cover costs, it's not reasonable to --

7
8

QUESTION:
there was no damage.

9

MR. REISCHEL:

10
11

But you didn't take the position

QUESTION:

No.

There were --

You took the position the amount was

exaggerated.

12

MR. REISCHEL:

The judge didn't take that

13

position, either.

The judge took the position that a

14

million dollars of damages, which would have been a 5-

15

percent return on investment, was about right because

16

there was a -- well, I assume because there was a

17

differential for transportation costs, but to project 49-

18

percent return each of 7 years in a declining industry

19

where the last person failed is not a reasonable

20

projection, and the judge said, this is pro forma.

21

has nothing to do with reality.

It

22

He said, at page JA-79, how do you explain this

23

in light of the fact that prices are being driven down to

24

costs?

25

How do you explain, he said in his decision -QUESTION:

Well, how did the judge explain the
15

1

million dollars, other than that was just a further

2

discount?

3

discount it more.

4

He said, oh, it's a failing industry.

I'll

It seems to me that's all he said.

MR. REISCHEL:

I think what he was finding was,

5

if one looks just at the industry testimony, that is

6

DiRenzo's testimony, that there was a slight boost for

7

this industry in D.C. because transportation costs were

8

slightly better, so one could say that they might be

9

entitled to make a modest return on investment.

5 percent

10

per year is a modest return on investment. 49 percent per

11

year for 7 years, I'd like to have that kind of --

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Reischel --

13

QUESTION:

What we've got here, Mr. Reischel,

14

the question before us is the standard that the court of

15

appeals should have applied, as opposed to, perhaps, what

16

it did apply, not whether it was right or wrong in this

17

particular case.

18

MR. REISCHEL:

19

QUESTION:

Right, but --

I was about to make the same

20

suggestion, and the discussion we're having, it seems to

21

me, demonstrates quite clearly that an appellate court can

22

inquire into this matter just as effectively as the

23

district court.

24

MR. REISCHEL:

25

QUESTION:

As I read --

You know, you're making points that
16

1

are there on the record, and reflected in the record

2

material.

3

MR. REISCHEL:

Well, as I read Gasperini,

4

appellate courts are not allowed to weigh evidence.

5

courts are.

6

allowed only to --

7

Appellate courts aren't.

QUESTION:

Trial

Trial courts are

Mr. Reischel, I'd like to clear the

8

air on Gasperini, because frankly I don't think it has

9

anything to do with this case.

I mean, Gasperini

10

concerned New York's attempt to get a handle on excessive

11

damages, and it did it -- instead of having a substantive

12

cap it had a procedural way of doing it.

13

Gasperini said, New York gave it to a court of

14

appeals.

You can't do that in a Federal system because

15

courts of appeals can't always see juries.

16

MR. REISCHEL:

17

QUESTION:

Weigh evidence.

The only one who can do it is the

18

trial court judge, so Gasperini had to do with the control

19

authority of a trial court judge.

20

to do with the perspective that the court of appeals was

21

to take vis-a-vis the trial court judge, and it didn't say

22

anything about the difference between, if there is any

23

between grant or denial, so I did not understand Gasperini

24

to address this question.

25

MR. REISCHEL:

It didn't have anything

No, Gasperini doesn't talk about
17

1

the difference between grants and denials, but the

2

linchpin of Gasperini as I read it, in terms of assessing

3

facts, is, they're quoting Dagnello v. Long Island,

4

whether there has been -- there must be an upper limit,

5

and whether that has been surpassed is not a question of

6

fact with respect to which reasonable men may differ, but

7

a question of law.

8

As I read Gasperini, what the Court was saying

9

was -- and this was about excessive damages -- that trial

10

courts can weigh things and examine things, but appellate

11

courts must take the facts as given unless it's beyond the

12

point where reasonable men can disagree.

13

Here, I don't think there's a question, and I

14

think that drives us to the standard that we propose,

15

which is whether a reasonable judge could have come to

16

this conclusion.

17

then there's room to disagree.

18

QUESTION:

19

If a reasonable judge couldn't have,

Well, there's a difference, too, when

we're talking about --

20

MR. REISCHEL:

21

QUESTION:

There's no --

-- is the flaw the excessive damages,

22

or is it some other thing that went wrong so that the

23

wrong person won.

24
25

Here, I take it it's the former, because the
judge said, remittitur, or if you won't take the
18

1

remittitur, a new trial, and I thought there was a legal

2

standard to govern remittitur.

3

supposed to set it at the maximum amount that a reasonable

4

jury could award on the basis of the evidence presented.

5

Isn't that the standard?

6

MR. REISCHEL:

That is, a trial judge is

That's correct.

That's correct,

7

and the judge thought, on the basis of the only competent

8

market evidence there could have only been a very modest

9

gain and not the sort of 49 percent per year gain that the

10

jury awarded, much less the 124 percent per year gain that

11

the financial expert projected.

12

But the court did say several different things.

13

Two rulings, the rulings on mitigation, which was a ruling

14

that if, as Tri County testified, that they thought they

15

were going to be $2 million a year in profits -- $2

16

million a year in profits from this new entity that they

17

were going to set up -- is it reasonable for them to do

18

absolutely nothing?

19

They didn't respond to a letter inquiry about

20

what their position was.

21

which said on its face if you don't pay this your license

22

is going to be suspended.

23

Mr. Reischel, you're still arguing

the merits of this particular ruling and what the court of
19

1

appeals did with it, rather than fitting it into a

standard argument.

decide here whether or not the court of appeals properly

reversed the trial judge's decision.

decide whether it applied the right standard.

I mean, I don't think we're going to

MR. REISCHEL:

Yes.

We're going to

I do that in part, Your

Honor, to show what the circuit's test has boiled down to.
QUESTION:

But can you say, as -- I thought that

the only question that I saw was that the D.C. Circuit

10

wrote one sentence that I thought was a throw-away line,

11

frankly, where it said that there's a more searching

12

inquiry when the judge grants a new trial motion than

13

where he denies it.

14

Then I thought to myself naively, where he

15

grants a motion, the court of appeals has to see if he

16

invaded, say, the credibility province of the jury, and

17

where he denies it they don't have to do that job, so

18

obviously it has to be more searching, and that stopped

19

right there.

20
21
22

All right, now, what's the response to that
naive argument?
MR. REISCHEL:

The response to that naive

23

argument is, the D.C. Circuit's standard boils down to, if

24

there's sufficient evidence to go to the jury, that's the

25

end of the inquiry.
20

1

QUESTION:

But why isn't that answer -- I have

2

the same question that Justice Breyer does, and why isn't

3

your answer, in effect, another answer of the sort, they

4

got it wrong in applying their standard?

5

I mean, you're saying, you know, what they were

6

really doing was something other than what the verbal

7

formula suggested, and maybe that's so, and maybe they

8

applied their verbal formula wrongly, but is the formula

9

itself, is the statement of the standard wrong?

10

MR. REISCHEL:

The standard as the D.C. Circuit

11

has explicated it, particularly in the Taylor case, which

12

respondent cites at page 26 of its brief, explains what

13

the D.C. Circuit understands, and it says that when a

14

trial court sets aside a jury verdict, the appellate

15

court's normal allegiance to the trial court falls away,

16

and its allegiance is to the jury, and that drives them to

17

the point, which they did in this case, of saying, if

18

there's enough evidence to go to the jury, that's the end

19

of the inquiry.

20

QUESTION:

All right.

May I put my question in

21

a different way?

I think it's the same question that

22

Justice Breyer has been asking.

23

looking at the problem, and after I've stated the two ways

24

I'm going to ask you whether there is anything other than

25

a verbal difference between them.
21

Here are two ways of

1

One way of looking at the problem of trying to

2

derive a standard would be this way.

3

standard for the appellate court to apply, and it's an

4

abuse of discretion standard.

5

discretion standard to a denial of a new trial, it's

6

fairly easy, because we place great weight on the jury

7

verdict itself.

8

verdict.

9

There is only one

When applying an abuse of

We place great respect on the jury

But when applying the abuse standard to a jury

10

verdict -- I'm sorry, to an appellate -- to a trial court

11

decision that grants a new trial, that vacates the

12

verdict, we have to look very carefully at the facts and

13

the record for the simple reason that we do have great

14

respect for the jury verdict.

15

In each case, we're applying the same standard,

16

abuse of discretion, but in the two cases we have to look

17

to different kinds, or at least to different degrees of

18

factual data.

19

That's one way of looking at it.

Another way of looking at it is to say, when a

20

trial court in effect denies a new trial, we say, well,

21

abuse of discretion.

22

trial court grants the new trial we engage in reviewing it

23

in a more searching inquiry because, in fact, we have

24

great respect for the jury verdict.

25

That's all we look at.

But when a

Is there any difference, except a verbal
22

1

difference, between those two ways of looking at what an

2

appellate court does when it reviews a trial court's

3

decision?

4

MR. REISCHEL:

There has been a difference in

5

application which has driven the appellate courts to ask

6

only, was there sufficient evidence to --

7

QUESTION:

Well, is your answer then that the

8

way I put it there's nothing but a verbal difference, but

9

the way the courts are applying it, they are importing

10

something beyond a verbal difference in the way they are

11

applying it?

12

MR. REISCHEL:

They are imposing a more

13

stringent standard.

14

stringent anyhow, because the great weight of the evidence

15

point is built into it when there's a reversal, and it's

16

not built into it when there's a denial.

17

QUESTION:

In a way the standard is more

Well, what is your standard?

If the

18

standard is not, was there sufficient evidence to go to

19

the jury, which I assume is the same as saying, could a

20

reasonable jury, on the basis of this evidence, have found

21

for the plaintiff, if that is not the test that the

22

appellate court is supposed to use in deciding whether it

23

was wrongful for the trial court to set aside the jury

24

verdict, then what is the test?

25

Do you think the trial court can set aside the
23

1

jury verdict even when a reasonable jury on these facts

2

could have found for the plaintiff in this amount?

3

MR. REISCHEL:

Yes, Your Honor.

That's Hornbook

4

law, that when -- even though there's sufficient evidence

5

to uphold a jury verdict, it can be set aside so long as

6

the trial court thinks it's against the great weight of

7

the evidence, and that goes back to Blackstone, whose test

8

was, was the judge reasonably dissatisfied therewith.

15

MR. REISCHEL:

Precisely, Your Honor.

Courts of

appeals are substituting the matter-of-law test for the

17

new trial test, and that's exactly what --

18

QUESTION:

Aren't you overlooking something

19

rather important?

It isn't only the weight of the

4

improper now to assess the relative strength of the

5

parties showings, and then they go on to say that it was

error for the court to take it away from the jury.

7

They seemed to agree with the statement on
Tri County responds that it is

This is a directed verdict standard.

It's the

8

wrong standard.

It negates what the trial court is doing,

9

and an appellate -- the standard should be whether a

10

reasonable judge could have come to the conclusion that

11

this was contrary to the great weight of the evidence, and

12

we believe that was clearly so here for two reasons, one

13

because it was clearly unreasonable for a company that was

14

going to get $2 million a year to do nothing whatsoever to

15

protect that investment and because the forecast evidence

16

of financial gain was so out of line with the market

17

evidence that Tri County produced.

18

QUESTION:

Then you would be satisfied in this

19

case for us simply to say there is a difference between

20

the JNOV standard and the great weight of the evidence

21

standard.

You can answer that yes or no and

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK J. EMIG

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5
6

MR. EMIG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

7

I find that the standard for granting a new

8

trial was suggested in the Honda Motor v. Oberg case,

9

where, in situations involving excessiveness of a jury

10

verdict, or a verdict against the clear weight of the

11

evidence, could a national trier of the fact have reached

12

the same conclusions as the jury?

13

If a rational trier of the fact could come to

14

that conclusion, then those traditional common law grounds

15

for granting a common law trial simply do not exist.

16

QUESTION:

But if a rational trier of fact could

17

not have reached that conclusion, it isn't setting aside a

18

jury verdict JMOL.

19

reach a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, it seems to me

20

the case never should have gone to the jury in the first

21

place.

I mean, if a rational jury could not

22

MR. EMIG:

23

50 disposition at that point.

24

QUESTION:

25

That's correct.

It's probably a Rule

So you say there's no difference

between JNOV and setting aside a jury verdict that's
26

1

contrary to the great weight of the evidence.

2

that's revolutionary, I think.

3

MR. EMIG:

No, I don't think I'm going to that

4

extent, Your Honor.

I think, though, that in situations

5

in which there is a verdict against the clear weight of

6

the evidence or excessive damage, you have an element of

7

sympathy or prejudice that is injected in the jury verdict

8

which makes it not tied to the specific facts of the case,

9

and for that reason the trial judge has some discretion

10
11

I mean,

and of course can grant a new -QUESTION:

But by hypothesis there a rational

12

jury could reach a verdict in favor of the party whom it

13

did, but there are other considerations brought to bear.

14

You have great weight of the evidence, you know, improper

15

admission, things like that, that permit the grant of a

16

new trial where it would not have permitted the grant of a

17

motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.

18

MR. EMIG:

There are situations in which a new

19

trial can be granted, you're correct, that deal with

20

improper instructions, improper admissions of evidence, I

21

would agree with that, but to the extent of a verdict

22

being against the clear weight of the evidence, if a

23

rational trier of fact could come to the same conclusion

24

as that jury, then I don't think it should be set aside by

25

a trial judge.
27

1

QUESTION:

Okay, but you also accept the

2

distinction that there is a distinction between whether an

3

issue of damages can go to the jury, i.e., is there enough

4

evidence to get it to the jury, and on the other hand the

5

question whether the jury's verdict of damages should be

6

set aside as against the great weight of the evidence

7

because it's excessive.

8

MR. EMIG:

Yes --

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

10

MR. EMIG:

-- I do see a distinction.

11

QUESTION:

Okay, well, if you do accept that

12

distinction, then what is your criterion for whether it

13

ever gets to the jury or not?

14

different, as you've just said, from the criterion of

15

whether, after the jury verdict, the judge can declare a

16

new trial.

I assume it is something

17

MR. EMIG:

I think it --

18

QUESTION:

And I assume it is not, therefore,

19

whether a rational jury, on the basis of this evidence,

20

could reach that result, which is your standard for a new

21

trial.

22

So what is your standard for JNOV, then?
MR. EMIG:

Well, certainly the JNOV is phrased

23

in the light most favorable to the party that is seeking,

24

or that the judgment is being sought against.

25

QUESTION:

Yes, but isn't the -28

1

QUESTION:

That's the distinction, that for JNOV

2

you do not have to view all the evidence in the light most

3

favorable to the plaintiff, that -- I'm sorry, for a new

4

trial you don't have to regard all the evidence in the

5

light most favorable to the plaintiff.

6

sit back and evaluate it impartially.

You're allowed to

7

MR. EMIG:

I think that --

8

QUESTION:

That would be a distinction.

9

MR. EMIG:

That would be, and I think the rules

10

under Rule 50 do talk in terms of phrasing it, or phrase

11

it more in terms of in a light more favorable to the

12

plaintiff, or to the --

13

QUESTION:

What we've got here, Mr. -- some

14

fundamentals first, and that is, a refusal of the trial

15

judge to let the case go to the jury on the directed

16

verdict against the plaintiff and a judgement as a matter

17

of law, or call it that, or granting a motion for a

18

judgment as a matter of law after the jury returns a

19

verdict is the rational basis standard.

20

rational jury could have reached the verdict that this

21

jury did, and that is not involved here, I take it.

22

That is, no

What we're talking about is the grant of a new

23

trial by the trial judge, and by hypothesis, a rational

24

jury could have reached a verdict but still have it set

25

aside because it's against the great weight of the
29

1

evidence, and the standard now we're talking, we want to

2

find out, when the trial judge grants a motion for a new

3

trial that way, what standard should the court of appeals

4

apply?

5

MR. EMIG:

Well, I think the court has to decide

6

whether there is a conflict in the evidence.

7

reasonably have reached the conclusion, based upon the

8

evidence, that it did, and unless -- I would point out

9

this, also --

10

QUESTION:

Could a jury

But you're just -- when you start

11

talking about, could a reasonable jury have reached the

12

result, you're back to the judgment NOV, or judgment MOL

13

as they call it now, rather than weight of the evidence.

14

MR. EMIG:

I think that's the only way I can

15

explain how a trial judge should look at the evidence in

16

terms of whether or not a new trial should be granted.

17

would suggest it's certainly not the standard that the

18

District of Columbia suggests, that a trial judge has

19

unlimited discretion to grant a new trial as long as his

20

view of the evidence is reasonable.

21
22
23

QUESTION:

Well, what is -- what should be the

MR. EMIG:

I think it should be the standard

I

standard?

24

that was referred to in the Honda v. Oberg case, a --

25

could a rational trier of fact reach the same conclusion
30

1

as the jury.

2

QUESTION:

What does Wright and Miller say?

I

3

mean, this is a subject -- I can only remember -- it was

4

in my first year of law school, and all I remember from

5

that is, they said, it's certainly different.

6

even remember that right.

7

(Laughter.)

8

QUESTION:

9

I might not

I thought it was absolutely

different, and everything's changed since then anyway, so

10

what do Wright and Miller and the people who write about

11

this say is the standard for giving a new trial, as

12

opposed to a standard for giving a directed verdict?

13

MR. EMIG:

Well, I don't see them distinguishing

14

them.

15

appeals cases talk in terms of whether, on great weight of

16

the evidence --

17

I think that a number of the circuit court of

QUESTION:

They use the words, great weight of

18

the evidence?

What does Wright and Miller say?

19

the writers -- this is a rather basic question, I think,

20

that must be -- I can go look it up myself, but -- I will,

21

too, but --

22

(Laughter.)

23

MR. EMIG:

What do

There's certainly some discretion,

24

Your Honor, but at the same time, at no point in this

25

opinion from the district court does it ever say that this
31

1

jury verdict is being set aside because it was against the

2

great weight of the evidence.

3

foreign to this district court opinion, and the only

4

grounds that is asserted by the district court judge is

5

excessiveness on one point of view.

6

the traditional, this is against the great weight of the

7

evidence.

8
9

QUESTION:
appropriate.

That is a term that is

He does not rely on

Mr. Emig, well, that's perfectly

That's what the whole remittitur thing is

10

about.

11

the judge can say, plaintiff, you either take a reduction

12

or I'm going to order a new trial, and that is quite

13

distinct from, was there sufficient evidence to go to the

14

jury.

15

If the judge thinks that the verdict is excessive

MR. EMIG:

That's correct, except in this

16

particular situation we know that it was not an

17

excessive -- we knew that from the evidence that was

18

presented of approximately $12 million that a rational

19

trier of the fact could have brought back a verdict

20

anywhere up to that amount.

21

QUESTION:

But you're going back again to the

22

sufficiency, and Rule 50 would never, if these two

23

standards were so close, put the -- put on the district

24

court the very difficult chore of having to say, now, if I

25

reject the judgment as a matter of law, I have to rule
32

1

alternatively, or if I grant the motion for judgment as a

2

matter of law I have to rule alternatively on the new

3

trial motion, so that making a district judge do that

4

would be cruel and unusual punishment if these weren't

5

discrete inquiries.

6

MR. EMIG:

Well, except that a trial judge must

7

be limited, I think, by the evidence to some extent when

8

he rules on whether or not a verdict is excessive,

9

otherwise he can call whatever verdict he wants and term

10

it excessive, thereby nullifying a valid jury.

11

to be some basis other than the judge's characterization

12

of --

13

QUESTION:

There has

Did this trial judge decide that he'd

14

made an error in excluding evidence at trial, and

15

therefore wanted to correct that error somehow?

16

MR. EMIG:

He did, Your Honor, but the problem

17

of that analysis was there was no proffer by the District

18

of Columbia to show how the health and safety of this

19

project could ever result in a revocation of the permit.

20

The District of Columbia came into this trial with the

21

expectation --

22

QUESTION:

But at least the trial judge's ruling

23

may have been based on his notion that he'd made a mistake

24

by excluding certain evidence that the defendants offered.

25

MR. EMIG:

That's correct, except that that
33

1

conclusion was not supported by the evidence.

2

QUESTION:

Okay, well, you've shown us why you

3

think the trial judge's ruling was improper.

4

the court of appeals.

5

appeals have decided when it heard your argument?

6

MR. EMIG:

We're not

What standard should the court of

Well, I think it should have applied

7

an abuse of discretion standard.

The problem that I have

8

with this entire more searching inquiry, Your Honor, is,

9

the D.C. Circuit has been using it for 30 years, and at no

10

point in that course of time did they ever say, we are

11

applying it, that's changing the standard of review to a

12

strict abuse of discretion.

13

QUESTION:

Well, certainly the term, more

14

searching inquiry, suggests they're going to be a little

15

more demanding, or more willing to reverse the grant of a

16

new trial than they will the denial of a new trial.

17

MR. EMIG:

That's correct.

18

QUESTION:

And is there anything wrong with that

19

point of view?

20

MR. EMIG:

Well, I don't see any --

21

QUESTION:

It would help you here.

22

MR. EMIG:

I'm not sure it changed the standard

23

of review.

The --

24

QUESTION:

Well --

25

MR. EMIG:

The review was still abuse of
34

1

discretion.

2

QUESTION:

Yes, well, but as pointed out by some

3

of my colleagues abuse of discretion, but being more

4

willing to reverse the grant of a new trial under some

5

circumstances than the denial of a new trial.

6
7

MR. EMIG:

they're more willing to reverse --

8
9

I don't think they actually say

QUESTION:

Well, but then, certainly, what does

a more searching inquiry mean, then?

10

MR. EMIG:

Well, I think it's a simple

11

recognition that we're dealing with a jury reaching a

12

certain determination and the judge disagreeing and

13

granting a new trial.

14
15

QUESTION:

That is to way, there are just more

things in the record to review?

16

MR. EMIG:

I think it's just an indication

17

they're being a little more careful, Your Honor.

18

don't --

I

19

QUESTION:

Do you --

20

MR. EMIG:

I don't think it really substantively

21

changed the analysis of the case.

22

occasions they reviewed for abuse of discretion, nothing

23

more, and if they intended more searching inquiry to mean

24

stricter abuse of discretion, they would have said it, but

25

they never -35

They said on three

2

QUESTION:

Why do you think they said, more

searching inquiry, then?

3

MR. EMIG:

Well, because I think --

4

QUESTION:

What does more searching inquiry

6

MR. EMIG:

They don't define that, and --

7

QUESTION:

But it -- you can always go to a

5

8

mean?

dictionary and figure out for yourself what it means.

9
10

MR. EMIG:

I understand.

It certainly means, at

the very least, a more close look at the evidence, but --

11

QUESTION:

Okay.

Let's take a more close look,

12

rather than more searching inquiry.

13

the same thing, and it means a greater willingness to

14

reverse in the case of grant of a new trial than denial of

15

a new trial.

16

MR. EMIG:

Both a pretty much

No, I disagree with that.

I think

you're making a jump in terms of an outcome that is

suggested by that standard that is not accurate. I

We're not

We're not looking at favoring the

We're just going to look at what happened more

Well, you don't have to favor a

24

plaintiff or a defendant in that sort of an equation.

25

favor the person who got the jury verdict.
36

You

1
2

MR. EMIG:

Well, I don't think it favors either

the jury verdict or the district court, which --

3

QUESTION:

Well, sure it does.

If you're going

4

to conduct a more -- look, if the plaintiff had the

5

judgment, any inquiry regarding the setting aside of that

6

judgment which is going to be more searching is going to

7

make it more likely that that setting aside will be held

8

to be improper, so it will inevitably favor the plaintiff

9

whose jury verdict has been set aside.

10
11

MR. EMIG:

I mean, it's not

always the plaintiff.

12
13

Or a defendant.

QUESTION:

Yes, okay, whichever.

In the case of

a remittitur it's always going to be the plaintiff, but --

14

QUESTION:

Yes, but it's still true that even

15

though it's more searching than the converse, it still has

16

to be an abuse of discretion, and an abuse of discretion

17

standard itself tends to protect the trial judge from

18

reversal.

19

MR. EMIG:

An abuse of discretion is a

20

deferential standard, I would agree, but at the same

21

time --

22
23

QUESTION:

Do you support the court of appeals

decision or do you not?

I can't tell from what you say.

MR. EMIG:

Oh, I do, Your Honor.

I thought you won, and I thought you

were here saying yes, they got it right.

I --

But you're not saying that,

apparently.

MR. EMIG:

No, I am.

I simply do not understand your

Did they get it right?

They got it right.

searching inquiry, was that right?

13

MR. EMIG:

Yes, that's correct.

14

QUESTION:

So they did do that, and that's okay?

15

MR. EMIG:

That's okay.

16

QUESTION:

All right.

17

MR. EMIG:

But my other point, too is, just

18

looking under, if this verbal formulation was omitted from

19

the opinion it would still be the correct result.

20

still an abuse of discretion by the trial court.

It was

But if the court of appeals had not

applied that standard, maybe it would not have been in

your view the correct result.

Maybe they would have

QUESTION:

You're saying that you don't mind if

2

we remand this for determination of the abuse of

discretion standard.

4

MR. EMIG:

It doesn't make any difference.
I think it's already been reviewed

5

under an abuse of discretion standard, but I would

6

secondly say that this Court affirms judgments, not

7

opinions, and that even if this Court were to find that a

stricter abuse of discretion standard was applied, the

result is still the same.

The district court abused its

QUESTION:

Then we shouldn't dismiss the writ as

improvidently granted.

13

QUESTION:

You'd be happy with that, right?

14

MR. EMIG:

Yes, Your Honor.

15

QUESTION:

Nothing turns on it.

But there is

16

one feature of this, we go back for the Seventh Amendment

17

to how things were at common law, and at common law, as I

18

understand it, the appellate bench had no role at all in

19

any of this, that it was the trial court, it could be the

20

poll court at Westminster, but here it's kind of an irony

21

that the appellate court that shouldn't have been in it at

22

all is exercising muscle vis-a-vis the trial court that at

23

common law had the only word on whether there be a new

24

trial.

25

MR. EMIG:

Well, I don't think that this is
39

1

completely out of the range of appellate review.

2

QUESTION:

If --

But why, if you were adhering to the

3

model at the time that the Nation was formed, why wouldn't

4

you say the appellate court, whatever roles there are in

5

this, yours has got to be minimal, because you didn't even

6

have a say at common law.

7

MR. EMIG:

Well, I think you had a say to the

8

extent if an error of law was committed that could always

9

be appealed, but at the same time, the modern courts have

10

allowed if the judge makes an error to have that decision

11

set aside and a new trial, or the original jury verdict

12

reinstated.

13

QUESTION:

But the discretion on setting aside a

14

verdict as against the weight of the evidence was

15

entirely, as I understand it, in the hands of the trial

16

bench.

17

charge, no errors, no reversible errors in the admission

18

of evidence, but against the weight of the evidence was

19

trial court business and not appellate business.

20

Just, not any errors of law made, no errors in the

MR. EMIG:

Well, I guess that depends on whether

21

the en banc court was looked on as operating in an

22

appellate capacity in reviewing the facts.

23

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Emig, you didn't give us

24

any assistance by discussing that common law in your

25

brief, but I have scratched around and I think there was
40

1

a -- you know, I dissented in Gasperini because I thought

2

that there was no review at common law, but what the

3

situation as I understand it was, was that there was no

4

review when the district judge, when the trial judge

5

refused to set aside the trial, but that there was review

6

in the situation we have here, when the trial judge did

7

set aside.

8
9

There are several cases in which the appellate
court looked into whether that was proper or not, so

10

I'm -- you know, I'm -- now, where does that leave me?

11

I thought we were wrong in Gasperini, and there were

12

several on this who joined me, in allowing appellate

13

review at all -- we allowed appellate review there on the

14

basis of abuse of discretion.

15

should have an even stricter standard when there's review

16

in the situation where the jury verdict is ignored, so I

17

guess there should be something beyond abuse of

18

discretion, or should -- I don't know.

19

MR. EMIG:

If

I guess to be consistent we

Well, I -- my position in this, Your

20

Honor, is that it was not set aside, the jury verdict,

21

because it was against the great weight of the evidence,

22

that there was no evidence in this case of damages.

23

QUESTION:

You want to reargue your case.

Now,

24

why did you take it as an assumption that if you lose on

25

this issue it's going to go right back to the D.C.
41

1

Circuit, if you lose on the issue which is in front of us,

2

which is not the issue that either of you apparently wants

3

to argue, and that's the issue about whether -- it says,

4

did Gasperini make unlawful the throw-away line that the

5

D.C. Circuit threw in.

6

Now, maybe we shouldn't be hearing that, but

7

we're hearing it, so my question concerns that, and I've

8

looked at Wright and Miller, and as I look at their

9

standards for new trial it strikes me that I understand

10

very well your uncertainties, because what it says is,

11

there are all kinds of verbal formulations all over the

12

place, and you say the D.C. Circuit has adjusted to this

13

over 30 years, and I expect other circuits have adjusted

14

over similar periods of time to different verbal

15

formulations, and if we start fooling around with those in

16

this case, there is no matter so close to the heart of the

17

trial bar, and suddenly we will discover different

18

circuits doing different things in light of what we say.

19

So if we say you're right on these words,

20

searching inquiry, some other circuit is going to take

21

that as a signal that they're wrong and, therefore, if we

22

allow the D.C. Circuit to do what it did for 30 years,

23

some other circuit will be unable to do what it has done

24

for 30 years, so what do we do?

25

MR. EMIG:

I think the one thing that can be
42

1

done is simply to look at the opinion itself from the

2

district court granting the new trial and, if you feel

3

only an abuse of discretion standard is applicable and

4

should not be applied more strictly, does that opinion, in

5

and of itself, constitute an abuse of discretion.

6

QUESTION:

You want me to go back and look at

7

the facts here in your case, which I do not intend to do,

8

so ruling that out, what do I do?

9

MR. EMIG:

Then I think in that situation my

10

position is, it's entirely unclear in terms of what they

11

meant and how it was applied.

12

QUESTION:

But I thought one of your arguments

13

in answer to the petitioner was, petitioner, you knew all

14

along that the D.C. Circuit is applying a stricter

15

standard when it's reviewing grants than when it reviews

16

denial.

17

when you were before that court, so it's too late.

18

knew that they were going to apply a stricter standard to

19

grants than denials, you should have told them, D.C.

20

Circuit, don't do what you're doing for 30 years.

21

didn't tell them that, so you effectively forfeited the

22

point.

You knew it, and you didn't tell the D.C. Circuit
If you

You

23

You made that argument in your brief to us.

24

MR. EMIG:

I did.

25

QUESTION:

So you must think that this was a
43

1

standard that had some bite to it.

2

MR. EMIG:

I think when we included it in our

3

brief we were simply asking the Court to pay close

4

attention to the facts of the case.

5

If D.C. thought that that entailed a stricter

6

abuse of discretion review, that should have been brought

7

up at that point and it could have been resolved one way

8

or the other by the court of appeals, but they had their

9

opportunity and all of a sudden it becomes a problem now,

10

when the decision comes, and there's this verbal

11

formulation of a more searching inquiry.

12

But the fact of the matter is, the D.C. Circuit

13

only says, abuse of discretion, and I think that under

14

those circumstances that was the correct standard to

15

apply, and that they were certainly entitled to review the

16

record more carefully because a jury verdict had been set

17

aside.
