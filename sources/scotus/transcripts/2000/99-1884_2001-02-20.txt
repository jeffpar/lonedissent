ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM P. O'MALLEY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. O'MALLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Essentially involved in this case is the failure

12

of the Third Circuit Court to apply the rationale espoused

13

by this Court in Custis v. United States, to conclude that

14

constitutional deprivations other than deprivation of the

15

right to counsel can be addressed in habeas corpus

16

proceedings as constituting a collateral effect enhancing

17

the sentence of someone in custody under a conviction that

18

they are seeking to attack in the Federal habeas corpus

19

proceedings.

20

In this case, Edward Coss had been convicted in

21

the mid-eighties of simple assault and institutional

22

vandalism and had been sentenced to incarceration, and he

23

had completely served his sentence.

24
25

QUESTION:

Had he filed an appeal from that

conviction, ever?

MR. O'MALLEY:

MR. O'MALLEY:

A direct appeal?

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

The conviction was affirmed.

And then he filed for State post-

conviction relief?

10

MR. O'MALLEY:

11

QUESTION:

He did, Your Honor.

On the inadequate assistance of

counsel claim?

13

MR. O'MALLEY:

QUESTION:

15

Does the record

say what happened to the direct appeal?
MR. O'MALLEY:

He filed a direct appeal

And what happened?

Yes.

from that conviction.

5
6

Yes, he did, Your Honor.

Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.

And does the record tell us why the

State courts never dealt with that?

16

MR. O'MALLEY:

No, the record does not tell us

17

why the State courts did not deal with that.

18

wasn't dealt with.

19

QUESTION:

It just

So we can assume that it may have

20

been because the State court just neglected to get around

21

to it?

22

MR. O'MALLEY:

All assumptions are possible, and

23

that certainly is one of them.

It slipped through the

24

cracks somehow, and I've not been able to determine how,

25

Ypur Honor.

QUESTION:

But you agree that the respondent was

2

not at fault in failing to have the State court review

3

that claim?

4

MR. O'MALLEY:

Well, I wouldn't go quite that

5

far, Your Honor, because the respondent could have

6

requested that the matter be brought up for a hearing.

7

just filed his post-conviction collateral petition and

then --

An answer is not required under the

QUESTION:

Then it just

sat.
MR. O'MALLEY:

It sat.

He could have called it

17

up, but in the meantime his conviction -- his sentence

18

expired, and that's an equally reasonable inference as to

19

why no action was taken, because he got out of jail, and

20

the purpose of --

21

QUESTION:

Well, but the conviction has

22

subsequent consequences, as we see from this case, so it

23

still could be a matter of significance to the respondent.

24
25

MR. O'MALLEY:

Yes, it could be a matter of

significance to that extent, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Was he entitled, under Pennsylvania

2

law, after release from custody, to continue the

3

collateral attack on his conviction?

4

MR. O'MALLEY:

No.

I believe, Your Honor, under

5

the Pennsylvania law he would have to be in custody to

6

continue his attack on that conviction.

7
8

QUESTION:

So then, at that point,

there's nothing he can do to attack his conviction?

9
10

All right.

MR. O'MALLEY:

That would be correct, Your

Honor.

11

QUESTION:

Do you have authority for that, that

12

you've cited, that there is nothing that the Pennsylvania

13

courts could have done at that juncture, when he was out

14

of custody?

15

MR. O'MALLEY:

Your Honor, I think that's to be

16

found in the Pennsylvania Post-Conviction Relief Act.

17

think the requirement of custody is implicit in the Act,

or is --

For obtaining the relief.

I

think it's in the Act, but I do know, Your Honor, that

Pennsylvania cases have construed that if you're not in

25

custody you don't get-post conviction relief, Act relief.

Following the completion and full service of his

2

sentence for that conviction in the eighties, Mr. Coss got

3

in trouble with the law again and was found guilty of

4

assault and was sentenced to a separate term.

conviction and sentence was considered by the court.

It was just noted by the court.

the district court and by the Third Circuit Court.

10

The record

That was found both by

Coss filed his petition pro se.

His Federal

11

habeas corpus petition was filed pro se, and the district

12

court, according due deference to his 19 -- or, to his

13

Federal habeas corpus petition, construed it as an attack

14

on his later conviction in the 1990's, as well as an

15

attack on his 1980's conviction, and denied Mr. Coss

16

relief based upon the fact that, although ineffective

17

assistance of counsel was made to appear from the evidence

18

that Mr. Coss suffered no prejudice.

19

Mr. Coss then appealed to the Third Circuit and

20

the Third Circuit reversed the district court, finding

21

that prejudice was shown by Mr. Coss and finding also, or

22

ruling also that because Coss' claim of ineffective

23

assistance of counsel in his 1980's conviction was -- had

24

an effect upon the sentence he received for his 1990's

25

conviction, that he was entitled to Federal habeas relief.

1

And the means by which the Third Circuit reached

2

that conclusion is the principal matter that I believe

3

needs to be addressed here this morning, because what the

4

Third Circuit did was relied principally upon

5

jurisprudence developed in the Third Circuit which, for

6

all intents and purposes, reverses district court judges

7

that don't treat attacks on subsequent convictions that

8

were enhanced, sentences of which were enhanced by prior

9

convictions.

10

The Third Circuit reverses those judges and

11

says, you should have found that this collateral

12

enhancement on grounds other than Gideon violations is

13

something that we will not tolerate in this Circuit.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. O'MALLEY:

16

QUESTION:

17

Mr. O'Malley -Yes.

You say in your brief that your

argument is decided, divided into two parts.

18

MR. O'MALLEY:

19

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

One is a question left over, left

20

open in Maleng v. Cook as to whether the custody

21

requirement of the Federal statute is satisfied here.

22

MR. O'MALLEY:

23

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

And then the second is I guess what

24

you've been talking about during most of your argument,

25

what kinds of claims may you make if the Maleng question

1

is decided against you.

2

about the question left open in Maleng v. Cook, or are you

3

going to leave that to your briefs?

4

MR. O'MALLEY:

Are you going to say anything

Well, no, I am going to say

5

something about the question left open by Maleng v. Cook.

6

It is our position that the holding of Maleng v. Cook has

7

been misunderstood by the Third Circuit.

8
9

The holding of Maleng v. Cook clearly seems to
say that a person may not attack, or a person is not in

10

custody under a prior conviction once he has fully served

11

that conviction, but the Third Circuit reaches a different

12

conclusion by looking at the result that was reached in

13

Maleng, because in Maleng the Court will recall that the

14

petitioner was granted relief, but in that case the basis,

15

as I read Maleng, for the petitioner being granted relief

16

was principally that there was a custodial nexus between

17

the earlier conviction and sentence and that which he was

18

attacking in his Federal habeas corpus petition, that

19

custodial nexus being the hold that was placed upon him

20

for the State conviction that he would be obliged to

21

serve.

22

In this case, however, there is no custodial

23

nexus to connect the fully expired sentence to the

24

sentence that the Court construed he was attacking in his

25

Federal habeas corpus petition.

1

QUESTION:

Well, how can you say there's no

2

connection when the second sentence, the length of the

3

second sentence is determined by the fact that there was

4

an earlier conviction?

5

MR. O'MALLEY:

Your Honor, yes, but I was

6

talking about a custodial nexus, and I believe that the

7

determinative factor in Maleng v. Cook was the custodial

8

nexus.

I think the question of the simple enhancement --

9

QUESTION:

Well, but this --

10

QUESTION:

He was in custody on the prior

11

conviction, not just because of the prior conviction.

12

was serving the sentence that had been imposed for the

13

prior conviction, that's what the hold produced; whereas

14

in this case he may well be serving additional time

15

because of the prior conviction, but he is not serving the

16

time of the prior conviction.

17
18

MR. O'MALLEY:

He

If I understand your question

correctly, Your Honor, that is our position.

19

QUESTION:

Isn't it also in the case in Maleng

20

that if the hold had not been placed, he would have been

21

released under the prior conviction?

22

MR. O'MALLEY:

That is correct, Your Honor, and

23

that is the factor that I think the Third Circuit

24

overlooked, and overlooks in its holdings on cases of this

25

type.

Right.
He's in custody under a 1990

conviction.
QUESTION:

Right, so the custody requirement of

section 2244 is satisfied?
MR. O'MALLEY:

Well, he wasn't attacking his

12

1990 conviction.

13

There's nothing wrong with his 1990 conviction.

14

thing wrong --

15

He was attacking his 1984 conviction.

QUESTION:

The only

Well, if you're right on the merits,

16

that's true, but if he's right, the thing that's wrong

17

with it is that the length of the sentence was based on a

18

prior unconstitutional -- a violation of the Federal

19

Constitution.

20

MR. O'MALLEY:

21

QUESTION:

22
23
24
25

That is --

If he's right.

I don't know whether

he is or not.
MR. O'MALLEY:

would be a correct statement.
But the Court in Custis v. The United States

1

adopted a line of reasoning which, while it may not

2

directly apply to Federal habeas cases, Custis having been

3

a case under the sentence -- the Federal Sentencing Act,

4

the rationale of those cases clearly seems to announce a

5

constitutional declaration that, in considering prior

6

convictions and sentences, the only constitutional

7

violation that the court will consider, the courts should

8

consider, are Gideon violations, where counsel was totally

9

absent, and that ineffective assistance of counsel cases

10

do not fall under that umbrella and, therefore, are not to

11

be considered as supplying a basis for Federal habeas

12

attacks on subsequent convictions and sentence, enhanced

13

by a sentence in which there may have been ineffective

14

assistance of counsel.

15

QUESTION:

Would you say that that rationale

16

would have -- also would apply even if the Pennsylvania

17

court had acted within the time period and set aside the

18

earlier conviction?

19

MR. O'MALLEY:

If the Pennsylvania court had

20

acted within the time period and set aside the earlier

21

conviction, we wouldn't have the problem, Your Honor, as I

22

see it.

23

QUESTION:

Why not?

I think your rationale

24

would be, we shouldn't look at that, regardless of whether

25

there's merit to the earlier case or not.

1

Would you agree, then, that the Third Circuit

2

would have been correct in this case if, after Mr. Coss

3

had served his sentence, the Pennsylvania court, contrary

4

to what you say the Pennsylvania law is, had decided,

5

well, we will take a look at the earlier conviction, and

6

we now conclude that he was not given effective assistance

7

of counsel?

8
9
10

Supposing they entered such an order, would that
mean that this -- that the result in this case would be
different?

11

MR. O'MALLEY:

I think that would mean the

12

result in this case would be different, because the only

13

basis for complaint that Coss had in this case dealt only

14

with the earlier conviction and sentence, not with his

15

19 --

16

QUESTION:

So then you're not saying that it's

17

only a Gideon violation that gives rise to a claim.

18

You're saying it's only an unresolved non-Gideon violation

19

that gives rise --

I think you -I don't know that I'm saying

that, Your Honor.

In -- I assume in

24

that hypothetical just posited there would have been no

25

basis for increasing the sentence.

You could attack the

second sentence on its face as being improper because

2

there was no prior conviction.

3

QUESTION:

4

No, no.

I'm assuming the second

sentence is entered before the Pennsylvania court rules.

5

QUESTION:

Oh, before the Pennsylvania court --

6

QUESTION:

The second sentence is entered, then

7

the Pennsylvania court rules that, oh, the first case is

8

invalid.

9

wouldn't it?

10

Would that mean the second case falls, or

MR. O'MALLEY:

I think it would certainly take a

11

great deal of the weight out of the second case, because

12

it would --

13

QUESTION:

But your basic position is, only

14

Gideon violations count.

15

argument to be, and I'm suggesting we have a non-Gideon

16

violation that set aside the second -- set aside the first

17

conviction after the second sentence was imposed.

18

you count it or not?

19

That's what I understood your

Would

It's not a Gideon violation.

MR. O'MALLEY:

I think we would count it, but I

20

think that count would come only on the basis of comity,

on the basis of the Federal court giving due recognition

22

to what Pennsylvania had done with its own --

23

QUESTION:

sentences, are they not, that we're talking about here?

QUESTION:

If the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had

2

set aside the first sentence, surely the Pennsylvania

3

courts would recognize the fact that it was no longer

valid.

5

MR. O'MALLEY:

6

QUESTION:

7

You don't have to get to any Federal

habeas there.

8
9

That is correct, Your Honor.

MR. O'MALLEY:

That's my -- that's why I'm

having trouble with the question, because you really don't

have to get to Federal habeas there.

I think the basis

11

for Federal habeas would evaporate in that situation.

QUESTION:

Well, what if the --

13

QUESTION:

Well, I don't know why you -- my

hypothetical is just the opposite.

is that they set aside the first sentence, but they didn't

set aside the second one.

17

long ago.

18

MR. O'MALLEY:

I -- my hypothetical

We had a case like that not

Well, I think the answer to that

19

hypothetical, then, Your Honor, would depend upon the

20

extent to which the second sentence was actually enhanced

21

by the first sentence.

22

QUESTION:

Well, I'm assuming it was.

It was

23

enhanced an extra year because of the prior conviction.

24

25

it decides, well, we think he really did it anyway, so

1

we're going to leave the second sentence in place.

2

MR. O'MALLEY:

3

QUESTION:

4

Well, we do not --

Would there be grounds for Federal

habeas relief?

5

MR. O'MALLEY:

We do not have that basis in this

6

case because the courts have recognized that in the second

7

sentencing the first conviction and sentence were

8

considered, but there's no way to quantify the extent to

9

which, if any, enhancement actually took place.

10

QUESTION:

But you have to deal with his

11

hypothetical, and don't you have to acknowledge at least a

12

second exception besides utter absence of counsel, and the

13

second sentence being that, in fact, the prior conviction

14

has, by the jurisdiction that imposed it, been held to be

15

invalid?

16

MR. O'MALLEY:

Yes.

If the second sentence was

17

held invalid by the jurisdiction which imposed it, we have

18

the question of comity, which I think would oblige the

19

Federal courts to give the appropriate deference to that

20

one situation.

21

QUESTION:

Well, let's go one step further and

22

ask, what happens if the defendant has done everything he

23

can to get a resolution on the validity of the first

24

conviction and, through no fault of the defendant's, the

25

State refuses to deal with the question, and nonetheless,

1

in the second proceeding, reliance is placed on the first

2

conviction that the defendant has tried to challenge but

3

couldn't?

4

That comes closer to this case, doesn't it?
MR. O'MALLEY:

It comes closer to this case,

5

Your Honor, and I would say that in that situation the

6

only basis for Federal relief that the defendant would

7

have would be a Gideon violation, utilizing the rationale

8

that was expressed by this Court in Custis v. The United

9

States, and that Gideon violations, the court has drawn

10
11

the line -QUESTION:

Well, Custis acknowledged that a

12

Gideon violation still was open, but did it necessarily

13

conclude that there is no other exception?

asks us to extend the rule to cases other than Gideon

the defendant can be deprived by the State of any chance

QUESTION:

But you know, in Custis, one of the

things, one of the values that the Court was basing its

8

MR. O'MALLEY:

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And you are now saying that that same

10

value, and hence the same comity concern, would be

11

implicated when a State in effect says, we are going to

stonewall a constitutional claim, even though that claim

is brought within a time period that our law specifies for

it, and you're saying the result should be the same.

that Custis respected?

MR. O'MALLEY:

If we had a situation where the

we would have an entirely different --

So that the only distinction between

that case and this case is that the State was simply

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. RUSSEL

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. RUSSEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

We believe that this case is controlled by the

12

constitutional principle announced by this Court in

13

Custis.

14

defendant's sentence with prior convictions that were

15

themselves infected with constitutional error and, because

16

that's so, a prisoner may not bring a habeas corpus attack

17

under 2254 on his current sentence and hope to reopen the

18

validity of his prior convictions except when the prior

19

convictions are obtained in violation of Gideon.

20

Custis found that it is permissible to enhance a

QUESTION:

Mr. Russel, there was a factor in

21

Custis itself that the forum that rendered judgment that

22

was considered defective was still open, and it seemed to

23

me an example of the ordinary rule that you go back where

24

the judgment was rendered if that door is still open.

25

MR. RUSSEL:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

I believe

1

that Custis does express the preference for the forum,

2

which is to say that all these constitutional attacks need

3

to be made in the rendering State or in the habeas corpus

4

petition that follows, while the defendant is in custody,

5

so while Custis, in that particular case the Court

6

recognized that a habeas corpus avenue was available, that

7

observation was premised on the underlying observation

8

that he was still in custody and could go back to his home

9

State and attack his convictions there.

10

Otherwise, once the convictions are final and

11

the defendant is not in custody, then the only violation

12

that the defendant can raise in a complaint about his

13

prior conviction is that the prior conviction was obtained

14

in violation of Gideon.

15

QUESTION:

Well --

But in this case, the person in

custody is in the position where he simply can't get State

collateral review.

19

all respects similar to this petitioner, with the one

20

difference that a week before his custody in the State for

21

the first sentence, a week before the custody expired, the

22

State Supreme Court said, oh, you're right, there's a

23

constitutional violation.

2

on the issue.

3

MR. RUSSEL:

I have two observations for you,

4

Justice Kennedy.

First, we believe that the petitioner in

5

this case could actually have obtained relief, review of

6

his earlier case while he was in custody.

7

Now, admittedly the State courts do not -- under

8

the Alhorn case we -- the cite -- the question, the answer

9

to Justice O'Connor's question was, the -- in our brief,

10

the green brief, at page 3 on footnote 3 there's the case

11

of Pennsylvania v. Alhorn, and that's the authority for

12

the proposition that once the petitioner is released from

13

custody in Pennsylvania, he cannot bring a PCR attack on

14

his sentence.

The -- I think what it amounts to is that

custody would have allowed him to file a habeas corpus

2

3

would have had an excellent argument, under futility, that

he wouldn't be able to exhaust his State remedies and

could have achieved a Federal review of his Strickland

claim back in the rendering State.

7

Now, at this --

QUESTION:

9

Oh, you mean you could file a Federal

habeas corpus action saying, you know, my custody is about

10

to expire, the State court is a little slow, it's just

MR. RUSSEL:

If he had filed, Your Honor, his

petition while he was in custody in Federal court, then

10

under this Court's mootness analysis of Karafas v.

11

LaVallee and Cibron v. New York, the case would not be

12

moot, and the Court would have jurisdiction to consider

13

the merits of the petition, even though he had been

14

released from custody, precisely because this Court is

15

concerned about the future possibility of collateral

16

consequences.

17

QUESTION:

What is the Pennsylvania law?

Leave

18

all this Federal law out of it.

Pennsylvania has some

19

kind of a guideline system, and so if you come into a

MR. RUSSEL:

I believe, Your Honor, that under

3

Pennsylvania law the judge says, we won't even listen.

4

think that's the way it works in Pennsylvania, and so our

5

rule definitely, while calling for application of the

6

Custis principle, we certainly think that this may exclude

7

some defendants from achieving relief in State court

8

first, but we think that the line drawn in Custis is a

9

fair and equitable balancing of the competing concerns

10

between fairness and finality, and it's certainly a rule

11

that can be applied uniformly throughout the States.

I

12

I would like to point out that in substance our

13

position tracks very closely to the argument advanced by

14

the United States last month in the Daniels case and,

15

while we think the Government's right there, we believe

16

that this case presents even stronger reasons for

17

application of the Custis principle.

18

One chief difference is that, whereas in Daniels

19

this case came to us through an application of a mandatory

20

sentence enhancement scheme, this involved the

21

discretionary use of a prior conviction by a sentencing

22

court, and that's something that happens much more often.

23

It happens in every sentencing court in the country every

24

single day, and so to the extent the Custis majority was

motivated by concerns about finality, and of the burden of

concern, those concerns are implicated to a far greater

degree here.

It would simply be unworkable if we had to go

investigate Strickland claims about trials that took place

in a different State many years ago every time a prior

7

conviction was used in a discretionary proceeding.

QUESTION:

We

Why wouldn't that be taken care of if

10

you had a requirement you have to show cause in prejudice

for not knocking it out earlier?

petitioner had to present it at the earliest opportunity,

14

then you wouldn't have the problem of people coming in 20

years later when they could have come in 2 years later, so

trying to raise the validity of their prior convictions

MR. RUSSEL:

And the burden of that litigation

would just add to the same litigation problems we're going

to have.

18

A second difference between our case and the

19

Daniels case is that there's a federalism component here

20

that was not present in Daniels.

21

for the Federal system to say to the States, we will not

22

use your convictions for our sentencing purposes, but it's

quite a different thing for the Federal system to say, you

the Daniels argument, some members of the Court at least

2

entertained the possibility that the text of 2255 -- 2255

3

may allow for collateral attacks on grounds that are

4

themselves not mandated by the Constitution, and to the

5

extent that's a possibility, we think that's a difference

6

in our case as well, because this Court repeatedly has

7

stated that 2254 exists solely to remedy the errors of

8

constitutional dimension.

9

In short, we believe that this application of

10

the Custis rule would be totally proper here because it is

a workable rule, and that the respondent's position, in

contrast, is totally unworkable.

looked at this case, following this Court's decision in

20

Maleng, we expected to see the habeas corpus litigation

21

follow a particular pattern, which was that the defendant

22

would exhaust his state remedies and then he would bring a

habeas petition, styled as an attack on the new

conviction, complaining about the use of the old

Breyer's hypothetical, what if the State says that this

16

conviction has been set aside, but one of our guidelines

17

says, we can take into consideration prior acts, prior

18

similar acts, and we now say that this conviction

19

represented prior acts whether or not you were convicted?

20

Is there anything wrong with that?

QUESTION:

The State says, here, we have a

2

witness, and the same witness who came forth at the trial

3

says, yes, he did slug this guy and slugged him five

4

times, and the defendant is allowed to contest that in the

sentencing proceeding, but the judge says, well, I find as

a fact that you did slug the guy, and so I'm taking that

into consideration in sentencing.

MR. WADE:

Is there anything wrong

I don't think there's anything wrong

with that, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Now, here, as I understand it, the

12

defendant had an opportunity to appeal from the 1986

13

conviction and sentence, and did not do so, as far as this

14

record discloses.

15

MR. WADE:

That's correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Well, why isn't that the end of the

matter, then?
MR. WADE:

Well, normally, ineffectiveness

and you would normally bring ineffectiveness claims in

MR. WADE:

magnitude, inaccurate information, based on the cases of

Tucker, Burke, Townsend v. Burke, Burgitt, in sentencing

QUESTION:

Those were all failure to appoint

correct, but they also have been read to include a broader

principle of --

the Court?
MR. WADE:

The majority opinions seem to hold

But if we're going to have a due process

principle, a fairness principle at sentencing, that

interest has to come down to reliability through

fundamental fairness.

MR. WADE:

He has had a string of convictions,

Your Honor, I mean, if you refer to his juvenile record

forward.

14

This is a limited right.

We're not asking for a

15

broad principle.

QUESTION:

Well, if that's what's driving this,

I mean, you think the best remedy is to simply open up all

10

of these convictions to subsequent Federal habeas corpus?

11

Why not just -- if this is the horrible event that we're

12

trying to avoid, why not just adopt a constitutional rule

13

that it is not proper for a State to foreclose habeas

14

corpus relief.

15

You say that's the only practical way to

16

challenge ineffective assistance.

It's just not

17

constitutional for a State that forecloses habeas corpus

18

relief to use it in subsequent sentence enhancement.

would be a lot easier than --

MR. WADE:

It may be easier, but I don't believe

the Constitution requires the States to have a

post-conviction process at all, so from that standpoint I

don't see how we could --

MR. WADE:

I'm -- yes, under the --

QUESTION:

Okay.

So just say, the State

sentence is simply unconstitutional, you cannot use that

6

prior conviction when there's been no ability to challenge

it in habeas?

8

Federal habeas corpus.

9

I'd much rather do that than muck up

MR. WADE:

I see that we're not mucking up

10

Federal habeas corpus, that the way that we're applying

11

the same rules in Federal habeas corpus to sentence

12

enhancement-type cases, and we're used to applying those

13

rules, it is -- and those rules protect State interests,

14

such as exhaustion, procedural default, and burden of

proof.

be on the petitioner.
QUESTION:

Yes, but it requires Federal courts

to look into the matter.

The rule that I propose would

require the States to do the job themselves.

MR. WADE:

QUESTION:

It would be a much more efficient way

to handle it, it seems to me.

problems of, that the State that's involved with the

process is not there, but I think that's -- the problem

with that is solved by limiting the remedy to the

Pennsylvania, then it applies just to that sentencing.

I've never seen a case --

would have to make some kind of finding, like a -- in

Grayson, where they said, I heard you testify on the

witness stand and you testified falsely, I'm going to

enhance your sentence by 5 years because of that

testimony.

I could answer that, you know, the question the way I did,

yes.

In summary, we seek a limited and narrow rule.

15

We seek a rule that will require the petitioner, or Mr.

16

Coss, to exhaust his State claims, to meet his burden of

17

proof, and when you have a case where he's met his burden

18

of proof, has shown that his counsel was ineffective, and

19

has shown that the subsequent sentence was enhanced or at

20

least influenced by the prior improper conviction, that

21

this Court should not base the sentence on that, they

22

should not let a sentence be founded on an unreliable

23

foundation, and that the judgment of the court of appeals

24

should be affirmed.
