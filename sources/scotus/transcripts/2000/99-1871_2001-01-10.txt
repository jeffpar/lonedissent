CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Bureau of Indian Affairs v. Klamath, the Klamath Water

Users Protective Association.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11
12

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case involves the application of exemption

13

5 of the Freedom of Information Act to seven documents

14

that pertain to the Federal Government's exercise of its

15

responsibility to act as trustee for the property and

16

natural resources of Indian tribes.

17

documents were submitted by the Klamath tribes to the

18

Department of the Interior at the Government's request.

19

The seventh document was prepared by a DOI official and

20

was provided to attorneys for the Klamath and --

Six of the seven

21

QUESTION:

By DOI, Department of the Interior?

22

MR. STEWART:

23

The documents relate to the United States'

24

representation of the tribes' interests in a pending

25

Oregon stream adjudication as well as to the Bureau of

That's correct.

3

1

Reclamation's management of the Klamath reclamation

2

project during the period while that adjudication remains

3

pending.

4
5

QUESTION:

Mr. Stewart, there was some long-

term plan for this water basin that was being considered?

6

MR. STEWART:

At the time that the documents

7

submitted, the Department of Interior or Bureau of

8

Reclamation more specifically was attempting to prepare a

9

long-term operations plan for the Klamath project.

10

QUESTION:

Has that been abandoned?

11

MR. STEWART:

It has not been abandoned.

The

12

long -- no draft long-term plan has yet been issued, but

13

the --

14

QUESTION:

Is it still under preparation?

15

MR. STEWART:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. STEWART:

It is still under preparation.

Is it ongoing?
It is still ongoing on a year-by-

18

year basis the Bureau of Reclamation, or BOR, manages the

19

Klamath project based on water availability during the

20

course of that year.

21

The idea behind the long-term operations plan,

22

sometimes known as the Klamath project operations plan, or

23

KPOP colloquially, was to devise a methodology whereby the

24

Department would decide in advance how water would be

25

distributed in both wet and dry years, where current
4

1

practice has been at the beginning of the season to assess

2

the likely availability of water and make a determination

3

for that year.

4

The preparation of KPOP in a sense interacts

5

with the United States' representation of the tribes in

6

the Oregon general stream adjudication, because it's the

7

State of Oregon that will be making the final permanent

8

determination as to who has what water rights and in what

9

order of priority and, in connection with that

10

adjudication, the United States has filed claims on behalf

11

of the tribes, on behalf of the project, as well as on

12

behalf of other Federal interests.

13

QUESTION:

So in the Oregon litigation I take it

14

that the United States is really acting as counsel for the

15

tribes?

16

MR. STEWART:

We are not technically acting as

17

their attorney.

18

attorneys, but the United States acts as trustee.

19

filed claims in the Oregon adjudication --

20

That is, the tribes have their own

QUESTION:

It has

Well, are the claims that the tribes'

21

lawyers are supporting the claims that the United States

22

filed, or are they separate claims?

23

MR. STEWART:

The United States has filed claims

24

on behalf of the tribes.

With regard to virtually the

25

entirety of the United States submission the tribes have
5

1

filed a document that simply says, we accept and

2

incorporate by reference the claims of the United States.

3

QUESTION:

So --

4

MR. STEWART:

With respect to a small fraction

5

of the case the tribes have filed their own claim that

6

differs marginally from that of the United States on their

7

behalf, but I think there is nearly a 100-percent

8

alignment of interests in the Oregon --

9

QUESTION:

So your interests -- with that minor

10

exception, your interests are identical.

11

technically, is separate?

Counsel,

12

MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

13

QUESTION:

Okay.

14

QUESTION:

But isn't it true the United States

15

has an interest other than just representing the tribes'

16

interest?

17

MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

The United States

18

has also filed claims on behalf of the project and on

19

behalf of other Federal interests.

20

a wildlife refuge in the area for which the United

21

States --

22

QUESTION:

For instance, there is

If there were a separation of

23

responsibility within the United States presentations and

24

if these documents had been given to the right hand rather

25

than the left hand of the United States, would you still
6

1
2

say they were privileged?
MR. STEWART:

I think we would certainly say

3

that to the extent the submission were submitted -- to the

4

extent the documents were submitted to the United States

5

in its capacity as trustee, that is, with regard to the

6

preparation of the United States' claims on the tribes'

7

behalf, they would be privileged and confidential.

8
9
10
11

QUESTION:

But wasn't there some effort at the

time the FOIA was drafted or amended to put in an
exemption for a trustee which Congress turned down?
MR. STEWART:

In 1976 there was a legislative

12

proposal that would have created a new FOIA exemption for

13

all documents in the possession of a Government agency

14

pertaining to the exercise of trust responsibilities, and

15

that bill was never acted on.

16

That bill would have accomplished an exemption

17

from the FOIA that is significantly broader than the

18

exemption we're asking for here.

19

applicability of that exemption would not have turned on

20

whether the documents came from the tribes initially and,

21

perhaps more important, it wouldn't have turned on whether

22

particular documents would be privileged from discovery in

23

civil litigation.

24
25

That is, the

That is, the focus of the court of appeals'
concern -- perhaps I should turn to page 2 of our brief,
7

1

which sets forth the language of exemption 5 of the

2

Freedom of Information Act.

3

requirement of compelled disclosure does not apply to

4

matters that are, quote, interagency or intraagency

5

memorandums or letters which would not be available by law

6

to a party other than an agency in litigation with the

7

agency, and --

8
9

QUESTION:

Exemption 5 states that the

Certainly what you have here does not

literally fill that bill, does it?

10

MR. STEWART:

It certainly doesn't fit within

11

the most common conception of what an interagency or

12

intraagency memorandum would be.

13

have, over the past 30 years, devised a methodology for

14

determining when documents that were created by persons

15

outside the Government may nevertheless be regarded as

16

sufficiently internal from a pragmatic point of view that

17

they can qualify for the exemption.

18

QUESTION:

The courts of appeals

Why would they go about that

19

business -- why wouldn't they simply read what the statute

20

says?

21

MR. STEWART:

I think because they have come to

22

the conclusion that some documents submitted by outside

23

persons play a role in the agency's deliberations that is

24

so similar to the role that a staff memorandum would play.

25

QUESTION:

Did they call it a consultative
8

1
2

privilege?
MR. STEWART:

They haven't referred to it as a

3

consultative privilege, but they have certainly said that

4

they have used outside consultants as an example of --

5
6
7

QUESTION:

People that the agency hires to do

work that the agency would otherwise do?
MR. STEWART:

There are really two different

8

categories of cases in the courts of appeals, and one is

9

as you suggest.

That is, there are situations in which a

10

person is consulted because he has preexisting expertise

11

but no particular institutional perspective on the matter

12

at issue, and there I think it is fair to say that the

13

basis for the arrangement is that this person is serving

14

in effect as a temporary employee, performing the role an

15

employee would perform.

16

QUESTION:

There are other cases in the --

Well, you don't assert that all

17

tribal communications with the Federal Government

18

concerning tribal resources are always exempt from

19

disclosure under FOIA, do you?

20

MR. STEWART:

No.

We would say that the

21

document needs to be submitted to the Government in its

22

capacity as trustee.

23

Wildlife Service is making a determination as to whether a

24

particular species should be listed as threatened or

25

endangered under the Endangered Species Act it's possible

So, for example, if the Fish &

9

1

that the outcome of that listing decision might have a

2

practical effect on the way in which tribal land can be

3

used.

4

QUESTION:

5

get that out of the statute?

6

You say as a trustee.

MR. STEWART:

Where do you

Oh, the statute refers to

7

interagency or intraagency memorandums and the courts of

8

appeals, in determining what can be properly regarded as

9

internal, have focused on the existence of a special

10

relationship between the outside person and the government

11

official, and in many instances the outside person, as I

12

say, is one who fulfills the role of an agency employee.

13

QUESTION:

But that --

14

QUESTION:

But the tribe is not an agency.

15

MR. STEWART:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. STEWART:

18

natural reading of that language.

19

sense in which these submissions are properly

20

characterized as interagency, and that is when the Federal

21

Government actively solicits advice and assistance, when

22

it identifies the person from whom advice is sought, when

23

it constructs the decision -- when it constructs the

24

consultative process in a way that is reasonably designed

25

to further the Government's own interests, the resulting

The tribe is not an agency.

So it's literally not covered.
It is not covered under the most

10

I think there is a

1

document can be said to be internal in the sense that the

2

circle begins and ends with the Government.

3

QUESTION:

Well, okay, but --

4

QUESTION:

It isn't a matter of being -- it

5

seems to me all of -- almost all of the courts of appeals

6

cases you're referring to do deal with consultants who

7

have been hired by the Government to further the

8

Government's own interests.

9

Government's operating.

10

This is really part of the

The tribe here was not seeking to further the

11

Government's interests at all.

12

its own interests.

13

most of these courts of appeals cases -- which I agreed

14

with.

15

this seems to take it a step further, and I can see how

16

you can get to the conclusion that a consultant who you

17

hire, any memorandum produced by that consultant who was

18

hired is an intraagency memorandum.

19

It was seeking to further

I think it's a stretch beyond what

I mean, I've spoken to that in an earlier case, but

I do not see how you can leap to the conclusion

20

that anything that is given to you by a trustee, by a

21

trust, is an intraagency memorandum.

22

should be confidential, but I find it hard to call that an

23

intraagency memorandum.

24
25

MR. STEWART:

I mean, maybe it

Well, with respect to the existing

court of appeals case law, certainly the consultant
11

1

temporary employee is the paradigmatic example, but the

2

D.C. Circuit has also applied this approach in cases such

3

as Ryan and Public Citizen to Members of the Senate, to a

4

former President who was advising the archivist regarding

5

the proper disposition of records created during his term

6

of office, where the idea was not that the person outside

7

the Government was stepping into the shoes of an agency

8

employee, or adopting an employee's perspective.

9

QUESTION:

No, but it was surely -- I mean, the

10

Senate didn't have its own ax to grind when it was giving

11

the Justice Department information about judicial

12

nominees.

13

Government's interest, not its own interest.

14

It was certainly trying to further the

MR. STEWART:

But it was consulted precisely

15

because it would have a distinct perspective on the proper

16

manner of accomplishing the Government's objectives, and

17

that's really --

18

QUESTION:

In that view, if the Klamath Water

19

Users' Association had submitted these documents, would

20

they also be privileged from disclosure?

21
22
23

MR. STEWART:

No, because the United States does

not act as a trustee for the Water Users Association.
QUESTION:

So then it's not the deliberative

24

process privilege that we're talking about at all.

25

simply this trust relationship.
12

It's

1
2

MR. STEWART:

I think the trust relationship is

the thing that brings this case within a larger principle.

3

QUESTION:

No, but --

4

QUESTION:

And yet you concede that the trust

5

relationship in itself doesn't create any exemption under

6

FOIA, and Mr. Stewart, this is the problem that I have

7

with the picture here.

8

it.

9

behalf of the water association, too.

It's the one-way-street aspect of

I mean, you said the United States has made claims on

10

MR. STEWART:

It has not made claims on behalf

11

of the water association.

12

the project, but the association and --

13

QUESTION:

It has made claims on behalf of

Where they have the same interest,

14

where there's an identity of interest between -- the

15

United States might agree with the users on some of the

16

questions, is that not so?

17
18

MR. STEWART:

There are certainly aspects of the

case on which we and the users are in agreement.

19

QUESTION:

What -- but, and the users and the

20

tribes are in, at least in tension on some of these

21

issues.

22

One of the statements made is that the United

23

States has been routinely turning over what it gets from

24

the water association to the tribes, so the information --

25

the tribes get information from one side that has a stake
13

1

in this venture, but that side doesn't get what the tribe

2

is giving to the Government, so it looks like it's not

3

evenhanded.

4

MR. STEWART:

I think to understand why, in our

5

view, it is evenhanded, it's essential to explain that

6

there are several component agencies within the Department

7

of Interior, but two that are particularly important here,

8

the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of

9

Reclamation.

10

Now, both the tribes and the water users

11

corresponded with the Bureau of Reclamation, or BOR, and

12

BOR received a FOIA request from both the tribes and the

13

users association asking for the documents that the others

14

had submitted, and for better or worse BOR turned

15

everything over.

16

divulging both tribal communications and the water users

17

association communications.

18

theory BOR should not have been quite so forthcoming, but

19

it was.

20

BOR was absolutely evenhanded in

It may be that under our

There was no disuniformity with respect to BOR.
BIA was a different story.

BIA is set up with

21

the special responsibility of exercising the Government's

22

trust responsibilities to the Indian tribes.

23

essentially corresponds with the Indian tribes, and it

24

would be unusual for the water users to correspond with

25

BIA at all.

It

BIA was the subagency within the Department
14

1

of the Interior that refused to disclose some of these

2

documents, with one exception of the seven.

3

adjudication-related documents was addressed to the

4

Regional Solicitor of the Department of the Interior.

5

One of the

So primarily we are concerned with documents

6

that were submitted to a subagency within DOI whose

7

particular sphere of duty and expertise is the exercise of

8

trust responsibilities for the tribes, and this Court in

9

Nevada v. United States emphasized the BIA's unique

10
11

mission, its separate juridical status -QUESTION:

No, but isn't the value of that

12

emphasis, if it has any value at all, only proportional to

13

the independence of BIA from the rest of the Department of

14

Interior, because I think the questions of several of my

15

colleagues here have raised the same point.

16

not independent of them, then your analogy between the

17

tribes and the consultants fails.

18

consultant situation as being inter- or intraagency, we

19

can rationalize it by saying, as several have said, that

20

the consultants really are doing something that the

21

Department itself might be doing.

22

the Department.

If the BIA is

If we accept the

It's an extension of

It's reportable only to the Department.

23

But if, in fact, the Indian tribes are

24

consulting with an agency which is concerned not only with

25

the Indian tribes' interests, but in adjusting those
15

1

interests as against the interests of other claimants,

2

which seems to be the case here, then you don't have an

3

analogy with a situation in which the Department and the

4

consultant alone are involved, so it seems to me your

5

whole argument either stands or falls on the independence

6

of BIA, and we know that the BIA is not somehow totally

7

independent of the rest of the Department of the Interior,

8

whether it's preparing a KPOP or whether it's representing

9

the United States in Oregon litigation.

10

MR. STEWART:

I mean, I guess I have two or

11

three responses to that.

12

BIA is not an independent agency.

13

DOI, and therefore is ultimately subject to DOI control.

14

At the same time, the Government is attempting to deal in

15

a pragmatic fashion with the sort of combination of

16

responsibilities that no private party would ever be

17

given.

18

First, you're correct that the
It is a subagency of

That is, things would certainly be cleaner from

19

our point of view of DOI could either say, we will treat

20

the tribes exactly like we treat everyone else, or it

21

could say, we will treat the tribes exactly as a private

22

trustee would treat the beneficiary, namely, show it a

23

duty of undivided loyalty.

24
25

It's clear, I think from first principles and
from this Court's decision in Nevada v. United States,
16

1

that the Department can't pursue either of those courses.

2

It must on the one hand fulfill its trust responsibilities

3

but on the other hand it has other responsibilities that

4

would be considered conflicting if they were imposed on a

5

private person, so giving BIA primary responsibility for

6

the carrying out of the Department's trust mission is a

7

pragmatic response to an admittedly messy situation.

8

The other thing I would say is, we don't contend

9

that the tribes are analogous to a consultant in the sense

10

of stepping into the shoes of an agency employee or doing

11

what an agency employee would otherwise do.

12

contrary, we think the input from the tribes is essential

13

if the Department is to carry out its trust

14

responsibilities, but that's precisely because the tribes

15

have an expertise and a perspective that no agency

16

employee would have.

17

QUESTION:

To the

Well, that's true, but I mean the

18

problem comes because the Department has responsibilities

19

to other people, too and it is -- in effect, on your view

20

of the Freedom of Information Act, it is able to favor one

21

side with information while denying an equal, in effect an

22

equal access to another side, and --

23

MR. STEWART:

24

QUESTION:

25

Well, certainly --

-- that's the real rub in deciding

whether we should stretch the Freedom of Information Act
17

1

language broadly enough to in effect allow the United

2

States to grant privileges to one of the interest groups

3

it's supposed to favor, the Indians, as against the other

4

interest groups, water users, the general public, what-

5

not, and that's a great stretch.

6

MR. STEWART:

Well, again I would say, for

7

better or for worse, the BOR did not favor the tribes vis-

8

a-vis the water users.

9

FOIA requests.

10

It was equally responsive to both

The only --

QUESTION:

But I think your position here today

11

is, it didn't have to be, that it could claim an exemption

12

with respect to whatever it gets from the tribes.

13

MR. STEWART:

Not whatever it gets from the

14

tribes, but whatever the tribes submit to it in its

15

capacity as trustee, so yes, our position would be, if the

16

tribes approach BOR and say, in order to fulfill the

17

United States' duties as trustee, the BOR must take the

18

following management steps.

19

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Stewart, your argument

20

would be very convincing if Congress had enacted that

21

trustee thing, but it didn't.

22

MR. STEWART:

I mean, I think it's -- obviously,

23

one of the arguments advanced in favor of the legislation

24

that was proposed in 1976 was that the legislation would

25

clarify the ambiguity, would make it unnecessary to
18

1

resolve difficult questions concerning the application of

2

existing FOIA exemptions, but I think the Court has long

3

taken the position that the FOIA should be implemented in

4

a practical way, that it should be implemented in a way

5

that doesn't interfere with the Government's performance

6

of its substantive --

7

QUESTION:

But also that the exemption should be

8

narrowly construed.

9

the main rule is, disclose unless you fit into one of

The Court has said that repeatedly.

10

these exemptions, and the exemptions are to be tightly

11

construed.

12

MR. STEWART:

I mean, certainly, if we are able

13

to persuade the Court that the threshold language is

14

satisfied here, that is that these documents are properly

15

regarded as interagency or intraagency memorandums or

16

letters, we would still have to persuade presumably the

17

court of appeals on remand that the documents would be

18

privileged --

19

QUESTION:

But the question is whether it fits

20

within -- the words for the exemption are interagency.

21

That's what has to be strictly construed.

22

MR. STEWART:

23

QUESTION:

And in the past --

Once you get past that, then there's

24

an issue that isn't even before us now whether these are

25

deliberative and whatever else.
19

1

MR. STEWART:

I mean, with respect, I think the

2

Court's general methodology has been to construe the

3

threshold language of the various exemptions in a way that

4

would protect the values that the body of the exemption is

5

intended to protect, and the Court has said, in a

6

shorthand formulation admittedly, that exemption 5

7

protects those documents, and only those documents that

8

would be privileged in civil discovery.

9

I mean, the point is, most of the work here is

10

supposed to be done by the inquiry into whether there is

11

actually an applicable privilege.

12

threshold language will screen out some things that would

13

be privileged in discovery, but there's no indication,

14

either in the legislative history or in this Court's

15

decisions, that the threshold language is supposed to

16

screen out a lot.

It maybe that the

17

To take another example --

18

QUESTION:

No, but we can't construe the

19

exemption as if it were an exemption only for privileged

20

material, because we've got inter- or intraagency language

21

that has somehow got to be satisfied before we get to the

22

question of privilege.

23

MR. STEWART:

But I think it's also worth

24

emphasizing that the one alternative that I think is not

25

clearly on the table is to give the threshold language an
20

1

absolutely rigid literal interpretation.

2

nothing can be --

3

QUESTION:

That is to say,

Okay, and we've been assuming in our

4

arguments, at least for the sake of argument, that we

5

wouldn't be so literal as to exclude the relationship

6

between the consultant and the agency, but the analogy

7

between the consultant and the agency fails here because

8

the agency here is in fact wearing more than one hat.

9

It's in the role of an advocate, or the role of an

10

adjudicator, vis-a-vis the tribe, so that analogy doesn't

11

work, and it seems to me the only way you can win is to

12

say, well, come up with anew exception, or a new

13

interpretation of inter- or intraagency, and I haven't

14

heard what that is yet.

15
16

If we don't accept the analogy with the
consultant --

17

MR. STEWART:

18

QUESTION:

I mean, I think the --

-- and we don't have another model

19

for a construction or an exception, then I think you're --

20

then I think you have to lose.

21

MR. STEWART:

I mean, I think the best analogy

22

from the existing case law is to the Senators in Ryan and

23

to the former President in Public Citizen.

24

are people who were not literally part of any FOIA agency,

25

and who were consulted not because they were expected to
21

That is, these

1

perform exactly the same role as an agency employee.

2

Rather, they were consulted because they were believed to

3

have a distinct institutional perspective.

4

QUESTION:

Okay, was the United States in that

5

case in a position of, formally or informally of

6

adjudicating the interests, say of the President vis-a-

7

vis somebody else?

8
9

MR. STEWART:

I mean, certainly the archivist

was ultimately going to be making the determination

10

whether particular documents would be made public or not,

11

and in other private individuals such as Public --

12

QUESTION:

But at the time the privilege was

13

recognized, or the exemption was recognized, was the

14

archivist in the situation of saying, well, I have the

15

President telling me to do one -- or whoever it was --

16

telling me to do one thing and a bunch of historians want

17

me to do something else, so I'll consult with the

18

President, and my consultation with him should be exempt.

19

Was that the situation?

20

MR. STEWART:

I don't know that it had

21

progressed to quite that point, but certainly the point of

22

the scheme was that private parties would like to have as

23

much information as possible from the former President's

24

records in order to do whatever type of research they

25

wanted to do, and the former President was being consulted
22

1
2
3
4

because of his own distinct perspective, and -QUESTION:

Well, maybe the exemption shouldn't

have been recognized in that situation, then.
MR. STEWART:

Well, I think the -- certainly

5

Congress over the years has revisited, has amended the

6

FOIA in various respects.

7

QUESTION:

It's not --

But you are asking for a stretch even

8

beyond that, because this -- the adversary nature of the

9

tribes' interests versus the water users' interests.

10

MR. STEWART:

I mean, I think we are not -- I

11

think we're not asking for a stretch, because the United

12

States in its capacity as trustee, and in particular the

13

Bureau of Indian Affairs, owes a duty of loyalty to the

14

tribes, and certainly Federal policy for most of the 20th

15

Century has been to exercise the trusteeship in a way that

16

will promote values of tribal self-determination, so if

17

the United States as trustee --

18

QUESTION:

What I mean is, that's a new element

19

that wasn't -- it's not like the paid consultant who's

20

substituting for an employee, it's not like the Senate

21

that's representing the U.S. Government, and it's not like

22

the President.

23

case is like.

24
25

You are asking for something that no other

MR. STEWART:

I would agree that the tribes'

potential financial interest in the income of the
23

1

decision, the various decisionmaking processes is unlike

2

interests that have been recognized in the past, but the

3

United States is supposed to act as the trustee.

4

the central duties of a trustee in virtually every context

5

is to preserve a duty of confidentiality to the

6

beneficiary, and so it would be strange to say that the

7

tribe's status as a beneficiary, the tribe's interest in

8

the trust corpus, is the very thing that causes its

9

submissions to lose the confidentiality that they might

10
11

otherwise have.
QUESTION:

It's not completely clear that that

12

confidentiality is also a defense to discovery in

13

litigation.

14

One of

MR. STEWART:

I mean, certainly in litigation

15

the particular needs of an individual requestor would be

16

relevant in a way that they would not be relevant under

17

the FOIA, so I think your question -- the premise of your

18

question is correct in two different respects.

19

First, the fact that these are in our view

20

interagency documents doesn't automatically mean that they

21

would even satisfy the second part of the FOIA test.

22

Second, even if they satisfied the second part of the FOIA

23

test in the sense that they would not be routinely

24

discoverable, that wouldn't by itself eliminate the

25

possibility that they could be discovered by a litigant
24

1

with a particular need.

2
3

If I may, I'd like to reserve the remainder of
my time.

QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Stewart.

5

Mr. Hitchings, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW M. HITCHINGS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

8
9
10

MR. HITCHINGS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
FOIA exemption 5 does not apply to

11

communications between the Government and outside

12

nonagency parties when the communications concern the

13

Government's allocation of a valuable right or benefit

14

among these nonagency parties.

15

due to the existence of a trustee-beneficiary relationship

16

between the Government and the nonagency party, a

17

relationship that itself does not give rise to a civil

18

discovery privilege.

19

This rule does not change

As we heard in the discussion preceding this,

20

this Court's decisions and Congress itself have

21

consistently recognized that the dominant purpose of FOIA

22

is disclosure, not secrecy, and that FOIA exemptions must

23

be narrowly construed.

24
25

QUESTION:

If an ordinary person has a

trustee -- in fact, any one of millions of Americans
25

1

indeed do have a trustee they have to give confidential --

2

they give confidential documents to, it would be

3

privileged in litigation, like attorney-client work

4

privilege.

5

documents, is there?

There's no way for adversaries to get those

MR. HITCHINGS:

In the context of civil

litigation there is not a recognized -QUESTION:

So if you're an Indian, however, a

member of an Indian tribe, you do exactly the same thing

10

because your Government happens to be the trustee,

11

opponents in litigation could get it, so the court

12

privileges would be useless to them.

13

they have to give documents to the trustees, all the court

14

privileges would be useless.

15

you'd lose, but I want to be sure that's the consequence.

I'm not saying that means

16

MR. HITCHINGS:

17

looked at within the context of --

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. HITCHINGS:

20

QUESTION:

I mean, insofar as

Well, the consequence should be

But that is the consequence.
The consequence, yes.

All right.

If that's the

21

consequence, then what I'm looking for is, it seems an

22

undesirable consequence, and therefore I wonder if their

23

status isn't unique enough to analogize them to

24

consultants.

25

That's basically -- I mean, it's like nothing
26

1

else.

2

and there's a choice of analogies, and I agree with you

3

that it's a stretch of the language, but consultants is a

4

stretch of the language, so shouldn't we try to see if

5

that can't be done in order to prevent the consequence

6

that I just described?

7

The Indian tribe relationship is totally

MR. HITCHINGS:

unique,

Well, I think when you are in a

8

situation, granted the Indian tribes are unique, and

9

they've been recognized that way throughout history, but

10

in the same instance, in Nevada v. U.S., this Court's

11

decision in that case did recognize the unique nature that

12

the Government has to deal with, competing interests

13

within water rights adjudications, and while the

14

relationship that the Government and Interior may have

15

with project water, irrigation water users may not

16

approach that of a trustee, certainly Nevada said that the

17

Government is obligated to undertake substantial

18

obligations on their behalf.

19

And when you're talking about the Government

20

making decisions regarding these competing interests, and

21

it's not just the interests of the irrigation interests

22

and of the tribes, it's also competing Federal interests

23

for other federally reserved water rights, one thing

24

that --

25

QUESTION:

It didn't seem to me that's what
27

1

would be relevant to the questions that I'm asking, or

2

necessarily to the holding of the case.

3

held they're not within the agency exception, they are not

4

within it, and therefore whatever documents they give to

5

the trustee, whether it happened to be your situation or

6

any other situation in the world, would be absolutely --

7

other people would get them.

8
9

That is, if we

The court privileges would be useless to the
Indians, and that would be not only true in your

10

situation, it would be true in every situation, if they

11

don't fall within this.

12

MR. HITCHINGS:

Now, that's what's worrying me.
Well, I think that one of the

13

potential off-ramps to that is that there may be other

14

FOIA exemptions that would apply in other cases.

15

purpose of FOIA exemption 5 our position is that it does

16

not where you have the Government allocating a valuable

17

privilege amongst competing nonagency parties.

18

QUESTION:

For the

Mr. Hitchings, I guess you believe

19

that the moral is you should never pick a trustee who

20

enacts a Freedom of Information Act.

21

(Laughter.)

22

MR. HITCHINGS:

23

moral of the story, but it's -- certainly the --

24
25

I don't know if that's quite the

QUESTION:
choice.

But I'm not sure the Indians had a

I mean, the Congress -28

1
2

QUESTION:

Alternative moral, if you are a

trustee you should not enact a Freedom of Information Act.

3

MR. HITCHINGS:

Well, I think one of the other

4

points regarding Your Honor's question was, what other

5

circumstances may apply.

6

is going to be the Government competing, or balancing, or

7

allocating amongst a n umber of competing interests, but

8

there certainly may be circumstances where Indian tribes

9

will communicate with BIA or Interior, and the Government

I think in many circumstances it

10

is not in this position where they actually are

11

balancing --

12

QUESTION:

Is there any way to work with that,

13

because I would normally think, you know, that people get

14

sued, and tribes get sued like any other entity for

15

millions of things, accidents, contracts, who knows?

16

mean, there are 30 million lawsuits, or I don't know, 10

17

million anyway, and in each of those lawsuits they would

18

be unable to use the privileges that are given to every

19

other litigant if they turned over documents, as they

20

normally would in the course of business, to their

21

trustee.

22

Now, is -- you say, well this is a special

I

23

situation as described.

Is there any way to work with

24

that that would make a difference?

25

MR. HITCHINGS:

I think the rule that I
29

1

articulated in the first sentence here is that FOIA

2

exemption 5 does not apply to communications between the

3

Government and outside nonagency parties when the

4

communications concern the Government's allocation of a

5

valuable benefit or privilege amongst those interested

6

nonagency parties.

7

QUESTION:

Don't the tribes generally, in

8

matters of contract or tort, refer to -- they have their

9

own attorneys, don't they?

10

MR. HITCHINGS:

They do, and they have their own

11

attorneys in this circumstance too, both in the Klamath

12

project operations plan as well as in the adjudication.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Hitchings, I think that

14

Mr. Stewart said that this case, if we got past

15

interagency, would be on the deliberative process.

16

is claiming in this case that the United States has an

17

attorney-client relationship that would bring forth a

18

privilege.

19

if we -- if exemption 5 applied at all, we would be

20

looking to the deliberative process privilege but not to

21

attorney-client or work product, is that right?

22

Nobody

I think that Mr. Stewart agreed with that, so

MR. HITCHINGS:

Well, in this case the

23

Government has asserted the deliberative process privilege

24

protects all seven documents that remain in dispute.

25

They have also asserted that the attorney work
30

1

product privilege protects two of those seven, and that's

2

an additional basis for withholding those documents within

3

the rubric of FOIA exemption 5, and those two documents

4

for which the attorney-client privilege was claimed -- I'm

5

sorry, the attorney work product privilege was claimed,

6

one of them specifically discusses the Klamath project

7

operations plan, one of them specifically discusses the

8

adjudication.

9

So there is somewhat of a mix in the privileges

10

that have been claimed here, but it is true that the

11

primary thrust of the Government's argument in this case

12

has been that all of the documents are protected by the

13

deliberative process privilege within FOIA exemption 5.

14

QUESTION:

If the Government cannot prevail

15

under section 5, are there as to these two documents as to

16

which work product was -- will the work product privilege

17

protect those independently of section 5?

18

MR. HITCHINGS:

Our position is that it does

19

not, and it's because they do not -- for the same reasons

20

that it does not work within the deliberative process

21

analysis it does not work within the attorney work product

22

analysis either.

23

defense or prosecution against a common adversary here.

24

The Government again, Interior itself has many obligations

25

and many competing interests.

They do not have a common goal, a common

31

1
2

QUESTION:

In fact, they may even be adverse to

each other in certain respects, I guess.

3

MR. HITCHINGS:

Correct and, in fact, as far as

4

the Klamath project operations plan, there are a number of

5

interests that the tribes are adverse to the Government

6

on, as well as adjudication, too, and the adjudication

7

contests were filed in May of this year, where the tribes

8

themselves have filed contests to claims filed on behalf

9

of the Fish & Wildlife Service for wildlife refuges up

10
11

there.

That's within the Department of Interior.
The same is the case for the Bureau of

12

Reclamation's claims that have been filed.

13

the case for the Klamath project operations claim.

14

tribes contest the manner in which the project is operated

15

if the Government is operating in a manner to benefit

16

project irrigation users, perhaps wildlife refuges,

17

whatever the other Federal interests may be in that case.

18

The same is
The

One of the points that was brought up by the

19

Solicitor General's argument was this alternative test of

20

what the role of the document might play, and our position

21

has been throughout this that that would pretty much bring

22

within the purview of FOIA exemption 5 any document that

23

is submitted to the Government.

24

If the Government was able to withhold a

25

document based upon its affidavit of the role that
32

1

document played within its discussion, that would include

2

just about anything, and it would provide the opportunity

3

for Federal agencies to cloak all types of discussions

4

based upon that type of assertion.

5

QUESTION:

Well, now I don't understand that. I

6

thought that in order to work, 5, you have to satisfy two

7

things.

8

interagency, and if you are there, it's still not

9

protected unless you can assert a privilege that you could

10
11
12
13

First, you don't even get there unless it's

assert in a litigation.
MR. HITCHINGS:

Am I wrong about that?
That's correct, there are those

two tests to that.
QUESTION:

All right, so in other words, the

14

only things that you -- the only -- if it applies, it only

15

creates privacy in respect to the following things, those

16

things that, independently, litigation privilege creates

17

privacy for.

18

Now, am I right about that, or not?

MR. HITCHINGS:

Correct.

You would need to

19

satisfy that threshold test of whether it is inter or

20

intraagency and then meet the secondary test, which is

21

whether it is normally privileged within the civil

22

discovery context.

23

QUESTION:

That's -- you see, that's why I'm

24

worried, because we're only talking about things that

25

would otherwise be privileged, and now they lose that
33

1

privilege.

2

why I'm worried to try to get from you something that will

3

make me less worried.

4

I'm just repeating myself, but I'm explaining

MR. HITCHINGS:

Well, I understand that, the

5

worry that is caused by that, but again, I think there may

6

be other circumstances where other FOIA exemptions may

7

apply.

8

exemption 4 could apply, because it's a commercial

9

privilege that is -- or involves commercial information,

It may be in other circumstances that FOIA

10

or financial information that is otherwise privileged and

11

confidential.

12

In fact, amici in support of the petitioner in

13

this case brought that very point up, so there may be

14

circumstances where the Government could assert other

15

privileges.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Medical records, are medical records

privileged under FOIA?
MR. HITCHINGS:

That would be within unwarranted

19

invasion of personal privacy, perhaps, or one of the other

20

exemptions --

21

QUESTION:

I think they're specifically

22

mentioned in that provision, medical records and other --

23

whose disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion

24

of privacy, but that provision letters that would not be

25

available, memorandums or letters that would not be
34

1

available by law to a party other than an agency in

2

litigation, that isn't -- that goes well beyond just

3

attorney-client material, doesn't it?

4

I mean, I thought that was a fairly expansive

5

provision, and if it were not routinely available in

6

litigation, it benefits from that.

7

MR. HITCHINGS:

Correct.

There are other

8

examples, and it is the discovery privilege that have been

9

historically noted, and those would be attorney-client,

10

attorney work product, deliberative process, if there are

11

specific, maybe psycho -- psychiatrist-patient, doctor-

12

patient, those types of discovery privileges, but in this

13

case there is no recognized trustee-beneficiary privilege.

14

There has not been recognized within -- there

15

has not been one recognized within the civil discovery

16

context, and FOIA is not a means to create a new civil

17

discovery privilege.

18

Aircraft explicitly stated that, and that's cited in our

19

brief.

20

QUESTION:

This Court's decision in Weber

So you say that the petitioner would

21

ultimately lose, even though satisfying the interagency

22

requirement, because of the routinely available of

23

discovery product.

24
25

MR. HITCHINGS:

Our position is that the

Government simply cannot meet that threshold interagency
35

1

test here, because you have a circumstance where they are

2

not serving as a neutral outside, objective consultant.

3

They are -- in this case the tribes are an interested

4

party.

5

privilege amongst not only that interested party but many

6

others, including other Federal interests, and our

7

position is that test just simply is not met here because

8

of those circumstances.

9

The Government is allocating a valuable benefit or

Now, granted, there are circumstances where you

10

do have a paid outside consultant that is providing

11

information to the agency because it may be outside of

12

that agency's expertise, but the paid consultant has no

13

direct interest in the decision that the Government is

14

making for which those correspondence are provided, and

15

that's clearly distinguishable from this case.

16

QUESTION:

Suppose that we thought -- I may be

17

taking it out of context, but Justice Scalia once wrote

18

that that's exemption -- said something about including

19

any agency document that is part of the deliberative

20

process.

21

to read section 5 in that way, would your documents come

22

into that, too, not the ones you want, but your own

23

submissions?

24
25

Just taking that phrase, suppose it was possible

MR. HITCHINGS:

From the Klamath water users,

members themselves?
36

1

QUESTION:

Yes.

2

MR. HITCHINGS:

Yes.

Yes.

I don't think so.

We're not

3

asking for that.

Granted, we would love to have the

4

opportunity to have secret communications with Interior on

5

the decisions that we're making here, but we recognize

6

that FOIA exemption 5 just is not read that broadly, and

7

should not be read that broadly, and I think in Justice

8

Scalia's dissent, I believe that was in the Julian case,

9

he specifically stated that it talks about a consultant in

10

a governmentally conferred capacity, and that seems to

11

indicate that you're talking about the traditional

12

relationship where you have a consultant that's paid by

13

the Government to give it expert advice.

14

QUESTION:

I wasn't dissenting on this point.

15

just had to reach this point because of my dissent,

16

whereas the majority didn't have to reach it, so --

17

MR. HITCHINGS:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. HITCHINGS:

Correct.

In that case --

The Court hasn't really addressed -Right, exactly.

In that case,

20

the -- whether the documents were intraagency was not

21

raised below and was not part of the majority's opinion.

22
23

I

If the Court has nothing further, that would
conclude my statement.

24

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Hitchings.

25

Mr. Stewart, you have 2 minutes remaining.
37

1

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. STEWART:

I'd like to address the question

4

of the role of the Government in allocating a scarce

5

benefit, and particularly with regard to the Oregon

6

general stream adjudication.

7

I think as the Court is certainly aware, the way

8

that a priority system of water rights works is the most

9

senior water user gets whatever rights it's entitled to,

10

and then if there's water remaining the next most senior,

11

and so forth down the line, and the position of the United

12

States in the Oregon adjudication, and a position which

13

was upheld by the Ninth Circuit in Adair, is that the

14

tribes have a priority date earlier than that of the

15

Klamath project.

16

And there are questions remaining as to the

17

quantification of that right, but when the United States

18

presents claims on behalf of the tribe, if the United

19

States believed that the tribes was entitled to a certain

20

amount of water but nevertheless asserted claims for a

21

lesser amount in order that more should be left over for

22

the project, we would be breaching our fiduciary duty to

23

the tribes.

24
25

QUESTION:

The more difficult question, if you

want to take 30 seconds, is how do you get the tribe
38

1

beneficiary into interagency even if you couldn't get

2

consultants in there?

3

MR. STEWART:

Again, we think that the ultimate

4

question should be whether the Government has solicited --

5

in this case whether the Government has solicited input

6

from a person technically outside the four walls of the

7

Government based on a distinct perspective which is

8

particularly useful to the Government, and an analogy --
