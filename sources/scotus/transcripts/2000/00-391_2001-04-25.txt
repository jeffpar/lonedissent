ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. KRAUSS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

MR. KRAUSS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

The Florida supreme court, based on the facts

13

before it, added an unreasonable and unwarranted condition

14

to this Court's holding in New York v. Belton.

15

Florida supreme court has determined that it is improper

16

to conduct a Belton search unless the police initiate

17

contact with the arrestee while he is still in the

18

automobile, or he exited at the direction of the police.

19

The

The facts of this case are very simple.

Thomas drove his vehicle into the driveway of a residence

21

of a home at which drug arrests were being effected at the

time.

car, and was at the rear right, near the trunk, when

24

Detective Maney stopped him.

I don't -- do not believe so, Your

Honor.

No, there obviously is a

one of them.

have been totally untethered from the justifications for

the Belton rule because, as I understand it, at the time

the search was made, the defendant was in the house.

What the Court is --

20

QUESTION:

Well, if that's going to be your

justification, I don't see how you can put any limitation

on it at all, because there was just as much an arrest 24

As I stated, there

It's an arrest scenario, and it should not be

QUESTION:

But I don't see why continuing course

8

of arrest has any relevance except in relation to the

9

preservation of evidence that he might otherwise destroy,

10

or the possibility of a weapon that he might have used to

11

hurt the officer, and when each of those possibility,

12

possibilities has been definitively negated, what is left

13

of Belton?

14

MR. KRAUSS:

Well, because at the time of the

15

arrest,

is at the car, and therefore he is within reach, immediate

reach of the vehicle.

Belton search is still permissible.

Why is that, because it says in

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
So -- and Belton is extrapolated and

11

explained in Chimel, so can you -- in Chimel you can

12

search the room when you arrest somebody who's in the

13

house, so under Chimel, can you arrest a person in the

14

house, take him down to the police station, and go back

15

and search the room?

Not necessarily, because there may

QUESTION:

Well, presumably the police could

on whether the person stayed in the car, or exited on his

MR. KRAUSS:

MR. KRAUSS:

2

QUESTION:

Absolutely.
-- and you would have to -- whatever

3

the interval would be, it would have to be reasonable

4

under the Fourth Amendment.

5

MR. KRAUSS:

Yes, Your Honor.

It would

6

certainly -- if we're talking about the contemporaneous

7

requirement, certainly it would have to be, and that's why

8

I suggest that, especially in this case, where it was one

9

flowing, fluid arrest scenario, where

Mr. Thomas was

10

placed under arrest right when he was by the car, and that

11

is when the need to either preserve evidence or exhibit

12

concern for officer safety arises, at that moment.

13

QUESTION:

Why -- Mr. Krauss, he's in the house

14

with handcuffs, so any concern about his destroying

15

evidence or getting a weapon is attenuated, but the need

16

with respect, even to the car -- isn't it ordinarily the

17

case that if you arrest a person, and there's the car out

18

there on the street, the car will be impounded, and there

19

will be an inventory inspection, and there will turn up

20

the same thing that this turned up on the scene, so why do

21

the police, once they've gotten the driver out of it, have

22

to search on the spot, instead of going through the lawful

23

procedure of getting the inventory --

MR. KRAUSS:

I respectfully submit to you,

Justice Ginsburg, that in this case the State could not

First of all, the

QUESTION:

Mr. Thomas'.

Second of all,

It did not pose

It made a difference that he was

parked in the driveway, rather than on the street.

7

MR. KRAUSS:

And I also have concern because,

8

even though there were several people that were arrested

9

in the house,

Mr. Thomas' sister was not, and

10

there's nothing that could have said that she couldn't

11

have moved -- if it was necessary to move the car, that

12

she couldn't have been the one to move it, and if she has

13

an ability to remove it, she obviously has the ability to

14

get any weapons or destroy any evidence that was in the

15

car also.

16

QUESTION:

Why shouldn't -- under Belton, why

17

shouldn't a policeman be put to the choice?

18

protect yourself the Belton way, do an immediate search

19

while the arrested person is still nearby the car, and

20

possibly able to dive in and get a gun, or, if you want to

21

play it really safe, handcuff him and take him back to the

22

police cruiser.

MR. KRAUSS:

Because I don't necessarily believe

that in the volatile and dangerous situation that is the

arrest, that we have to give the police these types of

choices to make.

That's not a hard choice.

MR. KRAUSS:

If you can handcuff him and lead him

But I don't know that the officer

would want to make the wrong choice at that point.
QUESTION:

What you're saying is, you think the

officer wants to be able to search the car.
MR. KRAUSS:

No, Your Honor.

I think the

14

officer has the constitutional right to search the car,

15

because he arrested someone who was in proximity to the

16

car at the time of the arrest.

17

QUESTION:

18

Well, he does or he doesn't,

depending, perhaps, on what we decide in this case.

justifications, and --

8

I think those are very valid

QUESTION:

Well, but under Chimel itself, it

seems to me that the rationale has now disappeared.

9

MR. KRAUSS:

Well, CHimel -- Belton was created

10

just so the police don't have to make these case-by-case

11

determinations as to what the area to search is, so -- and

12

I do come back to the quote in U.S. v. Robinson, where the

13

very fact of arrest alone is enough to justify the search,

14

and it's the same situation in a Belton search.

15

I would further submit that at least via dicta,

16

this Court has recognized the point of law we are

17

advancing today in Michigan v. Long.

footnote that had the suspect in that case been arrested

MR. KRAUSS:

He was taken -Does the record show?
There were other officers in the

drug arrests at the time.

stated, the need to do the search arises at the time that

he is arrested in the proximity of the car.

QUESTION:

So he was taken into the house,

handcuffed, and then the officer came out.

MR. KRAUSS:

QUESTION:

Do the cases talk about whether

MR. KRAUSS:

QUESTION:

MR. KRAUSS:

4

QUESTION:

As far as other -Some other line of cases.
I'm not aware of any, Your Honor.
So you think that the Chimel rule may

5

apply as well to protect the officer from other persons

6

who might grab a weapon, or destroy --

7

MR. KRAUSS:

No.

I think when you're at the

8

scene and you're dealing with vehicles, there are

9

different interests involved.

We are dealing with an

10

automobile versus a home.

11

protections in a home, and when you're in a situation on

12

the street, where anything can happen, it's a volatile

13

situation, there may be other codefendants or other

14

confederates mulling about, the ability for the police to

15

protect themselves is paramount.

16

QUESTION:

There are certainly further

Well, so that -- so that, then, do

17

you agree that under the Chimel rule, a search can be made

persons?

1

to make it clear that Chimel is limited to the immediate

2

area of control, whereas Belton is a little more

3

expansive, in that you have defined what that area is, and

4

I think that is a little more expansive, and I am saying

5

that Belton would assist the officer in that type of

6

situation if there are others in the area, absolutely.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Krauss, there's another

8

distinction, another unusual feature of this case, in

9

addition to the defendant being removed from the scene.

10

That is, in Belton the man was speeding, I think.

11

the other cases that I know of, there was a stop because

12

of a traffic violation, and here, the car wasn't

13

implicated in the justification for the arrest at all.

wasn't doing anything wrong with the car.

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

21

MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
When an individual is arrested alongside the car

22

that he has just occupied, the rule of New York v. Belton

23

permits the police to search the car incident to the

24

arrest. In our view, that is true regardless of the reason

25

that the suspect got out of the car before the arrest.

MR. GARRE:

important for the Court to recognize that this case is a

But what is left of the Belton

20

MR. GARRE:

The justification for the search is

21

provided by the arrest.

Belton requires that the search

22

be a contemporaneous incident to the arrest, and we think

23

in a situation like this, where the search and the arrest

24

are plainly part of the same process, where only five

25

minutes separates the arrest from the search -- the

officer on this scene had a choice.

When he arrested the

2

respondent at the car, he was by himself outside.

3

a choice of leaving the respondent unattended by the car

4

as he searched the car, or he had the choice of bringing

5

the respondent into the house, which, although the record

6

is a little bit unclear on this, it suggests it was only

7

about 20 feet away, where other officers were, and where

other people were after drug arrests had been made in that

He had

We think that the Constitution and the Fourth

11

Amendment gives the officer in Officer Maney's position

12

the leeway to make that choice, and if the Court were to

adopt a different regime, it would be inviting all the

The rule is that

MR. GARRE:

We think that there is jurisdiction.

We think that the Belton issue has been finally decided,

on which this Court granted certiorari, which is whether

initiation of contact with the suspect in the car, and

there are situations where police come upon a suspect

That may not be enough in itself,

in possession of marijuana, but that they had used

marijuana because of the burnt marijuana smoke.

Therefore, he had probable

He ordered the passengers out of the car and

6

placed them under arrest.

He did not handcuff them,

7

either because he could not, because there were four of

8

them, or because he chose not to do so.

9

What he did to

10

Thruway.

He separated them so that they could not touch

11

each other, being in reaching distance of each other, and

12

this was one officer without backup, and he was confronted

13

with four individuals.

14

With the --

Well, you don't think Belton's

limited to an arrest of four people, surely?

MS. DODGE:

No, certainly not.
So what does that have to do with

this, and why does the reason for the person arrested

difference could it possibly make that the person arrested

wanted to make contact with him, so he did not have an

2

incentive to grab any weapons or destroy evidence, because

3

the officer was merely there, and he hadn't signaled his

4

desire to make contact with Mr. Thomas at the time.

5

QUESTION:

No, but Belton would apply even if

6

the individual was standing outside the car.

He might not

7

have any weapon on him, he might not have any evidence on

8

him, but if, in the course of the interview with the

9

officer, he thought it was in his interest to leap back

10

into the car, or grab into the car and get a gun, or get

11

some evidence that he could swallow, or something of that

12

sort, the -- that was the justification for Belton, and I

13

would suppose that that would be the justification, even

14

if the individual had himself voluntarily gotten out of

15

the car.

16

MS. DODGE:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Perhaps so.

However, --

Well, if that is so, then the Florida

distinction really cannot be sustained.
MS. DODGE:

The way I see it is that once a

20

person gets out of the car on his own, without the

21

prompting from the officer or without initiating contact,

22

he's outside of the car, and the regular considerations of

10

Do you think that the nuances -- and certainly they

Yes, I think they are, because when

you look at Belton itself, Belton allows the search of an

13

occupant's vehicle pursuant to arrest.

of the term, occupant.

someone has left the car --

So in other words, once you get --

that line.

in this Court's cases, and certainly not in Belton, for

the line the Florida court drew.

I mean, I don't see any justification at all

MS. DODGE:

No.

What I think that they saw was

that there was -- they made a rule that in essence

dovetails with the rule in Belton.

17

a problem in that there's no definition of who is an

18

occupant, and it's very hard to determine who is a recent

occupant, because of the fact that, you know, somebody

What Belton says, in exact language is, it says,

as a custodial arrest of the occupant, as a

18

confrontation, or at least signaling, leaves out the case

19

where the police are tailing someone because they think

20

they will be led to the crack house, and they deliberately

21

do not want to confront or signal, so in your argument, I

22

take it, someone in that situation would not come within

23

the Belton rule, because the police hadn't signaled, is

24

that right?

25

MS. DODGE:

Yes, Your Honor.

That person would

not come under the automatic Belton rule.

2

the person is distancing themselves from the car.

3

In other words,

However, if there is probable cause to believe

4

that that person is going to the crack house and is

5

carrying contraband, then the car could be searched

6

pursuant to the automobile exception, so it would be a

7

decision -- the officer in that case might want to search

8

that car.

what's in it, but it doesn't equate with the necessity to

He might desperately want to do so, to see

10

do so to protect himself or to protect any evidence that

11

someone might grab during an arrest process that occurs as

12

the person has distanced himself from the car.

13

QUESTION:

So you are supporting the Florida

14

rule about, is it confrontation or signal, but you're not

15

stressing -- you don't put any weight on the absence of a

16

nexus here, that this, unlike the Belton line of cases,

17

did not involve a traffic violation?

18

MS. DODGE:

Correct.

I don't think it

19

necessarily has to be a nexus, for example, if an officer

20

were following a car, he knew the occupant's identity, and

21

he knew for sure that there had been a warrant issued for

22

the arrest, he would be stopping for the warrant and not

23

for a traffic violation, so that there would not be,

24

necessarily, a nexus, other than the fact that the person

25

is in the car at the time that he is actually apprehended,

or the officer's pursuing him.

What this does -- and I believe the Florida

3

courts have never considered the Chimel aspects, or Chimel

aspects of this case.

not the passenger compartment and all of the closed

6

containers, the glove box, the pocket on the side of the

door were still within the actual grabbing area of Mr.

8

Thomas.

They've never decided whether or

In fact, the record is rather sparse with regard

10

to the facts.

11

we don't know whether or not the door was locked.

12

that Mr. Thomas was in the company of at least three or

four narcotics agents who were in the house finishing up

this case isn't really finished.

QUESTION:

MS. DODGE:

I would hope so.
All right.
Well, we believe that the contact

13

rule is a reasonable rule, even though it does -- it does,

14

admittedly, it expands Belton, but it's reasonable,

15

because the officer starts the person's thought processes,

16

adrenaline going the minute he starts saying, you know, I

17

would like to have contact with you.

18

There are officers on the street everywhere.

19

Not any of them is a threat to an individual unless the

20

officer is in pursuit of that individual, or has somehow

21

put him on notice that there's going to be some kind of

22

confrontation.

23

So I think it's a good balance to be struck

between the privacy rights of an individual in a vehicle

25

and in his containers, because Belton does -- it does

any decorations or mail that you might happen to be

MR. KRAUSS:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I just want

14

to address very briefly the jurisdictional issue that

Justice Breyer raised.

It would be our point that, first of all, what

20

the question of law that has been decided, the question of

Fourth Amendment interpretation made by the Florida

Supreme Court limiting this Court's Belton holding is

going to survive, and we therefore submit that this Court

Lastly, I would just like to point out, at pages
