CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

4

now in Number 99-1408, Gail Atwater v. The City of Lago

5

Vista.

6

Mr. De Carli.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. DE CARLI

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. DE CARLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Reasonableness is the touchstone of the Fourth

12

Amendment.

13

a broad new rule that permits custodial arrest for any

14

offense committed in an officer's presence regardless of

15

the nature of that offense.

16

so ignores the Fourth Amendment's requirement of

17

reasonableness.

18

The court of appeals below, however, announced

The court of appeals in doing

First, it ignores the fact that a common law at

19

the time of the Fourth Amendment's adoption such an arrest

20

would not have been layoff.

21
22
23

QUESTION:

Well, why would the common law be

involved here Mr. De Carli if Texas law says otherwise?
MR. DE CARLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, the common law

24

should be considered because it is our position that the

25

Fourth Amendment incorporates the protections, the
3

1

restrictions on arrest that existed at the time of the

2

Fourth Amendment's adoption.

3

QUESTION:

Well, but you're arguing here that

4

this offense should not have led to a custodial arrest,

5

now as part of that argument has to be a condition of

6

Texas law, isn't it?

7

custodial arrest for this, wouldn't your case be

8

different?

9

I mean if Texas law had authorized a

If you conceded that it authorized it?
MR. DE CARLI:

No, Your Honor, because it is our

10

position that the Fourth Amendment restricts the use of

11

custodial arrest for minor offenses such as this.

12

Texas were to increase the penalty for this offense, then

13

it would be a different balancing.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

If

Even with a warrant you couldn't do a

custodial arrest?
MR. DE CARLI:

No, but let me qualify that.

It

17

would be a much weaker argument, one we would lose the

18

common law argument.

19

well aware of this Court's respect for warrants and the

20

fact that interjecting a neutral and detached magistrate

21

operates as a check. However, the fact is, by requiring a

22

warrant, still that would only require probable cause and

23

it's our position that probable cause does not

24

sufficiently balance the competing interest, although I

25

concede it's a much, it would be a much weaker argument --

Two, however, this Court -- we're

4

1

QUESTION:

See, my problem is with your common

2

law argument because the Fourth Amendment does not contain

3

a warrant requirement, it just says if you do have, get a

4

warrant, it has to be based upon probable cause, blah,

5

blah, blah, blah, but the only root requirement of the

6

Fourth Amendment is that the arrest be reasonable.

7

telling me that you could do arrests at common law, so

8

long -- at least so long as there was a warrant.

9

MR. DE CARLI:

That's correct, Justice Scalia,

10

and for that reason we say --

11

QUESTION:

12

You're

Why would a warrant make it more

reasonable?

13

MR. DE CARLI:

Because, Your Honor, it would

14

interject a neutral and detached magistrate who we would

15

hope would say Officer Turek, why are you arresting this

16

woman for not wearing a seat belt? Why do we not issue a

17

summons.

18

Why not issue just a traffic citation.
QUESTION:

Would that be a magistrate's

19

prerogative ordinarily?

20

prerogative to find probable cause.

21

MR. DE CARLI:

Isn't it a magistrate's

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and for

22

that reason I'm willing to concede that if a warrant were

23

obtained, this arrest still would be reasonable.

24

position is that probable cause, although it works as a

25

balancing of the competing interest of law enforcement and
5

Our

1

the individual in some instances, in the setting before

2

the court and in most traffic offenses, it does nothing to

3

balance the competing interest of the individual.

4

QUESTION:

What about the situation of a traffic

5

violator, maybe parking tickets or maybe seat belt use,

6

who continues repeatedly to refuse to use a seat belt or

7

to pay the parking fee when parking a car and has a whole

8

string of tickets for it?

9

to the repeated nature and in the case of seat belts

Does there come a time when due

10

possible endangerment of children that the state can say,

11

okay, custody here is required, this person just won't

12

cooperate?

13

MR. DE CARLI:

Justice O'Connor, I believe that

14

time would come when, if I understand you correctly,

15

you're alluding to nonappearances, the repeat offender.

16

QUESTION:

Well, it's possible that a

17

nonappearance could amount to something that generates

18

jail time, but I'm just talking about the repeat offender.

19

MR. DE CARLI:

20

QUESTION:

21

Okay.

Without an offense that requires jail

time.

22

MR. DE CARLI:

Without the nonappearance

23

problem.

What that raises is it's the distinction between

24

punishment and enforcement.

25

is not the role of the police officer, that's the role for

Punishing the repeat offender

6

1

a judge or a legislature that has provided heightened

2

penalties.

3
4

QUESTION:

Not punishment, a concern for highway

safety.

5

MR. DE CARLI:

Well, Your Honor, the thing is,

6

even the repeated, the fact if there are repeated

7

penalties and there is no heightened penalty, well then

8

the legislature has made a determination that on the

9

balance that does not regard that aspect of highway safety

10

is that sufficient to justify the intrusion.

11

QUESTION:

I notice that Judge Weiner in the

12

case below had a suggested approach, a different approach,

13

that when there's a plausible articulable reason for

14

affecting such an intrusion, it's lawful.

15

MR. DE CARLI:

Yes, Your Honor, and I read that

16

as trying to encompass what this Court in its opinion

17

issued last week referred to as vehicular-bound imminent

18

threats to life and limb which would be driving while

19

intoxicated, driving under the influence of drugs or

20

alcohol.

21
22
23

QUESTION:

Oh, presumably that can generate jail

time.
MR. DE CARLI:

In some cases.

In most cases,

24

however, I believe that in some jurisdictions still first

25

offense drunk driving there is no jail time.
7

So I would

1

still, we would still argue it would be reasonable,

2

because some of those offenses driving intoxicated and

3

reckless driving amount, in essence, to breaches of the

4

peace, they are by their nature violent, they impose a

5

threat.

6

the road directly and I think --

7
8
9

They threaten the health and safety of others on

QUESTION:

Does repeated nonuse of a seat belt

for minor children constitute a threat to safety?
MR. DE CARLI:

Justice O'Connor, I think it

10

would be a closer question, but I would still defer to the

11

fact that if the legislature has not increased, has not

12

provided for heightened penalties, for repeat offenders,

13

repeat nonuse of seat belts, that still it is not that

14

limited category of offenses that impose an imminent

15

threat to life and limb on the road.

16

QUESTION:

When you say -- go ahead --

17

QUESTION:

Suppose in this case the driver was

18
19

from another state, could there have been an arrest made.
MR. DE CARLI:

No, Your Honor, and let me

20

explain why.

21

kind of situation in the uniform violator compact act

22

where if somebody does not appear, then their license can

23

be revoked in that other state.

24
25

One, states have already provided for that

QUESTION:

So the risk of nonappearance is not

part of the balance that you want the police officer to -8

1

MR. DE CARLI:

Well, Justice Kennedy, I think

2

the approach to that, there already is a way of dealing

3

with that and that is if a party does not appear, then

4

that's a separate offense, there is a penalty provided for

5

that, a warrant may be issued for that person's arrest,

6

and they are then subject to punishment for that

7

additional offense.

8

QUESTION:

9

Can a police officer in an

out-of-state case use the time-honored tradition of giving

10

you a police escort to the station where you pay your

11

fine?

12

MR. DE CARLI:

13

QUESTION:

14

That's a stop, it's a seizure of

sorts.

15

MR. DE CARLI:

16

QUESTION:

17

some of our states.

18

Your Honor --

The problem that we --

That's sort of an old tradition in

MR. DE CARLI:

Well, it depends -- the problem

19

with that approach is it leads to, and in part what

20

respondents, respondents have implicitly made this

21

argument that this was a brief arrest. Ms. Atwater was

22

helped into the police car.

23

distinguishing between the degrees of the custodial

24

arrest, even though once that person is removed from the

25

scene, the safety of their car, once under custodial

What that leads to is it's

9

1

arrest, their life -- or excuse me, their liberty and

2

property interests are completely forfeited.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. De Carli, a moment ago you said

4

you thought perhaps reckless driving might be a breach of

5

the peace.

6

The briefs indicate that there's considerable differences

7

to what it meant at common law.

8
9

Is that a term of art, breach of the peace?

MR. DE CARLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, it is clear at

common law that breach of the peace when used in the

10

context of the law of arrest referred to a group of

11

offenses that either involved violence or the type of

12

conduct that would incite immediate violence.

13

QUESTION:

The opposing briefs suggest

14

differently.

15

have supporting authority.

16

that's too happy a distinction.

17

breach of the peace which is basically a common law

18

concept.

19

But I recognize also that your briefs also

MR. DE CARLI:

I'm just not sure whether
What should turn on

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I

20

believe that if we look to, again the decision of last

21

week, and other decisions of this Court, Delaware v.

22

Prous, I guess Sitz would be an example, there are certain

23

offenses, in the context of the traffic offenses where by

24

their very nature they impose a grave risk of harm to

25

others on the road.
10

1

QUESTION:

What if Texas here had said that this

2

particular offense was, you know, that it could be 10 days

3

in jail or $300 fine?

4

did here?

5
6
7
8
9

Could the officer have done what he

MR. DE CARLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, it would be a

much closer case then.
QUESTION:

Could you answer -- answer yes or no

and then explain.
MR. DE CARLI:

Well, let me, part of my

10

vacillation is in -- we proposed a rule, in looking back

11

at that, I now wonder, well, perhaps the correct approach

12

would be to rely exclusively on the common law.

13

common law provided a clear boundary, breach of the peace,

14

nonbreach of the peace and felonies.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. DE CARLI:

The common law as of what date.
As of the adoption of the Fourth

17

Amendment which would be 1791.

18

QUESTION:

19

Justice's question, yes or no.

20
21
22

What is your answer to the Chief

MR. DE CARLI:
would be no.

The

Unless there were -- the answer

I'm sorry.

QUESTION:

What do you make of the nightwalker

23

statute argument that at the same period in which you're

24

arguing there was at least a threshold of immunity set

25

here, it was clear in English law that nightwalkers who
11

1

were not breaching the peace in your sense could be

2

arrested.

3

MR. DE CARLI:

Justice Souter, I think the

4

correct, I believe the correct way to look at the

5

nightwalker statutes is this was a time before any

6

lighting, anybody that was walking about in the dead of

7

night it was reasonable to presume that that person was a

8

felon, until --

9

QUESTION: Yeah, but the fact that the person was

10

a felon, even that he intended to commit a felony, is that

11

what you mean?

12

MR. DE CARLI:

Well that the person may have

13

committed a felon or they were up to no good. Nobody

14

walking about in the dead of the night in the 17th century

15

was doing anything other than contemplating criminal acts.

16

I think at the -- that's the way I understand the

17

nightwalker statute.

18
19
20
21
22

QUESTION:

They didn't have insomniacs back

then?
MR. DE CARLI:

I think Justice Kennedy they

stayed indoors because it was too dark.
QUESTION:

You answered the Chief Justice's

23

question that if the state had said we regard not buckling

24

up as very serious, therefore 10 days in jail, then you

25

would have no case to complain about a custodial arrest
12

1

for that, is that so?

2

MR. DE CARLI:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, again, it

3

depends on, our case is a core case, I mean it falls under

4

the rule the common law end of any balancing --

5

QUESTION:

But I'm just asking you the question.

6

MR. DE CARLI:

7

QUESTION:

Yes.

Is it just -- so a seat belt in one

8

state could be one thing if the state chooses to make it a

9

more serious offense, and another thing in another state?

10

MR. DE CARLI:

If the line is drawn not based on

11

the common law but as we had proposed in our brief the

12

jailable versus fine only distinction.

13

QUESTION:

Now here in this very case, could the

14

officer have said, child endangerment is a felony, so it's

15

not simply the misdemeanor of not buckling up, but you've

16

put your children in danger and therefore the offense is

17

child endangerment which is a felony.

18

MR. DE CARLI:

Several responses to that Justice

19

Ginsburg.

First, in that instance, probable cause, if the

20

arrest were based on alleged child endangerment there

21

probable cause would act as a restraint because the police

22

officer to justify the arrest would have to establish a

23

certain degree of certainty that the specific conduct was

24

child endangerment.

25

for several reasons, one, the legislature has imposed an

Now, this was not child endangerment

13

1

extremely minimal penalty, two, it's not child

2

endangerment because you are set -- by virtue of the fact

3

that if we were to call this child endangerment then not

4

using your turn signal or perhaps speeding or running a

5

red light, those are just as close to any possible harm as

6

not wearing a seat belt.

7

There's a causation problem, in other words.

8

And most importantly is that by, if we truly are concerned

9

about the welfare of the children, then arresting the

10

mother and taking the mother away is inflicting a far

11

greater harm on those children, and it's doing --

12

QUESTION:

Well, the facts here are very

13

unattractive.

14

mother is going to be stopped for not wearing a seat belt

15

and have her children in tears in the car while the mother

16

is hauled off to jail.

17
18

I mean one doesn't like to think that a

MR. DE CARLI:

You've got the perfect case.
We'd like to think so Justice

O'Connor.

19

QUESTION:

But I think what we're concerned with

20

is the broader rule because it has millions of

21

permutations and applications across the country.

22

conceivably the Fourth Amendment at bottom does always

23

require a kind of reasonableness test, and that's why I

24

thought Judge Weiner's approach might make a little sense

25

here.
14

And

1

MR. DE CARLI:

It might.

I mean the

2

extraordinary no arrest for fine only offenses absent an

3

articulable fact that explains why an arrest would be

4

justified.

5

QUESTION:

So what do you think, Bob, it seems

6

to me that the strongest argument against you has nothing

7

to do with this case, it has to do with the police

8

officers being human.

9

look, if somebody commits a crime in your presence you can

They say to the police officer,

10

arrest them.

But you can't use -- do an unusual thing,

11

you know, you can't use excessive force, et cetera, but as

12

long as you behave in a normal manner, crime, you see it,

13

arrest them. Anyone can understand that.

14

MR. DE CARLI:

15

QUESTION:

Right.

And the problem with your side and

16

the people who are supporting it is are they coming up

17

with something that works?

18

going to know the common law or breaches of the peace.

19

police -- they're just not going to understand that.

20

is there some kind of practical alternative to this simple

21

rule which has in it a way of catching abuses through the

22

nonnormal behavior.

23

MR. DE CARLI:

I mean, a policeman isn't
A
So

Justice Breyer, I really do

24

believe that in the context of traffic offenses, and I'll

25

explain a little bit later why it's valid to limit a
15

1

holding or a rule to traffic offenses, it is not all that

2

complex because there are only a few offenses that -- in

3

which, most of which this Court has identified in other

4

opinions where the arrest -- where the use of a custodial

5

arrest would indeed further enforcement, I mean, I guess

6

one, drunk driving, driving while intoxicated, reckless

7

driving, closer arguably the unlicensed driver, although

8

--

9

QUESTION:

Speeding.

10

MR. DE CARLI:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. DE CARLI:

No, Your Honor.

No what.
No, Your Honor, speeding -- it

13

would not be reasonable to arrest a driver for speeding

14

unless the speeding rose to the level of reckless driving.

15

And that's where you have the same probable cause

16

determinations.

17

QUESTION:

What if the state does think that --

18

QUESTION:

What if the speeder is from another

19

jurisdiction?

20

MR. DE CARLI:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

I'm sorry.

What if the speeder if from another

jurisdiction?
MR. DE CARLI:

Your Honor, oh, Justice Stevens,

24

again, that returns to the response I believe I gave to

25

Justice O'Connor or Justice Kennedy that in essence
16

1

respondents seek a prophylactic rule in that we are to

2

cede discretion to arrest to police officers on the chance

3

that people from another jurisdiction are going to run

4

away and not pay their fine.

5

QUESTION:

I think that's a standard rule for

6

policemen to stop motorists and state if you're from out

7

of the jurisdiction you either pay the fine now or follow

8

me to the courthouse.

9
10

MR. DE CARLI:
QUESTION:

But Justice Scalia --

I'm quite sure that's standard

11

procedure in any number of states.

12

bad, you just have to say, well, hope you come back to

13

Wyoming someday.

14

MR. DE CARLI:

And you say that's all

It's -- Justice Scalia, I think

15

the reason why it's, I mean if we're looking for a bright

16

line rule, the problem that permitting a custodial arrest

17

in that situation would lead to is, if we say, okay,

18

out-of-state person, he's not going to come back to

19

Wyoming, high risk, if you allow the arrest, then what

20

that means is the person is potentially held in custody

21

before a probable cause --

22

QUESTION:

I hate to constitutionalize all this

23

thing, everything becomes a constitutional case. Is there

24

a police chief in Lago Vista?

25

MR. DE CARLI:

Yes, yes, Justice Scalia.
17

1

QUESTION:

Is he elected?

2

MR. DE CARLI:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.

Do his constituents think it's a good

4

idea for his officers to arrest women for not having their

5

kids in seat belts.

6
7
8
9

MR. DE CARLI:

My understanding is there is a

deep divide in the community regarding the issue.
QUESTION:

But he's not in the case anymore and

that raises another question, given the division of the

10

judges, it's really interesting, the district court

11

thought your case was frivolous and then five judges on

12

the court of appeals thought it was very serious.

13

isn't it almost certain that this Officer Turek would have

14

qualified immunity given -- how could one say that the law

15

was clearly established given the division among the

16

Federal judges.

17

MR. DE CARLI:

But

I have three responses to that,

18

Justice Ginsburg.

19

not address that issue, the en bloc majority.

20

explicitly refrained from making that determination.

21

second, even though, yes, it is conceivably -- it would be

22

a tough hurdle to overcome with regard to Officer Turek.

23

However the city still is in the lawsuit and Judge --

24
25

QUESTION:

First, the Fifth Circuit clearly did
They
But

But the police chief isn't. He's been

dismissed and you're not challenging that. If you're
18

1

relying on a practice or policy of the city to hold the

2

city, where would that policy or practice have come from

3

other than the police chief who has been dismissed?

4

MR. DE CARLI:

My understanding is that the --

5

if it were to be remanded back to the Fifth Circuit, if

6

this Court were to find a Fourth Amendment violation, the

7

Fifth Circuit majority never addressed that -- those

8

specific issues, but it would still be live against the

9

city based on the finding of Judge Sparks that there was a

10

policy on the part of the city.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. DE CARLI:

The city had this policy.

Which judge made that.
Judge Sparks, Judge Sparks in the

13

-- I guess it would be Appendix -- the third Appendix

14

basically stated that it was a -- a policy was

15

established.

16

constitutional violation had been established.

17
18

A policy was established, but no

QUESTION:

This is the judge who thought the

claim was frivolous.

19

MR. DE CARLI:

20

judge.

21

counsel, frankly.

Yes, but Judge Sparks is a good

And I think part of that resulted from the trial

22

QUESTION: Mr. De Carli, let's assume that I

23

don't find your constitutional argument conclusive, at

24

this point I'll be candid to say I'm not sure how to

25

assess it.

But I assume that I don't find it conclusive.
19

1

One of the things that I would like to know more about if

2

we have to engage in a reasonableness determination here

3

in setting a standard, is how bad the problem is out

4

there.

5

whether it's from your brief or from the brief on the

6

other side, in a number of jurisdictions in which arrests

7

for misdemeanors without any distinction, and arrests for

8

even the more minor offenses, some states called them

9

violations, the sub-misdemeanor, but technically criminal

And one of the things that I know both, I forget

10

offenses, is permitted without warrant if committed in the

11

officer's presence.

12

And the commonness of the practice leads me to

13

question how many horrible cases like this one are there

14

out there?

15

indeed are about as good for you as I think, you know,

16

they could be, but are we, by the same token, faced with a

17

case which is very rare and should not be the basis for

18

constitutionalizing a general rule?

19

problem.

20

Are we faced with a case in which the facts

MR. DE CARLI:

How big is the

Justice Souter, I've tried to

21

determine how big the problem was by going to the

22

Department of Justice, which of course provides the most

23

authoritative statistics.

24

address the issue.

25

-- well, just a few weeks ago we saw the young girl

Unfortunately, they don't

However, anecdotally, there, you know

arrested for not -- for eating french fries in the

substation.

QUESTION:

MR. DE CARLI:

5

Where did we see this?
In the District of Columbia, I

believe.

QUESTION:

I hadn't seen it myself.

MR. DE CARLI:

QUESTION:

I didn't see it.

QUESTION:

He immerses himself in these briefs.

10

MR. DE CARLI:

11

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

It was in the --

And that's good.

It's not a constitutional violation

12

for a police officer to be a jerk.

13

to do is define whether there are some rules that we can

14

work with.

15

brief of the respondents summarized four or five different

16

tests being given by the amicus briefs and they're all

17

different.

18

-- you say on reflection this is adequate --

19

And what we're trying

And yours seems to me so amorphous, and the

And you're not even clear that your own tests

MR. DE CARLI:

Well, Justice Kennedy, all of the

20

tests provided by petitioners and their amici are actually

21

remarkably similar in that they all recognize that there

22

should be a limited amount of discretion for those close

23

cases, however, we can carve out whether that be through

24

offenses that involve -- of imminent threat of harm.

25

if we call it a breach of the peace.
21

Or if we draw a

Or

distinction between fine only and jailable, lines can be

drawn.

3

comment about the fear of the problem of

4

constitutionalizing everything, I refer to Justice Story's

5

comment that the Fourth Amendment was indeed an embodiment

6

of the common law.

7

That's one point.

QUESTION:

To get back to Justice Scalia's

What about deterrence?

Don't you

8

think people are going to be pretty unlikely to eat french

9

fries on the subway in Washington.

10

MR. DE CARLI:

11

QUESTION:

12

That's correct, Justice Scalia --

And maybe in Lago Vista, not to belt

up their kids?

MR. DE CARLI:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. DE CARLI:

Yes, but the problem --

Well is that worth nothing?
No.

But that is confusing

punishment with enforcement.

Deterrence is a

justification for punishment.

be enforcing laws and not punishing. Mr. Chief Justice, if

19

I may, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.

And police officers should

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROGER J. GEORGE

21

ON HALF OF RESPONDENTS

22

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE:

23

Mr. George we'll hear from you.

24

MR. GEORGE:

25

Very well, Mr. De Carli.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
22

1

The problem we're facing on the Fourth Amendment

2

has to include both the seizure and the scope of the

3

seizure and the nature of the seizure. And I want this

4

Court to pay particular attention to the Texas statutory

5

scheme, because the Texas statutory scheme is remarkable

6

in that in traffic violations particularly, as opposed to

7

other kinds of violations, it provides very explicitly

8

that once an officer makes the decision to arrest, as

9

opposed to giving a citation, that officer must

10

immediately and the word in the statute is immediately,

11

take the accused before the nearest magistrate and to have

12

that magistrate determine whether or not the person should

13

have to put up a bond or be released on their own

14

recognizance.

15

in my opinion specifically authorized by this Court's

16

opinion in U.S. v. Watson, if you read the specific

17

footnote 11 in that opinion, that is the specific kind of

18

procedure that was authorized by this Court.

That system is exactly the system that is

19

It has the advantages that is the tradition in

20

this country, at least since we've had automobiles, that

21

in rural Texas, where I'm from, the fact that you get --

22

run a red light in El Paso, and you're from Brady, doesn't

23

-- the people in El Paso are somewhat concerned that

24

they'll ever see you again.

25

something about it in today's world of computers and

It's a little easier to do

23

1

instant, relatively instant communication.

2

QUESTION:

Mr. George, can I just ask sort of a

3

general question, why wouldn't that interest, and

4

obviously you're certainly entitled to arrest somebody

5

who's about to flee the jurisdiction or something like

6

that, but why wouldn't that interest be accommodated by

7

the statement of Justice Weiner, Judge Weiner in his

8

dissent?

9

long as it's plausible and relates to the problem.

There's got to be some reason, any reason, as
And

10

the reason there is obvious the guy may not show up to pay

11

the fine.

12

MR. GEORGE:

I believe the problem with Judge

13

Weiner's appointment is the problem of being too unclear

14

as to exactly what kind of reasons are good enough

15

reasons.

16

QUESTION:

It's about like a Terry stop, that's

17

pretty -- if there's a particular articulable reason to

18

suspect there's a problem here you can make a Terry stop,

19

I don't see that it's that different. That seems to work.

20
21

MR. GEORGE:

It does work in the Terry stop

situation and we can --

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. GEORGE:

Why wouldn't it work here?
You can argue it was here.

I mean

24

this man's -- if you look at page 422 of the record, his

25

police report says I just stopped her a few weeks ago for
24

1

the same violation.

That's disputed fact.

2

what he articulated.

3

violators was at least written on the contemporaneous

4

repeat offense report. It's important -QUESTION:

6

MR. GEORGE:

7

QUESTION:

And your concern about the repeat

5

I'm not asking about this case.
I understand that.
I'm asking about an appropriate

8

workable rule.

9

formulation in your view is unworkable.

10

But that's

And I want to know why the Weiner

MR. GEORGE:

I think -- well, I think it leads

11

to the same problems that we've had to some extent in this

12

Terry stop rules.

13

coupled in my opinion with this instant immediate

14

appearance before somebody else to make the decision.

15

this case Judge Thompson in Lago Vista agreed that some

16

bond was required here.

17

Some rules, because it has to be

QUESTION:

In

I'm not sure that a proper

18

articulable rule -- do you think that an acceptable

19

articulable reason is that there's a breach of the peace

20

in the more narrow sense?

21

annoying people and getting boisterous and what not.

22

MR. GEORGE:

23

QUESTION:

You know, the guy's really

No.
Because I mean it seems to me you

24

don't necessarily have to take him in to stop that.

25

could go over and tell him, you know, you got a fine and
25

You

1

if you do it again you're going to get another fine.

2

might shut him up right away.

3

MR. GEORGE:

That

I absolutely agree with that. And I

4

don't think this Court has, at least if you read U.S. v.

5

Watson, New York v. Payton, Judge White, Justice White's

6

dissent in Welsh v. Wisconsin concurred in by the current

7

Chief Justice all indicated as did the American Law

8

Institute's model code referred to in U.S. v. Watson, all

9

provided that the rule for arrest was, I see the person do

10

it, in fact the ALI rule was, I saw a petty offense

11

happening in front of the officer.

12

In this case, there were five such offenses,

13

driving without the seat belts, no driver's license --

14
15

QUESTION:

Their suggestion is there be another

rule.

16

MR. GEORGE:

17

QUESTION:

I understand.
And the other rule would be what

18

Justice O'Connor just said.

19

the same, what's wrong with that?

20

answer to that would be what is the set of arrests to

21

which that rule applies.

22

the set of arrests that are punishable by fine only.

23
24
25

MR. GEORGE:

And so my question would be
I thought frankly your

And then I was going to suggest

Well, I think that the same reason

that there's something wrong with that -QUESTION:

Now, what's wrong with that.
26

1

MR. GEORGE:

Well, it assumes that the officer

2

knows enough facts at the time to make a determination of

3

what the crime will ultimately be charged.

4

QUESTION:

Well, as long as the officer has to

5

have, doesn't the officer can arrest him only if he thinks

6

he's breaking the law.

7

was he breaking.

8

if it's a law that's punishable by a fine only he has to

9

have some reason for arresting the person rather than just

10
11

So you say Mr. Policeman, what law

And the policeman has to understand that

citing.
MR. GEORGE:

Well, as this Court decided not to

12

adopt that rule in Berkimer.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. GEORGE:

15
16

My question is why not.
The answer is, because for example,

much conduct can be both felony and misdemeanor.
QUESTION:

Well, that's absolutely fine, if the

17

policeman thinks, forget felony/misdemeanor, I agree with

18

you that felony/misdemeanor is not a workable rule.

19

don't know if others do or not. But felony/misdemeanor

20

falls into the problem that different states define

21

misdemeanor differently and it's so complicated nobody

22

understands it.

23

rule that's been suggested by others, it's not mine

24

originally, that if it's punishable by a fine only that's

25

where Justice O'Connor's principle kicks in.

All right.

I

So that's why I asked the

Now, what

would be wrong with that?

MR. GEORGE:
know enough facts.

4

Because -- same reason.

They don't

For example, in Texas --

QUESTION:

Is that your only reason, Mr. George,

5

just that you're willing to argue this out on a

6

case-by-case basis?

7

that when it says unreasonable seizures in the

8

Constitution it has something in mind and doesn't leave it

9

up to this Court to sit back and decide what's reasonable

I thought part of your argument was

10

and unreasonable.

I thought your argument was based on

11

the fact that this has never been understood to be the

12

constitutional rule. There has always been authority for

13

the -- for policemen to conduct arrests of this sort.

Absolutely.

MR. GEORGE:

Which, if they're abusive, the

That's exactly the basis of my

argument.
QUESTION:

Why don't you put that as your first

line of defense and then argue on the, you know, on the -QUESTION:

If by chance the first line of

defense was breached.
QUESTION:

Mr. George is trying convince of us

that that's the reason -MR. GEORGE:

Thank you Justice Scalia. Returning

If the first line is breached, let me

The problem is illustrated by

No way to know on the roadside whether this

The answer is, if you don't know, you

have no articulable reason.

QUESTION:

That's the answer.

That's

If you don't know, you don't arrest.

13

The burden is on the officer to be certain that it is the

14

second offense or the third offense, whatever is

15

necessary.

16

MR. GEORGE:

Yes, Justice Souter, that --

17

Justice Breyer asked me why -- what's wrong with the jail

18

versus fine distinction.

19

burden on the officer requires too much of the officer and

20

of course I have my first line of defense again, that is,

21

that has never been --

QUESTION:

And in my view it is to put the

can't the officer just radio in?

11

QUESTION:

Well, then you're going to have the

same problem when he goes before the magistrate in this
little town.

They still don't know anything.

MR. GEORGE:

I understand.

But you have an

12

independent nonadversarial determination of what the terms

13

of release ought to be, because we're only talking about

14

whether to release people on their own recognizance for

15

appearance at trial as opposed to requiring some sort of

16

financial security for those people to appear at trial.

17

QUESTION:

Yes, but Judge Weiner's rule, it's

18

important to keep in mind, it only kicks in if it's a

19

fine-only offense in the first place, but if there is a

20

reason such concern about appearance at trial, bingo,

21

you're protected.

22

certain large categories, one is the out-of-town speeders,

23

you could always haul him to the station house, that's

been settled for years and years and years as Justice

Scalia points out.

I mean these situations do fall into

But what about those where there's
30

1

absolutely no plausible reason for saying I have to make a

2

custodial arrest here.

3

absolute discretion just because he doesn't like the

4

person or something of that nature?

5

MR. GEORGE:

Will you give the officer total

Well, the discretion of the

6

officer, the answer is no there's not absolute discretion

7

because there's the limits of the equal protection clause,

8

there's other kinds of constitutional limitations.

Yes.

summary judgment where he has never been deposed and all

2

we have is arrest reports.

MR. GEORGE:

Right.
So the only thing I have is his

says that he was -- she had violated the same statute and

he was concerned.

And on the basis of his arrest report, he

children?

11

think that's fine.

12

Even knowing it was a mother with two

I mean this is kind of an amazing case, but you

MR. GEORGE:

Well, it would be a lot better that

13

the children have to deal with having their mother taken

14

before the magistrate than having to deal with the brain

15

damage if they had -- she had stepped on the brake five

16

minutes later, five minutes later, would that 5-year-old

You don't have to think it's fine to

think it's not unconstitutional, do you.

22

MR. GEORGE:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

No, as I understood -There are a lot of really stupid

things that aren't unconstitutional.
MR. GEORGE:

Being a jerk is not

1

unconstitutional.

2

jerk, let's just give them that position, and he was a

3

jerk in this instance, that does not create a

constitutional violation.

5

And assuming that Officer Turek is a

QUESTION:

It's true, in trying to think this

6

through, and I'm having a difficult time working on this

7

and I'm trying to think it through, and it seemed to me

8

the strongest argument against the Weiner position is that

9

it would lead to writing volume 7 of the treatise on the

10

Fourth Amendment which would have an infinite number of

11

rules in it about when the Terry stop-type justification

12

is enough or isn't enough.

13

seems to me we ought to reserve that for there being a

14

real problem.

15

why anything you could say in respect to the, what you've

16

read, in doing research for this, as to the scope and

17

nature of the problem in general would be helpful to me.

And rather than write -- it

But is there a real problem here? That's

18

MR. GEORGE:

19

QUESTION:

No, there is no real problem.
I know you think that, but I wondered

20

if you've come across some things that you could refer me

21

to.

22

MR. GEORGE:

No.

The only things we have come

23

across are the racial profiling issues.

24

Jersey experience and we have some of the amici on the

25

other side presenting that problem to this Court and this
33

We have the New

1

is a prophylactic solution to racial profiling because you

2

never have custodial arrests for traffic violations.

3

is our judgment if that is the problem, if that's the only

4

problem presented here, we deal with that problem by

5

dealing with the equal protection violation it presents

6

rather than creating, in my opinion, a whole lot more work

7

for this Court and the lower Federal courts on deciding

8

what the appropriate standard would be for this new

9

variation away from probable cause.

10

QUESTION:

It

Mr. George, one of your arguments is

11

the difficulty-of-administration argument, and you said

12

earlier that when we're dealing with a level of offense in

13

which it may be difficult to tell on the side of the road

14

whether this would be subject to arrest or not subject to

15

arrest, the -- in effect the benefit of the doubt should

16

be given to the officer and we shouldn't come up with a

17

rule that in effect would penalize the officer.

18

should the benefit of the doubt be given to the officer?

19

Why should the burden of uncertainty, if we're going to

20

draw a line, be a burden that falls on the police rather

21

than -- a burden that falls on the citizen rather than on

22

the police?

23

But why

Why would she make that choice?

MR. GEORGE:

My first response is that probable

24

cause has been the line that's drawn on all crimes in this

25

country since 1791.

And that is -- ought to remain the
34

1

line because it has worked.

2

QUESTION:

I realize that.

But you were making

3

a different argument when you addressed the possibility of

4

drawing the line differently, your response to that was

5

that may be difficult in some cases, and the burden of

6

that difficulty should not fall on the police.

7

question is, assuming a different line were to be drawn,

8

why should the burden fall on the citizen rather than the

9

police? Why shouldn't we simply say, look, if it's going

And my

10

to be -- if there's any question about applying this line,

11

we'll assume that the burden of doubt should be for the

12

benefit of the potential arrestee rather than for the

13

benefit of the police?

14

MR. GEORGE:

The answer is, because the

15

difficulty of articulating all the reasons that would be

16

adequate.

17

Now, we can have a -QUESTION:

But that's the premise

of the

18

question.

We're assuming that the reasons would be hard

19

to articulate.

20

reasonableness grounds to draw such a line, why isn't the

21

answer to the uncertainty of application the answer that

22

was suggested earlier, and that is if the police are not

23

certain in applying this rule, that they have a right to

24

arrest, they should not arrest, and that's the answer to

25

the uncertainty problem.

But assume that we feel there is a need on

35

1

MR. GEORGE:

Truthfully, I see no reason, if

2

you're going to go down the road of trying to carve out

3

some other exception to probable cause, that the burden of

4

proof not remain on the government.

5

is -- on probable cause is that the police officer has to

6

be able to -- there has to be objective facts that would

7

cause probable cause, a specific violation of a specific

8

statute.

9

government.

The burden of proof

The Terry stop, we put the burden on the
If it's burden shifting, if we're going down

10

this road, if this Court should determine that there needs

11

to be a new volume five for the Fourth Amendment

12

jurisprudence and that this is a problem of some moment in

13

the country and needs that remedy, then I can not

14

articulate a reason why we should bury the burden of

15

proof.

16

QUESTION:

There's a point, a procedural point,

17

that I'm curious about, this case was begun by the

18

plaintiffs in the state court, and the police officer,

19

police chief and the city removed it to the Federal court,

20

is there a reason why they did that?

21

MR. GEORGE:

I wasn't trial counsel at that time

22

and I do not know the reason.

23

question about qualified immunity.

24

think there is immunity both for the city and for the

25

individuals here as a matter of law.
36

I agree with your earlier
I don't believe -- I

I grant you that the

1

Fifth Circuit did not address that issue.

this is a largely academic exercise in here and at this

16

the question from the constitutional perspective is

17

whether or not probable cause to believe an arrest under

18

that local law has occurred, and once that is met, then

19

all the other questions become policy judgments that the

20

50 states should decide.

21

QUESTION:

The court has taught us that in

Let me suggest this, again, going

22

back to, as you can guess, I'm rather intrigued with the

23

descending standard.

24

is, if the decision to make a custodial arrest rather than

25

citation is wholly arbitrary, if there's no plausible

Basically the descending standard

37

1

reason or articulable reason can be given for it, then

2

it's arbitrary.

3

arbitrary cannot be reasonable within the meaning of the

4

Fourth Amendment.

5

Now it seems to me that anything is

Now why am I wrong about that?

MR. TAYLOR:

The reason why that premise is

6

incorrect Justice Stevens is this Court's teachings in

7

Gerstein v. Pew and reaffirmed in County of Riverside v.

8

MacLaughlin, once you have probable cause this Court's

9

teachings have been not only can you engage in a full

10

custodial arrest, but likewise you're entitled for a

11

temporary detention for the purpose of administrating the

12

paperwork so that this individual can be booked and then

13

released once a probable cause determination has been made

14

by a magistrate.

15

there must be some second reason based on some mini-trial

16

based on the facts presented as to whether or not that

17

decision of that tree to bring into custody is

18

appropriate.

19

This Court has rejected the notion that

All three options to a police officer are

20

reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.

The first is to

21

issue a warning, whether it be in writing or oral. Second,

22

to actually arrest and bring into custody, or third to

23

issue a citation instead of actually engaging in a full

24

custodial arrest.

25

options are equally reasonable under the floor, the

This Court has taught us that all three

38

1

minimum guidelines and protections that the Fourth

2

Amendment and the federal constitution give, and then it

3

becomes a matter of policy.

4

QUESTION:

But you're saying there is no

5

standard that constrains the officer's decision on whether

6

or not to give a citation as opposed to make a custodial

7

arrest.

8
9

MR. TAYLOR:

There is no constitutional

standard, it is a policy judgment Justice Stevens, and the

10

different states have approached it in different ways.

11

you will note some of the amici here have said that it's

12

appropriate under state law to engage in a full custodial

13

arrest.

14

governmental interest is one that should be given credence

15

by this Court, the state of Texas has spoken in the

16

statute, even though the statute in question, the seat

17

belt offense law does not provide for punishment in the

18

form of jail time.

19

is appropriate to have a full custodial arrest in order to

20

enforce the government's interest in that particular law.

21

Therefore, that jurisdiction has made that policy choice.

22

Those policy choices are subject to political

23

accountability.

24
25

As

Indeed, if arguing whether or not the state

QUESTION:

They have likewise determined that it

That's set forth specifically in the

seat belt law?
39

1

MR. TAYLOR:

The traffic rules of the road is a

2

certain codification of state law that includes seat belt

3

offenses and there is a statute in Texas on the books that

4

says for any offense in this traffic code, full custodial

5

arrest is appropriate, save two exceptions, one is for

6

speeding, and two is for the open container law which were

7

the results of political judgments made in the local

8

jurisdiction.

9

Other states have decided that in certain

10

circumstances they will allow the issuances of citation

11

rather than a full custodial arrest based on the

12

circumstances presented to that officer, and he has that

13

discretion to make that judgment call.

14

wrong in the view of the folks that have to review it

15

later, in other words, we don't think he made the best

16

decision among all of his options, so long as those

17

options are equally reasonable under the Federal

18

Constitution, then that mistake does not drive a

19

constitutional decision of reasonableness because you

20

can't put that in front of the decision. And so, whereas

21

here, the commission of an offense witnessed personally by

22

the police officer gives rise to probable cause then the

23

constitutional inquiry ends and the policy judgments and

24

decisions will begin.

25

But if he picks

And that's why it would be unworkable as this
40

1

Court in several questions has asked whether or not we can

2

draw lines between fine only and jailable time.

3

in Welsh v. Wisconsin, one of those offenses in that case

4

was for DWI, but under that jurisdiction's law it was only

5

for jail -- for a fine.

6

Watson, when dealing with the Prohibition cases, that

7

particular, actually -- Carroll v. United States, that

8

particular case dealt with bootlegging, and that was a

9

misdemeanor fine-only offense.

In fact,

Similarly, in United States v.

You cannot determine the

10

constitutional question based on the penalty that is

11

associated with a crime, but rather based on whether or

12

not there is an offense for the specific facts that have

13

occurred.

14

If we let the penalty -QUESTION:

I suppose that misdemeanor violators,

15

traffic violators, seat belt and all that stuff, french

QUESTION:

3

To my knowledge -When you say he's been dismissed, I

assume that means he's been dismissed from the case.

4

MR. TAYLOR:

I meant the former and not the

5

latter.

But the point is, Justice Scalia, your question

6

demonstrates that these decisions well, under these

7

circumstances what's the best policy choice is just that,

8

a policy choice and not part of the constitutional rubric

9

of the Fourth Amendment. Those extra protections are for

10

the state's to decide.

11

liberty in the Fourth Amendment are for this Court to

12

decide, and I would submit that this Court has made it

13

very clear that the decision must be pledged and looked to

14

in terms of probable cause.

15

QUESTION:

But the minimum guarantees of

Mr. Taylor, do you know why local

16

officials took this case out of the hands of Texas courts

17

and put it in the hands of Federal court?

18

MR. TAYLOR:

I do not, Your Honor, and the

19

record does not indicate why.

20

could simply be that the Federal courts would be

21

well-equipped to know the differences between the Federal

22

constitutional floor and the policy ceiling lights that

23

the states may accord on situations such as this.

24

clearly whereas here probable cause existed, then there

25

was no constitutional infirmity, and this Court has
42

One hypothetical suggestion

But

1

rejected time and time again in Berkimer, and in United

2

States v. Robinson and other cases, that we cannot allow

3

the punishment rather than the conduct to give rise to the

4

constitutional infirmity or lack thereof, because

5

otherwise we're going to have conduct which in one state

6

will result in an unconstitutional situation, and in other

7

state a constitutional one.

8

which differs all fifty jurisdictions.

9

QUESTION:

And we cannot have a rule

Well you have that now on the

10

felony/misdemeanor distinction.

11

states classify them as misdemeanors, some classify

12

certain offenses as felonies.

13

theory, that would make a difference in whether there

14

could be an arrest without a warrant.

15

MR. TAYLOR:

Felonies differ, some

It depends -- on your

Justice Souter, no, the fact that

16

you do not draw a line is why it doesn't matter whether

17

they're felonies or misdemeanors or --

You draw a line on the warrant

QUESTION:

-- you would have to have a

So you've got -- so you've got a

variation from state to state, even under the scheme that
43

1

you would advocate.
MR. TAYLOR:

Well, even where a warrant may be

3

desired this Court has not stated as a matter of Fourth

4

Amendment principles that a warrant is required in all

5

circumstances, Gerstein says an on the scene assessment by

6

a police officer of probable cause is enough under our

7

constitutional interpretations of the Fourth Amendment.

8

And then it would be --

9

QUESTION:

If the officer is not -- the point is

10

that when an arrest is made for an offense that is not

11

committed in the officer's presence, then a warrant is

12

going to be required depending on the gravity of the

13

offense, and I presume that is true under the system that

14

you advocate.

15

MR. TAYLOR:

Yes, in certain circumstances a

16

warrantless arrest would not be appropriate because

17

there's not probable cause.

18

If there's probable cause, then the arrest is appropriate

19

in all circumstances.

20

unanimous Court held that the balancing test of the

21

government and the individual is when a probable cause

22

exists always tipped in the constitutional scale for the

23

government.

24

like warrantless intrusions into homes or serious bodily

25

injure or deadly force do we then have any additional

But that's the touchstone.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. DE CARLI

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR. DE CARLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
What is interesting about this case as some

12

members of this Court have pointed out, is respondents do

13

not defend the reasonableness of the conduct of the

14

officer in question here, instead they attack the

15

workability of potential rules and raise -- and allege

16

that this is not a recurring problem. Two points -- well,

17

a third point also they characterize decisions of this

18

Court far beyond their holdings.

19

reoccurrence problem, since certiorari has been taken by

20

this case and I know this is anecdotal, we have received

21

call after call of problems of this sort and to limit it

22

to publically reported incidents, just within the past

23

month, before this argument, a DPS officer arrested a

24

passenger in a vehicle, the passenger was a 17-year-old

25

boy with his mother, and that boy then -- the officer

some members of the Court have suggested is just as

interests or any of the rules proposed by petitioners

leads to the fact that again they have offered no

explanation for why this arrest furthered any legitimate

law enforcement interest.
