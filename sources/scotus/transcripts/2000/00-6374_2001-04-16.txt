We'll hear argument

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SUTTON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
There are two arguments that I would like to

11

press this morning.

12

appeal will never be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction

13

solely because it lacks a signature.

14

alternative argument, and that's that a typewritten

15

signature would suffice to meet any such requirement.

16

The first is that a timely notice of

The second is an

Let me start with the sixth circuit's review of

17

this particular case.

In their view, there is a

18

jurisdictional signature requirement in light of the

19

thirty-day rule under Appellate Rule 4, and in light of

20

Civil Rule 11, which indeed does contain a signature

21

requirement.

22

reliance on Civil Rule 11 is that it not only contains a

23

signature requirement, but it also contains a remedy for

24

the absence of a signature.

25

everyone agrees -- the court-appointed amicus curiae

The problem with the sixth circuit's

included -- that Mr. Becker was never given an opportunity

2

to correct this omission of a signature, whether at the

3

district court or the court of appeals level.

QUESTION:

I should know this -- when you file a

notice of appeal, do you file with the district court?

6

MR. SUTTON:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. SUTTON:

9

You do, Your Honor.
So Rule 11 applies at that point?
It does technically.

In fact,

Appellate Rule 1 arguably acknowledges that when it says

10

all filings in a district court -- all filings in the

11

courts of appeals that have been made through district

12

courts have to comply with district court rules.

13

does seem, as odd as it would appear, that Civil Rule 11

14

does apply to a notice of appeal, keeping in mind that

15

Civil Rule 11 is pretty broad in nature.

pleadings and quote other papers.

17

include a notice of appeal.

So it

It says

If I were on the court of appeals and

I thought that Rule 11 requires a signature --

noted, make clear that you do have to comply with the

2

district court rules and the Rules of Civil Procedure.

3

In light of Appellate Rule 1, a court of appeals

or a court of appeals clerk's office would be fully within

its rights to contact in this case Mr. Becker, saying, Mr.

Becker, we see you've typed your signature.

but why doesn't the remedy have to have been applied

14

within the thirty-day time limit?

15

I mean, that's the problem.

MR. SUTTON:

You do have a remedy,

Your Honor, the only thing that has

16

to be done within thirty days is to make sure you've

17

established an intent to appeal.

18

intent to appeal as this Court is --

QUESTION:

You can establish an

Does it say that -- it says you have

20

to establish an intent to appeal within thirty days?

notice of appeal which includes a signature, which I take

23

to mean a written signature in normal parts.

language, I think.

10

MR. SUTTON:

Well, I may be referring to the

11

wrong Smith decision.

Your Honor, which is a 9-0 decision in which the Court

said that a merits brief would suffice to establish a --

missed the time for filing the notice of appeal because

they weren't sure when -- they hadn't -- weren't sure when

answer to Justice Kennedy about Rule 11 -- isn't the

2

answer on the other side that once you file the notice of

3

appeal, authority over the case passes from the district

4

court to the court of appeals, so at that point, up until

5

the notice of appeal, you're in the district court.

6

you file that notice, you are in the court of appeals and

7

Rule 11 is a rule directed to district court and not the

8

court of appeals. So the cure that Rule 11 provides, at

9

least so the argument goes, would not be available in the

10

Once

court of appeals.

11

MR. SUTTON:

And Your Honor, that is why I was

12

relying on Appellate Rule 1 which incorporates those

13

rules, and that would therefore give appellate courts

14

authority to make sure that someone did correct the

15

signature.

16

if you're not going to correct it -- you're going to be

17

unrepentant when it comes to this particular requirement,

18

at that point we are going to dismiss your appeal, and in

19

fact will do so on the merits.

20

QUESTION:

If they wanted at that point to decide, well,

Of course, I suppose if you haven't

21

filed a proper notice of appeal, you're still in the

22

district court.

23

that if indeed a signature is required and you file it

24

without a signature in the court of appeals, it is

25

ineffective and so the case remains in the district court.

I mean, you could argue it the other way

MR. SUTTON:

What the court has said and what

2

the rules reflect is that as soon as the district court

3

clerk receives the notice of appeal, it doesn't say

4

anything about validity, it is immediately sent to the

5

court of appeals. And I think -- but I think that does

6

raise a second answer to Mr. Baker's argument -- the point

7

Justice Ginsburg is getting at, it is true that to find a

8

notice of appeal immediately vests jurisdiction in the

9

court of appeals over the merits of the case, but that

10

doesn't preclude district courts from acting on collateral

11

matters; that's when they can act on stay motions, bond

12

motions, attorney fee motions. This arguably could be such

13

a collateral act.

14

case.

15

problem here, and that would be interpretation.

16

district courts would have authority to enforce this as a

17

jurisdictional rule, and you would have district court

18

judges dismissing appeals of their own cases.

19

problematic, and I think kind --

20

It wouldn't go to the merits of the

MR. SUTTON:

could answer this question, it may be helpful to be

looking at the rules.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. SUTTON:

Okay.
And Justice O'Connor correctly is

13

pointing to what I think is the best argument that has

14

been made -- the amicus curiae argument -- and that's

15

Appellate Rule 3(C)(2) which does refer to the word

16

signer, and it does come out of nowhere -- that there is

17

nothing else in the Appellate Rules that refers to the

18

verbs sign, or the noun sign, or a signature, and suddenly

19

in 1993 they do this.

20

Well, I guess one quick question is if Mr.

21

Baker's interpretation is correct, how in the world would

22

you enforce it?

Indeed, the only way to enforce it would have

the clerk do what I think they should be doing in these

cases, which is picking up the phone and calling and

saying you need to be signing, you need to include that

appellant.

12

Of course if the question under Mr. Baker's rule

13

was the clerk now calls and says are you represented,

14

well, there is a good answer and a bad answer to that

question.

Jurisdiction vested, you didn't have to sign, and if you

MR. SUTTON:

has to say --

But no lawyer signed anything. You

are assuming that there would be appeals in which the

5

lawyer signed them -- filed them without ever signing

6

anything.

7

MR. SUTTON:

Exactly, which does happen.

Some

8

of the lower court cases are cases where even the attorney

didn't sign -- in other words, you don't have to be a pro

I mean, you're saying -MR. SUTTON:

2

dissolves or where the jurisdiction is, as I read this,

3

and tell me if this is correct or not, whether it supports

4

you or not, I want to know if it is right.

5

As I read it, if your notice complies with all

6

the conditions of Rule 4, it is valid.

7

does it say that you actually have to sign.

8

you don't sign it?

9

So suppose

It's still valid.

MR. SUTTON:

10

Nowhere in that

Right.
It still does everything the thing

11

does, but under Rule 11 if you didn't sign it, it could be

stricken.

13

specifically what you do.

14

therefore the valid notice would be stricken if somebody

15

discovers it wasn't signed. But before you strike it, you

The argument that Rule 11 is out of

that rule is directed to district courts and not court of

MR. SUTTON:

idea what happened.

All I know is that it took seven

2

months for the appeal to be dismissed.

3

to believe this went to the section of the sixth circuits

4

that handles those types of appeals.

So that leads me

5

Someone, at least partly correctly, realized

6

their Mattingly Rule, saw that you had the typewritten

7

signature, and I guess in an act of, you know, precision,

8

at least in their view, thought that didn't count, but

9

didn't give Mr. Becker an opportunity to argue otherwise

10

that, you know, his typewritten signature would suffice

11

or, for that matter, to make the point you should never

12

apply this multiple party rule on the contest of a single

13

appellant who's put his name on the notice of appeal three

14

times.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Sutton -- oh, excuse me.

You

16

mentioned the multiple appellants, and that was the

problem of one person filing a notice of appeal, putting

18

down a lot of other names, and you didn't know whether the

19

other names really wanted to appeal. How is that situation

20

handled today?

21

MR. SUTTON:

Well, this is division that really

22

-- that did exist in the lower courts.

There was not a

division on the single appellant problem -- they've all

ruled our way.

nonjurisdictional and they say they just simply ask

2

someone to correct it and clarify whether all three

3

appellants meant to appeal, even though only one of them

4

hand-signed the notice.

5

And others say, no, that's jurisdictional. They

6

look at this Court's decision in Torres and say you've got

7

to establish within the four corners of the document

8

within thirty days a, quote, intent to appeal.

9

the seventh circuit view is the better view.

10

I think

I mean, this is a minimalistic requirement.

In

11

fact, it all comes from a statute.

12

allowed under Rule 1 to expand or shrink the courts of

appeals' jurisdictions; the only statutory requirement is

argument when it comes to interpreting the Congressional

that that assumption has to include the handwritten

that there is any difference between single or multiple

QUESTION:

They've done so in

The fact that they're

Mr. Baker, are there not courts where

something like this would come into the clerk's office,

the signature is lacking, the clerk would say, well, it

with the letter, very much as this Court does.

something is filed in this Court -- a cert petition and it

is deficient but it is on time -- our clerk will send it

that is that Rule 4 sets a thirty-day limit on filing of

should that be jurisdictional and not correctable later?

MR. BAKER:

The signature requirement is part of

5

expressing the intent of the party to appeal.

6

since 1980, the courts of appeals have said that specify

7

the party or parties taking the appeal includes in a pro

the appeal.

10
11

It's --

Even in a single --

QUESTION:

Well, there is no clear statutory

rule requirement that it be signed.

12

MR. BAKER:

I think that Rule 11 clearly

13

requires that it be signed.

14

at least as far as the form of the filing, into the

15

Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.

clearly references an expectation that there will be a

6

here is he wasn't given a chance to sign it.

7

MR. BAKER:

I take it the problem

Well, the difficulty with taking

8

that approach is first that Rule 11 is a district court

9

rule; it sets form requirements and it tells the court

10

what it can do in response to an unsigned notice of

appeal.

not the authority to take action -- it would be very --

MR. BAKER:

Well, the legislative history for

that says that in some instances the Federal Rules of

that if there is a form and manner requirement, you must

10

QUESTION:

Well, isn't -- isn't it authority

that goes to the satisfaction of a form and manner
requirement?

11

Sure it is.

MR. BAKER:

Well, it says -- but the requirement

12

is that it be signed.

13

it be signed if you've gotten a notice from the court.

14

simply says it must be signed; it shall be stricken unless

15

certain -- certain things have happened.

16

QUESTION:

I think the requirement is not that
It

Those --

It says it must be signed, and if it

isn't signed, you have to sign it if you get a notice from

the court.

19

That's what it --

20

And if you don't do that, we strike it.

MR. BAKER:

If -- if we were only borrowing Rule

21

11 here, I think this argument would be much stronger, but

22

we -- the Advisory Committee has gone over this territory

23

already, the courts of appeals, as I said, since 1980 have

24

found that the jurisdictional language of Rule 3 includes

Advisory Committee, which addressed this question after

3

Torres made it quite clear that specify the parties is a

4

jurisdictional requirement, had in front of them language

that would have gotten rid of the signature requirement,

and instead modified that language to make it clear that a

signature was expected from every pro se party filing a

notice of appeal.

QUESTION:

And the

Well, again, that's -- that's not --

that's really not clear.

I mean the one thing that rule

11

-- that thing does is to say that the widow or the wife

12

and the child can come along without signing it, I mean,

13

we know that when they made that change in Rule 3, what

14

they wanted to do is enable people to be parties who

15

hadn't signed, and then to say, well, now, that instituted

16

for the first time a -- a statement in the Rules that the

17

pro se litigant must sign is kind of a backdoor way to

18

create a signing requirement.

MR. BAKER:

20

perfect, Your Honor.

21

reading it as only saying that the signature requirement

22

for the spouse and children which would be the result of

23

saying, well, this -- this says there's a signature

requirement of the spouse and child but it's met by the

25

signature of the pro se party.

It's -- it's -- it's obviously not
On the other hand, I have difficulty

the pro se party and the pro se party's family members all

the same.

4

They are -QUESTION:

It may be it had in mind Torres and

5

the problem of the person other than the one who files the

notice, adding names.

7

that problem of the multi-party of appeal is what prompted

-- prompted the change in the Rule.

9

MR. BAKER:

So that I think that the -- that

I think that that's -- that's

10

plausible if it were not for the fact that the Advisory

11

Committee had in front of it language that would have

12

achieved that without introducing a signature requirement

13

or any notion of a signature requirement provided by

14

public citizens.

15

citizens would have clearly undone the signature

16

requirements that had been imposed by some of the courts

17

of appeals.

18

The -- the language provided by public

QUESTION:

Maybe they thought the signature

19

requirement was there but non-jurisdictional.

20

take a look at Rule 1 -- it says when these rules provide

21

for filing a document in the district court, the procedure

22

must comply with the practice of the district court.

23

it seems to me that if you file a -- perhaps a Rule

24

piece of it.

I mean,

So

1

MR. BAKER:

That may well be, I -- but I think

2

that it's -- it's impossible to pick up that Rule -- the

3

-- the -- the Civil Rule of Procedure -- without taking

4

into account Rule 4 which says the Notice of Appeal has to

5

be filed within thirty days.

6
7

There is clearly a signature requirement under
Rule 11; there is no doubt about that.

10

QUESTION:

Why doesn't that mean that defects

can be cured after the thirty days, just as it does in
this Court?

11

MR. BAKER:

I think the reason that it can't be

12

is that the signature requirement has been pulled into

13

Rule 3 for pro se parties by the direct reference to an

14

expectation that the pro se party will sign the notice of

15

appeal.

16

to the conclusion that there is something about the notice

17

of appeal, and the standards for notice of appeal, that is

18

--that requires a signature from pro se parties, and there

19

are good, obviously policy, reasons for wanting to do

20

that.

21

It is hard to read that language without coming

QUESTION:

So then you are making the

22

distinction that -- that Mr. Sutton suggested you were --

23

that this is a requirement -- the signing requirement --

24

this jurisdictional signing requirement applies only to

25

pro se litigants and not to litigants with counsel.

1

MR. BAKER:

I think though that the principal

2

problem that the signature requirement addresses is the

3

risk that someone is practicing law -- probably without a

4

license -- on behalf of a party who may or may not

5

understand what is being done in his name.

6

requirement allows the court to be sure that the party who

7

is nominally appearing pro se in fact has had a chance to

8

think about what he is doing, and to examine the contents

9

of what has been filed in his name.

The signature

That is the reason

10

that in multiple appellant cases -- this rule has been

11

applied without controversy, yet because it is obvious

12

there that one party may be proceeding to draft pleadings

13

that the others may not have seen. But in the context of

14

single appellants as well, there are numerous areas of law

15

where there is an active cottage industry of assisting pro

16

se litigants -- not just prison cases but bankruptcy

17

cases, immigration cases, where people who hold themselves

18

out as grievance consultants or other forms of quasi-

19

lawyer, have taken to filing pro se papers on behalf of

20

parties.

21

The signature requirement at least requires that

22

those pro se parties have a chance to see what has been

23

done in their names.

24
25

QUESTION:

But you agree that it's -- that it's

not jurisdictional with regard to -- to an attorney?

1

MR. BAKER:

I -- I do agree with that.

I think

2

that if one reads this as narrowly as possible, that the

3

signature requirement does not apply to represented

4

parties.

It applies, but the attorney --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. BAKER:

Under the jurisdictional -Right.

And -- and there are reasons

7

for that.

If an attorney says I represent these parties

8

and they're taking the appeal and he's not telling the

9

truth, he's subject to a wide variety of sanctions that

10

would not apply to a non-lawyer who made that same

11

representation and therefore, it's a -- it's a plausible

12

distinction to -- to draw.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Baker, one of the problems since

14

we're dealing with a pro se litigant, gets this form from

15

the Sixth Circuit, and it doesn't say, as the -- the

16

sample attached to the Rules do, S with a signature.

17

then he gets a document from a court that doesn't even

18

warn him that a signature is required, and then he's out

19

the door because he -- he did everything that the -- that

20

the document he got from the court called for.

21

MR. BAKER:

So

I -- I -- think that's a difficulty.

22

I -- I would suggest -- I don't know how Mr. Becker got

23

that form.

24

at the yellow brief pages of A-2 and A-3 because, in fact,

25

the form that Mr. Becker got is outdated even by the sixth

I -- I think it would be useful to take a look

circuit standards.

2

website, you go to the notices and download the forms, the

3

form you will get is the form on page A-3 of the yellow

4

brief, not on page A-2 which is the form that Mr. Becker

5

submitted.

6

If you go to the sixth circuit

Indeed, if you look at the -- at the lower

7

lefthand corner of each of those documents, you'll see

8

that each of them is labeled 6CA3, which is the name of

9

the -- the number of the form.

Each of them in fact on

10

the originals has a GPO designation, but the notice on

11

page A-3 is dated January '99 as opposed to August of '79,

12

and this is the pages -- the form on page A-3 is the form

13

that is available to litigants, and that should be sent

14

out, and it certainly calls for a signature, has the

15

little s.

16

So there may well have been a mistake here in

17

Mr. Becker's case, but I think it would be going beyond

18

the facts that we have in the record to assume that this

19

is a policy on the part of the Sixth Circuit to send out a

20

notice of appeal when it's not --

2

signed practically every paper he's filed in practically

3

every one of those cases, including all of his notices of

4

appeal to the Sixth Circuit in past cases.

5

6

think it would be aggressive for him to suggest that

7

simply because the s was missing from this form, he

8

doesn't have to pay any attention to those -- those rules.

9

QUESTION:

Rule 11 says

Well, again it's not a question of

10

not paying attention; it's a question of whether it can be

11

cured, whether we know that the thirty days can't be cured

12

once that runs, but the -- the question is whether

13

something like the signature shouldn't be curable, when

14

everything is there, his name is -- is in the caption, his

15

name is in the body of the notice.

16

MR. BAKER:

But when one has that one is

17

confronted with a notice of appeal, as is the typical case

18

-- and here we've had a half a dozen substantive motions

19

and briefs, and so we're starting to get a feel for Mr.

20

Becker and what his intent was -- but the purpose of the

21

requirement is to know immediately, and in a way that's

22

not easily deniable by the appellant -- what his intent

23

is, that he actually intends to file this appeal and be

24

bound by the consequences, even if they're bad, as they

25

may well be for a frivolous appeal.

1

If I could touch briefly on the question of

2

whether the Rules Enabling Act prevents the application of

3

this rule, I think it is answered by the Torres case which

4

said, after all, that even though it was perfectly obvious

5

in that case that all of the plaintiffs who had lost

6

intended to seek the appeal, the fact that one of the

7

plaintiffs' names had been left off of the document meant

8

that there was no notice of appeal as to him, and that the

9

requirements of the parties be specified with a

10

jurisdictional requirement.

I don't think the Rules

11

Enabling Act said, wait a minute, you're narrowing the

12

scope of the notice of appeal.

13

QUESTION:

But there was a total absence of the

14

name any place, and I think

15

Mr. Baker, you are asking us to equate the lack of a

16

signature with the total absence of the name of the would-

17

be appellant any place in the notice.

18

MR. BAKER:

-- if I understand you right,

Yes, I am, because that was the

19

position since at lease 1980 of some of the courts of

20

appeals and the position that we believe was adopted by

21

the Advisory Committee in 1993.

22
23

QUESTION:

It is one thing to say, look, you --

you weren't even named any place in this notice within

4

MR. BAKER:

That we can let you do

Of course, one could draw the

5

distinction -- I'm not sure that the Rules Enabling Act

6

would say that that distinction is the -- is the limit of

7

what the Court's authority is.

8

authority to say we want you to specify the party -- the

party taking the appeal in a manner that leaves the party

I think the Court has the

no room to back out later.
QUESTION:

Have the courts of appeals which you

say have applied this Rule since 1980, have they applied

it only to pro se filings, or do they apply it to --

to pro se pleadings.

QUESTION:

The cases that I have seen apply it
I have not seen it applied

Mr. Baker, let me just ask you, one

18

of the tough things about your -- your position, of

19

course, is this contrast between the pro se litigant and

20

the represented litigant, and your response, in part, is

21

that while there are disciplinary sanctions on the lawyer

22

who doesn't -- who actually fails to sign and so forth,

23

but does that -- is that really a complete response

24

because isn't there still the danger that a representative

25

-- a represented appellant might have some friend who,

without authority, went ahead and filed a notice of appeal

2

without even the lawyer knowing about it.

3

MR. BAKER:

Well, if he -- if he did then it

4

wouldn't have the lawyer's signature on it. It would have

5

someone else's signature on it.

6

QUESTION:

Well, but I thought -- I thought you

7

were saying even if the lawyer had not signed it, it would

8

not be jurisdictional.

9
10

MR. BAKER:

Even if the lawyer had -- if he was

a represented party, he filed pro se?

11

QUESTION:

No, a represented -- my hypothetical

12

is a represented party on whose behalf a typewritten

13

notice of appeal is filed without the knowledge of either

14

the lawyer who represents him or the man himself -- the

15

man or woman himself.

16

is it?

17

MR. BAKER:

That's not a jurisdictional defect,

I would say it was because it

18

doesn't have a signature from the pro se party, and it's

19

not -- you haven't specified the party's intent to --

20

QUESTION:

Well, then there isn't this

21

distinction between representative and non-representative

22

parties.

MR. BAKER:

it in terms of a represented party where the lawyer is

actually pursuing the appeal.

1

QUESTION:

But am I correct then -- maybe I

2

don't have the facts right in my mind. Assume a

3

represented party who has a lawyer -- a paper is filed

4

which purports to be a notice of appeal on behalf of that

5

person and not signed by anybody. Is that a jurisdictional

6

defect or is it not?

7

MR. BAKER:

It may not be a jurisdictional

8

defect, but it is obviously easily struck because it

9

doesn't represent the intent of the party.

If it -- if it

10

purports to be a pro se petition, notice of appeal, then

11

it's jurisdictionally deficient.

12

an attorney notice of appeal, then it's fraught.

QUESTION:

If it purports to be on

Even though, in fact, it was not

prepared by the attorney?

15

MR. BAKER:

Yes.

16

QUESTION:

Okay.

17

I would like to take just a minute on the

18

question of the -- whether a typed name can constitute a

19

signature. I think that's been addressed at considerable

20

length already.

21

raising it at this stage, is there is a question whether

22

this is fairly covered by the question presented, but the

23

Court drafted a question presented that presumes there has

24

been a failure to sign here.

25

petitioner had filed a petition that made reference to

My first point, and I apologize for

It did so after the

1

some of the cases that address the question whether a

2

signed notice of appeal could be -- whether a signing

3

constituted typing.

4

the Court in framing this question didn't exclude this

5

issue or --

6
7

QUESTION:

You're saying we've proceeded on the

assumption that there was a failure to sign.

8
9

So there is a real question whether

MR. BAKER:

Exactly, and therefore either you've

already decided this, which I suspect is not the

10

appropriate answer, or it's not part of the case because

11

there was no conflict in the circuits on that question.

12

If I could turn also to the question of a lawyer

13

not signing -- I think Mr. Sutton made the argument that

14

an attorney -- if you were a represented party and you did

15

not sign, it would not be jurisdictional.

16

non-represented party and you did not sign, it would be

17

jurisdictional, and that there would be some doubt about

18

that possibility raised the prospect, I think, of people

19

trying to game the system by rushing out and hiring

20

lawyers or having lawyers submit things that weren't

21

signed.

22

If you were a

I think it's worth remembering this is not a

23

difficult requirement to meet.

Signing the notice of

24

appeal is an easy thing to do; it provides useful

25

confirmation to the court that every party who is part of

the notice of appeal actually has seen and has willingly

2

joined in it.

3

this system in order to avoid signing the notice of appeal

4

I think is -- is highly unlikely.

5

And so the likelihood that people will game

QUESTION:

Mr. Baker, is there anything in your

6

view that is quote jurisdictional, other than the one

7

thing we all agree, is the thirty days is jurisdictional.

8

Now you say the signing requirement, at least to a pro se

9

litigant, is.

Is there anything else that you would rank

10

as jurisdictional so you would be disqualified as an

11

appellant?

12

MR. BAKER:

This Court has -- has tended to say

13

that Rule 3 is jurisdictional in general terms.

Certainly

14

I would say that Rule 3(c) and its provisions which say

15

that you must specify the party or parties taking the

16

appeal -- that's what the Torres case held, that failure

17

to specify is a jurisdictional fault, designation of the

18

judgment appealed from, designation of the court appealed

19

to.

20

specify the party included a signature requirement as part

21

of determining intent to appeal.

And as I said, most -- many courts had held that to

None of those things can be cured

I know that the Torres establishes

that errors in designating the, the details, are

MR. BAKER:

The -- the court in Smith against

12

Barry, and to a degree in Torres, suggested that the

13

functional equivalent of a notice of appeal is all that is

14

required, but by functional equivalent the -- the Court

15

has essentially treated the three elements that must be in

notice -- who is appealing, what he's appealing, and who

MR. BAKER:

I -- I -- I would -- I would argue

4

that in fact when the Advisory Committee -- the only

5

substantive revision of Rule 3(c) that's been made was

6

made in 1993 by the Advisory Committee.

7

that change, there was none of this division into sub --

8

separate subparagraphs of 3(C).

9

to do the three things -- to specify the three things.

When they made

There was a requirement

10

The first was specify the parties, and what the Advisory

11

Committee did was insert this reference to a signature by

12

a pro se party directly after the requirement that the

13

party taking the appeal be specified, and I think the only

14

conclusion you can draw from that is they believed that

15

they were providing a gloss on how to specify the party or

16

parties taking the appeal.

And yet there's not one word from the

to clarify what it meant to specify the party so people

2

wouldn't make mistakes in the future.

3

If I could make one point in closing, it's that

4

I was struck as I was reading the cases that we've been

5

talking about here, such as Torres, the Foman case from

6

the '60s, Houston and Flack -- all of the cases that

7

construe the rules of the court -- of the appellate courts

8

-- that almost none of them have survived in terms of

Almost every one has been modified by the

Advisory Committee and the rules process.
Given the number of problems we've turned up in

12

this area, I think that it's inevitable that this issue is

13

bound for the Advisory Committee one way or the other, and

14

yet we still cite all those cases, and we cite them not

15

for their particular holding, but for the way they

16

analyzed these problems.

17

rules can be bent to achieve a certain aim, then that's

18

what they stand for.

19

in as straightforward and lawyerly a way as one can and

20

take the consequences, then that's what those rules --

21

those cases stand for.

the latter course, the Sixth Circuit should be affirmed.

Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. SUTTON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. SUTTON:

A few brief points.

the form that's now attached to the Sixth Circuit rules.

It is attached to their current

Second, the notion that prison inmates should be

10

consulting websites to get the forms doesn't seem to me

11

plausible.

12

Third, when it comes to the forms that Mr. Baker

13

has relied upon, if you look at our yellow brief, there is

14

a great irony here to his argument that this signature

15

rule only applies to pro se appellants.

16

forms refers to signatures for attorneys.

17

the one that's attached to the Federal Rules -- that's at

18

A-1 -- it's clear the signature requirement is not for the

19

pro se -- it says the s and then attorney. And then you

20

look at Mr Becker's -- Baker's -- Becker's form, it's

Every other point that Mr. Baker has raised --
