CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear

argument on No. 99-1030, the City of Indianapolis

5

versus James Edmond.

6

Mr. Chinn.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. SCOTT CHINN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. CHINN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The City of Indianapolis operates roadway

12

checkpoints comprised of conduct that in other relevant

13

contexts this Court has approved.

14

The Court of Appeals declined to apply this

15

Court's Brown versus Texas balancing test to evaluate

16

that conduct because the checkpoints primarily

17

investigate crimes, but the city's checkpoints are

18

constitutional for two independent reasons.

19

this Court used the balancing test in upholding other

20

roadway checkpoints where the government's interests

21

was to investigate crimes.

22

checkpoints serve sobriety checking and driving

23

regulation interests that this Court has approved and

24

the city's drug checking conduct adds no additional

25

intrusion to these procedures.

First,

Second, the city's

The roadway checkpoints

3

1

this Court has previously upheld --

2

QUESTION:

I have just one question about

3

that.

I guess on the checkpoints to check for drunk

4

drivers, that's at least related to the condition of

5

the driver of the car, and the Court applied a

6

balancing test and upheld it.

7

Now, is this search more to find drugs being

8

transported in vehicles or is it looking for drivers

9

who are impaired by drug use?

10

MR. CHINN:

It's to do both, Your Honor, but

11

primarily to look for drug possession and trafficking

12

in cars.

13

QUESTION:

What do the statistics show or do

14

they show about the percentage of people that were

15

arrested that were using drugs and were therefore

16

driving under the influence of drugs?

17

statistics show us that?

18

MR. CHINN:

Do the

Not in this case.

On this

19

record there is no evidence that any driver was

20

arrested because he or she was under the influence of

21

drugs or alcohol.

22

of the drivers stopped possessed some sort of

23

narcotics.

24
25

Our statistics show that 4.7 percent

QUESTION:

But does that make this akin to a

checkpoint, for instance, to catch burglars in an area

4

1

or a murderer or something of that kind?

2

for typical law enforcement purposes?

3

affect the balance in some way?

4

MR. CHINN:

Is this more

And does that

No, Your Honor, I think it's

5

different than the hypotheticals that you described for

6

this important reason.

7

smuggling drugs in cars, of course, and the roadway

8

itself is close.

9

our high hit rate in Indianapolis.

The relationship between

We have found that, obviously, with
Carrying drugs in

10

cars is important to foster the drug trade in our

11

neighborhoods, both in terms of possession amounts and

12

smuggling amounts, traffic amounts.

13

which the drugs can be concealed and moved about very

14

easily and enter our neighborhoods is a problem.

15

QUESTION:

The ease with

Well, if there were a high crime

16

area with lots of thefts and burglaries and it was

17

believed that the burglars typically made their getaway

18

in cars, is it appropriate to have roadblocks and check

19

people for that purpose?

20

MR. CHINN:

It might be, Your Honor, if that

21

connection was shown.

If there was a significant

22

connection shown by the government in that case between

23

that rash of burglaries or whatever the crime may be

24

and the use of the roadway, that would be perhaps

25

available.

5

1

QUESTION:

Well, there's always such a

2

connection.

3

I mean, you're saying yes, then.

4

question yes.

5

I know very few burglars that go on foot.

MR. CHINN:

You're answering the

Well, certainly if you have a

6

lot of crime in the neighborhood --

7

QUESTION:

8
9

You can stop all cars to see if

they have burglary tools?
MR. CHINN:

Probably not, Your Honor.

10

Certainly a substantial connection can be shown in this

11

case and was shown in Martinez-Fuerte, for example.

12

The Court can easily set the bar at that substantial

13

connection or significant connection that would

14

differentiate between stopping cars for general

15

criminal violations.

16

QUESTION:

Why is the connection between

17

burglars, who usually get where they're going by car,

18

not as close as the connection with drug traffickers,

19

who usually engage in their business by car?

20

everybody almost usually does everything by car.

21

seems to me I don't see anything special about this.

22

MR. CHINN:

I mean,
It

It's special, Your Honor,

23

because here the car is used as an instrumentality to

24

secret away the drugs that are then either -- have been

25

just purchased in a neighborhood or may be on their way

6

1

to a neighborhood for sale.

2

QUESTION:

Does the record -- does the

3

record tell us how many of these drug arrests involved

4

persons who were selling drugs as opposed to those who

5

might have just been using them themselves?

6

MR. CHINN:

It doesn't tell us specifically,

7

Your Honor.

What the record does tell us is that in

8

the very first checkpoint that Indianapolis set up

9

there was a sizable distribution amount that was seized

10

in the checkpoint, but our checkpoints are designed to

11

both attack the supply and demand.

12

important to attack possession amounts as well.

13

QUESTION:

We think it's

Would your case be as strong if

14

the record showed that every one of the persons stopped

15

just happened to be a casual user or something and then

16

had some drugs left in the car?

17
18
19

MR. CHINN:

Our case would be as strong for

two reasons.
QUESTION:

You don't really -- you don't

20

really have to rely on the fact that some of them may

21

be selling drugs?

22

MR. CHINN:

That's correct.

It tells you

23

something about our program, but it -- but it need --

24

we need not have --

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Chinn, I think you answered

7

1

to an earlier question that the dominant reason for

2

this program is to catch people who distribute, unlike

3

the alcohol stops, the sobriety checks, that the

4

dominant purpose is not to catch dangerous drivers, and

5

you have no record of distinguishing between those two,

6

so we have to assume -- well, you have been candid

7

about it.

8

distributing drugs.

9

Your purpose is to catch people who are
Is that not so?

MR. CHINN:

Distributing -- to smuggle

10

drugs.

People who smuggle drugs, either for

11

distribution or possession.

12

QUESTION:

Well, I don't --

13

QUESTION:

Is that the only purpose?

14

MR. CHINN:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. CHINN:

17

interests that are being served here.

18

distribution interest is primary, and we conceded that,

19

but we also, and the record shows this indisputably,

20

check for signs of impairment.

21

catching drivers who are under the influence of drugs

22

or alcohol.

23

registrations at each checkpoint.

24

first thing that the officers do at the checkpoints,

25

and we had a measurable, a sizable hit rate for driving

For these checkpoints?
Yeah.
Our -- our -- no.

We have three

The drug

So we are interested in

And thirdly, we check drivers' license and
In fact, that's the

8

1

violations as well.

2

narcotics hit rate, and both were higher than this

3

Court sustained in Sitz.

4

It was essentially equal to our

QUESTION:

I suppose given the fact that you

5

don't have a record with respect to finding actual

6

impairment among the people that you stop, I suppose

7

that if we sustain the search here, we would be

8

required to do the same thing if you made a facial

9

showing that in a given neighborhood drug distribution

10

was done on foot.

11

pedestrians again on a sort of a random basis according

12

to some set of criteria like this and question every

13

pedestrian.

14

I suppose you would be able to stop

MR. CHINN:

Pedestrian stops present a

15

different case, Your Honor, for several reasons.

16

this Court certainly hasn't applied, for example, the

17

Brown balancing test to --

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. CHINN:

One,

Why not?
Well, I believe because the

20

degree of intrusion and one's expectation of privacy in

21

the pedestrian context is simply higher or different

22

than in the motorist context.

23

QUESTION:

Well, the reason that it is is

24

that -- that we -- we have, if not a history, at least

25

some experience with -- with motorist checkpoints, but

9

1

there was a day when we didn't.

2

somewhere, and I don't know why the same reasoning

3

couldn't be applied to pedestrians and start somewhere

4

there, and after a while we'd have a tradition of

5

stopping pedestrians on the street, too.

6

MR. CHINN:

It had to start

Well, the Court certainly has

7

recognized for some time, for 75 years perhaps since

8

Carroll, that motorists enjoy a diminished expectation

9

of privacy.

10

QUESTION:

Yeah, but the original rationale

11

for that was that because the person was in a car, the

12

person could get away easily, and yet that rationale

13

has nothing to do with the rationale that -- that

14

you're advancing here to justify this stop.

15

your rationale for stopping cars is that people use

16

cars to distribute drugs, and my suggestion is that in

17

a given area if people distribute drugs on foot, the

18

same rationale that would justify what you're doing

19

here would justify pedestrian stops, and the original

20

Carroll justification for an automobile exception

21

so-called doesn't have anything to do with either case.

22

MR. CHINN:

Your --

Again, I think there are some

23

differences, Your Honor, between the pedestrian context

24

and the motorist context.

25

expectation of freedom of movement, of liberty interest

Certainly there is that

10

1

that is different between cars and pedestrians.

2

Pedestrians are much less regulated certainly than

3

cars, much less used to the government telling them

4

that they have to stop.

5

own will and proceed down the street and window shop in

6

a way that cars cannot certainly.

7

traveling at speeds dictated by the government in a

8

direction that's dictated by the government, cannot

9

change lanes unless they do it in a way that the

10

Pedestrians can stop at their

Cars have to be

government has told them they can. So --

11

QUESTION:

I thought the rationale with the

12

car was a lesser expectation of privacy in a car, say,

13

as opposed to a home, but if you're going to do

14

expectation of privacy, one can't be seen, I suppose

15

the street would be lowest because the car, at least

16

you are sheltered by the car itself.

17

there you are.

18

that you're offering, I think, would apply at least as

19

much.

20

that people are going to get away so that the police

21

are there to check them, and is there a distinction

22

based on the expectation of privacy?

23

but perhaps you can explain it to me.

24
25

On the street

Everybody can see you, so the rationale

A high crime area, you have reason to suspect

MR. CHINN:

I don't see it,

I think in this case the

expectation is a freedom of movement because here no

11

1

searches are undertaken without probable cause, so

2

really what we're talking about in this case and all

3

respondents have ever challenged about this case is the

4

initial stop of the car.

5

because people in cars, motorists are used to being

6

stopped, even at the behest of the government for any

7

number of different reasons.

8

that makes these checkpoints in this case the same as

9

the checkpoints that the Court has upheld in Martinez

So the point is merely that

It's that expectation

10

Fuerte and Sitz reasonable under the circumstances.

11

That's simply different than the pedestrian context.

12

QUESTION:

I've never heard the concept of

13

expectation of privacy which has been applied to -- to

14

searches applied to seizures, which is what you're now

15

saying.

16

expectation of not being seized, right?

17
18
19

You're saying there's no reasonable

MR. CHINN:

I think that's right, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Do you know of any of our cases

20

that ever applied that reasoning to seizures?

21

after all, you have to stop for a traffic light.

22

have to stop for, you know, bridges that are up and all

23

sorts of things, so you say, you expect to be stopped

24

or seized by government order frequently while you're

25

in a car, and therefore you have no right not to be.

12

I mean,
You

1

MR. CHINN:

I think it's inherently part of

2

the Brown balancing test, as this Court applied it in

3

Sitz, for example, it measures in the third element of

4

the Brown test the degree of intrusion on motorists.

5

QUESTION:

6

about expectation of being stopped.

7

just a novel, a novel approach to me, to use the

8

expectation rationale with respect to seizures as

9

opposed to searches.

10

Yeah, but it doesn't say anything

MR. CHINN:

I mean, this is

I think the point remains that

11

cars are stopped in any number of different contexts,

12

even at the government's direction, and so it's

13

reasonable for the Court to conclude that that is a --

14

presents a lesser degree of intrusion than the

15

pedestrian context.

16

QUESTION:

Well, even so, it's somewhat

17

circular.

18

then there is going to be no expectation.

19

I mean, if we say there is no expectation,

QUESTION:

You're using the expectation.

20

You're using the expectation.

It's just -- it's much

21

more -- it's reasonable to stop cars very often, very

22

often for checks, you know, all the things that people

23

have said in prior cases.

24

case is it doesn't seem any more reasonable to stop a

25

car just to look for evidence of a crime in general

But the difficulty with your

13

1

than it does to stop a pedestrian to look for evidence

2

of a crime in general.

3

least I haven't heard you do, is to say why there's

4

something special about this that would really justify

5

stopping the car any more than it would justify

6

stopping a pedestrian.

7

MR. CHINN:

And what you haven't done, at

So what is it?
It is reasonable to stop a car

8

because of, again, the connection between the activity

9

that's sought to be regulated here and the roadway.

10

QUESTION:

So that's when we go back to

11

Justice Ginsburg who made the point very well, look,

12

people sometimes rob banks on foot.

13

perhaps are poor, they can't afford cars.

14

around.

15

So do we stop all the pedestrians?

16

her question.

17

Bank robbers
They walk

And that happens a certain number of times.
I mean, you heard

My problem is, I can't find anything special

18

about being in a car in respect to a general search

19

without suspicion that there's any special crime but

20

just a general effort to stop crime, and I haven't

21

heard you present one.

22

MR. CHINN:

Again, we think that the Court

23

could look to the substantial connection between drugs

24

and their trafficking and possession on the roadways.

25

If the Court is not convinced that that presents a

14

1

significantly different context than the pedestrian

2

situation, then of course you could apply Brown in that

3

context.

4

QUESTION:

What was the reasoning of the

5

Court in Martinez-Fuerte?

6

a -- a stop with -- without a search, and unless there

7

was probable cause.

8
9

MR. CHINN:

There you had a -- a -- a --

Yes, the Court found on balance

the degree of intrusion was not -- did not outweigh the

10

government's interests in that case, and that since

11

Martinez Fuerte, like the case here, is a smuggling

12

case.

13

were smuggling illegal aliens in their cars, and the

14

Court thought it sufficient that a program of the

15

neutral seizures at a checkpoint guarded against

16

arbitrariness and did not outweigh the intrusion caused

17

by --

18

There the fear was that persons or motorists

QUESTION:

Mr. Chinn, wasn't there the

19

factor, the locational factor there that the stop,

20

although distant from the border, was on the main --

21

the road, the highway that you would take if you were

22

going from the Mexican border into the interior because

23

that's where all the traffic flowed.

24

don't have that.

25

But here you

It could be any -- anyplace.

MR. CHINN:

Let me say a few things about

15

1

that if I can, Your Honor.

2

the Court's decision in Martinez Fuerte.

3

stops of persons that there was no reasonable suspicion

4

to believe had just crossed the border.

5

QUESTION:

First, that was not part of
These were

But it was a fact in the case.

6

There wasn't any question it was a main highway that

7

people used, traveling from Mexico.

8
9

MR. CHINN:

Yes, it was a factor in the

case, Your Honor, but it didn't appear critical to the

10

Court's holding, nor did the United States argue that

11

that case is sufficiently different from our case.

12

QUESTION:

So you think you could stop --

13

police can stop cars anywhere in the United States just

14

to look for smuggled immigrants?

15

say, you know, can I see your papers, please?

16

sort of scary.

17

MR. CHINN:

Just stop the car and
That's

If a particular government

18

program was not successful, certainly, that is one

19

check against that sort of checkpoint as well.

20

second element of the Brown balancing test requires

21

essentially that the programs serve the governmental

22

interests at stake, and so a program that didn't do

23

very well certainly wouldn't survive this Court's

24

Fourth Amendment scrutiny.

25

QUESTION:

The

What seems to be your argument,

16

1

the strength of your case depends on the success, your

2

success rate.

3

reasonable by what you find rather than by what you

4

knew before you started.

5

In other words, you prove it was

MR. CHINN:

I think it's -- I think it's

6

both, Your Honor.

We clearly have articulated in this

7

case a substantial interest in interdicting drugs.

8

Respondents haven't really challenged that as an

9

important interest, and it's an interest that this

10

Court has upheld on many occasions.

11

QUESTION:

If I read your brief, it's

12

important to your case that 5 percent of the people in

13

Indianapolis apparently don't have their driver's

14

license with them and another 5 percent have some

15

marijuana in the car.

16

your case would be much weaker.

If there was only 1 percent,

17

MR. CHINN:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. CHINN:

20

QUESTION:

21

24
25

Yeah.
Although probably -But you didn't know that until

you conducted the searches.

22
23

It would be weaker, Your Honor.

MR. CHINN:

Well, we knew that we had a

problem.
QUESTION:

Sort of like -- sort of like you

found something there, ergo, it was reasonable to look

17

1

for it.

2

MR. CHINN:

Well, we certainly knew we had a

3

problem, and our program actually proved that we were

4

correct.

5

QUESTION:

The case that everybody begins

6

with in automobile searches is Carroll, the prohibition

7

case, and the Chief Justice in that case writing it

8

said it would be intolerable and unreasonable if a

9

prohibition agent were authorized to stop every

10

automobile on the chance of finding liquor and thus

11

subject all persons lawfully using the highway to the

12

inconvenience and indignity of such a search.

13

this case, isn't it?

14

MR. CHINN:

That's

It's not for a couple reasons.

15

First, that case was for that quote, and that case was

16

talking about searches, and of course we don't search

17

anyone here.

18

seizures.

19

Martinez Fuerte and Sitz and its suggestion in Delaware

20

versus Prouse shows there are any number of things that

21

a court -- that a government can -- interests that can

22

be served by a checkpoint program.

23
24
25

We engage in a pattern of brief roadway

And secondly, this Court's decisions in

Mr. Chief Justice, I'll reserve my remaining
time.

Thank you.
QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Chinn.

Ms. Millett, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA MILLETT

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

4
5

MS. MILLETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

6

Our position is first the petitioner's

7

checkpoints, including their drug detection component,

8

are constitutional under this Court's decisions in

9

Martinez-Fuerte, which upheld a checkpoint designed to

10

intercept alien smuggling, and Sitz, which upheld a

11

sobriety check-in -- checkpoint.

12

Second, petitioner's checkpoints are also

13

constitutional because they advance the government's

14

legitimate interests in assuring that only properly

15

licensed and sober drivers --

16

QUESTION:

On your first point about

17

Martinez, how would you respond to Justice Scalia's

18

question?

19

Indianapolis?

20
21

Would that checkpoint have been legal in

MS. MILLETT:
yes.

As a statutory matter, no.

22

QUESTION:

23

MS. MILLETT:

24
25

As a constitutional matter,
The Border Patrol --

As a constitutional matter.
-- does not have authority to

go beyond a hundred miles.
As a constitutional matter, if the government,

19

1

Border Patrol was able to show that, for example, in

2

Indianapolis or Kansas or between -- somewhere in

3

Colorado there was a thoroughfare that had a strong

4

nexus to alien smuggling, for example, seasonal workers

5

moving back and forth, then it would be.

6

QUESTION:

With what we now know about

7

Indianapolis, just right as of today, do you think it

8

would be legal to have the Martinez-Fuerte's checkpoint

9

in Indianapolis today?

10

MS. MILLETT:

I think we would have to show

11

an alien smuggling nexus to the roadways on which we

12

established our checkpoints.

13

QUESTION:

Well, then did they have to show

14

them before they conducted these checkpoints here, did

15

the city have to show that 5 percent of the people were

16

driving without licenses or did they find that out

17

after they did it?

18

MS. MILLETT:

I think they have to

19

establish -- they have to have a reasonable basis for

20

believing that there will be a problem.

21

have that with the alien checkpoints that the Border

22

Patrol operates, and here the City of Indianapolis

23

focused on crime statistics and was able to determine

24

that particular areas --

25

QUESTION:

Obviously, we

The high crime statistics they

20

1
2

got as a result of the program they instituted.
MS. MILLETT:

No, no, no, general crime,

3

drug crime statistics, which you obviously will know in

4

advance as a law enforcement agency, just as we know

5

where the primary problems of alien transportation are

6

in the country.

7

QUESTION:

Let me follow up on the

8

Indianapolis hypothetical.

9

alien smuggling?

Why would it have to be

I mean, why couldn't you simply

10

identify an area that has a large -- you know that

11

there are a large number of illegal aliens in this

12

section of Indianapolis that is largely Hispanic, so

13

you simply set up roadblocks, and I'll bet you you'll

14

get a pretty good catch if you stop every car that

15

drives down the street in that section to see if there

16

are illegal aliens in the car.

17

MS. MILLETT:

I think as a constitutional

18

matter, if the government were able to show the

19

appropriate nexus and the effect that its checkpoints

20

again were actually effective that it would -- and the

21

intrusion was no more than it was in Martinez-Fuerte,

22

but, yes, the Fourth Amendment applies the same in

23

Indianapolis as it does in Arizona.

24

QUESTION:

25

Then the same result then would

be for pedestrian checkpoints?

21

1

MS. MILLETT:

2

QUESTION:

3

MS. MILLETT:

4
5

No, not at all.

Why not?
There's a bright line in this

Court's decisions between cars and pedestrians.
QUESTION:

Why should there be?

In other

6

words, the rationale that you're advancing and that

7

your brother has been advancing doesn't seem to me to

8

make any particular sense of that distinction.

9

MS. MILLETT:

First, it's beneficial.

I

10

don't think there's anything about this case that puts

11

us closer to pedestrian checkpoints than

12

Martinez-Fuerte and Sitz, but the rationale has been --

13

QUESTION:

Well, if -- if Martinez-Fuerte

14

can be applied as you have said to Justice Scalia that

15

it may be applied in Indianapolis or the middle of

16

Nebraska somewhere because there is -- there is a --

17

a -- a general basis in the evidence prior to the

18

search operation, that there is a high incidence of

19

illegal aliens, then to begin with Judge Posner's

20

rationale has nothing, I guess, to do -- much to do

21

with the case, and it doesn't seem to have anything --

22

it doesn't seem to be key to the use of automobiles,

23

and therefore I don't see why, if we accept your answer

24

to Justice Scalia, we are not well down the road toward

25

pedestrian checkpoints.

22

1

MS. MILLETT:

Because cars are different

2

than pedestrians.

Cars are highly regulated.

This

3

Court has recognized this they are subject to a web of

4

regulation by government, and I think it was Justice

5

Breyer earlier said one has no reasonable expectation

6

within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment that you

7

will not be briefly stopped and asked to show a

8

driver's license, your authority to operate the car,

9

and under Martinez-Fuerte that you are not using the

10

car to smuggle illegal aliens, we see no difference

11

between that and smuggling drugs.

12

And in this case the drug component isn't

13

necessary to explain the seizure.

14

the seizure is independently justifiable.

15

most of the time is expended on the driver's license

16

checkpoints.

17

The entire scope of
In fact,

The only role of the drug detection component

18

is that they're in a justifiable stop under this

19

Court's precedence for driver's license checkpoint and

20

sobriety checkpoint.

21

That does not independently cause the seizure, although

22

we do think a drug checkpoint in its own right is

23

constitutional, but it does --

24
25

QUESTION:

They add a canine sniff for dogs.

Well, then, on -- excuse me -- on

that theory could the police station drug detection

23

1

dogs at every street crossing where the traffic lights

2

require pedestrians to wait until the yellow light

3

comes along?

4

normal manner in which pedestrian traffic is regulated.

5

The dog is no more intrusive than the dog is when it

6

goes around the car.

7

a good search?

8

The pedestrians are being stopped in the

Could the police do that and have

MS. MILLETT:

Yes.

I think the police have

9

a right to be on street corners with their dogs or

10

without their dogs, and smell -- the sniff the dog

11

alerts to is odors emanating from --

12

QUESTION:

So if somebody says to the dog,

13

you know, get away from me, the police can say, no,

14

you've got to let the dog search you?

15

MS. MILLETT:

No, that then I think would be

16

a seizure of a pedestrian if they won't -- can't get

17

away, but the pedestrian can walk away.

18

difference.

19

QUESTION:

It's a big

Then why isn't it a seizure of

20

the car for something other than the purposes of

21

checking license plates when the dog goes around the

22

car?

23

that the driver of the car can say to the police, get

24

the dog away from the car.

25

to do it.

Are you telling -- or maybe your answer would be

And the police would have

Would they?

24

1

MS. MILLETT:

No, I don't think so.

Because

2

the difference between the pedestrian example and this

3

one is that you have a legitimate basis for the seizure

4

independent of the dog.

5

checkpoint.

6

QUESTION:

That's the driver's license

You have a legitimate basis for

7

stopping the pedestrian until the light turns yellow.

8

The pedestrian is just as validly stopped as the car is

9

for the driver's license check.

10

MS. MILLETT:

That -- that -- well, I think

11

it's a separate question whether --

12

QUESTION:

13
14

If the pedestrian can tell the

police to get the dog away, why can't the car owner?
MS. MILLETT:

I'm not sure that a traffic

15

light, in fact, effectuates a seizure within the

16

meaning of the Fourth Amendment.

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. MILLETT:

19
20

Well -Because pedestrians can turn

around and walk away, they can do a U-turn.
QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

Do we know in the facts of this

21

case whether the dog sniffing occurs while the license

22

check is going on or whether the policeman first checks

23

the license and then says, okay, now stay here, I'm

24

done checking your license, but I want to walk around

25

the car with a police dog?

25

1

MS. MILLETT:

My understanding is that it's

2

done while the driver's license check is going on.

3

that's what takes the two to three to five minutes.

4

Dog sniffs take a minute, 90 seconds at the most for a

5

very large vehicle.

6

QUESTION:

And

Suppose the city council

7

authorized this search and had a preamble and said, in

8

order to interdict drug distributors, we are setting up

9

the following checkpoint, and then the case is just

10

like it is, and you have a license, they say that the

11

sole -- the purpose is to interdict drug smuggling.

12

Does that change the case at all?

13

MS. MILLETT:

It doesn't -- we have two

14

rationales.

15

drug smuggling checkpoints in their own right are

16

constitutional, so obviously under that theory it would

17

not.

18

that that is not a legitimate basis for having a

19

checkpoint, then the case would be different if they

20

did the stop and they did not actually effectuate the

21

interests that are served by a driver's license

22

checkpoint, they didn't ask for the licenses, and they

23

didn't act upon license violations.

24
25

Our position is that drug interdiction,

But if the Court disagrees with that and says

If they, in fact, act upon license violations
and serve that interest within the meaning of this

26

1

Court's prior recognition of that as a legitimate

2

interest, then the fact that they also serve another

3

legitimate interest that does not in any way change the

4

nature of the intrusion on the individual, does not

5

enhance the length or duration or intensity of the

6

seizure, then it would not make a difference, and then

7

what the government says or doesn't say in the preamble

8

I don't think would change the Fourth Amendment

9

analysis.

10

QUESTION:

In other words, in order to do

11

it, the city has candidly told us it wants it to

12

apprehend drug distributors, it has this pretense of

13

stopping people to check their licenses an also

14

purpose, but it's using that as a gateway to get to

15

what it's really interested in, which is the drug

16

distribution.

17

MS. MILLETT:

You mean pretense by the fact

18

that they ask for licenses but don't do anything about

19

it? And I profess to do something --

20

QUESTION:

No, you said that they would have

21

to do that.

Mr. Chinn told us -- candidly, I thought,

22

to his credit -- that the primary purpose of doing this

23

is to apprehend drug distributors.

24

yeah, but they couldn't just do that openly or overtly,

25

they need some kind of cover for it.

So you're saying,

So we do the

27

1

license check.

2

MS. MILLETT:

That's not what I mean to say.

3

Our position is that a drug checkpoint in its own right

4

would be constitutional.

5

smuggling, aliens --

6

QUESTION:

Border patrols, the drug

So let's take -- then let's take

7

away that.

8

registration check this would still be okay, we just

9

stop people because we want to have the dog go around

10
11

You are saying without the license and

the car.
MS. MILLETT:

I'm saying two things.

We're

12

saying that's our first -- that's our first argument.

13

Our second argument is if the drug interdiction purpose

14

is not in itself a basis for the stop, then as long as

15

the driver's license stop or the sobriety stop is

16

actually being accomplished by the government, those

17

interests are being served, and the drug detection

18

component does not add anything to the length or

19

duration of the seizure, then it would still be

20

constitutional under both of them.

21

them are legitimate interests, if the Court doesn't --

22

as long as -- as long as one legitimate interest is

23

served by the checkpoints and explains the entire --

24

and justifies the entire scope and duration and

25

intensity of the seizure, the fact that the government

And that if both of

28

1

has other interests, primary or secondary, doesn't

2

matter.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH FALK

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7

MR. FALK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

9

This case is not Martinez-Fuerte.

This case

10

is not Sitz.

11

investigatory seizures of primarily innocent persons

12

without cause.

The Indianapolis roadblocks are criminal

In Martinez-Fuerte --

QUESTION:

Certainly the seizures in

14

Martinez-Fuerte and Sitz were also seizures of

15

primarily entered in.

16

percent harvest there.

17

MR. FALK:

No one claims they had a 51

That's correct, but this Court

18

recognized, Your Honor, for instance, in Montoya

19

de Hernandez that Martinez-Fuerte was one of a number

20

of cases reflecting the long-standing concern for the

21

protection of the integrity of the border, which has

22

been characterized as a noncriminal investigatory

23

concern.

24

QUESTION:

But in Martinez-Fuerte they

25

arrested these people.

That's how the case came to

29

1

this Court.

2

MR. FALK:

Well, of course, Your Honor, but

3

in Camara back in 1967, violation of the housing codes

4

in issue there were criminal.

5

violation of the regulatory statute turned out to be

6

criminal.

7

see what the programmatic purpose was, and recognized

8

that the programmatic purpose was not for criminal

9

investigation.

10
11

In New York v. Burger,

This Court in all those cases looked back to

If, in fact a -QUESTION:

What did the Court say, then in

12

Martinez-Fuerte?

13

programmatic purpose, as you call it, was?

14

What did it say the main purpose, the

MR. FALK:

Protection, integrity of the

15

borders, Your Honor, have been recognized by this Court

16

since I believe the 1880s in the United States v. Boyd,

17

that the United States has an inherent regulatory right

18

to ensure that people and things that enter this

19

country do so lawfully.

20

Similarly, lower courts have recognized through

21

inspection and checking licenses, registrations, and

22

inspection status has recognized a safety-related

23

purpose for traffic stops.

That is a regulatory purpose.

24

QUESTION:

And drunk driving.

25

MR. FALK:

And drunk driving, Your Honor.

30

1
2

QUESTION:
by drug use?

3

How about driving while impaired

If that were the purpose, okay?
MR. FALK:

If the -- if the City of

4

Indianapolis could show here that there was, indeed, a

5

problem of drugged driving, like there was in Sitz of

6

drunk driving, then of course there could be a

7

regulatory purpose.

8
9

QUESTION:

How could the city show that

without having done some investigation?

10

MR. FALK:

Well, I think if you looked at

11

Sitz there were reams of statistics introduced there to

12

show what the national and local problem of drunk

13

driving was.

Sitz recognized -- I'm sorry?

14

QUESTION:

Please, finish your answer.

15

MR. FALK:

Sitz recognizes that there is a

16

regulatory right of a state to get an immediately

17

unsafe vehicle off the road.

18

car without brakes is imminently unsafe to innocent

19

persons, so is a car driven by a drunk driver.

20

QUESTION:

In the same way that a

What about a driver without a

21

driver's license, is that a safety concern?

22

acknowledge that it's okay to make the stops to see

23

that the person behind the wheel has a driver's

24

license?

25

MR. FALK:

Do you

Arguably, Your Honor, but even

31

1

those stops, even those noncriminal investigatory

2

seizures have to be justified under Brown, there has to

3

be a showing there actually is --

4
5

QUESTION:

That's fine.

Let's assume that

that is so justified here.

6

MR. FALK:

Yes.

7

QUESTION:

What difference does it make that

8

in the course of that search, in the course of that

9

stop the police also send a dog around the car?

I

10

mean, in the case of individualized traffic stops, we

11

have innumerable cases where the person who was caught

12

with drugs in his car after a stop for a broken

13

taillight and in the course of interrogating the driver

14

about the broken taillight, the policeman sees

15

something suspicious, and then conducts a full search.

16

And it is often alleged and may well be true

17

that the reason the policeman stopped the car with the

18

broken taillight was that this car looked suspicious

19

and he thought it might have drugs in it, and we have

20

simply rejected that argument.

21

going to go into the subjective motivation of the

22

individual policeman.

23

for stopping the car, that's enough.

24

MR. FALK:

That's correct.

25

QUESTION:

Now, why shouldn't that apply in

We've said we're not

So long as he had a valid basis

2

traffic stops?

MR. FALK:

Subjective intent is irrelevant

provided there is otherwise probable cause.

Right, so --

6

MR. FALK:

But there is no cause here, Your

But there is cause.

You've

acknowledged that it is okay to stop to check for
driver's licenses.
MR. FALK:

Well, there's not a criminal

12

investigatory cause.

And I would add, Your Honor, that

13

this Court has made it clear in, for instance, in

allowed by the narrow exception to the cause

10

Not just

The Court has said it's correct.
MR. FALK:

The Court has said that a search

11

of unattended luggage is not -- by a dog, a sniff,

12

excuse me, is not a search, but I'm assuming it's not a

13

search for this purpose, Your Honor, but still it is

14

clearly beyond the scope.

15

unnecessary --

It is something

16

QUESTION:

Beyond the scope of what?

17

MR. FALK:

Beyond the scope of what is

18

allowed for the regulatory intrusion to check someone's

19

license, Your Honor.

20

QUESTION:

I guess a policeman could walk a

21

dog, a sniffing dog down the street, couldn't he?

22

mean, suppose he did that.

23

mean, so it doesn't bother anybody, but he sniffs the

24

dog.

25

I

There are people stopped, I

I thought probably that was lawful.
MR. FALK:

Well, but Your Honor, this is a

34

seizure.

2

QUESTION:

3

that particular point.

4

characterization, not theirs.

5

said, I thought that this was a stop the basic purpose

6

of which was to look for drugs; i.e., if the police had

7

known they weren't going to get -- be able to look for

8

drugs, there would have been no stop.

9

But I would like you to address
I'm confused.

My

But from what Mr. Chinn

From what the Solicitor General said, I

10

thought that my characterization, not hers, that this

11

was a different kind of stop.

12

search for drunk drivers or a stop to search for

13

licenses -- unlicensed drivers, and the police would

14

have done it if drugs had had nothing to do with it,

15

and their having done this is like somebody stopping at

16

a red light, and people walk a dog around.

17
18

This was a stop to

Well, there seems to be quite different
considerations.

19

So what is this case?

MR. FALK:

This is not like stopping at a

20

red light.

21

warning, drug interdiction checkpoint ahead.

22

This is being pulled over by a sign saying,

QUESTION:

But that isn't my point.

My

23

point is, have the police set this up to look for drugs

24

and in the absence of their ability to do that, they

25

wouldn't have set it up, wouldn't have stopped people?

35

1

Or is it a search that the police set up to look for no

2

licenses and alcohol?

3

can't look for drugs, they would have done it anyway?

4

MR. FALK:

And if you had told them you

This is a search to look for

5

drugs, Your Honor.

6

valid license or registration, one cannot leave the

7

checkpoint until the dog sniffs the car.

8
9

No matter how quickly one shows a

QUESTION:

Now, when you say it's a search

to look for drugs, and the Solicitor General says it

10

isn't, it's a search for -- how am I going to find out

11

who is right?

12

MR. FALK:

The City of Indianapolis concedes

13

that the primary purpose of this search, excuse me, of

14

this seizure is to look for drugs.

15

QUESTION:

Where did they concede that?

16

MR. FALK:

They have conceded that, I

17

believe, in their briefs.

18

before this Court.

19

QUESTION:

They conceded that today

And does primary purpose mean in

20

the absence of their ability to do that, they wouldn't

21

have done it; i.e., it was a necessary condition for

22

the stop?

23

MR. FALK:

I'm sorry, Your Honor, I cannot

24

answer that.

All I can answer is that everything that

25

an individual is told when they are stopped, they are

36

1

told, you are now at a drug roadblock.

2

this is a drug interdiction checkpoint coming ahead

3

with canines to check for drugs.

4
5

QUESTION:

They are told,

You cannot --

Did the courts below find there

were these other purposes in addition?

6

MR. FALK:

The trial court found that from

7

the fact that the licenses were checked, that there's a

8

secondary purpose to look for licenses.

9

Circuit, Judge Posner found that the primary, not sole

10

purpose was to look for evidence of drugs, and in fact

11

as I've indicated, everyone is told when they're

12

pulling up there is no pretense, there is no one saying

13

this is a license roadblock, you are at a drug

14

checkpoint.

15

checking of licenses, there is no valid reason to go

16

beyond that and introduce the drug-detecting dog unless

17

you are now converting this seizure which arguably

18

might be a regulatory seizure into one for purposes of

19

criminal investigation.

20
21
22

And even if as I indicated this was a

Why can't the city or the state

have a multipurpose stop?

Arguably they could.

never attempted below to justify even under Brown

having a license checkpoint.

What service -- at what point do

you think the city would have to make that showing?

QUESTION:

You mean the city council would

have to pass a resolution?
MR. FALK:

No, I mean in the course of

justifying their search to the Court.
QUESTION:

Justifying it at what point?

I

mean, when it's brought to court, as it was here?

19

MR. FALK:

Yes.

20

QUESTION:

But you're not saying they would

21

have to justify it beforehand?

22

MR. FALK:

No.

QUESTION:

It seems to me in court, the

lower court, the District Court they found that there

25

were additional purposes.

38

1

MR. FALK:

The lower court found only that

2

licenses and registrations were taken, and from that

3

she surmised this secondary purpose.

4

QUESTION:

Surmised?

5

MR. FALK:

Well, there is no other evidence,

QUESTION:

But if that was satisfactory for

6

Your Honor.

7
8

the District Court, are you saying it's clearly

9

erroneous to have found that?

10

MR. FALK:

No, Your Honor.

I think it's

11

clear from the way the roadblock is set up that

12

licenses and registration are taken to hold the people

13

there so that the dog can sniff the car.

14

QUESTION:

Take an easy case in which there

15

is simply a history in Indianapolis or any other

16

jurisdiction of license roadblock checks, and after 25

17

years of doing this, suddenly one day a drug sniffing

18

dog appears at the license check.

19

anything constitutionally suspect in the use of the dog

20

there?

21

MR. FALK:

Would you find

Yes, Your Honor, that would be

22

unconstitutional because you have now gone beyond the

23

scope of what is arguably a valid, noncriminal

24

investigatory seizure under Brown.

25

QUESTION:

Arguably --

Well, but let's -- you're talking

39

1

about seizure.

2

sniffs, if it sniffs at all, during the time in which

3

it takes to look at the license so that there is no --

4

there is no greater imposition upon the driver by the

5

use of the dog.

6

suspicion?

7

Let's assume that the dog simply

Would that raise a constitutional

MR. FALK:

Yes, Your Honor.

This Court has

8

never said you can take a noncriminal investigatory

9

seizure and incrementally add things to it and still be

10
11

constitutional.

The opposite is true.

Let's go back to Opperman, inventory case.

12

You can have one officer searching a car and another

13

officer searching the exact same car, I mean another

14

car in the exact same way, two different searches

15

exactly the same.

16

the programmatic purpose is not criminal investigation,

17

an inventory search.

18

unconstitutional if the officer is looking for evidence

19

of a crime.

20

One can be constitutional because

QUESTION:

The other could be

But in the example that I gave

21

you, the assumption that I was making or implying by

22

the hypo was that the license check remained, in fact,

23

a bona fide license check.

24

arrived, it continued to be so after the dog arrived.

25

If you make that assumption, that in fact there is a

It had been so before dogs

40

1

bona fide license check being made for the ostensible

2

purpose, that of checking licenses, does the addition

3

of the dog raise a constitutional suspicion?

4
5

MR. FALK:

Yes, it does, and for the reason

QUESTION:

Does it raise it for any other

I indicated.

6
7

reason than it raises a question as to whether they are

8

still really looking for licenses?

9

MR. FALK:

Your Honor --

10

QUESTION:

I can understand -- I guess I can

11

understand your argument.

12

dog appears, we all know that they are no longer

13

interested in licenses, they are interested in

14

something else.

15

doing here.

16

you assume, if it were proved, if it were found as a

17

fact by a reviewing court that the license check was

18

still a bona fide purpose, that's where I have trouble

19

with your position.

20

You say, hey, look, when the

They are doing just what they are

That argument I can understand.

MR. FALK:

But if

Your Honor, we're not asking this

21

Court or any court to go inside the head of people to

22

see what their real purpose is.

23

there is only one purpose.

24

or registrations.

25

QUESTION:

When you add the dog,

A dog cannot check licenses

But the reality of police work is

41

1

that the police enforce all of the laws.

2

were a driver's license checkpoint as stipulated by

3

Justice -- hypothesized by Justice Souter, and the

4

police said now we want to add the people, the officers

5

manning this license checkpoint who are experts in drug

6

detection.

7

suspicious about that?

8

MR. FALK:

9
10

Suppose there

Would there be something constitutionally

No, provided they use that

expertise in a way that does not require dogs or
equipment or anything that is beyond the scope --

11

QUESTION:

No, but they're trained

12

especially to look at people's eyes and to smell and to

13

look at the kinds of containers they can see in plain

14

view, this is to normal police work.

15

MR. FALK:

Sure. Of course.

And that's

16

analogous to doing an inventory inspection of a car and

17

seeing evidence of a crime in plain view.

18

QUESTION:

So then if that's permissible,

19

what's not permissible about adding the dog?

20

the dog's more efficient?

21

MR. FALK:

Because -- but you've added the

22

dog.

23

It's not in plain view.

24

completely different and --

25

Because

You've added something which is beyond the scope.

QUESTION:

You've added something

Officers with really sharp noses

42

1

would be okay?

2

(Laughter.)

3

QUESTION:

How about bringing a witness,

4

just bringing a witness to look at somebody stopped at

5

a stoplight?

6

the time.

7

policeman does doesn't hurt them in any way whatsoever.

8

It's just a way of getting a witness or somebody to --

9

you're pursuing this line of I guess assuming that this

I mean, people do things like this all

You stop them for one purpose, but what the

10

was a stop that was done for a legitimate other

11

purpose, and I'm having trouble following that

12

assumption.

13

MR. FALK:

Your Honor, we are arguing this

14

because we -- the question has been asked, what if

15

there was a legitimate secondary purpose.

16

contended all along in both the lower courts and our

17

briefs that --

18

QUESTION:

We have

What does secondary mean?

To me

19

secondary meant that they never would have done this

20

thing if it weren't for the primary purpose.

21

what I thought it was and now I'm a little mixed up

22

about it.

23

MR. FALK:

That's

Your Honor, I cannot tell you

24

what the city would and would not have done but for the

25

drug search seizing.

43

1

QUESTION:

Do they have any other places in

2

the city where they stop people for checking for

3

licenses?

MR. FALK:

Not that I'm aware of, Your

QUESTION:

Do they have any other places in

Honor.

6
7

the city in the same way where they stop people for

8

drunk driving with these same kinds of checks?

9
10

MR. FALK:

Not that I'm aware of, Your

QUESTION:

Mr. Falk, I don't understand why

Honor.

11
12

it makes any difference whether the city would have

13

done this otherwise.

14

in this case?

15

defendant who has been convicted of a drug offense

16

comes in and says, the policeman who stopped my car,

17

oh, yes, he stopped it because of a defective brake

18

light, but that's not really what he was after.

19

don't inquire as to whether that's really what he was

20

after, and I frankly personally believe that very often

21

that isn't what he was really after, that he stopped

22

this suspicious looking car which happened to have a

23

defective brake light.

24
25

Why does it make any difference

It surely makes no difference when a

And we

Now, we just don't listen to that argument.
We don't care what the primary subjective purpose was.

44

1

Why should we care here so long as they have authority

2

to stop for the driver's licenses and one of the

3

purposes of the stop is driver's licenses, what

4

difference does it make that they have another motive?

5

MR. FALK:

Programmatic purpose has always

6

been extremely important in searches or seizures which

7

are designed for things other than criminal

8

investigation.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Falk, I want to get into this

10

same area with you because as I read Sitz and

11

Martinez-Fuerte, this Court didn't look at purpose at

12

all.

13

about purpose, what was the purpose.

14

analysis.

15

the government need and how closely does the checkpoint

16

serve that need?

17

look for purpose, so I'm not sure that these

18

discussions have helped the analysis that much.

We have spent most of the morning here talking

19

That wasn't the

The Court just went to balancing.

What does

And we totally obviated the need to

MR. FALK:

The problem, Your Honor, is if we

20

lose the purpose inquiry procedures which are not

21

inherently regulatory like Martinez-Fuerte, which are

22

not immediately concerning safety, like Sitz, then we

23

are going to end up with pedestrian roadblocks

24

because --

25

QUESTION:

You have no bright line.

45

I read

1

over Martinez-Fuerte twice in the last, and I simply

2

don't find any statement in there that the seizure was

3

primarily regulatory.

4

the case that says that?

5

people.

6

MR. FALK:

Can you refer me to language in
They ended up arresting the

That's correct, Your Honor.

And

7

as I said, they arrested people in Burger and arguably

8

could have arrested in Camara.

9

QUESTION:

But where does it say in

10

Martinez-Fuerte that the seizure is primarily

11

regulatory?

12

MR. FALK:

Martinez-Fuerte does talk about

13

the immigration problems, and other cases I cited this

14

Court back --

15
16
17

QUESTION:

I asked you about

Martinez-Fuerte.
MR. FALK:

No, there is nothing in

18

Martinez-Fuerte, Your Honor, that specifically says

19

it's regulatory.

20

QUESTION:

That says it's regulatory?

21

MR. FALK:

That's correct.

22

QUESTION:

But you're trying to reconcile

23

that decision as a piece of a tapestry with the ones

24

that had to do, for example, with the fire

25

investigation when this Court did make something of a

46

1

purpose line.

They said if you want to find out how

2

this fire got started, that's regulatory and it's okay.

3

MR. FALK:

That's correct. That's correct.

4

QUESTION:

But if you're trying to find the

5
6

arsonist, it's not okay.
MR. FALK:

Of course.

And in Opperman this

7

Court found it extremely important that the seizures

8

there and the searches were pursuant to a noncriminal

9

inventory purpose.

10

QUESTION:

But I want to go back to the

11

rationale that I think you started to add up right

12

there for the reason for the purpose inquiry.

13

understood what you were saying is, I think you were

14

implying that in cases like Martinez-Fuerte and the

15

regular driver's checks, the question of purpose was

16

not in the case; that where purpose has come into the

17

case, as Justice Ginsburg suggested, we have -- we have

18

said that in fact purpose is a crucial inquiry.

19

understood you to be starting to say that if you don't

20

make it a crucial inquiry, your categories simply

21

collapse and there is no way, in effect, to stop, as

22

you said in your -- there is no way to stop short of

23

pedestrian search.

24
25

If I

And I

Can you elaborate on that?

MR. FALK:

Well, if the category collapses

in multiple dimensions, the first collapse, as this

47

1

Court noted in questionings of Mr. Chinn is what about

2

things that are serious concerns to the city other than

3

drugs?

4

problems, people not paying parking tickets, people not

5

paying child support, other things of stopping

6

motorists.

7

can be seized.

8

into your car is a surrender of your privacy interests,

9

that same argument, as you noted, applies to a

So we will have an expansion to what other

It also collapses, however, as far as who
If the argument is that somehow getting

10

pedestrian in a high crime neighborhood.

11

that person?

12

surrendered a significant amount of privacy, arguably

13

more than I surrender when I drive down the street in

14

my car.

15

Why not stop

That person has by going out in public

Ultimately what the city is arguing, I

16

believe, is that if we subject everyone to the same

17

degree of intrusion pursuant to this plan, that that

18

somehow makes everything constitutional, but this Court

19

has never viewed the Fourth Amendment as somehow being

20

something that allows everyone to be treated in an

21

even-handed manner.

22

constitutional rights are violated in the same way,

23

that's appropriate.

24
25

QUESTION:

As long as everyone's

But we have recognized special

needs as an exception to the individualized suspicion,

48

1

and we've recognized those special needs in the

2

automobile context.

3

guess, that because the state licen -- or the --

4

because the state licenses the driver and because motor

5

vehicles are deadly weapons potentially that the state

6

has a special need of assuring that the people who are

7

driving are licensed and are not impaired by drugs or

8

alcohol.

9

can be met by occasional checkpoints.

10

And it is certainly arguable, I

And maybe there's a special need there that
Is that

unreasonable?

11

QUESTION:

And if I may add, this is exactly

12

what the Court said, this is what Justice O'Connor's

13

point is.

14

We don't need Martinez-Fuerte, not because there is a

15

difference between a regulatory stop and a stop for

16

probable cause, but because it's a car involved.

17

That's the way I read Sitz.

18

This is exactly what the Court said in Sitz.

MR. FALK:

It's an unsafe car involved, as

19

Justice O'Connor noted.

20

that is going to cause imminent harm to innocent

21

persons because it is a deadly weapon when driven by

22

someone who is drunk or drugged.

23

QUESTION:

It's an immediately unsafe car

That doesn't translate to

24

pedestrians at all.

We are dealing with licensing

25

somebody to use this potentially lethal vehicle.

49

1

MR. FALK:

But it doesn't -- that's correct,

2

but it doesn't translate to searching the trunks of

3

cars to search for drug smugglers, it doesn't translate

4

to that at all.

5

someone is drunk or someone is impaired.

6

It translates to checking to see if

QUESTION:

Right.

Then it boils down to

7

whether there is any increase in intrusion by having

8

the dog sniff.

9

MR. FALK:

There is an increase in intrusion

10

when the state turns a criminal investigatory eye on

11

presumably innocent persons, yes.

12

QUESTION:

I know you say yes, but until I

13

heard the Solicitor General, frankly, I thought that

14

just like the first of the cases you're talking about

15

was an immigration case and the second case was a drunk

16

search.

This was a drug search.

17

MR. FALK:

Yes.

18

QUESTION:

The lower courts have treated it

20

MR. FALK:

Yes.

21

QUESTION:

Indianapolis had said any other

22

purpose was secondary.

23

MR. FALK:

Yes.

24

QUESTION:

Now suddenly since the Solicitor

19

25

this way.

General argued, I think there is a new premise reaching

50

1

in -- reaching in.

This is not a drug search case.

2

This is a drunk search plus a dog.

3

different thing.

Now, that's quite a

4

MR. FALK:

That's correct.

5

QUESTION:

And because of that issue, I

6

think it's important to get clear on what it is, and if

7

we're treating it as a drug case, it's one thing.

8

Drunk case plus a dog, it's another.

9

answer, you accepted the characterization.

So in your last
The second

10

characterization.

11

about that and why I take it you think it should be the

12

first characterization, not the second.

13

And I want to be sure what you think

MR. FALK:

This is most definitely a drug

14

case.

The city has always indicated its primary

15

purpose is to interdict drugs, not to find drugged

16

drivers.

The city has always said that's not the

17

purpose.

The purpose is, as the city conceded this

18

morning, to stop bad guys carrying drugs, from carrying

19

them through the streets of Indianapolis, and that is

20

why it's no different than a pedestrian search, because

21

there are bad guys carrying drugs who are walking

22

through the streets of Indianapolis.

23

QUESTION:

So what is wrong about the city

24

saying, look, we have a right to stop people, to look

25

at their licenses?

Police forces do this all the time

51

1

in Fairfax County.

2

your vehicle tax.

3

course of doing it have a dog sniff around the car?

4

fact, their primary purpose may be to have the dog

5

sniff around the car, but they are conducting a stop

6

that is a perfectly legitimate stop, and we don't look

7

into purpose.

8
9

They stop to make sure you paid
Why don't we do that, and in the

MR. FALK:

In

And, again, assuming that was the

case here, which I do not believe it is, because I

10

think we are dealing with a primarily if not sole drug

11

issue, but even assuming that sort of mixed motive

12

which you're hypothesizing --

13

QUESTION:

No, I'm not -- I'm not assuming a

14

mixed motive.

15

get people carrying drugs, and the means of doing it,

16

they said we have a perfect right to stop cars in order

17

to look at licenses, and why don't we do that, and

18

while the cars are stopped, send a dog around the car.

19

What's wrong with that?

20
21

I'm hypothesizing that they wanted to

MR. FALK:

investigatory seizure done without any individual --

22

QUESTION:

23

investigatory seizure.

24

licenses.

25

Then what we have is a criminal

MR. FALK:

No, it isn't a criminal
It's a seizure to look at their

No, it's not.

It's a seizure.

52

1

When you have a dog there, it's a seizure to look for

2

drug activity.

3

QUESTION:

No, but this comes back to your

4

purpose argument.

You're basically saying that Justice

5

Scalia's premise cannot be accepted in those

6

circumstances.

7

MR. FALK:

That's correct.

8

QUESTION:

And you're saying that because

9
10

purpose is crucial, we characterize it this way as the
drug search.

11

MR. FALK:

There has been --

12

QUESTION:

But the tough question, and I

13

think this is consistent with his question, what if we

14

assume, it is found as a fact by the reviewing court

15

that the license check or the registration check is, in

16

fact, a genuine, bona fide purchase -- purpose, and

17

they simply add the dog?

18

we're stopping them for this legitimate purpose anyway,

19

why not check for this, too?

20

around?

They're saying, look, if

Why not let the dog go

21

MR. FALK:

Because --

22

QUESTION:

Why does the dog taint the search

MR. FALK:

Because then you're going back to

23
24
25

in that case?

having a seizure which is for criminal purposes which

53

1

is beyond the scope of what might otherwise be allowed

2

in a noncriminal investigation.

3

QUESTION:

And is the reason of the beyond

4

the scope criterion essentially a slippery slope

5

reason?

6

really an unsupportable premise?

7

that premise, everybody's going to wink and say, we're

8

just checking for licenses, and we happen to have this

9

dog here, and -- and that the -- that the premise, in

Are you, in effect, saying that my premise is
Because if you accept

10

fact, will never -- or will -- the threat that the

11

premise will not be true, that it will not be a bona

12

fide purpose is just too great, and that's why you

13

don't let the dog --

14

MR. FALK:

Yes, although I think in defense

15

of Indianapolis, they're not winking.

16

out --

17

QUESTION:

They're coming

Oh, I realize that.

I'm

18

pursuing -- I'm just pursuing the limits of your

19

argument as Justice Scalia --

20

MR. FALK:

If you break the distinction down

21

between criminal investigatory purpose and a

22

noncriminal investigatory purpose --

23

QUESTION:

Would you say stopping for

24

driver's license, a man who doesn't have a driver's

25

license is not a criminal investigatory purpose?

54

1
2

MR. FALK:

I believe, Your Honor, that

that's been deemed to be regulatory because --

3

QUESTION:

Deemed by whom?

4

MR. FALK:

Well, I think in lower courts, in

5

approaching the problem, have deemed that to be -- the

6

desire is to remove immediately unsafe people off the

7

roads.

8

you're unsafe.

There's a presumption if you have no license

9
10

QUESTION:

Well, there's also a presumption

you've committed a crime.

11

MR. FALK:

Well, yes, Your Honor, but again

12

this Court has recognized, as I said, in Camara and

13

Burger and other cases that you can have a regulatory

14

purpose and a criminal investigatory purpose.

15

QUESTION:

Do you want us to use the

16

Von Raab analysis and in Sitz we said when you have

17

automobiles you don't, you use the Martinez-Fuerte

18

analysis.

19

MR. FALK:

And that's why Sitz said that,

20

because Martinez-Fuerte, I believe, was there,

21

indicating that for that seizure which was not a

22

criminal investigatory seizure, which was part of the

23

inherent regulatory right of the United States to

24

regulate people and things coming into the United

25

States, in that you use a balance, but if we abandon

55

1

the cause requirement when it's a pure criminal

2

investigation, then we will have seizures which are

3

based on a perceived governmental need.

4
5

QUESTION:

Would you allow a dog in a

Martinez-Fuerte stop?

6

MR. FALK:

A dog searching -- if, in fact --

7

if, in fact, this Court's case law allowed regulatory

8

seizures at that point for purposes of contraband, yes.

9

QUESTION:

It seems to me that you're really

10

arguing that there's a difference between pretext when

11

it's an individual officer acting and pretext when it's

12

a regulatory program.

13

MR. FALK:

That's the heart of your case.
It is, and I don't like using the

14

word pretext because, again, I think the City of

15

Indianapolis isn't being --

16
17

QUESTION:

It's a word motive instead of

MR. FALK:

It's a primary, what is the

pretext.

18
19

purpose, and this Court itself in Opperman said here

20

the primary purpose is noncriminal investigatory.

21

Burger

22

investigatory, and the reason for that was because if

23

it was a criminal investigatory purpose, there would

24

have to be specific cause.

25

In

the primary purpose is noncriminal

QUESTION:

And what's the danger that you

56

1

perceive in making the distinction between the

2

individual and the programmatic?

3

distinction?

4

programmatic rem?

5

Why do you make that

Why do you say there can't be a

MR. FALK:

Because the danger, then, I

6

believe is that a sufficient government interest, the

7

drug crisis, will be sufficient to overcome the privacy

8

interests which this Court has always recognized as

9

something held by individuals under the Fourth

10

Amendment.

11

QUESTION:

Mr. Falk, I asked Miss Millett

12

earlier whether the dogs ever took longer than the

13

license check, and she said no, that the license check

14

takes three to five minutes, and the dog's done by the

15

time the license check -- do you agree with that?

16

MR. FALK:

The record is not clear, Your

17

Honor.

The only thing the record indicates is that

18

there's an affidavit from an officer which says it's

19

usually done at the same time, but it's also clear from

20

the record that no one can leave the checkpoint until

21

they're sniffed by a dog.

22

times when the last thing being done is being sniffed

23

by a dog, and that makes sense.

24

checking licenses and registrations, it won't take five

25

minutes, and given the size -- there are 30 police

So it's clear that there are

If you're just

57

1

officers there.

2

have to do multiple cars, and inevitably I believe

3

there's going to be a wait for the dog.

4

Given the number of cars, the dogs

But obviously, Your Honor, the risk here is

5

that if we break down the barrier here and allow this

6

seizure which is clearly for criminal investigatory

7

purposes to occur without cause, then we will be faced

8

with ever-increasing incursions which will be balanced

9

away because if the problem is deemed serious enough,

10

if the intrusion is deemed minimal enough, we will have

11

seizures of persons on streets.

QUESTION:

13

Thank you, Mr. Falk.

Mr. Chinn, you have two minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF A. SCOTT CHINN

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

16

MR. CHINN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

17

I'd like to first clear up from our perspective one of

18

Justice Breyer's concerns about what is the primary

19

purpose or what are the purposes in this case.

20

clearly true that Indianapolis has wanted to primarily

21

emphasize drug detection in these checkpoints, but it's

22

also clear that we had three interests being served.

23

It's clear in the record.

24

fact, in driver's license and registration checks being

25

performed in this very set of checkpoints that 4.2

It's

We were so interested, in

58

1

percent of the motorists stopped in these checkpoints

2

were arrested for traffic violations.

3
4

QUESTION:

And do you ever do other similar

traffic, any registration checks without the drugs?

5

MR. CHINN:

It's not clear from the record

6

whether we do, Your Honor.

I know certainly that we do

7

in Indianapolis sobriety checkpoints quite all the

8

time.

9

registration checkpoints apart from sobriety or drug

I'm not sure about driver's license and

10

checkpoints, but we're clearly interested in all three

11

of these interests being served.

12

QUESTION:

How was it advertised to the

13

public?

14

was a sign that said canine, but what was the other

15

sign?

16

I forgot what those signs were.

I know there

Wasn't it drug checkpoint ahead?
MR. CHINN:

Yes, the signs -- the signs

17

display what our area of emphasis is for those

18

checkpoints, which is narcotics detection checkpoint

19

ahead so many miles, one mile, half a mile, canine in

20

use.

21

Be prepared to stop.
QUESTION:

That's what the sign said.

What is your -- what is your take

22

on whether -- whether you have to wait after your

23

driver's license has been checked for the dog to

24

complete sniffing?

25

Do we know about that?

MR. CHINN:

Well, Mr. Falk is certainly

59

1

correct, the record isn't absolutely clear on that.

2

understanding is that the dogs do their work very

3

quickly.

4

a sequence, and the dog is led around each car really

5

in a matter of seconds.

6

almost all situations the dog will be done with its

7

work.

My

We're only talking about five to ten cars in

So it's my understanding in

Thank you, Mr. Chinn.

Thank you all.
