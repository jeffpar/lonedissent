CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

4

now in Number 99-936, Crystal Ferguson v. The City of

5

Charleston.

6

Ms. Smith.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRISCILLA J. SMITH

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MS. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

This case involves pregnant women who sought

12

medical care at a public hospital and who then were

13

searched by their doctors for evidence of crimes and

14

arrested, seven of them right out of their hospital beds.

15

The special needs exception does not apply to this case to

16

excuse the lack of warrants for three reasons.

17

First, unlike every other special needs case,

18

the threat of law enforcement, the use of arrest as

19

leverage was the key element of the policy.

20

the respondent's own words, what made the policy

21

effective.

22

It was, in

Second, the searches were conducted here in the

23

context of the private, physician-patient relationship and

24

thus there was no diminished expectation of privacy,

25

again, unlike the other special needs cases.
3

1

And finally, the defendants here skirted the

2

warrant and probable cause requirements without

3

demonstrating impracticability.

4

QUESTION:

Ms. Smith, with respect to the first

5

of your reasons you point out that it is quite true, in a

6

sense, that the law enforcement component of the whole

7

scheme was necessary for success.

8

you're using it is success in getting people into the drug

9

treatment, the counseling program and finishing whatever

10
11

I think success as

course of counseling there is, and I understand that.
But isn't there a special need, independent of

12

that, in the sense that the treating physicians need to

13

know -- regardless of whether anyone takes counseling or

14

not they simply need to know whether there is drug use

15

involved, because that affects the risks to the mother and

16

the risks to the fetus, and those are the things that they

17

need to provide for.

18

So my question is, even if we assumed there were

19

no law enforcement component and there were no counseling

20

scheme, wouldn't they have a special need to know and, in

21

fact, didn't they demonstrate that before the law

22

enforcement component was even added to the mix?

23

MS. SMITH:

If there were no law enforcement

24

scheme there would be a search that was being done, but it

25

would be a search that was only done for medical purposes,
4

1

Your Honor, and therefore, as it was before the policy

2

was --

3

QUESTION:

4

MS. SMITH:

Right.

Right.

Yes.

-- implemented, right, and therefore

5

it would have been consented to, because there was consent

6

to treatment in that context.

7

But as soon as they incorporated a criminal

8

sanction and made the policy what it was, they had to

9

comply with the Fourth Amendment, and what the warrant --

10

QUESTION:

Well, they had no -- I'll grant you

11

that the treating physicians had no special need, I guess,

12

to get people into drug treatment programs, necessarily,

13

but they did have a special need to discover the facts

14

and, in fact, to get the evidence that ultimately was

15

turned over to the police.

16
17

MS. SMITH:

20

In some cases there may have been a

need to do medical testing.

18
19

That is correct, isn't it?

QUESTION:
wrong.

In some cases --

Well, didn't they do it -- maybe I'm

Didn't they do it routinely?
MS. SMITH:

They did medical testing prior to

21

the policy for about 3 to 6 months, Your Honor.

They had

22

just started to do testing --

23

QUESTION:

24

MS. SMITH:

25

As soon as they adopted the policy they -- 3

Okay.
-- pursuant to a listed protocol.

5

1

months later, approximately, they expanded the protocol in

2

order to find more people and really what this policy was

3

about was using arrest as leverage, and they've admitted

4

that in their brief.

5

QUESTION:

6

MS. SMITH:

7

QUESTION:

8

MS. SMITH:

9

QUESTION:

10

Suppose they had reasons -Yes.
-- to have arrests.
Mm-hmm.
They had turned this information over

to the Social Services Department --

11

MS. SMITH:

12

QUESTION:

Mm-hmm.
-- to the people who act as

13

counselors to women who are receiving public assistance.

14

Would that have involved any Fourth Amendment violation in

15

your view?

16

MS. SMITH:

I don't believe it would have been a

17

violation, Your Honor, if they were testing for medical

18

purposes and discovered evidence of drug use during

19

pregnancy.

20

individualized suspicion and reporting to DSS, as they

21

did, for every other substance, for heroin, for

22

methamphetamines -- they didn't report any of those to the

23

police.

24

reasonable ground standard.

25

At that point they have some level of

Reporting those to DSS may meet some kind of

QUESTION:

What is DSS, please?
6

1

MS. SMITH:

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

It's the

2

Department of Social Services, to the civil child abuse

3

authorities.

4

QUESTION:

Why does individualized suspicion

5

help?

In cases like Sitz, the roadblock case, one of the

6

rationales for sustaining it is that it's random.

7
8

MS. SMITH:

That's right, Your Honor, but

Sitz is --

9

QUESTION:

They were work both ways, the

10

randomness and the individualized search, and it seems to

11

me that the policy of testing everyone to see if some need

12

counseling is perhaps more sustainable than the

13

individualized suspicion --

14

MS. SMITH:

15

QUESTION:

16

Well, in fact --- argument that you're making to

us --

17

MS. SMITH:

If I understand Your Honor

18

correctly, in Sitz, for example, it's a standardized,

19

nondiscretionary policy, and that I think is what saves

20

it.

21

have here, and there's also the diminished expectation of

22

privacy that drivers have, and that this Court has

23

discussed in a number of cases, including Opperman, and in

24

Sitz, whereas in this case we have a discretionary list of

25

criteria where some women who met the criteria were

It's also a minimal intrusion, not a search like we

7

1

tested.

We know in --

2

QUESTION:

3

they did this for everybody?

4

MS. SMITH:

So it would be more sustainable if

I believe on some levels it would

5

be.

On the other hand, this is not like Sitz for the

6

other reasons I mentioned.

7

QUESTION:

There's a search, not a --

Well I mean, which would you say, the

8

individualized suspicion helps or hurts, because you were

9

arguing a moment ago that individual suspicion makes this

10

more suspect --

11

MS. SMITH:

But I don't -- I'm sorry.

12

QUESTION:

-- and now you're telling me that it

13

would have been better without it.

14

know --

15
16

MS. SMITH:

Well, I need to

I don't believe that there was

individualized --

17

QUESTION:

-- which is the more appropriate

18

policy for a hospital to use, to do this for everybody, or

19

just with individualized suspicion.

20

MS. SMITH:

Which of the two?

If there was true individualized

21

suspicion, and a search was done and -- just for civil

22

purposes, Your Honor, that might meet Fourth Amendment

23

standards.

24

lower level than the probable cause standard.

25

The lower courts have held civil searches to a

QUESTION:

Is DSS civil purposes?
8

1

MS. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor, I'm sorry.

The

2

Department of Social Services is the civil child abuse

3

investigatory agency.

4

QUESTION:

Well, let me put another hypothetical

5

to you, then.

Many States, maybe most States require

6

physicians who in treating someone, find some indication

7

of criminal activity --

8

MS. SMITH:

9

QUESTION:

Mm-hmm.
-- you can't get treated for a

10

gunshot wound, for example, without having that being

11

reported, be reported to the police.

12

Now, how does that differ from -- let's assume

13

they're just doing routine urinalyses of pregnant women to

14

be sure that they don't have drugs which would make the

15

delivery more difficult and possibly hurt the child, and

16

they find drugs in someone.

17

that to the police?

18

MS. SMITH:

Are they allowed to report

If there was a routine program, as

19

Your Honor is presenting it, without a targeted list of

20

criteria, as they had here, a discretionary list of

21

criteria, which is what makes this program so different --

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

I don't understand.

Why does that

make it different?
MS. SMITH:

Because when you have a law

enforcement -9

1

QUESTION:

2

MS. SMITH:

Didn't they do it to everybody?
No, Your Honor.

They didn't search

3

everyone.

4

included discretionary elements such as inadequate

5

prenatal care, and there's evidence in the record that

6

some people who had inadequate prenatal care were tested

7

and some people who had inadequate prenatal care weren't

8

tested, precisely because the word inadequate is so --

9

They looked at a targeted list of criteria that

QUESTION:

Is there not a routine urine specimen

10

collected for someone in the hospital and tests employed?

11

I mean, that seems rather routine.

12

pregnant women entering a hospital --

13

MS. SMITH:

14

QUESTION:

15

MS. SMITH:

Is that not done for

Not --- in connection with a birth?
Not in -- not to be tested for

16

drugs, Your Honor.

If you mean just in general are urine

17

samples taken, at some point during the course of prenatal

18

care, I believe they are, but not --

19

QUESTION:

20

up something like this, or --

21

MS. SMITH:

22

QUESTION:

23

MS. SMITH:

24

QUESTION:

25

MS. SMITH:

Yes, and wouldn't that routinely show

No.
-- do you have to apply special -You have to look for it.
-- analysis?
You have to search for it, Your
10

1
2

Honor, which is what they did here.
QUESTION:

And is that not routine in today's

3

world, where drug use is more common, and the doctor might

4

need to know what to look for with the child?

5

MS. SMITH:

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

It's a

6

special test that would need to be run on top of what's

7

normally done and, in fact --

8

QUESTION:

9

Could a doctor today, when he

thinks -- he has a pregnant woman, and he thinks the

10

woman's taking drugs.

11

see if she's taking drugs?

12

MS. SMITH:

Doctors won't look at the urine to

They might, Your Honor.

I

13

understood Justice O'Connor's question to be, just as a

14

routine matter is it always done.

15

QUESTION:

Well, I don't know if it's a routine

16

matter or not.

17

came in and told me, or the other side did, that doctors

18

normally test pregnant women for drugs, that would sound

19

okay to me, and moreover, if you told me no, that's not

20

what they do, they normally don't, but if they think the

21

woman's taking drugs and she's pregnant they do, that

22

would sound all right to me, too.

23

they're supposed to be looking after the health of the

24

mother and the baby.

25

Where I'm having the problem is, if you

QUESTION:

I mean, after all,

And I don't know why the latter
11

1

doesn't make this more defensible than the former.

2
3

MS. SMITH:

incorporated a criminal sanction.

4

QUESTION:

5

MS. SMITH:

6

Ah, all right.
The reason they were doing the

testing --

7
8

Because what happened here was, they

QUESTION:

Now, if it's a criminal sanction that

makes the difference --

9

MS. SMITH:

10

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
-- which is what I thought the case

11

was about, then I would like to know your response to

12

Justice Scalia's question.

13
14

MS. SMITH:

Could you repeat the question, Your

Honor?

15

QUESTION:

The question was, as I understood

16

it -- he's better at repeating his question than I, but I

17

thought

--

18

(Laughter.)

19

QUESTION:

20

(Laughter.)

21

QUESTION:

I won't resist the chance.

The question, as I took it, is, it's

22

a normal thing, I believe, in the medical world, at least

23

for psychiatric social workers and for doctors, they're

24

all told that if during a medical examination you discover

25

that the patient is going to hurt some other person by
12

1

killing, or -- you know, is going to kill the teller,

2

they're planning a robbery, you have an obligation to tell

3

the police.

4

And of course, that's relevant, because the

5

other side is saying that's just what's happening here.

6

We're learning that the woman has put this viable fetus, a

7

person, at risk, all right.

8

be born, and they're at serious risk, and so why doesn't

9

this apply.

10
11
12

These are children about to

Now that, I think was -- is that fair, that that
was roughly the question, and why doesn't that apply?
MS. SMITH:

That's not the case here, Your

13

Honor, because this is not a case where they were treating

14

people and in the course of medical treatment they came

15

across evidence of a bullet or evidence of drug use.

16

searched for it.

17

what criteria they were going to use to do the search.

18

was not a --

They joined with the police to determine

19

QUESTION:

20

MS. SMITH:

21

QUESTION:

22

It

Well, Ms. Smith -Yes.
-- the vehicle for the discovery was

a urine sample, was it not?

23

MS. SMITH:

24

QUESTION:

25

They

That's right, Your Honor.
And I suppose you have to decide when

you have a urine sample you could look for different
13

1

things in different ways.

2

MS. SMITH:

3

QUESTION:

4

search for this kind of thing.

5

MS. SMITH:

6

QUESTION:

7
8
9

That's right, Your Honor.
And you say they have made a special

Absolutely.
To determine anything from a urine

sample you have to make a special search, don't you?
MS. SMITH:

Well, that's true, Your Honor, but

the difference here is that the search is done

10

specifically to use arrest, to use the criminal sanction

11

and incorporate that into their treatment.

12

QUESTION:

So your complaint is not that it was

13

done for drugs, but that the use of the discovery would be

14

used for arrest.

15

MS. SMITH:

That's right, Your Honor.

As soon

16

as they started to search, as soon as they became

17

essentially the police, searching for evidence of a crime,

18

in order to use arrest as leverage they took on a new role

19

and they had to -- they became like a police officer

20

searching a suspect.

21

QUESTION:

I gathered from some of your previous

22

answers to questions that you're objecting that this test

23

for drugs was something so highly specialized that itself

24

it raised a flag, but it's only that it was used in

25

connection with a desire to bring law enforcement to play
14

1

that you object to it.

2
3

MS. SMITH:

I don't know if I understand what

you're saying, Your Honor.

4

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

Well, you know, you take a urine

5

specimen, and I think physicians can look for any number

6

of things in the urine specimen.

7

specific procedure, and I don't think looking for drugs

8

requires any different sort of procedure than to look for

9

any number of other things in the urine sample.

10
11

MS. SMITH:

Each one requires a

Well, it requires a separate test,

Your Honor.

12

QUESTION:

13

MS. SMITH:

14

QUESTION:

A separate -Is that what you mean, or -No.

I had thought that you could use

15

a urine sample and test for any number of things with that

16

sample.

17

MS. SMITH:

That's true, yes, you can test

19

QUESTION:

And one of them would be drugs.

20

MS. SMITH:

18

for --

And one of them would be drugs, but

21

it's a specific extra step that's not done unless you meet

22

the criteria, and unless you want to use arrest as

23

leverage.

24
25

QUESTION:

You mean, so far as this procedure

was concerned?
15

1

MS. SMITH:

2

QUESTION:

As far as this policy goes.
Okay, but those criteria would be the

3

same criteria that would determine whether it was likely

4

that this woman was endangering her health and the health

5

of the child.

6
7

Are the criteria any different?

MS. SMITH:

after the policy was instituted.

8

QUESTION:

9

MS. SMITH:

10

Well, the criteria were changed

QUESTION:

Well, that doesn't -And there's -Are the criteria any different from

11

what would be reasonable criteria to determine whether the

12

woman was at risk because of drug use or was endangering

13

the fetus because of drug use?

14

MS. SMITH:

15

Absolutely.

They are not reasonable

criteria, Your Honor --

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. SMITH:

Why?
-- and the experts have testified

18

that criteria like inadequate prenatal care, lay prenatal

19

care, preterm labor, these are medical complications of

20

pregnancy --

QUESTION:

MS. SMITH:

24
25

Why doesn't the --- or they're more apt to be

indicators of poverty than they are of drug use.
QUESTION:

Well, why doesn't that put the woman

and the child at greater risk -16

1

MS. SMITH:

2

QUESTION:

For drug use?
-- that there's been inadequate

3

prenatal care?

4

dangerous for the woman and the child.

5

I mean, the drug use would be all the more

MS. SMITH:

It may have put her at greater risk

6

for other -- not having gotten prenatal care, but it

7

didn't give us any reasonable suspicion, reasonable

8

grounds, probable cause, whatever level of individualized

9

suspicion you're looking for --

10

QUESTION:

Ms. Smith, may I go back --

11

QUESTION:

May I ask, Ms. Smith, was this the

12

same program instituted at any other hospital?

MS. SMITH:

City of Charleston?

16

MS. SMITH:

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. SMITH:

I'm sorry, Your Honor.
What about the other hospitals in the

No other hospitals -Do they follow the same procedures?
No, Your Honor and, in fact, that's

19

one of the things that shows the discretion.

20

enforcement officers in this case went to the one public

21

hospital, joined with doctors at the one public hospital

22

to enforce this policy.

23

at the private hospitals, and they did not --

24
25

QUESTION:

The law

They did not enforce this policy

Well, you're saying they didn't have

the arrangement with law enforcement at other hospitals.
17

1

MS. SMITH:

2

QUESTION:

That's right.
But you're not saying that other

3

hospitals as a matter of course ignored the possibility,

4

if they had reason to suspect it, they ignored the

5

possibility of drug use among pregnant women.

6

MS. SMITH:

QUESTION:

8

MS. SMITH:

9

QUESTION:

10

MS. SMITH:

Nobody at another hospital -We -That's right, Your Honor -Yes, okay.
-- but nobody at another hospital

11

searched their patients in order to use arrest as

12

leverage.

13

QUESTION:

Ms. Smith --

14

QUESTION:

Well, all right, but it's the arrest

15

as leverage then.

16

MS. SMITH:

17

QUESTION:

Mm-hmm.
If the doctor -- as I understand it,

18

if the doctor, acting without any prearrangement with the

19

police --

20

MS. SMITH:

21

QUESTION:

Mm-hmm.
-- had said, I think we have reason

22

to worry about drug use in this patient, test the urine to

23

see if there is an indication of drug use, and the

24

hospital had done so, they had found such an indication, I

25

take it in your judgment there would be no constitutional
18

1

problem if they then called the police and said, we have

2

evidence that patient X is using drugs.

3

MS. SMITH:

And I think the reason why, Your

4

Honor, is because there's probable cause there.

5

be a lower level of suspicion, depending on the

6

circumstances, to report to a civil authority like a

7

Department of Social Services.

QUESTION:

There may

Your Honor, the same reasoning -We're doing urinalyses anyway, we're

MS. SMITH:

The same reasoning would apply to

We're

Now, you know, it's hard

1

to treat the woman and the child properly, we're going to

2

give a urinalysis to everyone who comes in for drug use.

3

MS. SMITH:

But they can't -- the difference

4

here, Your Honor, is that they set out to target certain

5

people, to test certain people in order to use arrest as

6

leverage, not simply for medical purposes any more, and

7

the criteria, the list of criteria is a discretionary list

8

of criteria that's now being applied in the context of a

9

police search, which is what made Delaware v. Prouse an

10
11

improper program.
QUESTION:

What's hard for me is to figure out

12

what you mean by this leverage point.

13

have a community with a high incidence of tuberculosis.

14

MS. SMITH:

15

QUESTION:

The -- imagine you

Mm-hmm.
Is there anything wrong with doctors

16

saying, you know, we're just going to regularly test our

17

pregnant women to see if they have it?

18

MS. SMITH:

19

QUESTION:

Without their consent?
There -- you feel -- I don't know --

20

the consent's a separate issue here, and I suppose that

21

doctors normally do get consent --

22

MS. SMITH:

If they were testing people --

23

QUESTION:

-- for the test anyway.

24

MS. SMITH:

If they were testing people for

25

medical purposes and they had consent to medical care,
20

1

then there's not a problem.

2

QUESTION:

Fine.

All right.

Now, suppose that

3

the same -- it's not tuberculosis, but it's simply drug

4

use.

5

MS. SMITH:

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. SMITH:

8

QUESTION:

10

MS. SMITH:

11

QUESTION:

It's not -- it is a problem, Your

But I'm -- just follow my reasoning.
Yes, I'm sorry.
All we're doing is testing the woman.

For tuberculosis it's okay, right, with consent?

13
14

Okay.

Honor, if the purpose of the search --

9

12

Right.

MS. SMITH:

If it's medical treatment, yes.

Yes.

15

QUESTION:

16

MS. SMITH:

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. SMITH:

-- and there's consent to do that,

QUESTION:

Now, if the doctor discovers in the

19
20

Same with drug use.
If it's medical treatment -All right, fine.

yes.

21

course of a test that the person's about to commit a

22

crime, he can report it to the police, right?

23

MS. SMITH:

At that point he has probable cause

24

or individualized suspicion.

25

QUESTION:

All right.
21

So if you're that far

1

down the road --

2

MS. SMITH:

3

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.
-- then you give the test, you

4

discover the result, and now you report it to the police,

5

and you're saying all that's okay, and so if there's

6

something -- if you're saying all that's okay, what's

7

different about this case?

8
9
10

MS. SMITH:

What's different here is that the

search was conducted without probable cause.
QUESTION:

Those are conclusions, but what I

11

want to know is, what's different from -- what happened in

12

the world that's different from what I just said?

13

MS. SMITH:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

What s happened -They give the test, they discover

there's the drug use, and they report it to the police.
MS. SMITH:

What happened that's different is

17

that different people are tested, because we have

18

discretionary criteria that are being applied in a law

19

enforcement setting, so we have --

20

QUESTION:

Well, let me ask you this with

21

reference to this question of Justice Breyer.

I thought,

22

and correct me if I'm wrong, that the district court found

23

the hospital personnel conducted the urine drug screens

24

for medical purposes, wholly independent of an intent to

25

aid law enforcement efforts.

Now, has that been
22

1

determined to be an invalid finding?

2

MS. SMITH:

He instructed the jury, Your Honor,

3

that there was a dual purpose to the test, that as soon as

4

there was also a law enforcement search, then the field

5

changed, the search changed, and the Fourth Amendment

6

applied.

7

QUESTION:

But was there a finding at the -- by

8

the district court that it was conducted for medical

9

purposes, independent of the intent to aid law

10

enforcement?

11

MS. SMITH:

In the context of jury instructions,

12

where he then said these were conducted for both purposes,

13

Your Honor, yes.

14

QUESTION:

Did you, or did your counsel at the

15

trial level if it wasn't you, ever ask for a finding by

16

court or jury that any of the criteria used to determine

17

the urine -- that this test would be made of the urine

18

samples was not a criterion that was medically

19

appropriate?

20

MS. SMITH:

I don't believe there was a request

21

for a finding, but there certainly was medical testimony

22

on that fact, Your Honor, from Ira Chasnoff, from Dr.

23

Chasnoff.

24
25

QUESTION:

But we don't have any finding on it

by court, or by implication of the jury verdict, one way
23

1

or the other?

2

MS. SMITH:

3

QUESTION:

4

MS. SMITH:

5

QUESTION:

6

Okay.
The jury verdict -Ms. Smith, I wish you would clarify

one point --

7

MS. SMITH:

8

QUESTION:

9

That's right, Your Honor.

Okay.
-- because it's gotten terribly

confused here.

10

MS. SMITH:

11

QUESTION:

Okay.
I thought that you said the only

12

thing that's wrong with this program was that it was

13

driven -- it was a means that the police were using to

14

apprehend people engaged in criminal conduct.

15

answer to my question, I thought, if a doctor's just

16

testing for drugs so they'll know how to treat the woman

17

and the child, that's okay.

18

and gave it to the Social Service people, that's okay.

19

all of that is okay, and we shouldn't, I think, go back

20

and qualify that unless you mean to.

21

You said in

If the doctors took that test
So

I thought when you started out you said this was

22

a program driven by the police.

23

getting people who had taken drugs.

24

MS. SMITH:

25

QUESTION:

It was their way of
That's one thing.

Mm-hmm.
So I thought you said that's what
24

1

makes -- infects this whole thing.

2

police driving it, it would be okay for medical purposes

3

and for social welfare purposes.

4

position?

5

MS. SMITH:

If you didn't have the

Now, is that your

That is my position, Your Honor, and

6

I didn't mean to change from that.

7

clarify why I thought it was okay, and not a Fourth

8

Amendment violation, to then turn it over once you have

9

some evidence and you can meet the standards of the Fourth

10

Amendment.

11

All I meant to do was

But it s a different -QUESTION:

Did the police approach the hospital,

12

or did the hospital approach the police to set this

13

program in --

14

MS. SMITH:

The original call that went, Your

15

Honor, was from the hospital to the police, but then it

16

was a very preliminary inquiry, and a task force was

17

formed consisting of members of all the departments, and

18

the task force was actually chaired by law enforcement, by

19

the Chief of Police and by the Solicitor, and the policy

20

as first written was written by law enforcement, by the

21

police.

22
23

QUESTION:

But the initiative came from the

hospital.

24

MS. SMITH:

25

QUESTION:

The question -The police didn't show up at the
25

1

hospital one day and say, you know, we'd like to find some

2

way to bust your patients here.

3

MS. SMITH:

4

QUESTION:

No.

The --

It was somehow the doctors who were

5

concerned that there was a problem with drug use by

6

pregnant women.

7

MS. SMITH:

The question -- that's right, Your

8

Honor.

The question originally came from the hospital to

9

the police, but the answer, the answer of how to cope with

10

this came from the police, and they wrote the policy, and

11

they taught the hospital how to maintain the chain of

12

evidence at the beginning of the search for people who

13

fell within a list of discretionary criteria, and they

14

enforced this policy at this one hospital and not at any

15

other hospital.

16

QUESTION:

Okay --

17

QUESTION:

Suppose I thought that there were

18

probable --

19
20

QUESTION:
hospitals?

21

MS. SMITH:

22

QUESTION:

23

-- could extend the policy to other

I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Was there ever any effort made to

extend the policy to other hospitals?

24

MS. SMITH:

25

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, there was not.
Was there any explanation why not?
26

1

MS. SMITH:

2

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, there was not.
I take it that had there not been the

3

formality of the prearrangement, the agreement with the

4

police, that the result would be different in this case.

5

In other words, if they had made the phone call

6

and the police hadn't said, yeah, the way to do it is to

7

maintain the chain of custody and so on, on your own

8

reasoning there would be no constitutional violation in

9

this case.

10

MS. SMITH:

I think that's true, Your Honor, but

11

the purpose of the warrant requirement -- at least for the

12

people who tested positive and they then were reported,

13

but for the people who didn't test positive and who were

14

searched, we don't know who those people were, there was

15

certainly a constitutional violation there, because they

16

were being searched for -- no, I'm sorry, Your Honor, I'm

17

wrong.

18

QUESTION:

19

MS. SMITH:

Okay.
Because they weren't being searched

20

for law enforcement purposes.

21

QUESTION:

22

MS. SMITH:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

So there's -- there -You're right.
It is simply the agreement, in

effect -MS. SMITH:

It's the agreement, and -27

1

3

QUESTION:

-- that makes the difference between

constitutionality and unconstitutionality.
MS. SMITH:

And it's a list of discretionary

4

criteria being applied by police officers.

5

difference between Delaware v. Prouse and Sitz.

6

QUESTION:

It's the

No, but I mean, as I understand --

7

maybe I misunderstood your answer to Justice Ginsburg a

8

minute ago.

9

component of this scheme that taints it, and I understood

You said in so many words it's the police

10

that to at least imply sort of the same point that I was

11

getting at with my question, that there's no finding here,

12

there's no reason for -- we cannot assume here that the

13

criteria for taking samples or for testing samples were

14

criteria that were not medically appropriate.

15

Maybe not all of them were used before, but we

16

have to -- I think we have to assume, as the case comes to

17

us and as you present your argument, that the reasons the

18

hospital used for determining that a sample would be taken

19

and the criteria for testing that sample for drug presence

20

were medically appropriate criteria.

21

MS. SMITH:

Well, there's no finding on that

22

from the district court, and the only testimony shows that

23

it's a list of discretionary criteria that is not liable

24

to really find people who use cocaine --

25

QUESTION:

So when you say that in so many words
28

1

it's the police component of the scheme that taints it,

2

what you mean to say is that part of the very -- the very

3

determination of whether to test or not was modified from

4

a medically appropriate set of criteria to at least a

5

partial law enforcement set of criteria.

6

argument?

7

9

MS. SMITH:

QUESTION:
MS. SMITH:

11

QUESTION:

13

I think the difference is, Your

Honor, that the --

10

12

Is that your

No, but wait a minute.
Yes.
I want to understand you.

Yes or no,

is that your argument?
MS. SMITH:

I think it's not quite my argument,

14

because the issue I think is that the discretion when it's

15

used by a doctor for medical purposes -- doctors have

16

discretion and that may be appropriate in the context of

17

medicine, but once discretion is used by police officers

18

for a law enforcement purpose, the world changes.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. HOOD

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

7
8

MR. HOOD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

9

The issue presented is whether urine drug

10

screens for medical purposes were reasonable under the

11

special needs doctrine and as consensual searches.

12

QUESTION:

May I just, at that very point, I

13

thought we had to assume for purposes of analyzing this

14

issue that there was no consent.

15

MR. HOOD:

16

consent at trial.

17

consented.

Your Honor, we raised the issue of
We proved that each and every plaintiff

The jury found they consented.

18

QUESTION:

The jury found consent.

19

MR. HOOD:

Yes, sir.

20

QUESTION:

But then in affirming the jury

21

verdict the court of appeals did not reach the issue of

22

consent and said --

23

MR. HOOD:

Correct.

24

QUESTION:

-- and in fact held that even if

25

there were no consent, these searches were proper under
30

1

the special needs doctrine, is that not right?

2

MR. HOOD:

Yes, Justice Stevens.

3

QUESTION:

So don't we have to assume for

4

purposes of analyzing the legal issue that there was no

5

consent, and if there's an issue to be -- if we disagreed

6

with the court of appeals, in other words, we'd send it

7

back to say whether there was evidence supporting the jury

8

verdict.

9

MR. HOOD:

Well, sir, I don't agree with that,

10

because I believe under the United States v. New York

11

Telephone Company, decided in 1977, the Court is not

12

limited to affirm on an issue that is not really --

13

QUESTION:

Well, no, we could affirm --

14

MR. HOOD:

Yes, sir.

15

QUESTION:

-- on the ground that there was

16

consent, but the special needs -- and then we wouldn't

17

need to reach the issue of special needs.

18

MR. HOOD:

Correct.

19

QUESTION:

But if we were to confront the issue

20

of special needs, we do that on the assumption that we

21

don't have to decide whether there was consent or not,

22

which is tantamount as a matter of law to saying we

23

assume, in analyzing this issue, that there was no

24

consent.

25

MR. HOOD:

Correct, and that's what the Fourth
31

1

Circuit did, Your Honor.

2

The policy purpose was to prevent pregnant women

3

from using cocaine.

4

QUESTION:

How did that work when the woman in

5

question was no longer pregnant, had given birth to the

6

child, and was taken from the hospital just after birth?

7

You can't prevent anything when a child is born.

8
9

As I understand it, most of these plaintiffs
were women who did not come in for prenatal care, but were

10

tested at the time they came into the hospital to give

11

birth, and then one day after the birth were removed to

12

the jail.

13

arrests took place after a child was born?

14

Is that not the case, that most of these

MR. HOOD:

No, Your Honor.

Most of them were

15

not after birth.

16

were before the policy became the protocol of Medical

17

University, so what was going on with those four was, they

18

were turned over to substance abuse, or DSS.

19

were tested positive for cocaine, it was child abuse.

20

protocol went into --

21

Several of the women -- four of them

I may have misspoken when I said

24

the day after the child was born?

Yes, Your Honor, there were.

QUESTION:

Was that part of the showing, that

these children were, in fact, brain damaged?

12

MR. HOOD:

I didn't hear the premise.

13

QUESTION:

Was there a determination that the

14

child was, in fact, brain damaged in any of these cases?

15

As I understand it --

16

MR. HOOD:

If we didn't have time --

17

QUESTION:

-- no one inspected the child.

18

MR. HOOD:

-- for the life of the policy, to

19

answer that question, we didn't do the follow-up studies

20

with these individuals, 10 individuals.

21

But of these 10, only five of them were actually

22

under the protocol adopted by the board of trustees of

23

Medical University on November 27, 1989 and each of those

24

five signed a letter, when they tested positive, from the

25

Solicitor that said, I understand that if I test positive
33

1

again, I will be arrested and I will be prosecuted.

2

They went home.

They came back a week, or two,

3

or three later, tested positive again, Justice Ginsburg

4

and yes, they were arrested.

5

only for the illegal crime of using cocaine themselves,

6

but for what they were doing to their child, and they knew

7

they were going to be arrested in each instance.

8
9

QUESTION:

They were put in jail, not

But I thought that was irrelevant in

the case, because you -- perhaps I have the facts wrong,

10

but I thought they were women who did not come in before,

11

who came in to give birth, tested positive, the only thing

12

that they signed was the kind of consent form that we all

13

file when we go to the hospital for a procedure --

14

MR. HOOD:

Well, Your Honor, the -- one or two

15

of the women meet that category, and those women were

16

before the Medical University board adopted this protocol.

17

The protocol was medical.

The doctors wrote the protocol.

18

There were nine criteria.

The district court found that

19

those criteria were medically valid and good.

20

The district court found that as to consent, we

21

had to make one step further than that Solicitor letter.

22

We had to show that each of those 10 plaintiffs knew that

23

they could be arrested.

24

that.

MR. HOOD:

MR. HOOD:

Yes, Your Honor.

like, we can go through each one of these individuals, and

to say about special needs and what the Fourth Circuit did

The Solicitor asked the other

MR. HOOD:

yes.

21

And they did not, they did not adopt

such a policy.

MR. HOOD:

Correct.

23

QUESTION:

Because of the pending lawsuit here.

24

MR. HOOD:

Yes, Your Honor.

25

QUESTION:

Well, we don't know why.
36

I mean, you

1

can --

QUESTION:

You said that was the reason.

3

MR. HOOD:

I can't -- there's no testimony in

the record to answer your question, but --

QUESTION:

Yes, so you're -- you're making --

6

MR. HOOD:

-- if I could be allowed to testify,

7

I believe that's the reason.

8

QUESTION:

9

There's also no testimony in the

record that any other hospital was approached.

10

MR. HOOD:

Your Honor, there is a reference on

11

page 1128 where there's testimony, Justice Scalia, about

12

David Swacky, the Solicitor at the time, approaching Roper

13

Hospital.

14

QUESTION:

And Roper Hospital refusing.

15

MR. HOOD:

Not as to what they did, just that

16
17

they were considering it.
QUESTION:

Then the lawsuit came along.

Did Roper Hospital have any

18

comparable protocol of testing, not of informing the

19

Department or the police, but did they have any comparable

20

protocol for testing pregnant women prior to the time they

21

were approached by the Solicitor?

22

MR. HOOD:

Justice Souter, Roper Hospital is a

23

charitable hospital owned by doctors, and there are no

24

other State-owned hospitals in Charleston where --

25

QUESTION:

I don't care whether it's State37

1

owned or not.

2

medical appropriateness, or the lack of an indication of

3

medical appropriateness for what was being done here, and

4

my question is, if you know, or if it's in the record, is

5

there any indication that Roper Hospital was following

6

some kind of a protocol for treating for drug use among

7

pregnant patients before they were approached by the

8

Solicitor?

9

The point I'm trying to get at is the

MR. HOOD:

The answer is yes.

Every hospital in

10

South Carolina follows the child abuse statute.

11

doctors are absolutely required to.

12
13

QUESTION:

The

Well, the child abuse statute, as I

understand it, requires reporting.

14

MR. HOOD:

Correct.

15

QUESTION:

But does the child abuse statute

16

impose a protocol of medical testing on doctors who treat

17

pregnant women?

18

MR. HOOD:

No, it does not.

19

QUESTION:

Okay.

So what is the indication that

20

at Roper Hospital they were following a protocol of

21

testing urine for drug use when a pregnant woman came in?

22

What's the record tell us?

23

MR. HOOD:

There's nothing in this record --

24

QUESTION:

Okay.

25

drugs in any hospital, hopefully in this country, they

QUESTION:

Well, I'm --

13

MR. HOOD:

-- so they can treat the patient

QUESTION:

I expect that is so, but the protocol

14
15

properly.

16

here went far beyond a particularized suspicion as a

17

reason for doing -- running that urine test, and I take it

18

that the answer, and I don't want to spend a lot more time

19

on this, but I take the answer is, the record does not

20

tell us whether Roper Hospital was following any kind of a

21

comparable protocol of testing most urine samples of most

22

women coming in for prenatal care, is that correct?

23

MR. HOOD:

Correct, Your Honor.

24

QUESTION:

Okay.

25

One last question.

You

indicated that there were findings or determinations of
39

1

some sort with respect to the hospital in this case that

2

the criteria were medically appropriate.

3

those determinations?

Where do we find

4

MR. HOOD:

By the district judge himself.

5

QUESTION:

What did -- did he make specific

6

findings of fact?

7

MR. HOOD:

Yes, sir.

Judge C. Winston, our

8

senior district judge in South Carolina, on page 1415 of

9

the joint appendix states, Medical University adopted

10

these medically valid criteria to avoid the very

11

subjective test about which the plaintiffs complain.

12

Judge Houck, at the conclusion of this 5-week

13

trial, made very -- and it's in those pages, the 1400

14

numbers -- about each and every issue that was raised in

15

this case.

16

think this Court requires.

17

jury that each person understood that their -- if they

18

tested positive, they would be arrested.

19

He took us one step further on consent than I

QUESTION:

He required us to convince the

And that -- but that -- the -- far as

20

the consent is concerned, it was an argument which, as you

21

said, the Eleventh Circuit didn't address, that there was

22

insufficient evidence of that consent, and I looked at the

23

consent form.

24
25

It doesn't say anything about police.

MR. HOOD:

The consent form says, I consent to

having -- to the testing of drugs, and there are two
40

1

consent forms, one in the hospital, one in the clinic.

2

They both say the same thing.

3

Every patient signed that.

Then, when they suspected under this nine

4

medical diagnoses, these differential diagnoses, that the

5

patient was using cocaine, then a counselor met with the

6

patient, showed her a video, explained to her the

7

consequences, the dire, staggering consequences to her

8

child and herself of using cocaine, basically pled with

9

her to stop doing it, got her to sign this Solicitor

10

letter, and sent her to substance abuse, and if she went,

11

great, and that's what happened to 90 percent of them.

12

QUESTION:

What happened to the people who

13

didn't come in for prenatal care, who came in at the time

14

of labor, and -- well, you tell me -- and tested?

15

MR. HOOD:

If they tested positive they were

16

given what I just said, and --

17

QUESTION:

Well, tell me when they were given

18

that, because it seems it would be rather stressful

19

situation in which to try to get informed consent from

20

someone.

21

MR. HOOD:

Well, you have to put it in the

22

context of what was going on.

23

is because it was mandatory.

24

directors adopted a protocol that was mandatory and

25

nondiscretionary, once you met that criteria, those

The reason they were told
The hospital board of

41

1

medical criteria.

2

QUESTION:

Yes, well, you're stepping over to

3

another question.

The one I asked concerned the argument

4

that the Eleventh Amendment didn't address the sufficiency

5

of the evidence of consent, and I was simply suggesting to

6

you that there might be a question of the sufficiency of

7

evidence of consent in the case of women who never came to

8

the hospital for prenatal care, who came in while they

9

were in labor, and what they consented to, what they

10

signed at that point, there might be reason to suspect the

11

legitimacy, the informed nature, the voluntary nature of

12

such consent.

That's all I meant to indicate.

13

MR. HOOD:

Yes, Your Honor.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Hood, I can't find your --

15

QUESTION:

Well, I thought that we established

16

that we take this on the assumption there was no consent.

17

The court of appeals didn't address it, and for purposes

18

of deciding special needs we just assume no consent.

19

Isn't that correct?

20

right?

21
22

MR. HOOD:
was not consent.

You already admitted that.

Is that

No, Your Honor, I don't concede there

In fact, I argued --

No.

No, you misunderstand me.

I'm sorry.

which we granted certiorari, special needs exception --

2

MR. HOOD:

Yes, Your Honor.

3

QUESTION:

4

that there was no consent, because consent was not

Amendment.

Am I wrong?
MR. HOOD:

You're correct, Your Honor, in that
43

1

certiorari was granted on one issue, and that is correct.

2

QUESTION:

Yes, okay, and on that issue what

3

support in our case law do you find that supports a

4

special needs exception where law enforcement is tangled

5

up with the search?

6

have so held?

7

MR. HOOD:

Is there any case of ours where we

Your Honor, each of the special needs

8

cases apply directly, starting with the opinion of the

9

Court in TLO and Your Honor's own concurring opinion

10

there, with Justice Powell.

11

QUESTION:

Yes, well, we reserved the answer to

12

the question in TLO, whether it would be the same answer

13

if law enforcement were involved.

14

MR. HOOD:

We then jump to the Griffin case from

15

Wisconsin, the Sitz case, and in those opinions law

16

enforcement was involved, and in our case the role of --

24

do with the search.

25

QUESTION:

They had nothing to

Well, I thought the procedure was
44

1

developed with the assistance of the police, in part, to

2

ascertain whether there was drug use so that people could

3

be charged.

4

MR. HOOD:

That's the other side's argument.

5

That was not the proven facts.

6

QUESTION:

The facts --

As I'm thinking about this at the

7

moment on this exact point, that if you have an

8

unconsented turning over of private medical information to

9

the police, there must be something special about the

10
11

circumstance.
Now, the AMA, and the most famous case in this

12

area, called Tarisoff, both try to define that

13

circumstance, and that circumstance, as the AMA, or as

14

Tarisoff defined it, involves when a patient threatens to

15

inflict serious bodily harm to herself or a third party

16

and there is a reasonable possibility that the patient

17

will carry out that threat, so I thought that you either

18

have to bring yourself within that exception, or you lose,

19

and what I'm worried about at the moment is how can you

20

bring yourself within that exception when you're faced

21

with all the material in the amicus briefs and all the

22

studies that suggest that this type of program does not

23

help third parties, namely the fetus.

24
25

Rather, there is a question as to how much
cocaine abuse hurts the fetus, particularly compared to
45

1

the situation where the mother does not request prenatal

2

care, and that this kind of program, because of the later

3

problem, the latter problem, probably hurts more fetuses

4

than it helps.

5

Now, faced with that kind of data, and I see no

6

data on the other side, I don't see how you can bring

7

yourself within the Tarisoff exception, and if you can't

8

do that, I don't see how you win the case.

9

question.

10
11

MR. HOOD:

That's my

Your Honor, we come within the

requirements that you have outlined.

12

QUESTION:

Mm-hmm, all right.

You come within

13

Tarisoff.

Then you're arguing that you're within

14

Tarisoff.

Fine.

15

data that -- you know, that they refer to in the amicus

16

briefs, that -- and I've tried to look up a little

17

independently, where I've come to is the conclusion -- I'm

18

not a doctor or an epidemiologist, but it seems to me that

19

the studies on cocaine abuse are pretty inconclusive

20

and -- as to how they affect the fetus, and even if they

21

aren't, they're pretty one-sided, the studies, that this

22

kind of thing hurts the fetus because mothers don't come

23

in.

24
25

How do you get there, given this mass of

1

QUESTION:

It seems there were a lot of doctors,

2

then, violating South Carolina law if only in this one

3

hospital were doctors engaged in this practice, and that's

4

a little odd.

5

They wouldn't need this protocol, and they

6

wouldn't need these meetings with law enforcement people,

7

if the law in fact required when they test, and one of the

8

things they test for is drugs, that they turn over that

9

information, but as far as this record shows it's only

10

this one hospital, and only pursuant to the protocol, so

11

that doesn't fit in with your statement that -- in answer

12

to some questions that yes, the doctors have an obligation

13

to and they do.

14

Is there anything to show that apart from this

15

one hospital and pursuant to this one protocol, that

16

doctors who find pregnant women testing positive for drugs

17

are turning over that information to the police?

18

MR. HOOD:

Justice Ginsburg, I believe, and I

19

can't cite a page, that several of the experts that we put

20

on the stand in the 5-week trial said just that.

21

you have to look at the patient base that this hospital,

22

came up at trial, but -- except to the extent that this

was a teaching hospital, and every young physician in the

OB department was taught about that.

Did they say it to any other

obstetrician-gynecologist, as far as the record shows it

19

seems to me you would have certainly put that into the

20

record if it existed, but what comes to us is one

21

hospital, and -- with the nurse who asked if we could

22

get -- can we get the police involved.

23

shred of any indication that other hospitals -- this is

24

the law.

25

There's not one

The law requires them to do it.
MR. HOOD:

Justice Ginsburg, the question that
50

1

you're asking me was not raised at trial by anyone, nor

2

answered by anyone at trial, but the answer to your

3

question is, we have, like every State, a child abuse

4

statute, and if a doctor in any practice observes child

5

abuse, they have an affirmative duty to report it.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Hood, would you comment on this

7

point?

With minor variations, I think we're pretty much

8

agreed that if in the normal course a doctor obtains the

9

evidence that a patient is about to commit some kind of

10

imminent violence or damage to another person, or if a

11

doctor obtains evidence such as gunshot evidence which

12

clearly points to a crime, that the doctor is permitted

13

and obligated to turn that evidence over to the police and

14

the police can use it.

15

Start with that premise.

The argument that I want you to comment on is

16

this.

That kind of a rule was derived in situations in

17

which the doctors are simply going about their business,

18

acting independently as physicians.

19

however, the doctors, as a result of their arrangements

20

with the police, had become in effect agents of the

21

police, and they were acting in a dual capacity.

In this case,

22

They had their medical responsibilities, but

23

they were acting under an agreement with the police to

24

look for certain things and to turn over information if

25

they found it, and the argument is that in that case the
51

1

police should not be able to use the evidence unless the

2

evidence has been searched for and seized in accordance

3

with the same rules that the police would have to follow

4

if they were doing it in the first place because

5

otherwise, in effect, the co-option of the medical

6

community will eliminate the Fourth Amendment whenever the

7

police can use the doctors.

8

10

MR. HOOD:
the hospital.

What's your response to that?

The police were never the agent of

The police were purely a means or method.

QUESTION:

Well, let's assume that we found --

11

let's just assume that we found, as a kind of a

12

constitutional fact on this record, that an agency

13

relationship had been established.

14

to the argument?

15

MR. HOOD:

What is your response

We strenuously objected it was

16

established.

If it were established to the satisfaction

17

of anyone, and I don't believe it was at trial or at the

18

Fourth Circuit, then the role of the police, they are not

2

QUESTION:

I think what you're arguing is that

3

there's no basis for finding that kind of agency here, but

4

if we make the assumption that there is a basis, what is

5

your response to the argument that in that case the

6

criteria for police receipt and use of evidence has got to

7

be the criteria that would apply even if the doctors

8

weren't involved because otherwise the Fourth Amendment

9

gets swallowed up in the agency relationship?

10

MR. HOOD:

That the Fourth Amendment doesn't

11

apply, that the Court adopt the case of Attson from the

12

Ninth Circuit, wherein it said the dual purpose applies,

13

and if there are two purposes and one's medical and one's

14

not --

15

QUESTION:

No, but this --

16

MR. HOOD:

-- it's okay.

17

QUESTION:

Okay, and so your answer -- I mean, I

18

guess I don't understand the argument.

19

there's a way to say that the dual relationship doesn't

20

affect it, but is there a good reason for us not to fear

21

that this agency kind of relationship will swallow up the

22

Fourth Amendment standards that otherwise the police would

23

have to satisfy?

points, Your Honor.
54

Three brief

1

What distinguishes this policy from a medical

2

protocol is that it was designed by and for law

3

enforcement, and implemented by the hospital for the

4

purposes of crime detection.

5

To say that the medical criteria was medically

6

appropriate, as I said, is different from saying that it

7

establishes probable cause or individualized suspicion, or

8

allows the hospital officials therefore to search, as

9

agents of the police, under a police policy that

10

incorporates criminal sanctions for evidence of a crime,

11

and to turn that right over to the police.

12

And if it was probable cause, if they had

13

probable cause here, why not obtain a warrant?

14

test your criteria with an objective magistrate to ensure

15

that you're not the discretion that's allowed in those

16

criteria is not being abused.

17

Why not

That's the purpose of the warrant requirement,

18

is to protect against that kind of abusive discretion, and

19

that's exactly the discretion we see that was used in this

20

policy, where women who met the criteria were not tested,

21

and women who didn't meet the criteria, perhaps, in some

22

cases were.

23

the criteria weren't tested.

24
25

We don't know.

We do know that some who met

In terms of the finding of fact, in the title VI
opinion the court, in addressing the policy as a whole,
55

1

talks about the goal of the policy, the ultimate goal of

2

the policy, but when he's looking, when the trial judge

3

looked at the purpose of the search, he recognized the

4

dual nature of that searched -- search, that there was a

5

medical purpose and a law enforcement purpose, and that's

6

what brought this search under the Fourth Amendment, and

7

that's what makes this policy so insidious.

8
9

What happened here is that
the doctors used the promise of confidentiality in the

10

private

11

physician-patient relationship to obtain information from

12

their patients in order to turn it over to the police.

13

That's all they did here, and when they did

14

that, when they took on the mantle of the police, they had

15

to obtain a warrant based on probable cause, and they had

16

to do that for all the reasons this Court enunciated in

17

the special needs doctrine, when it limits that doctrine

18

so that discretion will not invade police actions, so that

19

Delaware v. Prouse is not okay, Sitz is, because of that

20

discretion.

21

And that's why, even if this Court were to apply

22

the balancing test here, we've got a case that's got

23
