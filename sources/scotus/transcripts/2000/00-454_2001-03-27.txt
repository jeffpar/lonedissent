ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES G. COLE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

11

MR. COLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case presents the question of whether an

12

Indian tribe may tax a transaction between nonmembers on

13

fee land within the reservation.

14

held that nonmembers who are involved in an auto accident

15

on the equivalent of fee land are not subject to the

16

jurisdiction of tribal courts absent consent.

17

transaction between nonmembers on fee land is similarly

18

outside the tribe's jurisdiction because it does not

19

involve a consensual relationship with the tribe and does

20

not threaten tribal self-government.

QUESTION:

This Court has already

What precisely is the incidence of

MR. COLE:

Who was the tax on?
The incidence of the tax is on the

guests of the hotel.
QUESTION:

And they -- what?

2

MR. COLE:

Yes.

The hotel owner acts as a

3

collector.

4

owner would be held liable for the tax.

5

If it fails to collect, however, the hotel

QUESTION:

What if -- what if the tax were

6

imposed, or a tax were imposed on the hotel itself instead

7

of the guests?

8
9
10
11

MR. COLE:

We believe there would still be no

basis for the taxation on these facts.

It's still a

transaction between nonmembers on fee land.
QUESTION:

Is there -- does the hotel have to

12

get any license or permission from the tribe to operate

13

under the federal statutes governing Indian traders?

14

MR. COLE:

The hotel must have a license from

15

the Federal Government in order to trade with the members

16

of the tribe.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Even though in conducting the hotel

it isn't dealing with members of the tribe?
MR. COLE:

It needs that license to deal with

20

members of the tribe, but in dealing with nonmembers of

21

the tribe, the Federal regulatory scheme is not

22

applicable.

23

because there is no preemptive effect in dealing with

24

nonmembers.

25

This Court's tax cases illustrate that point,

Suppose it didn't deal with members

of the tribe.

It could still run the hotel without --

2

without getting any Federal license?

3

MR. COLE:

Yes, I think that's right.

QUESTION:

You think it -- you're not sure

5

that's right?

MR. COLE:
regulations, yes.

8

10

Well, I -- that's the way I read the

QUESTION:

Does it have to do with being within

the borders of the reservation, because even though it's
fee land, it is inside the reservation boundaries.

11

MR. COLE:

That's correct, Your Honor.

12

QUESTION:

But you don't know for sure whether

13

an Indian trader's license would be necessary for the

14

hotel, even if it were serving guests from outside the

15

tribe.

You're not certain about that?

16

MR. COLE:

No.

If all the hotel were doing, the

17

act of serving nonmembers of the tribe on fee land, it

18

would not need a license by virtue of the fact that it was

19

within the reservation.

20
21

QUESTION:

Is there on this hotel -- is it

subject to an Arizona room tax?

22

MR. COLE:

Yes, it is.

23

QUESTION:

Do you know what -- what would that

24
25

amount to?
MR. COLE:

Five point five percent from the

there is also -- this isn't in the record -- a local

Are there other hotels on this

8

MR. COLE:

Yes, there are, Your Honor.

9

QUESTION:

Are they also on fee land, or are

10

they on tribal land?

11
12

MR. COLE:

The record doesn't reflect the kind

of land that they're on, and I don't know all those facts.

13

QUESTION:

It seems to be a -- no, please --

14

QUESTION:

On that particular thing, it seemed

15

to me quite important, and I seem to be missing a fact.

16

If there is no other hotel on fee land, then your position

17

is stronger.

18

fact that you who don't have a connection is not the

19

answer because maybe everybody in your category has a lot

20

of connections with the tribe's services that they

21

provide.

If there are several, then I guess it's the

Well, I don't think this is decided,

Your Honor, on a generic basis across all the hotels.

MR. COLE:

Well, we don't have those facts in

It's not an equal

facts to show that there are no -- there's no consensual

true, too, if this hotel were on tribal land itself.

2

is that the distinction you're making -- that this happens

to be on fee land?

4

MR. COLE:

Yes.

5

QUESTION:

Would it be different?

6

MR. COLE:

Yes, it does make it different

7

because in building on tribal land they create a

relationship with the tribe.

the tribe controls, and it's a different situation.

They are on the land that

Even though they still can't vote,

and most of their guests are not members of the tribe.
MR. COLE:

Right.

But the point that I wanted

13

to make, Your Honor, is that because of this relationship

14

with people who can't vote, it's a sensitive issue.

15

this Court has developed some general rules that deal with

16

the relationship between the nonmembers and the tribe, and

17

those rules brought a distinction between fee land and

18

tribal lands as a way of setting to each group what its

19

rights would be.

of a lease or contractual document between the tribe and

2

the landowner, and the very fact of being on tribal land

3

means that the tribe would have power over the nonmember

4

in that situation.

5

This Court's decision in Montana, as I was

6

saying, supplied a general clear understandable rule for

7

nonmembers on the reservation.

reasoned that members of the tribe had inherent power to

govern themselves but could govern nonmembers only in

the background there.

1

That case dealt with what were then called the

2

five civilized tribes.

3

General opinions and judicial opinions that said that

4

those tribes had the power to exclude non-Indian intruders

5

from their lands and therefore had the power to impose a

6

licensing fee upon them if they decided to do business

7

within those lands.

8

century I'm talking about that ended in the late 1800s --

9

There were a number of Attorney

At the turn of the century, the last

as Congress began to open up those lands, it gave the

10

settlers the right to remain on their lands and

11

essentially not be excluded.

12

was a specific statutory and presidential and treaty

13

framework that dealt with the problem of the licensing

14

fees.

15

that any ordnance, including this ordnance that was

16

adopted by the tribe, would have to be approved by the

17

President, wasn't valid until it was.

18

But at the same time there

There was an Act called the Curtis Act which said

And then there was a treaty that followed when

19

they opened up the land and said there wouldn't be removal

20

that eliminated certain licensing fees and did not

21

eliminate others.

22

looked at that situation, and what it said is that we can

23

see from the surrounding laws and treaties an intent to

24

preserve that original power to charge the license fee for

25

these tribes.

In Morris v. Hitchcock, this Court

Hitchcock, and that theme is then picked up in Buster,

2

which is, yes, originally there was some inherent power

3

here coming from the ownership dominion over the land to

4

charge a license fee as a condition.

5

in this case, Congress by what it did, the President by

6

what he did, and the treaties by what they did, intended

7

to carry that forward and, therefore, the license fee is

8

still valid even as to settlers who can't be removed.

9

that's, I think, the best explanation.

might be permissible where a consensual relationship was

A consistent rule for all forms of tribal

jurisdiction, including taxation, is important from the

3

perspective of the nonmembers who invest in homes and

businesses on fee land within the reservation.

QUESTION:

May I just interrupt this?

How do

6

you work in the Jicarilla tax on the oil company into your

7

reasoning?

8

MR. COLE:

I'm sorry, Your Honor?

9

QUESTION:

The Jicarilla Merrion case -- how do

10

you fit that into this analysis?

11

MR. COLE:

Well Merrion was a case about, as you

12

said, the lease with the tribe, I guess, for drilling on

13

tribal trust lands -- that entire reservation was tribal

14

trust lands, and the Court said --

15

QUESTION:

Yes, and the outcome is they'd been

16

given a lease to take the oil out, so they did have a

17

property interest in the oil wells.

18

MR. COLE:

But that -- but the lease was with

19

the tribe, so they directly entered into a consensual

20

relation --

It was made before the tax was

there was a difference of views in that case.

2

the majority's holding with your position here.
MR. COLE:

The majority's holding was simply

3

that in signing that lease, the tribe did not give up its

4

power over -- dominion over its own trust land.

5

at one point in the opinion that there was no tribal

6

authority until the nonmember entered tribal lands or

7

engaged in business with the tribe.

8

its own terms, essentially excluded a situation where

9

someone was not on tribal trust lands.

10

QUESTION:

It said

So even that case, on

Mr. Cole -- no, I was being -- Mr.

11

Cole, you spoke a moment ago the fact that we had referred

12

to the possibility of a taxation exception as part of the

13

first Montana exception essentially arising from

14

consensual relationships.

15

certainly possible that a taxation exception might arise

16

under the second Montana category, and that brings me back

17

to something that has already come up, but I just want to

18

get clear on your position on it.

19

It strikes me that it's

Under the second exception in effect for the

20

integrity of tribal government, I think there's probably a

21

pretty fair argument that if the tribe is, in fact,

22

providing services, then the tribe ought to be able to tax

23

to pay for, in effect, a proportionate share of the costs

24

that those services cost the tribe.

there's a factual dispute in this case -- I realize from

the briefs -- about the extent of the services that the

tribe is providing.

position that your client gets no services whatsoever, or

4

no benefit of municipal services whatsoever from the

tribe?

6

MR. COLE:

My question is, do you take the

I would say that the benefits are

7

incidental, Your Honor, that the services are focused on

8

the Navajo population in this part of the reservation, and

9

there can be incidental benefits from that.

10
11

QUESTION:

But that --

The fact that there is generally law

and order and that sort of thing?

12

MR. COLE:

Exactly.

But that shouldn't be a

13

basis for taxation.

14

distinction between those situations in which the

15

nonmember on fee land requests the service from the tribe

16

-- for example, ambulance services.

17

reflects here that when ambulance service for a nonmember

is requested, the tribe charges for that.

be a consensual relationship and a voluntary request, and

that could be charged for.

QUESTION:

The hotel supplies its own --

2

MR. COLE:

It takes the water on its own land

3

from the river and returns it to the river, so it does not

4

receive water from the tribe.

5

QUESTION:

What about fire protection?

6

MR. COLE:

Well, there is a dispute in the

7

record about that.

There was only one fire, it was on an

8

employee housing unit, and ultimately fire engines came -

9

- both from the state and from a tribal source.

I think

10

that the answer is that when you have people living side

11

by side, you have a community of tribal members and you

12

have nonmembers as well, the nonmembers are paying state

13

taxes, sales taxes -- they're paying property taxes,

14

they're paying income taxes -- for the benefits of a

15

civilized society.

16

QUESTION:

But the same thing is true, it seems

17

to me, in many state relationships in which there is a

18

state police force, there's a county police force, there's

19

a local police force, and a given property tax owner is

20

paying taxes through various taxing mechanisms for all

21

three.

22

and maybe even a principal source -- of police, fire, or

23

whatnot protection available I don't think necessarily

24

leads to the conclusion that you shouldn't have to pay, as

25

it were, the portion of some -- for the same services by

So the fact that there may be another source --

an overlapping jurisdiction.

MR. COLE:

Well, each one of those would be a

3

full sovereign in its own right, and would be an entity in

4

which these citizens could participate --

QUESTION:

Well, it's true, but the assumption

of the question is that the Indian sovereignty is

sufficient to give it authority to provide fire services,

police services, and so on.

MR. COLE:

Well, certainly the tribe can provide

the services, but the nonmembers cannot participate in

13

tribal government.

14

QUESTION:

Could the tribe not provide the

services?

Could the tribe say, look, we're not going to

send our fire engines unless -- unless you agree to pay

17

for them just as you agreed to pay for the ambulance

one of which doesn't -- isn't large enough or populace

enough to have a fire department, and in my experience

very often the neighboring county will send their fire

that fashion.

QUESTION:

Well, since you say the tax is on the

2

guests at the hotel, and the hotel merely acts as a

3

conduit, then why was the -- why did the tribal court say

4

that the hotel owner was liable?

5

MR. COLE:

There is a specific statutory

6

provision which says that if the taxes are assessed

7

against the guests, that the hotel must pay.

8

if that's your question.

10

QUESTION:

I'm not sure

So it's statutory in the sense of

tribal regulation, or --

MR. COLE:

There -- it appears, I think, on page

12

105(a) of the petition appendix, if I recall correctly.

13

It said --

14

QUESTION:

Is it tribal, or Federal, or state?

15

MR. COLE:

It is tribal.

QUESTION:

Thank you.

QUESTION:

The state tax works the same way,

doesn't it?

but the hotel pays it to the state.

The tax -- the incidence is on the guests,

MR. COLE:

Yes.

Yes.

Isn't that so?

Well, I think that's

right, yes.
QUESTION:

So is the legal question here, do the

23

guests have a relationship with the tribe, or does the

24

hotel have a relationship with the tribe.

25

MR. COLE:

Which is it?

Well, I think that the central

question is, do the guests have the relationship, because

2

the incidence of the tax as Your Honor pointed out at the

3

outset falls on the guests.

4

QUESTION:

Well, you're not going to win very

5

much if that's what we hold -- the tribe will just go back

6

and impose the tax on the hotel.

7

MR. COLE:

And I -- and I --

8

QUESTION:

You really want us to address that

MR. COLE:

I think that the arguments that have

question?

10
11

been made by the other side may require this Court to

12

address it, because they have tried to reach the guests

13

through the activities of the hotel, and I think the

14

rationale for why the guests are not taxable is that a

15

transaction between nonmembers on fee land is not one over

16

which the tribe has jurisdiction.

And that also will

17

reach the hotel at the same time.

And I think that if we

18

permit taxation of the hotel based on incidental services,

19

we open the box to any kind of tax on all nonmembers,

20

because all of them, or anyone who's on the reservation,

No. This tribe doesn't have that

point that -- there is a sphere of Federal protection from

members are not being -- are not being charged state

Very well, Mr. Cole.

MR. GOMEZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

The question here today is whether the Navajo

14

you're talking about taxation, and the guests who come on

-- looking at the reason for taxation, taxation is

MR. GOMEZ:

You know, we think that the facts

here were more than ninety-nine percent of the land is

held in trust on the Navajo reservation.

about one percent of the land that you can't tax -- one

14

percent of the land that you can't impose taxes on, at

15

least when the land is controlled by non-Indians.

16

wouldn't it be the case that we'd be more likely to uphold

17

the tribe's ability to tax under the second of the Montana

18

exceptions where much of the reservation is in fee?

19

you would say that the tribe needs the money a lot more

20

from the fee land.

I don't -- you know, I just don't see

21

which way it cuts.

I'm not sure of the fact that a very

22

small portion of the land on this reservation is fee land,

23

that it helps your case rather than hurts it.

fair as possible so that when they pass a tax, everybody

2

that engages in that business has a responsibility of

3

paying that tax.

4

because it was less than one percent of the land was held

5

in fee, this would give these people an economic advantage

over all the other people who did pay the tax -- all the

other hotel operators who operate on the Navajo

reservation.

And if you were to hold that just

But I don't think any of our cases

the land is held in trust, or what might be fee land?

relationship?
MR. GOMEZ:

Well, it's my understanding that for

3

this operation to even engage in economic activity within

4

the exterior boundaries of the Navajo reservation, it is

5

required to obtain an Indian trader's license under the

6

Indian trader statutes and regulations -- a Navajo

7

business reservation license -- and that it cannot engage

8

in business in the absence of acquiring that license.

9

QUESTION:

But this is like a statute till

10

business -- it just couldn't trade with the Indians.

11

Isn't that right?

12

know, we will no longer buy from or sell to Indians, but

13

we'll continue to run our hotel, it wouldn't have to get

14

the Federal Indian trader license, would it?

I mean, if it gave -- if it said, you

MR. GOMEZ:

It is my reading that previously

16

this hotel operation or the store -- in fact, it's a

17

trading company -- challenged the Indian trader -- the

18

applicability of the Indian trader regulations in the

19

Ninth Circuit in a previous case, Ashcroft, and in that

20

case it was determined that they were required to obtain

21

an Indian trader's license even though they had just a

22

small amount of sales to tribal members.

Oh, I understand that, but suppose

Well, right, but the United States is

arguing that these statutes in this regulatory scheme

here -- mostly we've had a discussion of regulations, and

18

I won't go into the clarity of those regulations but, at

19

best, they are regulations -- they are not statutes.

20

And in order to have that, there has to be an
We don't have that

The other point I wanted to make was that when

5

we look at the second exception and whether there should

be some form of power that comes from the incidental

7

impacts of these tourists on the reservation, if we look

8

back at Strate, there this Court considered what was the

9

standard, and it was in effect on tribal self-government.

10

This Court looked at the possibility that accidents on the

11

reservation might create some health risks and certainly

12

would call on some tribal services, but that wasn't enough

13

to find that there would be tribal jurisdiction in those

14

circumstances.

15

Here we have these guests that travel on the

16

highway and end up in the hotel and, in effect, there is

17

less of a showing of an effect on the tribe, and there is

18

no showing of an effect on tribal self-government.

19

is a difficult area when we look at the possibility of a

20

tax being imposed by one government in which a group of

21

citizens can't participate, and we have a well-established

22

set of rules that deals with that in Montana and the cases

23

that have followed it.

that framework. Thank you.
