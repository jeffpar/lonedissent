ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MS. BANSAL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
At issue in the case is the meaning and scope of

11

the tolling provision applicable to the one-year statute

12

of limitations for Federal habeas cases enacted by

13

Congress in 1996 as part of the Anti-Terrorism and

14

Effective Death Penalty Act, or AEDPA.

15

provision states that in calculating the one-year statute

16

of limitations, the period during which a properly filed

17

application for state post-conviction or other collateral

18

review shall not be counted.

19

The tolling

The court below held that a prior filed Federal

20

habeas petition dismissed without prejudice and without

21

adjudication on the merits constituted an application for

22

state post-conviction or other collateral review.

23

contend that the language of the statute, the provision in

24

particular, the statute as a whole, and the policies

25

underlying AEDPA make the Second Circuit's ruling

2

First, with respect to the statute, the

3

particular provision at issue, it is notable that the only

4

sovereign entity mentioned in the phrase state post-

6

state or Federal, it is absolutely bizarre for Congress to

have suggested that Federal should be incorporated by the

word other.

In a

To hold that would be equivalent to saying

10

that Congress could enact a statute saying red, white, and

11

other colors of the flag.

Federal, it's simply illogical to assume that state or

13

other could stand for state or Federal.

QUESTION:

In fact, in other

They don't really contend that

16

it stands for state and Federal.

I think the concede that

17

it also stands for other state collateral review that is

18

not post-conviction review. I think they concede that in a

19

civil commitment case, for example, in which a habeas

20

action, a state habeas action is brought, that would be

21

covered by the other.

22

MS. BANSAL:

Yes, I believe that's correct.

But

23

in other parts of the statute, same provision of this

24

statute, Congress specifically stated state and Federal or

25

state or Federal when it meant to include both of them.

QUESTION:

Well, logically, it could mean

2

either.

I sort of think it doesn't say what it means.

3

It's a state post-trial or other collateral review.

4

collateral review could be read to mean of the state, or

5

it could be read to mean any of them.

anywhere with the language?

other arguments, it's just that the language itself seems

8

totally ambiguous as to which it means.

Well, I think if you look -- in a

10

statute such as AEDPA and the habeas realm in particular,

11

if you're talking -- Congress was so concerned about

12

delineating specifically the roles of the state and

13

Federal courts.

14

that Congress would have specified state only.

15

under the Respondent's reading, or the Second Circuit's

16

reading, there's no reason whatsoever for state to even be

mentioned.

6

they're viewed in 2263(b), for example, which is the

7

capital tolling provision, Congress specifically stated

8

there that state or post-conviction and other collateral

9

review with respect to state court proceedings.

10

QUESTION:

Why didn't it use the same language

11

here, because that made it clearer, don't you think, in

12

state opt-in provisions in capital cases?

13

MS. BANSAL:

Yes, the capital case language is

14

clearer, and it, from our perspective, it would have been

15

preferable if Congress had used the same language.

16

There's no doubt that that is clearer.

17

reading, and the more natural reading, of the language at

18

issue here especially in the context of the policies

19

underlying AEDPA, we believe is consistent with the manner

20

in which Congress wrote the tolling provision for capital

21

cases.

QUESTION:

All right.

That

1

is, he has to go exhaust, but it's not supposed to muck

2

around with the statute of limitations.

3

this case, there will be a certain number of cases in

4

which a person thinking -- you know, these people don't

5

know the law that well -- they file a petition in the

6

Federal court, it sits around there for several months,

then they discover an unexhausted claim.

go file it in the state court, and by the time they

it seems to me that that policy cuts against you quite --

to me fairly strongly -- and I want to hear what you have
to say about it.

14

MS. BANSAL:

I think generally Congress and this

15

Court enacts procedural rules with the understanding that

16

litigants will be able to conform their behavior to those

17

rules.

18

particular, for example, even in McClesky v. Zant where

19

the Court laid down certain rules in respect -- or certain

20

standards with respect to successive petitions.

21

no doubt that certain pro se habeas petitioners might,

22

after McClesky, have been denied a bite of the apple of

23

meritorious claims because they weren't included in their

24

first habeas petition.

25

habeas petitioners, after the Court announces a rule here,

1

will not be able to err on the side of exhaustion, which

2

is especially what Congress intended when it enacted

3

AEDPA.

4

In addition to enacting a statute of

5

limitations, Congress enacted a number of provisions

6

designed to enhance and strengthen the exhaustion

7

requirement.

9

QUESTION:

I was looking for -- you see, you

have explained to me perfectly well why the policy I

10

mentioned maybe isn't that important or too bad, or it's

11

not determinative.

12

language is totally open and ambiguous, and there is the

13

policy that I said, even if it's weak in your opinion,

14

let's say, what policy cuts the other way?

15

But my question to you was, if the

MS. BANSAL:

Well, the two policies that

16

underlie AEDPA and the statute of limitations in

17

particular are finality and comity.

18

Court has recognized, is especially an important policy

19

when you're talking about state court convictions.

Finality, as this

20

On the other hand, Congress was also concerned

21

about comity and ensuring proper respect for state court

22

proceedings and allowing state courts the first bite of

23

the apple of correcting constitutional errors.

24

for the pendency of a state post-conviction or collateral

25

proceeding makes eminent sense in context of the scheme,

(800) FOR DEPO

To toll

1

because it furthers the purpose of finality by limiting

2

the period during which they can file a Federal habeas

3

petition, but it also furthers the concern for comity by

4

encouraging litigants to go to the state court in the

5

first instance.

6

To toll for Federal petitions would undercut the

7

finality goal without concomitantly furthering the comity

8

goal, which was a --

9

QUESTION:

Ms. Bansal, there is though, one for

10

interest of the Federal courts which Congress took away

11

their priorities.

12

have got to hear this kind of case first, and put it at

13

the top of the list.

14

you are taking, we would be creating a priority because

15

the Federal court would say, oh, my goodness, we better

16

take care of this because if there's an unexhausted claim

17

in it, we've got to make sure that this pro se petitioner

18

gets back to the state court before the clock runs out.

19

So you are, in effect, creating a priority in

20

the Federal courts to put these prisoners' petitions at

21

the very top of the list of the business that they do.

22

There used to be Federal courts who

cases, to even instruct district court judges that that's

2

the way they should proceed.

3

QUESTION:

And that doesn't strike you as odd

4

when once we had a whole list of statutory priorities in

5

Federal courts, and then Congress decided it didn't want

6

to do that?

7

Federal courts?

8
9

It didn't want to set the agenda for the

MS. BANSAL:
all.

To me, that's not inconsistent at

In fact, it's consistent because part of what

10

Congress was -- part of what -- habeas jurisprudence in

11

general has been the interaction and the intersection

12

between Congressional enactment and judicially crafted

13

rule.

14

judiciary to implement and apply the statute of

15

limitations in individual cases, we believe that that's

16

consistent.

And insofar as Congress has now left it open to the

17

QUESTION:

It would be appropriate, do you

18

agree, for the Federal courts -- say you prevail, to say,

19

well, now, we have to take these prisoners' petitions

first thing to make sure that if there is something to be

21

exhausted, they get back before the clock runs out.

22
23
24
25

MS. BANSAL:

But that would be appropriate in

our view.
QUESTION:

Ms. Bansal, may I ask you a question?

If I remember the situation correctly, there was sort of a
10

1

nonstatutory one-year period of limitations that courts of

2

appeals crafted for the one year after the enactment of

3

the statute that wasn't actually provided for by the

4

statute.

5

suggestion that even if your reading of this particular

6

provision is correct, would it be conceivable that the

7

Federal court, not relying on the statute but just general

8

equitable principles of tolling, might be able to address

9

the hypothetical that Justice Breyer is concerned about.

10

I'm just wondering if you'd comment on the

MS. BANSAL:

I think that is correct -- that

11

there are general equitable principles that a lower

12

Federal court could adopt, but I would add that the

13

circumstances under which that power might be exercised

14

are extremely circumscribed.

15

At least eight courts of appeals so far have

16

found an equitable tolling basis with respect to the

17

habeas statute of limitations -- the one-year statute of

18

limitations.

19

looked to is first the delay during which the habeas

20

petition was brought had to have been for circumstances

21

entirely outside of the petitioner's control.

22

And the types of conditions that they've

And secondly, the petitioner had to have acted

23

diligently without that period of delay.

24

-- one court, at least -- in addition has added a

25

potentially meritorious requirement to actually reaching
11

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

And some courts

1

out and addressing that.

2

I think that it's not enough -- or we would

3

contend that it would not simply be enough that a habeas

4

petition would have brought mixed petition in which there

5

were clearly unexhausted claims and had that sit on the

6

district court's docket for about thirteen months before

7

being dismissed.

8

to make it clearly outside of the petitioner's control,

9

that that delay occurred because if there was no serious

10

question as to the exhaustion status of the claims, then

11

that's something that the petitioner could have filed

12

properly after exhaustion.

13

That, in our view, would not be enough

QUESTION:

Well, then if you're right, then on

14

your reading of the statute, unless the prisoner is a

15

legal genius which you'd have to be in this area -- he's

16

had it, and he'll never get a Federal habeas filed.

17
18

MS. BANSAL:

With all respect, I believe that's

incorrect.

19

QUESTION:

20

MS. BANSAL:

Because?
The habeas petitioners will just be

21

informed that they must err on the side of going to state

22

court first.

23

this Court has said with regard to successive petitions.

24
25

I mean, it's not that different from what

petition and, lo and behold, it will be held by a Federal

5

judge after several months of looking at it, that it has

6

an unexhausted claim in it.

7

all represented all the time, and that could happen,

8

couldn't it?

9

Then they'll go into Federal

Then lo and behold, an idea will strike one of

MS. BANSAL:

I mean, these people are not

It could, but under Rose v. Lundy,

10

what could happen at that point is that after the district

11

court determines that it's a mixed petition, the habeas

12

petitioner would have the option of deleting the

13

unexhausted claim for purposes of getting the petition

14

heard.

15

So we contend that the difficult hypothetical

16

that your positing is really -- it's simply premature and

17

probably unlikely that it will come to fruition.

QUESTION:

I get a lot of claims they say, well,

I couldn't really make this before.

certain period.

certainly it's not new to you or to me that prisoners

allege something, and they say we couldn't have known it

24

before.

25

You see, I had a

Now, I'm exaggerating with that one, but

1

would allow for that.

2

exceptions that allow for the tolling, so to speak, of the

3

statute.

4

QUESTION:

2244(b)(1) has certain other

And even if not -- I take it the way

5

it works is that when it goes back to the state court,

6

then the tolling commences during the time it is in state

7

court.

8

MS. BANSAL:

That's correct.

9

I would just like to add that in -- it's often

10

common for this Court, both in the statute of limitations

11

context and the habeas context, to read the plain words

12

that Congress intended, or to fashion a rule that's clean.

13

The subsequent applications of that can be worked out as

14

time goes on, and as experience with the effects of the

15

rule become known.

16

In a statute of limitations context, just last

17

year in the context of the Clayton Act, the Rotella case.

18

And also three years ago in the RICO statute, the Claire

19

case, this Court held strictly what the statute of

20

limitations required, and it subsequently said that we

21

will work out the equitable -- you know, let the issues

22

percolate through the Federal courts and we will determine

23

what, if any, equitable discretion is retained by the

24

courts.

25

In the habeas context as well.

In Wainwright v.

1

Sykes, for example, when the Court announced the cause and

2

prejudice rule, the Court specifically said that we will

3

give content to those terms and as time evolves --

4

certainly with respect to habeas jurisprudence, we believe

5

that it's appropriate that this Court read the language of

6

the statute, as we believe the provision itself states

7

that it's consistent with a statute as a whole and

8

subsequently let the equitable applications of it, and if

9

there are concerns about the difficult hypothetical, to

work themselves out.

claims that he was claiming in the first petition.

2

QUESTION:

So your basic position is that we

3

could decide this case and leave open the possibility of

4

equitable tolling in more meritorious cases?

5

MS. BANSAL:

Yes, that's correct.

But we also

6

believe that consistent with the way the courts of appeals

7

have applied the equitable tolling doctrine, it should be

8

if there is one at all, and we think there is a

9

substantial argument that it may not be appropriate in the

10

statute, but if there is one, that it would be reserved

11

for the extremely rare and extraordinary cases.

12
13

QUESTION:

Would this judge have had the option

to give the prisoner leave to amend?

14

MS. BANSAL:

I believe -- well, he dismissed it

that other collateral review does take into account

has the power to impose upon litigants in this particular

to the state court swiftly, and then it will come back

here, and so the only time that will be lost is the

initial time that you took to get to any court.

any kind of frequency.

this Court back to the original language.

original language does support the Second Circuit's

reasoning and ruling that Federal habeas petitions are

other collateral review that would stop the clock for

Then why put in those -- the word

MS. LOEWENBERG:

You're right, Justice Ginsburg,

10

and I think Justice Souter called the statute in a world

11

of silk purses, this is a sow's ear.

12

it's not well-crafted in a lot of different instances.

And that would --

I'm not sure it's much worse than one is

MS. LOEWENBERG:

I think it would be, Your

17

Honor, much worse from Mr. Walker's perspective and from

18

other state petitioners who get caught up in the mire of

19

delay that they really have no control over at all.

Well, this defendant did have

something on the order of ten months to go do something,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PREETA D. BANSAL

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MS. BANSAL:

Just briefly, Your Honor.

13

Respondent in the court below would do violence to the

14

statute in order to achieve the policy result they seek.

15

They would basically, as this Court has suggested,

16

eliminate the word state which is a very big word to

17

eliminate from a statute.

18

policy concerns that they raised are entirely unfounded at

19

this point -- speculative and premature.

20

terms of the options the district courts already have, the

21

reasons this won't lead to a harsh result in the vast

22

majority of cases are as follows.

23

But furthermore, we believe the

First of all, in

Prisoners will be required to err first on the

24

side of exhaustion.

There is no reason to believe that

25

they can't do that in the vast majority of cases.

If

1

there are mixed petitions that ultimately go before the

2

district court, the prisoner at that point would have the

3

opportunity to delete the unexhausted claims in order to

4

have the exhausted claims continue to be heard.

5

the district courts can reach out and decide the merits of

6

unexhausted claims if it's for purposes of denying the

7

petition.

8

end up being unmeritorious, this actually provides the

9

mechanism for the prisoner to achieve substantive Federal

All right.

The policy anomaly, were

you to lose, would be what, precisely?

violence to the statute.

reason is as I said.

The policy concern that we have is

that it would be undermining the finality of state court

convictions.

I mean, it would be --

QUESTION:

9

MS. BANSAL:

Because?
The first canon of statutory

10

interpretation is that you give effect to the words of

11

Congress.

12

QUESTION:

13

undermines the state.

14

MS. BANSAL:

No, I'm -- the policy you say
I want to understand how.
Because the whole purpose of the

15

statute of limitations was to put a finite limit on the

16

time in which Federal petitions could be brought in the

17

state's interest in preserving the finality of its

18

convictions.

19

petitions, it undermines that purpose of finality without

20

serving any other purpose of the statute.

21

possible purpose that it could serve would be respect for

22

state court processes, which isn't implicated when you're

23

talking about tolling for Federal petitions.

24

reason you have that tolling provision is to allow

25

exhaustion, and to, you know, serve respect for state

If you allow tolling for pending Federal
