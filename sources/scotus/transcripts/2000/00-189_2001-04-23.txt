ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. STRACK:

Mr.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Four years ago in a decision that involved these

11

same parties, the court affirmed the principal that

12

submerged lands are an essential attribute of state

13

sovereignty.

14

whether this essential attribute of sovereignty was

15

defeated by the Act of March 2nd, 1889, an Act that

16

authorized negotiations for the purchase of timber and

17

mineral lands.

18

presumption against defeat of state title.

19

Today the court is asked to determine

Under law, the 1889 Act embodies a

QUESTION:

Would you mind if I just get a little

20

background that helps me understand better the practical

21

issues involved here.

22

one-third of the lake, the submerged lands and about

23

one-third of Lake Coeur d'Alene; is that right?

24
25

MR. STRACK:

We're talking about roughly

Actually the acreage would be more

like one-fourth of the lake.

This is the southern part of Lake

20 miles of the St. Joe River.

11

MR. STRACK:

Well, I think it makes a very large

12

difference from the state's viewpoint, Justice O'Connor,

isolated body of water.

15

QUESTION:

This is not just an

Well, just tell me what's involved.

16

Is it fishing rights or regulation of boating, what is it?

17

Why does the state care, what is involved as a practical

18

matter.

19

MR. STRACK:

We care because the majority of the

20

users on the Lake are not Indians and because of that we

21

have a significant interest in protecting their safety,

22

for example, citing people who are boarding in an unsafe

23

manner or if citing someone who doesn't have the requisite

24

amount of life vests on board for small children.

It's

QUESTION:

I'll pursue Justice O'Connor's

2

question, why can't the State, why can't the tribe have

3

the patrol boat just like a tribe has a patrol car on the

4

road?

5

MR. STRACK:

Because this is a public highway

6

and the court has been very clear that on a public highway

7

tribes usually do not have general sovereign authority

8

over non-Indians.

9

power to exclude generally and that's the basis of tribal

10
11
12
13

That's because they don't have the

authority over non-Indians, in most instances.
QUESTION:

Well, then, why can't the state's

boat go into the southern part of the lake?
MR. STRACK:

Because the tribe has basically

14

precluded us from that and I believe the Court's decree

15

precludes us from doing that also.

16

QUESTION:

You can't work -- all this is about

17

is whether or not the State wants to have a policeman in a

18

boat cite somebody for not wearing a life vest and the

19

tribe just won't agree to figuring out some method so that

20

MR. STRACK:

It sounds like is that all that's at

lot more at stake than simply that.

may be right, but sometimes -- what is the practical

application, anything else?

5

MR. STRACK:

I think there's many practical

6

applications, Justice Breyer, as we spoke about in our

7

brief.

QUESTION:
one.

I

Well, name one.

Could you just name

So far I have the fact that you told Justice

10

O'Connor that it's not been possible for you to work out

11

with the tribe whether a policeman could cite somebody in

12

a boat for not wearing a life jacket.

13

one?

14

MR. STRACK:

Now what's the next

Oh, for example, we have an

15

in-stream flow, a statutory in-stream flow that protects

16

the lake level and that's certainly broadened the question

17

by this concept of tribal ownership of at least a portion

18

of the lake.

the podium a bit because I'm having difficulty hearing.

You're lowering.

There.

MR. STRACK:

Other way.

Another practical aspect would be,

for example, our statute that prevents dredging on this

portion of the river.

That would no longer have any

it becomes managed not for public uses necessary but for

The State protects public access and

its capacity as a trustee, if you will, have any role in

how the lake is managed or used if it belongs to the

QUESTION:

They have simply stepped back
I haven't seen any evidence

Let me ask you another question.

19

After Idaho became a state, I think there were at least

20

two conveyances by the United States to people of land in

21

that area, one to Frederick Post and the other to someone

22

named Harrison; is that right?

23

MR. STRACK:

Justice O'Connor, actually the

24

Harrison session was not a conveyance of land, they simply

25

bought land from the tribe.

QUESTION:

Ceded.

MR. STRACK:

Got a cession of land from the

3

tribe but they never exercised any ownership right over

4

that little corner of the lake.

5

Harrison cession.

6
7

They never conveyed it to anybody.

QUESTION:

And how about Post the Frederick Post

property.

8
9

That was part of that

MR. STRACK:

The Post cession occurred in the

1880 -- 1891 Act.

10

QUESTION:

So is it your position that both of

11

those are void, that there was no authority because Idaho

12

had already become a state.

13

MR. STRACK:

First of all, on the Harrison

14

cession, I don't think that would be void because they

15

were simply changing the boundary across a navigable

16

waterway.

17

we would have no problem with that if they wanted to take

18

a portion of the lake out of reservation.

19

problem if they attempted to convey it to somebody, but

20

they didn't do that in --

21

They could do that today if they wanted to and

QUESTION:

We would have a

But if the tribe doesn't own it, I

22

don't see how you could take the position that the

23

conveyance by them would be valid.

24
25

MR. STRACK:

I don't understand.

It's a simple cession. I think the

tribe could agree that we're going to cede this portion of

the lake out of the reservation.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. STRACK:

Something they don't own.
Yes.

I think it's a jurisdictional

4

boundary, not just a property boundary so they can

5

certainly say yes, we'll agree to moving this

6

jurisdictional boundary over to this part of the lake, and

7

I don't think that would have any violation of the state's

8

rights under the equal footing doctrine.

9

QUESTION:

You're making a distinction between

10

property and regulation and I gather from your answers so

11

far what you're saying is property rights are not at

12

stake, only sovereign rights to police, is that accurate?

13

MR. STRACK:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, the way I

14

view submerged lands is that they're a blend of sovereign

15

rights and property rights, and so -- but there is

16

examples where if there is a conveyance of property and a

17

conveyance of sovereignty, the submerged lands go with the

18

sovereignty because they're an attribute of sovereignty.

19

It's a very loose situation.

20

referring to before was the fact that reservation

21

boundaries are not just property boundaries, they're also

22

jurisdictional boundaries, especially nowadays where we

23

have allotted reservations such as this one, and so they

24

can move the reservation boundary without necessarily

25

applying anything as to property rights on either side of

But what I was talk --

that --

2

QUESTION:

What about as to sovereignty rights?

3

When you say jurisdictional boundary, I assume you mean a

4

boundary of sovereignty.

5
6

MR. STRACK:

You don't mean that?

Justice Scalia, yes, I do mean a

boundary of sovereignty.

7

QUESTION:

You do mean that.

Well, then, that

8

brings back the question of how the tribe could cede

9

jurisdictional rights without ceding sovereign rights.

10

MR. STRACK:

I think in the case of the Harrison

11

cession, Justice Scalia, again there was no exercise of

12

property rights once that cession occurred but --

13

QUESTION:

rights.

15

But we're not talking about property

We're talking about sovereignty rights, aren't

16

MR. STRACK:

17

QUESTION:

That's correct.
And you acknowledge that the

18

consequence of the cession was an alteration of

19

jurisdiction, which I assume is the same as an alteration

20

of sovereignty.

21

MR. STRACK:

Justice Scalia, I think I see the

22

source of your confusion and perhaps I could clear that up

23

a bit.

I hope so.

1

Indian reservation there is a shared sovereignty. State

2

sovereignty extends over jurisdictions, but so does

3

federal sovereignty, and so a jurisdictional line as I'm

4

speaking of it here would be a line wherein in this would

5

define Indian country in which the Federal Government

6

would have perhaps special preemptive powers over State

7

sovereignty.

8

where you either have State sovereignty or you have

9

Federal sovereignty.

We don't view this as an either/or situation

There's always going to be shared

10

sovereignty within Indian country, and as a matter of fact

11

here, there's numerous examples of this kind of shared

12

sovereignty or special beneficial rights that tribes own

13

in sovereign lands without defeating State title.

14

I think a wonderful example is the usual and

15

accustomed fishing right that many tribes have in the

16

Northwest and there they have the right to fish at these

17

places, occupy these places, it's a special right in

18

submerged lands but it does not defeat State sovereignty

19

over those lands.

20

examples where we have this beneficial interest in a tribe

21

that does not necessarily imply anything as far as a

22

State's sovereign right to regulate itself.

QUESTION:

And so certainly there's a number of

when there are just the fishing rights involved, correct?

3

MR. STRACK:

I think that would be correct,

Justice Scalia.

4

QUESTION:

You get to the 1899 Act, as I

5

understand it the premise of the 1899 Act was that the

6

United States would not take any portion of the

7

reservation except by agreement; is that correct.

8
9

MR. STRACK:

They would not take the portion

that they were authorized to purchase except by agreement

10

and that would have been the timber and mineral lands,

11

yes.

12

QUESTION:

Well, and are you saying that the --

13

that the Act had no significance for any other portion of

14

the reservation?

15

MR. STRACK:

In terms of submerged lands, I

16

think, Justice Souter, that is what we are submitting,

17

that this was an act that sought diminishment of the

18

reservation and Congress knew that it would be focused on

19

the northern part of the reservation and they knew that

20

the northern part of the reservation contained submerged

21

lands.

of law, I mean couldn't submerged lands also have mineral

2

deposits or have been thought to have mineral deposits and

3

therefore be subject to the purchase power under the

4

statute?

5

MR. STRACK:

There's no evidence at all in the

6

record, Justice Souter, that Congress believed these

7

submerged lands to have any mineral value whatsoever.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, let's assume then that the --

that the Act referred only to lands that were not

10

submerged lands.

Wouldn't it have been very -- a very

11

strange construction on the intentions and the acts of the

12

United States to assume on the one hand that with respect

13

to specified kinds of lands, timber and minerals, it

14

wouldn't touch the reservation except by agreement, and at

15

the same time assume that without any agreement and in

16

fact without any express reference, it was divesting the

17

tribe of the submerged lands which were also part of the

18

reservation.

19

anyone looking at the Act say gee, if they're not going to

20

take timber and minerals except by agreement they're not

21

going to take anything else either.

22

thing they intend to take, if they can get an agreement,

is timber and minerals.

QUESTION:

MR. STRACK:

Justice Souter, I think we would

disagree for the fact that I -- in fact, it would be

6

strange if we believed that the tribe had owned these

lands prior to the 1889 Act.

8

QUESTION:

Well, I thought it was -- I thought

it was conceded in this case that the reservation included

order included submerged lands.

12

MR. STRACK:

We conceded the fact, Justice

13

Souter, that the President intended to reserve those

14

submerged lands but we made that concession in light of

15

the trial court's finding that the President was not

16

authorized to permanently reserve those lands.

17

QUESTION:

Well, but he wasn't authorized

18

permanently to reserve anything, I presume, was he? The

submerged lands are in the same position as any other

portion of the reservation, isn't that so?

3

QUESTION:

I don't see then why you made the

concession.
MR. STRACK:

We made the concession that he

6

intended to reserve the submerged lands because that was

7

basically a factual finding and we did not view it

8

significant in light of the fact that you would have to

9

have the subsequent congressional ratification and we

wanted to focus the Court of Appeals on this second

element of the Alaska test which is the need for

ratification.

second element I just want to get clear on the terms that

are being used.

17

it you don't dispute the fact that the commissioner had by

this time filed a -- a report saying that submerged lands

19

were included in the reservation.

20

to assume that when Congress was talking about the

21

reservation in the 1889 Act, that it was talking about the

recognize that Congress was looking at the reservation

2

boundaries as established and working on the basis of the

3

information that was provided in the 1888 report.

4

would agree with that, but we would question whether or

5

not Congress actually approved that inclusion because of

this omission of submerged lands.

7

QUESTION:

But we

Well, I'm just asking right now what

8

Congress meant when it was talking about the reservation

in the 1889 Act, and isn't it reasonable to suppose that

10

it meant by reservation the reservation as intended, the

11

reservation as described by the commissioner, i.e., the

12

reservation that included submerged lands.

13

probably what it meant by the word?

14

MR. STRACK:

Isn't that

Looking at the 1889 Act as a whole,

15

Justice Souter, I don't think I would agree that statement

16

because of this omission of the submerged lands to my mind

raises a question as to whether Congress recognized that

but that Congress knew that that reservation was not

2

legally effective to create it because it needed

3

ratification which had not occurred.

4

But nevertheless Congress, out of an abundance

5

of goodwill to the Indians, was not willing to go back on

6

the 1873 executive order without the express consent of

7

the Indians, but that still doesn't amount to any

8

effective action by Congress creating the reservation.

MR. STRACK:

Your Honor, I would agree with that

we're not taking into account is the fact that executive

after you would concede that the tribe, United States in

3

whole thing turns on, that it was nine months after rather

5

MR. STRACK:

Justice Ginsburg, I don't think we

6

would agree with that because if the 1891 Act had in fact

7

been enacted before statehood, then we would have to look

8

at this under the conveyance rules of Holt State Bank and

9

Montana, and there the court said that where a tribe is

10

simply granted a continuing right of aboriginal occupation

11

that that right usually would not carry with it title to

12

submerged lands.

13

lands, but not sufficient to defeat State title.

14

It may have an interest in submerged

And here, all of the rights vested in the tribe

15

came as a result of the 1887 agreement which provided that

16

these lands would be held as Indian land which is simply a

17

restatement of this principle of aboriginal occupation.

18

There was no additional rights vested in the tribe as the

19

result of the 1889 agreement.

20

QUESTION:

I'm getting confused.

You said a

are there two agreements, one 1887 and one 1889?

difference is.
MR. STRACK:

In 1887, the tribe and the United

3

States negotiated an agreement that would cede all lands

4

outside the 1873 boundaries and as part of that agreement

5

they agreed that the tribe would continue to hold the land

6

within the reservation as Indian land.

7

Then in 1889 we have the second agreement which

8

was only a cession agreement specifically limited to

9

purchase of lands by the 1889 Act and in the agreement

10

there was no additional rights of conveyance.

There's no

11

language of conveyance in the 1889 agreement itself.

12

simply a quit claim to the northern portion of the

13

reservation.

It's

14

So whatever rights the tribe holds in the

15

southern third of the lake and the remainder of the

16

reservation are necessarily going to be founded in the

17

language of the 1887 Act which defines the tribe's rights.

18

And under Montana, where we simply have a continued right

19

of aboriginal occupation, that type of conveyance to a

20

tribe would not normally carry with it an interest in a

21

lake bed that would be sufficient to defeat State title.

22

QUESTION:

If it says in this kind of grant,

23

suppose it said specifically we're going to give to the

24

Indian tribe and not to Idaho the right to use navigable

But I think the point I want to make is that

10

because of this presumption against defeat of State title

11

that we should always assume that Congress would try to

12

accommodate tribal rights and State interest in public

13

ownership of these lands to the extent possible.

14

where all we have is a simple right of use, that would

15

probably not be sufficient.

16

pointing out that in neither of these agreements is there

a fishing right provided to the tribe expressly, which is

very unusual for a northwestern tribe.

Again, I think it's worth

in the legislative history leading up to the 1889 Act and

determine what it is in the State's view that would have

MR. STRACK:

Justice Ginsburg, I think it would

take something akin to section 6 C which was reviewed in

5

the Alaska case which would be reratified as reservation

6

and prevent any passage of lands to the future State of

7

Idaho.

8
9
10

QUESTION:

So ratifying the 1873 reservation

executive order, that would not have been sufficient
either?

11

MR. STRACK:

I don't believe it would be a

12

ratification just by itself because the courts always look

13

for that additional affirmative language somehow, like in

14

the Choctaw case where you have fee title but it was

15

suggested that even that fee title might not be sufficient

16

because the court then relied on that passage which said

17

no part of this reservation shall ever be part of any

18

future State. And again, we see that in the Alaska case,

19

none of these lands will ever be passed to the future

20

State.

21

QUESTION:

And that position explains why you

22

were willing to leave uncontested any of the fact findings

MR. STRACK:

QUESTION:

Your Honor, that's correct.
In terms of what Congress set to do,

3

should it make a difference whether we're talking about a

4

reservation which on the one hand has simply been set

5

aside by executive or Congressional action to which

Indians were moved as in the Cherokees and so on or

whether we're talking about a reservation which in fact

8

covers land to which the Indians have an aboriginal title

or an aboriginal claim which I take it is the case here.

10

MR. STRACK:

Justice Souter, I believe the

11

distinction the court has made in the past is between an

12

affirmative grant of rights and a continuing aboriginal

13

occupation of rights.

14

difference if the tribe had not aboriginally occupied the

territory or not. Certainly what it looks for is that

affirmative grant in that language which says that no

QUESTION:

MR. GIVENS:

It was only of the Senate, it was

MR. GIVENS:

In spending ten years with these

occupation rights or whether it means the extraordinary

thing that when we create a new State, the land under

10

you get that out of simply the description of the

MR. GIVENS:

You get to that through the next

Well, now, I don't see that it shows

that at all because as I understand it, that map was there

8

at the time of the negotiations between General Simpson

9

and a tribal chief whose name I forget and General Simpson

10

started out with the proposition in those negotiations

11

that in fact both the Indians and the whites would have

12

the use of the lake and that led to an immediate

13

disagreement.

14

The one thing it does seem to show is that

General Simpson did not understand that a line across the

lake necessarily conveyed either an exclusive right to

navigate, let alone land underneath the water.

equivocal.

MR. GIVENS:

And at statehood what, which is the

had been the ownership interest that Congress knew of that

had been established by the '73, initially by the 73

MR. GIVENS:

Well, one reason to make that

assumption, Your Honor, is the 1887 agreement had a very

unusual clause in it, the reports from the negotiators

explained it was so unusual that the tribe insisted that

tribal ownership of the southern third of Lake Coeur

d'Alene implicates such issues as the extent to which the

3

tribe can have a role in anti-pollution measures for the

4

lake, what consequences would flow from pollution of

5

tribally owned lands, as well as to the extent to which

6

the tribe could regulate non-Indian uses on the southern

7

third of the lake.

9

QUESTION:

Could the tribe engage in dredging

activities that would affect either the water quality or

10

the level of the portion of the lake that is not within

11

the tribe's jurisdiction even under your theory?

12

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, it would have to work with

13

the Corps of Engineers which would have paramount

14

authority under various laws, but yes, that would be one

15

of the questions.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Why does the United States have

paramount authority under various laws?
MR. FREDERICK:

Well under the Rivers and

Harbors Act the Corps of Engineers has control over

20

navigable waterways.

21

QUESTION:

Whether the State or the tribe?

22

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct.

That's correct.

23

But from the United States' point of view one of the

24

reasons why this case is so important is because it

25

involves the good faith of the United States.

In 1891

1

when Congress ratified this statute it ratified

2

understandings that had been reached between United States

3

negotiators and it is unthinkable that Congress under the

4

equal footing doctrine would have conveyed the submerged

5

lands to all of the lake while simultaneously negotiating

6

to ratify an agreement that would convey the southern

7

third to the tribe.

8

QUESTION:

9

You know, there's certainly something

to what your say, but that just totally disparages the

10

equal footing doctrine as if it's of no consequence and it

11

seems to me it's equally possible that Congress may have

12

been at varying states of mind in varying years.

13
14

MR. FREDERICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, here the

negotiating history makes quite clear on page 183.

15

QUESTION:

Yeah, but the idea that every member

of Congress knew that negotiating history when they voted

17

to admit Idaho as a state doesn't make any sense at all.

QUESTION:

MR. FREDERICK:

9
10

It was well-known, Mr. Chief

Well known to whom?
To everyone who was involved in

the negotiations and the dealings between the United
States and the tribe.

11

QUESTION:

Well, but that doesn't mean that

12

every member of Congress, and that's the question here,

13

what did Congress mean when it admitted Idaho to the

14

union?

15

MR. FREDERICK:

In 1889, Mr. Chief Justice,

16

Congress passed a law that authorized negotiations for

17

cessions of the Coeur d'Alene reservation by the tribe as

such tribe shall consent to sell.

It was ratified six months after

the Statehood Act.

Yes, but that's too late under the

equal footing doctrine.
MR. FREDERICK:

The question is whether Congress

had manifested its intent to defeat State title and under

1

Alaska, the test is whether Congress intended to retain

2

the executive reservation and knew that reservation

3

contained submerged lands.

4

QUESTION:

How do you manifest your consent

5

when, by a subsequent act, you're relying on the

6

negotiations and the negotiations are not a manifestation

7

of consent?

8

that shows the consent of Congress.

9

You need something before the Statehood Act

MR. FREDERICK:

The '89 Act does that by showing

10

that Congress recognized the present reservation which was

11

the reservation embraced within the 1873 executive order

12

and the '86 Act which authorized the negotiations for the

13

lands outside the present reservation.

14

QUESTION:

They don't necessarily show that they

15

recognize the kind of title that could not be defeated by

16

a subsequent creation of a state. They just show that the

17

Indians had this as their reservation.

18

MR. FREDERICK:

As the executive had defined it,

19

Justice Scalia, and that's the key point here.

20

has conceded that the executive order reservation is what

21

it is and those boundaries that were defined in the

22

geological survey had angles drawn in the lake itself,

23

it's simply not tenable to suggest that when the lines are

24

bent and a point is drawn in the lake and that the line

25

crosses the lake that the lands underneath those navigable

The State

1

waters are not also included.

2

QUESTION:

Well, hy is that so when we have said

3

expressly in Montana and in Utah that the fact that a lake

4

is included within the boundaries of the reservation does

5

not itself mean that the submerged lands are also within

6

the reservation? We've been very clear on that in Alaska

7

and Alaska repeated that.

8
9

MR. FREDERICK:

In Alaska, however, and the

reason why this is closer to Alaska than it is to Utah and

10

to Montana is that the line actually was drawn on the

11

submerged lands as it was in Alaska where the line was

12

drawn out in the coastal waterway area.

13

reservation simply crossed a river, lines crossed the

14

river and there was no survey in Montana that this Court

15

discusses that would show acreage as being included.

16

In Montana the

In fact, Montana is distinguishable there

17

because the rights that were given by the treaty of 1868

only were residential rights.

Yes, but that's -- I just looked at

that because it was decided and I can't find a word there,

6

of course they get the navigable waters.

are given navigable waters means that they can go and fish

on the lake, it doesn't mean they have a right to the

that, therefore that to me is an important question to me

that I'm asking.

13

if they gave them 42 documents, a hundred documents, a

14

million documents, say you have navigable waters, what

15

reason is there for thinking that that includes submerged

16

lands?

17

Now,

What reason is there for thinking that

MR. FREDERICK:

Two reasons, first the executive

18

enforced anti-liquor prohibitions on Indian country and as

19

this court decided in Bates versus Clark in 1877, Indian

20

country for purposes of that law was defined until tribal

21

ownership was extinguished.

country prohibitions on liquor.

2

MR. FREDERICK:

No, it does get you under the

3

water because the enforcement was not occurring on that

4

sliver of the lake that was not within the reservation.

5

Moreover, the Senate said there are problems with trespass

6

on the lake by whites not authorized to be within the

7

reservation and the concept of trespass is traditionally

8

thought of as ownership of the property.

9

QUESTION:

Well, was the -- were they snorkeling

on the submerged lands?

11

about trespass on the water of the lake.

12

MR. FREDERICK:

I mean surely they were talking

Yes, and the question, Mr. Chief

13

Justice, is who owns the lake and in 1889 when General

14

Simpson negotiated with the tribe they drew the line from

15

one part directly across the lake to a different part

16

directly across the lake.

QUESTION:

That map which is set out at

Let me try it once more because I was

thinking my answer when I asked it would be nobody has

20

ever doubted that if you give navigable lands to the

21

Indian tribe you're giving them the submerged land, I mean

22

nobody has ever tried to drive a wedge between navigable

23

waters and submerged land, but that wasn't the answer I

got.

25

this case has been around for some time and I guess by now

I got the answer yes, they're totally different.

So

1

you've thought of what's the response to that and that's

2

what I'm trying to get.

3

MR. FREDERICK:

The submerged lands were

4

important to the tribe for a number of different reasons.

5

Unlike the Crow tribe in Montana, this tribe depended on

6

water resources and they recognized the value of submerged

7

lands even before the 1873 executive order when they made

8

an agreement with a man named Post to convey the river

9

channels which can be nothing but submerged lands for the

10

purpose of Post building a mill on that site.

11

harvested water potatoes, it built fishing weirs that were

12

affixed to the submerged lands of the lake and the

13

associated waterways and the executive knew that.

14

This tribe

When they negotiated for the land, Chief Seltice

15

insisted that the line be drawn in such a way that the

16

tribe would understand what was theirs.

17

Simpson in his response on page 183 of the joint appendix

18

says quite clearly after this agreement when the line is

19

redrawn you shall have the lower part of the lake.

20

could not be clearer that the executive understood that

21

the submerged lands south of where the line was to be

22

drawn were to be owned by the tribe.

23

And General

So the question then becomes this is in a sense

On page 93 the

language here is quite clear.

15

QUESTION:

The executive

What do you make the argument that

16

the reference to title doesn't cover this because

submerged lands really is an incident of sovereignty, it

is jurisdictional rather than proprietary.

19

MR. FREDERICK:

It is proprietary in the sense

20

of ownership, Justice Souter.

The fact that the State may

21

have some regulatory interest even over the southern third

22

of the lake under even our theory because under the

23

Mescalero Apache Indian case the State might still have a

regulatory role, given a range of factors that would be

But the important point is that we do know that

2

it included submerged lands because the Post, the

3

Frederick Post patent expressly included river channels

4

which is submerged lands when they drew the Harrison

5

cession in 1894.

6

to the coast but because the town of Harrison wanted to

7

build docks and wharfs, they redraw the line at a right

8

angle in the middle of the lake so that the town of

9

Harrison could build out that wharfage on to the submerged

At first they started it, it meandered

lands of the lake. So in this case the boundary lines are

quite clear that the parties understood submerged lands

were at issue and they drew the lines accordingly.

QUESTION:

The language in the Statehood Act

14

itself which through cross-reference to the understanding

15

would be taken to have reserved the submerged lands for

the Indian tribes.

MR. FREDERICK:

No, the language that is the

the court to that language which we have put in the joint

20

appendix, it's on page -- sorry, that language is on page

21

371 of the joint appendix and it provides as I have said,

22

but I would point out that at this time Idaho had a number

of Indian tribes that were resident there and so it would

the purpose of this disclaimer clause was to emphasize

2

that the State of Idaho would renounce and forever

3

disclaim all right and title to the unappropriated public

4

lands that were owned by the United States until such

5

title had been extinguished by the United States.

QUESTION:

May I just ask this question and be

7

sure I have your theory.

I don't see how an Idaho

disclaimer can be the ratification by Congress that is

necessary here.

So you're actually relying on the

10

Statehood Act itself as a congressional act that did the

job despite the fact the ninth circuit did not?

12

MR. FREDERICK:

The State -- no, two things,

Our theory depends upon the court

enough?

MR. FREDERICK:

That would have raised an Alaska

light of the executive having set forth the boundary.

1

MR. FREDERICK:

It's throughout the lake,

2

although the principal portion of the polluted part is on

3

the northern part of the lake.

4

I'm reliably informed, and this is matter that's outside

5

of the record, is not as polluted, although it is subject

6

to pollution problems and issues.

7

The southern part at least

I would like to just make a couple of points in

8

conclusion and that is the Idaho issue in terms of

9

submerged lands is also implicated by the 1888 railroad

10

statute which Congress passed and that passage which came

11

after the Senate resolution asking about the navigable

12

waters included a right of way that crossed across Lake

13

Coeur d'Alene to a point on the lake itself and requires

14

that the secretary provide compensation to the tribe for

15

that easement and it further provided that no rights for

16

the railroad shall accrue unless and until they obtained

17

the consent of the tribe.

18

So read together and this court's cases makes

19

very clear two overarching propositions, that these Indian

20

statutes should be read as a series and that doubts should

21

be construed in favor of the tribe suggest that Congress

22

did understand that the submerged lands were at stake,

23

that the tribe had control over those submerged lands and

24

that the United States would not take them without the

25

consent of the tribe.

If there are no further questions.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN W. STRACK, ESQ.

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. STRACK:

On this question of whether or not

6

there's a difference between beds and navigable waters, I

7

think the court has made that very clear in the Alaska

8

decision where the court looked to purposes that required

9

ownership of the beds themselves; for example, the need to

10

own the bed to preserve the oil deposits.

11

QUESTION:

We've just heard about wharfs, about

12

harvesting potatoes, about grants for the mill, does that

13

indicate the sort of purposes that we thought were

14

important in Alaska?

15

MR. STRACK:

Looking back at the 1889 Act I

16

don't think any of those purposes are evident on the face

17

of the 1889 Act.

18

purpose they have identified is fishing, and that itself

19

does not require ownership of the beds of the navigable

20

waters themselves unless they're fishing methods for some

21

reason required ownership of the bed like a fishing weir,

22

but we don't see any evidence that they were doing that in

23

1889.

24
25

If there was a purpose and the only

So again I think we need to look at the purposes
here and see whether or not those require ownership of

1

navigable waters, ownership of the beds of navigable

2

waters as opposed to the waters themselves.

3

I'd like to go back too to the question

4

practical effect because I think it obviously is a concern

5

here.

6

lands along the shore of the lake are owned by non-Indians

7

and that's been true since 1910 when the reservation was

8

allotted.

9

And I think it's important to note that all of the

Those lands, those people have riparian rights

10

which they look to the State to protect and define.

Many

11

of those people have encroachments on the lake and that's

12

where our ownership of the beds comes into play because we

13

regulate those encroachments so that they do not go out

14

far enough to impair navigation and other uses of the

15

lake.

16

So all of these people along the lake, now their

17

riparian rights are called into question because the State

18

no longer owns the beds of the lake according to the

19

decree and so we don't know what the effect of that would

20

be.

21

On the issue of pollution it works both ways, so

22

the tribe has an interest in protecting the lake from

23

pollution and the State has an equal interest, if not more

24

so, because we own the remainder of the lake, and when you

25

split a system like this in two it becomes very hard to

regulate that in a consistent manner.

QUESTION:

For example --

As far as encroachments on the lake,

3

doesn't the Corps of Engineers have authority no matter

4

whether the tribe owns the submerged lands or the State of

5

Idaho?

6

in the navigable water?

Doesn't the Corps get to say what can encroach out

7

MR. STRACK:

Justice O'Connor, for the most part

8

the Corps is not involved in these kinds of encroachments

9

unless there's dredging and filling.

10

QUESTION:

Do you dispute the fact that the

11

Corps does have jurisdiction to determine what

12

encroachments are authorized in navigable water?

13

MR. STRACK:

Where there's a fail interest

14

involved, Justice O'Connor they certainly could come in

15

and preempt, but it's my experience that we regulate all

16

those encroachments and I'm not aware of the Corps ever

17

being involved in those kinds of decisions.

18

QUESTION:

If the State perhaps regulates more

19

stringently then the Corps would care to, that's quite

20

possible.

21

MR. STRACK:

That is quite possible because of

22

the statute that we have in place protecting the lake as a

23

public resource for recreation and other public uses.

especially on issues such as fisheries, if the tribe was

to introduce new species of fish that was not genetically

compatible with the fisheries that we have in the

3

remainder of the lake, we could have some real problems

there.

result not only from tribal ownership but tribal ownership

of a small portion of the greater lake.

So there's tremendous practical effects that

7

On the issue of -- Mr. Givens mentioned the

8

acreage that included in the report, the acreage that

9

included navigable waters but it's also important to look

10

at the acreage of the cession that was reported. According

11

to the United States' exit report at page 237 the acreage

12

that was ceded in 1889 was 243,000 acres and that included

13

37,000 acres of the lake.

14

reported that acreage as 185,000 acres.

not view this cession as including the lake bed itself.

17

They did not view themselves as having purchased that from

the lake.

But the House report 1109
