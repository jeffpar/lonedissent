CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument on

Number 00-24, PGA Tour, Inc. vs. Casey Martin.

5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR, III

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. FARR:

Mr. Farr?

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

8

the Court:

The Ninth Circuit in our view made two

9

critical mistakes in applying the Disabilities Act to this

10

type of claim by a professional athlete. First it failed

11

to recognize that Title 3 of the act, the public

12

accommodations provision, apply only to claims by persons

13

seeking to obtain inputs of a place of public

14

accommodation, that is seeking to enjoy its goods or

15

services, not to claims by persons seeking to supply

16

inputs as employees or independent contractors.

17

Second, the Ninth Circuit never took account of

18

just what a top-level professional sport really is,

19

nothing more or less than a competition that tests

20

excellence in performing what its rules require.

21

attempt to adjust the rules to compensate for an

22

individual player's physical condition fundamentally

23

alters the nature of that competition.

24
25

Any

Now in turning to the first issue, our position
is simply this.

That Title 3 of the act would not apply
3

1

if Respondent were playing in tour events as an employee

2

of the Tour, and the results should be no different just

3

because he is playing in the events --

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, the language of Part 3 of

5

the act literally could cover the player.

6

refers to any individual, and it refers to any kind of

7

advantage or privilege on a golf course. So you have to

8

construe it some way, it seems to me, to avoid that

9

language.

10
11

MR. FARR:

It says, it

That's correct, Justice O'Connor.

I

mean, the argument --

12

QUESTION:

To reach your conclusion.

13

MR. FARR:

That's correct.

The argument made by

14

Respondent is essentially that Title 3 covers any person

15

who is present at a place of public accommodation,

16

whatever he or she is doing there, whether they are a

17

customer, an employee or an independent contractor.

18

think that's wrong for several reasons.

19

I

First of all, just looking at the specific

20

language that you point to, the notion of full and equal

21

enjoyment of goods and services, it seems to me, is quite

22

different from the notion of being allowed to provide the

23

goods and services.

24

QUESTION:

25

Well, Mr. Farr, you keep talking

about goods and services, but the statute is not limited
4

1

to goods and services, as Justice O'Connor's question

2

indicated.

3

things, privileges, and I, it seems to me the

4

straightforward argument is that the person who is making

5

a claim here is somebody who says, like any other member

6

of the public, I paid my $3,000 and I got my two

7

references and I want to enjoy the privilege of competing

8

at this, at this place of public accommodation.

9

doesn't it literally fall within that quite easily?

10

It covers the enjoyment of, among other

MR. FARR:

Why

Well, if I may separate this into two

11

things, because the $3,000 applies only to a very small

12

piece, which is the qualifying tournament. There is no

13

requirement playing on the Tour itself or on the Nike

14

Tour.

15
16
17

QUESTION:
start.

Right.

But that's, that's where you

That's where you start.
MR. FARR:

But that's where one starts. But in

18

terms of privilege, I'm using the term goods and services

19

not to skip over the others, but simply as a shorthand

20

reference to all of that.

21

QUESTION:

Well, except that it makes a

22

difference because I think in a common sense kind of way

23

we can say well, he is not getting any goods and services,

24

but he is trying to exercise a privilege of playing.

25

MR. FARR:

Well, except for, it seems to me that
5

1

in fact the word privilege, if it means the privilege to

2

work for a place of public accommodation, to provide the

3

input of labor to a place of public accommodation, then

4

naturally following that logic, Title 3 would apply to

5

anybody, an employee, an independent contractor or anyone.

6

QUESTION:

But once again, when you phrase it

7

the way you do, it makes it easier for your case. You say

8

a person supplying labor at a place of public

9

accommodation.

Another way of looking at it, and I

10

frankly would have thought in this circumstance an easier

11

way of looking at it would be not that he's supplying

12

labor, but that he wants to play a game and if he plays

13

the game well enough to win a prize. That's, that doesn't

14

fall within the sort of aura of employment that Title 1

15

covers.

16

MR. FARR:

Well, I think it does, to be honest

17

with you, Justice Souter.

18

a game of golf.

19

football, for example, professional football is a game

20

that is played by employees.

21

think, basically by the teams. They compete against each

22

other.

23

For example, this happens to be

But if one thinks of the game of

QUESTION:

Yeah.

They are, they are hired I

And they get -- and each one

24

of them gets paid by his employer win, lose or draw.

25

this case, maybe, maybe you'll have to help me out here.
6

In

1

I thought whether one got paid depended on whether one won

2

the prize.

3

MR. FARR:

Well, it depends on performance but

4

in a very specific sense of course, the performance by any

5

professional athlete determines ultimately what he or she

6

gets paid.

7

a place of public accommodation to be able to compete in a

8

professional sport, then it seems to me that would apply

9

to any professional sport.

10

So if in fact one can say it is a privilege of

QUESTION:

Well, except that the statement is

11

too broad.

The football industry, I suppose, does not say

12

we will give anybody who wants to come in and compete for

13

a place on our team a spot.

14

me to try out.

They are not going to invite

15

(Laughter).

16

But as I understand it, that, that is what is at

17

stake here.

18

level with his money and his references and keep on

19

playing well enough is in a position the way the PGA is

20

run to get to this top echelon of athletes and compete for

21

a prize.

22

Anybody who can start at the first qualifying

MR. FARR:

I'm not sure what difference that

23

makes, Justice Souter, because in a sense, anybody can

24

compete to play on a professional football team.

25

professional football teams are drawn from the public at
7

I mean,

1

large --

2

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Farr --

3

MR. FARR:

-- if they are good enough to

QUESTION:

We don't have to decide the football

4

qualify.

5
6

case here, but I'm wondering if you take too narrow a view

7

of what the PGA's business it is.

8

two dimensional, the PGA wants spectators, both public and

9

on the television, and that's the service involved.

You think of it as just

But

10

the other thing, as Justice Souter's privilege question

11

indicated, it also offers to a subset of the public, a

12

very talented subset from all over the world, the

13

opportunity to win a prize.

14

business.

15

And that's also part of its

It is offering an opportunity to win a prize.
MR. FARR:

Well, the -- the thing that I think

16

makes it more confusing, it seems, is that normally, our

17

position would be that the opportunity to earn something,

18

to start with, without using the words win a prize from

19

it, but the opportunity to earn something would not be the

20

kind of privilege or good or service that is being offered

21

by a place of public accommodation.

22

want to provide the inputs would be the kinds of people

23

who wanted to provide services and earn what they would

24

get in return.

25

different is because what Respondent in fact does for a

Indeed, people who

I think what makes this case seem

8

1

living is something that other people do for recreational

2

purposes or part of educational purposes.

3

But again, to take an example, if the Tour

4

constructed its operation just slightly differently,

5

instead of saying we will have everybody just compete for

6

the prizes as independent contractors, if they said what

7

we will do is we will hire a group of approximately 200

8

professional golfers, we'll make them employees, we'll pay

9

them a modest salary, just enough to kind of cover their

10

expenses as they play and then whatever they win over and

11

above that, that will be their earnings.

12

Now, our argument would be that in that

13

arrangement, the Tour would clearly not be subject to

14

suits by those golfers under Title 3.

15

QUESTION:

But they would be subject to suit --

16

MR. FARR:

They might be subject to suit --

17

QUESTION:

-- under Title 1.

18

MR. FARR:

Because Title 1 is the title of this

19

Act that deals with that kind of issue, the question of

20

relationships between people who are providing labor and

21

the people who are paying for it.

22

QUESTION:

Well all that -- I mean, this --

23

that's true, that's it's a very, it's an unusual situation

24

here, and we could go on forever about the pros and cons

25

and who they are really like.

But people go to race
9

1

courses for entertainment, but a few go to earn a living.

2

They're touts.

3

occasional person goes there to earn a living.

4

the purpose of the statute, and the language of the

5

statute, why does that make any difference?

Some people go to casinos for fun and an
So, given

6

MR. FARR:

I think it makes a --

7

QUESTION:

You're not going to say a person who

8

goes to a race course, happens to make a living out of it,

9

therefore, he couldn't sue if it's otherwise a public

10

accommodation, and I think you'd say the same about all

11

the unusual cases we can think of.

12

difference?

13

MR. FARR:

Why should this make a

I think the difference between the

14

examples you are using, Justice Breyer, and this example,

15

is those, the people who go to the race tracks, some of

16

whom may go to make a living, are essentially doing the

17

same thing, receiving the same outputs, if you will, from

18

the race track, as the people who are there simply for

19

recreational purposes.

20

QUESTION:

So are these people because after

21

all, the golf course is leased by the PGA to use to play

22

golf for that day.

23

MR. FARR:

But, but I think the difference,

24

Justice Breyer, is that at the time the tournament is

25

going on, in fact, there are no people there playing for
10

1

recreational purposes.

2

which is the time when the PGA is operating the place of

3

public accommodation, that's what's bringing the PGA

4

within Title 3 with respect to the spectators, for

5

example, is because it's operating a particular tournament

6

at a place of public accommodation.

7

QUESTION:

During the time of the tournament,

It seems to me --

Mr. Farr, I understand you are behind

8

the ropes, you say those are the spectators, it's a public

9

accommodation with respect to them.

10

MR. FARR:

That's correct.

11

QUESTION:

But I'm, I'm sure that you must have

12

an answer to, the public accommodations provision is not

13

new with the American disabilities. It comes up in the

14

Civil Rights Act of 1964 where the concern is race.

15

with respect to race, could the PGA say that we don't want

16

any African-Americans to play in our game?

17

MR. FARR:

Now,

Well, Title 2 does not apply, we

18

believe, in the same circumstances as we don't think Title

19

3 of the ADA applies, to situations in which somebody is

20

simply seeking to provide, seeking to obtain employment or

21

trying to obtain work as an independent contractor, so

22

Title 2 of the Civil Rights Act would not apply in that

23

case.

24
25

QUESTION:

So your answer is the same for both?

That neither public accommodation -11

1

MR. FARR:

For both those situations.

Now of

2

course, the -- the disabilities act itself and of course

3

the Civil Rights Acts that apply to race, and sex and age

4

have provisions that deal specifically with the question

5

of who is working at different places and claims about

6

discrimination, saying the terms and conditions that you

7

have set for a particular job are discriminating against

8

me.

9

QUESTION:

But you're saying they don't come

10

under the employment provisions because they're not

11

employees, not coming under the employment provisions,

12

they are not covered at all?

13

MR. FARR:

Under the disabilities act, and not

14

under Title 2.

15

Section 1981, for example, in the case of race, might

16

extend protection in that situation.

17
18
19

Whether there are other provisions like

QUESTION:

Yes.

But as far as the public

accommodation is concerned, you are being consistent.
MR. FARR:

The public accommodations provisions

20

in our view are intended again to deal with essentially

21

people who are consumers, clients and customers.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, can I just identify your

23

theory a little better?

Are you contending that when the

24

golf course is being used for a PGA tournament, it is not

25

a place of public accommodation because of the limited
12

1

number of people that can play on that day or are you

2

contending that even though it's a place of public

3

accommodation, the contestants are not individuals within

4

the meaning of the Act?

5

MR. FARR:

It is a modified version of the

6

second, Justice Stevens.

7

individuals seeking full and equal enjoyment of goods,

8

services, privilege and accommodations, as those terms are

9

properly interpreted.

10

QUESTION:

It is that they are not

But you are assuming that the golf

11

course, even though for a specific purpose, continues to

12

be a place of public accommodation?

13

MR. FARR:

That the area generally.

There is a

14

difficulty.

15

is every piece of the property a place of public

16

accommodation or is the -- are the ropes, for example,

17

dividing a place of public accommodation from a place that

18

isn't?

19

I mean, one of the questions that one has is,

That is one way to look at it.
In our view, the simpler way to look at it is

20

the second way that you have which is to say, you have to

21

be asking in this question, is the person an individual

22

receiving the kind of goods, services and privileges that

23

are covered?

24
25

QUESTION:

I see.

I think you conceivably could

have taken the position that when it's rented out for a
13

1

particular purpose it loses its character as a place of

2

public accommodation because only certain people can use

3

it.

4

still a place of public accommodation?

5

questioning that it is a place of public accommodation?

6

You rent a hotel, say, to have a wedding.

MR. FARR:

Is it then

But you are not

But that's because, that's because

7

they clearly are.

The Tour doesn't deny. It's putting on

8

an entertainment.

It is putting on an entertainment to

9

which spectators are allowed, so if one asks, is the golf

10

course at this moment a place of exercise or recreation,

11

as that's typically thought of under Title 3, our answer

12

would be, I think the better view is no.

13

Circuit actually interestingly didn't say that it was a

14

place of exercise or recreation and noted that we made the

15

argument it wasn't and basically said be that as it may,

16

it is a place of entertainment, and we -- and what we are

17

saying is yes, it is a place of entertainment and there

18

are people present at the tournaments who in fact are

19

enjoying goods and service and enjoying the entertainment

20

that we are providing.

And the Ninth

21

QUESTION:

But it seems to me --

22

MR. FARR:

But the golfers are part of the

23
24
25

entertainment.

Excuse me.

QUESTION: We are talking about not something
that's just a place, we are talking about the Tour, the
14

1

circuit, the season, whatever it's called.

2

wants to participate in.

That's what he

3

MR. FARR:

That's correct.

4

QUESTION:

And that it seems to me is a public

5

accommodation in that it's open to golfers from all over

6

the world.

7

MR. FARR:

Well, Justice Kennedy, I'm not sure I

8

agree with that.

I mean, if, if -- the thing that makes

9

the Tour have the obligations to the spectators is the

10

fact that they are operating a place of public

11

accommodation during the tournaments. You have to be

12

operating a place of public accommodation before you

13

become subject to Title 3.

14

QUESTION:

Well, I assume you could have a place

15

of public accommodation on a cybernet or something that

16

doesn't exist at any one place, and that's what, that's

17

what this other dimension of this case is.

18

offering to everyone the opportunity to compete in the

19

abstraction we call a tour, a circuit.

20

MR. FARR:

They are

But Justice Kennedy, the Tour isn't

21

an abstraction.

The Tour literally is, are a series of

22

events put on by a 501(c)(6) organization, a non-stock

23

membership organization, and they are put on for the

24

purposes of providing entertainment to the public.

25

entertainment, it seems to me, is a product that they
15

That

1

offer at a place of public accommodation.

2

QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, there is another important

3

question you haven't addressed.

4

of resolving this case that it is a place of public

5

accommodation, then there is a second question about what

6

kind of accommodation is required.

7

about that before your time is up?

8
9

MR. FARR:

If we assume for purposes

Are you going to talk

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

about that now, if I may.

Let me talk

The -- if one assumes for a

10

moment, and for example, the Seventh Circuit in the

11

Olinger case just assumed that Title 3 did apply to the

12

type of claim that the professional golfer there made.

13

one assumes that, then the question is whether the

14

modification that's requested here would fundamentally

15

alter the nature of Tour events, and I think that where

16

the Ninth Circuit went wrong on that particular question

17

is that it never really came to grips with what

18

professional athletics are.

19

If

The professional athletics are as I said in the

20

beginning, simply tests of excellence.

21

of who can perform the best a particular set of physical

22

tasks, and those tasks are defined by the rules of the

23

sport.

24
25

QUESTION:

They are questions

But, but the PGA has let down its

requirements in a couple of cases.
16

One golfer had been

1
2

injured and he was allowed to go in a cart, was he not?
MR. FARR:

Not -- never in a high-level Tour

3

event, Your Honor.

There has never been a situation in

4

the events we are talking about, which is the events on

5

the highest level PGA tours where they have allowed

6

different people --

7

QUESTION:

8

qualifying schools.

9

MR. FARR:

Oh, qualifying tours --

10

QUESTION:

And the thing that puzzles me is how

Mr. Farr, that's not true as to

11

it can be a fundamental rule that applies that does not

12

apply in the qualifying events.

13

MR. FARR:

Well, because the, the principal

14

events that they put on are, of course, the events of the

15

Tour themselves, the two highest level events.

16

involves simply questions of logistics to be honest.

17

There are, there are many more people who are playing.

18
19

QUESTION:

No.

Qualifying

If logistics are sufficient to

justify use of a cart, why isn't this handicap sufficient?

20

MR. FARR:

Well, first of all, let me make --

21

QUESTION:

Because they are both trying to

22

determine the quality of the golfer and it's not

23

fundamental in qualifying schools but it is fundamental in

24

the Tour event itself.

25

MR. FARR:

Well, let me make one point. That
17

1

when carts are allowed, they are allowed for all players,

2

and that is essentially because there are choices that the

3

Tour has to make at any particular time about whether or

4

not there are enough caddies available, whether there is

5

enough time on the golf course to get however many people

6

there are through the event in order to produce whatever

7

result they are looking for.

8
9

With respect to the events we are talking about,
the actual competitions on the PGA Tour, on the buy.com

10

Tour, which is the second level tour, the Tour has always

11

required that all competitors observe all the same rules,

12

including the walking rule. There have been no exceptions

13

to that whatsoever.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Farr --

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, is your position then,

16

clear position that there is no accommodation required in

17

a professional sport competition, that the rules are

18

whatever they are, and there is no requirement to adjust

19

to any disability?

20

MR. FARR:

I want to make clear two points.

21

First of all, that when I talk about rules, I am talking

22

about what we have called in the case substantive rules.

23

And that is rules that are intended to and do have the

24

potential to affect performance and the outcome of the

25

tournament.

So first of all, when I'm using the term
18

1

rules, I am.

2

Secondly, though, the question is if, if you are

3

saying do we mean that for any rule, or any accommodation,

4

I think the correct answer is yes, although one sort of

5

instinctively would think that there should be some

6

process by which people can separate the performance

7

affecting rules that really count from the performance

8

affecting rules that don't really count.

9

think there is such a process.

10

QUESTION:

I actually don't

Well, you're familiar with both the

11

law in the area and the game in your preparation for this,

12

for this argument, so you could not think of any concrete

13

example of where there would be any requirement to

14

accommodate to a disability, that the game is the game?

15

MR. FARR:

In a professional sport, I think

16

that's true, that the purpose of a professional sport is

17

one thing and one thing only.

18

the best at doing a certain set of defined tasks.

19

change what the tasks are, if you change the rules that

20

people have to comply with so that you have different

21

rules for different players, you are not going to get an

22

answer to the question of who is the best at that

23

particular thing.

It's to determine who is

Mr. Farr.

25

QUESTION:

Your argument is -19

If you

1

QUESTION:

Please, go ahead.

2

QUESTION:

Am I correct that, assuming we have

3

these two different grounds, if we go on your first

4

ground, and agree with you on that, namely, that this is

5

not an individual who is seeking to enjoy the place of

6

public accommodation, the PGA Tour would nonetheless, if

7

it wishes, be able to grant an exception in the future to

8

Casey Martin.

9

Title 3, but we are going to do it voluntarily.

10

It could say well, we don't have to under

Whereas, if we go on your second ground, mainly

11

that it is a fundamental part of a sport, the Tour

12

wouldn't be able to make such an exception, would it?

13

would in effect be admitting that it is not a fundamental

14

feature of the sport.

15

MR. FARR:

It

I think our second argument is

16

slightly different, Justice Scalia.

17

first part to start with.

18

would agree on the first issue that the Tour could, and I

19

think the Tour could under the second, simply by changing

20

what the rules of the sport are.

21

there is such a thing --

22
23

QUESTION:

Yes.

I agree with the

I think if the Court

Our position is not that

Well, no, make an exception just for

one, for one member.

24

MR. FARR:

But then you --

25

QUESTION:

Of course you could change it for
20

1

everybody.

2

you just say only Mr. Martin can ride? Could they do that

3

if we, if we, if the basis for their exemption is the fact

4

that walking is fundamental to the sport?

5

Anybody that wants to ride can ride. But could

MR. FARR:

I think it's -- again, our argument,

6

just to make sure I'm being clear, is not that we are

7

contesting, contending that there is a difference, that

8

there are fundamental rules and nonfundamental rules.

9

can tell which one is which, and walking is a fundamental

10

rule.

11

would be a fundamental rule.

12

that all the substantive rules are fundamental rules.

We

If there were such a way to tell, we think walking
But our position in fact is

13

QUESTION:

Rules are rules, and therefore --

14

MR. FARR:

Rules are rules.

15

QUESTION:

And therefore, you can't make an

16

exception for one individual.

17

MR. FARR:

You cannot because you absolutely --

18

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. FARR:

You have to have the uniformity in

19
20
21
22
23

Right?

And as soon as you do that,

then --

order to be able to measure what you do.
QUESTION:

You're only saying walking is

fundamental if there is a rule against riding?

24

MR. FARR:

I'm sorry, Justice Stevens?

25

QUESTION:

You're only saying walking is
21

1

fundamental if there is and always has been a rule against

2

riding in a cart.

3

MR. FARR:

That what is fundamental --

4

QUESTION:

Am I right about that?

5

MR. FARR:

I -- yes.

Except, again, I want, I

6

want to be clear that what in fact is fundamental to any

7

particular game is the rules of the sport.

8

defines what the sport is. Therefore, if there is not a

9

rule against it, by definition it's not something that

10

potentially affects the outcome of the sport as played

11

under its rules.

That is what

12

QUESTION:

This would be true of --

13

QUESTION:

Why would we say that --

14

MR. FARR:

Pardon me?

15

QUESTION:

This would be true of amateur sports,

16
17

as well as the -MR. FARR:

I think the difference in amateur

18

sports and the thing that makes, makes the, when you apply

19

the fundamental alteration language is that the

20

fundamental, when you talk about fundamentally altering

21

the nature of a particular good or service, that requires

22

looking at what the nature of the particular good or

23

service is.

24

different, I think, from the nature of most amateur

25

sports. Probably not all.

The nature of a professional sport is very

22

1
2

QUESTION:

Because it's trying to winnow the

wheat from the chaff in a way that amateur sports don't.

3

MR. FARR:

Not only that.

I mean, amateur

4

sports do that to some extent as well, but amateur sports

5

by definition, and particularly high school, college,

6

grade school sports, things like that, have as part of

7

their very nature, part of their very reason for being, an

8

educational or recreational side.

9

comes to apply any fundamentally altered language to the

10

nature of that, essentially amateur sports, most amateur

11

sports have a dual nature.

12

involves sort of sorting winners from losers, but they

13

also have a nature that says we are trying to get as many

14

kids in the high school or whatever to play.

15

sports are not --

16

QUESTION:

And therefore, when one

They have a nature that

Professional

Why couldn't we make that same

17

argument.

18

anyone who provides an important public service?

19

know, we have a bunch of rules, characteristics,

20

qualifications.

21

the importance of this good or service or privilege.

22

Therefore, if it affects the nature of the good, service

23

or privilege, it's fundamental, which is the argument you

24

are making.

25

Why couldn't that same argument be made by
You

We don't want courts in there weighing

MR. FARR:

Well, if it's actually changing what
23

1

the good or service is --

2

QUESTION:

They always do, to some tiny degree.

3

MR. FARR:

Well, if it changes the nature then

4

though, I think one therefore, one has to look at the

5

regulations for some guidance.

6

like to take just a minute before I reserve my time, if I

7

may, but the regulations are something that because the

8

United States hasn't cited them, I think maybe get lost a

9

little bit here.

And the regulations -- I'd

But under the regulations in Title 3,

10

there is a specific provision that says a public

11

accommodation does not have to change its inventory to

12

accommodate disabled people.

13

that in the preamble of the regulations is that Title 3

14

requirements are intended to assure access to the goods

15

and services being provided, not to alter the mix in

16

nature of the services typically provided.

17

And the reason given for

Now, typically provided in this context we would

18

say are the tournaments with uniform rules, including the

19

walking rule, at the very highest level.

20

has been typically provided.

21

That is one that

And the reason I think for that, and I think

22

this goes to your question, Justice Breyer, is that in a

23

sense, any store or commercial entity is just whatever its

24

goods are, a bookstore.

25

not have to stock braille, braille books.

An example is a bookstore does

24

And there isn't

1

an inquiry every time as to how much trouble it would be

2

to stock braille books, whether there's shelf space,

3

whether they could get them or not.

4

rule in the regulations that says that's not what we're

5

talking about, that would be a fundamental alteration, and

6

that's exactly the same point we are making here.

If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my
time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY L. REARDON

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

13

MR. REARDON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

14

please the Court:

15

beginning with Petitioner's second point, because I think

16

it's something we have recently heard discussed here, and

17

it's I think quite important.

18
19

I would like to take the liberty of

From 1965 until 1997, the PGA ran a Q School to
determine --

20

QUESTION:

A what school?

21

MR. REARDON:

It's a Q, they call it the Q

22

School.

It's a qualifying school, Your Honor.

23

purpose of that Q School is to determine, it's a test of

24

excellence, as Petitioner said, to determine who is the

25

best and who can go on the Tour the following year.
25

And the

It's

1

a very intense course.

There are 14 sessions, 252 holes

2

played on courses just like the PGA's regular courses that

3

they play their tournaments on.

4

described in the briefs as the rules which impact tennis

5

tournaments, golf tournaments under the PGA, the hard card

6

applies to those events, but the walking provision of the

7

hard card is eliminated for purposes of the Q School, and

8

what happens is there is a winnowing down process.

9

In 1997, when Casey tried out, there was

The hard card, which is

10

something like 1,200 people, golfers from the public, who

11

wanted to play on the PGA Tour.

12

their money, had their references, and started to play,

13

and they winnow it down to 168 players by the third stage.

14

Every one of those 168 players is going to either go on

15

the PGA Tour the next year or on the Nike Tour at the

16

time, and none of those players need ever have walked a

17

single hole, not only in the qualifying, but in their

18

lives.

19

QUESTION:

And they came in, paid

Mr. Reardon, all that proves, all

20

that proves is that you could play golf under different

rules, just as you can play baseball under different

rules.

has to bat is not fundamental to baseball.

Simply because that --

You're changing --

Simply because that's what they do.

MR. REARDON:

But Your Honor, but Your Honor --

19

I cite, I cite what happens in the Q School to demonstrate

20

the fact that walking is not indeed fundamental because

21

they don't require it.

22

QUESTION:

All that it demonstrates -- all that

23

it demonstrates is that you can play the game under a

24

different rule.

25

whole meaning of fundamentalness with regard to a sport.

I mean, what -- I don't understand the

27

1

Is it fundamental to baseball that, that the strike zone

be from the chest to the knees?

to the hips, couldn't it?

MR. REARDON:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. REARDON:

7

QUESTION:

It could be from the eyes

It could.

Would that make any difference?
Rules could be changed.

And could a player who has a

8

disability, which means he has, which causes him to have

9

an excessively long torso, could he demand that the umpire

10

call strikes on him from, you know, from his eyes to his

11

hips?

MR. REARDON:

No, he could not, Your Honor.

Of course he couldn't .
It's fundamental.

It's a silly rule.
It's fundamental to the game.

All sports rules are silly rules,

aren't they?
MR. REARDON:

I don't think it's a silly rule.

21

I think it gauges how well the pitcher can control the

22

ball and get it within the strike zone. Here we are

23

dealing with something that isn't fundamental.

24

in the Q School.

up and they present their handicap and their letters of

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Reardon, the Seventh Circuit

5

Court of Appeals in a strikingly similar case to this one

6

determined at the end of the day that the walking rule was

7

fundamental because it put additional physical stress on

8

each competitor after a tournament lasting several days

9

and perhaps in hotter inclement weather, and on hilly

10

conditions, it could impose quite an additional stress on

11

the players in the final rounds.

12

MR. REARDON:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

That's correct, Your Honor.

And therefore, that it was an aspect

of the physical challenge involved.
MR. REARDON:

That case is in this Court. That

16

case was decided on a different record from this record.

17

That case I don't think went into a very material aspect

18

of the proof in our case, which was the nature of the

19

disability, this tragic disability that he has, and what

20

it did in terms of whether or not a, a rule which would

21

require him to walk should be altered.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

Should the nature of the disability

make a difference?
MR. REARDON:

Basically because if it doesn't,

then you are not really gauging the second part, which is
29

1

to consider whether or not an alteration is going to do

2

something fundamentally. If it's a superficial disability,

3

giving a player an advantage may indeed result in an

4

alteration in that circumstance.

5
6

QUESTION:

Well, what would be your example of a

superficial disability?

7

MR. REARDON:

8

QUESTION:

9

Well, I think if you have an ingrown

toenail, it doesn't seem superficial.

10

(Laughter).

11

MR. REARDON:

QUESTION:

I think it's quite internal,

actually.

15

(Laughter).

16

MR. REARDON:

17

kind of a disability.

18

accommodated.

19

I agree with that, but, but the

Act, the Act --

13
14

Ingrown toenail, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

The Act does not accommodate that
Casey Martin's disability is indeed

Mr. Owens, are -- Mr. Reardon, you

20

said Mr. Olinger's case was different because it was on a

21

different record, and that's somewhat worrisome because

22

let's say you're right, that they do have to make

23

accommodations.

24

sufficiently disabled to get a dispensation from the

25

nonfundamental walking requirement?

Who is the judge of whether a person is

30

Is it up to the

1

lawyers and the quality of the record they make?

2

MR. REARDON:

I think it's initially up to the

3

public accommodation, in this case the PGA, to look at it

4

and decide.

5

QUESTION:

But you said the difference between

6

this case and the Olinger case is the record, and that's

7

made in court by advocates for a side.

8
9

MR. REARDON:

Yes, it is.

But I'm talking about

in advance of it getting to the courthouse.

If the PGA

10

had done what I respectfully suggest the law demands of

11

it, which was to take a look at the nature of the

12

disability, the individual disability of Casey Martin,

13

rather than returning his medical records without looking

14

at them, and returning the tape demonstrating the gravity

15

of his problem, they would have seen the disability and in

16

those circumstances --

17

QUESTION:

But did they do it on a case-by-case

18

basis or did they say we're troubled by this notion

19

because we think there are a lot of people who will say

20

it's a lot harder for us to walk, and we don't -- we won't

21

know where to draw the line?

22

MR. REARDON:

Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg, I

23

don't believe there will be a lot of cases, a lot of

24

people.

25

not had another lawsuit by a disabled person.

Because just taking our 1997 case, the PGA has

31

The USGA,

1

which is here, has had two lawsuits, basically similar

2

facts.

3

and the reason is, a person like Casey Martin is very

4

unique.

5

affecting where he hits the ball, how big the hole is or

6

anything else.

7

The only thing is his disability and the whole purpose of

8

the Act is to get people like Casey Martin a chance to get

9

to the game.

10

Now, there has not been a huge wave of litigation

He never asked for any modification of any rule

He plays every single rule of the game.

QUESTION:

What, what is the rule?

Didn't

11

organized baseball waive a rule in the case of Jim Abbott,

12

who had, I think, a hand -- what was the rule they waived?

13

Do you remember?

14

MR. REARDON:

As I understand the rule, Your

15

Honor, basically in baseball the pitcher is not supposed

16

to move the ball in his hand prior to delivery.

17

QUESTION:

And they waived that rule. Right?

18

MR. REARDON:

Regular pitchers take the ball, as

19

you see, they take it into their chest, hold the ball

20

behind the glove and then make the delivery.

21

QUESTION:

Now, how are we supposed to find out

22

whether this rule is more like that rule of looking at the

23

ball in baseball, or whether it's more like the rule that

24

Justice Scalia mentioned, namely the rule of having a

25

designated hitter?

How is the -- how are we supposed to
32

1

decide whether the rule is the one or the other?

2

MR. REARDON:

Okay.

I think what's very

3

important is to understand what the game is, what is the

4

competition?

5

promulgated by the U.S. Golf Association and St. Andrews,

6

this is the bible of golf.

7

virtually in the world, you play by these rules.

8

these rules say?

9

Now, when you look at the rules of golf,

If you want to play golf
What do

That's the game.

I know.

There is no rule in

But you realize I'm not the

I'm not very good at golf.

15

(Laughter.)

16

The -- the -- the real question is some rules

17

are like the designated hitter and they are part of the

18

game.

19

baseball before you throw it or hold it to your chest,

20

which isn't part of the game, at least not an essential

21

part.

22

question was raised and I want to be clear what the answer

23

to that is, and how do we find out?

24

personally.

25

Other rules are like whether you look at the

Now, how did we find out which is which because the

Not we, me

What's the system for finding out?

MR. REARDON:

I would respectfully suggest the
33

1

system is to look at the nature of the rule.

2

QUESTION:

Who?

3

MR. REARDON:

Initially it would be the public

4

accommodation.

5

waiver of the rule, then it has to go on up the line,

6

including to courts, if that's required.

7

If they don't agree that there should be a

QUESTION:

So courts look at that like they look

8

at any other rule of any other employer, public

9

accommodation, et cetera?

10
11

MR. REARDON:

Yes.

I don't see anything quite

frankly respectfully, extraordinary about that.

12

QUESTION:

Well, we get into a lot of unexpected

13

areas around here.

14

we have to give substantial deference to the sporting

15

authority?

16

But, Mr. Reardon, at the least, don't

MR. REARDON:

Actually, Justice Kennedy, if you

17

wind up giving substantial deference, in other words, if

18

you roll over and let them make a rule and say it's

19

substantive, and that's the end of the game, then you are

20

basically giving them a free pass out of the Americans

21

with Disabilities Act, which would be improper.

22

QUESTION:

Well, what -- we give deference to

23

agencies all the time.

It's not rolling over. It's just

24

an acknowledgment of who has the best expertise, who knows

25

the most about it, who is best equipped to make the
34

1

decision.

2

That's all it is.
MR. REARDON:

But it's, it's not just a decision

3

by the sport.

4

significant implication in the statute, which requires the

5

analysis.

6

sports can have --

7

There is an implication, and a very

This is not something where Congress said

QUESTION:

Mr. Reardon, can I ask you a question

8

to be sure I understand your theory about fundamentally

9

alter the nature of the game.

Are you contending that the

10

walking rule is never a fundamental -- abandoning the

11

walking rule, it would never be a fundamental rule, or are

12

you contending that with respect to Casey Martin, it's not

13

fundamental because his disability has the same impact on

14

his ability to play as walking has on other people?

15

is your theory?

16
17

MR. REARDON:

I would -- I'm trying to live with

both theories, if Your Honor please.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. REARDON:

Which

But I do believe --

Quite different.
-- that looking at, at his

20

disability is very important.

21

making the judgment to determine whether or not this

22

modification, taking into account his circumstances, is

23

really significant.

24

QUESTION:

25

Because it enables the one

Mr. Reardon, lest we seem as ignorant

of the rules of baseball as we may well be of the rules of
35

1

golf, and the former would be a much greater sin, I --

2

(Laughter).

3

I want to point --

4

QUESTION:

Wait a minute.

5

QUESTION:

In dissent again.

I want to point

6

out that your, your colleague does not agree that a

7

special exception was made for Jim Abbott, that they

8

believe that the rules of baseball did not prohibit what

9

he was doing.

The only thing that was prohibiting was

10

deceiving the base runner, and spinning the ball; so long

11

as it didn't deceive the base runner, it was okay.

12

don't have to resolve that here.

We

13

QUESTION:

I saw his --

14

QUESTION:

But I just want to be on the record

15

that we're aware of that problem.

16

(Laughter).

17

MR. REARDON:

I don't know if I've answered your

18

question, Justice Stevens, but I think it largely turns

19

initially at least on the condition of the disabled

20

person, and you look at that.

21

QUESTION:

Well then you're not contending that

22

the, if it, if it weren't for the particular nature of his

23

disability, that it would fundamentally alter the game?

24
25

MR. REARDON:

No.

Your Honor, I think if you

examine the way the PGA has handled the whole walking
36

1

rule, it's replete with exceptions, that you can't have

2

all of those exceptions and then argue it's essential

3

because that's what the -- you get to the definition --

4

QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me you can have a

5

different rule for qualifying and then have, than you have

6

for the final events.

7

consistently with the general rule, I'm not sure the, the

8

fact that it isn't fundamental in the sense you don't

9

really have to have it makes the difference.

10

And if the final events are all run

MR. REARDON:

But if you're testing the same

11

skills, that's very important to my argument, that what

12

are you testing.

13

handled the exceptions throughout, this is the over 50s,

14

just last week in Hawaii, and this is not in the brief,

15

but examples like this are in the brief.

16

couple of holes out in Hawaii on the Mercedes championship

17

that were difficult for the players to negotiate because

18

they were hilly.

19
20

And when you look at the way they

There are a

They took them by cars.

QUESTION:

Yeah, but they took them by cars, I

take it, for everybody.

21

MR. REARDON:

22

QUESTION:

Everybody.

And -- and therefore, the fact that

23

they took them by cars does not affect the assessment of

24

the relative abilities of the players, because they all

25

got the same dispensation.

Your brother's argument is
37

1

that a professional sport is entitled to define anything

2

as fundamental which could affect the relative, the

3

measurement or the indication of the relative ability of

4

the players. And he says walking or not walking does make

5

that kind of a difference.

6

to come on with some kind of a standard if, no matter how

7

we decide this case, why isn't that a reasonable standard

8

that should be respected under the Act?

9
10

MR. REARDON:

What is wrong -- and we've got

Because walking is not the game.

The game is hitting the ball and --

11

QUESTION:

No, but -- the game can -- we're not

12

talking about the game in the abstract. We're talking

13

about the PGA Tour, and if the people who make the rules

14

for the PGA Tour say we want to make this particular game

15

tougher than regular golf games, we are going to separate

16

another subset of people by making them walk, or at least

17

making them walk on most holes.

18

this rule.

19

is that not a, number one, a reasonable way for them to

20

draw the line, and why shouldn't we respect it?

21

Everybody has to play by

Why, if that could be outcome determinative,

MR. REARDON:

I think it -- you still have to

22

look at the rule to see whether that rule as imposed, or

23

as modified, giving an exception, would fundamentally

24

alter that game.

25

QUESTION:

I know it.
38

But their argument is,

1

that's -- but you're avoiding my question.

2

MR. REARDON:

3

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

I think.

Their argument is that if

4

it can affect the results, then we are entitled to define

5

it as fundamental in this kind of a game.

6

that it doesn't affect the results and therefore even on

7

their own theory, it shouldn't apply, and you have so

8

argued, and I understand that.

9

about that, is there something wrong with the legal

10
11

You may argue

But if you're not right

criterion that they are arguing for?
MR. REARDON:

Your Honor, what I think is wrong

12

with it is that you would basically be giving the PGA and

13

organized sports a free pass out from under the --

14

QUESTION:

I understand your argument, but their

15

response to that I think would be no, it's not a free pass

16

because if you can in fact show that this doesn't affect

17

the relative measurement of the players, that this is just

18

kind of a sham, then we couldn't enforce it.

19

be fundamental within the meaning.

20

MR. REARDON:

It wouldn't

And we haven't proposed the rule

21

as a sham, but we have, and rely upon the record, which

22

reflects the trial judge's conclusion after a six-day

23

trial, that walking was not a significant matter.

24

QUESTION:

Under normal circumstances.

25

MR. REARDON:

Under normal circumstances.

court's finding.

description of the, of the, what would it be, the extra

qualifying language?

11

held here in Washington in 1964, testimony by the player

12

who won it, Mr. Venturi.

13

literally did get exhausted. There was counter-testimony

14

that said the exhaustion came from dehydration, not from

15

walking, and there was spectators at that event who were

passing out. They weren't doing any walking.

MR. REARDON:

may have some relationship to performance, but may not.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD

25

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE
40

1

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

2

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

3

and may it please the Court:

This case presents an

4

important question of the coverage of the Disabilities

5

Act, as well as an issue of its application.

6

organization arranges a golf tournament and invites the

7

public to compete for the opportunity to participate, it

8

provides golfers with services, privileges, and advantages

9

of the golf course.

10

QUESTION:

When an

Miss Underwood, may I just ask a

11

question right there?

12

one side for a moment, at the time they have entries to

13

the golf tournament itself, the public can't just --

14

anybody just can't come in and say I want to play, only

15

those people who have graduated from the qualifying

16

school.

17

Putting the qualifying schools to

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, that's rather like the

18

fact that a university that, that offers, to which the

19

public can apply doesn't then admit the whole public.

20

has a selection process, and so what only, only the

21

admitted people can attend, but the university is a public

22

accommodation.

23

QUESTION:

The students are not performing.

It

The

24

professors are performing and the students, the students

25

are enjoying the performance of the professors.
41

1

(Laughter).

2

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Yes.

That's a different point.

3

All I meant was that the fact that there is a selection

4

process does not deprive an entity of its status as a

5

public accommodation.

6

compete, to attend, then that whole process is, is

7

something that's open, to which the public is invited.

8

On the separate point, what are the

9

If it's open to the public to

circumstances --

10

QUESTION:

Why is that any different with

11

respect to employees?

12

employees are enjoying the opportunity to work for you in

13

the place of public accommodation in which you employ

14

them?

15

these professional golfers who are making money by, by

16

putting on this entertainment are enjoying the opportunity

17

to do that.

18

Couldn't you say that awful your

That seems to me perfectly parallel to saying that

MS. UNDERWOOD:

You might be able to say that.

19

There are two -- the words would allow you to say that.

20

There are two reasons why you wouldn't. One is that

21

Congress made very clear that it was covering employees in

22

Title 1 and that it didn't intend to provide redundant

23

coverage in Title 3 so whatever one might say ab initio,

24

that possibility is excluded.

25

QUESTION:

Independent contractors would be
42

1

covered then.

2

provide services to the owner of the public accommodation

3

are enjoying the opportunity to provide him services.

4

The independent contractors who, who

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, I'd like to take, to

5

answer that in two steps because I take issue with the

6

proposition that these are employee-like independent

7

contractors.

8

be covered, but this is a much stronger case because in

9

fact, there is no independent contracting relationship

I do say that even if they were, they would

10

here.

11

obligation to perform, even in the way that an independent

12

contractor does.

13

The golfer does not, does not undertake any

He is simply --

QUESTION:

Doesn't he -- doesn't he have to

14

appear in a certain number of tournaments per year?

15

thought that was part of the commitment.

16

MS. UNDERWOOD:

I

He doesn't make a commitment to

17

-- it's my understanding of the record that he doesn't

18

make a commitment.

19

he won't be in the Tour anymore, but he, by qualifying and

20

being eligible to be in the Tour does not make a

21

commitment to participate.

22

QUESTION:

It is true that if he doesn't appear,

Well, that's just like saying an

23

independent contractor doesn't have to comply with his

24

contract there.

25

fired.

The only thing is if he doesn't, he gets

I mean, it's the same thing.
43

1

MS. UNDERWOOD:

It's not quite the same thing

2

because there is no contract, there is no contractual

3

commitment here at all.

4

QUESTION:

But you're saying, I take it you're

5

saying that they can't sue, the Tour can't sue the guy

6

that doesn't play enough games, they just drop him.

7

Whereas, they can sue the plumber who doesn't come if you

8

have to hire a more expensive plumber.

9

MS. UNDERWOOD:

That's correct.

In fact, PGA

10

Tour explained in the district court when they were

11

attempting to defeat the claim that this was an employee,

12

that it doesn't hire golfers, that it's a membership

13

organization, a professional association that arranges

14

playing opportunities for its members and promotes their

15

interests.

16

It provides opportunity for them.

17

for them.

18

It compared itself to the ABA in that regard.

QUESTION:

It provides services

May I -- may I ask you, Ms.

19

Underwood, if whether to decide in your favor, we have to

20

determine the general applicability of Title 3 of the ADA

21

to independent contractors?

22

MS. UNDERWOOD:

No, you do not.

In the -- that

23

is, the, the particular sort of entity or status of

24

Respondent here is, as I said, a much clearer case that he

25

is a consumer of the services or the privileges or
44

1
2

advantages of a public accommodation.
QUESTION:

Wait.

It was determined in this

3

case, as I understood it, that he was an independent

4

contractor; at least the district court thought so.

5

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, the district court said so

6

in the context of deciding that he wasn't an employee, as

7

if the only two options were that he was an employee or an

8

independent contractor.

9

couldn't take advantage of Title 1 for employees, the

That is, in deciding that he

10

court said he is not an employee, and looked to the body

11

of law that said people who aren't employees are

12

independent contractors.

13

the question whether he maybe was something else entirely,

14

a member or a potential member who was neither an employee

15

nor an independent contractor as that term is commonly

16

used in the working context. He simply wasn't a worker

17

here at all.

18

But I don't think that resolves

entertainment to the spectators, but that is simply a

false dichotomy.

3

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose any business which is

4

a successful business in the community holds out the

5

privilege of independent contracting as repairmen come in

6

and so forth, they are all independent contractors, and

7

I'm not quite sure how you distinguish that from, from the

8

golfers here.

9

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well the difference is, as I

10

said, I think there is an argument that even those

11

independent contractors could be covered, that the

12

Disability Act meant to open economic and social life to

13

people with disabilities and that --

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Let's -- let's assume I disagree with

that.
MS. UNDERWOOD:

Yes.

I think the simple answer

17

here is that the privilege of working for, for money in an

18

employee-like role is simply quite different from what is

19

happening when somebody participates in a competition.

20

The public accommodations laws, as we said earlier,

21

protect gamblers at a casino, or exhibitors at a craft

22

fair, or participants in a dance contest, whether there

23

are money prizes or not, whether the people who are

24

engaging in those competitions.

25

are doing it to make their living or are doing it as an
46

I mean, I think the --

1

avocation.

2

motivations of the different users of the services of that

3

accommodation.

4

employees.

5

It wouldn't work to distinguish the

They wouldn't be protected if they were

It's perfectly true that if golf arranged itself

6

differently, and had employees here, they wouldn't be

7

protected under Title 3.

8
9

QUESTION:

But the independent contractor

repairman has to do it for a living, and let's, let's

10

assume that we think that that's what these golfers are

11

doing.

12

What's the difference?
MS. UNDERWOOD:

The difference is that the

13

participation in a contest is a different sort of, that is

14

open to the public, is a different sort of thing from the

15

cut from the arrangement by contract, by employment

16

contract or by some other contract to provide services.

17

And I'd like to point out, of course, that

18

covering people like independent contractors or like

19

contest participants, which is what we have here under

20

Title 3 is not as has been suggested some sort of end run

21

around the limitations of Title 1.

22

QUESTION:

Are you then distinguishing the stage

23

-- one analogy that was made is the spectators are in the

24

theater, but what's going on in the stage, those people

25

are not relating to the space as a public accommodation.
47

1
2

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, you're making a comparison

to the theater, you mean?

3

QUESTION:

Yes.

4

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, in a theater, of course,

5

ordinarily there are employees so this issue, they

6

ordinarily are employees so this issue doesn't come up.

7

would suppose though, that if, if a, if a performer sought

8

to rent a performance space, he would be a consumer of

9

the, of that facility and could claim that he was being

10

discriminated against as a consumer of that facility.

11

That's not usually the way performers relate to

12

performance space.

13

QUESTION:

In your opinion, does it make a

I

14

difference if, if there is no easy classification, that

15

is, if a professional golfer is somehow unique, not this,

16

not some other thing, not an employee, not a contractor,

17

not a client, not exactly a customer, not a this, not a

18

that.

Does it matter?

19

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, I think that the purpose

20

of the Disabilities Act was to, was to be inclusive.

21

think that's clear both from the statute and from the

22

legislative history so that I would suggest that if

23

there's, that doubts should be resolved here in favor of

24

coverage.

25

that the, that the public accommodations title was meant

But I don't think it's unclear.

48

I

I think that,

1

to cover golf courses and participation in events at golf

2

courses so long as they are open to the public.

3

seems to me this is right in the heart of what the statute

4

was meant to reach.

QUESTION:

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR, III

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

9
10

MR. FARR:
me.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Excuse

Just a few brief points.

11

Responding in reverse order to the United

12

States' argument, first of all, they say that the reason

13

that employers, employees are not covered by Title 3 is

14

because that covers Title 1, but Title 1 doesn't cover all

15

employees.

16

employer.

17

covered and if you are not an employee of a covered

18

employer, you are not covered either.

19

States' position is that no employees are covered by Title

20

3, but really independent contractors or people similar to

21

that are in the same position essentially with respect to

22

Title 3 as noncovered employees under Title 1.

23

It only covers employees of a covered
You have to have at least 15 employees to be

Yet, the United

Secondly, the district court specifically said

24

that Respondent was an independent contractor, not just in

25

talking about Title 1, but on page 53 of the joint
49

1

appendix, it says, the district court says, I focus only

2

on the issue of whether he is entitled to his requested

3

accommodation, the use of a golf cart, as an independent

4

contractor playing in defendant's tournaments which are

5

held at places of public accommodation.

6

Now -- but I should point out, I mean, while he

7

is an independent contractor as defined by the district

8

court, our point is not exactly it turns on whether he is

9

an employee or an independent contractor.

Our point is he

10

is not a consumer of goods and services, and there are a

11

number of people who are not consumers.

Partners in a law firm, which is a type of public

Secondly, just to make the contrast between the

22

people who are also playing golf and who are covered,

recreational opportunities, educational opportunities.

25

Those are all things specifically mentioned in Title 3 in
