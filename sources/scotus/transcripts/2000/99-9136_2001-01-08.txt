CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 99-9136, Earthy Daniels v. United States.
Mr. Tanaka.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. MICHAEL TANAKA

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MR. TANAKA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Mr. Daniels was convicted of being an ex-felon

11

in possession of a firearm.

Normally, that charge carries

12

a maximum term of 10 years.

Where, however, the person

13

has suffered three qualifying felonies, that term, maximum

14

term goes up to life, and there's a mandatory minimum term

15

of 15 years, which Mr. Daniels was sentenced to.

16

Where those convictions are both

17

unconstitutional and unreliable, the resulting sentence is

18

likewise unconstitutional, and the issue before this case

19

is whether section 2255 provides a forum and remedy to

20

address that unconstitutionality of the sentence.

21

QUESTION:

May I ask whether the record shows

22

whether the petitioner challenged those '78 and '81

23

convictions in a timely manner on direct appeal at the

24

State and/or Federal level?

25

MR. TANAKA:

I don't believe that's in the
3

1

record.

2

those at the State level.

3

There is no indication that he has challenged

QUESTION:

You know, it seems to me that the

4

opportunity to make those challenges very likely occurred

5

when the convictions became final.

6

MR. TANAKA:

That's true, Your Honor, and I'm

7

sure that there was, in California, a procedure for direct

8

appeal and, lacking that, also collateral review of those

9

convictions, but that's not what's at issue today.

10

issue today is its use in the Federal sentencing

11

procedure, so --

12

QUESTION:

At

Well, why shouldn't there be a

13

measure of finality here?

14

back and argue was it constitutional, was it accurate, but

15

also there's an interest in getting things done within a

16

certain time frame.

17

MR. TANAKA:

I mean, you know, you can go

I agree, Your Honor, and there --

18

but there is finality with respect to those State

19

convictions.

20

convictions, he served the prior terms, he served his

21

imprisonment.

22

California judgment.

23
24
25

The State of California, he served those

Those convictions are final as to the

QUESTION:

Well, are there statutes of

limitations for habeas actions as well?
MR. TANAKA:

Certainly there are.
4

1
2

QUESTION:

And that being the case, this is an

end run around those, it seems to me.

3

MR. TANAKA:

No, I don't believe so, Justice

4

O'Connor.

The statute of limitation goes to the

5

underlying conviction, and certainly he had his chance to

6

challenge those, and that time has long since passed, and

7

we're not challenging that judgment, that conviction, but

8

when that conviction is used, again, to increase his

9

Federal sentence, then necessarily the Federal court must

10

look at its reliability, otherwise it's a violation of due

11

process.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Tanaka, even if you're right that

13

there's no bar from challenging the Federal, the abuse in

14

the Federal proceeding, shouldn't the Federal court at

15

least take into account, in determining whether 2255

16

really is warranted, that these matters could have been

17

raised earlier in the State proceedings on direct appeal

18

or on collateral attack?

19

MR. TANAKA:

No, I don't believe so, Your Honor.

20

Again, the Federal interest is totally different than the

21

State interest.

22

The State has no --

QUESTION:

Why shouldn't the Federal interest

23

include did this person have a reason for not bringing

24

this up earlier?

25

might try to knock out for Federal sentencing purposes an

I mean, one can imagine cases where you

5

1

earlier State conviction and say, there was a procedural

2

impediment, or there was a reason I didn't know about this

3

until much later, like Brady material that wasn't turned

4

over?

5

for the 2255 purpose you would have to show a good reason

6

for not raising it earlier in the State courts?

Shouldn't there be at least that requirement, that

7

MR. TANAKA:

I agree that that would explain,

8

and there certainly would be cases where that would

9

explain why it wasn't raised, and that perhaps presents a

10

more compelling case, but I don't think it's a

11

prerequisite, and the reason for that is --

12

QUESTION:

13

clear on one thing.

14

there was any special reason why these matters could not

15

have been raised earlier?

16

But you're -- but I wanted just to be
You're not saying in this case that

MR. TANAKA:

That's correct, I'm not making any

17

claim that he was prevented by something external to

18

himself that prevented him from raising this in State

19

court, but I don't think the argument depends on that.

20

Again --

21

QUESTION:

You said a few times that the -- this

22

is just a Federal matter, it's final as far as the law of

23

the State is concerned.

24

an interest in the integrity that's accorded to its

25

judgments in this proceeding?

Does the State of California have

6

1

MR. TANAKA:

The State of California has an

2

interest in the integrity of its judgments.

Where -- and

3

I guess the State of California has some perhaps minimal

4

interest in whether its judgment is used conclusively as a

5

Federal sentencing predicate.

6

QUESTION:

Well, I think it would have a very

7

strong interest.

It has its own three-strikes rule, as I

8

understand, and is this man a resident of the State of

9

California?

I assume he is.

It seems to me it has a very

10

strong interest in having its judgments of criminal

11

convictions respected.

12

MR. TANAKA:

13

QUESTION:

Well, we -And to say that, oh, this is just a

14

Federal matter, it's final so far as the law of the State

15

is concerned, I'm not sure is a complete answer.

16

MR. TANAKA:

Well, it is respected in the sense

17

that it has a presumptive validity, and certainly this

18

Court's case in Custis established that fact, and no one's

19

suggesting that we go behind that validity once it's

20

presented, but there's -- I don't know that it has an

21

interest in a conclusive-type validity, especially where

22

it's being used as a Federal sentencing predicate.

23

QUESTION:

Now --

Well, supposing that there's a

24

thought, you win on your ability to challenge, and it's

25

thought there's necessary to be a evidentiary hearing.

1

What incentive does the State have at that point to come

2

in and try to show that the conviction was properly

3

obtained?

4

MR. TANAKA:

I don't know that the State would

5

necessarily be a party.

6

much incentive --

7

QUESTION:

I don't believe they have very

Then it's a very strange proceeding.

8

You're challenging the judgment of a State, and yet the

9

State isn't a party?

10

MR. TANAKA:

But it's the Federal Government

11

that's seeking to use that judgment as a Federal

12

sentencing predicate to increase the Federal sentence in

13

Federal court.

14

QUESTION:

And if you prevail and you go ahead

15

and have the judgment declared invalid, I -- what would

16

happen if the State in a subsequent proceeding tried to

17

use those convictions for its own three-strikes rule?

18

MR. TANAKA:

I would assume that the State could

19

validly use those convictions in its own three-strike

20

rule, because the Federal sentence, the Federal procedure

21

would just invalidate the State conviction, or the use of

22

the State conviction, not the State conviction itself, as

23

a means to lengthen the Federal sentence.

24
25

QUESTION:

The --

Well, if the State uses the

conviction, it's -- the conviction is just as unreliable
8

1

when the State uses it as when the Feds use it, and I take

2

it the reason that you concede that the State could use it

3

is that there was an understanding, or we have to assume

4

that there was an understanding on the part of the

5

prisoner that this kind of collateral use and enhancement

6

of later sentences might be a consequence of that

7

conviction, and yet he did nothing about it.

8
9

Is that essentially your theory?

In other

words, he knew what the risks were, and he did not take

10

any steps to alleviate those risks by bringing a State

11

collateral attack or by going on with his appeal or

12

whatnot.

13
14
15
16

Is that essentially your theory?
MR. TANAKA:

Certainly that's part of it, but

the -- now the -QUESTION:

Why doesn't -- I'm sorry.

Go ahead.

You -- That was part of it.

17

MR. TANAKA:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. TANAKA:

Yes, I agree -What's the other part?
Well, the other part would be that

20

the State would obviously not be bound by anything that

21

happened in the Federal proceeding.

22

QUESTION:

Well, no, but let's forget Federal

23

proceedings for a moment.

If we just have a State

24

proceeding and the State is going to use that supposedly

25

unreliable conviction as a basis for enhancement following
9

1

a subsequent conviction, nothing unfair about that, I take

2

it, on your view, because the prisoner knew that such use

3

could be made of it, and the prisoner let the time for

4

attacking the conviction pass.

5

theory?

6

MR. TANAKA:

That's essentially your

That could well be.

There could

7

well be due process problems associated with its

8

subsequent use in the State, but it might be that those

9

problems are --

10

QUESTION:

Well, what are they?

I mean, I -- if

11

it's not unfair for the State to use it, despite the

12

assumption of its unreliability, what would a -- what

13

other due process problem might arise at the State level?

14

MR. TANAKA:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. TANAKA:

That would be the problem.
That would be the problem, and -But it might be that the problem

17

doesn't rise to a large enough level that the State

18

necessarily violates due process by refusing to litigate

19

that anew.

20

In other words -QUESTION:

Well, the State -- but I -- the

21

theory of my question was, he in effect was on notice that

22

there might be a subsequent use of the conviction for

23

enhancement purposes.

24

He didn't litigate.

25

due process sense, for the State to use it, and I thought

He had an opportunity to litigate.
Therefore, it is not unfair, in the

10

1

that was probably what underlay your suggestion that the

2

State could use it for enhancement purposes.

3

MR. TANAKA:

4

QUESTION:

I agree with that.
All right.

Now, why can't the Fed --

5

why can't a Federal court use it for enhancement purposes?

6

He was on notice that there might be a later enhancement.

7

He did nothing about it.

8

the Federal level, doesn't it?

9

MR. TANAKA:

The same reasoning applies at

The -- there is a -- there is no

10

problem with notice, and -- but that again suggests the

11

concept of waiver, or maybe even sandbagging.

12

QUESTION:

Well, not waiver.

Not -- we're not

13

talking about waiver.

We talking about, I think, the fact

14

that he had an opportunity to litigate it.

15

as you conceded a moment ago, there are statutes of

16

limitations that govern these things in most instances.

17

You've got to litigate within that time or it's too late,

18

so he let, in effect, his opportunity to litigate pass.

As you so --

19

Now, if that -- and therefore it's not unfair,

20

in a due process sense, to use it against him even if he

21

does claim later that it was unreliable.

22

Now, if that is a sound argument with respect to

23

its use for enhancement purposes at the State level, why

24

isn't it an equally good argument with respect to its use

25

in this case at the Federal level?
11

1

MR. TANAKA:

I'm sorry, perhaps I didn't

2

understand the predicate of your question when I first

3

answered.

4

process problem with using the unreliable conviction

5

whether you're using it to enhance a State sentence or a

6

Federal sentence.

7
8
9

I believe I answered that there is a due

QUESTION:

Then what's left of the statute of

limitations that you concede can be applied?
I thought you conceded that the statute of

10

limitations on this kind of litigation could, consistently

11

with due process, be applied at the State level.

12

did not concede that, then I will withdraw my question.

13

MR. TANAKA:

Okay.

If you

It could be applied at the

14

State level to the initial State conviction.

15

if, analogous to this case, that conviction was used in a

16

State proceeding to enhance a subsequent State sentence,

17

then there might -- there would be a due process right to

18

examine that conviction anew --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. TANAKA:

21
22

Okay, again,

Let me ask you --- with respect to the enhancement

provision -QUESTION:

With respect to, at the State level,

23

let me ask you one more question.

24

State had a statute and the statute were made -- was

25

explained to the defendant at the time of his State
12

Let's assume that the

1
2

sentence, and the statute read as follows:
This conviction can be used to enhance sentences

3

following later convictions.

4

validity of this conviction, you must challenge it within

5

1 year, or it's too late.

6

If you wish to challenge the

Let's assume that the State had such a statute,

7

that was explained to the prisoner at the time of the

8

first sentence, and he didn't litigate within 1 year.

9

State then wants to use it to enhance following a

The

10

subsequent conviction.

11

the State's use of it without an opportunity to challenge?

12
13
14

MR. TANAKA:

Is there a due process problem in

There well could be, if there's

some unreliability of the conviction.
QUESTION:

So there can -- I take it your

15

theory, then, is that no amount of warning in the world

16

will ever be enough to allow the State or the Federal

17

Government to treat the first conviction with finality?

18

MR. TANAKA:

No.

There -- as long as there's a

19

procedure, a substantive due process procedure for

20

litigating that, it could be that, consistent with due

21

process, there could be some limitations and in that case

22

that might well be one of them.

23

QUESTION:

Well, what about my limitation?

24

You've got a year to challenge this if you want to

25

challenge it, and if you don't challenge it within the
13

1

year it's too late and it can used for enhancement

2

purposes, and the year expires, it's going to be used for

3

enhancement purposes, he wants to challenge it, and the

4

State says no, it's too late, the year is over.

5

consistent with due process?

Is that

6

MR. TANAKA:

7

QUESTION:

Okay.

8

QUESTION:

I assume that your theory would apply

9

I think it well could be.

not just to enhancement questions but also to any other

10

disabilities attaching to the prior criminal conviction.

11

Specifically, I believe that California, like many States,

12

disqualifies convicted felons from voting.

13

your client have presented himself at the registration

14

booth for voting and, when told that he could not vote

15

because he was a felon, could he say, oh, but that

16

conviction was invalid and I want an opportunity to

17

challenge it?

18

MR. TANAKA:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. TANAKA:

Now, could

No, I don't believe so, Your Honor.
Why not?
The difference is this.

In this

21

case -- due process is obviously a flexible concept, and

22

what's at stake here is 1) an automatic increase in the

23

sentence and 2) a dramatic increase in the sentence.

24

sentence went from presumptively 7 years to more than

25

double, to a min -- to a minimum of 15 years.
14

The

1

QUESTION:

The right to vote is worth something,

2

too.

3

restrictions upon what the State can do.

4

have the right to -- you're saying you cannot use the

5

conviction for anything except sending him to jail upon

6

the first conviction.

7

increase his sentence on the later conviction, I don't see

8

why you also don't have to say you can't use it to disable

9

him from voting.

10

We protect that with many due process and other
Why shouldn't he

MR. TANAKA:

If you say you can't use it to

Oh, I think there's certainly a

11

greater liberty interest with respect to imprisonment,

12

but --

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Tanaka, in your last series of

14

answers you seem to be departing from what I thought was

15

the clear line you took in your brief.

16

That is, for all State purposes you are

17

accepting that this sentence is good, and you are

18

distinguishing the Federal enhancement from any other --

19

from any State law consequence, but now in your answer to

20

the questions that Justice Souter and Justice Scalia just

21

asked you seem to be saying it's not just the Federal

22

enhancement purpose that you're questioning where this can

23

be brought up but also in the State proceeding as well.

24
25

MR. TANAKA:

No, I don't believe so.

Obviously

the only fact at issue here is the -- is its use in the
15

1

Federal proceeding, and --

2

QUESTION:

You kept saying in your brief that

3

you're not touching the State consequences of this, that

4

those are a given, and you accept those, but your answers

5

here depart from that view, so which is it?

6

MR. TANAKA:

7

brief.

8

conviction.

9

I'll stick with what I said in the

We're not challenging any State use of this

QUESTION:

But we're trying to understand why

10

that should be.

I -- my understanding of your submission

11

is that there is a Federal constitutional right under the

12

Due Process Clause not to have this conviction used in

13

Federal court.

14

argument if it's a State three-strike conviction case?

Why is -- why don't you make the same

15

MR. TANAKA:

16

QUESTION:

One might -It's a Federal due process right not

17

to have what you call an unreliable or a false conviction

18

used -- again, it's the same analysis, same Constitution.

19

What's the difference?

20

MR. TANAKA:

And one might, if one were arguing

21

that case, argue that, and I think there -- but there are

22

certainly different considerations there, because if the

23

Federal court is reviewing the State court's use of its

24

own recidivist provisions, then there are more comity and

25

finality questions that aren't at issue here.
16

1

That's what distinguishes this case, is that all

2

we're doing in this case is looking at the Federal court

3

examining a Federal sentence under 2255, which explicitly

4

provides for that review.

5

State court judgment, and that's the position I took in

6

the brief and that's the position I take here, that the

7

State judgment, we're leaving that alone.

8
9

There's no intrusion in the

Nothing that the Federal district court's going
to do in granting that 2255 motion and finding this

10

conviction too unreliable to automatically sentence this

11

man to an additional 8 years in prison is going to affect

12

that State court judgment.

13

QUESTION:

What I'm trying to have -- my problem

14

is -- I agree with you basically.

15

things should be challengeable in a sentencing proceeding.

16

I wrote an opinion to that effect in Palleo, and it was

17

reversed by this Court, so now what do I do?

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. TANAKA:

20

QUESTION:

You realize that these

Well, you use your -I mean, my problem is, quite

21

honestly, that I don't see any way, if you're not -- I

22

think these things -- I think a prior should be

23

challengeable in the sentencing hearing, all right?

24

That's clear, simple, done all the time, no problem, fair.

25

All right.
17

1

No, but there's an opinion that says no.

Now,

2

given that opinion, I think I'm stuck, unless I were to

3

accept this argument that the -- I see you make an

4

argument about the constitutionality, which I think is

5

interesting, but I'm not sure about that one.

6

anything else?

7

point, if I would have been with the dissenters in

8

Custis -- but I believe in stare decisis.

9

right?

10

Is there

If I don't accept that constitutional

MR. TANAKA:

I'm stuck,

Well, if you don't accept that

11

constitutional point that the use of an unreliable prior

12

conviction that doesn't implicate the person -- doesn't

13

implicate the person's guilt can be automatically used to

14

dramatically increase the sentence conclusively, then

15

we're both stuck, unless you can use your powers of

16

persuasion to change the Court's decision, but --

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. TANAKA:

19
20

That's certainly the genesis of

this argument.
QUESTION:

May I just ask one question?

Are you

21

really making a constitutional argument, or are you

22

arguing for a construction of section 2255, or is it both?

23

MR. TANAKA:

It's both.

Certainly the case

24

depends on a construction of 2255 to remedy what is an

25

obvious constitutional violation.
18

By its plain language,

1

2255 allows someone sentenced in Federal court to

2

challenge that sentence as being unconstitutional, and it

3

gives the sentencing court the power to correct that

4

sentence as, in fact, a constitutional --

5

QUESTION:

But does your position have to rest

6

on the premise that the sentence would be unconstitutional

7

if the State conviction were -- that the Federal sentence

8

would be unconstitutional if the State sentence were

9

invalid?

10

MR. TANAKA:

11

QUESTION:

Not just invalid -You see, it seems to me it would be

12

theoretically possible to say, for a legislature to say,

13

we wanted to enhance a sentence if there's a State

14

conviction out there, and we don't care whether it's

15

obtained fairly or not.

16

and he went to jail for a while, and that's enough for us.

17

Is it your view that they could not do that?

18

MR. TANAKA:

The fellow was at least indicted

Yes.

Where it can be shown that

19

that conviction doesn't reliably indicate the man's guilt

20

I believe -- well, it's my position that that violates the

21

Constitution and the Due Process Clause.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Tanaka, I have a question

23

concerning a point you made in your brief.

24

the 2255 forum is accustomed to dealing with questions of

25

this nature, and you distinguished that from the
19

You said that

1

sentencing forum in Custis, but it seems to me it's the

2

same forum.

3

different proceeding but in the same court, so I did not

4

follow what you were getting at when you were saying that

5

the 2255 forum is accustomed to dealing with these kinds

6

of questions but the sentencing judge is not, when it's

7

one and the same judge.

8
9

It's the same district judge, just a

MR. TANAKA:

Well, the point was that normally a

sentencing procedure is rather quick and summary, whereas

10

a proceeding on a 2255 case, there might be an evidentiary

11

hearing and the scheduling and so forth would be

12

different, and also there are rules that govern 2255 cases

13

that don't govern sentencing, and so it's more

14

appropriately placed there.

15

But the major point is that 2255 expressly

16

provides for this type of procedure, whereas you know,

17

obviously there's nothing in the sentencing statute that

18

likely, likewise provides for it.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Tanaka, you say that what you

20

want to challenge is State court convictions that,

21

judgments that do not reliably indicate guilt.

22

take it you would allow a challenge on the basis that a

23

Miranda warning wasn't given, and that there was some --

24

it was not harmless error, and yet a Miranda warning

25

really has nothing to do with guilt.
20

Well, I

1

I mean, there are certainly different

2

constitutional claims which can be vindicated in the

3

proper forum but don't really bear on guilt or innocence,

4

so are you limiting your challenges to those which clearly

5

affect guilt, or to any constitutional claim that would be

6

sustained if timely brought?

7

MR. TANAKA:

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

I believe

8

that the due process analysis leads to the conclusion that

9

you can only challenge convictions that don't reliably

10

indicate guilt.

11

process violation and a constitutional violation.

12
13

There's not an identity between a due

If the Court has no further questions, I'd like
to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

14

QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Tanaka.

15

Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you.

16

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18
19
20

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In Custis v. United States this Court made clear

21

that at a Federal sentencing proceeding a defendant who

22

faces recidivist sentencing may not bring a constitutional

23

challenge to the validity of the underlying enhancement

24

conviction.

25

where it --

We submit that the same principle applies

21

1

QUESTION:

With certain exceptions.

2

MR. DREEBEN:

With the exception of a conviction

3

that was entered in violation of Gideon v. Wainwright,

4

that's correct, Justice Stevens.

5
6

QUESTION:

You think that's the only such

exception?

7

MR. DREEBEN:

I think that that is the line that

8

the Court drew in Custis, Justice O'Connor.

9

that on a variety of considerations.

It rested

The first was that

10

the Court's jurisprudence had recognized Gideon violations

11

as a unique constitutional defect that rose even to the

12

level of a jurisdictional defect.

13
14

The second two reasons I think are the ones that
most clearly explain the rule that we're espousing here.

15

QUESTION:

Well, how about a so-called Brady

16

violation, where the facts aren't known until maybe

17

immediately before the sentencing proceeding in the new

18

crime?

19

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, there are two distinctions

20

between that kind of a situation and the Gideon situation.

21

The one that I think is most applicable to the majority of

22

cases that are going to come up in this context is that a

23

Brady violation is a very fact-intensive inquiry.

24

can't be resolved, as the Court noted in Custis with

25

respect to a Gideon claim, simply by looking at the
22

It

1

judgment or the judgment role and determining whether the

2

defendant had counsel.

3

It requires instead a fairly intricate analysis

4

of whether the Government suppressed and withheld

5

information that the defendant couldn't with due diligence

6

have gained access to, and whether there was resulting

7

prejudice to the defendant as a consequence, and the

8

administrative costs of adjudicating that are far more

9

substantial and very intrusive into the sentencing process

10

as compared to Gideon.

11
12

QUESTION:

Well, what about a DNA claim in a

death case coming up later?

13

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, the second -- I think,

14

Justice O'Connor, that is the second distinction in your

15

hypothetical, that the hypothetical posits that this was

16

information about a constitutional claim that could not

17

with due diligence have been obtained, I'm assuming within

18

any time for bringing an appropriate appeal or collateral

19

challenge.

20

The capital context is unique in that area, I

21

think, and I'm going to set it aside, because questions of

22

actual innocence in the capital context would be dealt

23

with under the Eighth Amendment and would implicate

24

constitutional principles that aren't broadly applicable.

25

But as to the generality of sentencing cases, I
23

1

think that the basic rule is that there is a system in

2

place to challenge convictions that balances two

3

fundamental interests.

4

in fundamental fairness.

5

One is in finality, the other is

Those two interests have always been

6

accommodated not by giving one total sway over the other,

7

but by saying that in certain contexts there are claims

8

that are available and they may be brought, and if they

9

are brought in a manner that's compatible with the

10

procedural limitations such as statute of limitations,

11

procedural default, exhaustion, Teague v. Lane, if they

12

surmount those hurdles, then the interests of vindicating

13

the Constitution take precedence over the interests of

14

finality.

15

But if those procedural hurdles have not been

16

met, and the defendant did not bring his claim in

17

accordance with the procedures that are set out, then

18

society is entitled to take that conviction as

19

conclusively final, and any further remedy that would be

20

available would have to come from the executive branch --

21

QUESTION:

Do you make that argument even if

22

it's a Gideon violation?

In other words, say that it's a

23

final sentencing, the defendant had either no counsel or

24

inadequate counsel, and didn't learn that there was a

25

Gideon violation before and he'd already served his
24

1

sentence for the crime where there was the Gideon

2

violation, could he raise that or not?

3
4

MR. DREEBEN:

Under this Court's decision in

Custis he may at the Federal sentencing raise it, and I --

5

QUESTION:

No, no, not at the Federal

6

sentencing.

7

sentencing judge relies on a prior State conviction which

8

was invalid because there was a Gideon violation, but

9

nobody called that to the attention of the court.

10

Say he gets sentence, and then by mistake the

MR. DREEBEN:

That would be a procedural

11

default, Justice Stevens, and I think it would bar the

12

defendant from coming back even if there were otherwise a

13

right to come back under applicable procedure.

14

QUESTION:

Would that be true even if the

15

sentence had not been served where there was a Gideon

16

violation?

17
18
19
20
21

MR. DREEBEN:

The sentence of the -- the

underlying conviction -QUESTION:

This would always have to have been

served, wouldn't it?
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, if the underlying conviction

22

sentence had not been served, then the defendant's remedy

23

would be to go back into the jurisdiction that entered it

24

and see if he can comply with --

25

QUESTION:

He couldn't then go in on a 2255 and
25

1

call that to the court's attention and get relief, in your

2

view?

3

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think so, Justice Stevens,

4

because he has the right to do that under Custis at the

5

Federal sentencing proceeding itself, and the failure to

6

bring that claim at a timely point in the proceeding, when

7

it is available, would constitute a default, and then he

8

would be left with the argument --

9

QUESTION:

Even if he had -- even if it was

10

inadequate assistance of counsel?

11

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, inadequate assistance of

12

counsel isn't even permitted to be brought under this

13

Court's decision in Custis with respect to the underlying

14

conviction.

15

With respect to the conviction that -- the

16

Federal conviction that was entered, ineffective

17

assistance of counsel claims typically are not brought in

18

the original sentencing court that imposed the conviction

19

because the defendant typically has the same counsel and

20

because the facts haven't been developed, and therefore

21

there is no procedural default typically in bringing an

22

ineffective assistance claim directed to the Federal

23

conviction in a section 2255 proceeding.

24
25

But as to the underlying enhancement conviction,
which is what we are talking about here, petitioner is
26

1

saying that I suffered from ineffective assistance of

2

counsel with respect to a 1978 robbery conviction that is

3

now being used to enhance my 1992 Federal sentence, and I

4

should have the right, on 2255, to litigate that 16-year-

5

old, or 19-year-old claim, and we submit that the Court's

6

decision in Custis says you can't do that at the Federal

7

sentencing and you therefore cannot do that on the 2255

8

proceeding.

9

QUESTION:

Yes, but it's the therefore part that

10

I guess is giving us all the trouble, and the reason it's

11

giving me trouble is, number 1 -- of course, I was a

12

dissenter in Custis, so maybe I'm looking for trouble --

13

(Laughter.)

14

QUESTION:

-- but the Court in -- the majority

15

in Custis left the question open whether there could be

16

another means of challenge other than the challenge at the

17

Federal sentencing proceeding as such.

18

And number 2, textually, what the petitioner

19

wants to do can be fitted within the terms of 2255, and

20

the issue I guess boils -- so I think it's -- I don't

21

think Custis is controlling, and what the issue boils down

22

to for me is this.

23

the balance struck on the issues of finality and fairness

24

require a point at which so far as the service of the

25

original sentence, the '78 sentence in your example is

I will -- I accept your argument that

27

1

concerned, the litigation has got to stop.

2

But it seems to me that that balance is entirely

3

different when you get into the subsequent proceeding in

4

which, for example,

5

fairness argument is not, say, a sentence of 5 years or 10

6

years as under the first conviction, whatever it was, but

7

a sentence potentially of life, and when suddenly the

8

stakes change that radically in the Federal proceeding,

9

then the old finality-fairness balance simply doesn't

what is at stake in the finality

10

apply any more because the terms have changed, and when

11

the terms change radically, as they have here, why isn't

12

it possible to reassess that balance and say, okay, now,

13

even though you couldn't litigate for State purposes, you

14

can litigate for Federal purposes?

15

MR. DREEBEN:

The fundamental problem with that,

16

Justice Souter, is that those same interests are fully at

17

stake in the Custis situation itself.

18

said --

19

QUESTION:

When this Court

Yeah, but Custis -- that may be true,

20

but number 1, Custis depended in part on a statutory

21

construction reason.

22

sentencing enhancement statute and, number 2, Custis left

23

this question open.

They looked at the text of the

The Court said --

24

MR. DREEBEN:

25

QUESTION:

If I could address that --

-- we're not telling you what we'll
28

1
2

do in this subsequent situation, but they left it open.
MR. DREEBEN:

That actually is not the question

3

that the Court left open in Custis, Justice Souter.

4

the Court left open in Custis is the following scenario.

5

Take Custis himself.

What

After Custis is sentenced,

6

the question that was raised in Custis was, could he then

7

go back to the State court that had entered the

8

enhancement conviction and obtain a judgment that that

9

conviction was constitutionally invalid, and then come

10

back to the Federal sentencing court and apply for

11

reopening of his Federal sentence, and the crucial

12

difference between that scenario and the scenario that's

13

presented here is that the litigation over the validity of

14

that sentence would take place in the State court.

15

QUESTION:

Oh, you're entirely right, but

16

didn't -- I don't have it in front of me.

17

Court also refer to the possibility of litigation on

18

Federal habeas?

19
20
21

MR. DREEBEN:

Didn't the

Litigation on Federal habeas

corpus that attacked the State sentence.
QUESTION:

Right, but the only basis on which

22

there could be Federal habeas litigation would be Federal

23

habeas litigation in connection with the later Federal

24

sentence, even though the subject of that litigation might

25

be, or would be the validity of the earlier State
29

1

sentence --

2

MR. DREEBEN:

3

QUESTION:

4

No, I don't think that that is --

-- and therefore it seems to me this

was left open.

5

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I don't think that that's

6

what the opinion says, because it talks about Custis

7

having been in custody still on his State sentences.

8
9
10

QUESTION:

The last sentence of the opinion

says, may attack his State sentence in Maryland or through
a Federal habeas review.

11

MR. DREEBEN:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. DREEBEN:

Correct.

Okay.
And Federal habeas review is

14

Federal review under 2254 --

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Four, right.
-- that attacks the State

17

sentence.

This is a case under section 2255, attacking

18

the constitutionality of the Federal sentence.

19

QUESTION:

Well, did --

20

MR. DREEBEN:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. DREEBEN:

The necessary --

Didn't we confine it to 2254?
The language says, I think

23

accurately, just what Justice Stevens read, and I would

24

interpret Federal habeas review in that context to mean

25

Federal review under 2254 attacking the prior State
30

1
2
3
4

sentence.
QUESTION:

It certainly does include that.

I

don't know that it was limited.
MR. DREEBEN:

If it were not limited to that, it

5

would be odd to say that the defendant could then come and

6

apply for reopening of this Federal sentence, because

7

that's exactly what section 2255 is all about.

8

saying there's something wrong with the Federal sentence

9

that was imposed, and we know from Custis --

10

QUESTION:

It is

But the reason may be the textual

11

reason in Custis, going to the text of the enhancement

12

statute itself.

13

Congress wanted sentencing to be clean and simple and

14

leaving any later attack to be worked out afterwards.

15

other words, get him shut away and then let him litigate

16

as long as he wants to.

17

It may be that we wanted sentencing,

MR. DREEBEN:

In

But the theory behind section 2255

18

litigation in this case is that there was a constitutional

19

violation at the Federal sentencing.

20

QUESTION:

Right.

21

MR. DREEBEN:

Because sentence was imposed based

22

on a conviction that, although facially valid and never

23

set aside by any court, might be unreliable if one took

24

the time to unpack the claim that petitioner is now making

25

and get the records and litigate it and determine whether
31

1

it's valid or not, and the Custis court held there is no

2

constitutional violation in imposing sentence without

3

adjudicating that claim and, further, by leaving open the

4

question that we've been discussing, the Court made clear

5

that it's not inherently indispensable that there be any

6

place left to litigate a claim that is based on a

7

conviction that is 16 years old in this case, 19 years

8

old, that the two convictions the petitioner is raising.

9

QUESTION:

Let's assume, though -- and I realize

10

you don't concede this, of course, but assume that Custis

11

did leave open the possibility of this litigation.

12

you go back to the, we'll say the balance argument?

13

Would

My point is that the balance between finality

14

and fairness changes radically when you go from the

15

limited jeopardy of imprisonment under the State

16

conviction to the potentiality here of life imprisonment,

17

and if the balance is that radically affected, why

18

shouldn't there be, for due process purposes, an

19

opportunity to litigate at the Federal level, even though

20

the State proceeding is past and final for State purposes?

21

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Souter, I think the

22

fundamental answer to that question goes back to the

23

interests in finality that have been struck in this

24

Court's post-conviction jurisprudence generally.

25

a recognition that there are fundamental interests in
32

There is

1

having an unconstitutional conviction overturned, but they

2

are counterbalanced by other interests such as the

3

fairness and reliability of the adjudication of that

4

claim.

5

Now, here we are talking about a claim by

6

petitioner that when he entered his guilty plea 16 years

7

ago and 19 years ago he wasn't adequately informed about

8

one of the elements of the offense and therefore, he says,

9

he didn't enter a knowing and voluntary guilty plea.

10

Now, that's the kind of claim that can routinely

11

be made on direct appeal or upon an immediate

12

post-conviction attack, and it's made with the State that

13

entered the judgment as a party, and the State can come

14

back and say we have access to these records, they're very

15

easy to determine, you can see that the judge went over

16

him, the various elements, or his lawyer counseled him

17

about the various elements of the crime and the court can

18

reach a reliable adjudication promptly on whether that

19

conviction is valid.

20

A defendant who doesn't challenge his guilty

21

plea in that fashion at the time that it's available to do

22

so is essentially saying, I struck a deal with the

23

Government, the deal allows me perhaps to reduce my time

24

of imprisonment compared to what it would have been if I

25

had gone to trial and lost, as I probably would have been,
33

1

would have lost, therefore I'm going to enter a guilty

2

plea and establish finality, and I'm not going to take an

3

appeal, because if I appeal and win at this juncture I'll

4

probably be back right in the position that I started in,

5

namely, facing a trial and a potentially longer sentence.

6

QUESTION:

And it's perfectly fair for due

7

process purposes or any others, on any other fairness

8

standard, to hold the prisoner to that bargain.

9

what the terms were.

He knew

The trouble is now, the terms have

10

changed, and it's not only very difficult to litigate this

11

later, but it's also very difficult to stay in prison for

12

life, and when the terms have changed, the calculus that

13

says, or that said in the first instance it's fair to hold

14

you to your bargain, doesn't apply any more, because the

15

terms have changed.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

But the risk that he faced,

17

Justice Souter, was one that he either knew actually or

18

should have known at the time that he entered that plea.

19

QUESTION:

All right, let's -- I understand that

20

argument, too, and I just don't see how it is sound.

The

21

truth is, in the real world, prisoners, when they enter

22

these guilty pleas, are not thinking of the possibility of

23

life in prison 25 years later for a crime that hasn't been

24

committed yet.

25

realistic, to say that he knew or should have known that

I mean, I just don't think that that is

34

1
2

this could happen.
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, apart from the fact that the

3

Court in Nichols v. United States said that it's the kind

4

of thing that prisoners do know when they're sentenced,

5

that if they're seen back again they're going to face more

6

serious consequences from it --

7

QUESTION:

They -- more serious consequences,

8

yes, but this is a serious consequence of a different

9

order of magnitude.

10

MR. DREEBEN:

I think that recidivism statutes

11

are among the most common kind of statutes in the criminal

12

justice world.

13

Government has one.

14

QUESTION:

All 50 States have them.

The Federal

There's a great deal -Well, recidivism, yes, but we're --

15

at least at this point in history we're living at a time

16

when a great many prior convictions are being considered

17

under three-strikes laws --

18

MR. DREEBEN:

19

QUESTION:

Correct.

-- let alone a Federal three-strikes

20

law which couldn't possibly have been in the contemplation

21

of the people who entered the guilty pleas or suffered the

22

convictions 25 years ago.

23

MR. DREEBEN:

No, but there has long been a

24

tradition in this country of recidivism laws that fairly

25

significantly escalated the potential sentence from some
35

1

of the cases that I've seen from 5 years to 35 years, and

2

these are convictions based on statutes that were enacted

3

long before the current wave of three-strikes statutes.

4

QUESTION:

Yes, but I thought what we're

5

concerned about are people who in 1972 -- something that

6

appeared fairly minor to the individual who is convicted,

7

he's told by somebody, go in and plead guilty, it's not

8

going to be a big deal.

9

He has no idea what he's doing.

He doesn't get

10

correct advice, and he goes in and he pleads guilty, and

11

he was totally confused at the State proceeding.

12

that person is going to be in jail for life because of a

13

later crime, although if you look at what happened it

14

would be obviously unconstitutional, his earlier

15

conviction.

16

Now,

Now, that's the case we're worried about, and we

17

get rid of the other cases through strict burden of proof

18

rules, so all we have in front of us are those cases, and

19

the question is, why shouldn't a person like that be able

20

to demonstrate the obvious fact that that earlier

21

conviction was obviously unconstitutional, and you give me

22

the answer that Custis says no, but then we could just

23

reply, well, that was because of the language of the

24

statute.

25

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think -36

1

QUESTION:

Here, although we're running around

2

Robin's barn or something in some weird procedural way,

3

better let him do it later than not at all.

4

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think the constitutional

5

holding in Custis had anything to do with the language of

6

the statutes.

7

Custis, which is the same statute at issue here, didn't

8

authorize these kinds of challenges at the sentencing

9

proceeding and it then went on to hold that neither did

10

The Court concluded that the statute in

the Constitution.

Now, petitioner's --

11

QUESTION:

At the sentencing proceeding.

12

MR. DREEBEN:

13

QUESTION:

Yes, but there's nothing --

But you could say, I guess -- and I

14

don't know how much of a stretch this would be.

15

say, but this person who is obviously convicted

16

unconstitutionally, and I'll underscore obviously, because

17

I can get rid of the nonobvious cases through strict

18

burdens of proof, all right, so he was obviously convicted

19

unconstitutionally, that that person should have some

20

forum somewhere in which to point that out before he's in

21

prison for life.

22

MR. DREEBEN:

You could

Justice Breyer, I accept that

23

you've attempted to carve out the category of obvious

24

unconstitutionality from what we're dealing with in this

25

realm, but I submit that as a matter of real-life
37

1

litigation it doesn't exist.

2

vast majority of cases are records just like this one.

3

The prisoner comes in --

4

QUESTION:

What you in fact get in the

The vast majority, fine, but we also

5

have a few cases where it was like somebody had robbed a

6

chicken coop, you know, when he was 18 years old, and now

7

12 years later this chicken coop has come back to put him

8

in prison for life, so there are also at least a few cases

9

where you think maybe he didn't get very good advice the

10
11

first time.
MR. DREEBEN:

Any constitutional rule that says

12

you can do this but only when it's really obvious is going

13

to lead to the same sorts of burdens of litigation of

14

whether it falls into that category or not, and it's going

15

to require the Government, when confronted with one of

16

these things, to do exactly what the Court recognized in

17

Custis was an extremely burdensome and usually

18

unproductive exercise of running round and trying to find

19

the prosecutor, the judge, the defense lawyer, the

20

probation officer who were part of the original sentencing

21

proceeding, which could go back decades, and attempting to

22

reconstruct --

23
24
25

QUESTION:

But that's the prisoner's problem.

The Government doesn't have to do that.
MR. DREEBEN:

No, it is the Government's
38

1

problem, because the prisoner comes in with an affidavit

2

that says, I was there, and I'm going to swear out as a

3

factual matter no one ever told me that aiding and

4

abetting liability required that I join in this venture as

5

if it were something that I intended to succeed.

6

thought is that if I was present and I knew about the bank

7

robbery, that was enough for the conviction.

All I

8

That is petitioner's claim right here.

He's

9

filed an affidavit, he's sworn it out under oath, and for

10

the Government to sit back and say to the sentencing

11

court, well, judge, he has a strong interest in this and

12

this was 20 years ago, you shouldn't believe him, is

13

really more than can be expected from us.

14

respond factually.

15

QUESTION:

We need to

Of course, you've got a case that has

16

facts that are very favorable to the Government generally,

17

but some of these cases are much closer, like the Seventh

18

Circuit case where the evidence was really quite

19

disturbing about whether the person actually received a

20

fair proceeding, but you would apply the same rule

21

regardless of how strong the proof is.

22

MR. DREEBEN:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

That's right, Justice Stevens.

And regardless of how serious the

violation is, unless it's a Gideon violation.
MR. DREEBEN:

That's right, and I think that
39

1

that is the line that the Court drew in Custis, and it

2

essentially says --

3

QUESTION:

4

Well, but Custis really was a holding

on the meaning of 924(e) on the sentencing proceedings.

5

MR. DREEBEN:

Custis was a holding first on the

6

meaning of 924(e) and then on what the Constitution

7

required of a sentencing judge, and it held a sentencing

8

judge may accept a facially valid --

9

QUESTION:

10
11

That's right.

MR. DREEBEN:

-- conviction that has never been

set aside, other than --

12

QUESTION:

And of course, one reason that's

13

permissible is that normally there's a second chance to

14

prove what really happened.

15

MR. DREEBEN:

16

QUESTION:

17

That's part of the answer --

Well --

-- given in that very case, that

they -- there is this other open question.

18

MR. DREEBEN:

There are normally other chances

19

for a defendant to attack his prior conviction, the direct

20

appeal from the conviction, post-conviction review in the

21

State, and post-conviction review federally.

22

QUESTION:

23

wasn't it?

24

Yes.

25

That was true in Custis itself,

He could have gone back to the State court?

MR. DREEBEN:

Correct.
40

1

QUESTION:

It said he could have gone to

2

Maryland or on 2254 review --

3

MR. DREEBEN:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. DREEBEN:

Correct.

-- of the Maryland conviction.
That's correct, and the Court

6

didn't say that this is an indispensable prerequisite of a

7

valid Federal sentence.

8

sentencing court can look at the State judgment and say,

9

on its face there's no Gideon problem here, we're not

10

What it said was, the Federal

required to entertain other constitutional challenges.

11

QUESTION:

Mr. --

12

MR. DREEBEN:

If some other court wants to

13

entertain them, that's to be presented to that court.

14

rendering court --

15

QUESTION:

The

Mr. Dreeben, I don't know why we

16

focus upon what the expectation of the defendant was at

17

the time he pleaded guilty, as opposed to what his

18

expectation was at the time he committed the later crime.

19

Do you think it would be unconstitutional for a State to

20

say that anyone who has a prior conviction on the record,

21

all right, that has been obtained in any manner so long as

22

Gideon has been complied with, anyone who has that on his

23

record who commits a later crime gets a longer sentence?

24
25

MR. DREEBEN:

No, I don't think that's

unconstitutional.
41

1

QUESTION:

He knows what the rules are when he

2

commits the later crime.

3

the former crime.

4

guilty to a former crime will get a longer sentence.

5

Isn't that the expectation that we should be concerned

6

about?

7

He knows he pleaded guilty of

He knows that anyone who has pleaded

MR. DREEBEN:

That is a, an expectation that the

8

prisoner can have that the laws give him notice that

9

that's what the laws are intended to do.

10

QUESTION:

But then it's your view, I take it,

11

that even if the prior conviction were set aside in State

12

proceedings or Federal proceedings, that that would not

13

justify a reduction in the Federal sentence?

14

MR. DREEBEN:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Stevens --

Is that your view?
It is a view that the Government

17

has taken in the lower courts.

18

circuits that have considered it.

19

rethinking what our position is on that issue.

20

is a quite distinct issue from this one.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. DREEBEN:

We have lost it in the six
We're currently
That issue

Correct.
Because in that situation the

23

Federal court, instead of saying, I have a facially valid

24

conviction in front of me and I have a defendant who says

25

there's something wrong with it but he's never done
42

1

anything about it, the Federal court in this latter class

2

of cases has a conviction that it previously relied on and

3

said, this is a reliable indication that you are a more

4

serious offender, and it turns out that a later State

5

court judgment may have set it aside on constitutional

6

grounds that fundamentally call into question reliability.

7

That's a distinguishable scenario from this situation, and

8

the outcome there does not control the outcome here.

9
10

QUESTION:

I agree, but apparently Justice

Scalia would not, is my point.

11

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think Justice Scalia is

12

referring to a statute that was premised on the following

13

theory.

14

and you are not deterred from the -- by committing another

15

crime, notwithstanding the fact that you know that your

16

sentenced will be enhanced, the question is, is that

17

constitutional apart from Gideon violations.

18

If you know you have a conviction on the books

My answer to that is yes, but I don't actually

19

think that's the sentencing theory that was adopted in

20

section 924(e).

21

QUESTION:

This is a statutory question, though,

22

and not a constitutional question, whether the statute was

23

of the sort that I --

24

MR. DREEBEN:

25

QUESTION:

Correct.

Correct.

That I described or not.
43

1

MR. DREEBEN:

Correct, and if it were of the

2

sort, I would submit that it's constitutional, but the

3

question is, is it of that sort.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. DREEBEN:

6

Right.
And I think the answer to it is

not.

7

QUESTION:

But if you say that it would be

8

constitutional if it were of that sort, then isn't it

9

a fortiori true that what the defendant is complaining

10

about here is likewise constitutional?

11

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think it's a fortiori,

12

Justice Scalia, although I do think our position is

13

a fortiori from Custis, and the reason I think they're

14

distinct is, the theory of the sentencing statute that you

15

have posited is deterrence, and the theory of the

16

recidivist sentencing statute, that is 924(e), and of most

17

recidivist statutes, is reliability of a prior conviction

18

which shows that this defendant is a more serious offender

19

because he has committed crimes in the past which

20

aggravate the current offense, and therefore this

21

individual warrants greater incapacitation as a matter of

22

protecting the public because he's clearly not learning

23

but is going on to commit offense after offense after

24

offense.

25

QUESTION:

I recognize what we said in Custis,
44

1

but is there any other structural or fundamental area,

2

other than Gideon, that we should recognize -- the judge

3

was bribed --

4

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, the United States took the

5

position in Custis that Gideon error belonged to a very

6

small class of fundamental errors, and the other error

7

that we identified in Custis was the error that you

8

identified, Justice Kennedy, of an error that really

9

deprives the sentencing court of the character of a court

10
11
12
13

that could render a fair judgment.
QUESTION:

But that's not subsumed in the

category of facially valid, is it?
MR. DREEBEN:

No, because this Court in Custis

14

didn't agree with the position of the Government and held

15

that Gideon violations are unique.

16

They are unique not only because they have such

17

a pervasive impact on the fairness of the proceeding, but

18

they are also unique in that they are fairly easy to

19

discern from the judgment role or from a motion

20

accompanying the judgment role, and the Court relied on

21

the consideration of administrative ease as well as of the

22

character of the error in defining what you could do when

23

confronted with a recidivist enhancement and a prior

24

conviction that is challenged on constitutional grounds,

25

and so long as the Court adheres to that line, I think
45

1

that the interest of the State in ensuring that its

2

judgment carries usual force and effect are just as strong

3

at the Federal sentencing proceeding as they are on 2255.

4

The State --

5

QUESTION:

But you're -- but you are leaving

6

open the possibility, say somebody in this position,

7

there's a quorum nobis proceeding in the State, gets it

8

knocked out under State law, you're saying that that's the

9

situation the Government is rethinking whether then, if

10

you succeed, even way out of time, to get it knocked out

11

at the State court, could you then come back to Federal

12

court on a 2255 and say, now the State has knocked this

13

out?

14

MR. DREEBEN:

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.

15

That's the question that we're revisiting after our

16

litigation track record in the lower courts, and it's not

17

presented in this case because petitioner did not do that,

18

and almost undoubtedly would be out of time to do that

19

today, and quorum nobis is not apparently available in

20

California, and our fundamental submission is, that was

21

the chance that he had.

22

Whatever procedures the rendering court provides

23

and post-conviction review provides of the underlying

24

conviction are sufficient for constitutional purposes

25

absent a Gideon error when the Federal sentencing court is
46

1

imposing a recidivist sentence.

If the Court has no further questions --

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF G. MICHAEL TANAKA

8

ON

BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. TANAKA:

I'd first like to address the

10

question of what Custis left open.

11

about the sentence at issue, and it ends, if -- we

12

recognize -- and this is at page 497 of the Custis

13

decision.

14

still in custody for purposes of State convictions, at the

15

time of this Federal sentencing under 924(e) may attack a

16

State sentence in Maryland or through a Federal habeas

17

review, and then, importantly, after that the citation is

18

just see Maleng v. Cook.

19

We've been talking

We recognize, however, that Custis, who is

Now, there are two things that suggest that what

20

that left open was the possibility of reviewing the prior

21

conviction as it enhanced the later sentence.

22

that it says, or through a Federal habeas review, and

23

second it says, it cites Maleng v. Cook.

24
25

First is

Now, what Maleng decided was that there was
subject-matter jurisdiction in a Federal habeas case where
47

1

there was an expired conviction, and the petitioner in

2

that case had attacked an expired conviction directly and

3

what this Court said was, no, you couldn't attack that

4

directly, but there was subject-matter jurisdiction on

5

habeas where that prior conviction was used to enhance a

6

subsequent sentence.

7

So that strongly suggests that the remedy that

8

this Court left open in Custis is akin to what exactly is

9

at issue here and that is, a 2255 remedy, by its very

10

terms, allows the petitioner to attack the

11

constitutionality of that prior State conviction, as it

12

was used to enhance his Federal sentence.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Maleng, though, was directed just to

whether or not he was in custody.
MR. TANAKA:

Right, whether he was in custody on

16

the subsequent sentence, but it suggests that they would

17

entertain attack on the prior conviction through the

18

custody of the subsequent sentence and conviction.

19

The other point I wanted to make is, the

20

Solicitor General mentioned that there was a fairness-

21

finality balance here, and that this changes where the

22

conviction, as in this case, is so old, but that fails to

23

recognize that the finality interests where the conviction

24

is used in a subsequent proceeding are not the same.

25

fact, they're not even close to the same, where we're
48

In

1

challenging the challenges to that State conviction

2

directly, and that is because this Court's jurisprudence

3

in many of those 2254 cases regarding finality posits the

4

rationale that the State judgment is a final one, and we

5

don't want to intrude in the State process.

6

don't want to release this person from custody.

7

want to make the State retry this man.

8

intrude in the State process.

9

That is, we
We don't

We don't want to

In this case, again, that interest is almost

10

nonexistent.

If a Federal sentencing court granted a

11

2255, there is no impact on that State court judgment.

12

So it really boils down to a question of, is

13

there a remedy for someone who is going to face a

14

potential life term --

15

QUESTION:

May I just question your last

16

conclusion?

Supposing he had not -- he was still in State

17

custody on parole or something of that kind, would not

18

then the Federal 2255 have an impact on the State's

19

interest in finality?

20

MR. TANAKA:

21

QUESTION:

I'm not sure it would -It seems hard to imagine the Federal

22

judge would conclude the State's conviction was invalid,

23

and therefore nothing would happen in the State

24

proceedings after that.

25

MR. TANAKA:

Well, certainly the Federal court
49

1

would have no conclusive effect on any subsequent State

2

court proceeding, and whatever persuasive value I imagine

3

that the State court could take it for what it was worth,

4

but I don't know that it would necessarily intrude on the

5

State court proceeding.

6

So basically what's at issue, then, is do we

7

allow 2255, which by its fine language provides a remedy

8

where the sentence is unconstitutional, do we close that

9

door on the basis of considerations that aren't at issue

10

in this case, or do we allow someone who's facing a life

11

sentence to litigate the validity, and in some cases it's

12

going to be obvious, of prior convictions that don't

13

reliably indicate his guilt and, as the Solicitor General

14

said, the whole purpose between the armed career criminal

15

act is incapacitation, or --

16

QUESTION:

Of course, in this case, Mr. Tanaka,

17

it's a guilty plea, so you don't have any real question of

18

whether there's a record to show that he did it or didn't

19

do it, because you don't get that sort of a record with a

20

guilty plea.

21

MR. TANAKA:

That's correct, Your Honor, and so

22

the issue then would be, does this record reliably reflect

23

his guilt, reviewing the record that's presented on the

24

guilty plea, and that would be an issue for the Federal

25

district court to decide on remand.
50

1

If it decided that indeed there's enough

2

evidence here that we have no question that he was guilty

3

and there's a reliable indication of that, then I suppose

4

he's out of court, but the point is, he needs to have that

5

opportunity.

6

QUESTION:

But it's very difficult, as pointed

7

out in the briefs, when you're dealing with convictions

8

that are 16 and 19 years old, to go back and show exactly

9

what happened at a guilty plea.

10

MR. TANAKA:

I'll grant that, but again I think

11

that that concern is addressed by placing the burden of

12

proof on the petitioner, which -- where it lies, and if

13

the sentencing court doesn't find that persuasive, then --

14

QUESTION:

Well, but as Mr. Dreeben pointed out,

15

your client can simply file an affidavit saying that, you

16

know, I wasn't fully advised of what was going on, and

17

then it's up to the Government to come back.

18

difficult for someone who is facing that kind of an

19

affidavit to simply say, well, disbelieve this guy.

20

want to collect information showing that he should be

21

disbelieved.

22
23

MR. TANAKA:

QUESTION:

You

And to the extent that's possible

I'm sure the Government will do that.

24
25

It's very

Yes, with great administrative

burden.
51

1

MR. TANAKA:

Well, the fact is there just aren't

2

that many of these cases, but that's a price that we need

3

to pay in order to make sure that people aren't

4

unjustly --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Well, but there comes

6

a point when the Government should be entitled to say,

7

this is the way the cookie crumbles.

8

this, and you're stuck with it.

9

Thank you.

You bought into
