ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. TRIBE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:

11

The parties on both courts below agree on at

12

least two things, first, that section 201(c) represents a

13

compromise that assures freelance authors that they may

14

control and exploit their individual contributions to

15

collective works like newspapers and magazines in new

16

anthologies and serializations and screenplays and other

17

derivative works unless they've expressly transferred that

18

right.

19

The parties are also agreed as are both courts

20

below that 201(c) assures the publication of collective

21

works that the publisher of such collective works has the

22

aggregate right to publish any article in the collective

23

work both in publishing the collective work itself of

24

course, but also in publishing that article, quote, as

25

part of any revision of that collective work, again unless

1

there has been an express transfer of the right.

2

Now the principal impetus for this measure was a

3

rather strong wish to undo several quite notorious rulings

4

like that of the Southern District of New York in the

5

Geisel case in 1968 which of course involved the legendary

6

Dr. Seuss and denied him the right to stop the

7

unauthorized distribution of toy dolls that were derived

8

from cartoons that he had published decades earlier.

9

There is no hint at all in the history of this

10

measure and I think no hint in the way it's written that

11

microfilm, for example, which had been in use for some 40

12

years at the time this measure was passed and which people

13

used to make copies of individual articles more often than

14

to make copies of entire cumbersome periodicals was seen

15

by anyone as a problem to be addressed or solved by

16

201(c).

17
18

QUESTION:

When you say people used to make

copies you mean the ultimate user?

19

MR. TRIBE:

20

QUESTION:

The ultimate end user.
Yes, but the person who produced the

21

microfilm or the microfiche produced the entire work.

22

produced the article as part of the entire work, not to be

23

shown.

certain graphics that cannot be handled by ASCII is put

QUESTION:

When you would look at a newspaper on

5

microfilm you would get the whole page. You would probably

6

want to single out a particular article but it was the

7

whole page that appeared to you.

8

MR. TRIBE:

That's right and in this case you

9

basically conduct a search under the algorithms that are

10

used by Nexis, conduct a search of the entire periodical

11

whether you call for a particular topic --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. TRIBE:

But it's not all in one piece, is it.
Well it's in virtual -- it's in --

14

it's certainly not -- it's not a newspaper that we're used

15

to.

MR. TRIBE:

At any one time, but with a very

simple prompt of about 15 characters you can get the

Now, I assume that the publisher can

subsequent use in database material and --

MR. TRIBE:

QUESTION:

10

Yes, and for decades -Probably the publisher does that

today --

11

MR. TRIBE:

Sometimes.

What's happened, Justice

12

O'Connor, it appears that for at least 20 years people

13

have assumed because no one complained of this practice

14

that the standard contract was not limited to the print

15

medium.

16

made clear they would not make contracts with people for

17

print only.

18

Now as of 1995, for example, the New York times

QUESTION:

I notice, though, that the head of

19

the copyright division has at least written a letter that

20

looks like she thinks the court below was absolutely

21

right.

22

MR. TRIBE:

That's right.

On the basis of a

23

display argument that is disclaimed by the Tasini

24

respondents that wasn't made below and that doesn't make

25

sense under the statute, because quite clearly if we are

involved in reproduction and distribution display is

2

covered in the intersection of those.

3

It's not, I think, a serious argument. You

4

notice the solicitor general did not decide to come into

5

this case.

But you're right about the register of

6

copyright.

However that --

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Tribe, does that view of the

8

register of copyright relate at all to one effort that was

9

made in the 76 act and to give the independent artisan,

10

the artist, the author more muscle vis-a-vis the publisher

11

or the patron than before?

12

MR. TRIBE:

It's an interesting theory, Justice

13

Ginsberg, but I've tried to imagine how by carving this

14

pie into two pieces one could give the older, the other,

15

more muscle.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. TRIBE:

One could pay that's -Well, in 1995, I was saying a minute

18

ago, the New York Times said we're not going to run

19

articles print only.

20

when almost everything has to go onto the Internet or be

21

preserved in some other way other than print and they said

22

that our contract will automatically cover print and

23

electronic rights.

24

royalties didn't change a cent after that.

25

It would be kind of pointless now

And what's interesting is that the

I think it's a kind of belief in magic that

1

leads some people to think that if there's an inequity of

2

bargaining power it will be solved by creating two estates

3

rather than one.

4

interesting that the respondents went to Congress, the

5

National Writers Union went to Congress and tried to get a

6

measure much more modest than this one, a measure that

7

would say that when there is a demonstrable inequity in

8

bargaining power, an unconscionable arrangement, and when

9

that's shown by individualized proof there could be a

10

In fact, in the mid 1980s it's

transfer of rights.

11

Here they want a wholesale, global transfer

12

which I don't think is necessarily going to change

13

anything for the future but could have very serious impact

14

on existing writings whose authors and heirs and assigns

15

are going to be extremely difficult to locate.

So far as the future is concerned,

That's right and all I'm saying is

there is not any particular reason to think the deals will

come out very differently.

They're expending a fair amount of money.

1

they think quite rightly that they can get a lot of money

2

to settle a case in which, if we were to lose, we and many

3

other publishers around the country would have no choice

4

but to engage in defensive deletions of a lot of material

that could otherwise expose us to massive statutory

damages under the copyright laws.

Even the

Well, for one thing, this is a three

year statute of limitations which will --

18

MR. TRIBE:

I don't know that that will help a

19

lot, Justice Ginsburg and the reason is that keeping

20

something on Nexis or in CD-ROMs that you have in

21

circulation after it has been determined to be infringing

22

and letting people potentially have access to it, which

23

the download might be an infringement, would be a new act.

24

So I don't think the statute of limitations will solve the

25

problem.

1

QUESTION:

It's hard for me to see that that's

2

going to be the effect in the real world because after all

3

these authors have an interest in exposure, it's just like

4

a lot of people now no longer have to be artists for hire

5

are that anyway, because they will give the copyright to

6

the patron, they want people to get to know who they are.

7

MR. TRIBE:

I think that's the irony, Justice

8

Ginsberg.

I think the erasures of a lot of these things

9

will not be in the interest of the people whose work may

10

be erased but someone who wrote an article in 1980 and

11

maybe was 60 years old at the time and maybe isn't around

12

at the moment, there are a lot of people like that.

13

don't know how many. We don't know how many articles, but

14

the U.S. News and World Report has already decided in

15

anticipation because there's no -- they think no analytic

16

difference between microfilm and some of these products,

17

certainly the GPO CD-ROM which is a photographic copy is

18

not different, they've stopped putting their work on

microfilm.

The line drawing problem here, if I may say, is

one of several reasons why recalibrating the balance that

Congress struck is a particularly inappropriate job for

the Court.

on the systems already, that certainly need not be done by

2

court decree.

3

MR. TRIBE:

4

QUESTION:

No, certainly.
A court can say, you know, taking

5

equity into account we're not going to issue such an

6

injunction so the question would be your clients would be

7

compelled to erase all of this stuff because of the

8

damages they would have to pay.

10

MR. TRIBE:

11

QUESTION:

12

What would the damages be

Well under -If it was worthless, the damages

would be negligeable.

MR. TRIBE:

You would think that, but under 504

the theory of that would I suppose be that they don't need

a theory because the statute says it, but the theory would

20

be that all of the work we put in electronic form would

21

not have been worth anything if it looked like Swiss

even, if not, it could be --

QUESTION:

5

It would be more

The statutory violation applies only

to willful violations.

6

MR. TRIBE:

No, it's more if it's willful. But

7

there is a statutory provision in any event and it would

8

become willful.

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. TRIBE:

What's the nonwillful amount?
I think it's a sliding scale,

11

Justice Scalia, and I think there is discretion to set it.

12

And it can be very low, I think as low as $250 and as high

13

as over 10,000, but I have to say I don't remember for

14

sure.

15

But the point is there are something like

16

100,000 freelance articles just on Nexis.

There are

17

18,000 journals on Nexis.

Ginsberg.

You mentioned the statute of limitations, Justice

5

It seems to me that of course that is not a

6

reason to read the statute incorrectly but I think --

7

QUESTION:

I think if we go back to that for

8

just one second, because I'd like to go about to where

9

Justice O'Connor, I think, started.

The part that I'm

10

having difficulty understanding and I don't actually

11

understand this is what precisely, precisely say in the

12

case of Nexis was the event that you think the other side

13

is saying changed the work from a revised work to a new

14

work.

15

morning on May 11th, 2001, the Washington Post has a piece

16

of paper, it's called the Washington Post.

17

analogous form that piece of paper is in its computer.

18

And then something happens.

19

of that information over to Nexis and what, I'd like you

20

to focus right on that, because what you -- I want to know

21

what event in that series of events on that morning we're

22

talking about as being the copying, the unlawful copying.

In particular I'm thinking, say, at ten in the

So I could look to the opinion of the

technically turn on whether the transmission to Nexis is

9

the transmission at one instant of time of the electronic

10

analog, and I chose the Post purposely because it's not

11

involved in some other aspects of the case, the -- it

12

might turn on whether that whole electronic analog of the

13

entire paper is transmitted instantly at one instance over

14

to Nexis where later on they use electronic scissors and

15

cut it up or whether article by article at different times

16

it's transmitted so that there is no cutting up.

MR. TRIBE:

There's not a shred of evidence, not

a whisper that suggest that they're first disassembling

MR. TRIBE:

I understand Justice Souter but it

is undisputed that the way they do it, it's more

efficient, is that they will take the intersection of all

satisfy the concern you're expressing.

9

If it were the case that the only way you

But if that was the only way you could do it,

10

the statute would be incoherent because it says that you

may reproduce and distribute the contribution as part of a

revision or you may distribute the revision itself or a

13

later element in the series, and if it were the case that

you have to get the whole thing, then we would have erased

from the statute the key compromised words --

I will accept that but it may then

simply be that the price of coherence, as you put it, is a

limitation on the right of the periodical or of the

the author.

then I would suppose that's what Congress necessarily has

provided.

3

MR. TRIBE:

But Justice Souter, to say that it

reads that protection out of the statute is hard to square

5

with the fact that these authors in undisputed testimony

themselves said that when they tried to syndicate their

work or serialize it or sell it in some way there was

8

never any evidence that its appearance in this archival

context on Nexis or the CD-ROMs ever made the slightest

difference.

11

the argument is that we should be able since Congress said

so to reproduce and distribute not just a revision of the

composite work, but the article as part of that revision,

1

I'd like to begin by addressing the part of the

2

discussion that just concluded, Section 201(c) and its

3

cognate Sections 103 and the definition sections as has

4

been discussed distinguished between the author's

5

copyright in his individual contributed work, which he

6

retains when he contributes it to a collective work, and

7

the collective work copyright owners, this language

8

couldn't be more cumbersome, mainly the publishers'

9

copyright in the collective work as a whole.

The statute

10

couldn't be clearer, we believe, in the proposition that

11

the collective works copyright owner has no copyright in

12

the individual article in these free-lance situations

13

where there is the separate author copyright.

14

It seems to us that the clearest lesson from

15

that is that if the publisher were in print terms to

16

publish reprints of individual articles and treat them

17

separately that would be an infringing action, the

18

publisher would be exploiting the article as an article

19

and without any authorization.

Suppose that the Times published

QUESTION:

It also could be a later collective

work in the same series.

3

MR. GOLD:

The question here, though, at least

4

there is an argument that that's a revision and not an

5

exploitation of the copyrighted author's article as an

6

article, but my point, my beginning point is that as I

7

understand Mr. Tribe's argument, if the Times were to

8

publish an article as an article, saying this was part of

9

the New York Times and offer it on the market, make copies

10

and offer it to anyone who wants to buy it, that that

11

would be part of the publisher's 201(c) right.

12

At that point there's nothing, on that theory,

13

there is nothing left of the fact that the author is the

14

copyright holder in the article.

15

starting point, that the one thing that is plain is that

16

the collective work copyright holder cannot exploit the

17

article as an article, as a separate freestanding work.

articles on an article by article basis.

it make a difference whether the Times sends it in an

disaggregation and access to disaggregated materials.

MR. GOLD:

My only point in making -- in stating

20

that the form of the transmission, namely in article

QUESTION:

I understand that, but why, since the

that in fact is what it called for in its contract with

Mr. Gold, if you've had a chance to

Has a very elaborate index system and

it's part of a huge library.

MR. GOLD:

Yeah.

is if the library is part and parcel of copying individual

articles, that's a copyright infringement.

There are elaborate

So just to be sure I understand, the

are raising?

Is it not the same in the electronic

Because it is a reproduction of the
