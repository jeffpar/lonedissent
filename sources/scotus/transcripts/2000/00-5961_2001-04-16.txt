CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Larson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HERBERT V. LARSON, JR.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. LARSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In June 1993 when this Court handed down its

11

decision in Sullivan v. Louisiana, it did something it had

12

done in only five other instances which spanned the

13

preceding seventy-six years -- it characterized an error

14

as structural.

15

The holding of the Sullivan decision, which

16

reaffirmed and explained this Court's decision in Cage, is

17

what makes Melvin Tyler's conviction unconstitutional, but

18

it is the Court's rationale underlying the Sullivan

19

decision that makes Sullivan retroactively available to

20

Melvin Tyler, and that is because the rationale underlying

21

Sullivan also satisfies the second exception to Teague's

22

policy of nonretroactivity to cases on collateral review.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. LARSON:

25

How about EDPA?
EDPA.

The statutory argument is,

Your Honor, that EDPA in this case would be purely

1

theoretical if this Court finds that Mr. Tyler's case

2

satisfies the second Teague exception.

3

it did so, it could then make Cage retroactive.

4

it made Cage retroactive, he would then satisfy the

5

statutory language to EDPA.

6

Having found that
And had

I want to make clear at the outset that we are

7

not contending that all structural errors fall within

8

Teague's second exception; we are simply saying that this

9

one does, and it does so because the new rule first

10

announced in Cage requires the observance of a procedure

11

that is implicit --

QUESTION:

13

moment, Mr. Larson.

14

show the claim relies on a new rule of constitutionality

15

made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the

16

Supreme Court.

17

some other court can say it has been made retroactive by

18

our Court, or that we ourselves must have said it is

19

retroactive?

20

Just getting back to EDPA for a
That says that an applicant has to

Now, do we interpret that as meaning that

MR. LARSON:

You yourselves must have said that

21

it is retroactive in a successive petition.

22

-- when I say must have said, this Court must have done

23

something to communicate that the new rule is retroactive.

QUESTION:

Well, when -- first you said said,

and then must have done something to communicate.

Is that

a broader standard than just said?

2

MR. LARSON:

Well, made is the word I'm looking

3

for, Your Honor.

This Court must have done something that

4

made the new rule retroactive.

QUESTION:

But, you know, one obvious choice in

this language is to say, yes, the Supreme Court has held

that this rule is retroactive.

MR. LARSON:

Now, does your use of the

QUESTION:

11

MR. LARSON:

Yes, it does, Your Honor.
How would you define made?
That it would be clear that the

12

unmistakable import of an action taken by this Court would

13

be that the new rule that had been announced was to be

14

applied retroactively.

15
16

QUESTION:

But this Court need not have said so

in haec verba, so to speak, in so many words.

17

MR. LARSON:

18

need not have said so expressly.

19

point, we are not contending that this applies -- that all

20

structural errors fall within Teague's second exception.

21

It is simply that this Court made very, very clear in

22

Sullivan that that particular structural error was based

23

on the two matters that were central in Fulminante v.

24

Arizona.

25

QUESTION:

Precisely, Your Honor.

unmistakable import, to use your words, of the Court's

2

opinion, earlier opinion in Cage, that it was meant to be

retroactive.

MR. LARSON:

No, I would say that it was the

Q

MR. LARSON:

9

QUESTION:

In Sullivan.

-- that Cage was meant to be

applied retroactively, and that unmistakable import was

10

received by seven circuit courts of appeal that have

11

applied Cage retroactively since Sullivan.

12

court that has considered the new rule in Cage since this

13

Court's holding in Sullivan has said that Sullivan compels

14

the application of Cage on a retroactive basis.

15

Every lower

The respondent in this case and amici have

16

advanced two principal arguments for denying Melvin Tyler

17

relief in this case.

18

EDPA which requires that a matter relies on a new rule of

19

constitutional law made retroactive to cases on collateral

20

review by the Supreme Court that was previously

21

unavailable, and then finally this Court's holding in

22

Teague v. Lane that new rules of constitutional law cannot

23

be applied retroactively to cases on collateral review

24

unless they fall within one of two, as the Court has

25

described, narrow exceptions.

The first would be the language of

1

As I said in response to Chief Justice's

2

question, from our perspective now that we are before the

3

Court, the first obstacle is purely theoretical.

4

Court should decide that Teague requires that the new rule

5

announced in Cage as explained by Sullivan should be

6

applied retroactively, and it simply says in this case,

7

which it has the power to do, and as all -- as amici has

8

conceded, that it's made retroactive and applies it to Mr.

9

Tyler's case, and that resolves the issue.

If this

10

Obviously, not every case that turns on the

11

meaning of 2244(b)(2)(A) is going to be heard by this

12

Court, so if the Court decides that it should address the

13

statutory question now, we would submit that the better

14

interpretation is the one that has been offered by the

15

Third and the Ninth Circuits in the two cases of West v.

16

Vaughn and Flowers v. Walter -- that the phrase made

17

retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme

18

Court does not require the express ruling of this Court.

19

We are not saying, as the Ninth Circuit has said

20

in Flowers v. Walter, that all cases that should be

21

retroactive under Teague are, in fact, retroactive.

22

are simply saying that the word made in this case should

23

be given its simple plain meaning of caused to be the

24

case.

meeting is to say, made retroactive would be that this

that were to be the case, it creates an entire host of

problems.

language such as held by, determined to be retroactive by

the Court had made that new rule retroactive, whereas a

second petitioner identically situated for Teague purposes

would not receive the benefit of the rule.

16

You would have a first petitioner who

The second is that this interpretation of made

17

retroactive is the only one that works with the statute of

18

limitations that EDPA has created.

19

interpret the rule as requiring an express ruling from

20

this Court that something has been made retroactive, when

21

the statute of limitations begins to run when the new rule

22

has been recognized, as we pointed out in our briefs, you

23

could have a statute of limitations expiring before this

Court ever ruled on whether something had been made

retroactive.

position of the Solicitor General that maybe the statute

recognizes the retroactivity for successive petitions, the

QUESTION:

So you

On the other hand there is a thirty-

7

day requirement in the court of appeals to determine

8

whether or not to decide the issue, and that indicates, it

9

seems to me, that the only thing they can do is look to

10

see whether this Court has decided it.

11

they have to decide a difficult substantive issue within

12

thirty days.

13

consistent with the statutory scheme.

14

Because otherwise

It does not seem to me that that is

MR. LARSON:

Well, but that's precisely the type

15

of decision that lower courts make every day in terms of

16

first petitions, as was done in this case.

17

Circuit had determined that Sullivan had been made

18

retroactive -- Cage had been made retroactive by Sullivan,

19

and it applied it to all first petitioners.

20

think, Your Honor, that we're placing an additional burden

21

on the lower court because, quite candidly, we are only

22

talking about a very, very, very small category of new

23

rules that would have been made retroactive.

Teague was handed down, none have been found to qualify

for the second Teague exception.

the first new rule under the second Teague exception.

4

to respond more fully to your question, Your Honor, I do

5

not think we are placing an undue burden on the lower

6

courts, because Your Honors' interpretation of requiring

7

an express ruling from this Court would mean that a

8

successive habeas petitioner under a new rule was either

9

too early or too late, but never on time.

QUESTION:

In fact, this would be
So

How many jury instructions do you

suppose have been given out there in the past on

reasonable doubt that would fall within Cage?

think there might be a great many and going back a great

many years, wouldn't you?

MR. LARSON:

I would

The -- my understanding is, Justice

16

O'Connor, is that this instruction was the standard bench

As to the number of --

many cases indicated, that would meet the requirements of

2

Cage that have all three of the elements that Cage had

3

that would be condemned.

4

this Court's decision in Victor, which followed after

5

Sullivan, in which it said, no, these type of instructions

6

that Cage is where we draw the line, Victor is simply not,

7

does not form part of that --

8

QUESTION:

9

And the best example would be

Yes, but presumably the Orleans

Parish bench book instructions came from somewhere.

You

10

know, I think reasonable doubt instructions probably were

11

quite frequent all around -- they had to be in any

12

criminal case, and I think it is probably not terribly

13

accurate to assume that in no other place than Orleans

14

Parish was this sort of an instruction given.

15

MR. LARSON:

Your Honor, in all the reading I

16

have done everywhere, I have never seen an instruction as

17

bad as the Cage instruction from any other jurisdiction.

18

This -- and in fact the instruction that was given in

19

Melvin Tyler's case is worse than the one that was given

20

in Cage.

21

QUESTION:

The -- is this -- we tried to look

22

this up, and I'll tell you what I found and see if it

23

corresponds -- either of you -- that there were six or

24

seven states right after Cage that had similar

25

instructions, then the Court decided Victor v. Nebraska,

and that seemed to suggest that all but in one or two,

2

maybe the Louisiana and New York, that the instructions

3

were okay.

this ground, and some in Louisiana, and no others.

mean, that's just a quick check, so it would be in New

We found twenty-one reversals in New York on

I mean, you

My understanding is that very, very

few states gave this type of instructions.

The ones that

were giving it certainly corrected it after Cage, and the

number of people that would ultimately be affected by a

12

finding that Sullivan compels the retroactivity of Cage

would be fifty to sixty people would be --

Cage is the new rule, Your Honor.

rule that we have announced in a per curiam, unargued

opinion?

No, Your Honor.
Wasn't Cage just an application of

Winship?

11

MR. LARSON:

QUESTION:

13

that Cage was more than that.

Winship was the case that may have led to Cage.

I would have thought

Winship was the principal.

QUESTION:

Winship did not address jury

is structural that represented truly the paradigm shift.

2

That's why it becomes the watershed rule.

3

Sullivan tells you for the first time and makes it

4

clear that a reasonable doubt jury instruction, unlike any

5

other jury instruction that you can give at a trial, if it

6

is flawed, flaws the entire process.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. LARSON:

9

Is it Sullivan that's the watershed?
Well, Cage is the new rule, Your

Honor, and it is Sullivan's explanation of Cage --

QUESTION:

11

MR. LARSON:

12

QUESTION:

But is --- is the watershed.
If per curium Cage is just following

13

Winship, isn't it a little hard to say that it's the new

14

rule.

15

MR. LARSON:

Cage has been recognized as the new

16

rule because for the first time -- Winship did not address

17

jury instructions, Your Honor, Cage did.

18

time, the new rule becomes that when a court gives a

19

reasonable doubt jury instruction that misdefines

20

reasonable doubt, and in effect lowers the state's burden

21

of proof, you have violated the due process rule.

22

QUESTION:

For the first

I am quite surprised that you say

23

that Cage is not the watershed rule. I think that really

has to be your -- this would have been very odd for us to

It seems

Well, as explained by Sullivan -A watershed rule is like Gideon v.

Wainwright, I take it?
MR. LARSON:

Is that a paradigm?
It is a shift in the paradigm, is

12

the best way to explain it.

To use an analogy, I would

say that Gideon would be the continental divide, and Cage

would be the watershed.

What you really have is a watershed --

Yes.
I'm tempted to say I know Gideon, and

Cage is no Gideon.
MR. LARSON:

Cage is no Gideon -- I will admit

23

that Cage is no Gideon, but it is still watershed because

24

it has changed our thinking about the centrality of the

reasonable doubt instruction.

MR. LARSON:

watershed about it is that when you have had a reasonable

And my question is, did Sullivan --

is it the Sullivan holding that made Cage retroactive, or
statements in Sullivan that made it?

MR. LARSON:

13

Statements in Sullivan, Your Honor.
So it's dicta rather than the

holding.

14

MR. LARSON:

No, Your Honor, it's not dicta.

15

It's the rationale, and the rationale was precisely

16

following Arizona v. Fulminante.

17

Fulminante defined structural error, it had two

18

components.

19

error deprives a defendant of a basic protection or right.

20

And the second component is that that protection or right

21

is one without which the criminal trial cannot reliably

22

serve its purpose as a vehicle for determining guilt or

23

innocence.

24
25

That as Arizona v.

The first component was that a structural

You say, well, this is a

How do we tell?

MR. LARSON:

You draw the line by looking to the

8

two Teague factors, Your Honor, and those two Teague

9

factors are that we have to be dealing with a rule that

10

requires the observance of a procedure that is implicit in

11

the concept of ordered liberty, which Sullivan tells us we

12

unquestionably are.

14

We are dealing with the Sixth

And then there is the second problem of the

15

Teague analysis, which is the reliability factor.

16

because of Cage and Sullivan, we know that when you have

17

an erroneous reasonable doubt instruction such as the one

18

in Cage, Sullivan and Tyler, that you have -- that the

19

likelihood of an accurate conviction has been serious

20

diminished.

21

QUESTION:

And

Well, except that that's not the way

22

we explained it in Sullivan -- what was at stake.

24

understand it, and as you quoted from it a moment ago.

with what we normally mean by the reliability of a

Did he do it, did he not do it?

8

It had nothing to do, as I understand it,

So it seems to me that the two don't synchronize
the way you're arguing.

9

MR. LARSON:

They do, Your Honor, if you go more

10

into the structure.

The reason you have been deprived of

11

a jury verdict within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.

12

For that you have to go all the way back to In re:

13

Winship.

14

that there is only one measure of reliability within a

15

criminal trial, and that is the proof beyond a reasonable

16

doubt standard.

17

proof to higher levels, the likelihood of an improper or

18

erroneous conviction is lessened, and that if you require

19

proof beyond all doubt, you would have -- certainly you

20

would not have any innocent people hopefully convicted.

21

And so what Winship tells you is that it is that proof

22

beyond a reasonable doubt standard that, quote, from

23

Winship, plays a vital role in the American scheme of

24

criminal procedure, because it is the prime instrument for

25

reducing the risk of convictions resting on factual error.

QUESTION:

If that's the argument, then why

2

isn't the structural nature of this error essentially

3

irrelevant to your analysis?

4

MR. LARSON:

It is -- what I am saying is that

5

the Court has -- it is not irrelevant, because the Court

6

has already made those findings as to what a Cage or

7

Sullivan-type jury instruction means.

8

QUESTION:

Well, the Court -- the Court has said

it's structural, but in your answer to my question, you're

10

saying the reason this structural error is, in fact, a

11

structural error which must be made retroactive is a

12

product of Teague.

Why don't we simply go to Teague?

13

MR. LARSON:

14

QUESTION:

We can, and -Okay.

If we go to Teague then,

15

what's left of the significance of Sullivan?

significant, as I understand it, only because Sullivan

17

indicated that the first case was structural, and yet you

say you concede that the structural nature of it is not

dispositive.

then how can we tell from Sullivan that, in fact, Cage

21

must be retroactive?

22

Sullivan is

If the structural nature is not dispositive,

MR. LARSON:

We can't.
What you can tell from Sullivan is

that the Court has, in essence, found that these two

components of the original structural error test in

MR. LARSON:

I'm simply saying that the Court, having made that

type of findings and having set forth that rationale for a

finding of structural error in that case -- because there

There are two questions presented here.

The

If I may, I would like to begin with the second question

presented.

QUESTION:

I think

Before you get started, may I just

ask, do you agree that Cage was a new rule?
MR. HEUER:

Yes, Your Honor.

Teague gives us an

20

example of a watershed rule in Gideon and provides a

21

definition that a watershed rule is a rule which alters

necessary for a fair trial.

please the Court:

2

Petitioner may not base his petition in this

case on Cage, because the rule of that case has not been

5

QUESTION:

In answer to the question Justice

6

Breyer asked your colleague, where primary conduct is held

7

to be not punishable as a matter of law, is that also

subject to the same retroactivity principles we're talking

9

about, or is there a different rule?

If the first rule of

Teague is involved, i.e., conduct which cannot be

11

punishable?

12

MR. FELDMAN:

I don't think there is.

I think

13

the fairest reading of the statute is that it has to be

14

made

-- the specific rule relied upon by the second petitioner

16

has to be made retroactive by the Supreme Court, not by

QUESTION:

Which case?

MR. FELDMAN:

The Eichmann case, the flag-

3

burning case, in which -- you could distinguish some cases

4

under the first Teague exception in which the application

5

of that exception is just absolutely crystal clear, but I

6

don't think all first exception cases are even close to

7

that, and I don't think that any second exception cases

8

would be like that.

9

absolutely clear first Teague exception case could satisfy

10

the made retroactive standard, I actually think the better

11

rule is want Congress provide, which is that it be this

Court and not some other court that's vested with the

responsibility of finally and conclusively deciding that

the certain new rule is valid, and it should be made

So although you could say an

unmistakable import isn't good enough, you have to say it

MR. FELDMAN:

I think so.

Yes, I think that

14

that's what Congress provided, and I think they provided

15

it for a good reason.

16

Kennedy, if the Court wanted to distinguish unmistakable

17

import cases, I would think those would only arise under

the first Teague exception, and I also think that not all

even close.

QUESTION:

But in any case you wouldn't be

2

satisfied with dicta from a case on direct review, or a

3

statement from a case on direct review?

4

MR. FELDMAN:

No, I -- I just don't think that

5

we can fairly say that it's this Court that's made the

6

specific new rule that the habeas petitioner is relying

7

on, that it's this Court that's made it retroactive when

8

it's just a statement in an opinion which the lower courts

9

have to pay attention to, but those statements don't

10

themselves have legal force and effect like the holding of

11

a case or perhaps a statement that was necessary to the

12

reasoning and therefore not dicta.

13

QUESTION:

Then you'll run into a statute of

14

limitations problem, because the statute of limitations

15

seems to say that it has to -- you have a year after the

16

right of cert was initially recognized by the Supreme

17

Court, and so you're going to have to do within the year

-- it's going to have to come up on habeas to the Supreme

19

Court in an instance, let's say, where it's absolutely

20

clear from the reasoning that it is meant to apply

retroactively, so you'll never -- I mean, it'll put this

Court in an impossible situation, wouldn't it?

provision of it, by any lower court, and the meaning of

2

whether it would run from the date of the original

3

decision or the date that this Court had made the decision

4

5

think it would necessarily be a problem.

6

think that Congress intended that the gateway for second

and successive habeas petitioners should be extremely

narrow, and they assigned, Congress assigned, the courts

of appeals the responsibility within a thirty-day period

MR. FELDMAN:

2

QUESTION:

That's correct.

So if the decision was not

have said, no, we should reverse them on that, and we

should reach no other issue.

issue, we're in dictum.

7

MR. FELDMAN:

And if we reach another

I don't think that that's correct,

8

because it's true that that's what they should have done,

9

but the consequences of them not doing that are that there

10

are two questions that are presented to this Court in this

could just reach a --

point of the rule in Teague was that good faith reasonable
