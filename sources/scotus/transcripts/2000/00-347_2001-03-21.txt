MR. DODYK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

Let me start by suggesting that whether my

client Wharf Holdings misrepresented its intention to sell

MR. DODYK:

In part that is true, Your Honor,

MR. DODYK:

QUESTION:

Not solely.

I think there are

But first about what the security is.
Yes, Your Honor.
And what the Respondents say, and

8

what the court below believed is that the security here

9

was an option.

10
11

And the definition of security in the Act

includes an option to purchase securities.
MR. DODYK:

That is correct.

That is correct,

12

Your Honor.

13

that the oral expression which passes or is asserted to be

14

a security in this case should not be accepted as such,

15

that in this case that what you're basically dealing with

16

is a conversation which gave rise to an asserted right to

17

purchase common stock in a subsidiary.

18

as I understand the law, Your Honor, is rooted in the Blue

19

Chip Stamps case.

20

Honor, I believe it to reflect a reluctance on the part of

21

the Court to accept oral assertions as satisfying the

22

predicate to establish standing to sue as a purchaser of

23

securities.

24

3

Are you saying that that goes for the

MR. DODYK:

Well, certainly Your Honor, I'm not

4

saying then oral statement cannot constitute a

5

misrepresentation.

6

Going to the second part of your question, Your Honor, I

7

certainly think that distinctions can be made between the

8

breadth of section 10(b) in the hands of the SEC and the

9

breadth of the judicially-implied private right of action

10

under Section 10(b).

11

are distinctions.

Far be it from me to suggest that.

12

And as Your Honor is aware, there

In an SEC action, it is of no concern whether

13

anyone relied on misrepresentation.

In fact, there is no

14

purchaser requirement constraining the SEC's enforcement

bar.

16

action which is implied under Section 10(b) are quite

17

different from the contours within which the SEC might

18

bring an enforcement action.

19

QUESTION:

So I think the contours of the private right of

Are you saying, Mr. Dodyk, that there

20

can't be any oral options as a matter of Federal

21

securities law?

22

MR. DODYK:

Your Honor, I think as a matter of

Federal securities law, as I read the Blue Chips Stamps

case, that a conversation which a person asserts via an

25

oral option should not, under the doctrine of that case,

be accepted as a security.

2

QUESTION:

Well, that would certainly take it

3

beyond the holding of the case.

4

MR. DODYK:

There is no question about that.

5

The holding of the case itself was limited to a situation

6

in which the offerees in that situation did not purchase

7

the stock.

8

given what I understand to be -- and of course Your Honor

9

would know better than I -- the thrust of that opinion.

But what I say to Your Honor is I don't think

10

The reluctance of the Court to accept wholly oral

11

testimony not for the purpose of saying whether or not

12

there has been a misrepresentation, but for the purpose of

13

satisfying the threshold predicate requirement of whether

14

or not the plaintiff has purchased securities.

15

time and again in the course of that opinion, said that

16

the principal advantage of that doctrine was to place as a

17

requirement for standing in a 10(b) case a transaction

18

which could be proven by document.

MR. DODYK:

The question is was there an

Well, I'm not sure that Your Honor

4

is correct in saying that there's no question as to

5

whether or not there was a purchase of an option here in a

6

contractually binding sense, because as Your Honor is

7

aware, it certainly is our position that the court, the

district court, failed to properly instruct the jury with

Therefore, their right to make the purchase was clearly

In addition, in terms of the damage claim in

your construction is that yes, Blue Chip Stamps, as

MR. DODYK:

No it's not -- I'm not saying -- I

2

think it's a would have, should have case in many regards,

3

Your Honor, in many regards.

4

respect to the reason why Blue Chip Stamps should be

applied to the facts of this case is that I don't see any

6

difference in the quality of the oral evidence, or the

7

oral event which gave rise to the finding, and the quality

8

of the oral evidence which drove the Court in Blue Chip

saying that they cannot be the oral creation of the

MR. DODYK:

Yeah.
That's right.

I'm not saying that

oral representation cannot be fraudulent.

saying is where a plaintiff cannot satisfy the threshold

requirement of purchase of a security except by a purely

20

oral event, then I would --

21

QUESTION:

What I am

There's a statute that lists a whole

22

bunch of things that constitute a security; one of them is

an option. It doesn't say anything about in writing in the

text of the statute.

suggest that if you look at Section 3810 that all of the

2

elements of a security there as defined are elements which

3

are ordinarily written instruments -- common stock, bonds,

notes.

5

no one of the individual elements -- which is not a

written document and therefore --

7

There is nothing I think, Your Honor, in 3810 --

QUESTION:

Do you think that Blue Chip would

8

have come out differently if there were a writing from the

9

president of the purchaser to his mother saying we intend

10

to purchase this stock of this corporation next week.

11

you really think that the only problem in Blue Chip was

12

the lack of a writing, or was it the inherent difficulty

13

of showing what somebody would have done when it has not,

intentions.

MR. DODYK:

4

QUESTION:

Well, that is certainly true.
If that is true, then you have to

admit that Blue Chip doesn't stand for the proposition

6

that you can't have an orally-created security, and that

7

we are, as Justice Scalia started out by saying, going to

8

have to go beyond Blue Chip to hold your way here.

9

MR. DODYK:

Well, I'm not suggesting that the

10

Blue Chip Stamps opinion governs the facts of this case,

11

but I would point out to Your Honor is that two circuit

12

courts have interpreted Blue Chip Stamps to bar standing

13

to a plaintiff who sought to assert -- satisfied the

14

purchase requirement and sought to assert standing on the

basis of an oral agreement to purchase securities.

interpretations of Blue Chip Stamps since that case was

decided with respect to this particular issue.

You're

1

in effect saying that the '34 Act should be construed as,

2

in effect, incorporating the statute of frauds for

3

purposes of determining how a security, or what can

4

qualify as a security within the meaning of the Act.

5

question is, why should we interpret it when the statute

6

of frauds has traditionally had an independent life of its

7

own, and of course incidentally in this case, the statute

8

of frauds has either been satisfied by part performance,

9

or has been satisfied by part performance as I understand

10

it in the findings of the jury.

11

MR. DODYK:

My

Well, Your Honor, I would say a

12

couple of things about that.

13

courts of appeal have construed Blue Chip Stamps to hold

14

that if you had a purely oral event to satisfy the

15

purchase requirement which is unenforceable under the

statute of frauds, that under Blue Chips Stamps that

17

didn't suffice, number one.

First of all, certainly the

Number two, the argument I was making about Blue

interpretation of Justice Rehnquist's opinion in Blue Chip

the claim is too dubious in its nature to satisfy that

No, what I was saying was that where

for purposes of construing the Federal statute,

irrespective of the statute of fraud, that the rule is a

14

Federal rule, and the rule should be that where the event

which is said to satisfy the purchase of a security

Kagen and Pelletier approach would prevail, and that the

that both the district court and the Eleventh Circuit

statute of frauds question.

11

In the court of appeals they said that the

12

statute of frauds did not apply to this case because the

13

oral option, although a security for Securities Act

14

purposes was not a security for the purpose of the statute

15

of frauds.

16

about here is an oral agreement contract option for the

17

sale of securities.

18

question that the proper analysis on these facts is that

19

the oral option was the contract for the sale of

20

securities which the statute of frauds rendered

21

unenforceable.

MR. DODYK:

Well, Your Honor, if I understand

where we're at at this point, and that is, what is the -what should be the consequence of a decision in this
case?

That there was no Section 10(b) violation because

10

of the existence of the State claim.

11

that question briefly.

12

If I can address

My position on that question is that if you take

13

a look at the decided case authorities since Santa Fe and

14

Blue Chip Stamps, there are two lines of authority which

15

unanimously would have resulted in the dismissal of these

16

claims. Now, we've been talking about one of those lines,

17

and that is to say whether or not you can create a

18

purchase out of an oral event.

19

cases which doesn't deal with the purchase question.

20

Another line of cases which says that where you have a

21

misrepresentation of a party's intention to sell

22

securities, as distinguished in the language of the

23

courts, from a misrepresentation going to the value of the

24

securities, you don't have a Section 10(b) violation.

There are four circuit courts that have come to that

conclusion; there are two district court cases within the

2

last three years that have followed those cases.

this year --

4

QUESTION:

Just

What's the reasoning, Mr. Dodyk?

5

know, there's some English chancellor hundreds of years

6

ago said that the state of a man's mind is as much a

7

question of fact as the state of his digestion.

You

8

(Laughter)

9

MR. DODYK:

Yes, indeed, and that made it all

10

the way into the restatement, did it not?

11

But what I say to you is this, and it's not a simple

12

thought to get across, but to the extent we're talking

13

about whether or not that type of statement which has been

14

made in this case is actionable, that we've gone a long

15

way beyond the state of the digestion, and where we have

16

gotten to in the United States, generally speaking, is to

17

the economic loss doctrine, which is squarely applicable

18

to the facts of this case.

19

Honor, a doctrine which this Court should take into

20

account in deciding what types of misrepresentation are

21

actionable under Section 10(b).

22

QUESTION:

Did it not?

And I think it's also, Your

The proposition is --

Even giving you the point that the

23

only kind of misrepresentation that counts under 10(b) is

24

a misrepresentation of value, do you really think that an

2

promised to sell you?

3

from someone who when he gives you the option intends to

4

go through with the delivery of stock if you exercise it?

5

MR. DODYK:

6

QUESTION:

Is it worth as much as an option

Your Honor -Doesn't that -- I can't imagine what

7

would more go to the value of the option than the intent

8

of the optionor to follow through on the contract or not.

9

MR. DODYK:

Your Honor, I think whether or not

10

you recognize the distinction here depends on how you

11

characterize the purpose of the Securities Act -- if we're

12

talking about a 10(b)(5) case, which is what we're talking

13

about.

14

of actions which can undermine the value of a security or

15

an option to purchase a security.

16

is a very clear distinction between a misrepresentation

17

about the financial condition of a company and the refusal

18

to accede to an asserted contractual obligation to

19

delivery securities, and I suggest to Your Honors that

20

given the way in which this Court has articulated the

21

purpose of the '34 Act that a line should be drawn between

22

those representations which in the garden-variety Section

23

10(b)(5) case speak to the value of a security in a

24

situation such as this in which a person says he should

25

have sold me the stock and he didn't, and he lied about it

in the first place.

QUESTION:

Mr. Dodyk, you still haven't gotten

3

to why, even if we accept what you said, there should be

4

any redoing of this case when the State claims were tried,

5

and the same damages would apply to those.

6

MR. DODYK:

I keep trying to get there, but I

7

get diverted.

And the reason is this, and this is the

8

reason that I was speaking to the other reason why you

9

shouldn't find a Section 10(b) violation here, which is in

10

terms of the character of the representation which has

11

been made here, and the limited purpose of the '34 Act.

12

And I was about to get to that point when I said there are

13

four circuit courts who have decided uniformly,

14

consistently, that the '34 Act does not apply to an

15

alleged misrepresentation of a party's intention to sell

16

securities.

MR. DODYK:

And the answer is -- the answer is

21

that is the kind of decision which can be made in a Rule

There is a great deal of difficulty with a standard which

says whether or not the court should proceed to adjudicate

2

the State law claims depends on the degree of frivolity of

the Federal action.

courts -- which have decided that if you have a case which

is dismissable under Rule 12, then you shouldn't go

forward and adjudicate the State claims is squarely

8

applicable here.

QUESTION:

The question is, we're not in the

10

posture of should you go forward?

11

and what you're saying is that we should upset this entire

question was should the Federal court go forward on the

State claims once the Federal claim is out of the picture,

for the following reason.

in having important, unsettled questions of State law

been restricted from asserting jurisdiction over the State

That's correct.

assuming, granting me the assumption, that there is no

11

10(b)(5) action here, he should have thrown the case out

13

it make a difference that we have had some investment of

14

time as a result of a judicial mistake?

difference because there are values in restraining the

17

Federal judiciary from deciding State court issues in

those circumstances which are not excused by the fact that

19

someone made a mistake at the district court level and we

20

should therefore vacate that decision. That's what

happened in Tully v. Mott Supermarkets, for example.

that the Tenth Circuit and the district court were

unquestionably wrong in the way they decided the statute

in this deal?
MR. COHEN:

Well, the cost of providing the

1

MR. COHEN:

Well, let me say this about the

2

policy.

First, there is the difference between a mere

3

breach of contract and an intent at the time that a

4

contract is entered into not to perform, and several

5

courts of appeals have spoken to that.

6

talking here about the defendants' intention quite

7

different from the problem in Blue Chip of the plaintiff

8

proving the plaintiff's own intention by his own

9

affidavit, an inherently untestable thing that gets into

Second, we are

10

the jury to get past the defendant's intention, a

11

statement that he intended to fulfill the contract, the

12

plaintiff is going to have to come up with some concrete

13

evidence.

14

from Wharf's files that Wharf did not intend at the time

15

that it entered into the contract to fulfill it.

16

We had that evidence here -- written evidence

And furthermore, Congress has taken much of this

17

burden off the Court's shoulders, if you'll excuse me for

18

just a second, by adding the requirement in the Private

19

Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 in which it

20

recognized a 10(b)(5) claim and cited how to cabin it, and

21

it requires a specific pleading of facts sufficient to

22

create a quote strong inference of intent to defraud, and

23

if you can't do that, your claim is dismissed under that

24

statute.

we've got to say something definite about what the statute

And then the question of whether

there is a creation of the security in the case of the

creation of the option -- that too -- I mean, that's

essentially a contractual act, and that too is a question

to be governed by the State statute of frauds.

a question of Federal law.

Even if it is was a contract that was unilateral, the

performance of the services would take it out of the
