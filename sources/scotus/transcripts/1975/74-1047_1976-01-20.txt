PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll hear arguments next in 1047,

Mils against Gautreaux.
Mr. Solicitor General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BORK:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:

We're here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for
the Seventh Circuit.
The history of this litigation is rather complex, but I think
the facts that need to be stated for purposes of his review are stated
rather briefly. Respondents are six black residents in CHicago, who brought
this action in 1966 against a department, and agency of the Department
of Housing and Urban Development, on behalf of a class of black tenants
in and applicants for public housing projects in Chicago.
Their claim, which was subsequently upheld by the courts, was
that HUD aided public housing through financial assistance to the Chicago
Housing Authority, and that when it made that financial aid it knew that
members of the Chicago City Council were blocking the efforts of the
Chicago Housing Authority to place this housing in white residential
neighborhoods, thus reinforcing patterns of residential segregation.

4

And most of the tenants and applicants here were black.
It should be said in this case, by the way, I think it's of
some interest that when we -- as this case has developed, the phrase,
"a black residential neighborhood," or- "a limited housing neighborhood",
means one with more than 30 percent blacks. So it can be 30 percent black
and 70 percent white and still, for purposes of this case, be described
as a black neighborhood. Or it can be within one mile of any such
Census Tract and still be described as a black neighborhood.
Respondents brought a companion suit against the Chicago Housing
Authority, and the court found that that authority had in fact engaged
in the discriminatory practice. It issued an injunction, among the terms
of which were an order to halt the practices, to build the next 700 dwelling
units in the substantially, or over 70 percent, white residential areas of
Chicago, and to locate at least -- well, at least three-fourth of those units
were to be in those neighborhoods.
Now, in the parallel action against HUD, the Court of Appeals
for the Seventh Circuit reversed the district court's dismissal of the
complaint and held that HUD's knowing acquiescence in CHA's -- Chicago
Housing Authority's admittedly discriminatory housing program brought
HUD into violation of the Fifth Amendment and of Section 601 of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964.

5

I make no contention here, of course, that HIJD did not violate
those provisions by knowingly funding the CHicago Housing Authority, but
I think simple justice to the HUD officials involved requires me at least
to note that during the time of the violation, according to the district
court, HUD made efforts, consistent efforts, to correct what was heppening,
and had succeeded in some respects. And the Court of Appeals itself said that
it was fully sympathetic with HUD's dilemma of being dorced to choose between
the funding of construction of public housing in black neighborhoods or
denying housing althogether to thousands of needy Negro families.
The Court of Appeals on that appeal emphasized that its holding
should not be construed as granting a broad license to interfere with the
programs and actions of what it described as an "already beleaguered federal
agency." And it suggested the district court might find that little
equitable relief was needed beyond a best efforts clause necessary
to remedy the wrongs that had been committed.

At that point in the district court, the actions against HUD
and CHA were consolidated. The district court did enter a best efforts
clause, and there was still outstanding, of course, --against HUD-- and
there was still outstanding, of course, the relief against the Chicago
Housing Authority.

6

The district court specifically rejected plaintiffs' proposal for
hearings to develop a plan of metropolitan relief for the areas surrounding
the City of Chicago. Upon appeal, a wholly new panel of the Seventh Circuit,
with one judge dissenting, reversed and remanded for consideration of a comp­
rehensive metropolitan area plan. And that is the order -QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, in the district court, did the

plaintiffs' request for a metropolitan remedy -- was it accompanied by
a prayer to join the outlying housing authorities?
MR. BORK:

I don't recall whether there was a prayer at that stage.

There was a prayer which was granted in the district court after the remand
from the Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:
MR. BORK:
yes, there was.

I mean before the Court of Appeals.
Well, I would have to -- I believe there was a request -I believe there was a request to join them in the prospect,

in the district court before the appeal so that a metropolitan area plan
could be drawn up. But the Court of Appeals order that a comprehensive metro­
politan area plan be now considered is what is at issue here.
Meanwhile, the district court has permitted respondents to file a
supplemental complaint, to add as parties defendant the eleven local
housing authorities outside the City of Chicago, as well as the Illinois
Housing Development Housing Authority, the Northeastern Illinois Planning

7
Commission, and the director of the Illinois Department of Local Government
Affairs. And respondents' current assertion in this Court is that housing
in six Illinois counties, Cook--a part of which is the City of Chicago,
much of which is not--DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will; those counties,
which contain twelve local housing authorities and over three hundred cities,
villages, and townships are the area which should be swept into this case
and put under judicial supervision and used as a remedy, to remedy an act of
segregation that occurred entirely within the City of Chicago.
Now, none of tiiese counties or housing authorities or municipalities
has been in this case previously; none of them has been found to have
committed any act of discrimination, much less any act of discrimination
related in any way to what happened in Chicago. The objection of the
Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to the judg­
ment of the Court of Appeals is precisely this: This Secretary of HUD
will be required to impose obligations upon communities that are without
fault, in order to achieve a remedy for respondents that runs contrary to
her statutory obligations, and a remedy that is premised entirely upon
wrongdoing in Chicago.
THE COURT: Well, are you arguing, in the sense, in the absence
of indispensable parties?
MR. BORK: Not actually, Mr. Justice Rehnquist. I'm arguing that
this case is like Mi 11iken v. Bradley in the sense that the District
Court is being directed, in effect, by the Court of Appeals to exceed the
scope of allowable equitable remedies, and I'm arguing also that the Swann
case has something to say here, about this case.
I think--

8

THE COURT: Do you defend the District Court's refusal to permit
the joining of these outlying distrcits for the purpose of offering proof?
MR. BORK: No, no, if the—I think if the plaintiffs —I think this
case is very much like Mi 11iken. If the plaintiffs allege and prove an
interdistrist violation, we would have a different case. But that is not
the posture this case is in now. And I think, as this Court said in
Mi 11iken, the controlling principle, which has consistently been stated
in the holdings of this Court, is that the scope of the remedy is determined
by the nature and the extent of the violation. And, as the concurring
opinion put it there, the courts there were in error for the simple
reason that they thought what the--the remedy they thought necessary was
simply not commensurate with the constitutional violations fund. And that
is what I think is the difficulty here.
I want to discuss Mi 11 i ken, but I first want to develop a point
which is not fully developed in our brief, although it's present, and
which, in and of itself, seems to me fully dispositive of this case.
As I said, respondents here proved a violation which was entirely within
the City of Chicago. And relief was ordered there, quite properly. And
on this last appeal, the majority of the Court of Appeals ordered
consideration of metropolitan relief.
Now, it gave a couple of reasons why it thought metropolitan
relief was essential. One was that intra-city relief had become less
valuable while the case was pending, because the number of neighborhoods
with fewer than 30 percent black, or outside of one mile within a Census
Tract of less than 30 percent black residents, had declined, so that there
was difficulty getting sites to put enough public housing in areas with
more than 70 percent white population.

9

Well, I think it's important to ask why that is true. And it’s true
not because of any action by any governmental unit, it's true because of
demographic shifts, shifts in residential patterns in the Chicago area. Thou­
sands of individuals and families made personal choices, which they are
legally free to make, and, as a result, we are told, the Federal courts must
pursue those demographic shifts into outlying cities and townships and
municipalities. The court is not pursuing governmental action, nor even
connected with governmental action; they are pursuing populations and
demographic shifts.
Now, the otner thing the Court of Appeals said, and it's quite
clear in its opinion, is that it was reacting rot to the constitutional
violation in Chicago, but it was reacting to the phenomenon of "white
flight." And it was reacting to sociological and demographic predictions
about the distant future. 1984 was mentioned; the year 2000 was mentioned.
The remedy, in short, is actually addressed to a predicted de
facto segregation and not to the limited, proven de jure segregation in
public housing in Chicago. I happen to think that the sociological and
demographic predictions made by the Court of Appeals are not accurate;
and if sociology were relevant to this case, I would think that the remedy
chosen to deal with sociological trends is the worst possible remedy
one could choose. But that is not the point.
Chasing demographic shifts and attacking purely de facto living
patterns, I think, is not a proper remedial function of courts; and I
think this Court recognized that fact in Swann v. Chariotte-Mecklenburg,
and that seems to me sufficient to require reversal of the Court of Appeals
here. But, aside from the principle of Swann, there is the holding of
Mi 111 ken v. Bradley. This violation took place, as I have said repeatedly,
within the City of Chicago and it is therefore inapprcpr;ate to frame

10

relief in an area that encompasses three hundred other governmental units,
more than three hundred--three hundred other towns and villages that are
complete strangers to the action and to the violation.
Now, respondents' attempted answer to this is that this is not
interdistrict relief in the Mi 11iken sense, because it is not interdistrict
relief as to HUD, since HUD may operate over metropolitan areas. Well, that's
fallacious. That answer is fallacious for two reasons:
The first is that this remedy, even if it is nominally directed,
or actually directed only against HUD in a legal sense, will actually destroy
the autonomy and some of the political processes of the cities and housing
authorities who have no connection with the violation in Chicago.
And, secondly, I think it's irrelevant--it's a fallacious answer
because the remedy would compel HUD—and this cannot be gotten around— this
remedy would compel HUD to ignore obligations placed upon it by Congress.
Now, respondents' argument as to the first point is that the
1974 Act permits HUD to bypass local communities, and to deal with private
developers. And that-THE COURT: With what geographical restrictions, if any?
MR. BORK: Well, I think they may—they may deal with private
developers; I don't think they--you're supposed to comply with the zoning
ordinances, and so forth, of the city you're in.
THE COURT: That would--within a given metropolitan community, or-MR. BORK: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Well, they deal with private devel­
opers in any particular community, but under certain limitations. But my
first point is that even if those limitations weren't present in the
statute about what HUD may do, it is wrong to say that these communities
are not being involved in this lawsuit, because the result would still

11

be that communities that have done nothing wrong whatever, and that neither
need nor want public housing, would have public housing placed upon them
by court order.
THE COURT: Does HUD have authority of eminent domain, to condemn
land itself, or must it operate through state and local housing authorities?
MR. BORK: It must operate through community, state or local housing
auhtorities, or with private developers under certain limitations. But it
doesn't--HUD does not build these—currently HUD is not building anything
and is not seizing property. It is subsidizing rental.
THE COURT: Well, some Federal agencies do have the power of eminent
domain; is that not true?
MR. BORK: I believe

that's true.

THE COURT: But HUD--you represent to us that they do not have that
power?
MR. BORK: That is correct.

They do not.

THE COURT: Would HUD have authority, in your view, to enter into a
contract witn a private builder, to erect a housing project contrary to
local zoning laws?
MR. BORK: No.
THE COURT: Doesn't the decree of the--doesn't the final paragraph
in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, in effect, mandate that?
MR. BORK: Well, I think what's going to happen--in effect mandates
it to work; but respondents say that the decree does not allow them to, nor
do they wish to, override local zoning ordinances. Now, what's going to
happen, as a practical matter, in the area around Chicago is that zoning
changes are going to have to be requested to put up multi-family dwellings
of this size.

And it has to be at least of a certain size, fifty to one

hundred fami 1ies, to make it economically feasible.

12

THE COURT: But since the local agencies, the loca’ housing authorities
and the local governmental bodies were riot parties to the case, what sanction
will there be to compel them to comply with this—
MR. BORK: Well, I assume, Mr. Justice Powell, that either in this
case or in a separate case, we will then have a series of litigations about
whether refusal to make zoning changes or variances was discriminatory.
I think that's the way it would have to work out.
THE COURT: But certainly Judge Austin, if he's still sitting on
the case, or if his successor, might well feel that the issue of the avail­
ability of a metropolitan remedy would be foreclosed in favor of a metro­
politan remedy by the Court of Appeals opinion here; might he not?
MR. BORK: Oh, I think that Judge Austin, if--with the direction in
that opinion, in that order, is bound to feel that he has to enter some
kind of a metropolitan remedy.
THE COURT: That's right.
MR. BORK: But my point is that quite aside from the limitations
placed upon HUD—and I think this is an important point, about dealing
with local communities, if it were true—whic'

's not—if it were

true that HUD could deal with private developer^ and ignore the local comm­
unity, those local communities would have public housing they don't need, they
don't want. They've committed no constitutional violation, and they are
going to have to provide the services: the police protection, the fire
protection, the additional schooling for families with children—to benefit
citizens of Chicago. But--and I want to say this: My point is not merely
that that is not a proper equitable remedy; my point is that a rather
extraordinary legal principle is being formulated here.

13

Well, remember what happened in this case. The Chicaqo Housinq
authority was held responsible because of the acts of the Chicago City Council.
HUD was then held responsible because of the acts of the Chicago Housing
Authority. And now, wholly uninvolved town governments are to be held
responsible because HUD can reach them. That's all. HUD is to be made into a
conduit, through which the impact of local violations flows outward to otherall other governments in the area that respondents or the District Court
think it useful to reach.
Now, I say that's an extraordinary legal principle because, as
Federal assistance and Federal authority increase--not only in this field,
but iri all kinds of fields--that principle would expand the equitable
powers of district courts to unheard of dimensions. In this very case, I
think it's clear that this Court has been pushed from performing a trad­
itional judicial function of framing an equitable remedy into a position
where it's going to become, necessarily, a metropolitan-wide land use and
social planning agency, on a continuing basis.
Now, I think all of that would be bad enough, but it's also true-and respondents' brief, I think, obscures this fact--that metropolitan relief
would require HUD to violate limitations built into its authority by Congress.
Now, it's all very we11-1 think respondents' counsel say that Congress
contemplated metropolitan planning, and that HUD officials endorse metro­
politan planning. And that is entirely true. HUD does that, and HUD will
continue to think and plan in metropolitan terms, regardless of the out­
come of this case. But it is also true that in metropolitan planning,
Congress has placed limitations and processes that must be observed, and
that a court order would have to sweep away. And the relief proposed here,
I think, would reverse the congressional thrust in the 1974 Amendments,
the 1974 Housing Act, to return more decision-making to local communities.

14

Let me indicate briefly a couple of examples of how coercion would
be necessary, or how violation of HUD's statutory mandate would be necessary.
One example: a community which receives funding from HUD for
community development activities under the block grant program, which is Title
I of the 1974 Act, is required to prepare a housing assistance plan of its
own housing needs in that community as part of its application. Now, the
statute requires, or it is required that that housing assistance plan must
be prepared by citizen participation, including two public hearings for the
citizens. And it must be later reviewed and commented upon by the relevant
area-wide planning agencies for the state and for the locality.
HUD cannot unilaterally decide to work with a private developer
n order to put up public housing in that community. Instead, HUD is
required, under Section 213 of the Act, to forward any proposal by a
private developer for public

housing to the community, and the community

is required to determine whether or not that proposal is consistent with its
housing assistance plan, which it has been required to make, and which has
been made through citizen participation.
If the community says the proposal for public housing is not
consistent, then the Secretary cannot go forward unless she determines,
despite that, that the proposal is consistent with the community's own
housing assistance plan; and if HUD does that and goes forward and the
community disagrees, the the community may seek judicial review.
That is all built into the 1974 Act. Any community—and a number
of these communities do--that has the block grant program and a housing
assistance program, all of this would have to be swept away if you're
talking about HUD dealing with a private developer without interfering
with the community. If a town is not a participant in that plan, then

15

Section 213(c) of Title II applies, the Secretary consults with the town.
And of course the town's wishes have influence, but the Secretary shall not

approve a proposal there, even from a private developer, unless she deter­
mines that there is need for Federally assisted public housing, taking into
consideration the applicable State plans, and finding that there is, or will
be available in the area, public facilities and services adequate to service
the proposed development.
Now, I think that court-ordered metropolitan relief, in this case,
no matter how gently it's gone about, no matter how it's framed, is bound
to require HUD to ignore the safeguards of local autonomy and local political
processes; the very safeguards Congress deliberately built into the 1974 Act.
THE COURT: Mr. Solicitor General, what if there has been, as there
wasn't before the Court of Appeals ruling, a hearing in the District Court
after a complaint in which all of the outlying authorities had been joined,
and there had been a finding by the District Court of inter-district viola­
tions on the part of all? Wouldn't that put the case in a somewhat different
posture?
MR. BORK: That would put the case in an entirely different posture,
Mr. Justice Rehnquist. But we have here the remedy appropriate to a case
which is not here, which is our problem.
Finally, there is not a shred of evidence in this case that any­
thing done within Chicago produced any segregatory effect in any other city,
and certainly not a segregatory effect between Chicago and any other city.
Mow, there is Exhibit 11, which has been offered in this case
and which is a map that's at the back of respondents' brief. And I must say
that that Exhibit 11 does not prove anything. It doesn't prove segregation.
It doesn't even raise a prima facie case of segregation in any outlying city,
and it certainly doesn't prove any causation between what happened in public
housing in Chicago and the situation in any outlying city. Remember that these

16

shaded areas, these limited housing areas, they get shaded if they are more
than 30 percent black. Those aren't solid black communities—or they get
shaded if they're within one mile of a 30 percent black Census Tract.
THE COURT: How did this come into the record?
MR. BORK: Respondents' counsel drew this map and put it into the
record to indicate that there were no alternatives available to respondents
to move into public housing in white areas outside of Chicago.
THE COURT: Well, how was it authenticated?
MR. BORK: I don't believe—I'm subject to correction; but I don't
believe it is authenticated. I think it was drafted by respondents' counsel
as an illustration and put in.
THE COURT: Was it admitted in evidence in some factual proceeding
in the District Court?
MR. BORK: No, I think it's just submitted. I don't think it's been—
I don't think there's been any testimony taken about how this was drawn,
or the lines, or anything else. But let me make a point about it:
If one looks at this rather large area with two close-together
dots for hot ing areas here, right below the City of Chicago—
THE COURT: Right.
MR. BORK: --that's the Robbins. That's the town of Robbins.
Now, that looks like somebody has placed housing in the middle of
a black area, and maybe that's supposed to be segregatory. It is worth
noting that the town of Robbins itself is 98.1 percent black, and that this
Census Tract, upon which that public housing is located, is 94.4 percent
black, so that there is no way for the town of Robbins to put up any public
housing that is not in a black area. So that doesn't show segregation.
THE COURT: Does Robbins have its own housing authority?

17

MR. BORK: Well, it has its own government. I don't know whether it
has a housing authority, because many of these communities don't have
housing authorities.
THE COURT: Yes, I know that.
MR. BORK: It's handled—I don't know if Robbins has a housing
authority, or whether it operates through its City Council. The answer,
I take it, is no.
Directly below that one will see a black area with six black dots.
The three to the right, to the east, are in the city of East Chicago Heights.
That city is 98.2 percent black, and the public housing happens to be in a
Census Tract which is 80 percent black. There is, again, no possibility that
any public housing could be put up in those two cities that was not in a
black Census Tract. So this map, if it showed it, does not even raise a
prima facie case of segregation in the suburbs. If it did show a prima
facie case of segregation in the suburbs, it would certainly not show that
there was any connection between what happened in Chicago and that--I take
it back. I'm told that the map is not Exhibit 11. It's just an exhibit in
the brief; just an attachment in the brief.
Mi 11iken v.—
THE COURT: Just offered as a visual aid? Is that what it is?
MR. BORK: Well, I didn't--the respondents offered it. Mr. Chief
Justice, and I guess it's offered as an indication of what they regard
as prima facie evidence. I don’t think it's prima facie evidence of anything.
Our final submission is that Mi 11iken v. Bradley governs this case.
The faults of one locality are being made a jurisdictional predicate for
are-wide social planning on communities that are in no way involved. And I
think Swann suggests that judicial attempts to follow demographic shifts

18

that are not due to any constitutional violation really involves a court
in doing little more than requiring racial balance as a constitutional man­
date, where no constitutional violation has occurred.
Thank you.
MR.CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Mr. Polikoff.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEXANDER POLIKOFF, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. POLIKOFF: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the
Court:
I wish to make two basic points this morning. The first is that
a remedial order confined to HUD and extending throughout the HUD-defined
Chicago housing market area is a practical option open to the district
judge. It would be an appropriate order in this case, and it would not be
an inter-district order under Mi 11iken. And, incidentally, it would not be
an order that answers to the description that the Solicitor General gave you,
of the order that was entered by the Court of Appeals. I have the feeling
that we are addressing two different cases here this morning. The Solicitor
General's view of what is mandated by the Court of Appeals, as I will show
in a moment, is not my view of what that Court has mandated or, indeed, of what
would be proper under equitable principles the Solicitor General and I,
I am sure, share.
THE COURT: Would the power of eminent domain have to be exercised
by someone to implement this decree?
MR. POLIKOFF: It

would have to be exercised by--

THE COURT: Who would do that?
MR. POLIKOFF: --by private developers or by local housing authorities,
and not by HUD. HUD has never exercised that power of eminent domain in the

19

operation of these programs. And the exercise of that power presents no
problem, no obstacles in framing equitable relief here. Where a developer,
public or private, has acquired land, it then applies to HUD for funds to
promote a subsidized housing project on that land. If it has not acquired
the land, it never comes to HUD for the money in the first place.
We have never contended in this case, and we do not contend now,
that the zoning power is at issue. The decree which the Solicitor General
suggests mandates a judicial supervision of the exercise of zoning powers
by local communities is not the decree we envision; and it is not, in our
opinion, the decree compelled by the Court of Appeals order in this case.
I think the suggestion--and it's one of many similar suggestions in the
government's brief and in the argument here this morning--that a parade
of horrors will be the result of implementation of a metropolitan remedial
plan at the District Court level is simply inaccurate.
As our brief indicates, and we've cited cases and HUD regulations
to this effect, subsidized housing is required to comply with local zoning
and other land-use control regulations, and nothing we have proposed in
this case to date and nothing said by the Court of Appeals, in our judgment,
changes that fact. And on remand before the District Court we would not pro­
pose anything different than I'm saying here right now.
THE COURT: Mr. Polikoff, what—as you conceive the decree that would
be required under the remand of the Court of Appeals, what effect would it
have on the local authorities who weren't previously parties?
MR. POLIKOFF: It might have none, Your Honor. But-THE COURT: Well, but might it have some?
MR. POLIKOFF: It might have an indirect impact--and one of the
problems is, we can't know. Because as my first of two points--and I haven't
even told you yet what the second is. My first of two points was that an
order might be confined to HUD alone, if the District Court--in its judgment

20

on reinand--did confine such an order to HUD alone, it would have no direct
impact upon local housing authorities. They would not be decretally
involved. The order would not run against them at all. They would only be
indirectly involved in the following way:
If and when a local housing authority voluntarily chose to
apply for HUD subsidy funds in order to develop some housing--a choice,
I repeat for emphasis, would be voluntarily made on its part; there would
be no impact if it chose not to do so—it would then be subject to the
conditions that HUD imposed on the use of Federal funds offered to
applying housing authorities. In our view, as indicated in the Appendix
to our brief, one conceivable remedial decree might be a direction to HUD
to impose two additional conditions on the use of Federal funds in the
Chicago housing market area by those who apply for such funds.
The first such condition—a condition essentially already con­
tained in HUD regulations—would be that housing be predominantly provided
in the future in white, rather than black neighborhoods, because the history
of the constitutional and statutory violation in this case is confining
it to black neighborhoods.
The second condition would be that a portion of the housing thus
provided be made available to members of the plaintiff class as a remedial
measure.
Now-THE COURT: But how can you justify the imposition of that second
condition as against outlying authorities who have never had an opportunity
to litigate any of these questions?
MR. P0LIK0FF: We don't. We don't suggest that the imposition of that
condition should be imposed against persons who have not had an opportunity
to litigate. That was the inherent implication in your question of the Solicitor

21

General. And I would like to advise Your Honor that the Solicitor General
was correct.
Before the District Court, long before the case reached the Court of
Appeals, we did request the District Court to enter an order, I'll call it a
Mi 11 iken type order, if you will, in which he determined that it would be
appropriate under the circumstances of the case to consider housing market
area relief. But, we said, before doing so, it would be necessary to add the
governmental parties, not the local communities that the Solicitor General
talks about in the scores and in the hundreds, because they don't provide
housing. Robbins does not provide housing. It is the Cook County Housing
Authority which does. We suggested that before the District Court embarked
on a consideration of metropolitan relief and because of the dictates of
Mi 11iken , the appropriate affected parties should be added.
We suggested to the District Court which parties we would suggest
adding: the State of Illinois and the housing authorities in the housing
market area potentially to be affected.
We suggested that the District Court should direct HUD and CHA
to indicate what additional parties, if any, ought to be added. And only
at that stage, we said to the District Court, should you consider to—should
you proceed to consider a metropolitan plan.
Indeed, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we submitted a proposed order in
connection with that motion to the District Court, in which ve specifically
said the court is not now called upon to decide whether to order metro­
politan relief, but only that for the consideration of such relief it's
appropriate to add these parties. That motion was denied, and-THE COURT: Does this argument suggest that perhaps it's premature
for us to grapple with the issues involved there?

22

MR. POLIKOFF: I think it does, Your Honor. And as-THE COURT: Because what you've been saying, I gather, is that there
is no order yet. None of us knows what the contours will be. None of us
knows the impact on the outlying municipalities, indeed, even the impact
on HUD.
MR. POLIKOFF: That's exactly correct. And as Mr. Justice Blackmun
said, speaking for the Court in the recent case of Wheeler v. Barrera, the
case involving teaching in parochial schools by publicly paid teachers,
the order before the Court--in that case it was a statute, but I'm drawing
an analogy--did not mandate on-the-premises parochial school instruction.
So that issue was not yet presented, and that if on remand, Missouri and its
State agencies chose to opt for that form of instruction, Mr. Justice
Blackmun said, the range of possibilities was still very broad and the
First Amendment implications of such a plan would vary depending on what
was adopted.
THE COURT: Are you familiar with our recent summary affirmance
in the Delaware school desegregation case?
MR. POLIKOFF: I am, Your Honor.
THE COURT: Well, you recall there it was proposed that the District
Court consider a metropolitan remedy in a school desegregation case-MR. POLIKOFF: That's correct.
THE COURT: —but had not, in fact, entered a decree providing a
metropolitan remedy. And we summarily affirmed--it was an appeal of course.
Does that--is that like this situation?
MR. POLIKOFF: I think that emphasizes the prematurity. Indeed,
the second point--which I haven't yet had the opportunity to tell Your
Honors about—was precisely this: that the issue of a remedial decree
that embraced, if it did--and we don't know whether it would or not—
but that embraced lo:al housing authorities is premature at this point,

23

because we don't have the shape of that decree before us, let alone knowing
for sure that such a decree would be entered.
THE COURT: Yet, don't you have to say that the Court of Appeals
then, too, was premature in saying that there should be--as it did—that
there should be a metropolitan remedy?
MR. POLIKOFF: I do, Your Honor. And I must say, with deference to
the Court of Appeals, that I am not here defending that opinion, per se.
A remand—I'm defending the result; I think the result is sound. But I think
the language is overly broad and, as this Court knows, a remand to the
District Court would be in compliance with whatever this Court said in its
opinion, not with what the Court of Appeals said.
I think that on remand, with the proper parties added, it would
be open to the District Court in theory. I think it's very unlikely, as a
matter of fact, for reasons I'll come to. I think it would be open to the
District Court, in theory, to decide against the metropolitan plan. And I
don't think, without having joined the appropriate parties to be joined
and having heard them, a final determination can be made with respect to
that matter, either.
THE COURT: In this respect, isn't this case in very much the
same posture that the Mi 11iken case was when it came here?
MR. POLIKOFF: Not at all, Your Honor. The government's brief—
its reply memorandum, rather, makes the flat-out statement that this case
i_s_ at the same stage that Mi 11 iken was when this Court granted certiorari.
I differ with that view.
The District Court in Mi 11iken, before this Court took the case,
had entered a plan—entered an order which provided for the establishment
of a panel of nine persons to formulate a desegregation plan, and it had
laid ouc a nunmer of precise respects in which that panel was to operate.

24

It talked about the equalization of facilities between school districts, the
financial arrangements to be made between them, and a number of other partic­
ulars. And only after it was clear in Mi 11iken, as a result of the entry
of that order—even though the Court of Appeals sent it back in some
particulars, it essentially affirmed the District Court's basic approach
in dealing with those matters, and involving the local districts--then it
came to this Court.
THE COURT: But the Court of Appeals affirmed an approach, though.
MR. POLIKOFF: It affirmed an approach, but with a clear indication
that in— it was a long Court of Appeals opinion, Your Honor will recall-THE COURT: That it was.
MR. POLIKOFF: --in a number of specifics that the District Court
had indicated, that was the right way to go. 'low, we don't have that here.
We don't have anything like that here. We haven't even heard at the lower
court levels, let alone at this Court level, from the parties who might
be affected. And therefore, it is not even clear, Your Honor, and it was
clear in Mil1iken--it is not even clear here that the District Court would
enter an order that would involve local housing authorities at all.
THE COURT: You mean—you don't mean—you mean out of Chicago?
MR. POLIKOFF: Out of Chicago.
THE COURT: Yes.
MR. POLIKOFF: That it would involve them at all. I wish-THE COURT: Just what was the Court of Appeals talking about?
MR. POLIKOFF: The Court of Appeals was talking, Your Honor, about
the desirability, on the record made in this case, of area-wide, but not
multi-district relief:
In Mi 11iken, this Court spoke not merely of
area-wide relief in a geographic sense, but of
area-wide multi-district relief.

25

That's a quotation, I believe, from a phrase that appears in Your
Honor's--Kr. Chief Justice Burger1s--opinion in Mil liken. And what that
phrase meant in Mi 11iken was that the relief envisioned by the lower court
and the Court of Appeals in that case necessarily involved what Your Honor
called "included districts," decrees that ran--a decree that ran against local
governmental entities, discreet autonomous units, and required them to do
something. They were decretal parties. In this case, the Court of Appeals'
direction to be metropolitan area-wide in scope, need not involve the
decretal provisions that require the inclusion of additional parties.
My very first point, in answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's early
question, was that one envisionable--if there is such a word--one envisionable form of relief in this case is a decree confined to HUD that does
not decretally run against anybody else, that tells HUD to utilize what it
already utilizes administratively; a housing market area unit for admini­
stering the stream of Federal subsidy funds flowing into the Chicago area,
that has in the past caused discrimination, and in the future ought to be
used to remedy it.
Now, that flow of Federal funds HUD administers on an area-wide
basis, not an area-wide multi-district basis as in Mi 11iken, but an area­
wide basis. It compares competing proposals for the use of those funds that
come to it from within that area. Now, why does it choose such an area?
It does so because HUD's regulations say that in the real world,
housing is not like schools. Children are assigned to schools within a
discreet geographic area, and they have to go there, they can't go any­
where else if they live within that area. HUD says, that by contrast in the
housing situation, people look for housing in terms of how far they are
from jobs--commuting distances. What the market for housing is is deter-

26

mined by HUD to be a specific geographic area that crosses the boundary
lines of local political jurisdictions.
THE COURT: But even if those housing authorities aren't, as you
say, decretally involved, if HUD is to be enjoined by the court to treat
them in a manner otherwise than it would voluntarily treat them, ought
they not to have had an opportunity to be heard on that question?
MR. POLIKOFF: We insist that they should, and I've been agree­
ing with you, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that that should have been che proce­
dure followed. It was the procedure we requested the District Court to
follow. It was aborted because the District Court denied our motion to that
effect. And, indeed, the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals was an
appeal, not from the entire judgment order entered by the District Court,
but only from that portion of the order that denied the motion you and I
have just been talking about. The rest of the judgment order was a general
summary judgment against HUD. We didn't appeal from that, HUD filed a
cross-appeal from that portion of the order and later abandoned it, and
rightly so, because of the order they, themselves, proposed.
The second aspect of your question, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, implied,
as I understood it, that there might be something inequitable even about
an indirect involvement of the local housing authorities, since they weren't
involved in the wrong. I'm assuming for this purpose that the wrong is
viewed as being limited to Chicago.
We believe that's not so, also. The cases cited in our brief
show that in the administration of Federal programs, Federal courts have a
number of times — in food stamp cases, in employment services cases —
confined relief to the Federal administering agency in connection with a
joint federally-1ocally administered program. The courts have said that's

27

proper. The indirect impact on the states is something that's mandated by
Federal law.
But even beyond that, the major current form of federally subsid­
ized housing activities doesn't necessarily involve local housing authorities
at all. HUD's current program is primarily a private developer program, not a
local housing authority program. HUD's dealings are primarily with private
developers, and with respect to that kind of low of federally subsidized
activities, the local jurisdictional boundary lines are completely irrelevant.
Housing authorities ma^, but need not, enter into the program. It's a matter
of their own voluntary choice.
In sum,—
THE COURT: What would you do with this?
MR. POLIKOFF: There are two alternatives, it seems to me. One is to
dismiss the writ as improvidently granted, because the whole thing appears
premature.
THE COURT: Well, one of the difficulties with that, if I may suggest
it, is what you just said to us: you don't agree that the—you do think that
the opinion, at least, sweeps over-broadly, from the Court of Appeals.
MR. POLIKOFF: Correct, I do.
THE COURT: So a dismissal leaving that stand probably would not be
the—
MR. POLIKOFF: All right. The second alternative--and in my view, by
far the preferable one, because this has been a long-lasting litigation
and clarity is desirable--the second would be to recognize the force, as I
see it--and I hope you do--of my point number one. That on any view--giving
the most weight and strength to the Mi 11iken considerations--on any view, a
decree limited to HUD, not running against local housing authorities or
other governmental entities, would be an appropriate order in this case and
would not be i nter-di strict under Mi Hi ken.

ca

Now, on that view, the Court of Appeals judgment--not its opinion,
of course--but the Court of Appeals judgment could be affirmed, because all
that judgment does is-THE COURT: Well, affirmed with the limitation that you—
MR. POLIKOFF: With the limitation that I—well, what I'm suggesting
is a limitation as to an appropriate order that might be entered by the
District Court; but the District Court would not be confined to that.
The other possibilities, in light of the—of procedural corrections
that Mr. Justice Rehnquist and I have been talking about having been made,
the District Court could then consider whether or not--and I'm not
predicting--whether or not the relief extending beyond what would be
appropriate-THE COURT: Well, this strikes me rather more like modification
of the remand of the Court of Appeals to the District Court than it does
an affirmance, Mr. Polikoff.
MR. POLIKOFF: I agree with that, Your Honor.
THE COURT: It's an affirmance in that you think that we ought to
agree that the case ought to be remanded to the District Court?
MR. POLIKOFF: Yes, That's correct. That's correct. But I—
THE COURT: Not just to issue an order.
MR. POLIKOFF: Pardon me?
THE COURT: You want the District Court to hold a hearing, you don't
want them just to issue an order.
MR. POLIKOFF: That's correct. We think the next step--and indeed
what we asked for in our motion below that was denied--was the holding of
hearings.

29

THE COURT: But you've said, as I understand it, that when it got
to the District Court, the District Court could say--would be free to say
if it so concluded—that under Mi 11iken he could not go beyond the bound­
aries of Chicago.
MR. POLIKOFF: The District Court would not, in our judgment, be
free to say that soundly and correctly, because, as I've indicated—it's
my first and principal point here, Mr. Chief Justice Burger--that an order
confined to HUD, even though it extended area-wide to the housing market
area, but did not involve other parties, would not be an inter-district
order under Mi 11iken. The-THE COURT: What kind of an order would go to HUD, to say: Exercise
your—to the Secretary—to say: Exercise your discretion according to the
following guidelines?
MR. POLIKOFF: Not quite that way. We have an order in Chicago,
Your Honor, to i11ustrate--and I'm not--I'm answering your question in terms of
what the District Court might do, what one of the options would be—we have
an order in CHicago that essentially imposes two requirements on HUD. It says
that Federal housing subsidy funds henceforth flowing into Chicago should meet
two criteria — if they're to be used in Chicago—in addition to all of your
other criteria. And those two criteria are: first, the predominance in white,
rather than black neighborhoods; and, second, availability of some of the
housing to the plaintiff class.
Now, to answer your question, Mr. Chief Justice Burger, exactly
those two criteria could be directed by the District Court to be used by
HUD in the area HUD already uses to administer these programs, that would
not involve other parties, that would not, in our view, therefore, be an
inter-district order under Mi 11iken, and the District Court would not, there­
fore, be prohibited by Mi 11iken from entering such an area-wide order against
HUD. But that--

JU

THE COURT: What is the authority of a Federal district judge to
tell the Executive Branch how to exercise its discretion?
MR. POLIKOFF: The authority—I would say the duty, stems from the
adjudication of liability against HUD. The Federal Executive Branch is
obligated to remedy its constitutional and statutory wrongs just as much as
state and local governments are; and cases without number have imposed
restrictions and limitations on Federal agencies, requiring them to remedy
their own wrongs.
THE COURT: What wrong do you identify here, when you refer to that-MR. POLIKOFF: The Solicitor General emphasizes, and properly so,
that HUD's wrong was, in a sense, secondary, because it consisted of funding
and approving actions of another agency. But we insist, and I think also
correctly so, that the Court of Appeals was right in finding that HUD's
activities, although understandable, were nonetheless an independent basis
of wrongdoing; it violated both the Constitution and the Civil Rights Act.
HUD simply-THE COURT: But all of that relates simply to the Chicago Housing
Authority, as I understand it. It isn't just that the local authorities
haven't had an opportunity to litigate factually in a district court their
activities in the area outside of Chicago, but I gather there's been no
factual hearing on HUD's activities outside of the Chicago Housing Authority
area.
MR. POLIKOFF: That's correct. Your Honor.
In our view, housing market area relief against HUD would not be
dependent upon such a factual hearing, because the Chicago--the City of
Chicago is located with the Chicago housing market area, an administrative
area that HUD defines and uses as the appropriate area for a number of
purposes, particularly and specifically including--and I'm now quoting

31

from a HUD regulation--"decreasing the effects of past housing discrimination."
THE COURT: But your theory in the District Court, which was upheld
by the Court of Appeals on the first appeal, was that HUD's violations had
been secondary as a result of pressure from Chicago aldermen. Now, it seems
to me, that when you get outside of the City of Chicago, you would have to
make sime sort of a new showing that HUD had engaged in similar violations;
the fact that it had responded to pressures from Chicago aldermen, would
not necessarily mean that Joliet aldermen or Elgin aldermen would have put
the same pressures on HUD.
MR. POLIKOFF: I think not. It's important to distinguish between
what's necessary to demonstrate at the liability of the case and what's
appropriate for an equity court to consider at the remedial stage of the
case.
If we assume, for the moment--and I'm not arguing it here; I'm
certainly not waiving it, I'll come to it shortly if there's time--but if
we assume--the suburban discrimination aspect of the case--but if we assume
for a moment that the wrongs were confined to the City of Chicago, nonethe­
less, residents of the City of Chicago seek housing, as HUD itself says,
not within the boundaries of the City of Chicago, but within the housing
market area. They seek it throughout that entire area. HUD constantly ad­
ministers its programs with respect to that broader area.
Now, liability having been established on the part of HUD, admittedly
by assumption, for our purposes here of the moment, within the City of
Chicago, it's incumbent upon HUD and it's incumbent upon an equity court
to direct HUD to provide the fullest possible, the most effective relief
that may be attainable with ' spect’ to the wrongs it's committed in Chicago.

32

Now, why—implied in your question, Mr. Justice Rehnquist—should
HUD, in doing that, go beyond the City of Chicago's corporate boundary limits?

Well, the answer is, unlike the situation with schools, housing is
sought by the persons in Chicago, including the wronged persons, within the
housing market area. It's therefore possible for HUD to provide relief for
those persons in accordance with its normal administrative activities, as
indicated by its own regulations, where there is a realistic geographic
area with respect to housing. It wouldn't be with respect to schools.
It is true that the nature of the wrong determines the scope of
the remedy, but the nature of the wrong, in this case, is not a schools
wrong, it is a housing wrong. And the nature of the universe of housing
is that we deal with market areas, we don't deal with identifiable and
confined geographic units called "school districts." And the nature of the
housing wrong in this case not only justifies, but compels the equitable
relief of using the housing market area as the remedial geography.
THE COURT: It wasn't that the school districts were geographic
units, they were political units.
MR. POLIKOFF: Both. That's correct, Your Honor.
THE COURT: And here, too, you have political units.
MR. POLIKOFF: And the political unit that's relevant with respect
to HUD is, of course, the entity--the Department of Housing and Urban
Developmerit--which has chosen an administrative area that expands beyond the
boundaries of the local housing authorities--who may not even be participants
at all in a part of the remedial scheme we're talking about. One of the
anoinal ies-THE COURT: But in Milliken, you had the State of Michigan with an
over-all regional educational policy and powers.
MR. POLIKOFF: That's correct. Not being exercised--it had a potential
or latent power--

33

THE COURT: Unh-hunh.
MR. POLIKOFF: --to compel the consolidation of local school districts
in that case. Here, we don't have a potential or latent power on the part
of HUD to compel anybody to do anything, we're not talking about compelling,
we are talking about an order confined to HUD that's a practical option
to the District Court that wouldn't compel anybody, other than HUD, to do
anything.
There would, of course, be indirect impacts on housing developers,
private developers, as well as public developers, who chose voluntarily
to apply for the housing. But those indirect impacts are no ground for
refusing or denying the relief against HUD that plaintiffs are entitled to,
as a remedial matter.
I guess my time has expired. Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Very well.
Mr. Solicitor General.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BORK: Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court:
Let me address the question of the remand, because I think that would
be totally improper in this case. A remand would send this case back, under
respondents' counsel's theory, to consider metropolitan-wide relief, which we
think can be shown now, and we think we have shown now, as a matter of law,
to be improper.
Secondly, in answer to the question by Mr. Justice Rehnquist: I think it
would do no good, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, to bring in local communities for a
hearing about a remedy. They might be heard about a remedy, they might
prevail, or they might be overridden, but they are being subjected to hearings

34

and a possible remedy when they have committed no violation.
THE COURT: Well, my question suggested not a hearing about a
remedy, but a question about whether there had been an initial wrong, and
then, presumably, if a finding of a wrong, a remedy.
MR. BORK: Oh, I quite agree in that case. If the respondents' counsel
wants to file a new case or amend this case and start a new lawsuit about an
inter-district violation in effect, of course. Now, this talk about ordering
HUD alone—and this not being inter-district as to HUD—is a semantic game
thai really ought not to go on unchallenged.
The truth is, as I stressed in my opening statement, there will
be cn enormous practical impact on innocent communities who have to bear
the burden of this housing, who will have to house a plaintiff class from
Chicago, which they wronged in no way, whose political processes, which are
respected by Congress, will be overridden; and there is no way that this
is not an inter-district remedy even though you use HUD as the conduit.
It is very dangerous to say that any time a Federal agency does
anything wrong in any locality—because the Federal agency has jurisdiction
over a very wide area--the Federal agency can be asked to sweep in the
residents of that entire area, although they were not involved in any wrong­
doing in any shape or form.
THE COURT: Mr. Solicitor, I understand the position to be that the
Court might not issue any decree at all.
MR. BORK: The Court might not, I think, Mr. Justice Marshall, if
the District Court were not to issue any metropolitan decree, it could only
be because this Court vastly modified what that Court of Appeals said, because
that was a correction.
THE COURT: Well, the proposal was that it would be modified.

35

MR. BORK: Well ,—
THE COURT: And, secondly, as I understand what they're saying, is not
that HUD makes any county, district or anything do anything, but that HUD
studies it.
MR. BORK: Oh, well, HUD does study it, Mr. Justice Marshall.
THE COURT: Well, that's what they're asking for, to see whether
or not there isn't some relief that HUD could give.
MR. BORK: Well , that's—
THE COURT: Not that HUD must do it.
MR. BORK: I think that's a different lawsuit, Mr. Justice Marshall.
If the question were: Is HUD adequately exercising its discretion under its
statute—
THE COURT: Unh-hunn.
MR. BORK: That would be a totally different statute—lawsuit. This
isn't that lawsuit. This is a constitutional violation in Chicago, with no
allegation that HUD is acting improperly anywhere else, but HUD is to be used
because it has wide jurisdiction as a conduit to take the Chicago violation
out and bring somebody else in for a remedy.
Now, on a remand, I think it's improper because HUD is going to have
to litigate something that I think is improper to begin with. These comm­
unities are going to be required to litigate it. We've got eleven housing
authorities in there who are not even alleged to have done anything wrong.
So that a remand, I think, would be quite wrong. HUD's widespread jurisdiction
was not intended to wip out the local political units that are supposed to
make these decisions for their community.
THE COURT: Well, doesn't HUD consider it as a region, and wipe
out the lines when they consider it?
MR. BORK: No, sir. Mr. Justice Marshall, it does not wipe out the
1ines.

36

THE COURT: You mean that HUD doesn't look at five, six or more
counties surrounding the city,-MR. BORK: Well, HUD may do that.
THE COURT: --and look at it as a unit without regard to district
1ines ?
MR. BORK: HUD looks at it for planning purposes, but-THE COURT: That's what I thought.
MR. BORK: But when it is finished planning, it does not implement a
plan which is inconsistent with the local community's housing assistance plan,
for example. The local community participates politically in this, and has a
number of checks upon this. But what is obviously inevitable here is that in
some form that local autonomy is going to be overriden or bypassed, and we're
going to wind up with effective remedies in towns that have done nothing wrong.
THE COURT: Well, would you think that an injunction against HUD
is generally saying quit cooperating in unconstitutional site selections?
MR. BORK: Well ,—
THE COURT: In the Chicago area.
MR. BORK: No. The order against HUD entered by the District Court,
Mr. Justice White, was a best-efforts order, and HUD is cooperating in the
Chicago area and will use its best efforts-THE COURT: Well, I know, but let's just--I ask you again, what
about that injunction applied to the Chicago housing area as required by law?
MR. BORK: Oh, yes. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. And-THE COURT: Now, just that kind of an order.
MR. BORK: A best-efforts order?
THE COURT: Yes. In the Chicago—in the entire area. Just don't-don't cooperate in any more--whatever you were found guilty of doing in
Chicago, you ought to quit it and quit it in the Chicago housing area.

37

MR. BORK: I don't see the legal predicate for an order against
HUD in the CHicago housing area any more — because it did something wrong
in Chicago; and in-THE COURT: Wouldn't that kind of order presuppose something that
is not in the record in this case? That is, if someone is beating his wife,
and therefore stop beating your wife?
MR. BORK: I think it would, Mr. Chief Justice. In fact, I think
that if, to be consistent;-THE COURT: Well, it's nothing like the--apparently you don't
chal1enge--at least here in this lawsuit--the constitutional violation by
HUD in Chicago. You don't mind being ordered to stop that in Chicago?
MR. BORK: That is quite correct, Mr. Justice White. However, I
certainly would object-THE COURT: But you do mind being ordered to stop violating the
Constitution in the Chicago housing area?
MR. BORK: HUD has not been shown to, and does riot, to the best of
my knowledge, violate the Constitution in any way in the Chicago housing
area, and is not doing it in the City of Chicago.
THE COURT: So your answer is, yes, you do object to it; is that
right?
MR. BORK: I certainly do, Mr. Justice White, and let me explain
why. I would object to it if the request for relief in this case were that
HUD has been found to have acquiesed in the acts of the Chicago Housing
Authority, and therefore, we're going to order HUD to stop it in New York,
Detroit, Los Angeles and San Diego. HUD hasn't done anything like that,
and I think it ought not be subjected to an order which is the equivalent
of that.

THE COURT: Well, if the same people who are operating in the Chicago
housing area, that operate inside Chicago-then we do have an issue posed;
and I guess that's what the lawsuit is all about.
MR. BORK: Well, I must say, Mr. Justice White, that there has been
no showing of a predisposition on the part of HUD to do this. In fact, all
of the courts agreed that HUD opposed what was happening in Chicago-made
some progress in opposing it—but ultimately acquiesced and financed things
they shouldn't have because of the desperate need for housing. And plaintiffs'
affidavits about the kind of housing they were living in before HUD put up
this public housing in Chicago illustrates the desperate need for public
housing, that existed at that time.
THE COURT: What was the basis for the Court od Appeals' remarks
that at least HUD initially thought that a district-wide remedy was a—a
metropolitan remedy—was approriate?
MR. BORK: Well, HUD does think that it ought to work, as its statuatory mandate requires, throughout the metropolitan area. It does not think
it ought to be subject to a court order which is going to change its statutory
mandate throughout that area when it has done nothing wrong in that area.
THE COURT: So you think the Court of Appeals misread whatever
it was that HUD had represented—
MR. BORK: Oh, I think—I think the Court of Appeals did, Mr. Justice
White, and I think respondents' counsel does. HUD keeps saying that it is
important to work in the metropolitan area and that it will do so as its
statute allows. And the statute allows that, encourages that, but it does
place limitations, and there is no reason to destroy those limitations when
nothing wrong has been done in that area.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:45 o'clock, a.m., the argument in the above-
