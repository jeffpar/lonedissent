MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in 74-204, Mathews against Eldridge.
Mr. Solicitor Generalf I think you may proceed when
you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BQRKs

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it please the Courts
We are here on writ of certiorari to the Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.

And the issue we brought up

is the question of whether Social Security disability benefits
can be terminated in a procedure which allows for the submission
of evidence by the claimant; written evidence, but does not
include an oral hearing.
The court

below held that an oral hearing was required

by the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause under aft

extension

of the rationale of Goldberg v. Kelly.
Here, the Secretary of HEW terminated respondent’s
disability payments in 1972, on the basis of medical reports,
and respondent was given a summary of that evidence, given an
opportunity to submit additional evidence and a written
rebuttal.

There were post-termination procedures available

to him, including a full oral evidentiary hearing, which I’ll
describe in a moment, but ha brought this suit instead of

4
availing himself of those procedures, claiming a constitutional
right to a pre~termination oral

hearing ,

1 have two propositions to advances

The first is a

late™blooming jurisdictional issue? and, to be candid about it,
the reason it's late-blooming is because our initial analysis
of the application of Wsinberger v, Salfi, decided last June,
to this ease resulted in a conclusion which we now think
erroneous, that the District Court had jurisdiction here»
We proceeded for some time on that belief, and it was not
until work on other cases required re-thinking of the problem
that we reversed ourselves and came to a contrary conclusion,
that Saifi's rationale precludes the District Court's assertion
in this case,
QUESTION3

I’m asking you to make statements against

interest, but will you, sometime, tell us why — the basis for
your original conclusion?
MR, BOEK%

Well, the basis for the original con-»

elusion was not. my own conclusion,. Mr, Justice Stewart,

But

X believe it was that the constitutional issue might be final
here»

I believe the thinking was that the ~~
QUESTION;

When you’re attacking the very validity

of the very process under which you could proceed?
MR, BORKs

I think that was the reason,

QUESTIONs

But that’s the issue, is whether or not

the very process, the administrative process is a valid —

5
constitutionally valid or not?
MR. BORK%

That is correct? that is correct.

But, coming to the opposite conclusion, wa prepared a
brief on the jurisdictional issue and served typescript, on
respondent’s counsel a weak ago,, and obviously they should
have time to reply in a brief -»•»
QUESTION-:
MR. BORKz
QUESTION s
MR. BORKs

You mean they should now be given time?
That’s correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.
Yes.
To file a brief in response.

QUESTION; Right.
MR. BORK;

I have really very little to add to the

jurisdictional argument made in that supplemental brief.

So I’d

like merely to outline it, and spend most of my time, if I may#
on the duo process question# where I believe there may be
something to add to the brief.
The jurisdictional problem is this;

The relevant

statute is Section 205 of the Social Security Act, codified as
42 U.S.C. 405,and 205(h)# which was involved in Sal.fi as it is
here, states that “no findings of fact or decision of the
Secretary shall be reviewed by any person# tribunal, or
governmental agency except as herein provided.
Now# in Salfi, this Court concluded that 205(h) pre­
cludes the assertion.: of District Court jurisdiction# except
in so far as jurisdiction is then provided in section 205(g).

s
And if we turn to 205(g),» we see that it confers
jurisdiction upon District Courts to review any final decision
of the Secretary mads after a hearing»
Those provisions were not dispositive in Saifi, but
they seem to be here*

In Saifi» the only issue was a

constitutional issue, whether a categorization made by a
*

statute was a constitutional categorization.

So that it would

have been, as the Court said, futile and wasteful to require
the claimant to exhaust the administrative process»

And he

also decided, the Court also said that the Secretary had
decided that the reconsideration decision involved in Salfi was
final.
How, neither of these grounds is present in this
case.

Her® the Secretary did not base his decision on a

statutory provision or a statutory categorisation of eligibility,
which is subject to constitutional attack, but upon a factual
determination that this respondent was, in medical fact, no
longer disabled»

And it would not have bean futile and

wasteful to ask this respondent to exhaust his administrative
remedies, which, as I say, would have included -an oral hearing.
Moreover, the Secretary has not here determined
that the order terminating disability benefits was final»
He was entitled to administrative reconsideration, to an
evidentiary hearing, and so forth»

He availed himself of none

of this, but brought suit before the Secretary had made a final

7
decision after a hearing.
Since 205(g) does not confer jurisdiction under these
circumstances, 205(h) bars the assertion of jurisdiction by
the District Court.
I think that's no mere technicality.

It’s important

to judicial administration, of course, that administrative
remedies be exhausted, even when not required by statute, and
here Congress has specifically mandated the exhaustion of
administrative remedies.
1 should like now to turn to the merits of
respondent’s constitutional claim about due process.
The issue is whether he is entitled, as a matter of
clue process, to a full oral evidentiary hearing before any
benefits paid to him under the disability insurance program
may be stopped.
The considerations to be weighed in making that
decision, of course, are well known, they ware outlined in
Cafeteria Workers v. McSlrqy and stated in a number of latexcases.

What constitutes constitutional due process 4n a

given context depends upon intensely practical considerations
peculiar to that case and -chat process, and a balancing of
the governmental interests and the private interests that are
affected.
We are, in effect, dealing with a cost-benefit
judgment, and, so viewed, the question becomes really how many

8
-- the decision of this case will have a heavy impact upon the
decision of how many decisional processes of government must ba
conformed to a judicial model rather than to an administrative

models
I think that5s important, and I think clearly there
has to be a stopping point somewhere to the imposition of
judicial models upon the governmental decision-making, because
it's very expensive, and in some circumstances *— which I
would contend this is one — adds little or nothing to the
alternative procedures provided»
Now, -*»

MR» BORK:

Yes,

And I suppose it's socially

expensive because,, I think, in this case, for example, if one
were required to continue payments until an oral evidentiary
hearing could bo had, one would pay a lot of money to
beneficiaries who claim the hearing, so that only for the
purpose of keeping "the payments going? but I think that imposes

But? in this case? which involves one of these massive
programs? with thousands and hundreds of thousands of determin­
ations in it? I think we face something not like the ordinary
hearing of due process case? although? of course? this Court
has had cases similar to this before»

But it's crucial here?

I think? to understand the
QUESTION; And what’s the issue before us?
We had reached it or something in some other case?
MR. BORKs

Yes? in Richardson v. Wright? I believe?

Mr. Justice Brennan? although -'dies© are the procedures that
had just been instituted prior to oral argument in Richardson
Vo Wright.
QUESTION;

Yes,

We sent the case back for recon­

sideration in light of new procedures? wasn’t it?
MR. BORKs

That’s correct»

Although I think the

thought was that the claimant there might actually? under the
new procedures, be paid.

And the case would b© mooted by that.

QUESTION; And these are those new procedures?
MR. BORK; These are the new procedures? Mr. Justice
Stewart.
And I think it’s important to see the kinds of
safeguards they provide? and the kinds of results they produc©.
The Act provides that the initial determination? after

10
a man has been qualified# a worker has been qualified for
disability payments# he .is told if there is any possibility of
recovery from his medical disability that he will foe examined
to see if recovery has occurred.

Because if disability ceases#

the payment ceases.
And the Congress has mandated that State agencies be
used for making the initial determination about cessation of
disability.
workers into

And the reason for that is they want to draw these
vocational rehabilitation therapy and training.

And those are primarily the State agencies that are used for
this purpose.
So that a State agency# working under standards and
procedures laid down by the Secretary of Health# Education#
and Welfare# requests the worker to supply information
periodically on a questionnaire# and it shows his present
condition# his medical treatment# medical restrictions placed
upon him# and so forth.
If that questionnaire does not show clearcut
recovery# the State agency then obtains information from the
treating physician of the claimant# it may obtain independent
consulting examinations.

In this case# of course# the initial

determination was made on the basis of a previous medical
record which was in the file.

The respondent’s current answers

to the questionnaire about his condition# the current, report of
his treating physician# and th© report of an independent

11
psychiatric consultant who was called in by the agency»
Now, this material, when it's gathered,

is then

reviewed by a State agency team, which consists of another
physician and a trained disability examiner.

If the worker

is no longer disabled in their opinion, after examining this
record — and I should say that the only issue is one of fact,
a medical ~ the statute requires that disability be proved or
disproved by medical evidence and not by other kinds

of

intuitions, is evidence that is well presented, in other words,
in a written record.
If they decide that the claimant is probably not
disabled, they think he's not, they inform him of that tentative
conclusion, they provide

him with a sumary of the evidence and

they provide ten days for him to respond in

writing, and they

tell him that if he wishes additional time because of the
difficulty of procuring the evidence he needs, he may have it.
They also tell him he can get his questions answered at the
local Social Security office.
Now, her®, as in all other stages of this process,
the worker is entitled to be assisted by counsel or by any
other representative he chooses -- he often is by a union
representative or something, somebody of that sort —* end that
person is entitled to examine all the evidence in the file,
including £he medical evidence.
Respondent here declined to offer any additional

12
evidence,, other than to assert that he didn't have back
sprain, he actually had arthritis of the spine.

Many workers

do offer additional evidence, and often get the initial
determination of "no disability” reversed.
But if the tentative conclusion of the State
examining team is not changed, the report is forwarded to the
Social Security Administration's Bureau of Disability Insurance
where it's reviewed, to make sure that it's in conformity with
rational standards.
If that office thinks that perhaps the decision
should have been favorable to the worker but was not, it has

no legal power to change it, but it may, and does, send the
case back for reconsideration? and I believe about half of
those cases sent back for reconsideration are reconsidered
favorably to the worker.
If, however, the Social Security Administration
accepts the determination of "no disability", it notifies the
worker, in writing, states the basis for its initial

determina

tion and specifies his right to seek further review.

At that

stage, benefits are terminated, although there is a two-month
grace period, after the month in which he ceased to be disabled
That grace period may'sometimes have run by then,
or it may still have some time to run.

That means that a wholly different team of

physician and examiner at the State agency review the record

worker or obtained by the State agency, such as another

There is a reversal rate that’s significant at the

QUESTIONs

Mr, Solicitor General, you referred to

the right of the worker to examine the file. I recall, I
believe, something in the briefs to the effect that the worker
himself could not see the medical evidence in the file, but
his counsel could,
MR, BORIC: That is correct, Mr, Justice Powell.

I

said that his
QUESTION" What is the reason for that distinction?
MR, BORKs

Well, it’s a station in medical practice,

apparently doctors often do not show a patient his own file.
Either because embarrassment might result, or, in some cases.

14
because the doctor is not telling the patient all of the
adverse news that is in that file»
HEW and Social Security, as I understand it, are
now reviewing that practice and asking themselves whether they
should conform to medical practice in that result, or whether
they should allow the claimant as well as his representative —
it doesn't have to be a counsel; his representative -- to look
at the medical evidence,,
QUESTION:

Is this distinction in the regulation?

MR. BORIC?

I believe it is, Mr. Justice Powell,

but I can’t locate it»

does not have counsel does not have access to that- medical

He came straight to court

after the initial determination.
But I just thought it was important to point out what
this process offers, and it should be said that it does offer
an impartial tribunal, it offers a chance to submit evidence?
it offers decision wholly on the record? it offers the kinds of

benefits that were noted in Richardson v. Perales»

That is,

we have independent and unbiased physicians here.

These are

not government physicians»
physician.

On© of them is the respondent's

'We have a very vast system with thousands and

hundreds .of thousands of determination, so that -that makes for
impartiality.
The agency does not. operate an an adversary at any
stage in this process? it operates only as an adjudicator.
So the due process question, I think , then comes
down as looking at this entire,, rather elaborate, procedure
that's available.

There are safeguards at every step.

What would b© gained by moving an evidentiary
hearing up before the initial termination decision, and what
would be lost.

I think vary little would be gained, anci I

think a very great deal would be lost.
The issue is medical condition, which is not an
issue that an Administrative Law Judge gets a great deal of
information about by looking at a man in a room, if, indeed,
the man comes, as he need not.

And, indeed, the decision

cannot rest upon the Administrativo Law Judge's look at the
man end feeling about his condition? it has to rest upon medical
evidence.
Bo -chat fell® probative evidence here is the kind that
can be in writing and can be challenged in writing.

And he

not only has his own doctor, his treating physician, and any

19
consulting doctor that Social Security has asked for, or the
State agency has asked for.

He gets a doctor who reviews the

record of the initial determination period.
Now, 1 think there's no significant likelihood that
any claimant is going to be damaged significantly by the timing
of the hearing.

I8vs been looking at these briefs, and it

seems to me that all of the briefs are a little unrealistic
about what id's® reversal rate is in these cases.

Our brief

suggests that the error rate in the initial determination is
12.2 percent, measured against what happens later,
But I think it's more realistic to look
process, really, at the reconsideration stage.

at this

Because a worker

is terminated and can get reconsideration rather quickly, and
any impact he may feel is really almost de minimis at that stage,
And, in addition to that, the reconsideration stag©
is the same kind of a paper record determination that, occurs
at the initial determination stag©.

So that the reversal rate

from there on to the oral argument, I think, to tha oral hearing,
is the relevant one.

And if you look at that reversal rata,

there were 1,101 workers who succeeded at -the oral hearing,
having lost at the initial stag®, out of about 35,000 termina­
tion decisions.
So that we have an oral hearing that cured mistakes
at a 3.3 reversal rats.

And if you measure that against all

determinations concerning disability made in the system that

20
yearf about 150,000, you get a harmful error rats of seventenths of one percent.
Mow, the worker who receives, who wins at the oral
evidentiary hearing or, indeed, at the reconsideration, but
the worker who wins at the oral evidentiary hearing stage
receives all his back payments.
Now, it would be nice to say, I suppose, that, the
system must be perfect»

Nobody must ever be terminated no

matter how many — how temporarily.

But, indeed, I don’t

think any legal process or any chemical process or any
industrial process aver can afford to remove the last bit of
impurities in that process.

It gets extraordinarily expensive.

Indeed, it begins to defeat the result of the end of the
process,
I can’t put

I can put, rattier, approximate dollar

cost on both sides of this due process equation.
that’s not exactly an inhuman thing to do.

And I think

Because these

claimants are not in the position of the welfare recipients
in Go1dberg v» Ke1ly,

This program is not based upon need.

There may be alternate forms of income in the family or to the
worker.

And, in addition, if -Share is a worker who loses his'

disability

temporarily, he has available State, local, and

other forms of welfare.
So that we’re not «- that, puts a floor under his
income, so we’re not dealing with the kind of stark, human

21
suffering that vas perceived to be the alternative in Goldberg
v, Kelly.*,,
And that means that in tJfis case, 1 'think the dollar
amounts are a real proxy for the interest that go into the
duo process balance»
As 1 said, 11,101 workers won reversal at the
evidentiary hearing in Calendar ’72,
Now, our brief is a little misleading, but the
Appendix is much clearer.

It apparently takes 10 to 11 months

to -get an oral evidentiary hearing after the initial termina­
tion, and part of that time, part of that average time, as is
clear on page 12A of the Appendix to our brief, is waiting for
the worker to ask for an oral evidentiary hearing, since he
has about six months to do so»
But it's 163 days — 163 days is the median time from
request for an oral hearing to decision»
But if we take, say, 11 months, which appears to b@
roughly accurate, as the period of time a worker might be with­
out payment, and there are 1101 workers, it turns out that,
since we're dealing with a stream of payments, so that only
half of the payments are outstanding, that is, the full amount
he ultimately would be due is not outstanding all the time»
It turns out that there must have been total payments
withheld during 1973 that were later said to be due the
worker, $2,028,000.

Or an average of $1842 per claimant.

22

Now, these workers recaptured that money at the end
of the period, so that they didn’t lose it; what they did lose
was the use of the money»

And, as I say, I think it’s —-

it means something to talk about: that, because these people do
have alternative welfare systems or systems that deal with the
needy or alternate forma of income.

They lost the use of the

money, and at 8 percent interest on that stream of monthly
payments means that, for all claimants in that year, about
$162,000 or $147 per worker was lost, «
Now, you. have to measure that, of course, against a
cost to the government,

HEW estimates that putting in full

evidentiary hearings, including -the loss of 23 million

-they

estimate a loss of 23 million in overpayments that can’t be
recovered, soma of them may be recovered, and they estimate
the total cost of the administrative machinery, -the bureaucracy
and the lost payments, to be between $15 million and *$25 million
annually, at current rates.
If we take that, take the median figure there of $20
mill cost annually, in order to save benefits to workers of
163,000, we have a trade-off in costs of 122 to 1, which doesn’t
seam to me to be a terribly good trade-off,

.And it may be low,

because it doesn't really take account, I think, of the full
scope of the incentive to ask for an evidentiary hearing to
keep the benefits flowing.
But I think it doesn't make & great deal of sense, in

23
due process terms, which is an intensely practical subject#

whatever record is to ba mad® is made there, and now let’s
assume he cannot test out the government's case by confronta­
tion of the government's witnesses, or the sources of the
government's information.

Assume he cannot do that.

Neither can he do it at any later time.

Because,

in court, the court is limited to the .record that's made,
MR. BORK: The court is, limited* by the substantial
evidence rule,
QUESTION;
MR, BORK:

Right.

Thanks a lot.

But I think, in no previous due process

caset-that I knew of has there been this kind of a-ratio of
cost-benefit.

In fact, this kind of a disastrous ratio

of cost-benefit.

To briefly hit the jurisdiction question* we do not

The reasons * w© feel this, are as followss
In Salfi* Mrs» Salfi was trying to get a determinai

tion that she was entitled to benefits through the District
Court» In Eldridge* we are not concerned with determination as
to whether or not George Eldridge is entitled to benefits»
Judge Turk, in his District Court opinion, and the government
in their brief* admit that this is not a case determining
whether or not George Eldridge is entitled to benefits•

I also —
QUESTIONs

Now, precisely what order of Judge

Turk’s did they advise you they thought was final?
MR. EARLSs

Judge Turk issued an order requiring

the Secretary to continue disability benefits to George
Eldridga until after he had been afforded an evidentiary
hearing under the standard of Goldberg vs. Kelly.
QUESTION s

This was on the ground that the

procedures did not satisfy the standard of Goldberg?
MR, EARLS:

Wall, twice, when Georg® Kldridge met

before an individual rather than through the mails, twice he
was given benefits by the Secretary’s own representativet
that is, a hearing before — when he had his oral evidentiary

39

hearing before an Administrative Law Judge or a Hearing
Examiner.

Judge Turk had no problem at all of awarding him

benefits until he had received an oral evidentiary hearing.
And 2 think this points out the unfairness of terminating the
benefits prior to an oral evidentiary hearing.
In this particular case., Georg® Eldridg© had his
home foreclosed, ha and his six children were sleeping in
one bed because all of their furniture had been repossessed,
and yet 'the Secretary says in his argument today that there
Is some delay of 160 days from request for- hearing until
i

termination.
By their own figures, in their reply and supplemental
brief, on page 14, their figures show that, indeed, 38 percent
roughly 58 percent, 58.6 percent of those cases that go
before — that, have an evidentiary hearing are reversed.
That means that there are -'58.6 individuals who are
entitled to disability benefits, who have their disability
benefits terminated wrongfully.
Figurewis®, this is 1100.

So, doing a little

subtraction, we have approximately 600 people drawing benefits
"that should not.
Our main contention is that the evidentiary
hearing should be moved up before benefits are terminated.
QUESTIONS

MR, EARLSi

Your Honor, in the case of Underwood vs,

Rlbicofft the Fourth Circuit has held that a main element in
determining benefits is not the objective, cold medical record,
as the Secretary says, but they say that subjective evidence,
such as the claimant*s appearance before the Administrative
Law Judge and the testimony of the claimant, his wife, and
neighbors, as to his ability to work — and on many of these
oasese and George Eldridge is a. very good example, you can
look at him and tell he's disabled,

MR, EARLS? According to their records * after an
initial determination is made* that is accepted by 24*800*
roughly 25*000 of the persons

who had been

drawing

disability payments and are cut off? so it’s accepted roughly
by 25*000 people,

And this is ecplanable.

Youhave 25*000

people who are involved in industrial accidents and, fox' some
reason or another, are drawing disability benefits.

When they

44
recover# or when they're able to go back to work, then they
certainly would not

contest that they may now be gainfully

employed and should be terminated.
Of thesef then you have 8,700 remaining# who may

QUESTION? Well, is there any way of knowing in the

whether the basis for the determination was medical records

MR* EARLS?

Possibly the Secretary could provide

I don’t have those figures «—
QUESTIONs There’s nothing in this record?
MR* EARLSs

Realistically speaking, 1 would say -that

it would be such, as industrial accidents, recovery from
injuries, and this sort, of tiling*
QUESTIONs

But there's nothing in this record that

permits any breakdown?
MR* EARLS?

Ho, Your Honor, there is not.

But w@ do want to point out that George Eldridge
twice went through the adversarial hearing and was twice
awarded benfits after this.
We’re not asking for any great, reshuffling, any
hirings? what we're asking is that the hearing which is
afforded him be moved up prior to the termination of benefits.
We don't think that this is an unreasonable burden* and
certainly, 58 percent of the time, what we*re doing is we're

46

sacrificing 58 percent of the people that are entitled to the
benefit to the 42 percent that are not.
The Secretary has said that disability benefits are
not based upon need.

The statement was afta.de from this stand

today„
I would like to point out, on page 20A of the
government’s petition for a writ of certiorari* their first
sentence in the Secretary’s manual states that most people
who gat a Social Security check depend on it for the necessities
of life.

And this is certainly the case in George Eldridge*

an individual who has paid into such a system* such as
Social Security, must forfeit* in many jurisdictions * or
at least submit to a lien for any welfare benefits which he
;

may drew,
QUESTIONt Well* this manual covers Old Age Pension
and Survivor’s Benefit as well &s disability benefits*
doesn’t it?
MR, EARLS*

Mr, Justice Rehnquist* I think it does,

QUESTION; Then* I take it the statement is a general
one* presumably referring to all aspects of the Social Security
program,
MR, EARLS; Well* the Secretary’s figures point out
that 90 percent of the total beneficiary population earn
nothing. So 1 would say that* as opposed to need — as opposed
to Goldberg vs, Kelly and need* they are indistinguishable.

47
I feel in the George Sldridge case, where Mr.
Eldridge was required to sleep in on© had with five children,
lost his home that hs had worked all of his life for as a
laborer on the railroad., and than as a soda distributor,
driving a truck and carrying in cases of soda pop, then
certainly he lost everything which could not be recouped after
the

in other words, he can't go buy his house back once

it®s been foreclosed, and this is what happened in the George
Eldridge case,
And this is what happens in many of the cases.
In 58 percent of the cases it may happen, because in 58 percent,
of the cases that go to hearing, they are reversed,
QUESTIONS

I take it you*re saying that the house

would not- have been foreclosed had there not been termination?
MR, EARLSs That is true, yes, sir.

He would have

had some money.
QUESTION? Well, would he have enough money?
MR. EARLSs

Wo, sir, he would not hmm had enough

money, enough income of any kind —
QUESTION* So the house would have been foreclosed,
in any event?
MR, EARLSs That's correct, Mr. Justice Blaekmun.
QUESTION5 Than why are you arguing about the six in
a bed?
QUESTION: What's the point of your argument -«*

48
MRc EARLS:

My point is that if he had been continued

on benefits prior to terminating, those benefit payments would
have kept his house payments up.
QUESTIONg But I thought you just said exactly the
opposite.
MR. EARLSs

Perhaps I misunderstood your question?

I’m sorry.
QUESTIONS

My question is:

Would he have lost his

house had the benefits not bean terminated?
MR. EARLS s

No? sir, he would not ha?a„

He would

have had money to make house payments.
QUESTIONS So that the termination was the difference
between keeping his house and not keeping it?
v
