MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 74-1216, Ristaino against Ross.
Miss Smith, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MISS BARBARA A. II. SMITH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MISS SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please;

the Court:
I am Barbara A. H. Smith, Assistant Attorney General
for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

I represent the

petitioners, Theodore Ristaino and Frank Caw

in this case.

The procedural history of this case began i:i June,
1970 when James Ross and two co-defendants were brought to
trial in the Superior Court of Massachusetts upon indictments
charging armed robbery, assault and battery with a dangerous
weapon and assault with intent to murder.
Prior to trial, counsel for the defendant Jsmas Ross,
as well as counsel for the co-defendants, requested that the
trial judge pose certain questions to the prospective jurors
upon voir dire.

One of the seven questions proposed by

counsel for Ross touched upon the issue of possible racial
bias.

The question was, "Are there any of

you who would

believe that a white person is more likely to tell the truth
than a black parson?"
of these questions.

The trial judge declined

to pose any

4
Following trial, at which the defendants did not
testify nor offer a defense, they were convicted»
Q

Were any questions propounded to the prospective

jurors along these lines at all?
MISS SMITH:

A general question as to whether the

jurors were sensible of any bias or prejudice was propounded
to the jurors.

This was coupled with instructions as to the

meaning of the first question to be posed by the trial judge.
That is, the trial judge in this case, as opposed to the Ham
case did not simply say or have the clerk ask the question,
"Are you sensible of any bias or prejudice?"

But in an effort

to focus their attention on what this question meent, he did
explain the instructions as each panel—
Q

Where is that?

MISS SMITH:

That begins on page 12 in my brief,

Your Honor, and on 13 that is set out.

The entire voir dire

procedure is set out in the appendix.
Q

Voir dire in Massachusetts is to the panel and

not to individual members of the panel?

The questions are

put to the panel as a whole?
MISS SMITH:
Q

As a whole, Your Honor.

It is statutory too, I taka it, which came as a

surprise to me, coming from a western state where we will take
a day or two picking a jury.

There are just so many questions

that are put, and they are prescribed in the statute?

5

MISS SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor, and anything additions
*

is left within the discretion of the trial judge.
If I may continue with the procedural history,
following conviction, the Supreme Judicial Court affirmed that
conviction.

Ross then filed a petition for writ of certiorari

in this Court, raising the issue of the refusal of the trial
judge to ask the proposed question.
On January 22, 1373, this Court granted certiorari
and summarily vacated the judgment of conviction and remanded
the case to the Supreme Judicial Court for reconsideration in
light, of Ham v. South Carolina, which this Court had decided
five days previously.
Upon remand, the Supreme Judicial Court addressed
the issue of whether the Ham decision required reversal on the
ground that the trial judge refused to ask prospective jurors
questions concerning possible racial prejudice, and again they
affirmed„
Ross then filed a second petition for writ of
certiorari in this Court, which was denied, with Justices
Marshall, Brennan, and Douglas dissenting.
In January of 1974, Ross filed a petition for writ
of habeas corpus in the Federal District Court, District of
Massachusetts.

In June of 1974, the court ordered that the

writ shall issue, based upon the failure of the trial judge
to ask the proposed questions.

6
The respondent below, Ristaino, appealed to the
First Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed, with Visiting
Judge Moore front the Second Circuit dissenting.
A petition for certiorari on behalf of Ristaino was
then filed in this Court and granted in May of 1975.
The principal issue in this case involves the
conflicting interpretations accorded this Court's decision in
Ham v. South Carolina by the Supreme Judicial Court of
Massachusetts and the Federal District Court and the First
Circuit Court of Appeals.
These interpretations involve the scope and the
applicability of the Ham decision and the resulting retroactive
or prospective application to be accorded that decision, given
in fact the Federal Court's interpretation is correct
On remand, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts
considered this case in the light of the Ham decision and held
as to the scope of the Ham decision, ‘'We do not believe that the
Ham case announced a new broad constitutional principle
requiring that questions designed to discover possible racial
prejudice be put to prospective jurors in all state criminal
trials when the defendant is black.

Such questions are

constitutionally required only when the defendant is a special
target for racial prejudice."
As to complying with fundamental fairness, the Court
found that, the judge's questions and the instructions to the

7
prospective jurors were, under the circumstances of the Ross
cose, commensurate with Fourteenth Amendment requirements.
However, the Federal District Court held that the
petitioner Ross had a constitutional right to

have th@ issue

of racial prejudice specifically called to the attention of the
prospective jurors under voir dire examination and on that
basis ordered that the writ issue.
The First Circuit held in substance that whore the
defendant is black and charged with a violent crime against a
white—in this particular case, a security officer—failure to
ask specific questions is error of constitutional dimension
requiring the release of a convicted defendant.
The petitioners submit that the Supreme Judicial
Court's interpretation of the scops of Ham is correct for the
following reasons.
In Ham this Court was presented with a very novel
fact pattern.
activist.

Gene Ham was a young bearded black civil rights

He was well known in the community of Florence,

South Carolina, and he was well known for his civil rights
activities.

His sole defense was that he had been framed and

that law eh prcement officers were out to get him because of
his civil rights activities.

Thus, the Court was presented a

case in which race was a consideration, in which the
credibility of the black defendant was directly pitted against
the white law enforcement officers who he maintained were out to

8

get him in Framingham.
Within this factual framework, the trial ju3ge in
Ham refused to pose the questions requested, nor did he give
instructions as to the meaning of the general question as to
bias or prejudice.
The majority opinion in Ham utilized very specific
language.

This Court held in this case, under the facts shown

by this record, due process of the Fourteenth Amendment
required this defendant be permitted to have the jurors
interrogated on the issue of racial bias.
The petitioner suggests that this language as not to
be dismissed as mere common judicial locutions, as did the
Federal District Court, but this Court meant exactly v?hat it
said, that the Court traditionally uses such words of limita­
tion when they are rendering a decision which is required by
the particular fact pattern presented to them, when they are
rendering a decision solely within the confines of the due
process clause and fundamental fairness.
We would suggest that this Court neither held nor
suggested that the Constitution conferred a right in tsvery
case to have the

specific question addressed to possible

racial prejudice put to prospectiva jurors.
We further suggest that by basing its decision on the
Fourteenth Amendment rather than the Sixth Amendment right to an
impartial jury, as urged by petitioner Ham in his petition for

9

certiorari and in a brief to this Court, that the Court
indicated its intention to limit its decision to cases
involving special circumstances as with the case in Haro..
Finally, we would suggest that this Court's action on
Ross's initial petition for writ of certiorari indicates
that its rule in Ham was in fact limited to a particular fact
pattern and that no new per se constitutional rule was
therein announced, but this Court vacated the Ross decision
and remanded, it did not reverse outright.

And we would

suggest that the vacation was made so that the Supremo
Judicial Court could consider the fact pattern in Ross
within light of Ham.
The petitioners therefore suggest that the scope of
the Ham decision is limited to those cases involving
circumstances where the probability of prejudice is of
sufficient dimension to require a deviation from the normal
voir dire procedure which is traditionally left within the
discretion of the trial judge.
We would suggest that the voir dire procedure
employed in this cas® complied with fundamental fairness as
required by the due process clause.
In course of the discussion between counsel and the
trial judge as to whether these questions would be asked, the
trial judge asked counsel for a co-defendant whether there was
anything peculiar to the circumstances of this case.

The

10
response was no, just that the
defendants are black.

victim is whate and the

Counsel for Ross brought no peculiar

or special circumstances to the attention of the trial judge.
Further, th© trial judge indicated he would give
preliminary instructions on the meaning of the first question
to b@ asked by the clerk.

In substance, that instruction

was that each of the jurors must remember they were under oath,
that they had an absolute duty to render a

fair and impartial

verdict based upon the evidence they heard in the courtroom,
not on any extraneous factors, no bias or prejudice of any
kind? that the clerk in asking the first question would be
giving them an opportunity to inform the court if you cannot
or if you have serious doubt that you can render a. fair and
impartial verdict.

He directed them to examine all aspects of

the case, quoting, "everything you know about th© case both in
the courtroom and from what I hava said.

If you have any

doubt, you have the duty to inform the court by standing or
raising your hand.*
The defendants ware then asked to stand.

Sc, clearly

the jurors were aware that they were in fact black.
In fact, a number of jurors did raise their hands
and indicate their inability to render a fair and impartial
jury.

One for admitted racial prejudice, two for general

prejudice, seven for a previously formed opinion, seven because
of their relationship with law enforcement authorities, and one

11
because of employment at the university where the crime
allegedly occurred.
Q

Miss Smith, what does general prejudice mean?

Is that a term under Massachusetts law?
MISS SMITH:
Q

General prejudice?

Yes.

MISS SMITH:

The question is, Are you conscious of

any bias or prejudice?—not general.
Q

And then the juror raises his hand?

MISS SMITH:

And

approaches the bench and states to

the judge the reason he feels that he could not render an
impartial verdict.
Q

In the case of one juror we know he said he was

racially prejudiced.

Do we have any indication of what those

whom you described as being excused fox* general prejudice said?
MISS SMITH:

No, Your Honor, the language was vague—

just that "I know enough about this case, I could not render
an impartial verdict," something to that effect.
Q

I suppose it might mean that he had a prejudice

against people who were charged with killing or assaulting a
policeman.

That could be one of the general, I suppose.
MISS SMITH:
Q

Yes, Your Honor, I think that would be.

Did this offense get a great deal of publicity?

MISS SMITH:

There was no allegation in this case of

any extensive -pre-trial publicity

and nothing in the record

12
indicates that it was an extraordinary case in any way.
In one further dffort

to keep the element of

racial prejudice from the jurors the trial judge declined to
use the Muslim names of the two co-defendants of James Ross.
Therefor®, I submit that the procedure employed in
this case complied with fundamental fairness, that Ham requiras
that nothing more than that the jurors' attention is focused
on the possibility of bias or prejudice.
Therefore, if the voir dire proceeding complied with
fundamental fairness, the court below erred in vacating the
state conviction absent a demonstration of actual likelihood
of prejudice flowing from the trial judges refusal to ask the
proposed questions.

This case came in the federal court on

collateral reviev/ of a state court conviction pursuant to a
petition for writ of habeas corpus.

Therefore, the actual

likelihood of prejudice must be demonstrated.

Those cases

which have held to the contrary, I would suggest, involved in
every instance circumstances which were such as to create a
serious probability of unfairness.

In the instant case no such

circumstances have been demonstrated, and the petitioners
submit that it v/as error for the federal court to void the
state conviction merely upon speculation or the mere possibility
of prejudice flowing from the refusal to ask just one question.
If, however, the Fam case did enunciate a new broad
constitutional mandate or per se rule requiring that questions

13

specifically addressed to racial prejudice be posed in every
instance in which the defendant is black, the question of the
prospective or retrospective application to be accorded that
rule roust be answered.

We submit that the First Circuit's

resolution of this question is without support.
As I stated earlier, the First Circuit held that
by vacating and remanding the Ross case for reconsideration
this Court impliedly held the rule of Ham to be retroactive.
i*

We suggest that the only inference to be drawn from this
Court8s action is that Ham was limited to its facts and would
require a case~by--ea.se examination based on the particularfactual pattern involved.
Q

Miss Smith, You kind of try to have both pieces

of the cake there, do you not, because earlier you say that
by vacating and not reversing we indicated that we did not
think this was directly applicable, and yet now you say that
because we vacated, a kind of inconsistent consequence Follows
or that the First Circuit's view of an inconsistent consequence
£ollcx*/s.
MISS SMITH:

I believe that is consistent with what

I said before. Your Honor.

This Court’s action in vacating

indicates that it was limited to a particular fact pattern.
The First Circuit inferred that, one, the Court had
enunciated an across-the-board per se rule and by vacating
held this new rule to be retroactive.

14
Q

I would suggest there is a possibility perhaps

that is embraced neither by your view nor that of the First
Circuit, and that is that when we have these holes, we just
frequently vacate without quite that much fine tuning as to
the result,
MISS SMITH:

Under that circumstance, then. Your

Honor, I would still say there is little support for the
First Circuit's determination that you were making a ruling on
retroactivity
Q

by your action on the first petition.
In any event, what we did then foreclosed you

from acting, that Ham should only be prospective.
MISS SMITH:

That is right, Your Honor,that is my

position.
Q

Sometimes we have vacated and remanded so that

the lower court may first address the retroactivity question.
MISS SMITH:
Q

Yes, Your Honor, but I think in this—

Without our having decided it one way or

another.
MISS SMITH:

That is true, Your Honor.

If there is a new rule announced in .this case, 1
would submit that it is a procedural rule only, that it is not
a rule designed to guarantee the defendant a specifically
enumerated constitutional right, that it was not a rule
based on

the Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury but

it is designed only to expand the voir dire procedure which

15
i3 not in itself constitutionally required.
Therefore, we submit there is no basis for granting
more extensive application to a rule enunciated in Han, if in
fact th® rule was so enunciated, than given to those decisions
which did in fact rest upon the Sixth Amendment right to an
impartial jury, and therefore that the decision on this
question falls within the cases of DeStsfano v. Woods, holding
Duncan v. Louisiana and Bloom v. IIlinois,granting the right to
jury trial and the right to jury ferial in serious criminal
contempts, to be prospective only, and Dania1 v. Louisiana,
holding that Taylor v. Louisiana was not to be applied
retroactively to convictions obtained by jurors empaneled prior
to th© date of that decision.
In th® first instance, we suggest that the purpose
behind the Taylor rule and th© Duncan rule goes no further
than th© rule announced in Ham.

In Taylor th© Court stated

its purpose was to prevent arbitrariness and repression on the
part of the prosecution.

There is no greater purpose founded

for the rule in the Ham case.
Second, the reliance factor is equally as great as in
the above-cited cases.
found in Aldridge

The sole precursor of this rule is

v. United States , which was decider! solely

within this Court's jurisdiction over the lower federal courts
over 44 years ago.

Sine© that time there has bean no indication

that the Constitution mandated the interjection of th© racial

16
prejudice issue into a procedure traditionally resting within
the discretion of the trial judge.
Q

What has been

the attitude of the Supreme

Judicial Court of Massachusetts in treating voir dire?

Does it

encourages trial judges to go outside of the statutory questions
or does it leave it completely up to their discretion?
MISS SMITH:

Since these cases have arisen, it has

indicated to the courts that the better practice is to allow
the question to be put if the defendant so requests.
Q

How about before that for purposes of retro-

activity analysis?
MISS SMITH:

Before that it was traditionally very

limited to the three specified questions that are set oat in
my brief,, that it was a very rare instance when the trial
judge went outside of that and

then only when shown that a

particular circumstance involved in the case required that
these questions be asked.
Q

Where are these three statutory questions set

out?
MISS SMITH:

They are set out at page 12 of my

interest in the case or has expressed or formed an opinion or

Q

In footnote four there.

MISS SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor.

17
Q

How about footnote five on the next page?

MISS SMITH:

That is an additional question that the

trial judge did agree to put in this case at the request of
counsel because the victim had been a white security guard.

He

did agree to ask the jurors if they were involved with law
enforcement authorities.
Q

So that in this case was a non-statutory

additional question.
MISS SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor, because of the

circumstances of having a quasi-law enforcement official
being victim.
Q

Right.

MISS SMITH:

Does the clerk ask thesequest:.ons?
The clerk asks the questions,

yes,

Your Honor.
Q

Not the judge?

MISS SMITH:

And never counsel?

No, Your Honor.

No, never, to my knowledge.

hand and comes up to the bench for a bench conference.

Q

Do any judges ever ask the questions themselves

or do they always have the clerk do it, do you know?
MISS SMITH:

To my knowledge, it is always the

clerk who does it,
Q

Are the panels very large or does that differ?

MISS SMITH:

That differs.

In this case, some of the

panels were rather small because there were at least, I believe
five panels questioned.

I suppose a judge would not be violating the

statute if he put the questions himself, would he?
MISS SMITH:

No, I do not believe he would, Your

Honor.
Q

How long had this group served as jurors?

Does the record show that?
MISS SMITH:

It shows that some of the jurors had

sat on previous cases.
Q

Yes, I thought so.

MISS SMITH:

And in a number of instances they were

then excused because they had been locked up and it was a
lock-up situation in this case.

I cannot say definitely how

long.
Q

Do you know what the term for petit jurors is

in Massachusetts or in this county?
MISS SMITH:

Your Honor, I do not know in this

county what the term is.

19

I would just like to make one other point, and that
is the effect that a retroactive application would have would
be substantial on the administration of justice in the
Commonwealth, and in fact the Chief Justice himself has stated
in the case of Commonwealth v. Lumley that it would be
calamitous indeed.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. West.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL G. WEST, J.D.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. WEST:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
My name is

Michael West, and by appointment of this

Court X represent the respondent, James Ross, Jr., in these
proceedings.
If I may before formal argument, there are two
misprints in my brief, and I would like to bring those to the
attention of the Court.

The first is on page 4 under the

statement of the case, where it indicates that James Ross was
convicted and received terms, it says, of 18 to 20 years in
the state prison.

It actually was 18 to 30 years.

And, lastly, on page 42, the second line; it refers
to Chapter 234, Section 228.
Q

It is actually Section 28.

I do not have a 41 or 42 of your brief

anybody else have that problem?

printer, so far as I am aware.

The Government simply
It is not the Court's

It does not have the capability

of printing this material.
MR. WEST:

Since apparently it is this Court's

practice, when presented with a case dealing with both
retroactivity and the application of a constitutional
principle, to deal with the retroactivity issue first, I shall
do that in my argument dealing with the retrospective
application of Kara v. South Carolina to the Ross situation.
The test as stated by counsel for the Commonwealth
is found in Stovall v. Denno, and that sets out a three-pronged
test, setting out the purpose to be served by the new
standards, the effect

upon the reliance of the old standards,

and the effect upon the administration of justice.
I believe this test was further clarified in Desist
v. United States in that of the three-pronged test, the first
prong—and that is the purpose to be served by the new rule—is to be given foremost importance.
And then in Williams v. United States this Court sale,
that if the major purpose of the constitutional rule goes to
the truth-finding function and substantially affects the
accuracy of the guilty verdicts, them would the rule be given

21

completely retroactive application without regard to the
effect on the administration of justice or the good faith
reliance by the court below.
It is interesting to note that the issue of
retroactivity of Ham was never raised by the Commonwealth in
either the second Supreme Judicial Court case after remand by
this Court or by the First Circuit in the First Circuit Court
of Appeals

or in the United States District Court for the

District of Massachusetts based on petition for habeas corpus.
It was raised in fch© First Circuit only as an aside and never
briefed by the Commonwealth.

I think what this indicates is

that the Commonwealth/ first of all/ assumed retroactivity of
the Ham case and, second, I think it dilutes their claim of
the calamitous effect on the administration of justice; because
that issue was never raised, never briefed, in any of the court
except this one.
In fact, the Supreme Judicial Court for the
Commonwealth in the recant case of Commonwealth, v. Lum.ley
states that they believe the limited rule announced by Ham is
to be given complete; retroactive application.

Ross believes

that the denial of the impartial jury or even the likelihood of
an impartial jury or the denial of an impartial jury goes to
the heart of the truth-finding function and so affects the
accuracy of guilty verdicts that Ham should be given complete
retrospective application.

22

The Commonwealth relies on two cases in this regard,
One is Daniel
Woods

to

v, Louisiana and the second is DeStefano v.

establish the argument that Ham is not to be given
#

retrospective application.
The question presented in Daniel was the retrospective
application of Taylor v, Louisiana.

This Court denied

retroactive application of Taylor, saying that until Taylor
no case has held that the exclusion of women from a jury
deprived a defendant of the Sixth Amendment right to an impartial
trial.

That is not true hare.

There was no previous case.

This Court said that reliance on past decisions of this Court
such as Hoyt v» Florida, precluded retroactive application.
Her® there is no previous decision to the contrary.
In fact, the previous decision to Ham, Aldridge v.
Unit€sd States, is supportive of the Ross claim.
You also said in Taylor that the substantial
impact on the administration of justice would cause enormous
burdens for the stats.

The Commonwealth in its brief on page 9

says that "Therefore, the retroactive application of the Ham
case would require reversal of every case in the Commonwealth
involving a defendant who is a member of the minority class."
That is just not correct.
In this regard, the

First Circuit decision in Ross

is much narrower than the Commonwealth asserts.

Third, it only applies to

Fourth, it. only provides for an application where

the judge or the court asks questions, not where counsel does.
It is ray research that affects approximately 17 states.

And

only when the defendant's counsel has submitted a question as
to racial prejudice and the
Q

court has denied that question.

And only when the victim is white or of a

different race

from the defendant?

MR. WEST:

It does not say that, but certainly that

is the Ross case, and only of a violent crime.

What about a witness being black, say, in a white

community or being white in a largely black community?

The only witness against Ross was not

He was only a.

white gas station attendant who was the witness against Ross.
And so I think the First Circuit decision would certainly
apply in that circumstance.
Q

What if you have though, say, a white defendant

in a largely white community but the white defendant proposes
to call a black witness?
MR. WEST:

I think that would still apply, Your Honor.

I think decisions of your Court have indicated that the color
of the petitioner does not affect the decision whether to allow
or not allow the questions to be asked or a challenge to the

24
jury.
Q

If it is an absolute rule, as you suggest, then

it is not just limited to cases of black defendants.
MR. WEST:

You are right, Your Honor.

But It would

certainly be limited to, at least the First Circuit, to violent
crime.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there at

Mr. West.
