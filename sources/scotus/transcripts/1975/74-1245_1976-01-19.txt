LRC££!iEL£!i§MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in No. 74-1245, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company
against Sandra Wetzel et al.
Mr. Grove, I think you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KALVIN M. GROVE, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. GROVE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case comes to you today on review from the
United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit which,
reviewing Liberty Mutual Insurance Company's disability
program for its employees determined that that plan
violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of .1964.
I think it is important for this Court to know
just exactly what that plan is and what they provide.
First of all, besides excluding from coverage
disability due to pregnancy and complications from
pregnancy, that plan has numerous other exclusions.
It does not cover disabilities due to selfinflicted wounds.

It does not cover disabilities unless

the employee is under the care of a licensed physician.
does not cover acts of suicide.

It does not

It

cover acts

which are the cause of declared or undeclared war and it does

4
not cover emotional disorders, alcoholism or narcotics or
drug addiction unless, again, the employee is under the care
of a licensed physician.
The plan provides that contributions are made
by the employees, no matter what their sex, in equal amounts
and Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, in turn, contributes
to the plan equally no matter what the person's sex is.
The Third Circuit held that this Court's
decision in Geduldig versus Aiello was not applicable
because of the fact that that case arose under the 14th
Amendment and that this case arises under Title VII.
We submit to this Court that the Court’s
reasoning in Aiello is directly in line with Title VII and
there is no reason why that thinking should not be applied
to a Title VII case.
The question is, is it discrimination?

Wo matter

what the standard is, that is the question that has to be
determined and this Court in a similar situation, in fact,
the California Disability Plan is very similar to the
Liberty Plan, held that absent a showing that the exclusion
of a risk was, for a pretext to engage in invidious
discrimination, you could do such.
And Liberty Mutual here, because of valid and
cogent reasons, has cited to exclude certain disabilities
under its plan and I submit to this Court that under your

thinking, that is not discrimination based on sex.
The Court of Appeals said that you could not
apply Aiello because of the fact, again, as I repeated, that
is a 14th Amendment case and Title VII cannot apply.

I

suggest that that is improper and should not be the holding.
This Court specifically, in response to, I
believe, Mr. Justice Brennan8s dissent and Mr. Justice
Marshall's dissent, in a footnote indicated that the policy
was lawful and it seems to me that if this Court is going to
review Aiello, then Aiello should be affirmed and the Court
should say that that case is applicable to Title VII.
QUESTION:

Well, you wouldn’t suggest that

Congress couldn't go further in prohibiting employment
practices than the 14th Amendment if it so
MR. GROVE:
Congress so chose.

chose, would you?

I agree with that statement, if

But we submit that Congress did not so

choose«
If Aiello is not applied, you are going to have a
result of, at least in those states, where the state is the
carrier, such as California and other states, the insurance
carrier where the state, under the umbrella of Aiello will
not need to provide this benefit, but the state as an
employer would have to provide the benefit to its employees.
You are going to have one standard for the state
as insurance carrier and another standard for the state as

6

an employer and to me that result is not what Title VII or
the 14th Amendment is supposed to accomplish.

I think that

we, as practitioners in this area, are looking for some
guidance from the courts because there are, as you know by
the numerous briefs that have been filed in this case, the
parties are squarely on one side or the other.
Everyone is citing that the 14th Amendment says
that you didn't mean what you said and therefore you need to
come up with a new standard and the other side, the Liberty
side, if you will, says that what you meant is exactly
applicable to Title VII and I don't think that we should
have different standards for the determination of what is
discrimination.
The Court of Appeals, after summarily dismissing
Aiello with one very quick, brief sentence, then went on and
said that because of three things, number one, that because
the EEOC has come down with guidelines which indicate that
this policy is violated and since they have some expertise
in the area, the Court should defer to them.
1 suggest in this situation that the EEOC
guidelines, as in Espinosa, should not be given deference to.
For, as the Court is well-aware and it is stated
xn the briefs 3 from 1965 when Title VII became applicable
until after this lawsuit was filed, the Commission was on
record as stating that a policy such as Liberty Mutual was

7

not in violation of Title VII and absent any hearings,
requests from experts if you will, requests for interested
employer associations or anyone else, the EEOC all of a
sudden

came down and changed its position but yet in the

Aiello case before you, the EEOC's amicus brief clearly
indicated that what you were going to hold in Aiello could
be dispositive of Title VII cases.
Of course, now the EEOC comes down with their
guidelines and says just exactly the opposite and I suggest
that they should not be. entitled to the deference normally
granted to an agency because you have a shifting sands
situation here and they are no more expert in this situation
than, I submit, this Court.
The Third Circuit then went on to say that
because Liberty Mutual has so many coverages under its
policy that it is unreasonable for it to exclude pregnancy
and disabilities due to pregnancy, therefore, they cannot
sustain that exclusion and I respectfully submit that I
think the Third Circuit read the plan wrong because, as I
have just read to you, the plan does have numerous situations
where disabilities are excluded.
QUESTION:

Mr. Grove, how old is the plan, the

insurance plan?
MR. GROVE:

I don’t know exactly, your Honor.

would say at least it is prior to 1972 — prior to the

8

guidelines issued -—
QUESTION:

Has it always had the exclusions and

exemptions in it that it now has?
MR. GROVE:
QUESTION:
MR. GROVE:
as far as I know.

Yes, it has, always.
Have there been any changes?
No, there have not been any changes

If there were changes, and I submit I do

not know, they were to include more as opposed to taking out
some — more disabilities would be included as being excluded
from the plan's coverage.
QUESTION:

Has there been that evolution, do

you know?
MR. GROVE:
know.

I can't respond.

I really don't

I think there have been but I am unfamiliar with —

over the years the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company has been
in business for, I can’t tell you how many years and I am
sure that over the years there have been some changes but I
am frankly unfamiliar with all of them.
QUESTION:

Is there any legislative history, so

to speak, and any explanation in the record anywhere as to
these — I don't mean now — post-hoc explanation or
rationalization — but any historic explanation for the
exclusions and exemptions in this plan?
MR. GROVE:

No, there it not.

It was just this

plan that was litigated and there was no attempt by either

9
side, if you will, to go back into history to determine those
questions.
Lastly, the Court of Appeals indicated that the
proper standard to determine this case, again, was not
t

Aiello but Griggs versus Puke Power and we submit that under
Griggs versus Duke Power, you don’t have a violation in this
type of situation.
You must remember that all women and all men at
Liberty Mutual Insurance Company under this plan receive
exactly the same contribution from the company.

They make

the same contribution and the benefits to all are exactly
the same.

For every disability that a man may have, a woman

has the same coverage under the plan and I submit to this
Court that there are rational basises for Liberty Mutual’s
plan, and the record so indicates.
First of all, as long as there is no evidence
that the plan was instituted or the exclusion was instituted
as a pretext to engage in invidious discrimination, any
employer is free to exclude whatever he wants from the
disability plan.
I submit to you that this record does not sustain
a showing that Liberty Mutual Insurance Company engaged in
a pretext or excluded maternity in a pretext to engage in
invidious discrimination.
The plan is such so that the Liberty Mutual

10

Insurance Company can pay to its employees the maximum
benefits.

The company has determined, based upon statistics

that it had, that if it. was to cover the disability of
maternity and complications due to maternity, that that would
be the greatest number of claims, it would be the greatest
drain on the plan and therefore, it felt that it would
either have to revise its plan, it would have to contribute
more, require the employees to contribute more and therefore,
it did not desire to do such and that is exactly what this
Court discussed in Aiello; that is exactly the same thing
that the State of California was desirous of maintaining the
integrity and sanctity of its plan and the state felt in its
wisdom that it covered the disability and in Aiello it was
normal pregnancy, it could distort the plan and said that
that was perfectly legitimate.
QUESTION:

Mr. Grove, sometime during your

argument, would you comment on why you think the District
Court’s order was appealable to the Third Circuit?

As I

read the complaint, the Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief.
They sought damages.

The District Court gave them neither

but nonetheless said it was entering a final judgment and the
Third Circuit said, "We have jurisdiction under 1291."
Now, certainly in a personal injury action, if
the Plaintiff sues and gets a judgment on liability and the
District Court says, "This is a final judgment," the

11
defendant can't appeal that without certification and it
strikes me that this is somewhat the same.
MR. GROVE:

Well, I think what the district court

did in this instance, your Honor, is that it split the
issue of liability and remedy and determined liability and
then said that there is no reason to delay an appeal in this
situation under the rules, which he had the right to do and
then submitted it to the Third Circuit, which took it under
that situation.
QUESTION:

Well, what authority do you have for

the proposition that a judgment on liability only separated
from remedy is, indeed, a final judgment?
MR. GROVE:

Well, I can't give you any authority

right now but in my knowledge this is a very common situation
that occurs in the trial courts.

Many of the cases -- in

fact, Title VII is the exact situation where it is being
practiced

heavily, where the judges are splitting the issue

of liability and damages, only hearing the matter of liability
because determining damages in these cases, as you know, is
extremely complicated and the courts are issuing determin­
ations on liability, letting those go to the court of appeals
and than coming back„
QUESTION:

Well, but they can let them go only

if Congress has permitted them to go, I take it —
MR. GROVE:

Yes.

12
QUESTION:

-- and if you

can't do it in a per­

sonal injury action, why can you do it under Title VII?
MR. GROVE:

I don’t have a good answer for you.

All I am suggesting is that it happened.

The judge indicated

that there was no reason to delay an appeal in this situation
and it happened.
I do not think, again, to repeat myself, I do
not think that there is any reason why this Court needs to
tamper with its prior ruling in Geduldig versus Aiello and I
do not think that there is any reason why this Court needs
to say that there is a different standard to Title VII cases
than there are for the 14th Amendment.
QUESTION:

Mr. Grove, you make reference to the

prior position of the EEOC as having changed and I couldn’t
find it in your brief, maybe it is.

Did the prior opinions

of the EEOC indicate that they were based on the ground that
there was no discrimination in the first instance, no sex
discrimination or, alternatively, were they based more or
less on the ground that it might have been discrimination
but it was justified?
MR. GROVE:

The second, the way I read the

guidelines.
QUESTION:

Of course, your argument in this case

realized just on the first proposition.
MR. GROVE:

That is right, that there is an

13
absence in this record that shows that Liberty Mutual
excluded the disability that we are talking about as a
pretext to engage in invidious discrimination,
QUESTION:

So, really, the prior EECC history is

quite irrelevant to the issue you present to us,
MR, GROVE:

Well, I suggest it is, except for

the fact that all employers during the first seven years of
Title VII relied upon that and then all of a sudden, lawsuits
like this came along where the Commission then switched their
position and came along with the Plaintiffs, as in this case,
to try to substantiate their guidelines,
I would like to reserve the balance of my time
for rebuttal,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr, Grove,

Mr. Specter,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD A. SPECTER, ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR, SPECTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
My name is Howard Specter,

I have the privilege

of representing the Respondents, Mrs. Wetzel and Mrs. Ross
in the matter now before the Court.
It was not my intention to track in any way the
arguments made by or on behalf of the Petitioner but it. may
be that I can answer to some extent at least one of the

14

questions posed by the Court,
Mr, Justice Stewart asked a question concerning
the age of the plan here in question and whether any
explanations for the evolution of the plan and the exclusions
was ever given below.
Contained in the joint Appendix are a series of
exhibits.

They

begin at page 90.

They were exhibits to

the Plaintiffs5 brief for summary judgment below and they
were made part of the record by affidavit.

The affidavit

which describes them begins at page 86 and reveals that the
exclusion with which we are concerned was in existence at
least as early as March, 1964.
The subsequent exhibits deal with later changes
in the plan but to the extent that there were changes, those
changes generally didn't relate to changes in coverage but
rather to
QUESTION:

Waiting periods and things like that?

MR. SPECTER:

Changes in premiums, primarily and

things like that.
Now, in addition, to the extent that Mr. Grove
talks about the fact that there are other exclusions in the
plan and has described those exclusions, it is imperative to
note that many of the exclusions to which he made reference
are nowhere in the record below.
The plan which he has described is the plan which

15
is annexed as an appendix to the Petitioner's brief.

It is

a plan which was never made part of the record in the
district court or the court of appeals and which as far as
anyone in this case knows, was never in existence until the
day that I saw their brief for the first time.
With respect to the contention that the plan
also excludes coverage for complications due to pregnancy,
some clarification is in order.
The court of appeals did indeed state that the
plan excluded complications and of course, that wasn't the
case in Aiello, where only normal pregnancy was involved.
.1 think it is a bit. unfair for the court of
appeals, however, to state —- as did the Petitioner in its
brief — that it misconstrued the plan by assuming that there
was no coverage for complications.

There is on file with

this Court a transcript of the argument whxch was held
before the court of appeals in October of 1973 or '74<

I

have forgotten which at this points where there was a
colloquy between various members of the court and Mr. Grove,
who argued for the Petitioner and after repeated questions
in which Mr. Grove acknowledged that complications were not
covered and where they discussed specific complications such
as hypertension, blood poisoning, and others, the Court
asked, "But it is clearly understood —and this is at
page 5 of the transcript, "But it is clearly understood that

16

if we have a normal pregnancy or a pregnancy with compli­
cations, neither ax“e covered?"
And the response was, "That is correct.

Under

ray client's policy that is in issue here today."
QUESTION:

Now, that, you say, was colloquy in

the Court of Appeals?
MR. SPECTER:

Yes, sir.

Nov/, in enacting Title VII as part of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, Congress had several objectives and of
course there was the objective of guaranteeing equal
employment opportunity without regard to sex; to guaran­
teeing also, in the employment context, the preservation of
the individual employee's dignity as a person, as an employee,
without regard to sex, among other criteria and the objective
of maximizing the utilization of the human resources of
this country by not discriminating on the basis of sex or
otherwise.
And I don't think it takes prolonged argument
to demonstrate the extent to which this Court, in recent
opinions, has recognized the evolution of women's role in
American commerce since Mr. Justice Bradley wrote in Bradwell
versus 11 ■!inois that«£n the divine nature of things, vromen
are unfit to engage in the ordinary occupations of civil life."
This Court has long since recognized that those
days are over.

17
Notwithstanding the Petitioner's longstanding
practice of segregating job classifications by sex, as the
trial and appellate courts found that it did in this case, 1
expect that very few people would suggest today that men and
women are not similarly situated in the employment context
and that women are not able to hold virtually every job that
men are, with the possible exception of the narrow, bona fide
occupational qualification test which is specifically set
forth in the statute and which was not raised here.
Now, even though they are similarly situated in
the employment context, of course it is fundamental that
men and women are, in many ways, different — as, indeed,
they must be.
And perhaps the most fundamental difference lies
in the fact that only women can become pregnant and when they
do, to one extent or another, and for one period of time or
another, they become disabled and men don't get px’egnant and
to that extent they are different.
But so long as employers, like the Petitioner
in this case, are permitted to fire employees — women
employees simply because they are pregnant without regard to
disability and so long as they are permitted to impose
mandatory unpaid leaves of absence without regard to ability
to work, just because they are pregnant, and so long as
practices like the one involved here, where comprehensive

18
income protection benefits are provided for virtually every
disability to which a man can be subjected end none for the
one disability unique to the woman, then those guarantees
that Title VII was intended to protect, of equal employment
opportunity and human dignity are, in fact, unachievable
today.
I think Mr. Grove accurately stated the question
as,did Congress intend to go that far?
I think it should be pointed out that there are
any number of aids to statutory construction in dealing with
the precise issues here today.
It would require a remarkable lack of candor on
my part, however, if I were to argue that the specific
legislative history dealing with the addition of the word
"sex" to Title VII was very enlightening in and of itself.
It is clearly not.
But it must be remembered that one year before
the enactment of Title VII, the same Congress,'the 88th
Congress, enacted the Equal Pay Act and there is copious
legislative history concerning the Equal Pay Act and copious
legislative history involving the practice which is in
question here because the opponents of the Act went to
Congress, as they are now coming to this Court, and took
the position that because it costs a certain amount of money
to employ women because they become pregnant and disabled

19
and disability benefits sometimes have to be provided and,
in fact, they were provided to most women, that employers
should be permitted to pay women less.

They should be

permitted to take into account the fact of pregnancy and the
cost of pregnancy-related disabilities in order to pay them
less.
The legislative history — and, in fact, a bill
and an amendment were introduced which would have provided
just that and they were rejected.
There is an extensive treatment of that legisla­
tive history and I won’t

dwell on it but it can be found

in the brief of the Respondents in the next case to be
argued at pages 121 to 128.
Now, certain things happened after the enactment
of Title VII in Congress, too.

We-became involved with the

Equal Rights Amendment upon which many of the Petitioners
amici and this Petitioner rely.

They rely upon the

legislative history of that Act and they assert that the
legislative history of Equal Rights Amendment supports the
contention that the practice involved here should survive
a Title VII attack.
I would only point out that there was a t»aw
l^eview article perpared by a number of scholars entitled,
’A Constitutional Basis for Equal Rights for Women."

It was

published at 80 Yale Law Journal 871 and it was submitted to

20

every member of Congress in connection with the consideration
of Equal Rights Amendment and it was deemed by Congress to
be primary legislative history in connection with that
amendment and the authors of that article, in'response to
General Electric’s brief, have submitted an amicus curiae
i

brief to this

Court in the General Electric case in which

they track the legislative history of the Equal Rights
Amendment and point out the way in which it has been
portrayed to the Court and reached, the conclusion that the
challenged practice hare today would not survive.
It is also important to note that the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, whose guidelines were
sustained or upheld by the Court below didn’t adopt a new
position overnight in 1972.

As pointed out in our brief

and the brief of the various amici in support of our
position, as early as 1970, before Congress had an opportunity
to amend the Act in 1972, the EEOC had developed -- not the
guidelines but the principle, the premise which has evolved
into the guidelines and had published various decisions
which made it clear that from the EEOC’s point of view,
disparate treatment based upon the fact of pregnancy was
condemned by the Act.
QUESTION:

Mr. Specter.

MR. SPECTER:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

Where, in your view, in the many

21

briefs filed with us is the evolution of the Commission8s
attitude most clearly and pictoriallv and thoroughly and
intelligibly set out?
MR. SPECTER:

Again, 1 think credit is to be

given to the counsel for the Respondente in Gilbert, at
pages 106 through 119, there —
QUESTION:

106 to 119

MR. SPECTER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

In the Gilbert case —

MR. SPECTER:
QUESTION:

—

Yes.

-- Respondent's brief.

MR. SPECTER:

Yes, that is the fat yellow one,

your Honor.
Nov;, even after that

and perhaps most

significantly because the Petitioner has not responded to
it, the Educational Amendments Act of 1972

and 1974 were

enacted and provided for prohibitions against sex discrimin­
ation in federally-funded educational projects and delegated
to the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare the
authority to promulgate regulations to carry out those
amendments and Congress provided that, unlike the EEOCs
guidelines, HEW would have to publish regulations in advance
of an effective date and submit them to Congress and that if
• *

Congress didn't reject them, or alter them within 45 days,
they would be self-executing.

22

They were published.

They were transmitted

and they became effective and they are virtually identical
to the guidelines involved here today and they certainly
would indicate the current view of Congress and 1 think
under the philosophy enunciated by Mr. Justice Cardozo in
Burnett versus Guggenheim demonstrate what it is that Con­
gress would have done back in 1964 were it considering the
issue and I think that is the choice which has to be made.
I'd like to endeavor, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, to
respond to your question.
QUESTION:

Sorry to have interrupted you,

Mr. Specter, but do I understand by what you just told us
that the question is here whether, if asked today whether
Congress might

a majority of Congress might be persuaded

to enact legislation that would say that no employer in
interstate commerce could have a group insurance policy
that excluded pregnancy as among the disabilities covered?
Is that the question?
MR. SPECTER:

No, I am sorry.

It is ap>parent

that I didn't articulate well.
QUESTION:

Well, perhaps I —

MR. SPECTER:

Or as clearly as I should have,

Mr. Justice Stewart.
QUESTION:

My error, I suppose.

MR, SPECTER:

No.

23

QUESTION:

But I just wanted to be sure what

you would tell us on the question.
MR. SPECTER:

It is my understanding that in the

area of statutory construction it is appropriate to look,
I don't think there is any question, to statutes and legis­
lative history which were enacted or were involved prior to
and subsequent to the particular statute involved to
determine some continuing philosophy which would indicate
what it was that Congress had in mind back when it enacted
the particular statute and what we have here, I believe, is
a steady pattern which is reflective of an intention in
1964 to prohibit disparate treatment based on pregnancy as
a characteristic unique to females.
I think the question is, v?hat would they do if
presented with the question today?
I hope that answers your Honor’s question.
Mr. Justice Relinquish, you raised the question
of appealability and I am not sure that I can answer it
adequately but I hope that I can.
We considered that question when the appeal, was
taken to the Court of Appeals and of course, what we did is
no authority, but I assure you we would have gone kicking
and screaming to the Court of Appeals just as we opposed
coming here after winning the case, but in my view, a
declaratory judgment was entered which could be considered to

24

be final as —
QUESTION:
your point.

Is that true —- I can certainly see

There is a declaration of rights as to the

parties but what about a personal injury case where you
have a split trial as to liability and damages?

Couldn't

you say the court’s determination in the first phase of the
trial on the issue of liability is likewise a declaratory
judgment and would that then be appealable?
Because that would change a lot of
MR, SPECTER:

law.

Well, the most candid answer I

can give the Court is, I don’t believe that would be
appealable and I believe it is different.

We have a

situation here where we are dealing with a uniform practice
applied to a class of persons which, under this Court's
decision in Sosna versus Iowa has a kind of jural existence
of its own but I am not sure that totally answers the
question.
QUESTION:

Well, I am not sure it answers it

at all.
[Laughter. ]
MR. SPECTER;
that I can.

As I said, I would do the best

You raised an issue that I don't think anyone

fully anticipated.
QUESTION:
be entered.

But he did direct that a judgment

25
MR. SPECTER:
QUESTION:

He certainly did.

And he did enter the judgment.

MR. SPECTER:

He certainly did, Mr. Justice,

and I would analogize it, if it is appropriate to do so,
to what happened in Gilbert, the next case to be argued,
where an injunction was issued.
QUESTION:

Well, do you think it is arguable

that all that the judge did when he said, ”1 enter the
judgment and there really isn't any reason for delay."

Do

you think that is equivalent to certifying a controlling
question of law in fact, to —
MR. SPECTER:

Yes, your Honor, I think it is

that and something else.
QUESTION:

That is another argument, isn’t it?

MR. SPECTER:

Yes.

Well, he was asked to

certify it and he was asked by the Petitioner to certify it
under 1292B and the Court — and I believe this is in the
record because there was colloquy on the record.

I believe

the Court concluded that rather than have to await the
discretion of the Court of Appeals, 54B would be a more
appropriate/ and expeditious way of resolving a very
important question.
QUESTION:

So he didn’t certify it.

MR. SPECTER:
QUESTION:

Not under 1292B.

He thought ha was doing something

26

even more effective.
MR. SPECTER:

Yes* and I hope he was right.

That is why we are here.
[Laughter.]
QUESTION:

Although it was said in the Aiello

case, do you intend to give us more than one sentence, as
the Court of Appeals did on it?
MR. SPECTER:

Yes, I do.

Yes, I do.

I would

like to make just one more comment, if I may -QUESTION:

Go on.

MR. SPECTER:

— concerning the capability

because I believe it-is analogous to the Gilbert situation
where an injunction was entered and then stayed,,

In this

case, the trial judge, Judge Webber, said that this was an
appropriate case for injunctive relief, but he would
withhold thte entry of the injunction pending disposition
of the appeal and I think that functionally we have the
same situation and it may be a question of form over
substance, although I am reluctant to make an argument like
that with respect to a jurisdictional question, if, indeed,
it is jurisdictional.
QUESTION:

Just one little detail.

He did

purport to make a 54B finding, though, in the language of the
rule.
MR. SPECTER:

Oh, expressly yes, your Honor.

27
That is in the Appendix.
QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, don't lock for it.

I

just wanted to —■
MR. SPECTER:

There is no question about that

one.
QUESTION:

If he had made a 54B finding at the

close of the liability phase of a personal injury case, do
you think that would have solved the problem in a case
like that?
MR. SPECTER:

I hate to say no.

But I expect that the answer is no, Mi-.
QUESTION:

I am not sure.

Justice Rehnquist.

The problem under Rule 54B is whether

it is a multiple-claim case or not, isn't it?
MR. SPECTER:

That is certainly the situation

here, where there were three separate claims brought on
behalf of the class.
QUESTION:

Which, if any, of those three is

finally adjudicated now?
MR. SPECTER:

Wall, hopefully, this one.

The

two
QUESTION:

Well, but is the damage issue

resolved?
MR. SPECTER:

The damage issue has not been

resolved.
QUESTION:

So this claim is not finally

28
adjudicated.
MR. SPECTER:

The damacre issue is before the

trial court in one of the other claims, the claim of
discrimination in hiring and in promotion, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Let me just repeat, because I have

the same problem Mr. Justice Rehnquist does.

Which claim,

if any, do you contend has been finally adjudicated?
MR. SPECTER:

The claim that the pregnancy-

related practices are violative of Title VII and the claim
which is not before this Court that the Petitioner
discriminated against women as a class in hiring and
promotion, even though the issue of back pay has not been
resolved.
QUESTION:

And the unresolved issue was the

remedy?
MR. SPECTER:

Yes, your Honor.

In those two

claims.
QUESTION:

And the entitlement to an injunction

or entitlement to —
MR. SPECTER:
QUESTION:

Back pay.

MR. SPECTER:
QUESTION:
relief.

Back pay.

Yes.

You got no part of your prayer for

You asked for an injunction.

You didn’t get it.

/

You asked for damaces and you didn’t get it.

29
MR. SPECTER:

That is absolutely correct,

Mr. Justice Relinquist.
We also asked for a declaratory judgment,
however.
QUESTION:

Didn't you pray for such other relief —

MR. SPECTER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

-- as miqht be just and proper?

MR. SPECTER:

Yes, we did.

And that is at

page 19 of the Appendix.
The very troublesome Aiello case —
A number of things can be said about Aiello
which distinguish it from this

case, aside from the obvious

fact that it was a 14th Amendment case dealing with a state's
social welfare policy and not a Title VII case involving
a relationship between an employer and an employee under a
statute.
One is, that unlike the situation here, California
saw fit to come into court and explain why the plan contained
the exclusions that it did and, in fact, when an effort was
made to ascertain why the Petitioner in this case excluded
the benefits that we are tsIking about today, the only
explanation ever proffered was, on advice of counsel, and as
a matter of statutory construction,

"It is not required."

There was never any justification given in terms
of, "Well, it was done because it will cost us this much," or

30
"It was done because we are concerned about the welfare of
certain of our employees,” or "It was done because we don5t
have enough money to do it," or for any other explanation»
The position was that this case, on the facts,
on the language of the plan, was ripe for summary judgment
and no explanation for the reason behind the plan was
required.
Now, I think you get into the question of
burden of proof to some extent when you reach that point
because in the previous opinions of this Court, in Title VII
situations, relatively light burdens have been

imposed

upon employees for making out prima facie tests and the test
has been declared, in other cases, to be one of basic
fairness and it has been stated that, of course, the standard
varies from case to case.
But I would point out only that in this situation,
no one but the employer knows why it did what it did and why
it excluded whatever it excluded and once it was demonstrated
under the standards enunciated by this Court that only
women were affected, by this program, the burden, in fairness,
then shifted to the employer to come forward with whatever
simple or complex explanation it might have had for the plan.
And with respect to any other defenses which have
been suggested in the brief or today at oral argument, I
would only comment very briefly that there were absolutely

31

no defenses suggested., raised, briefed or argued below and
it is fundamental that this is neither the time nor the
place to assert them,
QUESTION:

But until -- one does not get to

defenses until or unless there is a finding of discrimination
based upon sex.

Isn't that correct?

MR. SPECTER:

Of course, your Honor, and it was

the petition of the Petitioner below that there was none as
a matter of statutory construction.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. SPECTER:

And under all of the tests

enunciated by this Court, the

question is basically one of

impact and where does the impact fall?

And if it falls on

a protected class such as -QUESTION:

Under all of the decisions of this

Court, including Aiello?
MR. SPECTER:

Title VII cases, your Honor.

Title VII cases,
I am not sure, quite sincerely, what the burden,
of proof was in Aiello, even assuming — well, not assuming,
it is apparent that Aiello required a shewing of pretext,
at least within the context of that case and I am not sure
where the burden of proof would fall to demonstrate the
presence or lack of a pretext in the first instance.
The burdens generally imposed by this Court in

32

the Title VII cases have been light ones and in many of
those cases where the burdens of proof were enunciated,
ultimately the employees did not prevail, but I think there
has been a clear recognition that, in fairness, once an
impact is shown, the party who is in possession of the
knowledge concerning the practice ought to come forward and
explain it and perhaps cooincident with that, the test
enunciated by Mr. Justice Stevens in his dissenting opinion
in

is an appropriate one because I think it dovetails

with the impact test enunciated by this Court in Title VII
cases and -QUESTION:

May we have the citation?

MR, SPECTER:

Yes, it is at 444 Fed. 2nd, your

Honor.
QUESTION:

444?

MR, SPECTER:

444, Fed. 2nd and I think it's

1194.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

QUESTION:

Mr. Specter, where is the plan?

Is it

in the big one or the joint Appendix?
MR, SPECTER:

It is in the joint Appendix and it

is supplemented — it begins at page -- that preliminary
description begins at 86, the affidavit and then the -QUESTION:

I am not interested in the description.

I want to know where the plan is.

MR. SPECTER:
QUESTION:

The plan is —

Verbatim plan, what we are talking

about.

page 88, your Honor and on page 89 is the statement,

for absences due to pregnancy."

What is this, a regulation or

something?
MR. SPECTER:

Where is the language that you say

is bad?

MR. SPECTER:

QUESTION:

Well —

The whole thing?

MR, SPECTER:

Taking the most, recent plan, the

one which we know was in effect in June of 1970, if we look
at page 99 of the joint appendix, there is the statement,

34

"Limitations on insurance benefits:

Benefits are not payable

for disability due to pregnancy or any cause related to
pregnancy,” and that is what we say is wrong, Mr. Justice
Marshall, because the impact falls solely upon women.
QUESTION:

And that is the one that is now in

existence.
MR. SPECTER:

That is the one which the record

demonstrates was in existence at the time of the adjudication
and as far as I know, it is the only plan.

That exclusion

is also included in the plan which was annexed as an
appendix to the Petitioner’s brief but it is no part of the
record and I can't fairly address myself to its existence or
when it came into being.
I believe that my time is up and unless your
Honor has another question, thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Grove.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KALVIN M. GROVE, ESQ.
QUESTION:

Mr. Grove, do you agree that on 99 is

what, v?e are talking about?
MR. GROVE:

Your Honor, what is on page 99

appears to be only a portion of the plan, the limitations.
What is in the record or in our brief before you includes
other exclusions that do net appear at page 99 of the record.

Other pregnancy ones?
No, the other disabilities that they

This one on 99?

MR. GROVE:

than this?
MR. GROVE:
QUESTION:
MR. GROVE:
the record.

That is right.
Well, where is it in the record?
Well, I ant not sure that it is in

Bear in mind the material that is presented

here, I find it somewhat of a shock that Mr. Specter now
says that he has never seen the plan because the discovery
in this case has been extensive but the plan that is attached
to our brief is the actual plan and it does have exclusions
over and above that which appears on page 99.
QUESTION:
MR. GROVE:

Is it in the transcript?
My recollection is that it is, but —*

36

QUESTION:
MR. GROVE:
QUESTION:

Is it on trial here?
It should be.
I can't help on "should be."

Don't

you know?
MR. GROVE:

Well, I — yes, it is.

I would like to draw the Court’s attention to
the comments concerning the Equal Ray Act that Mr. Specter
made and the Wage and. Hour Administrator has said, "If
employer contributions to a plan providing insurance for
similar benefits to employees are

equal for both men and

women, no wage differential prohibited by the Equal Pay
provisions will result from such payments, even though the
benefits which accrue to the employees in question are
greater for one sex than for the other."
So, according to the Administrator of the Equal
Pay Act, Liberty Mutual's policy making equal contributions
is in total and. full compliance with the Equal Pay Act.
I think that also, when Mr. Specter indicates
that we gave no reason why we have excluded these disabilities,
I think the Court, and it said it in Aiello, is that it is
evident that a program or a totally comprehensive program is
going to cost substantially more than one without these
disabilities and I think that cost situation can be assumed.
I submit, though, and I believe that Mr. Justice
Stewart asked the question, the burden always remains on the

37
plaintiff to show that the reason for the exclusion is a
pretext and they have not done that in this case.

There is

nothing in the record to indicate that the reason for the
exclusion was a pretext.
QUESTION:

They argue you don't get to the

pretext question until you have raised an affirmative
defense.

If, on its face, the plan is discriminatory, why

do we have to talk about pretext?
MR. GROVE:

Well, Aiello says to us that

exclusion of this disability is not discrimination per se
until it is shown that the reason for the exclusion is a
pretext to engage in invidious discrimination.
QUESTION:

Well, by like reasoning, is there any

reason to talk about costs in this case?

Could you, for

example, would it be relevant if there were a difference in
pay between males and females to say, well, it would cost
more to increase the female's salary level?

Would that

be relevant?
MR. GROVE:

Well, I don't think you get to the

question of cost unless the Plaintiff has sustained its
initial burden.
QUESTION:

So isn't this whole case turned on

whether or not this is a prima facie case, a discrimination
within the meaning of the statute?
MR. GROVE:

And Aiello says it is not.

38
If I were — I would like to -QUESTION:

Do you agree with your opponent’s

analysis of my dissent in Sprogis?

Hava you read that case?

MR, GROVE:

Well, I agree

Yes, your Hqnor.

with your dissent.
[Laughter.3
QUESTION!
MR. GROVE:

QUESTION:

You agree?
Obviously.
Do you agree — that is not the

question — do you agree that if one applies the test that. I
applied there to this case, ha has made out a prima facie
case?
MR. GROVE:
QUESTION:
MR. GROVE:
applied

Absolutely not.

Why not?
I agree that the test that you

if your test, your dissent in Sprogis was

applied, you wouldn’t because you don’t have discrimination
between substantially similarly-situated people.
QUESTION:

But would not these Plaintiffs not

face a particular risk if they were male?
MR,. GROVE:
QUESTION:

"Would not these Plaintiffs
Would they not avoid the risk of

being hospitalised for a short period of time with no income
if they ware males?
MR. GROVE:

I have some difficulty in

39
understanding just exactly what you are saying, even though
you are saying it very plainly»
QUESTION:
MR. GROVEs
plan.

Well, then, I won't try to rephrase it.
What is important, though, is the

Mr.Specter argues about the impact.

But this plan, if

you look at it, has impact in disproportionate statistics
against others.

Statistically, I presume that one might be

able to show that males attempt suicide in a greater rate
than women.

So, because we exclude that, I suppose we are

discriminating against males.
One might legitimately argue, I suppose, that
statistically men have alcoholic problems greater than
women.

I don't know if you can prove that, but just assume.

So we don't cover that unless there is a licensed physician
so we are probably discriminating against men in that
situation.
I think the whole thing goes to say, really, in
summary, that an employer such as Liberty Mutual or anybody
else can exclude in his wisdom anything under its disability
program as long as it cannot be proven that that is a pretext
to engage in invidious discrimination and that is the thing
that is missing in this case and I would just like to say,
to indicate to the Court that I think Judge Widdener in the
Fourth Circuit in his dissent in the G. E. case which, of
course, is again the next case, really said it and I might

40

end, and I will sit down on that — he said, "The inquiry
in this case must therefore focus initially on whether
exclusion of pregnancy-related disability on the disability
benefits plan is sex discrimination»

If it is not sex

discrimination, then regardless of what test is applied,
there is no Title VII violation."
Absent a showing of sex discrimination, Title
VII, even if its reach 'were broader than the Equal
Protection Clause, would not render unlawful a pregnancy
exclusion, such as that involved here»
Thank you.
QUESTION:

Suppose the statement, said that

women should not be eligible for payments as a result of
illness from alcohol?

Would that be all right?

MR. GROVE:

Women should not be eligible for

payments due to alcohol»

I think that in that type of

situation, the burden would, be on the employer to explain,
does

it have a rational basis for excluding that?
QUESTION:

That is because they used the word

"woman."
MR., GROVE:
QUESTION:
here.

That is right.
Well, they used the ward "pregnant"

Is there any difference?
MR. GROVE:

the word.

Well, I don't mean just the use of

41

QUESTION:

Is there any difference?

Is there

any difference?
MR. GROVE:

Not if you are just using word

semantics; not if you are just putting women and pregnancy —
QUESTION:

Semantics?

It is fact.

When you say pregnancy, you say women.
MR. GROVE:
QUESTION:
MR, GROVE:
at all.

Absolutely.
All right.
I don't disagree with you on that

At least, right now, standing here I don't.

It has

never been shown otherwise.
QUESTION:

You don't have any evidence to the

contrary.
MR. GROVE:

None.
