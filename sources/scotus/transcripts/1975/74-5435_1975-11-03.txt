Mr, Hanson, you may proceed whenever you're ready»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROGER S. HANSON, ESQ»,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR* HANSON;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
Presented before the Court today is the case of
I mb lor vs. Pachfcxtian, which presents the issue which has been
litigated many, many times at the Circuit Court level through”
out the United States, and -that is the question of the- immunity
or the liability which falls upon a public prosecutor under
the 42 U.S.C. 1933 Civil sights .Act and statute, where, in this
particular case, there has been an allegation in ‘the complaint
of knowing use of perjury? and also presents the rather unique
set of facts that prior to the initiation of this lawsuit
there's been continuous litigation throughout the California
Supreme Court, through the United States District Court in Los
Angeles, the U. S. Ninth Circuit, and so forth, where we have
opinions which have determined and fixed that there was in fact
knowing use of perjury and a writ of habeas, corpus was granted
under 22 U.S.C. *— 28 U.S.C. 2254 for this knowing use of
perjury.
QUESTION; Wa also have opinions going the other way,

4
don5 te wQf from the Supreme Court of California?
MR» HANSONs

I’m glad you &slc@d that question, Mr»

Justice Rehnquist, because, in fact, the opinions of the
California Suprema Court did not address themselves as thoroughly
as the opinion of U, S. District Judge Warren Ferguson in Los
Angeles»
This was due to a multiplicity of reasons»

It was

due to inadequate briefing, in my opinion, on the lawyers»

It

was due to, perhaps, an overt ignoring by the California
Supreme Court of some of the things that took place in this
case, within the meaning of Hapue vs. Illinois —
QUESTION % Well, nonetheless, you can weigh the
opinions the way you want, but what you have is seven Justices
of the Supreme Court unanimously finding against: your client
on this point? one single federal District Judge upsetting
the thing?

and three judges of the Ninth Circuit affirming»
MR» HANSON:

Plus a petition was made by the State of

California to this Court to have that reviewed, and it was
nin© to nothing against: voting any hearing in the case»
QUESTION: Well, how do you know 'that?
MRo HANSON:

I know that because I opposed it,.

I was

asked to file a petition in opposition»
QUESTION: Well, how do you know what the vote was in
our conference?
MR» HANSONs

Well, there were no votes that suggested

5
certiorari be granted»
QUESTION: Well* is that the test?

Is that how you

find out what the vote was at eur conference?
MR» HANSON: Well* that's — I know that some of the
denials of certiorari are accompanied by:

"Mr. Justice X and

Mr. Justice Y would grant certiorari in this case»"

So I'm

basing it; on that.
I* of course* have no access to how the voting took
place* other than that.
But I can assure this Court that within the meaning
of 28 UoSoC. 2254* the same record was ©ss&mined by the federal
district judge in Los Angeles.
hearings took place,

There’s no new evidentiary

And based on that record* the opinion at

298 Fed.Supp. 795 was prepared* and that opinion is accurate*
and accurately reflects what took place in tills case.
Those findings by that district judge- are more
complete than

California Supreme Court and* in fact* are

the accurate situation that occurred here.
And* you know* I can’t force the California Supreme
Court to make findings.,

And -they also* when they granted an

order to show cause in the California Supreme Court, they
restricted the inquiry by certain questions* which narrowed
down the scope that they were going to take a look at.
The significant Napue vs. Illinois situation that
occurred in this case was really ignored by then? namely*

6
unquestionably the prosecutor in this case knew of certain
falsa statements that were being mad© by his witness, and he
chose not# for whatever reasons he had at that time# to correct
them*
QUESTIONS

Mr * Harmon# while the minutes of the

habeas corpus proceeding may have something to do with this
case# the primary and cardinal question here is the extent of
the immunity# if any# of the prosecutors# is it not?
MRo HANSON:

2 understand*

QUESTION: And I know that you take a backup position
that even though there might be immunity in the normal situation#
at the very least there should b® an exception when a federal
court has found that there ~~
MRo HANSON:
QUESTION:

Correct.
«■•*> that -there was a knowing use of perjured

testimony*
But -the first and basic question is the immunity of
a prosecutor# quit© apart from the merits ©f this case? isn't
that correct?
MR. HANSON: That's correct.

No question about it.

QUESTION: That's -what I thought.
MR. HANSON:

No question about it.

Now# as to that particular situation# there's no
question that -the national ballot# if you count up all the
cases that have gone one way versus the other way# overwhelmingly

?
is against the petitioner in this particular case, just without
question»

However, there’s been some, in my ©pinion, correctly

mad© inroads out of the U»S„ Sixth Circuit in Ohio, in the
case of Hilliard .va. Williams., which again has bean decided by
them *— 1 don't have the new citation on it, but it want up on
the damages the second time, and the U» S» Sixth Circuit again
affirmed that lina of reasoning and sent it. bach to th® District
Court to more correctly determine damages above the one-dollar
limit that was awarded, at th© time cf th® trial by the District
Judge,
S© I think the situation boils down tos

what type of

case are w© going to permit this in?
I don’t ask the Court, and I don’t think it’s really
necessary to ask the Court to say, Yes, the floodgates ought to

be opened to allow any sort of lawsuit to be filed against th©
public prosecutor»

I don’t think that is th.® situation at all.

I think there are many safety valves that can foe
accorded her® and still allow this suit to be filed on its
merits,

And among them ar® certainly pretrial hearings,

whereby the district judg© would inquire into the merits of the
case and inquire into what 1 believe to be the four things -that
must really be inquired ins
No, X, did ho do a good-faith act?
No, 2, was his act vd.th.in his discretion?
No, 3, was it within something provided by law?

8

And No. 4, was it within hia jurisdiction?
And I suggest that -QUESTIONs

Wouldn’t tli© good faith be pretty much a

question for the jury in ©very case, in their view?
HR, HANSON*

Weil, —

QUESTION* Subjective state of mind,
MR, HANSONs
possible»

That’s vary possible»

That’s very

But the good-faith act would b@ within the jury's

question? no question about it.
QUESTION* So that you'd have a jury issue, under your
view, of what should bv. the rule in almost every case?
MR* HANSONs Well, I deft believ® in almost ©very case»
Certainly not in this case.

Certainly not in this case that’s

before the Court now.
In other words, what I’m saying is, if there's an
allegation of knowing use of perjury or something of that
nature, which is clearly without the scope of hia duty, without
the scope of his jurisdiction, not provided by law, condemned
by all the decisions of this Court, as well as the California
Supreme Court and any court you want to pick up? that is semething that I think has to stand»
they have to respond to»

It has to go to the jury,

No question about it»

If that is a

factual issue»
QUESTION;

In this case you have a finding by a

court, a competent court, in a writ of habeas corpus.

That’s

9

your case» Why do you want to extend it beyond that?
MR» HANSON?

Well, 1 don’t necessarily want to.

But

I’m addressing myself to Mr» Justice Stewart, who said the
broad question should be considered firsts

should the suit be

filed, allowed to stand in general, are your allegations the
seme?
QUESTIONs

Well, vour point, I assume, 'is that

where there has been a finding in a court on a habeas corpus,
that the conduct was thus-and-soj 'that at least entitles you
to a hearing»
MR» HANSONs

Y@s0

No question»

In other words,

I'm going on —
QUESTIONs

I just want to be sure you’re not

abandoning that»
MRa HANSON?

Oh, no, not at all»

I'm going generally

on the typ© of analysis provided by Learned Hand in the Gregoire
va» Biddle decision, IV7 Fed 2d, I think, ‘at 579 ,is the cita­
tion on it»

And certainly there’s probably not more revered a

judge than Learned Hand at the circuit level? ©rid he said that
if it were possible before the trial to ascertain which suits
>

had merit and which didn’t, it would be really tragedy to
dismiss a suit that did in fact have merit.
And I suggest to this Court —
QUESTION! And he also said that even if the action
was malicious, immunity was there.

You don’t want to adopt

10
that;, do you?
MR» HANSONs
QUESTIONs
MR» HANSOM:
QUESTIONS

H© did say that; that’s correct»
He sure did!
That’s correct»
I would think that would be the last

quotation you would want to make for your cause.
MR» HANSONs Well; 1 say that our case comas within
that canopy; because we have come as close as we could to the
situation with the grant of the Federal Writ of Habeas Corpus;
because of that particular issue.
In other words* this nan has had his preliminary
hearing»

The reason that —*
QUESTIONS Wall* if he’s had his preliminary hearing

— where?
MR. HANSONs

He’s had his preliminary hearing by

virtue of this 22 U0S0C0 -- or 28 U.S.C, 2254 granted writ of
habeas corpus.
QUESTIONS Well, why is the respondent bound by that
proceeding?

He wasn’t a party to it, was he?

MR. HANSONs Well, no, but the record is there, Mr.
Justice Relinquish, and h® admitted ~~ he was called as a
witness in this evidentiary hearing, and h© admitted tinder oath
that he had done these things.
QUESTION:

He admitted that he had ~

Well, you could use his testimony against

him, then, I presumej but if he’s not a party, I would think

11
he wouldn't be bound.
MRo HANSON* Well» the U. S„ Ninth Circuit said he was
not bound.

I tried to urge an th e U. S» Ninth Circuit a type

of res judicata» by virtue of the grant of th© writ by the
district court.

They did not go along with that at all.

However, th© point is simply 'that if you have done as
extensive a litigation as we have don© on this particular case»
it then gats around the contention that they am being required
to respond to a frivolous type of claim.
a frivolous type of claim.

It certainly is not

Xtcs a claim that has merit, by

virtue of th® fact that this was granted by the 0. S„ District
Court»
And I can only tell this Court that it was granted
because that district judge, at ray urging and ©n my briefing,
examined that record with due scrutiny, which was not done in
th© California Supreme Court»

Or, if it was done, it was

ignored,
QUESTION*

That district judge has been reversed no

less than, three times by this Court sine© I've been a member of
it,
MR. HANSON: Well, I don't know„

I'm only talking

about this case# only about this case. And this
reversed.

-case was not

The U. S» Ninth Circuit upheld his grant, and this

Court denied certiorari.

As far as I know, with no votes.

So there's no question in my mind that at least the

12
threshold showing has been made.
Now, in this particular case, as' the Court perhaps
knows, there has been numerous contentions made that it’s going
to open the floodgates to litigation., And I say again there are
numerous safety waives that really militate against this»
2 think the first one — the first one is that
usually people, like in the position of Mr, Xmfo3.®r, ara seeking
substantial damages,

limy go to a lawyer and they say;

want to do this, and 1 want to bring this lawsuit.

I

Usually

the lawyer is not in a position, nor ©re they able to pay an
hourly rater so it’s often done on a contingency basis,
I therefor® would suggest to th® Court: that any
lawyer would probably scrutinize, himself, the record? he would
try to make inquiries to e@a if he's chasing a comet that has
no merit at all.

Just like a personal injury case that comes

into th© office of a lawyer, h® would examine it with diligence
to see,
tod X think that there is an immense safety valve
t© the bringing of thee© lawsuits,
QUESTIONS

Do X understand correctly that this case

came before the California Supreme Court twice?
MR, HANSON*
QUESTIONS
MR, HANSON:

In fact, three times,
Three times,
The first time was on th© automatic

appeal, which is provided under our Penal Cod©, because the

13

death sentence was imposed.

At that time, non® of this matter

was brought before them, because it was not disclosed»
QUESTION? But was it not — was it treated, to any
degree at all, in the final disposition by the California
Sup real® Court?
MR» HANSON: The second opinion, Mr» chief Justice, at
60 Cal» 2d 554, was as close as the California Supreme Court
cam® to treating it, and it again ignored many of the issues»
QUESTION *

Justice Traynor wrote both of the

opinions?
MR» HANSONs
QUESTION*
MR» HANSON*

He did»

The first two opinions»

Th© first two*

I think h® wrote ©11 three opinions»

Th© third opinion is at 61 Cal» 2d, and that came about because
of & violation of th© so-called Peopl© vs«Morse dociaion
ef the California Supreme Court, which said that the prosecutor
could not comment to the jury that a life sentence in California
really didn®t mean a life sentence, that if you want to make
sure this fellow is not out on the street again, you better
execute him»
And they voted the death penalty ©gainst Mr» Imbler
because of this comment, and that case was given director
activity by the California Suprema Court, and so Mr, Imbler
was able to take advantage of that, which generated th© third
opinion from the California Supreme Court»

14
ted then th© prosecutor elected not too try fch® penalty
phase over again and stipulated to a life sentence as opposed
to a death sentence*.
QUESTION*
damages?

So that was the posture of it*
What &r@ you asking for hermg only

Any other kind of relief?
MRo HANSON*

Only monetary damages, that's correct»

In the district court lawsuit, that's correct»
Now j> I think — also, I think I alluded to this very
briefly, that I know that on® of the specters that is hanging
over an attempt that is being made h@ra by th® plaintiff to
allow him to bring this suit is that there's going to be felt
that some national precedent is going to be set, and I would
again say to this Court that, as happened in this particular
case, certain pretrial hearings can ba held whereby the
plaintiff would be required to make a rather significant showing
that h© falls within the canopy that I'm urging on ‘this Court,
namely, it is something that has to be outside of fell©
discretionary act of the prosecutor and ostensibly mad© with
no good faith, and outside of his jurisdiction, and things of
that nature»
QUESTION* But isn't good faith almost always a question
for the jury?
MR» HANSON* Well, certainly it is probably always a
question for the jury —*
QUESTION* But then you wouldn't eliminat® any css©.

15
really, by your pretrial hearing, would you?
MR* HANSON 3 Well, I !si mentioning mors than that
aloae? X*m mentioning whether it ie a discretionary act or not*
Certainly the bulk ©f these cases, X think, are correctly
decided in granting immunityj because the bulk of the things
that happen arcs within the discretion of the prosecutor*
For example, the metamorphosis in the Ninth Circuit
starts off with a case that — after this Act was passed,
starts off with a case called Sires vs* Cole, I think*

And

Sires vs* Cole was & suit versus not only the prosecutor but
also th® judge, because the man was convicted of calf stealing,
end lie was sentenced for a felonv as opposed to a misdemeanor.
Now, certainly, that probably was a mere mistake on
the part of th© judge, and was correctly thrown out, and that
was a 1963 case.
The next time th© U* S„ Ninth Circuit examined this
was in a case called Harmon vs* Superior Court, 329 Fad 2d

154,

there it was a simple domestic relations squabble in Stata
court*

The plaintiff in the civil rights suit was disappointed,

apparently, at th© results that took placa in his State court
domestic relations matter and he brought a lawsuit against the
prosecutor

or against the State* s district attorney who was

seeking to make him pay child support.
Again, I think clearly, properly thrown out? it was
something within his discretion, he was doing his day-to-day

16
job, doing what h® had to do*

But th® knowing «a® of perjury

is not that class of casea, not that class of thing.
QUESTION:

Cases that have decided this issue

against the theory that you’re arguing have put it on th.® basis
that, not of the risk of having a damage verdict, but against
the dangers and the rinks involving — involved in having a
prosecutor spend his time defending suits instead of carrying
out his function of prosecuting cases.

Isn’t that th© choice

that" s been made?
MRa HANSON? Well, I understand that that’s the
language that appears in many of the cases, there’s no question
about it? that's why I’m urging on this Court that where there
has been extensive litigation, culminating in a successful
grant of th© writ by a district judge, upon examination ©f th©
record, as he has to do under Townsend.vs. Sain.

Then we are

not dealing with something that is nonsubstantial, we are not
dealing with frivolity, we’re dealing with something that
should be responded to.
Otherwise, it makes th© decision of the district
attorney the suprema law of th© land? unreviewable by any
court at all.

And this Court, just last term, in a couple of

cases, in th© Scheuer vs. Rhodes decision, allowed a suit
against the Governor of Ohio? in Wood vsa Strickland, a suit
against a School Board.
Now, I would suggest that the language of Scheuer vs

1?
Rhodes again deals with til® good faith, discretionary basis.
That Governor ordered out the national Guard in Kent, Ohio,
at that miv@rs.ity, because he perceived he had to do something
quickly, .and —
QUESTIONS ^You ■than, apparently, equate prosecutors
and all other executive officers as being on the sam level?
MR, HANSONs

I do, I think that this so-called quasi­

judicial immunity, which creeps into the decisions, is really a
misnomer*
Surely, th® Attorney General of the United States,
the Attorney General of California, thea© &r® officers that are
responding to thss President of th© United STates or th® Governor
or ao forth, they’re an am ©f the Executive Branch,

There's

no question «about that.
And th© question — or Hi® reason that this has coma
into th© cases, without a doubt, is because allegedly a
prosecutor exercises discretion just like a judge doesQUESTIONs

You. think a Governor calling out th©

National Guard is exercising a quasi-judicial function?
MR, HANSON:

No.

I tiiink he's exercising an executive

function, aa the chief law officer of th© State,
QUESTIONS
MR, HANSON:

Sure, executive»
But to insulate on© side to a lawsuit,

as they are attempting to do with the public prosecutor, from
review by any type of civil rights action, by any type of a

IS
federal judge* X think elevates him to a position where his
decision becomes above the U„ So Constitution* becomes above
review by anybody»
tod I 'would also suggest that really there aren't
that many of these suits®

You can check through all the books

and* compared with all the other suite* there

really aren't

that many®
QUESTIONS

Do you think there might be more of them

if you prevail her®?
HR® HANSON %

No* I don't think so* Chief Justice

Burger* because I think tills Court can delineate certain
guidelines that have to be followed* and I would hop® that
they would do so in allowing this suit to stand®

I think that

the Court can delineate guidelines in the way off some type of
preliminary hearing* where* in fact* merit must, be shown by —
QUESTIONs

You've mentioned that about three times

during your argument* Mr® Hanson®

Are you suggesting that

these wouldn't bs subject to the normal standards of pretrial
hearings and the right of jury trial on contested issues of
fact* teat we would just carve out some exception to the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for these kind of cases?
MR® HANSON z

I think teat surely if you could not

show teat he was behaving outside of a discretionary act* it
would be automatically subjected to dismissal®
the issues

That's one of

19

QUESTION $ Well, okay.
discretionary act.

Now,, you say outside of &

No*», supposing I'm a prosecutor, during the

trial x*m confronted with the defense counsel’s demand for
i

Brady materials, and I make the best judgment I can, I act in
good faith, I turn out to be wrong, th© appellate court

reverses me.
Now, is that a discretionary act on my part?
MR. HANSONs

It's a harder decision, obviously, than

the knowing use of perjured testimony % a harder decision.
QUESTIONS Well, but even the knowing us® of perjured
testimony, you can end up with a finding to that effect on
th© basis of hindsight.- but the question in the eyes of the
prosecutor may be, you know, wIs this witness lying or isn’t
he?

Can. I, consistently with my constitutional requirements,

put him on the stand?"
Those things don’t always look black*» and-whit@ at
the time they happen.
MR. HANSON:

I understand. But in this particular

case he admitted t© knowing this, if it please the Court? he
admitted to knowing the status of this man,that h© had been
committed to an insane asylum by a court.

And he said, at the

evidentiary hearing, WX decided to let the jury attempt to
figure it out themselves."
QUESTION:

Am! the Supreme Court of California

upheld th© prosecutor’s position on the basis of that evidentiary

20
hearing,
MR,HANSON: Well, by ignoring that particular thing
in its opinion, by ignoring that»
QUESTIONt

You mean Chief Justice Traynor ignored

what you say is the heart of this case?
MR, HANSON2

That’s correct.

That opinion — if you

place before, sids-by **a id®, the two opinions of the California
Supreme Court and the U. 3, District Judge, they obviously
consider different tilings, The U» S» District Judge considers
many more factors.
Now, certainly I don’t think my opponents ara
suggesting that that U, S, District Judge falsified any material
that he put in that opinion.

He certainly did not.

H© quoted

directly from transcript material.
Now, X, of course, was not the lawyer before the
California Suprema Court, so I can’t say, "Gee, you know, I did
a bad job there? but X have read all the briefs and there's a
mountain of material uhat goes from the floor to the ceiling on
•this case.

And they just simply did not gat to th® merits of

the case, like the U.
QUESTIONi

District Judge did, because —
If yon vere not there, how do you know

what Judge Traynor had?
I assume, when you pavs judgment on him, tick you
had argued the cas
MR. HANiON:

No, 1 just re id th® opinion, Judge

21

Traynor' s opinion.
QUESTION*

So you just ~ yours is all based on

reading the ©pinion that brought this conclusion that he didn't
know what he was talking about?
MR® HANSON*

No, I've read the briefs and some of

these materials war© not properly briefed®

Because there are

soma people that say, foil, unless there's actual overt perjury,
it's different than the Napue vs® Illinois situation where he
is required to change, or to call to the attention of the triers
any

known falso statementss
Some people distinguish that in their mind®
QUESTION

&

My only point is I don't think you need to

characteris® a judge's actions in order to win your lawsuit.
MR.HANSONs
QUESTION3

Well, that's possible? that's possible.
Possible!?

That's as far as you can go?

MR. HANSON* Wall, 1 hop© that I don't have to.
I think that, considering th© wood _vs.

triokland

B

analysis, where this Court accorded liability against an
Arkansas School Board, if you rely on that type of thinking of
this Court, then, a fortiori, this case ought to be allowed
t© stand.
QUESTION *

You think their functions are quasi­

judicial?
MR. HANSON *

No, I don’t, but I think that the — the

point I'm trying to make out of this is that a member of th©

22

Arkansas School Board ostensibly has no training ground to
become a member of the School Board»

H© may be the local grocer ,

he may be the postman or something, he may serve on feh© School
board because It is a civic duty»

He has probably very little

knowledge about what the civil rights of those students are#
but this Court said that; as to existing law thatss well estab­
lished in. this country,, th© School Board should b@ held to know
about it»
They? r® not going to fee hold to anticipates changes
in constitutional law, but they*re certainly going to be held
to anticipat® what th© existing constitutional law is»

And

certainly, a fortiori, with th© law school training of a
prosecutor and his pre^umod knowledge of the canons of ethics,
and his presumed knowledge of the decisions of this Court, from
Mooney ve „ Holohan to bapue vs» Illinois to Miller vs» Pate,
to Units cl

s tat© a

vs «, Koegh, and the various decisions which have

uniformly condemned this particular type of behavior, this man
surely is put on knowledge that what he was doing not only is
wrong biblically but ie wrong legally»
QUESTIONS

On the other hand, in th© case of a.

prosecutor, you have some corrective devices available, other
than a 1983 action, don't you?

You have the supervision of

the trial judge, your right of appeal in the criminal case,
and your right of habeas corpus, which you took advantage of
here»

That doesn't give you money damages, but it does offer

23

you a rout® by which you can correct the alleged prosecutorial
misconduct.
MR. HANSONi That's correct.

MR, HANSON s

That issue is going to be decided by the

California Supreme Court in the Horvath matter,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

Thank you,

Mr, Farrell,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P, FARRELL, ESQ, ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, FARRELLs

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
I’d like to respond, first, to a coup!® ©f factual
matters»
As to the Horvath case, the issue there is whether
a suit could ba brought in the State courts under the Federal
Civil Rights Act? and, if so, the application of the Tort
Claims Act.

Under the California Tort Claims Act, itself, there

would be immunity for discretionary acts, and an absolute
immunity for malicious prosecution.
And -then in the California courts there would be the
general common lew defense as to defamation and use of testimony
at trial.
But ‘there is a special statutory remedy for a person
convicted of a crime, who is later pardoned, and compensation

28

can be provided under statutory scheme for a portion of the
sentence he served.

So that's not a suit, against the prosecutor?

it’s a suit? a claim filed with the State under Penal Code
Section 4900.

It's in our list of remedies that are available

to a parson.
So there is a monetary scheme available without a suit
being maintained under the California law against the prosecutor.
QUESTION;

Well? under California law? there is a.

damage remedy against this prosecutor if you can show he knowingly
used perjured testimony?
MR. FARRELL®

No? there*s not a damage: remedy against

fch© prosecutor? there's a claim for monetary compensation for
a person who is deemed to b© unjustly convicted.
QUESTION®

You mean out of State funds?

MR„ FARRELL:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Well? how about suing the prosecutor?

MR. FARRELL:

Ho.

Under the Tort Claims Act he would

have an absolute immunity from malicious prosecution? and under
the Tort Claims Act? all common-law defenses as to the use of
testimony would apply.

And I would feel that that would

clearly cover the matter.
Also there's a —

Typically, a sheriff or a marshal carrying out the

a. federal prosecutor could bring him for violation of the

Thera*© certainly «« I think there's two branches, as
we present it, of the Civil Rights Act, and you could view
1983 as,on®,to anfore® a standard ■— to help enforce a standard
cf behavior? and, second, to provide some forms of redress.
Whereas to enforce a standard of behavior, there's a
criminal action can be brought by -feli® U. S. Attorney.

We've

presented all -the criminal actions -that can be brought by the
State government against him.

There's a judge sitting there,

who, assumedly, is fair.
This matter, for instance, went all the way through
the California courts, who upheld the prosecutor all along the
way.

Not only that, there was then the right to petition, to

this Court for certiorari, and there was the final right which
was «exercised of bringing a habeas corpus in a federal court.

MR» FARRELLs Well, you might be able to prove up
some damages from that, but I think the act would have to be

would be an act that was not within the normal scope of a
prosecutor’s function, disregarding allegations of motive.
QUESTIONS

That’s the tests

the conduct that is or

is not normal prosecutorial function?
MR» FARRELLs

Yes»

And I think normally a prosecutor,

Clemency Boards, he participates on appeals, he argues on

As for those acts, in those acts he's acting within

a quasi-judicial capacity.

And if you alleged that he did those

improperly, he did it criminally, he did it maliciously; as to
those acts, he’s immune.
Now, if you can say, Well, on his way here he took a
witness and beat him up to keep him from coming, the act of
beating up a witness doesn't, prima facie, appear to be a

MR. FARRELLs

I think in Prosser we were on the

defamation immunity, aid cited the law of England as well»
And the reason I want to —»
QUESTION!

microphone off.3

MR. FARRELLs Well, the reason I wanted to correlate
?

the defamation immunity with this is — and judicial immunity
and legislative immunity is the legislative — the rule in this
Court has been that immunity under 19B3 is really a question of
statutory construction, and the statutory construction has
always proceeded from the fact that what the immunity was at
common lav/ applies under 1983.
So this Court found that under the common law there
was absolute, judicial immunity and applied it under 1983.

The

44
same thin? with legislative immunity.
As to executive immunity, for instance peace officers,
found that at the common law peace officers only had the
defense of good faith and reasonable cause.

And applied that

under 1383.
And the smm is true with Scheuer vs. Rhodes and the
aan*-!*toxOxrzi£ ffl.il, 5»

Strickland case? it was — all of them cited common law
tradition.
Well, in this case I think the Court of Appea3.s
decisions which are overwhelmingly, perhaps, immunity, have
in fact studied and they, themselves, cite a lot of State cases,
the earlier ones in particular.
I think the Vase Hi vs. Goff is probably the best, of
this entire string of decisions.
QUESTIONi

What Circuit is that?

MR. FARRELL*
QUESTION;

And **«

Y ms 6111 vs. Goff.

...

Yes.

MR. FARRELLs

Which is ‘the earliest case, and it,

itself, relates defamation immunity.

-And the reason why

defamation immunity is also important is that defamation immunity
intends to allow a counsel, in the presentation of his case, to
be free from worrying about civil liability - to ask himself
personally.

So ifc*s defending the act of asking questions and

presenting evidence at trial.
Now, if you're going to turn around and say 1983,

45
though, allows against State prosecutors, suits for the questions
they ask and the evidence they present at trial, then you've
undercut the defamation immunity. The only thing you can't be
sued for is defamation. So if you are private counsel, you are
homo free and clear, basically, because there's no other cause
of action will lie against you.
But if you8re; a State official, unhappily, you will be
subject to suits for everything you say or present at trial,
which me mis you can’t argue at trial without worrying about the
fear of suit.

And 1 think this case is a good case.? actually

it was an eight-day trial, and the type of things Judge
Ferguson found that were bo terrible that Mr. Pachtman did were
things where there was a statement that the witness said he
voluntarily committed himself to a mental institution.

And

this was discussed by the California Supreme Court in 1962, at
Appendix page 12 —»
QUESTIONs

You’re speaking now of the witness whose

testimony is —
MR. FARRELLS
QUESTION:

Right.

— alleged to have been presented improperly?

MR. FARRELL: Right.

And this is just an example, is

that the question of whether he was voluntarily or involuntarily
committed.
note 3.

That's discussed at both page 12 and page 22, Foot­

And the California Supreme Court concluded at the trial.,

however, Costello apparently only meant that he voluntarily

46

pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.

And, in fact, that’s

what h© says.
Now, this is aii eight"day trial, and the prosecutor
is supposed to pick up on the word "voluntarily".

Mr. Hanson,

1 am sure in good faith, forgot that these particular provisions
were in her© when he said that the mental capacity wasn't
discussed by the California courts.
It’s easy to make a mistake in a half-hour argument
on fzicts.

Here is the prosecutor, on a 1961 trial, going to

pick on questions like this.
Another claim by Judge Ferguson is that Costello said
h@ hadn’t seen mug shots but had seen a mug book of the *—
of Imbler, before he identified him at the lineup.

And he

admitted he had seen twelve pictures, including Irafaler’s, in
a. mug book.
Judge Ferguson said that wasn't a mug — therefore,
he falsely testified he hadn’t ssan rang shots.

Although he

admitted, in the same line of questioning, that he had seen a
mug book.
Now, these are the type of nit-picking questions,
in an eight-day trial, that can be brought up in a civil case
and called "knowing use; of false testimony".

I think we are weighing her© an enormous impact it

And if habeas corpus hearings

are going to decide the right to monetary compensation, I think
it would b@ only reasonable to assume a greater interest in
habeas corpus hearings by the civil attorneys for the people
who are going to be

represented there.

I have no doubt that

the county counsel, for instance, would want to start being
present, and the city attorney would want to start being
present,

;And some timer, that might be to the good, but it

certainly could slow up the habeas corpus writ, which has been

51
— the purpose of habeas corpus has been to decide lawful
custody,,
We would then be converting the writ to decide lawful
custody into a precondition for a civil suit* and you can*t do
that without having a ramification from the civil lawyers

He’s an executive in on© form or another.

And the grand'jury is to enforce

the law against him.
But what the prosecutor does in the courtroom* what

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK# ESQ. #
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. BORKs

Mr. thief Justice# and may it please the

Courts
The United States is interested in this case because
the outcome of it will quite likely affect the scope of the
immunity for federal prosecutors and may# in some sense# control
it.
I think the main points have been well canvassed by
counsel.

The problem of harassment that may occur to a

prosecutor# I think# is illustrated in some ways by this case
because we have seven judges on the California Supreme Court#
who thought that conduct her© did not deny petitioner’s
constitutional rights# and we have two federal courts who
thought it did.
And I think it’s fair to say that when judges differ
that substantially about -the nature ©f this conduct and what
it did to petitioner’s rights# it is fair to say that nobody
can be confident of the outcome of a jury case.
QUESTIONS

But that goes to the merits# does it

not# Mr. Solicitor General?
MR. BORKs

ently, but it's not one of my main points, in any evente so

What I would like to discuss is the conceptual
framework of the absolute immunity, and the qualified immunity,
and why I think this particular process requires an absoluta
immunity *
Petitioner's counsel has objected to this being
called a quasi-judicial immunity because a prosecutor is an

57

Executive Branch officer*
But X think the

there's no anomaly there — ‘the

categorization doesn't corae from the question of which branch
of government you're employed by, it comes from the process in
which you're engaged? the nature of the process in which on© is
engaged*

And this happens to be an Executive Branch employee

who was intimately involved in the judicial proe:ess, and it's
the appropriate immunity for -- is shaped by'the needs of the
process*
And X think that's why this is called a quasi”judicial
immunity? and that's why that absolute immunity which adheres
to judges has properly been held to adhere to prosecutors in

QUESTION?

Of course, Mr. Solicitor General, 'the

decision -the Court affirmed in Goff, Yaselli, would affirm the
judgment of the Court of Appeals that saw n© difference between
judges and other executive officers.
MR. BORKs

Well, there may be.

Thera has been a

doctrine of absolute immunity for other executive officers.
QUESTION? Which the Court of Appeals in Yaselli
espoused.
MR. BOEKs

Yes»

But I 'think that Scheuer indicates,

®nd Wood v. Strickland indicatas some difference, and I'm
suggesting for executive officers, at least in the State
context ~ and I*m suggesting that that difference between that
case and Pierson v. Ray or Yaselli v. Goff is justified by the
difference in the process.

And on© of those differences is,

as was said in the Schemer opinion, quoting from Mr. chief
Justice Hughes* that were there not judicial review in a
damage suit, there would be no way to feast the Governor's
performance in a courtroom.
And the fiat of the State Governor would b& the
Constitution, and not the Constitution, it's be the supreme
law.
That is not true her®,

h prosecutor's behavior is

63

testable in the courtroom# b©for® the jury, and testable on

testable ultimately, if one gets to that stage, upon a petition

QUESTIONS Aro you familiar with the Ninth Circuit's
holding on Ron an v. Rdblchaud?
MR. BORKs

X don't believe I am, Mr. Justice

Rahnquist.
QUESTIONs Well, that was a case where the prosecutor
had apparently collaborated, or it was alleged he had collabor­
ated in kind of third-degree methods in interrogating a witness.
Would you extend absolute immunity that far?
*

MR. BORKs There are cases that I think we need not
reach for purposes of this case, in which a prosecutor does
what is regarded as essentially a police function, as in
directing © raid, orin interrogating a witness.

And it’s

possible to draw that line*
I would, b© hesitant to draw it very easily, because
the connection between what h@ is going to do in the courtroom

There may be cases in which that lin® can b© drawn.

relevance in the various

States.
QUESTION* Well, don51. let m© hold you now.
MR, BOSKi

All right.

I think —

QUESTION:

You can debate it in the halls later.

MS. BORKs All right.
It should also be noted that the prosecutor has to
establish his case beyond a reasonable doubt to a unanimous
jury.

Should he be reversed on appeal for having done something

or acted collaterally, he will b© sued under a standard by which
a majority of ‘die jury may hold him liable on a preponderance
of the evidence.
And X think that's bound to hav® a deterrent effect,
as the prosecutor decides whether or not to go forward with the
case.
And, finally, I think it may be worth noting, and
I think it's true that acme courts would fo© a little loath, in
a close case, to decide that a defendant had been denied his
constitutional rights by a prosecutor, if that court knew that,
by doing so ha was exposing the prosecutor t© & lawsuit for
damages.
So -that it's not all clear that removing the absolute
immunity would help defendants? it might, in fact, hurt some
defendants on their habeas corpus proceedings.
In any event, for these reasons, we think the
absolute immunity, which a court has, a judge has, properly —

69

and a juror has — proparly belongs to a prosecutor as well.
Thar® are other sanctionsr other safeguiards in the judicial
process, not available elsewhere.

•

And for that reason, we think the judgment of the
Court of Appeals should be affirmed.
Thank you.
