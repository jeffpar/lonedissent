MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN ABBOT TUTTLE, ESQ»,
OH BEHALF gf the petitioner
MR. TUTTLE

z

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it pleas:©

the Courts
The issue in this case is whether the Federal Power
Commission has the statutory authority to reduce a public
utility's otherwise just and reasonable electric wholesale
rate because the utility allegedly maintains artifically
depressed and anticompetitive retail rates»
QUESTIONS

Mr» Tuttle, you didn't in your petition,

I know, raise the question of the finality of the Commission's
ruling that was reviewed by the Court of Appeals.
■i
■

From your own knowledge, is it a common practice

in agency proceedings, where a petition for intervention has
been partially granted and partially denied by 'the Commission,
for the party that is partially denied to run to the Court of
Appeals at that stage and seek to get it reviewed?
MR* TUTTLE:

It is not a common practice, and, of

course, when it occurs, the Commission's position would
ordinarily be, and indeed was in -fell© Court of Appeals, that

4
the issue was premature*
As you know , the Court of Appeals In this case
disagreed with that. argument which we made, indicated that, the
Commission had obviously reached a final conclusion as to this
issue, and that the interest of justice required the Court to
reach the issue at that juncture, because tha Commission had
made that ruling in a number of other cases, and the Court,
felt that there was no indication that any further elaboration
of that issue would help resolve tha question of the
Commission's power at that juncture.
The Court of Appeals having made that ruling and
having reached the merits of the case, we of course proceeded
to this Court, addressing the merits of the Commission’s
statutory power.
This litigation arose in June of 1973, when Arkansas
Power and Light filed with the Commission a wholesale rate
increase request, under Section 205 of the Federal Power Act»
Conway Corporation, the respondent her®, is a
wholesala customer of Arkansas Power, and intervened in tha
proceedings, alleging that the filing was made for anti™
competitive purposes.
Conway assarted that it competed with Arkansas Power,
its supplier, for direct sales of electricity to industry.
And Conway alleged that by raising the wholesale rate to it,
Phil© kasping the retail rate to industry low, Arkansas Power

s
was effectively squeezing Conway put of competition for the
direct industrial sales*
QUESTION t What is Conways s business?
MRo TUTTLE:
municipal electric.

Conway is a corporation — there is a
system in Conway, and Conway Corporation

manages it*
QUESTION:
MR* TUTTLE:

In -the municipality of Conway?
Yes.,

Conway urged that the increase be rejected or
reduced in, order to eliminate this price squeeze*
The Federal Power Commission rejected this sugges­
tion , concluding that the relief sought, the rejection or
reduction of the wholesale rate increase, was not within its
power to grant.
Under section 205 of the Federal Power Act, the
Ce-mission is charged with assuring the justness and reason­
ableness of wholesale electric rates in interstate commerce*
it has, however, no authority to set retail rates.
The Federal Power Commission concluded that it could
not., as Conway was suggesting, base the wholesale rate on the
nonjurisdictional retail rates*
The Commission said — and this occurs at page 53
tbs raosrci —» R Wholesale rates mus l recover allocated
whole?!ala costs*

Conway's suggested relief is a rat® not

related to wholsale costs but rather related to Arkansas

6
Power*s industrial rate»

However, that industrial rate,**

the Commission said, "is subject to the sole jurisdiction of
the State Commission and not the Federal Power Commission»*
The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the
Federal Power Coraitiission had a responsibility under Sections
205 and 205 of the Federal Power Act to remedy an alleged
*

discrimination between a jurisdictional wholesale rate and a
nonjuris-dictional retail rata, caused by — and these are the
Court's words — the utility's own decision to depress
certain retail revenues in order to curb retail competition
from its wholesale customers»
The operative statute here is Section 205(b) of the
Federal Power Act, which provides:
*No public utility shall, with respect to any trans­
mission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of -the Commission,
... maintain any unreasonable difference in rates, charges,
service, facilities, or in any other respect, either as between
localities or class of nervice**5
The scops of this provision and, most significantly,
the significance of the limiting language"with respect to any
transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the
Commission33 can only be understand with reference to the
legislativa history of the 19 35 Power Act and, perhaps more
important, the impact of this Court's 1914 decision in the
Shreveport case upon that legislative history*

7
Briefly # Shreveport involved the question of the
power of th© Interstate Commerce Commission under the
Interstate Commerce Act to remedy a discrimination between
jurisdictional wholesale railroad ratas

and nonjurisdictional

intrastate railroad rates set by the Texas Railroad Commission
Based on this Court's view of* the broad and
unexceptional language of tie antidiscrimination provisions in
the Interstate Commerce Act# this Court in 1914 concluded that
the Commerce Commission could require an increase of a non»
jurisdictional intrastate rate which discriminated against
interstate commerce.
The Shreveport case figured prominently in the 1935
debates# or hearings I should say# on the Wheeler-Rayburn bill
which# with modification# became the Federal Power Act of
1935.
Section 202 of the original bill# the forerunner of
Section 205, provided in pares

"No public utility should

establish or maintain any unreasonable difference as to rates#
charges# service# facilities# or in. any other respect, either
as between localities or as between classes of service.“
At the hearings on -the bill, the Solicitor of th©
Federal Power Commission, who was a draftsman of the bill#
was asked if the Shreveport case would apply.

If th© retail

rates were so low that for a company to exist it became
necessary ho charge exorbitant rates for its wholesale inter-

8
state business0
He argued that it would not apply to the- bill as
drafted, and maintained — and this is a quote;

"The intra­

state rate should be determined upon its reasonableness” —
excuse me, I misspoke.

"The interstate rate”, the jurisdic­

tional rate, "should be determined upon its reasonableness,
its reasonableness alone without regard to what the intra­
state rate is.”
Despite, these and other assurances as to the scops
of the Wheeler-Rayburn bill, the concern remained that owing
to the broad and unexceptional language of Section 202 —
that I've read to you *— that the Shreveport case might
nonetheless govern the 1aw if enacted in those terms.
Accordingly, the Act was amended, the bill was
amended, and the words added, which became the words of
Section 205.
Section 205, as enacted, provided;

"Nc public

utility shall’ — and these are the added words to which I
want to call you attention — "No public utility shall, with
reapsct to any transmission or sale subject to 'the jurisdiction
of the Commission ... maintain any unreasonable difference in
rates”, et cetera.
Following these amendments. Representative Cole,
who was the sponsor of the bill, stated;

"We have tried —

I think successfully — to avoid the interjection [sic] of

s
federal control „.. into intrastate activities in the way in
which the Shreveport case night permit."
This wording of -the Act has led Justice Jackson?
concurring in Colorado Interstate? to make the only statement
that a member of this Court has mad®, on precisely the issue
involved in this case.
And ha said? at. 324 U.S. ? at 615? "Th© Act forbids
discrimination only as between regulated rates and does not
forbid discriminations between the regulated and unregulated
ones c53
Despite this legislative history? the Court of Appeals
concluded that Section 205» as enacted? did not requires that
both rates involved in a pattern of discrimination fall within
the jurisdiction of the Commission*

The Court argued that if

Congress had intended to limit Section 205 to competitions
iterely between jurisdictional rates? it would have added to
the end of the section the following words;

"classes of

service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission."
'Rather than? as the Act reads? merely the words "classes of
service."
Thus ? according to the Court of Appeals, if the
Congress had wished to limit Section 205 to dis criminations
between jurisdictional sales? this is what it would have had
to have said:
"Ho public utility shall? with respect to any fcrans-

10

mission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission
«.. maintain any unreasonable differences in rates between
classes of service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commis­
sion 0 ”
Howeverp the repetition of the phrase "subject to thejurisdiction of the Commission" at the end of Section 205 is
obviously redundant, because., by its terms the statute is
already limited to "any transmission or sale subject to the
jurisdiction of the Commission.”
Based on Congress's failure to repeat this obviously
redundant phase., the Court of Appeals said that the Commission
was required to address the question or the issue of dis­
crimination between jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional rates»
Its only concession was to say that any sanction
imposed by the FPC to remedy an anticompetitive practice is
to be addressed to the jurisdictional rate.
QUESTIONS

What if the Court of Appeals had just

said the Commission could consider it, and not that it was
required to consider it? would you regard that holding as wrong?
MR, TUTTLE?

I would, Mr. Justice.

I think that the

-*• our principal analysis of the statute is that we are limited
in the matters that we are to concern ourselves with'with
matters which may not; be the subject of State regulation, and
our view of our statute is that the only discrimination which
we may address within the ambit of Section 205 and 206 is the

II
discrimination between jurisdictional rates.

And that is our

fundamental submission in this case.
QUESTIONS

But, Hr. Tuttle, is it not true that in

making the determination of reasonableness on the wholesale
rate, you do have to make some preliminary judgment as to
whether costs are properly allocated, do you not?
MR. TUTTLEs

Absolutely,

And ~

QUESTION: Does that not involve some inquiry into
the rate base for the retail rates?
HR. TUTTLEs

Well, it involves an allocation, as you

say, of cost, and there's no question that we may look to the
retail business, to the extent of determining teat tee whole»
sale rate and the wholesale rate payers are not being loaded
with more costs than would justify, according to the amount,
of investment which is put to that service.
QUESTION 5

But. you cay the statute makes it

impermissible for you to look and see ■— assume hypothetically
that the retail rates were much lower than the wholesale rates
and tee jurisdictional rates,, you couldn’t even consider that
fact in deciding whether the wholesale rates were reasonable.
That's your position, ac 1 understand it,
MR. TUTTLE:

My position is that the wholesale rate

has to look, at properly allocated wholesale costs.
QUESTIONS

But my example might suggest a suspicion

•that there's something wrong with the costs; couldn't you even

12
look at it for that, purpose?
MR. TUTTLE:

We can always look at the entire

company's businesst in order to determine that —
QUESTION s
HR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:
MRo TUTTLE:
relevant:.

Including rates
-- the costs are correctly allocated»
Including the retail rates?
I don't think the retail rate would be

I think the relevant issue would be the allocation

of the costs.
QUESTION:

What percentage of this company's busines

is retail and what percent wholesale?
MR. TUTTLE:

It's a hard thing to be absolutely

specific about, because it's hard to classify some of the
business? but between 80 and 90 percent retail --- the revenue
is 80 to 90 percent retail.
QUESTION: And you may not look at those rates at all
in performing your function, you say?
HR» TUTTLE:

We may look at the rate base and the

allocation of costs, but we may not look at that rate.

Our

job is to determine first what is properly allocated to —
in terms of cost to the retail —» to the wholesale business.
And then determine whether, or what is the appropriate rate of
return on that investment.
And that's what Congress has charged us with doing
here, as we read th.

statute.

13
QUESTIONS

Mr. Tuttles, if the facts are as alleged

by the interveners here , do they have any remedy at all for
the situation?
MR. TUTTLE; They have several remedies, in rriy view,.
Mr. Justice.

They have — of course, if this is an artificially

depressed retail rate, which, in my view, it has to be —
assuming -ill© allocations are correct.
QUESTION;

They artifically depress their rates

for 90 percent of their business in order to do this- then?
MR. TUTTLE;

I said — well, you see, I’m not saying

for a moment, Mr. Justice, that a price squeeze really exists
here.

Me are dealing with the face of the pleading that

alleges a price squeeze.
QUESTION;
wayss

And so I assume ~

But a price squeeze can rise in two

either by having extravagantly high rates in the

wholesale field and normal rates in retail? or vice versa.
And here, I assume, with 90 percent of the business in retail,
they probably didn't depress those rates? if anything, the
wholesale rates were too high.
MR. TUTTLE;

They probably didn’t depress any rates.

You see, my point is that it’s like ~~ I’m dealing with this
thing on the fgee of a pleading —~
QUESTION;
MR. TUTTLE;

On those rates„
~~ and I have to accept the allegation

that there is a price squeeze and an unlawful price squeeze,

14
because* the respondent says so, and we refused to hear their
argument.
QUESTIONs

All right®

Excepting that, what, is their

remedy?
HR. TUTTLEI Well, first of all, I'd like to address
the question of the fact that it, you say, could occur from a
artificially inflated wholesale rate0

And I’ll come to that

in a moment; but the point I’d like to make just initially
is that our ordinary ratemaking standards with respect to the
wholesale rate would forbid inflated wholesale rates and
inflated wholesale costs, without looking to the issue of dis­
crimination,,
So it’s .not going to arise under our own standard,
it’s not going to arise on the wholesale side.
QUESTION:

Assuming you've done an adequate job of

investigating the company and the total cost picture, but —
MR. TUTTLEs

Yes, but we accept our responsibility

and it. hasn’t bean questioned in this case that we have.
QUESTION; But now answer ray questions

What is their

remedy?
MR® TUTTLE: Well, their remedy, assuming that I am
right, that the rate is caused by a depressed retail rate,
of course that is a matter subject to the jurisdiction of the
State Commissions, and they could intervene in rate proceeding
in the rState Commission and allege that it’s an improper

15

remedyo
QUESTION; Do they have standing?

Because they’re not

— they have no interest in that rate any more than

don’t

they have the same problem there?
MR, TUTTLE;

No, because that would be a rate

that if our other assumptions are correct,, is a rate that11 s
artificially low, and anticompetitive,
retail

And although the

the State Commission might say, Well, we have to

look at our rate and our rate by itself, and I would say they
would be right in saying that,
QUESTION; Well, let me just back up to be sure I
understand you.

Assume there's no pending State proceeding

before the Arkansas State Commission, what do they do, do
they go in
MR, TUTTLE;
QUESTION;

They male© a complaint,
They file a complaint with the State

Commission and say that you used to cause the utility to
charge higher prices?
MR, TUTTLE; That’s one remedy.
Of course, another remedy, you must —
QUESTION;

K.as that aver been successful?

I've

never heard of such a case, but —
MR, TUTTLE;

I don't

know

I know there have been

interventions in -QUESTION;

Yes, but that’s not our example, that’s —

16

our problem is they don't have such a pending proceeding under
our hypothesis,
MR* TUTTLE;
proceeding?

Does Conway now have such a pending

No,

QUESTION;

No*

What does Conway do about the

problem it alleges exists if there's no pending Arkansas State
proceeding?
MR» TUTTLE;

It could file a complaint, alleging

that the rate is improper,
Justice*

And that's only one remedy, Mr,

It would seem that under tie ordinary standards

of the antitrust law, that if an aridfically —' if there is a
price squeeze caused by a manufacturer artificially raising
the rate to his wholesaler in order to squeeze his wholesaler
out of business for retail business, that would be a violation
of the antitrust laws,
QUESTION; But would not the utility have a complete
-defense, because both of those rates are compelled by
regulatory agencies, and. then wouldn' t Parker v* Brown apply?
MRo TUTTLE;

That's a very interesting question,

and my suggestion is that probably Packer v. Brown would not
govern,

Porker v. Brown, of course you. — this Court knows,

and is currently considering the Detroit Edison case, which
will address the question of just exactly what the impact of
a State-ordered rate would be.
But my analysis would be that this case falls between

17
somewhere between the act of sovereignty which is immune from
the antitrust laws under Parker v„ Brown,, and the State allowed
anticompetitive conductr which was held not to be.a defense
of the antitrust lavas under the Goldfarb case»
Because there's no indication that there is any
State policy her© favoring an anticompetitive, an artificially
low and anticompetitive rate» and I think proof of that would
be that the Arkansas Power has in fact filed rate increases
since the

beginning of these proceedings in Arkansas, and they

have been processed and they have been granted»
So my judgment would be that there is no State
policy here requiring this rate»
QUESTIONS

If you assume a situation in which the

rat®# the State rate has been approved by the State agency,
isn't that a sufficient expression of State policy?
MR. TUTTLE:

Weil, -that — if the State looks at

the rate — you see, the way Arkansas works is more or less
like —
QUESTION:

I assume they don't approve it

without

looking at it«
MR0 TUTTLE: Well, they do in this sense;

that

Arkansas is like the federal government, in that one files a
rate end it can become effective under suspension with the
posting of a bond before a ruling is made upon its justness
and reasonableness»

If it turns out that after a complete

18
analysis of the State rate filing, the State determines that
this is indeed a compensatory rate and one that they wish to
impose, and there remains a price squeeze, where the federal
side has been through its process and determined that, the
wholesale rate is just and reasonable under federal standards?
and the process has been completed on the State side and there
is this State finding of justness and reasonableness on the
State side and there, nonetheless, remains a differential»
That5s simply a fact of life,

I don't — it's by

hypothesis that, there’s no violation of law»
QUESTIONs

And the plaintiff has no remedy then»

And the answer is the plaintiff has no remedy — or
the intervenor has no remedy»

Because I suppose they cannot

look at the wholesale rate any more than you can look at
the retail rat®?
MR» TUTTLE :

I would agree ~ oh, but only if the;

process has gone through the'point of the State determining
that this is indeed the rate that they think ought to be
applied,,
QUESTION:

With the rate filed, they had an

investigation, they didn't'*•- they let it go into effect?
That's the normal procedure. isn't it?
TR» TUTTLEs

If — if — if the allegation were that

it simply -rent, into effect, without an investigation, it
would seem to me that under the antitrust laws, the doctrine

19
of Parker v„ Brown would not: create an immunity and one could
perhaps achieve a remedy in federal court»
Of course, not. all problems have remedies and not
all problems with respect to this situation necessarily have
remedies in the federal system.

We have a responsibility to

assure that the wholesale rate is just and reasonable, and
the remedy for this discrimination, if ~~ and the only thing
it could be in my judgment is an artificially depressed
retail rat® lies with the State that's allowing that, circum­
stance to obtain»

And if the State doesn’t do it, it's

because they’re not doing their job, not because we're not
doing ours.
We think that beyond the jurisdictional limitations
that I've mentioned, that the remedy suggested by the Court
of Appeals is addressed to the wrong rate, and, in any
event, is an inadequate remedy»
We've already discussed, in ray discussions with
Justice Stevens, the fact -that a
three ways s

squeeze might arise in

either from an inflated wholesale rate, or a

depressed retail rate, or something that was an end product
of analysis of both rates.
And I have assumed that, as the Court of Appeals
dir, that the dircrimination alleged here is caused, or
alleged to be caused by an artificially depressed retail
rata «

I make that assumption because, as I have indicated.

20
our ordinary standards of ratemaking would require us, in the
first instance, to determine that the whole.costs are not
artificially inflated, and thus that no price squeeze caused
by artificially inflated wholesale rates could ever arise.
So the price squeeze, if it exists at all, exists
by virtue of an artificially depressed retail rate»
It’s our view that that of course is a rate over
which w© have no jurisdiction»

That's my first point that 1

wish to make with the Court.
But, in any event, it. seems to me that the ordinary
federal standards of ratemaking would forbid us to remedy this
discrimination by lowering the wholesale rate, which is the
remedy that the Court of Appeals suggested, and the remedy
that Conway has suggested.
Because the wholesale: rate has to recover allocated
wholesale costs, and the relief that Conway suggests, the
reduction of the wholesale rate, is not related to wholesale
costs but it's related to retail rates.
This Court, in the Shreveport case, in discussing
circumstances where the Court found the power to address a.
discrimination between a jurisdictional and a nonjurisdictional
rate, held that that situation cannot be remedied by
sacrificing federal standards of r&temaking.
said — and this is at 234 U.S. 255

And the Court

"It is clear that in

removing the injurious discriminations against- interstate

21
traffic arising from the relationship of the intrastate to
the interstate rates, Congress is not bound to reduce the
latter below what it may deem to be a proper standard,”
■Thus, our obligations are to assure a just and
reasonable jurisdictional rate.

And we're not in a position,

and we're not allowed under our ratemaking responsibilities,
to sacrific that rate in order to remedy a discrimination
caused by &n anticompetitive nonjurisdictional rate.
The Court of Appeals suggested that this whole
problem of not being able to lower the wholesale rate might
be avoided by reference to its concept of a gone of reasonable
wholesale rates, and suggested that we might reduce the
wholesale rate to the lower range of the zone of reasonable­
ness, and therefore have sows effect on the price squeeze
situation,
We don't think that there is an adequate zone, or a
zone in wholesale ratemaking which allows us to effectuate
this

kind of remedy.

In setting rates, the Commission is

required to set a rate which will assure adequate and
reliable electric power at the least cost, while maintaining
the financial integrity of the utility.
'.in setting that rate, -the Commission does not
locale a zone of reasonable.rates and then select a rate
within the zone? rather, it. attempts to find the just and
reasonable rats.

It evaluates items of cost, such as plant

22
investment, fuel costs, labor and management expenses,
capital costs, depreciation and taxes.
measurable figures.

These are knowablet

They can and should be precisely

quantified, and their evaluation does not create a zona of
re as onab lenes s.
The only zone of reasonableness that might be found
in utility ratemaking is the range of potentially appropriate
rates of return on that investment rate base, specifically
rat© of return on common equity.
But we don’t think that here is an appropriate place
to make an

adjustment because of allegations of anticompeti­

tive conduct.
The Commission must select a rate of return which
is commensurate with the risks associated with investment,
which will maintain the existing investment, which will
attract new investment at a reasonable cost.
hud we think that it doesn’t make sens® to select
■chafe rata on any other grounds than those criteria stated,
because, of allegations of anticompetitive conduct.
But our fundamental contention is that Justice
Jackson was right when he .'said, in the Colorado Interstate
case, “The Act forbids discrimination only as between
regulated rates and docs not forbid discriminations between
the regulated and unregulated ones.”
And.we doift think that this conclusion creates a.

23
regulatory gap requiring the Court, to expand on the plain
words of Section 205»
I’ve already addressed the possibilities of remedy*
but I also think it’s worth noting that a price squeeze is
an unlikely event in the nature of things»
As I’ve indicated, the Commission’s ordinary rate­
making standards with respect to wholesale rates assure that
there will be no artificially inflated wholesale rates? so
'that no price squeeze caused by such rates could arise»
Moreover,, in an' industry where 80 to 90 percent of
th© business comes from retail revenues* it seems unlikely
teat a truly anticompetitive rats would be created or main­
tained on the retail side»
Of course* if if. does* if this does happen* there is
another remedy, Mre Justice Stevens, I didn’t mention?
Congress can expand upon the powers of the Commission and*
in fact* tear© are currently pending four separate bills
addressed to Congress’s responsibility with respect to unfair
methods of competition»
Alternatively* of course, as I have suggested,
there may be remedies before the Stats Commission or
remedies under the antitrust laws.
Accordingly, I submit that the judgment of the
Court of Appeals should be reversed»

you:

But. a problem can arise —
Now* just let ms- ask

Is there any evidence in this* in these papers that

you have filed her©* as to what -the views of the Antitrust

QUESTIONz
Whit®3s question.

Mr. Tuttle, let me supplement Justice
Does the law make the Solicitor General

the exclusive representative of the Power Commission in this
Court — not the authorized, the exclusive?

That is, when

•they coma here alone.
MR. TUTTLES
Justice.

I think that it does, Mr. Chief

1 think that in circumstances where the Solicitor

General wishes to, he may authorize an independent regulatory
agency, with litigating powers, such as cur own, to file our
own pa id tion? which is what he did in this case.
QUESTIONS

Thank you.

QUESTION:

Supplemental Memorandum?
For the United States.

The Solicitor

he?
MR. TUTTLE:
talking about.

I'm not sure what document you're

What case do we have?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C0 McDIARMID, ESQ

0,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR„ McDIARMID£

Mr* Chief Justice* and if it please

•the Court:
There is a serious question in tills proceeding*
and it's a good deal broader* I think* than the question as
stated by the FPCo
Looked at most broadly* I think * the question here
is one of how the Federal Power Commission fits into the
picture of the societal control of -the basic economic structure
of the society„
It's vary plain that sales of electricity have been*
sine© the inception thereof* regulated in one form or another
either at common law* as common carriers of public utilities
at common law? or by agencies set up by either States or
federal governments
The FPC's position here is one of what I would
characterise as being selective myopia? they're looking at a
particular portion of a particular section of the statuta*
I think misreading it* without attempting to see how it fits
into the structure at large or into the whole set of their
statute*
And I have here *•» I hop® I may be forgiven for

saying so — a erase of view three years ago* I stood here
while the FPC was saying similar things in the Gulf States

28

case.
Thera it said that it didn't have to worry about
anticompetitive problems under Section 204 of the Federal
Fewer Act* because it could deal with such problems by treating
the actual px'oblems when they occurred* the acts

of the

company rather than the finances»
That Court

that case was while review was being

had of a decision of the court below here* the same court»
Also unanimous„
In that, case* the majority of this Court agreed
that the FPC did have the responsibility to look at what it
then, claimed was nonjurisd:Lccional problems* anticompetitive
problem* and to deal with it within the context of Section
204.
•The minority of this Court;* in a decision written by
Mr. Justice Powell* agreed that the Commission had the
responsibility to deal with anticompetitive problems when the
problem was presented to it in the course of a case where the
conduct was being challenged* such as ratemaking.
We thought -the FPC’s position at that time was
something of a shell game* in trying to find jurisdiction
somewhere else* without quite saying where it was * and w©
think it's similar here.
The Conway Corporation is a corporation which was
set up during the 19305s in order to raise some money that:

29
couldn’t be raised under Arkansas law to bail out two colleges,
Your Honor.

It's a city-owned corporation®

It and the other

eight customers here are all publicly owned®
Mr. Tuttle asserts that the problem here must some­
how be one of discriminatorily low retail rates.
We’ve stated at some length the problems that we
see with the Federal Eower Commission’s regulations and why
•that isn’t so.

Perhaps it’s stated best? however? by an

amicus brief? which we received, I believe, yesterday, filed
by Commonwealth Edison, to which we’re happy to consent,
incidentally»
As they pointed out, there are at least a ..dozen
methods, accepted methods of ratemaking, differential
allocations, differential assumptions of rates®
The FPC, for example, sets rates on the basis of
estimates of cost, not actual cost, but estimates of cost
mad© by the company in advance, a year in advance.

Most

State Commissions do not? Arkansas does not.
The FPC may or may not be allotting various kinds
of tax normalizations.

That’s not too clear.

Most State

Commissions do not.
There are lots of tilings like this that are spelled
out in some detail in our brief.
But the fact of the matter is that it’s very easy
for a power company to file a higher rate at -the FPC? the FPC

30
does not typically do anything with it in the near-term future?
•this rate was filed in 1973»

Hearings are not comple tec

We've had three judges.
moved on ‘to better things.

One is retired, one has

And that's not uncommon.

Recently

-the FPC decided a rate case filed in January 1970 , and they
decided that in August of last year.
QUESTION s

Welly of course , your tactic here of

appealing to the Court of Appeals on an interlocutory motion
isn't really designed to expedite the final decision of this
sort of case*, is it?
MR. McDlARMIDt
final

Oh* I think not, Your Honor, the

the case has been processed in as expeditious a

manner as we could, at the same time that -this was going ahead.
I assure you we would like very much to get some money back.
We'v© been paying all this time.
Tth&h we contended, originally, was that there is a
historic responsibility and a statutory responsibility of the
JPC to avoid discrimination.

We said this was a discrimina­

tion case.
As a discrimination case, there is a fast procedure
for dealing with these matters.

Not one where we are now

paying the second pancake rate increase, without any judgment
as to the first®

The Arkansas Commission has had two findings

on the two cases which have been filed there.
them both down

They've cut

31
What.

11 ve said, that this is a discrimination case,

and in a discrimination case you can go ahead very quickly,
you can decide if there appears to be discrimination, as
there plainly does here»

You can require the company to

show cause why that discrimination should not be ended, and
end it there®
Then you can go on to have the rest of the hearing,
eliminate the discrimination, if there is still a rate increases
pending, go ahead and

hold -the rest of the hearing on that»

That we can survive*
What we can*t survive P and it is not an uncommon
problem, this problem has been raised at the PPC and probably
in a dozen cases since 1973»

We cannot survive the situation

where the company charges a much lower retail rate than its
wholesale rate.

And I'm talcing into account the assumption

that the cost justification for the difference is taken into
account.
QUESTION:

But that's really the merits of your case,

isn’t it?
MR® McDlARMID:

Yes, it is.

3ut in this case, Your Honor, the Commission had
decided that this was not a dis crimination case, they would
not cisal with it, they would not allow us to collect informstion on it, they would not allow us to put on a case on it®
They wouldn’t deal with it»

32
And if fch© Commission is going -- if we're going to
wait until after the Commission spends five years hearing the
case , then go to court, then spend the three years that this
has taken, for example, to get that issue decided, than go
back, nobody is going to be alive who paid that, and these
cliente of mine are going to be out of business„
Thera is a very real and vary present problem, and a
serious one»
Mow, we pleaded hare a discrimination in historic
terms? w@ also pleaded a discrimination in price squeeze terms
under the Sherman Act- under the Alcoa and Smithsrn Photo
line of cases <,
The FPC concedes for this purpose, for the purpose of
this case, that that must he the basic upon which this decision
is made? and I think, in fact, that we will have no problem
proving it.»
But the Commission urges that it has no jurisdictionI find it vary difficult to follow its reading of
the statute»

One way in which the statuta could easily have

been written by Congress, if it meant what the FPC said it
meant, is if it had written it the same way th© FPC quoted
it in its application for certiorari in this case —•» misquoted?
just adding an V,

But. the Commission isn't claiming that

ary more»
But this is an element of a very historic kind ©f

33
control.

Originally, monopolies of "this type were controlled

by common law.

The most common problem that arose at ccaramon

law was when the*® was discrimination, and the courts found
no problem in those cases, in saying?
end the discrimination.

It is very simple, just

Where you donet have to worry about

what the costs are, and the discrimination; raise both rates,
car lower them both.
The Sherman Act providas for a remedy under the anti­
trust laws

treble damage, not single damage.
The Robinson-Patraan Act, if it applies, 'would pro­

vide for a treble-damage remedy.
Under Part I of -the Federal Power Act, the original
Water Peer Act of 1920, it is very clear that the Federal
Power Commission would have had jurisdiction to deal with this
discrimination, and this discrimination precisely.

If there

were no state Commissions.
Arkansas Power and Light is a licensee of the
nation*s water resources.

Part I plainly makes a licensee

subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission
to avoid discrimination.
And that jurisdiction terminates as fco those matters
for which a State provides a regulatory agency to deal, but
only as to those matters.
The Commission and Arkansas say that there is no
State agency to deal with this discrimination, and 'they say

34
the Federal Power Commission can't, either*

We think that’s

wrong *
Prior to 1827, when this Court decided the Attleboro
case, it; seemed clear that a State Commission could resolve
this discrimination problem*

In Attleboro, this Court decided

'that the so-called Attleboro gap existed, that the States
could not control sales at wholesale for resale*
'She Federal Power Commission was, in 1935, as part of
the Public Utilities Act of 1935, given the responsibility to
deal with the matters which had been left open by -this Court
in Attleboro, or opened.
This Court has said, on numerous occasions

most

frequently, FPC_v*_ Florida Power and Light, also in FPC v*
Southern California. Edison ~~ that Congress intended fully
to plug the so-called Attleboro gap, to fill that responsibil­
ity*
But th© FPC here says no, they don’t*
Mr* Tuttle’s position is sort of strange, I am not
quite sure that I follow it*

I understand him to say that th©

FPC has exclusive jurisdiction over wholesale rates.

And

therefor©, I presume, that, he will argue that we cannot attack
the wholesale rates as being part of a price squeeze, if we
go into antitrust crout, where w© resist to go.
Th© State Commission would undoubtedly urge that
Parker v« Brown applied? certainly if it applies to light bulbs».

35

it applies to rates.
This Court has before it the question of whether it
applies to light bulbs ? and how far it goes? in the Detroit
Edison case.
But suppose we were to go to court, under the -.'.anti­
trust laws?

The court would presumably award us damages and

continuing damages to the extent of the discrimination,
--** substanc©? therefore? we would be going to court
to get the damages which the PPC could have awarded us? because
of the differential in ratos? the discrimination.
That seems a rather roundabout way? and an unnecessary
burden upon the courts? to do something which the PPC has the
expertise to do,
lr the suggestion ■ is that we should go to court
and we get an order directing the company or the state
Commission to raise the rates? then we8re doing by indirection
precisely what the people who objected to the original draft
of Part IX? in 1935? objected to.
Judge Hooker from the State Corporation Commission
n Virginia? in 1935? objected — and it’s in our brief —
that if that language was not changed? the FPC would have the
authority that the ICC had had to coma into Virginia? or any
statea and foros» i* to raise* the retail rates.

And that was

why — I think a reading of the legislative history makes it
quit® clear that that8 s why — toe amendments that were made

36
were made to prevent the FPC from directly going in and
requiring retail rates to be raised.
Mr. Tuttle8 s solutions would apparently have us do
that indirectly by a court order.

There are constitutional

problems with that as wall, but I don51 think we need get into
those.
Sora© of the amici says we should go to the state
agencies and ask them to raise the rates•
a standing problem.

There is, indeed,

We have tried this for a couple of our

clients in other cases,

mid we have been thrown out.

Indeed,

in the Arkansas case, some of our clients here attempted to
intervene for lira!ted purposes, and were allowed to intervene
for very limited purposes ? much more limited than we would be
allowed.
But the problem is we don't think that the State
agencies are wrong in the way they set rates.

The FPC 'is

prepared to allow much higher rates, and prepared to do it on
a different basis, than the State Commission.

And the cities

believe that they have a responsibility to their citizens,
as well, and to other citizens.
And we don't believe it’s our responsibility, we
don't belisive it's right to go to court and says

Arkansas

Power and Light, raise your retail rates.
We have no problem with

the way the Arkansas Phblie

Service Commission is setting those rates.

Our problem is

37
with the FPCo
The PPC suggests that there is a magic to the way it
sets wholesale rates«

But that's easily answered»

If there

were? as there are in some instances? two wholesale rates?
one by Arkansas Power and Light to an affiliate? which then
sold at retail in the area where it sells and one to us ?
the FPC would have no problem with sayings

Lower the higher

rate? or raise them both; and th© discrimination.

End the

discrimination and then set a just and reasonable rat®.
But end the discrimination firsts
In this case? they say? well? somehow or another?
there is a magic to th® way we set a just and reasonable rata?
and waell get to it five or six years down th® road? and
you'll then be saved.

Maybe.

But we won’t do anything about

the discrimination„
That’s not a satisfactory answer? or we don’t find
it a satisfactory answer.
The FPC was set up to fill the Attleboro gap? not
to reopen it.
Before the Attlaboro decision? we wouldn’t have had
the discrimination problem.
Nowhere in the legislative history is there any
suggestion that it was intended to reopen this kind of a gap?
to leave us hanging out there? exposed to the worst kind of
dis crimination

38
QUESTION?

But I thought the gap -- I thought; the

gap was power over wholesale rates»
MR» McDIARMlDs
to —” excuse

Indeed^ Your Honor»

The gap as

hi®»

QUESTION s

That gap was closed by Part II of the

Act»
MR» McDIARMlDs

Was it?

If it was closed; Your

Honor; where is our protection against discrimination?
QUESTIONS

Well; you9ve got protection against

unreasonable wholesale rates»
MR» McDIARMlDs We hav© protection against what the
FPC decides are unreasonable wholesale rates, after tee FPC
finally decides it, five years down the road»
QUESTIONs Well, —
MR» McDIARMlDs
QUESTION!

If we* re still around»

Well, teat's their job»

MR® McDIARMlDs

It may be their job, Your Honor,

but we say teat before the gap was open, we had protection
against discrimination in the interim, while people were
deciding what the reasonable wholesale, or retail rate was»
After that decision, we didn’t,»

Unless we go to

court*
The FPC seams to say, plainly says, they can’t give
us teat protection®
QUESTION2 Well, tee lack of protection against

39
discrimination, you suggest, was part of the so-called gap.
MRo McDIARMlDs

Yes, Your Honor,

When the gap was opened — prior to the time the gap
was opened, all such sales were .thought by most States to be
regulated by them.

They were

I don't know of any State

agency that does not have a discrimination provision in its
charter.

That's the very element, the very basic element of

regulation of utility rates or, indeed, of anything else in
the kind of required monopoly service in the society,
QUESTIONs

By the way, if you were going to try to

seek an antitrust remedy, what antitrust law would you think
might be relevant?
MR, McDIARMlDs

In Parker v. — well, the first,

MR® McDXARMIDs

And tli®re you have the Montana-

Dakota Utilities case., which this Court decided in 1947, I

Okay®

Then what, about the —• especially if

the FPC claims it has no authority whatsoever®
MR® McDXARMID:

I don't understand it to be tsaying

Mi at, quits, Your Honor®

They said a vary carefully phrased

thing.

They have said, in a footnote to their main brief,

41
that they have exclusive authority over wholesale rates.
But that we can go through again about the low
retail rates, what they have emphasized.
QUESTION3

But this aspect of the wholesala rate#

they -- whether it's discriminatory or not, they said they
have no authority over.
MR. McDIARMIDs

They certainly say they have no

authority over it.
QUESTIONS

They certainly do.

And so Parker v,

grown, which is only talking about State authority anyway,
doesn't worry you — it wouldn't bother you very much with the
Sherman II, would it?
MR. McDIARMIDs
QUESTION;

No.

Not if the —

It might bother the court, though.

MR. McDIARMIDs

It might.

[Laughter. ]
MR. McDIARMIDs

Not if the primary qu@st.ion is the

wholesale issue, and this Court mad© clear that the wholesale
problem is not precluded.
.The second problem, however, is on© of costs.
Nov, I do not suggest for one minute that FPC
proceedings are cheap.
QUESTION;

Or fasto

MR. McDIARMIDs
[Laughter. ]

Or fast.

MR, McDlARMID:

Neither, however, are Sherman II

cases o
Now, Arkansas Power and Light, in its current filing,
claims something Ilk© $80,000 for regulatory expanses for
the year, which they want us to pay of course, for their
wholesale case,

And we have to pay that.

The FPC will charge

it. to US e
There are other things, probably, in there, too.
In companies that; break it out entirely of regulatory expense,
I've seen it as high as $500,000 a year,
Jntarvanors have to spend money, too? not quit® at
*4

that rat©, thank God? but they’re still expensive.

But

•they aren’t as expensive as treble”damage cases.
The other problem, I think, is really on© of the
proper function for the courts.

As I was beginning to say,

the States and the federal government found, beginning with
the Act to regulate commerce in the 1890‘s, that regulation
by court: of rather technical and detailed and long problems
with cost justification were taking an awful lot of time,
were not something with which the courts had or wanted any
particular expertise,
The Arkan£;_as__Pcwer ^and Light case, on cost justifica­
tion, is now in thirty-odd days, I guess, of hearing.
Some of them hava gone as long as seventy, at the FPC? and
on not. inappropriate questions,

43
Til at's not a kind of burden I would want to ssa
imposed on 'the court system„
At the rate the problems sr® piling up at the FPCV
which does have the expertise,, whatever else it doss or
doesn't have* I think it is plain that we would put a tremen­
dous burden upon the district court system, and on© which 1
don't think very many district judges would like to bear, or
should be asked to bear®
Your Honor, it5s a very serious problem»
there's an easy answer to it»
of Appeals below gave.

We think

It's the answer that the Court

We don't think in its entirety.

In traditional discrimination terms, the rang© of reasonable­
ness, whatever it may be, is not the whole answer; the PPC
claims there is no range of reasonableness.
My colleague just handed me a case where the FPC
said there is a range of reasonableness; we're picking the
higher range, the higher end of the range.

Just after Conway

cam® down.
The FPC is the place that has the authority to deal
with it, it's the place that's set up to deal with it, it can
deal with it fairly rapidly on ths traditional kind of
discrimination basis.
We ask you. Your Honors, to close the gap the FPC
wishes to open, which we thought was closed in 1935»
Thank you
