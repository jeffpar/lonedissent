MR., CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Nos.74-175 and 74-15® consolidated» Miiidendorf
against Henry»
Mr» Sahm, you may proceed whenever" you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN R. ZAHM, ESQ.
MR. 3AHM:

Mr. Chief Justice.

the Court

please s
Since these consolidated cases ar® her© on
reargument today» it would seen unnecessary and more
expeditious to refrain from repeating the facts of the case»
which are undisputed and are relatively simple.
Suffice it to say that in a routine manner the
Petitioners, members of the Marine Corps, were up on charges
on courts-martial.

Flv® of them were convicted and

incarcerated as a result.

Three others were facing courts-

martial and sought relief by way of injunction to prevent it.
Now, we ask this Court to affirm that the Sixth
Amendment guarantee of assistance of counsel in criminal
prosecutions, which was this Court's principal basis for its
ruling in Argersinger versus Hamlin in 1972, also applies
to parsons in military service.
Every court that has ever considered the question
including the Court of Military Appeals, in United States
versus Culp, United States versus Tempia in 1967 and more

recently, United States versus Alderman in 1973# has so
held# with a single exception, that being the Ninth Circuit
in the case of Dagle versus Warner, which has sufficient
pending here, sub nQm Crosby versus Warner.
Now, the Federal Parties have asked this Court
for the first time ever to overrule the United States Court
of Military Appeals on this issue in favor of a single
civilian court’s view, despite this Court's repeated
recognition over the years and repeated only last year in
Schlsslnger versus Councilman, that Coina is the court
established by Congress to gain, over time, thorough
familiarity with military problems.
Now, for this Court to do so would undermine the?.
Court of Military Appeals’ vary significant role as! the
Supreme Court of the Military, which it has been designated
to ba.
Now, the only basis for the Ninth Circuit's
holding on this question of the Sixth Amendment's application
to the military is based on a single historical treatise?
specifically, Wiener's Harvard haw Review article in 1958.
Now, this despite the fact that there was another
equally authoritative historical treatise in the Harvard
Law Review the preceding year by Henderson on the identical
question with exactly the opposite conclusion from that
reached by Wiener.

But the Ninth Circuit chose to go along

5
with Wiener, despite the fact that the Court of Military
Appeals and every other court before whom the question has
been raised, with both those articles presented to the
courts for their consideration, have chosen Henderson instead,
if they chose any.
Now, with regard to tha reliance on history for
constitutional interpretation, where the documentation is
inconclusive and disputable, Mr. Chief Justice Burger,
dissenting with Mr. Justice Blaekmun and Mr, Justice Rshnquist, just last term, on June 30th, stated in the ease of
Peraf.ta Versus California, and I quote, "Like Mr. Justice
Blackmun, I hesitate to participate in th© Court’s attempt
to use history to take it where legal analysis cannot,

\y

piecing together shreds of English legal history and early
state constitutional and statutory provisions without a full

: •
• .•{[,

elaboration of the context in which they occurred or any
evidence that they were relied on by the drafters of our
Federal Constitution creates more questions than it answers
and hardly provides the' firm foundation upon which the
creation of new constitutional rights should rest and, more
pertinent, we are well-reminded that this Court once
employed an exhaustive analysis of English and colonial
practices regarding the right to counsel to justify tha
conclusion that it was fundamental to a fair trial arid less
than ten years later, used essentially the same material

6
to conclude that it was not.
"Compare Powell versus Alabama and Betts versus
Brady."
I think that that should .be kept in mind when we
are considering whether or not a fundamental question like
this should be decided, as the Ninth Circuit did, on a
single documentation which is in dispute.
Now, aside from the disputed historical documenta­
tion on the question, logic demands acceptance of the view
but the framers of the Constitution did not intend to accept
the Sixth Amendment from applicability to the military
service by silence because they specifically wrote in an
express exception in the Fifth Amendment with regard to
presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury.
That is the position of the Court of Military
Appeals which has considered the matter.
The United States versus Jacoby in 1960 and
United States versus Tempia in 1967 so we don't need this
historical documentation which is in dispute.

Logic explains

to us, as the Court of Military Appeals has pointed out,
that if the• framers / intended an exception, they would have
i

done what they did with the Fifth.

They 'would have written

/

it in.
Now, this Court in Parker versus Leavey in 1974
implicitly affirmed the impact of Burns versus Wilson some

7
20 years ago,
.That, quoting from United States versus Tempia,
"The protections of the Constitution are available to
servicemen in military trials."
Now, this Court, in Parker, held — as the Court
of Military Appeals had previously held and recognized by
virtue of the Priest case that was involved in the Parker
case that the constitutional guarantees may be applied
differently to servicemen where military necessity requires
it.

In other words, where it can be shown and the burden

is on the military to show it, that it requires a somewhat
different application as applied to military men than as
applied to civilians.
Nov, the Court of Military Appeals knew that full
well, as they indicated by their holding in Priest with
regard to the issue of the First Amendment rights there
involved and so it is nothing new to the Court of Military
Appeals that there is such a doctrine that where military
necessity requires it the Constitutional guarantees may be
applied somewhat differently.
But the point is that in this case, which does not
involve the First Amendment but involves the Sixth Amendment
where the Court of Military Appeals recognizing this concept
of military necessity, has considered the issue, has decided
that there is no military necessity for a ruling which would

8
deny to men in service their Sixth Amendment rights of
assistance to counsel.
I think that on this question of military necessity
which the federal parties have laid such great stress upon,
that the Ninth Circuit stated it most succinctly in their
decision in Dagle versus Warner, which is Crosby versus
Warner, petition pending in this Court.
And I am quoting from the Ninth Circuit decision,
"While the Navy argues with some vigor that naval discipline
will suffer severely if appointed counsel are required, there
is scant support of this in the record.
"The Army and Air Force already provide counsel
to fill accused before summary courts-martial and the Navy
i

allows private retained counsel to participate in such
proceedings.
"The Navy suggests that the effectiveness of a
summary

cdurt-martial as a tool for

preserving discipline

and order will be undermined by the participation of counsel.
If so, this must already be true- as to those defendants who
can afford retained counsel."

End quote from that opinion.

Now, aside from the argument with regard to
military necessity, I think this also points out that it is
a refutation of the argument also made that affording counsel
to men in service disrupts some Congressional scheme which
specifically, according to the federal parties, is designed

9

not to provide counsel to men in service at summary courtsmartial .
Now, the fact is that when Congress adopted the
Military Practices Act in 1968, the decision of this Court
in Argorsinger had not yet been rendered, which was in 1972
so it is fairly clear that if Congress had knovm that this
Court considered, for the first time, mind you, that petty
offensos required assistance of counsel, they might have
considered differently when passing that act in 1968 and
the net, effect — the net effect as it stands now is that,
yes , counsel, retained counsel by those servicemen who can
afford retained counsel, are permitted to have counsel at
summary courts-martial..
The practical result is that those who do not
have counsel because they are not afforded counsel in
summary courts-martial, are the poor, the indigent, the
enlisted man of the lowest ranks who cannot afford to retain
counsel.
Most certainly Congress aid not intend that that
should be the result.

That is not the Congressional scheme

of Congress and the fact that a counsel may be obtained by a
serviceman at a summary court-martial indicates that there is
n o

firm schema on the part of Congress that absolutely under

no circumstances shall there be appointed counsel at summary
courts-martial.

10

QUESTION:

Well, now, may a serviceman opt: out of

the summary court and have a general court?
MR. ZAHM:

He may opt out and he may have,

instead, a special court-martial or a general court-martial.
QUESTION:

And at which he would have counsel?

MRo ZAHM:

At which he would have counsel which

Congress has provided for specifically in those courtsmartials.
QUESTION:

But you don't think that saves the

system at all.
MR. ZAHM:

Oh, it doesn't save the system at all

for the; reason that under this Court's doctrine of United
States versus Jackson, it is a limitation on his use of the
constitutional right.
QUESTION:

Well, what if, you know, a state

provides a two-level criminal trial for certain kinds of
crimes and if you are charged with a certain kind of a
crime you are tried in a municipal court or something like
that?

No jury trial.

No jury trial but you can appeal if

you are convicted and have a trial de novo.
MR. ZAHM:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Now, what do you think about that?

MR. ZAHM:

I have given the matter some thought

Mr. Justice Blackmun.
QUESTION:

Yes, I thought you would.

I would

II
think you would.
MR. ZAHM:

Yes, but because the two situations

are not analagous at all, in ray view for the reason that the
two-tier court system provides two different trials.

The

man has a choice after having one trial to completely negate
the result of that trial and choose to go and have another
trial but in the summary courts-martial —
QUESTION:

Well, what if a man can plead guilty —

plead guilty at the first trial and avoid that trial alhis
together and get / jury trial with a trial de novo?
MR. ZAHM:

But in summary court-martial set-up —

QUESTION:

Here he doesn't have to plead guilty.

He can go have his general court.
MR,, ZAHM:

He may go have it, but he will stand

tile risk of much greater punishment if he does.
QUESTION:

And in my example I gave you on the

two-tier system, if you opt for the jury trial in the first
instance, you face a higher penalty in some of these state
systems.

" ;
MR. ZAHM:

But at least you would have the

opportunity of being found not guilty in the second trial.
You arc having the choice of two different trials.
QUESTION:

You certainly have that hare.

MR. ZAHM:

You have only one opportunity for trial

of any sort in the summary courts-martial system.

You are

12
either going to take the summary courts-martial or you

want -

QUESTION:

But if you want a lawyer, you can get it

MR. ZAHM:

You can get it at the risk of greater

punishment, which this Court in the United States versus
Jackson says is an unconstitutional limitation and your use of
your constitutional rights.
QUESTION:

But in the other situation, if you

want a jury you can get it but you have to expose yourself to
greater punishment, Justice White's two-tier example.
MR. ZAHM:

In the two-tier example, as I understand

it, you may have jury trial in the first trial, as a matter
of fact, under the Kentucky system in Colton.
QUESTION:

You didn't get a jury trial the first

tier in Colton, I don't think.
MR. ZAHM:

Well, I wouldn't be too sure about that

at the moment but I believe that that is the opportunity, a
jury trial even at the first level, in the first court.
Now, the federal parties have made the point that
the Court of Military Appeals was not considering the question
of military necessity when they decided in the United States
versus Alderman in the favorable — with the favorable view
with regard to the Sixth Amendment right.
Now, we have taken the opportunity in our brief
to quote in full that portion of the brief that was presented
in the Alderman case before the Court of Military Appeals- on

13
this entire question of military necessity.
Pages 15 to 20 of our brief are directly quoted
from the brief presented to the Court of Military Appeals in
Alderman,

This specifically indicates that that issue of

military necessity was very forcefully made by the Navy
before the Court of Military Appeals, fully considered by the
Court of Military Appeals and in their opinion, the Court
of Military Appeals in Alderman flatly stated

that there is

no showing of military necessity made out to indicate that
the Sixth «amendment right to counsel should be deprived to
men in service.
Again, we have cited at length and quoted at
length in our briefs from the Fidel article, "Summary CourtsMartial, a Proposal in 1971," pages 29 and 30 of our second
brief in which, although the entire article shows that there
is no military necessity for summary courts-martial in
general, the specific point is made in that article by Fidel
that the number of summary courts-martiaIs dropped from 64
percent of the total number of courts-martials in the military
in 1962 to 25 percent in 1969 and he suggests the obvious,
that the reason for the drop in summary courts-martials in
those years — which were pre-Alderman years, pre-Argersinger
years — when, as we have indicated previously, since June 8th,
1973

the Navy, along with the Army and the Air Force, has

been providing counsel as a result of the Alderman decision

14
but prior to that time —
QUESTION:

When a service — when a Naval person

is charged, does he have an initial option to take a general
court-martial in place of a summary? Slight at the time of the
charge could he opt for a general court-martial?
MR, ZAHM:

He would be given at a very early

stage, by being charged with a summary court-martial, he
would be given the opportunity to

opt, but he certainly

wouldn't be opting for a general court-martial, if he was
going to opt at all.
Now, the only conceivable reason from a practical
standpoint, that a man who could have a summary courts-martial
without counsel, would choose special courts-roartial with a
risk of greater punishment would be that he feels, if he is
sophisticated enough, and both of these men are not, that if
he has a lawyer he probably won't go to jail at all — at
least he has a chance of not going to jail at all and what
he is trying to avoid -- which is the very thing that
Argersinger, with regard to civilians, was all about — was
not to be forced to go to jail, liberty, not to be forced
to go to jail.
It is the right to have counsel before you are
sentenced to jail, to have the defense of counsel, of your
own personal counsel, which is the whole principle of
Argersinger and it should certainly apply to our man in

15

service who have every right to be protected by the
Constitution, even more so, perhaps, because they are serving
their country and they should be penalised because they are
wearing the uniform of the United States.
So the reason given by Fidel, which is the
obvious one, for the tremendous drop in summary courtsraartials in those years between 1962 and "69 is that in 1962,
the Article 15 provisions were so strengthened by Congress
that the military commanders themselves saw that it was much
more practical to give a man an Article 15, which is nonjudicial punishment, than to go through the procedure of a
summary courts-martial and sc the basic reason for the drop
in summary courts-martial, even prior to the Alderman
decision, which had nothing to do with the requirement of
giving counsel, was the Article 15, practicality that
commanders saw and there was this complete drop in summary
caurts-martiaXs for that reason, which is certainly strong
)

indication of the lack of military necessity, for summary
courts-martiaxs in the first place, with or without counsel.
QUESTION:

What are the differences in punishment

that can be inflicted under Article 15 or company punishment,
whatever you call it, as opposed to a summary court?
MR. ZAHM:

Mr. Justice Re’nnquist, in an Article 15,

in the Navy known as "Captain's Mass," you may be given
punishment of restriction to limits, correctional custody,

16

not confinement and the Court of Military Appeals, which has
the expertise in these matters over some many years of
considering this, in United States versus Chandler, after the
Alderman decision, specifically determined the question that
the Argersinger application that was ruled necessary in
Alderman does not apply to Article 15 punishment because it
is non-judicial.

It does not call for a conviction and there

is no confinement, so the man does not go to jail in an
Article 15.
QUESTION:

That is the first part of my question.

Now, how about the second part?
MR. ZAHM:

Excuse me, sir, I’m —

QUESTION:

I said, you have answered the first

part of my question.
MR. ZAHM:

Yes,

What was the second question?

QUESTION:

Well, to compare the punishment that

can be inflicted by a special court with this Article 15
punishment as to outside limits.
MR. ZAHM:

Do you mean special or summary, sir?

QUESTION:

Summary, I’m sorry.

MR. ZAHM:

Summary.

The basic difference, the

most significant difference is going to jail, being
incarcerated, confinement, to use the term of Argersinger.
The whole point of Argersinger is that the man
should not bs sent to jail as part of ~

17
QUESTION;

What are the limits on the jail term

in the summary court —
MR. ZAHM:

Thirty days -- thirty days' confinement.

QUESTION:

Thirty days, but no 30 days on the

Captain's Mass, no confinement.
MR. ZAHM:
of time.

The Captain's Mass isn't even a question

You are not confined.
QUESTION:

That3 s right.

MR. ZAHM:

You are restricted to base, perhaps.

QUESTION:

So if the commander thought that the

acts involved warranted soma confinement, he would not go
under Article 15.
MR. ZAHM;

If he thought it was serious enough
a
that tha man should have/conviction on his record and should
have a confinement in the brig, he would not be giving him
an Article 15.
QUESTION:

Because the Article 15 doesn * t permit

MR. ZAHM:

That is correct.

that.
But the point is, we

are speaking of minor offenses and the types of offenses
for which punishment is meted out under both Article 15 and
summary are tha same general type, small matters, minor
matters.

And as Fidel points out, the commanders of military

establishments have long determined that for these minor
offenses, the punishment is certainly sufficient under

18
Article 15 and that it is unnecessary to go through the
rigamarole and the formalities that escist at all under
summary courts-martial.
Now, it would be significant to this Court to be
aware
QUESTION;

Well, there are still thousands of

them that go on.
MR. ZAHM:

The figures, I was just about to give

you, sir, as obtained at special request from* the Judge
Advocate General's office, Department of the Navy, August 21,
1975.

Co-counsel requested information from that source

and we have non-judicial punishment under Article 15 in
1965, 322,660 of them as compared to summary courts-martial
of 11,152.
QUESTION:

Why did they choose 11,000 summary

MR,, ZAHM:

Well, I, couldn't give you a specific

courts?

answer to that but I think the significance —•
QUESTION:

Well,

there are 11,000 instances

in which the authorities thought a summary court was
appropriate.
MR,. ZAHM:

Perhaps I ought to point out, your

Honor, Petitioners -QUESTION:

Well, that is right, isn’t it?

MR. ZAHM:

Yes.

Our position is not that summary

position.

That is

not our

Wa are not trying to destroy the institution of

summary courts-martial.
QUESTION;

I know, but you are suggesting that the

judgment of the Court of Military Appeals is that you can get
along pretty well with Article 15 and you don’t need this
confinement possibility.
MR. ZAHM:

The necessity for it is certainly not

QUESTION:

I know, but in 11,000 instances, the

that gieato

authorities thought that it was essential.
MR. ZAHM:

I would grant you that point.

I would

emphasize the tremendous discrepancy in the number between the
Article 15s and the summaries.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

MR. 2AHM:

And I want to emphasize that it is not

our desire before this Court to seek the abolition of the
summary courts-martial.

The issue of this case and all that

we are contending for is that if you are going to have
summary courts-martial, the accused

should have his own

personal defense counsel as required under Argersinger and
there is no reason not to apply it to the military.
QUESTION:

Now, if he opts for a special or a

general for these same crimes, what can he — what is the
possibility of the penalty in each case?

20
MR. 2AIM:

For the special courts-martial ,

here, i.s six months.

counsel must be a member of the bar?
MR. ZAHM:

Absolutely not.

QUESTION;

How would you define or characterise

the qualifications that would be necessary?
MR. ZAHM:

There are many instances throughout

the Uniform Code of Military Justice which do1hot require
counsel, where counsel is required, to be an attorney.
Now, Judge Pence, in the Dagle case, pointed out
'•>

that, on this question of military necessity, that there is
no tremendous burden on the military to provide counsel
because no one is saying that the counsel must be a lawyer
and we don't say that he has to be a lawyer.

That is not our

contention and so, certainly, as Judge Pence pointed out in
the

opinion, it should be the best-qualified person

available at the military institution.

Good logic demands

that but -QUESTION:

How do you identify the best possible?

MR. ZAHM:

Well, in my brief — I don't know if

21
I could find it quickly enough* but it is in the brief, the
Coast Guard has an entire established guideline for
determining who is best-equipped to serve as counsel,
starting out with people who are present who happen to be
lawyers„
QUESTION

%

You said "the best."

You meant, then,

did you, just someone who is qualified to help?
MR. ZAHM:

I would say that, yes.

Someone who is

qualified to help, who is best-qualified to help, which does
not mean that he has to be a lawyer.

He has to have a

certain degree of intelligence and good common sense and a
willingness to serve a person who is accused of a crime and
so forth.
QUESTION 2

Who is the Court in a summary court-

martial?
MR. ZA5IM:

In the summary courts-martial?

QUESTION:

A single commissioned officer, isn’t it?

MR. ZAHM:

A single commissioned officer who need

not be a lawyer and generally is not,

QUESTION:

That is what I thought.

MR. ZAHM:

Who need not be a lawyer and generally

is not so we are not saying that the lawyer who needs to be
appointed to defend the accused — I mean, that the counsel
should be a lawyer, either.
all.

We are not making that point at

QUESTION:

Well, what function does the counsel

Exactly,

serve?
Let*® assum® a lay counsel

of abort equal knowledge and sophistication with potential
defendant.
MR, ZAHM:

Even if he were poorly-qualified* the

greatest attribute that he has for defending that accused
person is his own divided loyalty in an attempt to the best
of his ability

to defend him.

QUESTION:

Now, that is exactly

It is just a hand-holding operation

then, isn't it?
MR. ZAHM:

It is not a hand-holding operation.

He has had at least the operation to the extent of his
ability to interview witnesses which the accused certainly
can't call upon the one court-martial officer who is weax'ing
the three hats of the judge, the prosecutor and the so-called,
the defense counsel, because that officer, as full of
integrity as he may be, as fully desirous as he may be of
doing his duty as Article 20 calls for, simply cannot perforin
the function of serving both the prosecution and the defense.
QUESTION:

Well, why can’t the accused interview

witnesses himself?
MR. ZAHM:

Because in many instances it requires

his interviewing

such witnesses as his commanding

officer, colonels.

How --

23
QUESTION:

But supposing that the guy is a --

whatever the Naval equivalent of a corporal is and his
counsel is a corporal?

Certainly the accused is as capable

as a corporal counsel of interviewing the commanding officer.
MR. ZAIIM:

I Jell, he is not the accused.

He may

be at the disadvantage, and that is the reason why Judge
Pence in Dagle said he should be the best-qualified person
available, not -QUESTION:

Best-qualified.

Does that suggest that

the sailor could not say, "I want, my bunk-mate to represent
me " ?
MR. ZAHM:

If he were stupid enough to make that

request rather than making —
QUESTION:

Nell, should that be honored or should

the commanding officer say no?

He is not best-qualified

if the commanding officer has the duty.
I want — I am going to pick someone else; you
can't have him.
Can they do that?
MR. ZAHM:

Well, I would say that I don't believe

that is an issue that we are trying to bring before the Court
right now but I would say if that is xvhat the nan wants,
this Court just decided last term that if the man absolutely
wants no counsel, he has a constitutional right to have no
counsel.

24
QUESTION:

Can he says as follows, if he wants

John Jones, he is entitled to have John Jones?
MR. ZAIIM:

I would say so, yes.

I would say he

would be mighty stupid to want the poorest possib]_e defense
counsel that he can find when there is much better qualified
to represent him.
QUESTION:

Then if he picks his bunk mate, and his

bunk mete is not very well-qualified, then would you say he
has made a waiver of this "best-qualified" standard?
.MR. ZAHM:

I — in that sense he has made a

waiver but certainly he has been given his constitutional
right under the Sixth Amendment to

right to counsel and we

would be certainly satisfied with that but I don't think that
these hypothetical would be the general rule.

A man given

the opportunity to have counsel at summary courts-martial is
going to request the best possible counsel that he can be
provided with.
QUESTION:

Now, you don't want us or the federal

judiciary to get into the determination of who is best,
do you?
MR. ZAHM:

No.

No specific standard or guideline

need be announced by this Court.

The manner in which Judge

Pence determined it in the Dagle case was to say that under
Argersinger, the person who was available under the circximstances to be counsel would be sufficient, depending on the

25
circumstances; out at sea or an outpost or whatever, who may

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARVEY M. STONE, ESQ.
MR. STONE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The purpose of the summary court-martial is to
exercise justice promptly for minor military offenses under
a simple form of procedure.
In keeping with this intended purpose, Congress
made a deliberate decision to entrust the active conduct of

26

the trial to an impartial court officer rather than opposing
counsel.

This Congressional determination is entitled to

great reference since this Court has long recognized that it
is the Constitutional role of Congress and not the courts
to strike the balance between the rights of men in the
Armed Forces and certain overriding demands of discipline and
duty.
While the Court has been careful to confine
court-martial jurisdiction to service-connected offenses
committed by servicemen, it has never struck down a
deliberate Congressional provision governing military justice.
QUESTION:

Am I right in my understanding that

this really isn't a trial — you used the word "trial"
but that Congress said that it is not a trial in the
Constitutional sense, in the Anglo-Saxon sense of being an
adversary proceeding?
MR. STONE:

I think that is right.

I think that

Congress decided that it was important to be able to use a
magisterial or inquisitorial proceeding for —

27

QUESTION:

I mean, if it is an adversary pro­

ceeding, I suppose the — if it is akin to a. civilian
adversary trial,then I suppose it would follow that Argersinger applies and counsel is required.

But if — so the

question is whether or not Congress has power under the
Constitution and despite the Bill of Rights to provide that
at this level, the proceeding in the military shall not be
a "trial" but shall be something more akin to a continental
European proceeding.
Isn't that the basic question?
MR. STONE:

I think that is the basic question and

our position —
QUESTION:

Even if it results in jail.

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. STONE:

Even if it results in jail and the

considerations that go into the analysis are whether the
military has a significant interest or whether Congress
reasonably concluded that the military has a significant
interest in this kind of procedure plus an examination of
the fairness of the procedure and what is at stake for the
•

individual.
Now, this Court's decision in Parker v. Leavey
also provides

a

framework of analysis for a case like this.

There, the Court recently stated that the
fundamental necessity for obedience and the consequent

28

necessity for imposition of discipline may render permissible
within the military that which would be constitutionally
impermissible outside it.
The Court in Leavey reaffirmed the principle that
because of the unique mission of the Armed Forces, many
Constitutional provisions apply to servicemen in different
degree.

There, the Court held that the proper standard of

review for vagueness challenge to the UCMJ, even with respect
to statutes impinging on the First Amendment,

is

that

which applies to civilian criminal statutes regulating
economic affairs.
Now, we submit that these rules governing the
right to counsel in civilian adversary proceedings cannot
be mechanically applied to courts-martial.
Specifically, labels such as incarceration and
criminal prosecution do not automatically establish a right
to counsel under Argersinger and related civilian cases
dealing with a different system of justice.
What is needed here, rather, is a pragmatic,
functional analysis of the problem and such an approach, we
think-

reveals that Congress, in determining that'this

should be an inquisitorial kind of procedure rather than a
strictly adversarial procedure, has fairly and reasonably
accommodated the private and governmental interests at
stake find we emphasize first of all that the summary court

29

martial in the form

intended by Congress is a fundamentally

fair procedure.
A fundamental rationale underlying Argersinger
and related cases was that it is grossly unfair to pit a lay
accused against a legally-trained prosecutor or anyone who is
experienced in the courtroom.
In the summary court-martial, of course, there is
no prosecutor.

The only people present aside from necessary

witnesses are the accused and the court officer.
The Manual for Courts-Martial, which implements the
Code, describes the basic role of the court officer. "He
will thoroughly and impartially inquire into both sides of
the matter and will assure that the interests of both the
Governmant and the accused are safe-guarded."
The Manual also contains extensive regulations
requiring the court officer to play an active role in
helping the accused present his case and develop his
evidence and there is no reason to assume that the court
officei* does not fulfill that duty.
Another concern in Argersinger was the unfairness
produced by the rush to justice in civilian misdemeanor
courts.
The summary court-martial presents no such problem.
While justice is swift, the proceeding itself is dignified
and orderly and there is no necessity for assembly-line

30

justice.
Now, if the presence of defense counsel really
improved the fairness of summary court proceedings
significantly, one would expect to see a significant decline
in the percentage of convictions following the Navy’s
implementation of Alderman on June 8th, 1973.
This is not the case, as our supplemental brief
shows on page 4.
Except for the last few weeks of fiscal year 1973,
ending in June 30th, 1973, counsel was not provided at
summary courts.

During that fiscal year, the conviction

rate at summary courts was 95.2 percent.
In calendar year 1974, the last annual period for
which final statistics were available, the percentage of
convictions at summary courts was 93.6 percent.

This

figure represents a decline of only 1.6 percent as compared
to

fiscal year 1973 and, of course, we can’t be certain

that the presence of defense counsel at r/ununa'ry courts has
actually caused this 1.6 percent decline in the percentage
of convictions but even if there is a causal connection, the
1.6 percent decline does not necessarily indicate that the
presence of counsel has improved the fairness or accuracy
of the fact-finding process.
Now, Argersinger, by —
QUESTION:

Do those figures also show, however,

31

that there was a decline in the total number of summary
courts?
MR. STONE:

Yes, there was a decline in the total

number of summary courts.
QUESTION:

And might that suggest that with the

knowledge that now, in a summary court, the defendant would
have tie right to have counsel, that they were a little more
careful about instituting a summary court or, rather, they
might have —- what is it called now?

You just picked out one year.

has this been going on?
MR. STONE:

didn’t you?
MR. STONE:

We picked out the last annual year

That's right.

Well, how many were

MR. STONE:

The year before represents approxi­

mately the same trend.
QUESTION:

You don’t know.

MR. STONE:
QUESTION:

Do you know?

It's —
Do you know how many there were the

year before?
MR. STONE:

I think our supplemental brief has a

and the last full year previous to that?

That is reasonable

enough, I suppose.
MR. STONE:

It is in the supplemental brief.

QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Where is that?

QUESTION:

of anything like that before in my life.
a norm, you take a series of years.

If you want to show

You don't just take the

last year.
I mean, maybe the year before nobody went to the
Mast or nobody had a special court.
MR. STONE:

The year before, calendar year of

1974, shows that the percentage of convictions was down just
slightly more than the year before the new rules began.

34

The year that we picked out shows statistics that
are unfavorable to us because they show of an increase in the
difference between the two and that is why we picked that
out to avoid the complaint that we were picking out the year
that was most favorable to us.

We have picked out the year

that was the least favorable to us in that sense.
Now, Aggersinger, by contrast, seemed to have
been premised on the notion that the presence of defense
counsel in civilian criminal prosecutions would help the
accused in a major percentage of cases.
Indeed, at one point, at page 36, the Court
referred to a study which concluded that misdemeanants
represented by attorneys are five times as likely to emerge
from police court with all charges dismissed, as are
defendants who face criminal charges without counsel.
What is new termed to be —*
QUESTION:

Aggersinger was derived from Gideon

against Wainwright, which was based upon the principle that,
basically, that in order to make the sides even the
defendant had to be represented by counsel which was based
upon the hypothesis

upon a model of an Anglo-American

trial, with a judge sitting on the bench and with a
prosecutor and the defendant over here.
If the judge was a lawyer and the prosecutor
was a lawyer and the defendant was uncounseled, it was just

35

a triangle, if you will, that was going to fall on its face.
MR. STONE:

That is a part of our basic point.

Argersinger —
• If
QUESTION: /one begins with a hypothesis of a
person on the bench who is not a lawyer, no prosecutor at
all and the person on the bench whose job is to sit on the
bench as well as represent this side as well as to represent
that side and not a single one -- nobody in the room is a
lawyer, you begin with a highly different given factual
environment and context, do you not?
MR. STONE:

Yes, it's a different system and

Argersinger was premised on the notion that there had to be an
evenness in representation, it ivas unfair to have an accused
who was opposed by someone who was trained in the court,
even if he wasn't a legally-trained prosecutor.
Our point about

this system is that it is a

balanced procedure and, indeed, the injection of defense
counsel into these proceedings, the argument might be made,
distorts the previous balance and could even —■ assuming that
there is still no prosecutor which there is not at this point,
could even prompt the court officer into a prosecutorial
role.

He may be thinking that he should protect the

prosecution now more than the defense since the defense is
already represented by a lawyer or —
QUESTION:

Well, how can he do that under what you

36

just fcoLd us was in the Courts-Martial Manual?

It said he

can't do that.
MR. STONE:
QUESTION:

He is not supposed to do that.
Well, I thought you said he couldn't,

under the Courts-Martial Manual.
MR. STONE:

It didn't say he —

It is supposed to represent the

interests of both sides, but there have been cases that held
that if you have a system in which you have a defense counsel
representing the defendant and you have a judge who is
supposed to be judge and prosecutor, that can present
problems.

I am not saying that the summary court-martial

was unfair as it's structured today.
I think it was fairer the way it was before but
I am just saying it wouldn't be surprising to see claims made
that the proceedings are now not properly balanced because of
the presence of defense counsel and it is not — I think that
that claim is no less persuasive than the claim made today
that it is net fair and the result of that could be some
judicial rule that prosecutors also should be required at
summary courts-raartials and then you would really have a
strictly adversary —•
QUESTION:

Well, but the Government isn't entitled

to due process of law, is it?
MR. STONE:

No, but I am just taking the analysis

one step further to show that it is unwise to start

37
requiring a defense counsel in here because the basic point
of the summary courts is that it is originally a balanced
procedure and I am anticipating claims by defendants» perhaps
in the future, that could be made.
QUESTION:

Certainly one can anticipate the claim

that the court, that the judge should be a lawyer -MR. STONE:

One can anticipate that claim.

QUESTION:

-- but as I understand it, as I underalso
stood Mr. Zahm orally and/in his brief, there is no attack
made in this case upon the constitutional validity of a
summary court-martial as such.
Do you understand him likewise?
MR. STONE:

His attack is if the defendant needs

counsel.
QUESTION:

Well, do you understand that there is

no attack upon the summary court-martial as such?
MR. STONE:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
That is my understanding.

But one

certainly could anticipate that there might be one.

We have a

case in which we have granted certiorari -- this will be
heard later this term — involving an attack upon the
constitutional validity of an ordinary civilian court, the
judge of which is not a lawyer.
MR. STONE:
summary court officer.

Well, I will say this about the
He does have training, legal

38

trainir, g and he is experienced in these matters.
He is not a lawyer.
QUESTION:

That is --

Does every ship in the Navy carry an

officer like that?
MR, STONE:
QUESTION:

Every ship?
Yes.

MR. STONE:

There are — on ships there are

officers available who can conduct summary7 courts.
QUESTION:

In other words, if you had a rather

small commissioned vessel in the United States Navy, let's
say a submarine chaser with not more than five officers,
would it have to have one

who has had

this special

training?
MR. STONE:

Well, the rules

are in effect

now when we make room for military exigencies and what is
reasonably available, but 1 can't say that on every ship that
there will be a summary court-martial officer who necessarily
has that training.

I just don't know.

QUESTION;
MR. STONE:

I don't think so.
The Article 15 power is used on a

ship —
QUESTION:

Well, that is on account of the

officer, not the ship.
MR. STONE:

— perhaps for that reason.

And an accused can't even refuse an Article 15 on

39
a ship.
QUESTION:

And you not only have the problem with

respect to ships but there are military outposts virtually
all over the world with outlying units.
MR. STONE:

That’s right, isolation posts.

There are manpower problems which —
QUESTION:

Yes, but I am addressing the point you

made that the summary court officer had to have soma legal
training.

That can be trueMR. STONE:

can’t it, Mr. Stone?

He is not required to have legal

training but as a practical matter, ha has to be familiar
with the system and he is given books which he has to study,
trial guides which he is —
QUESTION:
MR. STONE:

There is a Manual.
A Manual.

This is not equivalent to

lav/ school training.
QUESTION:
MR. STONE:

Right.
But he has to become experienced with

this system and has received some training and has to study
these books and discuss the process before he conducts the
court.
I wanted to turn to the military interest in
eliminating the requirement of defense counsel at summary
court-martial which is, our main argument here is recilly not
the manpower problem but something quite different.

40

The military does, obviously, have a special
interest in prompt and formal methods of discipline for
minor offenses.
Like Article 15 proceedings, the summary court is
designed to regulate a vastly greater proportion of the
serviceman's life than would be subject to regulation in
civilian society.
The purpose of the summary court is not only to
deter him in his conduct but also to instill a positive sense
of discipline and to return the accused quickly to his
military duties and these aspects of the summary court
reflect the special relationship of the Government to its
servicemen described in Parker v, Leavey.
Unlike the civilian situation, the Court stated,
the Government is often employer, landlord, provisioner and
lawgiver rolled into one.
Nov/, the presence of defense counsel, who is
bound by professional duty to develop every argument
favorable to his client, has thwarted the purposes of
summary court-martial in several ways.
First of all, it formalizes and rigidifies the
the proceedings and —
QUESTION;

You indicated that the claim was not

for a professionally-trained lawyer but for a bunk mate or
what was sometimes in the old days called "next friend."

41
MR. STONE i

I think I understand Mr. Zahm's claim

to include something slightly more than that, that he wants —
QUESTION:

You

said the man could pick anyone he

wanted.
MR. STONE:

Ha can pick anyone he wanted but if

he wants someone with some reasonable training, he may be
entitled to have just a representation by some officer who
has some experience in this system.
As the system operates now, the military has
simply been providing lawyers if they are available and if
not, other1 people who have training in the system,
Our most important concern with respect to the
military interest here is that the presence of defense
counsel has apparently caused a substantial delay in the
disposition of charges and thus counteracted the Congressional
objective of svjift reaction to minor offenses.
As we show on page 4 of our supplemental brief —
and, again, the figures aren't conclusive, they merely tend
to support our point — the presence of defense counsel has
coincided with the marked increase in the average time span
between preferral of charges and final review and it may be
that

factors other than the presence of defense counsel

has added to this delay, but it seems reasonable to infer
that the presence of defense counsel has been the main cause
of the delay.

QUESTION;

MR. STONE:

Yes, the holding in Karapas that I

refer to was that if you enter the District Court and you are
in confinement, jurisdiction of the court doesn't terminate
simply because the custody terminates and these people, we
are talking about a system in which people are sentenced to

QUESTION:

47
MR. STONE:

The added delay in the imposition of

punishment which averages out now to about a 13-day additional
period comparing the year' before Alderman to the current year
is very damaging to military interest, primarily it renders
the summary court-martial a more cumbersome procedure and
prevents the Government from imposing punishment quickly.
But it also, the 13-day period of unresolved
charges can be damaging.

It can have an adverse psycholo­

gical effect on the accused and in some instances it can
render him temporarily ineligible for transfer or security
clearance and that is another consideration that ultimately
has to do with the Army*3 preparedness to fight wars.
The decline of the use of summary courts has been
causing a proportional shift towards other procedures and to
that extent we suggest that, the diminished utility of summary
courts has upset the entire system of military justice
designed by Congress and the summary court-martial fills an
important gap between the Article 15 nonjudicial^punishment
proceedings below it and the special court-martial above it.
It is an option that is advantageous to both the
Government and, sometimes, to the accused.
The Government might want to convene a summary
court if previous Article 15 proceedings have failed to
generate obedience of a particular accused.
The accused might want a summary court if he has
