MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERS

We'll hear arguments next

in 1619, Federal Power Commission against the NAACP, and 1608,
NAACP against the Federal Power Commission*
Mr, Journey.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DREXEL D. JOURNEY, ESQ*,
ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL POWER COMMISSION
MR. JOURNEY?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This proceeding comes before you with a history of
six years in which the EEOC, the FPC, the Justice Department,
the Civil Service Commission, and others have been seeking an
answer to a question.

And that question is the proper

interrelation of the Equal Employment Opportunity laws and
economic regulatory laws.
We’ve tried three approaches to get a definitive
answer.

We’ve tried administrative procedures.

We’ve tried

the legislative route. And we’ve tried the judicial route.
In all of them we’ve failed.
What we now require is for this Court to set the
fences by which economic regulatory agencies, equal employment
opportunity agencies, like the EEOC, the regulated gas and
electric utility industry and others may function.
QUESTION;

Mr. Journey, your statement that what you

now require from this Court is such-and-such raises a question

4
in my mind that bothered me while reading the briefs and
bothered me in the Court of Appeals opinion* it seems to me
that there is a certain abstractness about the question that
is presented here* and I don’t know -whether it’s standing or
case or controversy* or rightness.

But obviously this Court

doesn't just respond to the request of both, parties to tell
us when to —- tall you what you can do and what you can't do.
You've got to shew that you've got a concrete
controversy.

And I'm somewhat disturbed by the fact that this

wasn't any specific attack on a race nearing or a license
application* but simply a request for a rule* and the FPC
turned it down because it had no jurisdiction,
MR, JOURNEY:

Your Honor* if you look at the history

of this * the PG&E case* which is quoted in the Commission's
declaratory order Ho. 623* you will see that this started —
this controversy started out in an FPC hydro licensing case*
raised initially by the California Rural Legal Assistance* Inc.
The matter in that case was whether economic ■*— the
issue* the precise issue there and here is whether economic
regulatory statutes are an alternative enforcement strategy
for the equal employment opportunity laws.
case* 44 FPC* that's quoted in declaratory
order 623* didn't go to court.

The Commission* when it faced

the issue in the PG&S case* invited -the NAACP in.

They

invited others in* to hear ‘the points of whether there was

5
jurisdiction and whether economic regulatory laws could be used
as an enforcement strategy.
The Commission concluded in the PG&E case that it
could not.
The NAACP then brought a general proceeding which
culminiated in Opinion 623f which was directed basically to
the gas and electric utility industry throughout the United
S tates.
We think that the question is important and should be
resolved by this Court.

We think it is ripe for judicial

review.
NAACP argues that there’s a constitutional requirement
that the Power Commission have affirmative action employment
regulatory programs.

They argue also that under the public

interest concept there is enfolded within the umbrella of the
public interest notion a requirement in the Power Commission
to resolve these questions,
The Court of Appeals said no.
at the function of a regulatory agencyr
must look at its delegated 'authority.

It said when you look
such as the FPC, you
It found that we had,

under the Power and the Gas Acts, three things to do basically.
We were to look at conservation of natural resources, we were
to look at adequacy of supply of electric energy and natural
gas.
tion.

And that we were to protect 'the consumer from exploita­

6
The Court went on, after making that finding

and

holding that we had no jurisdiction, to determine what employ­
ment practices should be to reach into the operation of the
economic regulatory function, and it found in our ability to
disallow costs what I call an ancillary jurisdiction in the
Coramission.

Which seems to say, by reason of the things the

Court of Appeals would have us

do, namely, get the EEOC forms

and let people intervene who claim they were victims of
discrimination in unequal employment, hearings and opportunity
to be heardc
Well, we think what this comes down to is an endless
procession of litigation for us, in terms of why would we hear
•these questions if we are not being told by the Court of Appeals
that we can do indirectly that thing which they said we could
not do directly.

They said we could not regulate employment

practices, per se.
Now, when we discussed this matter with the Solicitor
General, the Solicitor General said that he thought the case
had been properly decided by the Court of Appeals, holding that
we do not have regulatory jurisdiction, per se.
We think ‘that in looking at the additional findings
of the Court, 'they pose a most difficult situation for the
Commission to —
QUESTIONS

Do you read the Court of Appeals as saying

that in individual proceedings you could look into employment

7
practices as such, or only in connection with cost?
MR. JOURNEY:
QUESTION:

The latter.

But we ~

And if you thought, if you concluded that

if they had legal employment practices, their cost might be
lower, it might make some difference.
MR. JOURNEY;

Your Honor, we think that the Court of

Appeals decision suggests that we can, one, either deny rate
relief or deny a certificate because of what might be our
v

independent, views of what should be their employment *
practices, -™
QUESTION;

Yes, but only because of its impact on

cost.
MR. JOURNEY; Cost impact and service impact.

But

tiie way the equal employment opportunity laws are structured,
and the way the regulatory laws are structured, there is now
in being, under the Employment Act of 1972, a comprehensive
\

control mechanism administered by the EEOC.
QUESTION;

I understand that, but let me — let me

get your position clear.

Suppose that the FPC on its own now,

in a rate proceeding, was asked to give rate relief to a company
and it thought that the company was engaged in illegal employ­
ment practices which, if cured, would lower their cost.

Would

you have the power, under your present statute, to tell the
company that you would not give them rate .relief because they
have

because their legal cost wouldn't justify it?

8
MR. JOURNEY;

If the legality question had been

determined in the forum
QUESTION:

Well, I'm not asking you that.

I asked

you,- do you have the power to determine it in your own
proceeding?
MR. JOURNEY ;

I believe not in the first instance.

We apply the doctrines of prudence, of just and. reasonableness
and we disallow costs for rate purposes which do not meet
the standards of the Power and Gas Acts.
QUESTION?

Welle what if somebody — what if some­

body comes in to one of your rate proceedings, one of the
customers of the utility, and complains that the utility ~
that some of 'the costs claimed by the utility are forbidden by
law?
MR. JOURNEY?

If they are forbidden by law, there

is -QUESTION;

Don't you inquire into that?

MR. JOURNEY:

Yes, sir.

But we think, Your Honor, that is not what this case
is about, and in the historical context, -QUESTION; But only because there's another mechanism
for determining whether there are legal costs?

MR. JOURNEY; We think that that's the orderly way to
relate the equal employment opportunity control machinery versus
the economic regulatory machinery.

9

QUESTION:

Well, pursuing my brother White’s inquiry

a little bit.- let’s say a customer comas in and says some of
these costs are forbidden by lav;, because they were bribes,
they were bribes of municipal officials.

Are you suggesting

that you, your Commission would not and could not consider that
until or unless the courts had convicted somebody of bribery?
MR. JOURNEY;

I am saying. Your Honor, that for cost

purposes, Account 426.5 would disallow that for FPC rate
purposes upon a showing of substantial evidence.

And relating

it to the questions of rate-making under the Power and Gas Acts.
But I’m suggesting also to you that when you read
the Court of Appeals

opinion and the arguments that were made

before the Court of Appeals, and the arguments that are made to
you, that’s not the question that’s being put to you.
You’re being asked to — because of the administrative
workload of the EEOC, the 100,000-plus cases in the backlog,
to have us, through the economic rate-making procedure,
determine what the employment conditions should be of the
utilities whose services we regulate.
QUESTION:

What if a customer comes in in a rate

proceeding, Mr. Journey, and says the utility defended a law­
suit and paid $350,000 in lawyers5 fees, and we don’t think it
should have defended that lav/suit, we think it should have
just capitulated.
Now, would the FPC inquire in that case as to whether

10
or not the utility should have defended the action on the
merits?
MR. JOURNEY;

Yes, sir, there's been litigation on

that question on legal fees, and we have determined that the
Commission makes the determination on a cost basis, applying
the just and reasonable standards, whether it should be allowed
for rate purposes or disallowed.
But it is up to 'the utility management in the first
instance to engage the lawyer, and the lawyer then determines
■with management what they do or don’t do.
QUESTION;

Well, but supposing the utility shows that

it followed the advice of a lawyer in deciding to defend the
action, and there's no question about the size of the fee.
The customer's complaint is that the lawyer's advice was wrong,
you shouldn't have defended the action, you really had no
defense, you should have settled it and avoided this cost.
And therefore, take the cost, out of the rate base.
MR. JOURNEY:

We have had that question. Your Honor,

and we have disallowed some of the costs, and that has gone
up through the Fourth Circuit.

But that question has been

litigated.
QUESTION;

And what standard do you apply in dis­

allowing those costs?
MR. JOURNEY;
the prudency tests.

For just and reasonable standard, and

II
QUESTION :

The what?

MR, JOURNEY:
QUESTION:

Prudency test.

For —

To pursue what Mr. Justice Rehnquist

was just raising, with a variation:

suppose the claim was the

president of the company had caused the employment of a law
firm, at a retainer of a quarter of a million dollars a year,
the law firm being headed up by the son of the president of
the company, and that -these payments ware for unnecessary
services.

You would inquire into that kind of a claim?
MR. JOURNEY:
QUESTION:

Disallow that, yes.

Yes.

Just as though the president had a

yacht or an airplane that he didn’t need, but was charging it
off to the utility, you’d inquire into that, too?
MR. JOURNEY:

Yes, sir.

That has all been litigated

in the early history of the Power Commission, after the
passage of the Holding Company Act.

You will find the cases

that related to the cost disallowance and rate disallowance
coming up in the early Supreme Court history.
But I submit to you that that is not what's being
asked here, and that’s not what was involved.
QUESTION:

And --

Mr. Journey, could I ask you a follow*-up

question?
MR. JOURNEYs
QUESTION:

Yes.

Supposing it was proposed that there be a

rule defining when attorneys’ fees and like costs would be

a

12

allowed in litigation involving charges of discrimination
against the power company.

Would you have jurisdiction to

adopt the rule that, would say in certain circumstances those
costs would he allowable, and in others they would not?
MR. JOURNEYS

I think, for purposes of fixing the

regulated utility’s costs, we would.
QUESTION;

Then you do not —■ Judge McGowan, in his

opinion, said they didn’t know whether your holding of no
jurisdiction was that, no jurisdiction to adopt the specific
proposed rule that the petitioners had submitted, or any rule
relating to employment discrimination.

The one you’ve said

you could adopt would be a rule relating to employment
dis crimination.
MR. JOURNEY;

Well, 1 think, Your Honor, as I under-

stood the question put to me, it was whether we could disallow
the costs of the utility whose rates we were fixing.
QUESTION; Right.
MR. JOURNEY:

In Judge McGowan’s opinion, what he

really is suggesting that we do is permit people to intervene
and through, we believe, by indirection, fix the employment
practices of utilities.
We regulate the services and costs of utilities in
iaterstate commerce.
What this is all about is the Commission is being
asked to grapple with the economic conditions of admittedly

13

disadvantaged portions of ‘the society.
QUESTION:

Now, I —

But Judge McGowan didn't require you to

make any rules, he permitted you, as I understand it, or as the
Court of Appeals would permit you to go at it on just a
case-to-case basis.
MR. JOURNEY:
QUESTION:

But if -there’s jurisdiction ■—
And that —- and only in connection with

cost.
MR. JOURNEY: But if there's jurisdiction, Your Honor,—
QUESTION:

Yes?

MR. JOURNEY:

whether it’s rule-making or ad hoc,

it really mean® tb^t --- that that opining means one of two
things.

We can do by indirection that which he said we can’t

do directly, or it means that we have an ancillary investiga­
tory review authority to consider facts.
QUESTION:

Have you ever considered in a rate

proceeding whether a company has unneeded employees?
MR. JOURNEY;

We have looked at — the answer to that.

is yes.
QUESTION;

Yes.

And you do look — you do look into

charges of featherbedding and -~
MR. JOURNEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Yes. So you do look into labor questions.

MR. JOURNEY: As they relate to costs.
QUESTION;

MR„ JOURNEYs

How. here, what we're talking about

is using the economic regulatory process not to, in effect,
control service or rates or costs, but to reach back in and
cure things which are socially and legally undesirable*

The

employment practices of utilities which may be on a discrimina­
tory basis*
Now, it seems to me, —
QUESTIONS

Mr* Journey, can I just interrupt again?

How is -fehat different from disallowing the cost of a bribe to
a public official, for example?
MR. JOURNEY ;
QUESTIONs

A bribe ~

If the cost is associated with a violation
*

of law, why is discrimination any different than any other kind
of violation?
MR* JOURNEY;

there is a determination that he has been bribed, and there
is —
QUESTION;

But you said you'd act on substantial

evidence, as I understood it, without —MR. JOURNEY;
QUESTION;

We would act on substantial evidence —Supposing you had substantial evidence

of unnecessary costs incurred in connection with racial
discrimination.

How is that different?

MS. JOURNEY;

If there was a question of — if I may

answer in the context of your bribery question, if there was a

15

proceeding to determine the bribe question, I would recommend
to the Power Commission that it defer processing of that until
the bribe trial question had been resolved, because under
QUESTIONS

Well, but the question, is one of power»
*

Would it be essential as a matter of jurisdiction that you
defer until after there had been an adjudication?
MR, JOURNEY;

I think not,

It is not essential to defer for cost

disallowance purposes. Your Honor, but what, it does require is
if the other proceeding is going forward, and if it's determined
■chat there was not a bribe, and indeed those costs should be
disallowed, and we had kicked them out under Account 426„5,
then we*d be in the process of needing to put them back in
again.
You see, we don't operate in a vacuum —
QUESTION:

I guess everybody can make a mistake,

but you concede, as I understand you, that you do have
jurisdiction to consider the significance of costly illegal
conduct in the bribe area, do you make the same concession
with respect to costly illegal conduct in the discrimination
area?

And if not, why not?
MR. JOURNEY;

if it is for cost incidence purposes,

we could review it and we could disallow it.
QUESTION;

If you could review it, could you also make

a rule in advance indicating the circumstances under which you
would disallow it?

16

MR. JOURNEY:

Not if it went to the question of saying

that, we could prescribe what would be the labor requirements
of the regulated utility.
You see, the rule that was proposed to us is that we
undertake and determine an affirmative action program like the
Philadelphia Plan, or one of the other plans, to determine the
over-all employment conduct and practices of the electric and
gas utility industry.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

You're a little too close

to the microphone. Mr. Journey.. I think that's our static
problem.
MR. JOURNEY?

We don't, as a matter of course, get

to that question, for this reason;

The Commission regulates

ten percent of the revenues of the electric utility industry.
We regulate about ninety percent of the revenues of the
interstate gas and electric utility industry.

That a good

part of the employment of the gas and electric utilityindustry is covered by State fair employment practice laws, *
it's covered by the equal employment opportunity laws, it’s
covered by the federal Office of Contract Compliance, and the
General Services Administration is the one that fixes the
standards and criteria by which utilities must comport them­
selves .
We take account of their requirements, just as we
tak'® account or the IRS requirements, or any other requirement.

17
We might want to disallow an income tax thing, or something of
that nature, but we wouldn't in the first instance make -the
determination of whether someone had violated the income tax
laws *
QUESTION:

fir. Journey, assume you had a situation

in which a utility had been found guilty of discriminatory
practices and ordered to pay back-pay in a fixed amount.
Would you, as of today, under the practices presently prevailing,
disallow the back-pay ordered fay. say, a court?
MR. JOURNEY:

Yes, sir.

That would be a question of

putting it into the cost to service, and having determined that
it was not a just and reasonable item, if in fact it wasn’t
just and reasonable, then disallow it.
QUESTION: But in that situation, you would have a
quantified cost.
MR. JOURNEY:
QUESTION:

Right.

And I suppose in many situations involving

alleged discrimination, there would be no quantification.
MR. JOURNEY:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

Do you want to pursue that topic a bit?

MR. JOURNEY:

Well, there are — there are areas of

penalties, of back-pay, and other things, where items can be
liquidated and we can handle them 'through the economic
regulatory process.

We find

it most difficult, however, to

speculate as to what might be the loss of morale, what might be

18

the inefficiency, what might be a lot of the other factors
associated with this.
We submit that under the end-result test of Natural
Gas Pipeline in the case law progeny, where from 1940 on you
have reviewed our cases on a functional appraisal basis, you
should not find that we have this jurisdiction.
QUESTION; Well, do you think you would be acting
contrary to the Court of Appeals opinion if in a specific case
you cam® to these very conclusions that you have just now stated,
that you have looked at this and you really can't arrive at
anything, anything substantial or definite, and that it's
wholly speculative and you just put the issue aside?
MR. JOURNEY;

We think that what would happen there is

we would then get into a question of interpreting the opinion,
if I advise the Coramission —
QUESTION;

Well, yes, but what do you think about it

right now, about toe Court of Appeals?
MR. JOURNEY;

I think that probably that Court of

Appeals opinion means that we could go in and regulate the
employment practices of the utilities.
QUESTION;

Yes, but suppose you didn't.

Do you

think you would be required to under the Court of Appeals
opinion?
MR. JOURNEY;
we abused our power.

Then it would be a question of whether

position that the Commission should not be forced to do this.
QUESTION:

Well, what about the Court of Appeals
Does that — would it permit you to do that,

or would it require you. nevertheless, to regulate the
employment practices?
MR. JOURNEY: The Court of Appeals opinion would have
us back up here again after I had sc advised the Commission,
because the people would not be satisfied.

The proof of the

pudding in this was that until -QUESTION;

Well, I know.

Somebody might bring you

up here, but all I wanted to know is what your opinion was of
the Court of Appeals opinion.
MR. JOURNEY:

I think that the Court of Appeals

opinion means that 'there is an ancillary authority in the
Commission to determine employment practices.
QUESTION: Well, I know that's what you say, but that
isn't my question.

20

My question is, if you exercise that authority

and

found out that you just couldn't quantify, and so there was no
relief given, would that be contrary to the Court of Appeals
opinions, in your view?
MRc JOURNEYz

If we could defend successfully

against the challenge that we abused our discretion in not
acting, I would —
[Laughter, j
QUESTIONS

That's what Justice White is asking you;

yes or no.
MR. JOURNEY;

I think that we would have difficulty

in maintaining that position.
QUESTIONS

May I suggest, though, isn't, the problem

that you confront, not the one you've been articulating, but
the fact that in every rata case or in every request for the
licensing of an applicant, this issue would be raised and
you'd have to try it, and it might you six weeks or six
months to litigate it.
MR. JOURNEY:

Well, that's the burden, the

administrative burden question.
QUESTIONs

Well, I was wondering when you were going

to say that.
MR. JOURNEY; Well, we had that in our brief, Your
Honor, and we think that this would be an unmanageable workload
for us.

We think -that under the end-result, test of Natural,

21

there are three reasons why you shouldn91 find this s

one ,

we aren’t equipped to do it? two, we're otherwise busily
occupied with gas and electric matters? three, there already
is in place and functioning a mechanism under the equal
employment opportunity laws by which equal employment practices
are regulated.
The 1972 Amendments did not give us that authority.
The basic 564 Act did not.

Our Act does not give it to us.

You're being asked to read it into our statute, and you’re
being asked to have us ask -- answer in each case substantial
questions of relevance and materiality.
a hopeless morass.

We think we would be in

We would like the fences fixed.

Either the economic regulatory process is an alternate
enforcement strategy for the equal employment laws, or it is
not.

We think it is not.
QUESTION;

Mr. Journey, you gave

you were asked a

question about the possible example of quantified costs in a
back-pay award, and you said, you expressed the opinion that
those might well be disallowed by the Commission.
Has there ever been an issue such as that actually
presented to the Commission, or are you just giving an opinion
based on your judgment as to what they’d do?
MR. JOURNEY;
QUESTION;

In terms of disallowing —
If —- a utility which might have been

found guilty of employment discrimination, having assessed

22
against it a back-pay award, you suggested that such an amount
might wall be disallowed as a proper cost»

Has that issue ever

actually been passed upon by the Commission?
MR. JOURNEY:

It has not been passed on in the

employment context, but it has been passed on in the context of
other things —
QUESTIONS Right.
MR, JOURNEYs

— as litigation ensued out of the

Holding Company and the divestiture proceedings, and as the
gas and electric industry was unscrambled in terms of its
financial control.
QUESTION

%

Has it ever coma up, Mr. Journey, in

connection with back-pay awards for unfair labor practices?
MR. JOURNEY;

It is -- to the best of my knowledge,

it has not come up in terms of a decision that the Commission
rendered.

How this actually happens is when the auditors

go in and check the books, ‘they, in effect, kick out, as a
matter of course, duplicate labor costs.
You see, the gas and electric utility industry, the
labor costs are all handled by in-place-and-functioning
accounting requirements, and it*s broken down by the functions
of production, transmission, distribution, and general.
So that when tee auditors go in and look at the hooks
of the gas and electric companies, they kick out these
dup 1 icate costs.

23

QUESTION? So that, would I take it, then, would be
the procedure that would be followed in connection with an
EEOC back-pay award; wouldn’t it?
MR, JOURNEY;

The saine thing.

And if it was a penalty

question, it would be kicked out under Account 426,3,

If it

was an unreasonable charge, it would be kicked cut uxider 426,5,
QUESTIONs

Well now, just say, you know, some of

these back-pay awards run into a lot of money, a million or more
dollars, many millions in some of them.

Are they handled

just administratively this way?
MR, JOURNEY; They would be kicked out by the auditors,,
yes, in the accounts.

If they were duplicate costs or penalties.

So they are not left without a remedy. They have one,

Mr, Glickstein.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD A, GLICKSTEIN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE NAACP, ET AL.
MR. GLICKSTEIN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
The FPC’s position in this case appears to be that
it has jurisdiction to do what is easy and lacks jurisdiction
to undertake what is difficult.

The FPC seems to have

converted an alleged burden into a jurisdictional barrier.
What the FPC appears to contend is -that after
employment discrimination has produced costly consequences.

24

after the costs of employment discrimination have been
assessed by soma other agency, then and only then is. -it proper
for the FPC to disallow such costs in a rate-making proceeding.
This is the limited extent to which the FPC
recognises any relationship between a duty to eliminate
employment discrimination -QUESTION; What would be the situation, Mr. Glickstein,
if your view should prevail, and the Federal Power Commission
undertakes these evaluations, and -the EEOC and the complaining
parties all disagree with it?

In other words, suppose they

had a rather fixed pattern of rejecting all such claims.
Have you exhausted your remedies when you’ve gone to
the Federal Power Commission, or do you get another bite at the
apple over in the EEOC?

MR. GLICKSTEIN; Well, Mr. Chief Justice, if the
Federal Power Commission refused to disallow specific costs
against a utility in a rate-making proceeding, for example, —
QUESTION?

No, no, I mean passing on what you want

them to pass on? namely, to get into the substantive aspect
of forbidden employment practices.
MR. GLICKSTEIN:

We concede, Mr. Chief Justice,

that there are remedies before the Equal Employment Commission,
there are remedies under 1981.
We do contend, however, that the costs of employment
discrimination are a very relevant factor for the FPC to con-

25

sider, and not to consider it merely after the costs have been
assessed by some other ~~
QUESTIONs

No, no, I'm not making my question clear.

They do just what you ask them to do.

They go into

the subject of employment practices, with respect to minorities.
But you don’t like their decision.
bringing such a case.

Assuming that you were

Bo you think the Federal Power Commis­

sion has not followed EEOC guidelines, and a number of other
things? what do you do about that?

Just routinely take it, as

you would any other Federal Power determination, to the Court
of Appeals?
MR. GLICKSTEIN:

If the Court x^ere to hold that the

FPC had jurisdiction in this area, and a particular rate was
challenged as including costs that related -bo employment
discrimination, if the particular license was challenged as
being applied for by a company that had a record of employment
discrimination, and the FPC refused to take that into account,
or discounted it, then that would be an additional proceeding
in which an appeal would be taken from the FPC’s conclusion
on that score.
QUESTION:

Just as you would in any other — in a

rate case or any other issue?
MR. GLICKSTEIN:

Is that it?

That's right.

QUESTION: But I don't think you’ve answered, at least
what I understood the Chief Justice's question to be? and that

26
is

c

if the Federal Fewer Commission does what you ask it to,,

investigates discrimination in the employment practices of the
utilitye and includes "there was no ciiscriminatory practice
here"? may you then, or may people who claim they were
discriminated against, who were parties to the FPC proceeding,
go to the EEOC and start all over again?
MR. CLICKSTEIN:

Yes - they may.

They certainly may.

I think it's clear from the decisions of this Court that there
are multiple remedies available for victims of discrimination.
QUESTION?

I take it that your-claim isn't that the

FPC would have the power to enjoin employment, certain employ­
ment practice, or order reinstatement or back-pay or things
like that.

MR. GLICKSTEINs

I think they would have the power

to disallow costs related to a practice of that sort.
QUESTIONs

That’s all, just the costs, just the

cost, factor.

MR. GLICKSTEINs

In addition to that, Mr. Justice

White, it’s not merely in the rate-making proceeding where
the Court of Appeals said that the Federal Power Commission
has jurisdiction to consider this question, it's also in
licensing and certificating proceedings.

And there, if a

company is shown to be a known discriminator, and -there
perhaps is a competing company for the license, that isn't —
that is a factor we contend the Federal Power Commission could

27

take into account.
QUESTION; Well, you’re not — do you think that you're
barred from raising those issues in licensing proceedings now?
MR. GLICKSTEIN: Well, we are barred. Your Honor,
because the FPC has prohibited the raising of such an issue
in the licensing proceedings.
QUESTION;

In license proceedings.

MR. GLICKSTEINs

Yes. We cite'

the case on page 47,

I believe, of our brief.
QUESTION;

Not only in rate cases, but

MR. GLICKSTEIN;

In both.

In both, the Federal

Power Commission has barred the raising of such issues.
QUESTION; Would the same argument apply to the
nuclear regulatory commission, do you think?
In licensing.
MR. GLICKSTEIN: Well, to the

I think the factors

that the nuclear regulatory commission would be considering
in granting a license for a nuclear regulatory plant would be
somewhat different than 'the factors that the Federal Power
Commission considered when it grants licenses or sets rates.
To the extent that the nuclear regulatory commission has the
authority to consider the — whether or not the consumers are
being exploited, whether or not unjust and unreasonable costs
are being passed on? then I suspect it would apply.
QUESTION;

Did you have the same problems, or have

28
you raised it with ‘the ICC, for example,, in certificates of
public convenience and necessity?
MR. GLICKSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Mr. Chief Justice, the ICC has a -~

They haven't done any­

thing about this.
QUESTION:

Do they have a rule against it?

MR. GLICKSTEIN:

No, they don't have a rule against

this.
QUESTION:

How about the FCC?

MR. GLICKSTEIN;

The FCC is the only one of the ~

well, one of the two federal regulatory., agencies that has
issued a rule prohibiting employment discrimination by its
regulates3.

The FCC does have such a rule.

QUESTION:

FCC?

MR. GLICKSTEINs

The FCC, Federal Communications

Commission.
QUESTION;

And what other agencies?

MR. GLICKSTEIN:

I think the Federal Home Loan Bank

Board, I believe, has issued a similar rule.
QUESTION:

How about the SEC?

MR. GLICKSTEIN:

No, the SEC has not issued such a

rule.

QUESTION;

Incidentally;, in a rate-making proceduree

how would you determine the costs which would be disallowed?
MR. GLICKSTEIN:

One cost, Mr. Justice Brennan, that

I guess is readily assessible, is the cost of the back-pay award.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. GLICKSTEIN;

«*>

Now, Mr. Journey told you that under

the Uniform System of Accounts this would be treated as penalties.
First of all, I am somewhat puzzled by that, because the
Uniform System of Accounts is just that, a system of accounts
that tells utilities how to keep their books.
QUESTION;

asking the Commission to disallow certain costs that were

That would --

To disallow?

QUESTION;

It disallows the rate case.

QUESTION;

After you’ve persuaded them to do it?

MR. GLICKSTEIN;

Well, we would not allow — we would

30

urge the FPC not to take the back-pay award that the utility
had to pay out into account in setting its rate.
QUESTIONs What interest do you have in whether, after
the back-pay a/ard has been made, wha.t difference does it make
to your clients whether that’s considered in the utility’s
rates or not?
MR, GLICKSTEIN; Well, -the interest that our clients
have is in the over-all question of discrimination by
QUESTION:

Now, the over-all question, I should

think your position would be one that would be aided by
encouraging back-pay awards rather than penalizing them.
I’m just wondering if you’re representing the best interests
of your clients.
MR. GLICKSTEIN;

Well, Mr. Justice Stevens, we look

forward to the day when it’s no longer necessary to award
back-pay under Title VII, because the problem that ’that
statute is directed toward is eliminated.

And one of the

purposes of our request in this case is that if the labor
force is used more efficiently, if persons, regardless of
sex or race, are permitted to obtain employment, it won't be
necessary for there to be back-pay awards.
QUESTIONs

See, the irony of this case, as it strikes

me, is that so often in the employment discrimination field,
it's the company that's defending on the ground that if we were
to comply it would be very

>costly.

And here we’ra suggesting

31

that compliance

we’re- suggesting just the opposite.

MR. GLICKSTEIN;

Well# I certainly concede# Mr.

Justice Stevens# that some companies make that contention. I
believe that’s a rather short”*range point of view.
I think that the testimony of economists is quite
clear# that in the long run the elimination of employment
discrimination is economically efficient.

It was for 'that

very1 purpose that Congress passed Title VII and concluded that
employment discrimination raised a great

cost and burden to

the economy.
QUESTION?

How would the PPC ever get at this in a

You certainly don’t suggest the FPC itself is going to

award back-pay? it hasn’t, got any authority to do that.
MR. GLICKSTEIN;

that the PPC —* and the purpose of our rule-making proceeding
was to have the FPC tales preventive steps# to issue a prophy­
lactic rule# to prevent these costs from arising? to prevent
it being necessary to —
QUESTION; Well# you lost on that issue in the Court
of Appeals# I take it, in the sense that the FPC was not

MR. GLICKSTEIN;

It. wasn’t ordered to undertake a

aspects of the rule that we were proposing# that it might be
appropriate for the FPC to adopt,

They might — they might, but they weren't,

MR. GLICKSTEIN: They weren’t required to hold a rulemaking proceeding? correct,

to be disallowed because of a -~
QUESTION:

In addition to back-pay.

QUESTION:

— in addition to back-pay, yes.

MR. GLICKSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Well, of course —

Would you just say, please make a guess

as to how much this discrimination conduct is costing the
company in the long run, and disallow that much?
MR. GLICKSTEIN:
would be disallowed.

There are litigation costs that

In addition to that, there are, as

Judge McGowan indicated, some unquantifiable costs.

And it

might well be that the FPC could conclude -that a company that
engages in employment discrimination is operating less
efficiently than another company, and it might take that into
account in setting the rate.
We quote in our brief a letter from the Administrator
of the General Services Administration, that deals with ratemaking — with utilities that the federal government deals
with.

And he says, on page 27 of our brief, nsince such

33
practices most certainly effect the utilities8 over-all
efficiency, the rate of return granted to the utility would be
established at the lower end of the zona of reasonableness0"
So we do say that if the Federal Power Commission
were to find that a company was a repeated discriminator, that
it could take that —
QUESTION;

So that a percent of that

Yes, sir»

Something of that sort*

QUESTION;

That's almost like a fine* isn't it?

MR. GLICKSTEINs Well* it would be afaetor to take
into account in determining the rate of return.
QUESTION; But you wouldn't attack it by the rate
base* you would simply lower the percentage of return or
you would ask them to -~
MR. GLICKSTEIN;

That would be one method of pro­

ceeding when there are unquantifiable costs.
QUESTION;

Let me suggest a question which may have

an element of heresy in it, Mr. Glickstein. •
Suppose you have a utility down in the southwestern
part of the country* and EEOC makes some preliminary
determination that they have none but — they have no people
employed in the company or practically none with Spanish
surnames.

And so, as a result of the negotiation, not

litigation, negotiation with EEOC, the company agrees to

34

appoint, three out of every four employees thereafter with a
Spanish surname„
And then some years go by

,

and some objection is made

to the rates, and the proof is — and you, have the hypothetical,
and you must accept this as being the proof — that the cost of
this affirmative action program has been enormous, that it's
taking three Spanish-speaking surnamsd people to do the work
that two people did before, partly because of their lack of
command of English and perhaps their lack of education or

,

whatnot

any reason you want to ascribs.
The conclusion is that it’s a wasteful, expensive

program.
r

Nov/, then, what about disallowing that, cost?
MR. GLICKSTEIN:

That, Mr. Chief Justice, I think

would be a cost that was incurred in furthering a very basic
national policy.

I think that would be very similar to a

utility arguing that what it had to do to eliminate some
environmental dangers was very costly.

And that expense was

challenged.
I think that in —
QUESTIONS

But my question is directed to who

decides this, you’re going to say that the Federal Power
Commission would have to respond to -this kind of a challenge
to wasteful expenditure, because, on my hypothesis, there is
a determination 'that this affirmative action program is costly

35
and will become* more costly over a period of years.
So you say tine Federal Power Commission' then must,
say, Well, it's true that this is wasteful and unnecessary
in terms of operating th« company, but because it furthers a
desirable social policy, then the rate-makers must

the

rate payers must bear that burden,
MR. CLICKSTEINs Well, Mr, Chief Justice, if I were
writing the opinion for the Federal Power Commission, I would
say' that this cost is a necessary element in overcoming the
effects of past discrimination? it'5s a short-range expenditure. *
Once the effects of past discrimination are overcome, this
company will ultimately operate much much efficiently, and
whatever costs were incurred as a result of the affirmative
action.
QUESTION:

Well, would you write that opinion if

you didn't have any evidentiary basis for that projection?
MR. CLICKSTEINz
QUESTION?

Well, I —

Or would that just be your

MR. GLICKSTEIN:

opinion?

Well, I wouldn't be 'tbtally

speculating, Mr. Chief Justice.

Again I think that the

factors that go into the ecoinomics of discrimination have b,een
studied, and the Council of Economic Advisers, for example,
estimated some years ago that if employment discrimination were
eliminated from our economy, the gross national product would
increase by $20 billion.

36

Discriminatio;.; is inefficient;,

It might cost some­

thing to eliminate it initially, but in the long run, when it
is eliminated,

there will be benefits as a result of this.

QUESTION;

Of course part of the question in this

case is whether the Federal Power Commission — now, leaving
these very pleasant figures about the gross national product —
whether the Federal Power Commission, which has a very narrow
and limited mission, presumably, if we read the Act, is equipped
to deal with these broad national, highly desirable, social
objectives.
That’s really one of the underlying questions in this
case, isn’t it?

If not the underlying question.

MR. GLICKSTEIN;

And the Federal Power Commission

has acted on jurisdictional grounds in rejecting that, instead
of holding some sort of proceeding and asking the question of
what sort of costs are feasible to deal with, and what sort of
costs are not feasible to deal with.
Perhaps there are some costs that are so difficult
to quantify that, they could not deal with.

On the other

hand, there are probably some costs that they can deal with.
They haven't considered that. They haven’t given us a reasoned
response to why -this is not the feasible function for the
Federal Power Commission.
QUESTION; Would you be satisfied with a reasoned,
response on an ad hoc case-by-case basis, as the Court of

37
Appeals intimated might — would be permissible? or do you
insist- that it be an actual rule-making legislative type
hearing?
MR. GLICKSTEIN: Weil, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would
prefer a rule-making proceeding, and I think that would be in
the best interests of the Federal Power Commission.
One of the concerns it has is that it would — this,
what we’re proposing, would present a great burden because they
would have to consider these questions in a case-by-case basis.
if
k
But./they don’t want to do that, they have a rule-making
proceeding and state what their policy is.
In addition, Mr. Journey today says that back-pay
awards are penalties.

That's the first time I ever heard a

back-pay award defined as a penalty.

Back-pay awards are

equitable remedies, as this Court has said they are; and for
the gas and electric utility industry to be suddenly told in
a.

brief to the Supreme Court that in

the future back-pay

awards are going to be treated as penalties is a rather
unusual way to make new policy.
QUESTION:

Have they not been, back-pay awards,

sometimes been held to be penalties?
MR, GLICKSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, in the Albemarle

case, you referred to' —
QUESTION;
MR.

I’m not speaking of our cases —

GLICKSTEIN:

— back-pay awards as equitable

33
remedies»
QUESTION;

I am not; speaking of our cases»

MR. GLICKSTEIN;

I am not familiar with any Federal

Power Commission case where they have held back-pay awards to
be a penalty.
QUESTION;

We were told that at least they were

disallowed, that double payments for the same employment,
vsere disallowed, that one of the payments was disallowed,” and
that's what a back-pay award would be, wouldn't it?
MR. GLICKSTEIN; Well, it's certainly not clear from
their system of accounts, Mr. Justice Stewart.
QUESTION; Well, we were told by their counsel that
it —
MR. GLICKSTEIN;
QUESTION:

Pardon me?

We were told by their counsel, as I

understood him, that that's standard operating procedure for
their rccc v.ntarts,, when they go into a utility's office.
And you — do- you take issue with that?
MR. GLICKSTEIN; Well, I don't know whether that has
been the practice, whether —- I —
QUESTION;

So whatever you call them, penalties or

whatever, they are disallowed as costs,” or so we were told.
/

MR. GLICKSTEIN:

Well, in the Uniform System of

Accounts, it indicates that something that's listed as a
p-r:&ity might :=a treated otherwise, in a rate-making proceeding.

39
And I assume that

a.

company would be able to argue that the

reason it incurred this back-pay award was because it was
conducting itself in good faith in soma particular situations,
and it should not be disallowed.

It's not — I don’t believe

that under the Uniform System of Accounts it’s that clear.
The Uniform System of Accounts is analogous to your
tax return , where the Internal Revenue Service tells you
where to list something? and merely because you. list something
under contributions does not necessarily mean that that’s the
way they* re going to treat it when they review your return.
QUESTIONj Well, supposing that it were found in a
back-pay proceeding, like the one that this Court had in
Albemarle last year, that the employer had been acting in
good faith, tut that was not sufficient to ward off a back-pay
award?
Now, would you say that that kind of back-pay award
should be subtracted from the rate base?
MR. GLICK8TEIN;

Yes, I would.

I would say that kind

of back-pay award should ba subtracted from the rate base.
QUESTION:

Mr. Click-tain, may I put a hypothetical?

Let’s assume that a utility, with a rate case pending before
the Commission, was charged with having pursued a policy of
persistently, say over ten or fifteen years, a discrimination
in promotion, involving, let’s say, two or three hundred
individuals.

40
What would you — what sort of relief would you ask
of the Commission?
MR, GLICKSTEINs

In that particular case, we would

ask the Commission to perhaps condition the rate increase on
the utility undertaking a program to eliminate the effects of
discriminatory practices in its promotion procedures,
QUESTION:

So you have to litigate before the

Commission, first of all, the issues of alleged discrimination
in promotions.

Would you take them up one by one?

How else

would you deal with them?
MR, GLICKSTEINs Well, I think -that -there is an
instance of whore it would be desirable for "the Power
Commission to have some rules in advance. They might indicate
in the rules under what circumstance they will take allegations
of discriminatory practices into account.
For example, if the practice was raised for the first
time in a proceeding before the Federal Power Commission, the
Federal Power Commission might suggest that we would like to
have the expertise of the Equal Employment Commission on this
issue.
The Federal Power Commission might decide that if
reasonable-cause findings have been made by the Equal Employ­
ment Commission in cases, then it will consider charges of
discrimination in proceedings before it.
It might decide that if there's been a judicial

41
finding in some instance, then it will consider these issues
when the proceeding is before it.
QUESTION;

In response —

QUESTIONs

The Commission itself would have no

authority to order directly any conduct on the part of the
utility, would it?

It could,, as you say, perhaps say,, We'll

grant you the requested rate increase provided you satisfy
us within t. specified period of time that, these practices have
been eliminated.
MR. GLICKSTEINs

I think it could condition the

rate increases, it could condition the granting of licenses
and. certificates on certain type of performance.

When — I

think that under some circumstances the Federal Power
Commission could order something directly.

For example, if

it desired that, every regulates submit, periodic reports
indicating what its employment practices were, it could
order something like that directly.
QUESTION:

Well, let’s assume that the charge was

•’h-.-.t ir: thej employment of people over a long period of time,
discriminatory practices had been pursued, and there were a
substantial number of people who claimed that they were
emd tied to employment and. to be put. in their rightful place
in the union structure.
to do in that case?
MR. GLICKSTEINs

What would you request the Commission
\
I would say that the company that

42

you're referring to was faced with the possibility of
substantial costs as a result of putting people in their
rightful place, and therefore the Power Commission should
definitely condition their rate increase

on ‘the curing of

that situation and not allow the costs that are incurred by
making up for the effects of past discrimination to be taken
into account in the rate.
QUESTION? But you — if you were the counsel for
the utility company, you would have to be told — you would
want to be told which of the 150 people who said they had
been discriminated against would have to be employed,
wouldn’t you?
/

MR. GLICKSTEIN:
QUESTION?

Yes.

And the FPC wouldn’t do that.

Who would do it?

MR. GLICKSTEIN: The FPC would not have the power to
order

that a particular employee be promoted or reinstated?

either the Employment. Commission would or a federal court
would, or a State Human Rights Commission would.
QUESTION: But if the FPC conditioned a rate increase
on the utility doing this, would not the Commission have to
.J

identify tie people who said they had been discriminated
against, so -that the utility would know how to comply with that
condition?
MR. GLICKSTEIN: Well, I think idle Federal Power
Commission cor.Id await the resolution of iheproblem you suggest

43

by another agency.

If there were —

QUESTIONS But that might take two years.
/

MR. GLICKSTEINs
QUESTIONS

It might.

And the —

Meanwhile, what would the utility do for

public financing, for instance?
MR. GLICKSTEINs

Well, the rate increase is allowed

to go into effect, end the rate increase would be in effect
subject to refund.

And if it turned out that there were not

costs related to this, so there wouldn't be any refunds in~
vo'.ved.

If there were costs related to this, there would be

sows refunds.
The ?PC can only suspend a rate increase for five 1
months. And generally it does it just for a few days.
the costs
effect.

And

T mean the new rates are allowed to go into
So the utility would be able to get its increased,

rate.
QUESTION s Suppose there were dual proceedings
pending, regarding precisely the same charges, before the EEOC
and the Federal Power Commission.

What would be the situation

then?
MR. GLICKSTEINs Again I think that because of the
greater expertise of the Equal Employment Commission, the
Federal Power Commission might defer to their expertise and
condition whatever question was before it on the outcome of
the EEOC proceeding.

If it were a licensing question, they

44
would grant the license on condition that 'whatever remedy is
ordered by -the EEOC be expeditiously complied with.
QUESTIONS Well- then, what do you do by way of
implementing that condition?

You say you have a license to

build a clam, which you've applied for and want now, presumably.
And you say when the EEOC provision — proceeding is
terminated, which I take it could be soma months or years
down the road, you then will have a conditional license to
build the dam if you comply with the order of the EEOC.
Now, that's a pretty tough row to hoe for a dam
applicant, isn’t it?
MR. GLICKSTEINs Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the
FPC has suggested a lot of these fears, that it would have to
cut off the licenses for dams, and shut cff powerplants and
so forth.

That, isn't 'the only remedy at their disposal.

If appropriate rules are issued and the utility doesn’t
comply, they can seel: court relief.

They don't have to take

the license away from the hydro-electric plant if they fail
to comply, there are other remedies under the Federal Power
Act that would be available.
QUESTION: Well, but if the EEOC has ordered them to
do s:mething ~~ the dam applicant to do something, and he
isn’t doing it, the EEOC can seek court relief; you. wouldn’t
hen- to have the Federal Power C ommission in it, would you?
MR. GLICKSTEINs Well, the Federal Power Commission

45

would perhaps he the ultimate weapon, that the Federal Power
Commission, if it conditioned the license of this hydro-electric
dam on the accomplishment of whatever was ordered by the EEOC,
I think that would impose on the hydro-electric dam a
sufficient degree of pressure that it would comply with the
EEOC order»
QUESTIONs And the ultimate remedy would be revoking
the license, perhaps after the dam had been built?
MR. GLICKSTEIN: Well, I think that the FPC could
undertake a civil action, get an injunction requiring the
company to comply.
For ax ample, we cite in cur brief some cases where
utilities that are government contractors have failed to
comply with the government contract provisions, and the
federal government is not going to terminate its contract
with the utility, it needs the power, and it went to court and
suod to get compliance with that provision.
Mora is involved in this case than the FPC's
responsibility, however, to protect consumers and to insure
the health of the gas and electric utility industry.

Ten

years before this Court decided the Brown case, in Steele vs.
Lovr.synlbs. & Fashvilin Railroad, the 1925 Railway Labor Act
was interpreted to prohibit railroad employees from being
subjec ;©c;. 'bo racial disexamination.
Repeatedly this Court has recognized the critical

46

importance of employment, and has endorsed the most effective
•remedies for dealing with employment discrimination.
We contend that in this case that it is entirely
consistent with the Federal Power Commission's proper
regulatory role that it too ba required to take steps to deal
with illegal employment discrimination.
Tha«k yon,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.

Mr. Journey, do you.have anything further?

You

have about three minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DREXEL D. JOURNEY, ESQ./
ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL POWER COMMISSION
)

MR. JOURNEYs

I would just say, Mr. Chief Justice

and members of the Court, that the Commission's brief, I
believe, have covered the constitutional points, and I think
they have covered the legislative history points.

I think that

they have covered the reference to the 1972 equal employment
laws, and the

.act that the procedure there for the EEOC

sacking cease-and-desist orders in court review were all set
up and created in 1972 to correct what the EEOC said it needed
enforcement authority to implement what you have said in the
John.-;or case is a comprehensive regulatory mechanism for
dealing with the equal employment question.
We don't think there's anything in the Power or the
Gas Acts that speak:? to the question that Mr. Glickstein and

47
the NAACP want us to undertake.
QUESTIONs

I take it that Judge McGowan, in writing

for the Court of Appeals, indicated that your task — and Ism
reading — in protecting the consumer against exploitation
can be alternatively described as a task of seeing that no un­
necessary or illegitimate costs are passed along to the
consumer — to the customer.
Thatfs the way ha described your job.
MR. JOURNEY?

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: And than he want on, he said:

Without

attempting an exhaustive enumeration, we identify at least, the
foxlowing as indicative of those arguably within the Commis­
sion *s range of concern.
Now, I take it that some of these you already
indicate -the Commission regularly considers, at least in other
kinds of cases:

one, duplicative labor costs incurred in the

form of tack-pay recoveries by employees, who have proven that
they were discriminator!ly denied employment or advancement.
MR. JOURNEY:

I spoke to that question earlier and

said feat for whatever reason, if hack-pay and duplicate labor
was involved- the auditors would throw that out.
QUESTION: So that this issue — that this is just not
