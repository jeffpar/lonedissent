MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 74-728, Franks and Lee against Bowman Transporta­
tion Company.
Mr. Bailer, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MORRIS J. BALLER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. BALLER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court;
This Court granted certiorari to determine whether
district courts have the power to restore victims of hiring
discrimination based on race to the present

seniority

positions which they wouj-d have occupied but for the
discriminatory practices.
The issue is presented both under Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and under 42 U.S. Code Section 1981.
The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held
an award of retroactive seniority beyond the power of the
district courts because, in its view, such an award would
violate Section 7G3H of Title VII.

That section provides

that an employer may lawfully use a bona fide seniority or
merit system, provided

that it is not the result of an

intention to discriminate.
The Court of Appeals did not specifically address

4
the question under Section 1981.
The legal issue presented in this case arises in
circumstances of unvarnished racial discrimination in
employment.

The district court, found that Respondent, Bowman

Transportation, had pursued a policy of excluding black
employees and applicants from all but a few of the lowestpaying, most menial jobs in the company.
The enactment of Title VII had stimulated no change
in Bowman's policies.
The company

continued to discriminate in virtually

every aspect of its operations for years after Title VII
became effective and, indeed, was still engaged in most of
its discriminatory practices at the time of trial in March,
1972.
The district court’s findings as to Bowman's
discriminatory practices reads like a virtual catalog of
unlawful employment practices under Title VII — maintenance
of segregated jobs in segregated departments, a job seniority
system, no.transfer rules, illegal unvalidated testing, racial
assignment and steering of new employees, word-of-mouth
recruitment and retaliation against those few black employees
who tried to better themselves despite this system.
The record presents no mitigating circumstances.
Before this court specifically are claims arising
from Bowman’s rejection of the application of qualified

5
black truck driver applicants.
This policy of exclusion remained absolute until
the eve of filing the Petitioners’ suit.

Until September

1970t Bowman had never hired a single black over-the-road
driver to fill its approximately 500 road driver jobs.

In

September 1970, Bowman began to hire a few black truck
drivers at one of its terminals but continued to resist
hiring black truck drivers at its other terminals.
At one of its major truck driver terminals in
Charlotte, the first black truck driver was hired only a
month before trial.
During the' period 1969 to 1971, which is the focus
of this claim, hundreds of black truck-driver applicants
applied to Bowman»

Many of these applicants were fully

qualified under Bowman’s usual standard for* hiring.
During the same time, Bowman, did hire in excess
of 200 white truck drivers each year.

Many of these white

truck drivers lack adequate or even minimum qualifications
and up to 150 of these whites were hired as trainees, even
though they lacked the minimum truck driving experience
supposedly required.
Bowman hired these white trainees upon the
personal recommendation of members of his all-white or
nearly all-white road driver work force.
When these unqualified whites were hired, along

6

with many other whites with many other whites '«ho were no
better qualified than dozens of unsuccessful black
applicants, they began to accumulate employment date seniority
At trial, the district court certified this case
is a class action and designated several subclasses.

One of

them., denominated class three and represented by Petitioner
Lee, consists of rejected black road driver applicants.

Over

200 individuals were identified.
Those individuals were given notice and were
invited to reapply for hiring by Bowman with priority
consideration but without retroactive seniority.
Thereafter, a few Class III members reapplied and
%

were hired, and began to drive trucks for Bowman. . However,
they took as their employment seniority date the date of
their actual hiring, months or even years after they had
initially filed their applications and months or even years
later than the employment seniority date of many whites who
had .initially applied at the same time they did.
Under the ruling of the Fifth Circuit, these blacks
in their seniority standing, will never catch up with the
whites who were hired ahead of them.
Today or tomorrow, whan one of these black
employees competes with a contemporary white applicant, he
will lose out in bidding and he will have less security from
lay-offs.

Moreover, he will have lesser fringe benefits

7
than
QUESTION:

Wh&t if seniority was granted?

That

is at whose expense, in < sense? If the seniority is retro­
actively granted, what happens to the man who has the
seniority now?
it?

This is not something that can be divided is

It has to be taken away from one person in order to give

it to another.
MR. BALLER:
from any white driver.

We cionc t seek to take seniority
We simply insist that he compete

using his full seniority %«.th blacks using their full
seniority.

The competition would then, be governed among

qualified employees by the full measure of seniority for all
of them.
QUESTION;
MR. BALLER:

But it would make it different in labor.
It would make a difference in

competitive position, Mr. Justice Brennan.
QUESTION:

It would mean, perhaps, that a black

driver would retain a job when a white driver would have to
be laid off, wouldn’t it?
MR. BALLER:

That is theoretically correct.

In

this case, it is quite clear —
QUESTION:

Well, wouldn't that b e

practically

correct, if you have a —
MR. BALLER:

As a practical

matter in this case,

Mr. Justice Brennan, we have a high turn-over situation.

The

8
record shows that about half the road drivers turn over
each year,
QUESTION:

So this decision won't be for this

case alone„
MR. BALLER:

I am aware of that.

As a practical matter, the grant of retroactive
seniority would subject whites to increased competition for
all the things that seniority gives access to, including
security and lay-offs.
QUESTION:

Now, you suggest somewhere in your

brief —- I got the impression that you — at least, a hint
that they took these jobs with a sort of lien on them,
even though they might be innocent of any participation in
✓

the failureon the conduct on which this action was based.
Is that the theory, that they do take it with
V * *■ v- ^

some sort of lien or cloud on the title to the seniority?
MR. BALLER:

The question is not the quality of

behavior of the whites who were hired.

It is the quality

of behavior of the company in rejecting blacks and the
remedy would —
QUESTION:

Well, if you take something away from

the driver hired earlier, you are depriving him of something
that he thought he had, are you not?
MR. BALLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, I would reiterate

our position that we do not seek to take any seniority

e.
away from whites.

They will have to compete with blacks

also enabled to use their seniority but we feel that is the
essential thrust of the law.
QUESTION:

But going to the specific, practical

problem that Mr. Justice Brennan alluded to, on a lay-off —
and we must deal with the generality, not the idiosyncracies
of this company, on a lay-off, someone is going to be laid
off if retroactive seniority is accorded to the class that
you represent.

Is that not so?

MR. BALLER:

If a lay-off comes and it cuts deep

enough to involve the seniority dates we are talking about,
that would be correct, yes, your Honor.
QUESTION:

How do we justify — how could we

justify taking away, in effect, taking sway from Peter to
pay Paul, both of whom are innocent of any wrong-doing?
Each of whom is innocent of any wrong-doing.
MR. BALLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, the lay-off issue,

I would suggest, is, in fact, not a single issue but a
series of issues which may arise in different situations,
none of which, of course, aie presented in this case.

But

ve submit that there will be — it is lurking in this case.
QUESTION:
MR. BALLER:

It is lurking in this case, is it not?
We

submit that there will be

cases in which, as a result of restitution of seniority of
rights to black employees, followed by lay-offs, there may

10
indeed be white employees unable under those circumstances
to hold their jobs.

We think that is what Congress had in

mind when it opened up all pbs to fair competition between
blacks ana whites alike.

We

are not here.suggesting, 1

repeat, bringing in black, employees who have no previous
relation with these jobs, no previous attempt to hold them.
We are simply asserting the right' of

individuals

who, had they been white, would have had the seniority,
would have been able to compete, among other things, for
protection from lay-offs.
We do not think that a per se rule which says,
although these blacks may have been discriminated against in
the past, they cannot have their remedy if any whites'
expectation would be diminished.

We do

not think that such

a rule can be justified as a general matter.
QUESTIONS

Bowman’s operations don’t present the

problem, either, do they, of where someone may have come in
in one capacity and gradually moved up to more and more
responsible positions where you might have some question of
job qualification for what the person is shooting

for.

I

MR, BALLER:

This is a simple case involving, in

regard to this issue, one job.

There is no question Of

somebody being laid off who is less qualified than someone
else.

That would suggest different questions which, I

submit, should be reserved for cases presenting a factual

11
record,
X;d like to address the Title VIX issue primarily
and the Section 1981 issue only briefly.
I
;:h:,s

would stress» in regard to Title ¥11, that

basically

- question of remedies and equity.

Due to

the vague and general terras of Section 793H [which] require
a limitation on what this Court has found to be the sweeping
provisions of Section 706G, the remedial section.
This Court has given a broad scope to the power
and duty of federal equity courts in discrimination cases
generally and in particular, in. Albemarle Paper" Company
versus Woody, has construed Title VII and its .remedial
section as giving the district court sweeping and flexible
powers to make the victims of discrimination whole.
QUESTIONOf course

,

in Albemarle, the statute

specifically said, "including back pay."

Here if doesn*t

specifically deal with seniority.
tx, BALLERs

Mr. Justice Rehnquist

t

the section,

remedial section, of course, is the same and it authorises
the award of any relief as may be appropriate.

We think

that would apply to injunctive remedies as well as back pay.
QUESTION;

Well, would you think that seniority

would follow as inexorably as back pay would in the typical
case?
MR. BALLER;

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would think

12
perhaps even more inexorably, since a job gives to its
holder not merely pay but also other benefits and seniority
in a situation like this is a key to the job»
QUESTION:

Well, then, why did Congress single

out back pay and mention it and not single out seniority?
MR, BALLER:

Mr» Justice, that provision, Section

706G, was modeled on Section IOC of the NLRA, which was
concerned primarily with jobs,

1 would have to assume that

Congress had foremost in its mind that it was granting
access to jobs and would have added the back pay provisions
simply to clarify that that, too, was an available remedy.
The lower courts, in construing this provision,
have invariably, from the beginning, granted remedial
and
seniority»In the job seniority/department seniority cases,
there has never been any question that seniority rights can
be modified where necessary to rectify discrimination.
QUESTION:

Even at the expense of an innocent

fellow employee.
MR. BALLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, court after

court has held that the expectation of white employees,
even though innocent of wrongdoing, may be modified in order
to grant full relief under the act.
QUESTION:

Was that before we had some things to

say about the expectations of employees, in the last two
years I would place it?

13
MR. BALLER:
QUESTION:

The.sa —
Do you recall the teachers, school-

teachers cases, for example?
MR. BALLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, those decisions

began to coma down as soon as cases were decided on the
merits in about 1968 and they have continued to the presei- :
so I think there has been no question as to the viability of
that doctrine in the case of transferred seniority rights.
The only question here is whether there is any
distinction between transfer seniority and retroactive
hiring seniority and we submit that there is not.

It would

be anomalous to say that a black employee who was sent to a
laborer job may not transfer to white jobs with his full
seniority whereas a black applicant who applied for the
white job in the first place and what turned down can get nc
remedy.

That would be the effect of drawing a line between

the well-settled job seniority cases and these new retro­
active seniority cases.
QUESTION:
retroactive seniority?

Whom do you think is entitled to
A class generally or is someone who

proves he was discriminated against and he was qualified
for a job and so on?
MR. BALLSR:

Mr. Justice White, in' this case, our

class, as defined by the district court, consists of
individuals who applied and were rejected.

Only those

14
individuals who were qualified or who proved that they are
qualified would be reinstated and it is those individuals
QUESTION:

It would be an individual determination

when you get to a matter of remedy.
MR. BALLER:

In this case I have stated the class

and in any case, it would be a matter for evidentiary
determination by the district courts in light of the
applicable principles of equity and the make hold purpose of
Title VII.
X would not think that there could be a general
formulation of who would or would not be entitled to
consideration in any case for retroactive seniority but in
this case;» the individuals for whom relief is sought are
clearly identified.
QUESTION:

Well, they may be clearly identified,

but on what grounds would they be — assume you prevailed,,
would all of those automatically receive: super seniority
or would there still be proceedings in the individual cases'?
MR. BALLER:

Mr. Justice, the retroactive

seniority, I assume, could only apply to individuals who
arc reinstated who actually work and that would depend on
determinations as to their qualifications, et cetera.
Nobody would receive retroactive seniority who
was not otherwise entitled to a job.
QUESTION:

But isn’t that pretty much the limits

15
of the class, what you have just described?
MR. BALLER5

As defined by the district court,

yes.
QUESTION:

So that all members of the class, than,

would receive retroactive seniority.
MR. BALLER:

No, Mr. Justice Rahnquist.

Retro­

active seniority would only accrue upon reinstatement.

The

district court would not order anyone reinstated.,
QUESTION:
MR. BALLER:
QUESTION:
MR. BALLER:

Well, what do you moan, reinstatement?
Hiring upon reapplication,
Hiring in the first instance, really.
Well, post-decree.

The district

court invited -- ordered Bowman to invite reapplications.
Many individuals reapplied.

Only a few were hired.

The

retroactive seniority claim is for those who were hired plus
those whose rights we are now litigating in the district
court on remand who may be adjudged entitled to reinstatement
by the district court.
Retroactive seniority is meaningless for those
individuals who don’t any longer have any interest in
working at Bowman or who are not qualified,
QUESTION:

They may want to know if they can still

collect some kind of damages.
MR. BALLER:

They would have a right to back pay

if they had worked at Bowman without their retroactive

.16

seniority and we have several such individuals.
QUESTION:

Hr. Baller, I am just speaking from

memory now, but awhile back, didn't we have a similar kind of
issue with respect to seniority under the Soldiers and
Sailors Civil Relief Act when boys were coming back from
service and they wanted in at the same time and at the same
place as though they had worked continuously during their
period of military service?
MR. BALLER:
QUESTION;

Mr. Justice Blackmun -I find those cases not cited by either

side here and I wonder if they are completely impertinent.
MR. BALLER:

I am afraid, Mr, Justice Blackmun,

that we simply overlooked those cases if they are pertinent.
We did note World War II cases in which returning
veterans and individuals who were not employed at the time
they were ir: the Army were allowed to secure retroactive
seniority rights pursuant to a

collective bargaining

agreement,
QUESTION:

Well, I have in mind specifically

and I would be interested, for one, in post-argument comments
from both sides on Tilton against Missouri Pacific at 376 U.S.
as to whether it has any bearing on the case.

I remember it

very vividly because this Court reversed things, and probabIm­
properly so.
MR. BALLER:

Thank you, Mr, Justice.

1?

.

I’d like to turn just briefly to the Section 1381
issue.

Our position is that whatever result the Court

reaches tinder its analysis of Section 703H in Title VII, the
Petitioners are entitled to retroactive seniority under
Section 1981.
As this Court held in Johnson versus Railway
Express Agency, Section 1981 remedies are independent and
distinct from —
QUESTION:

Mr. Bailer, just getting back to the

other issue, don't we have some of the issues we did not
reach in DaFunis -- did not decide, at least?

Don’t we have

some of those lurking in the background here?
MR. BALLER;

Mr. Justice Brennan, I do.not believe

those are presented in the case.
QUESTION;

Well, I gather you regard this as

simply a rightful place kind of case and not a preference case?
MR. BALLER;
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Nevertheless, don't you think there

may foe some overtones of preference involved in this?
MR. BALLER;
Mr. Justice Brennan.

There is no preference sought here,
We seek for these black employees to

be in the position which the record makes clear they would
be in had they been white

who, in fact applied.

or had

Well, these, I gather, are employees

MR. BALLER:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Who were refused appointment —

MR. BALLER:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
— maybe a year or two ago and now

they are getting -- they are being employed and they want to
be employed where they would have been had they been employed
when they first applied.
MR. BALLER:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
So you don’t have here the maintenance

of any racial structure or the like.
MR. BALLER:

Mr. .Justice, at the same time, we

dc not think that, based on the narrow record presented here,
the Court can or should decide that only in the instance of
a written application could an employee not be in a job which
he otherwise would have been in.
QUESTION:
MR. BAILER:

MR. BALLER;

MR. BALLER:
QUESTION:

There may well —-

Well, what do we have hers?
That is what we have in this case.
Only those who, in fact, applied.
That is correct.
And were refused employment.
That is correct.
And if we stick to that narrow question,

we don’t reach any of these other ones.
MR. BALLER:

That is correct but I would stress

that the lower courts frequently find discrimination in

19
hiring in regard fco people who did not apply who were
deterred from applying by a word-of-mouth recruitment system
or by a reputation well-known in a community that an employer
would not hire blacks and so on.
Those claims, while not present In this case,
should not. be foreclosed.
QUESTION:
seniority does

But the reinstatement with retroactive

could mean and would mean the displacement

of people with lesser seniority.
MR* BALLER;

It would not mean direct bumping

out of jobs people presently hold.
QUESTION;

It would mean

You mean, in this case?

Or in cases

generally?
MR. BALLER:

In this case certainly we have not

asked for that and I think generally the courts have been
reluctant to grant —
QUESTION;

Well, but 'suppose the employer says,

"'Well, I just donEt need that many people"?

"I h&ve 50 people

now and you say I must reinstate with super-seniority 50
others."

Wouldn't the employer be entitled to release the

people with lesser seniority?
MR. BALLER;

Mr. Justice Biackmun, let me draw a

distinction between cases in which a discriminit.ee is placed
in a job held by a white employee who is immediately
displaced and other situations

20

I
QUESTIO;-;:
MR. BALLER;

Or an; other employee, white or —
Or any employee and a situation such

as this case and the typical seniority cases being litigated
in the courts where what the discrircinitees seek is a
seniority right which they can exercise pursuant to the
collective bargaining agreement.

Usually that means when jobs

become vacant, or posted for bidding.
QUESTION:

Well, anyway, Mr. Bailer, as I understand

you, the fact situation we have here is this:
work force.

There is a

That work force has been added to by employing

these people who had previously been refused employment.
Isn't that it?

They have, in fact, been employed.

MR. BALLER:
QUESTION:

Several of them have, yes, your Honor.
They have, in fact, been employed and

their complaint is that they have not been given their
rightful place on the seniority roster.
MR. BALLER:
QUESTION:

That is —
Chat they ought to have the place that

they would have had, had they been employed a year ago or
two years ago.
MR. BALLER:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
So we haven’t reached any of the

questions that involve lay-offs or other circumstances.
MR. BALLER;
the facts of the case.

Those questions are not presented by

21
QUESTION:

But can you

escape then?

Sorae day

Bowman is going to have to lay people off, isn’t he?
MR. BALLER;

Mr. Justice Brennan, I believe the

emphasis and much of the controversy in the case has been
over the theory which justifies the rightful place result
we seek and, of course, the resolution of that theory will
have implications for future cases.

We don’t —• far from

trying to hide them, we would certainly urge that they be
considered.
QUESTION;

Well, these people certainly aren’t

trying to — aren't fighting over any abstract right of
seniority in order to get a 25-year pin,

They want something

tangible as a result of it, don’t they?
MR. BALLER:

That is correct

bidding rights,

security from lay-offs and fringe benefits.
QUESTION;

Mr. Bailer, Iem -- I guess I don’t

understand why you are so concerned about confessing that
in the background in the lay-off possibly of other people.
What is wrong with that on your theory?

They may be .

innocent, as the Chief Justice described them, but they
attained a spot that they shouldn’t have obtained, had the
law been in effect and —MR. BALLER;
QUESTION;
about it.

Mr. Justice Blackmon —
■— I wonder why you are so sensitive

22
MR.•BALLER:

Mr. Justice Blackmun, I certainly

don’t want to suggest that the issue is not lurking.

It is

there and under cur theory, if blacks have retroactive
seniority and a lay-off comes and someone must be laid off,
it would be according to seniority.

There would be no

preservation of expectations founded on past discrimination
for whites.

I certainly don’t mean to suggest that we

wouldn’t advance that position.
It does, however, raise different issues.
I’d like to reserve the remainder of my time, if
I may.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Gottesman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL H. GOTTESMAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT UNITED STEELWORKERS OF AMERICA
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The union agrees with the relief which the
Petitioners seek in this case, though not in its entirety
with the analysis by which they get there.
I’d like to begin by redefining, as it were,
precisely who we are talking about here and precisely what
they seek necause I think that is important to the analysis.
We are talking about a group of people who did
apply for employment and whom the district court found would

23
have been hired but. for the fact that they were black and the
relief which is sought is sought only for those people who,
but for discrimination, would have been hired at an earlier
date.
Mow, what the district court said to this company
was, you shall now, as vacancies arise —- no bumping -- but
as vacancies arise, you shall now offer the next available
vacancies to this group of people.
But, the district court said, when they finally
get a job, their seniority date will only be from the date
that you finally give them the job and what they say is, but
for discrimination you would have hired us eight months ago
or a year ago and but for discrimination, therefore,
QUESTION:

Mr, Gottesman, how many of them have

been hired, in fact?
MR, GOTTESMAN:
have it.

The number is very small.

I don’t

We are talking about a handful,
QUESTION:

What is the size of the group?

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Five,six, seven, something in

that order.
QUESTION:

Who have been hired.

What is the total group involved?
QUESTION:

Mr. Bailer, who was involved at the

trial level, knows better.

It is at least several dozen.

But not all fo those will be eligible for the relief because

24
not all of them will prove to have been qualified at the time
that they applied and thus it can’t be said of all of them
that they would have been hired but for the discrimination.
QUESTION:

So at least a half-dozen who have beer»,

found qualified have been hired.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

That is correct.

That is my

understanding.
QUESTION:

And then they have been getting their

seniority from the date they were hired.
MR. GOTTESMAN:
QUESTION:

That is right.

And they want it back from the date

they first applied and were discriminatorily refused.
MR. GOTESMAN:
date they would have been

Well, they want it back to the
hired.

It might have been a few

days or weeks after they first applied but they .want, in
effect, to be restored to the position that they would
occupy, had they never been discriminated against and that
relief, it seems to

us — and I’ll get into a statutory

analysis in a moment —
QUESTION:

Well, would the same approach,

Mr. Gottesman, or would your approach mean that the district
court could have ordered them back to work right away, even
though it meant bumping?
MR. GOTTESMAN:
in the lower courts.

There has been a lot. of

discussion

25
QUESTION:

Well-, that may be, bat what is your .

position?
MR. GOTTESMANs

Our position is no., that in

remedying discrimination generally under Title VII, the
courts have adopted what is called the "rightful place
approach ," which includes not only giving people the right
seniority, but rather than bumping people, saying, you shall
begin to exercise this seniority the first time a vacancy is
created.
Now, there is nothing in the statute that literally
provides that but from 1967, when the decisions first came
down until today, the lower courts have unanimously endorsed
that in the belief that that must surely have bean what
Congress intended.
QUESTION;

And that is your position, too.,

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Yes, it is.

Now, as Mr. Bailer said, in this case it makes no
difference because vacancies arise every day.

In-another

case it might make a difference but what everyone decided
about that, one thing is unmistakeably clear, that once an
employee does get to work, .he uses his full seniority under

QUESTION:

Mr. Gottesroan, is it clear to you that

Congress never intended a remedy which would require bumping'1
MR, GOTTESMAN:

I can'Only say that so far as I

know, the legislative history is silent.
QUESTION:

Well, why do you suggest that if the

statute did not require that in the way of a remedy, nevarth
less the statute requires rightful place seniority.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, if I may, I can argue why

we think the statute requires rightful place, and I think it
may

become clear from that why it doesn't inevitably follow

that it requires bumping, at least immediate bumping,
because, of course, to give the people the seniority means
that there will be inevitable bumping at the time of lay-offs
and other opportunities.
QUESTION:

But you have got to approach this on

the theory that the original reinstatement as the result of
the claim, foilwed by reinstatement with retroactive
seniority, may result either, A) in the immediate bumping
of X number of people ox* at some time in the future.
MR. GOTTESMAN:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

And then at some point, will you

suggest whether if did not occur to Congress that this might
create some rights for a remedy on the part of the innocent
"purchaser58 ?

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, lei; me address that because

I think that is critical to the analysis here and it is
obviously a source of some concern to the Court.
It is true that the whites who were hired during
this intervening period are innocent.
wrong.

They have done no

They have committed no violation of law and it is

true that they will suffer a competitive disadvantage if
these people are invested with their seniority but it
doesn’t follow, as Mr. Justice Blackmun said, that they are
having anything taken away from them that should be a source
of concern because they, too, are being put in their rightful
place.
Whan the black employee is advanced ahead of them
on

the seniority roster, the white is simply being restored

to

the position he would have been in from the start.
QUESTION:

Do you think that that employee

recognises that ha is being put in his rightful place?
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Absolutely not.

I can tell you

from experience that he does not.
But we deal with Congress5 intentions, not the
employee9 s.
QUESTION t

Well, but what in the legislative

history suggests that Congress was not concerned at all about
whether some employees were going to be displaced, either
from their seniority or from their actual employment?

28
MRo GOTTESMAN:

Well,. Congress was concerned

about that in a wide variety of contexts other than the
narrow one we are dealing with and if I cam get into the
statutory analysis, 1 think 1 can explain both the nature
of that concern and its limits and why it doesn’t extend to
this case because there is no question that Congress was
concerned about this.
Let me start fcy saying this.

1 think thex*e is

no question that the first sentence of Section 7Q6G generali;
encompassed the Congressional intention to make people who!-:,
for the effects of discrimination visited against them, to
make whole those who suffered the discrimination and what#
in essence, the

court below said is, that there is carved

out of this make whole remedy a category of relief which you
cannot give, even though it would make you whole, to wit,
the

retroactive seniority and so the focus of our question

has to be, is that indeed why Section 703 H is in the statute?
Was it put there to put a limit on what would
otherwise be legitimate make whole relief?
And 1 suggest that the answer to that can’t come
by looking first at Section 703H.

The answer to that

question has to come by looking at the history of the
legislative debate becau.se when Congress — when this bill
was first introduced — and it was a bipartisan bill ~
Section 706G at that time not only had the sentence, the

29

make whole provision, it also had a last sentence and the
last sentence was what we have characterised as the anti™
preference section„
It said, "You shall not give relief to people who
were not the victims of discrimination.”
So that on the one hand, you shall make whole those
who are victims of discrimination.

On the other, you shall

not give preference to those who were not the victims of
discrimination.
Now, the statutory language was very clear, or
the language of the bill was very clear.

That did not

prevent its declaimers from going all over the countryside
suggesting that that, indeed, was not what Title VII was
going to mean and there was voiced both on the floor of
Congress and throughout the land — because the period of
time we are talking about was during the Presidential primary
of 1964 — the impending Titia VII was an issue of great
debate during that primary and at least one candidate made
the defeat of that bill one of his major issues and so we
have the anomaly of millions appearing before Congress
saying, enact this statute while Congressmen were being
inundated fey letters from presumably white workers saying,
don't pass that statute.

That statute is going to give all

kinds of preferences to people because, indeed, the
detractors were saying, this statute will give preferences.

30

And we were in the raidsfc of a three-month fili­
buster over this bill and the floor managers of the bill,
Senators Clark and Case, introduced, literally, an avalanche
of written legislative history designed to reassure all of
these concerns and the theme of that repeatedly was, this
bill, though it is designed to end discrimination and make
whole its victims, is not intended to give any preferences
to anybody on account of race.

It is not designed to, in

one fell swoop, cure an entire national history of discrimina­
tion.
All it is designed to do is to make sure that from
this day forward employers and unions shall not discriminate
and that the victims of that discrimination which occurs from
this day forward will be made whole.
There will be no quotas.

QUESTION s

Is there not something mutually

exclusive about those promises?
MR. GOTTESMAN:
/

Well, yes, I think they are.-

Indeed, our brief suggests that they are mutually exclusive,
that they define a rather clear line between that which may
be done and that which may net and as we see that line, the
line is that you may give to the victim of discrimination

In this area, at least, Congress

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, it seems clear to us and ii

place where we disagree with the Petitioners is that they
are unwilling to acknowledge that this statute clearly
precludes preferences and by their unwillingness to acknow­
ledge that, they make the legal argument hazier than we ;
think it ought to be.
We think it is very clear that once you recognise
that that was the whole purpose of these additional provision
being tucked into the back of the statute, then you can see
that that is not the purpose of Section 706G in its first
sentence, that what 703H does — and it is part of a mosaic •--was that after the sponsors had'literally grown hoarse
resisting claims that this statute was a preference statute,
\

they were still confronted with a filibuster and they were

Still confronted with people screaming that, indeed, it did
create preferences and so there was a whole revision of the
bill, the so-called "Dirksen-Mansfield Compromise Bill,”
which reincorporated the central provisions of the statute
intact, the provisions that defined discrimination and the
remedy provision, but added a whole series of provisos, of

32
which 703H was one and 7Q3J, the section that literally
talks about no preferences being another and it is those
sections whose meaning is really the critical issue before
the Court.
QUESTION:
several

And yet can you find anything in these

sections, particularly 7G6G, which draws a

distinction between pre-act discrimination and post-act?
MR. GOTTESMAN:

No, and on that we are dependent

upon the statements of Senators Clark and Case

and the

Department of Justice, all of which are clearly writ in the
legislative history.

And they made it clear, in essence, tlv '

that line was drawn because they said the act only forbids
discrimination from this date, forward so that if may be
true, for example, that last week an employer refused to hire
someone but that person is not the victim of discrimination
within the meaning of this statute and therefore he is not
entitled to a make whole remedy because he was discriminated
against before this law was passed.
QUESTION:

You don't mean — X see, you mean last

week, before the .law was passed.
MR. GOTTESMAN:
law was passed.

I'm sorry,

It was passed last week.

I'm sorry, last week before the
Forgive me.

But they were

saying, as of July 2, 1965, any one who from that date forwar .
is discriminated against is the vietime of discrimination
within the meaning of this statute and he, therefore, shall

33

get a remedy,,
QUESTION:

And he generally is to be preferred^ for

post-act violations.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

He is to be made whole.

He is to

be given the position that he would have occupied but for
discrimination.
QUESTION:

Well, he is going to be, in this case,

as vacancies occur, he is to be preferred.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, in that sense, yes, but

that is not what we mean by preference.
QUESTION:

Well, I wasn't saying that.

All right,

but that is just he is being preferred.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Yes.

Sure.

In one sense of

preferred, ha is preferred.
QUESTION:

Well, he is preferred in the sense that

somebody else doesn't get the job,
MR. GOTTESMAN:
QUESTION:

That is right.

And the reason is that because he has

been discriminated against.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

That is right.

Now, but what we

think 7Q3H means is that it is confirmation, as is 703J and
as is so much of the written legislative history, that there
is not to be a more general kind of preference.
There is not to be a judgment made, for example,
this employer never hired blacks until 1972, therefore, we

34
ought to say- that

X

percent of blacks hired in the future
/

will be given in a range of seniority dates in order to slot
them into some Zion-discriminatory and seemingly reasonable
QUESTION:

That is what the act affirmatively

prohibits, is it not?
MR. GOTTESMAN%
QUESTION:

That is correct.

You say, in effect. Petitioners are

entitled to what they ask for here but they are not entitled
to anything broader than that.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, and they don’t seek anything

broader in this case.
QUESTION:

Right,

MR. GOTTESMAN:
broader relief is sought.
QUESTION:

We discuss 3ome in our brief.

Which ones?

MR. GOTTESMAN:
QUESTION:

But there are; other cases where a

Watkins is the clearest one.

Yes.

MR, GOTTESMAN:

But there are a range *— we are

not suggesting that we have the answer all at one time for
the entire range of facts.

What, for example, of the

employee who didn’t apply for a job in 1970 because he knew
this company did not hire blacks but who comes forward in
1972 and says, I should get two years of seniority.

It

would have been futile to apply.
That involves some of the fact-type questions the

35
court dealt with in Blue Chip Stamps in an entirely different
context.
We are not suggesting the answer to that.

I fchinl-

thafc is something that has to be litigated in the future.
But from that litigation will emerge an answer.

That person

either is or is not the victim of discrimination.

If the

ultimate determination is that he is a victim of discrimina­
tion , then he will be entitled to make whole.

If the answer

is that he is not because unless you apply for a job you are
net a victim, then he will not be entitled to any seniority
and so the line we see is a very clear one, but it is
important to see both sides of the .'Line because if you only
try to look at one as Petitioners do, you slide into the
problem that everybody says, but where does this line stop?
And to us the line is very clear.

The two sides

of it, at least in this case are clear and this case falls on
the make whole side.
Petitioners seek nothing but that which they would
have had, but for discrimination.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Pate.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. PATE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF BOWMAN TRANSPORTATION COMPANY, RESPONDENT
MR. PATE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it Please

the Court:
We are not seeking to sustain the Court of Appeals■

36

interpretation of Section 703H*
We agree with the other parties that the inter­
pretation is not correct.

That is our view.

We don’t agree with everything that the other
parties are saying en route to that conclusion.
We think that it is clear from the legislative
history and from the terras and word s of the statute itself
that this section was intended to have a definite effect.

It

was intended to place a limitation both on the substantive
provisions of Title VII and on the remedies that are available
under it.
Now, there has been discussion of the distinction
between

pre-act discrimination and post-act discrimination.

That distinction, I would say as a starting point, I would
consider valid.

However, I would go further than that.

I think that Congress was drawing a distinction
hira between the discrimination which is the subject of the
case that is specifically before the court in the case and
for which it is framing a remedy as compared, with general
discrimination in the past which it is not seeking to remedy
in the case.
For example, I think that Congress foresaw the
concept which has developed under this statute, 1 might say
different from anything under the National Labor Relations
Act to which it has been compared, under which practices

37
which are racially neutral in themselves are held to be
violative of the act because of their continuation of the
effects of past discrimination including pre-act discrimination
Now, Congress apparently saw that and the legisla­
tive history

demonstrates that it was concerned that the

statute would take in its sweep seniority rights under
numerous seniority systems over the country, either under
union contracts or under company policy where the system
itself had been affected by race discrimination in the past
and even those that might be affected by racial discrimination
in the future.
So we think that is the important distinction in
Section 703H.
Now, conceededly here, the discrimination that we
are talking about occurred after Title VII.

Consequently we

are not talking about just a system that continues the
effect of past discrimination.
Now, it is our view that in a case of this kind,
that the court has the same kind of discretion that the
National Labor Relations Board would have and has had for a
number of years in framing remedies for discrimination cases
under that statute.

It has been noted that the remedial

provisions of this act were, to some extent, modeled after
the National Labor Relations Act.
It has always been considered, under that statute

38
that the restoration of seniority for a discharged employee
as a part of his reinstatement was an available remedy.
Usually the order reads, "Without prejudice to
seniority or other rights and privileges previously enjoyed
or some similar wording and a similar remedy has frequently
been framed for employees who are discriminatorily rejected
for employment.
Now, we think that those remedies were intended
to be available at the

discretion of the court that was

framing the remedy under Title VII just as they were under t!
National Labor Relations Act.
Now, we think, though, that the discretion of
the court still has an important role.
Now, I am aware, of course, of the decision of
tills Court in the Albemarle case.

I am aware of the holding

that the discretion calls for judgment and not just
inclination and that it must be exercised consistently with
the purposes of the statute.
We submit that there was support in this record
for the action which the district court took and that he did
act properly within his discretion.
Now, on appeal, the Court of Appeals, although
making this interpretation of Section 703H, concluded with
fchs holding that the District Court did not abuse its
discretion in withholding this remedy.

39
Now, I want to refer particularly to the factual
situation that was before the Court.
There has been exhaustive discovery before this
case was tried.

These people were identified clearly and

full information had been provided to the other parties abort
all of them.

There were some 200 of these applicants in fchir

category.
They got all the documents relating to them and
had a full information about the company’s action on each
case, including the reasons advanced by the company for the
disqualification of different ones under the criteria that
the company was applying.
They had full opportunity to interview these
people.

There was nothing to keei> them from it and I might

say that answers to subsequent interrogatories have indicated
that they did, in fact, interview them, though I assume they
did not interview all of them.
Two of them, in addition to the class representa­
tive himself, testified.

Also, witnesses for the company

testified about the way in which different individuals were
disqualified that were in this group.
Now, the District Court, on the basis of this
record, made the statement as part of the basis for his
denial of this relief that there was no evidence in the
record on which he could base the multiple conclusions

40

necessary -cor an award of retroactive seniority.
Alsot I think the fact that it makes very little
difference in this particular case under the facts.

The

seniority has such s. small effect among the road drivers in
view of the high rate of turnover and also in view of the
feet that there is very little by way of job benefits that
really depends on seniority.
QUESTION:

The main thing —

Couldn't you argue precisely the

opposite if that is the fact, that there won't be much
displacement or much defeat of expectations of people who
are already there so why not go ahead and give it?
MR. PATE:
yes.

I think you could make that argument,

1 think that you could.

It would not make much

difference either way and perhaps the argument could be made
either way, but I think it was a proper consideration for the
District Court although he did not — the court did not say
that it was relying on that consideration in any event on
this point.
QUESTION:

Well, did the Court of Appeals

address itself to what you are talking about?
MR. PATE:

The Court of Appeals did not address

itself to this other than to make the general holding that I
am talking about.
QUESTION:

Assume the Court of Appeals was wrong

on its basic legal grounds.

Shouldn't we just remand, then.

41
or what?
MR. PAT'S:

Well, that8s — 1 could certainly

understand —
QUESTION;

You want to say that even if it was

wrong, the District Court was right.
MR. PATE:

The District

Court was right and the

holding of the Court of Appeals was that the District Court
did not abuse its discretion, so that gives further support
tc the - QUESTION:

Mr. Pate, I don't fully understand.

Right in what respect?

That these people, in any event,

were not qualified?
MR. PATE:

I am not saying that the people were

not qualified, but that there was a proper basis in the
record for the

District Court's withholding, in its

discretion, of this remedy.
The Court of Appeals concluded that the District
Court did not abuse its discretion in withholding the
remedy.

Consequently, I say that their interpretation of

703H may not have been the same as ours.

It may have been

incorrect but nevertheless they reached the right conclusion,
sustained the District Court and therefore the factors which
affected the District Court’s discretion would be material new
I think.
I might say also that I think that the discretion

42
under Rule 23CD to control the issues to be handled by the
class action was an important factor here.

There had been

no certification of a class action until the conclusion of
the evidence in the case and it was at that point that this
class action was approved and certified in its final findings ,
conclusions and decree by the District Court and referred
to another decision.
He referred to another decision as giving his
reasons more fully in which ha had stated that he wanted to
avoid being inundated by this mass of individual claims so
I would submit that he did have the discretion to control
the class action by limiting the issues that he was handling
on that basis.
QUESTION:

How specifically is Bowman Transporta­

tion Company injured here?
MR. PATE:

I beg your pardon,

QUESTION:

Either way.

MR. PATE:

It is not injured either way and the

company, apart from the general interest of all of us in
the importance of the question,, has no specific tangible
interest in it in this case as to whether seniority is
granted to this group or not.

That is correct.

43
I want to say„ I have —QUESTION t

Is there lurking here the responsi ­

bility of a potential injury in the sense that a displaced
employee — displaced by virtue of retroactive seniority —
might bring a suit against Bowman?

Not in. the setting of

this case? but in the overall picture.
MR. PATE:
Mr. Chief Justice.

That may be lurking in the background*
X had never thought of it as a possibility,.

You are thinking of a displaced white employee
bringing suit because he is displaced ass a result of a
grant of retroactive seniority.
QUESTIONS

I'll have to go back to the National
That kind of situation has repeated

itself many times and it has never been urged that the
employee displaced by the employer's compliance with the
remedial order would himself have a claim because it is a
sort of reverse discrimination under terms of that statute.
QUESTION:

Wellf of course, X suppose we have all

got to bear in mind that a great many new causes of action
that we didn't think about years ago are now suddenly
emerging.

44
MR. PATE:

I think that is correct:e your Honor.

QUESTION:

But as of now, you are not injured.

MR. PATE:

As of now, the company would not be

.injured,, right.
Now, we have contended and do contend that, this
part of the case is moot in any event because the class
representative is out of the class now and he has no furthe
stake in the outcome of this case sines he lost his dis­
charge case which followed his employment after he had
originally been denied employment for a period of time.
This is leave; the intervenor.

He attacked his

--

refusal to hire him, the failure to hire him for a period of
several months and his subsequent discharge as being racially
discriminatory.

He was sustained on the refusal to hire

case but he was unsuccessful on the discharge case and he
was unsuccessful on appeal in the discharge case.
Consequently, the only representative of the class
fco which this part of the case relates is the intervenor,
who brought a separate intervenor*s complaint and he now has
nc stake whatsoever in the outcome of this question and
consequently, we say, under the tests enunciated by this
[Iowa]
Court in Sosna versus Utah and related cases, since this is
not a question capable of repetition while evading review,
that it does not come within that narrow exception which this
Court carved out for certain class actions where that kind

45
of question was presented.
QUESTION:

But these class members certainly havv

a substantial financial stake in the outcome, of the litigat:! .
don’t they, Mr. Pate?
MR. PATE s

The class members have a financial

stake in the outcome of the litigation.

They have a stake

in the seniority question as well but looking to the main
parties for a determination of this question of mootness or
question of case of controversy under Article XII, there is
no named party in the case that has any stake in it.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you.

You have about four minutes left, Mr. Bailer.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MORRIS J. BALLER, ESQ.
MR. BALLER;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Courts
Just a couple of brief points in rebuttal.
As to mootness, our position is that because of
the existence of class members with a live stake in the
controversy and a certified class action, this case does fit
within the Sosna rule and it is viable.
Moreover, Johnnie Lee had a Live claim at the
time the case was certified.
With respect to discretion, I submit -that if the
Court reviews what the District Court and the Court of
Appeals actually held, it would see quite clearly that

46
this was not an exercise of discretion, nor was it affirmed
as such by the Court of Appeals»

Rather, they were erroneous

rules of law.
With respect to the effect of this on presumably
innocent white employees, I would simply note that as the
Court has frequently held, seniority,being contractual is
subject to modification to conform with law and focusing on
the innocence of affected employees would create the kind of
subjective standard

which this Court has abjured in Griggs

and other employment discrimination cases.
Finally, with regard to the reliance by
Mr. Gottesman on the Clark case materials to create a
distinction between pre-act and post-act discrimination which
he conceives is reflected nowhere in the statute itself, I
would simply state to the Court our position that the lower
courts have made it clear that the Clark, case materials
cannot be read literally to convey

the Congressional

intention on their face.
They are far broader than both the terms of the
statute and broader than any construction the courts have
bean willing to give in stating that no pre~i965 seniority
rights would ever be affected by any Title VII action.
That simply has not been an acceptable interpre­
tation in the courts.
Finally, I would just call to the Court’s

47
attention, all we seek here is the 3arae as this Court has
accorded all claims of employment discrimination brought
under Title VII from Griggs through Albemarle Paper and that
is, a construction which assures the victims of discrimination
will have a chance to prove in court that they were wronged
and upon proof of discrimination, that they era entitled to
as complete relief as is possible in the circumstances.
We feel that these Petitioners deserve no less.
Thank you,
QUESTION:

Mr. Bailer, if you lose under Title VII

could you still prevail under 1981?
MR, BALLER:

Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun, Section

1981 is a separate remedy.

We feel that the interference

with contractual rights in the nature of seniority benefits
is -— violates the prohibition in Section 1981 on discrimina­
tion in making an enforcement of contracts and there should
be a cause of action with a right to retroactive seniority
to restore those contractual benefits.
Congress specifically rejected admendments that
would have made Title VII the exclusive remedy for employment
discrimination and as this Court held in Alexander, it did
not mean in enacting Titia VII to repeal pre-existing
remedies.
Thank you.
