ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL KXMMBL ON BEHALF
OF PETITIONER
MR, KIMMEL s
the Courts

Mr» Chief Jus ties# and may it please

This case presents the question whether the

Federal Magistrates Act authorises district courts to refer
all Social Security cases to United States magistrates for
review and recommendation of a decision on the merite.
At issue is General Order Wo. 104-D of the Central
District of California.

This district court rule requires

all Social Security cas^e and many other Federal oases to be
referred to a magistrate for recommendation of a decision on
the merits.

In regard to Social Security cases the rule

requires tha magistrate to review the administrative record,
receive briefs, hear argument, and submit a proposed decision
to the district judge, together with a proposed opinion.
Tha judge may adopt or reject the proposed decision, taking
whatever final action ht deems appropriate.
This specific case aros® out of a Social Security
claim by the respondent Weber under th® Medicare provisions of
the.Social Security Act.

The Secretary denied the claim and

Weber sought judicial review in the district court.

Th®

4
district court clerk referred tfe® action to a magnistrat© under
General Order Ho* 104-D,

The Government's motion t© vacate

tfe® reference was denied by tfe® district judge, but ©a the
Government8 s motion h© certified his order for Interlocutory
appeal to the Ninth Circuit*

The Ninth Circuit upheld tfe®

reference and General Order No. 104-D as within tfe© authority
of the Magistrates Act.
Shis Court granted tfe® Government's petition for
certiorari,.

The respondent Weber doss not take a position on

the magistrate referral question, but the Ninth Circuit
judgment is being supported in this Court by the amicus.
The issue before this Court is whether General Order
Mo, 10 4-D is authorised by tfe® Magistrates Act.

In otter

words, does the Magistrates Act permit or should it be
construed to permit the referral by district courts of all
Social Security cases to magistrates for a recommended decision
on the merits.
This issue is important not only to the judicial
review of Social Security cases, but to judicial administration
generally.

If tfe© Ninth Circuit deoision is upheld by this

Court, not only Social Security cases, but any case on an
administrative record and perhaps all cases on motion® for
summary judgment or other dispositive motions could b® referred
to a magistrate for recommendation of a decision on tfe®- merits
under the authority of the Magistrates Act.

5

The Government's position in this case in brief is
that the recommendatory procedure for deciding the merits of
civil caser» established by General Order No. 104-D was not
authorised or intended by Congress when it enacted the 1968
Magistrates Act.

We will show from the legislative history

that th© purpose of the Magistrates Act, the reason why
magistrates were created, was to relieve judge® of minor ©r
ancillary functions bo that the judge© would have more time
for the careful performance of their adjudicatory duties.
Our main point is that Congress intended in this Act
to give magistrates limited or ancillary

duties, not a

central role in the adjudication of civil cases.

On this

basis the Government will urge that dispositive motions and
civil casss< should generally not be referred to magistrates
hut that ndndispositivs motions may be.
Initially we wish to not® that we share the Judiciary's
concern with the tremendous caseload on district courts created
by just the number of cases that are filed every year, including
Social Security cases.

Our position is hot- that Congress

cannot deal more* effectively with this problem by statute,
including the sound use of magistrates.
a statute

Congress could enact

which in terms would authorise magistrates to review

and recommend decisions in Social Security cases or dispositive
motions generally.

Our position is simply that Congress did

not authorise such an Important and far-reaching judicial

6
procedure when it enacted the 1968 Magistrates Act.
QUESTION £

Then yon as® raising your constitutional

issu®.
MR. KIMMEL:
QUESTIONS

That5® correct, your Honor.
Enlighten m© a little bit.

Why is tli© Government so concerned about this?

I a® interested.
Is -it fearful

that there will foe more adverse decisions in Social Security
cases eoraing out of a magistrate’s pen# ©r what is it?
ME* KIMMEL:

So, Mr. Justice Blaekmun, it’s not, I

don’t believe, because of the actual decision, at least on the
basis of the experience wa have had so far under these types
of ru3.es.

It’s rather than w© feel that the procedure is not

authorised by the Act and if Congress wants this hind of
procedure, it should enact a statute which would authorise it.
It'e more & question of whether it*s legal rather than a
specific interest in how the cases are decided.
QUESTION*

The Government9s interest is entirely

pur®.
MR. KIMMEL?

That could be one way of putting it,

yesi your Honor.
QUESTION*

What’s another way?

(Laughter.)
MR. KIMMEL*

That the statute should be complied-

with by district courts, basically*
Our reasons for a limited —

7
X gather th® question was, lt*s justa

QUESTION

purist idea on th© part of th® Secretary?

Just a legal question

In which h® suddenly got interested?
MR. KIMMBLs

1 think 'that there may be possibly if

th® practice grows — if this particular practice grows? there
aay be a question of whether certain judgments of district
courts are authorised

if they war© in effect mads by magistrates.

That9& .not our primary concern.

That's a possible concern.

It has been raised in some cases•
QUESTION:

2 assume -that the D®parfcm®nt of Justice

has a certain minimal interest, at least, in finality and
that if the procedure is not authorized, then there may be
doubts at som© stags raised about th® finality of a determina­
tion»
MR. KIMMELs

There would be a question of the validity

of judgments which are obtained under this type of procedure.
*

W@ don't think that any ruling that the practice is unauthorized,
though, should result in a retrospective decision, but wa think
it should b® clarified at th® earliest possible time.what
this Magistrates Act means in this regard.
Now, our reasons for a limited construction of the
Magistrates Act are necessarily based on th© language,
legislative history, and purpose of th® Magistrates Act.
Mow, in terms of some perspective, X would lik© to
point out that th© major purpose of the Magistrates Act was to

8
invest magistrates with sp@eif.ic and limited duties in the
criminal area.

Uhder Section 636(a) of the let and the Federal

Rules of Criminal Procedure, magistrates are authorized, among
other things# to conduct preliminary hearings in criminal cases;,
issue search and arrest warrants, impose conditions of release,
and exercise jurisdiction over minor criminal offenses.
Th© legislative history of the Act deals primarily
with the functions of magistrates in th® criminal area and
statistic® ©f th© administrative office shew that of 255,000
matters disposed of by magistrates in the last fiscal year,
over 85 percent war© in the criminal area.

She remaining

15 percent of matters disposed of by magistrates -war® in the
civil area and war® composed chiefly of handling of pretrial
conferences and prisoner petitions.

Thase numbered 17,000 and

8,000 respectively in th© last fiscal year.
QUESTION?

Mr, Kixnmal, let me interrupt you again.

The amicus refers to pending legislation.

Do you know what

th® status of S, 1283 and any related bills is?
MR. KXMMEL:

Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmon.

S. 1283 is

presently under consideration by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
It was reported favorably by th® Subcommittee on Judicial
Improvements.

If that bill as reported by the subcommittee is

enacted, this case would become academic, if it's enacted,
because it would specifically authorize dispositive motions to
be handled by magistrates for a recommended decision.

9
But a similar bill, I understand, was introduced in
the House*

It was not approved as far as I know by the House

Ju&icary Committee.

And 2 don't know what th© status of the

question in the House is*
QUESTION2

Mr* Kimmel, you ar© going t© address

yourself to this language I assume "such additional duties
as «ira not inconsistent with th© Constituti,on and law»”
MR. KIMMELs

Yes, your Honor*

Of course, that is

the major issue in th® case starting with that language.
636(b) does state that district courts may assign to magistrates
such additional duties as are not inconsistent with th©
Constitution and laws of the United States•"
Mow, although this particular language, taken alone,
is capable of a broad construction, we interpret it in light
of its context aud th® legislative history and purpose of the
Act as reflecting limitations and the concern that constitutional
doubts or impediments be avoided.
QUESTION:

it also says a little later when they

outlined, they said "not restricted to."
there is any limitation in here.
MR. KXMMELs

So I don't see where

It looks like it's wide open.

Well, the language itself doss say

that it cannot be inconsistent with the Constitution or the
statutes»

Mow, that itself, w@ £@®1, merely reflects a.

conscious desire by th© Congress to limit it certainly to
those two aspects

10

How, the Sanat,© report explains i*is language.

It

explains the constitutional qualification in section 636(b)
that's Sanat® Report Ho. 371 — not in .terns of an affirmative
or maximal grant of power to district courts but in tanas of
a prohibition aml a safeguard against potential abuse.
Bo w® believe that the language was put in more for
th® purpose? of safeguarding abuses rather than to extend
maximal authority to district courts.

The use of the term

"in addition such duties® rather than 3all duties*8 or Bany
duties® again suggests a limited «te.te.tory intention rather
than a maximal statutory intention,
Tfa© amicus interprets 636(b) as affirmatively
authorizing maximal use of magistrates to the full extent
possible? under the Constitution and statutes.

But we question

whether Congress would have left in a statutory limitation if
it had really intended to authorise a maximal grant of authority.
It would mere likely have said, we think,"notwithstanding any
statute to the contrary,"

if it had intended to exercise

maximal power® in this regard.
The context of section 636(b) bears out, w® believe,
a limited statutory intention, Three examples of civil duties
are mentioned in section 636(b), and these examples are limited
in seep© and nature.

How, the examples are not exclusive,

w® recognize that, but they are expressly described in the
Senate report as intended to illustrate the general character

II
of duties assignable to magistrates*
th© three examples authorise reference to magistrates
of special master functions under the restrictions of Rule 53*
assistance to the judge in pretrial and discovery proceedings *
and making recommendations as to whether there should be a
hearing in habeas corpus cases.
Mon© of tiies© examples authorize magistrates to
exercise a contra! role in the adjudication of whole classes
of civil cases.

Rather, they authorize just limited or

ancillary functions except in special master cases under the
restrictions .of Rul© 53«
Going further in the legislative history* the
supporters and sponsore of the Magistrates Act explained
section 636(b) in very limited terms at the time this measure
was considered by the Congress. On© of the bill supporters*
Representative Poff,, at page 66 of the House hearings* stateds
“Many of the auua.es that now occupy -Federal judges are
ministerial* routine* and minor* yet nevertheless time* consuming.
!

-

/

\

Tha significant feature'of -the Magistrates Act is that it
would fra© a Federal judge fro® these less important procedural
tasks and enable him to devote more time and attention to
\

matters of substance.?i
QUESTION*

What does that really mean when you try

to boil it down in terras of what goes on in a courtroom?
functions of a judge are- really ministerial?

What

MR. KIMMELs

Ml tfe© procedural — 1 wouldn't say

ministerial, X admit,, but routine and not dispositive
litigation,

It would km all the preliminary procedural type

motions and the housekeeping kind of thing in regard fco
progress of civil litigation through the court.
actual decision of civil litigation.
QUESTION*

But not tfe®

There is a distinction.

How much time did judges spend before the

magistrates, though, on housekeeping attention to progress of
litigation through th® court?
HR. KIMMEL:

Well, I believe all procedural motions

had to b® decided by a district judge completely.
QUESTIONs

When you say “housekeeping,” you mean

discovery notions, motions for a mores definite statement,
that type of tiling?
MR,, KXMMBLt

Yes, your Honor.

Actually, there is a

listing of the kinds of duties that would be involved here
that are listed by th® Administrative Office in a checklist of
what magistrates could do, and it includes, for instance,
general supervision of the civil calendar, including th®
handling of calendar calls, motions to expedite and postpone
the ferial of cases, conduct of preliminary and final pretrial
conferences, status calls, settlement conferences, preparation
of pretrial orders.
QUESTION §

My question was basically a response to

your quotation of Congressman Poffs explanation.

X mean, th©

13
idea that it was to solve only the "ministerialw and"routine*
congestion» wouldn’t solve much at all# X would think.
MR. KXMMELs

Wall, 2 believe that this listing of

duties would eliminat® from the judge3® burdens a significant
amount.

Mow# th® number, for instance# of matters# ©secluding

the criminal# which was the main thing# was 36#000 matters
disposed of by magistrates in the last fiscal year.
QUESTIONS

X would dispute whether those can to®

called either ministerial or routine.

X mean# a pretrial

discovery motion can toe critical to the outcome of a case.
MR. KIMMELs

X agree with that.

And the point her©

is even when the magistrate does make an initial ruling# these
are again recommendations which are subject to review by a
judge# particularly in the event of an objection.

But tills

will eliminate many of those.

other part of what Representative Foff said# that the point ©f
relieving jduges of the minor burdens would to® so that judges
would have more time to devote to the actual substance of
litigation# to the actual decision of cases.

And 1 think that

that was the thrust# to make this distinction.
Senator Tydings# who was the chief sponsor of the
Act# explained# at page 73# that — he went so far a® to say

14
it was intended, 636 (b) , to relieve judges of aoim of the
routine nonjudicial burdone•

X actually wouldn’t call this

acting on discovery motions nonjudicial, but the point is,
•the lasser typ© of problems that used to face judges all the
time.
H@ also emphasised that district judges should b®
able as a result of this Act to devote more time to the actual
writing of opinions»
How, 'tli# Senate Report.Ho* 371 is probably

the

most informative statement of Congress of what its intent was
in enacting the additional civil duties provision in section
636(b)•

She report does not state that Congress intended to

confer full or maximal power to district courts to Invest
magistrates with civil jurisdiction-

The report speaks

generally of relieving district judges of some of their minor
burdens and of culling from the district judge’s workload
natters that are more desirably performed by a lower tier of
judicial officers.

The report further explained that the

reason why Congress authorised flexibility in fch© assignment
of additional civil duties to magistrates, that is, not
limited to the three examples, was not to relieve judges of
their adjudicatory responsibilities, but precisely the contrary,
so that there would b© increased time available to judges for
the careful and unhurried performance of their vital and
traditional adjudicatory duties.

15
How, on© of tha vital and traditional adjudicatory
duties of judges is the judicial review of administrative
record casos under the substantial evidence standard* including
Social Security cases.

Justice Frankfurter’s opinion in the

universal Camera case on th© responsibility of judges to review
the whole record in substantial evidence cases demonstrates
th© decision of these cases is not simply ministerial as th©
amicus asserts in its brief, but requires delicate judicial
judgment and a first-hand ©valuation of th© record.

If a

judge conscientiously performs this task in a Social Security
case,- including th® necessary review and ©valuation of "th®
administrative record* it appears he would b« duplicating
the work performed by a magistrate.

If h© does not, it

appears that he would not. be exercising th© adjudicatory
function which is expected of hi® under th© Magistrates Act.
Either way the practice which is authorised by this district
court rule seems to fee inconsistent with the purpose of th©
Magistrates Act to relieve district judges of non@7sen.tial
functions.
dilemma created by this procedure was spotted
by Judge Sprecher

in the decision in TPQ y..MaMl 1 lea, in which

he stated, *w@ do not think situations of this kind would be
remedied by th® magistrate simply recommending to the district
judge instead of adjudicating.*
We believe that on th® basis of th© legislative history,

16
as I say* that there is a limited intention by Congress not
to transfer the actual major responsibility in deciding civil
cases to magistrates.

Now, what Congress did do, though, in

the Magistrates Act, in the first example, that is, section
636(b)(1), was to actually authorise magistrates.to review
and recommend
Rule 53,

decisions as a special master*

That's under

This is the only place where Congress anywhere

focused on this kind of a role for magistrates.

But Rule 53

limite the -reference of civil cases to- special masters to
exceptional, casas whether detailed matters of account or
seme exceptional condition requires it.

it is meant to to® the

exception, not the rule,
&o this particular authority would certainly not

authorise

t\ blanket

reference

of all Social Security cases to

the magistrate as General order No. 104-D calls for.

Wa

realise that in general or traditionally the reference

to

masters has been generally in cases involving fact-finding
functions, but we don’t think that. Rule 53 is limited just to
fact-finding type of cases or cases involving factual disputes.
We think that Rule 53 concept involves the reference of any
kind of a civil case to a master or her© a magistrate as
master for a recommended decision on the merits.
QUESTION*

Thar© arc obvious differences between a

pretrial conference and a trial.

What would you focus on as

the distinction between this initial exploration by the

17
magistrate and th® pretrial procedar®?
MR. KXMMELs
QUESTIONS

Mr. Chief Justice -...

more than finals, to

begin with.
MR. KXMMELs

Technically, our problem certainly is

not final, and in th® protrial it's vary definitely not final.
The pretrial situation is simply to clarify issues, establish
the basic,routine and enter the schedule for trial, you might
say, and to limit unnecessary witnesses.

1 don’t think there

is any, in th© pretrial conference situation, any attempt by
a magistrate to actually decide th® case or to purport to
recommend how the case should be decided.

That's a very

useful function of magistrates, to -QUESTIONS

Is that subject to review by

MR, KIMMELs

Very definitely it's subject to review

18
not accept the magistrate*s decision.

W© recognise this, that

it is* « reccauaended decision*
QUESTION*

Option, or is it part ©f his inherent
1

power?
MR. KIMMELs

Wall, he has the power both under the

rule itself and inherently as a judge to decide the ease.
But we think -that whether or not a magistrate actually is
acting as a special master and cesses urtdsr the restrictions
there, the magistrate in this situation under this rule is
still exorcising significant adjudicatory responsibilities
in these casas, and that5® what we say is inconsistent with the
general purpose of the Act.

We do not think that Congress

intended to authorise the significant adjudicatory responsi”
oilities even where cast in the for® of a recommendation.

Who has the final say on this, the

MR. KIMMEL:

The judge, we recognise, from the

beginning has the option to decide the case and to include
a complete new adversary proceeding before him.

That does not

occur in practice, but it3 $ true that this rule -- and it
doesn't purport to go &o far as to have a magistrate decide

the cas®.

Do we have the practice before us?

MR. KIMMELs

Your Honor?
You say it doesn't happen in pr&ctlc®.

Do we have that before us?
MR,» KIMMEL:
QUESTION:

In our —
It isn't in this record.

MR. KIMMEL':

Wall, in our petition we did introduce

some statistics which tended to show what the actual practice
was.

ted X admit that they were not very widely based

statistics.

But all 1 can say is that from my own knowledge

the judge does not usually schedule a complete new round of
proceedings before him.

In fact, there is a great dial of

opposition to that suggestion expressed by many commentators
and judges because they feel that would definitely eliminate
the use of tine magistrate which ia to relieve judges of this
type of additional workload.
We think that even sifeera cast ia the form of a
recommendation, Congress did not contemplate this major type
of role for magistrates and especially without ~ not only

20
with, not saying so in the statist®, but not even mentioning it
in the legislative history that accompanied this statute, and
legislative history, as I indicated, seemed to indicat®
just ainor functions were intended.
How,where Congress has authorised officials other
than judges to exercise significant adjudicatory functions in
vM district courts, it has expressly said so.

Examples, of

course, would be the referee in bankruptcy, masters and
court of claims commissioners where these duties are spelled
out in clear terms in the statute»
QUESTION^

Do you think th® magistrate in the

situation liefore us now is exercising more or less power, if
you can make -the comparison, than a bankruptcy referee has
traditionally exercised?
MR. KIMDSSLs

Probably would to© about the sanas amount,

X would think, your Honor.

Though it's true, I believe, under

the bankruptcy statute the referee's decision is clothed
with finality unless a party objects to th© district judge»
I believe that is the way it works.

Whereas in the magistrate

situation, at least under this particular rule, it doesn't
purport to make it initially final unless a party Objects, but
it is simply handed to the district judge for th® district
judge to approve or object,

fc-ha quality of the function»
MR» KXMMEL:

The quality of the function is probably

about th-3 beam, but the point I was trying to make with the
example of referees in bankruptcy is that where Congress
intends such a major role, I think, in the official in question,
it spells it out, and it has with referees in bankruptcy.
Iheir dufci.es urea spelled out in detail in th® statute and
they are authorised tc
'

QUEFVXONs

But the referee in bankruptcy is dealing

with a precis© kind of function that is much easier of
definition, would you net agree, than the broad range of
authority that Congress appears to have at least contemplated
for magistrates?
MR. KXMMEL:

Well, I think, your Honor, that whether

it’s just bankruptcy or whether it.*s all civil cases, both
require there be some definition by Congress of whether it*s
intended the official — in fact,, more in th© cas© where a
magistrate can exercise a significant adjudicatory rol© in th®
whole broad category ©f litigation, that Congress at least
should indicate this, that this purpose is intended in wordsin th® statute and certs.inly in the legislative history.
Mow, we agree that transferring to magistrates th®

22

'

work of initial review of Social Security cases may additionally
lighten th® workload of district judges, and we also do not
doubt this may have benefits.

But w© think a question of

policy is involved, whether th© review of these cases should
be transferred to magistrates.

We don't think Congress went

that far when it ©Elected th© 1968 Act, and at best it enacted
e. general and ambiguous provision which simply did not com© to
grips with this particular problem.
If Congress wishes to establish authority for
magistrates to act in this capacity, it should consider th®
problem and enact a statute in clear terms 'which would
authorise it if it thinks its s sound practice.
QUESTION%

Your position has to ba that th© statute

doesn’t authorise what th® district court did h®r®.
ME. KIMME1;
Yes.

Should not

bm

construed to authorize it?

Or should not authorise it.
QUESTIONS

You can’t really say that perhaps it

authorised it, but it’s aofc wise to do it.
MR, KIMMEL:

Will, I think th© wisdom ©liters into it

in this way, that it is a matter where a policy question is
involved, if it’s in a statute, some reflection of that policy
should b© shown either in the statute language or in th®
legislative history.

It's not shown in regard to this, so

this Court, it seems to me, should defer to Congress and let
it specifically think what it wants don® with this problem.

23
How, Congress actually, as X mentioned before, has
a bill before it which would solve this problem.
authoris© magistrates to do this.

It would

X don9t know whether that

bill, though, will ba accepted or rejected.

And in the

circumstances, X don’t think that the Court should assume
'that Congress has already authorised the procedure in this
general and guarded measure that was enacted in 1968.
Wow, in sum, w© would urge the Court to adept an
interpretation of the Magistrates Act which would clarify
three things respecting civil jurisdiction of magistrates*
First, that the Act doss not permit the reference to
magistrates of -the merits of civil litigation, including
dispositive motions, except under the restrictions ©£ Rule S3.
Second, that, the Act would permit the reference of
most, preliminary procedural or nondispositiv© motions to
magistrates for review and initial ruling.
And, finally, any ministerial matter could be
referred to a magistrate for final action.
Now, in Social Security cases this would mean that
the judge would have to decide himself the case.

1?he

magistrates would still have,though,® great deal of authority
to relieve the burden on district judges.

The statistics

of the Mministrativ® Office, as I said, reflect that some

BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. EHREHHAFTs
'the Courts

Mr. Chief Justices, and may it please

I am honored and surprised to be h@r@ — honored

to be asked to be a friand of the Court in this case, a bit
surprised»as I gather some of you gentleman were» by the
Government5 s position in this case because it doe® not. oppose
this general rule adopted by the district court ©a
constitutional grounds» which I hud thought, might be © valid
basis for dispute.

The Government has conceded that the

general order adopted by the district court does comport with
constitutional requirements» so there is no further need for
us to debate that issue.

X agree with the Government that

this kind of a procedure is authorised by the Constitution.
Wi! therefore are limited to a discussion of whether
'f

the Magistrates Act fov it® terms authorizes the kind of
procedure which the district court, adopted and which 'the
court of appeals affirmed.

And in that connection I will

discuss three points?
om-g what kind of a cam is 'Mathews v« Weber» what
does the statutory tent say about that» and what light doss the
legislative history shed on that text?
What kind of a case is it?

Well, this has already

27

been discussed.

This soncams the review of the determination

by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare that
Mr. Weber is not entitled to a Medicare payment, and that
decision is t© b@ reviewed with tin© view of datemining
whether the decision is based upon substantial evidence in a
closed record.

There is no need, no opportunity, no right

on th© part of either the Secretary or Mr. Weber to introduce
*

new evidence, to bring witnesses before the court, no right
of any of them to do anything other than present legal
arguments baaed upon that closed record as to whether substantial
evidence exists in the record.

QUEST!01-3 s

12© you think prior to th® Magistrates Act

there could have been a rule of th# court that every Social
Security review case will be assigned to a special master?
MR. EBRENHAFTs

1 do not think so, because the

rules with regard to special masters is a different rule than
the creation of th® magistrate under the Magistrates Act.

As

2 plan to discuss later, I don't believe that the Magistrates
Act turned every magistrate deciding a 'civil case into a
master.

I believe that it9s intent was that if the magistrate
t)
is appointed as a master, Rule 53 applies to the magistrate

when he is. acting as a master, but the purpose of the
Magistrates Act was intentionally —

grant as the authorisation to us© magistrates as masters when

QUESTION:

Do you think there is some inference

from the — apparently you don't — that there is some
inference in the Magistrates Act that the magistrate * s role
in civil cases should be no greater than would be allowed a

I don’t believe that either th® text

or the legislative history supports such a construction, and
1 hops to address that in a moment.

QUESTIONs

All right»

QUESTIONS

May I just ask, Mr, Ehrenhaft, you

suggested that the authority, th© legislative authority tothe magistrate on a closed record.

MR. EHRENHAFTs
QUESTION %

Yes.

Does that imply not as a special master

but simply as magistrate?

The magistrate has no authority

to conduct hearings and hear witnesses?
MR. EHREHHAFTj

In this particular situation with

which we are dealing here, he can hear no witnesses. He is
taking a closed record and receive briefs and hears oral
.argument, but he hears no witnesses •

'He therefor© has no

occasion to consider fch© demeanor of witnesses, to assess
credibility.

His task is ©imply to cull the record for th®

substantial evidence that supports th© Secretary’s —■
QUESTIONt

That’s because, 2 gather, dealing with

Social Security oases, he would have no occasion or very
infrequently or exceptionally, I suppose, ever to hear any
■testimony,
MR. EHRENHAFTs

That’s exactly right.

And that’s

why I say the opinion of the court of appeals in this cx.se,
which I am supporting, specifically says we are dealing hare
with a Social Security review case, w@ are not dealing, wo
will reserve for another time other kinds of cases •

And

I'd like to suggest, for example, wingo v. Wadding in which

30-31
this Court first considered the Federal Magistrates Act
was that different kind of a case*

There was a situation in

which the magistrate was being asked to hear witnesses, to
make crucial factual determinations in the habeas corpus
context, and the Court said that that could not be reconciled
with tli© express language of the Habeas Corpus Act.

This is

not a case like TPO v. MaHlIiea, which Government counsel
cited, and in which the court of appeals for the Seventh
Circuit after reviewing the legislative history I believe
correctly said that a motion for summary judgment that
totally determines litigation is not appropriately submitted
to a. magistrate acting qua magistrate.

And this is a case,

as we have said, a Social Security Act case where a closed
record is reviewed and a recommended disposition only is
referred to the district judge who then can receive additional
briefs, who can then accept the recommendation of the
magistrate or reject it.
The fact that in the overwhelming number of cases
the district judges do accept the magistrate's disposition,
I suggest is not an adverse reflection on the district judges
that they are thereby abdicating their duty, but I would hop®
a reflection of the adequacy of the service being rendered by
the magistrates.

And in fact, there are a few cases that I

have cited in my brief in which district courts have disregarded
or changed a recommended disposition urged by the magistrates.

32
Well, the importance of this procedure, I think, is
highlighted by th© administrative office of th® court5s
fiscal year 1975 report.

It indicates that in 1975 5,800

Social Security Act cases ware filed in th® courts, or in a
pace exceeding approximately 100 a week.

Of course, these

cases are not uniformly spread throughout the district courts.
There are some in areas where there ar© coal mines in
particular where black lung cases apparently have generated
something like 559 Social Security Act cases in West Virginia
and Kentucky ass well, 800 in West Virginia, 500, and so on.
There is a great concentration of those at the present time
in those jurisdictions.
But. whether ws are talking about the Central District
of California, which is the jurisdiction from which this case
arose, Los Angeles, 78 Social Security Act cases were brought
in that district court and referred to magistrates during th®
fiscal year 1975»

So it is a significant role that magistrates

have been asked to perform in this case.
QUESTIONS

Besides Social Security oases, are

there others where single district judges review a closed
record?

Other agendas?
MR. EHBENHAFTs

Yes.

In General Order 104 there are

a number of additional kinds of cases -that are cited.

Now,

I have taken a quick look to see whether th© standards ar©
the same under those other statutes.

In many of them they are,

33
but 1 have not really don© research to ascertain the extent.
QUESTIONs

X just wonder — X mean# the Interstate

Commerce Commission, thxae~judge cousrt cases,

New legislation.

But do they use magistrates for those?
MR. EHBENHAFTi

2 don't know.

1 know that there are

military discharge review cases that ar© included in General
Order 104.

There ax® some NLRB review cases that may ha so

referred'.
Mow, the extent to which those also ar© to b© reviewed
on a closed record, as X say, 2 can't honestly say.
QUESTIONS

One gets the impression it was kind of

til® dogs that were referred to the masters, don't you think, or
to

magistrates?
MR. EHRENHAPTs

without characterising them- necessarily

that way, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think that you have put
your finger on an important distinction between the cases that
ar® referred to the magistrates and Rule 53, because the
reference to magistrates, I think, is exactly the opposite of
th© reference to a master that Rule 53 is intended to cover.
That is, it i« precisely th® routine cass that is th© kind of
a case that the magistrates can appropriately look at by
reviewing a closed record and that Rule 53 was addressing a
whole different problem.

That is the exceptional case where

th© court needs assistance from some outsider.

And I think

34
that Rui® 53 when, It said that only th© exceptional ce.se may
h® referred was drafted as it was to avoid th© abdication by
judges of important adjudicatory functions in difficult cases
where they didn’t want to decide or felt that their dockets?
were too crowded.

And th© legislative history of this Act

clearly indicates ■•that the Congr^»« recognised th® validity
of the Lajjgf„v.. Bower to.ather case here that references to
masters were to be restricted to -eho truly exceptional case.
QUESTIONS when did the present language of Rule 53
com® along- vis-a-vis th® If Buy
MR, EHRENHAFT%

decision in this Court?

1 believe it preceded, but 1 am not

100 percent sure of that.

Th«s concept'that was expressed

certainly has a long tradition, there was hostility to
references to masters ©van preceding the to Buy case.
As we have said earlier, the language of the
Magistrates Act is not as clear as it might ha with respect to
the additional duties that a magistrate may perform.

But 1

would like to just briefly touch on one point that Government
counsel mads for th© first time in his argument here, which
concerns th® use of th® words “such additional duties" which
he has suggested is somehow a limitation on the duties of the
magistrate because it would refer to the three illustrative
subsections of section (to),

And looking at section 636 of the

Magistrates Act as a whole, 1 note that section 636(a)
indicates that the magistrates serving under this chapter shall

35
have th® following duties, including those that had
traditionally been performed by United States Commissloners *
and the pother to administer oaths.» and th® power to conduct
trials in petty criminal cases*

(b) then gom on to say

that th® district courts may by rule establish, assign such
additional duties as may b@ specially designated*

ted 1

believe the use of the word "such additional duties" flows
from additional t© subsection (a) rather than being a
reflection of the examples that are listed in th® following
portions of subsection lb)*
What light does the legislative history shed on this
statute?

I have suggested in my brief that not only does

th® legislative history reflect a desire on th© part of th©
draftsmen of this legislation. Senator Tydings, Representative
Poff, and others, to provide as wide ranging a use of
magistrates as is consistent with th® Constitution and with
statutory law, but that th® Judicial Conference of the United
States which actively supported this legislation with th©
limitations that are now contained in subsection <b) and which
has supported

this legislation ever sine® has always interpreted

it to include precisely this kind of servi.ee by magistrates*
And a subsequent Act of Congress raising the salaries of
magistrates specifically referred with approval to the duties
performed by magistrates in reviewing Social Security casee.
And I don't say that subsequent legislative- history is

36
an infallible and the most appropriate guide at all to mat
a previous Congress meant, but 1 do cite it to show that it is
not in any way inconsistent with a continuum of legislative
intent that, magistrates be dignified, as para judges of the
district courts, able to assist judges in performing duties
such as those — perhaps not dogs, but in any event of a
routine character

which would enable the district judges

to reserve their time and attention to other matters more
serious perhaps•

not, Mr, Ehranhaft, only paragraph {&) of Roman numeral X

405(b) is precisely the owm that w©

are Involved with bare, yes.
Therefore, to sum up, it*s my contention

if

there are no constitutional doubts which neither the Government
nor I seem to have in this case, the legislation is sufficiently
broad to encompass this kind of duty, and X would plac® the
burden on those who believe that it would not fee appropriate
so to interpret the statute to change it through congressional
action rather than the other way around.
