BURGER;

Mrs. de Rodon,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. MIRIAM NAVEIRA d© RODON,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MRS, DE RODON;

Mr, Chief Justice- may it pleas©

the Court;
This case comes up before this Court on an appeal
from a decision of a three-judge district court in Puerto Rico,
which, in a divided opinion, declared unconstitutional the
citizenship requirement of Section 689 of Title 20
Laws of Puerto Rico Annotated,

of the

The pertinent part is printed

in italics on page 10a and following of the Jurisdictional
Statement.
Appellees are resident aliens who applied to the
Examining Board of Engineers in Puerto Rico for registrations
as a licensed engineer.

And even though they were non-citizens,

they did not attempt to establish their eligibility under
Section 689 by demonstrating that they had studied the total
courses in Puerto Rice?,
The Examining Board denied them the application and
appelles, instead of availing -themselves of the review established
by law in Section 701, immediately repaired to the federal
courts and applied under the jurisdiction of the Civil Rights

4
1983 and its jurisdictional counterpart, 1343»
It should be noted that Section S89 has never been
construed by the .local courts, and that the courts of Puerto
Rico are courts of general jurisdiction, empowered to grant all
remedies which can be granted by the federal courts? and, of
course, the review can finally be granted to this Court»
Appellees are at present, as far as I was able to
ascertain, working for the Government of Puerto Rico or its
municipalities under a special license as provided by Section
689 of that very same lav/»
This case is of the utmost importance to the Common”
wealth of Puerto Rico, and it has great significance because it
raises two very important issues to uss

whether Section 1983

of the Civil Rights Act and its jurisdictional counterpart,
Section 1343, are applicable to Puerto Rico»
And, second, whether the district court should have
abstained from passing upon the interpretation and validity
of the statute which had never been construed by the Common”
wealth courts,
QUESTIOHs

Is there also a

question of whether the

Fourteenth Amendment applies to Puerto Rico?
MRS» DE RODONs Well, neither this Court nor the
Circuit Court nor the District Court has ever found it necessary
to determine whether the due process of the Fourteenth or the
Fifth Amendment is applicable, since it found -that tha

5
fundamental rights of the Constitution are applicable to the
people of Puerto Rico, arid we think that that is the best way,
not to specifya
QUESTION s

But you do concede that either the

Fourteenth Amendment or the Fifth Amendment is applicable to
the people of Puerto Rico, —>
t

MRS„ DE RODONs
QUESTIONS

Yes „

— and that the net result is the same,

whichever.
MRSo DE RODONs
QUESTION;

Yes0

That is, the due process clause of the

Fourteenth Amendment, —
MRSo DE RODONs
QUESTIONS

Y@s0

— and that the due process clause of the

Fifth Amendment also embraces the concept of equal protection.,
MRS. DE RODONs

Yes„

It should be noted at present -the misuse of Section
1983 and its jurisdictional counterpart, 1343, in the federal
District Court of Puerto Rico has literally flooded the Court
with all conceivable types of cases, in which every facet of
government action and decision-making, whether major or minor,
is being questioned? to the point where there is a real
question as to who is really running the government.
QUESTION;
States of idie Union?

Is that, different than from the fifty

6

MRS. DE RODONj
Rico the

I believe so, sir, because in Puerto

civil rights actions that are being filed

are not

being filed, let’s say, like in the prisoner cases and racial
discrimination cases or in certain definite type of cases.
In Puerto Rico they cover ©very government facet, for example
I will give you an examples
The removal of employees, the approval of probationary
periods, the transfer of employees, the disciplinary actions.
Instead of going through the administrative processes available
in law, they will repair to the federal court and the federal
court will assume jurisdiction and there will be a trial, a
complete -— the thing will be seen in the federal court.

If

the government announces a policy!' that it plans to drill oil
in the outlying skirts, or that it plans to mine copper,
immediately we get an action in the federal courts, and the
court does assume jurisdiction, find the whole procedure goes
on.
And I think that if one examines the types of actions
that are b«sing followed, on® finds that there is definitely a
difference between the fifty States and Puerto Rico.
Appellees invoked the district court’s jurisdiction
solely on the basis of Section 1343 and Section 1983 of the
Civil Rights Act.

And we submit that neither apply nor were

intended to apply to Puerto Rico.
Our arguments are based on the Carter case, which was

7
decided by this Court and declared that neither Section 1983
or its jurisdictional counterpart» 1343» were applicable to the
District of Columbia,,
Now» in the case of the Commonwealth, as well as in
the case of the District of Columbia» to determine whether a
statute is applicable» one must examine not only the words but
also the context, the purpose, 'and the circumstances ir. which
the words are being used.
Sections 1983 and 1343 have their roots in 'the Ku Klux
Klan Act of 1871» when it was first enacted fco cower just
StatesB

It was not until 1874» when the substantive measure —

that is» the one 1983 was amended to include -the Territories»
No such amendment was mad® to the jurisdictional part.
It was in 1875 that the district courts got general
jurisdiction over federal questions, and it was not until 1898
that the United States acquired Puerto Rico, after the Spanish-»
American War.
Ever since the very beginning, in the Insular cases,
Puerto Rico has been considered an unincorporated Territory,
not in-tended for Statehood»
And this Court, in Carter, said, when expressing its
view on the Territories covered by Section 1983» that they were
applicable to Territories in © transitory nature» in the
process of becoming a State.
In 1952» the people of Puerto Rico and the people of

e
Puerto Rico entered into a complex and thereby created a new
sovereign entity within the federal political structure» the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
Now» as stated in Carter» the Section 1983 was designed
to apply to States and to Territories which were in the process
of becoming a State.

Puerto Rico is neither.

Furthermore» the conditions upon which Section IS83
was intended — or had intended to correct» wer© never present
in Puerto Rico.

The courts of the Island have always been

able and willing to vindicate the civil rights of individuals»
and have the power and the procedural mechanism to grant all
remedies that may b© granted by federal courts.
We submit that in the absence of a more definite
guidance from Congress» Section 1983 and 1343 should ict be
held applicable to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
On the abstention question» wa think that this Court»
in the Calero-Tol^do case» rendered an .abstention doctrine which
is quite wide and liberal for the Commonwealth.
the Wackenhut opinion» it stated:

Citing from

Due regard to the statutes

of the Commonwealth under its compact with the United States
dictatas that it should have the primary opportunity through
its courts to determine tin® intended scope of its own legisla­
tion and to pasr: upon the validity cf that legislation under its
own as well as under the Constitution of the United States.
QUESTION:

I gather this is an argument only if you

9

fail on the first one* is that it?
MRS„ DE RODONx

Yes, of course, on. the alternative-

In this case, where the statute in question has never
been construed by the courts of the Commonwealth, and where it
may vary well be interpreted in such a way as to avoid the
constitutional question, abstention, we think, would be very
appropriateSection 689 does not contain an absolute prohibition
against non-citizens obtaining licenses-

What is meant, by

total courses has never been interpreted by the Supreme Court
of Puerto Rico, and could very well be interpreted to mean
courses directly related to the peculiarities of a poor, overpopulated, small tropical island, subject to such tropica.!
hazards as earthquakes, hurricanes and flash floods*

The Supreme Court of Puerto Rica has been reluctant
to attribute to the Legislature an intention to pass a statute
raising constitutional problems, especially when the legis­
lative intent is not clear, as in this case, where there is
practically no legislative history to

go upon-

It should also bs noted that the Constitution of
Puerto Rico contains, besides a general equal protection clause,
a specific prohibition against discrimination on account of
race, color, sex, birth, social origin, or condition, or
political or religious ideas-

If a statute does not

measure up to these constitutional principles and standards,

10

th© courts do not have to reach the federal constitutional
question»
As was recognized by this Court in th© Cal©ro-Toledo
case, th© relationship between the United States and Puerto
Ric© has been -the object of numerous debates in its inter™
national forums, especially in the United Nations, where the
creation of a Commonwealth in 1952 prompted the United States
to cease transmitting information concerning Puerto Rico under
Article 73c of th® Charter, which deals with non-self-governing
Territories»

Thus recognizing that a new independent

sovereign entity had been created within the constitutional
structure»
Whether Puerto Rico has two internal self-government
is debated still in the international community, especially
by the Third World»

Thus, that this be so in fact as well as

in theory is important to both the United Statas and Puerto
Rico,
We submit, therefore; that the abstention in this
case, in th© case of Puerto Rico, is specially appropriate,
and in accord with th© Compact between tea United States and
Puerto Rico, and with the deference that 'this Court has always
»
shown to the courts of the Commonwealth®
As this Court rightly pointed out in the Fcmaris
case, the relations of the federal courts to Puerto Rico have
often raised delicate problems.

This is ©specially true today.

II
When th© misuse of Section 1983 and 1343 has produced a
fantastic increase in the number of cases filed in the courts of
Puerto Rico, and has led to an ever»increasing intervention of
the federal judiciary into practically all aspects of govern­
mental functions and even minor decision-making.
But even more disturbing “than all this is th.® fact
that federal juries have been handing down incredibly high
amounts of damages in oases of this kind»
For example, they awarded $250,000 in damages in a
case involving th© removal of a local government employee
where a violation of due process was alleged, based on a federal
court interpretation of a local statuta which had never been
construed by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico.
QUESTIONs Were those compensatory damages or punitive
damages?
MRS. DE RODQN:

They ware divided? in compensatory —

they granted $100,000 in actual damages and I think $150,000
in punitive damages.
This case is actually on appeal before th© First
Circuit.
It should be borne in mind that the language require­
ment. of federal jury service in Puerto Rico makes th© federal
jury a vary? selective one.

For a large portion of th© Island’s

inhabitants are not sufficiently bi-lingual as to enable them
to qualify for jury service? Spanish being the native tongue.

12
Under Section 1983 and 1343, as I have already told
this honorable Court, soma purely local matters are taken
before the court, and the court does assume jurisdiction®
All these cases which I’m talking about are normally
taken directly to “the federal court, bypassing the administrative
procedures available and the local courts®’

We even have the

situation where those cases which are pending, applications
for dismissal are mad®, and people repair to the federal
courts*

No allegation is mad© that the administrative or local

procedures are inadequate; itss just that 'they prefer the
federal forum*
The congestion of the court calendar that has ensued
has made it necessary sometimes to set cases for Saturdays,
and for after five o’clock during the week.
We have had cases which have lasted until after
midnight®
QUESTION %

Mrs® d® Rodon, let me ask you, if I may,

about the language in which the federal court proceedings are
conducted, arid then the language in which the Commonwealth
court proceedings are conducted,
MRS® DE- RODONt

Yes* The federal court proceedings

are all conducted in English? the local court proceedings are
all conducted in Spanish, save if the right of the individual
before the court would be put in jeopardy, then they are
carried on in English*

13
QUESTIONs Well# then, that certainly puts at a
disadvantage many lawyers, I suppose, who represent clients who
speak only Spanish and who are brought into the federal court.
MRSo DE RODOMs Well, also, the federal bar in Puerto
Rico is also very selective,,

You find that ther© are

few

lawyers who practice in the federal bars, in contrast with tha
amount of lawyers that practice in the local bar.

And not

always by choice, but because of great difficulty in the language*
We have had a bill pending before Congress to try to
remedy that, but still the proceedings have to h© conducted in
English.
And this is ©specially -“if the Court will pardon
me the digression •—* this is especially sad, in the case where
you have a criminal or an accused person before the court, who
speaks no English, and you have to have translators, where
everybody in that court speaks Spanish? yet you hav© to go
through 'the role of translating something that everybody under­
stood in the original language, anyway.
QUESTION s

I suppose that your argument is confined

to Puerto Rico, and yet I suppose we have to think of, if wa
were to decide in your favor, of the possible application of it
to Guam and the Virgin Islands, and others. Do you have any
confluent on that at all?
MRS. DE RODONs

Well, I think that the test is that

you should analyze the situation in each case in particular.

14
and find cut if the same situations that are in Puerto Rico
will be in Guam or to© Virgin Islands, in order to determine
whether they would be in toe same position as we are, and the
decision should be the same.
QUESTION %

That would have, to —

But your Act is different from any of toe

others, is it not?

MRS„ DE RODON %
QUESTIONS

Excuse me?

The *53 Act, or whatever it is, for

Puerto Rico is different from any other one, is it not?
MRS» DE RQDONs

Yes„

Yeso

After the 1952 Act,

V

Puerto Rico is toe only Commonwealth

that's the only

Commonwealth position within the federal structure, yes? that's
true.

There is none other like it.
QUESTION;

That’s what I thought.

MRS. DE RODONs
QUESTION;

Actually -- yes?

May I ask;

you're familiar with our

decision in the Bivens case?
MRS„ DE RODON;

Excuse m©?

QUESTION; Are you familiar with our decision in the
Bivens, B-i“V~@-n-s, case?
MRS. DE RODON;

If you could. refresh my memory — I

don't -QUESTION; Well, I just wondered, that was a case in
which we dealt with the possibility in toe District of Columbia,
notwithstanding 1983 — does not apply to the District of

15
Columbia because it's not a Stats or Territory within 1983»
It might, nevertheless , perhaps be an action for alleged
deprivation of constitutional rights in the federal courts of
the District»

Without reference to 1983»

MRS» DE RODONs
QUESTIONS

Yes»

Did you consider that?

MRS» DE RODOHs

No, I didn’t, Your Honor? I'm sorry»

I would like to finish by stating that I think the
Court should b® aware, at present we have 106 cases filed and
pending against Commonwealth officials in ‘the federal courts
and about 80 to 85 of these are predicated on Section 1983 and
1343»
These casas cover, as I told you, not just a few
phases but every phase of government action that could be
imaginable»

I think the Commonwealth is advocating that the

invasion into the Commonwealth governmental functions by the
federal judiciary is not only having an undesirable
}

paralyzing effect on government officials, due to the extraordin­
arily high awards that are gotten in the federal courts, but
it is also

causing a tramatic damage into the relations of

Puerto Rico and the United States»
I think that, as this Court has already indicated in
the Wackenhut. and the Ca.lero~Tol®do cases, and we agree, the
doctrine for abstention for Puerto Rico should be liberally
construed and applied? and we submit that in this case the

16

district court should have abstained,
QUESTIONS

The Compact, was 1952, —•

MRS, DE RODONs
QUESTIONi

Yes,

— wasn’t it?

MRS, DE RODONs

In 1952,

QUESTIONs Do you think prior to 1952, and subsequent
to 1917 when citizenship was granted, do you think 1983 was
applicable then?
MRS, DE RODONs Well, 1983, like I said before, the
conditions which it was intended to correct were naver passed,
but
QUESTION?

Yes, I know, but you’re also relying in

part on the Compact.
MRS. DE RODONs
QUESTIONs

Yes.

And I'm just trying to go foeick to the

pre*--Compact days end wonder whether the situation would be any
different, without the Compact to rely on?
MRS. DE RODONs

Well, it has to be jurisdictional,

because 1343 was never amended to include Territories, it just
included States? and that was approved under the Fourteenth
Amendment.

I don’t think — never intended to cover Territories.

And in 1375 it was that the federal district courts got general
\

federal question jurisdiction? and in th© relations Act, the
For alter Act and the Jones Act and the Federal Relations Act
that have applied to Puerto Rico, and they have a clause

17
concerning the district courts of Puerto Rico, they mention
that in the District Court of Puerto Rico has the same juris­
diction as courts in the United States, hut if Territories were
not included in, as part of 1343, then that would not have mad©
it applicable? they would have to go under the general federal
question jurisdiction*
Thank you very much*

Mr* d© Arellano*

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAX RAMIREZ de ARELLANO, ESQ*,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR* DE ARELLANO?

Mr* Chief Justice, and may it

plaase the Courts
Before I enter into my argument proper, I would just
like to male© two comments on Mrs* B<a Radon’s introduction*
First of all, in the matter of no showing of
eligibility, the fact is, and this is a fact, in both these
cases, that these plaintiffs
are completely eligible for
>
unconditional licenses as engineers„

Except for the requirement

of citizenship, -they have met every single other requirement
under Section 60S, Title 20«
Secondly, the matter of the multiplicity of civil
rights actions in Puerto Rico, I think that's a wonderful tiling,
not a terrible thing*

It shows, I think her' statistics show

and prove the great need in Puerto Rico for the statute.
QUESTION?

Well, the, need for it would have very little

18

to do with tli© jurisdiction? is that so?
MRo DE ARELLANO:

That is true, Mr, Justics»

In any case, though, 1 think this Court is faced with
a constitutional question ©f the first order,

Th© effect of

denying — of accepting th© Commonwealth argument in this case
is to deny the three million citizens of the United States
resident in Puerto Rico coverage under the Fourteenth Amendment?
that is, denial against violations of their rights protected
by th© Fourteenth Amendment
QUESTIONs

of the United States,

Well, you mean that if 1983 is inapplicable

to Puerto Rico, there 'isn’t any other source of jurisdiction
of tl:e substantive right in tea district courts?
MR, DE ARELLANO:

Only — it would have to be under

the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of tee United States,
QUESTION:

I know, but what about our Bivens

decision?
MR, DE ARELLANO:

I’m not familiar with the decision

in that,
QUESTION: Well, what about proceeding under 1331, as
long as you can allege $10,000?
MR, DE ARELLANO:

As a federal question, y©s, —-

well, the first limitation is the jurisdictional amount, of
course,
QUESTION; Well, that’s satisfied in this case, isn’t
it?

19
MS,, DE ARELLZiNQ:

It might be»

The Solicitor

Generals, in his brief, thinks it might be»
QUESTIONS

Well, let’s assume: ~ do you think that

if you do not prevail in this case, if you lose this case, would
you think it would mean that you could not proceed under 1331?
MR„ DE ARELLANOs
QUESTIONs

I think I could, Your Honor, y<as„

You think you could proceed, and if you

could satisfy the jurisdictional amount requirement, you could
sue government officials under 1331?
MR» DE ARELLANOs

Raising tha federal question, yes*

QUESTIONS Well, it’s fairly ~ a constitutional ques­
tion is fairly federal, isn’t it?
MR» DE ARELLANOs

Of course,

QUESTION:

Yes .

QUESTIONS

Did the argument you were making e moment

ago suggest that there was some constitutional problem if
Congress chce© to exclude Puerto Rico from toe ambit of 1983, or
1343?
MR, DE ARELLANOS

Mo,

No*

No,

The Court Is faced

with the matter of statutory interpretation of the Act — to®
scope of 1983, because the

Fourteenth Amendment, as

i under­

stand it, does rot apply par sc to the Territories.
It was applied to Territories in 1874, through Section
19 83,,
The main contention of the Commonwealth in -this case

2G
is that under this Court's decision in District of Columbia v&„
Cartar^ there is no jurisdiction under Section 1334, because —
they try to raise a syllogism in this case, they say that the
District of Columbia was found to be sui generis

in the

constitutional scheme, and that Puerto Rico is also sui generis
in the constitutional scheme„
They say, under Carter, the Civil nights Act was found
not to apply? therefore, it doesn't apply in Puerto Rico»

X

think this is a false syllogism.
In Carter, this Court was also faced with the matter
of statutory interpretation:

what was the scope of Section

1983?
In trying to find this jscope# it went back to the old
case of Puerto Rico vs. The Shell Company, where it stated that
it was the character and aim of a statute which serves to define
the terms of the statute.
And specifically in Carter, the scope of tha term
"State or Territory”? and the Court asked, What was the purpose
of the 1874 amendment to Section 1983,
And it found -chat it was the intent of Congress, when
it amended the Civil Rights Act, to extend the Fourteenth
Amendment protaction to tha Territories, acting under Article
XV of the Constitution of the United States, the territorial
power.
The reasons for this — that is, the reasons for

21
Congress in passing this amendment were that it had experienced
certain difficulties controlling what were then far-flung
Territories , and Congress had delegated some of its law-making
power to Territorial Legislatures.

Therefore , these two factors

combined to make th® Territories more like States, insofar as
problems of civil rights jurisdiction ware concerned»
Therefore, they equated Territories with States
insofar as Section 1983 was concarnesd.
The District of Columbia, on the other hand, in that
cars®, was found to be under the direct control and supervision
of Congress, it's the seat of the national government, 'therefore,
th© reasons that Congress had in extending the Fourteenth
Amendment protection to the Territories did not exist in to©
case of th® District of Columbia,
QUESTION; So would it

be

your position, then, that

1983 would not have applied to Puerto Rico up until 1952, but
afterwards it did?

Because

MR. DE ARELLANOs

No,

No, on toe contrary, under

Shell Company, it would have to apply — it would have bean held
to apply, had to© issue been raised, to pre-1952 Puerto Rico.
I don’t think there can be any doubt about that»
QUESTION; Well, didn’t Congress — when did Congress
lose its

general authority to legislate for Puerto Rico?
MR» DE ARELLANOs

My contention is that it hasn’t.

QUESTION; Well, then, why isn’t it governed by

22
District of Columbia vse Carter?
MRo DE ARELLANOS Because Puerto Rico, in 1952, gained
a certain amount of autonomy, and it is this autonomy which has
made it more like a State,
QUESTION %

But I thought that certainly one of the

tests in Carter was the fact that Congress wouldn't have wanted
to give a special causes of action in federal courts to people
whose grievances could he corrected by Congress itself?
And I would take it that would be true in the case of
Puerto Rico# if Congress still has general legislative
authority,
MR, DE ARELLANOs
Territories,

Well# it's true in any of the

In other words# Congress can act in Puerto Rico

under Article IV, and grant

and correct whatever grievances

it may think need correcting.
This is both after and — before end after 1952,
QUESTION;

Doesn't Calero help you to some extent?

MR, DE ARELLANOs

Yes,

Calero-Toledo recognized or

-« that in amending Section 1983# Congress was acting under
Article IV.

And that it also ~~ except in that same footnote

states "that it was not necessary in that case to decile whether
it was tlia Fifth or Fourteenth. Amendment which applied to
Puerto Rico.
QUESTION s

But is that the case that held that a

statuta of Puerto Rico is a statuto of toe Statos for purposes

23
of three-judge court jurisdiction?
MRo DE ARELLANOs

Yes,

For th© purposes of three-

judge court jurisdiction.
QUESTIONS

Unh-hunh.

MR. DE ARELLANOS

Now* each of thes© appellat®

statutes is treated separately and differently by this Court.
So* to get back to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question*
if I may* the — applying Shell Company to Puerto Rico at the
present time* we find that Puerto Rico is autonomous as to
local matters.

Thar® is no direct control as a practical

matter right now by Congress.

There's no day-to-day super­

vision th© way there is hex:® in th© District.

Therefore*

Puerto Rico is the type of place where Congress wanted Section
1983 to apply* when it amended it.
QUESTION?

Do you think that since Congress granted

th® District home rule a year ago* two years ago, tlx© result
should now be different in Carter?
MR, DE ARELLANO;

1 don't know how far home rule goes,

or whether there are any actual ©lections in it ~~ I’m not
f-

fand liar with home rule at all.
QUESTIONs
as Puerto Rico does.

Well, they have independent courts, just
They don't have Senators or Congressmen*

as Puerto Rico does not.

There are certain simirities, are

there not?
MR. DE ARELLANO;

Yes, but still there's ths question

24

that this is the seat of the national government, it's the
place created by the Constitution itself.

And I don't think

Puerto Rico can b® equated to the District of Columbia in the
cons titutiona1 s cheme0
They both may be uni qua, but it's a different type of
uniqueness.
QUESTIONS Well; I gather your submission is that
Puerto Rico remains a Territory.
MR. DE ARELLANO?
QUESTION?

For purposes *~~

Within the meaning of 1983. sines even

the Commonwealth Act# I gather, constitutionally has its source
in tins authority of Congress to regulate 'the Territory.
MR.

DE ARELLANOi

The Committee Reports to Public

Law 600 specifically so stated.
QUESTION?

Yes.

MR. DE ARELLANOS

They stated that this Public Law

600 was a further act in the administrafction of Territories
under Article IV of the? Constitution.
So the question is, whether after 1952 Puerto Rico
became any different as regards Section 1983.
QUESTIONs Well, if there are, whatever the differences
are between the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, is Puerto
Rico not more independent, and unique, than the District of
Columbia, as compared with cur States?
MR. DE ARELLANO:

I was going to say it's more like

25
a Stat® than It is lik© the old~iim® Territories»
QUESTION* Well, it does not have representation in
th© Congress»
MR» DE ARELLANO:

Well, there is a Resident Comrais~

sioner, who does not hav© a vote»
QUESTION:

Well, do you vote in federal elections?

MR» DE ARELLANO:
QUESTION:

Th© District of Columbia people do»

MR» DE ARELLANO %
QUESTIONs

Ho, sir»

Because the Constitution so provides»

Only very recently»

Is there not much more reason for Puerto Rico to
maintain an autonomy of traditions and customs and culture?
Thara is in -»
MR»

It*? ARELLANO:

QUESTION:

That’s all very fin® — £*ia sorry»

Than th© District of Columbia, fcr

example?
MR. DE ARELLANO:

That’s all very ~~ yes? as long

as the Commonwealth government does not start impinging on
rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States»
That’s as far as they can go»

That’s as far as any State can

go, that’s as far as any Territory can go, that’s as

car as

the District of Columbia can go»
I don’t think Puerto Rico has the right to go any
farther than the District of Columbia, than the federal
government, or than any other State or Territory»

26

QUESTIONS

Wall, if we had held otherwise in Carter,

at least the courts into which the Stata — or District
respondents.-would have been brought, albeit federal courts,
would have been one that presented no language problem.

Now,

I certainly concede that you don’t us© that as a test for
deciding whether the statute applies, but if you’re thinking of
the matfear as rather closely balanced, it does strike n® that
the federal courts down there may be a fairly inhospitable
forum to people who don’t speak the language in which it’s
conducted.
MR. DE ARELLANOs

Well, Your Honor, the language

problem, I mean it's the same for everybody before the court,
both plaintiffs and defendants.
Second, X don’t think the proper solution to the
language problem would b© to say that there are no more
civil righto in Puerto Rico? ftop solution is to say, Well,
let the district court in Puerto' Rico conduct its proceedings
in Spanish.
How, it is my contention, the contention of plaintiffs
in this caee, that after 1952, if anything, Puerto Rico became
more like a State than anything ©is®.

I should point out that

sine® 1952 not a single federal statute that had been hsld to
apply to Puerto Rico before 1952 has ever been held inapplicable
to post-1952 Puerto Rico.
In other words, to hold now that Section 1983 doesn’t

27

apply would be the first time that 'this Court, or any court so
far as I know, has held that a federal statute applicable to
pre-1952 Puerto Rico is inapplicable to post»’1952 Puerto Rico,
Going back again also to The Shell Company case,
w@ have to find — we have to look at the intent of Congress in
1952 when it granted Puerto Rico the power to draft its
Constitution,
I think it is quite ©vident that Congress was very
concerned -that the constitutional rights, United States
constitutional rights be preserved in Puerto Rico after 1952,
The resolution, the Joint Resolution approving the Constitution
c£ Puerto Rico provided that the Constitution would not go into

effect unless it conformed with the applicable provisions of
the Constitution of the United States,
Section 2 of the Federal Relations Act, which was
continued in effect by Public Law 600,

equates Puerto Rico

with a State of the Union, insofar as the rights, privileges
and immunities of its citizens are concerned,
It*s interesting that this is the same language used
in Section 1983,
Whan Congress was studying the proposed Constitution,
it required an amendment to the proposed
effect that the applicable —

Article VII, to trie

that no subsequent amendment to

the Puerto Rico Constitution would be passed that did not
conform to -the applicable provisions of the United States

28
Constitution,»

The Conference Report to Senate 3336, which

later became Public Law 600, stated that this matter —- that
is, thatthe proposed Puerto Rico Constitution and Public Law
600

would be a fundamental contribution, and 1 quote, "A

fundamental contribution to the art and practice of the
government and administration of Territories under the
sovereignty of the United States 0
In other %/ords, Congress —• Public Law 600 and the
Constitution of Puerto Rico are merely a further step in the
administration of Territories under Article IV of the
Constitution of the United States„
Finally, on this point, the

it is also clear from

the legislative history surrounding Public Law 600 that the
changes brought about by the law were only matters of ’"'purely
local concern*„

This is a quote from the Committee Report to

Public Law 600<,
So, In concluding on tills point, the argume.it of
the Commonwealth that, at least to the conclusion that
Congress abdicated its responsibility under Article 17, that
it just withdrew Section 1983 protection from post-1932 Puerto
Rico, is contrary to all the legislative history surrounding
Public Lav/ 600 *
Now, if -this Court finds that Puerto Rico is a
State or Territory within the meaning of Section 1983, then
the substantive matter presented to the Court in this case, I

29

submit; has already been decided by the ease of In re Griffiths»
Nevertheless, the Commonwealth is arguing that

it is

entitled to a broader or more liberal test regarding its
justification for the discrimination against aliens.
I should point out that th© discrimination here is
not against just these plaintiffs, it*s not a personal
discrimination it*s an across-the-board discrimination.
Th© justification presented by the — or ths reasons
why th© Coinmonwea 1 th thinks it should ba entitled to a broader
test or a more liberal test is, first of all, because of its
special position in the -- or, rather, becaus© it's different
from a State of tea Union, and, second, because of ths specific
factual situation existing in present-day Puerto Rico.
On the first point, th© position of the Commonwealth,
it is my contention that constitutional uniqueness — cr
uniqueness under 'the constitutional scheme, or in the constitu­
tional scheme, is not. th® same as exemption from the require­
ments of that constitutional scheme.
Th© test of a justification should not be the position
of the governmental authorities imposing the discrimination,
but, rather, the effect of that discrimination on the parson
being discriminated against.

The aliens in this case don't

care whether, I don't know, the federal government or a
territorial government

or the government of something called

the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico denying them equal protection

30
under the laws.

They are still being denied equal protection

of th© laws.
And the effect is that they are being denied their
right to work, to axerci.se their profession, solely because
they are aliens.
In -their brief, the Commonwealth cites, or refers to
general unemployment figures in Puerto Rico, but it does not
cite what it should cite, which is the unemployment figures for
engineers in Puerto Rico, They do not cite general per capita,
income — I mean they do cite general par capita incomefigures? they don’t cite per capita income figures for engineers.
The reference to illegal immigration, I believe, is
completely irrelevant,

No showing was made that immigration

tends to b© among professionals or engineers or anything of the
sort, and I’m sure this Court will agree that no such showing
could probably be made.
Parenthetically, the Commonwealth, in its brief, seems
to say on page 20 that the States have th© right to regulate
what they call the influx of aliens through their borders,
I submit that this is incorrect, going back at least as far as
Hines vs, Lavidowitz in 1941.
On the matter of employment of engineers in Puerto
Rico, just ten days ago the president of the University of
Puerto Rico, Dr. Arturo Morales Carrion, was quoted in an
interview in a local newspaper, to the effect that in his opinion

31

the orientation of education at the University of Puerto Rico
should change, from what it has bean, in 'the future and is now
from Liberal Arts towards Science and Engineering, because
Puerto Rico needs people trained in sciences and engineering,,
There is a. lack of this type of training in Puerto Rico? and
the whole university orientation should shift toward this type
of training»
QUESTION i

What purpose would be served — I gather

this statote has not yet been before your Supreme Court,, has
it?
MR» DE ARELXjAMOs

That’s correct.

QUESTIONs Would it serve any purpose, in light of
the issue that’s involved, the constitutional issue?

To send

it to that court?
MR. DE ARELLANOs

I don't think so, Your Honor.

There’s

nothing that needs to be interpreted.
QUESTIONS

I gather that what —» the interpretation,

I gather, is satisfied — it would have to be that aliens are
not subject to it.
MR. DE ARELLANO:

That’s right, there's no question

but that this statute, Section 689, applies to aliens,

It

says if you're an alien, you can't get a license.
QUESTION: And there's no way it can be construed not
to apply to aliens?
MR. DE ARELLANO: Either you're an alien or you're not,

32
and either it does or it doesn51 apply to aliens.
it doss.

And it says

There's nothing left there for the Supreme Court of

Puerto Rico —
QUESTIONt This is not like the Fornsris statutes
then a
MRo DE ARELLANO;

Where you had a vague statute»

Nobody knows what just causes — nobody knew "then* and nobody
still know what "just cause" means.
QUESTION s So I understand.
HR» DE ARELLANOs

The compelling, so-called compelline

State interest put forth by the Commonwealth, it boils down to
denial of employment of aliens for the sol© reason that they
are aliens»

This is abundantly evident in the Committee Report

to the amendment to the engineering statute.

The Committee

Report said that other countries have requirements similar to
ta requirement being considered in this amendment.

That is#

they require that people coming to work in these otter countries
be citizens of the country# and that the purpose of tie amend­
ment was to conform the law of Puerto Rico to the law cf these
%

other countries.
That is the only reason put forth in the reports#
Committee Reports, on the amendment for the amendment itself.
The matter of civil code responsibility# raised by
•the Commonwealth in their brief is also a false issue.

If we

look at the statute# we find that aliens who receive their

33
education in Puerto Rico are entitled to unconditional licenses.
Yet the Commonwealth forgets that these aliens are just as
free to leave Puerto Rico as aliens who have studied elsewhere.
to
The same is true as/United States citizens who have
received their education in States of the Union, They also are
entitled to unconditional

licenses.

Th© statute contemplates reciprocity agreements
between Puerto Rico and the Statas of the Union,

These. United

States citizens from other States are just as free to leave
Puerto Rico,, in case of trouble, as are aliens who have studied
elsewhere.
X cite th© case of Empresas Capote vs. Superior Court
in my brief.

In this case there is involved the question of

th© meaning of the terra ''contractor5* in th© civil coda chapters
concerning civil responsibility for construction defects.
The Supreme Court stated — the Supreme Court, of
Puerto Rico stated that the term "contractor59 is not limited
to professional engineers or architects.

It m©ans anybody who

has promised to produce a certain result, or to render a certain
service.

And the fact is that in Puerto Rico there are very

many people who practice th© profession, if I may call it that,
cf contractor.

That is, they put up buildings? they put up

whole buildings, and they ar© not engineers.
If we're going to require some contractors so be
citizens and others not, I understand there is a violation of

34
due process of the law*

excuse me

of ©qua! protection»

In summary* if I may* in barring the abstention,
question* this Court* I think* has three courses open to it
in this case»

It can affirm the judgment in the district court*

state that Section 19S3 applies* and thus the Fourteenth Amend­
ment.

Secondly* it can state that only the Fifths, Amendment

applies to the — to Puerto Rico*

However* this* I think* would

hav® the effect of equating Puerto Rico .with an old-time
Territory* subject to direct, control by Congress under Article
IV* and limited* then* by the due process clause of the. Fifth
Amendment.
I don’t think that ©van the Commonwealth would agree
to go this far*
Or it can determine that neither the Fifth, nor the
Fourteenth Amendment applies.

This, I think* would result; in*

I think* an intolerable constitutional vacuum in Puerto'Rico*
because it would be the same

as saying that. Puerto Rico is an

independent country* which it is not.
It would be the same as saying that the 0.5. citizens
residing in Puerto Rico are in the same position as U. S.
citizens residing in, say* Franca.
Finally, the Commonwealth requests that if the Court
finds that Section 1983 does not apply*

well* now* there’s

my argument.
QUESTIONs There’s no real discussion of these

35

questions in the district court’s opinion., is there?
MR, DE ARELLANOs

No, there isn't.

All tliis was

raised before this Court,
QUESTIONS

I suppose the reason is 'that -this had

all been thrashed out in the district court and in the First
Circuit, and that th© law had bean established in your favor,
is that it?
MR, DE ARELLANOs

There are several cases in th©

district court that have already decided this same point,
against the Commonwealth.
QUESTION s

Yes.

May I ask you on© mors question, not that you’re
responsible for this, but ra&yb© you can clarify it.

MRS. DE RODON;

I wanted just to clarify a few points»

We do not agree with the fact that the statute is
absolutely clear.
opportunity

The Commonwealth courts have not had the

of interpreting what is meant by "have studied

the total courses1*, whether this means to have gone through the
three years of the university in Puerto Rico, whether these era
topping-off courses necessary to practice engineering in
Puerto Rico. This has never bean interpreted»
My colleague interprets it to mean the whole three
years in Puerto Rico.
I don't know how this — how tie

unique circumstances of Puerto Rico itself.
i would also like to clarify that we are not alleging
or contending that the Federal Constitution does not apply to
