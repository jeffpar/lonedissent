MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

Mr. Clarke, you may proceed whenever yea are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES H. CLARKE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CLARKE;

Mi:. Chief Justice,

rnay it pleas© the

Court;
This case is before you on a petition for certiorari
to the Ninth Circuit, which reached a judgment in favor of
the petitioners which had been entered on a motion for summary
judgment by the District Court.

The action is one for treble

damages and injunctive relief for price discrimination brought
by an association of retail druggists against drug manufac­
turers.

One of 'the classes of allegedly unlawful discrimina­

tory sales ars to non-profit hospitals.
The petitioners, pleaded as a defense the Nonprofit
Institutions Act which -exempts from the RobinsonHPatman Actall purchases of supplies for their own use by non-profit
hospitals and certain other non-profit, institutions.
the respondent0s theory,

It was

which has never changed and has

been' stated in this Court, that the exemption is limited as a
matter of law to purchases of drugs chat are physically
consumed on hospital premises and therefore cannot be
competitively supplied by retailers.

The District Court disagreed.

It held that all

drug uses engaged in by the non-profit hospitals as shown
by the record, were the own use of the hospital, and it
granted summary judgment.

On appeal the Court of Appeals

affirmed as to the non-profit status of the 13 general
service hospitals whose affairs are before you today but
limited the exemption to in-patient and emergency room use.
It agreed that all of the rejected drug uses by the non­
profit. hospitals serve the public and are proper hospital
functions but have held that in those cases the hospital is
not the consumer and these drugs were purchased for its
purchaser's use instead of its own.
Q

When a hospital sells to a customer who walks

in off the street, are they performing a hospital function
or a drugstore function?
MR. CLARKE:

This would depend upon the circumstance

of a particular sale, Your Honor.

There is no contention by

the petitioner, on the one hand, that, a hospital can set up
a retail drugstore and stock it. with 13c merchandise.

On

the other hand, when a customer comes in who, as a matter of
need, emergency, or for some other .reason finds it incon­
venient or a retail drugstore is unavailable, we say that the
hospital is performing a hospital function even though in
those cases there is no associated hospital service of a
distinct kind.

5

Q

What about just refilling prescriptions at the

hospital by a. former patient of the hospital who has been
given a prescription while in the hospital and he constant3.v
gets it refilled?
MR. CLARKE:

A refilling of take-home prescriptions

is one of the three so-called minor categories of business
that are involved in this lawsuit.

In that case, it still

could be a matter of convenience or a matter of extending
hospital services.

The hospital has the pharmacy prescrip­

tion and as a matter of convenience they will on occasion
come back.

Most of the hospitals, according to this record,

will not refill take-home prescriptions.

There are three or

four that will do it.
Q

Mr. Clarke, this case parses down, despite all

the weight and breadth and length of the briefs, to the
meaning of the phrase, "for their own use," does it not?
MR. CLARKE:
Q

I believe so, sir.

And it can be read broadly to include, I suppose

certainly the situation that the Chief Justice referred to,
the hospital pharmacy selling to somebody who comes in off
the street in an emergency or otherwise because that is for
the use of the hospital in that the profit is for the use of
the hospital.

And it can be read broadly certainly to the

extent that you can read the phrase right out of the statute.
can you not?

6
MR. CLARKE:

You can.

There is an additional

analysis which we think supports our position in this area.
We think that when a sick person gets a hospital drug and
uses it, consumes it, which is all that happens to drugs,
he is obviously using the drug.
for.

That is what the drug is

It has been prescribed for him to mak© him well.

He

is using it.
It is our position that when the hospital dispenses
the drug to him as part of its institutional function, it is
also using the drug, because that is all hospitals use
drugs for.
Q
money.

They sell them to make money, and they do make

And, therefore, the sale of drugs is for their own

ns©.
MR. CLARKE:

They dispense drugs, they charge for

them, they make net profits,
Q

The profit is for their own use.

MR. CLARKE:
G

That is right.

And therefore there is no limit on this,

This phrase read that way would not impose any limitation at
all, would it?
MR. CLARKE:
the petitioners.

That has never been the position of

Our position has been that the dispensing

has to be associated or should be associated in some way
with hospital functions.

With hospital patients?

Q

MR. CLARKE:
Q

No.

Because a hospital can define its function.

It

can say» "We are going into the retail pharmacy business as
one of our functions."
MR. CL-ARKE:

I would not disagree with that, and

if this were an appropriate thing for hospitals to do at any
given point in time» I would say that this would be a very
possible conclusion.
As the Court is aware, the record shows that each
hospital has a pharmacy.
a hospital.

It. is an integrated department of

It achieves net revenues,, and those net revenues

are devoted to institutional purposes, namely, the financing
of non-revenue producing departments.
The principal drug use is for dispensing to in­
patients .

The record shows that some 90 percent or more of

all of these hospital drug purchases are used that way.

And

the dispute is over the remaining ten percent.
The bulk of this ten percent is used in three
established distributional practices.

The first is the take-

home drugs that were referred to before.

These are drugs that

are prescribed by the doctor in amounts that are determined
by the doctor.

They are regarded as a continuation of the

hospital's medication.
Probably the most hotly debated area before this

3

Court is in that of out-patient care»

Out-patients fall into

two classes, according to this record.

There are the

traditional out-patient clinics of which there are half a
dozen in

Portland associated with the hospitals as a

hospital function, which cater primarily to the poor.
Q

Are they all physically located within the

hospitals?
MR. CLARKE;

These are.

I believe that Emanuel

Hospital has sort of a campus type arrangement so it would
not necessarily be in the same building.
Q

But they are not wholly miles apart from the

hospital?
MR. CLARKE:
to are not.

The clinics that I am now referring

One of the issues in this case in the lower

courts had to do with

the Kaiser medical car®, best -Kaiser

Hospital, which is © hospital for an HMD.
Q

But that was reversed on another ground by

the Ninth Circuit.
MR. CLARKE;

That is correct, sir.

But they have

separated buildings.
The importance of out-patient care is not, however,
limited to the clinics that conventionally served the poor.
As I think is apparent from the American Hospital Association
brief, which I wi13 not repeat, this is a rapidly
area of hospital service.

expanding

It is one which promotes the

9

public interest by reducing hospital costs and reducing the
incidence of in-patient care by emphasizing the incidence of
out-patient care.
Then the third primary category that was excluded
is staff sales, the pharmacy privilege which is accorded by the
hospitals to those who work for thorn and those who practice
medicine in association with them.
institution as

This is regarded by the

benefit to the institution, something that

promotes its operations; it is an important employee fringe
benefit; it is negotiated for in some of the collective
bargaining agreements that the institutions have; and it is
a subject of the flyers and publicity that they give their
employees when they come to work.
Q

If

hey are bound under a collective bargaining

agreement or as a matter of their own self-imposed policy to
sell drugs to their own employees and their employees' families
at cost or a low price, they can continue to do so however
this case is decided, can they not?
MR. CLARKE:

The question is not, Your Honor,

whether the hospitals should be selling these drugs in these
ways.

The question is whether they are performing appropriate

hospital functions when they do.

In the case of the pharmacy

privilege, the record shows, we believe, that this is an
integral part of the association of people and resources and
materials which constitutes this hospital.

It aids its

10

operations.

And it is our theory that the exemption

extends to all drug uses that aid or promote the operations
of the hospital and that this is the scope of the statutory
exemption.
Q

And you make the same argument with respect

to a surgeon who happens to practice in the hospital with
respect to his office patients?
MR. CLARKS:

I think so far as his patients who

are hospitalized there is no problem as there is in any other
case.
Q

My question was not directed to them.

MR. CLARKE:

But if the question is whether the

surgeon should be allowed to supply his office patients
with drugs purchased from the hospital pharmacy, if I am
correctly construing—
Q

X thought that was one of the categories at

issue here.
MR. CLARKE:
categories.

This is again one of the minor

The record shows that soma, not all but some of

the hospitals will sell drugs to a doctor for his office use,
usually injectables or specialty items which are not
available in the general retail market.
Q

Let me take that one step further.

If

Dr. Smith who is on the staff, so to speak, of a particular
hospital gives an office prescription to a patient, is that

11
patient free to go to the hospital and have it filled at the
hospital pharmacy?
MR. CLARKE:

Not if the hospital does not sell to

walk-in patients.
Q

And if it does?

MR. CLARKE:

If it does, why then he would be like

any other walk-in patient.
With respect to walk-in patients * the record is
very clear that there are only two of these hospitals that
make any walk-in sales on a non-digcourage basis.

There are

two hospitals which are located in areas of particular need.
One is .next to a retirement home# and the other is in an area
of elderly and poor people# arid the administrators of those
hospitals said that they will fill walk-in business for those
two cases.

Other than that, the record we think is quite

clear, that the hospitals do not want walk-in business.

They

do not regard themselves as being in that business, and the
incidence of walk-in sales is negligible, far less than one
percent of total sales.
We think that the Court should consider in this
case# in light of the statutory language, which is unlimited-it does not seek to define or limit the phrase "use"—that
hospitals are institutions for the treatment of the sick and
the injured.

This is why they exist.

And we say that it is

the institutional use of their drugs when they are dispensed

12

for the use of the sick and the injured.

It is a functional

term.
The importance of drug therapy is also developed in
the briefs.

One of the keys to the expansion of out-patient

services which reduces the exorbitant cost of in-patient
services has been drug therapy which is received by hospital
out-patients.

All of these out-patients are registered

hospital patients, and they are all receiving hospital
services.
Q

Mr. Clarke, so far the only function you

to exclude for their own use is the actual operation

seem

of a

retail pharmacy.
MR. CLARKE:
Q

That is all?

MR. CLARKE:
Q

I agree.

That is all.

Everything else is hospital use?

MR. CLARKE: My powers of imagination or inventiveness
are perhaps limited, and there might be other categories that
could be suggested.
Q

Besides retail pharmacy?

MR. CLARKE:

Besides a general retail store, but

that is the obvious limitation.

I do think that the Court

can approach it from the other and and say that everything
is hospital use which assists or aids or is associated with
its institutional operations.

That is a broad definition.

13
It is where we begin.
Q

I do not see how that excludes a retail

operation.
MR. CLARKE:

The difference, as I see it, is that

in the case of a straight commercial retail operation of the
kind that Mr. Justice Stewart referred to, there is no
association of hospital activities as such with the sale, and
that is a possible ground of distinction.

But I think I want

to emphasize that there are categories of drug use in this
case which are not associated with the actual performance
of other hospital services.

I am thinking particularly of

supplying iniectables to doctors' offices and supplying
walk-ins that come in in the middle of the night and need
drugs.
Q

You would exclude those?

MR. CLARKE:

I do not exclude those.

I say that

under those circumstances the sale of the drug is itself a
hospital use because it relates directly to the hospital's
function as a. community medical resource.
Q

Suppose there is a hospital on one side of the

street and it has established a retail drugstore on the other
side of the street but it sells drugs to walk-in customers
in both places.

You would say the retail drugstore is out of

bounds?
MR. CLARKE2

X am not anxious to build fences around

14

this exemption.
Q

I understand that, but you have excluded

from the exemption reted 1 drugstores.
MR. CLARKE:

I have excluded that from the

exemption because 1 think there is a distinction, which 1
have triad to explain.
Q

Just a walk-in customer who has never been in

the hospital before and is not about to be again comes in
to buy some drugs.

He does not want to cross the street,

to the retail drugstore, and you sell it to him out of the
drug dispensary in the hospital, and he has never been a
patient in the hospital.

So far as you know, he is not a

patient of anybody on the staff in the hospital, and you just
sell it to him.

What connection does that have to have to

some institutional service of the hospital?
MR. CLARKE:

That isolated kind of sale would have

no connection.
Q

That is one of the categories mentioned in

the court's opinion below.
MR. CLARKE:

That is correct, and the record shows

that the policies of the hospitals are to discourage walk-in
business.

The record shows that the volume of this walk-in

business is neg1igib1e.
Q

You brought the case up here, and I want to

know whether you think we should agree with the court below

on item eight, in their opinion, namely, walk-in customers,
MR. CLARKE:

No, sir.

First, the record shows that

the walk-in business which does occur is associated with the
hospital function that is usually in casas of special need.
Therefore, there is an association with the hospital's
community responsibility and therefore there is a sufficient
nexus with the hospital operation to justify it.
Q

If the Eighth Circuit opinion were narrowed to

provide that emergency situations were excepted from their
ban, would that satisfy your purpose?
MR. CLARKE:
Q

I think—

They already allowed that, did they not?

MR, CLARKE:

No, sir.

I am afraid I do not follow

your question.
Q

I did not know they excluded from the

exemption the dispensing of drugs in emergency situations.
MR. CLARKE:
is a special service.

No, it is in the emergency room, which

rooras usually have their own little supply of drugs which
they dispense to somebody who is brought in after an automobile
accident„
Q

They included that.

MR. CLARKE:
Q
emergency.

That is correct, sir.

But you are talking about some other kind of

MR. CLARKE:

I am talking about--well, let us take

the example of Emanuel Hospital, which is located in the
black district of Portland.

Drugstores close early in the

It is a rough neighborhood, and somebody has to get a

prescription filled.

So, they coma to the hospital pharmacy

and yes, Emanuel will sell that walk-in customer and they
do not know whether she is a patient of the staff or not,
that is correct.
Q

You said that the hospitals try to discourage

the one percent apparently—you used that figure—the one
percent of those who corae in off the street to buy.

The

Court of Appeals, of course, has rather firmly discouraged
that kind of business.

But if that were not so, if we were

to reverse the Court of Appeals on that item, would that
not put a premium on every hospital in effect to open a
pharmacy right within their own establishment?
ME.. CLARKE:
Q

Our position does not go that far.

I am asking you about a tendency.

cannot control all the hospitals.

No one can.

You
There are no

limitations or a hospital's right to sell to v/alk-in
customers, the same kind of customers who come into a drug­
store, a traditional drugstore.

Would that not encourage

hospitals to expand their pharmacy operations and actually
seek walk-in business?
MR. CLARKE:

It is profitable business.
Obviously it would do so if the court

17
put no fence at all around them.

It is our position that the

walk-in customer can properly be served in these cases of
emergency or need.
It is also our position that there has to be a
certain flexibility in this statute.

The pharmacist, when the

person comes in, has to be able to exercise some kind of
judgment.
Q

What if the defense were that the hospital

pharmacy could not sell to walk-in patients before 9:00 in
the morning or after 9:00 o'clock at night?
reversed—that they could not sell

I guess I have it

to walk-in customers from

9:00 a.m. to 9:00 pan.
MR. CLARKE:

Whether that would cover the range of

circumstances in which those sales would occur?
speculate.

I cannot

It would be an artificial kind of limitation.
Q

When is it artificial, when that is approxi­

mately the. business hours of the ordinary pharmacy, the
neighborhood pharmacy?
MR. CLARKE:

This is the point.

This statute

represents a congressional decision that within the area of
this statute this will happen.

This statute does not say one

word about limiting the use of supplies to non-competitive
ways, which is the net effect of the Court of Appeals.

It is

the effect of APHA’s brief.
Q

What about the language Justice Stewart read

18
to you, for their own use, unless you give this expansive
reading to the term "their use"?
MR. CLARKE*

It is our position that there must

be a nexus between the dispensing of a drug and the operation
of a hospital.

And if there is that nexus, it does not

matter v?hat the circumstances or what kind of dispensing is
involved.

This is the fence you build around it.

It must

be related in some ways to the hospital's operations.

It

must assist the hospital’s functions in treating the sick and
the injured.

But ‘within that admittedly broad category

there are going to be many kinds of drug dispensing, and
the statute contemplates-—because it is an exemption
statute-—that from time to time there will be an impingement
on somebody
Q

else's business.
That would mean that, they could cilways sell

aspirin and bufferin to anyone who had a pain.

Would you

say that that is the function of the hospital embraced in
the language "for their own use"?
MR. CLARKE:

I would say that if

they were at

the hospital for diagnosis and they were under the care of
a hospital, yes.
Q

I am talking about walk-in patients.

the subject, the frame.

That is

Are you saying that under this

language it is a hospital function to sell aspirin or similar
materials to any person who has a pain who walks in off the

19
street?
MR. CLARKE:

I do not think that at. this stage of

hospital development that it necessarily is, no.
Q

I do think —

Then you should have no objejction to a court

construing that language as not including the casual walk-in
customer.
MR. CLARKE:

I think that it has to include—not

exclude'—the exemption has to include the casual walk-in
customer who is there, for whom the hospital is providing a
resource that the customer needs.
Q

Then by your definition the hospital presumably

determines its own function.

And if it decides that that

function should be performed out in a series of retail
outlets separated from the hospital, you would still say
that by selling bufferin and aspirin in those outlets it is
performing a function which the customer needs.
MR. CLARKE:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we do not say

that the hospitals have an unlimited discretion to define
their own functions.

These functions are changing.

They are

changing.
Q

But 1 have yet to hear from you any place

where you would limit it.
MR. CLARKE:
Q

The hospital's discretion?

Yes.

MR. CLARKE:

I think that there is an area within

20
which you can say that certain kinds of activities are
appropriate and certain kinds are not.

At this point I

would not say that opening a retail drugstore is a proper
function of a non-profit hospital.

But 20 years from now

it might be.
Q

And under this same statute then those

activities would be exempt.
MR. CLARKE:

If these were appropriate and proper

hospital functions, yes, sir, they would be,
Q

And "appropriate" and "proper" is defined by

hospital practice generally.
MR. CLARKE:

That is correct, sir.

*

Q

Mr. Clarke, you have devoted a good deal of

your argument to a problem that involves, as I understand
what you say, less than one percent.
MR. CLARKE:
Q

About one-third of one percent.

One-third of one percent.

May we come back

to what seems to me to be more substantial.
at the moment out-patient operations.

I have in mind

You said there were

two categories of those, the traditional out-patient
department that serves for the most part indigents and,
secondly, a newer type of out-patient department that, serves
the public generally, primarily to relieve the burden of in­
patient service for which facilities are inadequate.

Are

both of these functions performed from the same out-patient

21
facilities, or do you have different types of facilities for
the two?
MR. CLARKE;

The general pattern, Mr. Justice

Powell, is that the out-patient services are performed at the
central institution.

However, around the country the system

of satellite clinics is developing, and in Portland this has
developed with the Kaiser organization which of course is not
before us.
Q

Do you have satellites in two of the 12

hospitals?
MR. CLARKE;

That could be.

There either are or

they are being projected.
Q

But basically the same facilities serve both

types of patients?
MR. CLARKE;

That is my understanding.

Q

And you said, as I understood it,

Right.

that out-patients are registered.
MR. CLARKE;
Q

That is correct.

What does that mean?

MR. CLARKE:

That means that they are registered on

the books of a hospital as hospital patients just as an in­
patient is registered when he comes in.
Q

And when a prescription is issued to a

registered out-patient, does the prescription show on its
face that the patient is a registered patient so that the

22

pharmacy can distinguish between the registered out-patient
and the walk-in non-patient?
Q

I believe not.

The way this is done at

Emanuel, which is the outstanding example in Portland
because it is so much larger and more compresensive than the
other, is that at least at the traditional out-patient
clinics they give the patient a card, and he shows that
card to the pharmacy whan he comes in.
Q

Which identifies him as a registered out­

patient?
MR. CLARKE:

That is correct.

And the employee will have a card that identifies
him.
Q

Right.

And there is no reason why the out­

patients who are registered cannot be .identified.
MR. CLARKE:

In that particular case.

I do not

know how tills is handled in the other institutions.
Q

It is physical possible to devise means to

identify registered patients.
MR. CLARKE:

That is correct.

Q

Another question I wanted to ask

Right.

relates to renewals of prescriptions for in-patients.

You

said that this ordinarily occurred at the time of a
discharge, the prescription being provided for the patient
to take home with him or her.

Does the record show the

23
percentage of renewals that occur or have occurred according
to this record subsequent to discharge at the hospital—in
other

words, repetitive renewals?
MR. CLARKE:

It does not show a percentage.

There

are only three or four of the hospitals which will refill
take-home prescriptions.

And I believe in one or two of them

they did estimate the volume of it, and the volume was quite
low, as I recall, 25 or 30 a week or 20 a week or something
of that kind in one of the larger ones.

But there is no

hard information about the actual volume of refill business.
As a matter of fact, if a patient lives any distance from the
hospital, it will be more convenient to go to a retail
drugstore anyway.

This would tend to happen only in these

cases where the hospital pharmacy is convenient.
I will reserve the rest of ray time.
Q
question.

Before you sit down, may I ask you this
On the front of your brief and on the inside

cover of your brief are listed several petitioners in this
case.

I think those lists are not identical.

May

I ask.,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Tilbury, you may

proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROGER TILBURY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TIIE RESPONDENT
MR. TILBURY:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it p3.ease

the Court:
First I would like to answer Judge Powell’s
question that he just presented as to the ratio of refills.
There is in the record that in so far as Kaiser is concerned,
the ratio is approximately 40 percent.

The other hospitals

do not assign a new number to a refill, and for this reason
it is difficult to know, and their records are incomplete.
They sometimes will assign a letter after a number, but we
think it is substantially larger than the defendants so far
have conceded.
Q

Kaiser has a different kind of operation

though than the other hospitals, did it not?

And its

summary judgment was reversed on a much broader ground by the
Ninth Circuit.
MR. TILBURY:

In a way, Your Honor, that is true.

However, the other hospitals are patterning themselves to a
degree after Kaiser, and we can see that if this Court,

should

sustain the position that Mr, Clarke wishes, that they are

25
soon going to embark upon the same type of program.

It is

true, as you point out, that the Ninth Circuit did send that
back for a reexamination in so fe,r as Kaiser.
of developing these clinics

But the matter

which are considerably removed,,

incidentally—-in the case of Kaiser some of them are up to
10 and 12 miles away from the hospital—will be the way in
which they are definitely trending to go.
Q

But the lawsuit has got to be decided on the

basis of the facts as they exist, I presume.
MR. TILBURY:

I would certainly agree, yes.

As a

matter of fact, Your Honor, since you mention that point,
I would like to say that much of what Mr. Clarke has said
seems to us to be irrelevant for the very reason that the
issues he assigned in his two briefs, his petition and all
the way through

his primary brief, do not deal with the

category of walk-ins, they do not deal with refills, and they
do not deal with the category of office use by doctors.

The

only three things that he has assigned, as you recall, deal
specifically with the employee and staff position sales and
with the take-home sales to a patient on his way out and to
the matter of out-patients.
Q

These are the only things that-—

The out-patients include the out-patient

clines.
MR. TILBURY:
Q

Well, that is an interesting question.

Does it not?

26
MR. TILBURY:

I am not so sure.

for certain exactly what he has said.

1 cannot tell

He has mentioned the

factor of out-patients, but I am not entirely sure as to
what position he is taking.
Q

In the out-patient clinic or the clinic where

the hospital operates a clinic for the public, I take it
the doctors are hospital agents or employees.
MR. TILBURY:
Q

Sometimes.

Anyway, the bill the patient gets is from the

hospital.
MR. TILBURY:
Q

Yes, sir.

So, if one of those patients, out-patients in

an out-patient clinic, is suddenly hospitalised and he is
there a week and then he is discharged but he is still an
out-patient, he will just get periodic bills from the
hospital.
MR. TILBURY:

He would be billed by the hospital.

Some of the doctors, however—I think a3.most all
the doctors at the Kaiser clinic in Portland practice only
at the clinic, and it is only in a rare situation that they
would refer anyone to the primary hospital.

They operate

truly in the case of Kaiser, and this is tending to be true
in other cases as well, as drugstores in the true sense of
the word.

As a matter of fact, they are within a few blocks

of many of thesm.

They have doctors that are there who are

27
technically and in a real sense of the word employees of the
Kaiser Foundation, although they have their own separate
corporation called Permanente Services, I might add, and in
the sense that their connection with the hospital is a
rather tenuous one, except they are all technically under the
Kaiser blanket.,
Q

Do you quarrel with the hospital filling a

prescription or refilling it or selling a non-prescription item
after normal business hours to meet an emergency?
MR. TILBURY:
Q

Not at all. Your Honor.

It is not our business or even the

Court of

Appeals to undertake to prescribe forms and mechanisms.

But

from your close association as both of you gentlemen have had
with this case, would it be difficult, in your view, to set up
a procedure and a mechanism to take care of some kind of
certification as to particular after-hour sales for an emergency
which would define what the emergency was?
MR. TILBURY:

Not Sit all, Your Honor.

We have never

objected to any sales by the hospitals of any kind.
matter of fact,

As a

we v?ould not object—-I ' do not think we can

since we also believe in free enterprise—if they wanted to
conduct a retail store.
Q

That would be on different terms, though.

MR. TILBURY:
Q

Yes, sir.

I am talking about within the framework we have

28
here.

You, I take it then, would not object to walk-in

service, walk-in customers, for emergencies after normal
business hours.
MR. TILBURY:

Not at all, Your Honor.

We certainly

do not want to deprive anyone who needs medication getting
the medication.
Q

When you say you would not object, do you

concede that those drugs would have been purchased by the
hospitals for their own use?
MR. TILBURY:

No, sir.

There is a distinction, and

I hope I am making it.
Q

I was asking tine question in the frarnawork of

our entire dialogue here.

In fact, I

prefaced the question,

Do you think that is a proper hospital function?
repeat it:

I will

Is it a proper hospital function in this

framework—the only reason that we are all here—if sales are
made to walk-in customers after regular business hours and
for some declared emergency situations?
MR. TILBURY:

I am sorry if I am not. making it

clear, Your Honor, and I will try to make it clear.

We do

not object to any type of sale that the hospital wishes to
make.

But we do say that Congress, when it passed 13c,

limited exemption to their supplies for their ovm use.
Q

Let me narrow the question.

Is it for their

own use to sell after regular business hours to meet an

29

emergency for a patient?
MR. TILBURY:

Is it "for their own use"?
No, sir, unless that patient happens

to be a hospitalized patient and unless he uses it in the
emergency room on the premises, in other words.
always been the case.
Q

And this has

As a matter of fact--

But if you will help me, Mr. Tilbury, if you

will not mind stating exactly what do you say is for their
own. use within these eight categories that Judge Merrill
specified?
MR. TILBURY:

We think the Court of Appeals decision

is correct, that it should be limited to a use on the
hospital premises by a patient or somebody-—
Q

One, they would dispense to the hospital's

in-patiants dining the course of treatment.

That is for

their own use, is it?
MR. TILBURY:
Q

Yes, sir, we concede.

The second one is they would dispense in the

course of treatment to patients of emergency clinics operated
by the hospital; is that for their own use?
MR. TILBURY:
Q

Yes, sir, we think it is.

They were provided to departing in-patients

as take-home prescriptions; is that for their own use?
MR. TILBURY:

No, sir.

Honor.
Q

Only the first two?

Just the first two, Your

30

MR. TILBURY:
Q

Yes, sir.

The other six are all within Robinson-Patinan?

MR. TILBURY:

That is correct, for the reason,

Your Honor--Q

I just wanted to know what your position was.

MR. TILBURY:

For the reason that it is not used

on the premises, is not used under hospital supervision.

The

individual has no connection with the hospital once he leaves
the hospital.

And the reports indicate, despite what

Mr. Clarke has said, that this was not intended to encompass
the world,

that Congress did intend to restrict it to a

situation where it was intended to be used on the premises
and for that particular function.
Q

But does not that overlook the modern trend—

and when I say modern, it is beginning 30 or 40 years ago—
to {a) keep people out of hospitals if they can and (b) toget them out of hospitals as quickly as possible after
surgery or other treatments?
MR. TILBURY:

We will all agree that that is a

desire, yes.
Q

There just are not enough hospitals, ©re there?

MR. TILBURY:

Certainly that is true.

I do not

think -there are enough drugstores either, Your Honor, at the
present time.

Q

hs a result, after the delivery of the baby,

31
they are having mother mid child go borne sometimes in 24 hours
after surgery that formerly was two or three weeks, they now
send them home in two or three days or even less.

Are you

going to have a trend that is going to lengthen the hospital
stry here?
MR. TILBURY:

In a way.

As I again repeat, Your

Honor, we do not object to anything they can do to alleviate
the plight of the patient, whatever that may be.

And if they

wish to sell in any way, at emergency times, whatever, but

we think that Congress meant what it said when exemption was
not an unlimited one.

If they had meant strictly that it

applies to all non-profit institutions, they could have said
It that way, but they did not.

They specifically said

purchases of their supplies for their own use.
As you well know, the words are construed with
regard to their normal usage.
us© superfluous words.

Congress has not presumed to

Those words have a meaning, and the

word use has always me amt consumption by tin® individual
using it.

It does not mean a resale.
As a matter of fact, rather strangely,

Mr. Clarke

seems to foe at cross purposes with his own client, Lilly,
because Mr. DuBose, for example, told Congress during the
extensive hearing.-which agreed with our interpretation by
Congress in 1367 and 1368—extending over a thousand pages
that that was what it meant.

It meant a use within the

institution itself»

And Mr. DtsBose, who used to be in charge,

manager of the Portland office for Lilly, told Congress
that "In general, I think we can say that the furnishing of
drugs to out-patients or

to patients off the street

probably results in a competitive inequity to the retailer»"
And for years Lilly has required all the hospitals that buy
from it, before they can acquire their goods at a preferential
price, to sign an agreement that the particular institution
will "use the products only for its own use within the
institution and not for resale."
Q

How about a clinic in a hospital, as far as

Lilly is concerned, where the hospital itself in the hospital
is operating the clinic?

MR. TILBURY:
Q

I would again say, since—

I am just asking about Lilly.

What is their

view about that?
MR. TILBURY:

I would interpret Lilly’s agreement to

mean that it has to be used at the hospital.
Q

It is used at the hospital in their clinic.

MR. TILBURY:

All right, then I would say it is a

proper hospital use.
Q

As far as Lilly is concerned?

MR. TILBURY:

I can hardly speak for them, but X

would think sc.

Q

But you disagree with that?

33

MR. TILBURY:

No, sir.

No, I do not disagree with

it..
Q

That comes under two?

MR. TILBURY:
Q

Yes.

Why does that come under two?

It is not an

emergency clinic.
MR. TILBURY:

Whether they call it; a clinic,

whatever they call it, if it is used at the hospital under
hospital doctors on the premises for consumption there, than
this is the sort of thing that. Congress intended.
Q

Do you agree that, that is within the exemption?

MR. TILBURY:

Yes, sir, if it is used at the

hospitalc

0

.

That seems to me much broader than on© and two .

Maybe I just do not understand.
MR. TILBURY:
Q

My own position—

Let me follow through a little bit on this

because you have just said for consumption flier®.
MR. TILBURY:
Q

Yes, sir.

Suppose a prescription is given to an in­

patient for a hundred tablets, whatever it is, and when he
is discharged tomorrow, he has 90 of them left and takes them
home.

Still all right under the Robinson-Patman Act?
Mil. TILBURY:

No, sir, I do not think so because

the point of consumption is no longer at the hospital.

It is

for use at home.
Q

So, the hospital then on your theory would

have to parse that between the ten that were consumed while
an in-patient and the 90 that he took home?
MR. TILBURY:

Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun, and,

incidentally, that is not a difficult thing because once it
leaves the hospital, the hospital rules and the Oregon
statute and the statute in every state that I am aware of
require that it be given a prescription number; they
actually will repackage it in those situations, or they are
supposed to under the state law--and they do, I think-—and
assign a number at the point it leaves the hospital because
it is no longer under the hospital control or supervision,
hnd when they came to Congress and asked for this, they
talked in terms of the need and extending the care to the
needy patient.

This was the thing that was stressed.

The

hospital is not providing care when the individual is no
longer at the hospital.

By definition he cannot be extended

the care of the hospital if he is not at the hospital.

And

this is our position, and I think this is what Congress—
Q

To

go back to the clinic case, an

out-patient of a. hospital clinic that is operated on the
hospital premises comes in regularly for shots.

You say

apparently that is within the exemption.
MR. TILBURY:

I think it is.

I think it is,

35

0

That is certainly broader than number two,

just in emergency.
MR. TILBURY:
Q

Your Honor, my difficulty is this--

It Is though, is it not?

MR. TILBURY:

I do not visualize it as such.

Perhaps Your Honor may disagree with me, but the fact is
that what is an in-patient and an out-patient is a matter of
definition, and there is considerable disagreement among
hospital administrators as to what that term means.

But I

think when Congress spoke in terms of care and supervision
and "for their own use," they were speaking in terms of the
hospital because they not only said the word "their" once,
they used the word twice, and. of course they used the

tern

"supplies for their own use," and "use" has always—as far
as I know, since Wycliffe in 1388—said that that means
consumption; it does not mean that you resell it to somebody
else for their use.

We are talking about two entirely

distinct things at that point.

And at the point that the

hospital has no more control over it, in the case that
Justice Blackmun mentioned where the drugs are taken home
for consumption, at the point it leaves the hospital there
is no more supervision at that point.
Let me put this in a. practical but. hypothetical

G
question.

Thirty years ago or more, an appendectomy or

herniotomy meant two weeks at least in the hospital.

It is the fact.

Today it is two days or

But with the patient may and usually does go

some sedation and pain killer and that sort, of thing.

Do you

say that that is not part of the hospital care, for the
hospital to furnish that material when the patient leaves the
hospital to go home and do at home just what formerly was done
for the patient in the hospital?
MR. TILBURY:

At the point it leaves the hospital,

the hospital is no longer using it.
using it.

The former patient is

And I think there is a distinction there.
Q

Are they not using it. if they give it to him

be fore he leaves?
MR. TILBURY:

Yes, if they give it to him before

he leaves for consumption at the hospital, yes.,
Q

No, no, before he leaves for consumption at.

home, for consumption whenever he needs it, under instructions.
MR. TILBURY:

It is not the use by the hospital,

and I think we have to use the language that Congress itself
usad, and the congressional committee said that at the point
it leaves the hospital that it is no longer the hospital that
is using it.

It is a private individual because there is no

control over that at the point it leaves the hospital.
Q

But you. are reading "use by the hospital“ as if

it meant use in the hospital.

I mean, there is no use by the

hospital in the sense that the hospital as an institution does

37

not itself

take any drugs.
MR. TILBURY:

It is patients that take drugs.

Of course that is true in the sense

that the hospital, a corporation, does not imbibe and use the
drugs, no.

But at the point that the hospital ceases to have

any control over what happens to those drugs—and we have had
many cases where we found that they not only had given them
medication for a couple days but they had given them medication
for six months and longer.

Incidentally, we have also in the

record where they have actually forced sales on people who
did not want the drugs at the time they left the hospital but
found it on their bills.

And when they protested, they were

not able to have it removed in certain cases.
And, incidentally, the quantum of these is not the
one pea*cent or the one-third of one percent.

We have

evidence in the records showing that in the case of Kaiser
it is well over 400,000 prescriptions—
Q

But Kaiser is not hare in any capacity.

MR. TILBURY:

All right, in the case of St. Vincent's

another one, 231,000 over the space of about five and a half
years.

In the case of Good Samaritan it is roughly 54 a day.

These are not minimal things.

He is trying apparently to

argue de minimis again, although at various times he disavows
that, de minimis is a defense here.
Q

Doras the record show what the economic

impact of hospital sales is on the drugstores, or do the

38
hospital pharmacies undersell the drugstores?
MR. TILBURY:

Yes, they do, quitcs often.

And

anotiier problem is that they charge a differential price to
their in-patient as against people that come in off the street.
They do not pass along the savings in cost, we have found
many times, to the in-patient.

He is charged sometimes

considerably more even than an individual that went to the
corner drugstore to buy it.

But then having that leverage,

plus not being taxed, which they are not, then they are able
to slas the market considerably at the other end by selling
to drop-in type people, people having no connection with
the hospital.

Was this the intent of Congress, to literally

destroy the corner drugstore?

Because make no mistake about

it, I do not exaggerate; that is

precisely what has occurred

in Portland and will occur nationwide and is occurring.
sort of thing is a real source of danger.

This

I do not think

there was the intent by Congress to upset the original
patterns of distribution which had evolved over so many years.

good function.

But at the same

Q
function.

You do not want them to perform your client’s
That is the essence of it, is it not?

MR. TILBURY:

No, Your Honor, I do not say that. I

39

say they can.
Q

Is that not what the case is about?

MR. TILBURY:

I say this, that if they decide to act

like corner drugstores, they should pay the same price.

Only

that.
Q

That, is what my question, if it was a question,

had in mind.
MR. TILBURY:

Well, 13c gives them an exemption, as

you know, for certain purposes.

At the point it is no longer

for their use, then we say the Robinson-Patman Act applies
and they should treat with equality the drugstores and the
hospitals,

if a hospital conducts its operation in

precisely the. same way as the corner drugstore, and they
are.

They are indistinguishable in many cases, and it is not

limted strictly to Kaiser.

Anyone can come. in.

And

incidentally the amount of these we have found—we have
several affidavits in the files saying and showing that it is
vary easy to purchase at some of these hospitals even though
their administrators later have disavowed this.

But we have

investigators that have been able to buy them with simply
impunity and not have it questioned at all.

And this sort of

thing is going to happen and will occur with greater
frequency unless in some way the Court says that that law
means what it says.
Q

Mr. Tilbury, you drew the line at whether or

40

not the drugs were consumed on the premises of the hospital.
Suppose there were no Section 13c

at all.

Would there be any

competition with respect to drugs consumed on the premises
of the hospital?
MR. TILBURY:

1 do not feel that that is a

competitive impact if it is consumed on the hospital premises
by an in-patient.
Q

Fine.

So that with respect to the drugs that you

think—
MR. TILBURY:

Excuse me, may I qualify that.

I do

not say that there would be a competitive effect in so far
as our clients are concerned.

There would be an impact in

so far as say a profit hospital that might be two blocks away.
So, in this regard the law was changed.
Q

This case involves only your clients,

MR. TILBURY:

Yes, sir, that, is true.

But I did

want to point out that that change did take place because of
13c because now, even though competition is affected, they may
discriminate in price in favor of a non-profit hospital even
though it may have rather devastating effects to a profit
hospifcal.
Q

In terms of the interest you represent, your

clients, what purpose does Section 13c serve in light of your
view of the act?
MR. TILBURY:

It clarified the law. It permitted them

41
to make sales within the hospital because Congress felt in.
1938 that that was illegal.

Both the Senate and House

committees and also the letter which is quoted in both of
those reports from the man who then headed the Hospital
Bureau of Supplies and who was more or less the instigator
of this particular bit of legislation felt that—
Q

If there is no adverse effect on competition

resulting from drugs consumed within the hospital, you never
get to 13c, do you?
ifR. TILBURY:
that, is true.

In light of the present case law,

In light of the case law as it was in 1938

Congress felt that that was an illegal operation.

I am

willing to concede—Q

That is talking about the secondary line, but

there would still be a question of competition to a primary
line—
MR, TILBURY:
Q

—between manufacturers.

MR, TILBURYs
Q

Thera could be a primary line, yes.

That is true,

And 13c would serve in that respect in any

event.
MR. TILBURY:
correct that that effect

Yes, Your Honor, that is certainly
also took place, yes.

But Congress certainly felt it was serving a
function in passing 13c.

And Congress felt it was illegal at

42
that point.

And the Senate committee said so and so did the--

as a matter of fact, it said, it had now made it illegal.
this change was brought about by 13c.

So,

And it clarified the

situation of the in-hospital use as wall.

So, I concede it,

and in light of the ca.se law now, 1 would concede that
probably oven then it was unnecessary if the case law had
developed to the point that it now has.

But that was somethine

that Congress was not in a position to forecast accurately,
Again, I return to the words of the statute which 1
think basically is what we are talking about.

The word

"supplies" also means something other than resale.

A supply

wagon in the days of the Old West meant supplies that went to
a particular fort or a particular city or something of that
kind.

It did not mean things that were going to be sold in a

vendor’s cart front door to door.

These are not supplies.

And

"use" means—and certainly under all of the use taxes of

sold—-and of course this is the Astor case which this Court
decided in 3.882—whan you talk about a resale, that is no
longer a use.

It is simply supplying something to be usee by

twice, their supplies—and I notice this seems to be dropped
occasionally from the petitioners' brief—their supplies for
their own use, that word "their," used twice, certainly meant
the hospital.

It did not mean the private consumption of

43

somebody off the premises having no connection with the
hospital and particularly when they went to Congress and said
we need it to

take care of the needy sick within the

institution.
Q

To be more precise, it has to mean for the use

of the hospital's own patients.
MR. TILBURY:

Well, I suppose.

That is an interest­

ing thought.
Q

If you are talking about the use of the

hospital, the hospital does not use the drug.
MR. TILBURY:

They could do it for experimental
I could conceive of that, but that is

about the only exception.
Q

That is not what you are arguing about.

MR. TILBURY:
Q

No.

But you do not insist on that limitation,

I mean, if read literally, as my Brother Rebnquist says, then
the only supplies actually used by a hospital would be things
like furniture and so on, but in the area of drugs it would
just be for their own corporate use—
MR. TILBURY:
Q

I do not interpret it that way.

--own corporate consumption.

MR. TILBURY:

No, I would not so limit it.

I think

in the case of use by the patients in the hospital, that
certainly is a permissible thing.

No question about it.

44
I might say also that at the very least--of course I do not
need to argue extensively the point that this was decided on
a summary judgment.

It was decided at the earliest stage I
