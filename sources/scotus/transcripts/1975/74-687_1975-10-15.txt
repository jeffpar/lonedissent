We will hear argument

Mrs. Shapiro, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. HARRIET S. SHAPIRO
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MRS. SHAPIRO:
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

This case is here on. th® Government's petition

for certiorari to review the judgment of ‘the Court of Appeals
for th® Fifth Circuit.

If involves the interpretation of

31 U.S.C. 191, which provides that when a parson indebted to
the United States becomes insolvent, the debts dua to the
United States shall be paid first.

The-! issue her® is whether

that priority of the United States applies only when the
precis© amount of the debt is established before insolvency
or whether all. debts due to the United states at insolvency,
whether liquidated or not, are to be paid first.
Th® facts here war® stipulated.

Emsco, which is a

Texas corporation, breached three contracts with the Defense
Department.

After it had breached th® contracts it assigned

all its property to respondent to be sold for th.® benefit
of its creditors.

And. that act, of course, established its

insolvency.
Shortly thereafter th© Government re let the contract.'!
that Emsco had breached, and th® amount of Emsco's debt to the

Government was determined.

It was determined by settlement of

two of the contracts and by charging Emsco for the excess costs!
of reprocurement on the other.
The priority statute requires that when a person
indebted to the Government becomes insolvent, the debts due
fcha United States shall be paid first.

And a voluntary

assignment for the benefit of creditors is one of the ways
in which insolvency can b© shown under the statute.

It is

also an act of bankruptcy, so that when there is an assignment
for the benefit of creditors, the creditors have a choice.
They can either consent to the assignment and take their share
of the debtor’s ©state under the conditions in the assignment,
or if they prefer the protection of the bankruptcy laws, they
can petition to have the debtor declared a bankrupt, in which
case the assignment is void.
If there had been a petition in bankruptcy here,
it’s clear that the Government's claim on these contracts would
have been debts provable- in bankruptcy, because the Bankruptcy
Act expressly defines debts to include unliquidated or even
contingent claims.

These are provable debts, and so long as

they are liquidated or can be estimated soon enough so that
they can foes paid without unduly delaying the administration
of the estate, they are allowable.
In addition, the Bankruptcy Act gives a priority
to debts owing to any person, including the United States,

5
entitled to a priority under Federal law so that the
Bankruptcy Act incorporates the priority statute by reference.
A number of cases, both in this Court and in the
courts of appeals , have assumed that this priority appli*-...

.

claims like the ones her® which war® unliquidated when
insolvency occurred, so that if there had been a bankruptcy,
we submit that these claims would not only have been provable
but v/ould have been entitled to a priority.
But there wasn’t any petition in bankrupt*.../

.

The Government simply asserted its claims to priority under
the priority statute.

Mien the claim was denied, the Government

brought suit and fch@ district court, following the established
principles, found that the Gov@rnm.ent was indeed entitled
to its priority.
But the court of appeals reversed.
this

It interpreted

175-year-old statute without considering any of the

previous cases which had construed it, the policy it was
designed to serve, or even the longstanding practice under it.
The court held that the phrase Kdebts due'8 means only •the*'»
debts which would have been entitled to be recovered under
common law action of debts.

Since the claims here were not

for fixed and certain amounts presently payable at insolvency,
they were not debts due at common law, and therefor® the court
held they were not entitled to priority.
We submit that that decision is simply wrong, both

6
von th© basis of precedent

and because of its undesirable

’practical effects.
\

Th© precedents ar® entirely clear in holding 'that

the priority statute applies not only to debts which ar© du®
in th® sens® of being presently payable

V/.

at the moment

that insolvency occurs, but that it also applies to debts
where the obligation has accrued
has not yet arrived.

but the time for payment

In fact, the respondent doesn't, really

dispute this.
But w® submit that that fact alone should demonstrate
the common law action for debt which requires that the debt
be presently payabl© is not an appropriate standard for
defining debts due.

Indeed, if fch® standard were strictly

applied, there could be some question about whether taxes
would fo© within the priority at all since there is some
precedent indicating that taxes aren't common law debts.
And, of course, th.® status of taxes which have accrued but
which are not payable at 'th® precis© point ©f the insolvency
would be still more uncertain.
There isn't any such uncertainty now.

The priority

statute clearly applies to all accrued taxes, including
unliquidated ones, and to those which have accrued but ar©
not yet due when th© insolvency occurs.
Th© priority statute also has long been assumed to
apply to contract debts of the sort involved here where the

7
obligation has been established by the time that the insolvency
occurs

but the precis© amount of the obligation is not

settled until letter.
The effect on Government revenues of altering this
longstanding interpretation of the priority statute is hard
to estimate, 'Indeed, for the tax applications,, we really
haven8t been able to get any estimate because the effect of
the decision is so unclear.

What it does is creat® questions,

but there is really no way of telling what the precis©
impact of it would be.
On the contract applications, the Defense Department
has estimated that in a typical year perhaps some $20 million
in Government claims in defense contracts alone might b©
affected.
There is a further reason why the decision below
should be reversed.

In addition

to

its break with precedent

and its effect on Government revenues, it provides a practically
unworkable standard for the parson who must distribute the
insolvent’s estate.

He must decide whether a given

Government claim is entitled to priority, and if he guesses
wrong, ha may be personally liable to the Government for the
amount paid t© the other creditors.
It's 'therefore vary important to have clear standards
for determining when the priority applies,and tlx© limitations
of the common law action for debt are certainly not the

8
kind of clear standards that are appropriate.
Respondent seems to agree that the decision below
can91 really mean exactly what it says.

H© suggests that

nevertheless this Court should limit the debts to which the
priority statute applies to ones which have been liquidated
before the insolvency occurs.

But that limitation, too, is

unsupported by precedent and it's also unrelated to the
purpose of the priority statute.
The courts have consistently interpreted the statute
as .applying to all types of debts.

They have recognised that

its broad purpose is to protect the Federal revenues.

And

when a particular debt is liquidated is not significant in
terms of that policy.

The Government's interest in assuring

that the debt owed to it will be paid is not related to the
time that the precis© amount of the debt is determined.
But there is an appropriate source of guidance for
determining the meaning of the debts in the priority statute.
That source is the Bankruptcy Act which uses the precis© term,
and as used in the Bankruptcy Act, the terra "debts” explicitly
includes unliquidated and contingent claims.
QUESTIONs

Of course, the Bankruptcy Act came along

a hundred years later than the statute on which this case is
based»
MBS. SHAPIRO:
Bankruptcy Act did.

That's right.

The current

There was an earlier Bankruptcy Act about.

s
1800 which also recognized certain contingent claims as debts.
And the priority statute refers in effect to the Bankruptcy
Act sine® on© of the acts which makes it applicable is any
act of bankruptcy,,.

And moreover, the Bankruptcy Act refers

to the Priority Act in defining debts which are entitled
t

to priority.

i

So 'there is a distinct cross-reference.

Both

Acts deal with insolvency and protect Federal interests by
providing Federal priorities.
policies.

So both reflect similar

And moreover, they are overlapping in the sense

that a ease involving one statute will very often also involve
the other.
So differences in interpretation of identical
languages under these circumstances almost certainly will lead
to confusion and such differences should be avoided unless
they ar® clearly required by th© statute5s language or by
its purpose,, and no such difference is required here®.
Unliquidated claims ar© debts under the Bankruptcy Act, and
for that reason they also should be considered debts under th©
Priority Act.
‘lb,is interpretation of the Act has an entirely
practical advantage, not only to th® Government but also to
those who contract with it.

From th® Government's point of

view, the priority should attach whan the contract is breached,
If. it doss not, th© debtor can manipulate the time at which he
becomes insolvent in order to avoid the Government's priority.

10
And h© may very often want to do that in order to prefer
creditors with whom he may want to deal later.
wouldn't be difficult.

Manipulation

He would simply have to mak© an

assignment for the benefit of creditors or file an involuntary
petition in bankruptcy promptly after h© breached his contract
before the Government has a chance to liquidate its damages.
But to try to protect itself from having its
priority defeated in that way, the Government in its turn
would have to liquidate its claims as rapidly as possible,
even perhaps by terminating contracts where it had doubts
about the contractor’s solvency.

And that certainly is not

& policy teat would benefit 'contractors.

It might very well

lead to increased litigation over contract termination and
it could increase business instability by tending to push
borderline companies into insolvency.
QUESTIONS

Well, if you are right debts due does

include unliquidated claims, certainly it's in the interest
of disposing • of the insolvent estate for th® Government to
liquidate its claims as rapidly as possible.
MRS. SHAPIRO5
QUESTIONs

Certainly.

Otherwise, th® insolvent estates are

going to b© tied up indefinitely, if you are correct in your
basic premise.
MRS. SHAPIROs

Certainly, the Government does have

a vary strong interest in liquidating tee claims as promptly

11
as possible.
QUESTION:
th® other way.

You just told us your interest is strong

But however that may be, th® interest of

settling th® insolvent estate is very strong in favor of
getting these claims liquidated and handled.
MRS. SHAPIROs

That's perfectly true.

All I am

saying is that it9s important not to have the Government's
priority turn on th© speed with which ife can liquidate the
©state.

There certainly is no chance that the Government is

going to delay liquidation if its priority doesn81 turn on
that.

All I am saying is that you shouldn't have a rule that

says, OK, th© minute you think that there may b@ insolvency,
you have to rush in and liquidate immediately on pain of
losing your priority.
Th® Government certainly doesn't have any interest
in delaying liquidation.
didn't d© so her®,
QUESTIONs

It certainly

tod in fact —
About six years after th® assignment?

MSS. SHAPIROs
QUESTION?

It6s not going to do so.

No.

In fact —

Liquidated?

MRS. SHAPIROs

In fact, I think that respondent

would agree that the point of liquidation is when th® contract
was re let.

.tod hare the last on© — well, the first

contract was relet within th© period within which the non­
priority creditors could submit their claims, before December L,

12
*66*

The second one was liquidated within the time within

which the assignment could still have been voided by a
petition in bankruptcy.

And the final on® was liquidated

within — assuming there had been a petition in bankruptcy,
then you have six months to file claims.

And the final

claim was liquidated within that six months.

So the

Government hasn51 delayed, and it doesn't normally.
As I say, all 1 am saying really is you shouldn't
put a penalty on the Government of losing its priority if
it fails to liquidate before there is an assignment for the
benefit of creditors.
QUESTIONS

Wasn't on® of theses claims contingant

as well as unliquidated, contingent in the sense that there
was a controversy as to whether or not there was a claim,
a, valid claim?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

The respondent, or Etasco, did maintain

that I believe all three of the con-tracts were terminated for
the benefit of th® Government rather than breached by Emsco.
QUESTIONs

Your position makes no distinction between

claims that are contingent and those that area merely
unliquidated, does it?
MSS. SHAPIRO:

Well, what w© claim is that this

claim was unliquidated — these claims were unliquidated, but
were not contingent.

Certainly 'th® fact that there was

litigation concerning th® type of breach doss not, we believe,

13
make th© claim contingant when the conclusion of the
Contract Appeals Board was that in fact there had fctan a
breach as of the time the breach occurred, that the finding
of the Board relates back to th® moment of the breach.
Certainly, so long as th® obligation of the debtor
is fixed, so long as the cans® of action has accrued by the
time there is an assignment or other act of insolvency
QUESTION:

Does that mean -that so long as the

Government makes a claim?

Because if the claim is contested

at th® time of th® assignment, the obligation would not
necessarily b® fixed, then, would it?
MRS . SHAPIROs

I think it makes a differens® about

what happens to the ~r th® result of■the contest if in fact
there is a determination that the Government's claim was
valid,
QUESTIONs

Suppose it war® a tort claim contested?

MRS. SHAPIRO2

I don't believe that makes any

difference, as long as th® result is that th® Government’s
claim is upheld.
QUESTIONS

But it may not be upheld for six or seven

years as a result of litigation.

What happens during that

period of time?
MRS. SHAPIROs

Well, the other provision that's in

th© Bankruptcy Act which we believe certainly might well be
applicable to th® priority statute is -that if th® claim can't

14
be either liquidated or estimated within a time which would
permit the reasonably prompt administration of the estate,
then it's not a provable claim.
QUESTION:

But that provision is not applicable to

this; it's applicabis to bankruptcy,
problem with your case.

tod that5© the- very

If we had such a provision her©*

you would have a manageable -situation.

But that provision

isn’t — you’re not really seriously submitting that that
provision is applicable to this statutef ar® you?
MRS. SHAPIRO;

There is no real reason why ft

couldn’t be —
QUESTION;

It would ba nice if it were.

That’s

your point.
MRS. SHAPIRO;

Well, the other possibility, of course,

is that the assign®© can set aside an amount necessary to
meat the Government’s claims.
QUESTION;

In this case that would have required the

setting aside of assets that would have deprived other creditors
of any recovery at all, would it not?
MRS. SHAPIRO;
QUESTIONS

Yes, that’s tru®, it would have.

The administration problem is really that

pussling.
MRS. SHAPIRO;

Well, the court in United States v.

Barney faced up to that and decided that the priority statute
in fact applied, provided that the Government did have a

IS
priority arid in those circumstances 'the policy of giving the
Government a priority, the Congress had decided that it
appliedj, that it should prevail.
QUESTION;

Certainly there is no question of the

Government having been given a priority by statute»

It was

given a priority with respect to debts due the United States
and 'th@ question in this case is whether the meaning of not
only debts, but debts due.

There is no question about its

priority? feh® question only
MSS. SHAPIRO;

is what it covers,

W©11# yes, that certainly is correct.

Yes.
QUESTIONs

That's the issue in this case.

MRS. SHAPIRO:

Well, my conclusion really is that

a decision permitting privat® creditors to get a larger share
of the assets of the insolvent's ©state is a change for
Congress to make.
QUESTION:

On that could I ask you, I notice that

on. page “-in the footnote on page 17 of your brief, you say
that if there is no priority, the other creditors will receive
substantial portions of their debts and the United States will
receive nothing.
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And I see that on page 3 of your

opponent's brief it is said that if there is no priority,
the United States will receive 40 percent.

16
MRS. SHAPIROs

I don't know how they got the 40

percent.
QUESTION*

Do you S’.till maintain that the United

States will get nothing?
MRS. SHAPIRO?

Under 'the terms of the assignment;

that provided for payment to the nonpriority creditors who
submitted claims by the 1st of December 1966.

The Government

did not submit a claim as a nonpriority creditor by December lt.
'66.

So under the terms of the assignment; the Government

would get nothing.
QUESTION?

But you could have filed as a nonpriority

creditor.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

We could have, but we thought w® had.

a priority on the basis of the practice up to that point.
QUESTION:

Could the Government h&xm improved its

position in that regard by filing a petition for bankruptcy
upon the occurrence of the assignment?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

The Government can't by itself file

petition for bankruptcy when there are more than 12 creditors.
QUESTION3

It can join as one of the three, or

whatever —
MRS. SHAPIRO:

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Vary well.

Mr. Harris.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS GSA HARRIS
OH BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. HARRIS?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

the Court s
The question in this css© is whether unliquidated
contractual claims of the United States constituta a debt due
within the meaning of the priority statute.
with Ms. Shapiro.

I would differ

Several timeas she said all debts, and, of

course, that3s the question we ar© talking about right now
whether this type of claim is a d®bt within the meaning of
the statute.
It appears to m® that th@r@ are four factors that
ar© important to the resolution of this case.

And two of

those factors would indicate a narrow decision, a narrow
interpretation of the statute.

Two of them would indicate

18
& stor® expansive interpretation of the statute *
The first two involve the meaning of the ter.ua "debt
due" at ccaoa law afc the time approximately when this statuta
was first written.

The statute was first written in the

1730's and it has been carried forward substantially unchanged
since that time.
The second factor# again which I think would
indicate and lead to a narrow interpretation of the statutes
is the concept of fairness to all creditors in this situation#
including the Government and including the other creditors who
dealt with Emsco.
Th© factors favorable to the Government's position
are a line of cases indicating that this particular statute
should he construed liberally for the purpose of protecting the
Government's purs®# also a line of cases in which the matter
of priority has just been assumed with no real discussion..
Ms. Shapiro has adequately related the facts giving
rise to this controversy.

The only thing 1 might add was

that this company# Emsco Screen Pip® Company# was in a
failing financial situation when it entered into these
contracts with th© Government and managed to sort of prolong
its ©ssistenc©

only for another eoupl® three months and

ultimately went into the assignment for benefit of creditors.
QUESTIONs
have any?

What bearing does that have?

Does it

13
MR. HARRISs

Yes, sir* it doss* because —* it has a

bearing on it;, in my view* because the second factor that 1
think is important is the matter of fairness to all creditors.
In this case the Government was dealing with Emsco
on a business basis just like its other creditors and it seems
to mt that we’ve got a different situation from a taxing
authority dealing with the tax recipients and taxpayers.
QUESTION!

Wouldn’t your thesis put a burden on the

Government to sick® a careful inquiry into the potential
solvency of every on® of its contractors?
MR. HARRIS*

Yes, sir, that inquiry is required,

I believe, in making
QUESTIONs

Well, they do on their own, but then

that «ane if it’s going to affect their priority,

the

Government is going to probably disfavor a great many
contractors who need the business, are they not?
MR, HARRIS*

That is one ©£ the disputes that arose

in this particular eases, your Honor, not this trial, but at
the trial of the Navy’s claim, because the company argued
that, there was a misunderstanding between the Government mid
the company at that time and that the company was not really
financially able to perform this contract ©nd -the Government
was required to make a determination that it was, and there
was some confusion in that and the company thought it was, but
a wrong standard was applied, and it should never have been

20
awarded this contract in the first place.
Thesa . arguments are kind of detailed® little bit in
the brief t but the main point X wanted to cover was whether
the idea of this unliquidated claim was a debt due within the
statute and in accordance with tea common law definitions.
There was a question as to tee time of the liquidation
of the Government's claimP and th® claims war® liquidated soon
after th© time of the assignment for the benefit of creditors»
This lawsuit was generated to determine the applicability of
the , priority statute to unliquidated claims.
Th© first and I think the most important factor in
th© resolution of this case and interpretation of th© term
13debt" was what th® term meant to the framers of the legislation.
And to get soma indication of that, we have gon® back to look
at th® particular meanings of the term "debt” and "debt due"in
th© common law.

And our argument is that th© common law did

not comprehend a debt, as an unliquidated claim, teat if you
have a debt where the matter was, say, on a promissory not®,
it might not be presently payable but it was readily ascertain**
able and it was a. si® certain*
Some fore© was given to this argument by ® cas® from
this Court, in 1348, Massachusetts- v. the United States .»

In that

case Massachusetts was arguing with th® United States over
again the proceeds of an assignment for th© benefit of creditors.
There were two taxes teat were owed.

There were Federal

21
unemployment taxes owed# and there war® Stats unemployment
tares owed.

And the assign©® took the position that he was

entitled to pay the State unemployment claims to the extent of
90 percent of the Federal Government's claims because there was
a provision in the Federal Government's statute that, you could
get'90 percent credit for any amounts payable to a State fund
that had been provided.
And the Federal Government took the position that
they couldn’t do that# that at the time of the insolvency all
rights were fixed and you had to pay the full amount of the
unemployment tax claim*
This background is important because it bor© on the
resolution of the problem by the Court in that cas®.

It said#

tlx© Court said# that you had to look to the moment of insolvency
as to what th® situation was at that time in order to determine
whether priority applied,

you couldn't look to ©vents that

happened after insolvency in order to determine whether there
was a debt.
QUESTION

There was a little difference in the

Massachusetts case teat they were disputing liability# weren't
they?
MR. HARMS s
QUESTION*

1 heg your pardon# sir?
In the Massachuaetts case they were

disputing liability.
ME. HARRIS %

That's correct

22

QUESTIONs

And thar© is no dispute here*

MR* HARRISs

Well, there is no dispute as to the

liability, only to whether it was a debt at that time.
QUESTION2

But not as to amount.

MR. HARRISt

Not now*

At the time of the insolvency,

of course, there was no way of knowing what the amount was
owing to the Government, and at that particular time it
could have worked out any number of ways.
QUESTIONS

Only on® judge on the Fifth Circuit

followed that theory.
MR. HARRISs

Yes, sir.

Actually two judges on the

Fifth Circuit, said that what you have to do is look to see at
the time of insolvency
payable or not.

as to whether ifc was a debt presently

X think that was to some extent a wrong

answer in making tbs debt be presently payable, because that
was not a necessary requirement of the common law tana "debt"
becaus© the common law tern included debts that were presently
payable and debts meaning a sum certain that would ba payable
at a designated time in the future.

And the only tiling you

had to do was wait for the time to pass.

There was no

happening of the subsequent ©vent that would liquidate the
damages.
In the Massachusetts case the language that we
rely on is the followings

It says, KXt is at least doubtful

in the statute’s wording that obligations wholly contingent

23
for ultimat® maturity and obligation upon the happening of
csvents after insolvency can be said to fall within the reach
of ’debt© due* at the time of insolvency,•

ted further it

says that Congress drew fch© line for the operation of the
statute close to, not at, the commonly accepted meaning of
debt as distinguished from other forms of obligation,
QUESTIQMs

Do you think that statement was necessary

t© the holding in that case, or was it just a side observation
by way ©£ dicta?
ME, HARRISs

Well, when I first got involved in

this I thought it was just dicta, but then a® 1 became more
closely acquainted with the case, I think that was an
integral part ©f the whole, or at least an integral part of
an alternative reasoning.
QUESTION3

D©@s not the -- taking it as part of the

holding, doss not it r®f@r to maturity and obligation in
the conjunctive?

Is there ary doubt about the obligation in

this ©as®?
MR. HARRIS:

Well, I think the focus of the inquiry

that was indicated in Massachusetts was that you look at the
time ~~ the events at the time of insolvency,

ted if you have

to look to subsequent events, contingent events, as he calls
them in that language, then it would not b© a debt due in
common law.
QUESTION:

But the contingency that the Court was

24
referring to in that language you rely on has both elements,
maturity and obligation, does it not?

MR# HARRISs
QUESTION?

That's correct, yes, sir»
That's not true here, is it?

There is

no doubt about the obligation, isn't that correct.?
MR. HARRISs

The obligation was fired, but the thing

1 want to emphasize is that you have to look at ©vents beyond
the time of insolvency in order to determine whether there
was any obligation, because damages could have been zero.
Than I suppose that may be a metaphysical way of approaching
it, but. if you have to look at ©vents subsequent to the tiras
in question, then it would not be a debt in accordance with
common law thinking#
Another case that we think bears on this case is
the case of United States v# State Bank of North Carolina,,
which was d@ci.dad in 1832#

That cas© involved a customs bond

which was executed tefor® fch® insolvency, payable after the
insolvency#

a debt due, even though it wasn't presently payable#

To get

to that result he went to common law thinking, and he said,
if you want to know what debt means, look to the common law
and w@ are going to apply it in the sense of the common law
term meaning

a debt presently payable ~~ ©kcus©

a present

debt, that is, presently obligated but payable in the future.
The emphasis was that you did not look to subsequent events.

in my brief, and those ofchef cases also stressed

it was written in the statute»

You couldn't look, or you

shouldn't look to events after the time of the insolvency

If you didn't have a liquidated

To distinguish that from a tax ©as®, you have to

which talked about taxes

And I think by that sort of math®-*

I think the second factor that's of importance in
this case is the concept of the fairness to all the creditors,
and I raise the question again, why in this situation should
the Government Is® giv*n particular special treatment because
thay were in a business relationship with Emseo?

Take, the situation that Ease© had never bid on this
contract, then the contract would have .been re let or they
would have been let to other parties at a higher price perhaps,
but it would have Im&i the same price that, the Government
wound up paying anyway rather than coming into this

We pointed out In our brief that if the priority
is extended to the Federal Government, the other creditors
get nothing and that is, of course, the large part that •— w®
think at least you can say it8s harsh on the other creditors,
perhaps not unfair, but harsh.
Ms. Shapiro has indicated that the Govsrnifeant gets,
nothing

if the priority statute is interpreted in such a way

that unliquidated claims are not debts du©.
Now, 1 think she is probably wrong on that because
under the T@x&s law, the assignment for the benefit of
creditors, the assignee is compelled to recognise creditors,
even late filing creditors if they just notify th® assigna®
of their claims and elect to te§ treated as a participating
creditor.
We have always in this situation treated the
Government as a claimant, another creditor, and X never really
even thought that if priority did not extend, that the
Government would not receive its pro rata share of the
indebtedness.

We

brief the case all along in that vein.

Thm question ©f the practical aspect of the
:«-ji;shipuiatioa by th® creditor of th© Government by somehow

30

running into bankruptcy or running into assignment for
creditors soon after contractual default in order to curry
favor with the remaining creditors is a spectre that X suppose
is possible, but I think you need to balance that horrible
example or that horrible imaginable against the situation of
the present harshness on the present creditors»
As J. indicated, there are two factors that I think
are favorable to the Government in this case, and those are
the cases that indicate that this statute is supposed to be
construed liberally to protect the Government's purs©»

And

my only response to that is what limits are involved in that.
If you look to the State Bank case, United States v„ State
Bank of Borth Carolina,

Justice Story said, well, this

language in her© has to be applied reasonably, you have to
give it reasonable interpretation.

In order to give it that

reasonable interpretation, ha said look to the common law
meanings.

H© didn’t extend it to all claims or all

obligations.

H© said look to the common law meanings, and we

are talking about a present debt»
Other factors that militate for a decision for -the
Government would be the cases in which priority has been
assumed even though there has been no real confrontation of
the issue.

There ar© a number of those cases»

To follow

that approach would b@ sort of law by accident, because I
don’t, think there has been any real — there is no clear

31
argument of the question.
In closing, let me say that I believe this is a
narrowly drawn statute.

The statute did not in its terms

apply to torts, didn't apply to obligations, didn't apply to
claims.

It was? drawn in terms of debt.

And as the term was

used, I believe that the common law would indicate it did.
not comprehend

unliquidated claims.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Mrs. Shapiro?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. HARRIET S. SHAPIRO
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRS. SHAPIRO:

My first point is that the Massachusetts

cas® really was deciding that a debt is not due when the
debtor can at the point of insolvency decide whether h© is
going to pay the United States or th© State.

In that kind

of a situation you have a contingent debt that it's much
harder to say is a debt due.
Tax claims can be contingent in the sens® of
uncertain.

For example, you can have an accrual basis taxpayer’

who has got a mine.

The results of profits from th© min®

won't be determined for a. period of time.

Or when there is

a sum in litigation or when there is a sales contract where
the amount payable isn’t determined until the end.
And finally, in the standard contract terms for
damages, the liquidated damage clause is ordinarily not the

32
exclusive remedy»

There is also a provision for contingent

or consequential damages or other damages that result.

The

damages here could have been determined at the moment of breach.
There is no necessity to wait for the recontracting.
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you, Mrs. Shapiro.

Thank you„ Mr, Harris.
The case is submitted.

entitled matter was concluded»]
