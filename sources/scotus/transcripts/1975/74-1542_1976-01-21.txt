PRO C E E D I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 1542, Union Electric Company against
the Environmental Protection Agency.
Mr. Ferrell,, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM II. FERRELL
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. FERRELL:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This case arose in the United States Court of

Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.

It arose by petition brought

under the judicial review section of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1970 to review the sulfur emission regulation
in the Missouri implementation plan.
Section 307(b)(1) says that petitions may be brought
within two different time periods.

In the first place,

petition may be brought within 30 days after the Administrator
of EPA approves the implementation plan.

In that event, it

is probable that there would be an administrative record which
is susceptible of review by the Court of Appeals.
The section secondly says that petitions may be
brought at a later date if they arise solely on grounds that
have occurred more than 30 days after the EPA approved the
State-devised implementation plan.
So far as we have been able to ascertain, this is
the only case in the United States that has been brought more

4
than 30 days after the EPA-approved implementation plan and,
of course, brought on grounds that arose more than 30 dciys
after such approval.
There were a substantial number of cases that were
filed within this initial 30-day period which in 99 percent of
the cases occurred within the month of June 1972, and those
cases have resulted in a fairly substantial number of opinions
ny the several United States Courts of Appeals in the various
circuits because these implementation plan review petitions
must be brought in the appropriate circuit, First to Tenth.
Results differ in those decisions, and I think it's
the differing results that have occurred, vis-a-vis themselves,
and the differing result in many of those cases with the result
reached by the Eighth Circuit in the instant case that is now
before your Honors is the reason this case is here.

That is

r

the basis for the grant of certiorari.
Now let's take a quick look at the allegations of
the petitioner’s petition.

Union Electric alleges that three

of its base load electric generating plants — and bass load
plants are the ones that supply the bulk of the electricity —
three of them, all located in the State of Missouri, in -the
Eighth Circuit, do not meet the sulfur emission regulation in
the State-devised implementation plan that by EPA approval has
become Federal law.

*

We allege that grounds which have arisen more than

5

30 days after the EPA approval make it impossible for Union
Electric on technical grounds to comply with this regulation
and we allege that it would be manifestly against the public
interest for Union Electric to make an attempt to comply.
Now, going on a scientific possibility of compliance
not saying it may work out -- there are as far as w® know
and as far as we allege in the petition only two scientific
bases on which a compliance could hope to be attempted.

One

is by the utilization of what is called sulfur dioxide removal
equipment.

In the industry it’s commonly known as scrubbers,

and perhaps that’s the way I shall refer to it from time to
time.
The other method would be the use of a low sulfur
content coal that is ordinarily found in the Midwest and is
not too frequent these days.
We allege in our petition that in the time following
the period 30 days after the Administrator-approved EPA plan —
I mean the Administrator of EPA approved the implementation
plan, thereby making it Federal law, that it has been demon­
strated that no scrubbers have been developed or invented that
would permit or enable a compliance with this sulfur-emission
regulation.

So we demonstrate that it is technically impossible

to comply with this Federal law.

And w® allege that -those

grounds have arisen more than 30 days following EPA approval.
Now, it is true that a considerable number of years

6
ago utilities, suppliers, began to work on what I will call
scrubbers, develop them, invent them.
deeply engaged in this project.
expectations.
110

Union Electric was

There were high hopes, high

But unhappily in life, and in this case, the

expectations have not been realised.

And, there is an averment

in our complaint, one that we think is susceptible of proof,
and I think should be taken by this Court in its deliberations
as being fact.
Going to low-sulfur coal, I think, even —- and I'm
not saying this in any derogatory manner, but my brethren
of the Department of Justice, the respondent EPA, would agree
that there unhappily is just not enough low-sulfur coal to go
around at this time.

And if we go into the market and corner

it, bid it up, up, up, up, up, up, we are going to run into
electric rates.

Money has to come from somewhere.

comes from the consumers.

And it

So we are going to have electric

rates so high, we corner the market on low-sulfur coal, that
it 'would throttle, virtually destroy, the economy in the St.
Louis area and much of Missouri, Illinois, Iowa where we
serve.

So we contend that it would be manifestly against the

public interest for us to attempt, if we could, to corner the
market.
Now, turning a minute to scrubbers, if i may.

I

ira. sure all of your Honors are familiar with the fact there
has been, and is, a serious inflation in the world today.

7
Unhappily,, the price of these ineffective scrubbers, these
inefficient scrubbers that will not enable us to comply,
have increased so enormously that to install them on our three
electric generating plants would cost us over $500 million*
Assuming that we could go into the market in New
York and get $500 million for nonproductive equipment — we
have terrible carrying charges, as

allege, of over $100

million par year -- it would call for a terrible increase in
our electric rates*

We don't all«sge a percentage, but it would

be so high that we say it would be manifestly against the
public interest, and again we would be imposing upon our
economy an economic condition that, would be manifestly against
the public interest*
I think there is one very important allegation in
our complaint that has to be realized and considered in this
entire case, and that is our allegation that although Union
Electric, the petitioner, is not meeting the State sulfur
emission standards in the Federally approved implementation
plan, it is fulfilling the national ambient air quality
standards, both primary and secondary*
ambient air quality standards are really

MS. FERRELLs

Well, I do in my briar, and I will

now point out that we think from a constitutional point of
view fehejre are three different methods that the constitutional
requirement should be..

When you talk about a different type

of review, in a sense you have to look at the two periods of
time.

I hope IEm not taking too long to answer your question,

but when you have in the Court of Appeals 30 days after the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has

approved the plan, then you do have some kind of a record
before the court.

But when you are alleging in your petition

the Court of Appeals grounds that arose long after the
Federal agency has acted, you do not have an administrative
record for review, with on® possible exception, which I refer
to in my brief.

MR. FERRELLs

They did say that.

And I have been anticipating whether there would bs a

In my

But I am not at all sure.

factors must be considered at any time.

but he did say that this is a political matter, these
technical factors and economic factors are matters of politics,
matters which -he Judiciary cannot touch, matters beyond the
Judiciary.
That to me brings in sort of the constitutional
feeling 1 have that here we have something that a person can
lose his business by,, a Federal law.
QUESTION;

What constitutional problem would Union

Electric run into if its allegations were in fact true, but
it couldn’t raise this until the enforcement proceeding?
MR. FERRELL:

Well — There is the other.

I do say

11
that in an enforcement proceeding it’s possible»

I question

whether that’s a very clear interpretation from the statute
that it should b@ raised in an enforcement proceeding.

No.

Michigan Electric Company case, a former Justice of this Court

Circuit.

Or

in,

I think that’s the Sixth

It held that constitutional difficulty is saved,

and I would agree with -them, if the point may be raised in an
enforcement proceeding.
Now, of course, the statute itself says that you may
not raise anything in an enforcement proceeding, there’s a
preclusion ary provision, if it may be raised in a judicial
review proceeding.
May I mention just one practical matter; maybe it
ism81 u legal matter.

But the utility industry is engaged in

a very large capital-raising campaign, and it may be true that
it will come about.

But you hate to go to Wall Street when

you are right sitting in an enforcement proceeding that may
close down all your plants or require you to pay as much as
a $50,000 & day fin© per plant to keep them open., which would
mean you couldn’t get the working capital to go on.

And you

12
kind of hate to go and try to raise money to build new plants.
And we must build new plants.

In fact, new plants must be

built just to stay on an even lin®.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ferrell, as I listen to you, I am

just thinking about the interest of the State of Missouri.
I suppose the people in Missouri would be unhappy if they had
to close up the utility and not serve the community any more.
Is your reaction

to not proceeding in that area, that arena,

because they have ruled against you on th® merits?

Is there

J

no procedure in Missouri at all in which you can raise any
of these questions?
MR. FERRELL:

Well, tli® variance procedure, this

Court did, I think Mr. Justice Rehnquist was the author of the
opinion, decide one and only one case under th® Clean Air Act,
and that is that a variance approved by th© State under the
Stats law may thereafter b© considered .'a revision of an
implementation plan and approved by the Environmental Protection
Aganey under, to be precis©, I think it's 101 or 110(c) of
the Clean Air Act, if there will not be any jeopardy to th©
maintenance of the national air quality standards.
But at least in Missouri, and I will not go beyond
Missouri, there is on® difficulty about that.

The statute that

governs the EPA’s approval of a variance to revision section
101(c) says there must be a public hearing.

And the Missouri

statute that providas for variances, and I think others, too,

13

as well as Missouri, say that a variance may be granted without
a hearing, and at least 90 percent of them are.

The

Executive Secretary -- I don't like to say percents; I don't
really know»

But many of them are.

The Executive Secretary approves the grant of a
variance to the Air Conservation Commission and it's granted
without a hearing,

So at least in Missouri wcs cannot have

EPA"approved variances unless there is a hearing.
Now, if there is a hearing, the EPA still proceeds
with the enforcement of the Federal law.

We have a sort of a

bifurcation; we have a State law and we have a Federal law.
It doesn't really have any particular concern what the State
is doing.

The Stats can have a proceeding that goes on for

four, five, six years, hearings —
QUESTION;

Mr. Farrell, what is the Government

referring to at page 10 of its brief that you are before some
appropriate State agency now on matters of emission controls?
MR. FERRELL?

Well, we say that that is not correct.

Wa are trying.to get variances, but we would hop® that —

Do you have a proceeding pending before

MR. FERRELL?

Wa have applica -- we always have

yes.

Right now they are all applications.

For any reason?

MR. FERRELL;

MR. FERRELL;

There are two methods of getting a

had to shut down your plant, if you were an individual, you go

And, of course, your Honors know we are not going to
shut down any plants under any circumstances until the Army
tells us to do so or this Court.
I notice that my white light is on.

I may, to retain just a few minutes.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Taft.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER H. TAFT ON BEHALF
OF RESPONDENT
MR. TAFT:
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I think the question has been well presented here.

16
Primarily we arta concerned with whether or not in approval of
a State air implementation plan the EPA must consider the
economic and technological feasibility of the plan before
approving it.

The court below said no.

They said no at any

time as a matter of law whether within 30 days or thereafter.
We agree.
statute it is clear.
clear.

We believe that from the face of the
We believe from -the history of it it is

And also from the structure.
If there is on© thing that is clear in pollution

control law, when you go to Congress, it's technology and
economics.

In the Water Pollution Control Act it is a

technology Act.

Under section 301 they refer for s77 to the

best practicable control technology available, for

’83 they

refer to the best available technology economically achievable.
In the Clean Air Act. it comes up again and again.

It comes

up with respect to technology is relevant to aircraft, it's
relevant to fuels, to motor vehicles, to new source performance
standards.

And section 110 itself twice brings technology

into play, in section 110(e) and section 110(f).
So I think when the standards ax© set forth in
section 110(a)(2) as to what the EPA shall review when it
reviews a plan, it sets eight of them out, and when it chooses
to omit technology and economics, I think it is very clear that
that choice by Congress was clear and intentional.

In fact,

when you go through the history of th© Act it's even more clear.

17
It's set forth well in the Court of Appeals.
well in our briefs.

It's set forth

The Act adopted the Senate language.

The

reports before debates, statements after the fact, all make
very, Very clear that as far as Congress was concerned, the
primary air quality standards were to be met or the plants were
to close, or they were to return and get an extension from
Congress itself.
QUESTION:

I take it you would agree with your

friend tnat there are no circumstances under which a plant
like this can be closed, as might be true of some other types
of ~~
MR. TAFT:

Yes, I would.

I think the one case that

is clear is that I don't think any court would turn the lights
out.

I happened to .be in New York when the blackout came on

for 12 hours.

The health damage by a blackout within 12 hours

will outweigh the advantage to health

of

.the Clean Air Act

over years.
QUESTION:
Taft?

What's the ultimate solution, then, Mr.

Suppose confrontation finally occurs?

The utility says

it can't get the financing for this without drastic rate
structure, suppose they can't satisfy the rate-making authority.
Does that mean a Federal district court or the EPA must take
over the operation of the plant until standards are met?
MR. TAFT:

No, your Honor.

I would suggest that

this can be brought up in enforcement, that in this case of a

13

shutdown of electric plants, we would have to balance again
the health factors involved here.

X think that a decree could

be fashioned by the trial court that would take into consideration what could be done as fast as it could be done.
an adjudicatory hearing at that time.

You have

The decree, for instance,

could require that low-sulfur coal be used in those plants in
a high concentration area.

It could require that a particular

plant might be closed down.

It may reauir® that a research

program be instituted by the utility to find the kind of
equipment that can work.

It can fashion under its powers of

equity, which could be reviewed every six months, for instance,
the kind of decree that could be as effective as possible.
QUESTION:

Mr. Taft, when would an equitable decree

of this kind be handed down by a court?

I understand the

position of the Solicitor General to be in accord with that
of tne Eighth Circuit, that, the courts no longer have any power
to review the plan to considar whether it's economically or
technologically feasible.

When would this decree you describe

come down and where and under what circumstances?
MR. TAFT:

That, your Honor. I think would be in a

trial court when an enforcement proceeding is brought under
section 113.

At that time it could be heard.

QUESTION:

When the parties have reached an impasse?

MR. TAFT:

That would be correct, your Honor.

QUESTION;

The utility would say, Wesve got to put

19

the lights out.

The Administrator would then bring a suit to

say, Turn the lights on.
HR. TAFT.

All you need is $500 million.

I would suggest to the Court if you look

under section 113 that when he enters an order, first, an
order of compliance, it requires a conference.

It also

requires that the Administrator when h© issues his order under
section 113, it requires that in the order itself after
conference that he consider the nature of the violation and
set forth a time for compliance that is reasonable, taking
into account the seriousness and the good faith efforts to
comply.

In other words, before you even get to court, the EPA,

the Administrator, must satisfy these kinds of terms before he
can seek a decree from the court.
But I think that when you come into the court, what
you ask for would necessarily be affected by those kinds of
considerations, and it's not

white or black by the time you

ask the judge what he requires.
QUESTION:

You are suggesting the decree of the

Eighth Circuit, the judgment of the Eighth Circuit be affirmed
and that the parties then proceed to the point where they have
the type hearing you are now describing.
MR. TAFT:

Yes, your Honor.

QUESTION:

Would there be any res adjudicata

Would the company be free to

HR. TAFT.

They would be free to raise any question

or issue that has not been reviewed by a Court of Appeals on
the action of the Administrator of the EPA.

what they came into the Court of Appeals on, only permits review
of the action of the Administrator.
plan as a whole.

It is not a review of the

It is only of what he acts as, what he does.

And we claim that as a matter of law under section 110(a)(2)
he cannot consider economic or technology factors.

And as a

result, as far as that section is concerned, or the exclusionary
or preclusionary review is concerned, he would not be affected
by the review.
QUESTION:

Is that the section that provides in

substance that the plan must b© implemented as promptly as
practicable and in any event within three years?
MR. TAFT:

Yes, your Honor.

110(a)(2), yes.

QUESTION:

Do you think the requirement that the

plan be put into effect as promptly as practicable is
affected by the feasibility of the plan as it affects a given
utility, for example?
MR. TAFT: May it pleas® the Court, the three years
has passed, and as a result we have run into the absolute
barrier of the three years.

At that point the;"practicable"

language has no application whatsoever.
QUESTION:

Thafcss however impractical the plan may be

after the three years?

21

MR. TAFT:

That’s correct, your Honor.

But, your Honor, the question is where that can be
heard, and that can be heard, we believe, in the State.
a State plan.

It's

And as I say the Court of Appeals is not there

to review the plan, they only review the narrow grounds that
the EPA acts on on approving the plan.
the plan must be under State law.

An overall review of

It can be reviewed in the

State and it can be reviewed, as we say, if it's a constitutional
type ground, it can be reviewed on enforcement.
QUESTION:

I am not sure I can reconcile that with

your footnote on the bottom of page 36, Mr. Taft, the last,
full paragraph of the footnote where you say, s,It is the
Administrator’s view, however, that claims of infeasibility
are not relevant to whether there has been a violation of the
implementation plan.

Such claims, in other words, may not. be

used to render invalid the emission limitations ..." and so
forth.
Now, I am not sure I understand that.

Does that

mean that a district court cannot make some adjustment in
light of intervening events, or is that subsequent to the
three-year period?
MR. TAFT.

May it please the Court, that is what

the Administrator claims under the Act, applying the Act.
If there is a constitutional ground, substantive due process
ground, a balancing of health factors where to close a plant

22
would be more adverse to health than the advantages of the
Clean Air A.ct, that is a matter which a court can consider at
that time,
I can't begin to set forth what those factors may­
be.

I will only admit one, which is the closing of the plant.
QUESTION:

That's not a constitutional —-

Congress

could require every electric utility in the country to shut
down tomorrow subject only to the eminent domain clause.1,
couldn't it?
MR. TAFT.

Yes, your Honor.

I would suggest that health codes, health inspectors
have closed down plants for a long time and Congress has the
power, and has exorcised the power here under section 110(a)(2),
it has exercised that power that is necessary to meet the
primary air quality standards, then they must close.
I think

. constitutionally the power is there.

So that

Thera may

be a balancing factor, as I say, on health if you are going to
try and turn the lights out.
If I may, let me just go back again to 110(a)(2).
The way the statute is structured, EPA sets the, primary air
quality standard in sulfur dioxide that has been set.

The

State had nine months to coma up with a plan Vfhich had to
comply.

Section 110(a)(2) states that the Administrator must

approve a plan which does comply with the primary air quality
standards.

It is for that reason, to meet that standard, that

23

Congress was prepared to face the closure problem and did.
The rest of the Act and a good deal of the rest of
section 110 deals with softening the effects of the strictness
of that standard.

I would suggest to the Court that under

section 110(a)(3)(A) that the plan can be revised by the State,
and this court in Train gave that the broadest interpretation
it could in the sense that it can be revised plant by plant,
it can be revised source by source, company by company, as
long, again, as the primary air standards are met.
Under section 110(e) when the plan was submitted to
the EPA, the Governor of the State could request a two-year
extension to five years if technology was not available and
they did not expect it within the three years.

Under section

110(f) after the three years, or when the three years is up,
the Governor may coma in and request a postponement, again
because of technology not being available.
I would suggest to the Court especially to look at
section 110(f).

If the petitioner is correct, section 110(f)

is a nullity, . because if h© says it's infeasible technologically
or economically, the petitioner claims the plan is void.
Section 110(f) gives four grounds for a postponement of one
year of the plan.

The second ground is technology is not

available.
Now, it seems to me under section 110(f) as soon as
he proves the second ground, he isn’t postponing the plan, h®

24

just voided it.

Th© plan is void at that point.

And as a

result you don’t have to go through good faith compliance with
national interests, with health, or welfare requirements as
set forth in the rest of 110(f).

Oust as soon as he proves

technology is unavailable, he voided the plan.
QUESTION:

Excuse me.

I don’t have that part of

the statute in front of me just to follow you.

In what kind

of a proceeding does he raise the 110(f) issue?
MR. TAFT:

The Governor of the State must com® --

QUESTION;

Supposing that the State is against the

utility, as it is here, and the State is satisfied, what can
the utility do to raise the 110(f) issue?
MR. TAFT:
QUESTION:

Can it do anything?

It cannot, no, your Honor.
So that really isn’t relevant to Union

Electric here,- then, is it?
MR. TAFT:

I don’t know if they tried.

They have

indicated ~
QUESTION:

Let site put it just a. little differently.

Let's look just for a moment at 307(b)(1) which is where they
seelc to come in.

They may not raise technological factors, as

I understand your position.

Is there anything 'they can raise

in 307(b)(1) proceeding if you assume that the State has
complied with the minimum requirementsin the eight subparagraphs
of 110?

What grounds would be reviewabl® at the petition of

the utility in the 307(b)(1) proceeding?

25
MR. TAFT:

I'm not sure if many would.

QUESTION:

I don't think there would be any, would

Most of them would be for a different

there?

kind of plaintiff.
QUESTION:

Most of them would be, for instance —
Really, if we are talking about review

at the request of the utility, this provision really is a
nullity.
MR. TAFT:
benefit to them, no.

I don't think it would have tremendous
There may be one, but I can't think of

one.
QUESTION:

I just couldn't think of any when 1 was

trying to think of what it might be.
MR. TAFT:

But there are many that could come in

under that, namely, for instance, if the air quality standards
have not been met after the fact, then you come in —
QUESTION:

An environmental group might come in and

say the standards are not strict enough, that sort of thing.
MR, TAFT:

It's more likely to be the kind you get.

QUESTION:

Mr. Taft, before you go on, do you

consider the decisions in this area in I think the Fourth,
Sixth, and Seventh Circuits are in conflict with the decision
of the Eighth Circuit in this case?
MR. TAFT:

I would say that the Sixth and Seventh,

as far as what's directly before the Court, are in accord,

26
namely, that under section 307(b)
plan,

a review proceeding of the

or the Administrator’s action on the plan, cannot bring

up these factors.

The Sixth and Seventh, I believe, said that

they could be brought up on enforcement, but they agree with
the Eighth Circuit that they could not be brought up now.
QUESTION:

How about the Fourth?

MR. TAFT:

The Fourth and the Third both, I think,

are in direct conflict, yes.
As I say, 110(f) would not need to be there if the
petitioner were correct, because the plan would be void as
soon as he proves the technology is not there.
May it please the Court, may I also just point out.
the timing.

Congress set up nine months for the State to

adopt its plan after hearings.
months for the EPA to approve,

It thenset up only four
not just one plan, but 55 plans.

Effectively, the EPA had two days per plan to approve 55
State implementation plans.

I

think as the Third Circuit makes

c? :.;ar in the Duguesna case, if

Congress had over expected these

factors of technology and economy to be considered, there is
no way within that period of time it could have been done.
Again this goes, as I say, to the structure of the
Act.

The Act is strict up front and then sets up the means

whereby it can be relaxed and softened.

But I also point out

110(a)(3)(B) the Energy Act of 1974, where again Congress
suggested, in fact, required, the EPA* to review State plans and

27

when they were more strict than required, could suggest to
the State that they be softened, so long again as they stay
Within the primary air quality standards.
As I pointed out before, in section 113 on enforccmtent,
they make it very clear that the enforcement process through
tne EPA is to take into consideration gocd faith attempts at
compliance and a reasonable time schedule.
So that I think the structure of the Act, is very
strict up front and then attempts to soften as«you go through
the other parts of the Act.
QUESTION;
question.

Mr. Taft., may I ask another procedural

Apart from the variance procedure in Missouri, is

there a State procedure by which fcha utility may challenge the
basic plan that Missouri submits for approval by the EPA?
MR. TAFT:

I'm informed that they can bring a

declaratory judgment action at any time, I have been informed
by the Attorney General's office in the Stats.
QUESTION:

In the State courts.

MR. TAFT:

Yes, in the State courts.

I might also point out on the hearing point on the
variance, the State now as a matter of course always grants
a hearing when a variance is complied with.

Section 110(a)(2)

only requires the fact that a hearing took place, not that the
law requires it.

So when the agency in fact provides the

hearing, it satisfies the Act.

28

I have here the notice of hearing for the Sioux Plant
variance just to show that in fact Missouri is going through
that p rocedure there.
QUESTION:

But Missouri is under some constraint, I

suppose, in granting a variance in that it may not so amend
its plan that it could no longer meet the approval of the
Administrator.
MR. TAFT:

That’s correct.

I might point out. just an error, I believe, in our
brief in the footnote.

The variances that were applied for in

the Labadie and Meramec plants were in fact denied by the EPA,
they are not pending.

They were denied.

They were denied by

the EPA because it simply was a postponement as opposed to a
modification setting forth times for compliance and increased
compliance.
QUESTION:

What happens, Mr. Taft, if the State

grants a variance which the EPA does not agree with or approve?
MR. TAFT:

Well, whether the EPA agrees or not, if it

meets the primary air quality standards under 110(a)(2), it
must approve.
QUESTION:

Well, who decides that?

MR. TAFT:

The EPA must.

QUESTION:

I am supposing a confrontation.

MR. TAFT:

Well, if the EPA says they don’t meet the

primary air quality standard under the variance, then you have

29

a question that will go to the Court of Appeals on review under

.

307
t

QUESTION:

Are the sanctions then against the State

or against the utility?
MR. TAFT;

Well, the review itself, if the review

upheld the utility, would be that the revision — well, it
would direct, I suppose, a number of things.

Among other

things it could direct the EPA to approve the change, if in
fact the utility was right that the primary air quality
standard was still met under the variance.
I might suggest to the Court that in fact -the
■

Courts of Appeals are not the right place to consider the kinds
of 'things that petitioner wants to have heard.

As I said, if

he claims there is a right to be heard someplace for
constitutional grounds, for

substantivo due process grounds

of some kind, then I don't think the court should have it heard
at the one place where Congress said it shouldn’t, which is
at the point of approval of the plan and review therefrom.
QUESTION;

You don't question, I take it, the right

to ba heard somewhere, do you?
)

MR. TAFT;

I do, your Honor.

QUESTION;

You do?

MR. TAFT:

Well, I believe that they can be heard

under the State implementation plan in the State courts.

QUESTION;

Are you suggesting no right to a due

process hearing before a utility plant is closed down, no right
to have such a hearing anywhere?
HR. TAFT;

Your Honor, 1 think that

there may be

constitutional grounds, there may be due process grounds.
There are not statutory grounds.
QUESTION:

But you ara entitled to a due process

hearing before an automobile can ba repossessed.
MR. TAFT;

That clearly is an enforcement type

hearing where absolutely you are entitled to an adjudicatory
hearing before a court.
QUESTION:

That would be the @n£orcement stage.

So you agree that the utility is entitled

to a due process hearing somewhere.

MR. TAFT:
ba heard on.

Yes.

I don’t know what the grounds could

The grounds might not be all the grounds that he

would like to have heard.
QUESTION:

The ground would be that the plant would

be shut down.
While I have interrupted you, let me say this:
is not really an adversary case in the normal sense.

This

The

Government perhaps has the greater interest than the petitioner
heir© in seeing that the public is served and served at reasonable',
rates and served without polluting the atmosphere.
Now, the briefs indicate that a half a billion dollars
will have to be raised to meet the standards and keep the plant

31
going.

There ought to be, there must be, some way to bring

this issue before a fact-finding tribunal with authority and
power to decide the issue properly and promptly.
Now, these people went to court.
to the wrong court.

You say they went

I would like for you to review again so

it would be clear to me what the next step ought to be.
represent the Government of the United States.
this utility do?

You

What should

They can't go to fcha market and raise a

half a billion dollars.

That's practically absurd in the

present climate of affairs.
MR. TAFT:

What should be done?

May it please the Court, I think — and

this goes into the enforcement on where it should be heard,
assuming there is a thing there to b© heard, assuming that
what you have put forward as going to the market for $500 million
is a legitimate ground under some standard.

Assuming that, I

would suggest really what they did was they had an order,
a violation from the EPA.

Rather than go through the 113

procedure, a conference of going through th© various grounds
that th® EPA must incorporate into its order of compliance, it
chose to go to the Court of Appeals.
reason why they did.

I think there is a good

They did that because if they can win in

th© Court of Appeals, if those things can be heard in the Court
of Appeals under 307, they have voided the plan and they
start the procedure all over again back at the State.
If you look at what the Third Circuit did in

32

Duquesne, they have been back and forth to the EPA four times
on the original plan on economic and technological grounds.
The Court of Appeals couldn't keep up with the change in
technology.

At argument last March they were still submitting

new studies on technology to the Court of Appeals, and all they
were getting to,, a voiding of the plan which would require going
back to the State, back to the EPA, back to the Court of Appeals,
and then finally, only at that time, could you get an enforcement
started again.

And when you have two years in the Ninth

Circuit Court of Appeals for the case to be heard, you are
talking about the fact that if they could win by this route,
we cannot get back to enforcement, to a compliance schedule,
perhaps up to three years.

In fact, if you go through a

compliance hearing and order to enforce and a cas© to enforce
by the EPA, which the State could moot at any time by revising
the plan provided they still come under the primary air
quality standard, they could revise the plan along the way.
But assuming that you get to an enforcement proceeding, assuming
they have an equitable ground that must be heard, like going to
the market, like they can't close down all the plants, assuming
they have such a ground, the court at that point can fashion
an order after full adjudicatory type hearing, can fashion
an'order which will make the Clean Air Act as effective as it
can immediately.
Then you go up to the Court of Appeals on review at

33

that time and they review the record before the trial court
which must have findings of fact and conclusions of law and
the decree is in effect at that point* unless the Court of
Appeals were to stay it.

If new technology comes up* if a new

report comas up, you go back under rule 60(b) in the Federal
Rules, and you reopen at the ferial court.

You don't submit

technology reports to the. Court of Appeals on oral argument,
/

as was don® in Dugussne.
The fact is that once you get into economics and to
technology inevitably it's not a broad standard you are
concerned about.

You get down to how it affects on® plant.

All the plan does is set an emission standard.
complies is up to it.

How the plant

It may be if it. has an old plant it

can’t use a particular kind of technology, it may b@ if its
financial structure is weak, it can’t get to the market.
if its financial structure is strong it could.

Maybe

But as

Dugas?-'no indicates, you are getting to the point where to
consider these you have to consider it case by case.

And if

you are going to consider it case by ease, enforcement is the
only way you can, because at that point you call witnesses,
you have your experts on the stand, they are under crossexamination at chat time, and that is the way that this kind of
issue must b® heard.
So that I think that enforcement is the stage where
if they have a ground, then that’s where it must be raised.

It

may be equitable»

It may

will be, but. that will be

be — I just don’t know what they
fashioned as you go.

But to have it

heard in the Court of Appeals is impossible.
I think if th® Court would look at the State of .Texas v.
EPA which had to do with the Texas plan where the EPA changed
th© plan because they didn’t think the model used on oxides
would work, and th® Court

of Appeals at that point had to go

through a diffusion model

on oxides

as it applies not just to

electric utilities, but to all the various kinds of sources
that put oxides out- including automobiles and ©very kind of
plant that uses heat of any kind. And if you see there -- I
in
believe it was Mr. Justice Clark/eoncurring said that this is
no way to review this kind of matter as to technical •— they
did not have findings of fact or conclusions of law.

In fact,

after it was argued, they had to hold hearings informally with
the parties from both sides and in fact with experts so that
for the benefit of the Court, the expert could take them through
the diffusion model used by th© State and the one used by the
EPA.

And I think if you look at that -- and that’s just the

overall modal used, that didn't even get into th® question of
whsrcher or not it was feasible as to particular plants and
sources.
As far as the 302

standard is concerned, 60 percent

of your S02, according to the EPA, comes out, as reported in
Duguesne, comes out from electric power plants.

35
QUESTION?
my mind.

Mr. Taft, let me just get one thing off

You have been assuming, I think, that the issue can fa®

raised in an enforcement proceeding and that such a proceeding
would be an equitable proceeding.

Is it not possible that the

enforcement proceeding would be a criminal proceeding and would
the issue b@ raisable in such a proceeding?
MR. TAFT:

May it please the Court, I'm not sure what -~

I'm not conceding what the standard would be or what could be
raised.

The only one I will concede is that they can3t turn out

th© lights and that's a health balance that would b© drawn by
the court.
QUESTION;

You ar® saying it’s possible that the

argument might be successful in an enforcement proceeding.

You

do not concede — you don't necessarily agree with the Seventh
Circuit, then.
MR. TAFT;

Well, th© question

is what the grounds

could be that they would raise, and I think you have to go case
by case when that happens.
QUESTION;

Is it the position of the Solicitor

General, or does h© have a position, on whether these issues
may ba raised in an enforcement proceeding?
MR. TAFT;

Your Honor, I think that it would not be

strictly that the plan is void if feasibility is not economically
or technologically achievable.
and Congress saw it.

But the power to close is there

Th© question would h© a different kind of

36
choice. “The question would be that if itf's impossible for this
plantsat that point. I don’t think your ground would be that
^

it’s impossible, your ground would be that the health danger
QUESTION:

It’s always possible to close.

MR. TAFT;

At that point the health —

QUESTION;

1 think the question would b® if the

defendant could show that it ^as impossible to comply without
closing, would that be a defense in an enforcement proceeding
or an issue that could properly be raised in an enforcement
proceeding?
MR. TAFT;

)

If it were

electricity and turning out

fch© lights, if it ware a marginal and weak plant that’s not
involved with utilities which is producing, say, some product
and produces? SO2, it’s a marginal plant, it’s a weak company,
it can’t comply, I think the answer is, yes, it would close.
QUESTION;

The question is whether that is an issue

that defendant,in the judgment of the Solicitor General, is
that an issue that can

appropriately be raised in an enforcement

proceeding (a) civil, (b) criminal?
MR. TAFT;

<

(a) Yes, I think it 'can be raised. The
•\

)

• scopa of it will be decided by the courts at that time.

As

far as criminal is concerned, I would suggest that if it’s
an electric plant, if you couldn’t, close it, you can't put them
in jail for not closing it.

So I think that will just have to

wait and see hew it comes up in fact.

I don’t, believe that they

will bring that particular case.

If they do, I would be

surprised.
QUESTIONs

Meanwhile the utilities must live with

that uncertainty, is that not so?
MR. TAFT:
does shift the risk.

Yes, your Honor.

I think the statute

It puts the risk on them, and the risk

was intentional by Congress to force them to do the best they
can, if

parhaps under the fear that they may not prevail on

enforcement.

And that's a technology enforcing act, and it’s

a very powerful psrsuadant to persuade them to in fact develop
th© technology if they can.
QUESTION :

Mr. Taft, we are dealing with a utility,

and I suppose it's a regulated industry.

I suppose it's regulate»:

by the State, isn't it?
MR. TAFT:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

And rates have to hav© State approval?

MR. TAFT:

Yes, your Honor.

QUESTION:

And I suppos® under its permit It's

obligated to perform service until it is permitted to close.
MR. TAFT:

I believe so.

QUESTION:

So that ±tEs got to go to th© State on®

way or the other so the State can make up its mind.
MR. TAFT:

The State is heavily involved.

I would

suggest that under th© utility laws they hav© to give them a
r vi:© of return against proper expenditures, and the Clean Air

38
Act would be a proper expenditure.
The Third Circuit got into that and wanted the Court
of Appeals to make a judgment as to whether the PUC would
proparly apply the law, and that I think —
QUESTION:

There is no chance anyway that a utility

will say, "I must obey the law,85 namely,the Clean Air Act,
"therefor© I shall shut down and tall nobody.”
MR. TAFTs

They have to go

If you're helping me out, I think you are

absolutely right.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you.

Mr. Ferrell, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. FERRELL
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. FERRELLs

If I may, your Honor, I would Ilk© to

take only one or two minutes not to respond point by point or
to any extent to the argument that has been made.

I will refer

to our briefs on that, but I want to make on® unique point.

It

arises for the first time, I think, in American juridical
history.

And that is that we have her© th© very anomalous

situation where a State can place an emission, limitation in a
plan that exceeds the national air quality standard and that
by SPA approval of that plan it becomes Federal law.

Whereas,

the Federal Government itself if it mad® an implementation plan
could not place amission limitations that exceed the national

39
air quality standards.
That is due, 1 think# to a clear misreading of
section 116# both as to Congressional history and as to the
section itself.

So w@ pray for a reversal in accordance with

our prayer and petition.
Thank you.
MR. CEIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you# gentlemen.

The case, is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., oral argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded.]
