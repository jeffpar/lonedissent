ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL S. LIONEL, ESQ,
OH BEHALF OF CAPPAERT IT AL
MR. LIONEL;

Mr. Chief Justice and may ife please

th® Court:
This case presents dramatic features of both
fact and law but it can be decided on a narrow basis.
Factually, this case presents a contest between
two endangered species.
On the one hand, the individual farm operator
of the United States, whassa numbers declined no less than
40 pereant between the yaars 1959 and 1969, and on the ©the
hand, a species of fish known as Cyprinodon diabolis.
I

Cyprinodon is ©Iso known as pupfish and it
inhabits the Death Valley area of Nevada and California,
There are many species of pupfish, five of which
in 1970, war® declared to b© endangered.
Cyprinodon diabolis has a life ©pan of
approximately one year and at maturity it is almost on©
inch in length.

Its numbers have been stabilised for

4
several years now at several hmdred.
Legally, this case presents a contest between two
disparate rules of law, both formulated by this Court.
The first, which was in affect between fch© years
1935 and 1955, laid down that the- Congress, by. the Desert
Land Acts, no later than 1877, severed the land and the
water in the western arid states and then territories and
ceded all jurisdiction over non-navigable water in the
public domains to those

states and territories.

The other, which was first espoused :Ln 1955 by
this Court and later extended and expanded, laid down that
when the United States reserved land in the public domain,
it could- also reserve water if there was intent to reserva
water and such intent could be implied.
QUESTION:

The first rule of law to which you

referred, i.e., that reserving the land, the United States
back as in the 19th century, 1.877, ceded jurisdiction over
non-navigable waters to the states.

That means juris­

diction to determine the rights and the waters under state
laws.

Is that it?
ME. LIONEL:
QUESTION:
MR. LIONEL:

the public and to

That is correct.
It didn't ceda the waters to the states.
It did not.

It said it belonged to

under the laws of the several states.

5
QUESTION:

tod what public?

Are you saying that

it also ceded or conveyed or gave up to the federal property?
MR. LIONEL:

Well, in the California ?ower case

this Court said that Congress by those acts held severed
the lend from the water and that the water then would belong
to the public to be given out as provided by the several
states.
QUESTION:

And to what public?

The federal

public or the population of the state?
MR. LIONEL:

No.

In other words, that the states

had jurisdiction and control over that water and it would
be up to the states involved to determine water rights to
that water and as pursuant to the laws of those severs!
states.
QUESTION:

And prior to 1877, the Federal

Government, under your submission or prior, at-least to
sometime in the 19th century, the Federal Government in the
territories had jurisdiction over the land and the water
to apply its federal law to the ownership of the land end
wafer and it also, d© you concede, had 'ownership of both
the land and the water»
MR. LIONEL:

2 concede that at some point th®

Federal Government had ownership of both the land and the
water but th© California Power case, that doctrine enunciated
there said by 1877 at the latest there was a severance of

s
water and land and jurisdiction ceded to the states.

There

were a series of desert land acts.,
QUESTION:
did own the water,

Wall, jurisdiction to determine who
Is that it?

MR, LIONEL?

No,

Jurisdiction to determine who

was entitled to the water.
QUESTIONs

Well, that's — who had the water

rights?
ME, LIONELs

The rights, beneficial us© of that

water.
. QUESTION:

that, but —■ I see — but no rights in and of themselves
except the right to decide.
MR. LIONEL:

Is that it?

It said it belonged to the public,

And to be given out, pursuant to the laws of
the several states.
QUESTION:

Including the power or the right to

pass on claims of the United States.
MR. LIONEL:

Precisely.
ted it repudiated th© riparian concept

state.
MR. LIONEL:

In substance, yes, but it said that

7
the states were still free to use whatever the state felt
*

should fo@ used by that state for the water and —
QUESTION3

tod the fact of the matter is* that

the arid western states do not apply the riparian rule.
They apply the prior appropriation rule.
MR, LIONEL:

Now, in th® viof th® Cappa©rt®9

the owners of a large farm in Nevada# neither quasition n®®&
be determined but this cas© can b® decided on a more
narrow basis by giving consideration to th© reservation of
public lands here involved and th© effect of giving that
reservation below and I will show that there are five
cumulative reasons why the judgment below does not properly
flow from that reservation.
Briefly, in January, 1952 — and that data is
significant and I will refer to it later in several
connections, in January, 1952, th© President reseryed a
40-acre tract of land in order to preserve a pool of water
known as the Devil's Hole in Nevada,
The proclamation described that pool as being a
remarkable underground one and of outstanding scientific
importance and interest.

There was nothing in that

proclamation about water and yet, on the strength of that
proclamation, the Cappaerte have been onjoined from pumping
water on 21 square miles, which is effectively their entire
farm and as a matter of economics will utterly destroy their

8
business enterprise.

Now, how would such results

QUESTION:

This proclamation did refer to a

pools, didn’t it?
HR. LIONEL:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
So there is something ©aid about

water.
HR. LIONEL:

Wall, yes, but ifc refers to it as

beinq a remarkable underground pool.
about water in there.

It do©sn8t say anything

The word "water" never occurs.

How is this result justified below?
The court said both parts here, "Pumping from
this 21 square miles of your farm will endanger these
pupfish which by reason of later legislation, legislation
many years after the withdrawal have been deemed to be
endangered and therefore entitled to special protection.
As I said before, I will show five cumulative
reasons why this result, this conclusion, is unjustified
and wrong.
First, the terras of. the proclamation do not
support the effect given to it below.

That proclamation’s

text appears on pages C-l to 03 in the Cappaert’g petition
for certiorari.

That is a small, \mr~f blue book.

The proclamation reserve© 40 acres containing
this peel.
It explains why the pool,, known a© Devil’s Hole,

9
is of remarkable scientific importance and interest.

It

doesn't say that about the pupfish.
The proclamation states that the pool should be
afforded special protection.

It doesn't say that about the

punfish.
The pupfish are referred to only in the fourth of
five preambles and then only as further confirming geologic
evidence of the importance of the pool.
Now, i stress -QUESTION:

Mr. Lionel —

Yea, sir.
If your clients pump water, that will

Everybody agrees on that, don't they?

MR. LIONEL:

yes, sir.
QUESTION:

And that broad language in there about

it?
MR. LIONEL:
No one knows the

QUESTION: Well, it would interfere with it.

It — the effect of our pumping will be to

reduce the level but our pumping is not reaching their water.
QUESTION:

We agree it will reduce the level of

11
the pool.
M". LIONEL:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir,

I stress geologic evidence because there is
nothing in that proclamation saying that the fish are
biological, zoological, or icthyologic evidence of any kind.
There is nothing in the proclamation saying that
the puofish are of scientific importance, other than as
being confirming such geologic evidence.

There is nothing

in that proclamation which says that the pupfish warrant
preservation and yet the denial of the Cappaerts' rights
to pump on 21 square miles rested on that proclamation,
I come now to the second reason why the judgment
below is wrong and that is because it involves judicial esc
post facto action.
As I stated before, the proclamation dates from
January, 1952 and yet the first Act of Congress providing
for endangered species did not come into being until
October, 1966, 14 and a half years later and it was not
until October of 1970 that these pupfish were declared
endangered species.
That was 18 years and nine months after this
*

proclamation, which was construed below to warrant the
destruction of the Cappaerts ranch and all without compen­
sation.
QUESTION:

When did the Cappaerts begin to

12
acquire their property?
LIONEL:

They started farming there in 196 7.

They acquired it shortly before.
QUEhTTON:
HR. LIOImEL:

'S7?
1967 and approximately half the

land was acquired in exchange with the government in 1969 —■
the Cappaerts acquired other land which they traded
government.

to the

At the time they traded it, in determining the

value of the land being acquired from the government as
part of their ranch, it was predicated on the basis that
the Cappaerts would ba able to pump water.
QUESTION:

I suppose what you really want is

for the government to condemn this interest if the
government wants it.
HR. LIONEL:

That is an obvious way.

As a matter

of fact, the implied reservation doctrine has often been
called, a financial doctrine that enables the government
under that doctrine to acquire water from people and not
pay for it.
QUESTION:

On the expectation of the Cappaerts,

the findings of the district court and the court of appeals
are against you, are they not, insofar as any representation
by the government were concerned?
HR. LIONEL:
Court.

We did below.

We do not argue estoppel in this

All of the endangered species provides for
condemnation of lands required to preserve endangered
species.

It provides for the condemnation of land, land

rights, interest in lands, and, in 1973, with respect to
water there can lie condemnation.
I turn now to a third reason why the judgment
below is wrong and that stems from the legislation on which
the withdrawal effected by the proclamation rested.
The sole authority cited in the proclamation
is the 1906 Act for the Preservation of American Antiquities.
That authorises a reservation of water — excuse me.
That authorised a reservation of land in certain
instances to become national monuments.

It does not

authorize withdrawal or reservation of water.
The history of that act — the legislative
history, fend this is voluminous, demonstrates that it was
sponsored by a consortium of archeological societies that
were seeking congressional approval for the preservation
and gathering of those artifacts and objects of antiquities
which were then being uncovered in the southwestern part
of the United States.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lionel, are

you suggesting that

the 1906 authorization would not be broad enough to undertake the preservation of anything except land, as such?
MR. LIONEL:

Precisely.

14
QUESTION;

What about something like Crater Lake,

which is a unique lake somewhere out in that part of the
country.

Couldn't they preserve Crater Lake under that

set of statutory authorizations?
MR. LIONEL;

I am not prepared to say they could.

There may be ~~ there must be other authority for the
Federal Government to do it but clearly, the statute is
not for the purpose of
QUESTION:

preserving any —
The 1906 act didn't say real estate

antiquities or anything of that kind, did it?
LIONEL:

Well, I am not arguing at this

point that the preservation of Devil's Hole would not be
justified under the 1906 act.

My point is that the 1906 act

would not authorize the reservation of land and the
reservation of water under the methodic reservation doctrine
because or the fish in there and that is the government's
contention in this case.
There is nothing in the act which deals with
the fishes.
QUESTION:

Well, is it your position that the

fish are not an object of historic or scientific interest?
MR. LIONEL;
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Within the meaning of the statute,

of course.
MR. LIONEL:

Within the meaning of the 1906 act

IS
because the entire tenor of that act is to deal with
artifacts, prehistoric artifacts.

Indeed, the title of

that act, the Act for the Preservation of American
Antiquities so indicates.

The act provides for the

gathering of these artifacts and placing them in museums
for permanent preservation and the Cappaerts ask, .. how
does one place in a public museum for permanant preservation
a fish with a

life span of less than one year?

QUESTION:

If they had located a dead dinosaur,

they could have reserved the area, but not a live dinosaur?
MR. LIONEL:

If one could say that it

artifact, I don't think so.
man-made.

was an

1 think an artifact is probably

I would say that someone could quibble that the

1906 act could authorize the creation of a national
monument to preserve that,.
QUESTION:

t

Well, the reservation of Grand

Canyon, wasn’t that based on the 1906 act?
MR. LIONEL:

Yes, it was, and that is Cameron

at 252nd U.S., of which I am aware.
Now, in that case, this Court held that Grand
Canyon was an object of scientific- importance and interest.
QUESTION;
MR. LIONEL:

Surely it is not man-made.
Surely it is not.

I agree with

that and I say that there is nothing in that opinion
indicating that this Court’s attention was directed to the

16

legislative history of the 1906 act and I have since read
the briefs in that case and ean represent that there was
nothing in the briefs that called the Court’s attention to
the history of the 1906 act in Cameron.
i

But the important thing is that in-

Cameron,

this Court was not concerned with whether or not the act
should be used with respect to living creatures.

It was

purely natural phenomenon.
Mow, the fourth reason, why this judgment is wrong
also rests on the terms of the authorising statute?
House Report, the debate and, indeed, the

the

express terms of

the act provide that withdrawals of land under it shall be
limited to the smallest area compatible with the proper
cars and maintenance of the objects to be protected.
Let's see what we have here.

i

On the one hand we have a 40-acre tract reserved.
As a matter of interest, that is protected by barb wire
and only VIP's in the zoological world are allowed to go
to Devil's Hole and see what is there, providing

the

National Park Service will permit them entry.
And on the pfcher hand, the consequence of that
{

-

40-acre reservation of land., the Cappaerts have been, enjoined
effectively from pumping on 21 square miles of the land.
Now, thus

far, I have restricted myself from

speaking about the 21 square miles where the Cappaerts have

17
been enjoined from pumping but based on the expert testimony
in this record, pumping in an area of 4,500 square miles,
the size of the

groundwater basis here involved, called

an aquifer, will in time affect the level of the water
in Devil’s Hole.
No one knows when.

Mo one knows where but this

water just percolates and seeps under the earth in no defined
paths, little droplets going under the ground and it is
shown by the record, experts are unable to predict.
As a natter of fact, the government expert said
here, if wa had two wells, one adjacent to the other, pumping
under one may affect the level of the water in Devil's
Hole,

Punping in the other may not.
Thus, if the decision below is affirmed, this

40~acre withdrawal may control pumping in an area of 4,500
square miles.

And that is the land area of the State of

Connecticut.
Now, the Cappaerts do not have to conjure up
possibilities, probabilities, imaginable horribles.

The

amici do that, and counsel for the State of Nevada will
explain to this Court the difficulties that the state will
have in administering their water laws if this case is
affirmed.
It is enough for the Cappaerts to point to the
final decree in this case which — in which they have been

18

on
enjoined from pumping/21 square miles in reliance of a
withdrawal of only 40 acres and that, based on the authority
of a a statute which says, withdrawal from the public
domain shall bo of the smallest parcel of land possible»
How great a perversion of legislative or
congressional intent can we have?
The Cappaerts say that Congress did not
authorize the wide-ranging impairment of ownership effected'
and approved below.
I come now to the fifth reason why the judgment
below is wrong and that is the failure of the court below
to consider the proclamation in its setting.

4

X
QUESTION:
Mh. LIONEL:

To do what?
Consider the proclamation in its

setting -— leoni setting.
As our brief shows, the lav/ of this Court in 1935
and 1955, the jurisdiction over non-navigable water in the
west had been ceded to the several states and territories.
It was not until 1955 in the Federal Power
Complies ion versus Oregon that any question arises with
respect to the section of jurisdiction over that water.
And it was not until 1963 in Arizona versus
California that the implied doctrine with respect to —
implied reservations doctrine with respect to the federal
enclaves was first announced and even in that case it dealt

19

with navigable waters, the Colorado River, not non-navigable
water»
Now, as

a Nevada citisen — and Nevada is an

arid land state indeed — I hope that this Court will

reaffirm the earlier doctrine and sharply limit the applied
reservation doctrine.
Rut as counsel for the Cappaarts, I need not and
I do not qo that far.

It would be sufficient if this Court

v/ould view that control lina proclamation in the legal climate
which existed at the time it was signed and consider it in
the light of the law as it v?as at that time and as everyone
understood the law to be.
As we show in the brief, the severance doctrine
was first comprehensively formulated by this Court in 1935.
It was reaffirmed in Ickes versus Fox in 1937.

Both —

What about the Indian Reservation

QUESTIONs
cases?

MR. LIONEL:

We say the Indian — those are

Indian cases and we think they should not be considered in
the same light.
QUESTION:

Well, I don't blame you for not

wanting to consider them.
MR. LIONEL:
Mr. Justice White.

Well, let me tell you why,

We think the Indians are wards of the

Court, as this Court has said 'so many times and if the

20

aovornment wants to reserve land, it should reserve water
if it does have power to do so.
OUOGTIOTJ:

■’Jell, what about the Indian Reservation

cases?
Mil. LIONEL:

The Indian Reservation cases

came

into being because of treaties made by the government with
the Indians.
QUESTION:

I know, but nevertheless, you set

aside the land and all of a sudden the Federal Government
claims some water rights in

connection with it and it is

held that they intended to do so when they reserved the
reservations.
MR. LIONEL:

Because they said it would be unjust

and unfair for the government to not. -QUESTION:

Well, the case said that, we can’t

imagine that the government didn't intend to reserve some
water because they certainly realized the Indians needed
some water to live on.
MR. LIONEL:

Mow, this proclamation said, we are

interested in that — among other things we are interested
in that pool of water.
MR. LIONEL:

I am to the

We are arguing

about the level of water in this case.
And if there weren’t any pupfish in' it at all, I
suppose that it could be argued that under the proclamation,,
the government was interested in maintaining that pool,

MR. LIONEL:

MR. LIONEL:

It might very x-tfell have been.

At any rate, both those decisions were unanimous
by this Court and they were reaffirmed in later cases and
in May of 1951 this Court in Dority versus New Mexico,
which it dismissed for lack — for want of a substantial
federal question did so on the basis of the California
Power case.
Thus, this Dority case was only eight months
prior in time to the date of the proclamation and if the
California Power Doctrine was the law of this Court, which
it clearly was and everyone understood it to be, jurisdiction
over the water in the west had been ceded to the several
states and therefore there was no water to reserve and
therefore there was no way that the United States or the
President of the United States ~~ President acting for the

United States could have intended to reserve water and
intention is the touchstone of the implied reservation
doctrine,
QUESTION:

Mr, Lionel,, I want to be sure I have

your position straight. You are saying that in February
if
of 1952,/somebody bought land right outside the 40-acre
tract, dug a well in it and drained the water out and
reduced the water level within the pool, that would not
have been inconsistent with the President’s intention.
That is what I understand your argument to be.
MR. LIONEL:

Well, I try to differentiate

between the pool and pupflsh because it is clearly the -intention was —
QUESTION:
MR. LIONEL:
QUESTION:
MR. LIONEL:

No, I am talking about the pool.
~~ to preserve the pool.
Yes.
That is not necessarily ray position

but I say we are only talking —
QUESTION:

In other words you say they could have

done that in February 1952.

They could have drained the

water out of the pool if they had stayed outside the 40-aere
tract.
That is what I understand your argument to be.
MR. LIONEL:

Under the law that is true because

of the section of jurisdiction.

QUESTION:

Nell, do you — suppose the -- all

you are claiming in ~~ well, you are claiming, at least you
are claiming .in nart that if the government wants water
rights it can aet then adjudicated, at least in state
proceedings.
MR. LIONEL:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
And you say, in accordance with state

law.
MR. LIONEL:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
And you would argue, apparently, that

if the government had always had this pool set aside and
had never given it to Arizona —■ or Nevada that it wouldn't
have qualified as an appropriated use under the state law.
MR. LIONEL:

Well, the state would have a right

to say that they could have water, that that may be a
beneficial use because of it being a natural phenomenon.
QUESTION:

But you would say that at least it

would be determined by state law and not the federal law.
MR.

LIONEL:

OUESTION:
MR. LIONEL:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

That is your fundamental issue.
That's right, Mr. Justice.
Wouldn’t you qualify your answer to

Mr. Justice Stevens’ question as to

whether they could

pump right outside the pool boundaries by saying if the
law of Nevada permitted them to do that.

MR. LIONEL;

Clearly and the law of Nevada

would not grant a permit for someone to drill and pump if
this would affact the beneficial use by someone else and
that is one of the problems which will arise by an affirmance
of this case, as will be shown by Counsel for the State of
Nevada.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Lionel, if you

were planning on sharing your time with your colleague, you
have used a lot of his time up all ready.
MR, LIONEL;

I have 30 minutes.

He has 15

minutes.
I note that I can reserve the balance of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Allison.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE V. ALLISON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF NEVADA
MR. ALLISON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;
As it has been indicated, I am. representing the
State of Nevada and 1 think the assertion by the United
States Government that Nevada’s concern in this, and I
think the concern of several western states, is indicated
by the briefs that were filed in an amicus capacity, is the
substantially broader in our eyes than the conflict between
the rancher and the pupfish at this time and that there is
a substantial conflict, not only a present conflict, but a

26

recti potential for a future conflict and that conflict is
the state and federal conflict in the use and management of
water in all the western states, particularly a state like
Nevada but there are many others that fall

in the same

category.
Nevada happens to be the driest of all the states.
It gets less than nine inches of rain but I think Arizona
and many of the other states qualify.
OUTS ST I ON :
that a little bit?

Mr. Allison, would you expand on
It is difficult for me to see why the

states are so exercised in this case.

Is it because of the

Taylor Grazing Act?
MR. ALLISON:

No.

Well, not necessarily.

The

principle, historically, is that the states have controlled
the determination of water rights for use in the particular
states and the principle that has evolved is -- and that
includes the United States Government, as I think one of
the justices indicated earlier, except in the case where
Congress expressly indicated otherwise.
Everything else was left historically to the
prerogative of the states.
Nov-?, this principle resulted in a great deal of
certainty in determining water rights.

The certainty in

determining the water rights in most states was probably —
well probably still is — not then but is now the single

27
most important factor* in the development, the economic
development of those states and the certainty only came
because the states were allowed to determine those rights
unless Congress expressly indicated otherwise»
Then when you insert, not an expression of
Congress but an implied right considered at a later time
than the reservation, right away you begin to raise havoc
with the certainty that the states have established in
determining those rights»

It is at this point that the

states become concerned because the reservation position of .
the government, as I understand it, is the mere act of
reserving the land -- nothing further, no consideration of
/

the circumstances, the need, the extent of injury, the
importance of the water, the mare act of reserving the land
automatically

establishes the priority for the water right»

Nov/, that water right may not be asserted by the
United States Government for 20 years in the future»

In

the meantime, the State of Nevada is granting rights to
many adjacent property owners.
So they have been using these adjacent water
rights for 20 years»

Suddenly 20 years later, the government

says, "We have a water right and our priority right is the
date we reserved it, even though at that time we didn't
know we wanted it."

And that is what is causing this

concern and I think the magnitude of that is amplified, if

28

I might jisfc quote one or two short statistics, is that in
/

f;he State of Nevada, for example, and in fact, I think, in
II of the 'western states there are, 61 percent of the land
in 11 of the western states that is federally-reserved land.
Right now in the State of Nevada, you cannot have
a major ranch unless it is either next to or part of
federally-reserved land.
there

You simply can’t have it because

is so much federally-reserved land — 76 percent of

the State of Nevada is federally-reserved land.
All major sources of water in the State of Nevada
come from federally-reserved land and that includes under­
ground water which is charged by water from run-off from
federally-reserved land and that is why the magnitude of
the problem is so severe in Nevada and this is true in all
the other states.
QUESTIONi

I gather from the brief filed in the

State of Arizona that the City of Tucson is entirely
dependent on underground water, pumped water, not just for
irrigation but for domestic water use.
HR. ALLISON:

That is my understanding of

Arizona's position and I assume that is true.

I don’t find

that hard to believe because if the Justices are familiar
with the State of Nevada, the three population — or I
should say two and a half population centers that, we have
are located in areas where there is access to water and you

29
are right next to federally-reserved land and that under­
ground

water is just becoming a major source of water»
There simply isn’t enough other water and there

really isn't enough underground water, but without that,
there is no other development in the state and I think
Arizona is essentially in the same problem»

So it is not

just farmers.
QUESTION:

Give~ras

another example where

a so-

called prior reserved right would seriously interfere with
the states.
MR. ALLISON;
QUESTION:
’■

\

You mean --

Besides this case.

I can understand

'

how it operates in this case but just — usually setting
aside a national forest or something like that usually
doesn't imply reserving any water other than what falls on
it and runs off.
MR. ALLISON:

I might briefly give

you .an

example and I don't know that I am quoting the facts of
thrs case.

This is an existing case in the State Engineer's

Office and there are some other ramifications to it so I
don't pretend I know all the facts but. there is a river, the
Carson River, that runs out of the Sierras, which is
federally-reserved forest.

That river runs down through

and into a water-holding area in Lahaunton.
Carson City, which is our capital, does not have

30
any other source of water at the moment and there is a
moratorium on .building in Carson City.
As a result of that, the city council in Carson
City want to the next, county to try to get water from wells.
The wells happen to be next to the Carson River.

The

government has protested that and if you track it out, the
only legal basis they have to protest that is that the
river is going to go clown because Carson City is pumping
water to supply its people and the basis for that is that
the Carson River comes off the federally-reserved land and
therefore they have the right, the priority use of that and
they can control -QUESTION;

For what?

MR. ALLISOS:

'3acausa they own the land from

which the water comes because they reserved the forest.
QUESTION;

You mean they are claiming they have

the rights on the water -- the downstream water?
MR. ALLISON:

I don't want to get into the

position of saying that I know the government’s argument.
You asked me if I could cite —
QUESTION:

Nell, anyway, you are in another

argument out in your state with the government over
re s e rvs d r i ght s.
MR. ALLISON;

Yes, we have a very clear argument

on surface water in the Pyramid Laike Indian case.

There are

31
13,000 defendants in that case, an Indian case.
very real problem and it is in

It is a

the district court level

right now,
I hope I didn’t misstate the Government’s position
in that but I think it applies the logic that is there.
It is not Nevada’s position that there isn’t
an implied right.

That is not what we are saying.

are saying is, is that the doctrine of an implied

What we
reserve

t

right came out of the Winter case.

It came out of an

Indian case and in that case they just didn’t say, Congress
must have; intended.
In that particular case, this Court weighed the
competing interests and that is how the doctrine arose,
They looked at what ham would come to the other users on
the river, on the surface stream.

They just didn't auto­

matically say, okay, there's an implied — Congress must
have intended that.
And what we are really saying is that the Federal
Government should have the burden of establishing very
carefully the importance of the need, the extent of injury,
all the competing interests that go into it before we imply
an intent.
QUESTION:

In what forum?

MR. ALLISON:

In what forum?

Our position is

that that should be in the initial forum in the state

the
procedure that is already/existing, established means of —
QUESTION:

You mean the state court.

MR. ALLISON:

In our state it means an adminis­

trative procedure first.
QUESTION:

Subject, of course —

Reviewable where?

MR. ALLISON:

In a federal court because it is a

federal question and I think this was consistent with this
Court's position in the Eagle case that came out of
Colorado.
QUESTION:

This case was in the Federal District

Court ~~
■

MR. ALLISON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

~~ under what head of jurisdiction?

Because the plaintiff was the United States?
MR. ALLISON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And only for that — that was the

basis of the jurisdiction.
MR. ALLISON;
QUESTION:

And they filed --

Well, than, would it ba your position

that, while clearly there was a statutory jurisdictional
\

basis for the federal court to take the case, that there
was incumbent upon the federal court to apply Nevada law?
That, I suppose, would be what follows from your
brother1s argument.
MR. ALLISON:No, no, no --

33
QUESTION:

As far as the cession of jurisdiction

over these waters back in the 19th century to the State of
Nevada to determine under its lav; that even the federal
court should, by analogy to an area, Railroad against
Tompkins kind of a situation would have a duty to apply
Nevada lav/.

Is that your point?
MR. ALLISON:

No, sir, my point is that there

are really three -- Nevada recognises the implied reserva­
tion doctrine, whatever kind of law we want to call that,
state or federal law.

We have to grant water rights to our

citizens by the appropriateve means but that doesn’t mean
that the State Engineer in the administrativa procedure in
the State of Nevada cannot also recognize an implied right
if the circrumntnnces warrant it and that is all we are
asking that the states have the opportunity to do, that in
the existing system

of which all other water rights are

determined, that they have the opportunity initially to
QUESTIONs

To adjudicate

the

extending of the

federal right.
MR. ALLISON:

Subject to review in the federal

courts.
QUESTION:

Well, when you say the federal courts,

though, what is the normal procedure for review of your
engineer's decision?
MR. ALLISON:

It goes to the district court.

34
QUESTION:

Yes, and then the Supreme Court of

Nevada„
ALLISON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

So don’t you really mean the only

federal court that would he reviewing it would be this
Court on certiorari,
MR. ALLISON:

Nell, yes, really»

Yes.

Yes, it would be a direct review by
on certiorari.

this Court

That is right.

QUESTION:

But here this was in a federal district

court by reason of a very explicit jurisdictional statute.
Isn't that right?

The United States was the Plaintiff.

MR. ALLISON:

Yes, well, the argunent that we have

expressed in that particular case is because — and when we
expressed it in the district court is — at that point, even
concedincr there in concurrent jurisdiction in the sense that
they did have jurisdiction because it wan the Federal
Government, in this particular case, of course, you have
the additional problem of the fact that they did appear in
an administrative proceedings and not as alluded to in their
brief.

They just didn't appear as - a friend of the engineer.
They appeared as strongly as they could and that,

if for no other reason in this particular place — particular
case, the res judicata principle or the collateral estoppel
principle should be applied.

But --

35
QUESTION:

Was the United States a party?

MR. ALLISON:
QUESTION:

Well, they were a party in --

That’s easy.

Yes or no.

You know

what a party means.
mr.

ALLISON:

Mr. Justice, I don't think it is

that easy because I don't think you say -- they appeared,
they cross-examined, they presented witness, they orally
argued opening.

They orally argued closing.

I think that is a party.

Every time I appear as

a party, that is all the things that I do.

But they claim

they were not a party.
QUESTION;

Well, what is the title of the ease?

MR. ALLISON:
QUESTION:

What was the title of the case?

Yes.

MR. ALLISON:

Well, the way it arose was that

the Cappaerts filed an application to appropriate under­
ground water.

At the time that that^s filed, the govern­

ment filed protest on the basis that that pumping would
reduce the water level in Devil's Hole.
Pursuant to our procedure, which is an adminis­
trative procedure, a hearing was set, a formal hearing at
which the state engineer presided.
At that time, the government presented their
evidence, everything they had — presented witnesses.
presented the proclamation —

QUESTION:

Weil, whose side were they on?

MR. ALLISON:

They were on the government's side

in trouble with three parties.
MR. ALLISON:

It is not a suit.

I think the

question is, the real party in interest, if you have a
vital interest in the outcome of the proceedings.
QUESTION:

But this was not a regular court

action.
MR. ALLISON:
action.

It definitely was not a court

It wnr? an administrative hearing but the results

were the same.
QUESTION:

So they were a party as much as any­

body else.
MR. ALLISON:

The United States Government was

as much of a party as anybody else.
QUESTION:

That is what I wanted to know.

R?R„ ALLISON:
QUESTION:

No question about that

In my mind.

Mr. Allison, did the government take

37

the position that they opposed the reduction in the water
level because that was a factor that should be weighed

in

deciding whether or not to grant the permits, or did they
/

take the position that legally they had a right to object
because they owned the water, in effect?
MR. ALLISON:

I think they didn't quite go so

far as to advocate, at least the Solicitor General repre­
sentative

didn't go quite so far as to advocate that that

was a legal right.

They felt that it was a factor that

should be considered by the State Engineer and they at
that time didn't have sufficient evidence and said, well,
»

we would like you to wait,
j

,

'

However, they did introduce the proclamation
and by inference, by reading the transcript, I think they
alluded to the fact that that was their legal basis and
that, really, it was their right — although the go veraroent
counsel didn't make an extended argument that way.
i

QUESTION:

Did the engineer rule on that issue,

the legal issue?
ALLISON:

He ruled to the extent that he

indicated that there was reference to a federal right and
)

in his opinion there was not sufficient interest to
estaolish one.

That was three or four' lines in his decision.

QUESTION:

Mr. Allison, was the government a

party in the sense that would have enabled it to take an

38

appeal to the Nevada court from the administrative decision
of the engineer'?
Could the government have gone up within your
judicial system from that administrative proceedings?
NR. ALLISON:
I think they could have.

Yes, I think they could have.

Yes,

I am not sure that I can quote

you a precedent for that hut I don't know of any reason not.
I can’t pick a case out right now.
OURSTTON:

Any party at interest often may be

allowed to anneal from an administrative tribunal's
decision„
HR. ALLISON:

Yes, sir.

I assume again that

United States even then.

MR. ALLISON:
QUESTION:

Is that it?

Well, the law —

Is it state law?

/iit ti/:: ::\yiii"if
MR. ALLISON:

^

$

Well, the law, in my opinion, is

the Winters case set down by this Court and that is an
implied right and an implied
involves weighing th

right in its vary nature

circumstances to find what they

intended.
That is the law.
QUESTION:

It is not a state view.

I know, but the principles, whether

they are applied in your state tribunals or courts or in
the federal court are what?
)

Federal principles under

'.Vin.tors or state princinloo?
MR. ALLISON:

I don't know if it makes any

difference whether they call it a federal principle or a
state principle.

It is not the system that we use under the

40
appropriation method.

It is not the riparian doctrine and

as I indicated in my brief, in my opinion, it is a third way
that has been set forth by this Court to establish a water
right.
QUESTION:

And I suppose it has been imposed

upon state law, has it not?
MR. ALLISON:

As an addition or a —-

Yes, right.

It is another way

that it —
QUESTION:

It is an addition to your prior

appropriation, right?
MR. ALLISON:
QUESTION:

That is right.

It9s a qualification of it, or whatever

MR. ALLISON:

It's an addition.

Now, instead of

one way, we have two xxrays in the State of Nevada to establish
a water right.
QUESTION:

Mr. Allison, before you sit down, does

your state, Nevada, in its administrative proceedings or
anything else make any distinction between

surface water

and underground water?
MR. ALLISON:

No, not really in the procedures

that they go about it because the underground water refers
back to the surface water statute and the procedure of
finding the application and getting the determination by the
•state engineer is essentially the same.
There is a difference to some extant in that once

41
you receive a permit you also have to establish a period of
beneficial use and -— in other words, you have to put it to
use to determine the amount that you are entitled to.

You

just don't aet it and not use it at all.
QUESTION:

Well, that is an old principle, isn't

it?
MR. ALLISON:
QUESTION:

Of western water rights.

MR. ALLISON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Right.

But in other words, then, you almost

concede the hydrological, if that is the right word,
connection between surface water and underground water.
MR. ALLISON:

Well, no, not for purposes of the

implied reservation doctrine.

I concede only that the

hydrologists tell me that their cycle, that they are all
interrelated but I know that you cannot determine from the
surface where the underground water is and that you can't
determine — like, as an example in this casa, I am quite
confident that President Truman or none of the people that
were involved in invoking this proclamation were anywheres
near aware of the connection of the underground water in
that basin and so it is very difficult to understand how
you can go back and say, well, they must have intended to
do certain things, if you can’t determine from the surface
where it is.

42

Now, it seems to ma that there is a solution to
that.

That is not an impossible burden.

Certainly we have

enough technology that the government can determine, before
they make a reservation, as to what the existence or non­
existence of ground water is and what the connections are,
and all we are saying is that that is one burden that they
should meet before they can a imply an intent.
QUESTION:

You are not asking us to overturn the

Oregon case or the Winters case.

You accept the doctrine in

general of the implied reservation of water rights.
MR. ALLISON:
QUESTION:

We — well —

That is overlaid as a matter of

federal law on state adjudications.
MR. ALLISON:

You asked me two questions.

I am

not asking you to — we accept the Winters doctrine and the
implied reservation doctrine as an addition to creating a
right in the State of Nevada.
The Felton Pam case, in my opinion, is distin­
guishable and their reason on the reserve right I don’t
think was complete and I think that case could have been
cited —
QUESTION:

Your colleague, here, suggests that

this whole issue should be determined as a matter of state
law entirely and — but I gather that you seem to accept the
implied reservation doctrine in some form as a matter of

43

federal law because you have read the cases.
MR, ALLISON:
QUESTION:

The cases say so.

MR. ALLISON:
QUESTION:

Well, I accept it because —

Yes.

Mr. Allison, one more question and

maybe I could ask your opposition this,

list of national monuments and the proclamations under which
they were established

any significance?

I

Is this of

You are not raising any question that this

i.s not a national monument?
MR. ALLISON:

No.

From the State of Nevada's

standpoint I am not and I did not understand that that was
the question in the case.
QUESTION:

I don't think it is, but I was curious

and maybe Mr. Randolph can answer my question.
MR. ALLISON:

We are definitely not.

Yes, I

think that we have always assumed that it was a ne ional
monument.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Randolph.

We Ml try to let you complete today.
MR. RANDOLPH:

Thank you, Mr, Chief Justice.

44
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Your friends have

used their time up completely.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. RAYMOND RANDOLPH, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES ET AL
MR. RANDOLPH:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The United States brought this suit to prevent
the Cappaerts from extinguishing the world’s only population
of Cyprinodon diabolis, the Devil's Hole pupfish.
We contend in this case that Devil's Hole
National Monument was established in 1952 to protect the
pool that has been referred to and the fish in it, that the
water right of the United States is measured by reference to
that purpose and that the Cappaert's pumping of water must
be regulated to insure that they do not interfere with that
United States’ water ricrht, a federal riaht.
I think I'll tell the Court a little bit about
the facts of this- case and particularly the circumstances
that exist at Devil’s Hole.
At the center of this case is an anomaly, a fish
that lives in the desert.

The area involved, Southern

Nevada near the California border, not very far from Death
Valley, vras not always once the desolate place that it is
now.
Thirty thousand years ago it was cool and wet,

45

streams, lakes, rivers abounded and in fact, Death Valley
itself was a lake more than 100 miles long, more than 600
feet deep.
This was the home of the ancestors of the pupfish
that live in Devil's Hole today.
But the climate gradually changed.
to the North receded.

The glaciers

The land dried and the animals of the

area, which included the mastodon, the sabretooth tiger,
all disappeared.
Somehow, however, the pupfish managed to survive,
taking refuge in what one writer has called, "tiny islands
of water in a sea of sand.”
Of the four remaining species of Cyprinodon, the
Devil's Hole pupfish has been isolated the longest.

The

scientists that testified in this case estimate that these
fish entered Devil's Hole approximately 10,000 years ago.
Between then and now, this tiny fish, which, as
’1r. Lionel pointed qut„ is but one inch long, has performed
nothing short of an evolutionary miracle, evolving to its
present condition today, adapting to extreme circumstances in
what is, evolutionary-wise, a blink of the eye.
The pool in which Cyprinodon diabolis now resides
is the smallest sole natural habitat of any species on the
face of the earth.

The fish themselves make up the smallest

population of species of fish known to man.

The surface of

46

this pool which we have been talking about measures 1G feet
by 65 feet.

It is open to the sky, but it is 50 feet below

the surrounding land surface.

All but the western end is

bordered by sheer rock.
The water temperature is a constant 92 degrees
farenheit year-round.
The entire structure of Devil’s Hole and the
pool was once a limestone cavern.

The geologists testified

that eons ago the roof of the cavern collapsed, perhaps by
the dissolving action of the water inside, sending rocks
down to the bottom, as Mr. Lionel said, more than 200 feet
below.

Divers have gone down to at least 200 feet in Devil's

Hole but no one knows the exact depth.
But one piece of rock, not very much larger than
this table here, about nine feet wide at its widest and
nerhans 16 feet long, wedged below the surface of the pool
to form a natural shelf.

In the summer months, sunlight

reaches this shelf and about one-half of the pool itself,
only for a few hours a day, allowing algae and other small
organisms to grow there.
In the winter there are only shadows and the
algae dies.

The pupfish, as the district court specifically

found, are totally dependent on this natural shelf.
spawn there.

They

They feed there and when the algae dies, a

great part of the pupfish population dies with it, only,

47
hopefully, to recover again the following spring.
It is a precarious existence, but the pupfish have
been successful at it for 10,000 years.
These fish, a remarkable fish, are able to tolerate
extreme temperature changes and ranges in salinity up to six
times that of seawater but ever since the first study of
them began in 1936 they have been subjects of intense
scientific interest.
There are dozens of studies in this record, either
in the record in this case or as referred to by the witnesses
in this case and all of them relating to the pupfish.
QUESTION:

What do they do, if anything, for

humanity, Mr. Randolph?
MR. RANDOLPH:

Let me read what Dr. Pister, who

is one of the biologists, testified, Mr. Justice.

It is on

page 157 of the Appendix I am reading from now;
"As a research potential," he says, "these have
then

" he is talking about the fish, "have an almost

unlimited future.

Right now I know of any number of graduate

students who would just literally give anything to have an
adequate number of fish to use for experiments at the
doctoral level, to go through and do research papers."
QUESTION:

Well, what about?

You know, I mean the fact that a number of
gic-auatas may be interested in the archeological history of

48

them may be a perfectly useful human occupation, but is there
anything else?
MR. RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Let me continue.

Okay.

MR. RANDOLPH:

At the bottom, at page 157, he

talks philosophically — I am not going to repeat that — but
at the bottom of page 157 he says, "If this species does
become extinct, and heaven forbid! we can never bring it
back for all the expertise we have developed ecologically.‘!
Prior to that, on page 157, he says, "These species,
these little animals, they may very well hold the key to
our future as human beings as they learn to adapt to the
changes in their own habitat, just as we are having to do
for our own polluted waters, our own smog and so on."
QUESTION:

It doesn’t sound like a very rosy

future, each of us one inch long and living in S2 degrees
water and dying within a year.
MR. RANDOLPH:

Well, this case is about the

extinction of ihe species of fish.

I notice at one point

the testimony of Mr. Lionel said, "Well, isn’t it true,
Doctor —I think it was another doctor, Dr. Deacon, "that
these fish will become extinct?"

And Dr. Deacon said, hes,

that is true and so will homo sapiens.

What we are talking

about hare is the acceleration of the process," and I think
that is relevant and I think it is relevant on page 158, what

49
Dr. Pister says, that it is impossible to judge the value
of this fish.
There are intense studies going on now, genetic
studies, biological studies, studies by fish experts to
determine precisely what it is that caused these fish to
adjust, unlike any other species in the world.
What they are worth to us in 2072 can't be
measured by what we know of them today, he explains.
I don't think any great scientific breakthrough
has come from them yet, though.
QUESTION:

Mr. Randolph, does the record tell us

why the Government reserved 40 acres?
is only 65 feet long.

I take it the pool
• *

MR. RANDOLPH:

I think the surrounding area of

the rocks and everything -- the directive in the act was to
reserve the smallest area consistent with maintaining it.
If you reserved just the pool you obviously couldn't put a
fence around it and this was obviously just a discretionary
judgment by the President, as he had the authority to do, so
I don't know.
QUESTION:

Is it conceivable, to taka up

Mr. Lionel's argument, that this was the area from which the
President intended to exclude walls, thinking this would be
sufficient to protect the pool?
MR. RANDOLPH:'

No, I don't think that is

50
conceivable.

And I'll explain why later in my argument.

Because of their vulnerability, there have been
numerous attempts to raise the pupfish to transplant them.
Between 1947 and 1972, there were ten attempts.
failed.

All of them

There is a reference in the record here to a later

attempt at Hoover Dam which at one point looked like it
might work, but all the scientists testified that they could
not qualify it as a success.
It started out with 24 pupfish.

By the time the

case had reached June, 1973 there were 170 pupfish in this
small aequarium near Hoover Dam and I noticed when I
distributed to the Court the latest report of the Special
i

Master, which has attached to it a report of Dr. Deacon
which points out that the pupfish population at Hoover Dam
is dwindling.

It is now down to 65.

One reason for this is population threshold and
I think this is important to this case.

The minimum popula­

tion needed for a species to survive indefinitely, 24
Cyprinodon diabolis, may not be enough and the sceinfcists so
testified.

Inbreeding occurs because of the lack of genetic

variations.
The passenger pigeon is an example, as one of the
biologists testified in this case.

Although thousands of

them were left after they had been hunted, they were below
wiiwsir minimum population threshold level and despite efforts

51
to preserve them, they died off»
There was testimony in the record that some
scientists believe the blue whale, for example, has reached :
that point.
The threshold level of Devil's Hole pupfish
obviously cannot be known until it is too late.
The testimony in the record -- some scientists
believe that it was somewhere between 100- and 200 fish.
As I stated earlier, the natural shelf at Devil's
Hole is crucial to the existence of the pupfish and this is,
of course, essential that it be covered with water.
Despite their remarkable ability to adapt to
changing circumstances, the one thing the pupfish has not
learned to adapt to is the absence of water.
At the normal level, the shelf is fully submerged.
It is 1.2 feet below a copper washer which is used as a
marker and was installed by the National Park Service in
1962.
The Cappaerts began pumping water in 1968.

Yearly,

they were taking out of this area 2-billion,281-million
gallons of water for their ranch in the desert.

The evidence

shows, incidentally, that soma but not all of their wells
are hydraulically connected with Devil's Hole.
As they pumped over the years, the water level in
Devil's Hole dropped and in turn the natural shelf began to

52
be exposed.

In 1970, the natural shelf was 46 percent

covered although it had been 100 percent before the pumping.
By 1971, the shelf became only 21 percent covered with
water.
By June of 1972, when the first hearing of this
case was held, the natural shelf was covered only 10 to 15
percent with water.
The usual summer population of pupfish at Devil’s
Hole is about 700.

In 1961 it reached a high between June —

in June between 200 and 300 fish, less than half of that
that had been in existence before the pumping started.

It

did slightly better in 1972, going up to about 400 but I
notice in the latest Special Master’s Report that is before
the Court now that last year in 1975, the highest the pupfish
population reached was but 294.
The evidence shows therefore, and the district
court found that it is necessary to maintain the water level
at Devil’s Hole until it covers the shelf, that is three
feet below the proper marker.
This is the only way to have a continuing, viable
population there and that is what the district court ordered.
Now, Mr. Lionel in his argument talked about
being prevented from pumping on 21 square miles of. his ranch.
That is not accurate.
Number one, with respect to the walls that were

53

under the injunction in this case, he is not prevented from
pumping.

They are only pumping — their pumping has to be

regulated so they do not drop the water level between 3.0
feet.
Mr. Lionel said in his opening statement that —
and I quoted this — that the injunction in this case utterly
destroys his business enterprise.

There is no evidence what­

soever in the record to that affect.
QUESTION:

But given the water table, certainly

that requirement could be a proscription against pumping if
the water

table gets low enough.
MR. RANDOLPH:

I would refer you, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, to the Special Master's reports, one of which I
filed, which shows the hours of pumping from the wells at
the Cappaerts ranch.

It is not a proscription against

pumping and I might point out, while I am talking about this,
that some of the wellfe on the ranch are not even covered by
the injunction.
The reason is that the hydrologist who testified
for the Federal Government in this case said they were not
hydraulically connected with Devil's Hole, even though they
were but a few miles from Devil's Hole.
QUESTION:

Well, supposing Mr, Cappaert turns on

those pumps that are covered by the injunction and the Special
Master learns that the water in the pool holding the fish is

54

down below the three-foot mark.

Then how is the mandate or

the injunction carried out?
MR. RANDOLPH:

Well, he has to stop pumping until

the water level recovers.
QUESTION:

And if it doesn't recover for several

weeks, that is a proscription against pumping for those
several weeks, isn't it?
MR. RANDOLPH:

I am talking on a yearly basis.

Some days he may not be able to pump.

On other days he may

be able to pump.
QUESTION:

Well,, and if it is a critical time for

irrigating a crop, then not being able to pump for several
weeks may not be the same as not being able to pump all year.
MR. RANDOLPH:

Well, that may be.

That may be.

But the injunction nevertheless does not say,

Mississippi and when I refer to them I am not referring to
that they are doing the pumping.

It is people that run the

says that you cannot pump to a certain extent.

It

And beyond

that, Mr. Lionel refers to 21 square miles of the ranch.
If the Court examines the decree in this case, it
doesn't cover the entire

ranch.

There is a great portion in

the northwest section of this ranch that is not covered by
the injunction.

The reason is that although it is a few miles

55

away, it is not hydraulically connected with Devil’s Hole.
It is served by another system in the aquifer and therefore,
puraping there will not have any effect on Devil's Hole and
while I am on this topic, I notice throughout the brief that
Mr. Cappaert filed or

that Mr. Lionel filed for Mr. Cappaert

and also through the State of Nevada they talk about this 40acre tract controlling 4 <.500 square miles of an acquifer
that, by reserving just 40 acres, the United States has there­
by served authority over 4,500 square miles of an acquifer.
That is not so.
The testimony in the record, and I'll give the
Court the citation so I can look them up — at Appendix page
79, the government's expert talks about the aquifer in this
4,500 square miles and I think, I believe, I am looking at it
now -- that Mr. Lionel was cross-eximining on this and he
said, "If there were substantial pumping, for example, from
the site 40 miles northeast of Devil's Hole ~ the groundwater
moves from the northeast towards Devil's Hole — what effect
would that have?
Well, over a period of decades there may be a
small effect.
Pumping at another site 40 miles away at the rate
of 2,000 gallons a minute, which is 28 million gallons a day
would, the hydrologist testified — again -— after a period
of time have a slight, perhaps indiscernible effect on the

56
water level at Devil’s Hole.

referred to, 15 miles to the north of Devil’s Hole.

fied at page 99 of the Appendix, if you get any considerable
distance away from Devil’s Hole the amount , and I quote,"the
amount of recharge which the basin would

pick up between

the center of pumping and Devil's Hole would replenish it."
It would not have any kind of

discernible effect

on Devil’s Hole.
We are talking about an area directly involved in
this case, an area surrounding Devil's Hole, an area that is
just a few miles from it.
QUESTION:

for that statement you just made that it is just an area just
a few miles from it?

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

Sir?

How far away are the wells?

57

MR. RANDOLPH:

Between — I think two and a half

miles is the furthest one*. Mr» Justice Stevens.
Nov;, first of all , let me deal with the first
argument that Petitioners make in this case which relates to
the Act to Preserve American Antiquities.
An antiquity, incidentally*, is something belonging
to or dating from a time long past and I think the pupfish
qualify for that but as petitioners have indicated, the
Devil's Hole National Monument was set aside by President
Truman in 1952 and Mr. Justice Blackmun, in that appendix to
43 U.S.C. or 16 U.S.C. 431, does not include all the national
monuments.

I think it is a sampling and I don't know the

system by which they were selected but there are any number
that are not in there including, I think, tha Grand Canyon,
as a matter of fact.
QUESTION: No, I think that is there.
MR. RANDOLPH:

Is it there?

QUESTION;

But in any event, you comfort me.

QUESTION:

The Colorado National Monument is

there so it is a good list.
QUESTION:

The only antiquity mentioned by

President Truman was the pool, wasn't it?
MR. RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

Well, I — I — I don't think so.

Well, what

MR. RANDOLPH:

else was mentioned?

Because the way the acx. is --

Mr. Justice, the way the act —

58
QUESTION:

I am talking about the proclamation.

What else was mentioned other than the
MR. RANDOLPH:

pool?

The fish themselves and I’ll relate

that if I can first talk about the action and then ;he
proclamation.
QUESTION:

But the proclamation says "pool.”

MR. RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

That is right.

Yes.

And that is antiquity?

That is an antique?
MR. RANDOLPH:

No, antiquity means something from

the past relating to the past •— yes.
QUESTION:

Well, the pool has been there quite a

I agree on that.

But that is not a generally-

understood antique, is it?
MR. RANDOLPH:

No, antiquity, not antique.

Nov/, that act authorizes the President in his
discretion to reserve public lands for preservations of
objects of historic or scientific interest.
Petitioners say that under this Act there could be
no monument to protect the pool and the fish in it.
hardly clear why.

It is

Pupfish are certainly objects of scientific

interest.
The Cappaerts in their brief — and then I notice
in their argument — also stated that the act extends only
to artifacts appropriate for preservation in public museums.

59

Aside from the fact that the Grand Canyon is a
national monument and it was held to be properly so in
Cameron — and I don't know of any museum that could hold it —
the C£Q Canal is a national monument, not very far from here.
Mr. Lionel talks about the act as

preserving

only dead objects, I suppose.
Let me give you an example.

We pointed it our in

our brief and Mr. Justice Rehnquist may be familiar with
this — the Swallow National Monument south of Phoenix was
set aside in 1933 and I quote from the Presidential Procla­
mation there,

Because of 'the exceptional growth thereon

of various species of cacti."
There are other national monuments that preserve
living things, the Buekivan Reef National Monument in the
Virgin Islands, the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument also
in Arizona, the Joshua Tree National Monument in California.
QUESTION;

Are these all under the Antiquities Act?

MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes, Mr. Justice, they are.

It is, we submit, untenable to say that under an
act for the preservation of objects of scientific interest
the President of the United States could create a monument to
protect the pupfish only after they had died and become
fossilized.

But that is precisely what Mr. Lionel's

argument leads you to
Now, as far as the proclamation is concerned, we

60

believe it clearly indicates that Devil's Hole Monument was
set aside to preserve the pool and the pupfish in it.

It is

difficult, we think, to read it in any other way.
President Truman was not acting to protect the
rocks in this case.

In the proclamation he referred to

geologic data but he also referred to on page C-2 of the
Appendix from which Mr. Lionel quoted that "said pool is of
such outstanding scientific importance that it should be
given special protection."
The pool is of outstanding scientific importance,
not because of the rocks surroxanding it but because of the
unique species of fish found nowhere
live in

else in the world who

it.
QUESTION:

Well, why doesn't the proclamation

say that?
MR. RANDOLPH:
Mr. Justice.

Well, I think it fairly does,

The preceding paragraph, when it refers to the

scientific importance of the pool, the paragraph preceding
that states that the"presence in this pool of a peculiar
race of desert fish — and zoologists have demonstrated this
race of fish found nowhere else in the world -— evolved —
•.

only a gradual drying up -- it is more or less a statement
of the facts that I just have given the Court.

We think

indicates that the scientific interest of that pool is the
fish in

it and if you remove the fish you extinguish the

it

61

scientific interest in the pool.
The record in this case is repleta with studies,,
scientific studies.

There are dozens and dozens of them.

There is not a single study that I know of in this record*
and I stand corrected if 1 am wrong* that relates to Devil's
Hole by a geologist in some way unrelated to the pupfish.
Every study that is either referred to or in this
record is because of the pup fish,,
QUESTION:

Mr. Randolph* if there is no interest

in protecting the rocks* why did they need 40 acres?

QUESTION:

You were going to explain to me why it

is unreasonable to assume that that was the area from which
it was intended to exclude wells.
MR. RANDOLPH:

I think that when President Truman

set this aside* I think the area surrounding it was public
land.

At that time I don't think that it was necessary — so

far as it appears in 1952* there was no indication that there
were any wells in that area.

the distance would be.

Could he not then have increased the

size of the monument?
MR. RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And protected it that way.

MR. RANDOLPH:

I think so, but by condemnation

but I’ll talk a little bit later -- well, maybe I'll mention
it now.

I think the condemnation argument is sort of a red

herring in this case.
The fact is, when this was set aside in 1952,
there was nothing to condemn.
|

To say now, as Mr. Lionel

says, well, what you ought to do is take our rights by
condemnation , is to assume the very issue in this case,
that as against the United States they have some rights to
take.
QUESTION:

Yes.

But your argument partially

assumes that the other way because they left the unreserved
title over and above the 40 acres open to patent and people
came in and either got patents or it was exchanged.
MR. RANDOLPH:

Well, let me put it this way.

Absolutely.

Do you think Pelton Dam represented .

statements in the California Oregon Power case that are
inconsistent with the statement you just cited.

briefs and I think

of all, if you read the Desert Lands Act it says nothing
about separating the water from the land or anything like
that.

It doesn't say that at all.
All it says is that with respect to the public

lands of the United States, the people are entitled to get a
water right pursuant to state law.
The statement in the case that Mr. Lionel relies
upon was just a statement in regard to that.

It wasn't the

act -QUESTION;

Well, but I always thought Beaver was

regarded as the leading case construing the Desert Land Act
of 1877.

Do you disagree with that?
MR. RANDOLPH:

In this case — in — if you i^ere

talking about public land, if you were talking about somebody
establishing a water right on public lands and in the public
domain, I would say absolutely yes.

If you are talking about

like Devil's Hole, I'd say no, it is not.

QUESTION:

Well, you shouldn't rely on Arizona

against California because it didn't cite Pelton.
MR. RANDOLPH:

I do not cite it for the Desert

Lands Act, I cite it for the reserve rights.
The removal of the pupfish, as I said, and you
remove the scientific

importance of this pool and I think

President Truman understood that full well.

The President

referred specifically to the fish, as I have said and thus
we think it plain that

and the courts below, incidentally,

agreed — that Devil's Hole became a national monument, not
because of a rock formation but because of a pool of water
in the desert containing a remarkable race of fish that had
been there for 10,000 years.
That is something worth protecting and preserving
and President Truman did it in 1952.
The next question obviously concerns the
reservation doctrine and we have discussed that somewhat, but
under this doctrine, it is simply that the United States,
by reserving public lands, may reserve the waters appertinent
to that land — unappropriated waters and those reasonably
necessary to fulfill the purposes of the reservation.
The Petitioners say that

requires intent while

we submit that President Truman's intent is clear from the
face of the proclamation, certainly more so than -— there is
not much to — one talks about implied reservation doctrine.

67
There is certainly very little to infer with -in regard to water in President Truman’s proclamation.
^

But

the constitutional basis for the doctrine is hardly a

startling one.

It is simply the property clause of the

Constitution, giving the authority of the United States to
act under the property clause with respect to its land and
the Court in Arizona versus California held that under this
clause, and I quote, "There should be no doubt about the
power of the United States to reserve water rights for lts
reservations and its property."
That was 1963.
)

In 1971, this Court held, and I emphasize held —
this is not dictum —- in the Bagle County case that — again,
reaffirming Arizona versus California, 3aying that as we said
in that case, that Federal Government had the authority, both
before and after a state is admitted into the union, to
reserve waters for the use and benefit of federally-reserved
lands„
The federally-reserved lands include any federal
enclave -- this was Mr. Justice Douglas speaking for the

)

Court, incidentally, who is from a western state.

And he

said also that the reservation of waters may be only implied
and the amount will reflect the nature of the federal enclave.
Here, however, as I stated, there is very little,
if anything, to infer.

68

The reservation of waters — waters is mentioned —
the pool of waters and Mr. Cappaert, or Mr. Lionel, has not
really explained when he says in his brief that that pro­
clamation did not intend to reserve one single drop of
water — how you can preserve a pool of water without
intending to have water in it —?
Now, the fact that the government can reserve
water rights as a matter of federal law should hardly be
surprising.

After all, the Cappaerts are asserting a water

right against the United States.

The only difference here is

that their right supposedly arises under state law.
We are saying that federal right arises under
federal law.
None of the parties in this case, or the amici I
might add, have suggested thac the United States cannot have
water rights at all.

Rather the argument is that the United

States should submit to state law and state procedures to
establish them.
Aside from the overruling of cases that would be
necessary to get to this result, it is simply another way of
saying that there can be no United States water right in
Devil's Hole and the reason for that, it is like -—
QUESTION;

Why does that follow?

MR. RANDOLPH;

The reason for that is, like most

western states, Nevada follows a doctrine of appropriation.

69

That is a rule of capture.

You capture the water.

in time, first-come, first-served.

Priority

It requires at least two

things, a diversion of the wafer from its natural source and
application of the water diverted to a beneficial use.
We are not diverting any water in Devil's Hole.
We are seeking to preserve it ana, I might add that under the
usual doctrine of beneficial use, beneficial use is defined in
state law as application to things like irrigation, to stock
watering, industrial uses.
It was only in 1969 that Nevada amended its law,
a great movement forward, to allow beneficial use to mean
recreation.
QUESTION;

Are you suggesting that — on what

Nevada argued here today, namely that there ought to be
in soma forum the kind of balancing of all these interests,
would mean that if the Federal Government submitted to it,
the Federal Government is bound to lose?
MR. RANDOLPH:

There is no way the United States

can get a right -- a water right under state law —
QUESTION;

Well, you don't suggest, do you, that

if the United States were noticed into a Nevada water hearing
to adjudicate its rights that it wouldn’t have to appear?
MR. RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

Oh, no.

As a matter of fact —

You are just suggesting that in such a

proceeding it would be federal — your right would be

measured by federal law -—
MR. RANDOLPH:

And the resison I rely upon that is

I have heard a lot about the uncertainty — well, this
creates an uncertainty.

We don't know how much water the

Federal Government has.

We don't know the connection of

wells.
If Nevada wants to end that uncertainty, they can
do so tomorrow.

They can start a general adjudication in a

basin, that is, the Ash Meadows Basin, which would adjudicate
priorities of all the rights of the people that are involved
in this case and other people who might be involved and so
on and so forth and make it absolutely definite.

They have statutory

They can join the United States in that pro­

ceeding pursuant to the McCarran Act, but it is still a
federal right that is involved in this.
QUESTION:

And they have to recognize the right

as you define it today.
MR. RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

Absolutely.

And that would mean you were bound to

win, just as you did below.
MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes, that we have a right — we

have a water right that means that it should not be inter­
fered with to a certain extent.

Now, there is some

indication •—

Well, in point of time it just goes

back to the date of the Presidential Proclamation.

So all it takes is, something that

There is also some suggestion here that this case
would — involves groundwater, surface water.

There is a

distinction.
Reserved rights doctrine, sure, it has been
applied.
The surface water, don't apply it to groundwater.
In other words, this suggests the case would come

out differently if, instead of being fed by underground
aquifers, Devils’ Hole was fed by a surface stream that was
diverted by the Cappaarts for irrigation purposes.
There is no logical reason why the results should
be different.

In both situations the establishment of the

monument is the same and the purpose is the same, to reserve
sufficient water to preserve the pool and the pupfish in it.

QUESTION:

Well„ but it is recharged from ground-

water.
MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes, it is like a spring-fed lake,

for example.
They also say, Nevada says, that the movement of
groundwater is uncertain.

The effect of pumping from wells

might not be known for years and well-users could invest
money only to have them realize years later that they were
affecting someone else8s right, in which case they would have

to stop pumping.
QUESTION:

Hr. Randolph, may I be sure, did your

last answer to me suggest that even if the government — if
there is an affirmative here ■— that, nevertheless, a
proceeding might still be initiated to determine the extent
of the interests and whether ally vested interest back to the
date of the proclamation and so forth?
MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes, the procedure in Nevada is, it

can be done on a petition from the water-rights owners or
a petition issued —

QUESTION:

Administrative?

With the state engineer.

Yes, so it is an administrative pro­

ceeding first.
MR. RANDOLPH:

Or on the State Engineer's own

initiative, if he decides to use it.
QUESTION:

I see.

What would he do, set up a

proceeding in which again the initial —

He would determine the rights of the various pumpers and
people vis-a-vis each other — who has priority and who has a
junior right and so on and so forth.

courts and ultimately here?

Yes, sir.

Moreover, the fact of this case is that the

and Devil's Hole was shown, and shown conclusively.

As a matter of fact, in June of 1973, the

argument and I think that is adequately answered.

That is,

That is, that they have a

right as against the United States, even though they did not
come onto this property until 1967 and start pumping then.
As far as res adjudicata, which I notice is

alluded to in the brief by both parties in this case but was
raised below, if at all, only by the State of Nevada, this
decision of the State Engineer was not

respect to the United States.
The state law requires the state engineer to

75
decide this and give a permit for pumping subject to
existing rights.
This is a suit to determine whether the United
States had existing rights and the State Engineer when he
/

decided this case said — and you'll find it at the very end
of the proceedings -- this permit is given subject to
existing rights.
Indeed, the Cappaerts do not even have, according
to the record in this case, any water right protected in
Nevada now.

All they have is a permit to pump and so far as

the record shows, they have n@v©i? gone back and gotten a
certificate of appropriation which would give them a vested
right under Nevada law.
Moreover, there were only

out of the eight

wells involved in this case, there were only six -- two of
those wells were pumped and 12 after this case was begun in
1972.

They weren't even part of this proceeding before the

State Engineer.

Beyond that, the injunction applies to

We don’t think that the decision of the State

Engineer, an engineer trained in hydraulic matters, was an
adjudication of the government's right in this case.
There was one mention of a federal water right
in Devil's Hole but that was

mentioned by Mr. Cappaert's

76
counsel, not by the government and as they said in that case,
at the time the government was conducting studies to find
out the hydraulogy of the area — and I think as even the
Cappaerts counsel said, no matter what we decide in this
water proceeding now, this proceeding for a permit, those
studies will go on and there is no need to wait for them.
they did go on and six months later the United States
determined that the Cappaerts were responsible for lowering
the water level in Devil's Hole and that is why we brought
this suit.
Therefore, we suggest and we submit that th®
decision of the Court of Appeals in this case should be
affirmed.
Thank you;
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.
