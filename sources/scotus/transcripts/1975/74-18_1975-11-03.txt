MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.
ON EEHALF OF UNITED STATES ET AL
MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
These consolidated cases present a factual
variation on this Court's decision three terms ago in Conch
against the Inited States.
Couch involved enforcement of an Internal REvenue
summons seekinc to secure a taxpayer's records in the
possession of her accountant.
Hera, by contrast, we are concerned in both cases
with the accountant's own rerords reflecting his work product
in preparing tax returns for the taxpayers.
Ii each of these cases, the records were in the
accountant'J possession when tie Internal Revenue Service
special age-ts first indicated to the taxpayers that they
wished to investigate their tax returns.
In each instance, they had been in the accountant's
possessioi for ac least several yeari?

in one case dating

4
-7
-■i

bade to 19 59 and it was in both cases only 'after the initial
investigator contact between the agents and the taxpayers
i

that the taxpayers hired the attorneys who now have possession
of the records and the accountants were requested to deliver
the records to the taxpayers who then handed them over to
their attorneys,, in one instance within about five minutes and
in the other instance , 12 days.
The Internal REvenue summonses were issued shortly
thereafter to the accountants and the attorneys requesting
the records and the testimony of the accountants about the
records.

The:re are slight differences in the records

involved and the summonses in the two cases , but in both
instances, they are records from the accountants'

files,

working for the taxpayer and helping ;.o prepare his income
tax returns and compiJing other financial information for
him.
Upon refusal of the accountants and the attorney
to comply with lie summons, these enforcement proceedings
were brought and in each case,

the ?ifth Amendment privilege

against self-incrimination was asserted on behalf of the
tax-payers.
In the Third Circuit case, Fisher, the taxpayers
intervened to assert the privilege for themselves.

In the

Fifth Circuit case, Kasmir, the taxpayers* attorney sought
to assert it oi their behalf.

5

Both district courts found that the records were
still owned by the accountants and rejected the claim of
Fifth Amendment privilege on the merits and ordered
enforcement of the summons.
The district court in the Fisher case summarized
its findings on page A-7 of the Appendix to the Petition as
follows:
"The facts in the instant case as presented before
this Court demonstrate that the papers were and are the
property of the accountant.

They only left his possession

after the taxpayer learned of the investigation.

The transfer

of the papers seems to indicate that this was an attempt to
thwart the Government's investigation."
Much t.\e same coulc be said of the factual situation
in Kasmir, where :he time spai was even shorter between the
call of the special agent anc the transfer of the papers to
the taxpayer and then on to the attorney.
fhe Court of Apps als for the Third Circuit sitting
en bant affirmed the enforcement order with one judge
dis^nting.

A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth

'xrcuit reversed the enforcement order in that case, again
with one judge dissenting
Now, our start-.ng point in analyzing the problem
here is that these materials brought in the summonses would
not be subjeci to a claim of privilege against self-

6

incrimination while in the accountant's possession.

This

follows a fortiorari from the holding in Couch, which held
that even papers belonging to the taxpayer would not be
subject to a claim of the privilege while in the non-transi­
tory possession of the accountant and it also follows from
this Court’s opinion in California Bankers and other cases
holding that there is no privilege against self-incrimination
with respect to third-party records whose production is
sought from third persons.
And so the question becomes whether their transfer
to the taxpayer in these circumstances are created right to
resist their production on the ground of the privilege
against self- incrimination 'where that right otherwise would
not have existed.
And there i.s a further question which I think is a
less substantial one of whether the subsequent transfer to
the attorney affected the right: in any* way.
Ir,

the only other :ost-Co~uch case dealing With

this question, the transfer was handled the other way end
that is in the Beatty case whick we have reproduced for the
convenience of the Court in the Appendix to our reply brief
in the Kasmir case.
That is a Second Circuit decision dealing with an
almost-identical factual situation axc-pt that there they
decided to have thn records transferred from the accountant
i

7
through the attorney to the taxpayer and the taxpayer now
has them in his possession rather than the other way around.
But basically, the same issues are involved,
Now, we believe that the Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
in Beatty were correct in

rejecting the clairt. of privilege

here based on, really, two lines of cases supporting their
view.
The first are the cases dealing with what are
essentially third-party records in the possession of the
claimant of the privilege.

Those cases have in the past

involved largely organizational records such as corporate
records, labor union records, partnership records in the most
recent case.
The line of authority starts with Wilson against
the United States and goes through Wheeler, Grant, White
and, finally, Beilis, a recent decision of the Court and we
have developed those cases in our brief,
In essence, they hold that the privilege against
self-.incrimination being an intimate and personal right, may
be applied only to one's own personal papers.
QUESTION:

You are talking nov simply about a

subpoena to produce them and not testimony in connection
with them.
MN. WALLACE:

That is correct, and. resisting the

subpoena to produce the papers, those cases hold that an
individual in custody of the papers can invoke the privilege
only with respect to his own personal papers, not with respect
to other papers whose "essential character' -- is the
expression that has been used in the cases -- is non-personal,
even though they are rightfully in his possession and in
several of these cases, even though he has a claim of title
to them.
In fact, the Grant case involved a claim of
exclusive title by the sole shareholder of a dissolved
corporation.
The Beilis case also involved a claim of coownership of the record.
But because the records were not the personal
papers of the individual claimants, it was held that the
principle of the Boyd case does not apply.
It seems to us that the result reached by the
Third Circuit and Second Circuit here follows a fortiorari
from these cases and here there could not even be a claim of
ownership asserted.

In both instances the District Court

found that the papers were still owned by the accountant and
the Court of Appeals did not disturb those findings.
There was some evidence to the contrary in one of
the cases, but it was properly rejected.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, do you think the accountant

9
would be entitled to a return of those papers if he made a
demand for them?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, we think that is the law of

the states involved, yes, Mr. Justice * that —
QUESTION:

Maybe I should ask your opposition

that question.
MR. WALLACE:

—- the accountant does have a

superior proprietary claim if he should choose to assert it,
that in the absence of express contracts specifying otherwise,
the accountants* records and work papers belong to the
accountant rather than to his client.
But we don't think the criterion in these cases
really rests on whether the possession is rightful, whether
the accountant has acquiesced in the taxpayer's possession
of the records or whether he has demanded them back.

It

seems to us that under the Court's decision, the question is
whether these are the personal papers of the individual
seeking to resist producing them.
Otherwise, you get into the situation referred
to many years ago by Mr. Justice Holmes in the matter of
Harris of use of the privilege against self“incrimination as
a method of gathering evidence that could then be immunised
from legal process.
As he put it in that case, the right not to be a
wicnes..:' against, oneself is not a right to appropriate property

1.0

that may tell one’s story.
While this was said in the context of a question of
who has the superior proprietary right as between a bankrupt
and the trustee in bankruptcy, as in many of these aphorisms
by Mr. Justice Holmes, we think the legal principle cuts much
deeper and, indeed, goes to the heart of the distinction under
our system between an inquisitorial and an accusatorial
system, which is, as the Court has recognized, one of the
functions of the privilege against self-incrimination.
One of the purposes, the basic policies of the
privilege as recited in Murphy against Waterfront Commission
and other cases, is to assure that we will have an accusatorial
system of justice in which, instead of extracting incriminating
information from the accused's own lips or from the accused
himself, evidence will be gathered from other sources.
This line would become, it seems to me, irretrievab­
ly blurred if, in anticipation of valid legal process, whether
it is an Internal Revenue summons, a Grand Jury subpoena, a
trial subpoena, the person under investigation could go out
and gather up the evidence that is supposed to be used in
place of forcing incriminating
and immunize that evidence

statements from his own lips

by claiming the privilege against

self-incrimination, which changes the function.
QUESTION:

Does it make any difference if the

accountant's work papers were based on the taxpayers’ own

11
personal records?
MR. WALLACE:
because this is not a

We don't believe so, your Honor,
privileged communication between the

taxpayer and the accountant, as the Court recognized in
Couch.

We see very little difference — I mean, obviously,

the accountant's information has to be information that the
taxpayer has given him in one way or another, whether it is
verbally or in writing, so long as it is a non-privileged
disclosure, it seems to me that that information, as
requested in the accountant's records, is beyond the reach
of the taxpayer's proper scope of his privilege against self­
incrimination .
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, let's assume for the

moment that the only records involved were taxpayer's records,
for example, his checkbook.

Let's assume we were dealing

with a checkbook only, the stubs and cancelled checks, and
they were turned over to the accountant and they were the
subject of the subpoena, they were in the hands of the
accountant.

What would your position be?
MR. V7ALLACE:

Well, I doubt that we would have a

finding in these cases, then, that the record belonged to
the accountant.
QUESTION:

No, you wouldn't.

MR. WALLACE:

And if they were the taxpayer's

own papers which the Accountant had returned to the

12
taxpayer, then there would at least be a. much more substantial
basis for assertion of the claim.

Whether there would be

some impropriety because of the fact that the investigation
was already under way I think could be argued but in the
absence of that factor, it seems to me that private papers in
the hands of the taxpayer are the kind of thing that the
Boyd case is about and —
QUESTION:

But if the accountant has done nothing

but tabulate statistical data without any analysis so that
the accountant's yellow pad notes, for example, are nothing
more than an addition, perhaps, of checkstubs, would

the

mere transposition from the taxpayer's document to the yellow
pad of the accountant be controlling, without any analysis
or creative work by the accountant?
MR. WALLACE:

I would answer that yes, Mr. Justice,

just as the accountant could be put on the stand and required
to testify from his memory of what figures were disclosed
to him.
QUESTION:

don’t see any basis for resisting the testimony of the person
to whom it was disclosed in whatever form and that person can
call upon his own records —

way and immunised from proper legal process,

May I just get back to this question a

I take it if this communication were addressed

directly to the lawyer, not to the accountant and turned over
by the accountant to the lawyer, it might have a different
case?
MR. WALLACE:

There would be a question of

attorney-client privilege.
QUESTION:

No different, just, a lawyer-client

difference?
MR. WALLACE:

I think so, your Honor, although

in the privilege relationship between the taxpayer and the
lawyer, there is a basis for saying that the taxpayer retains
constructive possession of his papers turned over to the
lawyer for purposes of preparing the legal defense.
That is not a non-privileged disclosure.
It seems to us quite a different case.
The other line of authority that supports the
Third Circuit's holding here is the Hoth, Schmerber, Warden
against Hayden, Wade, Gilbert, Dionisio, Mara line of
authority, the leading case in modern times being. Schmerber,
which limits the privilege to testimonial or communicative
compulsion and the Boyd principle is described, then, in
Schmerber

as being a principle which protects responses

15
which are themselves communications.
Here the taxpayer can comply with the subpoenas
by furnishing the accountant's records without making any
incriminating disclosure in doing so.

It is up to the

accountant to make them meaningful, to authenticate them, to
verify their accuracy in some way.
They have no evidentiary significance in the
absence of that verification.
Whereas Judge Friendly analyzed

this point for

the Second Circuit in the Beatty case on page XOA of the
Appendix to our reply brief.
However, in order to bring a case of compelled
production of papers within the privilege, the process must
elicit not simply responsas which are also communications,
but communicative responses tending to incriminate.

It is

here that the taxpayers* argument breaks down.
By responding to the summons in this case, the
taxpayer would not be admitting the genuineness, correctness,
or reliability of the accountants workpapers.

He would be

admitting only his present possession of them, a fact of no
significance in a criminal trial for filing falsa returns.

What if the government directs a

significance 'would depend on how the subpoena is drafted.

MR. WALLACE:

It is

Whether the results would be

different if you were asked for the weapon you used in
committing a certain crime on a certain date or you were
asked for a revolver with a particular description known to
be in your possession for which you have a license, I don't -we don't need in this case to decide that it is two different
results, but it is certainly two different cases with
respect to the privilege.
QUESTION:

What if the counterfeiter turns the

illegal plates over to his lawyer or a murderer turns the
murder weapons over to his lawyer?

Do you find that answer

lurking in anything you have said?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, we have taken the position

with respect to these documents that turning them over to
the lawyer doesn’t increase or diminish the ability of the
taxpayer to claim the privilege.
QUESTION:

Well, there you go back to Boyd, where

the language acquitted the English judge and described papers
as "man's dearest possession.”

And you say that would not

17
necessarily apply to the counterfeit plates?
MR. WALLACE:

Not at all.

We certainly don't think

that turning them over to the lawyer would give a right to
resist their production that would not otherwise exist.
Otherwise, the lawyer would become a sanctuary for incrimina­
ting evidence, a repository

for it, a way of taking it out

of circulation and making it unavailable to legal process but
QUESTION:

A safety deposit box would be something

of a sanctuary too, would it not?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Or a safe in the man's own home.

The fact that it is a sanctuary doesn’t really -MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Well, it would be a sanctuary —

— mean it is the santuary of a person -

does it not?
MR. WALLACE:

if the privilege were extended to

immunize it from legal process such as a search warrant or
a subpoena merely because it has been given to the lawyer
so that it would be unavailable for trial or far a grand jury
proceeding or whathaveyou, that seems to us to be an
improper extension of the lawyer-client relationship — at
least with respect to documentary evidence, which is all
we have addressed here.
Turning it over to the lawyer should not create
any privilege that otherwise d..d not exist, with respect to

18
resistance to legal process we are demanding production of
the documents.
Any disclosure to the lawyer by the client would
be within the attorney-client privilege but we are dealing
here with documents that were made

prior to the beginning of

the attorney-client relationship and they reflect the nonprivileged disclosures of the taxpayer to the accountants, not
disclosures to the lawyer.
If I may, I'll reserve the balance of my time
for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. (Soodfriend.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT E. GOODFRIEND, ESQ.
ON LSHAIiF OF KASMIR BT AL
MR. GOODFRIEND;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
As we understand the Government's argument in this
fcha
case, they say t'sat the privilege is unavailable to/taxpayer
here basically for four reasox s:
Qjii} they say the taxpayer did not own these papers.
7wo, he was not the author :f them.
Three ., he did not maintain }he;m in sufficient
secrecy.

That £ rgument is not made explicitly but the

quot/.tion from the language from Couch about the expectation
of privacy is relied on.

19
$nd, finally, they rely on this doctrine which is
explained more fully by Judge Friendly in the Beatty decision,
that there is, in effect, no incriminating act of production
here and, therefore, production of the records, they say,
will not incriminate the taxpayer.
That premise, as I understand it, that theory is
based on the notion that the privilege does not protect the
writing itself but rather, the privilege, insofar as it is
applied to documentary evidence, is based upon the testimonial
act of production.
We take issue, serriatim, with each of these
arguments.
First, we say that this Court has held in Couch
and in White that ownership — that to tie the privilege to
ownership is a meaningless *— is to draw a meaningless line.
And in the White decision the Ccmrt said that the
papers and effects which the privilege protects must be the
private property of the person claiming the privilege or at
least in his possession in a purely personal capacity,
certainly admitting the possibility of the application of
the privilege to papers that are not owned by a person.
Now, before this argument, my colleague and I
investigated something that has not been heretofore
investigated at any point in this case, nanely, what is the
basis in common lav? for saying that accountants5 work papers

20

are, in fact, the property of the accountant, and I went
back and among the very few cases I was able to find was a
case, a Massachusetts case of Ipswich Mills versus Dillon,

MR. GOODFRIjIND:

Ipswich Mills versus William

Dillon, one of the few -.’ases I could find directly on the
property, the common law property concepts involved in this
case and as bast as I ctnld tell, accountants work papers
are owned by the account it because the paper upon which his
computations are made is vwned by the accoxantant before he
applies his functions or cv>plies the functions to them.
As the court there said, the. paper on which the
computations were made belt aged to them — that is, the
accountants.

They were not employed to make these sheets.

The sheets were merely the rrans by which for which the
defendants were employed mi git be accomplished.

21
The title to the work sheets remained in the
defendants after the computations were made.
In the absence of an agreement that these sheets
were to belong to the plaintiff or were to be held for it,
they were owned by the defendants, that is, the accountants.
Noxv, we submit to this Court that the Court meant
what it said in the Conch ca.se when it stated that to tie the
privilege to a concept of ownership is to draw a meaningless
line and that this fact illustrates it because the concept
of ownership, a

great Constitutional privilege, should not

turn on a question as frivolous as who owned the paper prior
to the performance of the accountant's functions, nor, we
submit, will anything be accomplished in this Court if that
ownership concept is adopted since all that will be required
to alter the outcome of any case will be a prior agreement
‘^between the client and his accountant that the work papers
will be owned by the client when the work is done.
As we understand the common-law concepts of
ownership as applicable to this situation.

Would shifting the

question of who was liable?
QUESTION:

I am just addressing myself to your

suggestion that rhis could be avoided very easily by this
contractual arrangement, bat it is not quite that simple,
perhaps.
MR. GOODFRIENI:
constitutional

I am suggesting that a great

that it is, indeed, to draw a meaningless

line, as the Court stated in Couch.

And the reason I

emphasi;e what the Court has stated is because both Judge
r.‘T

ienc3y in the Beatty decision end in the Fisher case, the

23
judges attempt to explain . away this Court3s language rather
than simply argue the Court's language back to the Court,
which the Court is in the best position to interpret.,
I tried to understand by going to the basis of
these concepts why that was, in fact, the case.
The other reason, vary quickly, why we say
ownership is not- only meaningless and an elevation of fonts
over substance but also we think very dangerous is, we pose
to the Court the situation, for example, where, let's say,
notes of a psychiatrist or notes of a priest in the
Confessional might be involved in a govermenfcal summons case,
perhaps having come back into the possession of the
parishioner or of the client.
In those situations if ownership dictates the
outcome of the privilege, there is no question that under
the common law that those papers, as they were originated,
were the property of the psychiatrist or of the priest.
Yet we suggest that the statements they contain
are essentially a blueprint of a man's mind and that they are
as entitled to the privilege as statements the man makes upon
the witness stand himself.
We move to the question of authorship.
We do not think that authorship, as this Court
has stated flatly in Wilson versu? United States, can vary
the applicability of the privilegs.
/

24
QUESTION;

X am not sure X followed you.

Were

you suggesting that the ownership should dominate over every­
thing else?
MR. GOODFRIEND:

No* I am saying* if the ownership

dominated over everything else, then in the case of the
psychiatrist’s notes or in notes that a priest might have
made about statements he heard in the Confessional, then
insofar as the Fifth Amendment is concerned, putting aside
other privileges, under the Government’s theory in these
cases, those papers would be compellable -- would be prcduceeble.

Because as they originated, they were unquestionably

the property of the third party, not the claimants.
QUESTION;

So you would put the emphasis on the

possession.
MR. GOODFRIEND;

I would put the emphasis, one, on

the possession and the testimonial compulsion, which is
unquestionably being directed to the accused in this case —
the accused and to a person in such an intimate relationship,
namely, the attorney, that it is tantamount to being directed
to the accused.
QUESTION:

What if the papers were stolen from

the attorney or by a faithless secretary to the lawyer and
given to the Treasury agent?
MR. GOODFRIEND;

Well, that — I think that is the

Burdofc ver sus McDowell case, if I am not mistaken, r __

25
QUESTION:

Close to it.

MR. GOODFRIEND:

— think this Court has

answered that question.
I would, like to address myself, if I may, before
going into authorship, since I think that is clear, to
Judge Friendly's analysis in the Beatty case, which I find
extremely troublesome and which I think will virtually end
the

if adopted — will end the application of the Fifth

Amendment to documents.
As I understand Judge Friendly’s theory -- by the
way, this theory was no way asserted in the District Court
or in the Court of Appeals in United States versus Kasmir.
QUESTION:

What would be so bad about doing away

with the Fifth Amendment as applied to documents?
MR. GOODFRIEND:
it.

Well, I think this case illustrates

As I — th€;re are many documents which reflect prior

testimonial communications, admissions, confessions of the
accused himself.

If those documents are back into his

possession and judicial process is issued to him, he is
essentially republishing, under compulsory process, his own
prior statements.
QUESTION:

Well, but if he has once let them out

they lack, cer l.ainly, some of the privacy that some of our
cases have had

rationale» Mr. Justice Rehnquist, is that, suppose I were to
exlmit that I committed a crime to a friend of mine and the
Government knew about it.

They would be able to put the

friend on the stand and have him testify, but because of
that fact, they could make me mount the stand and repeat what
I had told him previously.
In fact, I suggest to tie Court that the
expectation of privacy rationale, which the Government relies
on here, is totally misapplied in this case.

What the

Court was talking about in Couch when it was directing its
attention to the statement that there was no legitimate
expectation of privacy between the accountants and the
accused was, to Mrs. Couch's argument that, she stood in the
shoes of the accountant, therefore directing process to her
accountant, wais the same as directing process to her — that
is a very different question fron what is involved here.
Namely, there is no question that the Government
concedes that c.Lrecting process tc one's attorney is tanta­
mount to directing process to the accused.
What they are arguing instead is, if you somehow
treated these papers previously in a nwrmer inconsistent with
privacy concepts — namely, you gave then to an accountant
for purpose oi republication, portions of the information —•
then you have forfeited the privilege and we vre now
authorized tc compel you to produce documents in your

21
actual possession so privacy becomes a rationale for
authorizing or justifying testimonial compulsion directly
against the accused.
We reject that proposition.
Turning again to Judge Friendly's analysis, which
I think is critical, Judge Friendly says, in effect, that
the whole application of documents is limited to thi3 act of
production and he says in this case that the taxpayer comes
forward with the records, that there will be no incriminating
act.
VvTe submit that, first of all, under the Curcio
rationale, there is a testimonial statement with the
productions even in this case, namely, when you come forward
you state — the attorney comes forward and states — and I
think it would be binding on his client — that these are all
the records called for by the summons.
QUESTION:

Of course, Curcio was excimined at some

lenqth as to why he didn't have the records, not why he did.
MR. GOODFRIEND:

That's right.

But as I under­

stand it, the Court did say, in dicta in that case, that when
you come forward, you m?.ke a statement.
The hoLding of the case, that is correct, was
whether you could go further a:id compel him to tell you the
whereabouts of records when he had placed them elsewhere.
But who-, tne Court said there was, in that case

28

the mere act of production was not incriminating because you
will recall, there was a collective entity involved and
therefore, with respect to the act of production, there was no
incriminating statement because the collective entity in
association or partnership had no privilege»
Here, the Government has expressly taken that point
out of the case.

They say they are not arguing the collective

entity exception»
So therefore, here, when you come forward and
produce the papers and —- a natural individual — and he says,
these are all the papers called for by the summons, that is,
in fact, an identifying act and the mere fact, under Judge
Friendly‘a theory, that you can get the accountant to do that
for you is not a reason to make the accused himself do it.
QUESUON:
do it here.

Of course, you are asking a lawyer to

You are not asking the accused to do it.
MR. GOODFRIENi;:

That is correct.

Your Honor, we

would take the position cn that simply that a lawyer’s
admissions mad; in the course of a judicial proceeding, are
normally binding upon his client and the same would probably
apply here.
JUESi’ION:

How can a lawyer invoke a client’s

Fifth Amoidment privilege if it is a personal privilege
which must depend on an assertion that the thing would be
incriminating?

How can a lawyer know that?

29

MR. GOODFRIEND:

We say this.

We say that the

policy of allowing the lawyer to invoke the privilege is the
same here as it is in the case of the attorney-client pri­
vilege where the lawyer not only is allowed to invoke the
privilege, but has an affirmative duty to do so and the
reason is to promote the policy of free communication between
lawyer and client.
QUESTION:

Yet, you take a typical trial and if

your client is not a defendant, he has to mount the stand
and claim the privilege, question by question.

Most judges

won't hear of his lawyer saying, my client declines to
answer that.

It is the client that has got to make the

assertion.
MR. GOODFRIYND:

Your Honor, in this case, of

course, we are not dealing, as we were in Hoffman, with oral
statements.

We are dealing with documents,,
QUESTION:

No, but why should it be any different

with documents?
MR. GOODFtlEND:

Well, I think because, first of

all, the documents determine the. incriminating nature of the
material, but more importantly, because the — if you do not
permit the lawyer to assert this on behalf of his client, we
submit that it will chill the transfer of documents between
the 3--wyer aid his client because the lawyer will always be
■j.i

fear ir he possesses tie documents necessary to make an

30

intelligent decision on a tax-fraud investigation case,, he will
always be in fear, my God, the client may not be around
when the day comes when the Government, subpoenas these docu­
ments from me.

So X am going to make sure that whenever I

examine these documents I do it in my client's home or he
does it in my office.
Also we say, your Honor, that this is a matter
entirely within the Government’s own control.

Under their

own rules stated to this Court in Couch, they usually direct
a subpoena to the man who has the right to custody as opposed
to the man who has physical custody so the whole standing
question has been created by the person to whom the Government
chose to direct the summons,
if
Now,/they directed the summons to the client and
said, produce any records that you have or that are in
custody of your agents, there would be no standing in the ca3e.
I would like to answer a few questions, Justice.
Mr. Justice Blackmur asked the question of
-opposing counsel whether or not we thought that, the accountant
could seek return or" the papers from the taxpayer,

X would

say that that depends on the reason he is seeking return of
the papers.
If he is seeking ret.rn of the papers for his own
property purposes, as in matter of Harris, the trustee in
bankruptcy which was invested w: h title, then I think he

31

would have a good shot at it in a state court, although even
there I think the taxpayer here would have a defense,
namely, the papers were turned over expressly stated by the
accounting firm, turned over and giving the taxpayer the
rightful, indefinite and legitimate

possession of such

documents.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Goodfriend, I think

you may be cutting into your colleague's time now.
MR. ©OODFRIEND:

Okay.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Bazelon.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. BAZELON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF FISHER ET AL
MR. BAZELON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case, as the Petitioners in.
74-18 see it, is whether the taxpayer has a Fifth Amendment
right with respect to documents which are properly in his
possession in a purely personal capacity, prepared at his
personal direction, for his personal use, based entirely on
personal records supplied by him.
The record in ouv case makes very clear what the
nature of the documents rought by the Government is.
They are siuply summaries of cancelled checks and
deposit receipts of -he taxpayer.

The accountant, in preparing

this record, has s'mply transcribed information from the

32

cancelled checks end deposit receipts in no different a. way
than a

scrivener would transcribe the information from

documents that are given to him.
We submit that when a citizen makes available to a
third party personal information and that third party merely
transcribes that information, and the document containing that
transcription is given back to the citizen, that the citizen
can assert a Fifth Amendment protection if the production of
that document will incriminate him.
We believe that the 'facts in this case are very
compelling and fall squarely within the Fifth Amendment
protection.
The Government argues in this case that solely
because the taxpayer made a revelation to a third party of
highly personal material, that he in soma way forfeited his
Fifth Amendment protection.
We can see no justification in the Fifth Amendment
for such a position.

The compelled production by the tax­

payer is no less self-incriminaling and the information is no
less personal, is no less of personal nature because of

this

disclosure to a third party.
QUESTION:

Mr. Baze.'.cn, how personal are cancelled

checks, which presumably you have already sent out to a payee,
they have been paid through a hank.
like a diary, are they?

They certainly aren't

33

MR. BAZELON:

Your Honor,, they are not like a
/

diary.

They are personal in the sense that they reflect the

financial transactions and financial business of the citizen
involved and this Court has stated in the Bsllis case, for
example, that the record of a sole proprietor, business
with
record, fall /in the Fifth Amendment protection.
Certainly, we would say that a fortiorari, the
records based on cancelled checks and deposit receipts would
also fall within the Fifth Amendment protection.
We would like to speak now to the Court with
respect to the revelation of this information to an
accountant that we believe it is particularly inappropriate
in this situation to hold that this works a fourth picture
of the Fifth Amendment protection.
iln 1'ennsylvania, for example, there is a state
statute, 63 Pennsylvania Statutes Annotated, Section 9.11a,
which creates an attorney-client: privilege.
The r scord of our case make? clear that these
documents, the analysis of receipts ant: disbursements, were
held by the accountant only for a limited time in any event
and after a period of several years, tliey were regularly
returned to tra taxpayer.
This was the 25-year history of the accountanttaxpayer relationship.

The acccuntanl further made clear

and testified that he was holdirg theie papers for a

34
temporary period solely as a matter of convenience and was
holding them at the request of the taxpayer if the taxpayer
wanted them.
We also believe that the reason for the taxpayer
going to the accountant argues strongly against working a
forfeiture of the taxpayer’s Fifth Amendment rights.
It is precisely because the tax laws in this
country make it mandatory and necessary for many taxpayers
to seek third-party assistance .that the taxpayer goes to the
third party.

It is in the taxpayer’s interest and* we submit,

it is in the Government’s interest, that the taxpayers avail
themselves of assistance of qualified third parties, as the
taxpayers did in these cases, going to certified public
accountants and to hold the taxpayers who do seek this
assistance, which is important to them and to the Government,
thereby forfeit a Fifth Amendment right, we believe is very
inappropriate to the policies of the Fifth Amendment,
QUESTION:

Mr. Bazelon, would your case be any

stronger if the taxpayer had gone to a lawyer and these were
the work papers of i.he lawyer?
MR. BAZEkON:

If

he lawyer was serving, Mr. Justice

Blackmun, the same function that the accountant was serving
in this case, then I don't see why the case should be any
stronger if the lawyer perforns that work.
QUESTION:

Except that a lawyer practices law and

35

an accountant sometimes practices law* maybe.
[Laughter. 1
MR. BAZELON:

A comparison tc> the Boyd case

further substantiates our position„

The document which the

claimant in Boyd was protected against producing was an
invoice given to him by a third party.

Certainly that invoice

did not concern the personal affair of the claimant to
anywhere near the same extent as the record in this case
concerns the personal affairs of the taxpayer and those
records were not nearly as personal in terms of their history
as the records in these cases.
The Government, we believe, in their brief and in
their argument to this Court in the Couch case, has conceded
that if this accountant had been an employee of the taxpayer
or if —even if he were serving as an independent contractor
but did his work at the offices of the taxpayer and left his
records at the offices of the taxpayer, that the taxpayer
could claim a Fifth Amendment, protection with respect to
these records.
We cannot perceive any policy of the* Fifth
Amendment which is advanced by making the status and the work
conditions of the accountants determinative of the applica­
bility of the Fifth Amendment privilege.
There is no question that the -- under the
opinions of this Court the act of producing a document which

36

entails in it a representation that the documents produced
are those documents described in the summons, is a testimonial
act.

He submit that the act of production of a testimonial

force is testimonial in an additional sense as well in that it
constitutes a publication of the information which is con­
tained in the documents.
The Government says that unless the particular
communication —
QUESTION:

Then you would say a search warrant

would be equally suspect.
MR. BAZELON:

Well, your Honor, a search warrant

does not require any compulsion on the person of the —
QUESTION:

No, but it is a publication of some

testimonial materials.
MR. BAZELON:

Yes, it is, Mr. Justice White, but

not by the person who is claiming the protection with respect
QUESTION:

Well, so, are you suggesting a search

warrant could be validly used to secure these papers from
the accountant?
MR. BAZELON;
QUESTION:

am suggesting that whether —

Or from the lawyer?

MR. BAZELON:

— whether he could or not would not

justify the Government in obtaining these documents in a way
that places the taxpayer in a Position where he has to
incriminate himself.

37

QUESTION:

By the act of producing it.

MR. RAZELOH:

That's right,

The Government has argued that unless the actual
testimonial content of the act of production is incriminatory
in and of itself, there can be no satisfying of the criteria
of a testimonial act and we submit this is just not what the
law has been.

This Court has, as recently as in the case of

Maness versus Meyers, has held that where there is a
compelled testimonial response

which is part of the link of

the evidence against the accused, that the accused is entitled
to claim the Fifth Amendment protection.
The actual response of the taxpayer need, not be the
kind of incriminatory evidence that would be admissible at
the trial if it is part of the link in the chain of evidence
against him and, clearly in this case, the taxpayer, in prot

ducing the documents, is saying, these are the analyses of
'receipts and disbursements and we would even go further and
’say that the taxpayer’s implied testimony in doing that
amounts to an authentication because the history in this case
is that the taxpayer had regularly received these documents
over a 25-year period from the accountant, that is., these
analyses —■ the analysis of receipts and disbursements.
He was familiar, therefore, with the accountant's
work product and under the law of evidence in terms of
witnesses who can testify to authentication, he was in a.

38
position to authenticate those documents,
Ke was familiar with the accountants work product.
He had seen it in circumstances which would indicate the
genuineness of the past documents.

He could be a witness to

authenticate those documents.
QUESTION:

What is the incriminatory link in just

the production along the lines that you are just talking about.?
MR. BAZELONs
taxpayer

The incriminatory link is that the

is providing the Government with the information

that the papers produced by the taxpayer are, indeed, the
records transcribed from his own records by the accountant.
QUESTION:

But now, apart from the content of

those records, haw does that assertion — if it be an
assertion — tend to incriminate him at all?
MR. BAZELON:

It becomes part of the link in the

chain of evidence against the taxpayer,
QUESTION:

Well, how?

MR. BAZELON;

Because it allows — it is a state­

ment that these are thr? documents that permit the Government
that is, it is incriminatory because it gets the Government
to the next stage in the procession of evidence against the
accused, namely, to go tc the accountant

and have the

accountant come in and testify.
Now, the fact fiat the accountant may be able to
give much the same testimony in terms of identifying these

39
documents doesn't make the taxpayer’s own admission any less
incriminatory as to him,
QUESTION j

But if the subpoena simply describes a

piece of paper with a certain title on it —

says produce &

paper with a certain title on it and dated a certain date, not,
i

saying who it btslonged to or anything else, would you make
the same argument?
MR. BAZELON;

You would have a different case, no

question about it, Mr. Justice White.

I think it would have

raised the separate question of whether or not part of the
testimonial act is producing a testimonial —
QUESTION;

Whether having possession of it would

be a relevant piece of evidence.
MR. BAZELON;
QUESTION;

Well, that is always a —

Not always.

MR,, BAZELONs

That would be —

I wouldn’t- say —

Well, if that element is involved,

that is a separate item of testimony and on that score, I
would like to mention briefly part of the Second Circuit's
opinion in the Beatty case.
We believe that the Boyd case fully supports the
position ws are raking with respect to the act of production
being a testimonial response by the taxpayer.
After all, those were third-party documents and
the taxpayer, by producing them, was saying that this is the
invoice and the Government wanted that invoice to establish

40

how much glass there was in the 28 or whatever number of
cartons had been, imported.

They wanted the invoice for the

truth of the averment in the invoice.
The Second Circuit said with respect to the Boyd
case that the invoice had significance in establishing that
the claimant had received the invoice but there is nothing in
this Court’s opinion in the Boyd case that indicates that
there was any relevance whatsoever to the fact that the
claimant had received the invoice and, in fact, the Court's
opinion is quite; to the contrary.
The Court said, on the trial of the cause it
became important to show the quantity and value of the glass
contained in the 29 cases previously imported.
The only significance of that invoice was for the
truth of the statement contained therein.

Therefore, the

production of the invoice in Boyd was testimonial in exactly
the same way that production of the documents in this case
would be testimonial.
QUESTION:

What if “hey subpoenaed the original

records from the English importer, as Judge Friendly
suggested?

They could do that, couldn't they?
MR. BAZELOU:

The/ certainly could.

And there

would be no act of compulsion on the claimant in that case.
Than!; you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

41
Mr, Wallace, you have four minutes left»

Do you.

have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.
MR. WALLACE:

Very briefly*, your Honor.

The act of production here is no more incriminating
than was the act of production in Beilis or in White or
Wilson or that whole line of cases.

It is precisely the

same act of production v?ith respect to its communicative
nature.

It says, this is the file of the accountant's papers

that he placed in my custody.

Just as in Beilis, these are

the partnership records that are placed in my custody, is
the implicit communication.
It seems to me that that line of cases establishes
that production of e. third person's records, that are not
one's own personal papers, can be required of the custodian.
The fact that those records contained information
about the taxpayer's personal financial affaire is not
controlling because as I said in starting my analysis for my
argument, the records could have been required to be produced
by the accountant while they were in the accountant's
possession, even though they had this information in them.
QUESTION:

Well, that is — that just is peculiar,

then, to the facts of this case»
Would you say that you could subpoena the records
from the taxpayer?

I do want to suggest —

43
MR. WALLACE:

It is a distinction.

This is the

disclosure to the accountant and these are his papers and
they are his papers not merely because of ancient doctrines
about ownership of the

piece of paper because as the Court

recognised in Couch, the accountant has responsibilities
under the Internal Revenue laws to be able to substantiate
that he filed accurate tax returns and that he is conducting
his business in accordance with law.
But we do agree that ownership is not in itself
the governing criterion.

We think if the taxpayer had

acquired title whether by purchase

or by soma other method,,

the result would not change because these would still not be
his personal papers.

Their essential character, just as in

Grant, would remain third-parson records, even though —
