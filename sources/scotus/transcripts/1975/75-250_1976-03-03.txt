PROCE E D I N G S
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We’ll hear arguments next

in 75-250, City of Charlotte against Local 660.
You may proceed whenever you're ready, Mr. Watts.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. WATTS, ESQ*,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WATTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I am W. A. Watts.

I represent the City of Charlotte

and individual petitioners in this case.
We are her® on certiorari to review a decision of the
Court Circuit Court of Appeals0

That Court has ruled that a

municipality must grant union dues check off under the equal
protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,; or, in the
alternative, establish certain standards.
The lower courts have found that Charlotte has not
established clear and fair standards to differentiate between
the denial of dues check off or?, the

one hand, and the granting

of such withholdings from employees’ pay for such things as
Credit Union savings, insurance premiums, and contributions to
c>a charity, to name a few.
Mow, we say that by this decision the lower courts
have effectively carved out and established a substantive right,
to dues check off.

We say that’s a right that has never

existed before, because there is no right to dues check off, as

4
we see it, it has always been viewed as a privilege.

And even,

in the private sector of our economy, check off must generally
be secured by bargaining.
Nevertheless, in spite of this, the court has equated
the two, and has required some kind of standards.
I think it might be important to the Court that I
vary briefly recite the facts giving rise to this case.
During October of 1973, Local 660, International Association of
Firefighters, made up entirely of municipal firemen employees,
and five of their employee members, who are officers of the
union, brought suit in the District Court for the Western
District of North Carolina.
The allegation was that there was a deprivation of
rights under the First and Ninth Amendments and under the
equal protection and due process clauses of -the Fourteenth
Amendment.
Now, at. the time this action was brought, there were
approximately 351 dues-paying union members in the Charlotte
Fire Department.

This was

out of a total of about 543

uniform • d firemen.
The Union of course alleged in the complaint. ‘Hiat
the City's practice was arbitrary and capricious.

They

cl aims d also that denial of check off made it unable, made the
Union unable to obtain group life insurance, to obtain counsel,
and certain other things that the Union desired to do.

5

Now, on the other hand, the City contended,, and tried
to show, and we think did show, that the City had established
not standards but a policy, a policy of voluntary withholding
from employees’ pay, and the city contended that the dues
check off simply did not conform tc the policy which the City
had established,
Nov/, I might mention here that there were actually
14 items which the City permitted to be withheld.
14, 7 of the items were required by statute»

But of that

I’m thinking of

such things as income tax withholdings, and certain other
things that either the Federal or State statutes required the
City to withhold.
That loft 7 items that -the City voluntarily withheld
when they ware not. .required.

One of these was city-sponsored

.deferred ccnpans ation plan, 'that the City had established as
e fringe benefit..

And, indeed, we say all of the withholdings

were, in essence, a fringe benefit.
An insurance

insurance premiums ; and this again

was for a company that the City sponsored, as a matter of fact
the City paid part of the premiums'.

The premiums were — oh,

it was acei.de.’-health, and also life insurance.
QUESTIONs

Was that negotiated, or part of the

contract of ©vary fireman, independent of negotiation?
MR. WATTS:

It was negotiated with a private insurance

company, and the City participated in the program of giving its

s
employees tills protection,,

And that, of course., was withheld.

One of the things that the City withheld,
U, So Savings Bonds was another.

United Way contri­

butions, the one charity that was permitted, and that was
available to all employees.
Now, in spite of this, —
QUESTION: Would you say, Hr, Watts, that all of these
items, then, were available to all employees?
MR. WATTS;

Mr, Justice Blackmon, we would say that

all of these were available for all employees within a single
work unit, that is, tie fire department.
Now, as a matter of fact, the district court, found
that to be a fret? found that this was the City’s policy.

And

we don’t dispute that, we think that is a correct finding,
NOW, —

QUESTION; Supposing an employee, one of the firemen,
came in and said, "I want you to send twenty dollars out of
each monthly paycheck —* tan out of every two weeks, if they
paid that way -- to my church"?
MR,

fATTS:

Mr, Chilef Justice, we would say that that

would not be possible under the policy that the City had
established.

The reason we say that that wouldn’t be possible

~~ practical, would ba that we all know that there are many,
many churches, and you’d have to set. up some kind of a with­
holding for each church, I assume.

So that wouldn’t conform to

7

the policy,- because we all know that our firemen belong to
many; many churches# many religious organizations# many social
organizations, many fraternal organisations0
And the sola reason that the City had this policy was
so that we could grant# or the City could grant withholding as
a fringe benefit# if you will# as a convenience to its people#
but still keep it under —« in a rational, and# oh. I'd say#
within bounds»
QUESTION:

Well# Mr. Watts# what ar© the elements

in the policy to qualify?
MR» WATTS;

The only policy •■»*- the only element#

really# was that all the employees within a single unit could
participate# could participate in a specific withholding»
In. other words# -QUESTION:

I se®.

So the church thing# because of

r. "> many churches ~~
MR. WATTSj

There are so many# Your Honor# you’d have

to have so many withholdings —
QUESTION:

But United Way# on the other hand# is a

single charity.
MR, WATTS:
employees •

A single charity# available to all the

But churches are not.

You would have ~~ no telling

how many churches might be involved.
QUESTION:

Well, why a dues check off to the same

union# why wouldn’t that qualify?

8
MR6 WATTS:

Well now, there again, dues check off for

one union, it*s a ~~ it's not really — well, let's put it
this way, it’s a dues type thing.
to any organisation.

Dues were never permitted

There might fo@ many unions involved,

just as there might ba many churches.
would not conform to -the policy.

And ws would say that

It wasn’t available to all

•the people within the work unit.
QUESTION: Well, do you take the position that the
City, as the employer, can establish the categories with or
without good reason and say, These are toe categories we will
deduct, and we will check off non® other than these?
MR. WATTS:

Yes, Your Honor, we would say that that

is a natter of policy that the City Council might — might
QUESTION;

»

Well, that’s the precise issue in this

case, isn’t it?
MR. WATTS:

This really is the issue.

Is it

necessary to classify, in this situation?
Tow. wa would contend that it might be necessary to
classify if things war© the same.

But the next point I’d like

to make to this Court is simply this —
QUESTION:

Mr. Watts, before you go on to that, *»-

MR. WATTS:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

— you referred a moment ago to the district

court’s opinion, and I notice that the district court, in its
opinion, at pags A-13 of your Petition, commented that "Desire

9
to discourage municipal labor organisations would of course b©
an impermissible reason for refusing to withhold moneys,,”
Do you have any idea why he said that?
MR. WATTS:
question this ways

Your Honor* I can only answer your
If you will notice* the only citation that

the district court or* for that matter* the Fourth Circuit,
talked about was the Virginia case that involved segregation.
And the impermissible objective of bringing about ~ or denying
integration.
Now* for that reason* it would appear that the
district court believed that the City attempted to discourage
the union.
QUESTXOHs

Well* certainly ‘the State of North

Carolina attempts to discourage municipal labor unions by its
statute.

Is that an impermissible purpose for -the State of

North Carolina?
MR. WATTSs

Your Honor* we would say not.

We litigated

that case sore.:: -duraa ago in a three-judge court* and tills was
upheld* this statute was upheld.
QUESTION % Which statute?
MR. WATTS:

It’s 95-98.

No* no* the — yes* sir*

95-98.
QUESTION: And what dees it provide?
MR. WATTS:

It provides in essence that because of

policy a municipality may not enter into collective bargaining

10
contracts with a union.
And that. Your Honor, was upheld for what it*s worth
by a lower court'*

And we believe that it is a permissible

type legislation.*
Now, getting back to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question
here, there is not one scintilla of evidence in this record
that the City has ever attempted to discourage unions, other
than the statutes which control the City*
QUESTION: Well, what if there was?
MR* WATTS:

What if there was?

I think it would males really no

difference, whan you get right down to it, unless the City
would go sc far as to discourage — as to make it impossible
for the union to operate»
QUESTION; Well, what if they forbade it by law?
MR* WATTSt

Forbade people belonging to the union?

QUESTION:

Municipal employees from

MR, WATTS;

I think we could not do 'that, Your Honor*

I think that municipal employees now have a right to belong to
unions *
QUESTION:
MR, WATTS;

Under what case of this Court?
That's Atkins v* City of Charlotte»

That was decided in the — in the Fourth Circuit, it was a
tlrae *» j udga co urt«
QUESTION: We.ll, that's not a case from this Court.
MR. WATTS;

It if* net s: case from this Court, Your

11
Honor, it's a case from the lower court, and I'll only mention
that to you, in citing-it, as a reason for my belief that
municipal employees may belong to a union,
QUESTION; Do you get your constitutional beliefs from
every three-judge district court that happens to hand down a
decision around the country?
QUESTION:

I suppose you gat them from the

Constitution, and your answer would be ~

MR. WATTS;
That is correct.

Well, that is correct, yes, Your Honor.

That is correct, Your Honor.

I think that it’s fairly well established now that
employees, municipal employees do have a right to belong to
unions.

But they have no right to dues check off.

That's the

point I want to make.
QUESTION;

I suppose, if the Atkins case — while the

Atkins case, remains cm the books, the municipalities within the
reach of the Fourth Circuit are bound by it?
MR. WATTS:

Your Honor, we would feel bound by that

c : rinion. We don't dispute the decision.
QUESTION;
MR. WATTS:

Until and unless we overrule it.
Unless, Your Honor, this Court should

overrule it, and then of course we’d be bound by that.
But at fchs present time we would not contest the
fact that any of our municipal employees may belong to unions,
»3 think they have that right.

We think they have a right to

12

join, to conduct union business, to do everythings

But we

think there5 & no affirmative duty on the part of the City to
deduct their dues for them»
QUESTION;

Or to aid the Union in any other way?

MRo WATTS;

Well, I tliink that's righto This is an

affirmative type thingc

We have me right to -- we have no

requirement to do thato

But we certainly would not attempt,

in any way, to keep the union from operating, to keep our
employees from joining, or to keep them from meeting together
or doing anything that a union normally does#

That's my

contention, Your Honor#
Now, going on just for a moment —* if -that answers
your questions right now

our first contention her® is that

this case is really not an equal protection case, when you
gat right down to it#
Check off of union dues, on its face, is so different
from the ether items that the City withheld that they're not
in the same classification, they're not in the same ballpark,
they are very, very different# And we think that the question
of classification isn't raised at all#
QUESTION; Well, even if they were the same kind of
item as the* other items, would it be an equal protection case,
as long as you treat all your employees the same?
MR. WATTS;
Your Honor.

We think not, Your Honor.

We think not,

But we think that clearly, in this case, for the

13
reasons that. I*m going to try to mention to you, we think that
it*s not an equal protection case, because there*s no classifi­
cation,

That's our contention»
Let's think for just a moment at the differences

between union duos ch-sck off on the one hand, and, for instanceCredit Onion savings

n the other.

To begin with, check off is for the benefit of the
union.

It's a matter of union security.

There's a long, long

history of unionism in 'the United States, and the fact, -that
union dues check off is very important to the union as a matter
of security.

It enables their dues to be readily collected.

Now, that i;3 the first difference that I can think
of, and that's a very big difference.

Another thing, another

difference that I would point out to the Court is that
historically and practically check off is a matter of employeremployee relations.

That's another difference.

Totally

different from anything else that the City has checked off
under its policy.
Generally speaking, also, as a difference, union dues
cheer, off it part of the collective bargaining process.

That

is another di£feranee„
It's also different in North Carolina cities t because
the City is prohibited by State statute from entering into
collective bargaining contracts, and we say —
QUESTION:

ih:*„ tfatts, it seems to me that you're

14

arguing that the classification is reasonable, rather than
arguing that it's not an equal protection case»
MR* WATTS:

Your Honor, I'ra just arguing that it's

not even a classification question, because it*s so dissimilar*
In other words, duos check off is so dissimilar from anything
else that you just don’t have to classify it.
nd orangeso

It’s like apples

Yea might classify apples, if you want, as good,

bad, or indifferent, or some way, rad, yellow? but you wouldn’t
classify apples and oranges*

They are different things*

That, in and of itself, is a classification, arid w©
say 'that union dues check off is in a class by itself*
QUESTION: Well, as I understood you, in answering my
earlier question, Mr* Watts, you said, in any event there’s a
policy,
M* WATTS:

There is a policy, Your Honor*

QUESTION:

And a key element of the policy is that

the City is not going to pay at the request of employees to
cay except that which is a single organization, beyond, in any
event, that which by statute you’re compelled to check off,
income taxes and so on*
Ml* WATTS;

That’s correct* Your Honor, that is. a

policy*
QUESTION; And that, you uniformly apply that policy
MR* WATTS:
QUESTION:

We say it is, Your Honor*
*— uniformly apply it because you say you

15
won’t check off for individual churches or for individual
clubs, social clubs, because that’s outside the policy of
requiring a single recipient,,
MR» WATTS:

That is correct. Your Honor»

QUESTION:

And that you apply that uniformly»

MR, WATTS: That is what we say, Your Honor»
QUESTION; And you won’t do it here because there
may be more than ona union»
MR» WATTS: There, may be more than on© union, and
thera may la simply members of the fireman who are not —
QUESTION: Even if there is only one union, what does
that have to do with the City's rights to say they will check
off this and they will not check off for that?
MR» WATTS:

We say that this is entirely discretionary,

it’s a matter of policy. We think -there is some; place where a
municipal governing body must have a right to govern»
QUESTION: Well, Mr» Watts, if your equal protection
argument is answered by the answer you've given me, you don't
have to reach the second question.
Nil. WATTS:

You don’t, really? no, you don't, Your

Honor.
But we say it’s there, and we think that the Court
might be aware of it.

But it’s just not a question of classifi­

cation, although certainly you don't have to reach it.
Now, we might even go on a little step further than

16
th at o
We say that in any event that the city has established
a. rational basis„

Quite simply,, the City has a purpose, a

very valid purpose, in trying to limit the number of items
withheld, and -that simply is that the thing can become totally
out of hand, you get so many that it*s an administrative
burden„
Yes, Your Honor?
QUESTIONs And there's no takehoine pay at all*
MR» WATTS:
QUESTION:

Well, that's right»

It can be just

You have 14 categories you already

withhold?
MR» WATTS; We have 14, but 7 of -those, only 7 of
them, are voluntary,
QUESTION; There can't be much left of the paycheck
if you take out all 14,
MR, WATTSs

If everybody participated, this might

well be true, Your Honor»
In any event, we think that it is certainly a
permissible and a valid objective that the City has to limit,
to permit certain withholding and to limit others, to limit
numbers.

We think that we have done it in about as good a

•way as we could do it, as the City has.
l:owe the ~~ my honorable opponent here has said,

“Well, whet yea might. do* — in his brief, I believe, he said,

17
"You might have some sort of a vote or other in a department#
and if a majority of the people say that they want something
withheld, you might, grant that."
But we would respectfully urge this Court that the
City Council and ths City governing body is the one that has to
determine theses things.

And the fact that there might be some

other way of doing the same thing, of Ural ting the number of
withholdings# that doesn't make any difference, because it is
a policy matter for the City.
And we say that the Council must, be permitted to
govern.
Nov/, I might mention one or two things, too.

X

would, of course, hesitate to cite district court cases to this
Court.

However, this very case her®, Local 660,

has been

considered by two district courts that I can think of.
In Stxojny v. RousaSci^, the district court for 'the
Southern District of Georgia considered this case and commented
on it in the decision.

Specifically the court there, the

district court, declined to follow Legal 660 for many of -the
reasons that I have just enumerated to you.
It was cited —» this

case was considered also by the

district court in the Northern District of Alabama, and in
that case again the district court refused to follow the
reasoning of Local 661,, saying, among other -things, that if
*— that ttiis would grant a right to municipal employees that

18
was not available to even private employees# because private
employees have to bargain for things»
So# for these reasons., we say that this is an intrusion
on the right of a City to govern itself.
Of course, it’s easy to argue# well# the district
court has left you an out# all you have to do is make out sortie
kind of standard»
Bute Your Honors, what better standard is them than .
the standard which the City has, a standard which treats
everyone alike under the Constitution?

We believe that the

City Council should ba permitted to govern in this case.
Thank you, if there's no ether questions,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Watts.

Mr. Wallas.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN WALLAS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. WALLAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
Plaintiffs feel that it's important at the outset
is erphssi::u the narrow scope of the district court order,
which is now the subject of review in this Court.
Thu limiting injunction issued by the district
court reads as follows;
"So Isug s.s the defendants continue," “*»
QUESTION;

What page is that, in the Appendix?

QUESTION;
MR* WALLAS:

I have it now*
The very lest page, I believe*

In paragraph 4*

That reads as follows;

"So long as the defendants continue, without clearly
stated and fair standards, to withhold moneys from the paychecks
of City employees for other purposes, organizations and
entities net specifically required by law, the defendants,
their agents, successors, employees and any persons acting in
conce rt with the defendants or at their direction ar© enjoined
from refusing to withhold moneys . from the paychecks of -the
individual plaintiffs to be paid to Local 660,"

Would that fcs satisfied if the

explicit.

That would be clear and

But must it be —
MR. WALLAS;

Your Honor, the reason that that would

not satisfy it is because it would be a violat,ion of the equal
protection clause.

Contrary

QUESTION: And what’s your basic authority for that?
MR, WALLAS;

Your Honor, if I may start out by

20
answering that question this ways

Contrary to what Mr. Watts

has asserted in the Court, today * that is, that the standard
that the City -- the policy that the City uses is a policy to
allow all employees in a unit any deduction »*- to allow a
deduction where all the employees in a unit can participate.
Now* that —
QUESTION:
MR. WALLAS:

To a single- recipient.
Yes, sir.

Mow, that was the policy that Mr. Watts is asserting
here today, and he is saying it is a policy that the City has
adopted and has followed.
Now, if you will look at page 2 of the Petition, you
will sea that she first question, which was addressed to this
Court, reads:
BHava petitioners, by following a policy of allowing
only payroll withholdings which benefit all of its employees,
established a rational basis for” et cetera.
Mow, the reason that’s important is that the district
court in this case found, on page A-10, that the practice had
bean to allow those deductions which were available to all
City employees; that would be employees of all the departments
in the. City, or those programs that were available to employees
within a single department.
Department, for example.

And that would be the Fire

To allow deductions that were

available in those circumstances.

21
And since the deduction that we request, that is,
reduction for union dues, is available to all employees within
the Fire Department» then the court said, Well, you can't deny
-tiiis deduction, that is, the deduction that happens to run into
a labor organisation, while you are allowing other deductions
that only run into — only to benefit people in a particular
department»
QUESTIONs

But I thought Mr» Watts said that the

— the constituency of the Fire Department is 500-odd, is it?
QUESTION:
QUESTION:
MR. WALLAS:

350-3orae.
About 350 union members.
Well, Your Honor, but the point is that

that is the number of members of the Fire Department that have
decided to join the union as —
QUESTION: Well, I know, but suppose some of the others
wanted to join a. different union?
MR» WALLAS: Wall, that would be a possibility.
QUESTION: Well, if that happened, than the check off
would violate the policy
MR. WALLAS;
QUESTION:

But — but —
■— against allowing it, except where

available to all employees to a single recipient, wouldn’t it?
MR. WALLAS:

It would be available.

This union,

Local 660, is available to all the employees.
QUESTION: Wall, so is the Methodist Church, presumably8

22
MRo WALLAS:
QUESTIONS

That’s correct# Your Honor»
But you wouldn’t suggest that if people

come in and ask that something be withheld out of their paycheck
for the Methodist Church# or fox” the Fraternal Order of Elks#
for that matter# that the City would be obliged to deduct it
because it deducts other tilings like it has don©?
MR» WALLAS:

Your Honor# I think that under *— that,

that would not ba required by this order# and that’s why I
read the order right now»

I think that what the City has to

do is simply establish some reasonable standards# to apply to
every —
QUESTION: Well# let me ask you a question about that
order.

Because I noticed# as you read# as you read from it,

that you seemed to put soma stress# and perhaps Judge McMillan
did# too:
"So long as the defendants continue# without clearly
stated and fair standards'* — what is it in the equal protection
clause that requires wclearly stated and fair standards”?
MR» WALLAS:

I think what the judge is saying tliero#

that the City has to establish a rational basis for their
actions# a rational basis furthering a legitimate State goal»
I doii’t think he means anything other than that»
QUESTION:

Well# you mean# then# that the City# in

deciding perhaps on & somewhat shooting- from-the-hip basis
what to check# what to permit check off and what not# must

23
adopt a policy to justify its various decisions that would
presumably support a court tipholding it?
MR, WALLASs

I think that on this record they are

required, because they ■— on this record they did not do what
they ~~ their practice was not what, their policy was.
At the beginning of the litigation we filed some
Interrogatories, and Interrogatory No, 4 — in Interrogatory
No, 4 we asked the City to state the criteria which they used
to decide which withholding to allow and which withholding
not to allow.
And when they answered that Interrogatory on page 14
of the Appendix, they didn’t set forth any criteria, they just
said, "This is what we do,"
Later on in the litigation, in an affidavit fill'd
by the City Manager and an affidavit filed by the Personnel
Director, they said, “Our policy is to allow those deductions
\
which every employee within the City can avail themself of,”
And Judge McMillan then looked at those things that they
actually allowed, that is, those deductions of the 14, and w©
argued to the .court, and it's obvious from the record, from the
Answers to the Interrogatories, that there were certain
deductions that could only *-« that were allowed that only
employees of a certain department could benefit from.
And our argument to the court was, Well, if that’s
really the practice of the City, what they do, then w@ think w®

24
should ha able to avail ourselves of that benefit*"
QUESTION:

But, Mr* Wallas, suppose the 350 firemen

said they wanted to give their money to the First Methodist
Church of Charlotte, and the others said no?
MR» WALLAS;

Your Honor, I think — the reason that

I read the order that I did was —
QUESTION: Wall, I raaan, obviously that would be
within the guidelines, and they wouldn't allow it, would they?
MR* WALLAS:

They would not alloy; that*

I think Mr*

Watts made it clear that they would not allow that deduction*
QUESTION; And the difference between that and this
case is what?
MR. WALLAS:
sure there is

The difference in that case —* I'm not

difference in that case»

QUESTION:
MR* WALLAS:
QUESTION:

But the point is

Well, you said that one was all right*
Pardon me, Your Honor?
You said if they all want to give it to

the Hathodist Church, but it wasn't the whole bunch, it was
just a percentage of them, you wouldn't — it would be all
right for them to deny it.
MR. WALLAS:

I think that they are free to develop

some standards where they could deny that type of deduction*
They are also free to

they are probably free to develop

some standards where our deduction would be allowed — dis­

allowed

25
QUESTIONS why do they have to develop any standards
at all?

It seems to me that if they come in and recite the

history of what they've done and Judge McMillan says, ”In fact
you’re not telling the truth; it's not what you say you’ve
done- this is what you’ve really done."5

He’s got a right to

measure what they really have done against the demands of the
equal protection clause.
But I don’t see anything in the equal protection
clause that requires the announcement or promulgation of
standards in order to make it easier or harder to attack the
thing in court,
MR. WALLAS* Well, Your Honor, like I say, I think
that’s really saying you’ve got to establish a rational
basis for your action?.

The court is saying. What the evidence

in this case shows is that you’re saying ~~ as Your Honor
r '.dots out

you* re saying one thing and doing another.

And that’s just; not permissible, because what you’re
doing or may be doing is letting the benefits of withholding,
which is simply the use of the City's computer in this case,
to flow to certain organizations and entities, while
prohibiting that flow to this union.
QUESTIONs But then you say, it seems to me, that
what you have done in practice violates the equal protection
clausa because it’s totally irrational and there’s no rational
basis for justifying the distinction.

1

26
You don't say that until you promulgate clear
standards what you've dors® violates the equal protection clause0
MR0 WALLAS: Well, what the court is saying is that
until you change your practice# then you're in violation -«
then you must do this,
QUESTIONz
give us

Yes# but what if th© court, says# Look# you

you've given a reason for this —- for distinguishing

between check offs for unions and others, but that reason is
a very bad reason? it’s unacceptable*

But we can think of a

vary good one# the court says? for ex ample# you just don't
want to encourage unions*
Now# whether you think sc or not# that’s# as far as
the :;ourt is concerned# that's a perfectly justifiable reason.
Now, maybe you don’t think you're following it# but, neverthe­
less# we can't strike it down, because we can imagine a basis
for this classification.
MR, WALLASs

Your Honor# I would concede that, the

City of Charlotte can discourage unions, par se.

What they

cannot do is violate the equal protection clause in doing that.
QUESTION: Wall, I know, but they say, The reason we
don't check off for unions is that we do not want to help
unions,
MR. WALLAS:
QUESTION:
MR. WALLAS:

Well, —
And that checking off dues helps unions.
Well# that, Your Honor# I -think is

singling out an unfavored group for

benefits
QUESTION;

But you can't say -there isn't a rational

basis for it, you may say it’s an unconstitutional basis? ~«"
MR. WALLAS:

Righto

QUESTION;

» but it's pretty rational, isn’t it?

MR.WALLASs

Absolutely,,

It may very well be rational,

Is this a rational -- that

QUESTION;

All right, or a legitimate.

down to the legitimate end.

Now, you're

You think the City must help the

union by checking off, or it will violate the First Amendment?
MR. WALLAS:

Your Honor, we don't think you have to

reach that question in this cases.
QUESTION: Well, you do.

We just were there.

We just,

reached it a minute ago.
MR. WALLAS:

Well, Your Honor, most, of the equal

protection cases involved — or a lot of the equal protection
?

caser in this ca-a-s?., like the Moqley case, the Emumoto case,
Involved,First Amendment freedoms are involved, but you take,
for example, Mosley.

Now, that case could not be decided —

or would net have been decided in favor of the plaintiff in
that case, as I understand Justice Marshall's opinion, without
the equal protection clause.
That, is, this Court has clearly said that picketing

28
can be limited by time, place, and manner — reasonable time,
placa, and manner rules»

And in that case there was a rule®

As l recall, only union picketing was allowed»

And tills

Court said, Well, you just can't — you can't allow picketing
for one group and not; allow picketing for other groups? it
was an equal protection argument.
And that's ‘the argument we're making here,
QUESTIONs But you're comparing unions with bend
purchases and insurance premiums•

You would have a much

stronger case on ©quail protection, as I see it, if there was
a so-called house union, a company union, unaffiliated with
any other union, and 150 men in 'the Fire Department belonged to
that, group, and 350 belonged to this union of yours, and they
allowed the check off for the one union but not the other.
Than you might have an equal protection case.
But you’re undertaking to compare union check off
with bond purchases end insurance premiums,

MR, DALLAS:

2 think what we'ra comparing is the

fact, that certain benefits are flowing in different areas.
Now, I would

the benefits flow to seven different

organisations or groups of employees who happen to opt for
*

i deductions. And under the policy of the City, that Mr,

Watts, in his argument, said is their policy, that is that all
— if an option is available to all City employees, then the
City will avail them? well, our option is the same. And we

23

think that those employees within the Fire Department, who want
benefits to flow to their union — all it is is a simple
computer operatione.

I think the district court's opinion and

the record makes it clear that this is not —» we’re not asking
to burden the City —
QUESTION;

Now, there’s only your union there now,

but suppose, as the Chief Justice has suggested, that some of
the other firemen organize another union, and then they want
to have the check off to their union.
MR. WALLAS;
QUESTION:

And —

The City is ~
No --is not the City then in a position

where it has to violate its policy which, as I understand it,
is to permit check off only where there’s a single recipient?
In other words, yon. make a contract with an insurance company
for group insurance premiums, and you pay it to a single
insurance company. All employees who take advantage of it, if
they want to, pay it to a single insurance company,
Eut where you've got two unions, that's not the
situation, is it?
MR. WALLAS; Well, I don’t understand —
QUESTION: Well, isn't that what the situation here
is?
MR. WALLAS;

Well, the City — again, Your Honor, the

reason I read the injunction that I did, the City is free to
adopt a policy -that may make it. —

30

QUESTION:

No* but I thought you agreed earlier --

perhaps I misunderstood you — with what Mr, Watts has told usc
Namely* that the key to their check off policy is that there
may be* as to all participating employees* a payment to a

case may be.

MR. WALLAS;

Well* ~-

QUESTION: And isn’t that what you pointed out to us
that the district court found to be the policy?

QUESTION:
MR. WALLAS:
QUESTION:
MRo WALLAS:

Does the City bargain with the union?
No, sir.
It may not.
It may not bargain —
If. may not?
Well, the law ~~ the statute says they

ivy net enter into a collective bargaining contract or agr-sansant.
QUESTION: But the union may talk to the City about
working conditions?
MR. WALLAS;

There’s nothing in the statute to

prohibit that. Your Honor.
QUESTION: And it does.
MR. WALLAS *

I think — at least at some point

there’s nothing in the record about that.

It is my under**

33

standing, is that; the city will talk to an employee as an
employee, but refuses, really, to talk to an officer of the
union as an officer of the union. That is, if I’m the president
of the union and I want to come in and represent my union,
the City will say, "Corns on in and we’ll talk to you as an
employee.w
QUESTION: Well, they must have talked in ‘this case,
as a union, but

.

MR. WALLAS: Well, 1 think we presented a request,
and it was denied? in that sens®, there was a colloquy (?)
if that’s considered acceptable,

, Mr. Justice White.

QUESTION: Was that within the exception, that the
poraon presenting it was an employes of the Fire Department?
A union officer who was also employed, as distinguished from
a bargaining agent who didn't work for -the City?
MR. WALLAS: Well, the individual employees in this
case have presented it as an individual — both as individuals

officers of the union.

QUESTION;
MR. WALLAS;

I think that covers it.
We would contend that tills case, us I

said before, fits the traditional equal protection mold.
That is, that just as the City doss not have to build a muni­
cipal auditorium, it. does not have to creat® a public park, it

34
does not have to necessarily allow the use of their computer
to hand out? or to allow withholding.
But once it does», it can't discriminate against
certain unfavored groups in favor of certain favored groups,
QUESTION: Well? what if the City — what if some of
the firemen wanted to ask their Elks dues be checked off? and
made the same argument your people do? that anybody in this
town can join -’die Elks? and the City says? No? it’s just
sufficiently different from these other kind of things we*re
checking off? we won't do it.
Do you think the Elks could come in and males the same
claim your people have?
MR, WALLASi

Yes? I think they might ba able to.

But I think that the importance —
QUESTION: Does that bother you at all?
MR, WALLAS: It doesn't bother me? because the district
court order makes it absolutely clear? and the Court of Appeals
order makes it doubly clear? reinforces the district court
order? that the City can establish sort© guidelines? soma
standards? and apply them equally to everybody? and as long as
it does that? and there's some rational basis furthering some

MR. WALLASs

I think that under their present

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN WALLAS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS - Resumed
MR. WALLAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
I'd like to address myself now to the question ’that
Mr. Justice Brennan was asking.

Assuming, Mr. Justice, that

the policy is the on© that you have set forth — and again 1
would contend that the policy is not that — but assuming that
the policy is to allow only one charity deduction and only
one insurance company deduction, we would contend that wa fall
within that policy.

Local 660 is the only union that has

come forward -inc. said that it was willing to represent these
firemen.
We are open to all firemen.

In that sens©, wa

contend that wa are within the policy, as we understand it,
the policy being that as long as an organisation is open to
all •■•..va-.b&rs ca particular department, then you1 re within the
policy.
QUESTION;

Mr. Wallas, -the equal protection clause,

of course, reads that no person,

shall be denied the equal

Now, this is not a law, it's not a

37
regulation,,

In fact, your argument, I take it, is almost that

it was a non-policy, it was just a series of very random
decisions that may or may not be rationally justified,,
Does any -*» every single governmental decision of that
sort come within the equal protection ban?
MR» WALLAS;

Your Honor, I don’t knew if I can

address myself to every single — to your question and say —and state affirmatively that every single decision that is
made by a governmental body falls within that®
What we're saying here, and what I understand the
City has asserted, is that they have unfettered discretion
to decide whica withholdings to allow, and which withholdings
not to allow*
Because they have a policy within which we fall- and
yet they say, We’re not going to allow your deductions»
QUESTION:

What is the City claimed it had an

unfettered right to schedule meetings with various employe®
groups at any time of the day it wanted to, and it invariably
scheduled meetings with non-union groups, say, in the middle
of tea afternoon and invariably scheduled the meetings with
the union groups at 7:30 in the morning»

Is that the kind of

governmental action that, if you could show it was discrimina­
tory, would invoke the equal protection clause?
Cr ia thura soma threshold below which the courts
just don't inquire?

38
MR« WALLAS:

I don’t knew where the line is®

Thera

may be a threshold below which the courts inquire, but don’t
have to •»» don’t have to inquire®

But it seams that if the

City in that instance was making its — designing its policy
to treat union members as union members in one way, and every­
one else in another way, that that would fall —

would have a

policy that would have to fall under the equal protection
clause ®
QUESTION:

Let m@ try another hypothetical®

Suppose it was a general practice, without being formalised in
any standards, for the City of Charlotte to allov? -Hie firemen
in the Fir?

Department to have social gatherings of their

social organisation of firemen in a public place®

And then

the union ciaiaends the same kind of facility for union meetings•
The City answers,"No, w.e don't want to encourage or help your
union •**

They put it right, cn top of the table®

"We don’t

want to encourage your union or any union, and you can’t have

Your Honor, I think — you said a social

gathering of serna Firs Department employees on the on® hand,

QUESTION:

To which all Firs Department employees

are involved®

— and then a business meeting of the

the type of meeting that you're having —
QUESTION: Wall, make it a social gathering of the

ME» WALLAS:

Okay.

If you make it a social gathering

of the union, then I would say that denying that to the union#
because it's the union, would be a violation of the equal
protection clause.

Similarly in this case ■—
?
QUESTION:
Numotco is not an equal protection case,
was it?
MR. WALLAS:

I bel? we it was, Your Honor.

I believe

it was — it was a First Amendment case.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. WALLAS:

But I believe the equal protection

clause# just as Justice

it’s one of the cases that Justice

Marshall relied on in Mosley.
QUESTION:
MR. WALLAS:
QUESTION:

Mora like Mosley v. Chicago.
Yes, sir.
And maybe it was both.

40

MRo WALLAS i

I believe it was both»

That's my pointy is that there are First Amendment
rights that may exist# but this Court in many cases has said
that these rights are not — that there are limitations on
these rights, and when limitations are imposed, the equal
protection clause comes in to make sure that they are not
imposed in a discriminatory way»
Our contention is that the City's position that they
have the unfettered right to deny the withholding benefit to
the plaintiffs in this case is a violation of the equal
p rotection clause,
The court below did not say — and 1 think this is
important? in fact it specifically says to the contrary
it does not say that a dues check off is an absolute right,
that there’s any par se right to check off»

The check off

only is required in this case on -this record, because we fall
within the policy that the City has been following consistently*
And importantly, as I tried to emphasize at the
initial part of my argument, the City is free if
QUE5TI0N: Would your argument fail if there were a
rational basis for an exception from the policy?
MR„ WALLAS;

1 think it would, Your Honor, and «—

QUESTION: Well, what about Mr* Justice White’s question
that

is it a rational basis for the City- to say they don’t

want to encourage'unions?

41
MR. WALLASs
QUESTION%

I think not, Your Honor.
That’s not a rational — that's

irrational.
MR. WALLAS:

I ‘think — I may have misunderstood

on© of the Chief Justice's questions, X 'think he may hava
asked me — I’m not sure whether the State could legislate
and say, "We’re going to allow all withholdings except those
that go to a union, becaij.se we're opposed to unions."
And I think that falls right in with the equal protection
analysis that we've tried to present here.
QUESTION:

Is it because it's irrational?

Or

because you nsad a compelling State interest to make that
exception?
Which is your position?
MR. WALLAS:

Because it would be illegitimately

attacking this union because it was an unfavored group.
Then we would be talking more about the First
Amendment question that Justice White raised.
QUESTION:

In other words, it would be so illegiti­

mate it couldn't be done, no matter what the reason, is what
you’re saying?
MR.WALLAS: Well, we would bs then in this Court
invoking the First Amendment right

of association, which was

invoked in the Atkins case, to attack the sister statute of
95-98? that is, 95-97, which made it a criminal offense- for a

42

fireman to be a member of a union. And that %/as attacked in
the Atkins case, and that? of course, failed on •*-•«* fell on
First Amendment grounds .
And I -think that the statute or 'the policy would
also have to fall on First Amendment grounds,, if the union was
picked out as one group. and all other groups ware allowed
withholding.
If there are. no other questions?
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Vary well.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Watts?
MR. WATTS:
