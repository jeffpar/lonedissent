ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS A. FORAN,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. FORAN;
Court;

Mr. Chief Justic®, and may it pleas© the

This case involves an alleged violation of the First

Amendment right of political association

of four public

employees —they were process servers and court attendants —
in the office of the Sheriff of Cook County whom I argue in
behalf of, incident to discharges or threat of discharge for
political considerations or more commonly described as so-called
patronage practice requesting political sponsorship for either
appointment to certain public jobs or to continue in employment
in public jobs.
In this particular case the plaintiffs below, or the
respondents here, were employees of the Sheriff's office in
December 1970 when an incumbent Republican was replaced by
the Democrat Elrod who was elected the prior month.

The

plaintiffs were not in job categories, like some others in the
Sheriff's office, which were protected by civil service or
other nonpolitical or merit system of job category.

They were

not protected in any way by contract or agreement or legislation

4
against summary discharge»
Th@ plaintiffs stated in their case that they are
Republican, and that they originally obtained their jobs in the
Sheriff's office by having Republican sponsorship

by

Republican officials in order to be employed by the Republican
sheriff„
QUESTIONi
MR. FORAN:

They stated that in their complaint?
Yes, sir, they did.

They aliogad that they were discharged because they
were Republicans and could not or would not obtain Democratic
sponsorship to continue on their jobs.
Now, in tfc® complaint there are a number of
allegations concerning a practice of discharging non-civil
service employees in Cook County by the Sheriff's office on
the assumption that a sheriff of a different political party
would discharge any employee who didn't pledge allegiance to
the party of the new sheriff, who didn't agree to work for
the party and candidates of the party of the new sheriff,
would not contribute a portion of their wages to the party of
the new sheriff, or would not obtain political sponsorship
by the new sheriff’s party.
Now, neither the complaint nor the affidavits in this
case allege that these four respondents were required or that
they were even told that they might be required to meet any
of the conditions that were set forth as a practice other than

5

tills political sponsorship condition»
I might add that the respondents her® have referred
the Court to a stipulation of fact by* the sheriff and the
Sheriff8s Office in a companion cas®, the Shakman case, also
out of the Seventh Circuit.

We do not object to that statement

of facts of the operation of the Sheriff’s Office.

We feel

that it doss fairly state what the factual situation is in
tiie Sheriff’s Office.
The district court below denied a preliminary
injunction and dismissed the case for failure to state a claim.
QUESTION;

Car* you tell from the Shakman cas®, Mr.

Foran, whether a Republican might be employed in the tradition
of the Sheriff’s Office by s. Democratic sheriff if h® obtained
a Democratic sponsor?
MR. FORANs

Mr. Justice. Rehnquist, the stipulation

of the Sheriff's Of fie®, and I think I can describe it in
summary rather quickly.

There are 3,000 employees in the

Sheriff's Office in Cook County.

About 500 of them fit into

a kind of a larga category that includas the type that you are
mentioning.

About 500 of them are either supervisory, are co­

sponsored by any political person, or are holdovers from
previous administrations, almost in effect, career employees,
might well have been sponsored by a Republican.

About 1300

of the 3,000 employees are protected by a legislatively created
merit system.

This includes -the Sheriff’s police and the

6
corrections officers who run tlx® county jail and the house of
corrections* and juvenile facility.

And about 1200 of the

3*QQG are in this patronage area where they are appointed only
\

if sponsored by a political, figure in the party of the existing
sheriff.
QUESTION:

Is it theoretically possible* at least*

for a Republican employe© within this 1200 whan a Democratic
sheriff comes to power* if ha could get a sponsorship from a
Democrat —

QUESTION:

Oh* yes* sir.

And it often does happen.

And the record in this case shows that —
Yes, sir.
•— somebody was about to ba terminated

and his sponsorship cam© in the next day and h@ was put back
on the payroll.
MR. FORAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct* sir.
But there is a quid pro quo from that*

I gather*-from reading the record * along with the sponsorship
comes the obligation at the next election to work for this man.
MR.FORAN:

Yes* sir* political support is expected

with respect to those patronage employees.
QUESTION:
required?

But. is there, a change of registration

7
MR., FOSMJ;

No, sir, not, specifically, nor is -there

any such allegation in the complaint.

The requirement is
■

that one support fch® Democratic candidate for sheriff for his
reelection, at least, and in all likelihood, that he become a
worker for the Democratic party.
QUESTION:

Well, I realise fchsr© comas a point where

probably a stipulation doesn’t cover — is it also required
l

that he support the Democratic candidat® for Senator and for
Governor as well as the Democratic candidate for sheriff?
MR. FORAN:
Justice Rehnquist-

That8s a hard question to answer, Mr.
I think for the purposes of this argument

and for the purposes of this Court’s decision, that the
patronage practice of sponsorship would presume on the part, of
the sponsoring Democrat that this man was going to be a worker
generally for the Democratic party.
In the lower court, the district court, Judge Bauer
dismissed -the case on the basis of Alomar v. Dwyer.

While it

was pending an appeal, the Seventh Circuit cam© down with
Illinois State Employees Union v. Lewis where a Republican
Secretary of State had in effect don© the same thing to a large
number of Democrats after he took over the Secretary of State’s
office.
I did mention the Shakman case, and I should say
what the Shakman case previously held.

The Shakman case was

an independent who was running for constitutional delegate, in

s
effect a kind of a nonpartisan election, and in the Shakman
cas© he argued that because the major political parties had a
patronage system in their public employment, that his voter
candidate rights to equal protection in his ©lection, his
attempt to become a constitutional delegate had hmmn interfered
with.

So it caxna up in a slightly different context than the®

lewis case or this case, or Alomar v. Dwyer, but nevertheless
was related in the instance of the patronage system being in
question.
So that the core issue in the case is resally a very
specific, on®.

Is there a First Amendment prohibition against

an elected public official discharging a noncivil service
employee for his failure to obtain political sponsorship by the
party that the elected official wishes him to?

Perhaps in a

different context th«i respondents' rights to their jobs which
i

are conditioned on their political affiliation be equivalent
of their right to free «speech.

Only -the Seventh Circuit

Court of Appeals has ruled that they are.
said no, the Fourth Circuit said no,
said no.

The Second Circuit

the D. C. Circuit has

This Court has in recent years unequivocally held

that the right of political association is not absolute and is
subject to reasonable; restriction or limitation in the public
interest.

Ic the letter Carriers cas®

and the Buckley v.

Valeo, this Court has so hold.
This Court in I think an important cas® to considar

9
because it is the companion case to the case upon which th®
respondent rely. In 3oard of Regar-.to v. Roth, the Seventh
Circuit Court of Appeals had rulsd that a nontenurad teacher
who was fired without reason being given to him did not have
such a property interest in his job that it would generat®
due process rights.
did.

The Seventh Circuit had ruled that he

Th© Seventh Circuit said that he was entitled to a

hearing.

This Court said, no, h® was a nontanured teacher and

he had alleged that his First Amendment rights had been
violated but had been fired for no reason given,
Co this Court has ruled that he had no such property
interest which would justify protection under th® due process
clause or under the Fourteenth Amendment.

The argument, then,

must be by th® respondents that these nontenure*! employees
who had no contract, no agreement, who' had got thair job well
knowing, since they had already

received thair jobs politically

sponsored, that it was th© type of job that needed political
sponsorship, whether those people had such a right in their
job that their political association was like free speech and
that their interest as individuals in free speech overrode
any governmental interest that might exist in a partisan
political public service, a governmental interest in that
which could condition or restrict their right to political
association.
It seems to m© that while the respondents do her®

10

argue that there is no legitimate governmental interest in a —
or at least no compelling governmental interest — in a partisan,
political public service, -that in that are:a which has not been
articulated, v© must strongly disagree with that position.
Their position is based on this type of an argument, sine©
some courts, including this Court, have agreed that nonpartisan­
ship in public service, in public office, is under som®
circumstances, some legislative act, the Hatch Act is the on©
most obvious, campaign finance, that if in certain areas of
government that it is good to have a nonpartisan tenured
security-oriented employ®®, that therefor© necessarily political
public service is bad.
QUESTIONS

I would hav© thought all this Court said

in the Hatch Act cases was that Congress thought it was
desirable.
MR, FOR&N:

Exactly, Mr. Justice.

Exactly.

And in

this case, at a different level, w© have the saro® situation
here.

The Illinois state legislature and the County Board of

Cook County have both legislatively acted to say with respect
to certain offices, the police and the corrections officers
in the Sheriff's office, they are merit.

By implication they have said that with

respect to the rest of them, that he that liveth by the sword
shall perish by the «word.

You don’t think the Sheriff’s Office or

QUESTION:

And you think if they ar@ going to say

that, then they must find some substantial State interest,
a pretty strong one.
MR. FORAN:

Now, what is it?
It is this, Mr. Justice White:

14
MR. FORMIs

Well, that's the political argument.

But the political argument is also a good on© to this extent:
That th© sheriff, who has been elected by the people to exercise
»
his management discretion, if he is to exercise his management
discretion consistent with his commitment to th© people who
elected him, the people who work for him should be loyal to
him.

And he should have faith that they are loyal to him.

And h® should have faith that they are intending to encourage
his reelection as th" political figure that he is in that
operation of the government.

ill. over the country we are running into that

But th© partisan political service- Mr. Justice Whit®,
just to get back to that point, it's consensus.

What it is is

th© necessity of consensus to operate any conceivable operation,
th© necessity of loyalty.

By the way, I think Mr. Justice

Stevens used a good phrase of it.

He calls it th© necessity of

effective supervision of employees, for an employee to know he
is subject to your discipline if he doesn't do what you want
him to do, that he must be loyal to you in your endeavor to
convince th© paopl® that your representations to them

that you

could do this job ware based on your political commitment.
QUESTIONS

There are soma more practical reasons than

that, too, aren't; there, Mr. For an?

MR. FORAN:

that's the interest that I'm talking about.

*—• this Court for many years, up until

the late forties or early fifties engaged in what was
considered to be a right/privilege distinction with respect
to public employment, and they said — the Court in substance

24
said"Well, there is no right to public employment, and
therefore there are no benefits that come with. it.

It is

purely a matter of discretion, and you can even require someone
to give up their constitutional rights.55
However, cnee you accept the proposition which Mr.
Justice Stewart

again, not a new proposition,■ but 1

,-suppose culminating in Mr. Justice Stewards decision in the
Sindermann case -*■*• that there ar© certain tilings which you
cannot require of public employees.

Thera are certain things

Which you cannot take? away the benefits, on© of which -QUESTION:

Wait a i.J.nute.

You agree that the thing

You would agree that the Governor's

principal assistant in Springfield, his special counsel
certainly has to give up his constitutional rights.

If - he is a

Republican and wants to be counsel to the Democratic Governor,
and the Governor tells him,"That’s fine, but you register as
\

a Dernec at,”

he has got to do that to gat that job, doesn't

ha?
MR. TUCKER:
register as a Democrat.

Yes, sir.

1 don't know that he has to

I would say tills, that I have no

objection to the policy/nonpolicy distinction which the court
bslow in this case and Mr. Justice Stevens in the bawls case
devised.

I have no objection to that.

I don't think that is

the same thing as a balancing test with respect to fundamental
constitutional rights, however.

That's a different kind of

25
balancing.
QUESTION:

To gat a policy-“making job? then, under

your analysis, if it's a Republican administration and you
are a Democrat, you may well have to give up some of your
constitutional rights.
MR» TUCKER:

Now, just a moment.

I think you have

to distinguish between the policy-making and nonpolicy-making.
QUESTION;

OK, let’s talk about policy-making.

MR. TUCKER:
QUESTION:

You ara now on policy-making.
Right.

How do you arrive at it?

How do you

arrive at the fact that the policy-mater has to — that it's
all right tc fir© the policy-making officeholder?
MR. TUCKER:

I think you get there by virtu© of

another distinction that Justice Stevens drew in Lewis, which
is that there are certain kinds of jobs — and I think this
is the same kind of thing that the jobs that the Chief Justice

26
was talking about — Congressional administrativa aids»

There

are certain kinds of jobs in which a personal loyalty and an
agreement with the governmental philosophy of the officeholder
is essential,,

And I don't think you find ■— no, that's not

what the patronage system is about. * We are not talking about

MR, TUCKERS
QUESTION:

I suppose there is and the answer would

have to be no, but I don't think that's th® way it works out
as a practical matterr because First Amendment —
QUESTION:
MR. TUCKER:

He doesn't keep his job.
No, sir, be doss not keep his job, but

at that point in time, as a policy-maker, the person, or public
officeholders who brought him in there is leaving, his whole
philosophy, so to apeak, insofar as it relates to that job, is
leaving.

I don't think at that point you could really say that

the congressional aid, or to take it to th® sublime, th®
Secretary of State is fired because he is a Republican or
bscans© h® is a Democrat.

He simply leaves with th® group that

was in office, th© group of people who ran that public office.
QUESTION:

You can

honestly say h© is fired because

27

of his political beliefs.
MR. TUCKER:
QUESTION:

You can, you say?
I would think so.

MR. TUCKER:
QUESTION:

Well, perhaps so.
Perhaps*

Perhaps..

He is fired, because h® very

likely doesn’t agree with his new boss.
MR. TUCKER:
QUESTION:

I think h© —
What more do you want to say?

MR. TUCKER:

I think more realistically he is fired,

Mr. Justice Whit®, because h® is not really fired; he leaves
with the administration, and it!s more a personal than a
political matter.

Many times someone perhaps of a different

political persuasion comas in.

But the distinction that I

think we have to keep in mind is we are not talking about tiioss
kind of personnel.

We are not talking about congressional aids.

We are talking about process servers, bailiff's, janitors,
window washers, street cleaners.
QUESTION:

The Sindermann case that you referred to

and -then, I think, Roth, wasn’t there considerable emphasis
placed on the expectation of continued employment?
MR. TUCKER:

QUESTION^

This Court’s decisions?

MR» TUCKER?

Mr» Chief Justice, I think

that when you

|
talk about due process rights, it does.

We are not talking

about due process in this case; we are talking about fundamental
I

First Amendment rights.

And I think that Mr. Justice Stewart

in Sindermann made that distinction very clear when ho said,
and when the Court said in that case that even where there is
no expectation of continued employment, and therefore discharge
is discretionary, there are some reasons for which you cannot
discharge people.

And the meet basic of them is the exercise

of fundamental First Amendment rights, and the basic right to
freedom of political association, as this Court has held in
Kusper v. Pont-ikes, in Buck ley more recently»

Every Member of

the Court agreed that, the right of freedom of political
association is at th® cor© of the First Amendment.
QUESTION:' Buckley also, though, th© Court in sustain­
ing the public financing provisions indicated that Congress
could go a pretty far distance in funding th© two major
parties differently than minority parties.
$4Ro TUCKER:

Well, that.8s true, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

but I think that what th® Court, as I understand it, comes to,
as far as that part of Eachley is concerned is simply, "Well, we
can find nothing on this record to suggest that there is anything
discriminatory about this setup»

Your Honors have always mad©

it clear,in th© letter Carriers case, in United Public Workers,

29

and I think in Biacki&y that v;h@re fundamental rights/ such as
political associatio-, ares involved, a statutory scheme that
is going to infringi® on this — and, of course, here we don’t
have a statutory schemes w© have got an ad hoc determination
of the Sheriff of Cook County — but any public official or
legislative or congressional enactment that would infringe on
those rights must be extremely narrowly drawn and must be
totally neutral and nondiscriminatory.
QUESTION:

Mr. Tucker, you say thera is no statutory

I thought there was a statutory scheme.
MR. TUCKER;

No, I don’t bcslieve —
That provides that almost half of the

MR. TUCKER:
QUESTION;
MR. TUCKER:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
That’s a statutory scheme, isn’t it.?
That’s a statutory scheme.
Do you agree with your friend, Mr. Foran,

that th<a legislature could make everyone in the office of the
sheriff except the sheriff himself a tenured civil servant?
MR. TUCKER;
QUESTION:
MR. TUCKER:

Yes, sir.

Y@s, sir.

But they picked out only 1,200 of them.
They picked out two departments, the

police and the corrections department.
Marshall answered that question.

But I think Mr. Justice

In the first place, the

30
legislature has not acted.

The legislature has simply not

acted with respect to these and many, many other employcses.
It's not that they devise a scheme with respect to how they
could or could., not be discharged or said specifically that no
Republican may remain in office or no person shall fo@ in office
or be a public employee for an officeholder of the opposite
party.

But as Mr. Justice Marshall says* and as this Court has

said* since 1949 every member — not every member of this
Court* but I think most recently Mr. Justice White in his
decision in hi;nett, has continuously said the same thing.
Congress* the legislature* may not* the State may not.enact
a law the substance of which is that no Republican* Jew* or
Negro may be employed in public office or as a public employe©»
And to suggest that -the legislature has acted by. not acting
here seems to me to be irrelevant to the controversy* because
if the legislature had specifically enacted something to
approve this* or the Congress —
QUESTIONS

Isn’t there an old rule of statutory

construction that has something to do with this* when the
legislative body acts in on© field and doesn't act in the same
area in another?
MR. TUCKERs

Well* I understand the reference that

you make* Mr. Chief Justice, but I go back to what I said.
If the legislature had enacted a provision specifically doing
what Sheriff Elrod does — and I think it's important to look

31
at what tli® facts here arec aad they are undisputed.

Mr.

Poran very frankly admits the requirement is that in order to
obtain and maintain your job as a janitor or a process server
in the Sheriff's Office, you have to agree (a) to switch your
party affiliation, or if you are unaffiliated to affiliate with
•the Democratic Party of Cook County, not just th© Democratic
Party, because there are other Democrats in Cook County besides
the regular organisation; you have to agree to affiliate with
that organisation and to work for and support its entire
slate of candidates, not only for sheriff, but down the line.
QUESTION:

Is it also agreed that the&a plaintiffs

obtained their jobs through th® operation of that same system?
MR. TUCKER;;

It is not agreed on th© record that

they obtained them on th© basis of the same system, Mr.
Justice Rehnquist, because th© record is silent.

It is of

record that th© named plaintiffs in this case had Republican
sponsorship at the time that they came into their jobs.

It's

not clear on the record as to what that entailed, whether th©
same kind of affirmative support of a particular county party
ticket was required.
QUESTION:

I take it you would be here making the

same -kind of an argument if there were a State law, State
statute, or State constitutional provision which said, "We are
not now enacting any rule that only Democrats or Republicans
may work fox th?.: State government; what w® are saying is that

from bottom to top, and whoever wins the election

runs th® government. "
MR, TUCKER:

Yes, sir, I would be here making the

sam© argument because that would be in substance th® statute
saying that no Republican, if a Democrat wins the office, shall
be a public employee during that terra of office.
QUESTION:

Although th® fact that a Republican gets

elected Governor automatically takes care of th© Democrat.
Th® Republican moves in and runs the State government.

Yes, sir.
Whoever wins the election runs the

MR. TUCKERS That's correct.
QUESTION:

What's th© difference between a legislature

"Well, we are going to replace- this Democratic Governor

This is a neutral law.

This is a neutral

It says whoever wins the elections can work for the

government. Republican or Democrat, or Socialist, or Communist,
whoever wins.
MR. TUCKER;

My understanding of the law that you

propose is on® that says that when a Republican is elected
Governor no Democrat shall be permitted to serve in the public
service.

Is that it?
QUESTION £

Or put it the other way, whoever wins th©

election staffs th© government.
MR. TUCKER;

All right.

I think that Mr. Justice

Stewart’s opinion in Sindermann and all of th© opinions going
back to Wieman that precede that, make it clear that that
cannot be the law because it involves giving up and requiring
people as the price of public employment to give up their
fundamental First Amendment rights.

And I think if Sihdermann

means anything and if Wieman means anything, and if all of th©
»

cases that have said that you cannot require people to give
up their fundamental rights as the price of public employment,
if those casej mean anything, they mean that you cannot com©
into office or while in office make a requirement of public

34
employment
QUESTION $
MR» TUCKER:

Except for 500.
Except for 500?

You mean the policy-

making?
QUESTION:
ME. TUCKERs

Or whatever you want to call it.
I think that's a distinction that has

been drawn and worked in many other areas, Mr. Justice Whit©,
and on© that is clearly appropriate in light of the function
of Government and ths way in which the Government operates in
an elective process.

But when you are talking about nonpolicy,

making employees, I think that you have to follow the line of
casee and afford these people their fundamental constitutional
rights, and when you say that they will be deprived of those
rights or that they can be discharged or kept from public
service by virtue of their exercise of their fundamental
freedom of political expression, then you are doing by indirection
that which you could net do directly, which is exactly what
Mr. Justice Stewart expressed —
QUESTION:

Is your only exception for policy-making?

I want, to give you an, example.

Arizona has a

Corporation Commission consisting of three members who are
sleeted and who are highly political, and they have an
executive secretary who has no policy-making responsibilities
whatever.

He simply hangs around, so to speak, and will

inscribe the Commissions orders on the docket sheet.

I would

35
say under your definition* he is not a policy-maker at all.
Can they not* if fch© party control of the Corporation Commission
changes* can the new majority not replace him. under your
theory?

MR. TUCKEEs

1 think they could because 1 think that*

as Mr. Justice Stevens in the Lewis opinion indicated* there
are certain kinds of positions which are of such a personal
naturo.

For example* it may be that — let's just take the

sheriff's personal chauffeur who may be a person who certainly
isn't making any policy, when a new sheriff comes in, I am
not suggesting that

h® has to keep fch© old sheriff*3 personal

chauffeur or bodyguard.

It may be that he has to us© that

person or move that person into another capacity if he is
qualified for it in the sheriff's office rather than just
firing .him because ha is a Republican or a Democrat, but ho
is certainly entitled to have his own man driving his car.
And I think the example you give raa is the same kind of thing.
Furthermore, I think it's important that everybody
understand that we are not asking this Court to create..— and
th© Seventh Circuit again made it very clear that w© ar@ not
creating a super-civil service.

The question, fch® only thing

that is being don® here is to say, not that these people have
t.;nure, not that. they can’t be fired for any reason whatsoever,
but simply ••.hut if the sol© reason they ar® discharged is
because of their exercise of their freedom of speech, freedom

36

of political expressions, and if they Gan boar the burden of
proof of showing that, than they have a claim for violation,
under 1983, for violation of their fundamental First Amendment
rights .
QUESTION:
MR. TUCKER:
QUESTION:

Mr. Tucker.
Yes.
In line with what you are just saying,

if you prevail in this litigation, as a practical matter won't
you set the stag© for every non-civil service government
employee, local,State, and national, to contest any discharge
on the ground -that it was politically motivated?
ME. TUCKER:

I don't believe so.

put it another way, Mr. Justice Powell.

Perhaps I should

It is clear that the

rule which the Seventh Circuit adopted dees create or
recognize that there are certain things,in this instance the
exercise of First Amendment rights for which people may not
be discharged.

Therefore, persons who are discharged, I

suppose, could allege that they were discharged for political
reasons.
QUESTION:

Whenever they are discharged by someone

in the opposite party, .

I think it very likely that the

individual, would think the reason was political.

There must

be hundreds of thousands of non-civil service employees at
)

government levels all over our large country.

I am just

wondering about th© extent, to which your position would not

37
breed a vast flood of litigation.
MR. TUCKER:

1 understand that question, and my

answer to it is threefold.

Number one, this is a vastly

different thing than a civil service system in which there is
a presumption that the officeholder has to show a cause for
firing arid go through a whole panoply of due process rights
and so forth.

The burden in these cases would be on the

discharged employee, the burden of proof would be on the
discharged employee to show that th© sol© reason, for his
discharge was the exercise of First Amendment rights.

The

very placement of that burden on the employee in this kind of
a situation, in my judgment, makes it clear that there would
be very little problem in terms of enforcement.
Now, there is sons© history in this regard.

In the

Seventh Circuit we have history based on two things:

Number

one, w© have the so-called Shakman consent decree, and number
two, we have had the decision in Sht&man and in the Lewis
opinion for four or five years.

There have been a grand total

of, I believe, four enforcement proceedings under the
Shakman decree in that entire period of time with many, many
thousands.of workers covered.

There have been, X think,

five or six cases filed under the general provisions of
Shakman and lewis in that whole period of time
Seventh Circuit.

in the entire

And I think in each instance the only people

who filed those suits, in on® instance was the Public Employees

38

Onion in Lewis which resulted in the Lewis decision.

Another

one is this case, which again is filed as a class action in a
situation where the violation is admitted and flagrant on the
record, and no dispute about that, and -the others war© three
or four cases in which, after Governor Walker became Governor,
people in much higher levels brought actions which in each
instance resulted in a determination that they were policy­
making employees and therefore not covered.
I think that if you look at it in those terms, you
can see that any concern or any - interrorern argument based on
the idea that there would be a flood of litigation arising from
this kind of a determination is simply not justified.
At the same time I cannot answer your question without
also saying that we are dealing here with the. protection of
fundamental First Amendment rights.
protect these rights.

There is no ons els© to

There is no procedure in Illinois,

administrate State law or otherwise.

If the Sheriff of Cook

County or other officeholders throughout this country utilise
the public payroll and their election to public office and the
tax money that -the taxpayers provide them for the purpose of
soliciting an army of partisan workers,while in doing so, and in
order to do so, requiring those persons to forfeit their
fundamental rights under the Constitution —

MR. TUCKER:

QUESTION:

I am interested in your saying they are

forced to forego constitutional rights.

All of the respondents

and ©vary one of these people you are* talking about accepted
employment under the system you are now attacking.

Do you

think there is anything at all to th© argument advanced by
your brother that they waived any constitutional right they
may have had?
MR. TUCKERS
QUESTION:

No, I don't, Mi'. Justice Powell.
They were adults, they knew what they ware

doing, they understood th© system.
MR. TUCKER:

Assume those things to be true.

It is

not necessarily clear on the record, but assume those things
to be true, it doesn't seem to me — and I think that in their
reply brief they basically admitted and agreed that there can
be,if there are fundamental constitutional rights involved here,
there can be no waiver applied in. this situation by any
construction of the law of waiver when you are dealing with
First Amendment rights.

But forgetting about looking at it

from the legal standpoint and analysing whether there could be
a waiver of constitutional rights here, I don’t think that,
tli® —- and you can phrase this in terms of live by the sword,
die by th© sv/c.rd analogy or any other kind of phrase that
expresses -that same idea — I don’t think that that can h©
applied to this situation.
In th® first place, the people that are involved here,

40

nonpolicynnaking employees of public agencies, are the people
who are least in the position to exercise the election of
going elsewhere to preserve their constitutional rights-

They

are people who apply for and need jobs. They are compelled in
order to receive those jobs,to get those jobs, to agree to
forego their constitutional rights.
QUESTION:

You have already said it’s all right to do

that with the Sheriff6s chauffeur and his bodyguard.
MR. TUCKER:

With respect to the particular job as

chauffeur/bodyguard, yes, because of a personal loyalty or
personal connection that may be required there.
QUESTION:
with policy-making.

That doesn't really have anything to do
It isn't exclusively confined to policy­

making, is it?
MR. TUCKER:

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that we have

to be practical about it any kind of a situation of this sort,
and what I am saying is that the personal chauffeur for the
sheriff may have to be — the sheriff probably has the right
to reassign him to be an elevator operator from whence he came,
if that's from whence he came, or a driver in the rest of the
department.

I don't think that the constitution requires ~

QUESTION;
MR. TUCKER:
QUESTION:

Who is going to decide that?
The sheriff.
Yes, but who is going to decide whether

the sheriff must, give him another job.

A judge?

41
MR. TUCKER:

I don’t think anybody is going to say

h© has to give him another job.

If the sheriff discharges

him'and as a practical matter, if he exercises, as occurred
her®, the patronage function by discharging large numbers of
people, a lawsuit may be filed alleging that this person and
others were discharged solely because of their political
affiliation, and if the burden of proof can be sustained, then
that person “will recover.
QUESTIQKs

Supposing, instead of firing large blocks,

he fired.only on® man.

Does that change the fundamental

First Amendment rights for that one man?
MR. TUCKER:

It does not.

No.

And if h® could prove

that he was discharged solely for the exercise of his fundamental
constitutional .rights, he will have a claim.

I think that

the chances of very many people — you sea, the decision of
chis Court, Mr. Chief Justice, and I might say generally the
decisions of this Court air© generally respected by the people
of this country, including public officials, and if this Court
declares, as it seems to ran any analysis of the applicable
constitutional lav; requires, declares that these practices are
violative of fundamental constitutional rights, public,
officials will start obeying the law, just as the public
officials of Cook County have bean obeying the law under the
Shakman decree to the result that there have been almpst no
litigation as a result of it.

Public officials are not about

4.2
to com® out and, flaunt the decree of the Supremo Court of the
United States when it declares that fundamental constitutional
rights are entitled to protection in this area.

And it is for

that reason, among others, that there is not, in my judgment,
any great problem in terms of any flood of litigation.
the Court has the duty- to vindicate those rights.

But

If ‘there

is any clearer junction of the Court, I don't know what it is
than to vindicate the basic and fundamental constitutional
rights.
We started this, or I had intended to start this,
I guess I will end instead, with Mr. Justice White's question
to Mr. Foran.

What governmental interest is served for

fundamental constitutional rights to foe able to foe infringed
or to make infringement a. condition of public employment?
Thar© has to foe a governmental interest.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER? Your time is up, counsel.
MR. TUCKER;

Thank you.

(Whereupon, at 12 noon, oral argument in the aboveentitled matter was concluded.)
