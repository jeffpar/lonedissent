ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK G. DICKEY, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
»

MR» DICKEY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it Please
»

the Court:
I am Frank G» Dickey, Jr» and I am with the law
firm of Landrum, Patterson and Dickey of Lexington, Kentucky.
We represent the Petitioners, Thermtron Products and Larry
Dean Newhard.
It is indeed remarkable that for more than 175
years the district courts and circuit courts have.substan­
tially followed and complied with the statutory provisions
concerning removal and remand.
Hotjver, this matter is before the Court for the
review of an erroneous order of remand and it is before the
Court upon petition for a writ of certiorari to•the Circuit
Court of Appeals to the Sixth Circuit and for a determination
of this Court to exercise its inherent authority to intercede
and direct the Sixth Circuit to review this matter and for
issuance of a writ to the Respondent herein to prohibit the
Respondent from divesting the United States District Court

4
for the Eastern District of Kentucky .of jurisdiction of- this
case and to compel the Respondent to retain jurisdiction over
this matter.
QUESTION:
in view of

Where do we get any authority at all

14470 that says,"An order remanding a case to

a state court pursuant to — removed section 1443 shall not
be reviewable by appeal or otherwise?"
QUESTION:

,

And in connection with that, I think

you did not cite 1447D at all, so —
MR. DICKEY:

Well, if your Honor please, 1447D

says exactly that, that an order of remand is not reviewable

.

by appeal, mandamus, prohibition or any writ whatsoeverWhat 1447 contemplates, obviously, is that there
would not be any order to remand where a case was removed
properly where the district court had jurisdiction of the
case, assumed jurisdiction of the case and then turned around
and wrongfully remanded it on soma arbitrary and discretionary
basis.
QUESTION:

Why isn’t it just as possible to say

that what 1447D contemplates is that Congress rather
deliberately

chose to avoid the danger of delay that would

come from appealing an order of remand even though that order
was erroneous rather than to make sure that an erroneous
order of remand was straightened out by the Court of Appeals
every time?

5
MR. DICKEY:

Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc, I would agree

that Congress did intend not to burden the circuit courts of
appeals with review of every order of remand that came along»
1441 provides that any civil action brought in a state court
of which the states have original jurisdiction may be
removed by that defendant from the state court to federal
court.
Section 1447C provides, "If, at any time before
final judgment it appears that the case was removed
improvidently and without jurisdiction» then it shall be
remanded.In any case that is removed from the state court to
the United States District Court, if it is removed and on the
face of the petition for removal it is apparent that there is
no jurisdiction, then it is mandatory that that case shall be
remanded and there is no review of that order because the
Petitioner has not complied with the statutory provisions,,
"However» if a case is removed properly or
providently and if the District Court has jurisdiction, then
;he District Court must assume jurisdiction and cannot remand
that case.5' Otherwise, if it were not so, the District Court
could enter an order of remand in any case it saw fife and
:he Petitioners, whether there was jurisdiction or not, would
be sent back to state court without any remedy, without any
review of any discretionary or arbitrary decision.
And I submit that would

constitute a denial of

6
due process of law.

QUESTION:

Wouldn't that come up on the appeal

from the final judgment?
MR. DICKEYs

Mr. Justice Blackmun, if my memory

serves me correctly, there are cases which say that even if
the order of remand in a case where there is no jurisdiction
and the case goes back to state court and is tried and comes
to the ■— in this case to the Court of Appeals for the
Commonwealth of Kentucky, that this Court, I believe, would
state and has stated — or at least, the Sixth Circuit has
stated that that order of remand is not reviewable under
Section 14470 for the simple reason, that that order of remand
in t3).af particular case was made because the court obviously
did not have jurisdiction and t» hold otherwise would create
a volume of appeals in every single case where a defendant
thinks that he would be wrongfully denied access to the
federal courts under his statutory rights which Congress has
granted since 1797 — 89 --that that statutory right would be
denied,that there would be a volume of appeals.
QUESTION:

Well, Congress certainly chose, then,

unfortunate language in 1447D, didn't it?

MR. DICKEYIn this particular instance and in
these facts, yes, sir, they did because in this case the
facts in the record herein are decisive.
In this case, the Petitioners removed this action

7
from the Pike Circuit Court in Pikeville, Kentucky.

That

action was removed in strict compliance with the removal
statutes, was properly removed and the Respondent has
conceded that it was properly removed.

In this case, the

Respondent assumed jurisdiction over this matter.
The Respondent recognised that he had jurisdiction
over it and the case stayed in the United States District
Court for some nine months after which the Respondent took
it upon himself to remand the case to the Pike.Circuit
Court, and in this situation where

an order of remand was

wrongfully entered, the Petitioners must have some remedy
inasmuch as the order of remand was based upon purely
discretionary considerations and based upon considerations
that have no foundation whatsoever in the legal scheme or the
statutory scheme as far as removal and remand are concerned.
And until this Court granted certiorari, the
Petitioners had been denied any remedy whatsoever in the
order of remand.
QUESTION:

Do you know what has happened to the

other some 28 actions which this judge remanded, similar to
this diversity action?

Are they just sitting there in the

state court or what has happened to them?
MR. DICKEY:

Well, Mr. Justice Blackmun, I believe

that reference is made in the Petitioners'
writ of mandamus to the Sixth Circuit.

petition for a

8
QUESTION;

That's right, page 26 of the Appendix.

I was just carious.
MR. DICKEY;

That reference was made upon

information to counsel for the Petitioners and even though it
is not in the record, I would have to advise the Court that
I have subsequently been advised that 14 casas, I believe is
the correct number, which consist of all of those cases which
were removed during the year .1973 from the Pike Circuit
Court to the United States District Court, that 14 cases,
there were orders entered to show cause why the cases should
not be remanded.
In all but two of those cases, orders of remand
were entered.

In the two cases which the

District Court

arbitrarily and discretionarily decided to retain jurisdiction,
those two cases, of course, are still in the United States
District Court.

/

However, the other 12 I cannot answer you defin­
itely as to what action has been taken.
As far as this case is concerned, the Pike Circuit
Court judge, Judge Venters, has held a pretrial conference
in the matter.

He has been advised and has considered the

fact that this case was in the Sixth Circuit Court of
Appeals and subsequent to that, no action has been taken by
the Pike Circuit Court.
If it please the Court, the Constitution

9
specifically provides for controversies being litigated in
federal courts between citizens from different states.
That provision -QUESTION3

It has long been recognized, hasn't it,

that that Constitutional provision is subject to the terms
and conditions for diversity jurisdiction that Congress might
specify?
MR. DICSEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, your donor, it has, since 1789.
That Congress has specified, you say,

that a case such as yours is clearly removable by your client
to the District Court and Congress has further specified
that an order of a district judge remanding a case that is
sought to be removed is unreviewable by any court.
Now, aren’t those the terms and conditions that
Congress has specified, both of them?
MR. DICKEY;

Those are the terms and conditions

to the extent that it contemplates that an order of remand
will not be entered unless a case is removed imprevidently
and i^ithout jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Well, a district judge is told that,

let’s assume you are quite right, that the district judge
was acting quite erroneously when he remanded this but
Congress has simply said that one of the terms and conditions
of diversity jurisdiction is that the action of a district
judge, however erroneous it may be, is unreviewable.

10
MR. DICKEY;

If your Honor please, I think that is

what the language of section 1447D —•
QUESTION;
MR. DICKEY;

I say* seems to say.
Exactly.

However* 1 would submit to the Court* and this
has been one of the arguments of the Respondent, that at page
8 of the Respondent’s brief, this particular argument is
even made, that even if an erroneous order is entered,there
is no remedy, there is? no review of that order,
QUESTION;
MR. DICKEY:
QUESTION;
said, isn't it?

That is what seems to be said.
And I would submit —
That is what Congress seems to have

And that is one of the limitations under

diversity jurisdiction, isn’t it?
MR. DICKEY;

If that is what that says, and if

that is what Congress intended, which I submit that it is
not, singularly, any district court judge in this entire
country could arbitrarily, discretionarily, upon mere whim,
say to any removing defendant, I don’t like your case»
too busy.

I don't like this party.

I am

And even though that

party has a. statutory right of removal granted by Congress,
he would have no remedy whatsoever from action on behalf of
the district court judge.
QUESTION;
say, isn't it?

Well, that is what the statute does

II
QUESTION;

For the first hundred years in this

country that there were trials in

the federal courts for

criminal offenses, there was no appeal whatever beyond, the
district court until .1,9 83 if a district judge or a circuit
judge sitting all by himself sentenced you to 100 years in
prison, there was simply no appeal from that and nobody ever
suggested that even though it was very arbitrary, the
particular action taken by the court, that the Supreme Court
had some inherent right of review over the sentence because
Congress had not granted it.
And I would think that you would have something
of an uphill argument on bringing your case, the appealability
of it under this 1447D, conceded there was flagrant error,
what Judge Germansdorfer

did, how do you get beyond his

court with it?
MR. DICKEY;

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would

submit to this Court that this Court does have inherent
authority over all lower federal courts, over all district
court judges, in fact, where there is such a flagrant denial
of a defendant's rights of removal and denial of a statutory
right, that there must be some extraordinary remedy and this
Court does have the inherent jurisdiction or the inherent
\

authority to discipline lower court judges,
QUESTION;

Doesn't that read the not-re1viewable

language right out of the statute?

12
MR. DICKEY;

As I pointed out before, Mr. Chief

Justice, it does read exactly that way but, obviously, it
wasn't contemplated by Congress to mean that? although this
Court is not bound by the circuit court decision, the decision
of the Fourth Circuit in 1934 in Traveler's Protective
Association against Smith clearly states, "We do not

think

it was the intention of Congress that a party entitled to
invoke the federal jurisdiction should be without remedy if
the court without a finding expressed or implied of improper
removal should remand the case to the state court on a
ground arising after removal and not affecting jurisdiction."
«

Certainly, we do not find in the statutes any
evidence of such intention and the Petitioners likewise do
not find any.
QUESTIONi

Didn't the statute read differently

than than it does now?
MR. DICKEY;
under Section 28 of the

Now, if your Honor please, that was
Judicial Code and at that particular

time, there was also the same language as in Section 14470
forbidding review of an order of remand in a case such as the
one that was taken to the Fourth Circuit and in that case the
Fourth Circuit stated that leave would be granted to the
defendant in that case to file a petition for writ of mandamus requiring the court below to hear and determine the
case and the court further stated that it will probably not

2.3

be necessary for the defendant to file such petition as the
learned judge may, of his own motion, vacate the order
remanding the case and proceed to hear and decide it.
I would submit that this is exactly the same
situation, as in that case to the extent that Judge Hermansdorfer never made any finding whatsoever that this case was
removed improvidently and without, jurisdiction.

To the

contrary, Judge Hermansdorfer admitted that the case was
properly removed.
He has conceded that the district court had
jurisdiction and in that case, I think that the language in
the Fourth Circuit's opinion is applicable to this case, that
the Petitioners in this case are entitled to some remedy,
some review of judicial discretion.
Otherwise, 1 think every —QUESTION :

As has been suggested to you, every

reviewability is a creature of Congress, is a result of
Congress defining it, so you have, to point to a specific
statute, do you not, that gives jurisdiction to review?
You claim inherent power, but isn't that contrary
to all the law we have had for 180 years?
MR. DICKEY:

If your Honor please, I think that

to deny a review of a decision such as this would squarely
fall within the concept of the Constitution and deny the
Petitioners due process of law.

14
As far as the statute is concerned, there are no
cases which specifically interpret section 1447D because
there has been, with the exception of two or three cases, no
decision or no case where a district judge has flagrantly
disregarded the clear and precise language of the statute.
Only in cases where a matter is removed
improvidently and without jurisdiction shall a case be
remanded.
QUESTION:

I suppose what you are saying is is

that this decision below opens the way for the federal
judiciary countrywide to do away independently with diversity
jurisdiction.
MR. DICKEY:

Mr. Justice Blackxnun, if I had to

look into the mind of Judge Hermansdorfer, which I obvious.ly
cannot do, I would say that this was the intent of his order
of remand.
QUESTION:
for every

Well, this is a possibility, is it not,

federal judge to follow his example and just

clear their calendars of diversity cases.
MR. DICKEY:

It would certainly be, unless this

Court ■—
QUESTION:
MR. DICKEY:

No, he removed diversity cases.
If your Honor please, I think if the

order of remand in this particular case is permitted to
stand, this Ccurt is going to have to legislate judicially,

\

15
which is in an area which is completely within the realm of
Congress and this Court would also have to eliminate original
diversity jurisdiction as well as removal,
I think that not only would the order of remand in
this particular case apply to removal diversity jurisdiction,
but it would as far as original jurisdiction goes because
this was a case which could have been brought in the district
court under the provisions of original diversity jurisdiction
QUESTION:

Mr. Dickey, Congress could have stopped

that with jast one stroke of the pen.
MR. DICKEY:
QUESTION:

Well, if your Honor please —
Just take the word "mandamus" out of

that provision.
MR. DICKEY:
QUESTION:
MR. DICKEY:

Well, I think that what Congress —
Right?
Right, yes, sir.

Yes, sir. Congress

could do that.
QUESTION:
MR. DICKEY:

That's right.
I think also that Congress intended

that this matter should never arise by reason of the
language in 1447C»
QUESTION:

It is the substance of your argument

that we ought not construe 1447D as literally written but as
limited in application to cases irregularly sent back under
14 47C, that is, some reason,

that may be error that isn't

16
as you say happened here, the court, because it had a
crowded calendar, sending it back and say, "Go try it in the
state court,

Donst bother me with it."

MR. DICKEY:

That is entirely correct, your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, that is kind of odd, to say that

it is not ^viewable, even though erroneous, unless the error
is serious.

What sort of a doctrine is that?
MR, DICKEY:

If vour Honor please, the 1447D says

that an order remanding a case is not reviewable on appeal
or otherwise.
QUESTION:
MR. DICKEY:

Yes, I knov that.
Otherwise, under the cases which

have been interpreted before, means by any remedy.QUESTION:
MR. DICKEY:

Correct.
Or by any means.

However, when

section 1447D is read with 1447C, unless a case was removed
improvidentlv and without jurisdiction, then the order of
remand is not even a proper order of remand.

Therefore, what

I am saying is that the order of Judge Hermansdorfer in this
case was a void order to begin with.
QUESTION:
appeal or on mandamus.

Well, that is what you always say on
That is your substance of your case

.uut we are dealing with a procedural statute that Congress
enacted saying that it is not reviewable, no matter how

17
erroneous, by appeal or otherwise and it is no answer to say
to that statute, to say yes, but this was erroneous,,
MR» DICKEY;

What I am saying is, Mr. Justice

Stewart, that this Court has the inherent authority to
discipline district court judges e-ss far as administrative
matters are concerned and this is an administrative matter.
QUESTION;

Where do we get that?

This Court

has the jurisdiction that was conferred upon it by the
United States Constitution plus the additional jurisdiction
that has been conferred upon it by the Congress under the
authorising provisions of this United States Constitution.
QUESTION;

And that5s it.

QUESTION;

And that’s it.

MR. DICKEY;

This Court has the authority to

control the docket and where an attempt is made to deny the
petitioner his statutory right of removal.
QUESTION; You might be; on sounder ground if you
argued that Section 332 of Title 18 gives the counsel of the
circuit that kind of authority but where do you find the
i ■
counterpart statute to section-332 vesting this Court with
i ... ft

such authority?
MR. DICKEY;

I feel that this Court could probably

order, under that particular statute the implementation of
the relief sought by the Petitioners in this case.3
QUESTION;

Well, we are not the judicial council.

18
The judicial council consists of the judges of the Sixth
Circuit..
MR. DICKEYS

Well, that particular judicial

council has been notified of this as indicated in the
memorandum opinion of the
QUESTION:

I gather the Sixth Circuit was con­

cerned about what the judge had done and had tried to, perhaps,
set him straight informally.
MR. DICKEY:
assume that is correct.

That doesn’t help you, though.

That doesn’t help me a bit.

I would

Apparently Judge Harmansdorfer is

the first district court judge to confer discretionary
powers in remanding this particular case and I would submit
that the discretion that was exercised by Judge Hermansdorfer
is in direct contravention of the statutes provided by
Congress.
His decision is certainly not founded upon any
legal or jurisdictional

basis, particularly where he has

admitted that ha should actually hav© the case and I am as
concerned as well as the judiciary with the problems which

/
confront our lower courts today.
However, I am reminded of the situation that
existed in the 18808s when we had the same crowded docket
that we have today and a lawyer by the name of William
Meigs from Philadelphia submitted an article to the American
Law Reporter and in an effort to determine whether more

19

federal judges should be appointed or whether the federal
courts should restrain themselves from participating in
diversity matters, Meigs suggested that the federal courts
eliminate — or the diversity jurisdiction be'eliminated from
the federal courts and the reply that he got to that
suggestion in the Washington Lav/ Reporter was, "The fail it
of this proposal is the same which has marked ‘many other
suggestions,

It is the proposal how not to do professional

business, not how to do it."
>^nd I would submit to you that Judge Hermansdorferf s
order is an example likewise of how not to, rather than how
to.
QUESTION:

Mr, Dickey, looking through this Fourth

Circuit case that you cited a moment ago, the Traveler’s
Protective Association case in 1934, the statute then
apparently rectd that an order of remand shall be carried into
execution and no appeal or writ of error from the decision
of the District Court so remanding the cause shall be allowed,
and in that case, the Fourth Circuit held yes, although you
can’t have an appeal, you can have mandamus.
But now your 1447D reads differently.

It says,

"By appeal or otherwise."
Now, I am surprised, frankly, that you answered :my
question that the statute was the same because it seems to
me that is quite an important difference.

20

MR. DICKEY;

Well,, the way I had read that*
/

Mr. Justice Relinquish was that it did read the same.
QUESTION;

But it doesn’t, doss it?

MR. DICKEY;

It doesn't read exactly the same.

My

interpretation of that is that where it said "Writ of error,"
that that included all other i^rifcs such as mandamus,
prohibition, all writ statutes.
QUESTION:

1

But the Fourth Circuit says -- said

differently, certainly.

I would think that the present

proscription is broader than the one that was obtained in
.•«-

_the '34 case.
MR. DICKEY;

But without being facetious, maybe

“otherwise" doesn't include mandamus.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

X don't know.
Mr. Combs.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF C. KILMER COMBS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR, COMBS;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it Please

the Court,
I represent, as the Respondent real parties and
interest, an elderly couple who was injured on the mountain
road in Pike County, Kentucky but I do not hesitate one
moment to support Judge Hermansdorfer in what he did in this
case.
At the outsat, I want to disabuse this Court's
mind of any notion that Judge Hermansdorfer, through pressure,

21
caseload or whatever, rashly or otherwise dismissed or
rather remanded these cases that are referred to in the
record.
To the contrary, his response in the Sixth Circuit
points out that when he realised that there had been very few,
practically none of the several cases in the Eastern District
of Kentucky fried since 1968. When lie realized that there
could be no trial dates in the foreseeable future, he realised
that something had to be done, so he went through his entire
docket and he concentrated on the diversity removal cases
and he looked at those cases with the idea of determining
whether, in his discretion, ha might some way remand those
cases to the state courts where there was an impartial
tribunal
QUESTIONMay I ask, Mr Combs
MR. COMES:
QUESTICsM;

Yes, sir.
-- whether, then, on his docket any

Federal Employer’s Liability Act cases or Jones Act cases
had been brought into Kentucky courts?
MR. COMBS:

That had been, brought in the Kentucky

courts ?

court?
MR, COMBS:
Honor.

I cannot answer that quegtion, your

QUESTION:
cases such as those

Because I gather the federal question
pending in the state courts which were

also removable might have been included in the remandi, might
they not?
MR. COMBS s

They could have, your Honor, I am

not aware»
QUESTION:

Even though

they are federal question

cases.
MR., COMBS:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Now, as I

I guess there are other types of

federal question cases besides federal Employers Liability
and Jones Act cases, aren't there, that might also be
removed?
MR. COMBS:

I would think there are.

I don't know

of any on his docket.
QUESTION:
MR, COMBS:
QUESTION:

Yes.
But in any event —
Don't you have in the Sixth Circuit,

pressures,as other circuits have, to get old cases tried and
off the docket and given priority?

Don't you bring in

visiting judges from other places to help clear up these old
cases?
MR. COMBS:

We have those pressures, your Honor.

We have those pressures particularly in the criminal field.
We have those pressures particularly in the social security

23
field.

I believe Judge Hermansdorfer mentioned that in his

response in the Sixth Circuit.
We have that in the Federal blacklung field which
is, again, the; social security, which the Sixth Circuit has
given priority to, leaving causes such as this dormant on the
docket.

Those are the pressures we have and as a matter of

fact, other judges have been sent. in.

X have tried cases

before other judges.
QUESTION:

I am just suggesting that there ar©

other ways to clear a calendar than to put them stateside.
MR. COMBS:

There are.

This is simply one thing
»

that Judge Hermansdorfer looked at and what he did, he looked
■ at these cases and he realised that these were state cases,
state issues.

In this particular case, an automobile

accident, the kind that we find in,the Pike Circuit Court
every day.
QUESTION:

By state issues, you mean issues of

state law?
MR. CGffflS:

Issues of state law involving state

occurrences, your Honor.

discretion?

You assume ha had it.
Well, X hope I can demonstrate it,

your Honor and if I may, I'll try to do it right now.
QUESTION:
MR. COMBS:

I'd appreciate it.
Now, it has been suggested here that

once a case is removed, that then it cannot be re'manded
other than for want of jurisdiction.
X think all of us would concede that if it is
removed on a diversity basis and it later develops that there
is no diversity, then most certainly under those circumstances
it would would be remanded automatically.
Nov;, section 1447C provides for remand if the
case is removed improvidently and without jurisdiction.
Now, the question which entered Judge Hermansdorfer's mind, and X think really is the basic question
here is whether removed improvidently and without juris­
diction should be construed in the conjunctive sense or in
the disjunctive sens®,,
Now,

Judge Hermansdorfer —-

cases.
MR. COMBS:

Well, that is not

that has
;

nothing to do with the improvident, removal, as I understand
it and as I conceive it.
I conceive improvident removal — a removal which
was not providently made in order to secure a more impartial
tribunal which is the sole purpose, really, of the diversity
removal statute, as I understand it.
QUESTION:

You lost me.

QUESTION:

But the right to remove, is that

qualified in some way or is it an absolute right on the part
of the litigants — the litigant claiming diversity?
MR, COMBS:

In my view, and as I hopefully

correctly understand the intent of the Congress, it is a
qualified right.

You have a right to remove but the Congress

26

provided expressly that if the district court finds that the
if
removal was improvident,: that is,/it was improvident in the
sense that it was not necessary in order to secure a more
impartial tribunal, then the district court can remand.
QUESTION:

I could understand that better if the

said"iraprevidently or without jurisdiction.”

MR. COMBS:

I had the same problem, your Honor,

but then —
QUESTION;

Would that apply to all diversity

cases in the country?
MR. COMBS:

All removal diversity.

of course, there is no remand to •—

That would interfere with quits a. few

MR. COMBS:
QUESTION:

Well, just the
Just to accommodate one court.
It has already.
I know you*11 get some judges to

agree with you, but, can we do it?
MR. COMBS:
QUESTION:

Well, now —
I understood that once the case is

remanded that is it and the only way you can do it is on
jurisdiction.

I understand that has been ruled.

every case I have read that is what it said.
MR. COMBS:

Now, getting back to the —

At least,

21
QUESTION?
here.

May I just maintain the interruption

Had you venued this case originally in the federal

court, it could not. be remanded?
MR. COMBS:

Is this correct?

Mo, your Honor, it could not be

i

dismissed.
QUESTION:

Even though

the same considerations

might enter into Judge Hermansdorfer' s mind?
MR. COMBS:

Yes, your Honor.

Getting back, hopefully, to answering both
and/or
questions at once, the and or or — now, this Court pointed
out in DiSylva against B-aII an cine 351 U.S. 570 to 573 that
and/or
that, and and or are often used interchangeably and when, in
the context of the intent of the statute, the intent of the
Congress, it is necessary to construe one as the other, this
Court will do so.
Concededly, Mr. Chief Justice, it says "and” and
it ought to be first tasted that way but when we test it, we
find that, as Judge Hermansdorfer calls it,"a logical non
sequitur."
In other words, what he is saying is, that
construed that way, it doesn't make sense, it doesn't
logically follow.

Because if you use "and" in the conjunctive

sense, then in order to remand the case, you couldn't remand
it for lack of jurisdiction alone.
QUESTION:

Well, I don’t need the "and."

I can

28
take ,!or'! and. come out the same way.
MR. COMBS:
QUESTIONs
"improvident?"

Then if you had -What case do you have on the

What removal case do you have that

interpreted "improvident?"
MR. COMBS:
QUESTION:

I didn’t think you did.

MR. COMBS:

I — but in all

QUESTION:

This is brand new.

MR. COMBS:
it

I have no case,your Honor,

To my knowledge, it is, but I say that

i3 sound, at least in my mind it is.

Here in — now, in

one case where I believe it was a jurisdictional question in
this Court, this Court construed "or" to mean "and" to give
a circuit court jurisdiction and that is the case of Union
Insurance Company against the United .States, 6 Wallace 879
881.

So when we look at it in that sense, the word
'improvident15 has a different and a distinct meaning than
’'improper,"
removing.

Now, "improper removal "denotes some error in
"Improvidence" has a deeper meaning, a meaning

where the parties intend to provide

for the future.

That is, to provide a more impartial tribunal and
bear in mind, I say & "more impartial tribunal."

So in my

view, what the Congress was saying, using the disjunctive
"or", is that whenever the district court finds that the

29

removal was improvident in that it was not done for the
purpose of securing a more impartial tribunal, then and under
those circumstances the court could remand.

Because, after

all, that was the intent and the purpose of the removal
statute in the first instance.
QUESTION:

Of course, there was no hearing on

that here, was there?
MR. COMBS;

Yes,there was, your Honor, and I want

to defend Judge Hermansdorfer on that.

He entered a show

cause order in all of those some 28 cases or whatever and in
each case the parties were given-tan days to respond and show
why they would be prejudiced — why the cause should not be
.remanded„
Now, I don^t know that Judge Hermansdorfer gave
too much or too little time.

I don't know that he could

have suggested, whether he should or should not have
suggested a hearing, but in any event, the parties were
given an opportunity to respond, to request a hearing, to
request an evidentiary hearing if they desired and they did
not.
QUESTION:

But I suppose in Kentucky your federal

jury is chosen from a larger geographical area than your
state court jury, is it not?
MR. COfffiS:

Yes, your Honor and it is -- the

Eastern District is divided up into divisions — not

30
statutory, but divisions nevertheless and they do come iron?
oh, say, five or six or seven counties instead of just the
one.
QUEST!OH:

He sits in seven different places,

MR.COMBS:

Yes, your Honor, and in each of those

doesn't he?

divisions, of course, the jury is ordinarily selected from
within the division.

Other than that the jury selection

is substantially the same.
Now, Judge Hermansdorfer commented and I think
maybe Mr. Dickey will agree that in the Pike Circuit Court
and especially the judge to whom this case was assigned,
there is no problem about prejudice, there is no serious
objection on the grounds of prejudice in this case.
Judge Venters —
QUESTION:

If it is not really at issue here,

how can we evaluate an issue like that on this record?
MR. COMBS:

I would say you couldn't, your Honor.

I would say you couldn't.

But, certainly, there was no

sufficient suggestion of prejudice in order for Judge

to

deter Judge Hermansdorfer from remanding and he indicated in
his response to the Sixth Circuit that had there been such a
suggestion, seriously, he would not have remanded,
So that, we say, is important from the standpoint
that there was no local prejudice, at least as disclosed by

31
the record.
QUESTION:

Of course,, the defendant's right to

remove isn’t conditioned on a showing of prejudice in an
individual case, is it?
MR. COMBS:

No, it is not but I suggest it arises,

your Honor, on remand for improvident removal.
My construction is correct if the Congress
intended for the District Court to have a discretion in
•remanding removal cases where removal is improvident, then
it does have a play because,- after all, the whole purpose of
removal is in order to provide a more impartial tribunal.
If there is just as impartial a tribunal in the
state court, then, certainly, it is improvident and there it
becomes important.
QUESTION:

The statute doesn’t say "impartial

tribunal" does it?
MR. COMBS:
QUESTION:

No, it says "improvident.'
The statute doesn't say you have to

get an impartial tribunal, that is why you remove.
doesn't say a word about that.
MR. COMBS:

It

It says "removal."

But if I recall correctly, your Honor,

this Court has construed that as being the purpose of the
removal statute.
QUESTION:

Assuming that was the purpose when it

was passed, it has been there a little while.

You are

32
talking about thousands of cases in the Second Circuit.

You

are going to throw out I don’t know -- I don’t even know
how many there are.
MR. COMBS:
QUESTION:

That is what you want to throw out.
I don’t want to throw them out.
Bvit you do* unless you want to make an

exception for your district.
MR. COMBS:

I want to give a —

QUESTION:

find we can’t do that.

MR. COMBS;
every district

I want to give the district judge in

the discretion, and I would agree that it must

be carefully, wisely and soundly exercised to remand where
there is improvident removal -QUESTION;
MR. COMBS:

In each case.
In each case upon his suggestion or

upon the suggestion of the parties.
QUESTION s

And that would cut down on the amount

of the judicial time expended — if you had a hearing on
each case that would cut

down judicial time.

Is that what

you are saying?
MR. COMBS:

No, I am not suggesting it as an

administrative matter at all, your Honor.
QUESTION;

Well, this basis is, if this judge is

overloaded.
MR. COMBS:

His response in the Sixth Circuit

indicates that it is on the same basis that I am arguing

33

now} that is, that the district judge has a discretion where
there is improvident removal,
QUESTION:

Well, really, Mr, Combs-, this isn't

the issue that, is before us cat all, is it?

The issue before

us is whether or not the judge's order of remand was
reviewable at all by mandaiaous in the Court -of Appeals.
That is the only issue, isn't it?

Hot whether

or not it was correct or incorrect,
MR, COMBS:

Well, certainly, as I see it, that is

at issue just as well as the reviewability.
QUESTION:

Well, I don't see why.

MR. COMBS:

Certainly if it is appropriate, then

that is a major factor in the decision in the case.
QUESTION:

That wasn’t at all the basis of the

Court of Appeals' decision, was it?
MR. COMBS:

No,, it wasn't, your Honor, but as

noted by counsel, they handled the thing as administrative
matter.

Of course, I have argued in the brief and I maintain,

of course, that this Court has no jurisdiction, agreeing with
tha Sixth Circuit.

But I still nevertheless maintain that

the district court has a discretion.
QUESTION:

Well, you have not a single — that is

not what the statute says and that is not what any case has
ever held.

Is it?
MR. COMBS:

Mo, it is not, sir.

QUESTION s
Court.

But that is not the issue before this

The issue is whether or not it was — even assuming

it was a grossly erroneous remand order — whether or not it
was reviewable.
MR. COMBSs

We11, by the same token, 1 have no

authority that says it is reviewable.
QUESTION:

I

have cited —

Well, you have s, very strong authority

that says it isn't, and that is an Act of Congress.
MR. COMBS:
QUESTION:

Yes, I do, your Honor,
And that is what is before us, whether

or not that Act of Congress means what it seems to say.
QUESTION:

You could 'conceive that «Judge

Hermansdorfer’s action was, in itself, improvident, imprudent
and unauthorised and yet stand on the statute that Justice
Stewart has just referred to, which says that even if that
is true, no court can review it.

Isn't that the heart of

this case, as has been suggested to you several times?
MR. COMBS;
of it.

Well, certainly, that is the heart

But if that be true, then that is the end of the

case „
QUESTION:

Maybe you feel that we are more likely

to decide that it is reviewable if i«?e fall that it is grossly
wrong and if we feel less chat it is grossly wrong, we are
less likely to find it reviewable.
QUESTION:

Well, pu. just don’t want to say that

35
your client committed a lav/less action if there is no
remedy against him„
MR. COMBSi
QUESTION:

[Laughs.]
You could
/
say affirmatively that Congress

has permitted a district judge to engage in such an act
without trying to characterize it.

The statute seems to say
i

to some of us -MR. COMBS:

Well, the statute seems to say that

he can remand for any reason.

I could argue that but I want

to suggest very strongly that that is not this case because
I think it was carefully done.

I think Judge Hermansdorfer

construed this section 1447C in the

disjunctive and felt

that improvidently — something improvidently done is a word
that this Court uses all the time and that if it was removed
improvidently, it was his duty to remand but even so, I will
agree that this Court has no jurisdiction.

I will agree

that the Sixth Circuit has no jurisdiction under all of the
authorities and under the history of the statute as I under­
stand it from the cases.
I think this case and the reason that I have,
perhaps belabored 1447C is important from an administrative
standpoint.

If that is what the Congress intended, if the

Congress intended the district judge to have a discretion to
remand where a case was improvidently removed to secure a
more impartial tribunal whan it wasn't necessary to do so,

36

then, I think it should be said — I don't think I wouldn't
suggest to this Court for a moment that that should be the
basis for a wholesale remand throughout the United States,
I wouldn't suggest to this Court for a moment
that it be done other than on a forward-looking., clear and
impartial basis with a view of limiting and restricting
diversity removal jurisdiction so that cases such as this,
where you have state issues, state occurrences, state lav/,
can be tried in the state courts where I think they belong.
.QUESTION:

Well, you can say the same thing of

your case had it been vanned in the federal courts in the
first place.
MR. COMBS:

Yes, I could, your Honor.

Unfortunate­

ly, I represent sin elderly couple who would like to see this
rule applied, not only because I think it is a sound rule
but because they need to get their case tried in some court
some day.

... .
QUESTION:

I suppose a plaintiff in a case like

yours has a good deal more incentive to get into an uncrowded
court and get to trial than a defendant does.
MR. COMBS:

Certainly, your Honor.

Judge Venters has assigned it.

In this case

We have had it pretried.

We

have assigned it for trial one time and finally it came here.
I report to him periodically.
The other 14 cases, incidentally, counsel involved

37
tell me that most of them, virtually all of them, have been
disposed of, the ones that have bean remanded.

So this is

important to me and to these two people.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE:
about three minutes left.

Mr. Dickey, you have

Do you have anything further?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF
FRANK G. DICKEY, JR., ESQ.
MR. DICKEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, May it Please

the Court:
The Petitioners in this case do have an absolute
statutory right of removal.

What happens if this Court

permits this case to stand as it is now?

And what happens

if all the district court judges are granted unbridled
discretion to remand any case involving diversity jurisdiction
that they see fit?
QUESTION:
MR. DICKEY:

Why do you limit it to diversity?
Because those would be the only cases

which would appear in the United States district courts
as a result of diverse citizenship.
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but the rule -- it might

just as well apply to any removable case, including federal
question cases.
MR. DICKEY:

Oh, I agree wholeheartedly, your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Those do not have to be diversity

38
cases.
MR. DICKEY;

That is true.

If this Court sees fit to grant the relief sought
by the Petitioners, I would submit that we would still have
orderly process in the district courts until Congress sees
fit to act, which I realise that Congress has not been
totally responsive to the needs of this Court and other
federal courts but until such time as Congress acts, there
would be orderly process and without sounding trite, I would
submit to this Court that for every wrong there must be a
remedy and X would certainly hope that this Court granted
certiorari to review this case and to grant the relief sought
by the Petitioners♦
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted,
[Whereupon, at 2:57 o'clock p.m., the case was
submitted.]
