ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERRY M. MILLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MILLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is her© on pa tition for certiorari to the
Suprema Court of Wisconsin.
is the following:

Th© question it poses, as w@ sees it,

Whether Wisconsin may, consistent, with th©

supremacy clause of the. Federal Cons titration, outlaw peaceful
concerted refusals to work optional overtime in support of
worker collective bargaining demands, a self-help pressure par
raitted under the balance of power struck by Congress in th©
federal labor statute.
Th© question arises on these facts:

Th© company, a

machine tool manufacturer within th© Federal Labor Board’s
jurisdiction, terminated its labor agreement with th© union in
June of 1271.

At that time, the parties had reached an impasse
/

on a number of th© company's demands for changes in the contract.
On® of these was insistence, th® company’s insistence on in­
creasing basic work day and work wsak from seven and one-half to
eight hours a day and 37-1/2 to 40 hours a w©@k, with a

4
commensurate reduction in overtime pay.
On March 1, 1972, whila th© parties were still at im­
passe on this and other issues, th® company announced its de­
cision to implement its work schedule demands unilaterally, just
as it had previously changed other established working conditions
sosu© months before.
At this tim®, the union responded by holding a meeting
on March 7th at which the membership voted to seek strike sanction
frcm the international union and unanimously resolved that no
member should work, overtime, to find his work over 7-1/2 hours a
day or 37-1/2 hours a week*

Though th® company continued to

schedule overtime work thereafter, th® membership resolution was
observed by virtually all of th© over 600 members over th® next
four months, until th® new contract was settled in late July.
Paced with the union's counter to its self-help initia­
tive, the company backed off from implementing its work day and
work weak demands•

The impact of the union's overtime moratorium

was to cans® severe economic hardship to the company in its
effort to deal with temporary puls© increases in production
loads, while th.® workers lost substantial additional warnings
that they would ha.v© received had th® overtime bean worked.
For the past 17 years, K & T employees, the company's
employees had worked a 7-1/2 hour work day and the 37-1/2 hour
work week.

They continued to do so throughout the period March

through July 1972, in other words during the overtime moratorium.

5

By eastern and understanding, as the Commission found,
respondent Ccsnraission, none of these employees had been required
to work daily or weekend overtime prior to the March 7 member­
ship meeting.

Admittedly, since acceptance of overtime assign­

ments remained optional thereafter, no employee who concertedly
refused to accept scheduled overtime pursuant, to the moratorium
.was ©van disciplined.
Tht® union rejected a company proposal to settle th©
controversy by deferring, by th© company's deferring implementa­
tion of the new work schedules if they union would agree that all
daily overtime would now become part of th® regular work schedula
and cannot b© refused except for reasons acceptable to super­
vision.
On June 12, 1972, during th® overtime moratorium, but
the same day that aommanced th© present action, th© company
filad a charge with the NLRB alleging in part that the union's
overtime moratorium restrained employess in th® exercise of
their section 7 rights and violated its bargaining duty t© the
employer under sections 8(b)(1) and (3) of the National Labor
Relations Act.
That charge was dismissed by the board's director on
the ground that tha overtime refusals were not violative of the
federal statute.

Eh© director cited the 1960 decision of this

Court in insurance Agents International Union where various
concerted interferences with production, on the job action ware

6
held permissible under the Act, though assumed not to be pro­
tected from employer reprisal by section 7 of the national Act.
In this case, in our ease, the director raadt* no determination
as to whether K & T employees lost that promotion by collec­
tively exercising the right to raj act overtime work in 'the cir­
cumstances here.
However, the stata Commission in the instant proceeding
and later the Suprsma Court held teat the very same peaceful self
help activity permitted by the board’s director breached a
Wisconsin labor relations statute which prohibits workers from
engaging in any concerted effort to interfere with production
except by leaving the premises in an orderly manner for the pur­
pose of going on strike.
ar

The union’s defense of federal preemption was rejected
by the state tribunals on grounds that tea conduct was neither
arguably protected nor arguably prohibited by the federal
statute and, on the authority of this Court's 1947 decision in
Briggs-Stratton dealing with state jurisdiction to enjoin
quickie strikes within the plenary power of the state to regulate
That states the case on these facts.

we desire to

emphasize two of the arguments against stats jurisdiction pre­
sented in our brief,

tee first, that Briggs-Stratton is plainly

distinguishable from this case? the second, that Briggs-Stratton
should be declared overruled or limited to its exact facts, now,
of course, the reasons supportive of the latter reinforce the

7
former.
•Eh® first points

Without reaching any issue as t© the

current survival of any prior decision of this Court, we think
state jurisdiction must yield simply because th© quality of th©
conduct here is sc? differant, differant in kind from that which
has haratofor© ever bean held subject to state prohibition in
collectiva bargaining.
Pleas® contrast, if you will —
QUESTION;

Would your view of th© matter b© th© same,

Mr. Miller, if th© statute was directed against a typical sitdown that is occupying the promises?
MR. MILISRs

Ho, Mr. Chief Justice, it would not be,

i believe —
QUESTIONS

I am not suggesting a statute that goes to

th© subject of violence but ~
MR. MILLER;

I think physical obstruction of a plant

creates a series of stata interests a fortiori, of course, to
trespass, that amount to physical obstruction, th© exercise of
physical fore© in occupying the premises.

I see nothing compar-

able to that consideration in terras of state interests her©.
Contrast th© violence, th© property damage, th® bomb­
ings, th® threats and other disorder traditionally subject to
state prohibition with th© entirely peaceful concerted activity
of the workers in this case.

Consider th® obvious differences

between th© sit-down strikes of years past and ©van th© more

8
recent, issues of stat® jurisdiction to enforce trespass laws
respecting private property in labor dispute disuations with the
entirely authorized and orderly conduct of the workers at K & T's
plants hare.

They didn't occupy the premises.

The controversy

her© arose when the employer wanted then to stay longer than
they chases to stay'»
Third, compare the conduct in Bric-gs-Stratton, 26 un­
authorised and unannounced mid-shift union meetings, so-called,
supporting unstated demands, designed so that management could
not predict their occurrence

end plan production around them,

with the entirely predictable known measured, and we might even
say subordinate, concerted activity in this case.
K & T's workers arrived at work at the appointed time
each day for four months, performed their work without inter­
ruption and with customary productivity for the basic work day
and work weak.

They left work at the end of the established

work day and work week, merely exercising collectively their
acknowledged right, acknowledged by the employer to reject
scheduled overtime work.
QUESTION?

What would you say if they had all said they

were all going to go home a half hour early?
MR. MILLIRs

Mr. Justice Stevens, -that

In this case, if the employer were to

authorise that or condone it or to somehow fail to invoke his
discipoinary power" to counter it, I would think that that case

QUESTIONi

What I am searching for, Mr. Miller — and

I am sure you will spell it out before you get through ~ is what
is the bright line that makes this difference in kind frcsn
Briggs-Stratton and trespass ~ it is not peacefulness versus
violenc®, I understand -MR.

millers

Absolutely not.

There are, I believe,

two theories her©, a broad and a narrow theory, either of which
is sufficient to justify reversal in judgment.

The narrow theory

sc-called is to focus on the character of the conduct her© and
the character of the overtime, the nature of the workers *
response and say this is right at the heart of federal concern,
the kind of activity for which there is no stata interest in
substituting stats judgment or local judgment for what Congress
has dona.

In fact, what that comes down to saying very closely

is this is at the center of the federal concern because this is
conduct that is actually protective from employer reprisal by
section ? ©f Taft-Hartley.
QUESTION:

The broader theory —

If you go that far, aren't you overruling

Briggs-Stratton?

MR. MILLER:

No, I don't think Briggs-Stratton — I

think Briggs-Stratton really stands today for a very, very narrow
holding, to the extent that it lives at all, and that holding is
that in conduct — feat the conduct of the unionin BriggsStratton was so erade, so without redeeming interest that it

10
could b® assimilated to tha character of violeae® in a labor
dispute or physical takeover ©£ tha plant.

This Court said as

much in the O’Brien cast®, cited in the AFL-CIO brief.

It

analogized what it had bean saying and doing in Briggs-Stratton
with labor dispute violence, physical takeover, physical obstruc­
tion, the exercise of physical force in sit-down strike situations.
To that extant, perhaps Briggs-Stratton was, but not to any

v

greater extent then that.

I don't think anybody can say .that

the activity in Briggs-Stratton or 'that the sit-down strike is
protected from employer reprisal,

I am sure that violence in a

labor dispute is not so protected,
QUESTION:

But, of course, the dissenters in Briggs-

Stratton thought it was protected activity.
MR. MILLER;

Ths dissenters in Briggs-Stratton — and,

of course, that was a very early decision, Mr. Justice Stevens
— were focusing in on section.13 and section 501 of Taft-Hartley
as to whether that kind of — &s to whether those statutes pre­
empts c! state prohibition.

I think preemption analysis has moved

a great deal further along sine® that time.

I think I would

have to concede, for example, that an employer's self-help
weapon, legal under federal statutes, such as a lock-out, for
example, is the very kind of concern at the heart of federal
labor policy that a state may not directly prohibit.

I don't

think the dissenters in Briggs-Stratton were focusing on that

kind

of an issue at all.

11
Back to th® factual analysis her©.

Managemant knew

in advance in our case, unlike Briggs“Stratton, precisely what
to expect, when to expect it, and the demands that it furthered.
company would have liked to have had the overtime as well,
just as the workers would have liked to have the wages payable
for it.

But the parties were without a collective bargaining

agreement, at an impasse in negotiations, and economic pressures
appropriate to resolve the stalemate.
In soma, as this Court later indicated in O'Brien, the
Michigan strike vote case, Briggs“Stratton survives, if at all,
only with respect to concerted activities that can be fairly
assimilated to physical takeover of fch© plant, a sit-down strike
or labor violence.
QUESTION?

Wfell, what is your legal argument going to

h® that this is actually- protected activity?

MR, MILLER2
QUESTIONS

Wa make that argument, Mr. Justice Whit®.
Wall, what is your first argument?

MR. MILLER:

Our narrow argument is that in fact in

this case Briggs-Stratton is totally inapposite because their
conduct is so close to th© canter of federal concern as to in
fact ba protected.

The second -**

QUESTION:
MR. MILLER:
QUESTION;
MR. MILLER:

You say it actually is protected activity?
Yes, sir, we say that.
That is your first argument?
That is -th© narrow argument.

12
QUESTION s

So that, means the Court should reach'

whether it is actually protected or not
MR. MILLERs
QUESTIONS

The Court need not reach that issue.
I know, but 'that argument indicates that

you should if you say that is your first argument.
MR. MILLERs

Well, the first argument is that because

this conduct is so different from Briggs-Stratton 'feliat it doss
not fall within the rule.
QUESTION:

Forget Briggs“Stratton for a minute, let

us just talk about the federal labor lav/.

What is your first

argument?
MR. MILLER:

The first argument is , Your Honor, that

•tills — the broad argument is the first argument, the most im­
portant argument, and that is that this is a self-help activity
permitted by Congress in Taft-Hartley.

It is therefor© part of

the balance of power that Congress struck when it enacted and
amended this basic labor statute end therefore, sine© it is
crucial to the balance of power, it cannot be subject to state
preclusion or prohibition,
QUESTION:

So you a?© saying generally state interven­

tion in the area is generally preempted?
MR. MILLER:

I think it depends on the area in the

area of peaceful economic weaponry —•
QUESTION s

You think the federal labor policy in this

area is no regulation?

13
MR. MILLER;

Kof sir, tee federal labor policy in this

area is ftea play of economic force.
QUESTIONS
it?

That is a regulation.

I know, but the government shouldn't touch

Th© state government shouldn't touch it?
MR. MILLER:

Certainly not tha state government,

Justice White, certainly not the state government, and certainly
not for no interest other than to secondly hav© tea federal
balance.
QUESTION:

Wall,- let’s assume, that we disagree with

you on that point, what is your next -- is your next argument
that it is actually protected?
MR. MILLER:

The next argument is, yes, it is actually

protected.
QUESTION:
MR. MILLER:
QUESTION:

And it is not that it is arguably protected?
That is correct, arguably protected —
You do not argue th® arguably protected

point at all, I gather, in your brief?
MR. MILLER:

Your Honor, arguably protected, in our

view, is simply shorthand for tha broader category and tee broader
theory we are referring to, which is self-help weaponry.

What

Congress intended to permit- no state can set aside.
QUESTION:
MR. MILLER:

As in tha Morton case?
As in Morton, Justice Stewart, as in

Insurance Agents, at least for th© clear implications from it,
as in Florida Power & Light.

24
QUESTION:

But if w® disagree with you on your first

point, you then say we must look — that we should look and sea
if it is actually protected or not?
MR. MILLERs

Your Honor, what I tried to get across

with respect to the first point is that because the Lafeord Board
has found to b@ actually protected ~
QUESTION?
do.

I understand your first point, or I think I

What if we disagree with you?
MR. MILLER:

You still have to fac© whether or not

Briggs-Stratton, the rule in Briggs“Stratton is sufficient to
cover tli© kind of conduct her©, to permit it, to b© prohibited
by state regulation, and the entire thrust of my first argument
as presented here was to try to dispel the notion that on the
facts this can be compared at all.
I believe X reserve soma more time now.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Miller.

Mr. Come.
'

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J» COME, ESQ.,
AMICUS CURIAE

MR. COME;

May it please the Court. —

QUESTION;

Mr. Coma, before you get under way, let me

aak you this question, a hypothetical variation.

Suppose the

'Employees decided that the ray to handle this problem was to
work four hours & day, five days a week, that would make it prob­
ably , I think you mould agree, not f@si3.ible to bring in another

15
crew t© work the other -“to round out -the work weak.

Do you

think that would be protected activity?
MR. GOMEs

I don’t think that that would toe protected

by section 7 of the Act against employer discharge? but it
doesn't necessarily follow from the fact that it is not pro­
tected by section 7 against employer discharge? that the state?
under a labor relations statute? would ba empowered to prohibit
it.

I think that that was the Insurance Agents, because in that

case? as the Court may recall? these agents engaged in a series
of partial strikes which involved reporting late and leaving on
their own time? and the Court? although it was willing to accept
the board's concession that that would not be protected by
section 7 in the sense that th© employer could discharge them?
nevertheless found that the board could not, without upsetting
the balance of economic weaponry that Congress had left? go
further and prohibit it.
QUESTION:

And I submit that —

Is there any issue about prohibiting the

conduct? or is it merely a question of whether it was inconsis­
tent with good-faith bargaining?
MR. COMEs

In Insurance Agent? th® question was

whether or not this board could find that that was a violation of
th© duty to bargain.

However, in finding that th® board could

not through 8(b)(3) outlaw this conduct because of its own feel­
ing that -tills was more effective than a strike and hurt an
employer more than a strike would? th® rationale of the Court's

16
holding is based upon a consideration of the economic weapons
that were left in reserve at th© bargaining table, and the Court
concluded that, although Congress had regulated the use of
!

economic weapons for particular objectives, its failure to
specifically prohibit th® use of this tactic indicated an in­
tention to leave it to th® parties as part of th® economic
weaponry that they have to bade up their bargaining demands*
So that although Insurance Agents rested on 8(b)(3), the
rationale, w@ submit, of it go©s beyond 8(b}{3)«
Now, I would like to just back up a moment and give a
little of th© historical background here,

Briggs-Stratton was

decided 27 years ago, when the doctrine of preemption was in its
infancy.

Th© Court undertook to decide for itself whether

activity was protected by section 7 or prohibited by section 8
of the federal Act, and upon finding that it, was neither, it
concluded that th© intermittent work stoppages there were left
to state regulation.
Now, what is wrong with this approach, as th® Court
has recognized over the years, is that it required the courts,
and ultimately this Court to decide in each case for itself
whether activity was prohibited or protected, and this was a
difficult task that Congress entrusted primarily to the board to
determine and for which the Court was not too well equipped to
handle,
Secondly, it overlooked the fact that Congress may

17
have designedly left some activity unregulated, the free play of
economic forces.

Now, Garmon, which came ten years later, was

an effort to deal with this problem.

It enunciated the test

of whether an activity is arguably subject to section 7 or
section 8 of the Act, the states as well as the federal courts
ar© ousted of jurisdiction.

And sine® this was inconsitent

with Briggs-Stratton, the Court dropped the footnote in which
it indicated that the Briggs-Stratton test is no longer of gen­
eral applicability,- application.
QUESTION?

That ^^&s in the Garmon opinion?

MR. COME *

That was in the Garmon opinion.

Nov/,

Garmon has been easy for the courts to apply and, in my judg­
ment and experience, it has worked well in minimizing state in­
trusion into matters that are clearly regulated by the national
Act.
QUESTIONs

Thor© has been soma dissatisfaction with

it, hasn't there?
MR. COMEs

Yes, I get: into that.

However, recently

some members of tie Court have indicated a disposition to re­
examine Garmon because, although there is a ready means of get­
ting' the board to determine whether activity is prohibited by
section 8, in order to gat a board determination of whether it
is protected by section 7, the employer has to commit an unfair
labor practice and in sera© cases you may not even have an
employer involved.

18
QUESTION %

That is pointed out in the seriatum?

MR. GOMEs

That Is correct.

However, w® believe that

you don't have to resolve that issue here.

That is a question,

that if it is to b® reexamined, should b® in the cas© where it
makes a difference as to whether or not a finding that the
activity is not protected by section 7 against employer discharge would leave it open to stats regulation.

Now, in th®

area that w© have in this case, where you h&v© th® us© of a
peaceful economic weapon as part of th® arsenal of weapons that
is used at th© .bargaining table, I submit that th® reasons that
I indicated earlier, Insurance Agents makes it plain that that
is an area that Congress left to th© free play of economic
forces.
QUESTIONS

It is your position that you just don't

need to reach the arguably protected or the Garmon —
MR. COMEs

That is correct, because, no matter how you

decide that, it is still preempted, and I think that the Morten
case, which cams in 1964, indicates that where you are dealing
with the type of activity that you have her®, where a consequence
of finding that it is not protected still leaves it in th© field
preempted by th© Act, th© proper analysis really is whether or
not it is preempted,
situation,

find in Morton you have a very similar

Instead of using a refusal to work overtime as a

bargaining weapon, what happened was that the union appealed to
th© customers of the company that they were negotiating with for

19
a voluntary boycott, and a voluntary boycott is not proscribed
by a national act, although a course of boycott, is, the State
of Ohio gave damages for that and this Court found ~ upset that
damage award, finding that to do so, even though this was not
protected against employer discharge by section 7, would upset
the balance of power, and similarly her© ~
QUESTION:;

That was based on a very specific legisla­

tive history that Congress had considered this and rejected it
and therefore clearly left this to the area of self-help?
MR. COME:

That is correct, Your Honor.

However, I

submit, as I attempted to point out in answer to Justice
Stevens* inquiry, Insurance. Agent shows that Congress did focus
on the question of collective bargaining.
QUESTION:

The Insurance Agents case involved the

question of whether or not that slow-down, if that is what it,
could be called in that case, amounted to a violation of what,
8(b)(5), a refusal to bargain?
MR. COME:

8(b)(3).

QUESTION:

8(b) (3), a refusal to bargain, did it not?

MR. COME:

That is correct.

QUESTIONs

Which is a different question?

1^. COME:

It is a —

QUESTIONs

And it is a discreet question, a separate

question.
MR. COME:

It is a discreet question, but the route by

20
which the Court canie to that conclusion required an examination
of the basic policies of collective bargaining that Congress
had embodied in the Act, and it is the rational© of Insurance
Agents which w@ submit covers this case.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Come, may I ask you, was there a con­

viction issued in this case or was there just a state finding
of an unfair labor practice?
MR. COME:

Well, there was a state finding of an un­

fair labor praftic®.
which —'

The state issued a cease and desist order

.
QUESTION:

Could fchs union have removed the case to

the federal court?
MR. COME;

I don't, know —

QUESTION;

Well, I just —

MR. COME:

I doubt it, because, as I understand re­

moval, you hav© tc have concurrent jurisdiction in the federal
court, and if you are going to turn around and argue that the
case should be dismissed on the grounds that it is preempted,
you don’t have jurisdiction.

Usually that is why, when we have

a preemption problem, if we don't appear in the state —
QUESTION:

But if it, had bean removed under tfc® issues

Your Honor,
QUESTIONS

If I understand your argument, it is a

Do you take the position

collective bargaining is preempted?
MR. COMEs
QUEST10N:
MR. COME;

I think that basically that is —
That would include a sit-down strike?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES C. MALLATT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. MALLATT:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it pleas® the

Courts
We respectfully submit to this Court that w© are walk­
ing in to the new no law, no man's area.

The State of Wisconsin

afforded a remedy against coercive harassing tactics in a plant.
I am not going to waste this Court’s time with argument as to
whether or not the overtime here was voluntary or required.

We

take the position that the record would support the argument
that it. was required.

But I mention this point to demonstrate

the absolute necessity for hearings in these types of cases.

We

urge this Court strongly, to adopt the views of Justice Whit® in
Lockridg®, Ariadne and Nash-Finch.

W© ask this Court to us©

this case, and there must be a reason we are her©.

Vfe ask this

Court to use this case to limit Garmon to preemption only where
activity is actually protected; prohibited activity, there is a
forum, the National Labor Relations Board; arguably protected

which Congress for one© acted quickly and changed and filled

QUEST ION :

This isn't rsa.l ly responsive to your

friend's arguments; that, as a general matter, there is pre­
emption her® in Insurance Agents sens©.
MR. MALLATT:

Insurance Agents, in my judgment, has

no play in this case because what this Court, held in Insurance
Agents was that this type activity is not sufficient evidence
for the board to find 8(b) (3) that faith bargaining.

How,

Insurance Agents haId different, that employers would have a
forum to at least get a hearing as to whether ©r not this con­
duct —
QUESTIONS

I know, but the argument on the other side

is whether, even i.f this is not protected, and even if it isn't
prohibited, the state can't touch it.
MR. MALLATT:
QUESTION?

Well, what is your response to that?

MR. MALLATT:
QUESTION:

I understand that.

What we are concerned with —

Beyond that basis, it wouldn't make any

difference whether you got access t© th© board ©r not.
MR. MALIATTs

Well, our position is Briggs-Stratton.

Briggs-Stratton clearly ewers this.
QUESTION:

The argument, as I understand it, and as I

understand Justics White's question to be indicating, of your
counsel on the other side is, simply whether or not this isn't

24
arguably or actually protected in the scans© of 'the act nor
arguably or actually prohibited, but it is simply something that
Congress left to self-help, and for ‘that reason it cannot h@
touched by th© state.

Isn’t that the argument?

Do you under­

stand that to be the argument?
MR. MM.IATT:

Yes, that is clearly their argument.

I

disagree with that.
QUESTIOH:

Yes, I understand you disagree with it.

MR. MAI,3ATT;

Firmly, this Cotart looked at the legis­

lative history in 'this area in much detail in Briggs-Stratton,

QUESTIONs

But. that is not a question of limiting

Garmon, that is another issue. •
MR. MALLATT:
QUESTION;

I understand —

— and I think you had better ask the ques­

tion of the threshold of the case.
MR. MALLATT:

Your Honor, I wanted to make that point

right away, because I believe, from my reading of the case, that
on© of th® reasons w® are her© today is this Court is extremely
concerned with uniformity in the labor law, but it is also vary
concerned about affording the people of th© United States, in­
cluding employers, a right to some sort of forum if they have
what we feel is a legitimate -QUESTION;

Well, it could be the case might be her©

because the Court thought the Wisconsin Supreme Court was wrong

25
on an important question.
MR. MALLATT%

That is an absolute possibility, there

is no question about that, Your Honor, no question about that.
I would hop© to try to persuade you otherwise.
I would like to point out to this Court, if I may,
some practical problems an employer faces when he is faced with
concerted activity in the plant.

the union stewards,

It is to© risky for him to

It is too risky for him to discharge

And it is not a practical remedy.

Just last week, we had concerted activity, partial
strike activity is what we ex© talking about, here, at the Panama
Canal.

The ships were backing up.

Would it have been an effec­

tiva remedy of any kind to fir© the ship pilots?
have gotten those ships through the canal.

We couldn't

So the self-help

remedy is not practical, it puts the employees in the middle,
puts them right in the middle between the union, which is telllag them on threat of fine, don’t work overtime.

The employer,

on the other hand, is tolling them, you've got to work ov@r-fci.rn©
or we are going to discharge: you.

Who is in the middle?

The

employe© is in the middle.
QUESTION;

Mr. Maliatt, I think the question is why is

this different than an all-out strike?

Don’t those arguments

equally apply to the strike itself?

MR. MALLATT?

Several reasons.

On an all-out strike,

an employ©® risks replacement, permanent replacement.

Now, this

26
is very significant —
QUESTION:

Doesn't that also happen in a slow-down

and discharge? wouldn’t fch® same thing happen?
MR. MALLATT:

As I read -fch® law? the employer has the

right to discharges the employees because this is unprotected
activity.

I say that remedy is not practical, it is not effec­

tive, and it will create industrial warfare.
QUESTIONs

Discharge and replace insofar as his legal

rights go?
MR, MALLATTs

That is my understanding.

On the other

hand, the union — other employees have th© right to strike in
protest fc© th© discharge.
QUESTION;

Do you say that if the overtime 'was wholly

optional with -th© employees?
MR. MALIATTt

I believe that th® overtime in this case

was not optional.
QUESTION'’

I understand that.

MR. MALLATT:
QUESTION:

I want to make that clear.

I know.

I know.

But you started out by

saying in this case it doesn't make any difference whether it
was required or not.

Now, let's assume it was not required,

that overtime, as is frequently the case, was optional.
MR. MALLATT:
QUESTION:

Right.

Now whet do you say, can you be fired for

saying I will not work overtime?

27
MR. MALIATTs

I say if it is concerted, I also say,

Your Honor -questions

Well, it may have bean concerted, but

could you then fir® him for doing it in a concerted way?
MR. MALLATTs
case, the hoard, case.

I would say yes under the John Swift
I view that case that the employees had

the right to voluntarily individually refuse, but not concertedly.
Now, there are other problems, practical problems the
employer faces.

It is suggested that a lock-out is a proper

remedy or defense to this type of activity.

We take ‘the posi­

tion that an employer should not be forced to close his plant to
protect himself against activity in the plant.

But we also -take

the position that this raises a very serious problem in a legally
questionable area as to whether or not you can replace, perman­
ently replac® locked-out employees.

W® think that --and the

employer is faced with another legally unfair area, in our
judgment.
Under United States Pip® 6 Foundry, the board and the
D. C. Circuit said an employer may not reduce or withhold bene­
fits once a contract is expired in order to pressure his employees
to reach agreement wit!';, his bargaining position.

An employer

may not do that, at least that is what the board says and that is
what the D. C. Circuit says.
Yet, on the other hand, I guess today we are considering

28
— sad according to the petitioners — the union may us© partial
strike, in-plant strike tactics to pressure the employer.

All

w© say is if v/a put pressure on the employees, the union has a.
remedy, they can file a piece of paper with the United States
government, the National Labor Relations Board.

But if wa pre­

empt this area, the employer is going to be left without any
legal remedies.

H© still has self-help and whet have you.

We do not believe that Congress intended this.

How, 1

realise the problems involved with local states and courts,
whatever it is, deciding the question of actually protected.

I

concede there is
QUESTION s

If you made a written rule that overtime

is required and people refuse to live up to it, obey it, I sup­
pose you could discharge them and replace them.
MR. MALI ATT;
QUESTION:

That's true.

Did the Wisconsin courts — was there a

finding in fch© courts on whether it was required or not?
MR. MALLATT:

The Wisconsin court took the view that

it was not. protected, the activity, whether or not it was
voluntary.
QUESTIONt

Whether or not it was voluntary.

Now, ray

question was did they find whether or not it was voluntary or
required?
MR. MALI-ATTs

They did not make that finding.

The

problem was, Your Honor, when the case was first tried before

29

the Wisconsin Employment, Relations Commission, th® union took
the position that it was preempted on th® grounds that the
activity was prohibited, so the hearing was conducted on that
basis.

Tii© voluntary argument was not raised until th® State

Supreme Court.

And I say that this is a perfect example of why

there should be some hearings in this type case, because if it
is going to turn on whether or not it was voluntary, that cries
out for a need of some sort ©fa hearing, is our position.
QUESTION s'

I thought you told us earlier

clarify it,

if I misunderstood you — that if there was a refusal collec­
tively to work overtime, that was not protected —
MR. MALI ATT:
QUESTIONs

That is our opinion,

-- but individually it would be protected.

Now, in respons© to Dir, Justic® Whit®, I didn't think you mad®
that distinction.
MS. MALI ATT;
QUESTION:

Well, you just, mad© it for me.

Well, do you mean that just one employe©

says I will not. work overtime, he could be fired and replaced?
MR. MALI ATT:

That is correct.

That- is correct.

Here

you have 350-plus who refused to work overtime for four months,
axcspt thrsa who worked on ona Saturday.

I mean, this was a

little bit different ball park than Dow Chemical, where you had
just, a few employees who refused to work on® weekend of volun­
tary overtime, which hadn't even been posted on th© posting
board before they made their decision not to work.

And there

30

was no union direction or ban or order there.
QUESTions

Is this distinction you are making a prac­

tical one, or is it a legal on©?

Aire you saying as a practical

matter th© employer can’t fir© 350 people, where he could fir©
one employee?
MR. MMjLATT;
QUESTIOHs

Ho way.

Mo way.

One or two h® may.

So it is a practical one, not a legal one?

MR. MALI ATT:

Well, it is a legal argument, Your Honor,

because they raised th© question, th® defense, that this is not
— that this is in fact protected, in their view, because the
employso may voluntarily refuse anyway.

My argument is in re­

sponse to that.
QUESTION:

When you say it isn't practical to replace

several hundred people, it has been known that people have been
replaced in hundreds, 200, 300, asms of that vary close to us
her©.
MR. MALI ATT s

It i.s not practical in Milwaukee, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, Milwaukee is a bigger city than

that the parties engage in warfare.

QUESTI Oil :

I am probably, as usual, confused, but if

you say the activity overtime is required and that these people
were breaking then a work nil© and therefor© you had the right to
fire them -MR. MALLATT;

That’s correct.

QUESTIONS

why don't you just discharge them and

replace them, like you would in a general strike, rather than
trying t© seek some general relief against the union?
MR. MALLATT:

Because very candidly, if w© did that,

Your Honor, we would be putting ourselves out of business.

To

discharge 350 employees, fire them, would create the kind of in­
dustrial strife in West Alice, Wisconsin like you have never
seen before.

We would just have to shut her down.

QUESTION;

Wall, that may bs so.

That may b© so, and if

the union struck generally, I suppose you would have to be shut
down, wouldn't you?
MR. MALLATT:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Or you could fire a few.

MR. MALLATT:
mays

I would like to make this point, if I

When a compaiy and a union — and I have bean negotiating

32
labor contracts for twenty years, representing employers —
when a company and

&

onion reach an agreement at the bargaining

table, any professional in the union business will 'tell you that
if they can go to the membership and say this is the company’s
last offer, you accept it, it is fair, or you must strike and
lose wages and possibly be replaced, then the employe® will
accept it, if it is fair.

But if we have a middle ground where

-they don’t have to accept, they don’t have to strike, but they
can do these things in the plant, then I say, as a practical
matter, w@ are opening up a vast area that is going to fill us
with all kinds of legal problems.
QUESTIONS

We would hop® ~

Is there a middle ground on your response?

1 am not sure you answered Mr. Justice Whit®.

Would there b® a

legal objection to discharge of a handful of employees out of
the 350, or would you have to discharge either all or non®?
MR. MALLATT:

You are asking ras questions that I

really haven’t decided because, you see, all of these unprotected
cases come up as an employer is defending himself against an
unfair labor practice charge.

In those instances, the board

decides whether tha activity was protected or unprotected, aud­
it becomes a very close factual decision.

But the employer is

So it may turn on a lot of different

MR. MA LitATT:

QUESTIONt

1 suggest that you fire every tenth employe®,

making sure that by coincidence not too many

of the number ten

people were shop stewards or soma such thing.
MR. MALLATT:

Wall, I would £ac© a problem because I

an administrative lave judge would say I discriminated.

Now? that is a rather mild approach.

But what

Tha D. C . Circuit tells us we violated section 8(a)(5)?

w© ar© bargaining in bad faith.

But? on th© other hand? we hear

and maybe it is .Insurance: Agents that caused all the mischief
here — we hear that harassing tactics may be put on us ? and we
have no remedy except self-help.

This is bothersome.

It is

bothersome out there at th© level where we have to negotiate
labor contracts.
QUESTION;

Would you say that kind of self-help is

self-destructive?
MR. MALI ATT:

Absolutely.

It is the worst thing we

can do if the purpose of the Act? th© central purpose, of th© Act
is to avoid industrial strife.

I cannot think of anything that

35
creates mora strife than firing members of a trad® union, a po­
litical organization.

They must do everything they can to get

those ercpIcyaes their jobs back, and there is nothing that is
more destructive of good-faith collective bargaining than for
an employer to start firing tbs members.

QUESTION?

I suppose the counterargument is that if

you raaka the union fish or cut bait in the two extrema alterna­
tives, that they may find ‘they have to strike instead of engag­
ing in some lesser activity like this.

Doesn't the argument —

the same argument can be mad® on the other side of the coin, it
seems to me.
MR. MALLATT;

Well, the union has two choices;

It can

accept the company's last proposal or it can strike, or it can
continues to negotiate with the company and not make unilateral
changes in the plant.

You see, the employer can't, do that, why

should the union be able to do it?

The employer can't: pressure

his employees if they are working after a contract has expired.
Ha may lock thorn out.
QUESTION;

Couldn't you unilaterally adopt a new over­

time program?
MR. MALL-ACT:
QUESTION':

We never put it in.

But you tried to?

MR. MALIATT;

That was a little pressure, but it didn't

work.

AFTERNOON SESSION - Is 00 0»CLOCK
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
tinue.

Mr, Mallatt, you may con­

You have about seven minutes left.
MR. MALLATT:

Mr. chief Justice and may it pi@&©<s the

Court;
In our view, Briggs-Stratton has served this country
wall sine® 1949.

:?her® is very little partial strike activity

in the Industrial scene, in the industrial area.

Contrast that

'to the public area, where in most cases it is unlawful for
municipal employees to strike.

You find a very common problem

©f partial strikes, sick-ins, move-through, these things are
common.
In the industrial area, and we submit, because of the
holding of this Court, that partial strike activity is not
legally sanctioned under the National Labor Relations Act.

We

have had very little of -this type of activity.
QUESTION;

By your hypothesis, though, that would mean

that the other 49 states went along with Wisconsin in making it
a state unfair practice?
MR. MALLATT:

I*am urging this Court to sustain Briggs

Stratton, which I believe has the affsct of ruling that these
states may regulate partial strike activity.
QUESTION5

But it still wouldn't b©

&

solution on any

national basis unless the other 49 states did what Wisconsin did
MR. MALLATT:

That is absolutely correct.

W® art*

38
asking th© Court to balance th© problem of lack of uniformity
against, the problem created of no effectiva avenue to gat this
kind of issue litigated.
QUESTION s

I suppose part of your answer would be that

this is a matter up to th® states if they want to gat th© banefit of th© kind of law Wisconsin has, they can do what some of
the states did with the right-to-•work law?
MR. MALLATT s

That is correct.

As a matter of fact,,

Colorado and Hawaii copied the Wisconsin law, which has been law
sine© 1339, and I believe that this is only th© second or third
time that statute has ever been used,

w© feel that it is appro­

priate that th© state have th© right t© afford a hearing s© that
we may gat a caas® and desist against th© perpetrating union
which banned the overtime versus requiring us to take action
against individual employees.
This Court's concern for an available remedy was, I
believe, on© of ths reasons for its decision in Vaca v. Sipes»
activity which was clearly prohibited under th® National Labor
Relations Act.
I also believe 'feliat this Court’s concern that some
avenue of judicial remedy be available was part of its reason
for its decision in Linn v. Plant Guard Workers, where the Court
stated in a footnote that refusal to redress an otherwise action­
able wrong creates disrespect for th© law and encourages th®
victim to take matters into his own hands.

And I think that we

39
would not like to be encouraged, as representatives for employ­
ers.® to uses the kind of self-help remedy which would create the
kind of industrial warfare which the central -them© of the
National Labor Relations Act is to put th© parties together at
the bargaining table and say you negotiate in good-faith,

w®

believe that if there is a third avenue, don’t accept, don’t
strike., but play games in the plant, wa feel that this will up­
set that delicate balance that has evolved over th® years in
many decisions, board and court decisions.

W® feel it will tip

the scales.
I have nothing further.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Mallatt.

counsel, if you wish to use it.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERRY M. MILLER, ESQ. — REBUTTAL
MR. MILLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I will b©

very brief.
I would like to refer th© Court — and this is in
response to a question asked by Mr. Justice White — to
petitioner's appendix, page A-32, paragraph 12, where you will
find a finding by the Commission's Examiner, affirmed by th©
Commission with respect to th® non~r@qulred optional nature of
fch© overtime.
In answer to Justice Stewart —
QUESTION:

You say it was found not required?

40
MR. MILLER:

Yea, Your Honor.

In answer to Justice Stewart’s question about focus­
ing, is there legislative focus on partial strike activity, the
answer, of course, is, first of all, what Mr. Com© gave you,
and, secondly, I would point out that the broader test must b©
used with respect to the Morton analysis because where ar© you
going to find a legislative focus in so many words, in quit®
the same way you found in 8(b) (4), secondary boycott pressures,
with respect to employer weaponry, the lock-out, the unilateral
change, the right to replace.
Third, and this is; my basic answer to Mr. Mallatt,
the Insurance Agents rational© disposes of every argument Mr.
Mallatt made here because they were there made by the counsel
for the NLRB in support of its decision, finding it to violate
federal lew.

Every point he mad® was argued by the board in

Insurance Agents and rejected in an opinion by Justices Brennan
by this Court, for considerations that must, oust state power as
well as federal agancy regulation of that conduct.
If I may, 14(b), Mr. Chief Justice, permits the states
to regulate union security.

Section 10{a}, as this Court just

got through recognizing in the Immigration Act case, preseats a
very comprehensive and preemptive legislative scheme under
Taft-Hartley that make;;! section 14(b) a union shop a very, very
limited exception in favor of state jurisdiction.
Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
