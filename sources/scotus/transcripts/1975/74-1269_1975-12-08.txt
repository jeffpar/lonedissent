MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 74-1269, Kelley against Johnson,
Hr, Sweeneyr you may proceed whenever you're ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK A, SWEENEY, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, SWEENEY:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In July of 1971, the Police Commissioner of Suffolk
County amended the Rules and Regulations of the Suffolk County
Police Department concerning certain grooming regulations
for the members of the police force.
In substance, the rules stated that members of the
force should be neat and clean at all times, and that male
personnel should comply vitii grooming standard with respect to
hair.

Hair on the head should be neat, clean, and trimmed;

it should not touch the ears or the collar, said the hair in
front of the head should be groomed so that it dees not fall
below the band of properly worn headgear.

In no case would

the bulk or length of the hair interfere with the proper wear
of any authorized headgear.
The grooming regulation also mentioned sideburns,
that they should be neatly trimmed.

With respect, to mustaches,

*

a short and neatly trimmed mustache may be worn,
and goatees, the face should be clean-shaven.

As to beards

4

Wigs are also mentioned in the

regulation, that an

individual may wear a wig for cosmetic reasons to cover natural
baldness, if he so desires.
This regulation was to take effect August 1, 1971.
On August 4, 1971, an action was commenced in the federal
district court for the Eastern District of New York, basically
for a declaratory judgment and s permanent injunction enjoining
the Suffolk County Police Department from enforcing such a
regulation.
The plaintiff's complaint in that case stated that
the mere existence of the regulation violated his First
Amendment right of free expression, and the second aspect is
that the regulation violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the
Constitution of the United States because no State shall deprive
any 'person of life, liberty or property without due process of
law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal
protection of the law.
The issue before -QUESTION s

Where in these papers is the regulation

that you summarized for us?
MR. SWEENEY: The regulation is in the Appendix, on
page 57 and 58.

I will mention that there was an amendment

to even that regulation, and that is on page 48.
QUESTION:

What — 48?

MR. SWEENEY:

Yes.

5

The main one that I just referred to is on pages 57
and 58.
QUESTION: And what's the gist of the amendment?
MR, SWEENEY:

The amendment basically was a compromise

that, for .instance, with respect to mustaches, if they happen
to go below the lower lip, that that didn't matter„
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh,

How many members of the

Suffolk County Police Department?
MR. SWEENEY:

There are approximately 2600 members of

the Suffolk County Police Depaxfcment, of which approximately
2100 ar© uniformed police officers.
QUESTION: And this applies — well, at least,it
provides for waivers or exemptions —MR, SWEENEY:
QUESTION:

Yes.

-- for non-uniformed personnel?

MR. SWEENEY:

Yes, it does.

For non-uniformed

personnel and personnel who would be assigned to particular
undercover duties# an exception would be made,
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.
Mr. Sweeney, does the Suffolk County

Police Department have jurisdiction over incorporated cities
within Suffolk County, or just outside of the incorporated
cities?
MR. SWEENEY:
QUESTION:

Just in Suffolk County.

Well, in the incorporated cities, they are

6
not regarded as being part of Suffolk County?
MR, SWEENEY:

Yes ~~ well, in Suffolk County, they

would have jurisdiction over most of the towns within the
County, so that that is the predominant police force in Suffolk
County®

There are some local village police departments®
QUESTION2 And is their jurisdiction concurrent?
MR® SWEENEY:

Yes®

Now, the issues before this Court, whether or not the
length of hair,, whether it’s on the head or facial, or a
combination of both, is a First Amendment right, and if it's —
or does it fall within at least a. penumbra of the First
Amendment*

And if it’s not under the First Amendment, does it

fall under the Fourteenth Amendment?
Third, if it doss fall within either one of these
Amendments, is it a substantial right equivalent to, for
instance, free speech, or is it an ingredient of personal
liberty which, though not substantial# is nevertheless a right?
And lastly, as applied to police officers in Suffolk
County, does the State’s interest in effective law enforcement
by uniformed police '“*** appearance of police officers, outweigh
the individual's right to govern his personal choice of
appearance?
Now, when the case first came before the federal
district court for the Eastern District of New York# it was
basically on papers and affidavits submitted to the court®

7
Chief Judge Mishler in that case dismissed the
complaint, stating basically that the Suffolk County Police
Department, because it v/as quasi-military in character, and
that uniformity of dressing, grooming, are essential to effec­
tive law enforcement, the complaint was dismissed.
On appeal, the Second Circuit Court, of Appeals
reversed, stating, in substance, that there should have been a
hearing or some testimony concerning the State's interest in
this case.

They did — while stating that they held no view

on the merits, they did state that hair, in and of itself,
presents a substantial constitutional question? they stated
that the life of hair is an ingredient of an individual's
personal liberty, and that personal liberty is not composed
simply of the freedoms held to be fundamental, but includes
the freedom to act on iasa significant personal decisions.
After a hearing before Chief Justice Mishler, he
more or less reversed what he had stated before, feeling himself
bound by what tee Second. Circuit had reiterated in terms of
quasi-military, and stated that uniformity of police officers
and. safety of police officers are not legitimate State
interests.
The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed without
opinion, and of course we are here before this Court on a
petition for certiorari.
Fix*st, with reference to whether or not. hair is a

8

substantive righto
QUESTION:

Hr. Sweeney, at this point do I understand

the New York State courts have gone the opposite way on this
very issue?
MR» SWEENEY:

That’s correct.

In Greenwald va

Frank, the highest, court of the State of New York, the Court
of Appeals, unanimously affirmed the appellate division's
second department*

They squarely ruled on an issue which was

before the Nassau County — which was a similar regulation in
Nassau County, which is the sister county of Suffolk County,
QUESTION:

And do I correctly — do I understand

that the federal court, the Second Circuit, has upheld a
regulation against attack so far as firemen are concerned?
MR, SWEENEY:

That’s correct, also.

And that is

both in thie case and with respect to firemen, those were
cases decided after the Court of Appeals in the stata of New
York had ruled that with respect to police officers the issue
was one of a modest regulation, because the Suffolk County
Police Department was quasi-military in character, that there
was not: a substantial federal question present.
What constitutes a neat appearance in the opinion of
the Police Commissioner of Suffolk County should be left to
the discretion of the Police Commissioner.

The length of hair,

in and of itself, doesn't arise to basic constitutional
questions

9

Substantiva constitutional rights and liberties
should only be recognized by this Court where fundamental
liberties are at stake,,
Certainly this Court has seen fit to go beyond the
literal language of the Bill of Rights by defining such rights
as right of privacy; but we do not have that issue present here»
The burden should not be on the State, here the
Suffolk County Police Department, to show that this regulation
is constitutional; there should be — a regulation of this
type —• a presumption of conetituionality*
My adversary, in his brief, —■
x

QUESTION;

Well, isn't there a presumption of

constitutionality with respect to

every kind of regulation or

statute?
MR. SWEENEY s

Yes.

QUESTIONs Well, then you're just saying the general
rule should apply her© as well as other
MR. SWEENEY:

Yes, it should apply here.

And ray

adversary has mentioned that, in that respect, that you can
seek review in a State court where a regulation is arbitrary.
And I don't, disagree with that viewpoint.
that's what was done in Greenwald v„ Frank.

I think

And I think that’s

what should have been done in this case, and that was the
proper way to decide.

Because it can always be tested for

reasonableness in a State court

10

QUESTIONS

Are you suggesting that the State court

would demand more of the State, in effect, under its reasonable­
ness or arbitrariness, than the federal courts could under the
Constitution?
MR* SWEENEY:

I think that the State courts probably,

since they hear suits by Patrolmen Benevolent Associations
constantly, on various regulations or rules of police departxnents, that they are more familiar with, at least having a
hearing as to arbitrariness, and that with a rule of this
nature, that is the proper — they would have the burden of
showing arbitrariness at that point.
better approach in any

And I think that’s the

this regulation is no different from

any other regulation that may be part of the rules and regula­
tions of the Suffolk County Police Department.

It's always

subject to reasonableness«

IWq eases are in conflict, which is one of the reason
a petition for certiorari was brought to -this Court, and that
is? between the Second Circuit decision here and the Eighth
Circuit*
Now, if you look at the underlying reasoning in both
Circuits,

they both do not define the length of hair as a

substantial constitutional right? they merely both say it*s
leas significant;

Certainly it's not enumerated in the

Constitution, but they both lend
Fourte©nth Amendment

speak in terms of the

11
In that respect they both place a burden of proof upon,
in this case, the Suffolk County Police Department to show a
legitimate State interest reasonably related to the regulation»
With respect to a police officer# ha certainly is
the most visible representative of government that we have in
this country today»

It is the position of the Police

Commissioner that the grooming of the hair is no different from
cleaning and pressing his uniform, cleaning his fingernails#
bathing frequently? it*s just part of those rules and regula­
tions „
If you* re going to isolate every one of these regula­
tions# then we can be in court on ©vary single one of them.
There has to be# not a separation of -this as a basic fundamental
right.
Their appearance say as much about that police
officer# about themselves# as the agency they represent? and
for the public trust they hold# uphold»
Grooming standards, as part of uniform regulations#
is a legitimate State interest»

There’s an

unquestioned

interest of a local police department in effective law
anforcement.
And if you look at the two decisions again# you'll
see -that they are really differing on what is a legitimate
State interest»

One court is saying# and the Eighth Circuit

is saying# Yes# we believe that's a legitimate Stats interest?

12

and the second court, by affirming what Chief Judge Mishlar
has stated, is saying it is not a legitimate State intereato
QUESTIONS Well, is it your position that there is a
constitutional right in these people that would protect them if
the State could not show a legitimate State interest?
MRC SWEENEY:

I*m saying that, firstly, if —

presximing, arguendo, there is a right, I*m saying that it's not
substantial, that it may ba protected by the Fourteenth
Amendment»

But the State’s interest in effective law enforce*'

merit outweighs that individual police officer in having his
hair at any length he

chooses *

We are all subject to some infringement on our
personal liberties»

If I was to come before Your Honors now

wearing a bathing suit, I probably would not have gotten past
the guard*
Now, I guess that there is some infringement on my
personal liberty at that point, but certainly the fact that
this is a third branch of government and the dignity of 'the
Court outweighs my individual preference at ‘shat point.
QUESTIONs

So that if we sustain your position,

we will let you in with your hair at your length?
MRo SWEENEY:

Well, the regulation of this Court,

I believe, is a guidelines that says "conservative business
dress”i l*m not surfe, at some point, what that means.
QUESTION: Well, you don’t work for us, either, do you?

13
Except in the remote sense —* getting more and more remote ~~
that you5re an officer of the Court*
MR® SWEENEY:
QUESTIONt

Yes*
Your regulation bar goatees, too, doesn't

it?
MR* SWEENEY!
QUESTIONS

Yes, it dOSS®
That would have barred a certain man to

sit where Chief Justice Burger now aits:
MR® SWEENEYs

Justice Hughes*

I can;, say this, it would probably

bar many of tha Presidents of the United States, and it would
probably bar Jesus Christ, if he was aliva today, or Moses*
But, by the same token, any of those individuals, if they
lived today, to be a Suffolk County police officer, I couldn't
b® one *— I’m over 29 years old, so I co\iIdn*t b® on® for that
reason*

1 would have to take a Civil Service test*

There

are many reasons why one would become a police officer, there
are many restrictions on it*
QUESTION? Well, what if Suffolk County passed an
ordinance requiring all of its citizens, when they appeared
?

on the public streets, to be dressed in Liedarhosen — do you
think that would raise a constitutional problem?
MR * - SWEENEYs

Yes, I believe it would*

QUESTION; Well, then, you do in effect fesl that
there is some right, constitutional right, somewhere, perhaps
surrendered by policemen, to regulate your own dress?

14
MR. SWEENEY:

Yes, I do.

I look at the —
QUESTION:

They surrender some of it when they are

required to wear uniforms.
MRo SWEENEY: There certainly do.

And I believe the

regulation of hair is part of that, and I attach that to the
Appendix or in a separate volume, excerpti* from the rules and
regulations of the Suffolk County Police Department.
QUESTION:

But there is a difference.

When they go

home, they can take off their uniforms, and dress any way they
want.

But they can't very well change their •— the length of

their hair?
MR. SWEENEY:

No„

But when they go home, even on

their personal time they can’t associate with persons known to
be convicted of a misdemeanor or a felony, and that’s certainly
restriction on their personal lives.
And Election Lav,1 426 of the State of New York says
that the police officer cannot b© a member of a political
committee, a political club, or contribute money to them,
Now, certainly, that’s all on his own personal time.
QUESTIONs That’s something like the Hatch Act, that's
all? isn’t it?
Up to the now the Hatch Act has survived, has survived
cons titutional scrutiny.
MR. SWEENEY;

All right, —

15
QUESTION: And you are saying this is of a piece with
that limitation?
MR, SWEENEY:

Well# I'm just indicating that this is

one of many infringements, if you want to say it, on what may
be termed rights.
QUESTION: Well, isn't it a greater infringement, if
you call it that, a greater limitation when the police regula­
tions forbid his making a political speech?
MR, SWEENEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, I would agree —

That's a direct —

MR® SWEENEY:
QUESTION:

I would think it is greater.
That's a direct conflict with the First

Amendment, isn't it?
MR® SWEENEY:

Yes®

I think it’s a greater infringe­

ment, yes.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, what do you conceive is

the burden that the Court of Appeals imposed on your client in
the district court on remand?
MR. SWEENEY:

After reading the decision many times,

it would seem to me that the burden placed was the rational
relationship test,
QUESTION:

Not the compelling?

MR. SWEENEY:

Not. the compelling interest.

But I

think there was some confusion in that decision, because they
talked about a substantial constitutional issue, and then they

16

talked about rationality.

And I think, even Chief Judge

Mishler had a problem with that, because you'll see at the
conclusion of his case, he says that we did not establish a
legitimate State interest, which shows he was not sure of the
burden of proof at that point himself»
QUESTIONs

The language, I notice, is that the

Commissioner had the burden of establishing a genuine public
need for the regulation.
MR® SWEENEY:

Right» And so that presented problems.

I would say that, if anything, it should have been
a legitimate State interest, and that, that was shown by the
record.
QUESTION;
MR® SWEENEY:

Just the rationality test.
Yes.

I would reserve any time I have left for rebuttal®

Mr, Wexler.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD D, WEXLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, WEXLER:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

members of the Court:
The first police; department was established in New
York City in 1844, not by right of the United States
Constitution or the New York State Constitution, but local
laws

17

After that, many police departments were formed,
and the first laws declaring police departments or policemen
quasi-military were in the 1080’s,

Masteraon vs, French in

New York, 1888, McAuIiffe vs. City of New Bedford, 1880‘s in
Massachusetts,

Hart vs, Board of Fire Commissioners, 1880, New

York,
Thereafter, these cases became the leading cases
cited in both the State and federal courts throughout the
country that policemen are quasi-military.,
I feel those cases were wrong. It was not until
?
this Court said, in Garrity, that policemen, like teachers and
lawyers, are not relegated t.o waterad-down versions of
r

constitutional rights.

And it was finally the Dwen case, this

case, that said policemen are not quasi-military, they are
ordinary civil service workers»
How* what has happened to police departments since
.1844?

The most significant thing was the civil service law

which was passed after all the leading cases of the 1880’s,
QUESTIONs

Do you think a policeman can be required

to wear a uniform while on duty?
MR, WEXLER:
QUESTION?

Yes, sir,
Do you think all citizens of Suffolk

County could be required to wear uniforms while in public?
MR* WEXLERs
questions

No,
Then surely there are differences, where

18
the State may demand more of a member of the police force than
of an individual citizen.
MR. WEXLER:

Yes, sir, as an employee, if there*s a

compelling State interest, of course.
QUESTION:

Why do we get a "compelling State interest"

standard when we’re talking about what regulations a State can
impose on an employee?
MR0 WEXLBR:

Because there are certain needs the State

has which supersedes the needs of an individual, and therefore
the burden is placed upon the State to prove that need, the
right to wear a uniform.
Of course, if there is a need, they have a right to
do it.
QUESTION: Buy why a "compelling State interest”?
Why not simply a test of reasonableness or rationality?
MR, WEXLER:
rights.

Well, we* re taking away someone’s

If we*re dealing with rights, constitutional rights,

there should be a compelling State interest, not to test the
reasonableness0

These ar© not whims or rules, these are

rights of people we're talking about, and there should be a
compelling state interest if we’re going to make the individual
give up his rights.
QUESTION:
uniform?

What about the right to have a pressed

Suppose I just like to wear baggy pants, I give it

up when I go in the police department, don’t I?

19

Also, I have to shine my shoes when I go in the polio®!
department, don't

1?

MR. WEXLER:
interests.

I think they may b© compelling State

Yes, I think you give that right up.
QUESTION: Well, why do you have to have shiny shoes?

What State interest is in that?
MR. WEXLER:

Appearance?

Maybe you don't -*- appearance? but

maybe you don't.
QUESTION:

Well, what if — and

isn't hair

appearance?
MR. WEXLER:

It’s more than that,

You have to have

shiny shoes -QUESTION:

Well, isn't it appearance?

MR. WEXLER:

Yes, it is appearance there.

QUESTION:

And shining your shoes is an appearance0

MRo WEXLER:

Yes.

But I think there's different rights involved —*
QUESTION:

There is a difference:

one's on one end

and the other is on the other end!
MR. WEXLER:

Yes.

[Laughter. 1
MR. WEXLER:

But I don't mean by that alone.

Well, as I said, what happened to police departments?
I'm talking about quasi-military, the basis of the Barry case,
the Dwen case? I said civil service cam© in after these leading

20

cases in the 1880's.

Civil service took away the right of the

police commissioner to appoint, promote, suspend, retire? he
no longer has that authority, and civil service in New York
State 3aid the military, the State military is excluded from
thato
I'm trying to show the distinction why those cases
do not apply, the old leading cases0
QUESTION* Well, no one has argued that the policemen
and soldiers are exactly alike.
The argument has been, up until Dwen —-

MR. WEXLERs

QUESTIONs Exactly alike?
MR. WEXLERs

No, quasi.

QUESTION* Quasi.
MR. WEXLERs
QUESTION:

I want to establish ~
"Thera is something like".

MR. WEXLERs

I want to establish they're not.

QUESTION * They8 re not anything like?
MR. WEXLERs

No.

I pointed out civil **~
QUESTION:

I sea.

MR. WEXLERs

I pointed out civil service has changed

the appointment, the promotion, the retirement, ‘the discharge.
Excluding the military.
Then we have — I'm sorry?
QUESTION;

If tiie police cannot maintain order in the

21
town, who do they send in?
MR» WEXLER:

I think the police can maintain order

in the town.
QUESTION?

I said if they find an area where they

can't, who do they send in?
MR. WEXLERs
QUESTION;

The militia, don't they?

Yes.
So why would you 3®nd the military in to

do a civilian job, if the police are a civilian job?
MR. WEXLER;

That's gone beyond the police authority,

then,
QUESTION: Right.
So it must be quasi at least.
MR. WEXLERs

No, I don't think so.

If I can be permitted to continue on in that -QUESTION: Well, if you have a school strike, you
don't send in the military to teach school, do you?
MR. WEXLER:

No.

QUESTION: And if you have a strike in some other
department, any other department in government, you don't send
the military in for that, do you?
MR» WEXLER:

Yes, you do,-.

In the postal strike, you

sent the policemen in.
QUESTION:

To move -the mail, not to do the postal

work, not to sort the mail.
MR, WEXLER:

Sir, I -thought that was the job of

22

the postals, to move the mail.
QUESTION: The State postal service?

Well, I don't

know any tiling about any State postal service.
I'm talking about the State.
The only department that is supplanted by the military
is the police department.
MR. WEXLER*

'I beg to differ, sir.

When there was

talk about the riots in the jail, they were going to send the
State Militia to take over the supervision, the running of the
jails.
QUESTION 3 Did they?
MR. WEXLER:

That’s what the talk was, and that's

what they ««
QUESTION: Did they?
MR. WEXLER:

They did not.

QUESTION: What standard did Judge Mishler apply on
the remand, as you understand it?
MR. WEXLER:
QUESTION:
MR. WEXLER:
QUESTION:

Compelling —
You' 2?® arguing compelling.
Yes.
What he says is 'that the defendant failed

to establish a legitimate State interest,

hud he says, the

rule is an arbitrary limitation and a purposeless restraint.
Is that what you *»- does that spell out compelling?
MR. WEXLER:

Yes.

23

Well, continuing, then, the courts passed CPA Article
78, giving the procedure in which the test, the findings of the
head of the department, including the Police Commissioner —
it*s been traditionally that the courts would not interfere or
limitly interfere in the proceedings in the military*
Hare we set up a legal proceeding to test the actions
of a Police Commissioner.
I think the greatest significance to show that the
police is not even quasi-military is the Taylor law.

The

Taylor law provided that the police will b® their bargaining
unit, and be a

union, and negotiate all terms and conditions

— not with the Police Commissioner, but with the County
Representatives, where th® Police Commissioner is not one of
the parties to the

action.

Now, what are th® terms and conditions that are being
contracted between the County — and that’s any municipality —
that the Police?

The hours, the wages, th® uniform.

If th® County and the PBA, in their negotiations,
decided there would be no uniform, the Police Commissioner
must enforce it.

If they decided the uniform would be white,

regardless of what the Police Commissioner says, it has to be
white.
In addition

to the uniform, the hours, the terminal

leave, the equipment, guns carried by policemen are now
negotiable -- negotiated, rather*

24

In addition thereto, their tour of duty, their
personal leave, when their tour of duty ends, when it

starts,

what shift they’ve in; these are all negotiable items.

Can

we envision patrolmen or the lowest rank in the service
negotiating with. Congress to establish a book of rules that the
Commander-in-chief must follow?

That's what we have now in

police departments.
The patrolmen, the PBA negotiatas with the County
to create a contract which is then turned over to the Police
Commissioner, who must administer that contract.
Now, I agree • —
QUESTION*

Isn't that — doesn't that suggest that

if they are so upset about this hair regulation, they should
negotiate it with the County?

Negotiate it out.

If that's the way things ar© don®.
MR. WEXLER:

They haven't been able to.

QUESTION* Well —.
MR. WEXLER:

That may be a possibility. Everything

els® is negotiated, I agree.
QUESTION* What if the union imposed on the Department
the requirement that, they all have crew haircuts,; what would be
your remedy then?
MR. WEXLER:
QUESTIONs

If the union imposed that, sir?
Yes.

The union negotiated a contract requiring crew hair-

25
cuts essentially like that provided for the United States
Marines *
MR. WEXLER*

Then I don't think the contract can

contract away constitutional rights of its members.

X think the

membership would have a right to attack it.
Again, my argument is trying to show they are no
longer quasi-military, in view of the fact of the rights that
have been taken away from the Police Commissioner that he

As I said, the contract book that's negotiated,

Ha is the one who put it forth.

1 have to talk about the other case, the Kamerling
case.

My brother makes opposition, saying, how can you have

two different decisions from the Second Court of Appeals.
X have to tell this Court that I handled the trial of
Dwen and the appeal, and the trial of Kamerling and the appeal.
Kamerling

was based on Dwen.
In that Court the City of Keifs' York were able to show

that firemen responding to a fire must wear facial masks,

26
because most of then go into fires where there are numerous
gases, and they have to wear it„

They were able to prove,

through a legitimate State interest, that the seal of the mask
is affected by facial hairs, and they proved this through many
laboratory reports, and therefore there was a legitimate State
interest to regulate hair because of the safety to the men.
And it —
QUESTION?

Suppose you proved that, though, did

you, in the term cf that case?
MR0 WEXLER:

Not on that theory, sir,

concerning the proof they offered,,

I opposed it

I conceded Dwen, and I

I did fight the proof, whether it is so or not?

if it is so, then they are right under Dwena
And, in affirmance of the fact, found that they
were right, there was leakage in the gas masks®
QUESTIONS Well, is this the standard of a court to
review statutes or legislative ordinances by, they hold a
trial and make findings of fact?

I thought that was for the

legislature„
MR® WEXLER:

No.

When the issue was involved, w@

have so defined them, in any event,
MRo WEXLERt
QUESTION!
MR, WEXLER:

Yes,
All right,
Cass I briefly say that with all this

legalistic talk about hair, doesn't it really break down to a
person's grooming habits and prejudice?

We — I'm sure when

the police department was established in 1844, the policemen
had the. kind of heir, the handlebar mustache, the mutton chops,
and so forth,

When the decisions calling them quasi-military
*»

wore passed, I'm sure all policemen had the bushy hair., the
mustaches, and so forth, as wa traditionally see,
It wasn't until 'the Sixties?, when feh® hippies came
in, where hair became a dirty thing, and we started: to regulate
hair.

The regulation that we're attacking only car® in in

1971-

So, prior to that, there was no safety problem with

hair, there's no uniformity problem.

We're reacting to &

situation, a hair situation, ~
QUESTIONS

Well, of course, maybe the reaction was

based on th© fact that the policemen follow the general
sartorial trend of society,

In 1960 you wouldn't have needed

a regulation like this, because no policeman would have wanted
his hair the way your clients do,
MR. WEXLER:
QUESTION*

Yes*
And in 1840 or 1830, the early date you

were talking about, they didn’t have electric razors or safety
razors; it was a common custom for a great many people to wear
beards and —*
MR, WEXLER* And to this day it's still a common
custom for many people to wear beards,

Yes; soma people,

Yes,

which this question is,

I’m sorry.

further, Hr® Sweeney?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK A® SWEENEY, ESQ,, ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR® SWEENEY?

Just a few quick ones®

I think thin Court realises that we're not here
talking about the hair of individuals, we're talking about -the
length of hair of police officers®
It's the Police Commissioner's contention that
personal right, if it be a right, of their police officers,
under that decision of Graanwald v® Frank, is offset by the
powerful countervailing interest of the police department and
the general public®
Certainly the State courts share equal responsibility
with the federal courts on the enforcement of federal rights®
Under the principles of comity, that is the decision which
should have been followed®

And if it is a right within the

Fourteenth Amendment, the burden of proof would certainly
sustain, and the —
QUESTION2

Well, I must say, Mr® Sweeney, reading

tliis opinion of the Court of Appeals, in which particularly,
''personal liberty is not composed simply and only of freedoms
held to be fundamental" -« implying that this is not a
fundamental right —

Correct,
— Kfchat includes the freedom to make

and act on less significant personal decisions without
arbitrary government interference,K

And then going on to say,

wlimitation of such a right requiras some showing” — some
showing, not compelling, or not any other standard*
MR* SWEENEY:
QUESTION:

That’s correct*

-- "some showing of public need*”

MR, SWEENEY:
QUESTION:

Not only ~~
In other words, what Judge Mishler must

have held — am I right — was that there was no showing of
any kind that that —
MR* SWEENEY:

That's what he held*

QUESTION: And your suggestion is that there is public
need — for what?
MR* SWEENEY: For uniformity of appearance and for
safety of the police officer, which, in turn, is safety of the
general public*
Thank you*

be what?

And the uniformity of appearance would

For purposes a© that the citizen could identify a

policeman?

So they can identify police also*

foe identifiable as a policeman?
MR. SWEENEY:

No, I think if you're going to get into

the reasonableness of the regulation, then you're always going
to have a problem*

For instance, if the hair is a little bit

over the ears, is that a problem, too?
I think you have to leave that to the discretion of
the Police Commissioner,

Let him set reasonable standards,

If they ar® unreasonable — and I think he could promulgate,
even if this Court held that he had such a right, there's a
possibility that some place in this country a police
commissioner could make an unreasonable regulation.
But I think a court would strike that down, for that
reason, as being unreasonable.

You are saying some regulations could be
