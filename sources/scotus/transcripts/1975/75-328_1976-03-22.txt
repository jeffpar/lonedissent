MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER.-

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Mo. 75-328, United States v. Orleans.
Mr. Sachs©, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY R. SACHSE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SACHSE?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the.

Court:
This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court
of Appeals for th© Sixth Circuit.

The question presented is

whether employees of the Warren-Trumbull Council for Economic
Opportunity, in Warren... Ohio, are federal employees within the
meaning of id's.® Federal Tort Claims Act, and thus whether the
United States may be held liable for an automobile accident
that occurred on an outing sponsored by the Westlawn

Neighbor­

hood Opportunity Canter, a program run by Warren-Trurabu11.
The District Court granted th© United States motion for
summary judgment*

The Court of Appeals reversed the District

Court, in our vi@.w incorrectly, and contrary to this Court's
decisions in Logus v. United States and Mary land v. United
States.
The fact .• are shown in affidavits, exhibits and depo­
sitions that wars filed with and against the motion for summary
judgment.

They show the following:
Warren-Trumbull is a nonprofit Ohio corporation,

4
organised at the instance of the City of Warren? Ohio, in 1965.
The charter of the corporation is reproduced at Appendix 32,
Its purpose is to aid in aliminating poverty in Trumbull County?
Ohio.

To do so? it may receive funds from any source? but its

principal funding has always been -through grants from the Office
of Economic Opportunity.
QUESTION;

Hasn't that been in fact its exclusive

funding?
MR. SACHSE:

It has bean — it is difficult to say,

It has not been its exclusive source of support? because 20
percent of its; support has come from donations in kind in the
community? and there may have been some funding? but so far as
we know? the only dollar grants -that cam© to the organization
were from th© OEQ.
To receive Federal funds? Warran-Trumbull had to
satisfy th© statutory requirements of th© Economic OpportunityAct.

Primary among these were the following;

First? it had to

have a board of directors that was composed one-third of locally
olecdad officials ? one-third of members of th© business and pro­
fessional community that it served? and one-third of members of
th© community of the poor for whose benefit this society was set
forth.

That is required by 42 U.S.C. 2791(a),
Secondly, no employes of CEO could serve on the board

of directors or on eny committee or administrative body of
Warren-Trumbu11.

5

Thirdly, at least 20 parcent of its support had to
com© from sources other than Federal funds.

To receive Federal

funds, it also had to obey statutory requirements and regulations
concerning the use of those funds.

For instance, primarily the

salary ranges that: could be paid to its employees had to be in
accordance with comparable salaries in the communities and
could not exceed $15,000 per annum per employee from Federal
funds.

Employees of the. agency were prohibited from participat­

ing in unlawful demonstrations.

I think that would go without
«r

saying, if they are unlawful demonstrations.

And, thirdly,

Warren-Trumbull would have to submit to full auditing by the OEO
to see that the funds were expended in accordance with the con­
ditions of the grant.
The Act also provided,, the OEO Act also provided that
OEO could not set national priorities for the use of its grant
funds and that the local board of directors must have authority,
over policy, hiring and firing.
As the deposition of Wendell Verduin, the Chicago
Regional Director of OEO, mad© clear — and I am quoting from
the deposition, at pages 46 — "The recruitment selection, the
hiring and firing of staff members of the community action agency
is don® by that board of directors under its own policies and
procedures,15
And quoting from the s©position of Laaster Peterman, a
former Executive Director of Warren-Trumbul 1, who had been fired

6

by the board of directors, h© stated, "1 received my directions
from my board, which is a governing board, not an advisoryboard »
One of the programs of Warren"Trumbull was the
Westlawn Neighborhood Opportunity Center.

I think X should

probably interrupt: myself her© to say that there are soma 865
agencies of this sort funded through GEO throughout the country.
One of the programs of this agency, of Warren-Trumbull, was
Westlawn Neighborhood Opportunity Center.

It was on® of a number

of neighborhood centers that Warren"Trumbull ran whore, among
other things, teenage children could come after school and play
ping-pong or pool.

It also organized sauces and outings, and it

was on© of these outings that the respondent was hurt.
The outing was to a nearby lake, whose nam® I had in­
tended to mention but will not because it seams to be too diffoalfc to pronounce..

It is something in the nature of Coameaut.

Wastlawn, in the outing, used on© van that was purchased with
OEC funds, grant money

they also used several cars owned by

people in the community.

One of the private cars had a wreck on

the way -QUESTION;

Is: Wastlawn a separate corporato structure

or is it just an activity that is conducted by Warren-Trumbull?
MR. SACHSF:

so far as I know, it was just an activity

conducted by Warren-Trumbull.

On© of the private cars had a

wreck on the way back from the lake.

While I don't want to get

7
into whether there* was negligence or what, if there was negli­
gence, it appears there ware too many people in the car.
Ei© respondent was seriously injured and lost his
right arm as a result of the accidant.

The car that had -the

accident was driven Joy a licensed driver and was insured.

Now,

as to —
QUESTION?

Was any other entity joined as a defendant

in the
MR. SACHSE:

No other entity.

The suit was brought

purely against the United States.
There is no evidence at all that OEQ participated in
hiring the personnel involved in this outing or in planning the
outing, that it knew e£ th© «siting or that it had any control
over it at all.
QUESTION:

Was the driver an employed person of the

local group or just a —
MR. SACHSE:

No, Mr. Chief Justice, h© was one of th©

teenage students, a 17 year old boy, who was going on th® outing
H© was using his father's car, with the father's permission, to
take some of th© students on th© outing.
Th© respondent brought suit against th® United States
for $1 million, and the respondent's father for $100,000 addi­
tionally, stating that agents of th© United States wer® in
charge of the outing and war© negligent.
QUESTION:

That was a separate suit against the father

8

the owner of the car?
MR. SACESE;

No, the suit was brought by the father

individually and on behalf of his son against the United States.
The. owner of -die car was not. sued.
QUESTION?

There was not suit of any court so far as

w© are concerned against the owner of th@ car?
MR, SACHSE:

That is correct, Your Honor.

The United States moved for a summary judgment on the
ground that the persons alleged to have been negligent, were not
employees of the United States.

The District Court, in a written

opinion, on th© basis of th© affidavits and depositions, held
that Warren-Trumbull was a contractor with the United States and
not a corporation acting as an instrumentality or agency of the
United States.
On rehearing, in answer to arguments that its activi­
ties were controlled by the United States, the District Court
held that Warren-Trumbull "still remains an independent, locally
controlled and constituted nonprofit corporation? while the 0S0
has the power to cut off Federal funds if the council fails to
msat Federal standards, they have no power to cut off funds from
other sources which th© council is encouraged to utilized."
On appeal

and I think this may m the crux of the

case — the Court of Appeals held, agreed with — these are th©
words of th© Court of Appeals, "There was no showing that OEQ
controlled" — this is in our petition, appendix to the petition,

9
at page 12a — "There was no showing 'that 0E0 controlled or
supervised the physical performance of the work of employees of
WTCEO" -- that is Warren“Triimbull — "and Westlawn„

Moreover;,

the requirements imposed on these local agencies by statute and
regulations ar© not concerned with the details of the day-to-day
operations of the agencies or the programs which they carry on
in the Warren “-Trumbull County area."
Appeals.

That is the Court of

The District Court, of course, agreed* had said the

same thing.
But idle court went on to say that it didn't consider
the ties that Warren-Trumbull had with the GEO to be character­
istic of an independent contractor, and that it thought that in
reading the humanitarian purpose of the Tort. Claims Act, together
with the humanitarian purpose of the 0E0, that an accident that
occurred to on® of the persons that QEO was designed to help,
on© of the people on the outing, should be covered by the Tort
Claims Act.
t

The court, no-cad that if a person who was hurt was a
stranger, that the. situation might be handled by traditional
principles of contractor-employee relationship and the government
might not be liable.
QUESTION?

As you read the Court of Appeals opinion,

Mr. Sachs©, would there be a, — under the Sixth Circuit Review —
tort claim against, a pedestrian who had been injured by this car
with the young volunteer driver?

10
MR, SACHSEs

Th© Sixth Circuit specifically declined

to rule on that but said there might not ha, that it based its
ruling on a position that wa find no support for in the Tort
Claims Act, that vrhather tb.-o.ra is a tort claim or not would de­
pend on th© natures of th© plaintiff, on the status of the plain­
tiff.
Before I leave the statement of th© case, I want to
add on® other thing.

Th© respondents in the Court of Appeals

used as one of their bases for liability an affidavit by a man
named Sidney Roberts, -that two years after this accident, in
October of 1972 -- th® accident was in September of 1970 — 'that
he was asked by OEO to bs th® new chairman of the board of
Warren-Trumbul1 and that he was appointed directly by the Chicago
office of oso to that position.

This is all there is in the

record about it, this statement.
We had sc — we h«;v©n8t thought it appropriate to go
beyond th© record, and all we can say on this is that if this
man was appointed directly by,OEO, it was in violation of the
statutes and regulations and w® don't see how it could have
occurred, but it seems to us obviously did occur if something, of
thi;v? nature occurred.
QUESTIONs

But you didn't dispute it?

You didn't file

a. contrary affidavit with th® District Court, did you?
MR. SACHSEs

No, there is no contrary —
#

QUESTION i

So that, stands uncontradicted?

11
MR. SACESEs

It stands as a statement that in 1972,

two years after 'feta accident, tills man was appointed by the
regional chairman of 0E0 to be the director of the board —
QUESTION?
MR. SACHSEs

And it is uncontradicted?
—* of Warren-Trumbu 11.

It is uncontra­

di c ted except as to the legal conclusion in 'that this was a direct
appointment, that it seems clear as a legal matter that 0E0 could
threaten to withheld funds unless a new director of the board
was appointed, and 'that apparently a new dir actor of the board
was appointed, all two years after the ©vents at issue her©.
QUESTION?

There is an affidavit from Mr. Wendell

Verduin on page 9 of the appendix.

H© is the regional director

of the of the Office of Economic Opportunity in Chicago.

And

does he. not say that Warren-Trumbu 11 and West lawn make their own
decisions as to whom to hire, discipline and discharge?
MR. SACHSEs
QUESTION?
MR. SACHSE:
that we are saying

That is correct.
Do you >/i©w that as creating a conflict?
Wall, I think that reflects the same thing
well, I suppose the answer is yes, perhaps

that docs conflict with the other statement.

I don't think,

however, that thar-a is a conflict of fact within these affidavits
that requires resolution by this or any other court, because I
think that whether or. not CEO had eh influence, assuming that, the
board was not in compliance with the statute of getting a new
chairman of the board appointed before any other grants were

12
made, would not affect the day-“by “day control of activities
such as this one.
QUESTION:

Let me get one other thing straight.

Th©

only thing you have is that on© affidavit, is that right?
MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION:

I am not sure that I understand the -~
In the record of this case, has the govern­

ment put in anything other than one affidavit?

office of QEO, in which he states very firmly that 0E0 did not
interfere in the -~

QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:

Was it submitted by the government?
Yea, it was submitted by the government.

It was th© only affidavit submitted by the government, as 1
recall.
QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:

That is what I meant.
Th® other affidavits -and depositions were

QUESTION:

So far the government stands on that and

whatever they can gat cut of the other affidavit, but th® govern­
ment only put in the on©?

13

MR. SACESEs

The government pat in. the one, that is

correct.
QUESTIONt

Wall, insofar as there is any material

conflict in the affidavits, the government should have gotten
summary judgment in the District Court, I suppose?
MR. SACESEs

So far as there is any material conflict

with the emphasis on material ~~
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. SACHSEs

— and conflict on a point 'that would be

determinative in this case.

But w© don't think either of those

points are determinative in this case.
I would like now to turn to the Tort Claims Act.

The

Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. 1346(b), and it is quoted, of course,
in our brief, makes the United States liable for wrongful acts
of any employee of th® government while acting within the scops
of his office or employment.

Th© employee of th® government is

defined so as to include all true government employees but not to
go beyond that.

At employes of th© government includes employees

of any federal agency, under the Act, and a federal agency is
defined as including the Executive Departments, th© military
departments, independent establishments of the United States,
and corporations acting primarily as instrumentalities or agen­
cies of th® united States, but doss not include any contractor
with th© United states.

These terras ar© not unclear.

Independ­

ent establishments of th© united States rather clearly refers to

14
the independent regulatory commissions and mak.es clear that this
was not. limited to the pure Executive Branch, which is the word
that precedes it.

It covers the Federal Trad® Commission,

Interstate Commerce Commission, and that sort.

It is not

strictly part of •the Executive Department»
Corporations primarily acting as instrumentalities of
the United States — and, remember, this was an Act passed in
1946 — instrumentalities of the United States was defined in an
earlier bill that led to this Act as corporations whose primary
function it is to act as agencies of the United States, whether
or not authorised to sue or be sued.

And whether authorised to

sue or be sued gives a pretty good clue to what Congress had in
mind,

it had in mind federal corporations, whether they were sc

close that they cculdn't sue. or whether they were far enough
removed so that they had the authority to sue or b© sued,
I want to give you the source for this.
in our brief.

Well, OEO itself I think would just be an

QUESTION:

Thera is no doubt about that?

MR. SACHSEs

The Senate report No. 1399, 79th Congress,

2d Session, page 31, makes this equally clear.
QUESTION:

Give me that first number again, would you?

MR. SACHSE:
Session, page 31.

It is Report 1399, 79th Congress, 2d

"This section" -- referring to th© definition

section — "This section defines th© terns used in the title and
makes it clear that its provisions cover abl federal agencies,
including gov@rime.nt corporations."

It goes along with what 'we

have said and it is pretty obviously what Congress had in mind
when it passed the Federal Tort Claims Act.
The exclusion of contractor with the United States
also show’s that Congress only intended to make the United States
liable for the torts of its employees or, at the most, those
within its direct control.

There is no reason to assume that

under this statutory scheme that Congress intended to make th©
United States responsible for the torts of employees of its
grantees, who typically would be universities, hospitals or, in
later times, community activities that th® government chooses to
support with grant funding.

Their employees ar© even further

removed from federal employment than ar© the employees of a contractor, because a contractor doss something specific for the

16

United states in accordance with detailed plans and specifica­
tions, whereas a grantee is aided by federal money in performing
a general program that the government wishes to encourage, with­
out being in control of it even to the extent that it is in
control of the performance of a contractor.
In determining whether employees of a body receiving
federal funds, be it a contractor or some other body, whether
those employees are federal employees under the Tort Claims Act,
the court has looked to two primary sources, and both make a
great deal of senses, if I may say so.
First, the statute that establishes the relationship
between the Unitec. States and the body at issue, thus in Maryland
v. United States — it did this both in Maryland and in Logo© —
but in Maryland v. United States, the court held that the
Maryland National Guard was not a federal instrumentality, even
though it received its funding from the United states, and even
though its employees, to advance and to perform their duties
appropriately, had to follow detailed federal regulations.

It

held this both as to the military employees and to the caretaker
employees who were in fact taking car© of property admitted to
be federal property, but the statute didn't set this up as a
federal agency in time of peace.

It set it up as a state agency.

And the second test the court has looked to is the de­
gree of day-by-day control over the activities of the employ ©a,
and this is appropriate, toe, because the person who controls the

17
day-toy-day activities of the employe© is tli® person who can Ice©»
accidents from happening, is the, person that ought to be respon­
sible if an accident does happen.
In either test, this Warren-Trumbull Community Program
is not a federal instrumentality and its employees are not
federal employees.
QUESTION:

Is it conceded that th® driver of this car

was an employee of the Warren-Trumbull organization?
MR. SACESE:

No, he was not paid for driving the car.

He was on© of th© citizens who was going on this outing and who,
as a favor to Warren-Trumbull, drove th© car.
QUESTION:

Well, then, even if Warren-Trumbull were a

federal agency, hew could he qualify as an employee?
MR. SACESE.?

Well, I think he couldn't.

The argument,

of cour3®, is that ha would have bean acting in that capacity at
that moment and could be considered a federal employee.
QUESTION:
MR. SACESEs
QUESTION:

An agent?
Yes.
I don't, read the complaint as predicating

negligence on the part of the driver but, rather, in th© super­
vision of th® outing.
MR. SACHSE;

I agree.

I think th© complaint basically

says that the activities should have been more tightly super­
vised.
QUESTION:

So it is not a respondeat superior theory,

18

is that it?
MR. SACHSEs

As I understand it, th© complaint doesn't,

make that argument as to the driver of the car, but in some of
the briefs and s© forth, argument is mad® by the respondents
that the driver of the car was acting for Warren-Trumbu.11, and
that Warren-Trumbu11 was a federal agency and that therefore -~
QUESTIONS

But if your answer to try Brother Stevens

is correct, the theory of th© complaint was not the negligence
of th® driver as such but the negligence of Warren-Trumbul 1 in
allowing this young man to drive the car in a not more closely
structuring and supervising of th© outing.
MR. SACHSEs
th® complaint.

That is correct.

That is th© theory of

Now --

QUESTION?

Is; there anything in th® record about

whether some of the people cam® in their own automobiles, in th©
complaint?
MR. SACHSEs

In on® of the depositions, the deposition

of the driver shows pretty wall what happened, that a number of
the kids cam© in cars that their parents owned, driven by
licensed drivers, but then soma of them wanted to stay late and
two cars stayed later than the rest, and than to get the boys
end girls together in this same car, eight of them got into on©
ear and just a few in the other, and it was the car with eight
that had th© wreck.
Now, turning to th© statute, the Economic Opportunities

19

Act-makes it. clear that? as is pointed out —' I want to move
quickly as 1 want to save a minute or so for rebuttal? if 1 can
— that the federal government can only lend money to a com­
munity agency if it has this board of directors on which no
federal person can sit?

if the charter is a. state charter, not
»

a federal charter? and if it has local support and so forth.
But on© ©f the points that is most, persuasive to me is
that in the same Act? in setting up the Job Corps ? Congress
specifically said that the Tort Claims Act would apply to
members of the Job Corps,

How? it is incredible to me that

Congress would have intended the Tort Claims Act to apply t© the
Job Corps and felt that it had to say so? but would have felt
that the community actionprcgram? where it went to such pains to
make -these — to only allow money to be given to local programs ?
that their people would be employees of the government? without
saying a word about, it.,
And also as to the Job Corps? you will notice that
there is a tick-off as to which federal employment benefits will
apply»' and as to the CAA programs? there is nothing like that.
Congress obv.ioif.sly didn’t intend these people to be federal
@mployees.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

If you want to save any

time, you had better begin saving it? Mr. Sachs®.
MR. SACHSE:

I will say on© more thing and then I will

sit down? and that is the Court of Appeals found as a fact -chat

20

there was not the day-by-day control that would make for a useful. federal responsibility.

And the board of directors of these

programs ar© blue ribbon boards in the sans© that it is local
sleeted officials,, local business people and the members of the
poor.

That is where the liability ought to be.

They should be

responsible for having proper insurance, they should foe respon­
sible for making sure the activities ar© carried out right, aid
if they don’t do that, they should b© personally liable for it,
and in that way you can keep these accidents from happening.
But by putting feh« responsibility on Unci® Sugar in Washington,
it will mean locally that there is no responsibility.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

All right, Mr. Sachs©.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. PFAU, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. PFAU s

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
La 1964, the administration and Congress declared war
on poverty in the United States.
was at that time enacted.

The Economic Opportunity Act

The Economic Opportunity Act was an

ambitious program which included, among other programs, the
community action program.

This was a particularly unique ap­

proach that Congress was taking in its war on poverty to try to
get to the impoverished people on a local level.

They set up

guidelines in the statute for the setting up of such a community

21
action program.
They set up also the Office of Economic Opportunity, a
federal agency.

This, an exhibit in the case, shows some of

the suggestions necessary for organising a community action
agency.
A community action agency was uniquely -- must be
uniquely constituted and, by the creation of this definition,
Congress caused these community action agencies to be set. up
throughout the country.
The basic, major basic difference with a community
action agency and the ordinary charitable agency in its consti­
tution was that it was required to be governed by a board made
up of one-third local public officials, one"third representa­
tives of the poor to be served, democratically elected, and onsthird representatives of the community.

I am not sure that it will,

I am not sure

that it is in that much detail,
QUESTION;

The Articles of Incorporation are here,

Page 32.

QUESTION;

You go ahead and if I want to ask you

further, I will.
MR. PFAU;

Now, it is of the utmost importance that it

b® recognized that this was not a local agency in any ordinary
sense of the word.

This was a local agency set up to act as an

agency of Congress, of the Office of Economic Opportunity, to
carry out the purposes of the Act.
Now, it has been suggested by petitioner that instead
of being a corporation acting primarily as an instrumentality of
the United States, this agency was a contractor with the United
States.

The Solicitor General indicates that you should look to

the Act to see — to interpret -this situation.
Section 2795 of the Economic Opportunity Act. clearly
makes a distinction between grantees and contractors.

The

affidavit of Wendell Verduin does not say that this organization
was a contractor but, rather, that it was a grantee.
There are federal regulation provisions, about 80-some

24
pages of them# applying to these community action agendas , and
Cods of Federal Regulation No. 1026 distinguishes between con­
tractors and grantees.
and so forth.

Contractors must bid for the con-tracts ,

This clearly is not under the definitions in the

Act and in 'the Cod© of Federal Regulations a contractor with the
government# as has been the major contention of the government.
Fur til armor®# contractors —
QUESTION^

That doesn91 necessari3y make it an instru­

mentality or agency of the United States, though, does it, or a
corporation primarily acting as such?
MR. PFAU:

Not necessarily, but there has not been any

real contention that it was not prior to this, and all of the
facts and circumstances would indicate that this was a corpora­
tion acting primarily as an instrumentality of the United States.
QUESTION:

But that is really what you have to prove,

isn't it, not simply the fact that it was a contractor?
MR. PFAU:

Yes, Your Honor.

The contractor is an ex­

ception and, as Your Honor pointed out, in the Logue case, at the
very outset of the case, there was in that, case a contract,
/

There is no contract in any ordinary sens© here under the common
law.

A contract under -the common law is most simply defined in

American Jurisprudence Second, is a legally enforciblc promise.
This proraise was not legally enfircible.

The Cods of Federal

Regulations providas that the Office of Economic Opportunity
could unilaterally and peremptorily terminate assistance — they

25
don’t say breach the contract or end the contract — terminate
assistance to any communiti'' action agency, and from that termin­
ation the ultimate appeal was to the director of the agency it­
self.

So that in the ordinary sens© of the term, there was no

contract.
Now the question then is, was this a corporation acting primarily as an instrumentality of the United States»

The

Congress, in the Federal Tort Claims Act, had various considerations, various language they considered which would have limited
that portion of the Act, corporations acting primarily as
instrumentalities of the United States to federal corporations
and that sort of thing, as suggested by Mr. Sachs©.

They decided

not 'to so limit it and left the language unlimited.
Mow, in this case you have a corporation which was en­
acted for the ■— was created for the sola purpose of getting
federal funds, never received a dollar from anyone else.

The

only other contributions it received were in kind services»

And

it might b© noted at this point the deposition of Mrs. Ellen
Stanton, who was the person employed by the Westlawn Neighborhood
Center in charge of this outing.

In that deposition she said

that the driver of the car filed what they called an in kind
slip, in other words he was acting as an employee of the par­
ticular agency at the time of this accident.

That really is not

in issue here, but the questions of the Court have put it to
soma extent in issue, and Mr. Sachs©*s comment that he was not

an employes Is, I believe, not correct.
QUESTION s

Do you suggest that this young man driving

the car was essentially in the same standing and position as th©
driver of the bus that would be furnished by th© local bus com­
pany as a contribution to the program?
MR. PFAU:

Yes, Your Honor, this —-

income tax.
MR. PFAU:

Well, that might well be.

Th© record is

silent on that, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

But that turns it upside down, doesn’t it?

Ordinarily an employee gets paid something.

Here you are saying

27
that he contributed something.
MR. PFAU:

Correct.

There is an 80™20 setup on -these

corporations, 80 percent of the funding is to be in cash from
the United States.

The other 20 percent is supposed to be

locally furnished.

I think it is in part a fiction.

But they

do keep track of any employment activity that anyone does on
behalf of the agency and file in kind service slips.

In other

words, -then they put on those in kind service slips their tax
f

value, and in the report to the Office of Economic Opportunity,
those are given a dollar value to make up this 20 percent.
QUESTION:

But what you are saying is not that this

fellow got paid something and was therefore an employee, but
that he paid something and was therefore an employee.
MR. PFAU“

Well, in this instance, there were two

buses which were to be used.

One of the buses was not available

— two buses owned by the agency — one of the buses? was not
available, so two cars were used in this fashion, and the man
in effect made a donation of his services to the agency.

In

other words, he volunteered to act as an employ©© of the agency

Wall, now, to say you donate your services

excludes the possibility of this man being an employee.

At any

That is a

question that might require factual determination ultimately by
the trial court,
QUESTIONt

Mr, Pfau, I ara interested, has there been

an action against 'the driver of the automobile?
MR, PFAU:

The record is silent on -that, Your Honor,

For Your Honor's information, the driver of the automobile had
$12,500 insurance coverage, arid a covenant not to sue was taken
in that respect, that hardly being adequate compensation for the
loss of a young man's right arm at the shoulder.
QUESTION:

Under the Sixth Circuit, holding, in your

view of the case, if on this outing on© of the boys or girls had
been drowned while swimming in the lake, assuming they went
swimming on the picnic, would there be, in your view, a cause of
action against the United States for not furnishing adequate
supervision to see that no one drowned?
MR, PFAU:

If there were such factual basis, yes,

assuming that, surely.
QUESTION:

It would —

Or1 if they started a little league baseball

team and on© of the boys took the bat and got hit in the eye by
the pitcher’s throw, a cause of action against the Uni tad
states?
MR, PFAU:

Under the Ohio law, of course, there is an

assumption of risk of that sort of thing, but absent that, the
agency, it is our position that the activities of the Warren-

29
Trumbull Council are just as much activities of the United
States as activities of th© Office of Economic Opportunity or
any other federal agency, that it is within the definition a
federal agency.

QUESTION s

Of the United States government.

MR. PFAU:

— of the United States government, and

the Federal Tort Claims Act specifically provides that though
the employ®® be only temporary, if he is an on an activity of
fch© united States government, he is an employe© of the United
Statas and covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act, yes, Your
Honor.

The Mayor could very readily wear two hats as corporate

president, as many people do, and work for more than on© person
on different occasions.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't there some provision in this

Act that members cf the board cannot be employees?
MR. PFAU:

Yes, Your Honor.

Members of the Office of

Economic Opportunity cannot ba employees, obviously to prevent
political interference and that sort ©f thing.
The employees — we believe that this activity, th©
Warren-Trumbull Council of th© OEO, was an instrumentality or
agency of th® United states and, if so, that makes this differ­
ence :

If it is a corporation acting primarily as an instrumen­

tality or agency of the United states, it would ba assumed that
that corporation, would control largely th© day-to-day activities
of its employees.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Pfau, isn't there a certain incongruity

if Mr. Sachs®5s right, that says that Congress' basic intent, in

34
talking about instrumentalities of the Uni tad States, corpora­
tions of the United States, the Reconstruction Finance Corpora­
tion, th© Commodity Credit Corporation, all kind of national
operations based in Washington, and than you say this too is
that, and it is one of apparently 800 similar entities, each
localized in a small part of on© of the states?
MR. PFAU:

There is no limitation in the Act to cor­

porations of the nature pointed out by Mr. Sachs®, and 'the
Congress specifically considered limiting th© Act to such cor­
porations and saw fit not to do so.

Now, if the facte of this

case ara looked at, you will see this corporation is acting on
the local basis as an agency of the United States, it is acting
primarily for th® United States.

It is in effect on© of the

platoons that is enlisted by Congress to carry on th© war on

MR. PFAUs

Well, Job Corps members were appointed

The rather re­

markable thing is this phrase "primarily acting as an instru­

by this Court before.

It would appear that 'that is language

that should be giv-m its plain meaning.

Astonishingly, Your Honor, there have not

Thera have been a few cases where that phrase has been

used, but the cases have not. some to grips with saying what is
— how is this to be defined.

The Court says it is an instru­

mentality, it is not, but we have cited in our brief the Law
Edition 3d annotation covering this entire subject, arid the
cases ara unbaliav;bly absent in any real coming to grips with
that term.

No court has said what an instrumentality should bra,

for instance, that, it should be given its plain meaning.
Given it.-- plain meaning, it seems clear that this
corporation was an instrumentality, and these corporations which
wers raised were instrumentalities.

Even if they were not, a

significant case was decided, Buchanan v. United States, Mr.
Justice Blackxnun wrote the opinion and outlined independent
contractor relationship.

In that case, the Federal Carthage

Corporation had a contract to maintain an arsenal, and there
wasn't any question in that case but what there was a contract,
Nevertheless, notwithstanding the presence of the contract, tha
Court considered the amount of control that was exercised,

in

that case, respondent respectfully submits? had there been the
same control over the Federal Carthage Corporation as there was
over this community action agency? had there been, as there is
her©? some 10 or 15 columns of guidelines and instructions —
which ar@ on file with the Court ~ that yellow stack this high
— had there bean 80 or 90 pages of federal regulations and 30
or 40 pages of statutes controlling just how everything should
be, controlling not only from the governing board — suppose in
