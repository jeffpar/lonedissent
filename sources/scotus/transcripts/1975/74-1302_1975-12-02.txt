ORAL ARGUMENT OF Ro R. McMAHAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TURNER ELKHORN MINING CO., ET AL.
MR. McMAIIANx

Mr. Chief Justice, may it pleas® the

Courts
Th@ issue raised by these cross-appeals is one of the
constitutional rationality of the means that Congress has chosen
* t

to achieve the purposes, clearly the legitimate purposes, of
the Black Lung Benefits

provisions of the Coal Mina Health arid

Safety Act of 1969.
The Coal Mine Health and Safety Act, as counsel for
the government no doubt will point out to you in much greater
length, was originally conceived and enacted to redress some
very real grievances among mine workers.

It was

designed, at

its original conception, to deal with health and safety
aspects of mining, to control dust, levels, to prevent accidents.
Later, toward the end of the congressional consideration of the
legislation, provisions were inserted for providing economic
relief to disabled, retired coal miners, principally in the
Southern United States.
Then, at the very end of the consideration of the Act,

4
provisions ware inserted to create a workmen*s compensation
program, a fairly elaborate three-part program, the third part
of which would impose liability on former and present employers
of retired and active coal mine workers suffering from
occupational disease, a single occupational disease known as
coal workers* pneumoconiosis? a disease which is caused by
breathing dust.
The disease actually is a physiological condition that
develops from breathing dust at certain levels and certain
concentrations over given periods of time.

The more dust that

is breathed, the longer it is breathed, the more likely it is
that the disease will develop»
This suit arose out of a — this appeal aros© out of
a suit brought by 22 mine operators in ■ the Eastern District
of Kentucky to enjoin the enforcement of the legislation, the
workman’s compensation provisions of the legislation.
The three-judge court in 'the Eastern District upheld
the major portions of the law against plaintiffs* attack?
plaintiffs!* challenge to their validity under the due process
clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.
The court, however, did strike down two presumptive
provisions that were included in the law, and I will describe
those in greater detail.

That is why these cases are before

the Court now on cross-appeal.
The Act, the benefits provisions of the Act, which is

/

5

all that we are concerned with here today, create s three-part
program, the first part beginning in — well- the first part
ending in June, the end of June of 1973, 'under which former
and present coal min© ■ employees could apply for benefits which
would foe paid by the federal government -through the Department
of Health, Education.- and Welfare, administered by the Social
Security Administration»
The six months f©liming fcha and of that program,
which will be referred to her® frequently as the Part B
program, involved a dual administration of claims for benefits
to be carried out by the Department of Labor and HEW jointly?
the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare establishing
the benefits, the diagnostic criteria, the medical criteria,
for determining whether a miner or a former miner has the
disability occupational disease the Act was designed to cover»
Claimants filing within -that time would b© paid by
the government for sis?, months, and thereafter by a former
employer or present employer, a coal mine operator»
The crucial part of this legislation, and 'the part
that plaintiffs here consider constitutionally objectionable is
Part C of the Act, which imposes upon mine operators, the
former employers of former miners and the present employers of
present miners, ‘the obligation to pay benefits in connection
with this single occupational disease»
Plaintiffs maintain that, to the extent that this

s
portion of the Act indiscriminately imposes liability for
former ~~ for the claims of former employees based upon
employment periods that are terminated long prior to the
enactment of the legislation, that it constitutas a completely
irrational means for achieving what is admittedly the legitimate
purpose of providing economic relief to a large population of
elderly retired and ill coal miners and their survivors»
QUESTIONS

Mrc McMahan, are you talking now about

those who were employed by a particular mining operator and
who are presumed to have contracted the disease during the period
of -that employment, although their symptoms showed much later?
MR» McMAHANs

I*ra talking about r.l! applicants for

benefits, payable by a former employer, whose employment
terminated prior to the enactment of the law that imposed tills
obligation»
It must be recognised in this case that this is not
a typical workmen's compensation law that imposes liability
in respect of occupational d:.s@ase that develops after an
employment relationship has terminated, when there has been a
workmen's compensation law in effect during the employment
relationship»
Now, there's no question that that is a rational
legislative program, because an employer, if he knows that the
liability, potential liability is -there, can insure against it
and then it doesn't make any difference if the disability

7
results, the work-related disability results following termina­
tion of the employment*
That is not. the case her©*
What this law has done# what Congress has done# has
lost sight of the fact that in attempting to accomplish two
purposes here# through the us® of workmen8a compensation type
law# that they have chosen a completely irrational means of
delivering relief to former retired miners„
QUESTIONt
it*

Well, I don't se© what’s irrational about

Certainly the retired miners are getting the money*

I

take it your contention of irrationality tends from who — is
based on the source of the money*
MRo McMAHAN:

Yes# my contention — unless the Court

is prepared to accept that the only question of rationality
here is whether the money actually reaches the miners# I think
that the means has to be examined more carefully*

And w© say

•that it is irrational t© single out former employers to deliver
what is really economic relief# as a result of disability due
to a disease which no one knew existed in 'the United States at
the time these men were employed, and that has been recognised
repeatedly in the legislative history of the Act as being a
national obligation, recognised as being a moral, obligation,
by -the government —
QUESTIONt

But those are just suggesting different

ways Congress might have treated it*

Isn't our scope of

e
inquiry extremely narrow hera, so that w® would have to say,
in effect, that Congress just lost its head whan it passed this
statute, in order to hold it unconstitutional?
MR» McMAHAN;

1 think that the scope of the inquiry

her© is narrow, but not as narrow as it would fo© in the case
of more conventional economic regulatory legislation»
1 think that the means chosen by Congress to deliver
relief to these former and retired miners in this instance
deserve a closer scrutiny because it involves the suspect
imposition of new rights and obligations on transactions, and
on the basis of conduct that was closed in the past»
QUESTION*

What*s suspect about it?

MR» McMAHAN s

It is suspect because this Court has

recognised that laws that have that effect are suspect, not
necessarily unconstitutional!; but worthy of close examination,
QUESTION* Well, are coal mine operators now in the
classification of racial minorities and aliens?
MR, McKAHANs

No, certainly not» But coal min®

operators, to the extent that they are now being held responsible
to pay tenet'its to former employees in connection with exposure
in the production of a product in Hie past, and the creation of
a diseas© that could, not be anticipated, and could not be
passed on, the pricing are carved out as a class»
I am not -•»
QUESTION:

Well, what is your constitutional argument?

9

What clause of the Constitution?
MR, McMAHANz

Is it a due process argument?

The due process and the equal protection.

In this area they merge# as the Court well knows.
process in the sens®

that a workman

It is due

our contention is that

& workmen's compensation law is an irrational means# no matter
upon what basis it is analysed? it is an irrational means for
delivering benefits to parsons who were not in the work force
at the time that the law was passed.
It might well be a rational means to impose this
burden# this economic burden on the industry as a whole,
QUESTION8

Well# tills is your best and only constitu­

tional argument# irrationality of the means to achieve this
end?
MR, McMAIIAN*

No# there is — we also argue that

carving out former employers within the industry as a class#
to bear the burden and to bear the arbitrary consequences of
that that burden will have# competitive consequences, is
an irrational classification,
QUESTIONS

Well# that still is irrationality is your

argument,
MS, McMAHANs

That is ©ur argument as far as the#

what, has com© to be known as 'the retroactive provisions of the
law go,
QUESTION;

Don't you also# in effect# argue that

you're being deprived of your property without due process of

10

law?
MR» McMAHAN*

Y©s# that’s implicit in the whole

irrationality argumento
We do not *— we contend that the irrationality of
the means chosen is what deprives us of our property»

No*

there is no contention that we'r® suffering any other depriva­
tion # for lack of due process»
But it’s definitely the property, a definite property
deprivation is occurring»
QUESTIONs

Are you saying the government is **>« are

you relying on that other part ©f the Fifth Amendment that «—
in saying the government is taking your property without
adequate compensation?
MR» McMAHANs

You’re not relying on that, are you?
No»

No»

I'm saying that we are

suffering the deprivation of property by the enforcement against,
us of irrational legislation? and discriminatory —
QUESTIONS

You’re being- irrationally deprived of your

property«
MR» McMAHANs
QUESTIONS
proposition

That's correct»

Well, is part of the irrationality the

this is a question to you

that it is

irrational to put all the liability in one place, where it. sight
have derived from many places?
MR» McMAHANs

The responsibility# -the fault»

The crux of the irrationality of the

workmen’s compensation approach in trying to serve these two

11
different ends is that workmen's compensation law cannot
rationally function to spread that risk*, when you’re dealing
with former employers 0
Now, the reason that is irrational, and we think
unconstitutional' irrational, as a means is that it will have an
impact, -that is entirely unwarranted and unnecessary»

And a

competitive impact on present mine operators will impose
economic obligations on them to pay very large benefits in
respect of work forces in the past that may have been very
much larger»
QUESTION?

What happens to a coal mine operator who

wont into business, let’s say the year, six months or two
months before the Act took effect., and hir work force includes
men who have been in ‘the mining work for twenty or thirty
years? to what extent is he liable for the totality of their
condition?
MR,, McMAHANs

I think actively tinder this Act he'd

become almost immediately liable to pay benefits to all of them»
QUESTION'S Even though he just went into business,
the mining business?
MR» McMAHANs

Yes.

Principally because anyone who

has been in the work force 'that long could qualify, virtually
anyone could qualify under ‘the Act for benefits, and the Act
attaches liability to active work forces on the basis of the
present employer or -the last responsible operator, as ‘the concept

12

in the Acts for whom the claimant has worked for a cumulative
year*
There is a second major basis upon which w-s object
to the constitutionality of the Act, and it applies not only
to liability imposed for paying benefits to former miners, but
to the present miners as well.

And that is the elaborate

presumptions and limitations on medical diagnosis and diagnostic:
criteria included in -the Act, which the government concedes —
this is on© area where wa agree, although we might differ as
to the extant

" concedes is over-inclusive, in the sense that

through the operation of these presumptions in the adjudication
of claims miners who suffer from non-work-related diseases,
respiratory, diseases, and who are not actually totally physically
disabled, may qualify for benefits*
Now, I will be frank that the legislative history
her© is voluminous, and 'the question of whether there is any
occupational disease arising out of the breathing of coal dust
other than coal workers* pneumoconiosis, was subject to dispute*
We believe that if the record were analysed, and if
the proper weight were given to all of the expert testimony,
that we would find that that dispute is more apparent than
real, it's a matter of volume, and that all of the medical
experts in the area, .including principally the Secretary of
Health, Education, and Welfare, and tins Secretary of Labor, the
defendants here, agree that this is the only disease arising

13

out of the breathing of coal dust that can be defined as
occupationally related and disabling.,
But there is evidence in -QUESTIONs

One used to hear a good deal about

silicosis in miners.

Is this a — is that a generic tern' of

which this is a specifically included disease, or is -that
something else?
MR. McMAHANs

Silicosis, as I understand it, is what

— is a much broader form of physical, physiological condition,
and coal workers' pneumoconiosis, until the Fifties in this
country, was thought to be silicosis.

There are — ther© is a

condition or conditions called the pneumoconioses which develop
from breathing dust of various sorts.

Coal workers' pnsumo™

coniosis is an expressly identifiable physiological condition
arising out of the breathing of coal dust, as opposed to flax
dust or stone dust.
The presumptions in this Act are deemed rebuttable,
for the most part.

There is one that the lower court struck

down, which creates a presumption of total disability from a
complicated form of the disease, and the court found that an
irrational presumption because the Act expressly set up
determination, required determination of total disability, of
the existence of the disease, and the total disability from it,
as two separate factors.

I think the court was clearly right in reaching that

14
conclusion.,

I, however, think that the court seriously mis­

applied the law and misunderstood the impact of these presump­
tions, cf the rebuttable presumptions, which are primarily
responsible for the over-inclusiveness of the diagnostic
criteria that the Department of Labor is forced to apply in
its adjudication of claims, and it results in many, many
people, we believe, being paid compensation for diseases such
as chronic bronchitis and emphysema, which exist in 25 percent
of the general population.
There were six percent o£ social security disability
benefits to the general public, that are payable with respect
t© respirable diseases„
It was believed by the Public Health Service and by
the government that when this Act was first enacted, that there
would only be about 53,000 beneficiaries, and that, that would
cost the government about $120 million a year, and to this
point there hav© now been 500,000 people found eligible for
(
benefits, and it5a costing $1 billion, annually.
This is — we do not believe that this is a paradox
resulting from an epidemic of the disease, we think it results
purely from the inclusion of great numbers of people in the
benefits eligibility criteria who simply were not made ill by
coal mining»
Now, this Court has struggled in recent years with
how to treat presumptions, arid especially irrebuttable pre-

15
sumptions, and ©specially implicit presumptions, that we really
don't have that problem in this casse0

These are plain

evidentiary presumptions.
The question is, is there a rational connection
between the fact proved to be proved, to establish the fact to
b® presumed?

And is that preemption, the fact presumed, fairly

rebuttable?
We claim that it isn't fairly rebuttable, that they
aren't fairly rebuttable in this case, because the Congress
has written into the legislation limitations on rebuttal which
make it impossible to distinguish non-work*related respirable
diseases from this single work-related disease»
y

How, if 'this. Court is going to —
QUESTIONS

Mr, McMahan, what if Congress had said,

because of the difficulty in distinguishing between all these
diseases, any former coal miner who comes up with any sort of
a respiratory disease is going <*<*» have to be compensated by
his former employer?

It might not, be this coal minar pneumo­

coniosis, but there is some substantial chance that it might be,
and we're going to resolve doubts in favor of the miner?
MR® McMAHAN s

I think that *— I think that you put

your finger on the crucial problem here»

1 would agree with

you completely that it would be within the power of Congress
to pass a law saying that ail coal miners, past or present,
who have a respirable disease, regardless of whether it's

16

work-related, should ree*aiv© benefits»
But 1 do not think it’s within the authority of
Congress to say that all such persons having such diseases
should be paid by coal Kin© operators»
QUESTIONS Why not?
MR* MCMAHAN*

Because the coal mine operators would

then certainly be singled out as a class to pay benefits to
substantial numbers of parsons who are suffering from a disease
that they would have,, regardless of their coraployment, and it
would be just as rational or irrational to single out .any
class, as long as there is not that n€jxusc
QUESTIONS

Not necessarily, because these people,

let's say, ware employed by the coal miners for a substantial
period ©f time, there's medical evidence that shows that
pneumoconiosis does develop in people so employed, .and it’s
very hard to tall from other respiratory diseases»
New, you're resolving many doubts against the coal
miners? but X don't see how that makes it irrational®
MR» McMAHANs
what»

There you're, changed the question so*-

You are saying that if there is a possibility that

their diseases develop out of coal mining, that that is
sufficient to attach that liability through presumptions*
I think that that is probably a reversal of what,
legislative presumptions have always been designed to do®
Far more often, except in cases of intent or subjective un-

17
determinable questions e presumptions are only appropriate when
they are used to forego evidence of fact that is clearly
inferable# mid for administrative convenienceo
We would submit in this case that where the evidence
— if the Court should only find that the evidence is 50/50 on
whether any other respirable diseases are caused by coal
minin# that finding# in itself# should be sufficient to suggest
that it*s not appropriate for Congress to proceed by presumptions
at all*
Because there is no question# the government will
admit that these same respirable diseases exist in non-mining
employees, in the general population# and therefore there is
no way to determine actual causation? and in that case it
would seem sensible and it would not se@m to impose this
Court's values on Congress at all# to simply say 'feliat this is
a case where# instead of redefining a disease in a way that
no doctor would accept# absent the compulsion of law# simply
say you will compensate for the occupational disease and those
which may or may net ba compensable*
And then# we believe# that if Congress is forced to
do this# it might examine mors carefully the ; legislative means
it chooses to achieve that end# and# in so doing# might# we
hop®# discover that it is not rational to impose that liability
on former employers of those people# that it might more
rationally be imposed on the industry and ultimately on the

18

consumer of the product# or that it might more rationally be
paid out of public funds»

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PARTIES
MR* W&LLACEs

Mr, Chief Justice# and may it please

the Courts
This case brings before the Court issues for re~
examination on plenary review which were decided last term
in the Court’s summary affirmance of a three-judge court
decision in the District of Columbia, in a case called National
Independent Coal Operator’s Association v, Brennan,
The chief difference between the two cases is that
in the National Independent Coal Operator’s Association case,
the three**judge District Court exercised pendent jurisdiction
over challenges to the implementing regulations of this Act#
as well as the statutory challenges# and. upheld both the
statutory provisione at issue and the regulations? and that
judgment was summarily affirmed by this Court,
The three-judge court in the present case declined
to exercise pendent jurisdiction over ‘the challenge to the
regulations.

The issues with respect to the regulations have

been remitted to a single District judge and ar© presently

19
being litigated before him, and reached only the statutory
issues, and for the most part upheld the Act, although in two
respects it ruled that -the Act was unconstitutional, subsequent.
to this Court's summary affirmance last term*
In a way the ease is remines cent also of this Court's
decision last term- in Weinberger v. Salfi, which reiterated and
1

elaborated upon many of the governing principles which we think
apply here»
Congress was faced, in tills legislation with
extensive medical and other evidence developed through a lengthy
series of hearings, both in connection with the 1969 Act and
in connection with the 1972 amendments, which were concerned
only with the compensation aspects of the program»
With th© problems of respiratory diseases among
coal miners, and particularly pneumoconiosis, which is a chronic
disease, an irreversible disease, which in its later stages
becomes progressive and inevitably fatal.

It’s true teat

Congress first gave attention to these problems in the 1960's,
and found at that time the State Workmen's compensation laws
were grossly inadequate to take care of these problems? but the
disease wasn't entirely unknown up until teat time, it was
first recognised in England and elsewhere in Europe in the
1930*8, as th© hearings pointed out.
So I do take exception to the statement that no coal
mine q>erator could have known of these dangers for th© miners.

20
And it came to be recognized in the medical profession in this
country in the 1950*so
Be that as it may, it was in the late 1960’s and
again in the early Seventies that. Congress attempted to find a
legislative solution to th®s© serious problems»
And in doing so, Congress was concerned, first of all,
to strike a proper balance of the burden between th© Federal
Treasury, the industry, and Idle victims of tills disease in
attempting to provide for th© very large backlog of cases
that had not previously been provided for»
We have summarised some of th® results of th© balance
Congress struck on page 25 of our brief»

The figures at th®

top, in th© hundreds of thousands, are figures that have been
brought into the part of the program paid for entirely from the
Federal Treasury, with respect to the compensation claims„
352,000 ©f these claims have been approved out of 550,000
applied for»
Then you gat down, in the second paragraph on page
25, to the portion of th© burden, a prospective burden largely,
which Congress thought fit to assign to the industry, and
we’re talking about 70,000 claims that have been filed thus
far, with an. estimated yearly rate of five to six thousand
claims, and of th© 70,000 claims filed, only 21»6 parcent have
been approved for payment»
The approvals are running at a rat© slightly above

21

20 percent» ■
Many of them are claims •that were already rejected
under the federally financed portion of the program»
Congress was solicitious toward the industry, and,
particularly as a result of the 1972 amendments, set up the
program s© that it® s doubtful if my truly retroactive claims
will fca mad© against, any of the companies because of the
three-year statuta of limitations and the extension of the
fad@ral.ly financed portion of theprogram to three and a

half

years, followed then by a half-year transitional program,
partially financed by the Federal Treasury»
We have, on pages 30 and 31 of our brief, noted that
retrospective aspects to legislation do not necessarily
invalidate it»

Far from it, there ar® numerous cases cited

there, and in footnote 29 of the brief, in which the Court has
upheld retrospective application of laws in appropriate
circumstances.
QUESTIONS

Well, if I could go back a moment to

what, you were saying earlier, I notice at 'bit© top of page 26
you have a statement that 97 percent of these cases have been
where an administrativa review has been sought»
MR» WALLACBs

That is correct»

QUESTIONS And only 12 of them reviewed ; so fan why
is that?
MR» WALLACEs

By the Review Board»

Well, these

\

22

proceedings can be lengthy *

It was anticipated at the time

they were established that the awards would not be contested,
in so large a percentage of cases, and as a matter of fact
V*-

Congress was hopeful * in enacting this legislation, 'that it
would be temporary legislation, that State Workman’s Compensa­
tion laws would be amended to make adequate provision for this
disease, and that a federal program would not fa@ necessary*
QUESTION? And that’s not happening yet?
MR* WALLACES That is not happening, Your Honor?
far from it,
QUESTIONS

Well, conventional workmen's compensation

can hardly take ear© of this problem*

This is basically

r@paratis.ons, isn't it?
MR,, WALLACES Wall, for the
QUESTION:

I mean, 'this part of the legislation*

MR* WALLACES For the former miners, yes*
QUESTION s

Yes*

But future, of course, ordinary conventional workmen's
compensation can. take car© of it*
Wall, we’re not dealing here with that aspect? are
we?
MR* WALLACEs

Well, we're not in the principal

challenge here, although the figures ’that Mr* Justice Brennan
is referring to ar© the figures from Part C of the program,
which has just taken effect quite recently*

23

QUESTION? And that is workmen*s compensation0
MR., WALLACES

Tli at is — yes# to at5 s the part that

is financed under Workman's Compensation Insurance by the
former employers,
QUESTIONS

And that's the five to six thousand

annual claims now being made?
MR, WALLACEs
QUESTIONS

That is correct# Mr, Justice,

And 97 percent of all determinations are

being appealed?
MR, WALLACE* They are being administratively appealed.
Now# this is the early administration of the Act#
at. a time whan the constitutionality has not been authorita­
tively settled# even after we won summary affirmance by this
Court# mid perhaps there won't be quite as many appeals one®
the matter is «*«
QUESTION *

Is there a reason# Mr, Wallace# why it

takes so long to try one of these administrative reviews?
MR, WALLACE*

Well# non® that X could give you,

I can’t say X*ve looked into that question with any depth,
QUESTIONs

Well# it seems such a small number.# only

12,
MR, WALLACE*

Yes, I'm sure they are progressing now.

At the time toe brief was written# this part of the Act had
bean in effect e. relatively short time.

And the jurisdiction

was moving over to the Department of Labor from «*»

24
QUESTIONS

But for the States to pick this up as

part of the State Workman’s Compensation systems„ would amend­
ments of State laws be required?
MR, WALLACES

That is correct,

QUESTION? And the States are simply not amending

MR, WALLACES

Some amendments ar® being made# but not

amendments that meet the federal statutory standard that would
remove the federal program -**
QUESTIONS

Is this limited to a few Statas?

MR, WALLACE?

No# it’s quit© a few.

As a matter of

fact# it*s a nationwide program when the miners# they may have
moved to any State,

But —

QUESTIONS

But I mean of the current ones* the five

to six thousand a year.

Would they still be widespread through

out the country?
MR, WALLACE s

I think there are about 25 States in

which there is some coal mining that amounts to something,
I haven’t really looked into that figure,

but I am getting an

affirmative nod here,
QUESTIONS Well# it's really not important,
QUESTIONs

Mr, Wallace# did I understand you to say

earlier that you thought there would be relatively few claims
made on a retroactive process?
MR, WALLACE;

Well# on a truly retroactive basis# —

QUESTIONS

HOW would you define retroactive basis

here?
MR. WALLACES That would be a claim against the
former employer which had fully ripened before enactment of the
statute,,

In other words, the disease had become manifesto
QUESTIONS

The employee must have ceased to b© a

miner before the effective date of the Act, and must have made
his claim of disability after the affective date, is the way
I understood your brief.
MRo WALLACE s

As what we would consider a completely

retroactive claim for purposes of the usual way of looking at
tort and workmen's compensation laws, would

be a claim by an

employee, a former employee- who knew he had the disease, at
least should have known it, that the symptoms arose prior to
the enactment of the Act.
That’s when the claim ripens.

There's a long time

between contraction of this disease and its detection.

And

because the Act is set up with a three-year statute of limita­
tions, and it isn’t until three and a half years after its
enactment that employer liability cornea into the picture.
QUESTIONS

There’s a reference in the brief to an

employee who quit, being a coal miner in 1920.

When does the

statute of limitations run as to him, for example?

Three

years from -the date of the effective date of tee Act?
MR. WALLACEs

Three years from when the disease

26
becomes manifest, to him.

That doesn't mean a medical diagnosis

©f it# but. it's when the symptoms become manifest# and that he
would know he had the disease»

And it's very unlikely that it

would have that long an incubation period# if he didn’t, expose
himself to coal dust;»
QUESTION;

But do til© presumptions, the irrebuttable

presumptions operate against the man who comes in with a claim
20, 30, 40 years old, in his favor?
MR» WALLACES

Well, the presumption would operate if

he's spent the requisite amount of time in, th© mine»
QUESTIONS

Y©s„

MR» WALLACE?

The prastsmpations are a matter of

evidentiary proof, to which I'll turn in a moment»
QUESTION?

And there are claims in the brief

already, if th*? -Trims have boon filed as my brother Powell says,
by people who left th© coal mines in the Twenties or in the
Thirties or in the Forties, and the benefits run not only to
these people, if they're alive, but also to their widows and
whiidren, do they not?
MR» WALLACE?

Until th© Act, until the expiration

data, which is now December 30, 1981, and it may be amended»
QUESTIONS

Is that true even if emphysema might

be the disease they really have?
MR» WALLACES Well, that’s a matter of proof»

meet the standards of proof, the Act awards benefits only for

sum total of his argument»
That the presumptions &r© going to reach a great many
people here»
MR» WALLACE?
now»

Well, if we*11 turn to the presumptions

Congress -.res faced with the. problem under this Act of a

disease that is difficult to prove and difficult to disprove,
and it wanted to set up what it thought would be a fair system
of compromising between bringing more people into eligibility

28

than an ideal system might bring, make eligible for the
benefits if proof were easier, and denying benefits to those
that it felt needed them? and that it wanted to help»

And so

it set up a scheme which we have tried to summarise briefly on
pages 37 and 38 of our brief»
Let me talk first about the evidentiary presumptions ,
which are the ones that begin at the bottom of page 37, and
the first 'thing to be said about them is I don't think that:
the scheme of the Act was fully understood by the District
Court in its concern about these presumptions,

It seamed to

overlook or fail to understand that Section 422(c) of the
Act contains a proviso that is applicable to any claim for
benefits against any operator# and that is on page 7a of
the appendix to the consolidated brief for the plaintiffs in
tills case, and that proviso says that no benefits shall be
payable by any operator on account of death or total disability
du© to pneumoconiosis which did not arise at least in part
out of employment in a mine during the period when it was
operated by such, operator«>
So that there's always the possibility of making a
defense to any of these claims, to begin with, by showing that
the conditions in your mind were such -that pneumoconiosis
could not have been contracted by the clai: ;ant in your mind»
Second, the Court seemed to overlook that -these
evidentiary presumptions attach only after the elements that

23

triggered them have been established in an administrative
hearing in which the employer is free to participate and
contest the existence of those elements»

So we’re not talking

about failure of an opportunity for the employer to contest any
of these matters?, but the first of the presumptions applying ~~
as we summarize it on page 38 —- (a) theres

a miner who has

worked in the mines for ten years or more and shows that he
has contracted pneumoconiosis, and that proof can be
contested as to whether or not he actually has that disease»
And that is the disease that is occupationally related only
to work in the coal mines.

Then there is a rebuttable

presumption —
QUESTION;

Then, Mr, Wallace, he has to prove in any

©vent, when h® sues a particular operator, that at some timeha worked for that operator,
MR,, WALLACEs

Oh, yes, definitely, then he can

contest it also,
QUESTION %

Then, had he worked for some operator who

has long sine© disappeared, that’s the only one, so he could
recover from nobody,
MR» WALLACE?

That is a problem under the current Act,

and Congress has amendments under consideration now,
QUESTIONs

I s@e»
{

L

MR» WALLACE; They may change the whole scheme of it
for the future. They are considering setting up an industrywide

■30

fundo

There have been hearings held this year on that»
QUESTIONs

But to pursue that# if he had worked for

one operator for two years and another operator for thirty
years# and the thirty-year operator was out of business# who
pays the bill?
MRo WALLACES

Under the regulations he could still

make a claim for liability against the one who is still in
business,,

But -QUESTION?

The one for two years?

MR,, WALLACE?

~~ the question of who is liable is

remitted by the Act entirely as a solution in the regulations #
the regulations are not before the C^Ua. bo
The only thing that’s established in the Act are
methods of showing eligibility„

The question of who# then# is

liable to pay the benefits is a matter that's been worked out
in the regulations,
QUESTION:

Well# if there are only two# and one of

them is gone,, the answer is very simple# isn’t it?
MR„ WALLACE?

Yes# ’the regulations say the last

one that you worked for is presumed to be the one that has to
pay if you worked a year there.

But if he can show that you

couldn’t have contracted the disease in his mines because of
conditions in his mines# then it reverts back to the next on©
before him# if 1 understand the regulation,,
As I say# the validity of the regulations are not

31
before the Court in this case.
QUESTIONS

Well? there is before the Court in this

case, of course, who is going to pay for this.

If this —« we

wouldn't even have a problem if the Good Lord was going to pay
for thisi the people who ar© hurt are the people who are
paying it.
MR. WALLACE:

Congress decided that eligibility for

compensation from the industry can be established this way#
and who in the industry pays is worked out in the regulations.
That's *»QUESTION?

But the point is# we know it's not

industrywide# it's not a charge on the industry as a whole.

MR. WALLACE?

No# it's the particular former

QUESTION? Right.

tions.

— • who is singled out in the regula­

But these provisions that ara at issue are the

provisions about how you establish eligibility for benefits.
QUESTIONs

All right# take a claimant against a

particular employer, where that employer proved he was only a
desk clerk# never exposed to any of these conditions? then he
left that employer and went to another employer# worked for
him for thirty years and was exposed# contracted the disease#
he could not recover if the second, employer is out of
business.

32

HR. WALLACE s Well,, of course - this is always a
defense to the award of benefits against a particular employer»
That’s showing that h© couldn’t have contracted pneumoconiosis
in the work that h© did for you»
QUESTIONS

Mr» Wallace, taking examples like this,

doas the Act provide for this sort of situation?
depleting product, obviously»

Coal is a

You would have a mining company

that, 20 or 25 years ago, may have had a thousand employees?
it may have gradually depleted its coal, and today may have
50 to 100 employees»

Is it not possible that that miner might

have more claimants than it has employees today?
MR0 WALLACES
QUESTIONS

It is possible.

Is there anything that would protect that

company from being put out of business by claims as against,
which it has had no opportunity to set up .reserves or carry
insurance?
MR,, WALLACE?

It is possible that an instance could

arise in which a company could be put out of business» The
main protection against it is the fact that the three and a
half year period of exclusives federal responsibility was set
up to take care of the backlog of former employees»
principal part of the backlog.

The

And it would have had to be a

very rapid reduction in a company’s employment that would
result in the situation .that you are mentioning»
And this problem has been complained of by the

33
industry and it’s one that Congress considered»

And on® may

agree or disagree with the solution that Congress reached, but
I -fchink th© Court's decisions make it clear that putting someone
out of business for an appropriate reason in the public interest,
is not a constitutional violation»
Ferguson v» Skrup-a was»

That’s exactly what

A complaint by someone who was in the

debt adjusting business, that a new State statute saying that
only lawyers could be in that, business, was depriving him of
his rightful occupation? and that he was a fine, upstanding
businessman providing a service to -the community»
The Court unanimously held that that’s a legislative
concern, whether it’s in the public interest to restrict that
business in the circumstances that concern the Legislature»
So I really think it’s a legislative argument rather
than a constitutional one —
QUESTION:

Well, what do you --

MR» WALLACE:
more than others»

that some companies will b© hurt-

It’s very reminescent of the argument in

Williamson v» Leo Optical Company, that competition was being
affected between -die makers of prescription glasses and the
makers of ready-to-wear glasses by applying the regulation only
to the maker of prescription glasses»
QUESTION:

Of cour-3®, it may be ons Idling to be put

out of business just in the sense of not being able to carry on
your traditional occupation, but another thing to be put out of

34
business by having a large indebtedness which you’re unable to
pay saddled on you.
MR. WALLACE s

But if it results from the fact that

it was through working for you that these injuries were
incurred, through your profit-making activities, it’s a per­
missible legislative judgment that that burden should be placed
on a company»
QUESTIONs

You can answer Justice Relinquish’s

question, proposition, for which by traditional due process
standards no recovery might be had in some of those cases»
MR» WALLACES

That, and then there’s another legis­

lative solution undoubtedly would be found for such examples»
But I do want to point out that these are, at the
moment, highly speculativa concerns»

The brief, an amicus

brief filed in our support by the United Mine Workers of
America, points out quits cogently, beginning on page 13 of that,
brief, through page 17, that the economic impact thus far has
been minimal»
And it cites hearings in 1973 that first began con­
sideration of amendments in which it was reported that all of
the companies have thus far been enabled to provide additional
workmen's compensation coverage under their regular Workmen’s
Compensation insurance, and the increases in premiums thus far
have been modest and, in. -the case of Kentucky, nonexistent
thus far.

3.5
QUESTIONs

Is it true, Mr. Wallace, from what you

suggested earlier- that the government takes on the whole
financial burden for the first three and a half years, under
the A Part of the program?
MR» WALLACE%

QUESTton»

Yes„ largely.

And that that Itself has had the effect

of minimizing the financial burden ~
MR. WALLACEz

By and large it has, end of course

th© industry is in a relatively strong economic position now,
as was pointed out quite persuasively in a footnote in the
same brief.

That's footnote 37 on page IS of that brief,

dealing with th© recent profits of some of the plaintiffs
here.

QUESTION;
MR. WALLACE;

Is that 37?
Footnote 37, yes, Your Honor.

But, in addition to that, there is some time lag
involved here, which is true of doing business under any
workmen’s compensation scheme.

And this takes us back to the

retroactivity argument for a moment.

The plaintiffs' brief

in this Court is premised on the notion that in order for a
program to be fair, it must apply only to current employees,
so that while they are doing work, the company can price its
products in a manner that will cover the cost of compensating
them.
But that isn’t actually the way workmen’s compensation

36

laws work in the economy at all»
The feet is* insurance rates are adjusted after
claims experience will cause them to he adjusted upwards.,
QUESTIONS

You don’t suggest ‘that the accountants who

handle the work for ‘these employers don’t set up reserves to
take this into account on the pricing?
MR, WALLACE;

Undoubtedly they set up reserves as

best ’they can to anticipate these matters 0 But the fact of the
matter is if they had a large number of workers disabled*
I

through injury* in the employment* who become no longer
employees* it’s only in the following year that what is known
in the industry as retrospective rating will cause an increase
in tlie.tr workmen’s compensation premiums0
And any impact that toe company feels comes after
these people are no longer employees»

There was no extra

cost that toe company had to pay while they were employees»
QUESTION:

It’s not true of a self-insurer* though»

MR, WALLACE:

It’s not true of a self-insurer* but

the prevalent practice is that there’s a retrospective effect
that’s very similar to to© effect under this statute»
Not only that* but the argument by analogy would
carry over to increases in benefits to be paid to former
?
employees* which Congress* inextriodically* because of the
severa inflation that we've had* for workers who have been
disabled under the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Act* this

37

program has an automatic escalator feature* . It says that the
compensation shall be one-half of what a disabled government
worker, Grad© GS-2, will receive,,

That goes up as inflation

goes up»
And, by analogy, the same argument could be mad©
with respect to any of these increases.

The retroactivity

argument would really h© an argument that would frees© the
benefits to be paid based on contributions that may be — and
salaries that may he woefully out of dates in terms of the
living costs fur disabled persons»
It's commonplace to have these increases under State
Workmen’s Compensation laws, and they’re not even challenged,
QUESTIONS Well, I -think the challenge here is not
to what the claimants get# but, rather, who has to pay»
What do you conceive to be the provision of the
Constituti.on that’s in issue here?
MR» WALLACEi Well, the only provision that’s been
referred to is the Fifth Amendment due process clause *—
QUESTIONS
MR, WALLACE;

Substantive due process?
Well, it seems to me that it basically

is substantive due process»
QUESTION; Well, that’s my question»
MR» WALLACE;

It seems to me basically a substantive

due process claim of the kind that was mad® in Ferguson v«
Skrupa, Williamson ?. Lea Optical Company, that an unfair

38

burden is being placed on particular compatitors in the economy.
QUESTIONS Do you think -« and you say that that’s
really an invalid constitutional claim, almost, a frivolous on©?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, I basically think that the

arguments are legislative argumenta, even if soma of the
premises of th.?™ w-sren*t faulty, which it seems to me they are.
That workmen’s compensation typically has retrospect
tiv® consequences, and it*s long been upheld in that context,
anyway.
But even if the premises weren’t faulty, it seems to
be to be a legislative rather than a constitutional ««
QUESTIONS Well, what if Congress her® had set up
these benefits and these same presumptions, and then said that
the payments ar® to be mad®, th© people who ar© going to b®
financially responsible for paying these are all th©
corporations in the United States whose names, corporate names
begin with the first thirteen letters of the alphabet?
MR. WALLACES

Well, but there’s nothing arbitrary

of that nature involved her®.
QUESTIONt Well, let’s take my hypothetical cas®,
would that be constitutionally invalid?
MR. WALLACES Wall, I don’t, like to concede away th®
powers of Congress, but certainly there would be a much more
substantial argument in that ~«QUESTIONS

Under what provision of the Constitution?

39

MR« WALLACE %

It would be under that provision , under

th© Fifth Amendment due process clause, because it’s hard to
see any other provision -that would be valido
It might be upheld as & taxing provision, and I
don't say it's necessarily constitutionally vulnerable»

But

her© you've got a system that is rationally based in the sense
that it's tied «—» it's compensation for a work™relatad disease
by definition, arid th© only people who can possibly be liable
ar© employers who subjected th® claimant to the risk of that
disease»
And adjustments have been made in th© kind of medical
evidence that will carry various kinds of weight because of
det&ilad medical testimony before Congress that showed that
certain kinds of evidence, such as X-rays, ar© not in them­
selves reliable»

be proved that you have this disease»

And there's an opportunity

to contest all of these other kinds of medical evidence»

MR» WALLACE:

That would be a permissible legislative

means of taking care of this problem»
But I do think it should be recognized that there is
nothing novel in workman’s compensation about presumption»
The ordinary rule in workmen's compensation is feat if you can
show the injury, it's presumed that it arose out of your employ­
ment.

And it’s up to the employer to rebut that»
In a way* fee first of the evidentiary presumptions

41
cuts back on that rule, by saying that you have to show also
that you. were employed for ten years in the coal min© in order
for that presumption to coins into force .
In the ordinary ‘workmen's compensation case, all you
have to show is that you had the injury, and it would be
presumed that it arose out of your employment, unless that war©
rebuttedo
Thor©’s nothing that novel about this scheme of
compensating injured employees,

Do you have anything

further, Mr. McMahan?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF R. R. McMAHAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TURNER ELKHORN MINING CO. , ET AL.
MR. McMAHANs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
I would only feel compelled to clear up a vary
dangerous and nti^raken impression that counsel for the
government has left you with.
The Part C program, to answer Mr. Justice Stewart’s
question, the Part C program is not just a compensation program.
The Part C program is a reparations program,
This business about the three years* statute of
limitations is an illusion.

It’s an illusion for substantial

numbers of these former miners8 claims, because the Act has
redefined the disease

42

Now, that means, in affect, that a man could have
had emphysema for thirty years»
the Forties,

Ha could hav© quit mining in

He could hav© been diagnosed as having emphysema

for thirty years.

But he can com® in and qualify for benefits

under this Act because the three years runs from discovery of
the diseaser and suddenly his emphysema is diagnosed under
this Act as coal

worker's pneumoconiosis.

We have many, many claims against the 22 plaintiffs
in this case? soma 80 percent so far &r© from people who have
not worked in mining for years and yeans prior to the enactment
of the law.
This is not at all comparable to retrospective rating
or adjusting your insurance rates from year to year, even if
you happen to bo on© of the few operators in on© of the few
States that allows that kind of compensation.

This is purely

reparation, and we believe that it's an irrational — that
this legislation is an irrational way of delivering those
reparations,
