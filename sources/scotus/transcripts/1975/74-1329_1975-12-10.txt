MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

next in No. 74-1323, Hymes against The Mayor and Council of
the Borough of Oradell.
Mr’. Taylor, it's good to sea you back here again.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF TELFORD TAYLOR ON
BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. TAYLOR:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and Members of

This is an appeal from a decision of the Supreme

Court of New Jersey , which upheld against, Federal constitu­
tional challenge a municipal ordinance which requires that any
person who wishes to call from house to house in support of
a political campaign or cause must first identify himself
with the municipal police in writing.
Probable jurisdiction was noted at the past term of
court.
Now, your Honors, there ar© one or two twists in the
litigation history of "the cas© which are irrelevant to the
posture in which the cas® now comes before, the Court and
which I believe and hop© are adequately explained in the
statement in our brief to which I believe my brother at the
bar here has taken no exception.

So I am going to content

myself with a very brief summary which I hope the Court will
find sufficient.
The defendant appellee here, the Borough of Oradell,

4
has.S> at least since 197-1,had what has. come to b® known as fch®
Green River Ordinance affecting house-to-house calling by
commercial solicitors, salesmen,, solicitors for commercial
purposes.

That, being the local state of the law in Grade 11

in March of 1973, the appellant Hynes, who was then a member
of the New Jersey Assembly and a candidate for renomination
and reelection and to whose constituency th® Borough of 0rads2.11
had just been added by a statewide r©apportionment, in March
of 1973 Hynes went to Oradell and commenced campaigning from
house to house.

The police accosted him and made him

stop canvassing and asked him to leave the borough, although
of course, th© ordinance than in effect did not cover his
situation at. all.
A very few weeks after that, the Borough of Oradell
enacted th© ordinance extending its coverage to solicitors for
charitable contributions and any person canvassing

for a

political campaign or cause.
QUESTIONS

Incidentally, Mr. Taylor, is Mr

Hynes

a Democrat or a Republican?
MR. TAYLOR;
QUESTION:
MR. TAYLOR:

Mr, Hynes is a Democrat, your Honor.
And Oradell isn't.
To th® best of ray knowledge it is not.

I suppose those things can fluctuate.
The ordinance having been enacted, the appellant.
Hynes and four other plaintiffs, likewise appellants here, who

5

were residents of Grade 11

Hynes himself was not, though

Grade11 was part of th® constituency — brought a suit for
declaratory and injunctive relief focusing their complaint
under tarn First and Fourteenth Amendments.
They prevailed in th® lower courts on a combination
of State and Federal grounds, but between the time in th© lower
courts and the time when th© case reached the Supreme Court in
New Jersey, a further amendment to the ordinance eliminated
the state questions, and so the Hew Jersey Supreme Court
reviewed the case squarely on the basis of the Federal
Constitution and upheld th© ordinance by a vote of 5 to 2.
Parenthetically I should note that on th© same day
that they decided this case, they rendered their decision in
the Collingswocd case which involved a wholly different kind
of solicitation ordinance from another borough, and there is
some cross--referancs between th© opinions in the two cases.
Therefore, we have included th® opinion in th® Collingswood
case in our appendix.

That cas® is pending her© on appeal,

and I believe the Court has taken no action on it.
How, th® ordinance in th© form in which th© Supreme
Court of Hew Jersey reviewed it is in our brief on pages 3 and
4 to which I invite the Court's attention for just a moment.
I think the Court will see on page 3 where the "whereas"
1

clauses explain th© purpose of th® ordinances set out, that
the explicit and exclusive purpose of the statute is public

6
safety against crime, the theory being that people on the
pretext of soliciting votes will then engage in breaking end
entering or larceny.
On the operative clause of the ordinance, on page 4,
the Court will see that it covers any person who is canvassing
for charitable cause or for any Federal, state, county, or
municipal political campaign or cause, that such a person must
notify the police department in writing for identification
and that when notification is sufficient for tha duration of
the campaign or cans®.
The penalty clause
QUESTIONs

Mr. Taylor, X may be being picky, but in

the first whereas, surely they don't practice polygamy knowingly
in Grade 11 — ’Whereas, th© Borough is primarily a ore-family
residential town whose citizens ar© employed elsewhere, result­
ing in the wives of the wag© earner being left alone during
th© day»"
ME, TAYLOR;

I would have to observe there is a

slight sexist phraseology in th© ordinance, your Honor, yes.
Th© attitude apparently is that only men work and th® women
are home.

On that point I will have a little more to say

later, but X think it doesn't affect the apparent purpose of
th© ordinance is directed in terms of public safety against
crime.
Thera is a penalty in the underlying Green River

7
Ordinance applicable her® which is a fin® of $500 or 90 days
in jail accumulative day by day.
The New Jersey court, the majority
QUESTIONS
MR. TAYLOR;
QUESTION;

Mr. Taylor, this ordinance, 598-A, is an —
An amendment.
Well, it's more than an amendment.

It's

a subsection of Ordinance 573, or it's an exception to the
basic Green River Ordinance, isn't it?
MR. TAYLORs

Yes.

And it's phrased as an exception

which is a little curious because it was excepting tilings that
weren’t in 'there before.

It was at on® and the same time an

extension to other people but with a different requirement -QUESTION;

It would be a sanction? it’s not an

absolute prohibition.
MR. TAYLOR;

Well, sanction, but different require­

ments to validate th© soliciting.
QUESTION;

The other ordinance, th© basic ordinance,

573, requires what?
MR. TAYLOR;

That covers commercial solicitation

and it specifies in considerable detail what th® notice filed
with the police shall be, and then, of course, there has to be
a license for that, which is not the case her®.
QUESTION; Under any of these ordinances, Mr. Taylor,
is a person required to receive a card that is used ss
identification in some way?

8

MR. TAYLORs

I think that is true if you are

commercially soliciting, but it is not true with respect to
the part that's in question here now.
QUESTIONs

Does a conaaarcial solicitor have to pay

for his licens©?
MRa TAYLORs

I would have to check it in the

appendix,, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

The ordinance, of course, is

set forth there.
QUESTION?
MR. TAYLORs

Don't speak to it, then.
Now, we, of course, recognize that

public safety is legitimate and indeed a very vital public
interest, and we ar© not contending her© that calling house
to hous® is totally immune from legislative restriction.

I am

not standing her© and supporting any such absolute.
But our position is that the Supreme Court in New
Jersey did very badly misjudge the constitutional factors that
are at work here in these contending values and that we think
a proper judgment on them would require a contrary conclusion.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Taylor, if tills kind of door-to-door

soliciting isn't immune from scan© regulation, can you conceive
of a less onerous regulation than the one that the Borough
has imposed?
MR. TAYLORs

Oh, yes, indeed.

That question, of

course, was put to counsel by the New Jersey court, and the
court seems to hav© taken the position that there was no lesser

9
thing »
We touched on that in the brief% a limitation on the
time of day at which you could call from house to house might
well be legitimate? legislation in support of householders who
gave notice -they did not want people using their front sidewalk
and ringing the bell for this purpose would ba sufficient»
I think beyond that on© would have to say it would depend upon
the kind of use that was troubling the City Council»
QUESTIONS

Of course,

the point you mention puts

the burden both on the householder and the town to enforce it
in a way that this do@sn9tp

if the individual has get to go

and make the complaint himself..
MR» TAYLOR:

Maybe I didnat put it clearly,

The

restriction on time of day would put no -QUESTION:
MR» TAYLOR:

No, I meant the second one.
Th® second, I suppose, would mean that

the householder would hav© to give some indication that, he did
not want solicitors coming to the door.
Of course, it seems to me that whether going beyond
that is permissible or not must depend upon assessing how deep
is the infringement on the First Amendment hare and how great
is the municipal interest that requires the restriction.»

And

that is what I propose to address myself to now.
With respect to th® depth of th© infringement her®,
both in terms of th© scop© and th© depth, I’d like to make some

10
observations*

Th® case here has proeeded continually on fch@

basis that the main effect of this is the restriction on a
candidate? that a candidate must register*

The affidavit of

the chief of police of Grad®11 attached to the answer here is
exclusively concerned with the obligation of the candidate.
But? of course? the restriction here itm?fc limited to candidates?
it applies to any person? and that means all canvassers?
anyone who is going to gat signatures in behalf of candidatas
is affected by this.
The court below saw this as a way of protecting the
community against strangers infiltrating into th© community,
but the ordinance is not. so limited.

It covers residents of

the community as well as people coming in from outside.

Th®

talk has all been about campaigns? but it's not restricted
to campaigns, it covers political causes.
How? a combination of all this would mean, I submit,
that if a householder in Or ad® 11 wishes to canvass his own
block, wishes to call from house to house in his own block
in support of or in opposition to the equal rights amendment
or to school busing, to charter reform? that h© must first
register with th© police — he or sh® must first register
with the police.
QUESTION:

Or a curbing program to put new curbs or

sidewalks in.
MS. TAYLOR:

I should think so.

Things have a way

11
of becoming political issues that perhaps shouldn't, but all
those sorts of things are political in the sens© that the
political authorities will pass on fcham, and therefore it
would be, it seems to us, a vary chilling effect on that sort
of community political consultation»
QUESTION;

Do you agree, Mr» Taylor, that police,

authorities have some reason to believe that•a great many
breaking and entering casas, attacks on householders have
coxae by people who gained entry by getting the door open by
representing themselves in some way as a solicitor o:: a caller?
MR. TAYLOR;

Well, that's an extremely relevant

question to the otter side of the coin hare, that is,, fch®
extent of the necessity for this kind of restriction. and I
will address myself to that directly now.
Th© record her® is, I think, wholly insufficient to
establish any such thing *

The only evidence touching on this

point is contained in Chief Brugnoli1s affidavit in support
of th® answer in which — it's the last thing in th® appendix,
if your Honors wish to look at it.
appendix.

It3s on pag© G-4 of the

And the part of it that speaks to your question

contains some statistics on th® number of breakings and
enterings within the Borough in 1969,

370,

*71, and

72, and

so forth.
But there is absolutely nothing in his affidavit
or anywhere ©Is© in th© record which indicates that a single

12
one of those breakings and enterings had anything to do with
door-to-door solicitation.
QUESTIONS

There is a total lack of —

What p&g© did you say?

MR. TMXGRs

I beg your pardon, it5s the tail end

of the appendix, G-4.
QUESTION? *

Oh, G-4 .

MR. TAYLOR:

Yes.

The statistics on breaking and

entering in Orada11 w® have compared in our brief with the
statistics nationwide.

The rate is very considerably lower

than the nationwide rat©.

On the last page of our brief wa

have compared Orad©11 with the New Jersey crime statistics
in other boroughs of comparable sis©.

There is no indication

that there are in any sons© any peculiar conditions in Orad®11.
There are several boroughs with much higher rates, several
with slightly lower rates.

It seems to be wholly characteristic.

So there is neither any showing of a pervasive nationwide
n@®d, no showing of local peculiarity, and absolutely no
showing that a single on® of fch® breakings and enterings was
the result of somebody posing as a canvasser and then, as your
Honor says, getting a foot in the door.

There is nothing

.there.
QUESTION:

Would it ba irrational for the decision-

makers to conclude that since this does happen in son®
places, they are entitled to take preventive measures to see
that it doesn't happen in Orad©11?

Or do you think that would

13
not be an appropriate consideration?
MR. TAYLOR:

I think lt8s an appropriate considera­

tion, but it 3@®sas to me that hare where

— one would expect

if that were so, your Honor, that some other placas where
this had broken out would have felt a need for this kind of
ordinance.

We have don© our best to find if there ar® any

other places which have felt this n@cessi.ty, and although
its b virtually impossible to canvass ail the municipal legis­
lation of the United Statas, w@ have don© our beat aid have
not com® across any indication that any other place has done
this o
Then, of course, there is the particular history
here that this ordinance cam© on the heels of a particular
episode.
1 have a couple more things to say later about the
rationality of the ordinance in terms of its purpose, but I'
think not, and 1 think that again sine© w® are in ‘the First
Amendment area here, that this speculation -chat it might have
happened somewhere els© is quit© insufficient to justify the
depth of the infringement on the First Amendment hero.
Tin© New Jersey court ~~
QUESTION:

May I ask, Mr. -Taylor, I gather the

ordinance you gave us befor© we put some questions to you is
basically an overbreadth argument, is it?
MR. TAYLOR:

Well, ifc9s more than that.

We hav© a

14
vagueness argument which I haven' t touched on yet.
Yes, it is an over
QUESTION?
MR. TAYLORs

But. it is also an overbreadth argument.
Yes, that9s true.

I haven't com® to th® respects in which this seams
to me so deep an infringement.

Th® New Jersey court seems to

have thought that just registering with the polic® is really
no trouble to anybody, and why should anybody be QKcited about
it.

But if on® thinks about this in tarns of th© political

process that this Court is repeatedly confronted with in
recent years on requirements that minority parties, parties
that haven't been major parties before, get signatures in order
to get on the ballot, other parts ©f th® political process
that this Court has upheld, I believe in one of them Mr.
Justice White emphasised th® vital role that dedicated volunteers
must play in an effective political process.
If one thinks in those terms, th© difficulties of
recruiting volunteers to get signatures, to urge people to
go to th© polls, and so forth, if they must first go to the
police station or mail in their notification, is ver/ *
considerable.

Th® mailing in may not suit —

QUESTION t

Bo you think that people who would be

successful in getting people to sign up on a door-to-door
basis ar© the kind of people -that would be loath to register
with the police?

15
MR. TAYLOR:

X think in many instances that is -true.,

your Honor, yes, and 1 done t mean to say that such people are
very much different from anybody ©Is®.

If we are in a

political campaign ~
GUESTION:

They ex® probably not going to be blushing

/

violets, ar® they?
MR. TAYLORs

They maywell not be p®opl© who look

happily on a visit to the police station.
QUESTIONs

They don’t even want to go thera, not

erven to visit.
MR. TAYLOR:

Most people don’t go to the police

station for pleasant reasons.

They go either because» their

car has been stolen or they hav© stolen somebody else*8s car.
<•1

The whole business here, you cannot schedule canvassing, it’s
a matter of getting volunteers by hook cr by crook.
QUESTION:

Th©r© is nothing in feh® ordinance that

requires anybody tc go to the police station, as I road it.
You can make a telephone call, can't you?
MR. TAYLOR:
QUESTION:
MB..TAYLOR:
under the ordinance.
QUESTION:

It has to be in writing.
Does it?
It has to be in writing, specifically
Yes.
But you don’t hav© to appear personally

tinder the ordinance, do you?
MR. TAYLOR:

You have to gist your writing there

15
either by mail or by personal delivery.

You could send it

by somebody else, but if one canvasser has a sick daughter or
something and cars51 go and you want to e@nd somebody els®,
there won’t foe time to do that other them by going down,
QUESTION%

How about sending a —(inaudible)

MR. TAYLORs

It wouldn’t do it fast enough»

It’s

a matter of getting somebody els® on the spot notice.
QUESTION:

How about sending just a whole list of

people that these as:® substitutes and they will be doing it,
too.

Isn’t one of your problems her® the fact that you have

never really don© this, and so you don’t know what the
mechanics or details of the thing would he when they are
worked sat.
MR. TAYLORs

Well, 2 think that in this area there

are certain matters of common knowledge the Court can recognise.
I don’t know, I don’t believe there has over

been a

campaign where at the outset of it on© had a complete list of
©11 people who might be going to canvass,

On© of the big

things about a campaign is persuading people to com® and do
it, and if when you try to persuade the® to come, you have got
to B&y in the same breath, **Well, I’m sorry, but before you
can do any of this, you’ve got to get word to the police
and identify yourself.58
We ar© overlooking entirely up to this point, your
Honors, the whole question of ethnics, of political viewpoints,

17
the candidate, particularly for local offices, may be a
parson the police department doesn81 like very much or they
don’t like what he is standing for*

Suppose it’s for a

civilian review board to review police brutality?

There are

all kinds of things that may make people very reluctant to
do this.
QUESTION3

But if you had a record showing that, we

could taka some account of it.

But this is simply an action

for declaratory judgment without ©v©r anybody going and doing
it.
MR. TAYLOR:

Well, the only record w© have of the

necessity is that affidavit, and I submit it's totally
insufficient to warrant a restriction which I think as a
matter of common knowledge one can see it will b© a considerable
chiller, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

I don’t see how on® can doubt
.<3.

that the whole matter of recruiting people to do this very
necessary and arduous task would be rendered enormously more
difficult by this kind of requirement.
This further factor of anonymity, of course, the
problem that Talley v. California covers, it may generally
be that candidates don’t act anonymously, but for canvassers
and others the situation is quit© different.

They may be

quit© willing to identify th@mseJ.ves to the householder they
go to see, but not nearly as keen about identifying themselves
to the police if their cause is one that is likely to be

18
unpopular with the police.

Police have ethnic and class

prejudices life© other people do.
QUESTION:

But you arcs asking us to assume that

without any showing in the record that that’s the eas® here.
MR. TAYLOR?

Well, in the first p&a® it seems to me

a reasonably saf© assumption, and in the second place, I think
you must also examine the record —
?

QUESTION'S

The slight to police over 50, Mr. Taylor.

MR. TAYLOR:

Pardon?
?
The slight to police over 50.

QUESTION:
MR. TAYLOR:

Well, whether over or under SC, I think

they will still reflect the sam© prejudices and attitudes that
seem to me are troublesome here.
QUESTIONs

Wouldn’t tfe® ordinance be ©asiex for you

if it were the town clerk?
MR, TAYLOR:

Whether enough, is another matter, but

in fact it’s the polio© her©, not the town clerk.
QUESTION:

But you think there would b® a difference

in constitutionality or could be, either the town clerk or —
MR. TAYLOR

%

Probably feh© chilling effect would ba

somewhat less, but sinca the purpose here is public safety,
feh® whole purpose of this statuta would be • frustrated, Mr.
Justice Rehnquist, if you made

it the town clerk.

The- whole

purpose is to gat. it in th® hands of the police right away.
Bo that’s really not our situation.

IS
Th© point on vagueness which 1 will just talc© a
rainufc© on if I may.

One© again th® Jersey court seems to

have thought that th® ordinance was crystal'clear, and it
certainly is clear enough in terms of the kinds of speech
that it covers, that is, the charitable solicitation, th®
political canvassing, and so forth.

But 1 submit that the

"notify in writing for identification only” is quit®
insufficient.

What can the police legitimately require for

identification purposes?
put out no rules.

As far as th© record shows they have

They have put out no forms.

Th® police

chief has made a coupl® of remarks about it in his affidavit,
but of course they don’t seem to be in any way binding on him
or his successor.
If th® purpose of the ordinance is to help th®
police, know where canvassing is going on, it would seem to
require some? indication of where in the borough you are going
to b®.

Th© ordinance doesn’t say one way or th® othsr.

these lists to be kept confidential or mad© public?

Are

Th®

ordinans© doesn’t help us.
It seems to me there are just too many questions
left unanswered her®.

And I refer th© Court to Justice

Pashman's dissent below where he stresses, it seems to m®,
vary effectively th® special risks of harassment, discriminatory
enforcement, and so forth, that are inherent in the vague quality
of this restriction

20
Now, in conclusion may X say that with the •
total lack of any indication of need hero, with the obvious
effect it is going to have on the political process on
neighborhood discussion, 'Shat the whole balance here was
misjudged below and that the case calls for reversal»

MR. MAJOR:
QUESTION?
MR. MAJOR:

Ye®.
Very favorably, X might say.
It hasn't don© m@ any harm, sir.

(Laughter.)
In this particular eas@, th© problem that we have,
and I would like to lay it right on the table so that you
understand what w® are driving at, we do have a small
community, we do not have what you would call poliosmem on
regular patrol and what not, and w© have people coming into
th© town. I am going to say, for instance. Justice Jackson
this
pointed/out in on® of his dissenting opinions, what happens,
and it will lead up to what I say as to the reason we adopt
these ordinances.

22
People will come to town in a colony and they will
descend on your town, and they will debark.a group of
canvassers, and through your town they go, knocking at doors,
"We are soliciting this," "We are soliciting that,35 and so
forth and so on»
Now, as I point out in my brief and 1 think as the
Justices will recognise, the man who has in mind casing a
house for future burglary doesn’t announce that fact»

He is

going on the guise of a solicitor whether for a charitable
campaign or whatever it is»
Now, ever sine© this Court laid down the decision in
the. Valentine case, we have taken the position that commercial
free speech, if I can coin a phrase, is subject to regulation
and in some cases to prohibition.
Now, we have adopted, and you will find it — you
asked counsel about the initial ordinance — you will find it
on E-l, which is our original canvassing ordinance, and. you
v/ill notice th©r@ that the person ’who* applies for a permit
must, fill out a form, answer certain questions, describe the
goods that he is soliciting,and so forth.

Those ordinances

have been upheld in the State of New Jersey, and I understand
they are not attacked here.
Now, we take a step further.

We have people come

to the town and they say, "We ar© soliciting votes.

We at©

running for this, we ar© running for that, and we want to go

23

from house to house.
Mow, as carefully as I have read the decisions of
this Court, and 1 read them in preparing 'this particular
ordinance, I have found nowhere doss it say as.a premia© that
a person has a right to ring xny doorbell.

I may forbid him,

and the Court probably is familiar with buildings where there
are signs, "Solicitors prohibited," "Soliciting prohibited,"
and the like.
Now, these people come in and say, "We are soliciting,
running for office," so forth and so on.

And the question

than is should we have some idea who they are?

And I think

when counsel says there is nothing in the record to indicate
why this was done, I think the Court would really sit up in
its restrictive chairs if I said that we have 12 unsolved
murders in our vicinity and therefor® there is fear ia the
minds of the householders.
Now, you may say

it's an unjustifiable fear,

it3s

one of the incidents you have to put up with in living in
civilized society.

But if a legislative body is going to be

responsive to the will of its people, it has to recognize these
conditions and therefore the first amendment to this ordinance
was passed.
Now, here is where we had trouble.

It came before

the trial judge on the return of an order to show cause.

There

was not a plenary hearing, no testimony was taken, and counsel

who then appeared for Mr, Hynes and his fellows took the
position that this was an unreasonable regulations, and I
emphasize that position, an unreasonable regulation of the riglr
of free speech, and it was on that hypothesis that the case
was argued.
Along cam® th© trial judge,and

counsel and 1 are

agreed on on© thing, it is very hard to follow that opinion.
1 don't know whether it was correctly transcribed or what.
But th© upshot of it was that h® said that if you are running
for office, you don’t have to comply with any regulations.
•The right to run for office is absolute.
Now, I know of no decision by this Court going back
to Justice Black and tbs others who were absolutists to th®
effect that the right of free speech was not subject to
regulation which took that position.

So we tried, I might

say parenthetically, th® amended ordinance was defective
because it had no sanctions, and an ordinance without sanctions
is no ordinance.

So w© amended it, and amended it in th® light

of the challenge that was made, compared the amended ordinance
with the on© which you will find on E--1 which requires answers
to questions and identification and so forth.

Th© only

requirement that we put in here, and we thought we wore comply­
ing not, Justice Brennan, .with the idea of keeping Democrats
out of Oradell or anything of the sort, but with the idea of
analysing competing principles.

Surely a man has a right to

25

run for office,, surely he has a right to solicit signatures
on nominating petitions, and fch© like.

Also, we ought to haws

some idea of who you are, and therefor® we only said on©
thing, "Identify yourself in writing to th® police chief,
say you are Mr. Hynes and you are going to b® in Oradell
soliciting house to house.
QUESTION:
point?

Say you ar® so and so.”

Mr. Major, may I interrupt you at this

How would you construe the requirement of identifica­

tion in writing?

Would a postcard suffice?

MR.MAJOR:
writing,

I would say that it can b@ done in

I would say anything in fch© way of a driver's

license or anything that I am what I pretend to be.
QUESTION:

Yoxir answer suggests that on® would have

to go to the police station and prov© the correctness of his
identity.

Is that in your thinking?
MR. MAJOR:

The ordinance says "in writing.”

It does not require a personal appearance at the police
station.

Now, tha only time, I ‘think, that the suggestion you

have in mind or the thought that may be troubling ycu v?ould
corns into play is if fch© person were not recognised by his
writing.
QUESTION:

Suppose I lived in Trenton and just sent

a postcard to the police saying that one of these days I am
going to be soliciting for this charity or that charity or
that campaign, or some other, what would happen from then on?

26
Would that be adequate to comply with th® statute or. the
ordinance?
MR. MAJOR;

I would definitely say contrary to what

is said, in appellant9 s brief that there would be no discretion
in th® police chief to say that's not a recognised charity

or anything of the sort.
QUESTION s

I am thinking about my postcard sent from

Trenton saying, 33My name is Powall, I live on such and such
a street»"
MR. MAJOR;
QUESTION;
MR. MAJOR;

1 had in mind Cant®11 v. Connecticut.
But would that answer ray question?
Th© Secretary of state was empowered to

determine whether it was a charity„ recognised charity, and
so forth.

We have not gone into that.
QUESTION;

What I am leading up to is whether you

think — I agree that the ordinance has not been put. into
effect yet — that a postcard would suffice.

And X take it

you do.
MR. MAJOR;

1 would say that would fo® sufficient.

)

QUESTION;

Right.

Would you follow up then and

discuss for an appropriate period how you think that sort of
regulation would prevent crime?
.MR. MAJOR;
QUESTION;
MR. MAJOR;

Definitely not.
It would not.
No, sir.

27
QUESTION:

You think the ordinance does not serve

the purpose for which it was enacted.
MR. MAJORs
QUESTION:
MR. MAJOR:

Definitely.
Wouldn’t that dispose of the case?
I might call to your attention in the

opinion of the Supreme Court that you will find on A-11 ~~
1 bag your pardon, that is in the dissenting opinion.

But on

page A-7, quoting from -chat opinion, BAt oral argument; the
attorney for plaintiff Hynes candidly admitted, as indeed h®
was obliged to by the circumstances, that he could conceive of
no lesser form of intrusion on the right of free speech, other
than absolutely no intrusion., than the identification device
here.”
Now, contrariwise, Justice Pashman on whom the
appellant relics, says this:

"The Grade11 ordinance” — I am

reading from JV-11 — p,fh© Orade.ll ordinance, which, in its
emended form, merely requires a single registration by each
canvasser during each campaign, solely for purposes :>£
identification, %?ould, on its face, appear to impos® no serious
burden on the exorcise of first amendment rights,55
Then, having said that, he goes on to imagina what
might happen.

Now, after all is said and done, the best we

can do is draft an ordinance which we think is clear to
everybody, and of course, if you draw the language to its
extreme, I suppos® you could mak® it almost nonsensical.

But as

28

I sayf that8s the purpose w@ had in mind , identification and
only that»

And in the brief that I have filed her©, I have

pointed out to the Court that the last tiling in the world we
want to do is deprive Hynes or anybody else of the right to
com® 1b and solicit, so long as we know who they are.
Now, Justice P ashman,in his dissenting opinion,
referred to some of the cases which w©r© before this Court,
particularly those involving Jehovah witnesses and th© like,
where they were very much in th© minority-

X heard it said

many times that the majority doesn't need a constitution
and th® majority doesn't need anything ©Is®.

It8s got th®

votas.
Now, in this particular ease, X cannot cor.calve that
tills ordinance or any of its prototypes enacted in ether
places would prevent Democrats or Republicans or anybody
©Is® from solicitingQUESTIONS

Doesn't the ordinance require you to

register while a campaign is going on?
MR. MAJOR:
QUESTION?

Doesn't it require what, sir?
When do you have to register?

When do

you have to identify yourself?
MR- MAJOR:
to house.

Before you start soliciting from house

If you are not soliciting from house to house, you

need not register with anybody.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

But do you think you

29
have to say whafc campaign you are interested in?
MR. MAJOR?

I don't know whether you would even have

to go that far.
QUESTION j

You can just send in a name and say

some day I am going to either solicit for a charity or solicit
for a candidate for office.
MR. MAJORS

I would definitely say that it might be

preferable —
QUESTION;

How about is it required?

Is it required

to identify the campaign that you are interested in?
MR. MAJOR:
QUESTION:

I would think so# yes.

1 would think so.

And do you have to say what side you are

on?
MR. MAJOR:
QUESTION:

No.

No.

But you do have to say what campaign you

are going to be in?
MR. MAJOR:

1 would say that a letter to the polio®

ehisf that I am so and so and 1 will b© soliciting house to
house in the Borough of Or ad© .1.1 in support of my candidacy
would be sufficient.

I don't think that a letter that I

will solicit house to house for soma unnamed cause or for some
unnamed person could answer the question of identity.

The

question is whafc are you doing in the town.
QUESTION:

So you do have to tell the police for

whom you are going to be soliciting.

30

MR. MAJOR;

That would b® ray interpretation, yes,

sir.
QUESTION s

And you don5t think that would dater

anybody from soliciting?
MR. MAJORS

No, sir»

And in the dissenting opinion

below it refers fco what is called chilling, whatever that
sssans.

I'll take it»

I think it would have to be pretty

close fco a freeze to deter the average political candidate
from announcing what h® is running for, because unless he
nays that, 1 don’t know how h© can solicit votas»
QUESTIONs

Yes, but this doesn’t apply just to

candidatesi this applies to anybody who is soliciting on any
aid©»

MR» MAJORS

Precisely.

Now, suppose they are going to solicit sis; signatures
for a nominating petition.

And they ring a doorbell.

Surely

they would have to say this is a nominating petition for Mr.
Hynes or Mr» Byrne, or somebody or other, would you sign it,
and what th®y are running for.

Otherwise, you would be put

in the position of saying, 9?H©r® I have a petition, would
you sign it?r3: And so far as anonymity is concerned, soon,
you take a town the size of Oradell, that you are stopping at
house to house it becomes known that you are soliciting.
Now, in all of these cases, J recognise fully that
you have competing principias striving for mastery.

The last

31
thing in the world that we want, as I said;, is to keep anybody
from running for office or from soliciting.

W© thought this

was a way we could do it.

How, they said there was no testimony taken.

Mr„ Taylor.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TELFORD TAYLOR ON
BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Do you s@@ anything in

the ordinance, Mr. Taylor, that requiras you to identify the
particular objective of your solicitation?

That is, would it

be sufficient if you sent a postcard and said, “Beginning next
week 1 intend to solicit support for my favorite candidate in
the upcoming election?"
MR. TAYLOR:

If the question, your Honor, is whether

it can be don® by a postcard, that is to say, by mail# that’s
on© matter to which the New Jersey court did advert,
& somewhat ambivalent way.

but in

It's on page A-5 of the appendix.

And the court said the requirement may be satisfied in writing,
suggesting that resort may b@ had to the mails.
I was going to make reference to that in connection
with Justice Powell's question.

Of course, that doesn't seem

to me to be an. interpretation, it's a suggestion this might b©

33

so.

I believe that .my basic answer to your question. Mr.

Chief Justice, is that on most of thes© matters the ordinance
is impossibly vague.

It doss not toll us.

I think it does tell us the answer to Justice
White's question about campaigns because there is this sentence
that the notification shall b® good for the duration of the
campaign or cause, and it's hard to sea how that can be
implemented unless the campaign, or cause is specifled.

Whether

you have to say which side of the campaign you ar@ on is the
further question which, again, I think the ordinance gives no
answer.
Might I just say again in response to Justice
Powell's colloquy with my brother at the bar hare, I think
you remarked that the ordinance la not yet in effect.
believe that is so.

I don't

The relief - granted by the trial court was
That, of course, was reversed in the

Supreme Court, and my understanding is that the ordinance is
in effect.

What the practical result has been in terms of the

administration of it, the record is, of course silent on.

But

I believe th© ordinance is now in effect.
QUESTIONs

Under th.® How Jersey practice, if you are

that familiar with it, could the courts, as most courts could,
have a narrowing construction of this ordinance saying that
you need not specify th® party or candidate but merely are
required to say that you will be soliciting support in

ordinance, it isn’t vary effectively dons until th© .'latter
part of tha afternoon or evening when th® working members of
the family of whichever

Mr. Chief Justice, ar© at home.

On© wouldn't go canvassing until that was so.

So that th©

emphasis her© on daylight hours and all wh©n the working man
or woman is away, seems to he rather misplaced.
1 don't believe in summary that th® ordinance exhibits
a rational connection between th© announced objective, and the
terms it imposes..
QUESTION:

In other words, a limitation to daylight

hours might be unreasonable, but th® limitation to canvassing
up to 9 p.m. would, be reasonable.
MR. TAYLOR:

Well, certainly, the impingement on

First Amendment values would be much less in the 9 p.m. ease.
