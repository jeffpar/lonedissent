Mr* Khalil, you may proceed whenever you8re ready*
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. KHALIL, ESQ, ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KHALILs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
This case presents to this Court the questions of
whether Miranda vs, Arizona and W&BtovBz vs, United States
precludes any good-faith non-coerciva interrogation subsequent
to a defendant’s exercise of his right to remain silent.
An additional question that’s involved in this case
is whether or not the exercise of the right, to remain silent
relative to one crime, per se, precludes any subsequent
interrogation relative to a separate and distinct crime.
Now-, the facts in this case arise out of the first
degree murder of a man by the name of Leroy Williams.

The

respondent in this case, Mr. Richard Bert Mosley, was arrested
on April the 18th, 1971, at about 1:05 in the afternoon.

He

was arrested i.n connection with some unrelated robberies;
that is to say, robberies unrelated to the murder for which
he was convicted.
The arresting officer in this case, Detective
Sergeant James Cowie,initially interviewed the defendant

4
in this case for about twenty minutes „

That interview was

undertaken after a full advice of rights was given to the
respondent, and after a. waiver of those rights was obtained»
After Detective Ccwie began to interrogate the
defendant in this case, Mr. Ccwie began asking Mr. Mosley
about the White Tower robbery „ one of the robberies for which
he was arrested.
At that point in time, Mr» Mosley said, "I don't want
to talk about any robberies„n
Detective Ccwie immediately terminated the question,
and didn’t see -the defendant again except to tell him that he
would be questioned later by Detective Sergeant Hill of the
Homicide Section.
Mr» Mosley was then taken to the ninth floor lock­
up are, at about

four o’clock in the afternoon.

During this

time, Detective Sergeant. Hill of the Detroit Homicide Section
had been talking with an accomplice in the Leroy Williams
murder, a man by the name of Anthony Smith.
Mr. Smith, at about four o’clock or so, made certain
statements to Mr. Hill, implicating Mr. Mosley as the shooter
in

the Leroy Williams slaying.

Detective Hill thereafter,

at about 6s25 in the evening, took Mr. Mosley from the ninth
floor lockup area and took him down

to t.fye fifth floor

Homicide Section.
At that point in time, Detective Hill gave Mr

5

Mosley his rights in explicit detail, specifically, Mr. Hill
had defendent Mosley read his rights to himself, then
Detective Hill had Mr. Mosley read the rights out loud so that
Detective Hill could ascertain whether or not, in fact, the
defendant could read.
Detective Hill then read the Miranda rights form
back to Mr. Mosley, explaining in detail all of the points
contained on that document,
At that point, Mr. Mosley testified that he fully
understood his rights, and, in fact, he signed the rights
form, informing him that he had been informed of his rights»
Defendant Mosley testified — yes, Your Honor?
QUESTIONS

What was his reason for doing 'this twice?

Giving him the Miranda warnings twice, what was the reason
for it?
ME» KHALILi

Well, Your Honor, in this case 1 think

that Detective Hill did not knot; thfc Mr. Mosley had earlier
exercised any right to remain silent*
QUESTIONi

Why didn’t he know?

it was all in the

same police department, wasn’t it?
MR. KHALILs
QUESTIONS
MR. KHALILs

That’s correct. Your Honor.
It. was in the same building, wasn’t' it?

It was on a different fJasr, Your Honor3

it was in the same building, yesa
QUESTION*

Well, why did he carry him to a different:

6

floor?
MR-, KHALIL:

Because it was a different bureau,

Your Honor, investigating the crime; it was homicide
QUESTION5

So you sent him around from place to

place, and then, all of a sudden, you give him another warning.
MR. KHALIL!

Not at all, Your Honor.

In fact., the

defendant in this case testified that he knew he wasn't being
taken place to place. The defendant in this case
QUESTION:

He knew that he wasn't being taken?

You said they took him from the fourth floor to the ninth
floor, yat he said they didn’t do that?
MR. KHALILs
Your Honor.

That’s exactly where they took him,

Whet I’m saying is that —

QUESTION:
MR. KHALIL:

That they did move him around.
They took him to the lockup area,

Your Honor, and brought him back for further interrogation.
QUESTION% And then they gave him the Miranda warning
d&CJ' sni

»

MR. KHALIL:
QUESTION:
MR. KHALIL:

That’s correct, Your Honor.
Why?
Because Detective Hill was going to

interrogate him on -the Leroy Williams murder, and under the
doctrine enunciated by this Court in Miranda vs. Arizona,
the rights were a prerequisite to any interrogation.
QUESTION:

Is -there anything in Miranda about taking

7
him from placa to place and giving him warnings every time
you took him?
MR. KHALIL;
QUESTION:
MR. KHALIL:

In the companion case -Of course not.
In the companion case, Your Honor,,

there is discussion of that particular point.
QUESTION; Well, I know a little bit about that one.
MR. KHALIL:
QUESTION;

Wegto;yerjvs_. JPnited. Statea.
Yes, I remember that, but that was State

and federal.
MR. KHALIL:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION: But this was all State.
MR. KHALIL:

That's correct, Your Honor.

case w© don’t feel that it makes a difference.

In this

What should

make a difference in this case is what the circumstances in
this particular case show.
QUESTION: Well, it makes a difference to me as to why
you gave him the seme warning twice, the seme interrogating
agency gave him the same warning twice.
MR. KHALIL:

In this case, Your Honor, there was a

change in circumstances.
QUESTION s

Because you thought he was going to

change his mind.
QUESTION:
overdoing it?

Well, is the State to be penalized for

8

MR* KHALI 1.1

1 don’t think so, Your Honor.

I think

that the State in tills case should be commended for the
reasonable efforts of the law enforcement personnel that are
involved in tills particular case.
QUESTION; Well, suppose you give him six of them,
wouldn't that be penalizing him?

You should leave him alone

after the first one., as I read Miranda,.
MR. KHALILs

Well, Your Honor, that’s not the way

QUESTIONS

That’s as I read Miranda.

that we —

MR. KHALILs

That’s not the way we read Miranda,

Your Honor? that’s not the way that the majority of jurisdic­
tions in the United States that have addressed that precise
question read Miranda,;
There is nothing in Miranda, in our opinion, that
would adopt a. per se rule iri ever}/ case.

That basically is

what the Michigan Court of Appeals did in this case, and
that is what, we assert in this Court, was error.
Rather, the test should have been in the Michigan
Court of Appeals?

Did the defendant in fact, knowingly and

intelligently waive his rights under Miranda vs, Arizona?
That is to say, did he understand those rights and
did he waive those rights?
Now, in the test, that we proposed and in the test
that we think has been the rule since Miranda, tine totality of

9

the circumstances must foa considered in any given

case.

And in this case# for example# the fact that he had
been questioned earlier is merely one of the circumstances to
ha considered,,
QUESTION:

May I ask yen# Mr* Khalil# does the

record show whether or not Hill knew about the earlier
interrogation by Cowl©?
MR* KHALIL:

Yes# Your Honor# the record indicates

that Detective Hill did not know that Mr* Mosley had exercised
his right to remain silent relative to the robberies*
QUESTION:

Does it show whether or not he knew

that Mosley had been interrogated by Cowie?
MR,. KHALIL:

Yes# Your Honor# he knew that Detective

Cowla had interrogated him# and# according tc Hill# he had
understood that Mosley had denied implications# quote, in
any robberies.

He did not know that he exercised his right

to remain silent»
I might, note# Your Honor# that initially Mr. Mosley
did not remain silent# he signed the waiver rights form in
•tilia case*
QUESTION:
MR* KHALIL:
QUESTIONs

Yes*
And only later waived those rights»
And that’s Hill’s testimony in the

record# is it?
MR» KHALIL:

That’s Hill’s testimony# .and it’s also

10

Mr. Cowie's testimony, that he did not tell Detective Kill
about the prior exercise.
QUESTION s

There was no direct contact , as I under-

stand it, between Cowie and Hill.

Cowie finished about, four

p.m* , and Mosley was then returned somewhere, and then it
wasn't until about aix p.m. that he was taken to the ninth
floor and interrogated by Hill? is that right?
MR* KHALILs

He was taken to the fifth floor from

the ninth,
QUESTION;

Fifths floor, from the ninth,

MR, KHALIL2

—» that * 8 correct.

contact between Hill and Cowi®,

But there was some

In fact, Detective Hill

discovered the presence of Mr. Mosley in the headquarters
building from Lieutenant Domra, who was then on duty, and from
Detective Cowia.

However, there was no elaborate discussion

as to what had occurred between Cowie ami Mosley,
QUESTIONs

So that Hill did know about the earlier

interrogation, and he did know that Mosley had refused to
discuss the robberies?
MR» KHALIL:
Your Honor

He did. not know that specifically,

He knew that — as far as

Detective Hill knew,

Mr. Mosley had declined or denied any implication in the
robberies*
QUESTION: Denied any implication?
MR. KHALIL:

That's correct, Your Honor,

11
QUESTIONS

But. your argument, I take it, would be

the same, whatever he knew.
MR» KHALILs

That5s correct, Your Honor.

The fact

that he had remained silent earlier -*~
QUESTION; Well, that isn't a critical ~~ you don’t
think that’s a critical fact in the case?
MR. KHALIL:

no, 1 don’t, Your Honor, not at all.

QUESTION; And should we decide the case on the
assumption that the second officer knew that he had declined
to answer, had decided to exercise his rights?
MR. KHALIL: Well, I think in this particular case.
Your Honor, the record is clear that he did not know that he
had earlier exercised his rights. But it doesn't matter for
purposes —
QUESTION; Well, it might.

It might.

you don't knot* what might matter or not.

In any event,

But, in any event,

you say the record is clear that Hill testified, at least,
that he did not know that Mosley had exercised his right to
remain silent in the earlier interrogation?
MR. KHALIL: That’s correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION: And if he had any doubt, about whether
the warning had been given or what had preceded, I suppose
your position would be:

the prudent thing was to give the

warning again
MR. KHALIL:

That’s correct, Ycur Honor, that’s

12
precisely what Detective Hill did in this case*
QUESTION: And if he hadn't done that# yon wouldn't
have any case# would you?
MR, KHALILs

That's not necessarily correct# Your

Honor»
In iliis particular case# the fact that Detective
Hill did not know# I think# goes to the fact, that it was a
bona fide investigation# it was a good-faith police effort
by Detective Hill in approaching the defendant in this case»
Now# the Michigan Court of Appeals did not ©van
reach that issue» The Michigan Court of Appeals said that this
Court intended# under Miranda vs, Arizona# to hold that the
mere approaching of a defendant a. second time was# per se#
coercive,

I would 8isbffl.it that on the record .in this case that
could not# in any way# be substantiated or justified? that
the only way that this case could have been reversed and#
indeed# was reversed# was based on a per se rule# which# as
I indicated# is contrary to the majority of jurisdictions
in the United States# both State and federal»
Now# it's our position here that what the Michigan
Court of Appeals should have done was to look at the totality
of the circumstances surrounding the interrogations hare# and#
indeed# look at the waivers in this case.

Now, the waivers

here are razor-clean. There's no tenable argument that could.

13
be mads that these waivers were not knowingly, intelligently,
and voluntarily made»
Now, no questioning whatever occurred in this case
prior to obtaining of a waiver by either Detective Cowis
or by Detective Hill*

That is to say, there was no coercion

used, no trickery used, nothing along that vein, in order to
gat a waiver in this case.
The waivers were constitutionally procured in this
case, and it*s our position that, in fact, the confession was
constitutionally procured in -this case.
Now, I might point out for the* Court's reference
that our assertion that the totality of the circumstances
should be the test in this case is apparently agreed upon by
the respondent here*
Now, at pages 21 and 31 of his brief, and at page
44 in the conclusion of his brief, the respondent indicates
that, indeed, the inquiry that -this Court should make is
whether or not, under the totality of circumstances —whether respondent Mosley, under all of the circumstances,
knowingly and voluntarily and intelligently waived his rights*
New, that's precisely what we're arguing to this
Court»
Now, we don't feel that we’re contending for a new
rule here in this Court»

It's our position that that has

always been the rule since Miranda»

That, in fact, any new

14
rule hera is the rule that has bean promulgated by the
Michigan Court of Appeals»

And we submit that that rule ought

not to stand in this particular cass, nor in any other case
arising tinder these same facts.-.
Now# it cannot be disputed here that Mr» Mosley was
twice given his rights»

In fact#, the Court of Appeals found

that in their opinion# and I don't think it's disputed on
this record»

There were# a,» I mentioned# two clean waivers

©f rights# iiser© was no coercion in this case# there were no
threats made to the defendant in order to get him to waive.
Thera was no attempt in this cas® to subvert his previous
exercise of the right to remain silent-

There was no long

incarceration here»
This caserns a new investigation being handled by a
separata bureau# in charge of — by a separate police officer,
Sergeant HillAnd, in fact# the interrogation initially, X point
out, was only twenty minutes in length, only covered a few
preliminary cuestions«
Now, the many courts that have considered this
question, both State and federal courts, have adopted the rule
that we are contending for in this case?

that is to say

that as long as any subsequent inquiry respects the rights
previously asserted, and the subsequent inquiry is undertaken
for good-faith reasons,

there is no reason whatever to hold

15
that the fact that the man exercise his right previously
should taint any subsequent voluntary waiver of rights.
That’s what we’re saying in this particular case, that the
rights were knowingly waived previously, then they were
exercised relative to robberies; in the second case there was
a knowing and intelligent waiver here, and fee confession was
voluntarily made.
X point out. to the Court that there was no
badgering here, there was no harassing, as Mr. Justice .Marshall
is Inclined to believe, there was no institutionalized
QUESTION* What gave you the idea that I «■- would
you please not characterize what I*m thinking.
MR, KHALIL*

My apologias, Your Honor,

QUESTION* Thank you!
MR, KHALIL:

But there was, in any avent, no

bureaucratic harassment in this case, there was no systematic
attempt to break down the exercise of his right previously
exercised.
In fact, as I indicated, Mr. Hill did not know of
that previous exercise.

I think that goes to the good faith

of his activities, in this case.
Now, we feel in this case that the Michigan court of
Appeals erred by adopting the per se rule, and holding the
confession should have been suppressed.
We*re asking this Court to reverse the Michigan

.16

Court of Appeals and, under the circumstances in this case,
to hold the confession to have been voluntarily and intelli­
gently entered into and tendered into evidence»

How, —
QUESTIONs

I thought you said earlier that you had

in mind a remand to reconsider under the totality of the
evidence approach?
MRa KHALILs

Ho, Your Honor, everything -that would

be available to a Michigan court is available to this Court»
QUESTIONS

I seea

KHALILs What I think I suggested, Your Honor,
or attempted to suggest was ‘that defense counsel in this case
agreed with us that totality of circumstances should have
been the .'teat in the Michigan Court of Appeals and should bo
the teat here*

Although his conclusions are somewhat differ­

ant from the petitionary in. this case*
QUESTION:

Well, if w© reject the per so rule, which

you say the Michigan Court of Appeals has adopted, wouldn’t
we ordinarily simply tell the Michigan Court of Appeals that
that was not a proper standard forreversing under the Federal
Constitution, and then 1st them make an assessment as to the
totality of the circurastances ?
MR* KHALILa

Well, Your Honor, I know that this

Court, in Brown vs» Illinois, decided last term, decided the
issue rather than submit it back to the trial court? that this

17
Court will have before it all of the facts that will be
available to the Michigan Court*

And I think that, given this

case, Your Honor, with the importance of this case and the
importance of this issue to all of the State and federal courts*,
not only the Michigan court, that this Court ought to instruct,
lower courts on what the feeling is of this Court in this

area*
And 1 think 'that, especially Idle Michigan court in
this case needs some instruction on that particular pointt
QUESTIONS

Let mm follow through at this point*

Brown v, Illinois is a little different than this case, in
the sense that there, as I recall, the arrest, was concededly
an illegal one.
If you should prevail on the argument you've made
so

far,

do you think we should, nevertheless, remand the case

for determination of the legality or illegality of the arrest,
and hence the implication of tutmaeamtunatum
Brown and Wong
Sun?
NmwwiimarawMKn»
MR, KHALILs Well, Your Honor, in this case, I would
submit to the Court-, that enough facts are present her®, that,
this Court could determine whether or not the arrest was
valid, if it so desired,
However, the fact remains that the Michigan Court
of Appeals only addressed one issue in this case, and that
was the Miranda issue.
It*s our position that impliedly that meant that

18

the arrest was lawful here,»

What we would ask this Court

to do would be to rovers© the Michigan Court of Appeals
relative to the confession and send it back to the Michigan
Court for proceedings not inconsistent with that opinion.
I think, under that particular remand, the defendant
would be allowed to raise any other grounds that he might feel
he was entitled to,
QUESTION: And you would be content with that kind
of —~
MS, KHALIL: We would b& content, Your Honor, with a
reversal of the Michigan Court of Appeals and with some
instructive language relative to the confession and what
Miranda intended9 in cases such as this one.

QUESTION: Thank you

QUESTIONt
MR» KHALIL;

Every State has a different name»
That * s correct/ Your Honor; ours is

Walker,
QUESTION: Very good/ thank you»
MR. KHALILj

Now, it5a our position in this case

that Miranda did not preclude subsequent interrogation
relative to even the. same case, that instead, as I indicated,
the circumstances of the waiver-and the confession have to be
looked to on a case-by-case basis.
But, in any event, this case is not a case of
continuing or incessant interrogation* This case, indeed,, is
a case wherein the interrogations, one by Cowie and one by
Hill, involved separata, unrelated, distinct crimes»
And it’s our position that this case was specifically
allowed for in the companion case to Miranda, West over vs,-.
United States,
Now, this was a different crime, it was a different
interrogator, and, may I say, I feel that at was a different
place, the interrogation taking place on the fifth floor
rather than the fourth, and those circumstances, more
importantly, appearing to the defendant, because he testified
that he understood that the second inquiry was a homicide
inquiry >
QUESTION:

But again the Westover was the state court

prosecutors and the federal prosecutors»

That’s entirely

20

di fferent ? isn't i.fc?
MR. KHALIL8

I don't think so, Your Honor.

I think

that it would be merely a form over substance rule that would
require that the second authority come from the federal
jurisdiction, e.a opposed to —*
QUESTION8 Well, you don't see any difference between
State and federal?
MR. KHALILt

Not at all, Your Honor.

I think the

critical question is to look at the state of mind of the
defendant in a particular case, and I think that's what this
Court did in Westovar.
QUESTION*

Because in Whatever, even —*

Westover was deliberately, and they

emphasize in the opinion that one was: federal and one was
State.
I*m a. little familiar with Wastover, I know, I lost

it.
MRa KHALIL*
QUESTIONs

That's correct. Your Honor.
That’s the best way to remember a case is

to lose one,
MR» KHALIL*

That’s correct, Your Honor, you argued

that case, as I remember„
QUESTION* And that was the point, that one was
federal and on© wag stata,
MR. KHALIL* But what, I’m saying, Your Honor, that,
ipso facto, that should not determine what the outcome of a

21
given case is.
I say that it*s merely a formal distinction as to
whether on© authority is a federal authority or a State
authority.
I can visualize certain cases arisingr for example,
in our jurisdiction, wherein one police agency may corae into
a case where, say, the Detroit Polio© Department is holding
a particular suspect.

And to say that simply because they may

be from the same agency, that, per so, praeludes an interroga­
tion, 2 submit that Westover does not"go that far*
X think that in Westover, this Court recognised
that the questioning there, which went ever fourteen hours
and was without Miranda rights, could result in a voluntary
confession to the FBI* who was the second interrogating
authority, m long as Miranda rights ware given and as long
as the defendant in that case was given an opportunity to
exercise those rights,.
Now, if that*s the case, X submit- that in this case
wherein we have only a short twenty-minute interrogation,
wherein the defendantfs rights ware honored, in fact he
saw that they worked# he exercised the right to remain silent
relative to the robberies> questioning ceased*
That in this case# with that short interrogation,
a respect of rights# a valid giving of Miranda warnings# that
should not taint, per se, the subsequent confession in this

22
case given to Detective Hill.
Westover goes in tills case,

That!s our position as far as
We feel that it supports the

position in this particular case»
QUESTIONS Who has authority in Detroit to prescribe
police investigating procedures?

Is it the city government

or city council or the
MR. KHALILs

Yes, Your Honor* the city government,,

the Detroit Police Department prescribes procedures to be
followed by its officers in a given case.
QUESTION?

And the State has no authority whatso­

ever or ~~
MR* KHALIL*

No, in the city «*- there are State

statutes* Your Honor* that guide the city police in certain
areas? for example, in the area of arrest.
QUESTIONs

But tlie Attorney General's office has no

authority?
MR. KHALIL*

The Attorney General does not have a

direct hand in it. Your Honor,

We have the Detroit Police

Department, we have -the Wayne County Sheriff’s Department,
and then we have the ’Michigan State Police.
QUESTION* But in a case like this, it’s the local
prosecutor's office that has the authority to handle appellate
litigation?
MR. KHALIL;

That's correct, Your Honor, the Wayne

County prosecutor’s office,

23
QUESTION:

Then the State Attorney General has no

authority in —
MR. KHALIL:

Yes. he does*. Your Honor,, the State

Attorney General -** ar© you speaking about this particular case,,
coming into this case?
QUESTION:
MR. KHALIL:

Yes.
The Attorney General has the authority

in the State of Michigan to enter any case as the attorney of
record on behalf of the people.
QUESTION:
MRB KHALIL:

Must

he consent to bring the case here?

Not. that I am aware of, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

All right*, thank you.

QUESTION:

But he. may displace the local prosecutor?

MR. KHALIL;

Ha may displace us if ha so chose to

do so, but in this particular case he did not do 'that..
Now,

b.b

I indicated, it's our position here that

the confession was voluntarily made, and knowingly and
intelligently made.

We would ask this Court, as I indicated

to Mr. Justice Blackman, to reverse the Michigan Court ef
Appeals on the confession Issue, and hold that, indeed,
Miranda vs. Arison?-, did not preclude any subsequent, interroga­
tion for good-faith purposes.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Very well.
Mr. Ziemba.

24
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARL ZIEMBA, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ZIEMBA:
of the Courts

Tin an k yon, Mr. Chief Justice.

Members

• .. ..

X think that what we have hare is a semantic problem
rather than a legal one, or perhaps it comes to the same
thing, since we, in law, deal with nothing but words.
I think that 'the semantic problem initially starts
with the meaning of the word "quit".
Now, Mark Twain once told us that quitting smoking
is the easiest thing in tha world to do, "I’ve done it hundreds
of times".
And apparently this is what, the Detroit Police
Department end the Wayne County prosecutor says.

Miranda

says,true enough, "when an accused under custodial interroga­
tion exercises his right under the Fifth Amendment to remain
silent, that election by him must bm honored and all
questioning must cease."

Which means to my mind, "all ques­

tioning must quit."
QUESTION;
MR, ZIEMBAs
QUESTION?

But it doesn’t mean forever, obviously.
No, not forever.
I mean, if he’s released'and a year later­

is apprehended on some separate crime
MR, ZXEMBA*

True.

True.

But I do not think that

this Court, meant in Miranda that, the police are to quit

25
questioning for five minutes.
QUESTIONs

Well, that’s j.uat dicta that you're

quoting from Miranda, isn’t it?
I mean, that hadn't In -fact..happened to Miranda.
MR. ZIEMBA:

Well, no, but the language is there,

the questioning —»
QUESTION*
MR. ZIEMBA*

But it's dicta, though, isn't ifc?
No, not the statement that the

questioning must cease, Your Honor.
QUESTION*

Wall, I thought the definition of Rdictaw

was any observation by the Court made that was not necessary
for decision on the particular facts before it.
QUESTION* Well, under that definition, -99 and a half
percent of the Miranda opinion,-.is dicta.
QUESTION* Right,
MR. ZIEMBA:
QUESTION*

That's my point, which r©al3,y —
So you concede, then, that you’re relying

on dicta?
MR. ZXEMBA*

Under that definition, yog.

Yea.

If it was dicta for this Court to say that when an accused
under custodial interrogation elects to exercise the Fifth
Amendment right to silence, and it must be honored, and th©
polios must cease questioning.

If that is dicta, I am relying

on that.
And I think that this Court meant that the police)

ara not to cease for five minutes, that -the police cannot then
decide how long they will

cease questioning the accused.

Whan a court issues an injunction to a man to stop beating
his wife in a divorce case, the court doesn’t mean stop for
five minutes; the court means what it sayss

Stop.

If, indeed, according to further dicta in Miranda, —
QUESTION* Well, you’re comparing an injunction with
something like a sidebar comment in the Miranda opinion now.
MR. ZIEMBAt

Well, I would like to elevate it to more

than just u sidebar comment.

?
QUESTIONS

Well, in Hatteras v. New York, we
■*r.SP*zz*tXicr-s\v NutwanxMMMMvaoutava*

jwkwijki-»

indicated that we were separating the dicta from the substantive
aspects of the holding, did we not?
MR. ZIEMBAj

That’s true.

That’s true.

And then,

of course, this court in Santa Bello, when confronted with a
situation where one prosecutor mad© a promise to a criminal
defendant regarding his plea, and another and distinct
prosecutor appeared with that same defendant in open court,
that the promise of the first out-of'••court prosecutor would
be binding on the in-court prosecutor? this Court saying —
QUESTION*
MR, ZIEMBA*

But that wasn’t on a Miranda issue ~~
No, but this Court said if responsibility

could be evaded that way, the prosecution would have designed
another deceptive contrivance, akin to those we condemned in
Mooney vs. Hall, and which is the point of the respondent her®,

27
Here»
The strictures of Miranda can be avoided by the
simple expedient of taking the accused and just shuffling him,
just sending him from on® police officer to another, and
requiring him, as the prosecutor suggested, each and every
time a police officer undertakes to question you, you must
once again say, "I want to remain silent under my privilege,
under the Fifth Amendment*B
Then, eventually, you‘re going to overcome and over­
bear the will of this person not to answer questions»

If,

indeed, custodial questioning by police in an incommunicado
situation, such as we have here, is inherently coercive.
And if you allow an accused the opportunity to say,

I

don*t want to answer any questions*, and you keep coming back
at him by the same police officer or other police officers
of the same department* propounding questions to him?
not further exerting upon him coercive practice?

Are yon

I think you

are,
QUESTION $

It makes no difference'if the subject

matter of the conversation is a totally different -«*
MR, ZIEM3As

None whatever*

And I think this is a

~~ the case at bar is a most beautiful illustration of that
principle that one could hope to find? for this reason s
You had the arrest of the respondent here on the basis of an
anonymous telephone call, without a warrant,

Cowie received it

28

two or three days before the arrest# he couldn’t be sure,
A telephone call from a person he had naver heard on the
telephone before# whose name h® didn’t get and didn't know at
all-

And this person said that the respondent was mixxed up or

involved in these robbiers on the Southeast side of Detroit.
And Cowis said the man mentioned the Blue Goose Bar
and the White Tower Restaurant# and the place where the
deceased in this case was killed.
And Cowie went out and picked the respondent up and
brought him downtown
And he said# Cowie said# "I questioned him only on
Blu© Goose, because I learned that he wasn't responsible for
White Tower. *
And then Cowie turned him over -« turned him over -~
to Hill for further questioning in the Leroy Williams matter.
QUESTIONt

He questioned him on Blue Goose, which

was the name of the cafe whore the robberies had. been •—
MR. ZIEMBA*
QUESTIONS
what?

I think so.
Because X —• ha wasn’t responsible for

Whit.© Tower?
MR. ZIEMBA:

And Cowie mentioned the Whit® Tcwer

robbery also.
QUESTION^

I see.

I just wanted to fee sure. I

understood what you're saying.
MR. ZIEMBA:

Yes,

Yes

29

How. if Hill hadn’t bean successful in the Leroy
Williams case* how many other police officers could then have
taken 'the respondent .and questioned him about other crimes
occurring in the Southeast area of Detroit?

If you allow

one* why not twenty?
QUESTIONS

If you* as you indicate in the last

paragraph of your brief* stand on the totality of circumstances
rule# than there might foe quite a differant approach if there
wars tan such or even five such episodes in sequence# as
compared with two? is that not correct?
MEL ZIEMB&*

1 think it would be more gross,

certainly# but in principle 1 do not think that there is any
difference at all# because# Mr» Chief Juati.es «—
QUESTIONs

Isn’t that what totality of circumstances

means?
MRo ZIEMBA*

In my mind# in this case# the totality

of circumstances would mean the completely -«* the arrest with­
out any probable cause whatever of the respondent.

The

failure of Ccwie* after having taken the respondent downtown#
to conform to the Michigan statute which requires the
production of an arrested person under felony before a
judicial officer without unnecessary delay» Wa have a
parallel, tc the Federal Rule 5 requirement* and this was not.
done* and Cowie admitted that there was absolutely no physical
obstacle to his taking the respondent before son® judicial

30
officer of the court, which is located just across the street
from the Detroit Police Headquarters,
QUESTION*

Instead, ~~>

On® obstacle was he didn't have anything

to hold him on.
MR, ZIEMBAs

That's true,

And precisely, Cowie

said, "I didn*t take him over, because I didn’t think 1 had
enough.”
Further, the prosecutor© speaks about the noncoarcive aspect of the second interrogation of the respondent,
Now, further dicta .1», Miranda seems to indicate that
once an accused has exercised hia right under the Fifth not
to answer any questions, there might be a waiver, a valid
subsequent waiver; but the mere ritualistic incantation of
the Hiram warnings followed thereby by a confession, in and
of itself, will not be regarded as a waiver.

For the reason

diet if there were no confession, thar© would bo

no

question.

Because we had a confession, we ire confronted with the problem
of the voluntariess of tha confession end the coercive
measures.
This Court, according to dicta in Miranda, states
that if, indeed, there is a confession under these circumstances,
no A-'.a-ri:.rr what the bsutioony of ':he polio® is, it is consistent
with an involuntary statement, and consistent with the will
of tiio accused being overborne by the procedures .
Now, you had in this additional case this additional

31
factor,- that Hill, when he approached the respondent and
read off and gave him the Miranda warnings* immediately stated
to the respondents

"Anthony Smith has confessed, and he puts

you on the trigger.
QUESTIONf

You're : the shooter."
But Mr,. -Khalil says that when he was ‘there

eeeond tint®, with the second officer, if he had not given
the Miranda ruling* you would be yelling.
MR. ZXEMBAs

[Laughing.]

QUESTION* Well, what's your answer to that?
MR. 2IEMBA:

X — I would have yelled in either

case.
QUESTIONi
MR. EXEMBAs

You would have yelled louder.
Louder, yes.

[Laughter,, ]
MR. ZIEMBA:

I would point to another —

QUESTIONs Well* then* what was the second wan to do?
MR. ZXEMBAs

I'm sorry * sir?

QUESTION8 The second officer* who questioned him*
what was he to do?
MR. ZIEMBAj
positions

He couldn't question him at all?
That's •*« this is the respondent's

that Cowi© had a duty and obligation to inform Hill

that he* Cowie* had advised the respondent of his Miranda
rights and that the respondent had elected, under the Fifth
Amendment privilege* to remain silent.
QUESTION* Suppos© after the interrogation on the

32
robbery had bean concluded by Detective No. 1, and h© concluded
that he did not have enough to hold him or send him across
the street for the preliminary hearing* but excused him and
he went on hornar and then the second detective came along and
said* BI wanted to talk to ‘that man before he left* but he* a
gone.*

So they send a police car out to his home* pick him

up, bring him dam.
Now, 1 assume you would agree that they must give
him a Miranda warning then, would you not?
MR. ZZBMBAI

Yes.

Yes, definitely.

Because the warning that was two or.

QUESTION*

three hours or a number of hours old would not carry over.
MR. ZXEMJA*

Yea.

X think that there you might —

you might say that an intervening event or series of events
broke the causal chain between the first interrogation, the
continued custodial retention of the respondent -QUESTION*

By the intervention, you mean going out­

QUESTION?

So yon put your whole cas®, or large part

of your case, on th© absence of an intervening break in the
chain of ©vents?
ME, ZXEMBA:

Yes, for this reason, that th©

inherently coercive atmosphere of a custodial interrogation
continued and, in my opinion, was mad© worse by the fact that
here you have this — let us

-assume an 18-year-old boy, in

incommunicado interrogation by a police officer on such a
serious charge as robbery is — hefs frightened, he's
apprehensive, he has nobody there to advise him, and the
officer says;

"It's my obligation to inform you, young man,

that if you don't want to answer any questions, you have the
perfect right to remain silent* and I{11 honor that*”
And the response is, wGreat, I don’t want to answer
any questions about any robberies♦"

And ha relaxes, and

35
"Oh, by the way, your co-conspirator says you*re the one that
had the gun*

Does that make you change your mind?”

And he says, "Oh, yeah» 1 want to talk now»"
Is that okay?
MR. ZIEMBA:
so»

No, I don’t think so»

According to the dicta of Miranda again.

I do not think
Because this

Court has said that when an accused exercises his right to
counsel, says "X want counsel”, no questioning shall continue
until counsel comes»
And then, of course, there ar® those cases in the
lower courts

well, Fahy, for instance, I think is on point»

Where incriminating evidence was presented to a defendant and
were it not for that incriminating evidence he wouldn’t have
confessed»
I think that the only way that we’re going to ~~
if, indeed, there is merit, to the rule that the police must
warn a suspect in custodial interrogation that he has the
right to remain silent, and if we give the right to the
accused to remain silent, the only way that we can make that
right meaningful is for — is to require the police to
absolutely desist from any further questioning of that
defendant before he is presented to a judicial officer, so
that the judicial officer may say, "Sir, you are charged or
at least accused of a very serious crime? you have a right
under the Constitution to an appointment of counsel if you

36

have

ho

money for counsel»

Do you want an attorney?13

1 remember when 1 was on the very same staff of the
Wayne County Prosecutor’s office a number of years ago, 1
happened to be the senior man in the office on this afternoon
when two homicide detectives brought in this middle-aged man
for me to take his formal statement in e. homicide»

He had

don® in his paramour, his common-law wife»
And I started out by giving him his rights, and I
said, "Sir, you are a citizen of this country, if you want a
lawyer and don’t, have money. I’ll go across ’the street and
have a judge appoint one for you»

Do you want, one?"

Ha said no.
But I was not convinced, with his answer, that he
was telling me what he really felt, in his heart»
Now

I said, "Mr* Smith,” — if that was his name —

"we will leave the room for five minutas and you think about
it, and tell me,"

And so we did. The court stenographer and

the two detectives

and I,

When we cam® back in, I said,

"Sir, have you made up your mind?”
And he was looking out the window and he turned his
face toward me and ha said, £3hre you sura I won’t get beat
up if 1" ask for an attorney?”
It's my opinion that it’s not sufficient to read
off from a form to a person who is in custody,

QUESTION t

Going back to my question, you worry me

considerably«
MRu 2I5MBA:

What is that» Mr» Justice Marshall?

QUESTIONS When the officer comes back and says,
"Your co-conspirator says you were the guy with th© gun0 Do
you have anything to say?”
That's not really a question, is it?
MR. ZIBMBA:
QUESTIONs

No, it isn’t.
Well, why is it barred from Miranda?

MRr, ZIHMBAs
QUESTION:
MR. ZIBMBAs

Why is it barred by Miranda?
Yes*
Because its.purpose and its design is

to overbear the will of the defendant, who has already stated
that h® wants to exercise his constitutional right to remain
silent.

It is calculated to throw th-© fright of Heaven into

his soul, so that he will confess.

Or at least to make some

incriminating s tatemenfe«
And if we permit that, Mr» Justice, if the man says,
"I don’t want to say anything"; then five minutes later the
same police officer comas back and says, "Not only do we have
your rap partner, but we have an eyewitness who says that you
pulled the trigger.H

And things mount, and tilings mount.

Now, in this particular case, I think the record

38
indicates that in all likelihood the second police officer,
Hill, didn't have a confession from Anthony Smith*
QUESTIONS Well, all the defendant said, though, was
that he didn't want to answer any questions about any robberies„
MR. ZIEMBA*

Yes, and this was: a robbery-connected

homicide.
QUESTIONS
MR. ZIEMBA:

Well, it was still a homicide.
But it was a felony murder, as w® call

it in Michigan.

Let’s assume he’s asking about some

crime that's not. connected with the robbery at all*

QUESTION5

Well, that may be, but it is somewhat

of an exaggeration of what the defendant claimed when he said
"I don't want to answer-''any questions «about robberies.15

It's

a little exaggeration to say he said he didr?,11 want to answer
any questions at all.
MR. ZIEMBA:

Yes, but,Mr. Justice,. I do pray you to

QUESTIOMs Well, it doesn’t change your case to say
he refused to answer any more questions about robberies,
and the police came back and asked him about a robbery»

That's

— you’ve still got just as good a case as before, haven’t
you?
MR, ZXBMBA*

If I understand what you’re saying»

My answer is that wa are discussing this thing as trained
lawyers»

We may know the semantic differences between

answering questions about robberies and answering questions
about homicide, but here you have an 18-y®ar-old boy who, I
think, when he said, “I don’t want to answer any questions"
is, in effect, saying, ”1 want to take advantage of this right
you say I have to remain silent»”
I don’t think that it would be fair for us to hold
this 13-year-old, untrained in legal distinctions, to a
precise, literal interpretation of his answer»

him forever —MR, ZIEMBA:

MR, ZIEMBA:
QUESTION*

HO, no.
— from. -No, absolutely not,
Ten minutes later,, before they released

him, if they were going to release him for lack of evidence,
suppose he said, "I’ve changed my mind,

I think maybe you’ll

40

give me a break if I tell you the whole story, and so I want
to tell you the whole story,"
Anything wrong with that?
MR» ZIEMBA:

1 don * t. think so,

I think — 1 think

that if w® can datermine that the statement mad© by the
accused is indeed voluntary, is something that he decided
without any pressuring, any coercion to make, then, yes, it's
voluntary.

But when wa speak of totality of circumstances,

I think we have to look at,No» 1, arrested with utterly no

Would yon elaborate on what. 1*1/© just said?

Do you support

the per so rule the Michigan Court laid down, or do you agree
that it did lay down a par se rule?
MR * ZXEMBAs

I do agree that the opinion can foe

interpreted as- a per s© rule,

I do think that it is a good

rule to adopt a per se rule, She Mirande decision seems to set
forth, if it. is in dicta, -fell® per s@ rule that if the warnings
are not given, we*re not going to examine into the knowledge
of the accused, if the warnings aren’t given, the confession
goes downa

continues # the confession gees down*
And X think that it would be wall for us to adopt
the rule, per se.

One® an accused under custodial interroga­

tion exercises the right under the Fifth Amendment to remain
silent, the police must stop questioning, and any violation
of that rule, that is, any coming back to that defendant,
between — before some judicial process intervenes, such as
his arraignment in court or even just his presentation in

QUESTION§ And then if a murder had been committed,
then you would — that would he Justice Marshall’s hypothetical
case, then truly you would concede he could b© apprehended and

MR» ZIEMBAt

YaSo

Yea„

QUESTIONS Sven though his custody continues unbroken*
QUESTION:

HO, no*.

QUESTION*

My cassa was, yes*

QUESTION*

Mr, Justice Marshall’s question was, and

I wish you would answer it*
MR* ZXEMBAs

Wall, in Justic© Marshall’s hypothesis

there was no opportunity for th© prisoner winning hie freedom,
he’s in prison, as X understand your hypothesis, he can’t
walk home, you ss®, after having bean questioned about the
first offense

43
But our respondent could have, and he should have
walked horn® after refusing to answer any questions, because
the detective who arrested him had absolutely nothing to hold
him for*
QUESTION: But what is your answer to Mr. Justice
Marshall's question?
ME. ZXEMBAs

My answer is that it’s a difficult

question, for the reason that wa have this added •— we have
this added factor that a prisoner in State prison, I take it
you mean, Mr. Justice Marshall?
QUESTION:

I'm talking ab&tvt this prison.

l*m

talking about Mosley.
MR. ZIEMBA:

oh, you mean if Mosley had been

taken back to the lockup and had murdered somebody?
QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

yes.

MR* ZIEMBAs

.

X really don't know.

I really don’t

know the answer to that question,
QUESTION:
ba difficult.

The answer is pretty clear, it shouldn't

Of course he could be questioned about it,

couldn't he?
MR. ZXEMBAs About the second crime?
QUESTION: Certainly.
ME. ZIEMBA:

Can he go back to this first one?

bet's put it this way:

certainly I think you will

49
agree, Mr. Justice Marshall, that if Mosley had been questioned
about ‘Hie first *«-> had been locked up and had murdered some-»
body before the first detective questioned, him, and feoid the
first detective, "1 don't want to answer any questions about
any killings," certainly he could not then be questioned about
‘the killing inside the jail.
QUESTION:
MR, SXEMB.&*

I'm only interested in say question-,
Yes.

QUESTION: Well, h© could

but in the hypothetical

question this was a later killing# after the interrogation#
that's what makes it wholly different from the present ease «—

MR, Z IE,MBA*

Yes,

I would answer that off the

top of my head that questioning could, with propriety# ensue
on th© second killing, but after exercise of the right to
remain silent on th® first offense, th® police officers could
not go back to that interrogation.
Anything further?

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. KHALIL, ESQ,#
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KHALIL*

I think from th® examples that have been

given in this particular case, some of th® answers that have

50

been given by the respondent to them, indicating that son©
of the answers are very difficult, I think that the Court can
so© what a Pandora*s Box would b© introduced into this case
should the per ss© rule stand»
1 think that it* s clear on that basis why so many
States and so many federal jurisdictions in this country have
rejected that rule»

It*s not a workable rule, that the more

workable rule la the totality of circumstances test»

ted

many of the examples given by counsel for the respondent are
examples of bad faith of the police»

For example, failure to

take no for an answer, coming back tea times to a particular
defendant, to get him to waive his rights under the
Co ns td tution»
1 fci^ink that —»
QUESTIONs

Mr» Khalil, whan you say totality of

circumstances, you mean totality of circumstances as to
whether there is «— that Miranda rights have been waived, and
not totality ©£ circumstances as to whether to© confession
is involuntary under praHMiranda standards»
MR» KHALIL;
QUESTIONt

Ibat*8 correct, Your Honor.

If there had been, your point, gross

deliberate violation of the letter and spirit of Miranda,
then the confession should be inadmissible, regardless of
whether or not the confession was in fact involuntary in fact
and in law, involuntary under the old due process standard.

51
MR. KHALIL*

That’s correct, Your Honor.

The due process clause will take car© of those
situations.
Yes, but the Miranda case was not

QUESTIONS

decided under the due procsss claus®.
MR, KHALILs

QUESTION:

That’s correct# Your Honor,
But let me ask you on© thing:

If we

should agree with' you and remand it# and the Michigan Court
says that this violates Michigan law, that would be all right?

MR, KHALIL*

That’s correct# Your Honor# we have

no objection with what the Michigan Court does based on the
Michigan Constitution*

But we’re her© today because the

Michigan Court took it upon itself to interpret the federal
Constitution more strictly than, this Court itself has ever
.

interpreted that document*

QUESTION* Can there be an infringement of one’s
iKircanda rights, that is# in the language of Justice Stewart#
sufficiently gross# bo that it would require exclusion of a
confessiori under Miranda, but# nonetheless, the statement would

be voluntary under the pre-Mira?..da holdings of th&s Court?
ME, KHALIL:

Z think — there could b$# Your Honor,

I think that certain behavior by the police department, for
example, an .overreaching, overbearing, incessant questioning,
badgering of a defendant, .and obtaining a waiver of rights
sdghfe result in a violation of Miranda,

52
QUESTION*
MR, KHALIL:
QUESTION;

You cite cases so holding in your brief.
That’s correct# Your Honor,
Those cases# as you say# that they are

typified by refusing to taka no as an answer,
MR* KH&LILj

That’s correct# Your Honor# the cases

are legion on that point*

We have them, I believe, all cited

in the brief.
QUESTION:

Even though there's not a holding that

they w<ar® involuntary confessions under the due process
clause»
MR, KHALXLs That’s correct.
I’d also Ilk© to point out to the Court that in this
particular case there was no approach, by th© police, telling
Mr. Mosley, ’’Your rap partner has confessed, com© out and
waive your right®,H

In this particular ce.sa# no questioning

whatever was undertaken by Detective Kill until a waiver of
rights? was obtained, and thereafter, Mr. Mosley was confronted
with his confession*
And I think, in th© words of Mr. Mosley, th© reason,
h® confessed in this case was because he got scared because
of that involvement put on him by Mr. Smith.
One other point that I’d like to point out to the
court Is that th© issue of the arrest has been raised in this
particular case, it’s been our position all through these
proceedings that the arrest was valid.

There are additional

S3
factors which counsel for the respondent hasn’t pointed out
to the Court»

I won’t take up the Court’s time with those

factors# necessarily, except to say that the information -that
Detective Hill got from Anthony Smith, at that particular
point in time probable cause existed to arrest Mr, Mosley
for the murder of Leroy Williams.,
And I think that this Court# under the analysis
undertaken in Brown va0 Illinois# could ver/ well find that#
indeed# the confession was not violative of Miranda# was not
the result of any illegal arrest# even assuming that the
arrest were unlawful in the first instance# any taint would
have sufficiently been attenuated#, and would have made the
confession proper in this case.,
X?d just like to say that in this particular matter#
I don't think that there could ever be a case presented to
this Court in which the waivers that are on this record,
the waivers that have been introduced in court# and the
conduct of these offloors that are on the record here# could
b© any more admirable than is here, The waivers are crystalclear# rasas-clean*
The behavior of Detective Hill# x think is without
question?

that of an officer showing respect for Miranda»
/

The quesfciph came' from the bench earlier as to why the rights
were given twice.

I think that the mason could be# if w© harken back

54
to Miranda, itself, I think that Miranda in this case has
taught the police'officers to give the rights? those rights
wore fully complied with here.
And we would ask this Court to reverse the Michigan
Court of Appeals»
Thank you*
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Thank you, gentlemen»
