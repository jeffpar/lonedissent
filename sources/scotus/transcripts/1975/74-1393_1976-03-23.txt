Hr. Boicourt, you may proceed»

You may raise that

lectern,if you'c like# if it would be more convenient.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL L» BOICOURT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
HR. BOICOURT:

That's fine, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
This matter comes on for hearing upon the grant by
the Court of a writ of certiorari to the United States Court
of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, limited to two specific
questions»
The first issue is whether the respondents, who are
two St» Louis physicians licensed to practice medicine in
Missouri, have standing to challenge in the federal courts
the constitutionality of a Missouri State statute, which
provides that benefit payments may be made to eligible needy
persons for medical assistance, including medical assistance
for family planning services? but that such family services
shall not include abortions, unless same are medically indicated.
The second issue over which the Court has accepted
certiorari is where the Eighth Circuit had jurisdiction to take•
under consideration and determine the constitutionality of a
State statute on appeal from an order of the district court

4
dismissing a complaint, for lack of standing„
A three-judge panel of the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Missouri dismissed Count IIP
which we are now concerned with — the other two Counts not
having been appealed to the Court of Appeals

a respondent’s

complaint, on the basis that although the issue itself may have
been judiciable, the two physicians who brought the lawsuit
were not the proper parties to allege in -the federal courts
that this particular statute was unconstitutionalo
This order granting the petitioner’s motion to
dismiss was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Eighth Circuits
The Eighth Circuit Court found, first, that the
district court was incorrect in its decision on standing and
reversed the action of the district court in finding that these
two physicians did not have standing,,
But the court below did not stop at that point®
The court want on to determine that it had jurisdiction to
reach the merits of the respondent's constitutional claim on
the basis that, the State statute challenge was so obviously
constitutional as not to require remand®
After the court then took up the merits, the
cons ti uutional merits-- of the original complaint, the lower
court ruled that this particular statute was facially
unconstitutional, in violation of the equal protection clause®

5

Count IX, with- .which we' re concerned, of the

plain­

tiff's complaint, which was filed in the Eastern. District of
Missouri, included all necessary allegations in order to
invoke the three™judge district court statute passed by
Congress„
The allegation was that the language in the Missouri
statute that medical benefit payments will not be made to
eligible needy persons for family planning services for
abortions, unless such abortions are medically indicated,
was unconstitutional»
Respondents purported to bring their action on their
own behalf and on behalf of an entire class of duly licensed
physicians in Missouri presently performing or desiring to
perform abortions upon women, minors and adults, who are
eligible for Missouri State Medicaid

assistance»

In response to the complaint, petitioner filed a
motion to dismiss which, among other tilings, raised the point
that the respondent-physicians did not have a sufficient
*

standing to adjudicate the constitutionality of this particular
s tatute»
The only factual matters which went on the record
before the district court ruled on that, motion to dismiss
was a limited number of answers to interrogatories by the
petitioner, in which he noted that ha knew of no official
interpretation of the challenged language and that no medically

6

indicated abortion payments had been made over a period of
three months.

And affidavits of the doctors,, attached to their

suggestions in opposition to our motion to dismiss, to the
effect that they were unsure as to what the statutory language
meant, how it would be interpreted, and that this uncertainty
as to its interpretation chilled their ability to practice
medicine as they deemed most expertise.
This was the entire record on which the Court of
Appeals based its decision to dismiss on the basis of standing.
And that was the entire cord that went to the Eighth Circuit
when the respondent doctors in this case

chose to appeal that

order.
QUESTION':

Mr. Boicourt, does the record

show whether

or not the payments in question would have gone to the patient
and then to the doctor, or would have gone directly to the
doctor?
MR. BOICOURTs

As I understand the system, Mr.

Justice Relinquist, the patient makes application for the
Medicaid benefit payments, and sends that in to the State.
The State then, on behalf of the patient, sends the money
itself directly to the treating physician.
At the time that the Eighth Circuit took up this
matter on appeal, petitioner had never filed an answer.
meaningful discovery had been conducted by either party.
The record before the Eighth Circuit, pertaining to the

No

7
constitutionality of this statute consisted solely of
conclusory allegations included in the original complaint in
the district court.
The district court had not conducted a hearing into
the constitutionality of this statute, and had made absolutely
no pronouncement as to its beliefs concerning the statute's
constitutional merits.
In addition, the petitioners had never had the
opportunity ■--- the petitioner — to present evidence to brief
or to argue the constitutional claims included in the original
complaint.
Nevertheless, the court below not only reversed on
the issue of standing, but went on tc find that it had

jurisdiction to hold that the statute was facially unconstitu­
tional.
QUESTION:

Was there no reference in the oral argu­

ment to these issues?
MR. BOICQURT:

In the Eighth Circuit, Your Honor,

the petitioner did not, brief or discuss the merits below,
believing that it, was an appeal solely from an order dismissing
for lack of standing.
The respondents did brief rather extensively, whether
wot. th> stwwirfc:; was constitutional or not.

Again it would

be our point that their brief and argument concerning that
matter was not responsive to the purposes of the appeal.

8
That is. that appeal from a final order dismissing for lack of
standing; not on the basis thac the statute was unconstitutionals
QUESTION;

Well? you were on some notice*? though? 1

take it? that since they were the appellant, that they were
at least urging the unconstitutionality of the statute before
the Eighth Circuit»
MR„ BCICOURT;

We certainly got their brief first?

and they did brief the constitutionality of the statute»
However, as I say? we did not feel that was responsive
to the notice of appeal itself or to what the district court
did»
If the Court should agree? on appeal? with the district
court that, these physicians do not have sufficient standing
to adjudicate this matter? it. will not be necessary? in my
opinion? for the Court to reach the second issue»

The

respondents? in effect, will be out of court and any considera­
tion as to the merits will then be moot»
In regard to stending, the question before the Court
is not? in an abstract sense? with the Section 208„152(12)?
/

the Revised Statutes of Missouri? is or is not unconstitutional?
or whether the issue of its constitutionality is a judiciable
question; again in an abstract sense.
Rather? it is necessary that the respondent-physicians
allege -and have support in the record before the Court that
•:aey are the proper parties to litigate in the federal courts

9
this constitutional claimo
The only personal interest, which I believe the
respondents can claim is the existence of some degree of
confusion as to the source of payments for abortions performed
on a specific class of present and prospective patients0
And if the respondents, even with the best of
intentions, are expressing only their moral indignation at ‘the
statute, or if they are trying to represent the interest of
pregnant, welfare women who they feel are being discriminated
against by 'the statute, even if they are prospective
patients, that is not enough for them to have standing to use
the federal tribunals and to take up the dockets of the
federal court to adjudicate tills issue about which they have
no personal interesto
I do not believe that the federal courts should
become the foruir for morally righteous crusades„
*

QUESTIONS Well, don't the doctors make any claim
that they would have gotten money -through this plan if the
section which they claim was unconstitutional were stricken,
and that they didn't get the money without it?
MRc 301COURTs

The actual claim in their complaint,

Your Honor, was that they did not. know what the interpretation
of this section -was, and therefore they were deterred in the
practice of medicine, not knowing whether they may or may not
ba paid by the State of Missouri for abortions performed on

10
eligible welfare recipients,
QUESTION; The thought being that if they were to be
paid, they would have done —
MR, BOICOURT; Certainly the inference is made in
their complaint that they would be the ultimate source of
welfare moneys paid out by the State of Missouri, but for -the
existence of the statute.
However, in regard to whether or not they might be
the ultimata recipient of Medicaid moneys paid by the State of
Missouri, I still think that the traditional standing require-’
meats arising out of Article III of the Federal Constitution
requires that they be able to show a. personal and direct
detriment which arises out of the alleged unconstitutional!fcy,
Now, any monetary detriment to the respondentphysicians in this case is indirect®

It doesn’t arise out of

any alleged unconstitutionality; it arises out of the
prospective decisions by patients and prospective patients
regarding abortions, which decision on behalf of the patients
y

may or may hot be affected, by -the existence of this statute.
In other words, if tills statute is to be attacked
on the grounds of its unconstitutionality, and if the federal
courts are to accept that attack as a justiciable question and
consider it, the proper parties to adjudicate the matter are
not the respondent-physicians, but, rather, they are the
pregnant woman who ars most directly affected by -the

11
conjecture and operation of this statute,,
I think it's obvious from a reading of the multitude
of cases cited in both briefs that pregnant women have certainlybeen able to participate in the federal court process involving
abortion litigation»

I think it is even more apparent that

they are protected in this participation by the use of such
names as Roe and Doe,., to protect them from any embarrassment
arising out of their supporting theix’ constitutional right to
abortion»
I think that, given the protection that this Court
has found that it can give to the anonymity of woman desiring
to participate in abortion litigation,, is certainly unnecessary
for the federal courts to entertain litigation which is brought
by persons not within the direct personal causation line of
the statute and constitutional previsions concerned and what
they desire to have be done»
In Roe and Doe, the Court determined that the
constitutional right to privacy was broad enough to encompass
a woman's decision, whether or not to terminate her pregnancy»
Well, that's the woman's right to privacy„ that is
protected by the Constitution»

Certainly she can consult

with a physician to assist her in exercising her decisionmaking process»

But it's still her right which is protected

by the Constitution, he3: privacy»
To be sure, in Do® vc» Bolton,
i

physicians were found

12
to have standing -bo participate in the litigation, but not
on the basis of a constitutional right to privacy? rather, on
the basis that they were to suffer direct personal detriment
from the existence of statutes under which they could be
criminally prosecuted in the State courts in Georgia»
The challenged Missouri statute does not subject
the physici an-respondents to any criminal prosecution»

The

status of respondents is more closely akin, I believe, to the
childless married couple in Roe vs„ Wade who asserted -that if
the wife became pregnant in the futura, they would desire an
abortion? like that childless married couple, respondents may
choose to perform abortions on indigent women, and those women,
if eligible, may choose to apply for medical, assistance as a
means for providing that respondents are paid»
QUESTION;
is likely to happen?

Mr. Boicourt, if you prevail here, what
Would we go back and start all over

again with a pre-par plaintiff?
MR* DC I COURT; Well, that would be up to the people:
who are pushing the particular legislation, Your Honor»
I think it is likely that they will seek out plaintiffs who
are proper parties to litigate the constitutionality of the
statute»
QUESTIONs What do you gain, then, in the long run?
MR. BOICOURT; Well, for one thing, what we really
want to gain — that domes up under 'the second issue -*=» we

13
want to have a hearing on the constitutionality of the statute«,
Secondly, we don’t think that the State of Missouri,
or the officials of the State of Missouri should be subjected
in the federal courts to crusading type lawsuits, like -this one
is.
QUESTIONS

Well, isn't it ~

MRe BGTCOURTs

It’s a matter not only of gaining

in this case, but in the future —
QUESTION;

Isn’t it going to be just, as much of a

crusading type of lawsuit if you have a female patient
plaintiff in addition to the doctors?
MR. BOICOURT;
QUESTION;

Well, a crusading —

I’ve heard that accusation before.

MR. BGTCOURT:

To that, extent, Your Honor, but if

the State is to be, and we are, constantly subjected to
lawsuits, in order to keep 'this to a reasonable minimum, I
think that the federal courts should require that the people
who bring those lawsuits satisfy the traditional standing
requirements of Article III of the Federal Constitution.
QUESTION; Well, my question was premised on the
event of your prevailing here.

I just wondered what you were

hoping to gain in the long run.
MR. BGICQURT: Well, again, Your Honor, it probably
is not as much an existence of what we gain in this particular
case, is that principle it stands for, that if the State is to

14
be sued in the federal courts, the proper parties only will
be the ones who will be entertained,,
QUESTION:

Mr, Boicourt, while you are paused for a

moment, would you help me on the procedure here again?

I

know you covered it, but I'm a little bit lost,
9

MR. BQICOURTs
QUESTIONs

Yes, sir,

Now, what, exactly, is the posture of

Counts I and III?
MR, BOICOURT:

Counts I and III were also dismissed,

but were not appealedc
QUESTION: Were not appealed in -~
MR. BOICOURT: And the petitioner in this case was not
a defendant with regard, to Counts I and III.
QUESTION:

Because as to the standing question,

there would have appeared to have been standing for the
doctors in those counts, I take it you wouldn't have —
MR. BOICOURTs They were dismissed on other grounds.
QUESTION:

On other grounds.

MR. BOICOURT:

Not a case of eontrovery in both

cases.
QUESTION:

I sea.

MR. BOICOURT:

Both federal Medicaid laws* and

Missouri State statutes are designed ho afford optimum relief

to eligible persons whose applications for Medicaid assistance
is denied, or is aggrieved, or whose interest in their

15

application for Medicaid assistance are aggrieved in that
interest, because the statutory framework provides .that they
have a right to seek a hearing, it specifically provides that,
and that if they are not satisfied with that hearing, they
have a specific right to appeal to the appropriate court,,
The physicians are not in any way -- in the Federal
Medicaid laws or in the State statutes which enforce Medicaid
laws in Missouri, physicians are not covered, they are not
covered in any manner? no mention is made of their right to
participate in e hearing, or their right to object to the
failure of an application for Medicaid assistance to go
through,
I think it’s clear that the statutory framework
which Congress and the State of Missouri has created is
designed on behalf of poor people,.
It logically follows that the welfare recipient,
the poor person, should be the one, and was intended by Congress
and the Missouri Legislature to be the one, who could challenge
the portion of that statutory framework which he or she found
to be objectionable, which he or she believed to be
unconstitutional®
Nor do the constitutional provisions under which
respondents claim the statute to be unconstitutional protect
the interest they asserto

I think the lack of standing is

very clear in light of the second portion of the test that this

16

Court, created in the Data Processing and Barlow cases»

1 do

not belie its that the respondents’ standing can be made to
stand up under the zone-of-interest test»
In the first place, Roe and Doe said-that the right
to privacy encompassed a woman’s freedom to the abortion
alternative to her pregnancy»

Certainly the physician who

performs that pregnancy does not share that right to privacy»
He may consult with her and give her assistance in making
her decision, but the constitutional right to privacy which
is protected by Roe and Doe cannot be said to extend to the
physician»
Therefore, I do not think the respondents in -this
case can maintain that they ara within the zona of interest
protected by the due process clause and the right of privacy
it includes»
The court below, whan it reached the merits, found
that this statute denied the equal protection clause, because
it discriminated against women who chose the abortion alterna­
tive to their pregnancy»
Well, if, in fact, this statute does constitute
invidious discrimination, and we do not concede teat — we’d
like to have our hearing — the people discriminated against
are the poor woman who want to have an abortion rather than
take their pregnancy to terra»
I do not think that 'the respondents can maintain

17
that they are within the zone of interest protected by the
equal protection clause in -that regard,,
QUESTIONS

It's clear that the district court saw

no constitutional question, is it?
MR. BOICOURTs
Your Honor.

No, I don’t think that’s clear at all,

The. district court, in fact, empaneled a three-

judge court.

If it had found no substantial constitutional

question, on© judge could have taken care of that.
QUESTIONS
MR. BOICOURTs

I didn't get the last? the —?
If the judge who empaneled the three-

judge court had thought -QUESTIONS

How did it get to the Court of Appeals

if they decided the case on a constitutional ground?

The

three-judge —
MR, BOICOURTs

It would not have gotten to the

Court of Appeals9 in that case.
QUESTIONs
MR. BOICOURTs

Beg pardon?
Excuse me.

Would you please repeat

your question, Mr. Chief Justice?
QUESTIONs When the case first went into the district
court, it went to a three-judge court, did it not?
MR. BOICOURTs

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTIONS And then what did 'the three-judge court
do?
MR. BOICOURTs They dismissed for lack of standing

18
QUESTION:

Well* then* that was a — essentially

the same as the action of a single district judge* was it not?
MR. BOICOURTs

Under Gonzalez* it certainly was*

Your Honor.
QUESTION: And so* otherwise* it couldn't have gone
to the Court of Appeals in this posture* could it?

It came

directly here.
MR. BOICOURT:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

But then you pointed out the Court of

Appeals immediately took on the constitutional question* which
the district court, did not reach.
MR. BOICOURT:
QUESTION:

Yes* Your Honor.

Of course* I think

But you think that their proper procedure

should have been on that issue* if they were going to decide
it* to send it back to the three-judge court, and tell them to
reach the constitutional issue?
MR. BOICOURT;

Yes* Your Honor* I think it should

have been remanded to the three-judge court to reach the
constitutional allegations in the complaint.
I think that — excuse me.
QUESTION:

You don't give up your standing point*

do you?
MR. BOICOURT:
QUESTION:
that position

No.

We 12.* you don't have to give it up to take

19
MR. BOXCOURTs

No, I’m not giving up the standing

point, and X was covering the standing point first, because
if — if the Court should agree with me on the standing
matter, I don't think it's necessary to consider what the
Court of Appeals did with regard to reaching the merits.
I think that question does make a good transition
into the second issue, which is pending before the Court today
on this grant of certiorari.
To say the least, the record pending before the
Eighth Circuit was a vary limited one on which to reach the
merits of respondents' claim that this particular statute was
unconstitutional.
The case had never reached the stage in which the
three»*judge court —- before the three-judge court in which the
petitioner would have had a chance, to defend on the merits?
the fact the petitioner never even had an opportunity to file
an answer.
The district court had only been called upon to rule
upon the procedural matters raised in our motion to dismiss,
it had never considered, except perhaps reading the
conclusory allegation in the complaint, th© constitutional
ques ti ons cone® me d.
28 O.S.C. 1291 provides that a court of appeals
shall have, jurisdiction from all final decisions of the district

20

courts of the United States0
Well# I respectfully submit that the only final
decision before 'the Eighth Circuit was one dismissing a
complaint for lack of standing»

Because the district court

certainly never considered anything other 'than the standing
of the physicians with respect to what they did to Count 11
of ‘the complaint»
When the Eighth Circuit determined that it could
reach the merits# it proceeded to do so,

I believe that it

began to exercise original jurisdiction# which had not been
conferred upon it by Congress»
Furthermore# the complaint# which raised the
constitutional issues# made every allegation necessary for a
three-judge district court to be empaneled; and# in fact# the
complaint specifically requested that a three-judge district
court be empaneled.

Congress has mandated that with regard

to such complaints# that in the first instance they be
considered by a three-judge district, court with direct appeal
to the Supreme Court,
As the matter now stands# in the first instance#
vie constitutionality of this statute has been considered only
by the Eighth Circuit,

And certainly I can see nowhere in

the congressional scheme of federal court jurisdiction where
the Eighth Circuit has jurisdiction# to step into a matter
on an issue like standing on appeal# and reach a decision on

21

the merits»
The Sixth Circuit was called upon to do the same
thing as the Eighth Circuit has done in this case in Roe vs^
Ferguson, a statute extremely similar to the. statute Ve have
here, and again the three-judge district court had not reached
the question of the statute's constitutionality»

The

Sixth Circuit considered and rejected an argument in that
case that the constitutional issue involved — that is, the
constitutionality of the statute -- had been clearly settled
or resolved®
I think the Sixth Circuit correctly remanded their
case to a three-judge district court, so that —
QUESTION:

You think, then, that a limited grant,

limited to questions one and two, the issue of the correctness
of the constitutional determination is before us?
MR» BCTCOURT;
QUESTION:

To this extent, Your Honor, —

What I’m trying to get at, may we reach

and pass upon whether the court of appeals correctly decided
the constitutional question?
MR. BOICOURT:
could reach that.

No, Your Honor, I don't think you

But I think it becomes relevant because

the respondents are alleging that the constitutional issue is
so clear, so clearly settled by the federal courts, that
there is no reason —
QUESTIONs

Well, if we were to disagree with the

22

conclusion on the constitutional question, you suggest we
can’t express that disagreement, but. would have to send it
back to the three-judge court, to let it grapple with the
constitutional question first?
MR. BOICOURTs

Yes, Your Honor9 under the statutory

scheme set up by Congress, I do think that’s the case,
QUESTIONS Actually, if you had sought to challenge
the constitutional ruling of the court of appeals, you would
have come here by appeal and not by certiorari, would you not
have?
MR. BOICOURTs
Honor, either

As I understood the statute, Your

one would have been acceptable.

That although

— I could have raised on certiorari or appeal the constitu­
tional question; but on appeal I could not have raised
questions that were not of a constitutional magnitude.
And there were other questions in regard to standing and their
jurisdiction to reach the merits, that I was not sure about
what the Court would say about reaching the constitutional
magnitude.
*

QUESTION;

So, really, the effect of the Eighth

Circuit passing on the constitutional question here is that
if they decided adversely to the State, the State can come
here on appeal; but if they decided in favor of the State, the
original plaintiff can come hare only on certiorari.
MR. BOICOURT: That is correct

23
QUESTIONs

The court of appeals did not issue an

injunction? they didn't issue a declaratory judgment? they
didn't issue anything? did they?
MR. BOICOURT:

The court of appeals declared the

statute to be tin.constitutional»
QUESTION;

It just said so in its opinion? it didn't

issue on©? a declaratory judgment as such? did it?
MR. BOICOURT:
QUESTION:

In a separate --

MR. BOICOURT:
QUESTION:
filed?

No? Your Honor? ~

— it did not.

Was anything different from the opinion

Was there a declaratory judgment?

No.

No injunction

was filed.
MR. BOICOURT:

That is true? Your Honor.

But I

don't think that we should allow the court of appeals merely
by not saying in its opinion? "we hereby enjoin the State" to
avoid tli® clear legal rule that they have only appellate
jurisdiction.

Because certainly the State is going to abide

by a ruling on the constitutionality of one of their statutes.
QUESTION:

Well? they — as I remember? they said

in their opinion that they expected you to abide by it? didn't
they?
MR. BOICOURT;
QUESTION:

They certainly did.

Thats s right.

MR. BOICOURT: And I

24

QUESTIONs

I'm not quarreling with that, but I mean

it’s so strange for them to take an action which, if they
were a district court, they would have had to issue an
injunction or a declaratory judgment»

But sitting as a court

of appeals, they do the same thing, but they don't — on the
other hand»
MR, BOICOURTi Exactly, Your Honor»
QUESTIONs

I'm confused»

MR» BOICOURTs

This Court has never decided, and

had not decided at the time the Eighth Circuit rendered its
opinion, whether a Stata must provide payments to indigents
for non™therapeutic abortions•

They also provide pregnancy

payments for those who take them to term»
Now,

excuse me, Your Honor? I see that ray time

is up»

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK SUSMAN, ESQ»,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR, S US MAN s

Mr, Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
This statute providing, as it came out in oral
argument during the appellate hearing, it was clear that what
the State means for medical reasons, therapeutic abortions,
only those abortions which were necessary to preserve the

lit; or health ware to be reimbursed, under this statute»

QUESTIONS

Well, before you get to that, won’t you

tell us about the jurisdictional question»

.

What

authority did the court of appeals of the Eighth Circuit have
to deal with the constitutional question hare?.
MRo S US MAN: We agree with the petitioner that the
Hornbook type of black letter law is clearly that issues not
decided below will not be decided on appeal? and yet, as we
attempt to point, out in our brief, there are exceptions which
have bees; accepted by every circu.it to this general black
letter rule»
QUESTION:

Well, apart from that issue, can the

court of appeals set aside a State statute?

On constitutional

grounds.
MR» SUSMAN:

While the three-judge federal statutes

would appear to give the jurisdiction solely to the threejudge district court panel, we would —
QUESTION:

"Would appear to".

MR* SUSMAN:

I’m sorry?

QUESTION:
MR. SUSMAN:

You say "would appeal to™»
Right.

We would suggest that in the unusual situation that
occurred here, that once the matter is before the court of
appeals, and assuming for the moment that it is a clear
matter, that in the judicial economy and the administration of
justice there is nothing to faa gained by sending it back, the
#

26

very purpose of the three-judge panel, so that one single
judge does not have the authority in which to set aside a

No, there certainly was not.

MR. SUSMAN; No, it was not.

So we would only contend

that the purpose of the three-judge panel, not to give that
type of power to one judge, has not been ignored or avoided
here, because three federal judges did rule on the issue.

QUESTION: The constitutional right of the doctors,
not of the patients,
MR, SUSMANs

I think there5s a line of cases in

which individuals, whether physicians or otherwise, have a
right
living,

of liberty to pursue a lawful profession and to earn a
I think doctors have a particular right

well, of

course, part of it —• it's very hard to separate, and that's
one of tiie standing arguments.

That the confidential relation-

ship between a physician and a woman in regard to abortion
procedures is basically inseparable? it's very hard to
distinguish and segregate out the respective rights of each.
Because it is a joint decision under the wording of Roe and
Dee.,
The cases, 'the abortion eases, not -- ignore for the
moment all those cases which provide criminal penalties? all
statutes adopted subsequent to 1973,

In every one of those

cases, even the ones that had no criminal penalties, doctors

32

were held to have standing to assert their own rights and
those of their patients.
In other Medicaid context, other than abortion,
doctors and the providers of medical services , institutions,
hospitals, nursing homes, have all been consistently held to
have standing to assert the right to Medicaid payments on
behalf of the people that they treated.
The Petitioner has cited not a single case of
abortion or of Medicaid nature in which physicians were not
held to have standing to assert these type of payment rights
on behalf of their patients,
QUESTIONs

You're speaking now about standing,

I

was wondering about constitutional rights on behalf of the
doctors,

What constitutional right does a doctor have to

claim entitlement to a medical fee provided by the State for
people, who can't afford to pay their own fees?

What

constitutional right?
MR,5USMAN:

He may not have any constitutional

right, but I think he has other interests.

The court of

appeals, for example, made specific holdings that, in two
ways, that. No, 1, this statute which excluded payment for
abortion. No, 1, infringed upon his medical practice and, No,
2, caused him economic hardship.

And both of those factors

they considered to give him separate standing.

Each,

independently, was enough to give him standing in the opinion

33

of the court of appeals0
The financial detriment that he experienced, and
also the fact that his right to practice medicine was being
infringed upon»

As to standing, we feel that, again as we indicated,
that Petitioner has not cited a single case dealing either
with abortion or Medicaid in which physicians were not held to
have standing on behalf of their patients' rights.

are numerous cases in which they were held to have such
standing, and many of these are in no way analogous to Doe vs»

future -refusals of payment.

saying how did that affect his patients?

But I'm

As I understand

that, it's saying that he's been doing it for nothing.
MR. SUSMAN % That’s correct.
QUESTION:

Well, then, how is that — does that

adversely affect his patients?
MR. SUSMAN:

It would not adversely affect those

patients upon whom he had to date rendered services, except
that he may well have a private contract right back against
them for payment.

Which, I admit, it would have a greater

effect upon the patients.
QUESTION:

He may well have, but he hasn't alleged

that he has? he didn't say so in his affidavit.
MR. SUSMAN: That is correct.
QUESTION:

It seams to me 'that you're limited to

whatever standing you have as a doctor, who says, "I want to
do a lot of work, and perhaps I won't get paid for it.K

Which may or may not he sufficient, but I really
don't see your claim on behalf of the patients, because I
don't see that you have anywhere alleged that any patient on

MR» SUSMAN;

No, I do not believe there is -- I

agree with you there is not a specific allegation to that

that doctors will not continue providing services for free»

hospitals are net doing ~
QUESTION;

Caii we rely on common sense -~

QUESTION:

— [inaudible] ~ does it?

MR» SUSMANs

No, it is not»

QUESTION;

I just wondered, can we rely on common

sense about doctors in general, or do you have the burden of
saying, "This doctor in particular is able to assert this
particular” —
MR» SUSMAN:

Yes, I think the respondents have that

burden»
I think the doctors, physicians have standing not only
in their own right as we previously indicated, but also on
behalf of their patients, both the right to practice medicine,
which several lower courts have held, both the economic
interest, which we've already discussed»

We also believe

38
that they have the logical nexus which is necessary.
We think the general rule as far as deciding the
question on appeal

„

which has not been decided below# is

basically that an appellate court dees not lack the power to
do what plainly ought to be done# and that appellate court’s
decision to consider the merits in the case upon appeal#
although not decided below# is a matter of judicial discretion#
and is not really a limit on jurisdictional power.

Basically

that was the holding in Mercury Motor Express»
In a decision# a recent decision out of the Seventh
Circuit# authored by Justice Stevens# Fitzgerald vs„____ ?
Memorial Hospital# in that case a single judge dismissed for
lack of standing and yet the court of appeals went on in that

as clear as perhaps if. should be regarded in this case.
But the court of appeals went on to rule on. the constitutional
merits .

I would think that if both of the

QUESTIONS

And that was the only motion that was

MR, SUSMANs By the district court? that is correct,
QUESTIONs Well, why isn't that all that wa3 before
the court of appeals?
MR. SUSMAN;

I think the answer to why that was not

all -that was before the court of appeals is because respondents
moved on their own initiative to attempt, in every way
possible, to bring the merits before the court of appeals,
both in their brief and in oral argument, which they did,
and which the court of appeals, either rightly or wrongly, and
of course it's for ’the Court to decide, but they did accept.
Certainly counsel for Petitioner and Petitioner were
forewarned that the merits were going to be — there was going
to be every effort to contest them and to argue them on appeal,
Sorae 80 or 90 percent of the Appellants* brief constituted
the merits,
QUESTION? All I'm saying is what was before the
court

was the granting of a motion to dismiss,
MR, SUSMAN; That was 'the only ruling by the district

court.
QUESTION? And • that was all that was before the court

41
of appeals»
MR» S US MAN; We would argue -that, that was not all that
was before the court of appeals 0
I am not in position to say whether the court of
appeals acted correctly or not, but certainly the respondents
made every effort to bring the merits before them, and they ~
for the various reasons, and we think the reasons that other

circuits have dona exactly the same thing in like cases

which we believe 'they hadf and to rule on the merits»
QUESTION: Well, you can’t escape probable burden,
counsel, of sustaining what — trying to sustain what the
court of appeals did*
QUESTION;

That’s what the case is ail about»
You merely — I don’t think you mean what

you say,,- that other circuits have done the same -thing in like
cases»

There aren’t any other precedents for a court of

appeals deciding a constitutional issue which should normally
be presented in the first instance to the three-judge district
court, is there?
MR, SUSMANt

No, there are not»

We could not find

any cases on either side on those specific facts with QUESTION;

I thought that was a case opposing your

position in the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, the
position in the Sixth Circuit»

MR» SUSMAN; The Sixth Circuit, was asked to do

42
basically the same thing»
QUESTIONS
MR» SUSMAN:

Yes»

And declined to, didn’t it?

They did» They sent it back to the

panel for determination of -the constitutional merits,,
But we would suggest that whether or not the court
of appeals decided to send it back or to retain it and decide
it. on their own initiative is a matter of discretion to be
exercised, and the fact that the Sixth Circuit and the Eighth
Circuit reached opposite conclusions as to the exercise of
that discretion in no manner bespeaks that there was an abuse
of discretion by either circuit»

And that the test to be

utilised here is whether or not they abused their discretion
in ruling upon the merits»
QUESTIONS

Well, do you think the court of appeals

was exercising appellate jurisdiction or original jurisdic­
tion?
MR» St’S MAN s

I'm not quite sure»

I haven’t seen, in

all 'the commentaries and texts in other cases in which issues
are decided which weren't decided below, I have never seen a
discussion as to which classification of rubric this might
fall in»
QUESTIONs But, in any event, whether it was exercising
original jurisdiction or appellate jurisdiction, it was doing
so quite inconsis .;antly with the three-judge court legisla­
tion, which gives jurisdiction to a three-judge federal court

43
to enjoin a State statute on a constitutional basis, and gives
appellate jurisdiction to this Court to review that
constitutional determination? and the one court to which it
doesn't give either original or appellate jurisdiction is the
court of appeals.

Isn't that correct?

MR. SUSMANs

I think clearly it's inconsistent with

the letter of the three™judge panel lav/,
it is inconsistent with the intent.

I do not feel that

Because this Court has

repeatedly stated that the purpose of that is to remove from
a single judge the power to set aside State legislation,
And here three judges had ihc-i opportunity to rule,

MR. SUSMAN:
Honor

That is certainly a possibility, Your

45
QUESTION:

If the court of appeals for the Eighth

Circuit had come out the other way, Mr. Susman, it seems to me
you very likely would have had a pretty arguable complaint that
at that point all you would have had her® was the right to
petition for certiorari, whereas if a three-”judge district
court had decided the case, you would have had a right of
direct appeal on a decision here on the merits,,
MR. SUSMAN:

That is correct, yas0

QUESTIONS So that it does twist around the statutory
system a little bit to have the court of appeals pass on it.
MRo SUSMAN: The only reasons we would urge this
Court to affirm what the court of appeals in the Eighth
Circuit did is that if one examines the different reasons or
justifications, and again, as Justice Stevens pointed out, no
case exactly on constitutional issues has been done, but in
other areas where they have ruled on tine issue, clearly not
decided below -- in fact the only issue constitutionally,
perhaps, is the Fitzgerald case itself.
But if you look at the justifications for the
reasons, they say why, we'rs going to go ahead and rule on the
merits, or rule on an issue not decided below -- and there
are many:

the summary judgment nature of the proceedings,

the clarity to principle, the fact that it affects a lot of
people, and all the recognized exceptions? every one of those,
w© would argue, applies to this case.

46
QUESTION:

What if in this case the resident judge

in St» Louis, the convening judge, had refused to convene a
three-judge district court, saying the issue is so insubstantial
I won't even hear it, and you would then appeal to the court of
appeals on a Goesby v. Osser claim, that it was substantial
and should have been a three-judge court»
Should the court of appeals, hearing a Goosby v, Osser
contention, say, Well, not only was this substantial, but we
know the answer.

Well, why send it back to the district

court, we'll just tell them the answer right now;

it's not

cons titutional.
MR. BUSMAN; Certainly for consistency, if not for
any other reason, I would agree that they would have that,
authority in a given case which fit the facts and circumstances
of the type of case that ought to be decided on that basis,

between —
QUESTION:

Wall, actually at page 27, doesn't what

Mr. Justice Rehnquist just suggested, isn’t it implied in
this paragraph:

The statute in question is obviously

unconstitutional, and it is our view that the case might
well have been decided by one federal judge; accordingly, we
choose to make final determination of this case.
MR. BUSMAN: That is exactly true, because in fact
prior -•*

QUESTION:

It may be exactly true, but neither

4?
a single judge nor three judges —
MR. S US HAN; Righto

QUESTION:

— aver passed on the constitutional

question.
MR. SUSMAN:

Well * that is not exactly correct.

Prior to this decision which came down in December 31
of 1974t some 15 other federal judges had passed on the
identical issue of whether, excluding abortion from Medicaid
payments was a denial of equal protection.

Since the decision

of December 31, ’74 — and 'this, of course, is only in retro­
spect, •*- an additional 11 judges have so held.

And this is

all —
QUESTIONS All outside the Eighth Circuit?
MR. SUSMAN:

Yes, sir.

No, net all outside,, some were.
QUESTION: Well, I mean before this one.
MR. SUSMAN: Some of 'the 15 were within the Eighth
Circuit. Soma.

,

QUESTION: Were they within Missouri in the Eighth
Circuit?
MR. SUSMAN:

QUESTION:
MR. SUSMAN:
QUESTION:

No.

Non®.

None of them.
In addition, —
It might well have happened that the

panel you caught on the C.A.Eight might not have included a

48

Missouri judge.

It happened that you did catch one, a

Circuit judge, but no district judge,,
MR» SUSMANs

In addition to those 15 judges who had

ruled on the exact eq'aal protection argument of the Medicaid
exclusion, there was also a host of other federal judges who
*

had ruled on the exact eqtial protection argument in the public
hospital context, and we would submit that there could be no
distinction between the. two.

Because the same argument is

that if a public hospital or if the State through Medicaid
provides maternity services, then the right of equal protection
means -they must also provide abortion services„
QUESTION5

Now, going back to my other question,

I take it, then, -chat idle Eighth Circuit didn't do this
entirely sua spcnte?
MR* SUSMANs

No, they were — they were urged by

appellants, respondents to do so.
QUESTION;

Quite clearly,

Just to restate your ultimate argument,

if I may, your point really is that the defense is so
frivolous -tiiat it raally wasn’t a three-judge court case at
all,

That it could have appropriately been decided by a

single judge in the district court, because the defense is
frivolous end therefor© there was no substantial federal
question?
MR. SUSMAN:

While I agree with that argument, I do

not think that that statement is synonymous with the situations

49
under which a court of appeals can rule upon an issue not
decided below.

I think this is a case where they could rule,

but —
QUESTION?

No, I appreciate that, but the way you

get out of a three-”judge court problem is by saying this is
the kind, of issue that a single judge could have decided, and
therefore you rely on

this analogy of other court of

appeals decisions»
MR. SUSMAN:

That, and I think there are two other

ways to get cut.
The first being th© fact that the intent and ‘the
meaning and purpose of the three-judge court has not bean
obviated here, because three federal judges did —
QUESTION; Well, that's an entirely different
argument»

I see.

Yes.

QUESTION; The first, argument is sort of a Bailey v„
Patterson arguraent0

It was a Bailey v.

Patters on situation»
