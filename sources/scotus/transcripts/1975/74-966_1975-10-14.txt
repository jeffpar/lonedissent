PRO CE E DI N G S
MS. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 74-966, American Foreign Steamship
Company against Mafcise.
Mr. Tetreault, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS L. TETREAULT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TETREAULT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case involves the imposition against the ship
owner of penalties in excess of $35,000, and this amount,
mind you, is in addition to an award in favor of the seaman
or the seaman's estate of the sum of $510, plus interest,
which amount had been thought by the ship owner, found by the
District Court in the first instance, to have been an amount
which was in fact paid to the seaman as part of the ship
owner's obligation to pay his wages in full.
Throughout the handling of the case in the District
Court, in the Court of Appeals—and I think there is no
question of the law on the subject—the ship owner—-the money
was paid in Vietnam under circumstances where US dollar
currency by the local law was not permitted to go into
circulation.

I assume the reason was simply that there was

a great disparity between the black market rate and the

4
official rale.
The seaman was discharged for cause.
question about th .t.
case.

It also ha;

There is no

That has been conceded throughout the

been held, even by the Court of Appeals,

whose opinion imposed this penalty, that the cost of repatria­
tion following a discharge for cause was as between the ship
owner and the seaman the obligation of the seaman.
We thus have a situation which quite literally is one
in which the penalty of $35,000 has been imposed; and if we
apply the maximum of the law, that we will assume to have been
done which should have been done, if everything had been
followed literally, even in accordance with the plaintiff's
desire and wish, the $510 representing the cost of buying air
transportation back to this country would immediately upon the
seaman's return to this country and the payment of the
remainder of his wages, have been returned by the seaman to
the ship owner.
So, one has, may I say, either absurd or outrageous,
depending upon the point of view, a situation in which we have
a penalty in excess of $35,000 imposed for the theoretical
deprivation, takirg the plaintiff's case at its best.
Q

You say it is conceded that the sailor, the

seaman, owed the ship owner for the airline?
MR. TETREAULT:

Whether counsel concededs it or not,

he did concede it in the District Court; in the Court of Appeal

5

there was a holding that the cost repatriation was the
seaman's obligation, not the ship owner's»
Q

Even though the ship was obligated to get him

out of Vietnam under the law, nevertheless, that did not mean
that they had to pay his way home?
MR. TETREAULT:

May 1 say this is true, but before

I say it is true, may I say that the Court of Appeal refers
to Vietnam treaties and obligations of the ship owner to
bring him home.
Q

They had to get him out of Vietnam, but that

does not mean that they have to get him out at their own
expense.

At least the Court of Appeals said it was the

seaman's obligation, the money.
MR. TETREAULT:

The Court of Appeal said the money

was the seaman's obligation.

ly went further and had some

discussion about Vietnam treaties

and ship owner's

obligcitions.
Q

It did not seem to make any difference to the

Court of Appeals whether it was his obligation or not;
whether it was or whether it was not, this penalty was to be
imposed,
MR. TETREAULT:
Q

That is correct, Your Honor.

Also under treaties it might have been the

ship owner's obligation to get him out of Vietnam; there was
nothing in that treaty that required the ship owner to send

6

him to the United States of America.

It was just to get him

out of Vietnam.
MR. TETREAULT:

If one ass times there was a treaty

obligation, that is correct.
Q

It could not have gone beyond an obligation to

get him out of Vietnam.
Q

Why is not the payment for the air fare made in

Saigon treatable as a partial payment of wages?
ME. TETREAULT:

This is exactly the ship owner's

position, Your Honor, exactly.
Q
that it was not.

Why is it not?

You say it is.

It was decided

Why?

MR. TETREAULT;

I have spent many hours attempting to

understand the Court of Appeals first opinion.

I believe in

good conscience and the best that my study can come forward
with, that the explanation lies in a misreading of this Court's
opinion in Isbrandfcsen v. Johnson.
has some familiarity with that.

I assume that the Court

That is a case in which the

ship owner offset or attempted to offset against the seaman's
wages the costs of deviating the ship to provide medical
treatment to a seaman who had been, without justification,
stabbed by the seaman plaintiff who was suing for his wages and
penalty wages.
The holding in Johnson v. Isbrandtsen in its express
terns, and I quote, is that the—well, three dots, if you will,

7
before that-—that the ship owner, and here is the quote,
so far as "deductions for derelictions in the performance
of duty," is limited to the specific fines and penalties that
are provided in Section 701 or a few other miscellaneous
provisions of the statute.

The heart and the basis of the

misunderstanding by the Court of Appeals in this case and some
of the trouble in the other circuits relates to the extrapola­
tion of the carrying beyond the holding of this Court, which
related to penalties, into the subject which we have here
where there is in fact an attempt, with the consent of the
seaman, with all sorts of official watchdogging, if you will,
of a payment in kind of an attempt to actually make the full
payment to the seaman.
Q

If the seaman had gone with him to the airline

office and they had given him the cash, the seaman the cash,
and said, "This is part of your wages," and the seaman had
bought his own ticket, there would not have been any problem,
I guess.
MR. TETREAULT:
Q

There should not have been.

They might have violated Vietnam law giving him

the cash,having the currency there; but, nevertheless, there
would not have been any problem, I do not suppose.

The real

problem is paying a third party, what the plaintiff claims what
the seaman owed him.
MR. TETREAULT;

I think there is no question under

8

the record we hava in this case that the seaman in fact did go
to the airline office, accompanied by the agent; the money was
paid to the airline.
Q

But they paid it directly to the airline?

MR. TETREAULT:

This could be.

And here we have the

problem that the ship owner faces, that if he had given the
cash to the seaman one second before he gave it to the agent,
theoretically there on that side you have a technical
violation.
Q

If you do not prevail on your submission that it

was wages that were paid when he got the airline ticket, is
there then any doubt he would be liable

for the penalty per

day dated from the day when the wages should have been paid,
assuming now they were not?
MR. TETREAULTs

Assuming that this did not constitute

legal payment, then we come to the question of the quantum of
the penalty; is that correct, Your Honor?

V*

Q

Yes.
K.iy5

MR. TETREAULT:

I think there is a very, very

serious question, and here we have—I do not intend this as a
digression, but this brings I think into play the entire
subject of this group of statutes and how they are being
handled and what is to be done in ffirness on both sides.

The

enforcement section of more than one hundred sections of Title
46, which are designed for protecting seamen, particularly in

9

their wage relationships.

The enforcement section is this

Section 596, which is directly before the Court, and which,
as the Court is aware, provides that there shall be a penalty
of two days pay for each day that goes by where the master
or owner who refuses

or neglects to make payment without

sufficient cause.
t

It has been held by this Court, so far as I am
aware, consistently in the opinions of this Court, since
Pacific Mail Steamship v„ Schmidt, that the "without
sufficient cause" language should be read as including within
the statute a rule of reason so that if the ship owner is
acting reasonably at any stage of the process in which payment
is not made, the penalty is not triggered, and this is true
even though there may be a technical legal failure on the
4

ship owner’s part in having either made payment in the wrong
manner, in the wrong medium, or having made an improper
deduction„
In the Schmidt case it was held by this Court that
the ship oiraer had a valid—let us say by valid I mean a
colorable and arguable, a good argument from appealing from
the District Court opinion and during the course of the
appeal, this Court reversed the Court of Appeals decision
which had imposed the penalty during the course of appeal,
saying in effect that the ship owner was entitled to pursue
his rights, that is, to inquire whether he was right at any
1

10

evento

In this case, in my view of it, we have the strongest

possible situation where we not only thought in good faith that
we had made payment; we complied with the requirements of the
statutes and the regulations which have set up a very, may I
say, extensive infrastructure of bureaucracy, in the good
sense of the word, to enforce the seaman“3 rights.
complied with in Vietnam.

These were

The vice consxal was present and

members of -the Coast Guard.
The Court of Appeals with, may I say, no reason and
no justification in the record, stated that the presence of
the United States vice consul and the Coast Guard officers—
that they were not acting within their official capacity.

There

was simply nothing in the record and no justification for that.
Q

Does the record indicate how it was that they

were present?
MR. TETKEAULT;

The record does not indicate who

called whom, but that record does indicate the vice consul was
inquiring into the circumstances of the discharge, into the
loggings, that he performed all the duties which the statute
requires him to perform, including the issuance of a certificate
of discharge to the seaman, the assuring that he had received a
wage voucher, the participation in the determination that the
seaman wanted to be repatriated by air and consented to this
procedure.
What occurs to me as the only possible explanation

Ii
is that in this mass of statutes “--and there are more than 100
sections and detailed regulations--it simply may have well
escaped the attention of the Court of Appeals that this
procedure was one that was called for by statute, and that
the vice consul was not just simply acting gratuitously.
Q

The Coast Guard?

MR. TETREAULT;

The Coast Guard, I suspect—-and the

record does not disclose except that they all came"—as far
as I con aware, the Coast Guard was an attempt, presumably at
the request of the vice consul because presumably the Coast
Guard officers had had some experience in the shipping
commissioning capacity and had greater familiarity with the
signing on and off of seamen.
Q

Let us assume it was determined after studying

whatever lav/s or treaties there are that it really was the
ship owner's duty and also his financial obligation to return
him to the United States, that it was to be out of his pocket,
not the seaman's, and that he just made a mistake, he had
just been wrong.

You would still

say there was a good faith

defense, I understand from your answer to Justice Brennan,
as far as the penalty was concerned?
MR. TETREAULT:
or proper answer.

I did not, I believe, give adequate

What I think is very strong or outstanding

in this case is the fact that we not only went through all of
those procedures, there v/as a trial in the District Court in

12
which the District Court, found that we had in fact made payment»
So* we would think that the ship owner,

so far as the

question of sufficient cause is concerned, or a rule of reason
or an entitlement to—-assume, if you will—among other things,
should have been, at least so far as the calculation of the
quantum of the penalty is concerned, entitled to, may I say,
rely on the--after a full contest, there was no default
procedure—decision of the District Court after a trial that
payment had been made.
Q
to that time?

That may be so, but what about the penalty up
Assume you are wrong that it was really the

ship owner's cost to send him home.

Assume you are wrong.

How about the penalty up to the date of the trial?
MR. TETREAULT:

I would think that up to the date of

the trial—
G

You are still under the understanding that you

were paying him, that you had paid him, and you were advised
that you had paid him and that it was his cost, not yours.
MR. TETREAULT:

And so far as the calculation of a

period of time is concerned, I would think that certainly through
the decision--there were two decisions of the trial court, of
course.

The first found that we had paid.

I would say that

through that one we are affirmed in the sufficiency of our
cause in persisting in our, we are assuming, a wrongful belief.
And I would say that certainly in applying the rule of reason

13
that the courts have applied and,. I would say,, that this
Court applied in the Schmidt case, we were entitled to
persist in this assumed erroneous course, certainly through up
to the time of the opinion of the Court of Appeals, and 1
would suggest through the—up to the time of the second judgment
of the trial court which was entered in response to the mandate
and injunction of the Court of Appeals, based not only on the
opinion of the Court of Appeals in this case but on the
intervening opinion of the Court of Appeals fox* the Ninth
Circuit by a different panel in Escobar.
Q

If you were right about that, assuming you

had some penalty to pay, how much would the penalty be?
MR. TETREAULT;
of approximately $29

The penalty calculates at the rate

per day, and presumably the--! am sorry.

I do not have at the moment the date of entry of the trial
court judgment.

I would say that would have been last June.

It would be approximately $8,000, I would think, Your Honor.
Q

As against. $35,000?

MR, TETREAULT;

That is correct, Your Honor.

On the subject of discharge and this mass of
statutes that I was touching upon, although the amount here
was $510, under the statute it of course would be triggered
by any failure to pay if it were willful, even though it were
a matter of just a few cents.

And among the mass of statutes

and the qxiestion of airline versus other repatriation, there

14
is a statute, 46 JSC, Section 683, and this must be the one
that the consul and thr Coast Guard ware addressing their
attention to even -though the master had not, that the master,
in case of a discharge abroad, shall provide any seaman so
discharged with employment on a vessel agreed to by the seaman
or shall provide him with one month’s extra wages, if it shall
be shown to the satisfaction of the consul that such seaman
was not discharged for neglect, of duty, incompetency, or injury
incurred on the vessel.
This is not our case.

He was discharged for

misconduct, and there is no question on that, and that is
conceded.
Q

I gather your first position is that he was

paid, full wages and therefore there is no penalty involved.
MR. TETREAULT:

That is correct.

*

Q

If you are wrong about that, your second

argument is that in any event you have a good faith defense
and you still owe no penalty? is that it?
MR. TETREAULT:

That is correct, Mr. Justice, and

the statutory provision that I just adverted to I think points
up the absurdity of the result because if the ship owner in this
case, as it did not, had discharged the seaman wholly without
cause, the ship owner's obligation would have been to pay one
month's wages or to find him a work away job on another ship.
There is no requirement for air transportation home so far as

15
the statutes are concerned.
Q

Mr. Tetreault, if you take a look at page 5

of the tan appendix where there is the statement, apparently
furnished by your client to the respondent, of deductions and
look down in the lower half of the page where it says first in
caps "DEDUCTIONS TRANSPORTATION SAIGON TO SAN FRANCISCO
$510/' and then right below that it says, "Advances, such and
such," and then beyond that it says, "Slop Chest, $51."

I

take it that is a kind of canteen that the man goes into and
gets cigarettes and that sort of thing?
MR. TETREAULT:

That is correct, Your Honor, and

I am glad-—
Q

What is the authority?

Is there a statutory

authority for deducting slop chests, or is that just a
process of consent by the seaman?
MR. TETREAULT:
670.

I believe tiie statute is 46, Section

It requires the ship to maintain a slop chest.

the seaman can buy from it.

It says

And the reason that I am delighted

at the question is that there is no statutory provision for
sales on credit, that is, for deducting

from the seaman's

wages the amount of slop chest purchases.
Incidentally, the form, may I say, although it has
American Foreign Steam on it, essentially follows the forms
that the Coast Guard uses—it is a traditional type of form-they always have had provision for advances for slop chest.

16

And this is another one of those where the money is for the
benefit of the seaman and has traditionally been done and
never has been-Q

Consent is enough without specific statutory

authorization.
MR. TETREAULT:
the slop chest.

This is the case in connection with

Following today, 1 don91 know.

We may have a

mass of slop chest suits; I don't know.
Q

How about allotments?

MR. TETREAULT;

Allotments are specific or statutory,

and that is so specific in the statute that I would make no
argument based on an allotment that was not justified by the
statute.
Q

What about fines?

MR. TETREAULT:

Fines are also specific and fines, I

believe, Mr. Justice, are exactly what was determined by this
Court in

0. 8. v. Johnson.

instance, either in the

1 am not aware of any

course or otherwise, in which since

U. S. v. Johnson there has been a penalty type of—
Q

You mean Isbrandtsen?

MR. TETREAULT:
Q

feat were the fines

MR. TETREAULT;
Q

Isbrandtsen v. Johnson, yes.
imposed for, do you know?

In the Isbrandtsen case, Your Honor?

In this case.

MR. TETREAULT:

There were no fines.

No, I am sorry.

17
The fines are not in controversy for this case»

Those were

in connection with repeated episodes of misconduct in connec­
tion with which he was finally discharged.

And there is no

controversy concerning the fines in this case.

It is

only

the $510.
To conclude very briefly, essentially I believe
where we now are is as a result of a misreading by the Ninth
Circuit and some of the other courts of Isbrandtsen v.
Johnson as reading it as going beyond the deductions in the
nature of penalty.
We also have, perhaps not directly involved in this
case but if I may touch on it, the statutory scheme, which is
very complex, which obviously has caused the Court of Appeal
for the Ninth Circuit in this case some difficulty, perhaps
compounded by the accident in the Ninth Circuit of published
opinions, of which this is one, unpublished opinions by other
panels dealing with exactly the same subject matter, reaching
opposite results and which we apparently under injunctions or
rules of the Court are not permitted to use as precedent or
authority.

So, we have some difficulty in telling what the law

in the Ninth Circuit is.

But we do have the situation in this

case which represents the difficulty that it had in dealing
with the complex statutory and regulatory schemes, and one is
left with the thought, although it may never surface simply
because of the difficulty of another case in which it will be

18
presented, of this Court perhaps taking another look at its
decision in US BuIcarius v. Arguelies in 400 US 351, which
dealt with the subject of arbitration of this type of thing
under the collective bargaining agreement.
Q

I imagine in your argument you could prevail

without reference to Arguelies, could you not?
MR. TETREAULTs

Yes.

This is a total digression,

Your Honor.
May I reserve five minutes?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Schmidt.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. SCHMIDT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SCHMIDT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This proceeding this morning challenges two of the
most important basic rights belonging to American seamen.
The first one became a seaman’s right at the same time that
all American citizens acquired it, the Constitutional right
to due process before being deprived of his property.
The second right is a very important one that makes
enforcement of the first possible.

My respected opponent has

just referred to Section 596 as the enforcement section.
ship owner's position in this proceeding this morning
attempts to render useless this very important enforcement

The

19
section.
I prepared a statement to explain the respondent's
position here, and I do not want to take up a point by point
refutation or discussion of the statement that has just been
made by opposing counsel.
However, on the repatriation point, I am going to
deal with that first.

At the trial—I will summarise by

saying that there has been error carried consistently through
this litigation with respect to the repatriation aspect, the
contract implied on the part of the seaman to repay the
vessel.
At the trial the Court spoke to the seaman's
counsel and said, '’The proposed findings of the defendant
indicate that the shipowner had no obligation to bear the
expense of the plaintiff's return to the United States.

Do

you dispute -that?"
Counsel replieds

"I dispute it emphatically, Your

Honor, but I say it is irrelevant.

It is not at issue in

this trial."

"All right, all right, proceed."

In the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of
law, trial court's findings—

to the bottom of the page:

Two-thirds of the way

"From the evidence it's undisputed

that the obligation to repatriate the plaintiff was not upon
the; shipowner, but was rather the personal responsibility of
the seaman."
The Appellate Court simply accepted that and because,
even down to today, the question of the validity of the
obligation, of the existence of any obligation, on the part
of the seaman to reimburse the ship owner is not actually an
issue in this case.

The question presented by this proceeding

is whether or not the statutory rights given to a seaman by
Congress to ensure that he would not be overreached by
recoupments and repayments asserted unilaterally by his
employer, his employer being historically and today in a position
to produce proofs from foreign places, to obtain the assistance
of consular officials, its own agents in foreign ports,
locally.

There is simply no fair contest between a nomad who

worked on a ship for a while and the corporation that owns and
operates those ships.
Q

So, you suggest that we're entitled to decide

21

this case on the assumption or accept the finding that it was
the seaman's obligation to pay his airfare home.,

You say it

is perfectly all right to proceed on that basis.,
MR. SCHMIDT:

Your Hononr, I want to say that I

consider that to be completely erroneous but that this
Court's decision would be the same in either event.
Q

So, we may proceed on that basis.

Q

Let us move to the top of page 9 following

the paragraphs you were talking about.

'‘The plaintiff

consented to and approved the purchase of an airline ticket
for his purposes with his money under circumstances that were
arranged by the master and the vice consul with the special
permission of of the South Vietnamese customs officials.

The

purchase of that ticket under those circumstances
constituted the equivalent of payment of monies over to the
seaman."
That is certainly as explicit a finding as we can
have on the subject, is it not?
MR. SCHMIDT:

Yes, Your Honor.

And I think that it

is completely erroneous, and I say that without resorting to
hyperbole.

It is completely erroneous

in view of the

statutory protections which Congress established for a
seaman in order to prevent precisely this kind of finding
being made by a court.
Q

Does it bear on a good faith defense aspect

22

of this case?
MR* SCHMIDT;
Q

I ant sorry?

Dees it bear on the good faith defense issue

in this case?
MR. SCHMIDT:

I think that it definitely does.

I

think that the law with respect to the fact that seamen cannot
contract and cannot enter into any kind of an agreement that
would diminish thair rights to wages at the time they are paid
off before a shipping commissioner, the knowledge on the part
of ship owners, which they certainly are required since 1372
down to the present time to have acquired, the knowledge that
they cannot repay themselves unilaterally from a seaman's earned
wages goes right to the good faith of the entire transaction.
If a ship owner claims that a seaman owes it money,
it must do what everyone else must do in our society who says
that a seaman owes it money.

It must resort to a judicial

process.
Q

What if a seaman agrees, as in the case of a

slop chest, that he has bought so much and agrees to have it
deducted consentually; does the ship owner stip owner still
have to sue him?
MR. SCHMIDT:

No, Your Honor.

The statutes create the

slop chest, and it has historically been the procedure when a
seaman purchases something from a slop chest to sign his name
and the date of the purchase in the official log book.

The log

23

books are printed by the government, and they carry pages
labeled for the specific purpose of keeping track of a
seaman’s purchases from the slop chest.

So, on the day that

he purchases, he signs his name or initials opposite the
amount.

That is statutory.
Q

But the statute does not authorize a deduction

from wages for the slop chest purchases.
MR. SCHMIDT:

I believe that it would be reasonable

to say that a statute that creates a slop chest limits the
percentage that the captain can charge in terms of profit,,
specifies those items that the slop chest must, carry under
penalty of fine.

When the log book carries pages devoted to

keeping that record, it certainly comes close to being
statutory.

It is a formal procedure that is subject to close

scrutiny, and

it requires the seaman's signature in exactly

the same manner that wage advance is made to him in foreign
places requires his signature, in the official log book.
Q

Mr. Schmidt, are you arguing that under no

circumstances could a seaman consent to payment in kind?
Suppose a seaman on his own initiative in Saigon, for example,
had come to a ship owner, putting all currency problems and
regulations aside, and said, "I would rather you buy the
ticket for me.

I’m not really very smart at figuring out how

to get home on the airlines.

the revised statutes, forfeit his lien upon the ship or be
deprived of any remedy for the recovery of his wages to which
he would have otherwise been entitled.

And every stipulation

in any agreement inconsistent with any provision of Title 53
of the revised statutes and every stipulation by which any
seaman consents to abandon his right to his wages in the case of
the loss of the ship or to abandon any right which he may have
or obtain in the nature of salvage shall be wholly inoperative."
Q

That does not say, it does not seem to me, what

you said it said*

That certainly does not say that the seaman

may never consent to receive his wages in some other form or
to have some other payment made such as was made in this case*
What language of Section 600, what particular phrase in it,
do you think supports your contention?

other than is provided by Title 53 of the revised statutes,

Q

That is talking about remedies for the recovery

of wages, not the substantive question of whether the wages
are due and owing or not.
MR. SCHMIDT:

Your Honor, the cases have—I can cite

language to mean that a seaman cannot contract.

The issue is, Were the wages paid by buying an

MR. SCHMIDT:

says:

"In cases in which discharge and settlement before a

Coast Guard official to whom duties of shipping commissioner
have been delegated or required"“—and that is all offshore
ships, including this one, discharge and settlement is
required before a shipping commissioner or the Coast Guard

26
official performing those duties--"no payment, receipt,
settlement, or discharge otherwise made shall operate as
evidence of the release or satisfaction of any claim."
Q

Did you not have a Coast Guard official

present in Saigon and a US commissioner present in San Francisco
when these vouchers were signed?
MR. SCHMIDT:

To answer, Your Honor, there were two

Coast Guard investigating officers present at the time that the
man was discharged in Saigon.
his wages there.

There was no disposal made of

The ship owner at the time of the payoff in

San Francisco said, "I am keeping back $510 of the wages which
I admit you earned

to repay myself for an airline ticket that

was bought for your benefit."

And the cases have been clear.

Gonzales, for example: the man was put in jail.

He signed a

written agreement to repay from his wages the amounts the
captain let him have in order to buy a mattress, to buy some
food, and to procure legal help.

The captain knew that such an

advance—-presumably he knew it-—was illegal because he put down
the sums that he had given to this seaman as fines.

And the

court held that this was not a deduction permitted by statute,
and the double wage penalty was applied.
Q

That is a district court case?

MR. SCHMIDT:

Gonzales was an appellate court case,

I believe.
Q

What if the employer pays in advance to the

27
seaman in cash?

What if the seaman comes to him and says,

"I want a pittle prior payment»

1 had bad luck at the table

and 1 need $100/' and the employer gives it to him in cash?
MR. SCHMIDT:

The usual situation of that kind would

involve the seaman signing an entry in the official log book
that he had received in advance of his wages.
Q

Then when they finally pay him off in San

Francisco, they will deduct that advance?
MR. SCHMIDT:
Q

That is correct.

That advance is quite all right, you say, but

an advance to buy an airline ticket is not?
MR. SCHMIDT:

Yes, that is what I am saying.

That

an advance made pursuant to Section 597 requiring it to be
entered in a leg book and signed by the seaman is a statutory,
legal, and enforceable payment of wages.
Q

That is the way to do it.

If they had entered

that in the log book, this case would not be here, if they
had entered this $500 in the log book as an advance to the
seaman?

You would not be here?
MR. SCHMIDT:

And the seaman had signed it.

If it

had observed the procedures for paying men wages in advance,
there would be no contest.
Q

Is that advance an agreement?

MR. SCHMIDT:
Q

Pardon?

Is signing that an agreement, because you say

20
he cannot make an agreement?
MR. SCHMIDT?

He did make it in yoiir case.

The law permits him to obligate wages

for allotments to be sent to his family for slop chest
purchases and for wages.
Q

I thought you said he could not make any agreement,

what you read.
MR. SCHMIDT:

This is provided for by statute.

He

cannot enter into any kind of agreement with the ship owner or
anyone else-Q

hm I right that the statute you read said any

Is it not an agreement—in quote

MR. SCHMIDT:

The statute permits certain specified

deductions from wages, and the statute that permits deductions
for advances is Section 599 and, given time, I could find the
equivalent of it in the revised statutes because it is an
old law.

It is there.
Q

It provided that a seaman—

I know

that the right to pay seamen advances existed before 1915
because prior to that time a seaman was entitled to demand onethird of his earned wages? and the La Follette Act or the
seaman's bill changed that to one-half.

That is only true if it is signed in the log

book; otherwise it is not.
MR. SCHMIDT:

With respect to wage advances, that is
That is the only wage advance money to a

seaman under the law.
Q

Certainly the first sentence of Section 599,

talking about advances and allotments, would give the impression
anyway that a seaman cannot assign wages not yet earned.

It

looks like a flat prohibition, does it. not?
MR. SCHMIDT:

599 does completely prohibit the payment

to seamen of wages in advance of the time that he has earned
them.
Q
them.

And then it goes on to say that he can allot

But the allotment would take effect after the wage has

been earned, I would think.
MR. SCHMIDT:

That is correct.

So, that is a

statutory provision for an employer to pay out of seamen's
wages, after they have been earned, in advance of the payoff

\
31
before a shipping commissioner»
Q

But I suppose that your opponent's contention

here is that these were not assignments of unearned wages;
this was a payoff of wages that had in fact been earned.
MR. SCHMIDT:

For what it is worth, that argument

can properly be made because the wages had been earned at the
time that the ship owner spent this money.

The man did not

earn any more money after the time that he was discharged.
Q

And if that had gone through the advances

routine here in connection with this airline ticket, it would
have been all right; you would not be here.
MR. SCHMIDT:
Q

That is correct, Your Honor.

Will you point out to me, Mr. Schmidt, where is

it that it says that an advance is to be treated as an advance
only

if the seaman signs the log book that you mentioned; is

that in the statute?
MR. SCHMIDT:

the statute, Your Honor.
Q

Where does that come from?

you correctly, if a seaman came to the ship's captain and said,

would still be owned the $100; is that right?

He would not

have had an advance of wages.
MR. SCIIMIDT:

I think your facts included the

captain making a record of it as an advance.
Q

No, no record.

Just forget it.

He goes to the

safe and he gives the seaman $100, and they don't take out the
log book and go through the formality you suggested has to be
completed before there is an advance.
MR. SCHMIDT:
Q

I think that is correct.

Even though the seaman later says, "Sure, I

got the $100 but you owe it to me anyway."
MR. SCHMIDT:

Q

This is more or less a prophylactic rula.

You

cannot hold the seaman as having received wages unless he has
signed a log book stating that he has received wages.
MR. SCHMIDT:

I think that .is completely correct,

Your Honor.
Q

Incidentally, Mr. Schmidt, while I have you

interrupted, I gather there is a second question here, and
that is, assigning now that the payment for the airline ticket
was not wages, nevertheless, under the statute that is under
596, a ship owner has a defense if the refusal or neglect to
make payment of the $510 of wages was without sufficient
cause.

Right?

That is what the statute says.

What interpreta­

tion do you give "without sufficient cause," only those things
which are by statute expressly permitted as deductions?
MR. SCHMIDT:

That is not entirely correct, Your

Honor..
Q

How far do you go then?

MR. SCHMIDT:

That is the principal point here this

of due process.

It is a denial

But there are other situations in the cases

described—for example, Collie v. Fergusson-—where the ship
owner was insolvent.
Q

You do not seriously assert any due process

claim here, do you?

The due process provisions apply to the

34
Federal Government, the state government, the local government.
The ship owner is not part of the United States or a part of
any state, is he?
MR. SCHMIDT:

I believe that due process--and I might

be wrong about this—I believe that a person who is deprived of
his property in this manner can properly say that his rights
under the Constitution with respect to due process have been
invaded and ignored.
Q

But at this stage the only person who has lost

money is the ship owner.

He lost the $510.

He needs a little

due process, does he not.
MR. SCHMIDT:

Your Honor, that is not true.

He

And until ship owners

introduced the practice in fairly recent times of always
bringing men home whom they discharge or leave abroad, whether
for illness or for cause, ship owners now engage in the
practice of always bringing these seamen home.
Q

Is that for the benefit of the ship owner?

When a ship owner brings a sick seaman home to his family,
that is for the benefit of whom?
MR. SCHMIDT:

The ship owner has a legal duty to

35

Perform it and is doing it as part of the
crew members.

duties owed to his

The law has imposed that duty for a long time.

The seaman is definitely the beneficiary of that.

But when a

ship owner takes back to the United States a seaman who was left
abroad, he is performing an inescapable duty that is imposed
on him by that local government.
Q

No, the local government could not require

anything more than the ship owner get him out of Vietnam.
MR. SCHMIDT:
Q

That is right.

He could not require the destination to which he

was removed.
MR. SCHMIDT:

That is true, Your Honor.

But if he

takes him to Manila, he simply creates the same situation.
Q

Maybe so, but the local government could not

require anything more than removal from that country.
MR. SCHMIDT:
Q

That is correct.

He could not require at all that he be taken

back to the United States.
Q

Mr. Schmidt, I do not think I have yet heard

you say what it is "without sufficient cause" includes as a
defense to the ship owner beyond deductions explicitly
authorised by these statutes.
MR. SCHMIDT:

Sufficient cause has been found to

exist, Your Honor, by the court in situations where performance
of payment was made impossible.

36

Q

That is bankruptcy.

MR. SCHMIDT:

Yes.

Sufficient cause has been found

to exist in a great many cases, more than insolvency, where it

question had ever been earned by the seaman, where the ship

Q
McCrea?

Ilow do you distinguish this case from Collie and

You had started mentioning these.

I would like to

have you follow through on it.
MR. SCHMIDT:

I would be glad to, Your Honor.

In

Collie the excuse was based upon impossibility of performance.
In McCrea the court did net label it in that way, but it is
really clearly indicated that it was also impossibility, for
the reason that the seaman made his application for wages.

He

was told by the captain to appear at the consulate the following
day.

The seaman appeared at the consulate before the time he

was sxipposed to.

He was not there when the captain arrived.

And on the third day after his discharge, he disappeared
entirely.

And the court said this made it impossible--Q

I know what the facts are.

I am just curious as

to whether there is not an element of impossibility of perform­
ance here also.
MR. SCHMIDT:

Your Honor, the seaman probably would

have stayed out there if he had been given the opportunity.

37
Seamen go to the bottom of the shipping list when
brought home.

they are

If they stay in a foreign port, they are in a

very good position to go immediately to work.
Q

Also was there not an impossibility of his

staying in the foreign port here due to local lav??
MR. SCHMIDT:

There were thousands of Americans

there and if the consul had not been prevailed upon to take
an antagonistic attitude toward the seaman, as an American
seaman he had a right to stay there; there were thousands
of Americans and many, many American seamen in the hospital
there.

The circumstances of currency regulations is actually

totally irrelevant here.

If the ship owner wanted to send

him home and the man did not object, then the ship owner was
acting within his rights.

But who should pay the bill is

still not a relevant issue before this Court now.
Q

You are faced with a finding of fact in the

District Court that he consented to this whole procedure.
You just stated that he was prevailed upon by the consul, in
answer to Justice Blackmun’s question.

There is nothing in

the record to support your statement, is there?
MR. SCHMIDT:

Yes, there is.

The captain8s

deposition was taken at Norfolk, and in it he made the remark
the seaman had no one present at the deposition, but even so
the captain made the remark that the Coast Guard had informed
him that after five loggings, the seaman could he forced to

33

spend his money to send him home,, which I think is a clear
implication, a clear insight, into the existing relationships.
Q

Is it not true, and correct me if I am wrong,

by treaty and by South Vietnam law, was there not an obligation
on the part of the owner to remove all persons he had brought
to South Vietnam?
MR. SCHMIDT:

I think that is absolutely correct,

Your Honor.
Q

Then is there not an impossibility of performance

here that equates t^ith Collie and McCrea and the impossibilities
of performance there?
MR. SCHMIDT:

The logical thing to do for a man in

Mr. Matise's position was to keep him on the ship, disrate him,
and keep him aboard the vessel, at least until a port that

Q

But you are saying that having bought an airplane

ticket for him and sent

him back to San Francisco, the

ship owner is to be penalized because he could have put him in
the brig and carried him back in the brig-MR. SCHMIDT:

He could have.

I think it would have

been in abuse of the captain’s power.
Q

I thought you just said that that was one of the

39
options.
MR. SCHMIDT:

It

They prefer

to handle the money, the payoff in San Francisco or in their
horae office; and xt satisfies the requirements of Section 596.
But it is definitely something that the ship owner wants
done.

You can see it from the Schwark case where the seaman

did not have enough money to pay for the ticket, and the
ship owner added its own money.

It is a clear benefit to the

ship owner and I think based on an inescapable duty to the
local government to get that man out; and, practically
speaking, taking him out means bringing him to the United
States.
But the validity of the claim for the cost of the
air fare is not an issue here.
Q

Then it is irrelevant.

MR. SCHMIDT:

It is irrelevant.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Do you have anything further ,counsel?

40
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY MR. TETREAULT
MR. TETREAULT:

Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court

please, I would comment simply on a couple of technical things
that may possibly cause a little confusion.
There was considerable discussion and exploration
of the subject of advances and logging and how one handles
advances and all in the general context

of the complex

problems that one has when one pays a seaman.
We have on pages 4 and 5 of the appendix a reproduc­
tion of the pay voucher.

This is the document which was

worked up,which was under consideration by the vice consul,
the two Coast Guard people, Mr. Matise, and the master in
Vietnam.
The technical thing that I wish to mention for the
possible assistance of the Court is that the statutory
routine for the recording and the making of advances against
wages to which counsel adverted relates to advances against
earned wages made during the time that the seaman is a member
of the crew.
Q

Can the ship owner legally make an advance

before wages are earned?
MR. TETREAULT:
Q

Mo.

No.

I thought Mr. Schmidt said he may actually if

the seaman signs the log book.
MR. TETREAULT:

I—there may—I—-

41
Q

There is a statute, there is a section, which

indicates it is s crime to make payment of wages before they
ara earned.
MR. TETREAULT:

It is my understanding that they

cannot be made before they are earned.

The word "advance"

means advance against earned wages.
Q

The slop chest is--

MR. TETREAULT:

I think there is no statutory

authority whatsoever for the advancing of credit on that.
Q

There is a statutory requirement that a slop

chest be maintained.
MR. TETREAULT:

That is

correct, and it requires

that sales be made to the seaman from the slop chest. They
can just as well be read as cash sales.
Q

But it is a long-standing conventional

practice to extend credit for the slop chest, and the credit
might be extended on the first day of the cruise.
MR. TETREAULT:
Q

Before any wages have been earned.

MR. TETREAULT:
Q

This is usually when it is extended

Exactly.

And that is done all the time.

MR. TETREAULT:

I certainly assume so, yes.

And

counsel certainly presses the point.
Q

So, if a seaman signs on and he goes to the

captain and says, "I need some money.

I am just broke.

I

42
know I haven’t earned it yet," and he says, "All right,. I will
give you $200/' he has committed a crime.

And then when the

seaman has earned the money and the ship owner is going to pay
*

him off and he purports to deduct the $200, the seaman can say,
"Well, I know you gave me the $200, but you have to pay me
again under the statute."
MR. TETREAULT:
Q
still got to

The statute says in plain language that he has
pay him.

MR. TETREAULT:
Q

This is my understanding, Your Honor.

This is my understanding.

Do you think 599 says that?

599, certainly as

I read it, makes it a crime to advance against unearned wages,
but do you think it also says that they have to be paid again?
MR. TETREAULT:

In the sense that the deduction for

those unlawful advances is—since all ship owners understand
this by this time, you would have a serious problem in present­
ing a good faith defense on that particular one, and then you
would have penalties.
Q

And it says these advances shall be no defense

to a liable suit or an action for the recovery of the wages.
MR. TETREAULT:

Yes, that is pretty clear.

So, then

one comes into 596 and one would have a very difficult situation
in presenting it.
Q

Are we dealing with any unearned wages here?

MR. TETREAULT:

No.

No.

This is exactly the point

43

I wished to mention to the Court»

The wage advances that

counsel was mentioning were those to a person who is still a
member of the crew.

In this case the plaintiff had been

discharged, was no longer on the crew.

Pie no longer was a

party to the articles or to the—he no longer was a working
member to whom the official log would be a normal working
document.

He had been discharged and that is set forth in

this document which is four and five, and what we have here is
a question of whether he was paid the wages that he was
entitled to following discharge.

May I suggest that his signa­

ture on this form, which is a wage voucher, that the consul

is

required to administer, is certainly as far as anybody could
have gone to accomplish the equivalent of the signature in the
log book.
Q

And he signed the second one, did he not, when

he got back to San Francisco?
MR. TETREAULT:

The second one, may I point out, is

done before the shipping commissioner here, signed by the
shipping commissioner, signed by the man himself, and is the
government form which is the release which the statute requires
be signed before wages are paid.
Unless there are further questions—
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you very much, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at II1O6 o’clock a*m« the case was submitted,)
