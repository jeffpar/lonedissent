PROCE E DI N G 3
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

first this morning in No. 74-54, Transamerican Freight Lines
against Breda Miller Freight Systems.
Mr. Voorhees, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALPHONSO H. VOORHEES
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. VOORHEES %

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it please

r

the Court:

My name is Voorhees# from St. Louis# Missouri.

I represent Transamerican Freight Lines# the petitioner in
this case.

The case is her© by a writ of certiorari to the

Seventh Circuit.
The facts of this case involve,a lease of equipment
between two trucking companies# two certificated carriers.
They start on January 19 of 1968, at which time the lessor#
the owner of the equipment# a tractor and trailer# leased the
equipment to Transamerican Freight Lines. The lessor was Brada
Miller Freight Systems# the respondent here-# leased the equip­
ment to Transamerican Freight Lines to carry a load of steel
from Detroit, Michigan# at which point the lease was entered
into# to Kansas City# Missouri.
During the progress of the lease and the carriage
of the steal# the truck was involved in an accident in Illinois
injuring one Sandra Wear seriously, and she later filed suit

4
against both Brada Miller and Transamerican.

Prior to trial

Sandra Wear dismissed her case against Brada Miller and
proceeded to trial against Transamerican Freight Lines,
during the course of which trial Transamerican entered into a
settlement with Sandra Wear.
The lease agreement between the parties leasing the
equipment provided for the lease of the equipment and provided
that the lessor, Brada Millar, would furnish a driver, one
Hardrick,who would operate the equipment during the term of the
lease.

The leas© also contained an indemnity agreement provid­

ing that in the event of a loss, the lessor, Brada Miller,
would hold the lessee, Transamerican, harmless from any loss
which resulted from the negligence of the lessor or its agentsor servants.

Th® leas® provided that the driver was to be

considered an employee and agent of the lessor during the terms
of the lease.
Th© Interstat© Commerce Commission has handed down
regulations some 20 years ago governing the relationship of
parties involved; in the leasing or the transfer of equipment
from on© person or company to another for a trip, which is
what we would call this.
leased for one trip.

In other words, the equipment was

And the regulations of the Commission

set forth certain requirements which must be met by the
parties to th© lease in this kind of a situation.
Applying to our case, one of the regulations states:

5

And I am quoting out of the middle of section 1057»3(a) of
the regulations, that the two carriers involved in the lease
must have first agreed in writing that control and responsi­
bility for the operation of the equipment shall be that of the
.lessee.
This case was argued and decided by the Seventh
Circuit, and that court held that the indemnity agreement
involved here violated the control and responsibility provisions
of the Commerce Commission8s regulations.

The purpose of this

lawsuit is a suit by Transamerican, the lessee, against
Brada, the lessor, to recover the amount which Transinnerloan
had paid Sandra Wear to settle the lawsuit, plus the expenses
involved„
As I say.- the narrow issue is now whether or not the
indemnity provision in the lease agreement violates the control
and responsibility provisions of the regulations of the
Commission.
The Seventh Circuit, among the circuit coxirfs of
■appeals, stands alone in holding that the indemnity provisions
are in violation of these regulations, and on the other side
and. holding directly opposite are decisions of the Fourth,
Fifth, and Sixth Circuits, and by implication a decision of the
Tenth Circuit, till of which cases are cited in the briefs.
The question,the Commission has in the past recited
that when they talk about control and responsibility — and 1

6
will quotes

"Possibly subject to some qualifications, it may

be stated that when a certificate or permanent holder furnishes
services in vehicles owned and operated by others, ha must
control the service to the same extent as if ha owned the
vehicles, but need control the vehicles only to the extent
necessary to be responsible to the shipper, the public, and
the Commission for the transportation."
This leas® provided and was complied with in this
respect that -the equipment during the term of the 1 ease was
identified as that of the lessee, the signs, decals, whatever
you call them, of the Transamerican Freight Linas were placed
on the truck and were on the truck at the time of the accidant»
Ths truck was required to and was following the certificated
routes of the Transamerican Freight Linas.

And Transamerican

in carrying out its responsibility, which is provided for by
the lease and the regulations, has ultimately paid the injured
party in this case.
As I have quoted from comments of the Commission in
prior hearings, it is not necessary, it is not the feeling of
the Commission, that the lessee has to control the direct
minute-to-minute, day-to-day operation of the vehicle.

The

lessee must control the service, that is, the routes, the
identity of the equipment, the things which are provided for
in the regulations.

But as far as thte actual operation of the

vehicle itself, the lessee is permitted to allow this equipment

7
or direct that it be in effect operated toy others as long as it,
the lessee, is responsible for the operations.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Voorheas, let me clarify a couple of

facts.
MR. VOORHEES:
QUESTION:

Mr. Justice Blackmun, yes.

Does the agreement provide that the

lessee has the right to reject the driver furnished by the
lessor?

Does it go that far?
MR. VOORHEESs

provide that.

The agreement does not specifically

In fact, the agreement in this case, which is

contained in the appendix to the petitioner's brief, provides
that the person operating the truck shall be Howard Hardrick,
the employee of Brada Miller.

It does not ~ now, by implica­

tion, I guess by actual words, by making that provision the
lessee has at least accepted Howard Hardrick as the driver of
the equipment.

Hardrick was an employee of the lessor, Brada,

prior to the time of the leas®.

He was an employee of Brada

after the lease, and by -the terms of the lease was an employe©
of Brada, the lassor, at the time of the lease.
QUESTION:

As I understand it, the indemnification

clause here doesn't apply to the lessee's own negligence.
MR. VOORHEES:
QUESTION:

That's true.

Do you think the case would be different

if it did?
MR. VOORHEES:

No.

I think if we read the amici

8
curia© brief filed by the Interstate Commerce Commission and
the United States, they are discussing the fact that ultimately
they may enact regulations regulating the area of indemnity
agreements.

Their brief states quit© clearly that they do not

feel that their present regulations do control theses agreements,
and they state that when they do enact such regulations, they
would consider allowing indemnity agreements in certain
.instances and not allowing them in other instances.

But at

this point, the position is that no regulations have been mads
controlling the indemnity agreement prohibiting them or allow­
ing them, they are just not mentioned, therefor® the indemnity
agreement, we contend, is proper.
Mow, your question is directed to if it was the
negligence of the lessee, and I think if we read the amic’i
curia© brief, their feeling is that when they enact regulations,
they would probably provide that negligence of the lessee
would preclude its recovery under an indemnity agreement.

But

this has not been regulated at this time.

issues before this Court.

You say -» I think it bears on the control, whether this is

MR» VOORHEES:

If I may go into a little history,

then going back years, these type of agreements, I think,
generally fell into the category of what was known as the
independent contractor relationship.

The lessee of the equip­

ment, if sued, would generally defend and say that the person
from whom he leased th© equipment was an independent contractor,
and lessees genorally, I think, successfully defended on that
ground.
Now, this is on® of • th© things that the Commission
was attempting to regulat©»

I think that individual owners

QUESTION:

Let me — let's assume there was no

authority was being used and whose bill of lading had been

Now, assume no indemnity agreement or

not?
MR. VOORHEES:

could recover against the lessee.

MR. VOORHEES;

As far as the liability of the lessee.

lessee was liable and th® lass©® has accepted the responsibility and paid.

MR, VOORHEES;

I find in defining the word "controlf*

of an employee to involve some rather nebulous phrases and
sometimes be almost fictitious.

An employer is not going to

control the mimite.-fco-minute operations of a driver driving
&

truck.

He isn't going to be'able to prevent-, him from going

too fast or from failing to stop at an appropriate time.
is going to — the control involved her® is to.refold.

H®

The

lessee controls in that h© tells the driver where to go and what

1.4
routes to follow and what reports to file and prepare.
Th© lessor controls because the lessor is th©
continuing employer.

The lessor is th© one that the man is

going to be working for next week»

The chances are the lessee

won’t see this driver again after the end of this particular
trip.

So that the lessor is then the on® that has uha right

to discipline the employes if he has'violated traffic regulations
or has done something wrong, and the lessor is the one that
could discharge him or provide some other type of discipline.
Now, there ar® two, aside from the fact that we
have the authority of several of the circuits maintaining that
these indemnity agreements are not in violation of the regulations,
two basic reasons here which I urge are,first, the basic concept
of freedom of contract.

I have quoted in -the brief from a case

that’s quits old, from this Court, a 1900 case, and it’s
Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern Railway Company v, Voigt,
provides that the contrast between patties should not b©
invalidated unless it is clearly against public policy, public
right, or public welfare.
Additionally, the courts have held, and this Court
in the cas© of Bowles v. Seminole Hock and Sand Company, that
th© interpretations by an administrative! agency of the
Government of its own regulations are entitled to great weight,
and they become controlling — this is a quote from th© Bowles
cas© — "become of controlling weight unless it is plainly

IS
erroneous or inconsistent with the* regulations.S!
The amicus brief filed in this case by the
Commission and by the United States takes the strong position
that they have not attempted to regulat® indemnity agreements,
that they feel that the indemnity agreement in this case is
appropriate and is valid, and that they do discuss the fact
that in the future they may attempt to regulate these agreements.
I think you can assume from reading their brief that they
probably will, but they have not at this point.
I think that basically that concludes my argument,
unless the Court has any further questions.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
MR. VOORHEESs

I think not.

I have soma time reserved.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. LeritZ.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH L. LERITZ
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. LERITZ:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

The respondent in this case takes a somewhat

different view of the various liabilities and the right of
control and the fact of control.
The questions presented by the petitioner, the
respondent, and the ICC and the United States --■* and- I will
refer to it as the ICC for simplicity — are a little bit
different.

The petitioner states that the question before the

Court is where the lessee assumes control and responsibility

16
for the tractor and trailer#is an indemnity clans© in an
otherwise valid leas© agreement against the regulations?
The respondent sees the question as whether an
agreement to .indemnify for losses due to the operation of the
equipment is in violation o£ the regulations# and tbs ICC
seas the question as whether the agreement to indemnify for
lasses ■— whether the regulation prohibits the lessor from
agreeing to indemnify the lessee for losses caused by the
negligence of the lessor.
Mow# in the amici,

curiae brief# the Interstat®

Commerce Commission claims that indemnity agreements such as
\m have here ar© beneficial because they tend to place the

responsibility for the loss# for the casualty# where it
belongs.

The ICC assumes that the negligence of the driv-sr is

the negligence of the lessor, and it is respondent's position
in this case that the ICC is incorrect in that,for reasons I
hope to develop in my argument.
The regulations require that the exclusive possession,
control, and us© of th© equipment remain in th© lessee, and
of courses not in the lessor.
Now, in the ICC brief the Interstat© Coite arc©
Commission takes th© position that the regulations do not
require the lessee to operate the equipment itself, that th©
lessor can perform that task by furnishing the driver as well
as th® equipment and that subject to th© authority and

17
responsibility of the regulations it can allow the lessor to
perform the ministerial tasks of moving the freight.

In other

words, .it's the Interstate Commerce Commission's position and
the petitioner's position that the actual movement of the
freight^ fch© actual work is don® by the lessor.
On page S of the brief it states that the mar©
performance by the lessor of physical operation of leased
equipment does not negate the lessee’s control and responsibility,
.tod further^ on page 9; under certain circumstances an
indemnity clause might help to indues the lessor properly to
perform the ministerial tasks that under the regulations can
b© assigned to it.

The indemnity clausa might help the lessee

influence performance of the lassor and thereby exorcise
control and responsibility over the lessor.
.And finally, on page 16, the amici
states that providing the driver

curia« brief

leaves physical moment-to-

moment control of the vehicle in the lessor.

This is the

control over ministerial tasks, and the ICC states it is not
the control and responsibility required by 'the regulations.
Now, I. think the ICCs position that the party who
is responsible in fact, and the negligent party, should
ultimately bear the loss is the correct position.

However,

I think it is based on a false premise and therefor®, although
the logic is good, the conclusion is wrong.
And I say this by going back to the histo ry of the

18

the Federal cases, have held the opposite, that the lasses

common law and under th© regulation.
Now, getting back to our assumption that this is a

MR. LERITZ%

Wall, I think both, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, as 1 hop© to explain.

19
A partyir a lessor or a lessee, is not negligent
itself.

It only can be negligent through the act of the

driver.

Now, in this particular situation and in situations

which are generally considered, the driver is driving down the
road and commits a negligent act.
individual.

The act is an act of an

Some employor or corporation or other party

through a legal fiction is responsible for that person's act.
Now, assuming there was no regulation, who would ba
the party responsible for the driver's act?

Under the common law,

and I think I can say this, having investigated it and having
practised in this field for s, long time, under the common law
the special employer, the lessee in this case, would be
responsible.
QUESTIONS
MR. LERITZ;

Responsible to an injured third party?
Yes, sir, responsible to an injured

third party.
QUESTION;.

Supposing you had a-single truck owned

by an individual owner who drove it himself and he leased it,
say, to Transamerican in this case.

Now, if there were no

regulationwould not Transamerican in many States to® able to
obtain indemnity against him just under common law if he were
negligent?
MR. LERITZ:
In the same way.

Yes, sir, they could, ©gainst him.

But in this case Transamerican could obtain

indemnity against the driver Hardrick.

But. you see, they are

20
not attempting to obtain indemnity from fch© driver Hardrick
but from Brada Miller who is Hardrick8a general employer.
There is a difference there.

The driver is always subject to

indemnify his principal, whether he be Brada Miller or
Transamerican, the driving, being the ultimately responsible
parson is always the person who theoretically', at least, must
pay.

And in the situation you gave, the driver, being the

owner of the truck, must pay.
The question in this case is must Brada Miller, being
the general employer of the driver of the truck, pay?

And I

think that's a different issue, your Honor.
Now, under common law principles of respondeat
superior — 1 am going to refer fch® Court, and 1 have, to
two Missouri cases, one of which Mr, Voorhses was involved in,
that’s in my brief, Branneker v. Transamerican, 428 S.W. 2d
524, and Barsh Truck line v. Jerry Llpps, 424 S.W.2d 81.
And I think it's the general law throughout the country and
always has been.
The courts generally hold that under the common law
principles of respondeat superior for a person to become a
special employer three things are necessary.

First, the

employe® must consent to enter into the special employment;
second, he must as a matter of fact enter into the special
employment and go forward with fch© employment:; and ±.ird, fch©
special employer must have fch® right to control his actions.

21
If those three conditions are met* then the driver comas into
the special employ of* in this case* Transamerican, and
Trans ame r i a an would then be liable to the general public for
any negligence of the driver.
Now* were those three conditions met?
obviously were*

I think they

Hardrick her® did agree to enter into the

special employ; he did* as a matter of fact* enter into the
special employ by driving the truck* and Tr&nsmaerican did
have the control* in fact as well as under th© regulations.
Now, if that’s th© common law

That much and no more.
I think it had more control* as I hop©

more control.
QUESTION:
MR. LERITZ:
QUESTION;
about common law.

Mr, Leritz ~
Yes* sir* Mr. Justice Powell.
I'm not following entirely your argument

If til® common law applied* you are not

suggesting that your indemnity agreement would be invalid, are
you?
MR. LERITZ:

If the common law applied., there would

22
be — may I say if the common law applied absent an indemnity
agreement,, there would b® no right of indemnity from Transanierican against Brad® Miller,
QUESTION;

That's absent, such an agreement, but

her© you have an agreement,
MR, LERITZ:
QUESTION?

All right.

Absent —

You are not attacking feh© validity of

the agreement absent the ICC regulation, are you?
MR, LERITZ%

Under feh® law of many States, sir, an

indemnity agreement will not ba given any credence unless it
agrees to indemnify the indemnitee against his own negligence.
Nows in the State of Missouri that8s the law.
In soma other States, I think in the State, of Illinois, that's
the law.

In other words, I cannot agree to indemnify you

against your own negligence unless 1 specifically in the
indemnity agreement stat© I will do so.
t

So I would say that the indemnity agreement in this
case wilder the common law is certainly in question.

And I

think all indemnity agreements of this kind under the common
law are in question, whether this particular one —
QUESTIONS

In which State?

MR. LERITZ;

Well, in any State, Mr. Justice

In Missouri, for example, I think

it would be questioned.
QUESTION;

MR. LERITZ:

The reason I say that, if I may, is

that, we are locking to the question as to whether or not this

Is it against the regulations of the ICC?

It's in conformity to those regulations, is it not?

Oh, I see.

MR. LERITSs
QUESTION;

May I explain why I think that?
Let me ask you on® question about the

remark you made just a moment ago.

You said we are looking

to the question of whether this agreement is against public
policy in general»

that it was contrary to the ICC regulation,

lies .
Now,, the regulations come along and. reinforce that.
They don't take anything away from the common law, they
reinforce the common law.
$

They make it clear that under a

situation such as this -the possession, control, and use of the
equipment is in the lass®©.

That's what the regulation says,

control of the equipment.
QUESTIONS

Does the ICC share your view of this

matter?
.MR. LERITZs
QUESTIONS

Tha ICC does not, air.
Isn't that quit© important?

You have

consumed half of your fcixa® now,counsel, and you perhaps should
address that directly.
MR. LERITZs

I believe that 'th® ICG's position is

based on a false premise, Mr. Chief Justice.

And th© false

premise is that th© control of th© equipment and of the driver
remains in the lessor.

I think that’s th© false premise.

Now, tha ICC has stated, and I quote

I paraphrases

Th© objective of safe operation might b® frustrated if the
indemnity clausa also required -th© lessor to indemnify th©
lessee for the lessee's negligence.

In other words, the ICC,

if i understand that statement correctly, takes th© position
that if the lessor is called upon to indemnify the lessee for
the lessee's own negligence, than th© indemnity agreement does
tend to frustrat© the purpose of the regulations.

So I think

25
it's very important for us to determine whose negligence is
involved here,

Is the negligence of Hardrick the negligence

of the lessor or the negligence of the lessee?

If the

negligence of Hardrick is the negligence of the lessee, then
if I read the ICCs brief correctly, then the ICC would take
the position, well, there it should remain.

And it would not

be proper under the regulations and it would not follow that
the liability should be shifted from a negligent to a nonnegligent party,
Thar® ar© also some practical reasons, if I might
cite some, why these indemnity agreements might be contrary
to the regulations and might be against public policy»

As the

Court knows from reading the respondents' brief, there© is a
serious question as to whether or not the driver in this case
had the right, and authority to an tar into this contract,

I

know that's not a question for this Court and I know this Courtwill not decide that.

But. it brings up an important point.

Her®'you have a, situation where a driver comes up
to the doorway of a trucking company with a truck and solicits
a load and takas a load.

The lessee describes the cargo, tells

him, decides what kind of cargo is to be carried, whether a
dangerous cargo or other cargo? how it's to be loaded, where
it's to h© taken., the rout© by which it's to be taken.

The

lessee describes and gives instructions, any special instruetions, with regard to the trip itself.

The leasee gives the

26
driver expanse money»
records.

The lease® checks th® driver's medical

The lessee makes an inspection of the truck itself.

In the event of an accident, ‘the driver reports to the less©©
and the lessee in turn reports to the Interstate Commerce
Commission,
1 think all of these taken together show a great
deal of practical control of th© lessor over the trip and the
driver and th© equipment itself,
QUESTION:
MB., LERITZs

Th© lessee.
Th® lessee.

I’m sorry,

Th© lessee.

yes, sir„
A great deal of practical control,

And th© law puts

that control there, th© common law puts that control there,
and the regulations put that- control there.
QUESTION:

Th© only thing the lessee does not control

is the negligence of th® driver.
MR. LERITZs
QUESTION:

That's correct, sir,
That's the only thing that is involved

in this damage suit,
MR. LERITZs

That's correct.

on® can control that, I suppose.

If a driver is going to b©

negligent, he is going to be negligent.
elsewhere.

But, of course, no

-So wa have to look

Where does the law place? the responsibility?

do the practicalities place the responsibility?
regulations place the responsibility?

Where

Where do th©

In this particular case Brada Miller did not know of this
accident for 4 months.
impeded.

Its investigation of the accident was

The accident was not reported by the lessor for

about 4 months, reported to the ICC for about 4 months.

It's

respondents' position that if a lessee knows or thinks that
it's going to be reimbursed or indemnified for an accident,
it doesn't have the incentive to do what it must do and to
make a prompt investigation and attempt to make a prompt
settlement.
I think a rule such as this — I'm sorry.

I think

an indemnity agreement which shifts liability will band to have
an inhibiting effect on investigation and on settlement of
claims,
QUESTION;

If you axe talking about practicalities,

Mr. Leritz, as you are, is Transamerican generally insured
against this sort of thing?

Is Brada Miller insured against

this sort of thing?
MR. LERJETZ:

Brada Miller is insured above a point,

Mr. Justice Rahnquist, that does not involve the amount of
money her®.

There is a financial 'responsibility arrangement.
QUESTION-

So it’s a self-insurer,

for purposes

of this•
MR. LERITZs

That is my understanding, sir.

Y@s.

I should — I would like to close with the following

28

comments %

Thas© indemnity agreements at best are questionable.

They at best —■ at worst they actually take the responsibility
from where the law places it and the regulations place it and
the practicalities place it and shift it to where it does .not
belong.

They take it — the position the respondent takes,

the indemnity agreement takes the ultimate financial
responsibility from the less©©, who has control under the
common law, under the regulations, and under the practicalities,
and puts it in tha lessor, who dees not have those responsi­
bilities and control.
Now, it s©eras to m© that that is contrary to the
intent of the regulations despite the position of the Interstat®
Commerce Commission and contrary to good practice, to good
practice in th® trucking industry.

Why not leave the

ultimate responsibility where th© law places it?

If, for

example, the negligence is the negligence of the lessee, through
tha driver, leave th© ultimate responsibility with th® lessee.
If the negligence is th© negligence of the less©© through some
other act of th® lessee, then leave the responsibility, the
ultimate responsibility, with th© lessor.
If, on th® other hand, the lassor is negligent, th®
lassor is responsible and the lessee would have a cause of
action over without an indemnity agreement, allow tha law, not
the artificial indemnity agreement, to place the ultimate
responsibility where it belongs.

1 think under those

-

29
circumstances the law would bast be served, it would cut down

on litigation, of which there is considerable amount in this
area, and unless the Court does take such a position, these
cases are going to continue to be litigated because 'the only
thing, as I understand it, the only question before this Court
is whether or .not thes© kinds of agreements are contrary fco
public policy because of the regulations*
If the Court says, no, they are not and w© will
allow then, then we will continue to have litigation under the
law of the various States under the provisions of fcha various
contracts*
I respectfully submit on behalf of respondents that
tha Court hold that indemnity agreements which tend to shift
liability from that party who was ultimately responsible under
the law to some party who was not responsible under the law
should be condemned*

Then I think, your Honors, that the

regulations will be complied with, the common law will be
followed, and the litigation will be terminatea.
Thank you very much*
QUESTIONs

Mr* Leritz, does this indemnity agreement

on its face purport to shift liability in the manner you have
described?
MR* LERITZ:
QUESTION:

Mot on its face, your Honor*
Well, how else can we view it unless we

get into the facts of the case and undertake to assess whether

30
or not the driver himself was the cau.se of this accident?
MR. LERITZ;
face for this reasons

Mr. Justice Powell, it does on its
It says that -the lessor will indemnify

the lessee for the lessor's negligence.
QUESTIONS

Only for the lassor's negligence, not the

negligence of lessor's agents or employees.
MR. LERITZ;

Right.

But also in another part of the

agreement, it states that the lessor —- that the driver is not
an agent of -the lessee but rather remains an agent of the lessor,
which is contrary to fact, to common law, and to the regulations.
The provisions of the leas® in this case which, attempt to
bolster the indemnity agreement by stating that the driver
remains the agent of the lessor and is not the agent of the
lessee is contrary to fact; and law.

There are many provisions

of this agreement which attempt to bolster the indemnity
agreement, and in doing 30 they cite statements — or cite
facts, I should say, or attempt to cite facts which are contrary
to the true facts.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very wall.

Do you have anything further, counsel?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALPECNSO H. VOORHBES
ON BEHALF OF TEE PETITIONER
MR. VOORHEES;
the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I have on© or two quick comments.
First, as I mentioned earlier, the question here* is

31
the issue# the narrow issue is what has the Commission don©?
And I believe that most of Mr, Leritz5 argument was directed
to what should they do»
Since I don’t believe that is the question# 1
hesitate to gat into it.

However# I net® in one of the footnotes

in the briefs of the Interstate Commerce Commission and the
United States — well# as a matter of.fact, in a part of their
brief including a footnote, they refer to probably what they
would do and the beneficial aspects of indemnity agreements
in general if they should aver reach the point of regulating
these indemnity agreements,,
In this footnote they refer to a 1973 University of
Chicago Law Review article which tricss to assess or appraise
tha economic approach to accidents and to the roaster-servant
relationship and to tha independent contractor relationship,
And the gist of the article is that the person writing that
article reaches the conclusion that liability should ultimately
be with the person who has the most control over the ultimate
prevention of tha accident.

He advocates in this article the

use of indemnity agreements to allocate that 1.lability.

He

says in his view there shouldn’t be any distinction between
independent contractor and master-servant relationships, that
it would he ideal if both parties were at common law liable
and then they could adjust their differences between 'themselves
bindings' of indemnity agreement and thereby put the blame on

32
the person who theoretically would be!in the best position to
prevent accidents„

And as we have shown here, Brads. Miller

is the company that would have the control over determining
or analysing latent defects to their equipment that Transamerican
may not be able to find by inspection»

Also, Brada, the lessor,

*

is the company that has th© ultimate employer-employee control
over -their driver.

They have the means of weeding out drivers

with bad driving history.
or discharging

They have the means of discipline

and the best means of providing sale drivers.

So as 1 say, ©von though that is not til® question
in this ease, when we consider various authorities on what
should b® done, this particular authority cited in the amici
curiae brief does endorse and advocate the approach of use of
indemnity agreements.
I think that concludes the petitioner's argument.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank, you, gentleman.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 10;55 a.ra., the argument in the
above-entitled cas© was concluded.]
