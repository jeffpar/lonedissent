MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

v. Usery.
Governor Rampton.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GOVERNOR CALVIN L. HAMPTON
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. PJlMPTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I am participating in the reargument of this case
today even though I did not participate in the first argument,
not in the hope that I can add any legal expertise to our
chief counsel, Mr. Rhyne, but because my fellow governors of
the 50 states desired that I express their deep concern to
this Court in regard to the Fair Labor Standards Act amendments
of 1974, concern not only for the immediate effect it will
have on the operation of state and local government but also
on the fact we feel this is another step forward toward wiping
out state sovereignty and perhaps an irretrievable step.
In this case there appears to be a great deal of
argument of fact based upon no evidence because of course
there was no evidence presented below.

And yet there have

been assertions made by brief on both sides as to the affect
of the act.

The Solicitor General asserts that as a basis for

the need for Congress to extend the provisions of the Fair

4
Labor Act to state and local government, that there were some
95,000 employees in the United States in state and local
government that were being paid less than the minimum wage By the same token, I would say I doubt very much that that is
so,

I have done a survey in my own state, and there are not.
Also the appellants have made certain allegations

regarding the cost of the application of these rules to
state and local government.

Here again I doubt, if we were in

a trial court, that the evidence

would stand out.

But this much I think must be true, and it appears
to me that the Solicitor General is sort of in a dilemma
here.

On the one hand he alleges that there is a great-

problem to cure, the 95,000 people that are below the minimum
wage, and, on the other hand, that it is not going to put a
burden on state and local government to cure it because
whatever the problem is, it is a problem that has got to be
cured by money.

And the cost of the cure is going to be

commensurate with the size of the problem.

If it is a big

problem, as he attempts to assert, as indeed he must if he is
to prevail here, if there is a big problem, then the money
required from state and local government to meet it is indeed
going to put a burden on the budget of those units of
government.
Most of the states provide for overtime for their
employees up to a certain level, generally above a given

5
salary level or a given salary classification? the pay scale
will provide for compensatory time off.

However, in my

opinion, it would not be difficult in regard to a portion of
state government to change to comply with these rules to pay
the time and a half or overtime because you could then do,
as many governors have said, "All right, we will do this, but
from now on there will be no overtime,"
However, in regard to a certain classification of
employees, iiose engaged in public sa£ety, there is no way
that you can conform to an eight-hour day or a 40-hour week.
And if they are to perform the functions which it is their
duty to perform, even though the act and the regulations
under the act make some modification to the requirements to
firemen and policeman, they cannot and should not be met.
Congress has not attempted to bring the armed
services--that is, the military personnel-—except for
civilian employees, under the provisions of these acts, and
yet there is not a fire department, a police department, or a
highway patrol in this country that does not have to operate
fairly well under military rule and where, if there is an
emergency, in the 40-hour week or the 57-hour week rings the
bell on you, they cannot q\r>it and go home from the job.
So, it is not within the power of state government
to comply in full and avoid the impact of these new orders.
The 40--hour week will, in my opinion, bear much more heavily

6

on cities and counties than it will on state government.

But

all of the governors feel a responsibility to the subsidiary
units of government within their states because they are
creatures of the state legislature.

The legislature has

got to give them the power and authority to render the service
that they are charged with rendering.

And so as governor, I

feel equally responsible for units of local government and
their budget and their ability to render the services they do
for the state government itself.
In most states and in most larger cities the super­
vision of employee relationship is under a merit system
council.

By this provision, these amendments, the merit

system council for state and local government would be first.
The Department of Labor.

And secondly, Mr. Chief Justice, as

you ware mentioning this morning, the 425 federal courts in
this country.

Already these courts are overloaded and new

judges are necessary, and here is an act which would throw
a new burden on them, a much greater burden than was thrown

on them by Wirtz, because in the case of wirtz the cities and
counties and states were able to adjust reasonably well so
that most of the cases that have gone into federal courts,,
pursuant to the Wirtz case, were violations that occurred
while Wirtz was pending.

But in this case, under the 1974

amendments, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, because it
extends so much further and because you cannot conceivably

7
comply because of emergency situations, th© amount of
litigation will be truly great.

The local merit system

councils have been able through their acquaintanceship with
local problems to keep labor disturbances within the states
and cities and counties to a minimum.

And there is no

danger here, contrary to what the Congress found, that strikes
which might be prevented by payment of the minimum wage are
going to place a burden on interstate commerce.
However, the greatest fear

I

believe that I and my

colleagues have in regard to these 1974 amendments-Q

Do you happen to know, Governor, do most of the

states laws prohibiting strikes by public employees?
MR. RAMPTON %
Many are silent on them.

There are very few that permit them.
Some have them.

I could get a

schedule of that and file it as a lato brief.
Q

No, I just wondered if you happened to

personally know.
MR. HAMPTON:

But in those states which do not

specifically permit strikes by public employees, the
governors have taken the same position that was taken in 1924
by Governor Coolidge of Massachusetts, that you cannot
strike against the public welfare.
We believe that this case takes us a great deal
further than Wirt3 does.

While I do not agree with Wirtz,

feel it is clearly distinguishable from this case.

In

the

I

8
Wirtz case you can bass the jurisdiction solely on the
competition theory because the activities of government which
were there covered by the early amendments all can conceivably
be said to be in direct competition with firms in interstate
commerce»

Not so under the '74 amendments»
You can uphold the '74 amendments and say that the

activities there covered are under thea Interstate Commerce
Act only by the application of

the enterprise theory.

I know

you did discuss the enterprise theory in Wlrtz and cite that
as one basis of the holding in Wirfca, but it is not necessary
to the holding in Wirt£ and that could be changed without
overturning Wirtz.

But if the enterprise theory actually is

to apply to states and local government and go to its logical
conclusion, then! think you have destroyed the sovereignty
of states.
Q

Is your position that just as a matter of

commerce power, the federal government cannot reach these
activities of the states, or is it that—of course this was
in the commerce power but the commerce power is limited by
some other considerations.
MR. RAMPTON:

The commerce power is limited.

It is

my position, Mr. Justice White, that the attempt to apply the
enterprise theory fco local and state governments—-it has always
applied of course to private concerns "--but to attempt to apply
it to local and stata governments which would then bring under

9
the commerce clause every single act that local and state
government might make would effectively wipe out the
sovereignty of the states»
Q

That is a little bit different point in the

sense that there are some limitations that considerations of
federalism put on the reach of the commerce power.
MR. RAMPTON:

Yes, certainly.

I would say that is

true.
Q

Rather than if some private industry was

performing--let us assume that the states decided to term out
its police job and have some independent contractors perform,
it.

Would you suggest that the commerce power would not

reach it?
MR. RAMPTON:
do that, Mr. Justice.

1 would suggest that no stata would
1 think the difference, to uss the

words of Chief Justice Burger, when we argued this the last
time, the things reached by Wirtz are activities that a state
may or may not do.

I guess it is another way of saying that

there are things that they do in a proprietary capacity.

The

things that are now reached under the 1974 amendments are things
that they must do if they are going to continue as a statey
if they are going to continue to exercise the state police
power.

And, therefore, not only in terms of the people covered

but in terms of the principle, a giant step beyond Wirtz, and
from that step I can see no logical stopping point.

10
Right now there is pending before the Congress bills
that would extend all provisions of the National Labor Relations
Act to states, including the requirement for negotiation,
the requirement that locally elected officials submit to
binding arbitration in giving employees the .right to strike,
and those bills are held up there only because of the pendency
of this case,
Again I repeat that I and my fellow governors are
concerned not only with the immediate effects of the 1974
amendments but with the fact that it strikes down the last bar
that prevents the intrusion of Congress on the powers of the
states„
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Governor.

Mr. Rhyne.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES S. RHYNE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. RHYNE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In this case I will argue that the 1974 amendments
to the Fair Labor Standard Act, as they apply,to states and
cities and counties—which they do encompass all of their
employees, with minor' exceptions---are unconstitutional

on

two bases.
Number one, I am going to argue that the nexus to
commerce is so insubstantial not to warrant the validity of

11
-this act under the coronerce power.

But, Mr. Justice White, I

would certainly and with great vigor urge that this Court's
decision in United States v. Fry, which 1 do not think touched
this case at all, held that in any case where a federal
statute impairs the ability of a state or city or county to
function in a sovereign capacity, it comes up against
constitutional federalism and is invalid.
First of all, let me address—
Q

Mr. Rhyne, some time during your argument will

you address yoursel5: to the question of whether the states
are necessarily in the same position as the counties and the
cities here because, as 1 see it, there are two lines of
authorityj a county or a city acting is state action for

purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, but a county is not. a
state for purposes of the

Eleventh Amendment.

So, 1 can

conceive of there being some distinction made, even if your
argument were accepted.
MR. RHYNE:

Your Honor, I would like to answer the

question right now in this way.

Of course cities- and

counties are creatures of the state.
powers from the state.

They take all of their

And it is true that one county may

perform 50 functions for its cities and one city like Chicago
may perform 5,000 functions because of their size, and that the
state may perform a thousand different functions for the
overall of the citizens.

So, with respect to the Eleventh

12
Amendment, it would be my contention that in the context of
this act that the states and the cities and the counties are
one.
Q

If you are relying on the Eleventh Amendment,

I think the lav/ is rather clearly against you because Justice
Marshall's opinion in Moore v. Alameda County just two or three
years ago reaffirmed the old holding of this Court that a
county was not a state for purposes of the Eleventh
Amendment.
MR. RHYNE:

I say I am not addressing myself to the

Eleventh Amendment in the context of that particular action
that was addressed there.

I am talking about governmental

functions that the county performs for the state which I think
are on an entirely different basis from the functions that
were involved there.
But addressing myself to the nexus to commarce, let
us look at what the Congress thought was the nexus to
commerce.

First of all, they said there was this famous

95,000 state, local and city employees who received a sub­
standard wage.

From the time I have been in this litigation

until now I have tried to find that 95,000, and I am still
trying to find them, and I say that even if they exist, where
and who are they employed by, what county, what city, what
state?

They all deny that they have anyone who is paid less

than the minimum wage,

But 95,000 out of 11,400,000 is a

13
mighty small number,

And so I say it is insignificant in the

overall of the picture.

So that the substandard wage argument

is no nexus to commerce as far as I am concerned.
Q

Where did that 95,000 figure originate,

Mr. Rhyne?
MR. RHYNE:

It originated evidently in some study

done by the Labor Deportment where they made some kind of
survey of the nation, and they put out this series every month.
The latest one, for example, is very interesting in connection
with this case.

For example, it shows that there are only

56 million people, for example, covered by the Fair Labor
Standards Act, as compared to Fry.
I

And when I come to Fry,

will address myself to that because there are 94 million

people, 94 million workers, and there are fifty-six of those
covered by this act.

When I mean covered, that means just a

record like they have on Governor Rampton, not a regulation
like they have on firemen.
But returning to my argument, which I think is very
important, that there is not substantial evidence here of a
nexus to commerce sufficient on which to find a rational
relation upon which to base this act.
The second, beside substandard wages, is labor
stirfe.

Let us look at labor strife.

They cite it.

not say where it is in the Solicitor General's brief.

They do
So, again

14
publication? the latest in 1973 says that three stoppages by
public school teachers caused one-half of the 2.3 million days
of government idleness in 1973.

In 1973 employees of

educational institutions or institutions for teachers end
support personnel were on strike more frequently than any other
category of government employees.
Contrast that--contrast that with the very careful
approach of Mr. Justice Harlan in the Wirta case where he
specifically—-specifically-linked strikes and work stoppages
involving employees of schools and hospitals , the things that
were covered there.

You sa®, here the big problem is you

cover everybody, everybody, but here Mr. Justice Ilarlan was
quite careful, and I am reading from 392 US 195, and he says,
"Strikes and work stoppages involving employees of schools and
hospitals, events which unfortunately are not infrequent,
obviously interrupt and
state lines.

burden the flow of goods across

It is therefore clear that a rational basis

exists for congressional prescribing minimum wage law."
I say there is no finding here that there was a
strike by any one of these 95,000 ghosts that impeded or
burdened interstate commerce in any way.

You are talking

about school teachers, and they are exempt.
So, the appellee goes then to purchases, and there
he is talking about the minimal effect up to now.

He says all

this does not have any effect on states and cities, one percent

15
or less, something like that.

lie balloons up and takes all

the purchases for all of government, $134 billion, and he says
that affects interstate commerce.

But he does not show in

any way, as you have found in these other cases—-and as
Mr. Justice Harlan found in Wirtz—that some of these 95,000
people who were paid too little were striking and burdening
those purchases in any way in interstate commerce.

So, I say

the evidence before Congress was non-existent, non-existent.
And then he goes to unfair competition.
he have for evidence?

What does

He has two ads in the New York Times.

In one, New York asks for business to come there because they
have low taxes.

In the other one, Massachusetts asks business

to come there because they have low taxes.

And from that he

draws the conclusion that because they have low taxes, they
pay subminimal wages.

Well, baloney.

I use such a word in

this august body, but it is the truth.
So, unfair competition, the idea of a state
engaging in unfair competition—new, you did have unfair
competition in Wirtz, and it was so found by Mr. Justice
Harlan,

But then the next thing he does is talk about

spreading employment.
said, nine months.

This Court does not sit, as one of you

You realize what is going on in the world.

If there is anything that is going on in the world, it is
that people in the public sector are losing their jobs by
the thousands every day.

And so here where you increase the

16
pay of a few, you cause a loss of jobs of many, and that is
✓

exactly what this act dees.

And he referred to less welfare.

I cannot in my wildest imagination leap that up in any way.
So, I come to the conclusion, may it please the. Court, that
the act is bottomed on a false bottom in so far as its nexus
to commerce is concerned.

And I therefore urge that the act

be held unconstitutional on that ground alone.
Q

Are you familiar with the Perez case, Mr. Rhyne?

MR. RHYME:
Q

Your Honor?

In 402 US, case of Perez.

field of the law.

It is not in your

In that case the Court upheld the

constitutional validity, under the commerce clause, of a
federal law that made local loan sharking a federal criminal
offense.
MR. RHYNE:
Q

Yes.

And in which in the course of its opinion the

Court dealt with the general power of Congress under the
commerce clause.

Are you familiar with that?

MR. RHYNE:

Yes, Your Honor, I am familiar with that

case; and, Your Honor, they had a lot more evidence there—
I mean, almost none.

But here it is so insubstantial.

When

you look at the entire nation—1 say this, I drew this from
Perez and I drew from United States v. Bass, I think written
by Mr. Justice Marshall, the idea that in each case you have
required the people before you who assert that the interstate

17
commerce power exists to show how,

And here, when you

encompass the whole of the United States of America, the whole
of government-—not only state and local government but all
federal government—you cannot come to grips with it,

And 1

say they have not shown any nexus to commerce such as has
been required by this

Court over and over again.

Let me go to Fry because I think Fry disposes of
this case.

1 think that in Fry when this Court said, number

one, Wirta had a small effect or intrusion on government and
Fry had even less, and then in the footnote you resurrected
from the dead the Tenth Amendment and said that if the
functions of states and cities are impaired or their policies
are interfered with so as to impair them, that that would

violate constitutional federalism.
Look at what we have here.

Eighty-fiva percent of

the budget of every city in this nation is personnel. Seventyfive percent of the budget of every state is personnel.

What

you are doing in this legislation is imposing down upon an
existing civil service that is obviously and 1 think clearly is
satisfying an awful lot of people because there was a trial
below, and the testimony in that trial was that there were long
lines of people who wanted to get police jobs and long lines
of people who wanted to get firemen's jobs because of the
fringe benefits that go with them.

These are among the most

desirable of all jobs, so was the testimony there.

And states

10
and cities do pay very, very high, they think, wages»

And

I call attention to the fact that a man who earns $13,000 in
Havre, Montana is a pretty high paid guy and that his $13,000
is worth about ninety here.
Q

Mr. Rhyne, is it your position that there are

no state employees that are actually engaged in commerce?
MR. RHYNE:
Q

No, sir, that is not my position.

what about those employees?

MR. RHYNE:

My position is that if there are, they

should pick them out specifically and legislate as they did
in Wirfcz.
Q

You would not concede that there would be any

problem about that with respect to the constitutionality of
a

law like that?
MR. RHYNE:

No, I would not.

After reading

Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s dissent in Fry, in which he approved
California--United States v. California--I would say there is
no problem.

The big problem here, Mr. Justice White, is

everybody is covered, the local judge and his clerk.

And the

one point that has been made most to me, I would say---and I
have had a lot of advice---is that—
Q

You just got some more.

MR. RHYNE:

Yes, I did.

And it is this, it is

this—and this is a good point, Mr. Justice* White, and I got
it from a good source—

19
And I am going to hear it right now.

Q

MR. RHYNE:

You are going to hear it right now.

It

is this, that the action of a city or a county or a state
in fixing their budget, which is their highest policy thing,
is an intrastate act.

It is an atrastate act.

And so you

have to show all of this nexus to commerce in order to cover
that act.

And here Congress in its findings has totally

failed to do that.
Q

Could you suggest to me some test that would

be satisfactory to you to sort out the employees of a state
that the Fair Labor Standards Act may properly reach and those
that it may not reach?
MR. RHYNE:

I would say that what you are doing.,

Mr. Justice White—to me who represents only states and cities
and counties, as yon well know--is asking me to tell some of
my clients what is going to happen to some of their people.
But I will do it.
Q

I am just trying to find out how far your

position goes.
MR. RHYNE:
Q

All right.

Would you adopt Governor Hampton's dichotomy

of proprietary as distinguished from purely sovereign
governmental functions?
MR. RHYNE:

Your Honor, I would, except I

would say,

having lived my whole life in trying to define proprietary

20
and governmental, 1 have some difficulty with it.

But I would

say the railroad-—if they run a railroad in interstate
commerce, Mr. Justice White, would you accept that as an
illustration of employees that—
Q

I knot/ there is any amount of illustrations,

but I do not want to pursue it.

I thought maybe you had

some formulation in mind that—
MR. RHYNE:

It is very, vert/ difficult, but I could

certainly say to you that a policeman, when he gives you a
ticket or a fireman when he puts out a fire-™
9

Q

But whatever that formulation was, would Wirfcz

fall within it or without it?
MR. RHYNE:

I would say that Wirt2 would fall

I think that one of the things that I would say to

within it.

you about Wirfcz is that since I argued the case here the
first time, I went back and read every word of the record,
every word.

And one of the things that impressed me there

was that the employees there of hospitals and schools,
according to that record, were the lowest paid employees
the whole United States of America.

in

These cafeteria people

were getting 85 cents an hour, for example.
Q

Do you think in those situations the Fair

Labor Standards Act application should be accepted in terms
of strictly on a constitutional basis?
MR. RHYNE:

I think they should be picked out

21
specially and you should not do it on a meat ax approach.

And

I think what they have done here is the meat ax approach.

Q

You would not quaxrel with the state power

company, would you?

State power company-—you would not have

any trouble with that, would you?
MR. RHYNE:

State power company, no, X would not

have much trouble with that at all.
Q

How about a state lottery?

MR. RHYNE :

That falls in the category of the

railroads.
Q

State lottery.

MR. RHYNE:
Q

State lottery--Your Honor—

I always give you the easy ones, you know that.

MR. RHYNE:

The attorney general of Maryland is

back here somewhere laughing.

He ought to answer that better

than. I.
My point is that when you take the

whole of

government, you are talking about--Mr. Justice White, I know
because you people have just forced me to go through it,
that the City of Richmond renders 161 separate services and
they are broken down into over a thousand.
Q

Are you saying these amendments are invalid on

their face or they are in part valid and in part invalid?
MR. RHYNE:

I am saying that they are so broad that

they are invalid on their face completely.

And if they want to

22

get at a specific piece of commerce that a city or a state
is doing, let them adopt a special law for your power
company.
Q

This whole doctrine of the overbreadth in the

commerce clause area, is there such as there is in the First
Amendment?
MR. RHYNE:
Q

Well—

Or you could say it just is not severable.

You could say in terms of severability the statute just is
not severable.
MR. RHYNE:

I find it very difficult,Mr. Justice

act and that act, which it says is commerce and should be
regulated because it is in competition with commerce, let
them point it out as they did in Wirts, as they did in Wirfcz,
and as Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out.

hnd one of the things

that he did point out too, in that famous footnote 27, was
that never would he stand for a trivial—a trivial—impact
on interstate commerce as a basis for regulation of interstate
commerce.
Q

Mr. Rhyne, may I a.sk you two questions.

Supposing that the whole matter went back to Congress‘and
Congress held some hearings arid found that there were some
police strikes, there really were 95,000 people who were
underpaid according to their standard,, and then they reenacted

the statute.

Would v/e have a different constitutional issue

■than we have today?
MR. RHYNE:

I think you would have a different

constitutional factual situation with respect to who are the
95,000, what were they doing.

Were they doing, as the Chief

Justice points out, a governmental function?

Or were

they

engaged in commerce, in competition?
Q
people.

I was supposing they

police and fire

Supposing there are 95,000 policemen and they have

engaged in strikes and so forth, would that be a.different
constitutional question than we have?
MR. RHYNE:

I think that any time that you are

24
dealing with policemen. Your Honor, you

are dealing with one

of the two most fundamental services that government renders,
and I do not think there that the federal government has any
business interfering.
Q

So, then in final analysis you are really not

relying on the absence of evidence before Congress but rather
on the fact that this is an area which Congress may

not

legislate in.
MR. RHYNE:

I ara really relying on both, Mr. Justice

Stevens, as I said at the outset.

X wanted to point out to you

that there v;as no evidence and, secondly, that I was relying
on constitutional federalism which, in ray judgment, invalidates
this act on its face.

Q

Even if there were a factual basis.

The second

question--I did not quite understand, and I am not sure if
you finished your* development of the point--what is your
real distinction of the Fry case?
MR. RHYNE s

In the Fry case you had an emergency and

a compelling national interest, and it covered the whole of
the nation.
Q

But the Court did rely on the commerce power

rather than—
MR. RHYNE:
Q

That is right.

And X think there there was a primary national

concern that would override, under the balancing act that this

25
Court should do, the state interest in trying to pay higher
wages that would interfere with a national policy that held
to be effected because of the emergency,,

Here you have

neither the emergency or the compelling national interest»
If anything, you have a compelling national interest the
other way to uphold the elements of federalism because it is
those elements of federalism that have made this nation what
it is today.
Two weeks ago I was up in Philadelphia, and
persuaded, a friendly policeman to allow me into the

I
old city

hall where Chisholm v, Georgia and other great cases were
argued.

And I watched a film about the cases and about all

the long tin© that you gave people in those days to argue
their cases in the formative days of our country.

And I went

over to Independence Hall, and I again, with the Federalist in
my hand, thought a lot about the beginnings of this country.
And I must say if there is any one thing that is important,
it is that diversity that federalism has allowed.
1 refer to the fact you have got 50 states and
every one of them does most things different.
Q

Mr. Rhyne, getting back to modern times, would

you not say that Fry did not help either side?
MR. RHYNEt
Q

Getting back to Fry?

Yes.

MR. RHYNE:

And I say it did not help either side.

26

It did not touch either one.
Q

That is what I thought.

MR. RHYNE:

That would be my interpretation of it.

But I would say it helped me in my argument because it
resurrected the Tenth Amendment and recognized the principle
of federalism.

And so I would have to say it did help our

side.
Excuse me,. Mr. Justice White.
Q

Let me ask about Fry.

Is there a distinction

between that case and this one in that there the Congress
said to the states, "You must not," whereas her® they are
saying to the states, "You must"?
MR. RHYNE:

Is that a valid distinction?

That is a distinction.

There have been

a good many cases where you have got them coming to you now
under the Environmental Protection Act.

There are a good

many cases where this Court has held that the federal govern™
ment cannot fore® states to spend money to carry out a federal
purpose.

So, I think that is a distinction which I had not

mentioned.
Q

Is it a valid one?

MR. RHYNEs
what they are doing.

I think it is.

I think it is.

Look at

They are altering states and counties

and cities to alter their budgets to pay overtime.

Let me

just illustrate what, this is all about in a way by talking
for just a moment about California.

I am represnting them

27
also, and they one© pointed out to you and I do point out to
you that their firefighting costs
from $64 million to $94 million»

under this act will go up
This is caused not because

they treat their employees badly but that they treat them well»
And they also point out that it takes two years for them to
train anybody; if they are going to cut down on the overtime
of the existing people, it is going to take them two yeaxs
and cost them $27 million»

They in California of course

spend more money on fire fighting as e state than any other
state.

And this is an enormous changeover»
But the big changeover is this»

Up until now most

firemen and policemen paid on a bimonthly or monthly basis or
a yearly basis.

Under this regulation put out by the Secretary

of Labor, everything in on a 28-<3ay basis.
knows.

Why?

Heaven only

And they have got all kinds of regulations; if a man

is interrupted in the middle of his 30-minute lunch period,
you have got to give him so much more time.
and called out, you have got to keep all

If he is sleeping

kinds of records.

Just the record keeping alone in connection with firemen is
going to be an enormous thing and shows the kind of minute
intrusion that goes on here.
the record—and

And thosa regulations which are in

a particular provision that I call your

attention to is on page 600 because it shocks me every time I
read it.

It says that the director of the wag® and hour

division is going to fix the work week, and he is going to fix

28

the work conditions.

H© is going to fix everything with

respect to police and fire.
I just do not think that the police and fire
departments, which have done pretty well up to now, ought to
b® run from Washington.

And if they are run from Washington,

and this act is put into effect, you are going to get—as we
point out her©—overwhelmingly less service at a higher cost,
and it is going to mean that every home owner in this nation
will have to pay higher fire rates because the fire rates
depend on the amount of fire service you have.
The ramifications of this thing are enormous, and
Congress did not consider those any more than this thing that
was referred to about the courts, and I will finish with that.
Q

There is nothing new, Mr. Rhyne, about

Congress enacting legislation without understanding all of its
consequences, but that does not bring a constitutional
question, does it?
MR. RHYME:

I would just still, Your Honor, in

agreeing with you, say one thing about Section 16(b), class
actions.

Under this act, you have a right to bring an action

on behalf of all those similarly situated.

And then you get

costs and you get attorneys’ fees, you get liquidated
damages—if it is liquidated damages and you are entitled to
time and a half which Is of course triple time—and you get
the help ©f the Labor Department in carrying out your

29
litigation.
I was handed last night late a reply brief by them
in which they say this is not so.

Unfortunately for them,

the two cases they cite do not sustain—-they claim you do not
have class actions although it allows the filing of the suits
on behalf of all those similarly situated.

But because they

say it requires the consent of all the employees.

In one of

these decisions, a Fifth Circuit decision, that they cite where
f.

it says it is the opt in, opt out.

It is not a Rule 23 class

action, but it is still a class tiction.
Your Honor, is that

And my major point,

because of all the benefits that flow

from 16(b), all this litigation from now on is going to be in
the federal courts and not in the state courts, and as we.have
pointed out time and time again and as the city attorneys point
out in their briefs, there is no question but what one half
of all their litigation involves personnel matters.

So, talk

about, a flood of litigation, this would create it.
So, we urge, and we urge most strenuously, that
this act is invalid because they do not—Congress in its
findings does not show any real nexus to commerce and, above
all, that under constitutional federalism it is invalid under
the ru3.es laid out in Fry which, Mr. Justice Marshall, I think
does help us because I do think the Tenth Amendment now has
meaning and even beyond the Tenth Amendment because constitu­
tional federalism existed before the Tenth Amendment.

I insist

30

that when you have such a mammoth, massive takeover of state
and local government affairs as this act provides here--for
example, in their reply brief they say that we complained,
that they might come in and have inspections, that each
inspection only takes 16 hours.

Imagine how many inspections

New York City with their three hundred and something thousand
employees--on© inspection each or one for the whole city?
Your Honor, I urge again this act has not been thought through.
The regulations that have been promulgated,, they fit cities
like a square peg in & round hole.
they are invalid.

They are unreasonable,

They were issued six days, as Your Honor

will recall, before Christmas and could not be even read by
cities or received by them much less considered.
So, we urge that this act be held invalid for the
two reasons that I have urged.
Q

And I will reserve my time.

Mr. Rhyne, I take it that not only would you

think that there might be some activities of states and cities
that were within the reach of the commerce power and some that
are not but you would also think that in terms of whether an
exercise of the commerce power might impair the functions of
the states, there might be some exercises of power under the
Fair Labor Standards Act that might threaten the local govern­
ment and some that might not.
MR. RHYNE:

That is true.

But. here you

have the

meat ax approach? so, you do not know what they are talking

31
about»

You would have to fight them out one by one in the

courts.
Q

Do you think Maryland v. Wirt2; is within the—

MR. RHYNE:

I would say on Maryland v. Wirtz, on the

evidence there, of the substandard wages and the competition
with private business, it is within the area that Congress
can reach.

Before when I was here, I asked you to set

Maryland v. Wirtr aside and I think that while it does cause
some confusion in the overall field, because of those two
facts, I would change that statement.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Solicitor General.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SOLICITOR GENERAL ROBERT H. BORK
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. BORK:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
I am going to discuss a case which initially at
least will not seam to bear very much resemblance to the case
Mr. Rhyne just discussed because my version of what that act
doss is considerably different from appellants'.

The central

issue here of course is the effect of the '74 amendments to
the Fair Labor Standards Act upon federalism.
Mr. Rhyne has described a massive and disastrous
impact upon cities and states.

I think I can state and show

that there would be vexy little impact, certainly no impact
that threatens the value of federalism.

32

The issue between us can be stated as whether or
not--and I think it can be stated that the popularity of
Maryland v. Wirts with the appellants varies from time to
time, but I still think the issue is whether or not Maryland
v» Wirts should be overruled and the dissent there become the
new law.

And I will suggest in the course of my argument

that such a decision overturning Maryland v. Wirtz would do
much more than that.

It would undercut the rationale of

almost all of the major commerce clause decisions of this
Court, including decisions in the field of agricultural
statutes, labor law, civil rights lax*', and so forth.
Q

It might depend ©n what ground it was over­

ruled on.
MR. BORK:

It might, Mr. Justice White, but I am

going to suggest that there are not adequate grounds for
overruling it except a rationale that would indeed have that
kind of constitutional counterrevolution.
The government’s position rests upon three proposi­
tions.

And I would like, as to the first one, to put aside

the question of federalism for a moment and just deal with the
jurisdiction or the power, the coverage, of the commerce
clause.

And I think as to the coverage of the commerce

clause, as fc© its application here, I would think that that
much—not the federalism issue but that much—would have been
settled certainly decisively by Fry v. United States and

33
certainly by a lot of cases before then.
My brother Rhyne would suggest that no consideration
was given to this.

Indeed, Congress debated—both the Senate

and the House debated, and the reports

included discussions

of the facts of interstate commerce involved here arid the
theories by which the commerce clause applied,

I do not want

to spend much time on this, but I feel I must spend some time
on it because it has been attacked so strongly today.
There is no doubt that interstate commerce is in
play when we have state and local governments which in 1971
purchased $135 billion worth of goods and services, and that
was 12 percent of our gross national product.

Nor, I think,

can there be any doubt of the significance of this statute
to that commerce when it is realized that this amendment
extends the statute to 3.4 million employees, not just minimum
wage or overtime provisions? it also has age discrimination
provisions and so forth.

And that makes with the 1966

amendments upheld in Maryland v. Wirtz, a total of 6.3 million
employees who are covered by the statute.
There are a variety of reasons why extending a wages
and hour law to these -amployees is rationally related to
commerce.

Congress made the findings in our main brief at

pages 23 and 24, the Senate report discussion of this is set
out.

Of course, it is not up to the government here to prove

again the factual findings that Congress made.

And the

34
standard of review for Congress's factual findings of that
nature of course is

set forth forth in the heart of Atlanta

Motel and Kataenbach v. McClung, and I think they easily
withstand that kind of review,
The theories upon which Congress attached this law
were, first, that substandard working conditions are likely
to lead to labor disputes and hence the strikes that interrupt
the flow of goods and services in interstate commerce.
was in ths original finds of the 1938 act,

That

The theory was

adopted to support the 1966 amendments in Maryland v. Hirta.
It was advanced in debate here for the 1974 amendments.

And

this labor strife theory of course was accepted by this Court
as long ago as Labor Board v„ Jones & Laughlin in upholding
the National Labor Relations Act.
It should be said that Maryland v. Wirte covered
mostly custodial workers, orderlies end nurses aides, and it is
har-d to think that any of the employees covered by the 1974
amendments have a more tenuous nexus to interstate commerce
than those employees that were dealt with in Maryland v. Wlrtz.
Second, I mentioned that competition between govern­
ments tends to or can spread substandard working conditions
as governmental units compete with lower taxes and lower
wage rates to make up for that.
a rational relationship.

I do not think again there is

Congress can act on that ground.

I

■am not obliged to have held a trial and prove that Congress's

35
factual findings were correct.
Thirdly, the increase of purchasing power through
higher wages and the spread of work tends to stimulate inter­
state commerce.

That is a theory of course very much Like

th© theory in which the 1964 Civil Rights Act was upheld in
Katzenbach v. McClimg where it was pointed out that eefusal of
certain restaurants to serve blacks led to smaller food
purchases which adversely affects interstate commerce.

So that

too is an established constitutional motive applying the
commerce clause.
And, finally, it is quite clear, as the Senate
report states, that raising the minimum wage rate at a level
which will at least help to assure the worker an income at or
above the poverty level is essential to the reduction of the
welfare rolls and the overall reform of the welfare system in
the United States.

And certainly taking people off welfare

rolls and giving them p.roductive jobs is a means of affecting
interstate commerce.
Q

How do you gat someone off of the welfare rolls

if he is a fireman or a policeman and you pay him overtime?
Are firemen and police-men on the welfare rolls?
MR. BORK:

The firemen and policemen may not be on

the welfare rolls, but there are people on the welfare rolls,
I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, because the kind of wage they can
get in certain kinds of jobs is so low that it leaves them well

36
below the poverty level.
Q

I hear what you ai'e saying, but- 1 do not

understand it.
MR. BORK:

There are people, i suppose, who will not

take jobs that are of very substandard wage who would take it
if the price was raised.
Q

You mean they would stay on welfare.

MR. BORK:

There may be such people, and there may

be people who find that they cannot support themselves on
these wages.
Q

But that they can on welfare?

MR. BORK:
Q

In some cases yes, I think.

Unless we had some hard evidence on that, I

think it so defies reality that I for one could hardly make
any judgment based on that kind of sweeping statement.
MR. BORK:

Let me try this, Mr. Chief Justice.

One

of the purposes of the overtime provisions of course, as
Congress specifically stated in this Senate report I referred
to, is to spread work, to get some employers for some rinds of
jobs not to pay overtime but instead to hire an additional
worker at straight time.
welfare roll.

So, that would take people off the

That of course was one of the theories of the

original Fair Labor Standards Act. upheld in the Darby case
and it is a theory that has carried over to the 1974 amendments.
Q

I think that you are advancing that argument

37
only for the purpose of sustaining the power of Congress, not
as an argument of persuasion to us.
MR. BORK:

No, no, I do not think this Court has

to be persuaded that this act was wise social policy or was
unwise social policy.

I am merely, as you say, Mr. Chief

Justice, raising that as showing the jurisdiction of Congress
in this area before coming to the federalism point.
even come to that.

I have not

I etn just talking about the straight-

forward application of tha commerce clause as it would be
applied in any case except for the claim that you cannot do
it when a state or local-government is involved.
Q

Is that affirmatively recited in the legislative

history?
MR. BORK:
recited.

I

believe

it is.

Yes, it is affirmatively

In our brief at page 24, the main brief, the Senate

report talks about raising the minimum wage level to assure
workers an income above the poverty level and reduce; the
welfare rolls.

Of course the purpose of spreading work by

encouraging the hiring of additional workers at straight time
is in the legislative history extensively.
But I would have thought that on the pure
question of whether this was rationally related to inter­
state commerce, that there was no question but for Mr. Rhyne's
s tateme nt s tod ay.
Coming to the other issue, which I think is the

38

crucial issue as to whether this statute impinges on the
value of federalism, I take it we know at the outset of
course that there is no immunity of state or local government
from federal regulation as cases like the Sanitary District
case and the California case attest.

But I want to make two

arguments-—one conceptual—about the nature of this statute
and on© factual about the actual impact of the statute.
The conceptual argument is this.

The 1974

amendments seam to me by their nature less intrusive;, less
coercive, less damaging to state sovereignty, local
sovereignty, and so leas threatening to the value of
federalism than most of the statutes which this Court has
upheld under the commerce clause in the past and has done so
regularly for decades.
Q

Are you talking about cases like Jones &

haughlin?
MR. BORK:
Q

Yes, I am, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

Do you not recognize any distinction between

the federal government exercising commerce authority over a
private business and thereby displacing the state's legislative
authority to exercise its jurisdiction over that business and
the federal government's exercising commerce power over the
state itself?
MR. BORK:

No, I do not think I do, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist unless the commerce power or any other power was

39
used in a way that struck at the state's ability to be a
policy making government and a policy implementing center.
But I cannot for the life of me see any distinction between
telling a state that your social policy is henceforth super­
seded and void and a federal policy which we impose takes
the field.

That seems to me much more intrusive upon

federalism, upon local sovereignty, than saying you must pay
a minimum wage which we pay and which private employers pay.
Q

And yet there is no doubt in the decisions of

this Court that the commerce power can go just about all the
way down the road so :5'ar as preempting state authority overprivate business.

And yet the Court in its footnote in Fry

last year-"~and your argument concedes—that there is a limit
apparently a good df*al short of there when you the federal
government is dealing with the state as a state.
MR. BORK :

I never meant to put the concession or

affirmation, as I recall it, about federalism on that ground.
I think there is a limit to how much state law the Congress
can oust, and I hope there certainly will be a limit because
I think it would be mt aningless to woary about federalism if
it turned out that the only thing states

could do was tax

and pay employees who were not a. 1 lowed to do anything because
the federal government had taken over all the policies.
Q

Is there any doubt from our decisions? in cases

like Perez, that the federal government pretty well can take

40
over ail the policies

so far as regulation of private

individuals is concerned?
MR. BORK:

1 thought I had detected in this ease,

Mr,, Justice Rehnquist, and in the dissent in Wirts and in
the dissent in Fry the beginning of a concern about federalism
and an attempt to find a judicial formulation that would
preserve it against all kinds of attacks of a kind that I have
not seen in cases since the 1930s, and I think this formula—
I think that is a desirable attempt to find a formulation
that controls federal power short of a point where state and
local sovereignty is destroyed, both in the field where you
are affecting a state’s budget and in the field where you are
ousting the state’s laws-

I do not see any distinction

between those,
Q

Do you think Congress would have authority to

require all the states to enact a merit system roughly
comparable to federal civil service standards?
MR. BORK:
Justice.

I do not know that they would, Mr. Chief

I have not. really thought about that. This act does

not do it.
Q

We are talking about fundamental power though,

and I am trying to test that out through the hypothetical
question.

How about the power to have a federal act that

would regulate all the employes relations of the states and
municipal and local governments, that is, a—quote—Taft-Hartley

41
for public employees?
MR. BORK:
do not know.

That might be within federal power.

I

I hesitate to try to guess about all the cases

because I am going to suggest that this case is quite easily
solved, much more easily solved, than any of the other kinds
of statutes such as the one you have mentioned, and 1 was
trying to suggest why this is a much less intrusive statute
than the kind o£ statute you just mentioned.

And I think it

is possible, of course, to think of all kinds of federal
incursions into state power that one would say federalism has
effectively gone.

But my point here is that these are always

matters of degree and no principle is being put forward today
which would justify the overwhelming of the states.

Q

Mr. Solicitor General, we are talking today about

a case that involves the regulation by the federal government
of wages

and certain conditions of employment of state and

localities, so we do not have to go quite as far afield as you
suggested a moment ago to answer the question I am now going to
put to you.

In Fry we dealt not with putting a floor under
0

wages but with putting a ceiling not only on wages but on all
salaries of state and local governments.

In your supplemental

brief, you say trie principle of Fry controls this case.

Let

us suppose that the Congress at this session were to enact a
statutet-I recognise the political unpopularity of it, but we
are dealing in principle, not politics, I hope, at the moment—

42
assuming the power to regulate the ceiling? in other words,
enacting controls on what the states could pay their people at
all levels.

What would you say about that?

MR. EORKs

If I understand correctly, Mr. Justice

Powell, I think there would certainly be a serious problem
about applying such a ceiling permanently--on other than an
emergency basis—-permanently to elected officials and top
policy makers because that might affect th© quality of people
you could get for those jobs,,
A ceiling generally on the kinds of workers who are
covered hare—-that is, essentially ministerial tasks—-1 think
that is the other side of this case, whi.ch is why I think the
Fry_ rationale basically supports us here.

Q

Right.

MR. BORK:

And I think the question then becomes

one of degree of impact.

It is quit© possible to imagine a

world in which state and local government were so unable to
maintain themselves that even a statute like this which puts
a lower burden on the states and local governments than the
federal government places upon itself and a lower burden upon
them than is placed upon private employers.

It is possible to

imagine a universe in which still that would be too much for
the state and local governments to shoulder.

But that is not

the factual situation that we face here.
Q

No, but as a matter of principle, did I

43
understand you to say that if this case is decided in favor
©f the government, there 'would be no principled way to avoid
holding that 'the government also could impose ceilings on
salaries and wages—
MR. BGRK:

On any kinds of employees unless the

ceiling were low enough so that it could be shown that it
actually hindered the states and localities from carrying out
their policies.

That is my point, that this is always a

matter of degree, and one cannot find, except-—I must suggest
one line of principle.

One cannot find by the nature of this

kind of law a bright line distinction that will never be
availabe.
Let me put it this way, the dissent in Mary land
v. Wirtz thought that a principle had been adopted by which the
federal government, if it wished, could overwhelm the state
budget, the state fiscal policy and virtually draw up the
•*»

state budget.

I think what I am saying to you is that I do

not believe that such a principle was adopted there.
If such a principle were adopted there, 1 would
suppose that the case was wrongly decided.

I do not think it

was o
Q

Are we not moving substantially beyond Wirtz

in this case; and if you bear in mind what you just said
about Fry, as Justice Cardoso said, that principle is
commencing to run a bit wild, is it not?

44
MR. BORK:

2 do not think it is.

1 confess

-hat the

emotional impact of my brother Rhyne’s brief and argument
really rests upon a statement of things as facts which, I am
sorry to say, are not facts.
and read it, 1 was terrified.

When 1 got his brief last week
1 thought I was defending a

monstrosity of a statute because it turned out that we were
going to bankrupt the cities, drive the police forces from the
streets, send the firefighters in California home just as the
forests erupted into a blase, destroy the volunteer concept
and with it civic virtue.

This thing apparently has about

the social policy attractiveness of a nuclear holocaust.

am concerned, in any of my friend

Charlie Rhyne’s arguments about the dreadful, results to

I am thinking about the long-time doctrine of

federalism that seems to me to be on the verge of being

45
destroyed.by vesting in the federal government the power to
put floors under and ceilings over the wages of federal and
state employees.
Let me ask you this, to move to a slightly
different area.

The Governor of Utah put some cases that I

think illustrate the problem.

Does the Congress have the

power, if you prevail in this case, to say to the states
that they have no authority to outlaw strikes against the
government by employees?
MR. BORK%

I do not think that necessarily

at all from this case, Mr. Justice Powell.

follows

Let me suggest

this case presents a particular type of statute, and if you
were asking, What could i do with this type of statute to
protect federalism, 1 think the answer would be quite simple.
This case lends itself to an easy rule, and that is a no­
discrimination rule.

It would be appropriate for this Court

I think to hold in the right case that the federal goiyernment
may not impose costs and burdens upon the states and local
governments significantly greater than it, bears itself.

Here

the costs end burdens f in terms of minimum wage, imposed upon
the state and local governments are less than the federal
government imposes upon itself because the federal government
employees are subject to this act or to Title V, whichever,
provision by provision, is more favorable to the employee.
So that I think if it were always held that there could be no

46
discrimination against the states by the federal government,
‘that would be a perfectly adequate protection for the states»
Q

So, if the government concluded that it would

allow strikes against yet at the federal level, it also couldMR. BORKs

No, no, I am sorry, Mr., Justice Powell»

I was trying to say that when you are dealing with pay levels,
that type of statute in which obviously federalism could be
destroyed by a minimum wage which said $30 per hour for state
employees or it could be

destroyed by a statute which said,

"You may pay no state employee more than $4,000 a year'7-obviously those things would destroy statutes»

But if you use

a no-discrimination rule, the federal government, without
destroying itself, can never destroy federalism.
Q

That was the position Justice Frankfurter took

in New York v. United States, and I think a majority of the
Court felt that something more was required than just laying
down a no-discrimination rule in order to protect the states.
MR. BORK:

1 think the taxing field is somewhat

different than this field, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and 1 think
it is different for a variety of reasons.

But I fail to see

in this context why a no-discrimination rule would not be a
complete answer to th® fears about federalism.
When you get. to a case like the 1964 Civil Rights
Act, the labor law and the other cases, obviously a nodiscrimination rule is not going to work as well to protect

47
federalism.

But here it would work perfectly.

Q

Why does it work here and not say in the case

where you make the states subject to the Taft-Hartley Act?
MR. BORK:

For this reason, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

If the federal government said, "We will subject the states
to all the laws of the United States and thereby oust the
states completely from any policy enforcement or policy making
function," I suppose there would be no discrimination, but
there would also be no state sovereignty.
Her® if you say the states must pay a minimum wage
of the same size that the federal government pays—-in fact,
here it is less because of this Title V comparison--or, to
take Mr. Justice Powell's case, the limitation upon stats
salaries

must

ha no

greater

than the limitation upon federal

salaries, that kind of test I think would adequately protect
federalism,
Q

But that precise same argument could be used

to say, "Now we come to the question of collective bargaining
and so forth."

And why not say it is all right just as long

as Congress does not discriminate

if it is treating the

states no differently than it does a private employer?

How could

you distinguish that esse from this under this principle?
FIR. BORK:

I think I can.

I think we are dealing

with fundamentally different types of statutes.

The

collective bargaining case is a case—or the other cases we

48
have been talking about are cases in which you subject the
states to your rule policy, what the law should be.
Q

But Mr. Rhyne suggests, rightly or wrongly—I

do not know—that what is a higher policy making function of
the state than determining its budgetary priorities and
determining who is going to get how much in the way of wages.
MR. BORK:

2 think the budget in some sense follows

from the choice about the various policies you want to carry
out and the various programs you want to carry out rather than
the other way around.

And it seems to me, for another reason,

that this kind of statute is less intrusive.
Suppose a state has 500 policies it carries out
through its programs, the approach of the standard commerce
clause case, when the Agricultural Adjustment Act or the Labor
Relations Act is being considered, is to com® along and say to
the states, "Two of your policies'

have just been completely

wiped out, and our policy is aoing to take over."
The approach of this statute is to say, "It is going
to cost you somewhat more"--and I have been trying to get to
the point that it is not going to cost very much more at all-"It it; going to cost you somewhat more to run. your 500 policies.
You may raise taxes and run them all as you wish.

You may cut

back some of them slightly, cut back all of them slightly, or
drop two completely.

The choice is yours."

That is a much

less intrusive kind of statute than a statute that says,

49
"Remember that law you just passed»

It no longer exists.

Our law has taken over."
Q

But you are being required here to give up

absolutely one policy, and that is your policy of paying these
%

particular workers a particular amount set by the state.
MR. BORK;

It is quite true„ Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

that you are required to give up the policy of paying a
worker less than $2.20 per hour.

I cannot believe that is as

much of a threat to federalism as policies go as a statement
that in labor relations your policy is ousted and ours takes
over.
Q

You may feel the state's choice of policy is

unwise, but it is every bit as nrach the state's choice there as
it was th@ state's presumably before wickard v. Filburn to
allow unlimited production of wheat.

Maybe that is not a wise

choice but it is nonetheless the state's choice.
MR. BORK:

Eat that is my point, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, and that is that this case is like those cases,
and

to strike this case you would have to have a constitutional
/

counterrevolution that I think would take you back to Schechter
and—
Q

At least I take it it is your position that

if you lose this case, whether, we say so or not, the Wirfcz
case is really dead or it really should be dead.
MR. BORK:

I think so.

50
Q

And in all fairness to the law, you, would

suggest if you lose this case we overrule Wirtz?
MR. BORK:

In all fairness to the law.

I hesitate

to think of the number of cases I think you ought to call
overruled if I lose this case.
Q

But at least Wirtz.

MR. BORK;

But I do not want to suggest

that the

scorched earth all around these federal statutes—
Q

Let me come

back to one of your responses

a moment ago, Mr. Solicitor General.

You said you could not,

if I understood you correctly, you could not believe that

a $2.20 an hour—I think that was the figure—minimum wage is
going to hurt anybody very seriously? is that about what you
said?
MR. BORK;
Q

That is correct.

Suppose Congress raises it to $3, $4, $5, so

that in Duke, Iowa and Cheyenne, Wyoming and every other area
this new minimum prevails even though costs of living vary
substantially from New York City, Washington, to Cheyenne,
Wyoming and Billings, Montana and so forth.

What is to

prevent Congress--is there some constitutional bar to prevent
Congress from raising the minimum wage to $5 an hour next
week?
MR. BORK:

No.

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, part of

my answer and I think the major part of my answer is the no-

51
discrimination rule because that shows nobody is attacking
federalism.
The answer which I made partially was—■
Q

Five dollars across the board would not

discriminate by definition.
.

»

MR. BORKs
Q

Oh, no, that is quite right.

But is there any constitutional barrier to

Congress next or tomorrow making $5 the minimum wage all over
the United States and then to apply all of your arguments
that you have made here today?
MR.. BORK:

I think there is no constitutional

barrier unless after the statute had gone into sffect--and this
one has not, and we are dealing here with the grossest kind
of speculation

as to what

this is going to do—-after the

statute had gon® into effect and it turned out that even though
there was no discrimination and the federal government was
bearing those costs too, that there were states and localities
which simply could not function as effective sovereigns with
that kind of wage rate, then I think you would have a different,
kind of lawsuit.

That is why I said before

I could imagine

a universe--! do not think we are in it, but I could imagine
a universe—in which even though there was no discrimination,
and even though there are not the political safeguards to
federalism that do exist--after all, those appellants have
an enormous amount of influence with Congress--

52
Q

It is certainly not evident in this case.

MR. BORK:

I think it is, Mr. Justice Stewart,

because they managed to get their figures by overlooking the
exemptions in the statute that Congress put in at their
request, which, I must say, is a way of getting high figures.
Q

Mr. Solicitor General, on your no-discrimination

test, what about a statute that said no state may pay its
judges more than federal judges are pciid?
MR. BORK:
trouble with that.
Q

I think I would have a great deal of
One point—

There would be no discrimination there though.

It would meet your test.
MR. BORK:

No, no, one of the things I was saying

was that I would have more trouble as any regulation got
applied to policy-making officials or elected officials.
I

mean, I would have trouble with any coverage there, but I

am talking now about coverage of essentially labor—
Q

In Fry the elected off:* cials "were not. included

because under the Ohio statute they were not covered.

But

were they not covered by the federal regulation?
MR. BORK:

In Fry?

Q

Did not the 5-1/2 percent ceiling apply

Yes.

across the board?
MR. BORK:
recall.

Frankly I am sorry to say I do not

Mr. Justice Stewart says it did not.

53
Q

That is my recollection, that it did net,

MR. BORK:

Certainly this statute was very carefully

drafted to leave out anybody who was professional, anybody
who was supervisory, anybody who was policy making or elected.
And

I might, say mv brother Rhyne talked about the

local judge and his clerk; neither of them is covered by this
statute.
Q

May I ask, why would you have constitutional

difficulties with my brother Stevens' example of an act of
Congress limiting the salary of all state judges to the
maximum pay of federal judges?
MR. BORK:

When I say difficulty, Mr. Justice Stewart,

I mean difficulty, not that it was unconstitutional..
Q

Why would you have it?

MR. BORK:

Because it seems to me that you are then

affecting the quality of people or the type of peonle that a
state may attract to its highest offices.
Q

What under the Constitution prevents Congress

from affecting that quality?
MI:. BORIC:

If there is anything under the Constitu­

tion, it is that value of federalism we are discussing.
Q

What about the commerce clause?

You thought

that there were some limits somewhere that would reetch the
commerce clause a while ago.
MR. BORK:

That is true.

54
Q

I would suppose you would think the judges

might be outside its reach.
MR. BORK:
Q

I beg your pardon?

I woulc: think you might think that judges were

outside its reach.
MR. BORK:

I might think that,, but I think that a

large part of my reason for thinking so would be the federalism
counte rweight.
Q

If you apply the Perez analysis, vou can define

a class of employees that would include judges.
MR. BORK:

You can if you stick to the commerce

clause in its usual rational relation test and do not bring
into play the couaterweight of federalism, which I am
explicitly willing to do and indeed think should be done.

And

I am arguing that in this case when that counterweight is
fully considered-3

If you acknowledge the judges example presents

you with difficulties, it seems to me you are also acknowledging
that your non-discrimination test is an inadequate test.
MR. BORK:

I am sorry.

For this kind of case, the

statute we are facing today, it is a totally adequate test
because this statute very carefully does not reach—
Q

Shall we use different tests in different

cases?
MR. BORK:

As circumstances change, Mr. Justice

55

Stevens, .1 think you would have to.

For example, if you

begin to see federal statutes proliferating into every field
so that the divorce law is taken over and the commercial code
is taken over and so forth, I suppose at some place this Court
would have to frame a test to call a halt some place.
Q

Of course, these things always happen

eventually, do they net?
area.

No one has a coup d"etat in this

They take it over piece by piece and bit by bit,

and that is what 1 thought some of this case was about.
MR. BORK;

I was trying to suggest, Mr. Chief

Justice, that this case, by its nature, lends itself to control
more easily than other kinds of cases and by its nature is —
Q

Control by whom?

MR. BORK:

The judiciary.

upon state sovereignty than the

And also is less intrusive

other kinds of statutes that

this Court has held well within the commerce clause.

So that

my point is I quite agree there may come a time when a stopping
place has to be defined.

But to call this case the occasion

for drawing that line I think would be to draw a line at an
illogical place for the wrong reasons.
Q

In some of the colloquy, Mr. Solicitor General,

there was some discussion about elected judges, elected
officials.

There are some states where the judges are

appointed, and let us assume for the moment that half of the
states followed the hopeful trend among

many judges and had

56
something like the federal system—that is, if Congress did not
impose it on rhern first.
voluntarily.

Let us assume that they did it

Then would the appointed judges be exempt from

the reach of Congress and the elected judges would be subject—
MR. BORK:

Ho, Mr. Chief Justice, when we were

discussing judges, I did not intend to make a distinction
between elected and appointed judges.

It seems to me you are

dealing with high policy officials at that point, and I would
have grave trouble in allowing regulation of such officials.
Q

One of the very figures that you mentioned--!

think you had a figure of $135 billion, the total purchases
of all government except federal.
MR. BORK:
Q

Yes, in 1971.

And there seems to be some consensus that

somewhere, give or take, 80 percent of all that money is spent
for payroll.

Assume it is somewhere close to that.

rate, it is a great many billions of dollars.

At any

It would be

somewhere from $100 billion to $110 billion of the total
expenditures of all state and local government in the country
that would row come for certain purposes within the reach of
the control of Congress.
MR. BORK:
Justice.

Is that not so?

I have the figures on that, Mr. Chief

The 1974 amendments cover workers whose total wage

bill is $36.6 billion.

The Labor Department has worked this

out, and the Bureau of Census has provided statistics.

The

57
cost of the minimum wage to the 90,000 persons we think are
paid less than the minimum wage in our brief—the supplemental
brief, the most recent one—discloses how that figure was
arrived at.

The cost of the minimum wage would be to add

$33 million to the $36,6 billion or to add one-tenth of one
percent.

The maximum overtime cost would be to add $356

million and that is inflated because that is based on a 40-hour
week and, as our

brief explains, a 60-hour week without

overtime is allowed and all kinds of exemptions are allowed.
But basing on a 40-hour week and with no averaging, it would
come out to $366 million, which is one percent of the v/age
bill that it covers.

That is a total of $400 million all

together, which is a little different than the figure of well
over a billion that Mr. Rhyne derived on a basis we do not
know.
Q

Whose figures are these, Mr. Solicitor General?

MR. BQRK:
Q

These are the Labor Department figures.

And they are in by affidavit or how do we have

them before us?
MR. BOPJK:

They are in our latest brief.

It is in

typewritten reply to the supplemental brief.
Q
had it.

Yes, but before that—there I was aware that you

they are Labor Department figures; is that it?
MR. BORK:

Some of them were in reports to Congress,

58
and I forget precisely where that one was.
told where ifc was.

Maybe I can be

X do not remember whether that was in a

report to Congress or where it was.
Q

I suppose if we were to give them any weight,

we would have to take the risk that they might not be any more
reliable than some of the figures of the Social Security System
and a great many other things that are suddenly discovered to
be gravely wrong mathematically,, actuariallv.
MR. BORK:

These are Bureau of Census figures and

Bureau of Labor Statistics figux'es.

They are published.

They

may—I cannot say that there is no possibility of any error
in them, but it is possible to reconstruct the way they were
compiled and published.

And the other figures we have are

based upon Mr. Rhyne's correspondence with various local
officials, and there is no way to tell how those were compiled.
But

Congress's estimate was that this bill would cost less

than two parcent, perhaps over one percent, of the wage cost.
I would say these figures suggest that the total
cost would be 1.1 percent, which is not, I think, controlling5
85 percent of state or city's budget.
Q

I have been thinking about your suggestion that

perhaps federalism would be saved in part at least if the
federal government were not required to impose any different
limitations or different obligations on the states than it is
willing to impose on itself.

But does that not cut against the

59

basic tenet, one of them, of federalism that allows for
diversity and experimentation?
If you were a judge in Hew York or California where
the salaries are higher than for federal judges, if you were
told that you would be paid exactly like the federal judges
in Washington—or take the case of the

government of Utah,

which is a relatively rural state with wage levels there
presumably far lower than they are in

New York City or

Washington, D.C.--simply because somebody up here in Washington
imposes on you the same rules and regulations it is willing
to operate under in an entirely different environment does
not seem to be very helpful.
MR. BORK:

In the first place, of course, Mr. Justice

PoWtSll, the federal government employees do operate in the
same area so that they are imposing upon themselves a cost
for that area the 'same as they impose upon the state.
Q

But does the federal government have differen­

tials by region?
MR. BORK:
shotild.

Hot, I think, in this area.

Perhaps it

But I do not think that is a constitutional

requirement that it should.
Q

Do you really think federalism is promoted by

homogenizing the whole country in the way you suggest?
MR. BORK:

Now, Mr. Justice Powell, I trust I have

not suggested homogenizing the country.

60
Q

.It is a step toward that.

MR. BORK:

Of course, every exercise of the commerce

power is a step toward the obliteration of federalism.
Q

I understand that, but I come back to Justice

Rehnquisfc’s distinction.

This case arguably is different.

realize you have a different view, but I say arguably.

I

This

is the first major intrusion, starting with Wirtz, that I know
of in which the federal government is saying to the states and
localities, "We are going to run your labor policies and fix
your wages and salaries," and that is a major departure, as I
view it.
MR. BGRK:

That

entire part of my argument,

Mr. Justice Powell, was devoted to saying there is no

difference between this cese in its effect upon state
sovereignty than in Darby--United St.at-.es v. Darby—where they
told the state of Georgia that, for the first time Georgia had
a minimum wage, which it did not want, and that was ousting
state sovereignty.

I do not see the difference.

The suggestion is that the difference is that you
have touched the state; in some metaphysical way, you have
touched the state’s body in n way that you do not when you
merely take the laws that the state passes away from it.
Q

Arguably you have impaired the freedom of the

state to function, as you suggest; if these wages were set
at a limit that impaired its solvency, maybe you would have a

61
different, case»

But it would start down this road.

As a

principle, it is hard to see where one would stop.
MR. BORK:

Mr. Justice Powell, I think that has

certainly been true ever since the first exercise of the
commerce clause.

You have introduced a principle which

becomes a matter of degree.
Q

But did they not relate to private activity?

MR. BORK:

My point about that is that I think there

is no distinction between a statute that touches the state in
this way and a statute that touches the state by saying it may
not govern its citizens in the way that it has chosen to do so
in the past.

X recognize that in the Pry dissent, this kind

of point was being made? that cases like Darby and Jones &

Laughlin ere not really relevant because those were private
citizens who were making a claim which could only be a claim
that Congress lacked legislative power.
are relevant.

I think those cases

The suggestion there is that the state has a

different inherent objection based upon federalism.

I cannot

understand how that would come about.
For one thing, the Tenth Amendment reserves the
rights to the states and the people and makes no distinction
as to whether it is a person or a state that is raising the
federalism claim.
Q

Then if you cannot understand that, why—if X

may go back—do you have any doubt at all about the power of

62
Congress to limit the salaries of state judges?
MR. BORK:

Why do I have any doubt about it?

Because I think, Mr. Justice Stewart, that when you get to
limiting, controlling what the state does with respect to
what the state does

with respect to its governor, its

judges, its legislators, its policy making officials, its
cabinet officials, you are effectively limiting them in the
way they can get people and deal with peop3.e in making policy.
Here the federal government has gone nowhere near that area.
The statute stayed as far as possible

away from anybody who

could be called a stiper visor-—
Q

I know that as a matter of fact.

But we are

talking about a constitutional principle.
MR. BORK:

It seems to me that constitutional

principles change with circumstance, and it seems to me that,
when you are dealing with the governor of a state, with the
state supreme court, you are dealing with the state in its
most intimate—the center of its policy making apparatus.
Say you are paying that man who is shoveling snow 20 cents
more an hour; I do not think you have done the same thing at
all.
Q

Do you make the same argument for a minimum

salary for a state judge as for a maximum salary?
MR. BORK:

Mr. Justice Stevens f I do not think 1 can

elaborate all the distinctions I would want to. make if I were

63
faced with that kind of thing.

But as a general matter I

would be much more troubled by any federal regulation of what
you can do with respect to a state judge in paying him and
so forth.
Q

That is because the judge is such an important

part of the state government?
MR. BORK:
Q

I think it is because the judge—

Is he less important or less in the traditional

sense than the police force?
MR. BORK:

Yes.

I think when you are dealing with

a policy making individual, it is different.
Q

Because of

the policy factor.

But judges

did not make policy generally.

case.

But I was trying to prevent it in this

[Laughter]
Q

Touche.

Q

Mr. Solicitor General4 I have been thinking

also about just drawing

a

distinction between policy makers.

Let us assume for the aoment that we are talking about the
superintendent of education of a state.

And you would say, I

take it, that the federal government would not
have power
t
to regulate his salary but obviously would have power to
regulate, under the argument you advance, the salaries of

64
people whom he employs,
MR. BORK:
Q

The secretary’s salary.

I am going up to an intermediate level and see

what your position is.

Suppose he has, as state superintend­

ents necessarily do have, 20 or 30 quite key positions in the
organization, maybe 50 or 100, depending on the size of the
state.

Are they policy making people?
MR. BORK:
Q

They may well be.

How far does this go down the line?

MR. BORK:

Obviously, Mr. Justice Powell, we are

dealing with a complete and unbroken spectrum from somebody
who is emptying wastebaskets to somebody who has the power to
call out the National Guard and so forth--the governor—to
suppress insurrections.

And I do not know that i can--the

trouble with this whole field is we are dealing with a
complete spectrum of power in the commerce clause,

and I do

not think it is possible to specify with a bright line right
where the power breaks or right where the distinction breaks.
Q

Wherever anyone has what could fairly be

characterized as a policy position, however small it may be
in terms of impact on the state government, would be different
from-MR. BORK:

I think so.

I think so because then you

are getting close to the essence of sovereignty.
Q

You surpri.se rae, Mr. Solicitor General.

Do you

65
think of this as a matter of a place where the commerce
clause power stops or a place where, despite acknowledged
power under

the commerce clause, there is an impediment or

prohibition in the Constitution?
In other words—and I borrow this from my brother
Rehnquist's dissent in Fry—Congress has undoubted power under
the commerce clause, I would suppose, to limit the content
of what shall be published in interstate magazines, magazines
that go interstate.
commerce clause.

No question of its power under the

But also no question of its lack of power

to do that, not because of a limitation under the commerce
clause

but because of the prohibition of the First Amendment.

That is what you run into, is it not?

MR. BORIC:

I think what I am saying is that the

position in the Fry dissent seems to separate out the
commerce clause and something like a -personal privilege that
the state can assert.
Q

A prohibition or a limitation imposed from

elsewhere in the Constitution.
MR. BORK:

I had always thought that the Tenth

Amendment merely made explicit what the fact of the enumera­
tion of powers implied, and that federalism lived in the
interstices of the enumerated powers.

But I think there is

something more than that, and I do not think one has to use
the Tenth Amendment as a textual peg.

What there is more than

66
that is a document that contemplates this dual system of
governmenti and if the document contemplates that, then I
think, reasoning not from any particular textual passage but
reasoning from the structure, the Constitution in the pure
sense of the word, one, says if the federal government
undertakes to destroy a state government, the judiciary may
stop it.
Q

The Constitution stops it.

MR. BORK:

The judiciary does because of the warrant

given it by the Constitution.
Q

More simply, yes.

MR. EORK:
Constitution.

So, there is that counterweight in the

I have no problem with it.

I think in order

to make a distinction between this case and all the other
commerce clause cases, I really think one has to adopt the
Fry dissent.

And

I think if one does that, one has all kinds

of difficulty—*
Q

You yourself have some difficulties, it seems

to me, in answering Justice Stewart's earlier question where
you are talking about a maximum salary for judges and you say
Congress cannot impose that and presumably because of some
sort of principles of federalism.

Yet it is perfectly clear,

I 'would think, under Jones & Laugh 1 in, that Congress can impose
a maximum salary on any president of a business located within
its jurisdiction, and the reason for that is because there is

67

no federalism principle there or at least none that has ever
been enunciated by this Court.
MR. BGPK:

I find great difficulty there.

I would

like to address that, if I may, at a little length.,
Q

And also you mentioned the dissent in Fry.

There was also, you may remember, a dissent in Wirt2.
MR. BORK:
twice.

Yes.

I had attempted to discuss that one

But I think in order to distinguish Darby from this

case, which is the real question for us, that you would have
to have a constitutional innovation of really some dimensions
because one has to say that to touch state is forbidden and
a state can raise objections that an individual cannot in the
name of federalism, which is of course what the Fry dissent

suggests.
Q

You should have answered Mr. Justice Stewart

no, -that was not your approach at all because I thought he
was conceding everything about Darby, yet nevertheless there
is something like the First Amendment operating here, not
in Darby.
MR, BORK:

But I am suggesting it was operating in

Darby, Mr. Justice White.

The case came out as it did, but

I am suggesting that the federalism objection is validly
raised by an individual or an enterprise as much as by a
state.
Q

You could still accept the federalism

68
iraplicafcions of Darby and have a completely different view
of it here»
MR. BORK:

I do»

Oh, 1 am sorry.

I am sorry.

Q

Oh, I wish you would.

Q

Then why do you get the different result for

the setting of a maximum ceiling on a corporation executive
by Congress and the setting of a salary on judges if Darby
and Wirtz are the same?
MR. BORKs

Darby and Wirtss are the same only,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in the sense that federalism could be
considered in both cases, in each case, even though in one
case it was raised by a lumber manufacturer and in the other
case it is raised by a state.

But it depends upon what you

are applying the federal regulation to.

if you are applying it

to a set of individuals, a bank president, then you have-let
me put it this way.

I do not think the distinction between

whether the law operates upon the state, as this one does, or
upon the state6s citizens makes any difference.

And I would

suppose it does not because I would suppose, among other things,
that that would mean that the states could waive federalism,
that if only individuals came in here to this Court and said
Congress has exceeded its power and is taking away the policy
making functions of the state by replacing its legal code,
that this Court would have to say, ’’But you are not. the
state and therefore we do not consider federalism even though

69

federalism is destroyed»"

I do not believe that»

I do not

believe that federalism is an immunity personal to the state
which the state may waive if it does not choose fc© raise it.
Q

Then your assurances to the various members

of the Court that when we get to a really tough case of
impairment of state sovereignty in the sense of affecting the
state as a state will have a remedy, are really illusory
because you cannot tell me that the Perez line of reasoning
governs this type of case where you are talking about the
state, that there is any stopping placa»
MR. BORIC;

There is not»

I think if this Court becomes impressed

with the idea that in fact the states are being ousted as law
«

making and law enforcing bodies, that a stopping point will
have to be called.
Q

Even if it is done little by little, bit by

bit?
MR. BQRK:
Q

I would think so, Mr. Chief Justice.

What do you do, add it up cumulatively and say,

"Mo one of these would have been a serious invasion but taken
all together, they now amount to one"?
MR. BORK;

There may be various kinds of tests

that can be constructed.
Q

If the Court did not stop short of Perez, where

can it stop so far as commerce power goes?

And it is your

submission that that is all that is involved here, as I

70

understand it--that the same federalism interests are present
in a Perez type case as they are in this type case.

That is

your submission.
MR. BORK:

Yes, but the circumstances of that case

may not raise it.
Q

Has the Court in Perez passed any conceivable

stopping point as far as commerce power goes?
MR. BORK:

I trust not.

If it becomes apparent that

the commerce clause is in fact destroying the states as
entities with sovereign powers, I trust at that point—I do not
think the Perea case involved that—I trust at that point
you would call a stop.
Q

Where did a state enter into Perez?

MR. BORK:

2

do not think it does very much.

That is

why I think that federalism is not very heavily implicated
there.
Q

It was a question of whether the federal

government, the Congress, could regulate some hoodlums
engaged in loan sharking.

You have not got any sovereign state

and its powers involved there, have you?
MR. BORK:

You probably have state laws about the

subject.
Q

You mean whether the state had gone into that

field or not.
MR. BORK;

The state probably does have laws about

71
loan sharking and so forth.
Q
in passing.

You mentioned the Tenth Amendment twice but only
And at least I got the impression the second

time that you thought the Tenth Amendment really was not
necessary, that the enumerated powers took care of the same
proposition.

Does the Tenth Amendment have nothing to do

with this case?
MR. BORK:

Only I think in the sense that the Tenth

Amendment confirms the implication to be drawn from two ocher
things.

One is the implication to be drawn from the fact

that powers are enumerated and therefore in some sense limited.
And the other is the fact that the document, the Constitution,
specifies dual sets of governments and to that extent
specifies that there is a federalist value in the document
just as there would have been, 1 think, constitutional
protection for free political speech if there had never been
a First Amendment.
Q

You do not think the Tenth Amendment has any

function such as the First Amendment has on the commerce power
in Justice Stewart's hypothetical?
MR. BORK:

If it does, one could ssiy that the

federalist value is located in the Tenth Amendment, but I
think it is located elsewhere.

I think the Tenth Amendment

is just a truism as this Court said in Darby.

If it is

located in the Tenth Amendment, then it is certainly not true

72
that this case is different from Darby, because the Tenth
Amendment explicitly says the rights are reserved to the
states and to the people if not delegated to the Congress.
G

Assuming, Mr. Solicitor General, that there

may be soma who disagree with you that Darby and Wirfcz are
really the same or that the dissent in Fry takes a different
approach.

1 take it that you would think that using the

limitation approach on an exceeded power might be less
bothersome to you.

Let us assume that some of us thought

that we could either take it on the commerce ground or the
i'

so-called Tenth Amendment ground or the federalism, ground.

!■

Which would you suggest?
MR. BGRK;

I would suggest, if we are talking

doctrinally, conceptually, 1 would suggest that the federalism
ground is an independent weight which inheres in the structure
of government the Constitution establishes, and I think it is
mistaken to try to attach it to the Tenth Amendment as a peg
or the commerce clause as a peg.

It is a generalized

constitutional value.
Q

Would you prefer that approach to saying that

the commerce power of the United States just does not reach
this particular segment of state activity because it does not
have a nexus with it?
MR. BQRK:
approach.

As a professor of law, I would prefer that

As Solicitor General, I would find either approach

73
that reached that result extremely painful»

And, furthermore,

I think it will prove very hard to explain why this case is
more dangerous than Darby and all of those cases without
returning to something like the 1930s.
0

You do not think this case goes beyond Wirts?

MR. BORK:
Wirtz.

I do not think this case goes beyond

I do not think this case is very threatening to

federalism at all.

I think it is a very light impact upon

workers of really a menial status, and this Court has ample
means of using the federalism value to limit future statutes
that might begin to move towards judges or legislators or do
something terrible.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Solicitor

General.
Mr. Rhyne, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES S. RHYNE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
Q

Mr. Rhyne, before you start, I would like to

mention to you a thought that has been running through my mind
and give you a chance to comment on it.

Article IV provides

that the United States shall guarantee each state a republican
form of government, and the Court, as you know, has held that
questions under that section are political in character.
As I listened to the Solicitor General characterize your
argument about policy and the disastrous effect of this

74
statute on the states, it occurred to me that your clients are
in a peculiarly effective position to make rheir arguments
known to the Congress.

I wonder if you would comment on whether

or not this is the kind of problem that could best be addressed
by Congress.
MR. RHYNE:
in Congress.

Let me tell you exactly what happened

They did address their arguments to the

Congress, tind they were beaten by big labor.
of Agriculture

Two Secretaries

testified that this act was—opposed the act,

and one on the ground that it would so overburden small
government—really they should have said big government—-that,
it was unwise.
upheld.

Then there was a presidential veto, which was

And then without further hearings, big labor steam­

rollered this through the Congress again.

That is the

congressional record which cannot be challenged.

It is the

record of this particular legislation.
Q

Is there another answer to that question, if I

may suggest it, that that is the political remedy, but you
claim you have a constitutional barrier that prevents Congress
from doing what it has done?
MR. RHYNEs

That is right, Your Honor.

It always disturbs me when counsel on the other side
attacks figures.

I would like to call the attention of the

Court to one very important thing.

Last night, I say, I got

very late a brief from the Solicitor General in . .which he

75
comments a lot on a brief that we had filed, and the Urban
Data Service is relied upon throughout that brief.

It so

happens that the Urban Data Service, which I agree is the most
reliable, the most knowledgeable, the best of all sources of
interest in this country on government, is the one that in the
appendix to our brief made the estimate of $1 billion a year.
Q

One million?

MR. RHYNE:

One billion dollars per year.

what they are talking about.
city managers and
are not liars.

They know

They base this on rfjports from

those on the local level.

Those people

They report what the facts are.

And so I say

if the Solicitor General in his brief can rely on the Urban
Data Service, so can wa.

And that is exactly what we have

here.
Secondly, I would like to say there was some
question about
personnel.

whether 85 percent of the budgets are indeed

That is a fact that has appeared, it seemed like,

a thousand times in the media.

I find at the first argument on

page 38 that the Solicitor General himself said, as I understand
it, in municipalities the budget is 80 to 85 percent wages.
The whole business that is so bothersome here is
that the policy of a state, the policy of a city, the policy
of a county is .its budgets.

They are like telephone books.

It tells what they are going to do, who they are going to
serve, who they are going to hire, and what they are going to

76
pay them.

Arid what happens here is for that telephone book

we are going to have this telephone bookj the federal regula­
tions replace it.

And in addition to this telephone book;

which sets forth all the federal regulations under the Pair
Labor Standards Act, there is in addition the very minute
regulations as to police and fire that makes you report every
time—how long they eat, how long they sleep.

It is the most

intrusive, most absolute interference that one can imagine.
So, I would conclude that if we want in this 200th
year to have a unitary government, this is the way we will
get it.
I went to the trouble of calling the solicitor of the
City of London to ask him who fixed the wages of his people,
I would like to know? I wanted to know what Parliament had to
do with it.

Ke said in the overall, Parliament can do it.

"But underneath it, we do it all."
We have checked in Australia; we have checked in
Hew Zealand? we have checked in many other countries.

There

is no country in the world where the national government,
unless it is unitary, fixes the pay and the wages of every­
body the way it is proposed here.

And I think that this idea

of the federal regulations and the federal regulatory and the
federal courts—because you are going to be the final
arbiter of all of this--they point out in these regulations
that these are merely suggestive, that you go to court and get

77
everything, and you are going to have class actions and you
are going to have all these costs and attorneys* fees, and
you are going to have it in the federal courts because that
is the only place you can get it*
Q

Of course, that is Congress'3 perfect right to

confer a cause of action to go into federal courts if the
statute is valid.
MR. RHYNE:

Yes.

I am merely urging that this is

one of the intrusions into this whole thing that states and
cities and counties, as the county brief points out, that they
are not used to dealing with.

Why have duplicate regulation,

regulation on top of regulation?

That is what you have here.

And we have a complete system now, and when you dump all of the
federal regulation on top of it, it will simply make states*
and cities' fiscal integrity a question not only in some of
our larger cities but in our smaller cities as well.
on the borderline now.

They are

They cannot take the cost of this

legislation.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 3:00 p.m. the case was submitted.]
