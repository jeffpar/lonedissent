of Massachusetts,

Massachusetts Board of Retirement vs. Murgia

THE COURT:

We'll hear arguments next in the Massachusetts Board

of Retirement against Murgia.

Mr. O'Malley, you may proceed whenever

you are ready.
MR. O'MALLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

This is an appeal from the order of a three-judge district court
enjoining the enforce on a Massachusetts general law, chapter 32,
section 26, subsection 3.

That statute requires that members of the

uniform branch of the Massachusetts state police retire upon reaching
the age of 50, or upon serving 20 years, whichever occurs later.

The

action was initiated by the plaintiff, a member of the uniform branch,
shortly after he was notified by the board in May of 1972 that he would
be retired on his 50th birthday.

The complaint filed in the federal

district court essentially alleged that this statute denied his equal
protection under the law.

The district judge that originally heard the

case dismissed the case for failure to raise a substantia1 federal
question.

The district judge recognized the interest of the Commonwealth

in insuring a high level of physical capability of uniform officers of the
state police.

The court ruled that retirement at age 50 was at least a

rational if not the only means of achieving these purposes.

Plaintiff

appealed to the court of appeals, which court remanded for the convening
of a three-judge district court.
THE COURT:

Is this a class action?

MR. O'MALLEY:
THE COURT:

No, it is not, Your Honor.

The—I ask because the joint supplemental memorandum

2

that was filed here very recently on December 8 indicates that Mr. Murgia
has materially changed his employment--I'm reading--he is presently
employed as security manager in the Westminster, Massachusetts, plant of
Digital Equipment Incorporated.

He began this $17,000 per year job

supervising a 12-man security force in August of 1975.

Does that indicate

or imply that he no longer is interested in getting his job back on the
Massachusetts police force?
MR. O'MALLEY:

I have not been informed to that effect, Your Honor,

and I am informally informed that he would, if granted reinstatement, would
retake his position with the state police.

Therefore,I don't believe

the case is moved or affected by that.
THE COURT:

You are, at least your side of the case—this is a joint

submission, I understand—
MR. O'MALLEY:
THE COURT:

Yes, Your Honor, it wasn't a--

So I can feel free to ask you about it.

MR. O'MALLEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think that evidence concerning

his new job might relate to the question of what kind of effect retirement
has on whether he can get other employment or not.
THE COURT:

This shows that he can--

It doesn't imply that his case is moot in any way.

MR. O'MALLEY:

Certainly.

There is nothing in that joint supplemental

memorandum that the Commonwealth believes materially affects the case.
We just had the admonition of the court in mind, that if any new material
does come to light, that it be presented.

After the three-judge district

court took the evidence in documentary form, it issued an opinion declaring
the statute unconstitutional.

It stated it was irrational because, under

state police procedure, an officer over the age of 40 takes a medical

3

examinatiori annually.

The court ruled that these medical examinations

were available, and did not justify retirement at the age of 50.

The

court also noted that the board of retirement had not proved that a
critical area is reached at 50, which would justify disregarding these
examinations.

The issue brought to this Court is whether mandatory

retirement of members of the uniformed branch of the Massachusetts state
police contravenes the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendement.
Plaintiffs appear to concede that the retirement statutes are generally
constitutional, these irrational means of effectuating legitimate state
purposes.

These purposes are:

increasing the efficiency of the public

service, and providing financial security for retired employees.

There's

no reason to carve out an exception for the retirement statute of the state
police.

It is clearly rationally related to the effectualation of a

legitimate state interest.
THE COURT:

Isn't one of the purposes sometimes advanced for these

kinds of statutes to the desirability of avoiding having to make indivi­
dualized determinations, and tell Officer Smith that you have to retire
at 62 because you're not quite in as good shape as you used tf' be, but
Officer Jones, you can stay on for three or four more years:
MR. O'MALLEY:

Exactly, Your Honor.

We've stated in our briefs that

this is a demeaning and depressing task, and is also one taken in an area
of very great medical uncertainty.

It's highly questionable whether the

state can actually quantify the degree of diminishing productivity of an
individual.
THE COURT:

May, on reaching age 50, an officer be continued?

MR. O'MALLEY:

He may not, Your Honor--

4

THE COURT:

Under any circumstances?

MR. O'MALLEY:
THE COURT:

Oh, I see.

MR. O'MALLEY:
pension.

Unless he has not served 20 years yet.

He must serve 20 years before he is granted a

That problem doesn't come up in any substantial degree.

THE COURT:

But if he has served 20 years, and reaches age 50,

he may not be continued.

There is no process to continue him.

He must

retire.
MR. O'MALLEY:

Exactly, Your Honor.

THE COURT:

I see.

THE COURT:

Mr. O'Malley, how can the 20-year problem ever come up

if you have, as I understand frcm your brief, you do have, another statute
that one may not enter into the service beyond age 307
MR. O'MALLEY:
the

Historically, Your Honor, about .i5 people have been over

age of 50 upon retirement.

A large number of that group was kept after

age 50 because they were veterans in World War II and went over

the

enlistment age and a special act was enacted so that they ».nuld still
enlist.

There were a few people that were members of the uniformed branch

before the enlistment statute was enacted in 1939, so it's very few cases.
There might be a few others where a leave of absence was granted and then
an officer returned to the service.
THE COURT:

Well, if someone came in at the age of 48, he could serve

to the age of 68, on the face of the statute, couldn't he?
MR. O'MALLEY:

Yes, but no one could come in at the age of 48 now,

and historically no one had come in at the age of 48.
THE COURT:

One more question, now that I've interrupted you.

Is there

5

any right on the part of the colonel here, or anyone else, at age 50,
to transfer to some other division of the state police, where the
retirement age is later?
MR. O'MALLEY:
come up.

Not that I know of, Your Honor.

That hasn't really

The procedures for joining the detective branch, or any other

public service job, are very separate, and there is no particular
statute which gives any particular rights to another type of employment.
THE COURT:
does it not?

Massachusetts does have other mandatory retirement statutes,

You do have one affecting judges, do you?

MR. O'MALLEY:
THE COURT:

Yes, Your Honor.

And some other?

MR. O'MALLEY:

Yes, we have a very comprehensive retirement scheme

of which there are about four basic groups.

Group One is the general

category of employees; retirement is age 70.
THE COURT:

That's mandatory?

MR. O'MALLEY:

They're all mandatory.

Group Two is generally more

hazardous duties than the average employees, which is 65.

Group Three

is the uniform branch of the state police, the age of 50.

And Group Four

is essentially local policemen and firemen, and so forth, which is age
65.

So there are a great number of public employees covered by

retirement provisions.
THE COURT:

You're not uncomfortable because everyone on this bench

is over 50, are you?
MR. O'MALLEY:
because of that.

I am uncomfortable, your honor, but not essentially

6

THE COURT:

We're not uniformed state policemen.

MR. O'MALLEY:
THE COURT:

Exactly, Your Honor.

We're not uncomfortable, either.

MR. O'MALLEY:

The fact that the age for retirement at 50 is lower

than the general retirement age does not justify carving out an exception
to the general rule that the retirement statutes are constitutional.
Performance of the public safety duties of the state police require a
high degree of strength, agility, and stamina.

It was found by the

district court that the ability to perform these functions generally
decreases with age.

Drawing the line at age 50 is well within the

legislative discretion, in setting a mandatory retirement age.

In fact,

the district court acknowledged that the service in the uniformed branch
is significantly different from that of other law enforcement groups,
and the fact that a higher retirement age is set for the state police
detectives and local police did not provide the basis for a viable equal
protection claim.

The attack on the statute made by the plaintiff

essentially is that because there is this medical examination procedure,
it is irrational to use any other procedure relative to retirement.
It is very important to note what the medical examination does and
what it does not.

It has a very limited function. As described by the state

police surgeon in his testimony, the purpose of the examination is to deter­

measure the rate of aging or the functional age of an

These are all

areas where there is a great degree of medical

uncertainty and the testing in the area is still in its state of infancy.
3ecause of this testimony, there is a great degree of uncertainty, and
the legislative determination should be upheld.

Indeed, when concerning

the area of incurring diseases generally associated with aging, the
plaintiff's expert testified that we don't know much about the causes of
most of the

diseases we think of as diseases of aging.

purposes of

the medical exam, also shows the distinct purposes of the

retirement statute.

The medical is based on definable medical conditions

which may be determined by a medical examination.
THE COURT:

Showing the distinct

The goal is—

Mr. O'Malley, would you be making the same argument if

your system were, didn't have built-in physical examinations?

Just age

50 as the retirement age?
MR. O'MALLEY:

The district court ruled that because we had the

examinations available, the statute was irrational.

We would also state

that the statute would certainly be rational is there were no medical
procedures.

In fact, a major point we wish to make today, Your Honor,

that if the statute is held unconstitutional, solely because the state
has attempted in some manner to make individualized determinations, then
the effect would be to hinder experimentation and the utilization of
individualized medical tests.
THE COURT:

You could argue that the existence of the medical

examination requirement after age 40 means that a decision had been
made that after age 40 the policeman in uniform is in a suspect class,

8

in a sense, and *hey cut it off at 50 with a cursory rule.
MR. O'MALLEY:

Yes, Your Honor,

The district court said that we

hadn't proved that a critical area was reached at age 50.

The experience

of the state police is that they have an examination biannually before the
age of 40.

Once they reach the age of 40, because as the state police

surgeon testified, there is a high degree of incurring hypertension and
other cardiovascular diseases, the tests must be given annually.

Moreover,

the test is also expanded to include electrocardiograms and other procedures,
because of the concern they have with officers of that age.
THE COURT:

—(illegible)— I'd like a summary.

THE COURT:

Yes, footnote 90 suggests 70, and in the text he's

talking about 55, as every other state has this kind of law, mandates
retirement at 55 rather than 50, and I thought that at least largely
they thought 50 was just too young.
MR. 0lMALLEY:

I think that explains the opinion, that he thought

50 was too young.
THE COURT:

Yes, well, what I'm trying to get at is, it really is

the thrust of his invalidation that Massachusetts has this individual
medical examination requirements?
MR. O'MALLEY:

He never really defined the critical area, or how

it was defined, but the first thing he did note, Your Honor, was that
medical screening, individualized judgments, are not only practical, but
available.

Therefore, it was irrational to have this overall cut off.

And from there—

9

THE COURT:

It certainly sounds as though he thought that 50

was just irrational, under any circumstances.
MR. O'MALLEY:
THE COURT:

I think so, Your Honor.

At 55 might be all right; 70 certainly might be all

right.
MR. O'MALLEY:

If you apply the analysis of the district court to a

55-year-old retirement statute, I don't see how it could be any different.
THE COURT:

I guess it's true, is it not?

He says that the

plaintiff has furnished a list of statutes in which it appears
Massachusetts is the only state compulsarily retiring police officers
before age 55.

Page 28 of the jurisdictions statement.

MR. O'MALLEY:

Your Honor, with respect to the other states and

their retirement statutes, I did note that the State of Delaware has
a 20-year service requirement and an officer must retire upon reaching,
serving 20 years.
THE COURT:

Even if he's only in his 40s?

MR. O'MALLEY:

Yes, so that might well work out to be an

earlier retirement age.

Moreover, the State of Maine has a 25-year

service requirement, and if the average age of enlistment is 25, a
50-year-old retirement statute would pertain there.

However, the state,

having undertaken these medical examinations, is not confined to merely
removing the physically unfit.

The retirement statute is a very positive

objective, which is to promote the overall capability of the force as
a whole.

Therefore, the retirement statute for uniformed members of

the state police is a rational exercise of legislative power, and the
judgment of the district court should be reversed.

10

THE COURT:
MR. CITY:

Mr. City?
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

The single issue before this Court is whether the United States
District Court of the District of Massachusetts was declaring that
portion of a Massachusetts statute which separated members of the
uniformed branch of the Massachusetts state police from the general
retirement classification in which they had been placed, and forced
mandatory retirement upon these officers at the age of 50 on the
grounds that these men were superannuated.

The undisputed facts show

that each officer has beer, determined fit to continue in his duties.
The basis of the decision of the court below rests upon its analysis
of this statute in terms of the equal protection clause of the 14th
Amendment.
THE COURT:

You say each officer, Mr. City.

I thought earlier

someone sa \j this was not a class action.
MR. CITY:

It's not a class action, Your Honor.

The point that I'm

making here is that the elaborate medical screening which the uniform
branch uniformly applies across-the-board from the time a man first joins
to the time he reaches his 50th year is applied to every single member.
THE COURT:
MR. CITY:

I see.
And, it's our contention that having screened this group

through this fine mesh, the only group that reaches 50, the only group
that can continue to serve at age 50, because everyone who doesn't meet these
standards is set aside--he just cannot continue to serve—so the only way
you can get to reach your 50th year is to continue to be fit.

Therefore,

11

the group upon which this statute applies its acioss-the-board
classification is a group which by definition—the Commonwealth has already
defined as fully fit and fully qualified to perform.
THE COURT:

Doesn't this show that Massachusetts has a view that

beginning at age 40 they must check their members of their police force
annually to determine their fitness for duty?
permanently at age 50?
MR. CITY:

And then they cut off

Well, I think that the district court opinion

addresses itself to that problem, and I think the later that we get in
age, the inevitable aging does set in, and the problems that are incumbent
upon us become greater.
THE COURT:

But, Your Honor, let me suggest this—

Well, have you answered my question?

Would you be here

i f the age were "">?
MR. CITY:

i uwuld not be here provided that at age 55, the medical

testing, which is already the order of the day, showed one of two things:
one, it showed that some of the group, at least some of the group, were
not being fit.

Were just not able to meet standard.

That is, in any

given year, the number who would come back was significantly less.
Secondly, the district court suggests that perhaps the issue of

12

predictive validity is another reason to retire men.

That perhaps

ac age 50 or 51, even though a man passes a physical examination, it's
no assurance that he's going to continue to be fit for the next year
until he's examined again.

The evidence shows that in the case of

airline pilots the predictive validity of physical examinations as
extensive and elaborate as this one really only begins to break down
at around the age of 60.
THE COURT:
MR. CITY:

So the point is--

This is for airline pilots?
Airline pilots.

I would say, Your Honor, that that

would be the most critical situation; here you have to worry about a man
suffering a disability under stress situations.

I think that while state

police may be in analogous situations, I think that they are not in as
regularly, so I would submit to the court that the standards used in
airline pilots are certainly the rigorous ones, and I think the
Commonwealth is hard placed to—
THE COURT:

Also, too,the examination is much more extensive.

Much more.
MR. CITY:

Your Honor, I would submit that the examination used in

this case, which covers 60 pages of the appendix here, is an extremely
extensive physical examination.
THE COURT:
MR. CITY:

Is it my understanding that airline pilots-Your Honor, we had a medical expert who testified in

this case, who was similar--who was familiar with the medical—was a
doctor for the airlines, and was familiar with the medical tests> and
he felt that they were comparable.

13

I think one point ought to be cleared up:

state police

officers are members of the Department of Public Safety, and are
classified under the General Massachusetts Retirement Statute as
Group Three employees.

If you look in the General Massachusetts

Retirement Statute, you will find that Group Three employees are
required to retire at age 55.

The statute which is the subject of the

case before this Court selects particular members of the state police,
that is, members of the uniformed branch, selects them out of Group
Three, and puts them in a separate subclassification which requires
retirement at age 50.

And the statute by its terms says it does this on

the grounds that these men are superannuated.

That is, that the

state's necessary interest in keeping a fit force-THE COURT:

They mean superannuated in relation to the duties

they are called on to perform, do they not?
MR. CITY:

That's—I think that's correct, Your Honor.

It's a

function of the relationship.,
THE COURT:

Well, an airline pilot is presumed superannuated,

possibly so, at 60, and not later, I think it is, than 64.

But lawyers

and judges are not necessarily, or librarians, superannuated at 60,
of 64, or 65.
MR. CITY:

Are they?
There's no doubt, Your Honor, that there are different

retirement ages for different activities.

And again I want to make clear,

we are not challenging here the variable retirement ages which the statute
applies in Massachusetts.

We're talking about 70 for the general employees,

65 for the oolicemen, whose duties are quite similar to the state
policemen, have to retire at age 65, even age 55, for the members of the

14

Department of Public Safety.

We're talking about a situation here

where they take and remove this particular subgroup from age 55 and
require them to retire at age 50.
THE COURT:

What language, what statutory language, were you

referring to, Mr. City?

When you said the language, when you said the

statute made specific references and gave us a specific reason—the
hypothesis that these people were superannuated.

What language were

you refering to?
MR. CITY:

The language, your honor, in the first part of chapter

32, in the definitions section, provides that a man will b& retired
for superannuation.

I think the appendix will show that the notice that

Colonel Murgia received from the Board of Retirement provides that you
will be retired for superannuation at your 50th birthday.
THE COURT:

Now, in assessing the constitutional validity of this

state statute, are you suggesting that we're confined to assessing it
to—the reason that the state gave for it?
MR. CITY:
THE COURT:

I would submit, Your Honor—
In other words, if we found that perhaps the

presumption of superannuation might not support this, constitutionally,
but that other factors and/or considerations might, we're not bound
by the reason the state gave, are we?
MR. CITY:

I would suggest, Your Honor, that this Court should be

bound by the purposes stated in the statute the-THE COURT:

You're not suggesting that that's traditional,

15

conventional constitutional law?
MR. CITY:

No, sir, I think there is, I will admit there is some

dicta in some of the cases of this Court, particularly dealing with
cases involving economic regulation, where there is language--that is,
this Court can conceive of any rational basis to support the statute, I
would say that—
THE COURT:

The presumption is, of course, you would agree, that the

statute is valid.
MR. CITY:

There's no doubt about that.

That burden remained

on the plaintiff throughout, and I think the district court found that
we adequately carried our burden.
THE COURT:

And the equal protection clause is that if any

rational set of facts can be conceived of that would support this
legislation, it will be upheld.

You say that economic legislation--

and what else is this but economic legislation?
MR. CITY:
issues here.

Well, Your Honor, I think there are really a number of
I think this somewhat of a novel case.

Without any

doubt, this is economic legislation in that the Commonwealth has a
legitimate right to provide for retirement benefits for its employees.
Ori the other hand, I think that we have here issues which deal with age
discrimination, we have deep issues here dealing with a man's
employment.

I think the fundamental issue that we're talking about

here, which is a personal right, is a right not to be classified
irrationally, on the basis of age.
THE COURT:

Well, that's just a play on words, it seems to me.

It doesn't fit in at all with our equal protection decisions which

16

Justice Stewart just reminded you of, that say if any rational set of
facts can be conceived that will support the thing, it will be upheld.
MR. CITY:

My position is, even under that test, Your Honor,

there is no rational basis on the facts that we have before us here.
THE COURT:

But it isn't a question of the facts before us here,

or the facts on the basis on which the state did--says it relies.
if any set of facts can be conceived of.

It's

That's what this Court has

said time and time again.

We have gone through a number of hearings in this

I think that any justification should be permitted to be

tested before the bar—before the Court—and I think it's a very
difficult standard, if ultimately the justification for any particular
statute can rest on a justification which this Court might simply conceive
of at this point.

I think if, at the very least, if that were the case,

we should be permitted the opportunity perhaps to go back to the lower court
arid to test and see if a rational — is the justification suggested here is,
in fact, rational.
THE COURT:

But i+'s not a question of fact.

It's a question of

It isn't something that you try in the district court

and decide whether the district court reaches a different view than the
legislature, which has the principle jurisdiction over the matter.

It's a

question, I think, of constitutional law, and I think that's what those

17

questions Justice Stewart propounded to you mean.

It isn't a question

that you need more factual hearings on.
MR. CITY:

I agree with you, Your Honor.

I would suggest that a

rational, or ari explanation for a statute must withstand the scrutiny of
some examination as to whether in fact it is rational.
THE COURT:

I agree.

What if the state just wanted all of its policemen to

not have gray hair as a matter of image or identification?

Just as a

person making a movie might want to have the lead roles played by people
who do not have gray hair.

Regardless of their health.

And what if a

state said, any policemen whose hair turns gray can no longer be a policeman
working for us because we want only people whose hair is not gray?
a matter of image for our police force.
MR. CITY:

It's

No matter how healthy.

I would submit, Your Honor, that that is just not a

rational basis on which to make a determination.
THE COURT:

Why wouldn't it be?

As a matter of the United States

Constitut:nn?
MR. CITY:

I think it is a matter of the United States Constitution,

the classification a state makes, by which it selects to retire its people,
has got to have some functional relationship to the job it seeks to
accomplish.
THE COURT:

What you're saying, then, is that the legislature of the

state cannot act on the generalization that men over 50 are not as
competent to perform rigorous police duties as men 50 and under.

That's

what you're saying, isn't it?
MR. CITY:

No, sir.

I'm not quite saying that.

I'm saying that

18

the legislation might as well be able to do that, but that we have a
unique factual situation here.

We in fact have preexisting, individual

testing and the data which that testing shows, shows the legislature
that the classification it's making is irrational.

So I'd like to

qualify what you've said—
THE COURT:

So, if they'd abolish all of the medical examinations,

you wouldn't be here?
MR. CITY:

Is that what you're saying?

I think that the holding of the district court, which

is the only issue that we have here before us, says that when the
legislature is involved in an admittedly arbitrary line-drawing,
which is the classification here, and too, it already has the data, it
is not burdened to go out and get it—it already has the data which shows
that the operation of that qualification is totally irrational —
THE COURT:

You think the data in the record shows that men over

50 do not get tired quicker?
MR. CITY:
THE COURT:

More quickly?

I think that the record shows that-Or that men over 50 don't have the endurance that men

under 50—
THE COURT:
MR CITY:

Or that their reflexes aren't as swift?
I think that the standard that is required by the state

police is set forward in its examination.
THE COURT:

Well, that isn't what I asked you.

I asked you, does

the record—is the record responsive to the questions I asked you?
MR. CITY:

Well, Mr. Justice White, I think that without any

question age is a factor here.
THE COURT:
here.

A man who is 50 may in some instances--

Well, you know, we speak with some personal knowledge

19

MR. CITY:

Exactly, Your Honor.

But the fact of the matter is,

though, that the standards which are required to perform the duties
are fully met by the testing.

So that I would submit that even though

a man of 50 may not be as fast as a man who is 20, the man who is 50, so
long as he meets the regulations set by the police, by the state police
here, is capable enough to do his job, and I submit that the difference
that he may experience personally between when he was 20 and when he was
50 is irrelevant to his competence to complete his job.
THE COURT:

Well, again, you're just saying that we shouldn't

be entitled to add to the possible qualification that the state is
asking of its policemen.

If they might have thought that men over

50 get tired faster, and if they might have thought that was an important
matter to consider in having policemen, can we recognize that?
MR. CITY:

I'm suggesting that they could recognize that; except in

this instance, Your Honor, I think again that where we have this
individualized medical testing, it belies that.
THE COURT:

I think that actually those requirements after

40, that each officer have a medical examination—I would suppose that
really evidence of that, what the legislature tnought was:

you ought to

go at 50, but maybe you'll deteriorate before age 50, between 40 and
50, and we want to examine you each year to see if we ought to let you
out before you reach age 50.

Not that they introduced the requirement

of the examination to determine whether at 50 or after one is still
capable.

MR. CITY:

I think Senior .Judge Aldridge said to the legislature,

that's something you can't do if you're going to do that testing.

Then

you can't have it both ways, that you can't have this arbitrary line that
you establish at 50 because-THE COURT:

Well, I gather if that's what he said, then what we've

got before us is whether he was right in saying it.
MR. CITY:

I think that's what the court was saying.

It's a

combination of factors, and I think without the medical examination,
the issue may not have existed.
I would like to speak just briefly about the point of the retirement
benefits, which has been brought up here.
provision of

It's been suggested that the

retirement benefits is the reason for the subclassification.

I would submit that on examination that just isn't the case.

We have

here state police officers who are classified under the statute as
belonging to Group Three.
to retirement benefits.
of this case,

As officers under Group Three they are entitled
The particular statute, which is the subject

takes the members out of Group Three, and puts them into

a classification

which requires them to retire five years earlier.

Since

they were already entitled to all of the benefits in Group Three, and this
subclassification doesn't supply any substantially different or additional
benefits, it can't be justification for the statute to provide this
subclassification on the basis that it's providing retirement benefits for-THE COURT:

Well, this is not just a matter of drawing different

lines for different functions in the government?

21

MR. CITY:

No, your honor, I think the legislative package here

clearly shows that the--what we're talking about here is a particular
subclassification, the statute in its first one or two sections sets
out the general terms of--establishes these three general classifications.
Then when we get all the way back to section 26, we find a specific
subclassification which is limited to just the members of the uniform
branch.

So, I think we're not talking about four classifications here,

we're talking about three classifications and then a subclassification
to that.

And I would submit that if the rationale for supplying

retirement benefits is a justification for taking this subclassification
out and treating these members essentially different from any others,
then retirement statutes in general will be a subterfuge for the state
to practice age discrimination.
Tnank you.
THE COURT:

Mr. City, I understand that the original complaint,

it also alleged sex discrimination, in that women officers, or at least
some of them, were not required to retire at age 50.

MR. CITY:
THE COURT:

No, sir.

That issue is not.

Thank you.

Is that issue
