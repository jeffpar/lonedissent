OEMs ARGUMENT OF KEITH A, JONES ON
BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. JONESs
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This case under the False Claims Act arises out

of respondents3 fraudulent supply of nonconforming electron
tubes for us® in Array radio communications kits.

The facts

ar@ as follows:
In 1962 the Signal Supply Agency, acting on behalf
of the Department of the Army, entered into a contract with
\

a private company, Model Engineering and Manufacturing
Corporation, for the supply of radio kit sets.

Each set was

to contain a transmitter, a receiver, power supply, trans­
former, and radio accessory kit.
The radio accessory kits operated with 4X15OG
c
electron tubes. The contract required that these tubes be
JAN branded.
Army-Navy.

JAN, J-A-N, is an acronym standing for Joint
The manufacturer is authorised to us© the JAN

designation only after its manufacturing processes pass
certain Government tests for quality control and the tubes
themselves pass certain Government inspection tests.

Thus,

by calling for JAN tubes in the contract, the contract in

4
effect required th© fur.ai3fe2.ng of tube© that war© certified
as having asst certain Government standards as to both
manufacture and performance.

The call for JM tubes in the

contract can therefore be seen to foe more than a mere
technical formality. Although the record is silent on this
point, it may reasonably be inferred that the radio sets
which, as I have indicated

included both receiver and

transmitter, would be used for the Array for field communications
and that a tub© failure can impair the military operations
that might be dependent upon such communications.
Th© rigid quality control and performance standards
represented by JAN branding therefore serves to minimis® the
risk of such a tub© failure.

This consideration, I believe,

indicates th® practical importance of the contractual require­
ment that the tabos to foe supplied would fos JAM tubes.

And

it also underlines th© seriousness of th© respondents5 fraud
which I will now describe.
Respondents w@r© the owners and operators of a
i

corporation, United National Labs, that entered into a contract
with tli© prim© contractor. Modal, Engineering, for the supply
of the JAM tubas called for by the contract.

St is undisputed

in this case that the respondents caused and war© responsible
for all the acts of their corporation, Unitad National Labs,
and therefor© it is appropriate in further describing the facts
in this case to raise the corporate veil and talk solely in

5

terms of the respondents" individual acts attributing the acts
of fch© corporation to the; respondents as well.
The respondents ware dealers in electron tubes,: and
they entered into fch® subcontract with Model Engineering
knowing that the tubes to be furnished thereunder were to be
used in a military procurement contract*
At the time they entered into this subcontract, fch®
prevailing market price for JAN tubes of fch© type specified

in the contract was approximately $40 per tube.

Instead of

buying and supplying these kinds of tubas, respondents
instead bought cheaper tubes at prices ranging from $15 to
$3.8, and they falsely stamped each tub© with the JAN designa­
tion*

Thus we have here a case of fraud, pur® and simple,

committed solely for the purpose of making a dishonest profit.
Respondents made three shipments of a total of
397 falsely branded tubes*

The tubes were packaged in 21

separate boxes, and each box was accompanied by a packing list
to which the respondents affixed a false Government inspection
stamp.

Respondents billed Modal Engineering, the prim®

contractor, for the tubes on three separata invoices*.

In turn, Model Engineering incorporated these tubes
into the radio kit sets that it supplied to the Army, and it
billed the Array for the tubas on 35 separate invoices or
claims for payment.

Each of these claims•for payment represented

falsely, because of the respondents* fraud, that the electron

6
tubes furnished ia the xvAio kit sets vr< re Qormrmmnt inspected
JAN tubes.

13i® Government paid the 35 claims for payment.
When respondents' fraud w&s subsequently discovered,

after some negotiation, Model Engineering, the prime contractor,
paid the Government a total of a little bit more, than $16,000
for the breach of contract that had been occasioned by the
respondents1 fraud.
QUESTIONS

Did Model pay it, or was it withheld

from Government payment to Model?
MR. JONES s

I think that the Government owed-Model

moneys in connection with scan® other contract and that the
$16,000-odd her® was withheld from that other payment.
QUESTION?

In this connection, are the respondents

responsible, liable to Modal?

And if

bo,

has Model ever

instituted suit against them?
MR, JONES:

Now, ‘that raises two questions, one of

contract law that I cannot answer because these respondents
ar© .individuals and I do not know whether they would b® liable
in contract to Model Engineering.

It was their corporation,

United National Labs,that actually was in the privity of
contract relation with Model,
The second question is a factual on®, and I simply
don't know the answer to it, and X don:t think it's in the
record.
QUESTION:

Well, certainly, there is incipient

7
liability, isn't there, the possibility of liability*
MR. JONES t

Y@s, there is , and that is the basis for

the Government’s concession that it. would be appropriate in
determining double, damages to allow a certain credit for the
payment that Model Engineering made? and 1 will get to that
aspect of the case in a moment.
QUESTIONs

If they defrauded the Government, they

defrauded Model, too.
MR* JONES?
QUESTIONs

That’s correct.
It wouldn’t have to b© based on contract

liability.
MR. JONESs

The respondents as individuals themselves

might be liable in tort.

Perhaps that’s so, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist.
At any rate, under the theory that they will be
liable in on® form or another, we haws not pressed the full
double damages liability but rather have indicated that sew®
kind of allowance may be appropriate on account of Model’s
payment to the Government.
QUESTIONi

Like in the full amount.

MR. JONES; . Like in the full amount, but only as
against fch© double damages.
QUESTIONs

Yes, but nevertheless you don’t expect to

collect that amount again.
MR. JONES;

No, we don’t expect —

QUESTION:

If there is liability there, then 2

suppose your suggestion — 2 think there was orm in the brief •—
of 'the respondents • profiting by their fraud may wall
©vaporat®.
MR, JONES:

Weil, I certainly hop® so.

At trial of tlm case, the district court determined
that the Government's actual injury from the breach of contract
was approximately the same that Model had paid to th© Government
but $39.70 more.

The district court further determined that

respondents* acts in supplying th© falsely stamped tub©a
thereby causing th® submission of false claims to the Government
violated the False Claims Act,and the respondents have not
contested that determination either in the court of appeals or
in this Court.
The issues in this case pertain to the consequences
that flow from the district court’s finding of a violation of
th® False Claims Act.

Th@ra are two issuess

on® concerns the question of whether there are
multiple forfeitures that may be imposed against respondents
for their violation.
The Government takes the position that the respondents

9

here are subject to a total of 35 $2,000 forfeitures under
the Act, one for each of the 35 false claims for payment that
were mad© as a result of their fraud.
Respondents assert that they are subject to only on®
forfeiture payment because they say their fraud affected only
one subcontract and that is how they would measure th® number
of forfeitures under the Act*

And th© court of appeals

sustained th© respondents9 position.
Ik it Government practice on the accounting

QUESTIONS

side to require a separate voucher for each shipment?
MR. JONES:

In this case there were actually eight

Government vouchers of payment.

Mod©.! submitted 35 invoices

for payment.
QUESTIONs

They accumulate them and pay in groups,

apparently»
MR. JONES:
in this case.

Yes, that's apparently what took placa

And I don't know over what course of time the

various claims and payments war© made.
The other issue in the case

we have already talked

about a little bit is the question of the proper measurement
of double, damages.

Both courts below sustained the respondents9

contention that th© Government's single damages under the Act
for purposes of computing double damages is limited to th®
amount of the Government's injury less its recoveries from the
prime contractor.

Accordingly the courts below determined

10
singles damages of $39.70 and doufola damages of $79.40.
Our position•on this issue is that for determining single
damages you look to the Government's actual injury at the time
of the discovery of the fraud?to gat double damages you
double that amount.

Tha Government's injury was $16?000-odd,

to double that you get $32,000.

But we have further submitted

the respondents should be allowed credit against that $32,000
double damages liability in the amount of the recoveries from
the prime contractor.
Now, before turning to an .analysis of these two
separate issues, X would like to point out to the Court the
combined effect of the court of appeals' decisions on these
issues taken as a whole, and that effect, we feel, is to
eviscerat® the False Claims Act as a deterrent to subcontractor,
fraud.
The court imposed upon the respondents in this case
a paltry penalty of only $2,079.40, and that penalty, the
penalty imposed by the court of appeals, permits the
respondents to retain over three-quarters of the illegal gain
that they mad® by supplying fell® Government with cheap tubes
rather1 than the JAN tubes required by the contract.

And we

submit that the puny threat of such disproportionately small
penalty 'is unlikely to deter any subcontractor from attempting
to defraud the Government.

If'the fraud goes undetected, the

subcontractor reaps a dishonest profit’, and pays no penalty

11
whatsoever,

if, on th® other hand, as in this ce.se, the fraud

is discovered, the subcontractor nevertheless pays hack to the
Government only a small fraction, of the dishonest profit or
the illegal gain,
QUESTION:

But isn't he subject to criminal

prosecution and isn't there a deterrence: on
MR, JONES:
side,

the criminal side?

There is some deterrence on the criminal

It wasn't terribly effective in this case*
QUESTION:

Well, you just said that if the fraud

isn't discovered, there is no deterrence.

That’s true of

crime also, isn’t it?
MR. JONES:

Yes, but what we are now talking about

; ;• placing at least a substantial deterrence oac® there is a
discovery*
I would further point out that although these
.respondents wore prosecuted and convicted of conspiracy,
apparently there is no criminal statute which by its terms
would prohibit the substantive act of causing a falsa claim
to be made.

If you look at 18 U.S.C. 287, it punishes the

making of false claims, but what we are concerned with in this
case with regard to contractors is causing a third party to
make falsa claims,
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

Not even an aider and abettor?
Well, I don’t know if you can be an

aider and abettor if there is no substantive crime by another

12
person and there would bs no substantive crime by the prim©
contractor because fea unknowingly mad» the submission, of false
claims „

I’m not saying there is no possible criminal

punishment other than under a conspiracy clause.

1 am just

pointing out that the criminal and civil statutes am not
coterminus and it’s by no means positive that you can always
punish criminally the kinds of acts that we are now trying to
impose a civil penalty on.
QUESTION?

I didn’t follow that.

MR. JONESs

To summarise the court of appeals

decision» the court of appeals has in our view converted the
False Claims Act into little more than an inexpensive license
to defraud the Government» license» moreover» as I have just
indicated# that must be paid for only if the fraud is
discovered.
that result.

We believe Congress could not and did not intend
Indeed» as I now hop® to show» Congress intended

a vary different result indeed.
Again for purposes of convenience of exposition
with the question of double damages» 1 have one important
thought to add to what vm said in our brief on that issue» and
I would like to address that at the outsat.
Respondents" contention here is that the prime
contractor’s payment to the Government of single contract
damages in.effect absolves the respondents from any liability
under the False Claims Act double damages provision.

Ana this

13
contention can fairly b® tested, 1' thirk, by asking what would

if the singl© contract damages

th® consequences have
)

payment had bean made not by the prim© contractor but by the
respondents themselves?

Could respondents have insulated

themselves from any liability for double damages by coming
forward after th® discovery of fraud merely with the payment
of single damages?
QUESTION g

What if before the discovery of fraud,

th® day after they sent th® stuff, they simply had a change
of heart and before th® Government ever discovered the fraud
they sent single damages?
MR, JONESs

-Well, I would think that from & purely

dry, logical reading of th® Act, that double damages would
have in fact been — the liability for double damages would in
fact hav© been incurred as of th© date of the fraud.

But there

might be a question whether had there been a payment the next
day there had actually bean an injury to th® Government.
QUESTION%

Would you say, X believe the double

damages become fixed when they cause to be submitted to th©
Government the false
MR. JONESs

Well, that is ~~ well, th© violation of

the Act has become complete at that point.
QUESTION %

Otherwise, I suppose any time a prime

contractor or anybody else defrauds th® Government — seems to
have defrauded the Government, he could reduce his liability

14
to single damages by paying.
MR. JOKES %

Well, that9s esca«3tly our point»

Respondents seem to think that they or the prim© contractor
can come in after fraud has seen discovered and after the
injury has already been sustained and reducd their liability
under -the double damages provision of the Act from double
damages

to single damages merely by earning forward voluntarily

with the payment»
But that * s clearly not the case.

Respondents could

not have escaped their own liability for double damages simply
by offering single damages.
QUESTXQHs

yet if Modal had discovered the fraud

and refused to submit the invoices to the Government, then
although the respondents * fraud' was complete, they never would
nave become liable to the Government.
MR. JOKES?

In that case, there might not have even

baan a violation of the False Claims Act.
QUESTION %
MR. JONES;

They would not have caused
They would not have caused, the submission

of a false claim and there would have been no injury to the
Government for the purposes of the double damages provision
either.
Well; wa believe that this analysis that I have just,
gone through, which I am sorry to say was not set forward
with any clarity in our brief, is dispositive of respondents *

15
double damages claim in this case.
I would recommend to the Coart tho reading of
brief for further arguments on this point.

oar

But I would like

to turn for the remainder of my argument to the question of
multiple forfeitures
Th® first clause of the False Claims Act which is
the relevant clause in this case provides, and I quote with
some deletions, non® of which, I hop®, change th® substance;
"Any person who shall make or cause to be made any claim upon
tie United States or any department or officer thereof,,
knowing such claim to b® false, shall forfeit and pay to the
United States th© sum of $2,000."
It is well established that as to prime contractors
this language imposes a separata $2,000 forfeiture for each
false claim for payment•

Since the Act imposes & forfeiture

on any falsa claim, the statutory violation is complet® upon
the presentation of th® first false claim and a forfeiture
arises on account of that violation.

Each additional false

claim constitutes a separate and complete violation of th® Act
that gives rise to an additional forfeiture.

Thus a prim®

contractor who, for example, knowingly submitted 35 false
claims for payment to the Government unquestionably would be
liable for 35 separate forfeitures.
We believe that, the same reading of the Act per fores
applies to subcontractor fraud.

In the first place, it was

16
established by this Courtis opinio» in United States ok rel.
Marcus v. Eae.a that a

g;- abcox.tre%... :<£

violatas the Act. when its

fraud causes tbs prim© contractor to submit a false claim for
payment to the Government .

Th© subcontractor's violation is

complete when the prime contractor submits its first false
claim and a forfeiture arises at that time*

Every additional

submission of a false claim is a separate and complete viola­
tion of the Act that gives rise to an additional forfeiture.
In

short,, the plain language of the Act requires the number

of forfeitures to fea determined in the same fashion whether
the fraud originates with the prim® contractor or as in this
case the subcontractor.
Now, this, w© bsliev®, to b© a sensible and natural
result, because, after all, the Government's injury is the
sasais whether the fraud originates with the contractor or
subcontractor.

The need for deterrence is the same whether

the fraud originates with the contractor or the subcontractor.
And there !©• no reason to distinguish between these two cases.
The respondents9 argument moreover, which is that
you measure the subcontractor's forfeiture by the number of
subcontracts, has utterly no basis in the statutory text.
There is just nothing in the language of the Act that produces
that result.
Not only is our result supported by -the statutory
text, it serves the twin purposes of deterrence and restitution

17

that underlie the Act.

As w© point out in the brief, and I

won *t repeat those arguments her®, it would b© a mockery of
th® legislative intent to lump, as respondents would have
this Court do, all fck© subcontractors * fraudulent practices
and derelictions into a single statutory violation.
Mow, tliis more or less furnishes th® Court with our
affirmative presentation on this issue.

Mow, we will address

what seam to me to be the two threads of argument that th®
respondents present here.

One appears to be that th® False

Claims Act should be narrowly construed in th® matter of
criminal statute.

1’n not sure what kind of narrow construction

they would intend sine® there is no apparent basis in th©
language of the Act for their result anyway.
point

But 1 would

out that th© Court has already rejected the principle

of construction upon which they rely.
In United States mi rel. Marcus v,,.Hess the Court
held that the forfeiture provisions of th® Act imposes civil
not a criminal sanction, and perhaps more to th® point, in
United States,v.Keifert"White Co. the Court stated, and I
quotas

"In the various contexts in which questions of th©

proper construction of the Act have been presented, th©
Court has consistently refused to accept a rigid, restrictive
reading, even at th© time when the statute imposed criminal
sanctions as wall as civil.”

Th© statute no longer imposes

any criminal sanctions? it*s a wholly civil statute that should

18
ba literally construed in a manner that will effectuate its
underlying purposes of deterrence and restitution*
Respondents * argument appears to h® that although
35 false claims for payment ware presented to the Government
ia this case, they nevertheless have committed only a single
causative act, a single act of causation deserving a penalty*
It’s difficult to know what basis the respondents
have for making that suggestion*

In the first, place, it is

clear that they committed many separate fraudulent acts*
falsely stamped each of 39? electron tubes.

They

They falsely

affixed false Government inspection stamps to each of 21
packing lists*

They submitted three false invoices to the

prim contractor, and they made false oral representations
to the contractor as well*
QUESTIONS

Does the Government take the position

that there are 190, in effect, false claims — 199 false
claims effected by ^respondents?
MR. JONESs

Well, I think the suggestion is that the

Government could take the position that, there were 397
violations of the Act as a consequence of•the falsa stamping
of ©ach of the 397 tubes*

The court of appeals s©@ma to

assume that the stamping of the tubes would constitute a
violation of the Act and of the second clause of the Act*

I

think that it’s arguable whether the Government would be able
to prevail because the categories of documents with respect

19
to which falsa entries ara punisfcsd under the second clause
of the Act 'would not appear to ix.clud© the tubes.
QUESTIONS

You have all kinds of numbers.

You have

MR,, JONES:

Well, the 199 is a marabar ttm respondent®
I think they arrived at it because there

war® 397 falsa tubes and they said well, each radio kit set
contains two tubes and therefore 198 kit sets would include
false tubes.

No one on the Government side has ever 'suggested

the figure 199.
The only figures — X can run through them — are
35 false claims under the first clause of the Act> 397
falsely stamped tubes under the second clause of the Act, but
X question whether you could find a violation with regard to
that; 21 falsely stamped package lists, and that probably is
a violation, causing the Government to issue —

Yes, air, Mr. Chief Justice, end may

X represent this Respondent Gerald Pag©

in this matter.
I don't think there is any dispute as to the fact
with

on®

exception.

‘That is. Mr. Jones' statement that the

repayment by Model to the Government was mad© in the form of a
deduction from other contracts .between Mod-el and the Government.
I think the documents which were included in the Government* s

22
appendix make it quit® clear that the deduction was from
payments due under this very same contract*

I pointed out the

numbers involved in my brief on pages 17 and 18 and X think
if you will leak at that? you will see it*a perfectly clear
that it comes under this same contract.
Addressing myself first to the question of the number
of forfeitures? Mr* Jones her® dealt with the different
numbers that might be used*

And as a matter of fact? the

Government’s position from the beginning of this litigation
has not been at all consistent.

As Judge Gibbons pointed out

in the decision in the court of appeals? originally the
Government based its claim for forfeitures not at all on
vouchers submitted by Model to the Government? but on its
claim that the respondents submitted 30 invoices to Model and
it assarted 30 forfeitures on that basis.

The shift came

whan I think it. found out that there were only three invoices
and then this theory came in that the respondents were now
liable, for on® forfeitures for each of 35 invoices submitted
by Model to the Government plus on© forfeiture each for the
joint act of misbranding the tubes? on® forfeiture for the
combined acts ©f submitting 21 packing lists, and one forfeiture
for the combined acts of submitted 21 certificates? a total of
38.

X take it 'that at this point they are now asking only for

35.
X think that what this demonstrates is that in fact

solely a civil statute# the criminal statute having been
absorbed elsewhere# it was written as a criminal statute
originally and.the language was quit© clear that forfeitures
were only to be imposed for acts committed by the person
charged with the forfeiture.

M I think ±t'-s for that reason

that I have stressed the correct reading of the statute# the
correct language as it actually exists on the statute books,,
QUESTION:

Well# as applied to this case# do you

think that operates as much of a deterrence for this kind of
corrupt conduct on the part of contractors?
MR. RCSSiMOOKE:

Well# the deterrent effect as it works

out in this case certainly is not as great as if you impose
35 forfeitures.

The deterrent effect comes from the criminal

statute# and 1 think the record her© shows that both of these
respondents were charged criminally# did plead guilty# and
were sentenced.

Now# the fact that they weren't deterred

previously# that's true of both any deterrent statute and any
criminal statute# they could have gone to jail for a long
period of time# they could have been fined, I think it's
$10#000.

This being a first offense# those penalties were not

visited upon them# font 1 think the threat of the criminal

25
process, £h® threat of tkm jail term would certainly be a such
greater deterrent -than the possibility of th© fortuitous
imposition of fines*
QUESTI OH s

There is nothing uncommon about having

the civil penalties in a situation like this be vastly more
than the criminal in terms of dollars.
MR* ROSSMOOREs

Nothing at all. In many cases it so

works out, and I guess even in the Hess ease the criminal (sic,)
penalties actually imposed war® greater than would have
been imposed had the defendant there been prosecuted criminally•
But the purpose of the statute, and l think this
Court has recognised it in the Hess case, is to provide
restitution for the Government.
QUESTION

Is that all?

MR. ROSSMOOREs
that

Just restitution?

I believe that's all*

And I think

the language of ‘id?.© Court in the Hass case so states.

HW© think that the chief purpose of the statute her® was to
provide restitution to the Government of money taken from it
by fraud and that the device of double damages plus &•
specific sum was chosen to make sure the Government would be
made completely whole.53

That's right, Mr. Justice, but the

That's right, sir.

On© act can

397 claims, in this particular case.

And perhaps it can be

made clearer, the Government's argument is that somehow the
subcontractor gets off easier -than the contractor in this
case because if the contractor himself were committing the
fraud, he submitted 35 claims.

Well, that is true, but the

contractor had th® power each time that he submitted the claim,
and let’s assume he knew he was submitting a false, claim, to say,
"Gee, I talked to my lawyer and I realise I'm going to fo© in
trouble, I’m not going to submit any more of these.

X may be

stuck with what I’ve submitted, but I’m not going to submit

any more ??

The subcontractor doesn't have that option®

Ha-

committed his fraud, ha submitted fch® false goods, and than he
is subjected to the multiplication of claims by acts over which
he has neither knowledge nor control, and that's why I say
that the impact of section 3490 is on the act committed by
the respondents, not on the subsequent acts committed by the
contractor, even though •

on© of those subsequent acts

is a necessary chain, it's the claim submitted.
QUESTIO!2
b®

You say the act, then, is the causing to

and that the subcontract only caused one.
MR. ROSSMOGRE s

The act that respondent here committed

was causing a claim to be submitted.

It wasn't submitting on©

or 35 or 307 claims.
I suppos» th@ problem with tins statute and the problem

that this Court and many of the lower courts have wrestled
i

with is that, it doss find its impact in such a great variety
of situations and there has been no broad statement as to what
the rule is.

It's been applied on a case-by-case basis and

the courts of appeals have com© to different conclusions,
although most of them, X think, except for the Court in the
Ueber case agree with the position we take in this case.

And at

the risk of being presumptuous, I would like to state what X
think might be a formulation of a rule for consideration by
this Court which would operate fairly and which would be in
accordance with the language of the statuto.

And that is that

23
a forfeiture'should he imposed for tael act or series of acts
or course of conduct by the defendant© in fcha case involved
which result in the payment of a false claim or claims by
the United States,

This formulation puts the emphasis where

it b@lori.g3f on the acts committed by the person charged with
the forfeiture.
So much for the forfeiture question.

X want to

touch briefly on just two thoughts with respect to the double
damages issue.

On© is, and X think it*s clear again in Mr,

Justice Black*s opinion in the Marcus v. Hess case that the
double damages provision originally cam® into this statute
because of the qul tarn provision, the informers

provision,

whereby it was thought that most of these actions at that time
would be brought by informers, the informer would get half of
tlsa recovery and the Government would than be made whole by
its half of the recovery.
Obviously, if that was the intent, if the Government
had already been paid or reimbursed, as it was in this case
by & credit in the same contract, no informer would consider
bringing a suit, there would be nothing to sue for.

The

Government hadn’t been damaged,

I think these ware informant's fees,

but it didn’t relate to the question of damages.
many statutes where there are informant's fees.

There art*
I think the

Public Contracts Act, the situation has worked out pretty much
a® we contend her® that any payment by the Government is first
deducted before the doubling of damages.

The informant

features still remains in our statutes, although in much
modified form in the 31 U.S.C. section 232 which is the
successor to the revised statute 3493.

At present, though, and

it*s only under limited circumstances the informer can gat up
to one-fourth of the recovery, bnt it's still there.
One final thought.
the trial court in U.S.

In the Hess case itself or in

esc rei» Marcus v. Hess, there were

a number of instances where the Government discovered the fraud
before it made payment.

The defendant's .argue that sine©

the fraud had been discovered, there ware no damages and
therefore there should be no forfeitures*

And the district

court’s decision which was eventually affirmed in this court
held that true, there were no damages to be doubled, but there
was still a claim for forfeitures.

This was pointed out again

in this Court in the Rsx Trailer case on page 153, footnote 5,
and I think that at least in part answers the question of
whether the Government can first double the damages and than

31
deduct any eradit*

I think the .answer, is that it cannot and

should not, both because of the history of- the way this
statute was put together in the ~#X '"feat; actiojvi and because of
the interpretations that have been placed upon it.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACK BALLAN ON BEHALF
OF RESPONDENT 30RKSTEIN
MR. BALLANs
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I don’t wish fee be repetitive.

I hop® you will bear

with so® if I am.
I would like to just emphasise a few points that
perhaps have also been mentioned before.

One is that this

is ambiguous, and indeed the last paragraph of the
circuit court’s opinion indicates when it says it cries out
for interpretation or revision, &nd perhaps that’s why we are
here.

And I raise this because I think that the courts have

been struggling with this ambiguity, these ambiguities and
these overlapping sections and have com® up with reasonable
guidelines, not sufficient, admittedly, but reasonable guidelines
to date.

And may X say that in each case that 1 have read, 1

can find no exception, there has been a minimisation of claims
front the subcontractor through the contractor.
this is the

2n other words,

only case that X know of, and T. stand to be

32
corrected If I'm wrong*

the acts of the subcontractor

have been maximised rather than the reveren.

Even in the

Uebar case which is varf heavily relied upon by the Government,
there were 442 false invoices submitted to the two general
contractors by the subcontractor.

They were reduced, to 54.

And it makes it clear in this case that there was a pass"through
that these invoices that were ultimately submitted' arose out
of, truly arose out of, and truly were caused by, the acts of
the .subcontractor»
la this «as® I think it's fair to say that w® did not
truly cause the 35 claims to be filed.
b® filed, but not 35,»

sis did cause claims to

And as 1 think Mr. Justice Powell

indicated, the Government could go up to 500 in this instance
.if it wished to.

It could look for all types of false

documents and include them in their false claims.

But this

would be a gross injustice, I think, and would be a misreading
of the statute which admittedly has some problems.
Mow, I think it's fair, than, to say that the'
subcontractor here should be charged with his acts and not
the fortuitous acts of the general contractor which are, as
has been said before, totally beyond his control«
Now, Mr. Chief Justice, you indicated some concern
about deterrence, as we are, and. we ere not here to defend or
approve•certainly what was done, but the deterrence does in
fact take place with the criminal sanction which was imposed

33
and can always be imposed by the statute«

and these two

gentlemen received a two-year jail sentence which .are -in the
stipulations which war© suspended? and as businessmen certainly
that is quite a serious deterrent.
QUESTION:

Congress in numerous statutes provided

ihsso kinds of deterrent civil penalties in vary large amounts.
MR. BALLANs

I think you*r© right, sir»

To my

knowledge.
QUESTIONs

Very often the civil penalty being much,

sruch greater than the criminal penalty? the dollar criminal
penalty»
MR. BALXANs

Well? we are dealing with this statute

and how it has been interpreted.

The petitioner has relied

heavily on Marcus v. Has», which is the only Supreme Court
decision to deal with the question of multipla forfeitures.
And in that case also there was a reduction, a minimization
of claims and of penalties, of forfeitures because the courts
haves been struggling with this ambiguous statute and have been
in each instance reducing them to a reasonable level and a
reasonable standard•
With respect to the double damages, may X just say
that in this instance the statute says double damages sustained
are to be charged against the subcontractor * these two individuals*
And may X suggest that there were no damages at all in this
case, that when the restitution was made, when the payment was

34
made by Model» the contractor, who never went after the
respondents herein, although, ha might have, or it might have,
when that payment was mad® of $1,6,000 to the Government, the
Government was rendered whole financially and economically.
QUESTION*

Suppos® 1 am hurt, in an automobile

accident, I incur $2,090 hospital bills as a proximate r@su.Xfe
of the negligence of the?, driver of the other car.

Now, if l

have hospital insurance 'that pays me off for that right away,
you wouldn’t say that I never sustained those damages, would
you, in dealing with th® tort-feasor?
MR. EALLAN;

No, 1 wouldn’t say that.

with the implication of your question.

I would agree

However, this is a

question of fraud, and X do think that when w@ are dealing
with a tort action or a negligence action, that th© proximat®
causes are certainly the responsibility of th© original tort­
feasor.

But-in this instance, with a fraudulent claim, with

fraud being charged to the respondents, X think they should
be charged only, and X think th,© statutes and th© eases indicate,
with their own acts of fraud.
QUESTION:

As a matter of principia, X would think

you would extend proximate cause further when you are dealing
with someone who defrauds than with someone who is merely
negligent.
MR. BALLAN?

Well, sir, Mr. Justic® Rshnquist, in

this case our problem is that the upper limits of that are

35
totally beyond our control sad do result in very unfair
consequences.

For example, this contract for which w® were

subcontractors was a $2 million contract.

There were, as the

Government pointed out, about, five or six component parts
in the sets that were sent out.

We provided a small part of one

of those five or six parts, namely, two tubas for each unit.
Mow, the total feliat we received was approximately
$13,000 or $16,000 I believe was what we received in payment.
Mow, we are unable to control the.ultimate or the
subsequent subdivision or multiplication by the general con­
tractor when he submits his invoices ~
QUESTXQNs

That3 a an argument on the forfeitures

point, but you are making an argument on th® double*damages
point.
MR. BALLANS

Well, on that I'm making a statutory

argument, sir, and 2*m referring to the rational® of the Klala
case which is the only circuit court decision on this matter,
and in that case they read the statute which does not provide
for when the doubling takes place, and they felt-that a rational
approach would be to fix the amount lost, if there is restitution
made, as it was in this case, to then subtract the difference
and then double..

And they came up with a figure indicating that

there was really no loss to the Government, it was miniscule.
If Model had not made restitution, had not paid
$18,000, then wo certainly would have been held accountable for

36

a doubling of the loss of $16»000 to $18»000 or namely?
$32»000 to $36»000»

But the payment was mads? there was no

loss sustained by th® Government except in its subsequent
prosecution of this matter.
X believe that th® rest has ba@n stated by say

MR. JONES:

Thank you» Mr» Chief Justice»

I just.wanted to address myself to th® argument that
•there is some difference between the revised statutes and th®
False Claims Act as codified in 31 U.S.C.

It seems to m&

there is no difference whatsoever in language or practical
effect.

In either case you look to determine whether that©

was a false claim»
it.

If so» you ask» did the subcontractor causa

If so» thsr® is a violation»

And in this case you look to

the second falsa claim» did the subcontractor cause it?
he did, toy his fraud»
QUESTIONs

Yes,

That was the second part of it.
What if you just look, though» to the

act of th© subcontractor as your opponents ar© suggesting and
say that what’s forbidden by R„S. 3490 is th® doing or th©
committing of the act.

Th® subcontractor’s act is single

in

37
submitting the thing to the prime.
MS. JOKES?

analysis is that til® doing or committing such act refers to the
acts described in 5438,, the acts described in 5438 were the
causing of falsa claim
QUESTION z

will be submitted.

OK j? hew many times did the subcontractor

in this case cause a false claim to be submitted?
MR. JONESs
QUESTION s

Thirty“five.
X would think you could, argue equally well

that he did it ono®.
MR. JONES?

Well* he argues that his fraudulent course

of conduct constituted a single causative act* and that's the
essence as I take it* of their argument»

It. seems to me that's

wrong for two reasons which interrelate.

On® is that w© have

h@r@ multiple acts.

If you are focusing upon the acts of the

respondent* we've isolated same 400-odd different fraudulent
acts.

On the other hand* if you are concerned with the act

as defined in the statute, that act is to cause the false claim,,
and“then it seems to me you have to look to determine whether a
falae claim was submitted* and if so* whether there were acts*
an act or acts* of the respondent that caused that submission.
In this case each on® of the false claims was — the submission
of each on© of the false claims was caused by respondents
within the intent* I taka it, of section 5438.
