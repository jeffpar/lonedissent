MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 75-312, Young, the Mayor of Detroit,
against American Mini Theatres.
Mrs. Reilly, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. MAUREEN P. REILLY
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MRS. REILLY:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

For the record, I am Maureen Reilly, Assistant

Corporation Counsel for the City of Detroit, representing
Coleman A. Young, Mayor of Detroit, and the department heads
who are petitioners in this matter.
The Court is asked this morning to review a decision
of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals which by a two-to-one
decision invalidated amendments to the city’s zoning and
licensing laws regulating adult businesses.

This case is now •

before the court ■•approximately eight years after the problem
first became apparent in the city of Detroit.
In 1969 there were only two of these new uses, land
uses, within the city, two adult book stores, two adult
theaters, and relatively few topless go-go bars.

Within a

period of thre© -yaars that number had changed so that there
were 18 adult theaters, 21 adult book stores, and 70 top 3-ess
bars.

Reports from th© Detroit Polio® Department iadicatsd

that these businesses had clustered together along the main

4
arteries of tb@ city of Detroit and were immediately adjacent
fco or backed up to neighborhoods, residential neighborhoods,
which were zoned residential.
Based on the complaints received by a number of
families, residents, and businessmen whose businesses served
those families, the Mayor recommended
zoning and licensing laws.

changes

in the city’s

Th® changes that were adopted

v;er© these;
The adult businesses were now designated as regulated
uses.

These were uses which had been determined by the

Council to be businesses which had a deleterious effect on the
surrounding neighborhood, which caused a downgrading in
property values and a deterioration of the neighborhood
generally.
QUESTION;

The category of regulated uses had b®@n

one that was part of the Detroit zoning pattern for many years,
hadn't it been there for some time?
MRS. REILLY;

Yes, your Honor.

The idea, the concept
•

i

1

!

of regulated uses so far as I know was a new concept of
inverse zoning adopted by the city in 1962.

The city found

out that certain uses when clustered together caused a down­
grading of a neighborhood.

QUESTION;

Pool halls and shoeshine

parlors and

Motels, bars, those businesses which

catered to transient type patrons.

'M

MRS. REILLYs

contrasted with a neighborhood patronage»
That's right, your Honor»

It seemed only proper that the adult businesses be
included in the regulated use category because they follow
the same pattern.

They cluster

together, they drew patrons

who were not members of the immediate neighborhood but from
the surrounding community, and had operational characteristics
which set them apart from other types of theaters and book
stores.
These theaters and book stores, which offered-- a
substantial portion of their stock in trad® or -their films
were sexually stimulating on the spot.

It was not like a

drugstore which would offer a pill and you go home and five
hours later you feel sexually stimulated.

Whether you walk

into the theater and watch the film on the screen or you walk
into the book store and review the material there, the immediata
.reaction was sexual stimulation.

I think this Court can

almost take judicial notice of that.
When these persons left the store, not only the
residents were aware of how they may have been sexually
stimulated, but prostitutes were aware of it and prostitutes
oegan coming into these areas.

It is a matter of record in

tie city of Detroit that in these areas where the adult
businesses were clustered, so-called massage parlors opened.
We have padlocked 12 massage parlors within the last few years,-

6
all of them in fch© area of the adult businesses.
I call them massage parlors, but in fact they were
fronts for houses of prostitution.. This is on® of th©
adverse effects which is caused by th® adult businesses,
particularly when they cluster together.

And this is on© of

the adverse effects that the families are concerned about
when they send th® women and th® children and some of th® man
who are concerned to th® business area which includes these
adult businesses.
In 1972 when, w® passed the ordinances, there was no
immediate reaction.

The people generally seemed to favor the

ordinances.

Early in 1973 we had our first test of th©

ordinances.

Th® respondents in this cas®, th© American

Mini Theatres, Inc., and Hortown Theatre, Inc., both opened
adult theaters in the City of Detroit in violation of the city’s
zoning regulations.
regulated

uses.

Both were within 1,000 feet of two other

In fact, th© Hortown was within 1,090 feat

off I believe, seven other regulated uses.
Neither adult business,the respondents, neither of
the respondents sought to obtain a waiver by th® neighboring
community.

Now, I recognize that th© provision in th© ordinance,

in fch© zoning ordinance requiring th® consent of 51 percent of
the persons living or doing business within 500 feet of fch®
location of the adult business is not directly before the Court
today, but I submit to your Honors that indirectly fch® provision
I

7
is before the Court»

If this Court accepts the decision of

fch® Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals that th© city may not
regulate adult businesses because by definition it refers to
the content of the material disseminated therein# then all of
the city’s regulations dealing with adult businesses will be
wiped out»
QUESTION;

That provision that you just told us

was not directly before the Court was what# invalidated by
the district court and you took no appeal# is 'that it?
MRS. REILLY;

W© took no appeal.

We amended th©

ordinance to correct th® deficiency pointed out by the trial
court.
QUESTION;

Later.

And that was after the district

court's judgment.
MRS. REILLY;

That's correct# your Honor.

When I

say that that provision is indirectly before th® Court# I s&y
that because it includes the same definition and it would be
wiped out.

Th© court r of used to allow7 th® provision that is

directly before the Court.
QUESTION;

If we should affirm fch® Court of Appeals

in other words# a fortiori th© other on® would be invalidated
in your submission.
MRS. REILLY:

That is correct# your.Honor.

The other point I wish to make is that this provision
needed by .Council and considered by Council because it

*

8

took into consideration the aspect of protecting the familias,,
the youth in the neighborhood.

And that8s why 1 ask this

Court not to ignore it, because the package was presented to
Council as one package to accomplish two ends -- to avoid
clustering in the neighborhood, in the business area that
served, and to insure the businessmen in the zoned business
district and the residents that they would continue to have .
a voice in the kind of. neighborhood that they lived in and
to insure their commitment to the neighborhood.

And this

provision, 51 percent provision, has to be at least considered
by the Court in the total picture teat we are trying to
present to tee Court today.
The respondents in this matter, th© two adult
theatres, who by the way admit that they are adult theatres
in their complaint in th® Federal district court and state
unequivocally that no minors were permitted, brought th© suit
in the Federal district court contending that their
constitutional rights under th® First and Fourteenth Amendments
w&re being violated.

I am sure the Court is aware that the

district court reversed th© rule that the provision

relating

to the 51 percent consent was ruled unconstitutional because#
th® Court said, it was too restrictive to accomplish the
legitimate interest sought to be accomplished by the city,
the reason being that the ordinance dealt with a particular
residential unit, when the court said we had shown that we

9
were attempting :o protect a neighborhood , and obviously a
single residential unit is not a neighborhood.

So that

ordinance was stricken because it was more restrictive than
necessary to accomplish our purpose.
The other provision of the zoning law relating to
the I,0QG~£cot restriction was upheld as being a legitimate
way of protecting the city's interest in allowing the
neighborhoods to remain stable and to protect -them in providing
an atmosphere in which the neighborhood, and the business
people would continue to live, in the neighborhood and —
QUESTIONi

Mrs. Reilly, does the amended ordinance,

within 500 feet of a residentially zoned district continue
that waiver provision of 51 percent?
MRS. REILLY %

If I understand you correctly, your

Honor, you ara asking that -~
QUESTION;

As I understand it, your initial

ordinance had that it could not be located within 500 feet of
a residential unit, unless the prohibition is.waived by the
consent of seme 51 percent of the persons living or doing
business within 5GO feet.

Nov; you have amended it to read

it can't be within 500 feet of a residentially zoned district.,
MRS. REILLYs
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

But may there also b<& the waiver by

consent of 51 percent?
MRS. REILLY:

Yes, your Honor, there is th© waiver.

10
Both prohibitions may b& waived.

Th© 1,000-foot prohibition

may be waived by What was the City Plan-

Commission, under

our new organisation it's a different department, but the
waiver still is allowed, and the 51 percent consent waiver is
still continued under the 500-foot restriction.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Reilly, you characterise this case

as a First Amendment case or something also?
MRS. REILLY:

I would hav© to characterise it as a

First Amendment case because of the issues raised.

It is fcha

petitioner's position, however, that the case • ‘Of U.S* v. 01ByIon
would be controlling, and we are asking this Court not to
apply an absolutist viewpoint on First Amendment rights to
this case.
QUESTION:

Are you trying to bring it within the

time-place exception?
MRS. REILLY:

Yes, your Honor.

It's our position

that even though w© look to the content of the material to
define the type of business which is causing the deleterious
effect, the regulations are not directed towards fch© content
of the material, they are directed toward the location of
commercial operations in order to avoid clustering and the
adverse affects that result from the clustering and to avoid
locating these kinds of businesses in neighborhoods where we 4
aro concerned about family values.

So in this sensa I am saying,

yes, First Amendment rights must be considered.

11
QUESTION

Could I ask you an© other question

now

that you are interrupted again?
On th© 1,000-foot part of th® ordinance, I take it
it means that the entrepreneur must know not only what he is
doing, he has to know what other people within that radius
are doing.

He has to determine that they are regulated uses

before he can undertake operations.
MRS. REILLY;

Is that correct?

That is correct, your Honor.

It's

a simple matter of going to the Community and Economic
Development Department in the City of Detroit and filing an
application or stating where he wishes to locate, and h@ will
fo© advised by that department of any other regulated uses
within 1,000 feet of th© proposed location.
QUESTION:

I suppose even without these regulations,

these kinds of establishments would have to hav© a license
of some kind.
MRS. REILLY;

Your Honor, 'the Class B cabarets arc

licensed both by th® State and by th® city.

Motion picture

theatres have traditionally been licensed within the city of
Detroit, and all theatres are subject to th® same licensing
provisions as th® nonadult theatres.

Book stores have not

traditionally been licensed in the city, and th© adult book
-

\

stores are not licensed.
QUESTION;

Do they hav© to got, an occupancy permit

or must they go to th© city government for any purpose at all?

12
Or do -they just go and open a book store?
MRS. REILLY s

No, the book store, lik© any other

commercial operation, must have a certificate of occupancy
which is required in order to check out th© health regulations.
QUESTION;

I see.

MRS. REILLYs

Going back to one of the points raised

by one of the Justices, th© question of whether or not First
Amendment rights, if this is a First Amendment case, I say,
yes, but I am asking on behalf of the petitioners that this
Court apply th® traditional balancing of interest test to the
case at th® bar.

In many cases decided by this Court recently,

the Court has looked to th® content of the material.

I g®t

the impression from the Fort Dix case that was announced today
that the Court said it is political material, but under the
circumstances, considering th® interest of th© State and
protecting th® military atmosphere in a camp -devoted, entirely
to military purposes, and balancing that with th© interest of
the persons who seek to disseminate their political views,
th® balancing results in a favorable position on'behalf of t):te­
state, that the State's interest is more important under this
situation.
This balancing of interest has been applied in
Ginsberg v..mw York ease where the Court said, "Material may
\

not b® obscene as to adults, but may be regulated as to minors»
Specific material dealing with sexual conduct, if appealing te

13
tli© prurient interests of the minors# it may be separated and
regulated even though it is not obscene and cannot b© totally
prohibited.”
The material xvhich we are discussing in the case at
bar is specifically defined and relates to specific sexual
conduct.

The definitions are quit© explicit.

In fact# when

the ordinance was presented to City Council our Council
president asked if it was permissible to discuss it at the
table# considering our anti-pornography ordinances.

W© are

dealing with a definition including specific sexual conduct
and specific sexual areas of th® body# not general ideas
relating to feelings, political, social, economic, so on.
The definitions are clearly tied into specific sexual conduct
in anatomical areas.
QUESTION:

But concededly, I take it, Mrs. Reilly,

some of the material so3.d would not fo® barred or could not fca
barred by the Stats under the Miller case and the Paris Adult
Theatre, that is, yon can’t call this simply

fch© City of

Detroit's efforts to deal with something, that could ho found
to be obscene.
MRS. REILLY:

That is correct, your Honor.

We are

not implying that the material is obscene because we recognise
the Court's decision that no material is technically pornographic
antil it has been found to be so by a judicial adversary
hearing.

The problem is that there is a groat amount of

14
material which nay or may not bts obscene, which, may bs hard
core, soft core, whatever, but it is all sexually stimulating,
and if that type of material is offered in a business, we hav©
the adverse effect existing from these types of businesses
whether or not the material is determined to be obscene»
QUESTION:

Don't you think your case would b© in a
\

somewhat weaker position if the Detroit City Council simply
said, "We don't like this kind of material so we are going to
limit the number of outlets," that is, put it on a straight
t

content basis rather than, as I understand

they did»saying,

"We don't like the consequences that com® in the wake of
places -that sell this material"?
MRS. REILLY:

Yes, your Honor, I think that is th©

key to this case, that we are not saying the material itself
is offensive.

We are saying that the operation of these types

of businesses causes adverse affects which infringe upon the
rights of th® neighboring citiaens, whether they be residents
or businessmen.

If we said only the material is offensive,

vra would have no right to prohibit th® sal® or dissemination
of that material without a judicial adversary hearing, because
this Court in Miller ruled that only obscene material may be
directly prohibited and then only after a judicial adversary
hearing.
QUESTION:

May X ask you this, Mrs. Reilly:

Is

there any claim ox any showing in this ease that th© effect

15
of this zoning ordinance is ultimately to limit, to put a
limit on the absolute number of these theatres and book stores
in the City of Detroit?

The purpose is dispersal, but is

there any claim that the effect is to actually limit the
number of them in th© city?
MRS. REILLYs
bean made at any time.

I do not recall that that claim has
Th© claim has been made that "We

don't know where to locate," and I said at th© district court
level I wasn’t about to point out th© places where they might
locat©, but th© zoning lav; is written in such a way that they
may locate anywhere where similar uses may locate in
business zoned districts more than 1,000 feet of two other
regulated uses.
QUESTIONS

But my question was whether th® effect

'was to make this ordinance tantamount to th© one that, my
brother Rehaquist hypothesized, i.e., to put an absolute
limit on th® number of these two kinds of establishments in
th® city»
MRS. REILLY;

There is no absolute limit, no

calling on the number of •—*
QUESTION:

I know there is no ceiling in th® words

of th® ordinance, but my question was whether there is any
claim that that was in fact what th© ordinance succeeded in
doing„
MRS. REILLY:

I do not believe that claim was made

16
at any point.
QUESTION;

If it is going to b© made, it's going to

be mad© here.
MRS. REILLY;

It may be made now.

That is why I

was carefully answering that.
QUESTIONs

Mrs. Reilly, are th© adult businesses

regulated exactly the same way that some of the other restricted
uses ar© regulated, such as bars and motels and pawn shops
and the like?
MRS. REILLY;

Yes, your Honor, in this way;

All tl.w

regulated uses ar© subject to th® 1,000-foot restriction.
Public entertainments!many of th© public entertainments in
the City of Detroit are also subject to th© 500-foot restriction.
QUESTION;

But in terms of the 1,000-foot restriction,

there is no distinction mad© in terms of location.
MRS,, REILLY:

In terms of location, no, except I

have to point out that the adult businesses are now subject
under our amended ordinance to th© 51 percent consent provision,
that the adult businesses may not locate withir 500 feat of'
\

a residentially zoned district.
The other regulated uses —
QUESTION:

That is not before us, though, is ife?

MRS. REILLY:

Mo, but you ar® asking m@ if they ar©

being treated the saraa, and I am saying th® bars under &
different law are also subject, to that 1,000-foot prohibition

17
I’m sorry, the 51 percent consent prohibition.

All regulated

Adult businesses were categorized

All regulated uses are subject to the

1,000-foot prohibition.
QUESTION:

And is that waivable?

MRSo REILLY;
Plan

That may be waived by th© City

Commission.
QUESTION:

But not by the immediate residents.

MRS. REILLY:

No, that is a separate restriction

which only applies to bars, adult businesses, which we

IS
consider to be entertainment,# and certain other types of
entertainment in the city.

Those are listed in section 5*-,?>„L

in Ordinance 743.
QUESTION:
to what?

Now, the 500-foot, that waiver applies

The 51 percent.
MRS. REILLY;

The 51 percent consent of the

surrounding neighborhood applies to the 500-foofc restriction,

QUESTION;

Applicable only to the adult business?

MRS. REILLY;

Adult businesses,, bars, and certain

public entertainments listed in section 5-2-1.
QUESTION;

Any other kind of a movie, I take it,

any other kind of a theater, could be located right next to
a residential zone or two theaters could be located right
next to each other if they aren’t in this category.
MRS. REILLY;

I believe theaters may b© permitted

53-3 zones, and those zones would become less restrictive.
QUESTION;

They could be right up against a

MRS. REILLY;

And they could be next to each other.

MRS. REILLY:

Yes.

Yes.

QUESTIONS

But all moving picture theaters are

MRS. REILLY:
licensed.

All moving picture theaters are

All licensed in the same way, th® same kind of

restrictions.
QUESTION:

I take it, or have you suggested, that

one of the purposes of these restrictions is to maintain
property values, like zoning sometimes is aimed at that.
MRS. REILLY:

It is very definitely directed to

preserve property values, yes, your Honor.
QUESTION:

But that comes also through what you

discussed earlier, maintaining the kind of values for a
residential area where people want to live and have their
children brought up.
MRS. REILLY:

Provide a suitable atmosphere for th®

raising of children, yes,
QUESTION:

It’s an environmental problem which has

an incidental impact on property values, is -that not a fair
I

way to say it?
MRS. REILLY:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

They didn't set out in the first place

to try to hold up property values? they set out to try to,
as you describe it in your briefs, they set out- to try to
preserve a decent environment in th© city and on® of th®
consequences of that is it will also help th® property values.

20

MRS, REILLY;
QUESTION:

That's correct, your Honor,

Thank you,

I'm afraid we haven't given you very much

time to argue what you have in mind.

I think w@ should reach

the charge that this ordinance is vague and overbroad.

For

example, the language with respect to book stores refers to
stores that, have a substantial or significant part of their
•stock in trad® within the scop© of the definition.

What

response do you hav® to that?
MRS. REILLY;

Well, of course;, it's our position,

that the ordinances ar© quite specific.

We have had to us©

relative terms in the definition of book stores because it's
©xtremely difficult to say if a store has ©ven 9 percent of
its stock in trade to be adult, that does not make it. adult,
but SO percent would make it adult.
term "substantial."
by this Court.

So w@ used a relative

That word has been used time and again

In fact I think it's used in U.S. v. O'Brien

talking about a substantial or compelling governmental interest.
Even though the term is relative, it is not vagu®. This Court
has looked at many relative terms# at or near a courthouse,
interfere with th® administration of justice# words such -as
that that were discussed in 1 Earneron v, Louislana- -tlm Cameron
c a a e ~ ~ Cox v, Lou i s i an a..

And this Court has said that you

cannot always have mathematical certainty.
QUESTION:

But who determines substantiality with

respect to a particular store?

21
MRS. REILLY;

Well, the department which now controls

the zoning ordinances, th© Community and Economic Development
Administration, would make that determination.
QUESTION;

Is there any provision for an. administra­

tive hearing to make that determination?
MRS. REILLY;

Your Honor, under our Michigan court

rules, a person may go into court and within four days have
a decision of an administrative body reviewed, and if there
is not substantial evidence — again the word substantial *—
evidence on the record to support that determination, th®
court, may interfere with th© administrative decision and
overturn it.
There is a review body or Board of Zoning Appeals,
which reviews all decisions that are protested which are made
by the Community and Economic Development Department.

So

there is an inhouse review available in the administration of
the city and there is court review available on four days
notice.
QUESTION;
classification?

Mrs. Reilly, how permanent is th®

In other words, if a theater shows on® adult

performance or a book store has for a period of time an
inventory of adult books.

Is it then permanently prohibit©:!

use, or whatever the proper term is, or does it change as the
operation changes?
MRS. REILLY:

Under the zoning law, if a use, say an

22
adult us®, and then ceases to he an adult use for six months,
then it ceases to have the restrictions upon it, or the
benefits, if it's a nonconforming adult us©, say, which was
existing before our ordinance and it closed down for six months
or changed its fare for six months, then it would no longest
be considered an adult us© and no longer b© considered a
nonconforming use.

And if it then wished to become an adult

business, it would have to go through whatever th© rules are
applicable to starting a brand new business.

There is a

six months time period on it.
I would like to reserve whatever time I hav© for
rebuttal.

You say you raised, it?
Yes, your Honor, in th® lower court.

I don’t believe, however, that it was decided on that issue,
and it clearly was not decided on that issue in th© Sixth
Circuit Court of Appeals.

It was decided on the equal

protection basis.
Now, again, with regard to the definition of an
adult book store, per se, the term .is defined as a book store
having a substantial or significant portion of its stock in
trade.

What is substantial cr significant portion?

How does

on® measure that kind of term?
QUESTION;

Does this sto^e advertise itself as an

24
adult book store?

MR. TAYLOR;

Of course, w© are dealing with an

adult thaafcer, but assuming we ware talking about an adult
book store, yes, it probably would identify itself as an adult
book store.

However ~

QUESTION;

Isn't that a pretty good definition then?
Your Honor, I would beg to differ with

MR. TAYLOR;

you on this basis, taking the definition as it stands, that
could apply to virtually any kind of a book store selling any
kind of material, because we don't know where th® line is to
b© drawn.

That is to say, ir„ th© area of First Amendment

rights, if precision of regulation is a touchstone, there is
no way of knowing at what point a book store passes that line
from adult to nonadult.

So though it may b© true some book

stores advertiso themselves as adult book stores, as that
term is used, whatever that tana means, it nevertheless could
apply potentially to any kind of a book store.

On th© same

basis if wo took a look at a definition of a motion picture
tkssifcor, "an enclosed building used for presenting material, *
well,that doesn't tell us whether that is on© film for two
hours? it doesn’t tell us whether that is on® film for on® v/aok
or for six weeks or six films for, shall w© say, two weeks
apiece.

In other words, again w® have th© same problem.

don’t know

at. what point that line is drawn.

QUESTION;

There is no question about the adult

We

25
theater, is there?
MR. TAYLOR5
QUESTXOHs

Pardon?
There is no question, ambiguity about what

an adult theater is because I understand it was agreed that
you didn’t let minors in.
MR. TAYLORs

That would b® correct, your Honor, but

on the same basis —
QUESTION;

Well, that makes it an adult theater,

doesn’t it?
MR. TAYLOR:

If that be the basis that the city

stands on, but we don’t know that, then w© could simply say
that any R rated film as rated by the Motion Picture
Association —
QUESTION:

You made the admission that you excluded

everyone but adults.
MR. TAYLOR:
QUESTION:

That would be correct, your Honor,
So that ergo is an adult theater.

MR. TAYLOR:

That is correct, insofar as the Nortown

Theatre goes, that would b© correct.
QUESTION;

However, again —

That isn’t in the definition of the

zoning ordinance is it?
MR. TAYLOR:
QUESTION:

Pardon?
I am looking at the ordinance on page 81

of the petition for writ of certiorari.
MR. TAYLOR:

Yes, your Honor,

Might I direct you

26
to page 66 of the appendix, or petition for writ of certiorari.
QUESTION;
MR. TAYLOR?
your Honor.

Appendix H» beginning on page 80.
I believe that's a different ordinance»

SO, that is the licensing ordinance for adult
Th@ same definition, that would be correct.

QUESTION;
MR. TAYLOR;
QUESTION;
MR. TAYLOR;
QUESTION;

Sam© definition.
Right.

Used for presenting material.

It's the same definition.
Yes, your Honor.
And that doesn’t say anything there about —

there is nothing in that definition, or that definition is
certainly not confined to a theater that does not admit minors.
MR. TAYLOR;
QUESTION;
MR. TAYLOR;

That is correct.
It’s in quit® different language.
Yes, your Honor, that is correct, and

that's the point, we don't know at what point a theater
becomes an adult theater, in accordance with this definition.
Now, if I might turn to the definition of the material
QUESTION;

I mean, a theater that did not admit

minors would not be an adult theater within this per se under
this ordinance, would it?
MR. TAYLOR:

problem.

Your Honor,we don't know.

It doesn't define it in those terms.

That's the
It doesn't

«ay that a thaatar which does not admit minors thereby 1b an
adult theater, if that is what your Honor is getting at.

No,

21
it does not.
QUESTION:

I can’t conceive of a theater that doesn’t

want paying customers.

If they exclude paying customers, there

must be son© reason.
MR. TAYLOR:

That may fos true, your Honor.

Possibly

because —
QUESTION:

Well, let’s put it; this way.

Is the

fact that the theater itself restricts itself to a minor pi®c®
of evidence that can b© considered as to whether or not it is
an adult theater?
MR. TAYLOR:

Again, my answer to that would to© no,

because there are many theaters which based upon the particular
movie which would come to that particular theater at a
particular time would exclude minors.

We don’t know whether

that theater -then would be an adult theater.
Now, if I might turn to the definition -QUESTION:

You ar® not claiming the ordinance is

vague as applied to your clients. You ar© going to make an
you
overbreadth analysis and/claim standing to assert the claim
on soma other -business establishment.
MR. TAYLOR:

No, your Honor, we ar© claiming that it

is vague as applied to my client, not in this context, but in
another context which I was just getting to.

And also not

only as applied, but as written, not only to this particular
theater but to all theaters.

28
QUESTION:

Is there any doubt about the fact that

this ordinance applies to the businesses operated by your
client?
MR. TAYLOR:

Again, w© have conceded we do show

materials of a sexual natur©.

So if that b® the definition,

which is what w@ will get into in a moment, yes, this ordinance
then would, apply to the Nor town Theatre.
QUESTION:

So you are really asserting that it’s

vague as applied to other us©s different from those put on
by your own clients.
MR. TAYLOR:

I am also assarting that it's vague

both as applied to my client and to other uses.
Now, if I might get into the next point, the
ordinance defines the term "material" as material distinguished,
or characterised by and emphasis on matter, and then goes
into the definition of the particular matter.

Might I point

out to the Court again we have tha same problem.

We don’t

know at what point the material is distinguished or characterised
by and emphasis upon.

What specifically does that mean?

Hew

much of the material, what percentage of the material has to
be of a sexual nature and anatomical content, if you like,
before it passes that line between nonadult and adult?
So then we have again the same problem with vagueness.
If I might turn to the next
taken, that is

position that we have

on the question of overbreadth.

Now, as we

29
have said, it is our position that fch© ordinance is vague as
far as those definitions go, hut might I point out to fch®
Court, with regard to fch© definition as to specific sexual
conduct or specific anatomical areas that this ordinance
applies to, it is quit© specific.

However, it defines that

material in that context in a way which clearly goes beyond
the restraints of that expression, that is to say obscenity.
t

The ordinance goes far beyond permissible restraints on
obscenity, and this is conceded by fch® petitioners in this
matter.

There is no question about this.■ Not only does it

go beyond permissible restraints on obscenity, but it
differentiates between materials which are protected -materials
which are adult and which are not adult.
QUESTION:

Mr. Taylor, do you think that the City of

Detroit could hav© said in an ordinance that regulated uses
such as those conducted by your client and,pool halls and other
regulated, could not b® established within 600 feet of an
elementary school?
TAYLOR:

Your Honor, I think that would depend

upon the interest asserted by the City of Detroit.
QUESTIONS

What if chey had asserted the interest

that they don't want elementary school students coming and going
from the school to be exposed to those kind of uses.
MR. TAYLOR:

My answer to fch© Court would be, no,

based upon fch® definitions laid out her® by this ordinance and

so
the way this ordinance is written.

I would suppos®* and I have

to speak to your Honor off the top of ray head

in th© s@ns©

that it is not the question that is before th© Court.

It may

be possible for th© city to do exactly what your Honor is
saying, but they can’t do it in this way and that is not the
intent of this ordinance , nor the purpose nor th© ©££@ct of
•this ordinance.
QUESTIONS

Weil, I realise that.

I was asking a

hypothetical.
MR. TAYLOR;
hypothetical question.

Y<as, your Honor, I understand the
I think the city would have a difficult

time justifying that kind of ;m ordinance unless there was
3ora© indication of an actual thrusting or viewing upon children,
in other words, some indication that there was
material reaching the children.

s©rr«u of the-,

Simply to say, which in

essence is exactly what the city is saying — this, I think, is
on© of the basic questions and the essence, the question of
overbreadfch, the question of justification, the interests
asserted by th® city.

What are- those interests' that th® city

asserts?
The city assarts an interest in protecting its
neighborhoods, in preserving -she values, if you like,
coraminiiy living, all of which simply

exist ir th® abstract.

Pin®, and there is without a doubt an interest

has a valid interest in that.

and the city

But let’s fcak© a look for a

31
moment, if wo can, from feha abstract abstraction of til®
interest to fell© concreto bases for ths interest.

The City of

Detroit has said as a basis, and has filed som© affidavits by
a professor, and they have said that there ar© certain
characteristics which because of their very nature cans©
deleterious effects.

Yet they never mention what thos©

specific effects are.
I might point out to fchs Court this ordinance takes
effect at the inception of the operation of a theater or the
book store.

Shat is to say there is no theater or book storo

showing adult material, they have to request, the book store
and theater have to request a waiver in essence in the case of
the Nortown, a waiver of the standards in order to operate as
an adult theater.
The City of Detroit says that ther© are certain
interests, there is a basis for this interest, and they submit
affidavits upon which they base their interests.

If we look

at th© affidavits, what they really say is that people object
to th© materials coming into their area.

They have a concept

in their mind, a preexisting notion in -their minds, if you
like, that they don’t like the material, because they don’t
like it, they view the area as going down, they thereby a®11
their proparty, or they don't take care of their proparty,
the property goes down and brings in other people who don’t
keep it up

32
Now, this is no more than what this Court has —
QUESTION;

You are just drawing on generalities.

Thar© is nothing in the record about what you ar© saying now,
is there?
MR. TAYLOR;

Your Honor, to the contrary, th®r@ is

a professor, which is th® basis of the ordinances.

This is

We base our ordinance

on this.
QUESTION;

I am talking about your generalities.

As a result of that people let their property go down.

Did

property?
MR. TAYLOR;

As a matter of fact, your Honor, in

his affidavit h© says specifically that whether it is true or
that property is going clown, they act as if it is going

And therefore, since they will act it, than

as a basis for these ordinances.
QUESTION;

What th® city is doing.

Do you suggest, is it your case that an

.adult theater may be located in any zone in which a nonadult

33
theater could be located?
MR. TAYLOR;

Yes, your Honor.

W® are saying that

there is virtually no reason, no basis, no rationale ~
QUESTION;

I take it that in Detroit they have six

business zones, B-l through B-6?
MR. TAYLOR;
QUESTION;

That is my understanding.
I fcak© it on the face of the ordinance

where it recites that adult theaters ar© not permitted in B-l,
B~2, or B-3 zones, although other theaters ar©.
MR. TAYLOR;

No, your Honor, I beiiev© other

theaters are not permitted in B-l, 2, and 3, and adult
theaters are not permitted in B-3, 4, 5, and 6, though
other theaters are.

So then; is a difference based upon th©

content of the material intended to be disseminated.
QUESTION;

You would think that general prohibitio»

weald fall if you win this case, not just th® 500 or 1,000-foot,.
MR. TAYLOR;

No, your Honor, our position

is that

our theater or any theater or book store should b® treated no
differently than any other theater or book store*
QUESTION;

Then yon should answer my question y@s.

Your kind of theater or your kind of book store should be
able to b© located in any zone in which an ordinary theater --

MR * TAYLOR;
QUESTION;

That is correct.
Should a pool hall, under your

constitutional theory, b© able to be located in any zoning

34
district where a grocery store could be located?
MR. TAYLOR;

There may be a difference fcher®, your

Honor, but 'the difference is that a pool hall is not in and
of itself protected.

For instance, a theater, may I point

out to th© Court, that you can't show a film without a motion
picture theater*

If you stop the operation of a theater, you

stop th© showing not only of a particular film, but all
films which would b® shown at that theater.
QUESTIOH;

But what if the city says pool halls and

adu.lt theaters produc® exactly the same consequences, attract
adults, kind of a seedy class of adults in th© eyes of th© city ,
and we simply want to confine them or limit th®
at which they are located together.

closeness

Why can't the city do

that?
MR. TAYLOR;

Th® city may be able to do 'that, but

would have to comia tip with a concrete justification which would
be, I might add, more than me rely the city doesn't like tha people
who com® to the theater because they, assum® something is going
on in th® theater, which is exactly what counsel has com© up
with just now

in this interest.

They assum® that the people

are sexually excited and therefore they say this kind of tiling
we don't want.
QUESTION:

But ther© is soma evidence in the record,

isn't there, that prostitution tends to follow these types of
operations and that th© city was concerned not about just the

35

consequences when a neighborhood took on the characteristics»

Your Honor, on®, there has been no

Ho.

There is

What th® city has said

is that there are massage parlors which cause th®s© problems,

Yet you will note the massag© parlors

MR. WESTON;

No.

In this case,your Honor, unlike

the theater owned by respondent Nortown, we had not been an
operational theater prior to the time of th® promulgation of
the amended ordinance.
QUESTION;

I see.

MS. WESTON;

Nortown apparently had foaen a theater

for some 40 years and -then changed policy subsequent to th®

We ware an incipient theater, if th@

fenat notwithstanding th® suggestion and possible implication of
Mr. Justice Relinquish earlier in my colleague3s argument, that

The definitions under

this ordinance are not the Killer definitions, nor is there
any question that we are not dealing with material which has
previously bean found under procedural safeguards to

So we are dealing hers with absolutely presumptively

protected speech, and we resist and resent the attempt on th©
part of petitioners to try to deal with disseminaters and

How far loss your argument go?

QUESTION:

Why isn't that a violation of the First

MR. WESTON:

Because what we are saying is that there

is an inability constitutionally on th© part of a municipality
or other form of government to discriminate against theaters
on th© basis of content where that material is entitled to
presumptive protection considerations, as these materials are.
No theaters is one thing,, just

There may well be instances

where there is no speech which may be tolerated under certain

QUESTION;

Why would you say that a single family

residential zone is sustainable if it excludes pool halls and
theaters from it, for example?

What is the interest that

supports that.exclusion?
MR. WESTON;

Well, ;.t would seem, your Honor, and

particularly in light of th® recent decision in this Court in
the Belle Terre case, that there ar© interests which are
supportable constitutionally in a municipal area.

What ar© they?

That's what I am asking.

I suppose th© language of the Court is

clear, to preserves a certain environment, to help the environment,
to protect fch® envirionment.
QUESTION:

Because of th© consequences of having th®

commercial establishments there.
MR. WESTON:

Potentially, yes, your Honor.

But the

fact that the term zoning and concepts inherent in zoning is
superimposed on soma sort of scheme no more confers fcalissmanic
immunity from constitutional scrutiny than any oth@r such

MR. WESTON:

Your Honor, it may be under some

circumstances which are not present in this case and which are.
not present in. the record which we have before us that there
may be a specific entity, a specific theater, a specific work
which in light of th@ legitimate and compelling interests of
the city may in fact b© regulated, as under any form of speech
where appropriate, specific, particular questions are raised
with regard to it.

There is nothing unconstitutional, for

There may well be a

We do not have this in this case.

That is correct, your Honor.
Suppose you didn’t have the limitation

but rather that the 1,000- and 500-foot limitation should apply

42
to all theaters.
MR. WESTOM:

In that case,-your Honor, certainly the

question of equal protection in light of First Amendment
activities making discrimination on th© basis of content would

MR. WESTON:

No, your Honor.

You sea, that's the

by an attempt to exclude theaters where, for example, other

You don't exclude them.

You simply say

that theaters have to b©, without regard to whether they are
adult theaters or not, no theaters can be closer than 1,000
feet to each other, nor bios©-than 500 feet to a residential

district.
MR. WESTONs

Yes, your Honor.

In that sense that,

would eliminate the content-based equal protection discrimination
of which we complain most strongly.

It would not necessarily

eliminate the fact that there may well b© able to be, under
■the zoning laws, 97 gas stations which are allowed to proliferate
near on© another.
QUESTION;

It9s a classification problem, then,

without First Amendment —
MR. WESTON:

Without the same compelling First

Amendment, yes, your Honor.
QUESTION;

Now, th© Bell® Terr® case involved First

Amendment factors, did it not?
MR. WESTON;

There were some implicit there, yes,

your Honor, but the Court
QUESTION:
MR.WESTON:

That is with association.
Yes, your Honor.

But th® Court was very

specific in that in noting that it was not a fundamental right
involved there and consequently th® strict scrutiny test was
not required.

In this case,

though, it is conceded by all

parties that this is an ordinance which directly on its face
purports to regulate First Amendment activities; on th© basis
cl. contentthat it involves a fundamental situation and
consequently th® strict scrutiny test must to© applied.

And

' t is our position, and in this sens© we differ somewhat with

44
the Court of Appeals# because# of cours©# we agree that the
discrimination# the distinctions that are made in th® ordinance
cannot stand under equal protection.

However# w® disagree with

with the Court of Appeals# because w© do not concede that the
City of Detroit has a legitimate# no less compelling interest
in the ordinance and the purposes of the ordinance which they
have set up.
Now# let me be very clear about that.

W@ ar@ not

saying that th® City of Detroit does not hav® a legitimate
interest in trying to maintain nie© neighborhoods and a fin®
place in which for th® citizens to llvo and maintaining th©
property values and a lovely area for children in which to
be raised.

But that5s like analyzing an ordinance in terms

of th© interest, by saying the purpose of it is to do good.
It appears that we must be more precise in our analysis of
what the ordinance is.

And looking at it with more precision#

we submit that the purpose of that ordinance is to prevent
clustering of adult theaters based on th® question of content,
ora the basis of th© undifferentiated fears of some psopl© or
some dominant interest in the community that bad things will
happen
QUESTIONS

Is it your position that content may not

be a standard at all or can it sometimes guide the zoning?

QUESTION:

Then no differentiation on th© basic test.

MR. WESTOH:

Certainly, as an abstract proposition,

m© that those issues, Mr. Justic® Stevens, w®r« really dealt

case, then less intrusive regulation on First Amendment rights
may be adopted to protect against those specific, not generalized;
%

46
not undifferentiated —
QUESTIONS You are saying it's OK to look at content
only for the purpose of protecting juveniles, but there is no
such showing made her®.
MR. WESTON;
all.

No, your Honor, 1 am not saying that at

I am saying that -QUESTION;

I thought you said you could avoid the

advertising outside the theater that would attract the
juveniles.
MR. WESTON;

No.

What I am suggesting is this;

I recognise, for example, that the Erancznik opinion is limited
to some extent in that obsceno material on the outside of a
billboard, or, for example, material which might not be
obscene for adults but which perhaps might be harmful matter
for juveniles, stronger material, than was involved in Ersaosnik
might bs by appropriate legislation or coning limited so that
it could not b© exposed to juveniles in this 600-foot
circumstance from schools.
What I am saying, however, is that content of the
theater, content of films or books sold in the theater or book
sboro which are not• .exposed to juveniles, which are not preseat,
in this factual circumstance, such as you said, in the absence
of a very specific record which I really, frankly,cannot even
imagine, may not bs discriminated against on the basis of
content.

That; is the positipr which

i-m

assert.

47
QUESTION:* Mr. Weston, supposing instead of Detroit
this were Dodge City 50 years ago and they enacted an
ordinance that no movie showing Western films could be within
1,000 feet of another on® because th© cowboys came in on
horses and they just couldn't accommodate all the horses if
the theaters were too close together.

Would you say there

was something wrong with that?
MR. WESTON:

Your Honor, on the basis of the flat

assertion that the Court just mads, I would say that there
would simply have to be a strong showing that theaters
exhibiting Westerns somehow attracted mors horses, I suppose,
let alone anything else.
QUESTION:

Suppose there was that kind of a showing.

MR. WESTON:

Your Honor, it would appear that in the

absence of a compelling State interest in the preservation of
the streets any more than an interest which this Court has
ruled insubstantial to prohibit the distribution of handbills
in the name of littering would simply not be appropriate to
justify discriminating against presumptively protected
disseminators of speech — or dissemination of presumptively
protected speech on th© basis of conduct.

And I would without

question exhort this Court not. to remove that bulwark in the
American Constitution.
QUESTION:

Could you have any difficulty with a

soning ordinance that provided that there must be a parking

48

lot within 50 feet of every theater with parking spaces at
a ratio of one car for every two seats in the theater, nothing
to do with the First Amendment, just to keep the cars off the
streets.
MR» WESTON?
QUESTION?

1 understand, your Honor.
Do you have any problem with that?

MR, WESTON:

I would certainly — without talking

about discriminatory enforcement, on its face that certainly
becomes much more like O'Brien where the ordinance involved
is not — ordinance or statute is not speaking directly to
limit First Amendment rights, and I think at that point then
counsel's 08Brian analysis would obtain, whereas in this case
it seems totally misplaced whatsoever.
QUESTION:

Very well.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mrs. Reilly.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. MAUREEN P. REILLY
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MRS. REILLY?

Thank you, your Honor.
r

I would like to taka the remaining moments to respond
to some of the comments made by counsel for respondents.
In response to on® of the question by on© of the
Justices, I was given the impression, and I am fearful maybe
some of the Justices wore, that the adult businesses may not
locate in the same business districts as othar nonadult
businesses of the similar type.

That is not so.

The adult.

49

theaters may locate in zones B-4, B-5, and 3-6, just as a
nonadult theater may locate in those zones, unless they are
faced with the 1,000-foofc restriction or the 50Q-foot
restriction.
QUESTION:

A nonadult theater could b© side by side

with an adult theater.
MRS. REILLY:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

The 1 ,G0C-foot distance has to be between

two adult theaters.
MRS. REILLY:

Two regulated uses, which include other

than the adult theaters.
The second point is —
QUESTION:

But aren't there some areas in which adult

theaters may not locate that other theaters may?
MRS. REILLY:

Only if it's subject to these two

restrictions that I mentioned, the l,00C-£oot or the 500-foot.
Otherwise they are treated th® same as a regular theater.
QUESTION:

As far as general zoning goes.

MRS. REILLY:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Right.

MRS. REILLY:

The point has also been raised by

counsel in oral argument and in his brief that we did not ssoscs
massage parlors.

I think the answer to that is rather obvious.

Massage parlors arc legitimate business operations, as are
health clubs, spas, and so on.

It is only when they are fronts

50
for prostitution that they create a problem.
QUESTION;

Well, pool halls and

shoeshine parlors

and motels and hotels are presumptively legitimate operations,
too.
MRS. REILLY;

Yes, your Honor, but the massage

parlors, th® legitimate massage parlors have not created the
problem that pool halls, bars, and so on hav© created.

It's

only those massage parlors which are fronting as houses of
prostitution which hav© created a problem, and clearly w© do
not intend to aone them.
QUESTION:

You padlock them.

MRS. REILLY;

We padlock them, put them out of

business entirely.
On© of the Justices raised the question whether it
would be feasible to limit all theaters under th© 500-foot
and the 1,000-foot restricticn.

Our problem with that is that

we feel that if wa did that, then fch© nonadult theaters would
claim that the ordinance applied to them was overbroad because
there are no adverse effects from their operation, therefore,
they should not be restricted.

They would claim First.

Amendment rights and claim that th© city's ordinance unnecessarily
restricted their location and their operation.
not included all theaters.

And so w© hav©

We included: under -the ordinances

only those th©afc@rs which hav© b@@n shown to causes deleterious
effects in th© neighborhood.

51
QUESTION:

X suppose a theater if it's large enough

can cause what might be considered adverse effects in a
neighborhood by bringing a lot of traffic and a lot of noisy
people late at night.

Isn't that true?

MRS. REILLY s
QUESTION:

Yes , your Honor , but that —

And © lot of non-neighborhood people.

MRS. REILLY:

If it; creates a nuisance in the

neighborhood, then the nuisance may b© enjoined. Whatever the
operation or effects caused by the large theater are, then
the city might go into court and ask that those operational
effects as to congestion of traffic and so on be enjoined as
to that specific theater and those specific operational
characteristics.
QUESTION:

But that's not an exercise of police

power of zoning, is it?
MRS. REILLY:

No, your Honor, that relates to a

specific nuisance problem.
QUESTION:

It's just an ad hoc nuisance.

MRS. REILLY s
QUESTION:

There» is law in the City of Detroit —

But 1 assume, for instance, that's the

reason you exclude from residence A districts and from
commercial B-l and 2 and 3 all theaters.
MRS. REILLY:
QUESTION:

That s correct, your Honor.

Because of the -affect.

MRS. REILLY:

And the parking problem is treated by

52
ordinance in the city.

There are requirements as to the number

of parking spaces which must be made available for a theater
having a certain number of seats.

But that applies to all

theaters regardless of the type,
QUESTION:

That’s the regular off-street parking

ordinance.
MRS, REILLY:

Yes, your Honor,

If -there are no further questions -MRS. REILLY:

Just so I get it straight, on page 86

of the petition for writ of certiorari there is that whereas
recital in the third full paragraph that says, "Whereas, adult
motion picture theaters., adult mini motion picture theaters,
adult book stores and Group D cabarets ar© not permitted in
B-l, B-2, or 3-3 zoned districts and ar© only permitted

with

the approval of th© City Plan Commission in B-4, B-S, and B~5.’
I take it from what you say, that no theaters ar©
permitted in B-l, B-2, and B-3.
MRS. REILLY:
QUESTION:

That is correct, your Honor,

So that this recital is true but it3a

also true of all theaters.
MRS. REILLY:

That’s correct.

It did not

go far

enough to explain that it does include all theaters.
Thank you, your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Thank you, gentlemen .

Thank you., Mrs. Rsilly.
