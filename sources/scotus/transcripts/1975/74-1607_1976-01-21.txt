MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*.

We will hear arguments

next in 1607, Hughes against Alexandria Scrap Corporation.
. Lord, you may proceed whenesver you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY R. LORD ON BEHALF
OF APPELLANTS
MR. LORD:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

The plaintiff here, a Virginia corporation, has

attacked successfully up until this moment before a threejudge court on equal protection and commerce clause grounds
a subpart o:: a single aspect of Maryland's enlightened cind
comprehensive program unique in the nation for

removing

from the highways and junk yards of the State blighted
automobiles.
Tha operative facts here, although somewhat dreary
and inelegant, are nonetheless quite important to a full under­
standing of the program and of the constitutional claims, at
least in our view, are relatively simple, despite the fact
that the appellee here has filed a 40-page statement of the
case.
1 would like to taka 5 minutes to touch on those
facts.
This program originated as a result of a careful
study made in 1967 by the Legislative Council of Maryland of
fch© very problem that I described a minute ago.

The Council

4
report is in the record, and I think a reading of it will
indicate the attention that was given to the problem.

The

Council recognized that hulks accumulated on the lots of
automobile wreckers throughout the State

largely because

the free market mechanism at 'that time provided very little
financial incentive to wreckers to place these vehicles in
the hands of scrap processors for recycling.

Accordingly, a

three-part program with both carrot and stick aspects was
adopted in 1969.
Part I requires all wreckers to be licensed and it
limited the wreckers in the way they maintained their yards.
There were density requirements and stacking requirements as
to heights of vehicles so that inspection could bs done more
readily and also so that the blight would not be as obvious
from the roads.
QUESTION;

Mr. Lord, it might help soma if you could

raise the microphone a little bit.
MR. LORD;

Now, oufc-of-State processors were also

licensed for the first time.

In fact, the 1969 statute

provided that wreckers had to be 'resident in the State’ of
Maryland to b© licensed, but processors, such as the plaintiff,
could be licensed no matter where they operated, it being
recognised that an out-of-State processor could contribute just
as well to solving the environmental problem of Maryland by
removing these hulks from the highways.

5
Now, as far as an oufc-of-State processor is concerned,
the licensing requirements were and are identical»
they must have the same sort of equipment»

Same fee,

The equipment I

think was described in an article which is in the record but,
very quickly, a processor's equipment must include a hydraulic
bailer which is known in the trade as a goldfinger machine
it reduces an automobile to a 2 by 2 by 5 foot bail - ■■ or a
shredder, or what is known as shears»

That plus payment of

the fee plus maintaining at least a nominal office in the
Stata, although records don't have to be kept there, and
compliance with other rather rudimentary Maryland regulations
admit an out-of-State processor to the Maryland program.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Lord, this is a distinction, then,

between the wrecker who must h© a resident and a processor
who may or may not be a resident, is that correct?
MR. LORD:

That's correct.

QUESTION;

What, does the wrecker do that a processor

MR. LORD:

A wrecker, your Honor, is a person who

dcesn*t?

takes possession of hulks of automobiles, holds them for
resale for the value of all of the wreck or of the parts.

And

I think it’s fair to say that a wrecker is vary often the
source of hulks to clients such as my brother represents her®
today, the processor.
one of several.

They are the source to the processor.

6

I suppos© that

the next equal protection case w©

will have to defend is on© based on that distinction, but
that distinction doesn5t happen to be before this Court.

We

have already had one equal protection challenge, and I will
come to that in a minute.
Suffice it to say that Alexandria qualified and was
licensed.

So that8s part 2 of th© program.
Part II is tli© stick aspect, and that is that there

is a continuing fine assessed against a wrecker who maintains
in his possession for more than a on@~y©ar period a vehicle
mors than 10 years old.

So it becomes economically a liability

to him to keep it there, encouraging him to move it off to a
processor.

So ifc#s really encouraging commerce, at least in

this aspect.
Now, the third facet is the carrot.
the bounty.

The carrot is

Th© bounty is payable; if a licensed wrecker is

involved, half to th© licensed wrecker delivering the hulk,
half to th© processor.

In th© ©vent that there is no licensed

wrecker, if some other source has brought th© vehicle abandoned
in Maryland to the processor, th® entire $16, which is the
current total, although it's varied over the years, is paid
to th® processor.

Ites an extra bonus, in effect, for ridding

Maryland of another hulk vehicle.
QUESTION:

I take it th© Maryland policy is directed

not merely to getting the hulks off th® highway right away, but

7
to getting them even off the wrecker's private property
because of eyesores.
MR. LORD;

Exactly correct.

I'd say there is an

equal interest in both.
But the programf although the statute could be
clearer on this, is restricted to hulks that have bean
abandoned in Maryland.

Any fair reading of the statute I

think will indicate that, and there are definitions in the
statute which I think support that.
Now, that is the program.

What has happened under

the program is that in the five years of its @xisfc@nc:@, simple
mathematics applied to the dollar figures in the records
would indicate that at least 100,000 vehicles have been removed
from junk yards, to us© Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s question, and
the highways of the State,abandoned cars.
Now, who knows how many would have been removed if
there hadn't been a bounty program?

It's fair to say that a

very high percentage of those are the result of the inducements
already described.
Now, the record further shows that Alexandria has
participated in this program from its inception and has
received in excess of $219,000 of money from Maryland's
Treasury under the program, money it of course would not have
received without the program.

It might have received the

hulks and it might have received just as many of them, but it

8
would not have received the bounty because it was not in
existence.
QUESTION?

And this $219,000 is all bounty, is it?

MR. LORD?

That's righto

QUESTION;

Either the half shared with the wrecker

or the whole $16.
MR. LORD;

Precisely, your Honor.

All right, now, as with any new and innovative
program, the General Assembly since its inception has constantly
monitored this program in the light of experience and a review
of the Maryland Acts for the last several years will indicate
that fchar® have been at least a dozen amendments, probably as
many as a dozen and a half, to this program, different parts
of it.

It's a complicated, lengthy piece of statutory material.
One of these amendments, Chapter 465 of the Laws of

Maryland of 1974, is the subject of this case.
Now, the challenged amendment doesn’t relate in any
way to the three-part program described.
relate to the entire bounty program.

It doesn’t even

It relates to the manner

by which vehicles in a certain category — and bear in mind
that this bounty is available on all abandoned vehicles no
matter whether it was an
the assembly lines.

Aston-Martin

that just rolled off

But the on© category that's being

complained about is an eight-year old and inoperable vehicle
which prior to the '74 amendment for out-of-State processors

9
could b© received and a bounty paid thereon by virtue of
something known as an indemnity agreement, an agreement
between -the person delivering the - vehicle _ to the processor and
the processor himself executed, of course, at the door of the
processor's plant upon delivery of the vehicle, in effect,
holding harmless the processor for any claims by a prior
person in title. That's really what this case comes down to.
Now, prior to that amendment •— and w® will come to
this more clearly in the equal protection discussion — prior
to that amendment, vehicles in that category could really b@
destroyed without any due process notions that traditionally
had been applied; the notice, the publication, all of which is
carefully written into the first part of the statute was
absent in this last part, and if the Court would like to
direct its attention to the statute, it's found at 17A in the,
Appendix and 18A.

I'm sorry, 15A and 16A.

Now, all of the language in caps at ISA is the new
language of the *74 amendment, as inartistically drafted as
any place of legislation one could imagine, but 1 think all
the parties hare know what it means, and we are interpreting
it in a uniform manner.
All of the prior language which overflows from 15A
to 16A says in essence only this:

Anybody who is licensed,

unlicensed, resident or nonresident, who comes into the
possession of a vehicle eight years old and inoperable can

10

transfer that into the bounty program through a processor
without the title and without notification procedures.

It was

open ended and really threatened to swallow up all of the
carefully drafted aspects of the statute which are laid out
at the prior 10 or 15 pages of the record.
QUESTION?

Why would that be, Mr. Lord?

MR. LORD %

Well, I think —

QUESTION t

It would only apply to an 8-year-old

MR. LORD?

That's true, but I think the record also

vehicle.

states that the bulk of vehicles processed through the bounty
program fall in that category.
QUESTION?

Yes, but you would catch up with that

pretty quickly, wouldn't you?
MR. LORDs

You may.

I don't know, your Honor.

But I think it's fair to say that as of a couple of years ago,
less than 5 percent of the vehicles on the road were 7 years
old and older, something like that.
Now, it is this amendment that is being challenged
and it's being challenged obviously on two grounds.

But I

think it's important before we go to th<§ constitutional
challenge to see exactly what that new statute, the amendment
that * s chal lenged, does.
First of all, it says that for Maryland processor
indemnity agreements are permittedIt's ai. announcement of

11
Maryland public policy, for the first time.

There was no

reference prior to that anywhere in that statute to indemnity
agreements.

It may have been the practice, and I understand

it was, although —
QUESTIONS

Mr. Lord, on 16A, about three lines down

in the heavy type it says "shall” and "may."
MR. LORDs

Which is it?

The "may" has been deleted.

That’s

legislative symbology there.
QUESTION:

OK.

That's what I thought.

MR. LORD;

It now reads "shall."

So in each instance now with a Maryland processor
an indemnity agreement is required to be executed and submitted
to the Motor Vehicle Administration.
QUESTION;
Mr. Lord.

What do you mean by Maryland processor,

He must be a Maryland resident with a plant in

the State?
MR. LORD;

That's correct, your Honor.

QUESTION;

I see.

If you had a Virginia resident

with a plant in Maryland, he would not be a Maryland processor?
MR. LORD;

I think that he may well be, because

what you are looking at for the public policy reason is
whether an indemnity agreement executed in Maryland is valid
public policy in Maryland.

And the indemnity agreement is

executed at the processor's plant.

If that plant is in

Maryland, I think a good argument could be mad© that he would

12

be all right,»
QUESTION:

If he has more than one plant, one in

Maryland and on© in Virginia, is he still all right?
MR» LORD:

I would read that, and I think my

brothers read it the same way, that under this amendment to
qualify Alexandria would have to open a plant in Maryland,
QUESTION:

A plant.

MR, LORD:

It wouldn’t have to be its exclusive

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. LORD:

And then you would have ari indemnity

plant.

agreement in each instance that that plant executed in the
State.
QUESTION:

It depends on the location of the plant,

not a legal residence status, is that right?
MR. LORD:

That's correct.

Now, the other aspect is that the manufacturer's
serial number or identification number must b© sent in also.
In effect, added protections.
QUESTION;

Just to clarify a tag end on this,

on these vehicles,these over-eight-year-old vehicles, must
the processor actually process the vehicle in a plant in
Jy].aryland or just have a plant in Maryland?
MR. LORD:

How do you —

In this category, I think if he had a

plant in Maryland and indemnity agreements were executed in

13
Maryland, he would be a Maryland processor for purposes of —
QUESTION:

Even though he processed that particular

car outside of Maryland»
UK. LORD:

Well, I think it would be where the

indemnity agreement was entered into, your Honor.

One of the

points —
QUESTION:

So your answer is yes.

MR. LORD:

Yes.

QUESTION:

It would be all right if he processed

it across the line in some other State.
MR. LORD:

I think the question really should be

answered as to where the indemnity agreement is executed.
QUESTION:

Let's assume that the indemnity agreement

is executed in Maryland.
MR. LORD:
your Honor,

Well, the only way that would happen,

factually is by delivery to the plant in

Maryland because that is where the indemnity agreement would
be .executed.

And it's plaintiff's position that he would have

■rf .

to open a processing plant in Maryland to qualify under this
amendment.

And I think that's a fair reading —
QUESTIONs.

Supposing a processor has a plant in

Maryland and one just across the line in Virginia, and he
goes around and picks up wrecked cars.

And when he picks one

up from an owner, he gives them an indemnity agreement right
on the spot.

He has a plant in Maryland, but he just happens

14
to be closer to his plant in Virginia, so he takas it over to
Virginia.
MR. LORD:

Well, I think to put 'the argument in its

cleanest form, I think that the State position would be that
that vehicle would have to be processed at. the Maryland plant.
QUESTION:

All right.

MR, LORD:

As a matter of practice, that I know

would happen in all instances.
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, you've already answered it,

Mr. Lord, but tell me again, what’s the significance of an
indemnity agreement?
MR. LORD:

An indemnity agreement has places behind

the processor as far as liability is concerned, the sailer, an
unlicensed person, it could be anyone.

It says to the

processor, if you take this vehicle, I'm warranting to you
that I have title to it and that if you get into any kinds of
further problems with a prior owner, I will indemnify you and
hold you harmless.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. LORD:

And that, of course, is an incentive to

the processor to take the ear because he is not buying a -~
QUESTION:

Is that executed by a wrecker to the

processor or by a third party?
MR, LORD:

No, your Honor, and that brings me to the

aspect of the equal protection argument.

There are several

15
other ways in which title can pass, or evidence of title can
pass.

1 think it's fair to say, and I think we are all in

agreement that in Alexandria's case a wrecker's certificate,
a licensed wrecker's certificate, is the second most prevalent
way that they receive vehicles.

Indemnity agreements was the

first; a second was a wrecker's certificate, which

is a

document obtained from the Motor Vehicle Administration after
the. wrecker has established to the Motor Vehicle Administration
that he has evidence of title.

That becomes a title document

and that is the second way and the topical way that a wrecker
passes title to a processor.
.And, of course, on© of the arguments her© is that
the processor has that option still available to him.

.And

before I break on this point, I would like to get quickly to
the State's justification for this amendment because we have
briefed thoroughly and urged this Court to accept our argument
that Blake v. McClung on the 'Vithin its jurisdiction" point.
Justice Harlem's opinion of 1898 stands for the proposition
that Alexandria simply can't qualify for equal protection
relief because» it doesn't do business in Maryland, it doesn't
maintain a real office in Maryland, the only office is the
home of its president; it's not incorporated in Maryland, it
doesn't pay taxes in Maryland,

all four, as with the MeClung

case, and that case remains good law today.
with approval several times.

It has been cited

That's fully briefed.

16

Now, I want; to get, though, to the justifications
under equal protection because they cut just as much toward the
commerce clause argument as they do towards the equal protection
argument.
Maryland wanted to do several things with this
amendment in 1974.

First of all, it wanted to legitimise a

haphazard practice with respect to indemnity agreements.

It

wanted to announce the principle that at least in Maryland
indemnity agreements were valid.

Your Honors know that there

is a split of authority around the country on whether indemnity
agreements

are valid public policy documents.

these purposes in Maryland.

They are for

Obviously, wa can’t affect the

public policy of Virginia or Pennsylvania, and didn’t purport
to.

That is why it is restricted to indemnity agreements in

Maryland.
Now, it’s interesting, too, that there are five other
out-of-state processors who have gained the benefits over the
years of the Maryland program, but only on®, Alexandria, has
brought this suit.

Now, the reason is the other processors

have just shifted their ground and have obtained vehicles more
readily under the wrecker's certificate and haven't relied on
indemnity agreements.

This, I think, illustrates, in response

to an earlier question., that this is an equal possibility.
Now, a second reason —
QUESTION:

Does the record show that their input is

17
as great under fchess alternative methods as it was before?
MR. LORD:

The record indicates, such as the record

is on this point, that in a couple of specific instances
attested to by an affidavit of a Mr. Gittleson, an officer of
Alexandria, that several towers hav© not delivered th©
quantity of vehicles after July 1, 1974, to Alexandria that
they delivered prior to that.

But the record also shows that

the money figures are unpersuas.lv© and may help the State.
There was no loss of revenue established.
It further establishes, however, and equally
importantly, that there are other sources of vehicles.

In

fact, those sources picked up in Alexandria’s case after the
’7 4 amendment.
The second justification,under the McGowan, Dandridge,
and San Antonio School District cases . these justifications
are clearly satisfactory, arc that owners gain additional
protection because under these agreements an owner can look to
a Maryland processor„

Put yourself, if you will, in the

situation of an owner whose vehicle has been wrongfully taken,,
If it's been destroyed by an out-of-State processor with no
contacts in Maryland, not subject to process in Maryland, our
position is firmly, contrary to a gratuitous statement in the
district court’s opinion, Alexandria is not subject to process
in Maryland under any fair reading of our long-arm statute or
this Court’s principles.

18
QUESTION:

You say it would foe unconstitutional to

reach them?
MR, LORO:

What I am saying —

QUESTION:

You say the State would be barred by the

Constitution to have a long-arm statute that would reach them?
MR» LORD:

I haven’t gotten to that, your Honor»

What I am saying, right now, for a Maryland resident who has
bean wronged, whose car has been wrongfully destroyed in
Virginia, he has no relief in the Maryland courts»
QUESTION:

Under the existing Maryland long-arm law.

MR. LORD;

That's right.

Now, it's possibl® that that

could bs expanded and broadened in light of this Court's
holdings, but as it stands now, h© would have to go to Virginia
to get relief.
QUESTION:

This is the owner of an eight-year-old

inoperable vehicle hulk.
MR. LORD:

Right.

Inoperable, of course, could mean

that a part or two —
QUESTION;

Well, it's defined as cars without an

engine, among other things.
MR, LORD:

Without an engine is one category? otherwise

inoperable is a second category, and that could simply mean
that -—
QUESTION:

That it63 out of gas?

MR. LORD:

We discussed that before argument.

That.

19
may be pressing it.

If it needed new spark plugs I think it

would be inoperable.
QUESTION:

Some of these ar® mad® of pur® gold.

It's such a valuable right on. the part of th© owner.
MR. LORDs

Well, 1 guess beauty is in the eye of

the beholder, your Honor.

I think if the owner is in title? he

may have a vehicle he has been holding for future appreciation,
in his mind at least.
QUESTION:

under these agree-

ments?
MR. LORD:

I don't have any ids a, you'r Honor.

What I am saying is since this statute has been in
effect, it at least says that -th© owner can go against the
Maryland processor.

In effect, th©re is a second string to

his bow.
QUESTION:

That's your first reason.

MR. LORD:

No.

The first reason is th® legitimization

of these agreements in the first place, only in Maryland.
The second is ---QUESTION:

Do you go on th© premise that indeed

Alexandria is a person for purposes of the —
MR. LORD:

That's correct.
/

QUESTION:s

On that premise, but you don't concede.

MR. LORD:

That's right.

QUESTION:

But there isn't any State desire at all

20

to keep the bounty payments within the State of Maryland?
MR» LORDs

Your Honor, I don't se© how you can divina

•that from this record at all.
QUESTION:

The simol® —-

One reason vrould be that they might pick

up Maryland income tax on them.

They don't from Alexandria,

maybe, I don't know.
MR. LORD:

I think that's an additional justification,

your Honor.
QUESTION:

It's a pretty good ons, don't you think?

MR. LORD:

It is.

But it raises questions that

simply aren't in this case.
QUESTION:

Precisely.

It raises some constitutional

MR. LORDS

Right.

QUESTION:

Is that why you are avoiding it?

MR. LORDs

Not at all.

questions.

Not at all.

I think all we

have to show under equal protection is that there are rational
reasons that legislators at least could have thought.
QUESTION:

What’s fch® third.

MR. LORD:

The third reason, your Honor, is that

there is a tendency to have bounty payments come only on
vehicles abandoned in Maryland if they are delivered to Maryland
processors under indemnity agreements.

Remember, now, the

weakest possible evidence of title; is an. indemnity agreement,
and the position here is that unlike the 56 vehicles that the

21
State apparently wrongfully paid for on behalf of Alexandria
Scrap which were turned over to Alexandria from the District
of Columbia police, if Maryland processors subject to

Maryland

jurisdiction are receiving these vehicles under indemnity
agreements,there is a greater tendency that they will be
vehicles abandoned in Maryland.
Now, I will come back in my remaining time to some
of the other aspects of the case.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN P. RAMSEY,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE
MR. RAMSEY:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

If I may, sir, I would like to lower this.

Mr.

Lord stands somewhat taller than X do.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

That*s why we have it

arranged that way.
MR. RAMSEY:

It's very conveniant, your Honor.

Let m® -address myself, if I may, to one of the
introductory subject matters which may b@ the grounds of
soma sorts of confusion in this case.

I think it was Mr.

Justic® White or possibly Mr. Justice Brennan who inquired
conc@rn.lng the impact on wreckers and what a wrecker was.
The wrecker, of course, under this statutory scheme
— I believe it was Mr. Justice Brennan — the wrecker is a

22

man who does in fact, maintain a yard.

He is defined to be &

man who maintains a yard, the purposes of the yard being that
he may take from those cars which he has on the yard usable
parts for the purpose of vending them to others who retain
car3 of the same vintage.
A tower, however, a term which Mr. Lord did not
identify to the Court, he is the gentleman who comes out on
th© highways, maintains no yard in which he stores vehic3.es
which have been the subject matter of wrecks, maintains no
yard from which he vends spare parts, but who simply twos in
th© total automobile off the Beltway accident, and it is
irraparabl®, cannot ben repaired, and it is this tower who is
not -idle subject matter of licensure under th© Maryland
organization statutory structure who is thw large source of
veh-.cla hulks.

largo source, if the Court

please, of-'those vehicles which malt© us© of the indemnity
agreement.
QUESTION:

He might dispose of the hulk ht picks up

either to a wrecker or a processor.
MR. RAMSEY:
He could go to either.

He could do either, Mi:. Justice Brennan
And if he goes to a processor, it was

in this area that you will see the subject matter of th©
appendices which are very detailed in analyzing Alexandria's
performance, where they got their vehicles from —• their hulks
I should say more properly — why it was that thoj felt this

constituted an impingement on the commerce, the interstate
commerce,because needless to say, sitting as this Court does
in this district, Alexandria Scrap is just over the Potomac,
it is a relatively convenient location for the towing of
hulks from that graveyard of automobiles -that w© call our
Beltway around Washington.

And it is a logical place to which

vehicles may b© towed, as distinct from a wrecker taking them
in.

But in any event# may I address myself to it

and tell you the classic ways in which this might occur# sir?
In the event that you had a vehicle which you
couldn't part with# as I did with some of mine#

it simply
s

died in your driveway and you wanted it tewed away# you would
have title.

You might# however, over an excess of eight years

not be able to locate th® title# nor would you want to go to
the cost and expense of applying for a new title# of a duplicate
title for an ancient vehicle.
You might# on fch© other hand# fluff©r the ignominy
of having parked in your front yard an abandoned motor vehicle
which somebody else just pulled up and left# which w© see on
tha streets of our cifcias at all times, utterly abandoned#
stripped down by youngsters# without wheels# without distributor#
without spark plugs# but a clearly abandoned vehicle.
An abandoned property — and I'm not# of course,
trying to teach the Court law as respects abandoned property#
but abandoned property signifies to us just that.

And th®

indemnity agreement really says to th® processor, I# a tower#
found this car under conditions which I deem it to have been an
abandoned vehicle.

If on th® other hand there is any question

raised, X, sir, will indemnify you.
Now, here's where Mr. Lord's argument falls
considerably short, because h® attempts to direct this Court's
attention to the necessity of having a Maryland agreement.
That agreement does not inure to the benefit of the State of
Maryland? that agreement inures to the benefit, in my case,
.qf Alexandria Scrap.

And if Alexandria Scrap should make the

mistake —- and again, Justice Marshall, I am back to th® line
of inquiry which you addressed to me, sir — if I should
through—for, and on behalf of Alexandria Scrap say to my
client, "Yes, sir, you may accept that indemnification," and
some judge or jury thereafter said, "That chattel had not
lost its true ownership arid you ar© a converter of th® chattel,
I would suffer whatever th© civil and/or criminal consequences
which might follow, although civil would b@ far more likely
given th.® type chattel and the conditions under which it was
found.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ramsey, 1 thought Mr. Lord's argument

was that if the processing of these hulks is limited to
Maryland plants, that the owner could at least have someone
within that jurisdiction to go to and sue for th® conversion.
MR. RAMSEY:

Well, he has th® same person or persons

in this line to sue for the conversion.

Now, keep in mind,

sir, that —
QUESTION s

But in th® case of your client, if Hughes

26
processas in Alexandriana Maryland claimant to fch® hulk is
going to have to go into the Virginia court.

If Mr. Lord's

1

argument is right that the .bounty is limited, to Maryland
processors, he will have somebody within his own jurisdiction
to sue.

Do you disagree with that?
MR. SAMSEY:
QUESTION s

Yes, but I step back —
You disagree?

MR. RAMSEY:

I step backward to your premise, sir.

I do not agree with Mr. Lord's argument, because under th©
regulations as they are enacted in Maryland, and we have
adhered to them, w© have an office in Maryland, our president
lives in Maryland, and w® maintain a license under Maryland
law, and wa may b© reached by service of process by Maryland.
QUESTION:

But we are being told by the Attorney

General’s office of Maryland that th® Maryland long-arm
statutes doesn’t apply.

Certainly we are not going to sit her©

and decide a constitutional question trying to resolve that
issue.
MR. RAMSEY:

I don't think you need to, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, but I think that this same issue was addressed by
^

a three-judge court which heard this below.

It is discussed

by Judge Kaufman who wrote the opinion for th© three-judge
court.

The fact of our licensure in Maryland and th® fact

of our office in Maryland is discussed by Judge Kaufman, and
the three-judge court had no difficulty whatsoever with th©

27
fact that Alexandria Scrap could be subjected to the court
processes of Maryland -- non©»

And I am saying to you, sir,

that the structure of the Maryland Act — and mind you, Mr»
Lord attempts to direct your attention to the bounty program
in its broad scop®.

We say to you that the bounty program is

not what this case is about.

If you read the record in this

case, you will find, gentlemen of the Court, that when a
$16 payment is mad® to a processor, $14 of it goes back out to
the tower who delivers the hulk to fch® processer.

Th® State's

brief would have this Court believe,understand, or find
that wa are in this business and ar© constructing a $1 million
bailer or shredder and an enormous processing plant for th®
purpose of collecting bounties from th® State of Maryland for
hulk automobiles.
W@ ar© running a processing plant requiring some
50,000 to 60,000 hulks a year.

Our constitutional complaint,

is that when th® legislature of Maryland attempts to deprive*
our plant of the right to compete on an even footing in
interstate commerce with those processors in intrastate
commerce who also want 50,000 hulks a year to keep their gold^

finger machine, as Mr. Lord described it, the one that takes
a car and crams it into a 2 by 2 by 5 bail — we want, them and
they want them.

Are you suggesting that seven-eighths of

our prior cases.
MR. RAMSEY:

1 think it is not, Mr. Justice Relinquish,

although, having reviewed the various commerce clause cases
in preparation for the argument, the commerce clause cases
diverge in many respects, but it essentially says this:

W®, as

a licensed person, participating in this program in accordance
with the laws of Maryland and in the interstate, as distinct
from intrastate, aspects of it, ar© entitled to be treated
©ven-handedly and to have our fair shot at the market.

They

cannot appreciate the value of the hulk and then say that by
virtu© of tli© appreciation of the value of tha hulk only a
Maryland processor may hav® a crack at those appreciated hulks
where w® ar© in the State.
Mow, you’re mixing, admittedly —- or I am mixing; you

So is that a valid distinction between

that line of cases and this one?
MR. RAMSEY s
QUESTIONs

Is there any valid distinction?
No,

Evan so.,

Even if they ar© prohibi­

tions, doss it make them any less valid precedent in your
favor hare?
MR. RAMSEY s

I think not, sir.

Mr. Justice Blackmun

as you know, sir, when you intermix the conceptsof each of
thee© various cases and where th® Court has talked in terms of
a prohibition in a given instance as being constitutionally
interdicted, obviously th© thrust of the opinion may tend that
way.

W@ submit, however, sir, that they ar© equally valid in

support of our position, which I think is the precise answer
to the exact question which you addressee! to me.
QUESTION;

Well# I was trying to show up your

argument a little bit.
Let me go back to a factual difference.

I think Mr.

Lord said that this bounty is split 50-50, and you say it’s
split —
MR. RAMSEY:
the way I put it.

I have misled you slightly, sir, by

If you have a wrecker who delivers under

a wrecker's certificate, that’s the wrecker, the man with the
yard and h® strips a car for parts, it’s plit $8 to the
wrecker and $8 to the processor.

On the other hand, if you

have an unlicensed — a tower, the* gentleman I earlier started
to describe, the man who picks up the inoperative car but who
does not retain them for use or cannibalising for parts, then
$16 goes the processor, and the processor rebates and has for
yeasr $14 of the $16 to the man who delivered it to him.
Have I clarified the problem, Mr. Justice Blackman?
QUESTION;

I wanted to get it straight so that I

know we are not quibbling about facts here.
MR. RAMSEY;

No.

I think there is no disagreement
€

between the parties that there is a distinction between a
wrecker and a tower, no disagreement that this Statutory, structure
carries an

$8 and $8 breakup,

where it’s a wrecker who

delivers the hulk, and. you can visualize the logic of it.

He has presumably cannibalised the .hulk down.
QUESTION;

Now, Jack Benny takes his 1908 Maxwell

up before Alexandria Scrap and it died at your front door and
you take it over and there isn’t any antique value to it.

He’s an owner.

And may I say,sir, if you

drove your own n*z up to Alexandria, we would talk to you, sir,
on th© basis of what is the going value of an automobile —
QUESTION;

You would get the bounty then*

This is

what I am trying to got out of you.
MR, RAMSEY s

W® would get th® bounty and w® would

pay you what may be called fair market value, your Honor.
That would be th® answer to that.
QUESTION:

And if he knew you were going to get $16,

h© might want a little more than he would without that.
MR, RAMSEY;

If it were Jack Benny and he was still

alive, God bless him, I think he would probably want $20,
I think w<s would resist, but I think he would ask for it.

QUESTION;

May I ask ona more question/ Mr» Ramsey»

Did I understand that you said th© larger proportion of the
hulks that Alexandria acquires in Maryland com© from towers?
MR. RAMSEY:

That's correct.

And that's in our brief»

What's the percentage, roughly, between

towers and wreckers?
MR. RAMSEY:

About owo to on®, sir.

You will find

MR. RAMSEY:

trying to protect the owner so that he will have somebody in

MR. RAMSEY:
QUESTION t

Yes.
Actually the Indemnity agreement runs

from the fellow who brought it in.
.MR. RAMSEY:
QUESTION:
MR. RAMSEY:

To the processor.
To th® processor.
That's correct,, sir.

Now, th® only way in which that would b® helpful,
as a qualified processor, and Alexandria remains a qualified
processor under Maryland law right down to today, but w® would
have filed with th© Department the title, the VIN plait®, th©
vehicle identification number plate, th® indemnity agree.

We

would show by that indemnity agreement that Alexandria Scrap,
a processor which has an office in Silver Spring, Maryland,
and holds a license under the rags, received a 1969 Oldsmobile
which Mr. Justice Whit® believes was stolen from his front
yard, and that it was received from Joseph Smith Hauling
Company.
Now, whmi you com® to us and say, "I think my car
was stolen," nobody had good title.

Th® Department would b©

able to tell you that Joseph Smith of Rockville was th© tower
who hauled it away, Alexandria Scrap was the processor who
compressed it into a 2 by 2 by 4 •—
QUESTION:

Really, if you could get at th© fellow

i

v;ho gave the indemnity agreement, and if he was any good, it
wouldn't make any difference who th® processor was.

MR. RAMSEY:

Well, I think that’s correct.

It's th©

L.D. Pocket doctrine, which on© would you look to for th®
easiest collection.
But as a practical matter, if you wanted to get to us,
you have us in Maryland and you have us under th® thurab of

everybody ©Is©, because of our office, our presidency.

What they ar® trying to do — and I suggest to the

But I thought they had a hang-up in the

District, about those two affidavits where Judge Kaufman
said that it is suggested that there are some recovered from
the District of Columbia, but he intimated that that wasn't
critical to the court's decision.
MR. RAMSEY:

It was an irrelevant fact, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, with what the court was really saying, because
never had there been any regulation, statutory requirement, or
any other requirement the car be abandoned in Maryland in order
to be, the subject of bounty.
conceded that.

And counsel for the State

The regs show it.

The statute shows it.

And that was what Judge Kaufman was addressing himself to as
respects that.

39

Now, as respects to where it was claimed that
two processors had submitted the same VXN plats, or mad© claim
on the same car, there was absolutely no evidence in the record
that our .man didn't in fact process, that our mein wasn’t the
one who did process.

And that’s what Judge Kaufman said on

that, Mr. Justice Rahnquist, I think you will find in the
opinion of the thre©-judge court.
But in essence what the court did was analyse what
was before it and say that there ar® no relevant or material
considerations, and that this is not a rational basis for th©
State’s amendment because as a practical matter th© statute
has never been enforced this way, th© regs have never been
enforced this way.

It simply hasn't worked this way.

And to

say now that this is a rational basis is simply not supportable.
Arid it is not a rational basis for what was claimed to be th©
discrimination, which was admitted to exist.

If a Western State is having problems with,

coyotes and passes a bounty law,which you may or may not be

I would say if it — I may not live in

a passing familiarity with the concept.

My answer to that-

would be that so long as there was no invidious discrimination

put it in our category

— if you license a bounty hunter

and th© guy is in there hunting, you ought, to treat him fairly

MR. RAMSEY;
QUESTION %

Sir?
Well, the State could do it in th® milk

case but not in th© car case.
MR. RAMSEY i

I

think there are differences between

those two illustrations which the Court has posed to me, and I
simply submit that on th® second of th© illustrations which you

gave me, it would ba in problems as respects commerce clause.
In the first of them you would bs further away, but you might
bs subject to attack, such as in the Hoed case and in the
Sealig

case where you had the retention for own us© within own

State-to the disadvantage of on© of the sistar States who
soak to serve its market out of your available resources.
And the Constitution in effect permits us to go from State to
State £r©a of improper impediments against our right to deal.
Now, if the Court pleas®, I note that 1 am in the
closing minutes of my presentation, and I would, simply return
to on© additional point made by Mr. Lord in connection with
56 unite which ha says on the record were wrongfully paid for
to Alessandria.

I will submit that upon examination of the

record, you will not find evidence that Alexandria was paid
for any units it was improper to pay it for.

These, again,

revert to the substance of Mr. Lord's argument that if you
pick a car up out of Maryland, that you needs must restrict the
right to receive bounty.
Nov;, for the Court's benefit, in the record, although
not printed in your appendix, at record pages 261 through 266,
the Court will find specimens of indemnity agreements which
were agreed to be the forms which were and had been in us®.
Upon checking those indemnity agreements accepted by the State
of Maryland, you will note that Alexandria Scrap was the only
one whose indemnity agreement showed where the vehicle was

45
picked up.

All other indemnity agreements simply showed the

license number, the make, and the model.

There was nothing,

no question raised with respect to where these vehicles had
bean abandoned in

order to accept indemnity agreements from

various persons who had participated in the program.
And I thank the Court very much.

remaining.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Yes, you have, about 6

minutes.
MR. LORDs

Thank you, your Honor.

I would like to pick up on a point raisad by Mr.
Justice Blackmun and Mr. Justice Stevens relating to the
commerce clausa»
The State's position is that this case stands alone
because — first of all, it doesn't relate to the milk
industry, as all the other cases seem to.

Secondly, because

tills is a subsidy program established by the State of Maryland.
And the argument presented her®, I think is unique in this
Court, namely, that a subsidy program established by the State
that has yielded enormous sums of money, no matter how split up

that money has been at th® whim of th« plaintiff in. this casa,
now claims that it is receiving less than it was receiving
before.
You hav© to look at this 1974 amendment as part and
parcel of th© 1969 legislation? and indeed all th© amendments
to that legislation, and treat it as if everything passed at
one time, and then apply the feast under commerce clause and
equal protection to it, and th© State submits that th© statute
passes muster under both equal protection and commerce clausa.
Now, also under th® commerce clause — th© real market
h@r® is not eight-year old hulks abandoned in Maryland and
titled in Maryland.
scrap.

The market is, in th© anti-trust sens®,

That is th© commerce.
How, there is no burden on interstates commerce as

such hare.,

Thera ia an alleged burden on on® who allegedly

participatas in a State commerce, namely, th® plaintiff.

Now,

Pika v. Bruce Church Company is a perfect case in point to
illustrat© what I am about to say.

Those fasts load to th©

conclusion that it's an incidental burden which is permissible,
w® submit, and as long as local, legitimate public interest are
served, this dovetails th® equal protection argument and th®
commerce clause argument.

And in fact, if you want to see

large industries that were hit in the pocketbook, don’t, look
at Alexandria Scrap because they haven’t established it.
Look at the American Can Company who closed up its Washington

47
plant when Oregon passed a law which says that you can't get
a rebate on one-way cans any more.

Look at Procter 5 Gamble,

a case cited in our reply brief in the Seventh Circuit, which
attacked the city of Chicago's antiphosphat® ordinane®.

Th®r©

there® is a demonstrable financial loss in the short run and
immadiafee.

It's not demonstrated in this record, and I don't

want to quarrel with this record, because what’s before th©
Court is in effect something —

MR. LORDi

Th© allegations, your Honor, in those

cases war® that they war© discriminatory because —
QUESTIONs

The Court found otherwise.

MR. LORD?

Th© Court found otherwise, but there were

some serious allegations because of th© distances from th®
market that, for instance, th© American Can _ case particularly,
you simply could not compete effectively in that market
because you are too far away from it.
Similar secondary arguments were raised.
Procter & Gamble case

In th©

there was a secondary effect on all

th® markets outside of Chicago. Th© Court found that that
didn’t present a commerce clausa claim.
Now, I do want to say something about this point of
the office of this company, because I hadn't thought it would
become so important, but it has.

Th® brief states that the

office of Alexandria Scrap i.n Maryland in fact is on Ellsworth
Drive in Silver Spring, and it's the home of the president»

I know we can, but do we do that normally?

I don't know that you do, but I don't

know that a three-judge court reaches out and takes an issue:*
that was never argued, and never was below.

We normally don’t disagree with local

MR. LORD;

Mo, you don't, your Honor, but this is a
