MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in No. 74-1303, Bishop against Wood.
Mr. Smith, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN B. SMITH ON
BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. SMITH:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

I am Norman Smith, from Greensboro, North Carolina,

counsel for petitioner in this case.
Petitioner is a former member of the Marion, North
Carolina Municipal Police Force.

He was dismissed on March 31,

v

1972, after nearly three years of uninterrupted service as an
officer.

He had achieved permanent employee status

after

successfully completing a six-month probationary period.
Certain aspects of the Marion personnel ordinance relate to
discharge procedure, which I will discuss in a moment, and
certain reasons were given to Mr. Bishop for his discharge,
which I shall also discuss presently.
The suit was instituted in the United States District
Court for the Western District of North Carolina, alleging
wrongful discharge without notice and hearing.
for summary judgment were filed.
the respondents5 motion.

Cross motions

The district court granted

The matter was brought to the United

States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit where a two-to-one
hearing panel decision was in the respondents' favor, and it

4
was reheard en banc and affirmed by an equally divided court.
This petition was granted and now the case is here.
The case, we think, is very critical in that it
involves applications of principles announced by this Court in
Board of Regents v. Roth and Perry v. Sindermann as further
explicated in hrnett v. Kennedy.
First of all, we contend that the petitioner had
property rights grounded in statute which gave rise to
procedural -~
QUESTION;

Mr. Smith, let me call your attention on

page 19 of your Petitioner for Certiorari, a part of Judge
Jones' opinion in the district court, where he says, in about
the third paragraph on that page, that one little sentence:
"It further appears that the plaintiff held his position at the
will and pleasure of the city."
Now, I read that as an interpretation of local
ordinance and the State lav/ that was affirmed by the Court of
Appeals.

How do you get arouxid that in view of the language

in Roth and Perrv that these kind of things aise as a matter
of State law and are regulated by State law?
MR. SMITH:

If your Honor please, I don't think those

cases said that the United States district judge is a court of
last resort as far as determining what State law is.
QUESTION:

Here you have got the district judge, of

North Carolina, who was presumably a North Carolina practitioner

5
before he took the bench»

You have got a panel of the Fourth
I

Circuit which deals with North Carolina law much more regularly
than we do.

Are you asking us to second-guess those two

courts on what North Carolina law is?
MR. SMITH:

If your Honor please? the record is

before the Court? and we submit there is nothing intuitive
about North Carolina law.

It's written and whatever of it

applies is here, and we think the lower court is manifestly
wrong on the record of this case.
QUESTION:

Then you do want us to reach a contrary

result on the question of North Carolina law as to that reached
by Judge Jones.
MR. SMITH:

Absolutely.

We think there is nothing

in the record that supports his conclusion.that the petitioner
held his position at the will arid pleasure of the city.
Court of Appeals wrote no opinion.

The

The only opinion written

by the Court of Appeals was Judge Winter's, in my judgment,
compelling a dissenting opinion.

Four out of the seven judges

in active service would have favored my positron.
Now, the statute in question —
QUESTION:

Before you leave that point, the

respondents' brief cites a couple of North Carolina cases at
page 11 of their brief, which they stand for the proposition
that the contract is terminable at will.
those cases in ycur reply brief.

You did not discuss

I wonder if you plan

to

6

discuss them today»
MR, SMITHs

If your Honor pleas®, I view those cases

as having to do with private employment and employment in the
absence of (1) a personnel ordinance such as we have here
or anything analogous to it in the way of contracting,

(2) in

the absence of a fixed probationary period with a maturation
into a permanent employment classification»

Thus I feel

the cases just deal with the common law of employment in the
absence of agreement and ordinance to the contrary and are
not controlling.
QUESTION:

You rely on the face of the statute as

giving your client some kind of
MR. SMITH:

Primarily, yes, statute and practices

of the city.
QUESTION:

Is it customary in the Fourth Circuit in

four-to-four affirments, affirments by an equally divided
court, for some of the judges to writ© the dissenting opinion?
MR. SMITH:

If your Honor please, the dissenting

opinion was produced by Judge Winter when there was a hearing
panel of three.

No opinion came out of the four-to-four.

QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Oh, I see.
W® assume that Senior Judge Bryan -When the en banc hearing was granted,

that, washed out everything that had gone before in the panel,
did it not?

7
MR. SMITH;

I presume so.

Nonetheless, I think.

Judge Winter's opinion is very persuasive simply because
of Judge Winter’s reasoning, and I think that it should be
regarded by tha Court as being correct.
The ordinance in question is very brief, and I thought
I would read it.
"A permanent employee whose work is not satisfactory
over a period of time shall be notified in what way his work
is deficient and what he must do if his work is to be
satisfactory.

If a permanent employee fails to perform

t?.p to the standard of the classification held, or continues to
be negligent, inefficient, or unfit to perform his duties, h©
may be dismissed by the City Manager.”
Now, to us, it’s very clear that this ordinance
establishes four causes for dismissal;

(1) work not up to

standard, (2) negligence, (3) inefficiency, (4) unfitness
for duty.

And, next,

think it’s very clear that this

ordinance establishes certain prerequisites to dismissal,
procedural prerequisites;

(1) that there must be a notification

of the deficiency, and (2) a continuance of the performance in
a deficient manner, and (3) a statement of explanation.
QUESTION; That you in effect read into the language that
you read to us „

But wouldn't the sentence, the part of the

ordinance, the last sentence of it that you didn’t read to us
rather cast in some question what you read between the lines?

3
Because it explicitly says what a discharged employee- shall be
entitled to»

Wouldn't that indicate he is not entitled to

anything else?

"Any discharged employee shall be given a

written notice'of his discharge setting forth the effective
date and reasons for his discharge if he shall request such
a notice.n
MR. SMITHs

That’s correct.

We think that’s an

additional procedure that has to be undergone, and I will
undertake to discuss it in a moment,

I could now if the

Court wished, why we feel that the very minimal procedures
set forth in section 6 are not binding in the determination
of the substantive rights that are created by that section.
I feel that at least six Justices of this Court-in the Arnett
case would so hold.
Mow, the respondent concedes at page 10 of their
brief that th© ordinance is mandatory as to notification.
This concession is very important.

They say it is mandatory

as to notification of th® deficiency in performance.
QUESTION:

Is that in any event or only if requested

by the dischargee?
MR. SMITH:
notice.

I’m not talking about the post-discharge

I think I’m. interpreting the

correctly.

respondents5 brief

Or page 10, the first sentence, "Although the

ordinance is mandatory with respect to notifying employees of
areas of deficient performance, it is merely permissive as to

9
their dismissal for failure fco adequately perform."
Th© mandatory provision conceded by the respondents
is that requiring fch© prenotice, the predischarge notice#
in other words, the notice that must be followed by an
opportunity to reform and amend one’s conduct.
The district court assumed, on 15 of the certiorari
petition opinion, that the ordinance had been fully complied
with.

Of course, we think that, assumption is manifestly

incorrect, for reasons which we will state in a moment.

But

once it is established by the concession mad© by fch®
respondents and the assumption of th® district court that it
is necessary to comply with certain procedures before
terminating a public employee's employment, then we think th©
property rights are confirmed, th© property rights that bring
due process considerations into play are confirmed.
We have an alternative argument which I will rely
upon th® briefs for and will not take 'the Court's time, that
fch© fact alone that this employee was classified as a permanent
employ®® after six-months probationary service, that alone, w©
feel, gave him a property right to which the 14th amendment —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will resume there at

1 o’clock.
MR. SMITH;

Yas, your Honor.

Thank you, sir.

taken.)

AFTERNOON SESSION
Cl p,m.}
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may continue, Mr.

Smith.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN B. SMITH

{RESUMED)

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. SMITH:;

Thank you, your Honor.

If it pleas® the Court, I would like now to turn
to the 14th Amendment liberty interests that we feel are
identified in this case and which we think provide an
alternative basis for procedural due process requirements.
At the time of the discharge, the Chief and City
Manager refused to discuss their reasons with the petitioner
as to why he was being let go.

Later, upon request, and in

accordance with the ordinance that we have cited, a written
statement of reasons was furnished, stating that petitioner's
work had been unsatisfactory and that he had refused to attend
certain schools.

Of course, the petitioner takes exception

to these and says that these statements ar® false.
QUESTION:

Was this furnished the petitioner in

private, more or .less, by a letter, or was it publicly announced?
MR. SMITH:
i:c your Honor please.

It was furnished privately in a letter,
The ordinance says that one may ask

for written reasons, an! the petitioner did so and they ware
furnished.

11
QUESTION;

At the petitioner's request.

MR- SMITH;

Yes, your Honor.

Later on, when
QUESTION:

Would that be of public record?

MR- SMITH;

Well, under North Carolina law, I am

inclined to think they would.

We have a very broad public

records statute which is not mentioned in the brief that it
has only very narrow exceptions.

Without going back and

reading it, my inclination would be to say that, yes, this
would be a matter of public record.
QUESTION;

In any event, there would be a record

that could be mad© available to some new employer if he
sought employment after his discharge?
MR- SMITH;
QUESTION;

Oh, yes, sir, certainly.
Thar© is no prohibition against showing

it.
MR. SMITH;
QUESTION;

None whatever.
Is there a requirement that it fo© shown?

MR. SMITH;

No requirement that it be shown, except

pursuant to our public records law, I am inclined to think
it would be available.

The public records law is very explicit

and quite simple and quite short.
have the citation in my mind.

I am just sorry I don’t

It is relevant, but it somehow

or another didn't get into the briefs.
QUESTION;

Now, incidentally, while I have you

12
interrupted, 1 gather you make this argument as a reason for
reversal apart from the finding of the district judge that he
was not a permanent employee , even if h© were only a
temporary employee.
MR. SMITH:

Precisely.

Even if he were only

probationary or temporary, didn’t have any property interest,
clearly, if his liberty was of a constitutional magnitude, he
is entitled to procedural due process»
QUESTION:

And this is because of th© nature of the

reasons given at his request why?
MR. SMITH:
Honor.

Well, the initial reasons, no, your

The initial reasons are not, I think, of the kind that

would require that — unsatisfactory work, refusal to attend
schools.

At least I don’t argue that they are sufficient.

Perhaps some would.
But later when this action was brought in the district
court, the Chiaf of Police, under oath, by affidavit, gave
his real reasonsfor discharging th© petitioner.

Th©s© ware

much more serious and did implicate the liberty interests of
th® petitioner.
QUESTION:

So it's only at that stage, you say, that

the liberty interests 'were implicated?
MR. SMITH:
to us.

It was only then 'that it became disclosed

But we must assume that the Chief of Police was

telling th© truth under oath when ha filed his affidavit, and

13
we must further assume that his extrajudicial statement not
under oath was false, or else he would have been committing
perjury.
QUESTIOMs

Then that leaves you in this position;

There, was nothing implicating a liberty interest at the time
of the discharge or even in response to petitioner’s request
for a letter.

It was only when you sued them that this

came out as a legal defense.

Do you think that's in the same

posture as if they had simply announced it without any lawsuit?
I think whenever one reasonably suspects

MR. SMITH;

that his liberty interests have been violated, h@ can go to
court and ask th© person who fired him, under oath, to say
what, his reasons were.
QUESTION;

But if a liberty interest hadn't been

violated at the time you file the lawsuit and the violation
occurs only as a result of another party's pleading to th©
lawsuit that you brought against him, do you think that's on
the same footing as if they had publicly announced it at the
time of discharge?
MR. SMITH;

Well, in response to that, your Honor,

it's well known that; a lot of times employers will not be
caedid with employees to their face and say their reasons, but
it must be assumed, I think, that for prospective employers
and others who inquired about petitioner's conduct, I think it
must be assumed that the Chief would hav® given these real

14
reasons.
QUESTIONS

But is there any evidence that he did in

fact give them to anybody els© before the lawsuit?
MR. SMITHS
QUESTION:

No, sir, there is not.

What about the private letter?

confusing me a little notv', Mr. Smith.
letter?

There is none.
You are

What about that private

Do you claim that places some kind of a stigma on him?
MR. SMITH:

I think it would be argued that it did,

but in candor I am not satisfied that it did.

It said

"unsatisfactory work and refusal to attend school."

I am

hesitant to say that that rises to a liberty interest.

Of

course, I would not argue with a majority of this Court if they
thought otherwise, because that would be a very favorable
result.

But I am unable to argue that in good conscience.
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, what in the affidavit do you

contend affected his liberty interest?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir.

Well, there were four things.

Disobedience of orders? insubordination? causing low moral®?
and engaging in conduct unsuited to an officer.

These are on

page 32-34 of the Appendix, and these, of course, I think
clearly rise to the level of a liberty interest.

You are

saying that a person is deliberately disobedient, that he. is
insubordinate, he is causing low moral© and engaging in whatever
it is, in conduct unsuitable for an officer.
moral tinge to it, I think.

It has a certain

15
Now, I think it would be terribly unjust to allow
the earlier and now admittedly false reasons to control.

I

think the true reasons ought to control, and I think it ought
to be assumed that prospective employers and others who inquired
were given -the true reasons.
QUESTION :

But there is no evidence in the record

that any prospective employer did inquire, is there?
MR. SMITH:

No, there is not.

Of course, this case

comes up on cross motions for summary judgment and presumably
if we go to trial, this is one of the issues that would be
explored.

Clearly, it's a relevant and important issue.
QUESTION:

Did you have an opportunity to do any

MR. SMITH:

We engaged in very limited discovery, and

discovery?

I must say that one line of discovery I did not pursue.
QUESTION:

Aren’t you supposed to think of that at

the time it's in the district court rather than at the time
it’s up here?
MR. SMITH:

Y@s, sirp I concede that I am.

You know,

neither I nor any other lawyer can think of everything that
ought to be thought of at the trial level, and I don’t feel —
I feel -chat there ar® ample reasons for remanding this case
for a determination on the merits and that this is on© of the
things -that would come out in the evidence.
QUESTION:

Was Arnett v. Kennedy cited by the Court

16

of Appeals in connection with the an banc request?
MR» SMITH:

Tii© Arnett case, I believe, your Honor,

had not been decided at the time ©n banc consideration was
granted.

It had just been decided when we argued the case

an banc.

It was not cited, as I recall, in either of the

briefs.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Was it cited by the court?
I do recall Judge Russell asking som©

questions about the Arnett case, and I do recall that I was not
at that time very able to deal with th© questions because the
case was that new.
QDESTIQNs

I thought

the en banc consideration .

it was realXy heard <aa banc, wasn't it?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

That's right.
And it was actually argued.
Yes, it was.
And you think Arnett was or was not cited?
Arnett was cited in oral argument.

The

record would not show that, but the recording of the oral
argument in the Fourth Circuit v/ould.

It was discussed in oral

argument.
QUESTION:

You didn't cite on that even on the

petition for certiorari.
MR. SMITE:
correct.

If your Honor says so, I assume that is

Of course, w© did rely on it in our brief.

17
I do feel this clearly comes under Roth and
Sindermann, and that8s the reason w© are here.

Those cases

should control the outcome of this eas©.
Now, as to whether a mere
QUESTION:

But the district

judge could be viewed

as saying that under State law, even, as long as you fired for
cause, that nevertheless by failing to provide any procedure
other than notice and reasons, that that determined the
procedural entitlement of the employ©©.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
is entitled to.

Yes, sir.
And that under State law, that's all he

How do you think that stands under Arnett?

MR. SMITH:

According to your Honor's opinion, six

members of th© Arnett court, arid I suppose five members of this
Court, would hold that once the property or liberty interest
is defined by State law, that the procedural requirements are
constitutionally defined and are not defined by State law.
That's my reading of th© opinions in Arnett.

And we feel

quit© strongly that this is so, that while State law, of course,
creates certain rights, it's the 14th .Amendment due process
clausa that determines how these rights will be adjudicated
and how they will be determined in th® administrative process.
So wo say chat the full rang© of rights from
Goldberg v. Kelly and other cases, in other words a trial type
hearing, is what is required once th© liberty and property

ie
interests of constitutional magnitude are identified.
The respondents have shown no pressing circumstances,,
such as those present in a prison disciplinary situation or
a public high school disciplinary situation, that would require
any truncating of fch© due process requirements or any shrinkage
of them.

We think that there is ample time and proper place

when an employee is to be deprived of a job to which he has
a 14th Amendment entitlement, we think there is a time and
place for a due process hearing to be held.
Clearly, this was not done in the present case.
Now, even if on® were to look at the plurality
opinion in Arnett, and take the position that whatever source
of the property and liberty interests, or I should say property
interests at stake, that should also be the source for the
procedural requirements, even if one were to taka -that view,
a view which I submit cannot be taken, still the respondents
are deficient and were in violation of the petitioner's rights.
'

-

In th© first place, he was never notified of any

deficiency in his work. At least on summary judgment that
must to© taken because that was petitioner's evidence, although
it was in dispute.
Secondly, fch© written statement didn't contain the
true reasons for discharge? they contained false reasons.
So we feel that the very procedures outlined by th© ordinance
were not adhered to.

19
QUESTION?

You are saying they are false or they

were just not a complet® statement of th© reasons.
MR. SMITHs
weren't complet©.

It would be charitable to say that they

If on© asked for a list of all reasons that

he is terminated and is told he is terminated because of
unsatisfactory work and refusal to attend school, and later
on h@ finds out that he has been terminated for all these
things that implicate his morals and his -QUESTION;

Aren't all those detailed things no more

than specific ingredients of the generic reason of unsatisfactory
work?
MR. SMITHs

I don't think so, your Honor.

I think

one can be terminated for unsatisfactory work and that alone
and that probably doesn't give rise to a liberty interest.
But if the unsatisfactory work consists of deliberat® refusal
to obey orders, insubordination, hostility, all of these
sorts of things *—

In other words, you ar© saying those

MR. SMITHs

Precisely.
My question was wouldn't they b@ subsumed

under the generic reason of unsatisfactory work?
MR. SMITH;

No.
My question is suggesting only that th©

responses weren * t mutually inconsistent but o:i@ was just a

20
bili of particulars, so to speak, and th© other was a nor©
generic — the first on© was a more generic basis.
MR. SMITH?

Well, it is conceivable.

I view them

as being a change of approach, and I view them as the PoliceChief coming out with fch® real reasons and reasons which ar©
basically inconsistent with those first disclosed.

But they

could be regarded as—
QUESTION:

But war© the first set of reasons false?

MR. SMITH:
think

that

I think so, if your Honor pleas®.

I

such a material difference makes them clearly

incomplete, in my view false.
tiie first set is necessary.

I don't think the falsity of
I think the incompleteness

suffices if those reasons which were not disclosed are liberty
implicating reasons or reasons which carry a stigma and tend
to degrads the petitioner's good name, reputation, and honor.
QUESTION:

Under your theory, suppos® you have a

Sindormann type case whsre the plaintiff sues claiming a
guarantee of soma sort of tenure plus a deprivation of First
Amendment rights, that he was fired for reasons impermissible
under the First Amendment, and no reason is ever furnished at
all for his discharge.
more is said.

He is simply discharged and nothing

Arid then at the hearing on the motion for

summary judgment in the case, in order to rebuff the First
.Amendment argument made by the plaintiff, the respondent employer
sets forth the real reasons that he discharged him, which had

21
not been made known to anybody up to now.

Do you think at

that point the employee has an additional claim based on a
deprivation of a liberty interest because of something
the respondent —
MR. SMITH t

I think if the real reasons are stigmatizing

that that brings the right to a hearing into play.

I donst

think -that the employer should be allowed to benefit or to be
shielded as a result of either his falsehood or his inaccuracy
of his first description.
QUESTION s

I think -that would be unfair.

Even though it never would have come out

unless the employee had brought a lawsuit?
MR. SMITHs

I certainly believe that, your Honor.

I think whenever or however it comes out, if it comes out in
such a way as to come within the test set up in Perry and Roth,
I think then he is to be accorded his rights.
QUESTION %
Perry specifically

1 rather thought that Perry and Roth. —held that if a government, State or

Federal, terminated an employee upon the purported ground of
some stigmatizing reason, such as you are being fired because
you embezzled money, that -the termination upon that purported
and publicised ground is what invaded a colorabis liberty
interest and that what entitled the employes to a hearing to
show whether or not h© might have been terminated, he didn't
embezzle the money.
But here, as my Brother Retmquist suggests, we don’t

have that situation»
MR. SMITH s

emphatically deny that any of these charges are true as set

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Burgin.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES E. BURGIN
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. BURGIN:
th® Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I begin my presentation to this Court with an

assumption.

I am her© ora bahalf of the City of Marion . and

its two officials who were sued in their representative
capacities under the Civil Rights Act. and under th© amount-incontroversy statute 28 U.S.C. 3.331.
The first, assumption that I make is that by th©
reply brief filed by th© petitioner, th® petitioner has now
conceded that th® city cannot be reached under 42 U.S.C. 1983

24
in this cass.
Th© second concession that feh© petitioner has made
in his reply brief is that the state of th® record at this
point is not sufficient for a proper determination of whether
or not jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S. 1331.

And unless

the Court has some questions with regard to those two matters,
then I shall attempt to confine my discussion of th© case to
other portions of the case.
May it. pleas© th® Court, Mr. Bishop, th© petitioner
in this case, was hired as a policeman by the City of Marion
in June of 1963.

At the time he was hired, thar© was no

Personnel Ordinance.

This Personnel Ordinane© that we are

now talking about was adopted on April 4, 1970, some 10 months
later.

Th® petitioner was discharged after having been

employed for two years and 10 months.
March 31, 1972.

He was discharged on.

He 'thereafter brought suit against the city

and hs brought suit against th© two officials in thoir
representative capacity.
How, w© make a point about 'that in our brief, and we
have from the vary start of these proceedings, that —
before I gat into that, I have the permission of my brother
counsellor, here to advise th© Court of two more facts,
The Chief of Police, one of the respondents in this
cass, Mr. Wood, was disabled by a stroke and is no longer
employed by feh© City of Marion.

He ceased working on November 17,

25
1972.

The other respondent, th© City Manager, left the City
>

of Marion on November 30, 1972, and has taken a position as
City Manager with another city in North Carolina.
QUESTIONS
take it.

You represent these two individuals, I

You are their attorney, in other words.
MS. BURGIN; Yes, your Honor.

Yes, sir.

We have contended in part one of our brief that
because this suit has been directed against th© municipality
and against two of its officers in their representative
capacities, that th© Federal district court had no jurisdiction
under 42 U.S.C. 1983 by its jurisdictional counterpart
28 U.S. 1543.
We have contended throughout, and we do still contend,
that this suit is not ox?.ly in form but is in substance against
th© city and that these officials who are named, th© City
Manager and the Chief of Police, ar© named only in their
nominal capacities as representatives.
QUESTION:

What do you mean, nominal capacities as

representatives?
MR. BURGIN.:
your Honor.

That they were the agents of the city,

They carried out. th® provisions of th© ordinance.

They are named to get to the city.
QUESTION:

But if you take Monroe v. Pape, a case

like that where they held you couldn't recover against the
City of Chicago, this Court held* you could, I take it, recover

26

against individual policemen in that case.

I would think in

your case, although you can't recover against the city, you
could recovery against the named individuals if they were city
officials.

Monetary damages ar© sought, as I understand it.
MR. BURGIN:

point.

Your Honor, w© take issue with that

We think that monetary damages are not sought.
QUESTION:

Who fired the man?

MR. BURGIW:

The Chief of Police, your Honor.

QUESTION:

But you said he is suing the city.

I

would assume he is suing whoever fired him.
MR. BURGIN:
QUESTION:

Well, th® ~~
Who filed th© affidavit?

MR. BURGIN;

The Chief of Police, and Idle City Manager,

QUESTION:

So they are not responsible for that?

MR. BURGIN;

They ar© responsible for the affidavit,

yes.
QUESTION:

And responsible for firing him.

MR. BURGIN;

They are responsible for firing him only

in the sense that they were acting in a representative capacity
as only th© city could act.

They carried out the provisions

of the ordinance which was their duty to do so.
QUESTION:

But. they did the firing,
\

MR. BURGIN:
QUESTION:
capacity who?» he sued

Yes, sir,
^ou say it goes to representative

them for damages for firing him, and I

27

understand fch© petitioner6s position to be that what he said
in that letter amounted to libel.

Am I right?

The city

wouldn't be responsible for that, would it?

MR. BURGIN:

For the libel?
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Who would ba —
We say it is notin fact a libel.
If it was, who would be liable?
Well —
Th© man who wrote tha libel would be.

city.
QUESTION:
MR. BURGIN:

But you say he's not in this case'.
He is not in this case in his individual

capacity.
Your Honor, to get back to your question, Mr. Justice
Rsehnquist, damages against these individuals as individuals
we contend are not requested.
QUESTION:

Mr. Burgin,

Judge Jones' opinion at

page 12 of the petition for writ of certiorari, first paragraph
of his opinion, says, referring to the petitioner, "He seeks
an order requiring the defendants to reemploy him and a monetary
award of damages consisting of his wages from March 31, 1972,
to the date of judgment."
MR. BURGIN;

Yes, your Honor.

28
QUESTION:

Don’t you regard that as a prayer for

damages?
MR. BURGIN:

No, your Honor.

prayer for back wages.

I regard that as a

I think the petitioner regards it

thusly also, because in his brief, and we have put this in
our brief -- in the petitioner’s brief on page 6 of the
petitioner’s brief, he states that he is seeking reinstatement
and back pay.
QUESTION:

What’s the difference between back pay

or back wages and damages in a case like this?
MR. BURGIN:

Well, in our mind, if your Honor please,

there is a great deal of difference.

Back pay can only come

from the city.
QUESTION:

Well, that may be true, but Judge Jones’

opinion talked about damages.

I take it if one of the

individual defendants in this case wrongfully and
unconstitutionally fired th© petitioner, he might be libel for
damages even though he, not being the city, could not pay
"wages.”
MR. BURGIN:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
Damages would be measured by the lost

pay.
MR. BURGIN:

That’s right.

But we say, if your

Honor please, that that’s net what they are asking for, that
they are asking for — that the word ’’damages ” is not

29
controlling.

The word "back pay" is.

They don’t say

"damages in fch® form of back pay," they say "damages consisting
of back pay."
QUESTION;

In any event, I hope you are going to

save sufficient time to argue the merits.
MR. BURCIN;

Yes, your Honor.

I will get to the

merits at this time.
I simply point out one case in support of our
position which we think that the principles enunciated in the
case are in support of the -principles which I have just
stated, and that was a case decided by this Court in 1949,
Larson v. Domestic and Foreign Commerce Corporation in 337 U.S.
682 in which it was stated that the actions of an officer,
if not in conflict with the terms of his valid statutory
authority are the actions of the sovereign.
With regard to part three of our brief, the question
of whether or not this policeman had a property interest, we
start with the premise of the Federal district court which we
think is a correct premise that the respondents complied with
this ordinance and applicable State lav/ in discharging Mr.
Bishop.

We say that the Court —
QUESTION:

Would it have complied with fell© State

if in response to a request to give the reason for the
discharge the city said, "We didn’t have any'5?
MR. BURG-IN;

Yes, sir, I think it would.

30

QUESTION:

So that you can be fired at will

without cause at all under the Ordinance.
MR. BURGIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And if you said you didn’t have any,

that’s the end of the case.
MR. BURGIN:
QUESTION:

I think so.
Do you think that's what the district

court meant when h© said that employees may be fired at will?
MR. BURGIN:

I think v©s, sir.

There is no question

in my mind that that was the meaning and the intent of the
i

word used by the district judge,
QUESTION:

What if in response to the request they

say, 13You were fired for inefficiency."
MR. BURGIN:

Inefficiency?

I think, if your

Honor please, that is something -that does not, ris© to the
level of a protected constitutional property interest.

That

is something that should be handled purely and simply by the
supervisor -QUESTION:

What if the answer was you were fired

because you were habitually negligent?
MR. BURGIN:

I still say that has no more implica-

tion than inefficiency.
If your Honor please, I know you alluded to that
very thing in the Arnett case.
somewhat like this.

I think this is a case

I think the principle would apply here.

31
I think you also alluded in the Arnett case to an 1856 case,
Ex parte Secum, in which employment was conditioned upon
maintaining proper respect for courts and court officials .
Now, w@ say that this man was discharged for unsatisfactory
work.

Satisfactory work would be on a par with satisfactory

respect that was to be paid to someone.

We do think that the

State law — Mr. Bishop has maintained throughout this
proceeding, as I understand his contention, that he had a
property interest in his job because, number on®, he was a
permanent employe©, number two, that during the entire term
of his employment no other policeman on the 17-man police
force had been discharged, and number three, because h©
reasonably believed that he would not be discharged.

Now that,

I understand from the pleadings in the case and from the briefs
that they have filed, is his position.
Wa say that North Carolina law disposes of his
strongest argument in that respect, his strongest argument
being the fact that he was a permanent employee.

Cur law in

the State of North Carolina holds that permanent employment
without more means nothing more than aa indefinite general
hiring which may be terminable at the will of either party
irrespective of quality of performance.

We sa.y that Mr. .Bishop

had no more than a subjective expectancy 'that he would continue
to be employed and that that is not protected by procedural
due process of the 14th Amendment.

<

32

With regard to the liberty interest we have
maintained that the statuta was followed#and the district
court judg©#cn page 15 of the petition for writ of certiorari#
states there is no contention that th® provisions of this
article were not complied with by the defendant.
QUESTION:

Does that answer 'th© claim of the

deprivation of liberty?

Let’s say that th© statute provided,

that an employee could be discharged only on the basis of
gross dishonesty or immorality# and let’s assume an employee
was terminated on the basis of a claim that he had embezzled
some money and therefore was gross3.y dishonest.

That would

be in scrupulous accord with the statute# but still might
deprive, him of a liberty interest that would entitle him to a
hearing to sea whether or not he had been guilty of embezzlement
or not.

In other words# following the statute doesn’t really

fully respond to the claim of a deprivation of liberty without
due process of law# does it?
MR. BURGINs

I concur in that statement completely#

but I do say that w@ havs in discharging him implicated his
liberty in no way.
QUESTION:
MR. BURGIN:

That’s a different point.
Yes# sir.

We have

I think that th®

time to determine whether or not a liberty interest is
implicated is at the time of his discharge.

I do not think

that th® cases of — well, I do not think that the reasons for

33
discharge implicate his liberty in any manner.
And 1 point out to the Court this fact.

When Mr.

Bishop was discharged, at his request he was given a letter
setting forth the reasons.

Now, he had that letter in his

possession, and if ha wanted to show it to a prospective future
employer, h@ very well could, and th© public records statute,
I believe it's General Statute 33, would give any employer,
prospective future employer, th© right to see that.
QUESTIONS

I gather what you are saying, getting back

to Mr. Justice Stewart's question, if in the judicial
proceeding, rather than as h@ did testify, the police chief
testified, "Well, really, we discharged him because he was
an embezzler."

You would still say that there was no invasion

of liberty.
MR. BURGIN:

Absolutely.

Yes, your Honor.

I would

say there had been no invasion of his liberty..
QUESTIONS

Because they didn't tell him the truth

whan they said they discharged him only for unsatisfactory work.
MR. BURGIN;

Well, your Honor, respectfully I think

that may be an assumption.
QUESTION;
hypothetical.

I*m putting to you a question, a

They gave him th® letter they gave him.

The

fact the Chief testified on in the judicial proceeding was that,
no, that wasn't th© reason? th© real reason was he was an
embezzler.

34
MR. BURGIHs

I do not think, if your Honor please,

number one, because it's a judicial proceeding? number two,
because it would have been brought by th® petitioner, that the
liberty interests would be implicated in that case.
I think th© liberty interests are implicated and I
cannot recall, but I believe there is some language in the
■Roth case or S inderm arm case, maybe th® Arnett case that
implies, at least implies, that at th© time of discharge is
t

what is important.

If at that time his liberty interests were

implicated, that's one thing.
QUESTION;

In this case they were not.

Suppose the situation had been that there

were a lot of rumors around town that he had embezzled funds,
then th© Police Chief — I say suppose this -- then the
Police Chief discharges him witty a letter which simply says,
"You are discharged for unsatisfactory work."
MR. BUKGXN;

There would be no difference in that

hypothesis than th® one you posed earlier, in my mind.
QUESTION;

How long after the new ordinance was

passed did his termination occur?
MR. BURG INs
years.

Was it 10 months?

About two years, a little over two

Th® ordinance was adopted in April of '70 and he was

terminated in March, end of March, '72,
QUESTION;

You say that his rights, his situation

is different from that of a person employed on th® same job
after the ordinance was passed, or ares they in th© same boat?

35
MR, BURGINs

No, your Honor»

I would say that I

have not intended that below this Court.
now that Mr. Bishop

I would not contend

is not a permanent employee and that the

situation would be the same with regard to th© hypothesis that
you put to me if the two individuals had passed the six-month
period.
Unless the Court has some further questions of me,
that concludes my presentation,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

You have a minute left, Mr. Smith.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT CF NORMAN B. SMITH ON
BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. SMITHi

If your Honor please, I did save the

time, but I know of no particular comment I wish to make.
I think I covered the points in my opening argument, unless
there any remaining questions.
We thank the Court.
QUESTION:

Well, counsel, your colleague says that

under the controlling ordinance the city needn't have any
cause, for discharge at all.
MR. SMITH%

1 think hs is just plain wrong.

I

think you can look at th© ordinance and see that you have to
fall into on© of four categories before you can b© —
QUESTION:

Well, how do you explain the judge's

statement that an employee may be discharged at will?

36

MR. SMITH;

The judge is just wrong. He is not

reading fch© statute or not reading it correctly.

But it just

seems to me that in any way —
QUESTION
cause.

H© didn't say that he could be fired without

%

He said h© could b© fired at will, which could mean

with only notice without a hearing.
MR. SMITH;

I presume that "at will" and "without

cause" is the same thing.

It would be wrong to think that

one had to have cause to discharge someone and then say he
could do it at will anyway.

That would negate the force of

the clause.
QUESTION;

Well, h® could do it at will, just on

MR. SMITH;

I suppose that's/possible construction,

but not of this ordinance.

Any way you turn this ordinance,

it says that -chare must be on®
QUESTION;

That isn’t what the district judge says.

MR. SMITH;

Your Honor, I respectfully contend he

is wrong and that Judge Winter is right and that this Court
ought to reverse.

Work not up to standard, negligence,

inefficiency, or unfitness have to exist.
QUESTION;

If we agree with the district judge, on

your reading of the district judge, I take it that you would
say that if w© agreed with him, that you lose.
MR. SMITH;

I think if you agread with everything he

above-entitled matter were concluded.)
