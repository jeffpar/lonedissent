P R 0 C E E DING S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear argument in

74-94:0# Colorado River Water Conservation District against
the United States and the

consolidated case.

Mr » Balcomb, you may proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH BALCQMB ON BEHALF
j

OF PETITIONERS

MR. BALCOMB;
the Court:
•

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it please

These two petitions here consolidated arose out

■:

of on® case below in the United States District Court# some of the
petitioners joining in all of the petitions here and some
separately# and of course have by the Court been consolidated.
All petitioners involved join in the opening brief
hare# in the reply brief# and have agreed that this one argument
will suffice for all.
At Appendix B in the petition in 74-490# the last
page# 41-A# was a small map which shows a large portion of
western Colorado# that is western Colorado west of the
Continental Divide# and was intended to show in relief
Water Division No. 7.
QUESTION %

That was the same as has been furnished us

now on the bench# isn't it?
MR. BALCOMBs

Aren't these identical?

With this exception# v© have asked the

clerk to distribute xerox copies of it upon which we have
roughly superimposed the boundaries of Water Divisions 4# 5# and 6,

4
QUESTION?

I see.

MR. BALCOMB;

To emphasize and illustrate some

later discussion.
The entire geographic area of Colorado west of the
Continental Divide is tributary to the Colorado River, and this,
of course, includes that area in Water Division No. 7.
Since the 1971 decisions in this Court in Eagle
County and Water Division No. 5, the United Stat.es has been
proving up on its claims of all nature and from whatever source
they might have been derived, including their reserve rights in
Water Divisions 4, 5, and 6 and the water courts: in those
divisions.

They have not, however, done so to date in

Water Division No. 7.
If the Court will remember, in 1969 the Colorado
legislature abandoned the water district method of adjudication
of water-- there were then some 70 water districts

and

established seven divisions for such purpose, each .division
embracing for practical purposes major water sheds or major
tributary water sheds to a major river.

The 1969 Act in

pertinent part is reproduced as Appendix C at page 42 of the
petition for certiorari in 74-949, which was made by the State
of Colorado and others.
I have the feeling that neither in 1971 nor to date
does the Solicitor General8s office clearly understand the
present adjudicatory statute in Colorado, that is, the 1969 Act^

5
because when it went into effect on July 1, 1969 , the water
courts were open for business on a continuing basis, as contrasted
to the previous law requiring an affirmative action of opening
an adjudication in a particular water district.

So the United

States could have filed its claims in middle 1969 in Water
Division 7,and certainly after this Court’s decision in Eagle
County and Water Division 5 could have been expected so to do.
Instead, on November 14, 1972, the United States
filed what can only be denominated as a quiet title action in
th© United States District Court for the District of Colorado
asserting th® claims of the United States as to waters of th©
San Juan River naming almost 1,000 other users and unknown
number of unknown persons.

The claims, such as in Water

Districts 4, 5, and 6, are varied and include national
monuments, force, appropriate rights under State law, and
finally claims on behalf of the Southern Ute and the Ute
Mountain Ute Indian Reservation.
Very promptly thereafter, in December of 1972, the
United States was served pursuant to th© McCarran Amendment
in Water Division No» 7 proceedings, whereupon, they filed
claims similar in nature, except as to th© Indian reservation
claims, as to their rights on th© Dolores River, which is -the
other principal tributary arising in Water Division 7 to the
Colorado River.
Ml petitioners her© move to dismiss the Federal court

6

action, which the district court did orally from the bench,
referring specifically to the intent of

.. Me Carr an and to

the two previous unanimous decisions of this Court in Bagla
County and Water Division 5»

The: district court found that it

should apply comity and abstention because Colorado had a
well-defined and workable system relating to the questions at
hand developed over 100 years.

Th® U.S. had been served and

under McCarran that was all that was required, a point I think
that was admitted on Monday in connection with th® Pupfish case
by th© Solicitor General's office.
The solution to be granted by the Federal court will
be piecemeal only and would result in a duality of adjudication
within on© water division.
QUESTION:

What did the district court do?

MR. BALCGMB:
QUESTION:

What did the .district court do?

MR. BALCOMBs
QUESTION:

Sir?

It dismissed.

Well, that's more than just abstention.

They dismissed.the case*
MR. BALCOMBs

They dismissed, I believe, on the

grounds of comity,
QUESTIONs

And with the idea that any Federal claims

to water rights“would be submitted to th® State court.
MR. BALCQMB:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

I mean, even any claims that were

7
controlled by Federal law.
MR. BALCGMBs

Yss, sir, as they are doing in 4 , 5, and

6.

QUESTION:

That’s what the two cases held, Eagle

and Water District»

Eagle and Water District contemplated

that Federal claims foe submitted to the State proceedings.
MR. BALCOMBs
QUESTION;

I'n the State court by Federal law.

Right.

MR. HALCOMB;

And fchs district court below so found

they must apply Federal law.
In effect, they followed what we believe the rule in
Burford that if a State regulatory system was involved, that
it was up to the State to see that the regulation was proper.
But th® real basis for his decision was the
impracticability of assuming jurisdiction, and his complete
oral opinion is set forth in ?4“94

petition at 17-A.

Th© Court of Appeals' opinion is set forth in the
petition, in that same petition, 74-79» 74-790, at 1-A,

:h,e

Court of Appeals’ opinion cannot be said to be at very great
disparity with th® district court and did not rule that
jurisdiction was Federal, or was exclusive in th® Federal court,
or the State court for that matter, but substituted in its own
©pinion a disagreement as to th® result of abstention and
ignored comity entirely.
We cannot help but feel that this Court had already

8
settled this problem that is again before it.

The Government

has brought us back and has raised additional.' points which
namely attempt to reargue in the application of MeCarran to
the Federal reserve right which the Court has already ruled
upon.» effectively again attempting to again raise the possi­
bility that fair treatment will not be accorded them in the
State court, which this Court has already ruled emphatically
on,

just dismissed that problem out of hand, and are

using, we feel, the problem of separate Indian reserve water
rights as a springboard to take all Federal cases, Federal
reserve rights and adjudicatory rights, back into th© Federal
court which this Court affectively dropped them out of.
QUESTIONS

But in Eagle th© Government was a

defendant, wasn't it, Mr. Baleomb?
MR. BALCOMB;
QUESTION;

Th® defendant?

Yes.

And her® the» Government is a

plaintiff.
MR. HALCOMB;

In the sens© that a person is a

defendant in a water matter, yes, sir.
QUESTION;

But they wore a main defendant in the

Bagla case.
MR. BALCOMB;
QUESTION;

In this eas©?

In the Eagle case.

MR. HALCOMB:

No, but they are also defendants in

the Water Division 7 case pending now in the —

9

QUESTION?

That's the new cne.

That's the or»© that

was filed after the Federal ..
MR. HALCOMB?
QUESTIONS

Yes.

But in the proceeding that was going on

before the Federal case was filed# it was not a defendant.
It could have gone in and filed its claim# but it was not a
defendant.
MR. HALCOMB %

That’s correct.

But our point is that they have been putting into
effect in Water Division 7 a dual system of adjudication.
QUESTION:

Y©s # but tiie United States has another

claim# I take it# that whatever **»<?•>*> said about reserve
rights and submitting then to a State court# whatever it said
doesn't apply where Indian water rights &r© involved.
MR. BALCGMB:

Y«s, sir# but they jumped over that

problem themselves when they filed

not. only

clams for

the two Indian reservations but the whole shooting match#
including &«ijudicatory rights# rights they acquired under
\
State law.

Had they confined themselves to Indian# that might

h© on© problem# although we think it still would have been in
violation of McCarran.

But they didn’t do that.

They only

took one river.
QUESTIONS

But you have that special problem in here

even if the adjudicatory right — even if certain United States
rights should be submitted to State courts# the United States

10
says that the Indian rights should not be*
MR» BMiCQMBs

It5s our position, and I think this was

admitted by, as I say, the Solicitor General's office at.the
pupfish case that Nevada could still commence an action under
McCarran in Nevada and make the United States com®
QUESTION;

Yes, but that didn't involve Indian rights*

MR, BAhCOMBs
in»

in and

Mo, but they could still make fcham com©

So w© filed an action now in Water Division 7 and we say

they should automatically file all their claims, because that's
what this Court said in Eagle.
QUESTION:

Even if the United States agreed with

you about all the rights except Indian rights, they don't
agree with you about Indian rights»
MR, BAXsCOMB;
QUESTION %

1 agree, but then if they ~

And Eagle didn't have Indian rights.

MR. BALCQMB:

Eagle excluded Indian rights.

In fact, I think the United States wanted them included,
anticipating they would very possibly win that case and they
wanted all th® reserve rights covered by th® win, and they
lost.
QUESTIONi

They did.

MR. BALCOMBs

The point here, w© believe, .

been conclusively decided, as I said, and I think so also
did the district court in its oral opinion.

Th® Court of

has

11
Appeals did not: disagree with that, but merely said that the
district court should not have abstained, and as 1 say, ignored
fch© problem of Federal-State relationship, the federalism
theory that is recognised in comity.
We disagree with the conclusion, obviously, of the
Court of Appeals and think they should be reversed for all of
the practical considerations used by the district court, and he
used that word —
QUESTION s

You are suggesting -that even were they

right on classical abstention, there being no constitutional
questions, that even on that basis there was no reason to
abstain.

Nevertheless, comity principles require deference

to the State proceedings.
MR. BALCQMB:

But we think also that abstention could

have been used as a ground and —
QUESTION:

I gather even -- of course, there is no

constitutional —
MR. BALCQMB5
QUESTION:

Sir?

■

There is no constitutional question to be

avoided by abstention here, is there?
MR. BALCQMB;
QUESTION;

No.

But there would be Federal questions.

I mean abstention, you usually abstain to let State questions
be decided, not. Federal questions, and reserve rights are
Federal questions.

12
MR. BALCQMBs

Yes, but. we have a specific statute here.

QUESTION:

That's something els© again.

I agree with

QUESTION:

1 was just trying to get why it was --

that.

from what you said, I thought you were suggesting that even if
you are wrong, that abstention may have been --- at least comity
should have led them to defer to the state courts.
MR. BALCOMBs

Your State regulatory system, he had

numerous other claimants of water involved and a very complicated
situation

which ~
v.

QUESTION:

Especially as in the MeCarr&n Act.

MR. BALCOMBs

Yes.

And you have a special Federal

statute authorizing the State court to proceed.
QUESTION:

Then there was an ongoing basin adjudica­

tion in the Colorado courts, but the United States was not a
party defendant at the time it filed its suit.
MR. BALCOMBs:

They had not been served under McCarran,

and I think a very similar situation as far as this is
concerned was in Pacific Live Stock where the Federal court
•stopped its action and let the State court proceed.

And it

was an adjudication proceeding.
QUESTION:

But they were served in a State suit

soon after the Federal court suit was filed.
MR.. BALCOMBs

I think it was approximately the 15th

of December they were served and

13

QUESTION:

And it was before anything substantial

had happened in the Federal court.
MR. BALCOMB:

I -chink, five defendants were served and

there never has been one shred of evidence takea, and those
defendants were the State bodies, an

important part of which

are missing.
QUESTION:

You haven't cited, I believe, our opinion

last term in Hicks v, Miranda where the Court held that in the
comity situation of Federal courts deferring to State
constitutional adjudications even though the Federal court
proceeding commenced first,, if nothing much had happened in th©
Federal court proceeding, the Federal court should- still defer
to the State.
MR. BALCOMB:

I believe we cite it at page 27 of our

opening brief, your Honor.
QUESTION:
Pardon me.

Oh, I apologize.

I didn't realise it.

You ar© absolutely right.

I was reading across

the wrong line.
QUESTION:

In any. event, you don't like the race to

the courthouse aspect that the Solicitor General —
MR. BALCOMB:

I think as a doctrine it's frowned upon,

and in this particular —
QUESTION:

Hicks had a criminal case in a State

court and this is civil, but you have the McCarran Act wholly
aside from Younger v. Harris and cases like that.

You've got

14
the McCarran Act that says -the Federal Government should
litigat® its interests in the State court.
MR. BALCOMB;

I didn9t want to go into it, of course,,

because it6 s our position that no matter what the Federal
reserve right is, it should have been adjudicated in the State
court, and as soon as service is made they must start their
proceedings in the State court.

Realising from the position

of the Government they were going to go into that question, we
then attempted to revisit in our reply brief a little bit of
McCarran, but it was exhaustively covered, as the Court will
remember, in th© briefs in Eagle County, all of the legislative
history.
I think it can be unquestionably said that, first of
all, Mr. McCarran was concerned very much about Indians in all of
the hearings that were held. "Indian” is not appearing on ovary
page but certainly ware considered again and. again and again
and considered to be included by th© Justice Department, by the
Department of th© Interior, by the OMB reporting for the
President., everybody, and we have made citations in our reply
brief to that effect.
Second of all, we believe that when this Court acted
on the cases, they thought that Indians were involved in the
Federal reserve rights.

The Indians themselves thought so, as

our brief would indicata, because in th© 1971 what I call
Kennedy hearings that they ware concerning various Indian rights,

15
a great hue and cry was mad© about fch© fact that Eagle County
and Water Division 5 covered the Indian water rights.

And the

Court will remember that some of th@ Indians themselves thought
so because they filed a novel piece of paper in a big red
binder in which they wanted to express an interest in the case
and suggested this Court had no jurisdiction because they had
covered Indians by the decisions.

And all the way up to now,

up to the last hearings, the Indians have been sure that they
were covered, until.all of a sudden whan the last Government
brief and the amici brief for-the Indians was filed herein,
they raise other defenses than that.
As X say, that9s fch® Government9 s defense to this
problem.

It’s not our —» w© didn't want to reargue McCarran,

we didn't think it was necessary, we. didn't think this Court
should have to bother with it again.

And we think this is

merely a guisa to try to get the adjudication of‘Federal reserve
rights back in, the? Federal courts if they can beat us to the
courthouse.
QUESTION;

May I ask you.

I notice you recite that

the United States in filing its reserve rights included
national forests.
MR. BALCOMBs
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

Tell me how you — I take it what they are

saying is that,if you want to analogize

to putting something

to beneficial use, once you have taken something from the

18

public domain, you’ve automatically announced your intention
of using whatever water you need for that purpose.
MR. BALCQMB:
QUESTIONs

Yes, sir.

We have no quarrel with that.

Now, what kind of a water right do you

claim for a national forest?
MR. BALCQMB:

They are claiming the esthetic value

of flowing streams, the right to control headgate diversions
or storage of water on national forests to make ~
QUESTION:

I take it you don’t have any quarrel with

the idea that the Federal Government in a national forest can
keep the States from covering up the national forest with a
dam.

I'm not sure you -Go ahead.

You say they can claim to maintain the

level of the flowing stream.
MRP BALCOMBs Yes, sir, and to require a bypass for
fishary purposes, for esthetic purposes, and all of that, of a
certain quantity.
QUESTION:

But as far as beneficial us® of water is

concerned.
MR. BALCOMB:

They claim those to be beneficial uses

under Federal —
QUESTION:

I know, but it isn’t a consumptive us«? at

all for a national forest.
MR. BALCOMB:

Only to th© extent that it might create

a little evaporation which is of benefit also.

17
QUESTIONi

Yes, but under, I suppose, on navigable

streams, if there is going fco fos a dam, it's going to bs
approved by the — who does it have to be approved, by?
MR. BALCOMB:
Service.

Th@ Department of Agriculture, Forest

You have to get a special use permit.
QUESTIONS

They have to do -that even without a water

right.
MR. BALCOMB:

That's correct.

Many structures were

built before the special us© thing cams into existence, and the
United States is claiming a right to antedate the law.
QUESTIONS

I suppose if there was some proposal

to

divert water from on© water shad to another and lower the
level of the flowing stream through a national forest, there
might be a complaint.
MR. BALCOMB:

Yes, sir, and that, of course, is one

of fcha. problems they are having in the lower court, because
this is exactly what Twin Lakes is doing and exactly what the
city and County of Denver is doing, and Colorado Springs, and
so forth..

And they are litigating this in the lower courts.

How it's going to come out I don't know.

It's bean four years

in progress.
There, is an awful lot of 'them.

I could describe to

you the printout that the Forest Service alone filed on the
right of a national forest.

It was approximately an inch

thick, and I don't know how many rights it contains.

When you

18

totaled it all up* it amounted to about a thousand acre feet
?

of water and a hundred/second feet of direct flow presently in
use.

It covers a variety of things like stock watering holas

and the like»
Well* as I indicated, w@ would like to see the
district court judgments reinstated, and itas at 2G~A in our
petition, for the totality of the reasons expressed under
abstention or by comity as the district court said, which I
think also is very similar to the language used by Mr» Justice
?
Douglas in his opinions in the Eagle County and Darrell case.
QUESTION:

You argued those oases.

MR. BALCGMB;
QUESTIONi

Sir?

You were here in those two cases, both of

them.
MR. 3ALC0MB2
QUESTION s

Yes.

And won them.

Unanimously.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Shapiro.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD E. SHAPIRO ON
BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. SHAPIRO;
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I think the issue in this case is narrow.

Xfc*s

whether the district court should have dismissed the United
States6 complaint for determination of its water rights and
those of its Indian wards.
The merits of the Federal reserve rights doctrine are

19
not before fch© Court.

This is a question of Federal jurisdic-

tion.
QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, the merits of that

pupfish

claim that your colleague, Mr. Randolph, argued on Monday were
before us, and there may be some spillover, at least in th©
minds of some of us, between the two.

I notice on page 7 of

the Government's brief that th® Government assarts apparently
a reserve right, a water claim by reason of reservation of
the San Juan National Forest, which as I recall is a huge area
in southwestern Colorado.
Now, what's th© nature of th® Government’s reserved
right claim whan it's talking simply about a national forest?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Th® basic claim is for stock watering,

camp sites, th® preservation of streams as water sources for
wildlife, at cetera.

The demands, the total demands, of the

national forest for water in that context are relatively narrow.
In fact, thete is a study which was prepared in 1969 for the
use of the Public Land Law Poview Commission which is described,
at page 844 of Dean, ^release*- case book on Water Law, 1974
edition, and it points out that even if you take all of 'th®
Government's Federal reserve rights as of 1969 --QUESTIONS

Yon mean all the rights it claimed?

MR. SHAPIRO:

All rights, th© Indian rights — well,

the entire range of Federal reservations-- you com® out with
a percentage of something like, well, 2.2 million acre feet out

20

of 363 million, acre feet that arise in the eleven Western
States where most of the water comes from, and that, amounts to
less than 1 percent of the total.
Now, I should say in candor that there is a problem
about shale oil because if shale is developed, the water
demands are going to bo high in tine shale areas,

But I under­

stand the Federal Government has indicated to the companies
that will exploit that they are going to have to get their
own appropriated rights under.State procedures.
Now, returning to this case -QUESTION?

1 doubt if even the Government would have

the nerve to go in and say that because we remove certain
property from the-public domain and made it a national forest,
we intended at the time to reserve enough water to develop
shale.
MR. SHAPIRO?

X think that's right, your Honor,

although there is & reservation — there are some reservations,
may be reservations, which were put asid© as shale oil
reservations„
QUESTION:

That may be.

MR. SHAPIRO:

That's different,

That is different.

And that really

gets us down to what the reserved rights doctrine is about,
1 might as well state it very briefly.
by the purpose of the reservation,

It's always qualified

tod really what we are

seeking in this case is relatively narrow.

What our complaint

21

asks is that t.h© Federal court determine three things
affirmatively for the United Statess
Number one, it determine the purpose of the various
Federal reservations we have alleged in our complaint.

I think

examination of that complaint which is set forth in the
petition for cert will show that all except perhaps two of the
claims ar® reserved rights claims.
QUESTIONS

It might help me if — you would be her©

making the same argument, 1 taka it, even if you had been
served as a defendant in a State adjudication prior to the
beginning of the Federal suit, and even if you had filed your
claims, as Eagle taid you had to do in that litigation, you
would still b© here saying you could file in the Federal court
and have the Federal court adjudicate the three questions that
you were about to tell ns.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Not quite, your Honor.

If we were

made a party in a McCarran Act proceeding before we filed in
the Federal suit, then the State court would have jurisdiction,
and Eagle County and Water Division 5 make that clear, with
one exception.

I must state the exception.

QUESTION:

Indian water rights.

MR. SHAPIROr
QUESTIONS

Right.

You say the McCarran Act doesn’t, reach

Indian water rights at all, the State courts have no juris­
diction whatsoever to adjudicate Indian water rights.

22
MR. SHAPIRO:

Or perhaps qualifying it another way*

even if McCarran waives immunity for Indian rights, it would
waive it only in Federal courts.

Well, the McCarran Act on

its face doesn't restrict itself to State courts, State or
Federal.
QUESTION:

You don't have any authority for that I

guess.
MR. SHAPIRO:

What?

That it would apply to Federal

courts as well?
QUESTION:

No, that the McCarran Act didn’t intend

them to
MR. SHAPIRO:
have authority for it.

To reach Indian rights?

I think I do

Perhaps I should turn to it,

although

our position-is that you don’t need to reach it in this case
if you agree with our contention
QUESTION:

I know.

MR.SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Let's turn to it now.
You just, say because you got to the

courthouse first, the Federal court can go ahead.
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That's part of the argument.

Even though nothing had happened in the

Federal court of substance.
%

MR. SHAPIRO:

That’s right, which is not much

different than any other plaintiff who has a choice of a forum,
Federal or State, who chooses a Federal forum.

23

QUESTION:

This goes beyond

that proposition.

It is

that they not only can, but the Federal court must proceed.
MR. SHAPIRO:

That8s right, in the circumstances here

because none of the considerations of the abstention doctrine
and comity doctrine clash.
QUESTION:

We have gotten close to, but have never

really faced up to whether Younger v. Harris is going to apply
in a civil
MR. SHAPIRO:

That's right.

The closest you have

come is with the nuisance litigation involving obscenity
in cases like Huffman v. Pursue last year.
QUESTION:

Quasi-criminal, so to speak.

MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

I beg your pardon?

Quasi-criminal, or a case in which the

Why is that?

MR. SHAPIRO;
QUESTIONS

Because th® Dolores River

I know, but why are those th© only ones

that you submitted?
MR. SHAPIROs

Those are the only ones we have

submitted because th© Dolores River is geographically separate
from the tributaries of th© San Juan which all run through the
Indian reservations.

We have tried to put all our claims with

respect to the tributaries of the San Juan in one proceeding.

The Dolores is geographically separate.

The only claims we have

on the Dolores, which runs to the Northwest, are claims, I think,
for the western part of the forest.

What did you do with the second sentence

of the McCarran Act?

The United States, when a party to any

such suit, shall (1) be deemed to have waived any right to
plead that the State laws are inapplicable where the United
States is not amenable thereto by reason of its sovereignty
and shall be subject to the judgments, orders, and decrees of

MR. SHAPIRO:

MR. SHAPIRO :

The language is limited to the waiver

of sovereign immunity where we are a defendant.

That's all it

refers to.
QUESTION:

Where we axe a party.

MR. SHAPIRO:

No.

Where a party.

What it says is the United States

right to plead that State laws are inapplicable or that the
United States is not amenable thereto by reason of its
sovereignty.
W® don't claim that we can’t b@ made a party in the

What w@ are saying

is that we can proceed in the Federal court for the affirmative
determination of oxir claims.
QUESTION:

And may the State court proceed simul-

MR. SH.APIRO:

The State court can certainly proceed

with respect to determination of the rights of the non-*
Federal parties, that is,the rights of parties other than the
United States.

Well, that's very much what w© are involved with
here.

There is always a continuous proceeding going on in the

Colorado courts over the rivers there.

w© are suggesting that the interest of the United States can
be determined in the Federal court subject to later integration
in the State proceedings.
QUESTIONS

If you win here on this case, I presume

Colorado water lawyers can go back thcs day our mandate comes
down and join the United States as parties in each of the basin

not be available to you in a subsequently commenced suit in the
United States District Court for the District of Colorado.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Thafs right.

What would happen —

well, this goes into Colorado procedure, but in effect we could
f

walk into the —- after the Federal court decrees the rights that
we are concerned with, it said, the United States is entitled
to priorities of 1868, 1875, 1932 with respect to reservations
X, Y, and Z, and the Indian rights, and it says that the purpose
of the reservations are agriculture, forestry, and so on.
And th© third thing it says is you get so many acre feet at

We take that decree in our hand and we are either

31
brought into the Colorado court, which is most likely, or we
go in and we present it and say, “Tabulate this into your
overall basin adjudication.”
Now, that actually has happened.

There is a case

which is mentioned in our complaint, the '.

decree, entered in 1932 with respect to some Indian water
rights.

Is there any question# Mr. Shapiro# that

And is

there not a question here whether in the McCarran Act the
Congress has altered that rule?
MR. SHAPIRO;
an answer.

There is a question but there is also

And the answer lies in what Senator McCarran

himself characterised this statute as doing.
there is a quotation of it.
Magnuson in the report.

In Eagle County

It’s in his letter to Senator

He assured the Senator# h© assured

everybody on tht floor that thy only purpose of this legislation
is to waive the sovereign immunity of the United States# permit
the joinder in general adjudications.

It didn't command the

dismissal of affirmative suits by the United States.

There is

no fallout from the statute beyond that.
Now, I really have to turn very briefly to tha
question of the Indian rights because it has been asserted that
the Indian rights i;>sue was adjudicated in the Ec.gle County
case.

I don't see how that could be when -there were no Indian

rights before the court.
Indian rights at all.

There were no claims involving

Instead the rights involved concerned

non-Indian claims.
QUESTION;

Certainly Justice Douglas' language when

he speaks of res-ervedrights and mentions the Indian claims
involved in Arizona v. California suggested he didn't see any
difference between Indian claims and other reserved right claims.

33

Isn't that a fair statement?
MR. SHAPIRO?

I think that sine© the question wasn't

before the Court,, I don't know whether it can be said to be
fair when no one really litigated it.
QUESTIONS

Well, it certainly isn't a holding, and

maybe you can say that if someone had asked him or asked the
other people to join the opinion, ar© you sure you want to do
this in view of the Indian rights, they would have com® to a
different conclusion.

But the intimation of the language for

whatever it's worth is that there is no difference as among
reserved rights for purposes of the McCarran Act.
MR. SHAPIRO?

I would argue that since fch® issue

wasn't here, at most it would have to be oversight because of
the way Indian rights are treated.

There is a very firm rule

that State jurisdiction over’ Indian rights is not recognised
except when expressly granted by Congress, even when there is'
a waiver of sovereign immunity.
Now, there is a case called United States v.
Minnesota which involves — which we have cited in our brief —which involves a statute that permitted the condemnation under
State law of Indian allotteed land, and a suit to condemn was
brought in the Minnesota State courts.

And when that eas®

reached this Court, -the Court held it's true th® condemnation
proceeding can go forward, there is & waiver of immunity to
that extant, but it has to b© brought in the Federal court.

34

Now, that principle is well known to the Congress.
You will not find a word in this statute.

You will not find a

word in the legislative history by any of the proponents of
the legislation indicating that they thought that Indian rights
were to be swept into the State courts.
And then finally, just after, 13 months after this
statute, Congress passes P„L. 280 which sets up a procedure
by which Indian rights can be brought before th® State courts
if the States will follow the method set forth in ~

months later.

That’s 13

I don’t sea how it can be said that this statute

where there is no mention of it, somehow swept Indian rights
in.
QUESTION:

Your Federal court suit involvas more than

Indian rights, does it?
MR. SHAPIRO;
QUESTION:

Much more.

Much more.

And

suppose without the

Indian rights you can’t succeed with this argument.
MR. SHAPIRO:

I was only addressing the Indian rights

by loosing — your Honor.
QUESTION:

Suppose you lose on the Indian rights and

35
you lose on the whole works.

But may you, even if you are

properly in the Federal court for Indian rights, drag in
everything else?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

No question.

We have the same --

What do you mean "no question15?

MR. SHAPIRO:

No question, because we ar© simply

asserting affirmative claims —
QUESTION:

What I am trying to suggest is if you are

foreclosed from asserting any but Indian rights in your Federal
court procedure, because you have Indian rights involved may
you squ.eak in other things that otherwise you couldn't bring
in fcha Federal court?
MR. SHAPIRO:

I don't third; the Indian rights them­

selves, of themselves, create any additional jurisdiction in
the Federal court, no, I don't mean to assert that.

Our

argument is there is no question we can assert non-Indian rights
in Federal courts simply because there is jurisdiction under
28 U.S.C. 1345 and under 1331.
QUESTION:

I guess I haven't mad© myself clear.

What I am trying to get, if you are wrong in the non-Indian
rights and they have to be adjudicated in the State proceeding,
may you nevertheless insist that the Federal court decide the
non-Indian rights because you are properly in thts Federal
courts on the Indian rights?
QUESTION:

'Sort of appended jurisdictional

36
idea* I gather.

Is that right?

QUESTION:

Or maybe because you cannot merely

adjudicate the Indian rights without knowing what th® other
rights are,
MR, SHAPIRO:

Well, it has been argued that if you

are going to adjudicate a stream, it is helpful to have as
many of the rights as possible asserted at the same time,
QUESTION:

On that basis, you should be in th© State

court, Mr, Shapiro.
MR, SHAPIRO:

No.

I am stating th© assertion, but

in fact it8s perfectly possible to do feh© contrary.

For

example, a water rights proceeding separates two kinds of claims.
On© can be an affirmative claim and saying, ’'Determine my
priority and my quantity,"and you can com© in as a defendant
saying, "He’s not entitled to his priority and his quantity."
Now, the plaintiff's side of it doesn’t have to be
adjudicated all at on© time, as Division 5 recognised.

You can

do it piecemeal as long as they are ultimately integrated in
the. totality.

And what we suggest is what I suggested under

Markham v. Allen.

Doing it. this way is not inconsistent with

the McCarran Amendment.

The basic purpose of the McCarran

Amendment is to get the United States out from behind sovereign
immunity, to get it to assert its claims.

going on, it

I know, but if the State proceeding is

certainly indicated that maybe there is some

preference to have the Federal Government go ahead and adjudicate
its rights in the State court rather than the Federal.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, it's just as consistent, I think,

to say that —
QUESTION:

You wouldn't suggest that if it was a party

to the State court proceeding that it could then , mecessfully
file and prosecute the Federal case.
MR. SHAPIRO:

I think there are circumstances in

which we could remove if w© otherwise come within existing
statutes governing removal, 1441(a), and that may have been in
Congress' mind as well.

We haven't got it.

There» is an

argument for removal which is not presented in this case, but.

38
it essentially is that when the United States is asserting
Federal water rights claims in its plaintiff capacity,, 'it's
made a defendant in a general adjudication and asked, "What
are your Federal water rights claims?

State them affirmatively .15

It5s really an involuntary plaintiff»

If it's an involuntary

plaintiff, there is jurisdiction in the Federal court under
28 U.S.C. 1345 and under 1331 with respect to the Federal
claims.

That's removable under 1441(a).

So there is an

argument which isn’t here.
QUESTION?

We certainly wasted a lot of time in

Eagle then.
MR. SHAPIRO?

No.

What we were arguing over in

Eagle essentially was whether the statute permitted reserved
rights of a non-Indian nature to be adjudicated under
MeCarran.

Now, that's over with.

We know that.

But we can

still bring our claims affirmatively in the Federal courts.
QUESTION?

But Eagle isn't really over with if you

ar® right about your right to remove.
MR. SHAPIRO?,

Well, I think, after the Federal

affirmative adjudication following the removal, we would still

It takes care of the Indian problem., because the

Federal court in an affirmative suit clearly has jurisdiction
over the Indian problem, and it's possible to integrate the

40

whole thing, the whole Federal decrees, back into the State
proceeding.
Now, if you start with the proposition that since
1789 th© United States had the right to bring its affirmative
claims in Federal court and its Indiam claims in Federal court
and you recognise that there' is not State court jurisdiction
over the Indian claims in any ©vent, then it makos a great
deal of sens© for us to bring these claims affirmatively in
the Federal tribunal, recognizing that we will ultimately
integrate them into the Stat© court proceeding.
QUESTIONs

Always subject to the McCarran Act»

MR. SHAPIRO;
Honor.

The McCarran Act is -the spur, your

But we are in affect in the position of one who

is told either bring your claims out affirraatively so they can
be determined and adjudicated and quantified, or you will be
brought into the Stat© courts or perhaps th© Federal courts
because I think the Act applied to both, to have them
adjudicated.

So what we have don© here is to get up off our

chairs and affirmatively assert what our water rights are.
■ }C

QUESTION;

Nothing you just said suggests that the

Congress could not allow the determination,

adjudication

of the Indian rights in State courts.
MR. SHAPIRO;

Congress certainly could if it

affirmatively chose to do so.
QUESTION;

Again, I suggest, that is what we have got

41
to decider is the effect of the MeCarran Act, as to Indian
rights or anything else.
MR* SHAPIRO:

Well, certainly that aspect of the

MeCarran Act, if you wish to reach it, does have to b© decided
because the matter is of tremendous importance to the Indian,
Now, in this connection, as on® final point to be
mad© aside from Public Lav? 280, which I mentioned, even th©
most recent full-scale study of Indian water rights and
national water rights generally, th© National Water Commission
report suggested that because of doubts over what th© impact
of th© MeCarran Amendment was on Indian rights., that really
th® Indian rights ought to b© adjudicated in Federal court.
Now, this is a. body of experts which is listening to all the
arguments about this question, and that body concludes that
the Indian rights should be adjudicated in a Federal court,
even if other rights are. adjudicated in a State court, because
of the Indians6 concern over being subjected to State court
jurisdiction.

That shows two things, not only th® Indians"

concern, but also th© fact -that'you don't need to have ©very
affirmative claim asserted in 'the same court as long as
ultimately for purposes of administration, all of th©
adjudicated rights, the affirmatively adjudicated rights, are
integrated

in a single proceeding.
Now, I don't think it would serve any purpos© to

argue about th© abstention doctrine.

The traditional doctrine

42
just doesn't apply to this case.

We ar® not dealing with

uncertain State law, which is what abstention is about.
not dealing with constitutional questions.

W@ are

We are not dealing

with an attempt to review a State administrative determination.
So we can put abstention aside.
Now, that leaves us with comity.

But there is

nothing in fch© comity doctrine that has ever been extended this
far.

You would have to find that somehow McCarran has a

fallout, a shadow around it that requires that the United States
not be allowed to sue affirmatively.
Thank you very much.

important.

Eagle and Water Division 5 covered Indian water rights and
recommended that Congress do something about th® problem.
The Justice Department recognized that as late as 1955 and
suggested to the Indians at hearings that they should go to
Congress and get something don© about th© problem.

That is to limit the d@tenrdnat.ion of

their rights to Federal court procedures?
MR. BALCOMB:
QUESTIONS

Yes# sir.

That8s what they suggested?

MR. BALCOMB3

That8s what they suggested.

And

major Indian water lawyers have recognized that Eagle County
and Darrell cover -the situation as far as Indian water rights
are concerned and that Congress should do something about it#
and Congress has don® nothing.

If referring — and one of the

Justices read a part of the McCarran Amendment to counsel.
He calls specifically to the fact that the Unitec States is
not amenable thereto.

In other words, the United States can't

plead that it’s not amenable thereto on account of its
sovereignty.

And I want to emphasise the word "sovereignty,"

because if their way to that which is one of the strongest
principles, they certainly would have to be talking about
everybody, as I view the matter.
I want to also call the Court's attention, without,
taking up too much of the Court's time, that in the reply brief,
at page 28, in the letter that cam® down from the Director of
feha Bureau of the Budget speaking for the President of the
United States that appears in fch© archives and is referred in a
footnote, referring to section 208, the italicized language,
the complaint was there mad© as it was mad® by the Justin©
Department and by Interior, that if that provision is left in
to© Appropriations Act, national parks, Indian reservations,
power installations, military and Atomic Energy establishments,
and irrigation projects are only a few of th® interests that
would be affected by the McCarran Amendment.

They all knew

what it was intended to cover.
QUESTION:

Mr. Baleomb, could I ask you, what about

47
the Indian tribes and Indians within reservations who have
fee title to their property?
MR,. BALCOMBs

I believe those are primarily the

Pueblos in , Mew Mexico and most of those cases have been in
Federal court.
QUESTIONS
jurisdiction?

Do you think that the State courts have

Could you name the Indian tribes and individual

Indians as defendants in your State proceeding?
MR. BALCOMB :
There are two tribes.

In my State court State proceeding?
(Inaudible)

in the reservation

water ~
QUESTION;

Have you named them as defendants?

MR. BALCOMB:

The Southern Utes and the — we haven’t

done anything except serve the United States and ask them to
come forward and lay out their claims like anybody els®.
QUESTION:

You think that by ' binding

th® United

States you bind the tribes.
MR. BALCOMBs

They have -the title, like they have the

title to the forest and title to the military reservations.
QUESTION:

Yes, but how about -- what would you think

if there were patented property inside th© reservations?
MR. BALCOMB:

If they had seme patented property, as

X say that might compare to 'th® Pueblo situation.
QUESTION:

What about it than?

MR. BALCOMB:

I don't know if that is tern© or not, but

48
if it is true# the Government has to name them, too.
QUESTION?

How do you bind them# though?

How do you

bind them?
MR. HALCOMBs
QUESTION:

Our proceeding?

How do you bind the Indian who owns some

property and owns some water in connection with it, or they
think they do?
MR. BALCOMBs

If MeCarran is applicable, you bind

them by serving the United States, your Honor# X believe.
QUESTION?

The old Candelaria

case# in 271 U.S.

says that the only way to bind the Indians is by serving the
Government# I believe.

It's not res judicata in a later action

by the Government on behalf of the Indians if you haven”fc served
the United States the first time.
QUESTION:

That, may be so# but my question is?

Do you bind the Indians by serving the United States?
MR. BALCOMB:
QUESTION?

Yes# sir.

You hops.

MR. BALCOMB?

The last thing I want to call to is

the recitation, everybody has recited it# including Mr, Justice
Douglas in Eagle County# and everybody seems to

-

to ignore it when they discuss what adjudication is.

attempt-_
It’s at

page 5 of our reply brief, it comas out of the Senate report on
the MeCarran Amendment# and it says# quote# leaving part of it
out ?

49

"...in a suit wherein it is necessary to adjudicate
all of the rights of the various owners on a given stream.

This

is so because unless all of the parties owning or in th© process
of acquiring water rights on a particular stream can be joined
as parties defendant, any subsequent .decree would be of little
value."
In other words, the McCarran Amendment would be out
the window.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

Th© case is submitted.
[Whereupon? at 2:45 p„m„, -th© argument in the aboveentitled matter was concluded.!
