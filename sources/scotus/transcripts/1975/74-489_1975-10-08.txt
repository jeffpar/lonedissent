MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear arguments

next in 74-489.,
Mr., Friedman, would you prefer to defer your
beginning until after lunch?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I think I would, Mr. Chief Justice.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Then we will begin that

at 1 o'clock and open with your case.
[Whereupon, a luncheon recess was taken.]
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Friedman, you may

ORAL ARGUMENT OF

DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
:

MR. FRIEDMAN:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice/.and may it please

The question in this case here dh a writ of
j

certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
is whether the Freedom of Information Act requires the
disclosures of summaries of proceedings; conducted at the Air
Force Academy by so-called Honor and Ethics boards
committees.

or

These summaries contain the results and the

disposition of proceedings conducted by cadet groups at the
Academy for the enforciment of the Honor Code.

And the honor

code is the principal issue in.the case, and I shall refer
to it, the proceedings under the Cthics Code are relatively
infrequent.

4
The Government contends that these summaries are
exempted from disclosure by two exemptions of the Freedom of
Information Act.

Exemption 6 which covers personnel and

medical files and similar files,, the disclosure of which would
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,
and Exemption 2 which covers matters related solely to the
internal personnel rules and procedures of an agency.
QUESTION:

Mr» Friedman, in your view, doss that

term "unwarranted invasion" mean that there is a balancing
process, that, is, to balance the importance of the disclosure
to the person asking for it against the potential for injury to
the subject?
MS. FRIEDMAN:

I would think so, Mr. Chief Justice.

QUESTION: Does the legislative history —
MR. FRIEDMAN:

The legislative histhry does

indicate in that phrase Congress did intend there to be abalancing.

But I would suggest, Mr. Chief Justice, that on

the one side of the equation it

probably mors accurately might

be phrased as the interest to the public, because under the
Freedom of Information Act any person can get information, but
it is not required tor him to show his need for it.

I think

it23 the general public interest, but. concerning the public
interest, I think it. is appropriate to look to the purposes for
which the information is sought.
But may 1 just add by * ay of preliminary thing

5
that our first submission is that, under this exemption you
never reach that issue because? as I shall develop? we think
that personnel and medical files are protected against disclosure
without regard to making that showing»
QUESTION:

Unwarranted invasion of personal, privacy

modifies only the similar files?
MR» FRIEDMAN:
that is our submission.

That is our submission, Mr. Justice?
And then we go on to say, but in any

event, in this case there was a clearly unwarranted invasion.
Now, the Honor Code at the Air Force Academy states,
"We will not lie, steal, or cheat, or tolerate among us anyone
who doesThe Code therefore has two elements? first, the
substantive element, the ban on lying, cheating, or stealing,
and secondly the toleration clause,

And what this means is
i :

that the Code imposes an obligation on the cadets .not only to
observe these requirements themselves, but to report anybody
who fails to comply, and in many instances, of course, which
you have is a cadet reports that he saw another cadet cheating
or was lying or doing something dishonest.
The Code was actually created by the cadet corps,
and it’s the cadet corps that administers it and enforces it.
If a violation is reported to someone known as an honor
representative and what they do is each squadron of the cadet
corps appoints two honor representatives.

They elect them, in

fact, so that you have 80 honor representatives whose basic

6

responsibility is to administer the Cods.

If an honor violation

is reported* an investigation is conducted by a group of three
honor representatives« At this investigation they take state­
ments from witnesses, talk to the cadet involved.

If as a

result of this investigation it appears that there has been a
violation of the Honor Code, then a formal proceeding is
instituted.

A board of eight cadets is appointed, and this

board, which is called an Honor Board or an Honor Committee,
than conducts a hearing at which the cadet appears as well as
any witnesses the cadet wishes to call.
Sworn testimony is not. taken.

The cadet-.is informed

that he has a right, to make a statement or to remain silent
and he is also informed that he has the right to call any
witnesses he wishes.

There is no cross-examination, and

counsel is not permitted to be present at the hearing, although
the cadet is given the opportunity prior to the hearing to
consult with legal counsel in the staff judge advocates office
at. the Air Force .Academy.
This procedure that I have mentioned, of course, is
fully consistent with the basic concept that this Code is
administered by the cadets and for the cadets.

Now, if at the

conclusion of a hearing the committee finds the cadet guilty
of the alleged violations, and it has to be a unanimous finding,
the cadet normally is expected to resign from the Academy.

If,

on the other hand, they either find the cadet not guilty or they

£T

7
find aim guilty but with something called discretion which
means that despite the violation, they feel it’s appropriate
for him to continue at the Academy, then he returns to the
student body»
The hearing is kept confidential.

The only people

admitted are members involved and a certain number of cadets
plus those officers at the Air Force Academy who are directly
involved in conducting the proceedings.
QUESTIONs

The proceedings ar© not transcribed,

though.
MR. FRIEDMANs
Mr. Justice.

The proceedings are not transcribed,

There is a man called a recorder who makes notes,

but the proceedings are not transcribed, and -the people are
warned at the hearing, admonished is perhaps a better word,
that the proceedings are confidential, for obvious reasons,
because when a man's honor is at stake, it should b@ kept
confidential,
QUESTION:

Mr. Friedman, is there a fil© of some

kind collected?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Only in the sense that the written

statements are taken, only in the sense that the written —
QUESTION:

What goes into the file?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I don't know what goes into the file

in that sense, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

Is there a difference when the result is

8

guilt as against either innocence or with discretion?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

The only difference, Mr. Justice, is

this, and if I may coma just to that in a minute, because I
think 1 should explain what happens.

There is no transcript

taken, and the record shows that the Honor Committee or the
Honor Board doesn't even make a verbatim or a summarized
transcript.

The only records, as an. affidavit in the record

states, ara brief one-page summaries of what happened.

And

these summaries stats what was found —
QUESTION:

Prepared by whom?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Prepared by the recorder of the board..

Now, these summaries in turn are then distributed
to each of the cadet squadrons.

There ara 40 squadrons, and

a copy of the summary is distributed to each squadron.
man is found guilty, the man's name is included.

If the

If the man

is either found not guilty or there is discretion, the man’s
name is deleted and he might be shown- as Cadet X, Cadet Y, or
something like that.
These summaries are? then placed upon the bulletin
board in each squadron in a file which says on the top of it
"Honor Case Summary for Official Use Only."
Now, the reason these — may I say one other thing.
In the case, of either not guilty or discretion, not all of
the summaries are distributed but only those that it is felt
by the board or the. honor people would be appropriate as

9

illustrative cases.
The reason they are distributed tc each of the 40
squadrons and discussed with the honor representative in the
’squadron is that the responsibility for the enforcement of the
Code lies with the cadet corps, and therefore it's essential
to fclie cadet corps to know the decisions of these Honor Boards,
to know what kind of conduct, was deemed to violate the Code,
what kind of conduct was deemed not to violata the Code, and
what, kind of conduct was deemed to violate the order but
excused.
Sc I think it can fairly b® said that the summaries
are in affect the end product of the Honor Board proceedings,
they are in actuality the only record of the proceedings of the
board and of its action.
QUESTION:

t

Do I get 40 copies, one for each of the

40 squadrons?
MR. FRIEDMAN;
QUESTIONi

Does each have its own bulletin board.

MR. FRIEDMAN;
QUESTION;

One for each of the —

Each has its own bulletin board.

What than are distributed throughout the

Academy are 40 copies.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Forty copies, plus a few additional

to various of the departments that should have this information.
QUESTION;

And they are posted for how long?

MR. FRIEDMAN: Generally until the end of the academic

10

year.
QUESTION;

And then what happens?

MR. FRIEDMAN;

Than they ar© destroyed.

But in addition to that there is a master file which
is kept for a lengthy period.

In other words, in dhe office

of someone who is called the Commandant8s Executive for Honor
and Ethics there is a a file of these summaries which he
maintains.
QUESTION;

This suit was to gain access to the master

file?
MR. FRIEDMANs
QUESTION;

But with names deleted.

MR.FRIEDMAN;
QUESTION;

To gain access to the summaries.

With names deleted.

I gather the court of appeals said there

also should be in camera proceedings to see if there should b©
further reduction.
MR,FRIEDMAN;

Well? what the court of appeals in

effect? as I will com® to in a minute? said was that it recognised
that even with these names eliminated there is a great danger
that this might redound

to the cadet's detriment because of

dredging up old things.

But then it went on and said that

eliminate the name and maybe you can eliminate other identifying
material? and with those eliminations? we hope —
QUESTION;

Eliminate other identifiable material

in an in camera proceeding conducted by the district judge.

11
MR, FRIEDMAN:

By the district judge, which it seems

to us is basically inconsistent with the court's previous
recognition at several points in its opinion that even elimina­
tion of these details won't be enough.

And that, of course,

was one of the major bases on which the Mr Force refused to
make these materials available because they said — at three
points in the record it set forth in various affidavits and
letters —• they said that even with this material being
eliminated, nevertheless this could jog the memories of
people who years ago had remembered something and this could
redound to a cadet's detriment, for the rest of his career.
And that's the basic reason we have taken the cast to this
Court because we think it is important
QUESTION:

May I get back just a step, Mr. Friedman,

Is there anything in the record which indicates that for sure
all 40 copias at the end of the school year of each of these
summaries is collected and destroyed?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Ho, there is nothing for sure, but

all I can say is there is indications they say that in the
record, and I was advised that that is in fact the general
practice, because —
QUESTION;

Is there anything to prevent a cadet,

for example, from taking it off the bulletin board and making
39 xerox copies, other than the Honor Code itself?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

The Honor Code itself, I would think,

12
Mr. Justice, plus the fact that I assume the cadets, most of
the cadets, at least, are aware of the importance of the
Honor Code and the importance of preserving its confidentiality.
I suppose a cadat could do that.

One would hops that

the cadet wouldn't do -that.
QUESTION:

Aren’t the cadets committed some way to

keep knowledge of these things to themselves, or not?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, it's repeatedly, it's repeatedly

urged upon them and stressed that this is for official use
only and that th® material is confidential.
I thought that th© Chief Justice8 question was
suggesting you might have a bad apple in the barrel who will
go out and make copies and distribute them.
It's possible, certainly, Mr. Chief Justice, but
I think it's unlikely, and as far as I know there has been no
experience along that line at th© Air Fores Academy.
QUESTION:

Mr. Friedman, non© of these are in the

record, are they, any of these summaries?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

I've been sitting here trying to figure

what could be in there
and all out.

No, they are not, Mr. Justice.

if you took the name and his connection

What could be in there?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, it depends on what you mean by

his connection. If you cut out all of the identifying details,
there wouldn't be much left of it.

But as I understand it —

situation.

Well, even that if there was a rumor

But you might have a vary different

Suppose what it reported was that a cadet in the

13th Squadron or whatever it's called, cheated at his examination
in mathematics IV before in Captain So-and-So6s class.

And then

it. seems to me this might fo® enough to the small group of people
connected with the Academy for someone to say,
fellow who did it.
QUESTIONS

“Oh, that4 s the

I remember that story."
Don't you think w© should have something

that we know what we are talking about?

I don’t know what I

am talking about.
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Mr. Justice, the problem with having

something is that that itself would breach the very confiden­
tiality of the documents to have something.

The whole purpose

for which we
QUESTION;

But we have to take your word that there

might be something in something which you don't know anything
about.
MR. FRIEDMANs

It's more than my word, Mr. Justice.

It's statements by two officers at the Air Fore® Academy.
QUESTION;
Force Academy.

That makes it two officers of the Air

14
MR, FRIEDMAN:

And the assistant to the Secretary of

the Air Force and the court of appeals.
QUESTION:

If you give me one example, I might be

able to understand what we are talking about.,
MR. FRIEDMAN:

And the court of appeals.

If I may

refer you, Mr. Justice, to page 11A and 12A of the appendix to
our petition for certiorari where the court of appeals, in dealing
with this problem, stated that a person's privacy may ba as
effectively infringed by reviving dormant memories as by
imparting new informatione

For example, the senior officer

and ex-cadet might upon reading a summary or a reference to it
realise for the first time that a man under his command had
one© been -the subject of Academy discipline.

It would b® cold,

comfort to the junior officer to be told that his chief had
always known the fact anyhow, although he had long forgotten it,
or had never made the ultimate connection among various bits
of knowledge until the article jogged his recollection.
QUESTION:

Whose testimony is it that, says that it

does specifically mention the group that the man belongs to?
Nobody.
MR. FRIEDMAN: There is nothing in that, but —
QUESTION:

Suppose they said an Air Force cadet

did something, how doss that apply to — how could that revive
anybody's rumor?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I don' t third?, that that * s what they

15
are seeking? Mr. Justice.

They are seeking these summaries

with? as they describe it? the names and identifying details
deleted.

Well? to make the document effective? to make the.

document effective so that it will show nothing that would
permit fell® identity of the cadet to be discerned? that would
in effect eliminate all of the stuff.
What they want to find out? they say? is to find out,
precisely how this Code in application has dealt with these
concepts of lying? cheating and stealing.
QUESTION;

Wouldn't we have a better case if the

district judge looked at it in camera ? took out what he thought
should b© taken out and then we looked at it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

You might have a better case, but w©

don't, think that is what the statute requires.
QUESTION'S

W@ would have a case that we know

something about what we were talking about.
MR. FRIEDMANs I think the Court does know? Mr.
Justice? on the basis of the affidavits explaining how and why
the release of this information would and could have a very
serious consequence upon the future careers of these cadets.
That is? when we are talking about personal privacy? it seems
to me the essence of it is to protect the publication of this
information.

This is privacy.

These are men? some of them?

who many years ago when they were relatively young got into a
scrape? they did something bad.

16
QUESTIONS

It wasn't many years ago, because the

Air Force Academy wasn't there many years ago.
MR a FRIEDMAN;

It could he 15 or 20 years ago.

Air Fore© Academy started in 1955.

The

So -this is a man who is

now in the middle of his career and suddenly something like
this cams out — or a junior officer, it happened two or three
years ego perhaps, and at that point it was all taken care of,
it was forgiven, and now lo and behold it suddenly is brought,
up again.

That's the problem.

That's the problem that we are

dealing with.
QUESTION;

Mr. Friedman, how many cadets are there,

at the Air Fore© Academy?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

About 4200.

Roughly a thousand a

class.
QUESTION;

And do I understand that all 4200 would

know the name and circumstances of an Honor Code violation
where the individual was found guilty?
MR. FRIEDMAN;
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes.

So there are 4200 people who know the

facts.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Because in the case of guilty, ©ach

of these summaries would be distributed and placed on the
bulletin board in each of the squadrons.
QUESTION:

Does ‘the Honor Code purport to impose

an oath of confidentiality forever on graduates of the Academy?

11
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, it does sot purport to do that.

But I think the essence of the Honor Code is that you will behave
as an honorable individual and that you normally world not
disclose these.

We can't be sure, we can1t ba sure that some

years later someone won't disclose this.

But it seems to us

that is inherent in the natura of the system.
But what we are concerned about is making public
information that would joggle memories» as the court of appeals
said, that could lead people who had long sine© forgotten about
this to recall it to memory.

And that's the- thing that is

concerning us.
QUESTIONt

Since I have interrupted you, do the

military services still have things called 201 files?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

I don't know.

I suspect s;o»

I suspect

so.
QUESTIONS

Would this summary be contained in an

individual's 201 file if ha happened, not to have been found
guilty but said to be one of these discretionary cases?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, it would not, Mr. Justice.

It

would not be put in his personnel file, but it woulc be put in
tlie general reading file, the general file of all of these
things»
But we don't think the fact that it's in his 201
file .necessarily means it's not a personnel file within the
meaning of the statute.

18
Let ms, if I may, get to our first legal argument,
which is that these are personnel files and that the statute
does not permit — require a showing that the disclosure of
either personnel or medical files would constitute a clearly
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Even though as I have
indicated

to Justice Powell, this material is not included

in the technical personnel file, we think it is part of the
personnel file because it deals with the conduct, the disciplina#
the activities of an individual.

This is the record.

This is

the only record of this man’s behavior.
Now, -QUESTION?

It would have a bearing, I suppose# at

time of his graduation on his assignment.

Would it be available!

for that purpose?
ME. FRIEDMANs

Presumably if he is found not guilty

or with discretion, I suppos® it shouldn't have any# but I
just don't know, because this is all again kept confidential
within the Mr Force Academy,

I just don't know.

Now, the language that I have referred to is
“personnel and medical files and other files th© disclosure of
which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal
privacy.5!
QUESTIONS

It may not be important, but that word

is "similar”.
MR, FRIEDMANs

Similar file, I am sorry, Mr. Justice,

19
QUESTIONS

That may be important»

MR. FRIEDMAN %

Th© legislative histroy of this

statute which we have discussed at considerable length in our
reply brief indicates that the first bill

there were a number

of early bills, but there were two basic bills in the 88th and
the 89th Congress which culminated in the Freedom of Informa"
tion Act — the first bill had no provision at all exempting
personnel files, medical files, or similar files»

And it

apparently was on the assumption that most of these files were
protected by other statutes.

But at the hearings on this

bill there was complaint by a number of witnesses that there
were vast quantities of Government files which contained a lot
of personal information and that should be protected, and -they
specifically referred to personnel files and medical files«
And following that hearing, the Senate added an
amendment to the bill which is set forth at the bottom of page 6
of our reply brief, and as originally drafted, the amendment
provided an exemption for personnel files, medical files, and
similar matters the disclosure of which would constitute a
clearly unwarranted invasion of p@rsoo.al privacy.

And the

committee report on that bill stated that — it’s quoted at
the top of page 7 — "In an effort to indicate the types of
records which should not be generally available to the public,
the bill lists personnel and medical filesAnd then it said,
nSince if would be impossible to name all such files, the

20
exception contains the wording "and similar records the
disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy.s K
Slow, we

think in the light of that committee report,

and the language as originally drafted, Congress intended the
disclosure requirement to modify only similar matters and to
provide an unqualified immunity for personnel files and medical
files .
When Congress finally enacted the Freedom of
Information Act, they changed that language to the present
language in the bill, and what they did was eliminat® the
commas„ combine personnel and medical files into one category
and substitute for the word "similar matter” the word "similar
files.“

Again, the legislative history that we have quoted

shows that Congress wished to protect the confidentiality of
personnel and medical files.

And w© don’t think this change

in language was intended to make any change in the basic
design, the basic purpose which led to the insertion of this
provision, in order to protect the confidentiality of personnel
files and medical files.

Congress in affect made a judgment

that the disclosure of personnel and medical files necessarily
would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal
privacy, and then went ahead and recognised the other files
which contained similar damaging material and it therefore
provided an additional, exemption for those of the similar filas

21
whose disclosure would have this serious impact upon personal
privacy *
QUESTION:

The committee report from which you read

was on a predecessor bill, is that right?
MR, FRIEDMAN%
yes, Mr. Justice.

That was on the predecessor bill,

But I may refer you to page 9,

the material

we have quoted in the middle of the page which is the report
on the final bill which in discussing the general purposes of
the Act pointed out that while they are enacting a broad
philosophy of freedom of information, it was necessary to
protect cartain equally important rights of privacy with
respect to certain information in Government files, such as
medical and personnel records.
So we think once again this reflects basic
congressional intent and philosophy to protect the privacy of
personnel, and medical files.
QUESTION s

are you arguing that these summaries

more are personnel files? •
MR. FRIEDMANS
QUESTION:
anyway

That is correct.

And then alternatively, if they ares not,

they are similar files.
MR. FRIEDMANs

That is correct. .

The significance of the distinction is if they are
personnel files and if the Court agrees with our responsiveness,
our analysis' of the statute, that’s enough.

That's enough to

would constitute a clearly —
MR. FRIEDMANS

Yes.

Of course, if the respondents

are right, if the respondents are right that you have to make
the showing with respect to the disclosure of personnel files,
you would also by the same token have to make the disclosure
with respect to medical files.

And of course there is a well-

recognized privilege for communications between patient and
doctor.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Friedman, these files you are talking

about are those in this honor man’s office?

Ar© those the

MR. FRIEDMAN:

That’s right.

It’s the summaries

MR. FRIEDMANs

He does.

But is terns of the basic

policy, in terms of the basic policy of exemption 6, we think
t

that Congress did intend this kind of material to fca treated as
a personnel file because its disclosure would have this adverse
impact.
QUESTION:

How do you define personnel file, or rephrase it

to include this within it?

entirely, you wouldn’t find this in it.

Isn’t that correct?

QUESTION s

Is there any explanation in the record

that would shod light on that that it was omitted from the

25
conventional personnel file for reasons of protecting fch®
confidentiality in an extra measure?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Anything like that?

There is nothing in the record to

indicate that? but I would assume

bo,

Mr. Chief Justice?

because once the man has been found not guilty or once
discretion has been exercised? as far as the Mr Force is
concerned? he has & clean slat®.
to follow him.

And they don’t want this

Indeed? th© danger is? the concern is that

years later this thing will.suddenly be dredged up. And that's
all spelled out? th® concern is all spelled out? as I indicated,
in the opinion of th® court of.appeals? in .the various items
in th® record? and we believe that that shows that even if
this is viewed as a similar file? nevertheless the effect of
disclosing it would constitute a clear invasion of personal
privacy.
QUESTION?

Mr. Friedman? do I understand now that

the Government is no longer relying on exemption 2?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No? we are relying? Mr. Justice.

am sorry if I gave the wrong impression? Mr. Justica.

Is there any concern that if you continue

to lose this cas-t, as the Govemm&nc has lost it thus fax,,

MR* FRIEDMftNs

There is concern, as indicated in

the record, that the essence of this is confidentiality, and
the toleration clause in particular under which cadets feel

*

obligated and do report violations, may might be very reluctant
to report violations if all of this stuff came aut*

1 mean,

I think the Code operatas, the basic rationale and the basic
procedure and method on which the Code operates, is that it is

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRINGTON D. PARKER, JR.
OH BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
•
the Courts

MR. PARKERs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

As the Deputy Solicitor General has indicated,

this case presents for the Court's consideration the scop© of
two of the Freedom of Information Act's exemptions — exemption
6 relating to personnel and medical filas and similar files
the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy, and exemption 2 which pertains
to matters related solely to the internal personnel rules and
practices of an agency.

27
The documents sought are case abstracts of
adjudications by the Air Force Academy's Honor and Ethics
Cod© Committees.
QUESTIONS Case abstracts, Mr. Parker, that's
synonymous with summaries, as Mr. Friedman has used the word?
MR, PARKERS

Yes, sir, it is-

These abstracts are sought with all names as well
as all other identifying references deleted.

The documents

will be used in connection with a study of due process at the
nation's service academies being conducted under the
auspices of the New York University Law Review.

Just so we understand what the word

"auspices” means there.
MR.PARKER:

QUESTION:

Is there any question of mootness in

this case? Nobody mentioned in the briefs: I: saw,’.but fchat-you
just said certainly suggests there might be.
MR. PARKER:

No, sir, there is not.

All the

empirical source material — to back up a moment, the study

has been published, but pursuant to an arrangement with the
New York University Law School, all of the* empirical source
material which reflects really hundreds and hundreds of
man-hours of work, investigations, interviews, and so forth,

They had to go to publish it

before the adjudicative process had ended»

But I would also

like to stress that, of course, there is no standing require­
ment under this Act —
QUESTION:

No, I'm not talking about standing;

I'm talking about mootness»
MR» PARKER;
to any person.

Documents are to be made available

30
QUESTION?

Mootness, not. standing.

The requests

were made for the purpose of this study, were they not?
HR. PARKERs

The Second Circuit solicited views

on that question, and both our responses and the responses
of the Government are part of the record, and neither of us
believe that the controversy was moot.
QUESTIONS

So long as you continue to want the

information, I take it, that's sufficient to give you standing
to go into court under the Freedom of Information Act.
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION?

That's correct, your Honor.
Is there an allegation somewhere that

you continue to want it after this study was completed?
MR. PARKERs

The record clearly indicates that

there is a continuing interest on the part cf the respondents
in these documents.
QUESTION;

In your view, Ms:. Parker, does the term

'“unwarranted", modifying either intrusion or some word to that
effect, require a balancing process, as I inquired of Mr.
Friedman so as to measure the reasons for which the information
is sought or, as has been suggested, is everyone who makes
an inquiry on exactly ‘the same footing no matter what his
purpose may be?
MR. PARKER.

I believe, your Honor, that the

primary focus of the Act is public access to information.
connection with this exemption, I believe there is support

In

31
in the legislative history for the approach that the reason
for which

documents, ar© sought may be considered*

But the

primary focus there is, with respect to exemption <>, simply
is there an invasion of privacy and, if so, how great.
QUESTIONS
mean?

What, then, does the term "unwarrantedi!

It indicates that they thought there were some kinds

of intrusions that would be warranted and some that would not
be warranted.
MR. PARKERs

I believe that the unwarranted language

is designed to authorise the court to look at the seriousness
of the likelihood that somebody's privacy will be invaded.
And as I will explain in a moment here, I think, in connection
with the disclosure of these (abstracts, there is no
reasonable probability that anybody's privacy will be
invaded <■
QUESTION s

How about the balancing on the other

side,under tha unwarranted clause, do you look at the "conception
of the importance of the need"that's assarted by the plaintiffs?
I mean, if it were just idle — if someone came in and admitted
it was just idles curiosity and not to write a Law Review
article, would -that perhaps require a different outcome in
one case than another under the unwarranted clause?
MR. PARKER;

I don't believe so.

I think that the

reason for which documents are sought, given the scheme and
the philosophy of the Freedom of Information Act, are secondary

32
and even tertiary considerations,
QUESTION2

Mr* Parker, might not 6 foe interpreted

as implying that there is an invasion of personal privacy,
so Congress found, on th® disclosure of personnel and medical
or similar files, and that there has got to foe some justifica­
tion for that invasion*

Congress already has determined that,

disclosure would involve an invasion.

And isn't "unwarranted"

perhaps —MR* PARKER:

I certainly don't believe and I would

not concede that there is any realistic .kind of invasion of
personal privacy when we are talking about disclosing —
QUESTION:

But we may not — 1 am just wondering

if the Congress didn't make that conclusion.
MR. PARKER:

X don't. believe that that was their

concern,
The case abstracts which are sought would fo© used
for th© purposes of simply documenting 'tlx© substantive
content of the. Honor Cod© to show what back patterns or what
conduct has been thought to amount to lying, cheating, stealing,
or tolerating.
X would like to stress that the case abstracts in
an unedited form, which includes the names and the salient
facts are posted in 40 different locations around the Academy
and they are available for inspection and discussion among
thousands of cadets and also the employees or administration,

33
at least# and the faculty of the Academy.

Aid I submit there

is nothing in the record which indicates that because of any
Air Force regulation cadets are proscribed from talking about
these matters among themselves or among non-Academy Air Fore©
officers later»
QUESTION;

But this is only for on© year»

MR» PARKER:
QUESTION;

Pardon me?
It8s only for one year., isn't it?

MR» PARKER;

That's right, they are not available —

MR. PARKER:

I don't, believe thata the case.

It's

my understanding of the record her© that the case files which
are collected in the master binder are available for review
by the cadets at any time.

So you have there really a

historical collection of these abstracts, not simply for on©

Yes.

QUESTIONS

And they are not available to the general

public when they are posted either, are they?
MR. PARKERS
QUESTIONs

That's correct.
Or even to cadets generally.

MR. PARKERs
when they are posted.
QUESTIONS

They are available to cadets generally
That’s why they are posted.

The facts -

Are they posted in areas where members

of the general public visiting the Academy couldn’t read them?
MR. PARKERs

I don’t know —• I don’t believe the

record clearly indicates that.

The Government in its reply

brief has indicated that these bulletin boards are hot
available to the public generally.

And I'm not sura exactly

what that means.
QUESTION?

Doesn’t it mean that they aren't

available to the public?
MR. PARKERs

I don't believe it means they aren't

35

available to the public,.period, or at any time*
QUESTIONs
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

Xha just —

Isn't that similar —
— doubtful as to what that means.
I agree it is somewhat ambiguous,, but

is that not to be read as meaning it's not avai.lafo.le to the
general public.
MR. PARKERs

I don81 believe the record supports

that, and I did not so read that statement.
QUESTION:

Is there any indication in the record

that anyone outside has ever had access to?
MR. PARKER?

No.

And by the same token there is

no
QUESTION?

Either way.

MR. PARKER? — there is no indication of the other
way.
‘ Now, these Honor and Ethics abstracts are not
personnel files.

The Air Force's own regulations sharply

distinguish between medical and personnel files on the one
hand and files similar to personnel files on the other hand
and state that files relating to disciplinary matters are
to be considered similar files and are to be disclosed so
long as. there is no unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
QUESTION:

Well, looking to governmental practices

in general, Mr. Parker, in the Department of the Interior,
Department of Justice, or anywhere else where you have

36

a personnel file presumably on every employee, and there is
limited access to that personnel file, of course, as we know.
If the employee was cited by a superior and subjected to
certain charges and an administrative hearing were held ami
that was washed out and he was cleared, would that not go into
his personnel file?

I am speaking now c£ general practices

in Government.
MR,, PARKER:
QUESTION:

It could,,

•

It8s a personnel action, isn't it,

whether he's cleared or whether he's not cleared?
MR. PARKER:

Yes, sir.

But we insist that the fact

that those case abstracts might initially have been contained
in a file which was labeled a personnel file is not dispositive
in view of the wide intra-agency distribution that takes
place thereafter.
QUESTION?

Well, it is not uncommon for one agency,

let us say, the Department of the Interior, to ask for
access to the personnel fil® of an employee, a lawyer, in the
Department of Justice.

2 take it you ara familiar with that

as a common governmental practice.
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

That’s right,
And the reason might well be that the

Department of the Interior is thinking about hiring this man
on their own staff.

They certainly would make an evaluation

of any adverse charges or adverse disciplinary actions, would

37
they not?

Uti&y take that into account.
MR, PARKER:
QUESTIONS

Presumably,
For tm it’s pretty difficult to separate

charges of this kind from personnel records, personnel files.
MR. PARKER:

1 think that unless that separation

is made, the texture of(b)6 becomes completely open-ended
.because you ar© then talking about a situation where
th@oreticsJ.ly a relationship with personnel matters can make
any document such as the ones here, which ware widely
disseminated and disseminated for instructive and didactic
purposes,a personnel fils.

And 1 just don’t believe that's

what Congress intended when it enacted exemption 2, and I
think the legislative history would tend to support me on
that.
I think when we talk about a personnel file, as
the term is generally used, we talk about the file that's,
maintained in the personnel office of an employer or an, agency.
Its a file that contains an employees s application, his
attendance record, the results of a Civil Service exam, or
something, or information.
QUESTIONt

Tell me, Mr. Parker, do you take the

position that the fact that these summaries, abstracts ar®
posted on 40 bulletin boards to foe seen toy 4200 cadets in and
of itself takes it necessarily outside the reach of 6?
MR. PARKER:

1 do, your Honor.

38
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

Just the fact of such a broad distribution.
When Congress enacted exemption 6, it

was concerned with protecting intimate information about an
individual which could be correlated with that individual..
Now, once you open up the file and take documents out.
and post them, I think that consideration has been vitiated.
QUESTION:

Do you read the “unwarranted" language as

modifying "personnel and medical files", too, as well as
similar files?
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
You’d have to to give the answer you did

to Justice Brennan.
ME, PARKER:

Y@a, sir.

The qualificationHcXearly

unwarranted invasion of personal privacy" modifies "personnel
files, medical files," as well as “similar files','*
QUESTION:

If you are wrong on that point, then it

would seem to me that Congress has given a flat exemption to
personnel files and that the fact 'that personnel files might
have been publicized in some other way gives no indication that
Congress would want the exemption to be less applicable in that,
situation„
MR. PARKER:

That’s & hypothetical question and that

would be correct, your Honor,

But let ace stress that the

legislative history of exemption 5, if we are focusing not
on earlier versions or earlier drafts or comments on earlier

35
versions, but the final House and Senate reports indicate that
Congress did not intend a per se exemption for m@di.cal and
personnel files.
We quote from tbs- legislative history on page 13 and
14 of our brief, but Congress said, and X think their intent
is stated here quit© clearly*, that while the exemption is
intended to cover detailed records on an individual which can
be identified as applying to that individual, the exemption,
not any particular clause in the exemption, but the exemption
itself does not apply to factual matters, such as the facts
concerning the awards of a pension or benefit or to statistical
type information.
I would also like to emphasize that the Senate report.,
the final Senate report, reaches precisely the same conclusion.
The Senate report indicates that while highly personal health,
welfare, or selective service records would be generally
nonavaliable, factual matters, for example, the award, again,
of a pension or a benefit, should be disclosed.
Now, under the Government's per se approach here —
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER;
QUESTION;

May I interrupt you, Mr. Parker?
Yes, sir.
Where would you draw the line as to medical

files, now, putting personnel files aside?

Where would you

draw the line on the medical side as to what is warranted and
what is unwarranted?

40

MR. PARKER:

1 would admit that a much higher showing

would be required to look into a medical fils, but by fcha
same token there could ba valuable statistical or factual
information in medical files which could and should be
disclosed and that disclosure would involve no invasion of
personal privacy, and it certainly would not involve a clearly
unwarranted one.
QUESTIONS

The medical file.

MR. PARKERs

Suppos©, for example, someone was

interested in the geographical radius from which people came
to a particular Public Health Service hospital.
in a medical file.

How, that’s

That is information which I think could and

should be disclosed and wouldn’t compromise anyone’s personal
privacy.

And if you take a look at the legislative history

of the 1974 amendments. Congress squarely recognised that kind
of a situation and said,

m don't intend a per m exemption

for any of these subsections under (b) of the Freedom of
Information Act.

We want courts —

QUESTION:

As a matter of fact, 1 think geographical

information might be. — it never has been regarded as
confidential even though it's part of a medical file.
V' *

MR. PARKER?

Under the Government's approach, one®

it's labeled medical file, you can’t get in it regardless of
whether’ it’s — it can’t be disclosed regardless of whether it’s;
considered confidential or not.

41
QUESTIONt

Well, I want to know just how far you go.

Does the fact that the cadet might have had mumps in hia
childhood, is this capable of being divulged under exemption 61
MR. PARKERs

I think I might have some problems with

divulging that Cadet John Smith had mumps at age 12, but it
might be very useful to know that 5 parcent of the cadets at
the Academy never had mumps, or information of that; type.
QUESTIONs

But you don't know whether they would

refuse to give that information in the context of this case,
do you?
FIR. PARKER:

No, we don't.

But 1 would lik® to point, out and direct your
Honor’s attention to the Privacy Act of 1974 which specifically
says that statistical and factual information can fe disclosed
from personnel files once written assurances are given that,
the information is to be used for scientific or scholarly
purposes and after identifying names and references are deleted.
So here we have Congress in 1974 looking at: a problem
which I suggest was quite similar to the one which we are
facing, and they said, let’s let this factual information b©
made available.
QUESTION:

All they really said was the Privacy Act

wouldn’t prohibit being mad© available.
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
That’s neutral information, though, isn't, it?

42
MR. PARKER;

These sanitised case summaries are

neutral information.
QUESTION;

Ms don't know that yet, of course.

Now, let tm put this hypothetical to you.

Suppose

a charge came in that a cadet who was a member of the football
squad had. accepted a bribe in connection with a game and it
was sufficiently documented so that it triggered an inquiry,
and that inquiry was held over a period of time, I would
assume it would take time, and he is totally cleared.

Now,

then, if that had occurred during the football season, it
might well be that the player would be put on the oench during
that period.

Even if you sanitised, as you put it, if you

sanitised that report, could not a sophisticated sports writer,,
noticing that this man was out of three successive games for
no specifically announced reason, put together that this
sanitised file meant that the particular player was the man
accused of taking the bri.be?
MR. PARKER;

That's possible, but, your Honor, that's

exactly the kind of analysis that the district court can and
should undertake in connection with its in camera review,
and they can ask those same questions and sit down with the
Academy and see if those associations could be made,and on the
facts that you just put to me, that's likely to be. the kind
of summary that won't be disclosed.
But when we are talking about whether a cadet was

43
asked to resign for cribbing in 1357, that is the kind of
summary from which those associations would be for all intents
and purposes impractical.
QUESTIONs

Now, if district judges are going to get

into that exercise that you describe,, they are liable to have
a good many litigated casas waiting their turn while they are
perusing these files.
MR. PARKER£

1 don't believe that this case presents

any particular burden or any particular complexity in that
regard, and I would like to emphasize that the 1974 amendments
add a segregabl® records provision and an in camera review
provision which provides in camera review with respect to
all — provides 'that a district court may conduct such a
review with respect to all exemptions, anti in addition it
says that when you have segragable records or disclosable
records mixed with nondisclosabla ones or nondisclosable portions
of tiis record, they should be looked at in the essentially
factual or ...
QUESTION?

should be disclosed.
You are suggesting that at least under

that provision, some file that*s admittedly a personnel file
and that you would concede is a personnel file, nevertheless
could be submitted to the judge and paged through and anything
in the personnel file that wouldn't necessarily invade privacy
could be disclosed.
MR. PARKER?

fas, sir, and that's what Congress said

44
and authorized.
QUESTION %

tod that would ba true mmn if prior to

that provision a personnel file meant a personnel file -and was
not disclosable.
MR. PARKER:

No, I wasn't talking in terms of the

amendments, l was talking in terms of the legislative history
of the Act as it was initially passed«.

Congress said that

essentially statistical or factual information in

personnel

files could be ~QUESTIONs

So you say that from the very outset under

exemption 6 you should be able to page through, an admitted
personnel file and extract the materials from that that wouldn* t
invade any privacy in the view of the judge.
MR. PARKER:

Yes, sir.

The legislative history is

quit® clear on that, I believe.
t

QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:
QUESTXON:

Even with respect to a medical file?
The ~
I assume your point has to ba good with

raspact to medical files, too.
MR. PARKER:

Yes, sir, it is.

The Solicitor General

in his brief emphasized the files such as those maintained by
HEW and. the Veterans Administration which are • essentially
personal in nature, and the legislative history of exemption 6
indicates that when Congress decided that essentially factual
information could be diselosable from files, •. it",had precisely

45
those filas in mind.
QUESTION:

The record harein —
QUESTION:

There is nothing in the record on that

point ,
MR. PARKER:

— I don’t believe reflects that.

I would finally like to suggest, that under the
procedures set forth by the court of appeals, here, no clearly
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy is likely to occur.
Now, as we have said, we have requested these files with all
names as well, as all other identifying references deleted,
The district court initially held that the disclosure of these
files would involve no clearly unwarranted invasion of personal
privacy.

The court of appeals held that the petitioners had

not proved that the exemption applied to the summaries, and
remanded the case for an in camara inspection?if the summaries
could be successfully redacted or sanitised, they they were
to be produced.

If they could not be, or to the extent they

could not be, then they were not required to to© produced,
I would like to finally emphasise that this procedure,
as authorised by the Second Circuit, is consistent, fully
consistent, with the Act and with its amendments, and it
forecloses any reasonable possibili.ty that there would be an
invasion of personal privacy.

Thank you.

MR. FRIEDMAN s

Which is an affidavit by 'General

In the middle of the page he says# “These case

He said# "The sol® purpose

Oh, that's some military phrase which

I tali® it means a particular group that is handling some kind
of program at the Mr Force.

It might be a particular flight

training or something like that.
Now, secondly, with respect to the 1974 amendments,
which Mr. Parker has relied on, the Government, as is not
surprising in these Freedom of Information Act cases, takas a
somewhat different view of the effect of those amendments than
he does, and I won't go into it at any length.

We have

discussed these amendments in a lengthy footnote beginning
on the bottom of page 14 of our brief, and we don't think that,
idias© 1374 amendments override the specific exemptions.

We

don't think if these particular files ar© exempt that under tbs
1974 amendments Congress now intended people to search through
them and decide what parts are disclosable and what parts are
not.

In fact, th© history shows that -this was intended to b©

procedural in nature and merely to reflect the existing case

law.
And if I may just say one more thing in closing —

49
QUESTION:

You say the amendments have changed no

rule of law at all' -MR. FRIEDMANs
QUESTION s

That’s what w© think th® legislative

— as far as disclosability is concerned.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

As far as segregating out disclosable

and nondisclosable things.

I think with certain matters it

did# but where you have a situation where# as we claim# the
i

whole file is nondisclosahle, w© don’t think the amendments
did this.
And if I might just say one thing in closing# Mr.
Parker referred to the purposes of exemption 6 which was to
protect against disclosure of intimate details of a person’s
life that, ha would not want to have disclosed.

We say that's

precisely what making public these summaries would do.
Thank you.
QUESTIONs

But# Mr. Friedman# I don’t see how the

Government could really object if a district, court looked at a
personnel file and said# This kind of information has just
been put in here to conceal it and this is not the kind of
information that is normally part of a personnel file.
MR. FRIEDMAN %

But we have no question# Mr. Justice.

We have indicated in our brief we have no question that a.
court could examine something in camera to determine whether
it’s a personnel file ox* a medical file.
QUESTION;

What if they looked at these summaries

50
and say they are not a personnel file?

They are not in the

personnel file, they are kept somewhere else, and they say
-these are not a personnel file because — for all sorts of
reasons .
MR. FRIEDMAN;

I would think if the court war© to

hold that these are not personnel files but are sosaathing else,
that would b© done thing.
QUESTIONS

But 1 don't think under this ~

That's part of the argument.

MR. FRIEDMANs

The argument, as I understand it,

Mr. Justice, the argument as 1 understand it is not. that the
court should examine in camera to determine if it'a a personnel
file, but to examine it in camera to see whether or not by
excising certain material it can now be safely disclosed.
QUESTION^

I don't know if they go that far, but I

would think a fortiori they would say they could examine it
to determine if it's a personnel file.
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Yes, but 1 think if they find that it

is a personnel file? 1 think that’s the end of the inquiry.
Whereas they would take it ons step beyond and say it can be
sanitized.
QUESTION:

I understand that, yes.

QUESTIONS

If the court found that it was not a

personnel file, then the judge would have a further step, would
ha not, to determine whether or not it was a similar file.
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Yes.

Well, I don’t think there is any

51
question that these are, if not personnels similar files»

The court of appeals so treated.

And

then you would have the

further step# I suppose, of determining whether the disclosure
of this material would result in an unwarranted invasion of
personal privacy.
QUESTIONS

And this is a weighing process.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTIONs

Yes.

Mr. Friedman, may I ask counsel whether

the briefs contain a citation to the study which I now under­
stand has been completed?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION*

Yes, there is a citation —

In the red brief?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

In our brief, I know.

Yes.

It’s at

page III of the index of our brief .and it’s cited at page 5
of our brief.
QUESTION:

Thank you,

MR, FRIEDMANs

Under the caption Rose, et cetera,

at cetera.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted,
[Whereupon, at 2:10 p.m., the argument in the aboveentitled matter was concluded,]
