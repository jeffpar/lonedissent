ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE S. ROGOU ON
BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. ROGOW%
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

The issue in this case is whether Davis v. United

States or Fay y, Hoia

s@ts the applicable standard for

determining access to Federal habeas corpus relief for a
Stat® defendant whose lawyer failed to make a timely challenge
to the grand jury which indicted him.
Our position is that Davis does not apply fco this
case.

But if this Court holds that Davis does apply, then

Francis has met the test of Davis, which is cause shown.

He

has mat that test because of the ineffective assistance of
counsel which he received.
Obviously the facts of tills case ar© important.
They are largely undisputed.
Francis was indicted on December 10, 1964 .
17 year® old.

He, was

He was indicted on the charge of felony murder.

Th© maximum penalty in Louisiana for felony murder was death.
A lawyer was appointed to represent Francis two months later.

That lawyer was Mr. A. P. Tureaud, of New Orleans.

Tareaud

was appointed, and if he were going to file a grand jury

4
challenge on th® basis of exclusion of blacks, he would have
had to have filed that challenge by March 4, 1965, which was
tarsia days after th® ©nd of th© term of th© grand jury which
indicted Francis»
Tureaud did not file that motion»

Indeed, Tureaud

filed no motion in this case until fch@ day before trial.
Tureaud.recognising his own inexperience associated with
himself another lawyer from New Orleans, Mr. Earl Amadoe.
QUESTION:
law?

Do you know how long Tureaud practiced

You said he was inexperienced.
ME. ROOOWs

I say he was inexperienced in this kind

©f case, Mr. —
QUESTION:
MR. ROQGWs

Criminal cases?

Ha had not handed a

criminal case in many years.

QUESTION:

QUESTION s

He didne t tasfcify.

He was ill .at the

Ha didn't testify, did he?
MR. BOGGKV:

Yes, sir, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

All

the testimony in this ©as© in th© record is built upon th©
testimony of Mr. Amadee, th® counsel that Tureaud associated.
H@ associated Mr. Amadea, according to Mr. toad®©, because of
his inexperience in handling criminal cases, b®saus@ ©f the

5
fact that h© had not handled a capital case in 15 years.
QUESTION:

Do you regard a lawyer as ineffective

or incompetent in trying a capital case because he had never
tried a capital eaa© before?
MR. ROGOW:
QUESTIONS
MR. ROGOW 2

Not per s@.
Well.
But I think in the context of this cas®,

w® are not only talking about the fact that it had been 15
years (since he had handled a capital case.

We are talking

about a whole saries of events which w@ think support the
proposition that he did not d© th© job that h© should have
don© in protecting Francis9 rights.
QUESTION»

Well, a per &® rule would mean that th®

first capital case any lawyer tried would automatically be
open to your challenge.
MR. ROGOW %

And that9s why we do not advocat® a

per a® rule, Mr» Chiof Justice.

We do not say that because

this is tli@ first css® in 15 years
QUESTION »

Is it really very important one way or

the other whether defense counsel has ever tried a capital
ease?
MR. ROGOWs

W® think it is important.

Obviously

th© stakes in a capital case arts very high, and quite
frankly, th® acceptance of an appointment in a capital case
if this wer© your first capital case is on© which I think a

6

lawyer ought to take with great consideratiori and give soma
thought to, if Si® were going to do it by himself.
Tureaud obviously felt h@ could not do it by himselff
and he associated counsel with himself*

That counsel was

Hr* Amade© who was associated as a trial expert because of
Turaaud9© feeling, X believe, himself that he was inexperienced*
QUESTION;

Would you automatically equate it with

self-evaluation of ineffectiveness when a lawyer seeks to have
another man associate with him?
MR* ROGOW:

No, 2 would not*

I -think, though, in

the facts of this case, and if 1 may develop those facts, X
think the Court will begin to see why each of these different
fact® which we put forth are part of the total pictura
representing fch@ ineffectiveness of assistance.
QUESTION;

All w® are doing, these qu@ati.ons ar®

going to the matter of tbs standards that you set up*

They

are your standards.
MR., ROGOW;

Yes, sir, and the standards ar® based

on the totality of the circumstances in this cas®, not merely

on the fact that it had been 15 years sinea he last handled
a capital cas® ■

But that is on® factor.

Another factor is that no motion was filed until
the day before trial, and 'that first motion that was; filed
in this cas©, on the day before trial, June 23, was a motion
for a continuance on a form borrowed from the District

7
Attorney's office, which was struck -through by Mr. Tureaud
to accommodate it for Francis8 use.

That motion for a

continuance, filed, as I said, just the day before trial, the
very first motion filed in this capital cass., sought a
continuance so that Ture&ud. could have time to file additional
motioms in Francis5 defense*
She motion for a continuance was denied.
same day, three other motions were filed.

On tjfeat

On® was a frayor

for Oyer, which is a form of discovery under Louisiana law,
another a motion for a bill of particulars.

A third was a

motion challenging the grand jury indictment only on vagueness
grounds, and of course, did not involve the exclusion of
black question.
Now, our position is that the fact that those motions
were filed the day before trial Is just on® more factor to

b® considered.

The for® of those motions, on a form borrowed

from tli© District Attorney, at least th® motion for continuance
was borrowed from the District Attorney, is on® mors factor
t© be considered.
On the day of trial, a fourth motion was filed.
That motion was one t© suppress the statements which Francis
had allegedly given.

Th® motion t© suppress was filed, it

was denied.without a hearing, and the record of this case
reflects that no exception was taken to that denial without
a hearing, although an exception was required under Louisiana

law»

So on® more example of the factors which w® say , taken

in their totality, begin to bespeak of ineffective assistance
of counsel.
Francis was tried on June 24, 1955.
convicted on that day.

He was

And five days later h© was sentenced.

He was sentenced to life imprisonment •
taken from that conviction.

There was no appeal

The record is clear that Francis

knew of his right to an appeal, wanted an appeal, and yet
no appeal was taken.

And on© of the reasons teat Mr.

Asnada© gave for not talcing the appeal wes teat h@ and Mr,
Tureaud did not want to stake this css® s life work.

Thsy

felt that tea jury by sparing the Ufa of Francis had done
enough, and therefor® no appeal was taken.
Mow, what w© are saying is all of those facts
together begin to — more than begin.

Ml of those facta

together show that Francis' counsel was ineffective and did
not offer him the kind of protection which ought to have been
offered,'so any presumption of effectiveness was overcome by
these facts.
Francis later applied to tea Louisiana trial court
for habeas corpus, claiming that he was denied his eight to
appeal and also claiming that blacks had been excluded from
the grand jury which indicted him.
The application was denied•

It was denied essentially

because Francis had not mad® a timely challenge.

Under

9
applicabis Louisiana statute, if on© did not mak'3 a timely
challenge to th® grand jury, then the right to challenge a
grand jury was absolutely barred.,

%$t& because of that

absolute forfeiture rule, Francis had no opportunity t© raise
this issue in State habeas corpus proceedings and to fully
develop whether or not th@re was any cans® and whether or not
he waived the right to challenge the grand jury.
He then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus
after th© Louisiana Supreme Court had denied certiorari in
the eas®.
She district court for th© ©astern district, of
Louisiana granted Francis5 petition for writ of habeas corpus
finding that Francis did not knowingly and intelligently
waive his right to b® indicted by a fairly constituted grand
jury, finding In th® alternative that if th© test ware that
of Davis- cans© shown, than Francis had met that test by
virtu© of the inexperience of his couns©! in this proceeding.
Th® court also found that the grand jury which
indicted Francis did indeed exclude blacks and it vacated
the indictment, set aside the conviction, ordered the State
to reindict and retry Francis if it so desired.

The State

appealed to th® Fifth Circuit, and th© Fifth Circuit held
that th© Davis test is th® applicable test, not th® Fay v.
Noia test.

But it held that the Davis test in this case

because of th© absolute forfeiture rule in Louisiana would

10

require Francis to show prejudice, not cause, which is what
Davis speaks of, hut prejudice.
Now, the Fifth Circuit has taken two positions.,
When there have been State rules which parallel rule 12(h)(2),
•the Fifth Circuit has said that a State defendant must show
cause*

But in Louisiana, because the rule is on® of

absolufc® forfeiture, th© Fifth Circuit said that Francis must
show more than causa, h® must show actual prejudice.
Our position Is, first, that Pavia does not apply.
Davis does not apply because it turns upon th® fact that
Congress by adopting rui© 12(b)(2), th® Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure, set a new standard for determining waiver,
and that standard is on© of cause.

So Congress6 action vis-a-

vis 2255 is what Davis turns upon.

There is no analogous

provision regarding 2254.

Congress has not in any way

limited access under 2254, except by 'die: exhaustion of Stata
remedies, a requirement which is written into the statute.
So w® say Davis doss not apply.
But if th® Court were to find that Davis does apply,
then we believe Francis has met the test of Davis.

That test

is on© of cans©, because thm rule speak© of cause, Davis
speaks ©f cane®, and on© of the touchstones of causes is
ineffective assistance of counsel, and Francis' counsel was
ineffective, especially as protecting this very basic
constitutional right which he was entitled to.

11
Th& stat® has argued that the Davis test should
apply because the interests of the State and the Federal
Government are the s&m®.
If th® interests of the State and the Federal
Government are the same? then th® test —
QUESTION:

Is your claim any differant from th®

claim that you have not had adequate assistance of counsel?
MR. ROGOW:

It is different# your Honor# but we

do have a situation —
QUESTIONs

Well# if you had adequate ass:.stance#

there wouldn't be cause.
MR. ROGOW:

I think that's what Davis says#, yes#

sir.
QUESTION:
MS. ROGOW:

Well# I guess what you just said —
Yes.

QUESTION:-“is that you explain your causa by
inadequate assistance of counsel.
MR. ROGOW:

Because that is on® of the factors

used to determine cause.
QUESTION t
MR. ROGOW:
QUESTION:

What ©Is© is there here?
I’m sorry.

When you say wh&i ©Is© —

What els© is tdiere here in terms of

cause?
MR® ROGOWs
QUESTION:

That is the only cause in this ease.
So that your issue har® really is whether

12

h© had adequate assistance of counsel.

It might as well be

put that way.
MR. ROGOW:

I think that that probably is a fair

assessment, that that fact certainly is essential to our
anal.ysis of the case if Davis is the test.
QUESTION:

You base your position on the ineffective

assistance of counsels whereas you have already stated two
counsel in this case.
MR. ROGOW:

Ybu claim both were ineffective?
We claim that only Tureaud was responsible

for anything that happened prior to trial because by £madee’s
testimony he said that he had nothing to do with what Tureaud
may have done before h@ cam® into the case and before he told
Tureaud to file tha Prayer for Oyer and motion for a Bill of
Particulars.
QUESTION:

ihnadee did testify that

he felt* although

he wasn’t positive* that he had discussed whether or not a
motion should be made to suppress the grand jury indictment
for the grounds you now rely on.
a hundred murder cases.
MR. ROGOW:

Mid Amadee had triad over

How could he be incompetent?

The mere fact that he may hav© tried

over 100 murder cases, w@ don’t think, necessarily —
QUESTION:

I thought you argued that one had to try

at least on® —
MR. ROGOW:

No, I think — if the Court got that

impression, I apologise for it.

I use that only •—

13

QUESTXOHs

No matter whether you try one or a

hundred, you still may b@ incompetent.
MR* ROGOW:
QUESTION:
MR. ROGOW:
QUESTION:

Yes.
I suppose is correct.
Certainly.
So you are saying these particular

lawyers were incompetent.
MR. ROGOW:

We are saying that Tureaud was certainly

incompetent based upon the record that wa have in front of us.
Whether or not Amad@® did a competent job in helping Francis
at trial, actually w@ don't know, because there is no record
of this trial proceedings since no appeal was taken no
record was transcribed.
While I don't call into question Amadee5s credentials
at this point, because I don't think we have to, because
Tureaud had the responsibility for the.period of time that we
are concerned about, I think that the other factors that I
mentioned, the fact that no exception was taken to the denial
of the motion to suppress, the fact -that no appeal was taken
and Amadee said they didn't want to make this their life
work, that also makes one question the effectiveness of
Amadee for Francis in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, is it not a common experience for

lawyers when they finish a case to feel the result is a bad
result, an unjust result, but they wouldn't take a new trial

14
under any circumstances for fear of having a worse result?
Is that not so?
MR. ROGOW:
QUESTION;

Certainly ~
Civil cases, criminal cases, all kinds

of cases.
MR. ROGOW;

I. have no doubt that in soma cases that

certainly is a consideration, although in some ways it was
stated as one of the considerations in this case by jftraade©
saying that h® felt that if Francis came back for a new trial,
he might get a consecutive 30-year sentence upon a pending
robbery charge, although th© record in this case reflects
that that kind of consecutive sentence had never been given
in Orleans Parish, and perhaps could not even be given under
th© applicable Louisiana law.
QUESTION;

Could something worse than th© sentence

h@ got have been imposed?
MR. ROGOW;
QUESTION;
MR. ROGOW;

The death penalty?
Yes.
Certainly.

Perhaps it could have been

imposed, although questions ar© raised about that on a
successive trial whether or not the death penalty Would have
been appropriate to be imposed.

That question was not

resolved at that time, of course.
QUESTION;

Even if ifcfs technically inappropriate,

it isn’t a very pleasant sentence to have come to you, is it?

15
MR. RGGGWs

No, sir.

I agree.

Rut I think it's

important one© again that I stress that it is not any singleon® of thes® factors that supports our argument that Tureaud
and «made© were

ineffective.

It5s all of these arguments

taken together, all of th@sa facts taken together.
QUESTIONS

Some of your arguments would be addressed

against a. man alleged to hav@ been one of the great criminal
lawyers of all time when h® represented Loeb and Leopold
some 40 or 50 years ago and saved their lives, as he thought,
by getting them life sentences.
MR. RQGOW:

And I am sure that counsel in that

case, though, did not wait until the day before trial to file
motions and borrow forms from the District Attorney or
co-defendants in the case in filing the motions.
i

1 understand your position, Mr. Chief Justice, and

I think that perhaps the fact that no appeal was taken looked
at by itself could be explained in some way.

given in this record.

This record

That is not on© of the) reasons

And as I say, if one looks at the total

record, on® has to wonder about the effectiveness of assistances
received by Francis in this cas®.
QUESTION?

1 must say, Mr. Rogow, I share Justice

Marshall’s question as to your comments — no doubt based
on

..

— about Mr. Tureaud.

I can remember when I was

a law clerk her® seeing his name on briefs in this Court 20 -ode

16

years ago.
MR. ROGOW:

Mr. Justice Rahnquist, w@ know that

Mr. Tureaud practiced for a long time in New Orleans? we know
that, he practiced in civil rights cases in New Orleans.

But

1 don’t think that that fact in and of itself overcomes the
facts that we have developed in this record.

If the Court is

saying that it can take judicial notice of the fact that Mr.
Tureaud was an exceptional lawyer, I don't think that it can.
QUESTION;

No, that's not a fair thing.

do you have when you com© down to it?

But what

By hypothesis in any

cas© like this, you are always going to have the cast® where
the lav/yer failed to make a timely challenge to the grand jury.
Otherwise you wouldn't b© her®.

And if that's ineffective

assistance of counsel, then th© cause requirement means nothing.
You've got to show something more than the fact that, he
didn't do what he is now claiming he is relieved from doing.
MR. ROGOW:

I don't want, to bo trapped into th®

position that that necessarily is the proper test, because, as
I have said, we think that Fay is a proper test which is
knowing and intelligent waiver, which would not turn upon a
showing of ineffective assistance of counsel.
But if Davis is th® proper test, w® think that merely
not filing the grand jury challenge perhaps is not sufficient
to show cause in and of itself, because th© Court talks about
in Davis and in Shotwell effective assistance of counsel.

17
In Davis the Court notes that the Fifth Circuit viewed
Davis* lawyer as being extremely competent.

In Shoiwall

the defendants were represented by th© same lawyers twice
before this Court.

We think that is certainly on© of the

important factors.
Now, when one looks at those cases, on® would have
to examine all of the facts in the case, not just tlx® fact
they didn't file a timely grand jury challenge.

And we say

when all th© facts are looked at in this case, any presumption
of competence which may attach has been overcome,
QUESTIONS

You dwelt at some length by mentioning it

several times that h® borrowed some forms from th® prosecutor.
Isn't it again a matter of common human experience in th®
practice of law that court-appointed counsel and frequently
not court-appointed counsel will go and consult with the
prosecutor about a great many things and getting suggestions
from him.

All prosecutors are not fIliad with hostility.

In

fact, many of them are trying to cooperate with defense
counsel.
MR, ROGOWs
QUESTIONS

I can't disputa that, Mr. Chief Justice.
find th© fact that he borrowed a form

for whatever it was is no more important, really than th®
fact that he borrowed a form of subpoena from th© clerk.
MR. RQGGW:

No, I think that it is more important.

Quit© frankly, and maybe this is too subjective, but I think

18

it is offensive in a capital cas© where a man's iif® is at
stake, a young man's life in this case, that motions ar®
filed the day before trial, and they ar© not just borrowed for
the sake of borrowing the form, the whole form itself is
borrowed, and a lawyer with a pan strikes through the District
Attorney's name and writes in his own»

That seems to me to

show that not much preparation has gone into this kind of
motion, that on® is doing it perhaps on the spur of fch© moment
or last minute.

It certainly was last minute in this casa»

It is th® day before trial,

Tureaud was appointed on

February 3, tills first motion is on June 23, 1964.
QUESTION?

Th© motion for continuance you ar© talking

about?
MR, RCGQW:
QUESTIONS

Yes, sir.
Perhaps until that tint® h© hadn't decided

that h© wanted a continuance.
MR. ROGOW:

Perhaps that is true, but he had known

prior to that time that h© might haves wanted the statements
that Francis allegedly made,and th© Prayer for Oyer and motion
for Bill of Particulars is directed to that.

He certainly

should have known about that prior to th®. day before trial.
That motion could have been mad© then.
As I say, I think that it is wrong to -QUESTION?
Tureaud at all.

We don't have any explanation from
..

was in the hospital with terminal

19

canear»
MR. ROGOW:
of course.

Yes, sir,

And Tureaud has sine® died,

But the only explanation w@ have is that of Amadee

in the case.

And so Amadee5 s testimony has to b© the testimony

looked at in determining why th© motion was not filed and what,
if anything, Tureaud did.
Of course, our position is that Fay v. Noia providos
th© applicable standard.

If we are right about Fay v. Noia,

then th© question of cause does not com© into play at all.
And in this situation it's quit© clear that there was no
knowing and intelligent waiver mad® by Mr. Francis.
no deliberate bypass mad®.

There is

The record doss not reflect

d@libsrat© bypass, strategic decision mad© by Franci::, nor even
by Mr. Tureaud.

And if Fay v. Noia is th© proper standard,

then Abraham Francis has met that, test, too.
And w@ think it is especially appropriate to us® the
Fay v. Noia test in this case, because the right that's
involved bar© is a very important right, on® recognised by th®
Court from Strauder v. West Virginia through Alexander v.
Louisiana in 1972, on® that is embodied in a. Federal criminal
statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 243, which mates it a Federal offenses
to exclude, blacks from grand jury and petit jury processes.
So we think that it is very important that a defendant have
an opportunity, full and fair opportunity, to raise -;his basic
constitutional right.

We think that the Fifth Circu.it cut it

20

short by imposing an actual prejudice teste a test that places
a State defendant in a much more difficult position than th®
Federal defendant in Davis v.- United States»
bs.

That just cannot

The purposes of the Federal Habeas Corpus Act passed in

1867 show -that it was meant to implement the

I3th and 14th

amendments ratified in 1865 and 1868 respectively,and looking
at that together with 18 U.S.C. See, 243, passed in 1875, it3s
quite clear that this right is an important right, aid Francis
ought to have the opportunity to vindicate it in Federal
habeas corpus proceedings»

And we believe that he can

vindicate it in Federal habeas corpus proceedings under
Fay v, gfoia.

If Davis is applicable in this case, we believe

h® should have access under th® cause shown test in Davis
and h© has met that test and therefor© the Fifth Circuit was
wrong in applying any harsher test»
W® reserve th© balance of our time if indeed there
is any l©ffc.
