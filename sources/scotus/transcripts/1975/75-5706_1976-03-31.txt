ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLINTON A, CURTIS ON
BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, CURTIS?
it please the Courts

Thank you, Mr, Chief Justice, and may
The Court has already heard arguments

relating to the discretionary elements and features of the pre
and post-sentence procedures? which are basically the same
as those that exist in Florida.

I will therefor© limit my

remarks to the procedure under post-Furman statutes as they
relate to the actual structuring of the sentencing procedure
itself.
Florida's Death Penalty Act became law on the 8th of
December 1972, and sine© -that date some 70 have been sentenced
to die.

Nineteen of these sentences have

thus far been

Twelve sentences, Including the petitioner5s, have

been affirmed, and seven vacated.

I understand, there might be

one or two more that have been added to th® number since this
information was obtained approximately 30 days ago, but that's
as close as I could get.
Th© statutes of course provide for a. life sentence
upon conviction' of a capital felony —

MR. CURTIS;
QUESTION;

Vacated on death sentence.
Just on the sentence eass.

MR. CURTIS;

Yes.

The statutes of Florida provide that a life sentence
will be imposed upon a conviction for a capital felony and
consisting of not less than 25 years without hope of parole.
And this capital felony .is defined as premeditated murder or
murder during the commission of eight enumerated felonies, and
there is another capital felony which is rap© of a child 11
years or under.

But. 'the imposition of the life sentence is

mandatory unless the death penalty is determined and imposed
pursuant to the new Death Penalty Act.
a bifurcated procedure.

This Act provides for

Upon conviction for a capital felony,

a sentencing hearing is conducted before the same trial jury
in order to obtain and advise a recommendation of life or a
death sentence.

Mo reasons need be given in the verdict

returned by the jury.

It’s simply a statement that, "We, the

majority, have determined to recommend either life or death.53
That's basically the form, of the verdict that is given to the
judge.
The trial judge may notwithstanding the jury’s
recommendation enter either a sentence of life or death.

The statute requires a review of all death sentences

Eight aggravating and seven

mitigating circumstances ar© set forth in the statute for
consideration of the sentancer, the jury for advisory purposes,
the trial judge for sentencing purposes«
On the 26th of July 1373 the Supreme Court of Florida
held this particular Act constitutional,, acknowledging that
there was discretion in the sentencing procedure but that this
discretion, possible and necessary, was reasonable and controlled
and thereby complied with -the test of Furman v. Georgia.
The petitioner was charged in July of 1973 and was
convicted in March of 1374 of premeditated murder of on© Joel
Msdgebow by stabbing.

Petitioner's claim that the statute

was unconstitution was rejected on the? authority of 'the early
decision of State v. Dixon.

We submit the death sentences

.imposed under this statute ar© arbitrary because they may b©
and have been based on nonstatutory enumerated factors and

.that

the uncontrolled discretion of the sentencer is permitted and
required

to evaluate and apply the statutory circumstances.
Now, in the petitioner's ease the trial judge found,

as set forth in his written findings, four aggravating circum­
stances .

One of these circumstances was that the defendant

has a propensity to commit the crime for which he was charged
and that he is a danger and menace to society.

This is not on©

6
of the statutory enumerated aggravating circumstances„

In

affirming this death, sentence , th® Florida Supreme Court
approved the concept —
QUESTION:
MR, CURTIS:

How did it make that known?
By the affirmance itself«

And in an

earlier case, in Sawyer v. State, the defendant was convicted
of murder and robbery , and th® Supreme Court of Florida affirmed
th© trial judge's sentence of death citing, among other things,
that the defendant had certain tendencies —QUESTION:

I said the jury ~~
Well, you didn't say it, but 1 got th©

Itas not the jury that you are talking about now,

is it?
MR. CURTIS:

That's correct.

You see, all the jury

does under this system is to return th© verdict, of recommendation.
i

Then the trial judge, in the ©vent, and only in th© event, h@
determines to impose the death, sentence, he prepares a series
of written findings to support th® death sentence.

I must point

out, I think it's only fair to do so, that in State v. Diacon
there was a statement to the effect that th© Supreme Court
would urge the lower courts to file written findings in the
event they determine to impose life sentences also.

But I

this is not don©.

But in any event, to return to the point, your Honor,

7
in this respect —
QUESTION:

Mr» Curtis, while you. ar© interrupted

here, there were four aggravating circumstances here, ©no of
which was a nonstatutory.

Were the other three found by the

trial judge to b@ statutory —
MR, CURTIS:

circumstances and on® nonstatutory.

QUESTION;

then1?

The nonstatutory is the

Why was not the fourth simply superfluous

I don’t quit© understand the fore© of your argument on

•that.
MR. CURTISs

Th© fore® of the argument is this:

If

the trial judge felt that th® three aggravating circumstances
were sufficient to support his position that the death sentence
should be imposed, why was it necessary for him to come forward
and come with a nonstatutory aggravating circumstance?

And

this will become more relevant as we get into th© discussion
of sufficiency, which is this weighing process that Florida
requires and is somewhat different than any of th© other statutes
that have been thus far presented.
QUESTION:

Now, tell me again, wher© was that fourth,

the extra on®, articulated?
MR. CURTIS*:

In the written findings of th© trial

judge —•
QUESTION s

And your position is now that th© reviewing

8
• court than and now had no way of knowing whether that might
have been the dominant one or the basic one.

Is that your

point?
ME. CURTIS:

I think that’s a fair assessment of it,

your Honor.
Mow, as I said, Sawyer v. State stands for fch© same
proposition where there were additional nonstatutory aggravating
circumstances cited and with approval when the trial judge
cited"“as a matter of fact, the Supreme Court of Florida took
these facts and placed them in the notion or in fch© form of
aggravating circumstances, and those facts were pending
robbery charges against fch® defendant, the defendant’s demeanor
and conduct during the course of the trial, as well as the
defendant's alleged incurable drug habit.
Mow, the Supreme Court, has also approved and relied
on nonstat.ut.ory mitigating circumstances in the form of a
defendant’s war record, emotional strain of fch© defendant,
as well as sentences that have been administered to accomplices
or co-defenders which ar® less than death.
New, \m advance to the Court the notion that sine*®
the sentencer may rely on nonstatufcory factors, of course his
discretion cannot b@ controlled by the factors.
Now, to fch® point of weighing,the statute permits
the sentencer8s arbitrary evaluation of the enumerated
circumstances.

How, according to the statute the sentencer

9
determines whether sufficiant aggravating or mitigating
circumstances exist and whether the mitigating outweigh the
aggravating circumstances.

Nowhere in the statute do we have

a definition of th® terra "sufficient."

The weight or

relative significance of a circumstance or culmination thereof
is likewise

not in the statute.

1 am told that this

circumstance has more x-^eight or is entitled to more weight
than any other.
such

In other words, th© presence or absence of any

circumstance or culmination

thereof does not compel

This is somewhat different than th©

Federal statute wh®r@ you have aggravating circumstances and
if that is found to exist, such and such result will occur,
and then if mitigating circumstances exist, such and such
result will occur.

Thar© is no such definition in our statute.

QUESTIONS

Pre-Furman did th® jury sentence?

MR. CURTIS:

Yes.

QUESTIONS

What was th® instruction to the jury

then about sentencing, do you remember?
MR. CURTISs
QUESTIONS

Yes.
What was? that?

MR. CURTISi

It was basically, th© statute- provided

that in th© event of conviction, death would follow, unless
the jury recommended mercy, and the judge had absolutely
nothing to do with it.
QUESTION s

'What did they say to th® jury about th©

10
mercy?

Anything?
MR. CURTIS:
QUESTION:

That, was read —
Did they say it is within your discretion,

or what?
MR. CURTIS;
QUESTION:
MR. CURTIS:
of vagueness£

Yes.
Did they expressly say that?
I can't answer it quite that, way, because

it has been some time.

But I would have to say

it was left to their determination.
QUESTION s

We ar® safe in assuming that th© judge

informed them of that discretion.
MR. CURTIS:

Oh, y©8.

But. as to whether or not there

was an expanded instruction on fch© —
QUESTION:
MR. CURTIS:

Standards.
Yes.

I really don't recall.

Now, the Supreme Court has stated that its
responsibility in this overall process — and mind you, th®
statute does not define what the Supreme Court’s responsibility
is.

But th© Supreme Court has defined that it is to review

a. death, sentence case in -fch© light of facts presented in
evidence as well as oth©r decisions and determine whether or
not the sentence of death was too great.

And no opinion that

has been rendered by the Suprema Court of Florida thus far
affirming th© death sentence explains why a less harsh
penalty would not be sufficient, nor has any opinion compared

11
a death sentence case with the many life sentences imposed
for basically the same or substantially the same type of
conduct.

Such a comparative review is impossible, it’s frankly
»

impossible,, since th© many life sentences are reviewed, if at
all, not by th© Supreme Court of Florida, but by th© district
courts of appeal.
QUESTION:

Does a death sentence go directly to th®

Supreme Court of Florida?
MR. CURTIS:
QUESTION:

Yes.
As of right.

MR. CURTIS:

As a statutory direction it goes.

All

death sentences, whether, I assume, the defendant wishes or
not, will be automatically reviewed by th© Supreme Court of
Florida.

But in the situation where life sentences are imposed

for capital felonies, if reviewed, as I say, if at all, they
go to the district courts of appeals.
QUESTION:

Intermediate appellate court, with any

possibility of afterwards going to th© Suprema Court?
MR. CURTIS:

Only in the ©vent of a constitutional

question or you have —QUESTION:

Equivalent to certiorari jurisdiction

here, roughly so.
MR. CURTIS:
QUESTION:

That’s basically correct.
Does the Florida statute prescribe any

special standards for review by th© Supreme Court of Florida

12
comparable to those in Georgia?
MR. CURTIS %
QUESTION s

Non® whatsoever.
None whatsoever.

MR.CURTIS:

There is an absence of expression in the

statute on that point.
QUESTION:

Just the customary review.

MR. CURTIS:

I understand.

Well, customary review, as I say, the

Supreme Court of Florida has defined its review as something
more than just customary, I Would say.

It has taken upon itself

not only to review the sufficiency of the evidence or what have
you, but also to take upon itself to weigh whether or not this
death sentence is, as they say, too great and whether a less
harsh punishment would be adaquate under fch® circumstances.
QUESTION;
•the review

Do

the questions on the merits go with.

on the sentence?

MR. CURTIS:
QUESTION:

It's a total review.
Do you know whether and to what extant

the convictions have been upset in death cases that have been —
MR. CURTISs

2 don't believe that any of the seven —

as I say,this is my recollection — I don't believe

any of

the seven that were reversed were reversed because of
insufficiency of evidence.

It was directed totally at vacation

of the death penalty, and I am sure Attorney General Shevin

will correct me if X am in error in that regard.

13
As I say,

a

review of 19 opinions rendered by the

Supreme Court reflect that there is no meaningful basis for
distinguishing the death sentence cases from fell© 11£@ sentence
cases, that is, th© seven that have been vacated.

I realize

we could engage in a discussion that this case means this and
that case means that, this circumstance should be interpreted
this way, but I suggest to th© Court that we can demonstrate
and our brief does discuss just this.

Each aggravating

circumstance and each mitigating circumstance, we feel, is
relevant to a consideration of this statute, that lends itself
to the vagueness charge.
But to give you an idea what 'the Supreme Court of
Florida thinks of its procedure and how it assesses this
particular statute, I invite tine Court’s attention to page 86
of our brief, and X would only quote three sentences from that
quoted material, and this is from the Alvord case.
!!7h@ law does act require that capital punishment be
imposed in every conviction in which a particular state of
facts occur....Certain factual situations may warrant the
infliction of capital punishment, but nevertheless, would not
prevent either the trial jury, the trial judge, or this Court
from exercising reasoned judgment in reducing the sentence to
lif© imprisonment.

Such an exercise of mercy on behalf of th©

defendant in on® case does not prevent th© imposition of death

by capital punishment in th© other case."

14
without legislative formulation of the circumstances
or culmination thereof which warrant the executing or not
executing a defendant, the decision to execute is nothing more
than the function of the senlancer.

w© respectfully submit

that the Florida Death Penalty Act permits the arbitrary
imposition of the death penalty and is therefore violative
of the 8th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution»
Thank you.
QUESTIONS

Hay I just ask on© question?

Did you

say the statute would be less vulnerable if it did not have
any appellate review?
MR. CURTIS s
QUESTION;

Loss vulnerable if it did not have
If I understand you, you are pointing out

that the Supreme Court has without a reasoned basis granted
mercy in seven out of 19 cases when some of the other 12 ar®
really comparable.
MR. CURTIS;
QUESTION;

No.

Excuse me for interrupting.

1 was just wondering if your argument was

that, disparity could foe removed by removing the appellat© review
entirely.
MR. CURTIS;

No.

I don’t think the removal of review

is what we ar© directing ourselves to.

It’s not having

meaningful standards to guide that review so that everyone
knows where they ar®.

In other words, if w© ar© going before

the Supreme Court of Florida on this issue, you ar® going to be

15
talking about this, this, and this, and it's going to be fit
within a framework so that if a particular decision is
affirmed or reversed, it's affirmed or
clear reason,

reversed because of a

tod that.*s the problem we h&v© with the review

that we hav© her®.

There is no standard.

There is no standard

really to truly guide the sentencer, and there, is an absence of
standards to guide the Supreme Court of Florida in its review.
So Ism not urging that w© can make this statute good
by eliminating review.

Quit® the contrary.

X would like to r©s©rv© the remainder of my time
for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well,

Mr., Attorney General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. SHEVIN ON
BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SHEVIN;
it pleas© the Courts

Thank you, Mr, Chief Justice, and may
I would ilk© to comment on about five

different areas in th@ time that I have.

On© is to lift the

death penalty itself; secondly, the 8th Amendment question.
I know you have heard a lot on it today, but I do want to
comment on that question per se.

I want to comment on Mr.

Amsterdam*® attack on the system, because X think that’s pivotal
and 1 don’t car© what he calls it, what he is really doing is
attacking the whole system.

He is really talking about due

process, regardless of whether he calls it 8th Amendment or not.

16
because he says he is concerned about the fairness of the
system and that is due process, it*s nothing else.
1 would like to talk about our statute? 1 would like
to talk about our case.
Counsel quoted just before he sat down from th©
Alvord case.

Th© Alvord — A-l-v-o-r-d.

We hair® an Alford

and an Alvord, and both of them are in this Court.

Th® Alvord

case involved an upholding of the death sentence by the Florida
Supreme Court.

That case involved a mass murder, a man who

wiped out an entire family.

He raped and then killed a grand-

mother, a mother, and a daughter.

So I don't think that that

case speaks to th© issue of any discrimination

or arbitrariness

in the application of th® death sentence.

This may be th© only case that is before you in which

the sentence is specifically reviewed by th© Supreme Court.
And as has been demonstrated in sesae 19 cases, they have upheld
th© death, penalty in 13 cases and changed it from death to life

17
in six cases, hardly an arbitrary selectivity whan one-third
of those cases has resulted in bringing down of the penalty
from death to life»
Also f the Supreme Court is required to read the
entire record whether or not there is error alleged, and all
of this, we contend, is in response to Furman»

It was in

response to Furman that we created a bifurcated system, that
we created standards for the jury on the basis of aggravating
and mitigating circumstances, and that we created appeliat©
review of the sentence.
Mr. Amsterdam says that is different.
death is different.

We recognise

That's why we provided all these safe­

guards in death penalty cases, because it is differant.

And

I suggest to you that h@ doesn't want is to treat it
different ■— he wants a different results not a matter of
treatment, a matter of result.
I would also point out that our bifurcated hearing
goes to aggravation and mitigation, and it does involve not
just, the facts of the murder itself, but the unique qualities
of the defendant, all of the factors concerning ©ad?, particular
defendant.

In each of these cases, and 2 intend to review

them, there is a reason- why the Supreme Court changed it from
death to life.

Either it had to do with a family squabble

or affected the age of the defendant or it involved a cas© in
which tli© defendant had no prior criminal record.

18

With regard to fch® question of how many cases we
hav© had in Florida, MIr. Justice White asked that question
several times today.

In Florida we have had in the past three

years under the new death penalty law some 239 cases that have
been tried that could result in either death or life — 239
capital cases.

Of fchos® 239 ~

QUESTIONS
MR. SHEVIM:
yes.

Wait a minute?

239 convictions.

Two hundred thirty-nine convictions,

Of those 239, 64 ar© on death row.

for about 29 percent.

Sixty-four accounts

Again, hardly arbitrary selectivity.

By'the aam® token, Mr. Justice Burger, it is hardly
a rubber stamp.

It is not a rubber stamp when we hav® at

least — whan, w@ hav© 29 percent of the cases resulting in
death.

It is not a rubber stamp when the Supreme Court

reverses in one-third of the cases

and reduces it to life.

But by the asm® token, it is not arbitrary selectivity.
QUESTION:
convictions.

General Shevin, you said there were 239

You don’t mean convictions with sentence ©f death,

do you?

MR. SHEVIN:

That's correct.
Counsel mention*id the written findings,

and I do want to make it clear that the Supreme Court of
Florida in the maturing case law on this death penalty statute
has required judges below to enter detailed written findings
©von when they conclude life imprisonment rather than deaths
the concept being to allow the Suprema Court to be able to
look at those cases as well.
*

QUESTION%

Do you know — I suppos® it's awfully

hard to tell, but do you know or do you have any feeling

or

any evidence that the* rat® of not guilty verdicts has gone up?
MR. SHEVINs

No, sir, I don't believe at this point

wa could point to anything that would indicata whether it has
gone up or down.

I think as far as -die numoer of cases tnat

are going to trial, we have mor© murders in Florida, and as.a
result we have mors cases going to trial, and we probably have
more men on death row now, in response to a question that Mr.
Justice Stevens asked, w© probably do have a few more man,
there is not much difference, than we did pre-Furman.
QUESTIONt

By th© way, Mr. Attorney General, the

Solicitor General this morning suggested that Furman had
outlived its usefulness and suggested w© overrule it*

Do you

ask us to do that or not?
MR. SHEVIN:
overrule Furman.

I have not asked in our brief that you

I do think there is an inherent conflict

20
between MeGautha and Furman.

I do not think you can reconcile

those two cases, because in MeGautha you say basically that
juries ar© going to mak© the right decision.

In Furman you

say basically they may not.
QUESTIOMs

My question is, does Florida submit that

its public interest requires Furman be overruled?
MR. SHEVIN:

Your Honor, the reason we don’t say that

is because we cams back and adopted a statute with standards
and appellate review.
penalty statute.

W® did not adopt:

a

mandatory death

We think we have met Furman and therefore

since w® feel we have asefc Furman —
QUESTION:
MR. SHEVIN:

You may want another system.
No, w@ are satisfied with the system

that we have adopted post-Furman.
QUESTIONS

But if your case can’t clear Furman

hurdles, do you then ask that Furman bn overruled?
MR. SKEVIN:

If w® can’t clear Furman hurdles,we

would ask that it b© overruled, but w® really do believe that
w® provided a system that meets the arbitrariness that has
been outlawed in Furman.
Counsel talked about propensity and he said this
was an issue that cam® to the attention of the judge and the
jury and had nothing to do with the aggravating circumstances
©numerated in the statute.

And the Chief Justice at that

point said how did they determine propensity or whether he would

21
bs a danger to soeisty?
again.

Very simply,

le said h© would kill

W© have the testimony in the record of a psychiatrist,

of a doctor, and he was asking him — this was subsequent to
the trial.

Th© psychiatrist at -the hearing testified*"this

was after thay waived

confidentiality--h© felt he would do

damage to people in the future, that ha had already done
damage to tee people that h® had kill®!, and as a matter of
fact, on page 423 of the testimony, n£urthermcre he was
having similar feelings beginning to build up in the cell in
which he was confined and he felt this degree of hostility
being directed toward a specific inmate."

He told the doctor

and this was part of th® testimony that tee judge and jury
haard on whether or not h® should get death or life - - he told
th® doctor h© was going to kill again, that he had this urge
to kill again, that he might even kill, an inmate in th® jail
cell.
Now, why shouldn’t the judge: b© able to consider that?
Why shouldn*t th® propensity to kill?
Now, when teat came to th® Florida Supreme Court,
they recognized that teat was not one of the enumerated
aggravating circumstances, but th© Fie rida Supreme Court
through maturing case law ou this subject has in effect in
several of thefp® cases expanded the ag jravation and expanded
the mitigating circumstances.

As a matter of fact, in the

Gardner case they say that a PSI saying that someone is going

22
■to be a menace to society can be considered.

In the Hallman

cas© they said the fact that the d@fesf.dant was nanrehabilitatable
can be considered.

In our case, in the Proffitt case, the

propensity to commit another crime was added aggravating
circumstances.

In the Sawar

to kill the judge.

E© said,

case, Sawyer said he was going
Mian I get back out of prison,

I5m going to kill the judge, I'm. going to kill the prosecutor.
So this judicial threat was considered as an additional
aggravating circumstance.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Attorney General, just so I under­

stand, the nonstatutory additional aggravating circumstance
is not. a substitute for statutory circumstances, just additional
factors may be considered.
MR. SHEVINi

Your Honor, the statute says that

they can consider all relevant material.

The Supreme Court

has said anything that's relative, of probative value and has
not been admitted in violation of the Constitution of the
United Statas or Florida can be considered as long as it
deals with either aggravation or mitigation.
QUESTION:

But it remains tine that on® of the ten

statutory, or whatever the number is,

aggravating circumstances

must be found.
MR. SHSVINs
there were four.

Oh, yes, I think so.

In this cas©

Only on© of them was no«statutory.

QUESTION:

I understand.

23

MRo SHEVIN:

As a matter of fact, I want to point

out th© fairness of this procedure because the Supreme Court
of Florida has also found some non-enumerated mitigating
circumstances.

Again, relevancy is the key.

In the Slater

case they reduced it from death to life because a co-conspirator
had gotten life, and they felt it was unfair to give on© of
them death when the other on© got life.

So that was th® basis

of reducing it by th® Florida Supreme Court.

In th® Taylor

case ther® was a question as to whether h© actually pulled th©
trigger.

They weren't sure h® pulled the trigger, and as a

result they reduced it because they weren't sure ha was the
triggerman.

In the Gardner case they said intoxication is an

unenumerated mitigating circumstance.
was a nondeliberate killing.

in th© Swan

case it

It was a felony murder and they

beat this woman, but they said there w&s no evidence that
they intended to kill her.

They put her in th© closet, and

because of th© preexisting medical condition, sh® died in th®
closet, and th© Supreme Court of Florida said that it was
basically a nondeliberate felony killing and as a result it
could be mitigated.
In the Proffitt, case, what we are dealing with here,
ther® was a danger to society, h© will kill again by his
own statement, he has a propensity to kill, h© has an
uncontrollable appetite to kill, which is not synonymous with
diminished mental capacity.

There has been testimony in th©

24
record by two psychiatrists that he understood the criminality
of his acts.

Thar® was not one mitigating circumstance, and

there were four aggravating circumstances.
Now, Mr. Justice Powell, you asked in the last case
what kind of review can b© had by the Supreme Court, and is
there any basis, any standard for that review?

In the Dixon

case, which is our leading Florida case, the Supreme Court of
Florida said that review by this court guarantees that the
reasons presented in on© case will reach a similar result to
that reached under similar circumstances in another case.

No

longer will on© man die and another live on the basis of race
or a woman live and a man die on the basis of sex.

If the

defendant is sentenced to die, this Court can review that case
in light of all the other decisions and determine whether or
not the punishment is too great.
They go on in the case to say that we consider it
reasonable to require the trial judge to enter a detailed
written finding even when ha imposes life, even though the
statute said it was only required when he imposed death.
So X think that the Supreme Court of Florida has
matured this law, has rounded out the circle, and has set forth
under what circumstances the death penalty can foe applied,
under what circumstances it cannot be applied, and all of this,
we contend, has been don® subsequent to Furman in order to
meet Furman.

QUESTION %

How about your opp- )nent? s contention that

the findings in the life cases # that th sy really never get to
the Supreme Court of Florida because they went in the district
court of appeals?
MR. SHEVINs

Well# as I point, sd out a moment ago#

Mr. Justice Rshnquist# th® Supreme Court of Florida has said
ws want feh® judges to enter written findings even in the life
cases# and they have been traditionally argued.

Every time

someone comes to th© Supreme Court of Florida# if they think
there is a life case similar to theirs that ought to get them
life rather than death# they rely on it very heavily# and those
are reported cases in th© Southern Reporter# and they ar©
available to the Supreme Court of Florida* Even though they
are not reviewed by th© Supreme Court of Florida# we contend
fchsy are available and are considered bj the Supreme Court of

Florida.

And as a matter of fact# let me relate

t0

cases they referred to# because X think this is vary

significant.

On page 85 of their brief they say#

“There appears

no rational -explanation as to why the Petitioner must suffer

daafch while the convicted murderers Swan, Halliwell and Tedder

So it's

a little different than th© question you asked.
But let me talk about thos® three cases.
case, there was a beating, th© woman was beaten.
didn't beat her to try to kill her.

In the Swan
Again, he

He put her in a closet

and she died, and the Supreme Court said it was nondeliberate
homicide, and that's why they reduced it to life in the Swan
case.
In the Halliwell case it was a love triangle, a
family squabble, no prior record.

The defendant in th® css®

was a Vietnamese, or a Vietnam war veteran, excuse me.
a Green Beret.

H@ was

Th© Suprema Court said he had been insensitized.

K® was a Green Beret, he had severe «notional disturbance, and
it is true that after h® killed this person, after he killed
this man, he cut th© body up into little; pieces and disposed
of it.

And th® Supreme Court had to cor'.sidar was that heinous,

,

was that' atrocious, and they concluded that he cut th© body up
after the killing, and therefor© it wasn't particularly heinous
or atrocious and cruel.

And that is, I think, a logical position

that th® court could have taken in light, of th© fact that th©
killing had already occurred.
So there were circumstances concerning th® defendant
in th© Halliwell case.

27
In th® Teddar cas®,. again it was a domestic squabble.
There was a killing in this case of a iaoth©r-in-law.

Th®

Supreme Court of Florida said it was not particularly heinous,
there were no prior circumstances.
In th® Thompson case which they rely upon, th©
defendant was a 17-year-old boy, again, with no prior criminal
record.
How, th© on© cas© thay point out where, if I war®
sitting I might have reached a different conclusion, was th®
Powers cas®.

Th® Powers cas© was a young man — and in their

appendix, I -think it's vary convenient that they said his
ag® was not available from th® record»
His age happened to be 18.

His age was available»

And obviously that was the basis

on which th© lower court — this was a case where th® lower
court,the jury recommended death, the judge imposed life.
in this cas© it was a rather heinous crime.

And

Ha cam® into a

store, ha showed no remorse afterwards, he sat the man down on
a chair .and ha shot three bullets in his head.
How, if I war® sitting on that case, perhaps I would
have reached a different conclusion and perhaps I would have
imposed death.

But wh&iPlb interesting about th© Powers cas®

is that it does involve .a young man who ‘the court below felt
had been culturally deprived. It did involve a young man who
was less than 18 years old, who had less than a fifth grade
education, and under those circumstances, th® judge felt that

28
life was sufficient.
And the ©th«sr interesting point is that at the time
the Powers ©as© was decided, the Supreme Court of Florida
had not yet decided Diacon, so th© lower court judge didn't
have the benefit of the Dixon cas© or tiny of the maturing case

?
law at the tint® he imposed lif© on Powers. The Jeffrey cas®
is another cas© involving a domestic quarrel, no criminal
record, fifth, grade education.

Those nr® th© cases he refers

to, and w@ contend that there has been no showing of discrimina»
tion, that in each of those cases ther© was not arbitrary
selectivity, that in each of those cassis it involves cases
in which there was ample reason for mitigation.

He doesn't

tell you about a case which is pending in your Court, the
Alford case, a cas© involving a rape and murder of a 13~y©arold girl in Palm Beach who was both vaginally and anally
assaulted, and then shot sight times,twice in the head.

H©

doesn't tell you about another case per.ding in your Court
involving an 11-year-old boy who happened to be riding his
.bicycle ora the wrong street at th© wrong time and was mutilated,
torn limb from limb.

And these are th* kinds of cases, these

are the kinds of heinous cases 'that we have pending as a result
of th© crimes that are committed in th<i State ©£ Florida.
Mr. Justice Blackman, you asked at th© very beginning
of this proceeding, you asked, wouldn't the kind of elaborate
statutes that Mr. Amsterdam was complaining about, the so-called

29
winnowing devices, wouldn't they have been predicted or
expected under Furman.
mandatory death.

H® said, well# we might have predicted

Let me talk about that for just a moment.

When I first read Furman, and everybody hits gone through these
same throes, what did Furman mean, what did it say, what's
required, I was concerned that maybe ws wer® required to pass
a mandatory death penalty.

I didn't l:.k@ that, because I

don't, -think mandatory death penalties :.n and of themselves
are the fairest kinds of justice.

And then when we reread

Furman, and w© particularly read what the Chief Justice said
when he said that legislative bodies may now seek to bring
their laws into compliance with.the Court's ruling by providing
standards for juries and judges to follow in determining the
sentence by more narrowly defining the crimes for which they are
being imposed or determining or providing standards for juries
and judges.
Well, that's exactly v/hat Florida did.

Florida

eliminated rape from its capital crime category except if it
involves the rape of a young child less than 11, so it narrowed
the crimes, and Florida for the first time provided standards,
it provided aggravating circumstances, it provided mitigating
circumstances, it provided a bifurcated hearing, it provided
a review, all of ‘these, precisely what the legislature did
in response to Furman.
But 1 think this is more important.

When 1 went to

30
to the legislative committees and in their brief they quote
my statement saying that mandatory is probably the safest way
to gof and when I went to -the legislative committees, that's
the position I took, after having read Furman once or twice.
And when I went to the legislative committees, the expression
of the legislative body was

this;

We would rather pass a good

lav/, a fair law that might be suspect, than to pass a mandatory
death penalty, even if it’s allowed by Furman, because it is
harsh. And that's the kind of legislation the Florida legislature
passed.

They didn't pass mandatory death,” -they have attempted

to remove the arbitrariness from the system, they have attempted
to remove the discretion so that w@ have reasoned judgment
which is the conclusion of the Supreme Court of Florida, and
they have attempted to have review, which is so very, very
important.
They agreed, Mr. Justice Blaokmun, and with you,
Mr. Chief Justice, that to provide mandatory death was a step
backward.

Mow, ©very State has to do ;h®ir own thing and. has

to make their own decision, but that was the decision of the
Florida legislature, and we have responded to Furman.
The petitioner in his brief, even though he didn't
mention it today, in his brief he says that the death penalty
is still being applied disproportionately to blacks and to poor
people.

Now, maybe that was true prior to Furman, maybe that

was true, but it's not true, under Florida's new death penalty

31
law.

la 1373

s

574

,

and *75, those three years since we have

had our new law, more blacks have beer arrested for killing,
for murder, than whites, about one-third more, and yet on
death row today — today, not when the brief was filed, but
today — we have 64 people on death row, and of those 64, 34
of them are white and 30 of them are black.

So we actually

have more people who happen to be whites on death row than
black people, yet the proportionate number of those kinds of
crimes being commifcfcesd happens to be about a third higher
going the other way.

We think this demonstrates that we have

even-handed justice in Florida, and incidentally, one-third,
one-third of all those on death row in Florida retain their own
counsel, not court-appointed counsel.

So we do not have just

poor people on death row, we do not have just black people on
death row.

We have even-handed justice.
Let ms comment on the deterrent aspects.

If capital

punishment doesn't deter, then punishment doesn't deter.

The

whole pain-pleasure philosophy of soci- ty is based on the
theory that punishment does deter, and the ultimate punishment
cietors the most.

It obviously deters that individual who

cannot kill again, it deters the robbers and the rapists who
will sustain a greater punishment for murder than for rap® or
robbery, and therefore may not eliminate the only

'eyewitnesses

to the crime in order to avoid apprehension, and w® think it
deters homicide generally.

32
Mr. Justice Powell# you commanted earlier about the
increasa- in homicides' which you were amazed at had gone over
50 percent.

The figures are really quite higher than -that.

If you go back and look at the murder cate in this country# in
1930# 1940, 1950# all the way up to 1£ 55# you will find that
‘there were approximately 7 to 9 -thousand murders committed
each and ©vary year.

That figure has

jumped from between

• and 9 thousand up to 22 thousand# and this is the decision
•that the legislature made# this is the decision that ‘they have
a right to make# and we contend that this is basically a
legislative decision# -that contemporary standards of decency
are determined

by what the legislature and what, the people

want.
Sine© X only have a few moments left# I want to
direct ray attention# if I may# to the question of -the system.
Now# what they are saying is that because of this discretion#
the system is wrong.

Now# obviously# they don't want a system

ini which only capital offenses can ba charged, in which only
first degree murder charges can b© brought back# in which no
clemency can b© exercised# but that's exactly what they are
saying to us today.
Mr. Justice^ White# in Ar ger s i ng®r v. Hamlin # you
told

the State of Florida it didn't make any difference whether

a man was facing- a misdemeanor charge or a felony charge# th©
inside of the jail looked the same.

And I contend that th©

33
inside of the jail looks the same to someone under life
imprisonment or 5 years or 99 years as.
facing the ultimate punishment.
QUESTIOM:

MR. BKEVI'N:

it does to someone

If the 8th Amendment argument

The Court said fcl at.
The Court said that, y@s, sir.

I was

talking about during 'the discourse of the argument.
If the 3th Amendment argument that ha says applies
only in capital cases,logically, legally, you cannot apply
that only in capital cases.

True death is different, but the

8th Amendment doesn't apply just to capital cases, the 8th
Amendment applies, it has traditionally been applied, to less
than capital easess, and the du@ process provision talks about
life, liberty, or property, and if you are going to deprive
somebody of life and you’re going to say we can't do that
because there is prosecutorial discretion, jury discretion,
executive clemency, I submit to you that 'that same argument
applies to a lifer, and even though Mr. Amsterdam stands before*
this Court and says, "I am only trying to apply it in death
cases” tharfe is no way he can foreclose someone who is under
a life sentence coming back to this Court and saying,
me that same protection."

"Give

Equal justice under law, that’s

what the front, of the building says, and that's exactly what
a lifer is going to say, -that’s exactly what a man under 5
years, .20 years,vand 99 years is going to say.

H© is going

to say that if you say the whole systcin is wrong, then it’s

m
34

wrong as to him as well.

And for tho. e reasons, w© urge you

to affirm this conviction, to state i:

effect that -the whole

system is not wrong, to state that ca; ital punishment is not
cruel and unusual per se, and that it cannot b@ applied as an
8th Amendment violation just in capit .1 cases so as to attack
in effect the entire criminal justice system.

I would like to point out that while we have this

alleged array of increase and the num' er of murders and non©
of us here anyplace in this room is suggesting that we approve
of it, and ©v©ryon©ss appalled by it.

But to say that, because

of the absence of this form of punishment that somehow we
are going to affectively treat -that particular problem
disallows for the fact, that every oth r form of serious crime
has accelerated far greater proportionate, and and we assume
that appropriate punishment is being ! efcsd out in terms of
what the legislature thinks ought to be done with it.
But I do not wish to get into an exchange about
statistics and what they mean or what the effect will be, but
I would like to comment on two things:

One, the Attorney

General referred to equal justice und^r the law.

Well, I

think that's what this whole argument is about, and that's
what we are here for.
in Swan y.

It seems inconceivable to me that

State where you have what is described by the

trial judge as an outrageous, wicked, vile, atrocious, cruel
and heinous crime committed during the course of a robbery,
that was the beating death of an elderly housekeeper, and th©
Supreme Court in light of those two aggravating circumstances
takes a position -chat, and I quota, "‘Ihere were insufficient
/
aggravating circumstances to justify th© imposition of the

36
death penalty»

Attorney General Shavin is suggesting that these are supposed
to be, we are going to have standards
