MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Mr. Eas terbrook.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK H. EASTERBROOK, ESQ.,
ON BEHAIF OF PETITIONER
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

til© Court:
The issue in. this case is whether an indigent prisoner
who did not appeal his conviction has, under th© Constitution,
an unconditional right to obtain a transcript of his trial for
perusal in th© hop© that th© transcript will disclose errors,
the. nature of which he doss not yet know.
Put:, another way, th® question is whether Congress
ovar"Stepped its constitutional powers when it required indigent
prisoners to show that they had some need of a transcript to
support a non~fr ivo'louA claim for relief.
Th© facts of this case are not complicated.

Respondent

was convicted in 1970 of uttering forged currency and sentenced
co ten years imprisonment.

He did not appeal that conviction.

Counsel for respondent has represented that the reason h© did
not appeal was in order to avail himself of a more prompt motion
in the District Court for reduction of sentence.

The District

Court denied that motion.
in March 1972, respondent filed (pro se) a motion for

4
transcript, in Forma Pauperis.

The Chief Judge of the District

Court instructed th© clerk of tha court to return that motion
to respondent* instructing him that he should file instead a
motion for collateral relief? pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2255.
In June of 1972? respondent filed a complaint for
declaratory and injunctive relief? which the District Court
allowed to be filed as a civil action.

Th© complaint alleged

that respondent desired collateral relief? that he believed
that his counsel at trial had been inadequate? and that he be­
lieved that the evidence was insufficient to support his con­
viction .
The complaint also alleged that respondent's memory
and trial notes were inadequate and -that without a transcript
;.® would b® unable to frame his arguments for fair and effective
relief.

The prayer for relief in the —
QUESTION!

Did the District Court consider this? the

underlying pleading, as one filed under 2255 of Title 28?
MR. E&STERBRQQK:

Th© District Court did not state how

It. was considering the complaint.

It dismissed it for failures

to arate a claim upon which relief could be granted.

We believe

-.hr/.;, the bast, interpretation of this is that it considered it as
i complaint under 2255 and the '-request fear a transcript is
ancillary to that complaint, and they dismissed it accordingly.
QUESTION;

But th© court never explicitly --

MR. EASTERBROOK:

The court never explicitly settled

5
those grounds?.
QUESTION:

Mr. Easterbrook, is the respondent on parole

now?
MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

Is he working?

MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:
he is still indigent.

Yes, ha is.

I do not know, Your Honor.

Maybe I should ask your opposition whether

MR. EASTERBROOK:

Vie do not believe that it has become

He is still in custody for purposes of collateral relief,

so long as b® is on parole, and his parol© runs through 1980.
If he is no longer indigent, tills case might bacome moot, but
we have no reason to believe that that is so.
QUESTION:

fell, if he is employed, he might not be.

Mir. EASTERBROOK?
QUESTION:

That5s correct.

At least we are not brought, up to data.

MR. EASTERBROOK:

W© are not up to date.

The record

in this case closed as of 1973, and w© have no further Informa­
tion as to his indigency after that date.
QUESTION:

Do you have any idea what the transcript

70 7Id entail, how lengthy it would •be?
MR. EASTERBROOK:
two -day trial, Yorar Honor.

The transcript is a transcript of a
It would probably cost in the nature

of $400f alt.hc. igh w© hove not obtained an exact estimate.

6
QUESTION;

I gather the stenographic minutres are

still available?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

The stenographic minutes are still

available;, although they have not been transcribed.
Tli© prayer for relief asked the District Court to de­
clare that respondent has "an absolute constitutional right to
a verbtaim transcript of his criminal trial, supplied at governm©nt expense, to aid him in preparing a. motion for collateral
relief."

The complaint is, in essence, simply an asswertion of

respondent's good faith.

It asserts the respondent believes

that his trial notes are inadequate and that h© believes that he
is entitled to relief.

But it sets forth non® of the grounds

upon which those beliefs were based.
Tii© District Court appointed counsel for respondent in
order to investigate the claims, because the files and records
of tie case did not fully disclose whether he was entitled to
ihr transcript, he sought.

The investigation with the aid of

::ounss! disclosed no grounds upon which a transcript was needed,
other than, as respondent's counsel candidly admitted to the
Court of Appeals, to peruse in the hope that some error, the
mtvre of which could not yet b© determined, might show up,.
The District Court ultimately dismissed the complaint
:or failure to stata a claim.

The Court of Appeals reversed,

molding that a transcript must b© provided upon request for
search for error.

7
w© believe taat the starting point for ass inquiry into
an indigent'& right, to a trial transcript is 28 U.S.C. 753 (f),
That section provides that a trial transcript can be furnished
without charge to an indigent prisoner proceeding in a motion
for collateral relief under section 2255, and I quote:

"If the

•ferial judge or a circuit judge certifies that th® suit or appeal
is not frivolous and that the transcript is needed to decide the
issue presented" — in other words, an indigent prisoner, far
from being cut off on account of poverty from evidence 'that may
be important to some collateral claims — "is entitled by
t&tute to a trial transcript if he can show, first, that 'the
transcript is necessary to support certain factual allegations?
and, second, that those allegations, if proved by the transcript,
would amount to a non-frivolous claim for collateral relief."
There can .ono doubt that Congress meant to impose
upon applicants the burden of dsmonstrating need and lack of

frivo.lity.

The Court of Appeals so held, and that portion of

its opinion is reproduced at pages 8a to 10a of our petition for
certiorari. *

both state and fedsral courts, a rule that had prevailed ia
collateral cases until the decision below, a rule that a
prisoner must show more than a subjective desire for a transcript
in a collateral proceeding in order to b® entitled to it.
We believe that this legislative history and the al­
most universal rule in habeas corpus proceedings also disposes
of res pond-antc s argument that section 753 (f), as worded and as
construed by the Court of Appeals, suspends the privilege of the
writ of habeas corpus.

Par from suspending the privilege of the

writ of habeas corpus, section 753(f) makes access to a tran­
script identical
2255.

under both habeas corpus and under section

There is no suspension.
QUESTION:

There is no statute explicitly dealing with

this subject in habeas corpus, is there, in federal habeas
corpus?

You say it is a case law?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Well, section 753(f) says that you

can obtain a transcript without charge in habeas corpus cases.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. EASTERBROOK:

The case lax? is and was in .1965, and

■ r&s before th&n, that you must make the same showing that
lection 753(f) requires in 2255 cases.

But it is a case law

requirement, rather than an explicit statutory on®.
QUESTION:

As far as the statute goes, it just says

you can obtain it?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

That’s right.

9

Section 753(f), we think, does no mor© than enact into
law th© observations of this Court in many of the cases, be­
ginning in 1956 in Griffin v. California — Griffin v. Illinois,
excuse me — dealing with the right to a transcript.

This

Court has observed many times that a transcript is not necessary
in every case, and that in many cas-as lass than all of the tran­
script will sufficst, and th© legislature can take steps to
effect those rules.

Section 753(f) is such a step.

Th© ques­

tion here, therefor®, is whether the device Congress has chosen
is unconstitutional.

The burden of my argument is that Congress has pro­
vided indigents with multipla opportunities to review their
criminal convictions and multiple opportunities to obtain a
■transcript, that would facilitate such review.

Congress there­

fore has not cut off review on account of a person’s poverty.
It has simply structured and confined th© methods by which such
review can be obtained.
Congress has provided the fair opportunity for review
that this Court, has held is required.

It is true, of course,

that th© provisions of section 753(f) requiring an indigent
person to shew nr.-M and lack of frivolity do not apply to a

per a on who car, pay for his own transcript, and in that sense the
destitute and th© wealthy are not treated identically.

Th©

Court of Appeals thought this to ha fatal, but this Court has
hit Id that absolute ©quality is not required, and th© fact that ©

10
particular tool might fee of use to some defendants and appli­
cants for collateral relief does not mean that the Constitution
requires its provision.

The Constitution requires a practical

opportunity for effective review, and we believe that Congress
has provided that opportunity.
QUESTION:

And if fee had taken a direct appeal, then

under the Criminal Justice Act ha would have got a complete
trans cript?
MR. EASTERBROQK:
QUESTION:

Or as much as was necessary?

MR. EASTERBROOK:
the very first way.

Exactly, Your Honor, that is —

As much as was necessary.

That is

Every defendant convicted in a federal

criminal case has a right to appeal and, we believe, that is
also true, in every state with respect to serious crimes.

On

appeal, under the Criminal Justice Act, an indigent defendant
has a statutory right to a transcript or a record of sufficiant
completeness as to allow him to present all of his claims on
appeal.

In almost every case, a full transcript is prepared or

in, -greed s-tatsmsnt of facts is reached.

In all cases in which

i. vr ';-ya.'i, frl is appoints# on appeal, the Criminal Justice Act.
requires a full transcript to be prepared, and this Court, has so
held in Hardy v. United States.
An indigent defendant who seeks collateral relief —
QUESTION:

Aad before you proceed, the same rule would

be constitutionally required in any state appeal?

11
MR. EASTERBROOK:

This Court has hald that it is re­

quired in state appeals.
QUESTION:

1 danEt know that there is a decision

analogous to the Hardy ease is. the state, courts, but roughly
equivalent —
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Yes, roughly equivalent.

At least

there would h@ a requirement of a record of sufficient complete­
ness to allow you to present your claim on a more complete line.
QUESTION:

Griffin v. Illinois and its progixiy?

MR. EASTERBROOK:

I think so, Your Honor.

An indigent defendant for whom such a transcript or
record has been prepared and who later seeks collateral relief
is entitled without charge to a copy of that ‘transcript, and
therefore every indigent defendant has an adaquat® opportunity
both to obtain the transcript and to obtain full review of his
claims without charge and without making a particular showing of
need simply by appealing.

He needs to resort to the standards

sneer section 753 only if he elects not to appeal.
say

2*0

That is to

defendant, in the federal system is denied a transcript on

iiccount of his indigence.
The respondent's currant difficulties stem from his
decision not to appeal and not from the federal statutes that
govern provisions of transcripts.
Then, too, w& think there are sound reasons for the
incision of Congress to create a different standard when a

12
prisoner se.aks a transcript for us© in preparing a motion for
collateral relief.

The difference acts as a channeling device

encouraging appeals, rather than delayed collateral attacks.
Congress was entitled to conclude that this was diesrable be­
cause it enables and indeed encourages errors in trial to be
detected and corrected more quickly.
QUESTION:

Under the Court of Appeals opinion, would

it make any difference whether the post-conviction relief sought
was two years, five years, or ten years
MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

None at all. Your Honor.

— or twenty years?

MR. EASTERBROOK:

None at all, as long as the person

was still in custody for purposes of 2255, the Court of Appeals
view would require the preparation of the transcript.

That

might b© difficult in some cases if the original stenographic
•tapes have been destroyed or lost.

Usually it is much less

likely that that would happen if the transcript had been tran­
scribed .
QUESTION:

tell, except you concede that the statute

provides that even if it is five years, ten years, fifteen
years, eighteen years, twenty-three years, that if he shows the
need
MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:
to the transcript.

That's correct.

— if he shows the need, that he in entitled.

13

MR. EASTERBROOK:

That is correct, Your Honor.

But

there would be some difficulties, we think, under the Court of
Appeals rule if the transcript could not be prepared and there
were

21c

established need for it.

In that event, the remedy

might be collateral relief for want of a transcript, even though
there would be no need for the ‘transcript.

That problem would

not arise if the transcript had to be furnished only upon the
showing of section 753 (f).
QUESTION?

But under the Court of Appeals opinion,

whether it is two years or twenty yeas

or thirty, they need

show no reason for the need —
MR. EASTERBROOKs
OUST ION;

No, no reason whatever, Your Honor.

— no demonstration at all.

MR, EASTERBROOK:

That's correct, no demonstration at

all is required.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't there an implicit limitation in

the Court of Appeals holding at least reserving the question of
whether if fehs reporter had died, his notes were unavailable,
and a transcript simply couldn't be prepared — I didn't read
the Court of Appeals opinion to suggest the man would simply be
out on the street for that reason.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

The Court of Appeals did not specific­

ally address that question, Your Honor, as indeed it did not
have to because the transcript could be prepared in this case, if
that is necessary, and I think that question is still fairly

14
open to litigation in th© Ninth Circuit.

I don’t want to in­

dicat® that the court has decided that one way or the other.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Eas ter brook, supposing in his motion,

hs had alleged that his trial counsel was ineffective in that
he had failed to make objections to the admissibility of evi­
dence from time to time during th© trial that competent counsel
would normally make.

Would h© be entitled to a transcript?

MR. EASTERBRQOK;

It is our position that under those

circumstances that would probably not state a claim for relief,
even if supported by th© transcript.
reasons:

That would be so for two

toe, because, under most circumstances, that would not

make out inadequate assistance of counsel; and the second be­
cause that, is the kind of claim of inadequate assistance of
counsel that could be raised effectively on appeal.

It is the

type of trial tactics and trial decisions that can be reviewed
very effectively on appeal.

And unleys the allegations of in­

effective assistance of counsel were coupled, Mr. Justice
Stevens, with a contention that counsel was also ineffective in
failing to advise him of his right to appeal and failing to
pursue an appeal* we halier/© that those kinds of claims should,
a© raised on direct appeal and not on collateral attack.
QUESTION:

Wall, if th© only error goes to the compe­

tence of counsel — perhaps I should change th© example to make
It a. little atrotg-ar that he didn’t make the objections which
my trained lawyer would make -- you know, the standard is

15
framed differently in different circuits — hut assume he had
mat in conclusory terms the standard, how can you charge him
with the failure to appeal if he relies exclusively on the
advice of the; man he now says is incompetent but didn't realize
at. the time was incompetent?
MR. ESTERBRQQK:

There must b© some reason to inquire

whether part of the incompetence dealt with failure to pursue
the appaal.

Assuming, however, that part of the incompetence

dealt with advising him accurately of what would be grounds for
appeal and whether there were prospects, if there were a de­
tailed showing and if the claim was of such pervasive error
throughout the trial that no reasonably effective counsel would
have engaged in this course of conduct, that might be the kind
of claim that would require the preparation of a full trial
transcript.
QUESTION: . But: I think if that would not b® sufficient*
if it were merely stated: as a conclusion.
MR. EASTB-IBROdKIf it were just; simply stated as the
vc iiusion here, that is ray counsel was ineffective, it surely
would not b© sufficient.

There would foa varying degrees of

sufficiency of adequacy of a claim.

QUESTION:

Here he alleges that ho was so inef f**cH«-.-»

that the defendant5s Sixth Amendment right, was: violated.
MR. EASTERBROOKs

If that is the only conclusion, that

is not adequate to require a trial transcript,- not only because

16
of the reservations 1 have expressed in answer to your earlier
questions, but also because there are many ways in which trial
counsel could be inadequate that simply would not show up in a
transcript, and an adjudication of th© adequacy of counsel could
take place without a transcript but with extrinsic material or
with portions of th® transcript, or if greater specificity could
be provided, it could be determined that there was no merit to
th© claim even if proved to th® last particular»
There are many stopping points along the way between
the claim and the adjudication, and not all of those [Stopping
points are going to require a transcript to determine where it
is.

That is, I think, a very sound reason why Congress was en­

titled to require th© applicant to state the nature of his claim
so that it could be determined whether -this was one of those
casas in which th® transcript was needed or whether it was not.
There are a number of differences between direct
appeal and collateral attack that w© think support the decision
of Congress to impose different standards upon access to a tran­
script under them.

I have discussed some of then in answer to

Mr. Justice Stevens' questions.

They stem primarily from the

fact that collateral attack is not a substitute for direct
appeal, and that most of the grounds upon which ordinary collator
al attacks would be based, for example, th© double jeopardy
clausa or the unconstitutionality of the statute underlying con­
viction, simply don't show up in the transcript at all.

17
Conversely, most of -the errors that would show up in
a transcript do not provide grounds for collateral attack.
Ordinary evidentiary rulings of the trial or incorrect, or in­
adequate framing of the charge to the jury are not grounds that
would support a collateral attack.

The question of the suf­

ficiency of the evidence is not a ground that would support a
collateral attack.

On collateral attack, the only claim open is

that there was no evidence, and the absence of evidence could be
refuted by many materials other than the provision of any part
of the transcript.
QUESTION:

Mr. E&sterbrook, how do you get around, the

possibility that the jail house lawyers in use "will now auto­
matically ask for a transcript for appeal purposes?
MR. EASTERBROQK:
QUESTION:

I guess there is no way to do that.

MR. ibkSTEli'DROOK:
would happen.

That may well —

It may well be that that is what

We certainly can’t exclude that possibility.

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. EASTERBROQK:

But if that occurs, it is & result

of th© system of incentives created by Congress, and we think
that Congress was entitled to, and indeed it may have been an
excellent idea, to create those incentives, because of th© de­
sirability of resolving promptly any claims of error, so that
innocent men can actually be released more promptly and so that
: are errors that require a new trial, the new trial can

IS
be had more promptly before memories are faded and evidence
dissipated.

It would probably be a good idea to have claims of

this sort resolved promptly on appeal, rather than, in this
case? six or seven years later on collateral attack.
QUESTION:
appeal.

Well, I didn’t say that he would actually

I said he would ask for the transcript and then he

wouldn’t go through with the appeal.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

In that event, h© must face the con­

sequent claim of deliberate by-pass, not only, as in this case,
a by-pass of his unquestioned right to a transcript on appeal,
but a deliberate by-pass of his appellate remedies sufficient to
cut off later claims on collateral review.

The jail house

lawyer, I am afraid, would have to take that possibility into
consideration.
QUESTION:

Wall, as suggested by the colloquy with ray

Brother Marshall, there is a time limitation on appeal, and
there is none .in a col]

:al attack, save only that the appli­

cant must still be in custody.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Yes, I agree.

I think that the major consequence of section 753 (f)
and the particularised need sM lack of frivolity requirements
is simply to require individual applicants to show that they
fall within the exception to the rule that normally a transcript
is unnecessary to prosecute a collateral attack.

And indeed, in

light of the burden of someone who seeks to overturn his

19

conviction and to prov© that h« was not justly convicted, to
show that h© is in fact entitled to any relief at all.

Only

by exercising and using a screening device of this sort can
Congress exercise the power which this Court has said that it
has to determine that there are some cases in which transcripts
are unnecessary and some in which lass than all of the tran­
script is necessary.
The screening device serves other purposes as well.
Thar© are more than 1,500 federal defendants in criminal cases
avery year who elect not to appeal.

There are large numbers of

defendants in state criminal cases who elect not. to appeal.

If

th© decision of the Court of Appeals is upheld, there will be at
least for a period'of time a rather crushing burden upon court
stenographers and reporters to produce large numbersof tran­
scripts, a burden that might well slov; down the process of pro­
duction of transcripts for those for whom there is a real
demonstrable need.
Moreover, th* requirements Congress has used create at
.least rough equality between destitute defendants and the
prisoner —
QUESTION:

Let me jusc interrupt for a second.

Do you

conceive that cur holding in this case will necessarily determine th© stata practices as well as th© federal practice?
MR. EASTERBROOE:

Insofar as it rests upon the Consti­

tution, Your Honor, it would necessarily determine the r-tate

20-21
practice as well.
QUESTION!

Do you think a holding against you would

necessarily rest on the Constitution, which is what I probably
should have asked?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

In light of the specific provision

of Congress in section 753 (f) that there should b© a showing of
need and lack of frivolity, I think a decision by this Court
would have to rest on the Constitution.
QUESTION;

W© would have to hold that that statute is

pro tonto constitutionally invalid?
MR. EASTERBROOK;

That is correct, to the extent that

it places those two requirements upon an applicant for collater­
al relief.
QUESTION!

Of course, the Court of Appeals said it

didn't have to reach a constitutional question.

On what —

what is the ground do you conceive of the Court of Appeals*
opinion?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

The Court of Appeals said in a foot"

note that it was addressing a deficit not filled by the statute.
a on what grounds it could require Congress to
expand monies and to provide a transcript to indigents when it
has elected by statute not to provide such a transcript unless
the Constitutio:- requires that.

It was the Constitution,, the

Court, of Appeals thought, that required it to fill the deficit..
QUESTION!

Ars you suggesting, -then, that even though

22

it says that they didn't have to reach the constitutional ques­
tion, in fact ~
MR. EASTERBRGOK:
QUESTION:

In fact, it reached it.

—it was saying it was constitutionally re­

quired?
MR. EASTERBRGOK:

That is correct.

I think that is

the only reasonable interpretation of what the court did.
QUESTION:
to hold that an

Would it not foe possible, Mr. Easterbrook,

adequate showing of need within the meaning of

the statute is mad® by an allegation that the petitioner was not
afforded effective assistance of counsel as required by the
Sixth Amendment?

Wouldn't that at least be a

way- of. deciding th® case without

•reaching the constitutional
MR. EASTERBRGOK:

I believe that would foe a theoretic-

ally permissible way to decide th© case, although in that event
ths.sro would be some tension between the outcome of this case and
;ho Court's resolution in Ccppedge v. United States, in which
: Court said that thu standard for assessing frivolity of r
action for leave to appeal in Forma Pauperis is an objective
standard, that is it depends upon demonstrable facts and not
upon the feelings or beliefs of the person who is asking'to
appear in Forma Pauperis.

23
If it were sufficient simply to make a claim that "I
balieve that I was not given the adequate assistance of counsel,"
that would bs an entirely subjective standard and would amount
to that extent, we think, to a change of the standard that was
established by Ccppedge.
QUESTION;

Of course, here the statutory condition is

not that the suit bs not frivolous and that the transcript is
needed to decide the issue presented by the suit or appeal, but
really by a trial judge’s or a, circuit judge’s certificate —
MR. EASTERBRGOK:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

— whatever the facts may be.

MR. EASTERBRGOK:

That's right, and if -—

Thera is no express provision in the statute or

in the Criminal Appeals Act.
QUESTION:

Do you think it could be revi.ewed?

MR. EASTERBRGOK:

I wouldn't like to foreclose our

opportunity to test that, but I would say that we have never
sought to review them, and that ordinarily if a trial judge or
un appellate judge makes such a certificate, that is quite suf­
ficient for the government.

Now, what happened in this case, the

MR. EASTERBROOK:

QUESTION:

Hr. Easterbrook, it is my understanding that

25
ther - are federal districts, at least there have been, in which,
as a matter of routine, the United States Attorney automatically
orders a transcript in all cases in order that they will expe­
dite the preparation of record and shorten the period required
for appeal, the disposition of the appeal.

Do you know the ex­

tent to which that practice is followed in the federal system?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

1 know that that practice is fol­

lowed in a number of districts, but 1 think a great number less
than the majority of districts.

We do not have an exact figure

on the number of districts in which that is true.

And it is

also true, as we discussed with the Court in Hardy v. United
States, that there are a number of districts in which when,
there is a request for a transcript, the transcript will be
prepared as levs expensive and less burdensome than litigating
•the question of access to the transcript.

But, of course, the-;

parameters of such preparation are sat in larga measure by the
statutory requirements and the constitutional demands, s© that
the United States Attorneys will know when it is that they
should order such a transcript to bs prepared.

I don’t know whether you can answer this,

but assuming a transcript was prepared, you would have no objec­
tion to giving it to them?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. STRAIT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE -RESPONDENT
MR. strait:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleaso the

Court:
My name is John Strait, the attorney representing the
respondent in this case, who was the petitioner in the District
Court and Court of Appeals below.

27
I will try to address some difsrancas of opinion which
the responderit has with the'petitioner heroin’s position regard­
ing the issues before this Court.
The issue presented by this case is considerably
narrower than that as stated by the petitioner here.

The issu©

is far closer to what you have implied, Mr. Justice Stevens, by
your question, and that is not simply on a gansral allegation
of demand for a transcript does an indigent federal petitioner
subject to pursuing his rights under section 2255 become en­
titled to a transcript, but, rather, where there is an allega­
tion of specific constitutional error — in this case, fchs
violation of the defendant in the original case, the petitioner a?
rights to Sixth Amendment effective, assistance of counsel and
'fifth Amendment due process rights for lack of -Sufficiency 'in
the evidence — wfestre that specific allegation is made .and mad©
in good faith, but cannot be supported by specific references to
the record because; the record does not exist with which to
support those allegations —
QUESTION:
•

bat’s narrow that a little bit.

Do you

any time a main says there is insufficient evidence

„

he gets

a tr&n s cr ip t?
MR. STRAIT:

Basically, that is the respondent’s po­

sition ":vri: in.

QUESTION:
that in thsru?

itll, have yon seen on® that didr.?t fcr.vs

28
MR. STRAIT:

Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall, I have seen

The difference between ray position here and the

Solicitor General’s is that I represent a lot of people in postconviction relief proceedings and one of the roles ©f the coun­
sel in trying —
QUESTION:

But you don't usually put insufficient

evidence?
MR. STRAIT:

No, not normally, not unless I am very

certain that there is some basi.s to support that.
QUESTION:

Well, do you think that is enough, just

insufficlent evidence?
MR. STRAIT:

I am saying -that at least that combined

with sixth Amendment-, which is the case before the Court, yes,
Your Honor.
QUESTION:

What was the exact language you pleaded or.

the Sixth Amendment?'
MR. STRAITs

You will find that in the appendix

page 11 through 13, the court’s appendix.

QUESTION:
MR. STRAIT:

Where is the exact language?
It is at. the bottom of page 11, "Petitions

in good faith believes the transcript will show that" — and
then at the top of page 12 —"a. Petitioner was not afforded
sffsotive assistance of counsel as required by the Sixth Amend­
ment to the Unitad States Constitution."

And below, that, "b,

There was insufficient evidence to support the" —

Th© answer is yes.

— if I understand your reluctance to

The problem with that

accept that position ~

is that tfc@S’i are constitutional claims, they are in fact con­
stitutional claims which require a transcript in order to b©
assarted and reviewed by the court, and indead for tho trial
counsel, that is the counsel that is representing the individual
at the trial court level on the post-conviction relief proceed­
ing, to have available to him to review solely $© h© can tell
aivabhesr they ar© meritorious to raise, and that is the
that has been recurrent in the pleadings here and the misquoting
i'jf the statement taken by respondent herein at the Court of
Appeals below.
QUESTION:

I u&dffirstocd Mr. EasterbrcokSs position to

be that insufficiency of tli© evidence was not a ground upca to
support collateral relief, -that the total absence of any evidence

30
would clearly fas, under Thompson v. Louisville.
MR. STRAIT:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
But insufficiency of the evidence is some­

thing available on appeal but not on collateral attach.

That

is Mr. Easterbrook's position, is it not?
MR. STRAIT:

I would have a caveat to that position —

that is his position, yes — I would have a caveat to that po­
sition to the degree that the difference between a total lack of
evidence in the record for the Fifth Amendment or Fourteenth
Amendment purposes versus the insufficiency of the evidence is
not an apparent difference in standard as in my escperienc
Appellate Courts.

with

The issues are treated exactly the same.

QUESTION:

Wall, one, at least as far as this Court's

jurisprudence goas, one is a constitutional-violation and the
other is not,
MR. STRAIT:

I agree with that, Mr. Justice Stewart,

but the position that I am asserting is that the constitutional
implications ere the standard that is actually employed in re­
viewing the record in order to determina whether there was insufficiency of evidence, and the standards that are employed in
order to de tormina the lack of evidence under the Fifth Amendmeat, in ray experience, have tean coextensive.

And so the

problsm is partially a s«mantle one in that the necessity of the
transcript to raise either issua is exactly the same, arid whs than
on© could raise ora only on appeal and the other properly in

31
either appeal, or post-conviction relief —
QUESTION:

Well, is it a statutory standard or does

th© statute provide for the standard for review on direct ap­
peal of the evidence, or is it a rule?
MR. STRAIT:

No, I believe it would b© case law.

®i©re is no statutory standard.
QUESTION:

But on collateral relief in th© federal

court with respect to a federal prisoner, can’t you make an
allegation that the evidence wasn’t sufficient to satisfy a
statute or a rule?
MR. STRAIT:

Yes, but, again, I think the standard

that the p@titi.oner would bear would be exactly th® same,
whether he phrased it in the constitutional or th® statutory
sensi;.

He would have to show that there was no evidence in the

record to support either the statutory element that, he was argu­
ing was not sufficiently reflected —
QUESTIONS

MR. STRAITs
practical purposes.

Yes, sir, that would b© correct, fcr all
The Solicitor General * s office is not con­

ceding that you are entitled to a transcript as a right in an
appeal without a showing of some need.

Presumably they are

trying to adhere to the position, the narrowest reading of
Hardy v. United States, which says at least where there is new
counsel on appeal, it is an absolute right of the trial testi­
mony transcription, but they are holding open the question of
whether where there is original appointed counsel or original
trial counsel on appeal —
QUESTION:

Well, in any event, as a practical matter,

this probii-x would arise only when there hasn't been an appeal?
HR. STRAITs

That is correct, and that is exactly tlr

reason why the government's position herein does not address fcha
problem which MacCoilcm faces, which is this is- his only remedy.
As 1 poinfeid out in ay answering brief, there can be no allega­
tion of intentional by-pass.

The record does not support that.

TV. vary prA:a raised by the Sixth Amendment effective
assistance of counsel, as implied by your question- is that the
individual who is subject to fth® ineffective assistance of
counsel will also have his appeal rights affected by that.

MR. STRAIT:

QUESTION;

YQ3.
If you changed counsel.
Yes.
Are you suggesting, Mr. Strait, that the

Court ©£ Appeals' statement of its holding is broader than was

34
necessary?
MR. STRAIT:
Reimquist.

Very substantially, Mr. Justice

Wtlat I am suggesting specifically is that the

actual language which the government bases virtually the entire­
ty of its position upon is net the holdingin the cases, exclu­
sively dicta, because in this particular case the indigent
petitioner, under section 225, did allege constitutional error,
h© did allege si good faith that it existed, he did show that
there was no adequate' alternative to a transcript with which to
present material to the court, and the functioning of section
2255 left him with no alternative but to follow this procedure.
QUESTION:

You say then that where the Court of

Appeals, in the las© sentence of its opinion, says "we hold*
MR. STRAIT:
QUESTION:

That's right.
— that is really dicta, which it may wd.

be?
MR. STRAIT;

That is exactly «hat I am assering, yea.

I am saying that if the court wishes t© breach, the broader
issue, that is the issue vjhich has been framed by the Solicitor8®
r eprs•2®rrb-3.tive her®, as to whether there is an absolute right
t~- a transcript for any indigent prisoner, federal prisoner
rx: ‘:ry to a 22™K proceeding, that issue is really
net fee-fore this Court and ought not to be reached.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Strait, you don't suggest, though

Court of Appeals decided tint th©re had been coisplirnes with

35
753 (£) ?
i-IR. STRAIT:

I think what th© Court of Appeals con­

fronted was tii© problf&i of other courts 3 interpretation? of the
demands of 753(f), with particular reference to specific claims
of Sixth Ammdmeta ineffective assistance of counsel —
QUESTIONS
MR. STRAIT:

May 1 ask ~
— and found that that was th© most can-

pliaise® that could fee —
QUESTION:

Well, can there b© compliance with 753 (f)

except as there is an application for and a certificate granted
©ither by a trial judge or a circuit, judge?
MR. STRAIT:

No, there would have to have been a cer

tificate and that issue —
QUESTION:

So at tha vary least, th© Court of Appeals

decision dees not rest upon a holding of compliance with 753 (f >?
MR. STRAIT:

No, I believe that is correct.

What the

Court of Appeals decision rests upon is its reading of the in™
terralationehip bs-tvesn section 1915, th© general in Forma
Pauperis provision, and 753(f) and the apparent inconsistency
in relation to habeas corpus 2255 and in Forma Pauperis gener­
ally, and said in view of the unclear statutory nature of it —
r.ioiy, th© Solicitor General is assarting that it is quite, clear

to him, based on his prior reading of the cases, but certainly
there is soma room for disagreement about that.

I believe Hr.

Jaetica Blackmon has addressed some of the ambiguities here in-

36
■m

article ia Federal Rules Decision, 43 Federal Rules Decision,

which addresses at least the nominal nature of the problem, and
what I am suggesting is that the Court ©£ Appeals' attempt to
fashion a remedy, given that situation, ought not to b© dis­
turbed since there is no particular reason, given the nature of
the holding her© to do so, that is the actual holding ©f the
case.
Now, the
QUESTION:

Do you think there is a. constitutional

holding?
MR. STRAIT.s

I think that there are constitutional

principles which led the Court of Appeals to adopt that particu­
lar statutory reading,

I do not believe that the actual

literal holding that th© Court of Appeals reached in their mind
is a constitutional holding.
QUESTION:

You don’t think they held that it was re­

quired by the Constitution?
MR. STRAIT:

I think that if they had fait that they

could not have interpreted the statutas that way, the way that
they did, they would have been forced to strike unconstitu­
tionally, which of course is th© position that we assert her®
insofar as it applies to MacCollom's particular case.
QUESTION:

The dissenting judge in th© Court of

Appeals certainly viewed the court’s decision as a constitutive-"
al decision, didn’t he, Judge Taylor?

3?
MR. STRAIT;

Yes, Judge Taylor did.

And I would? in

that regard? to b© candid.. I would say that I do not believe
that unless th© Constitution places som© pressure upon reading
the statutes that way? that that would be? in fact? the way
that you would interpret th© statutes.
QUESTION;
MR. STRAIT;
QUESTION;

Th© inevitable reading, wouldn’t it?
Yes.
Hqw did th© five or six, whatever th©

number ware of judges who voted for rehearing ©n banc view that
question?
MR. STRAIT;

They exclusively viewed it as a constitu­

tional question, simply saying that there is no reason to depart
from ths> statutory interpretations adopted; by other circuits,
and in iha initial hearing of Wad® v. Wilson; which was ulti**
mateiy reversed and remanded on other grounds by this Court,
in th® Ninth Circuit., no reason to adopt a different interpre­
tation unless there was a constitutional reason to do so, and
they war a of the opinion that, this Court's decision —~
QUESTION;
MR. STRAIT;

Why didn't Wade bind this panel?
The position of the panel was that Wad©

did siot reach th© issue specifically, and that Wad© ted bean
cast in further doubt to the degree that its dictum did by the
subsequent court decisions of Ross and North Carolina v. Britt.
QUESTION;

And apparently th© majority of tha active

judges didn't relieve that Wad© bound them sitter, or they

38
would iiav® had to grant rehearing?
MR. STRAIT2

That’s correct.

And I might add that, ae

the litigant there, I was somewhat surprised that they did not.
I expected them to do so.
The position that- we assert has not, I think, been
accurately presented to the Court, not too surprisingly, by tM
Solicitor General in regards to Article I, section 9, clause 2.
Since this is the only forum that the p@titi.onar below, the
respondent herein, has in which to asssrt his Sixth Amendment
and Fifth Arasnament deprivations of which he complains, the
question of his right to transcript becomes on® of access, not.
simply a nice, tool to help him once he gets in, because of th©
way section 2255 operates.

And I would refer you to the exten­

sive discussion of 2255 and its procedures in the Hayman case,
which tills court decided, and also in the Sokol article, which
is cited in my brief.

You might also refer to the University

of Kansas law Review article, in 'volume 20, a student note which
t&.lks about, iha dilemma which is presented to the petitioner
who asserte claims such as MacCollcm's.
Specifically, what happens is, in order to assert his
constitutional claims of Fifth and Sixth Amendment deprivations
of right to counsel and sufficiency of the evidence, the probI.r .i then btex-aes one of him having to identify as a prerequisite
to even having his 2255 application acoepted and then getting
his trancript, he has to identify to the record in a procedure

39
■;/ary similar to that struck down by this Court in Gardner v.
California, he has to identify the basis for his claimed alle­
gations of error.
QUESTIONS

Well, Mr. Strait, your previous argument

suggested that ineffective assistance of counsel claims were
virtually impossible to raise on appeal, or at least were very
difficult.

But certainly insufficiency of evidence claims are

act difficult to raise on appeal, are they?
■ MR. STRAIT:
QUESTION:

Mo, that is correct.
In fact, that is the traditional forum fcc

raise them in?
MR. STRAIT:

I agree.

The problem is that there is

no constitutional guarantee to the opportunity to do so, and
the by-pass argument essentially, which the Solicitor General
upon to emphasize' this policy choice of Congress to
emphasis® appeal ov«

>st-c©nvict±on relief, stands th© con-

ctituvJ.ors: relationships between post-conviction relief and
appeal on their head.
QUESTION:

But why do you need a constitutional right

to do so when you have got a statutory right?
MR. STRAIT:

You don’t, but MacCollora would because;

in MacColIon's situation. he had both th© problem of the Sixth
Amendment and ineffective assistance of counsel — Fifth
itoimdment, pardon ms, insufficiency.

Ha was not able to rais-a

by appeal because Iis did not do so, and if —

40
QUESTION t
ha didn’t do so.

Now, you. say he was not able to because

Ar© you saying that had h© chosen to appeal,

there would have been some impediment to his raising them?
MR. STRAIT:

No.

What I am saying is that the vary

process of the .choice to appeal was affected by the very inef­
fectiveness of assistance of counsel which he asserts.

Secondly,

if the government is to say that there has been essentially an
intentional by-pass of the right t© a transcript, not the right
to post-conviction relief, which they could not argue because
of Article I, section 9, clausa 2, than the problem is that no­
where was MacCollom advised — and I am certain of this, feat
th® record will reflect it — nowhere is MacCollom advised that
if he did not «Karcisa his right of appeal, now he would not get
a transcript.

St would stand the concept of waiver on its head.

Of course, h© was neysr advised as to that.

That was not, in

fact -QUESTION:
that.

You say of course he was never advised of

He doesn’t allege that., does he?

MR. STRAIT:

No, he cannot at this time until he gets

tho transcript.
QUESTION:

Well, had h© gone ahead and appealed, is

•re-Id hsve bad a traceript and pnrh&ps could have mads that
cJ Ivgrhi-}-;..

But th® problem is — I understand your
position — th® problem is that he would have to know that he

41
should appeal in order to get a transcript before he can know­
ingly make any decision to by-pass that right, if you follow me.
QUESTION:

Yes, but your man doesn't allege in his

petition that h® was not advised of his right to appeal?
MR. STRAIT:

No, he doss not allege that he was not

advised of his right to appeal by the. court.

The allegations

that he would make specifically, when this matter is returned
to the District Court for further proceedings, would b® that
his attorney did not advise him of what would happen if he did
not appeal.
QUESTION:

Well, wa don't know what he would allege

QUESTION:

Why would ha allege that?

if ~

MR. -STRAIT:

Well, the problem- is that most of the

material that is involva'4 in that issue was also connected tc
the Sixth Amendment question, because there was a colloquy, m
...QJ.'WVg.: — and I, as thz attorney, entered the case afterward,
have no way of knowing whether this is accurate or not until I
so© the transcript — he alleges that there was a colloquy between him and the attorney —
QUESTION:
MR. STRAIT:

Wall, that is not before us, is it?
No, it is not, but•the point I am raising

is that tfes only way it will ever get before anyon® is if he
gets the transcript.
QUESTION:

Well, why can't hs petition for a

42
transcript?
MR. STRAITs
QUESTION:

I’m sorry?
Why can't hs put it in his application or

petition he filed?
MR. STRAIT:

He probably would hav® been willing to

do so# but the attorney who was representing him at that him
felt that there was some question as to whether that would in
fact turn out to be the case and wanted fc© see the transcript
first before he took up the court’s time with an allegation
that he thought very likely could be in fact frivolous# which
raises a number of issues that I wish to discuss briefly with
the Court# and these have to do with the policy questions be­
fore fch© Court that ara presented by the broader issue which, if
the Court reaches, 1' think it should consider — I would submit
it should consider.
The government’s position is virtually exclusively
t'rrt th-vos is a burden on court reporter services and that,
there is a financial interest in reducing the availability of
transcripte in situations such as MacCollom's.

This Court hss

never found that monetary considerations alone justify fch©
deprivation of a right to a transcript or availability to a
transcript in an original proceeding.
Secondly# as I believe Mr. Justice Marshall pointed
out by his question, there ar© likely to be an increased number
of requests for transcript, so fch&fc. there will be proportionately

43
I©3S. monetary saving, if any.
Thirdly f as th@ a canssi for the —
QUESTION:

Well, you suggest that the whole thing is

kind of a balancing procsss, but certainly in eases such as
Ross v. Moffitfe, where w© held there was no right, to counsel on
a discretionary appeal, that isn't in terms ©f balancing the
financial ham to the state against the benefit to the indigent,
it. is just, a question of saying the indigent's rights go so far
and no further.
MR. STRAIT:

I agree, but I think Ross supports the

position that MacCollom takas hers, which is that sine© the
discretionary appeal is being exercised, as the Court points
out, with a series of. factors, 'including the availability of &
transcript, tfc® prior assistance of counsel, presumably the
availability of counsel prior to the time he withdraws from tfc*i
discretionary appeal application, ©t cetera
QUESTION:

Well, you may be right, but the analysis is

in terms of access, not in terms of whet, burden's the thing v?ui~5
place on the government.
MR. STRMTs

I agree, .and that is why I have been

emphasising that it. is. a question of access here, not simply a
question of expsac®.

But there are policy, considerations which

i:ka Soiicitcr Genor:-: 1 raised regarding expense and availability
of resources for doing things lik© this, and I felt it was
appropriate, to address these.

44
Our position really is that the very policy of poseconviction relief arid the efficient functioning of the lower
courts requires that MaeCollom's position be in fact adopted.
And my premise is that the screening function performed both by
counsel where counsel exist — in the day of Legal Services and
Prison Legal Services projects, that is not as uncommon for
indigents as it used to be, without the capacity to retain
counsel — and, secondly, the function of the court itself, in
reviewing 2255 applications, will b© greatly enhanced and
minimis® ultimately the judicial time expended, for exactly the
same reason that these district courts and federal attorneys
have adopted the policy in some areas of the country of not
resisting.transcript applications, because of the litigation
co-st and tirs involved in litigating whether the parson is en­
titled to thorn or not.
-i:s3.

she court will be spared that amount of

Ttnsr- :±.a r-acord by the. pro so: applicant cams in to bin,

x/ith or without the assistance of couns®l at some point, the
record will reflect clearly the existence or non-existence of
aha claimed errors, which will allow the reviewing judge con­
siderably greater freedom to screen the cases and get rid of
them if they ara in fact frivolous.
Lastly, the dilemma, that I was addressing to you, Mr.
Justice Rehnquist, cf the trial lawyer's ability to try to find
cut if there is any merit to what his client says is greatly
rbamceo when® ths lawyer in inch exists, and that, in ny

45
experience, is on® way of minimising son© impact on the coarts
with frivolous claims.
QUESTION:

Wall, isn't thsra another way to minimias

tha impact on th© courts in all cases except where th© claim is
ineffective assistance of conns®!, and that is for district
courts to require th® trial lawyer to prepare th® appeal?
MR. STRAIT:
QUESTION:

That may work.

How many trial lawyers who try a ease for

MR. STRAIT:

AFTERNOON SESSION - 1:01 O’CLOCK
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Strait, you my con­

tinue*
MR. STRAIT:

Mr. Chief Justice, I am not sure, I be­

lieve my time is expired, so I will conclude with these remarks.
The problem that Is presented for the particular in­
digent» the 2255 petitioner in MacCollom's situation, is that
where h® is raising Sixth Amendment and Fifth Amendment issues
as he has, the transcript itself becomes the access issue under
the scheme of 2255.

Without the transcript, he cannot frame

his issues properly to be reviewed by the District Court for

the initial screening:, and once the District Court has screened
.riew the issues properly as to frivolity without

the transcript to tell whether those issues are properly set
forth in the record.
Give's that situation, the statutory scheme would pre­
sent. Article I» section 9, clause 2 suspension of tha writ
problems, as I have stated in my brief,

if the Court were fe

those who have a claim that includes, whatever

ei-t it has, it iauladas fcra claim of ineffective assistuana f£
counsel —

48
MR. STRAITs

And in addition those that, have shown

by their affidavit no adequate alternative to a transcript frees
which to get that information, and also those who have had
counsel appointed, which was the case for MacCollom, by the
initial trial court#

all three of those distinguishing factors.

Excuse me, I take it I do have more time?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs
MR. STRAIT:

Yes, you do have.

The primary problem that is presented by

the government's approach to habeas corpus is that it presumes
that ther© is some necessary incentive available through the
ippeJlate scheme which undercuts habeas corpus.

That obviously

could not be a proper congressional purpose. While there may ba
in fact, valves to bs emphasized by encouraging early appeal of
criminal cases, the simple fact remains that

central to this

government's founding was the concept of habeas corpus, which
means that there never will be a concept of finality in criminal
low, the snta as there would be in a civil case.

For that vary

reason., most of the gover^jnert 's arguments concerning tu@
advantages which Congress has created by discouraging habeas
corpus simply don't address the constitutional question which
is raised by MaeCollorn's situation.

QUESTION:

Well, are you suggesting that Congress

would have had to enact the habeas corpus act of 1817?

For

eighty or ninety years, there was no collateral review even of
f ©der a1 convictions

43
MR. STRAITS
Justice Rehnquist.

Wall? that is a very tough question Mr.

My position is that today there would have

to ba some implementation or an interpretation by the courts
that the habeas corpus act was self-implementing, and that we
have never had to confront the question of whether the judiciary
act alone» if it ware none, would not present some jurisdictional
basis for habeas corpus.
QUESTION:

Suppose Congress, next session, repealed

the 2255f the habeas corpus act, so that there was no stated
post-conviction remedy, what than?
MR. STRAIT:

My position is that Ar'ti'fle I, section

9, clause 2 would become self-effectuating and the courts would
have to entertain such a motion, such proceedings.

Presumably.:

this Court, which 1 would think -~

QUESTIONS

The 1867 extended federal habeas relief to

state prisoners?
MR. STRAIT;

That's right, and this Court has not been

confronted with the position prior to th© Fourteenth Amendment's
enactment of whether th® heabeas corpus right would have to be
implemented directly by .the states, and prior to the time that
could have been confirmed under the Fourteenth Amendment as a
right made applicable.*

The problem had bean resolved by th®

fedora! legislation t’o which you referred.
The position that the government takes with regards
to the equal protection issue raised by respondent below, I
believe misstates th© position which both the Ninth Circuit
adopted in its opinion and that asserted hero by respondent.
Specifically, the equal protection position taken is not that
the wealthy person's standards are to be met by the state or the

federal gcwen&v'snt ir. aiding indigent prisoners.

Quits the

■ txary, th® issue is on© of adequate access, and the language
which th© lew&r court railed upon and which I submit is appr*

priafca rx-d sxxt":

rtquireseats in this exsx i:s >!s

51
language of this Court in Ross v.

specifically that

fchs duty of th© system is to assure the individual, the indi­
gent defendant, an adequate opportunity to present his claims
fairly, and at least where Sixth Amendment claims and Fifth
Amendment claims, as assarted by MacCollom, are raised, that
requires a transcript in'the post-conviction relief context ©f
habeas corpus.
I do not believe that the government can assert to the
contrary that the language relied upon below is any different.
That is the standard.

It is the standard used by this Court

in equal protection eases in right to transcript and right to
counsel, and that .is, I believe, the only .standard adopted by
th© lower court decision.
QUESTIONS
sit down.

Mr. Strait, I want to'catch you before you%

Is your client on parole?
MR. STRAIT;-

It is an awkward question to answer, Mr..-

Jus tic® Blackotm. ; My; client’s position right now is t ha the

' /

was revoked rscsntly 'and is presently incarcerated in the King'
County Jail for Seattle, Washington, pending. & federal detainer
hearing, federal review hearing of his parol® status, at which
I hav© beer, advised he will be returned to custody, federal
custody, presuiR: bly at McNeil Islandand whether h© will be
transferred again to Leavenworth, Kansas, 1 do not know.
QUESTION:
MR. STRAITs

S© he remains indigent?
He remains not only indigent but in

:

52
custody and indigent.

Ha is, if you will pardon the expression,
I

disgustingly indigent.
QUESTION?
MR. STRAIT:
QUESTION:

Was he working in, the meantime?
Bog pardon?
Was he working in th® meantime when ha was

on parole?
MR. STRAIT:

Th© reason — I meant to call Your

Honors’ attention to the affidavit in Forma Pauperis, which is
part of this Court's records, that he submitted a new affidavit
as of th© filing of th® proceeding, th© petition for review by
this —
QUESTION:
MR. STRAIT:

That’s a year ago?
— yes, and at that time he had been em­

ployed , I belistv©, for a total income, gross income of $1,000
in the previous nine months, all of which was expended at that
time, and lie has not bean employ ad sine®, which I assume is
•mo of tbs. reasons ha got in trouble with his parole status.
QUESTION:

Evan if awkward in certain respects, ex­

cept as it relatas to the possible aspect of mootness, it has
nothing to da .with the issues of the case?
MR. STRAIT:

I agree.

For the purposes of custody,

I

for 2255 proceedings, tlia fact that he was either actively on
parole or in custody would b© sufficient.

QUESTION:

Tli® indigent inquiry is directed toward

mootness, and that has a groat deal to do with th© case.

53
MR. STRAIT:
QUESTIONt

Yes.
That is why I said, except for mootness,

it would have nothing to do with the merits.
MR. STRAIT?

To clarify that matter, I can assert

with certainty that the individual is still indigent at this
time and has not at any tiiaa during th© pendency ©f this proc@@&ing been other than indigent within tha prior definitions
of indigency by case law.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You hav® about two minutes

left, Mr. E&astsr brook, do you have anything further?
ME. lASTEftBROOs::

I have nothing further, unless tls®

Court has questions.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
gentlemen.

Hearing non®, thank you,

The case is submitted.

case was submitted.]
