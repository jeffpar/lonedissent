P R O C S E D I K G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We’ll heir arguments

first this morning in 74-1560, United States against MartinezFuerte and 75-5387, a consolidated case.
Mr. Bennett, you may speak whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BALLARD BENNETT, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF SIFUENTES
MR. BENNETT:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The case of Rudolfo Sifuentes, in which I am a
court-appointed counsel, involves a question of whether the
border patrol can stop a vehicle at a permanent checkpoint
many miles from the border for the purposes of interrogating
its occupants and visually searching the interior of the
vehicle without cause or suspicion of any kind and also without
a warrant of any nature.
Jew, the Martinez-Fuerte case involves the same
question except in that case the

checkpoint was operating under

some nature of a warrant, a warrant of some kind and however,
the Government maintained that they have a right to operate
these

checkpoints s

to make these

stops and inflict these

intrusions upon the people passing without a warrant and the
fact that they did have a warrant or did not have a warrant was
not controlling.

That is their initial argument, anyway.

QUESTION:

Mr. Bennett, I suppose you would agree

4
that precisely at the border all of the things that were done
here could be done.
MR. BENNETT:

Yes, sir, there is no argument about

that, as far as I know, your Honor.
QUESTION;

This could —

The only issue is the distance.

Is that

it?
MR. BENNETT:

Yes, sir.

My checkpoint

was

approximately 70 miles from the border and as I recall
the checkpoint

and

that I have in my case is near Sarita, Texas

and you. probably don’t know where Sarita, Texas is but it is in
the ranch country south of Houston between Houston and Browns­
ville.
The San Clemente checkpoint is about 65 miles from
the border.
In between both the checkpoint and the border in
both of those areas there are large metropolitan establishments.
Of course, they have got San Diego in California and in the
Lower Rio Grande Valley, which is what they call this area, we
v. string of te rns — 1 believ;

ve have got about: 320,000

people that live in this area between the border itself and the
checkpoints.
QUESTION;

How large is Brownsville itself?

MR. BENNETT;

Your Honor, I would guess Brownsville

to be about 80,000 people.
QUESTION;

And that is south of the checkpoint here

5
in your case?
MR. BENNETT:
certainly is.

Yes, your Honor.

Yes , your Honor.

It

The Highway 77, on which the checkpoint is located

originates in Brownsville.

It goes from Brownsville through

San Benito through Harlingen through Raymondsville.
Now, the rest of the other valley cities are

off

back to the west and roads constantly feed in to this Highway 77
Now, when it gets to Raymondsville, a few miles out­
side, then it hits the ranch country and that is the -- the
valley is not really a valley.

It is an alluvial belt and they

have very —• a great deal of agriculture.

It is highly intense

cultivation of row crops.
But when you get into this country where they have,
the checkpoint located, it is in the ranch country.

The King

Ranch is on both sides but it is not right there where the
checkpoint is but the King Ranch is broken up into various
divisions and there is one — several divisions to the north
and there is at least one or two to the south and it is in a
remote area.
Now, the valley is like a three-necked bottle — and
I am speaking, of course, of the Rio Grande Valley.

There are

only three ways to get out of -.there by automobile going north*
QUESTION;

When you speak of the valley, Mr, Bennett,

how far up the Rio Grande does this go?
St

:-3fINITT:

Well, the. area that I. am talking sbout

6
this area where they have a lot of farming and a lot of people,
the 320,000 or so, consists generally of four counties; three
counties starting down at the mouth of the river and then going
up northwest.

The river runs in a northwest direction.

There would be three counties running along there
and then one county sits on top of — Cameron County which is
on the coast —
QUESTION:

To the north of —

MR. BENNETTj
through Cameron County.

North of there.

Now, Highway 71 runs

It runs through Willacy County, which

is the next county up and then it goes

on up into Kennedy

County and this checkpoint is about eight-tenths of the way up
into Kennedy County.
Kennedy County is a huge county.

It has get about

1,500 square miles so there is really no connection between
this checkpoint and the border.

The traffic coming by there

comes out of the valley and there is no assurance whatsoever
that any of these cars have recently come across the border.
We maintain that there is no substantial distinctior
V;

between a stop by roving

patrol and a stop at a checkpoint.

We feel that the reasoning of the Brignoni-Ponce case should
be controlling and should be extended to the checkpoint stops.
It is our contention that these intrusions can be
characterised in, it's sort of a three-pronged attack.
First, there is the stop itself.

How, at Sarita,

7
every car coming down that road except, vehicles containing the
local inhabitants,, are stopped,
Now,, whether you call that taking them into custody
short of traditional arrest or whether you call it a seizure or
however you characterise it, the fact remains that once you
come within the sight of that checkpoint, then you ara in the
custody of the Border Patrol agent on duty,
QUESTION:

You are stopped and then what happens?

Each car is stopped except those whose occupants are recognized
as local residents,
MR. BENNETT:
QUESTION:

That is right.

There is a stop and then what happens?

MR, BENNETT:

All right, the first thing that happens

is the agent approaches close enough to the car to be able to
see down in that car.

He does that deliberately for that pur­

pose and the third thing is an interrogation.
QUESTION:

Of whom?

Of the driver and all the

occupants?
MR. B'SNNET:

Of the occupants and the driver.

QUESTION:

Could he be arrested?

HR, BENNETT:

Why?

MR. BENNETT:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor, I believe he could»

Well, he would be —

What would the charge be?

MR. BENNETT:

They would just take and bring you

back and question you about your — why did you run through
there?

Why didn't you stop?
QUESTION:

I didn't say he ran through.

I said he

stopped.
MR. BENNETT:
QUESTION:

Yes , sir.

And the officer asked him, "Are you an

American citizen?" and he said, "It is none of your business.1'
What happens?
MR. BENNETT:
QUESTIONj

You think?

MR. BENNETT:

is in common sense.

Well, I think the —

No, sir!

Do you know?
I must rely on what I know

The officer would tell him that it was his

business and he would keep him there and interrogate him.
Now, whether he would eventually charge him with an
offense 7. don’t know, but I do know that he wouldn't continue

on down the road, which is probably what he wanted to do when
he started out on his trip.
People coming out of the valley,

if they get far

enough north to pass this checkpoint, are going a substantial

10
distance and it can be anticipated that they would like to get
on their way and when you are stopped, you have the -—• you are
facing the possibility of being detained for some time if they
want to take you over to secondary and question you.»
That is what happened in the Siffuentes case.
QUESTION:

Does the record show how many cars or

what percentage of the cars that are stopped are taken over to
secondary?

It doesn’t show in here, does it.?
MR. BENNETT:

No, sir, not in my case, it doesn't.

Now, the San Clemente ~

MR. BENNETT:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir, that is correct.

And what were the facts in your case?

I

am sure you are going to get to them.
MR. BENNETT;

Well, the facts in my case were that

the Defendant came up to this checkpoint in the early morning
hours.

They stopped him on a routine basis,

MR. BENNETT:

It says 3:00 a.m. in the record.

MR. BENNETT;

Yes, sir.

He has lived there all his life.
Next, he asked these aliens and he didn’t get satis­

to ",/hat they called secondary.

The aliens were taken in the

van which I believe is shown in the photograph that the
Government nas attached to their brief and the driver was

12
separated and taken off and interrogated at another place
separate from the agents!
QUESTION;

In your statements a few minutes ago,

Mr. Bennett, you said something to the effect that there- was
nothing to indicate that this car had bean recently in Mexico
or had come to Mexico.

New, suppose there was something to

indicate that it had probably just been in Mexico.
What effect would you say that would haves?
MR. BENNETT:

Well, sir, that's — when you say

"Probably just been,” you mean that it has come directly from
the Border?
QUESTION %

Well, suppose on the windshield or some-

wnere on the car was a sticker about some rodeo that had just
completed the day before, as an example.
MR. BENNETT:

Well, the — any sticker or anything

like that could not be observed, your Honor, until after the
stop had been. made.
QUESTION:

If there was some indication, then —
Well, maybe the sticker was a bright

MR. BENNETT:

QUESTION:

Now, let He pursue that, though.

Suppose,

on every car that cam® by the precise border, a. great, large
orange piece of paper as big as your hand would be pasted on the
windshield and the law would require -- regulations would
require you to keep that on your car for 48 hours after you had
come across the border from Mexico, every car that passed the.
border.
MR. BENNETT:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Anything unconstitutional about that?

MR. BENNETTs

No, sir, I don’t see anything uncon­

stitutional in it offhand.
QUESTION:

Could they then route these cars with the

orange sticker on theirs for inspection 65 miles north of the
border?
MR. BENNETT:

Well, yes, sir, I think they could.

The theory that you might be going on is that that yis the
'continuation of a border search.
Now, of course, they have border searches up in
1i, Louis because that is better than having to stop and go
through everything.

But the vice of this checkpoint is, and

what we are complaining of is' that they are stopping all these
people who don’t have any relation to the problem that they are
son itching.

They are the ones that get the —

14
QUESTION:

Let's get back to my bright orange sticker,

the color of this pen,

With that bright orange sticker, then,

you say — as far as you are concerned, there would be no
constitutional barrier to stopping every car that carried that
sticker.
MR. BENNETT:

Well, now, you said for a period of

time.
QUESTION:

Forty-eight hours.

MR. BENNETT:

How would you — would they stop and

look cn the — would they date the sticker and put the time and
they stop and look at that?
QUESTIONs

Yes, if after 48 hours the driver hadn't

taken the trouble to take it off which, on say hypothetical
regulation, ha would be permitted to do.
MR. BENNETT;

I would say that — I really, offhand

don't see any strong objection on constitutional grounds.

It

would be infinitely preferable to stopping everybody that
happens to come by this point on the chance that they might have
come from the border which — when the indications are, the
c

ace is that they probably didn't come from the border and I

t i.rk that, reasoning on a consent basis, if you want to cross
1 ■

border, you have to consent to this reasonable regulation.
i constitutional justification might 1

QUESTION:

Mr. Bennett.

15
MR-. BENNETT.*
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,

In Texas, does the state highway patrol

system periodically undertake to check driver’s licenses?
MR. BENNETT:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, it does.

They have got to stop people for that

purpose,
MR. BENNETT:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir, it does.

Is that unconstitutional?

MR. BENNETT:

I do not necessarily think that it does

I have been through three of those in the last few years.

One

of them was obviously what it purported to be, a driver’s
license check.

They had state — what you would call state

troopers or Department of Public Safety man standing on each
side and they had, apparently, a checklist and they looked and
they asked you for your driver’s license.

They wanted to see

They watched your lights.

The two others were obviously subterfuges that they
were using just to stop you so they could look at you for some
reason.

In fact, in one of them, I was fumbling around in my

peckefcbaok trying to find my driver’s license •— which I can
never find when I need it — and the man said, "Aw, well, forget
it' and turned around and walked off and went back to the next
car.
Now, I would say that that is obviously unconstitu­
tional but there is one basic ■—

16

QUESTION:

What is unconstitutional?

MR. BENNETT:
QUESTION:

To stop you as a subterfuge —

When the objective is legitimate.

Is

that the point you are making?
HR. BENNETT:

Yes, I think that if they are legiti­

mately checking your driver's license and making an administra­
tive check of your car, 1 see —
QUESTION:

Is it your view that the objective in

this case is illegitimate?
MR. BENNETT:

No, but it is the — the idea is to

QUESTION: Is it/lawful to drive in Texas withouthaving a valid driver's license?
MR. BENNETT:

Yes, sir, it is and they wilr give you

a ticket, presumably, if you don't have it. and sometimes you
will have it and don't have it on you and they will give you a
ticket and you will have to go show up and they will dismiss
the charge.
QUESTION:

Well, what is the Constitutional distinc­

tion?
MR. BENNETT-

The Constitutional distinction, as I

see it, your Honor, is that these checkpoints have been here for
n

h on to 20 or 30 years.

The people that live down in the

v

-ey have been going through there every time that they want

to leave this country and these driver's license things are done

17
on a routine basis and they are not — they are not near as
likely to be oppressive.
These checkpoints, as I said in the brief, they are
Orwellian devices.

You are down there and you have got to go

through there and let them look at you.
QUESTION:

Hr. Bennett, in your case where you

rummaged for your driver's license and they were not really
looking for

driver5s licenses, you say it is obviously

unconstitutional.

Suppose they had been informed that a bank

robber was to be found in that area and they are just checking
cars for the suspects.

Would that be permissible or imper­

missible?
MR. BENNETT:

Yes, sir, I think, as I pointed out in

my brief, I think that you can put up road blocks in the case
of an emergency in an exigent situation.
I think society has that power to protect itself.
But that is not what we are talking about, here.
QUESTION:

Well, would it be an emergency if the

k

crime had been committed months before but they jusb had reason
to believe that, perhaps the suspect was in the area?
MR. BEbbETT:
QUESTION •;

No, sir, I don't think so.

They could not do it then?

lit, BENNETT:

I' would say that they could not put up

a block just on the belief that they might sieve up some person
in this net.

QUESTION:

But they could do it on the belief they

might find people without driver's licenses?
MR. BENNETT:

Well, they can check in the driver's

The only way they have of seeing if you are

driving without a driver's license is to ask you when you are
driving if you have got a driver's license.

But that is not the

only way they can apprehend the smugglers of illegal aliens,
your Honor.
QUESTION:
Mr. Bennett,

It is no part of your case here,

is it, that these stops were pretextual — similar

to your experience the second time you were stopped.
MR. BENNETT:

No, sir, it is certainly not part of

my case because my man had aliens that were prosecuted and
sentenced.
QUESTION:

Well, in your case, in any event,

they —

what was found was what they were purportedly looking for.
Mk. BENNETT:
i

Yes, but they could — one of my points

that they could be used for other purposes.
QUESTION;

But. it is not your point that they are now

being used for other purposes.
MR. BENNETT;
QUESTION;

In this instance, no, sir.

Mr. Bennett, you have mentioned or

emphasized, as I understand your argument, that the intrusion of
the stop — suppose instead of stopping your client
been, brought

he had

,:;o a speed of, say, five 'miles an hour and

19
the officer had detected the presence of these individuals
lying on the floor of the back area.

Would that be a consti­

tutional violation?
MR. BENNETT:

Well, that gets into a grey area.

I

would say I don!t think stopping a man and taking him into
custody is a grey area but. I feel that, that is and there again,
it is just what the Court wants to let the federal officials,
how far they want to let them intrude into our lives.
QUESTION:

What —

Do you think wa might draw a distinction

between a stop and, say, a slow-down to —
MR. BENNETT;
QUESTION;

I think you

might, your Honor.

But the slow-down, if I understand my

brother Powell s question, in your case would have eventuated
ultimately in a

stop and in an arrest.

MR. BENNETT:
QUESTION:

The slow-down, and just go through —

MR. BENNETT:

QUESTION;

That is right.

Yes, sir .

— would have -- no point in

going to slow down anyway?

where they were doing this up in Oklahoma where they have an

expressway where they have

to stop and pay a toll on it and the

I have gone over my time.

I thank the Court.

QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Bennett.

Mr. Evans.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. EVANS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
MR. EVANS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
These consolidated cases involve four separate
prosecutions. In addition to the one involving Mr. Sifuentes and
involving a stop at the Sarita checkpoint in Texas, there were
three separate cases growing out of three stops at the San
Clemente checkpoint, which is the same checkpoint that was
involved in last year's Qrtia decision.
Like the Sarita checkpoint, the San Clemente check­
point is* 60 or more miles from the — air miles from the border.
The San Clemente checkpoint, as you will probably recall, is on
Interstate 5 between San Diego and Los Angeles.
Each of them is operated essentially around the
clock except wi\ere weather or manpower prohibits or, in the case
of San Clemente, if the traffic gets too heavy to be controlled
effectively and in each of the cases hare, each of the court
cases, illegal aliens were discovered riding in the passenger
j

compartment of the vehicles that were stopped.
In one of the cases involved in the San Clemente
checkpoint the officers, after discovering the illegal aliens
in the passenger compartment, searched the trunk of the

21
automobile and found additional aliens.
The broad :.3sue in all four of the

cases is whether

Border Patrol officers may lawfully stop northbound vehicles at
a fixed checkpoint in the border area for the limited purpose cf
inquiring about the citizenship and immigration status of the
visible occupants in the absence of an articulated reasonable
suspicion that the car is carrying

aliens who may be illegally

in the country.
The Texas case and California cases differ in two
respects.

First, with respect to operating procedure.
The Sarita checkpoint, as Mr. Bennett mentioned, is

customarily operated by stopping for this limited inquiry almost
everyone who passes with the exception of local residents or
other persons whom the officer recognizes and those persons are
simply waved through.
At San Clemente, by contrast, a very small proportion
of the passing vehicles are actually stopped for inquiry.

The

figures fit the time of the hearing in the Baca case, which you
remember was a consolidated proceeding in the Southern District
of California concerning all the checkpoints there, estimated
that roughly three percent of the vehicles then were being
stopped.
The current figures, including figures under the
■warrant that 19 11 mention in a moment, during the period
involved here i

Jt‘a Ciemante indicate that the percent was

22
even smaller*, perhaps one-half of one percent.
At San Clemente, unlike the other checkpoints in the
Border Patrol's network, the ’point officer ~~ that is, the
officer who stands observing traffic as it approaches -- does
not ordinarily question the occupants of the vehicle. Because of
the heavy traffic, when a vehicle is to be stopped for inquiry
it is referred off the highway to a secondary area where other
officers make the inquiries.
Sarita, like most of the checkpoints aside from San
Clemente, is operated differently.

The officer on the point

generally makes the stops and asks any questions that he wants
to ask right then and there and the only time a person is
referred over to the side of the highway is

if suspicious

circumstances «'arrant further inquiry.
fhe other difference, aside from operating procedure
is that the stops at San Clemente were authorised by a warrant
issued by a federal magistrate upon a showing of area-type
probable cause.

There is no warrant for the stops at the Sarita

checkpoint.
In our view, these differences between the two check­
points should not produce different results but they do account
Sor somewhat different arguments addressed to the two check­
points .
The analytical framework for these cases, we thirk,
.'.s drawn from this Court• s decision last term in. Brignoni-Fence,

23
which also involved Border Patrol stops for inquiry but which
involved stops on roving patrol.
1 think it is fair to say that all the parties agree
that a checkpoint stop and inquiry procedure isf although a
seizure under the Fourth Amendment, something like a street
encounter involving a brief detention short of traditional
arrest and that it is therefore to be tested under the general
reasonableness requirement of the Fourth Amendment.
X think it is also fair to say that the parties
agree that reasonableness -- the test of reasonableness depends
upon a balance between the law enforcement need to conduct a
particular activity on

the one hand and the nature and scope

of the intrusion on the other hand.
The Court, in Brignoni-Ponca, concluded on the basis
of precisely such a balance that it was not reasonable to
conduct, roving patrol stops in the absence of articulable

That is right*

Originally, there were

Border Patrol's traffic checking opera­

tions, all of which grew out of the statute which authorized
them to make stops and searches within 100 miles of the border
looking for aliens.
QUESTION:

And after Alroeida-Sanchez, Ortiz and

Brifvnoni-Ponce, this one is —
MR. EVANS:

This is what is left and it is, we think,

at, once the single most important aspect of the traffic-checking
program and also by far the least intrusive aspect.
In our

view, the Court's analysis leads to a

different result in this case because,

as I just indicated, I

th:-.nk, the stops involved in a checkpoint stop and inquiry
procedure is substantially less-intrusive and substantially
more essential to the effective control of illegal immigration.
As we read the decision in Brignoni-Ponce, the
decision

turned essentially on two controlling considerations„

25
First, the Court perceived that the roving patrol'
authority sought would permit Border Patrol officers to engage
in unlimited stops anywhere within a 100-mile zone -- anywhere
within a zone of 100 miles from the Mexican border which itself
is 2,000 miles long, day or night, on city streets, desert roads,
busy highways.
Every motorist

anywhere within the zone would be

potentially subject to limitless interference.
Second, the Court concluded that the nature of the
illegal alien traffic was such that it tends to generate
articulable grounds tor identifying violators and that a
requirement

of reasonable suspicion for roving patrol

stops

would allow the government an adequate opportunity to carry out
its, objective of protecting the public interest.
The Court, in short, so stated it was not convinced
that the legitimate needs of lav? enforcement required the degree
of interference with lawful traffic that it believed would be
occasioned by the authority that was sought in Brignoni-Ponce.
Well, neither of these considerations is applicable
here.

The authority sought for checkpoint officers would give

them no roving mandate to move about this zone of 100 miles from
the border to stop any car that they happened to see.
Strategically, each of the checkpoints is located at,
first <: * all. it is a fired location,
no.ire.

Some.of then do move

It is not ordinarily

from one to another location but

26

on essentially the same road and not — there is no roving
aspect to it.

The officer has no discretion of his own to

decide where are cars to be stopped or no authority to pursue
a car except on® that goes through a checkpoint without stopping.
There is no interference here with city traffic.
There is very little interference with commuter traffic.
Each of these checkpoints is placed strategically
at a — almost by a self-limiting process in a place where the
least amount of interference with lawful traffic would be
required in order to check what the Border Patrol considers to
be an essential route to ensure that no — to try to ensure
that none of the passing cars contain aliens who don't belong in
the country.
QUESTION:

•
or. Evans, who determines the location of
t

the checkpoints?
HR. EVANS:

By and large they are determined by

relatively high level Border Patrol officials in the field.
There are nine sectors that the Border Patrol has in the south­
west area and ordinarily the chief patrol agent in the sector
will determine the location of a checkpoint.
If if is a major checkpoint it .is not established
without consultation with higher officials, either in Washington
or in the regional office of the Immigration Service.

routes that might be used to avoid the San Clemente checkpoint.
In short, on this question of the scope of the
discretion given the officers to initiate encounters, the
degree of the potential interference with lawful traffic that
would be occasioned by permitting these stops at checkpoints
is substantially reduced over that the Court thought would be
involved in,the roving patrol situation.
It is true that the officer would retain discretion
at the checkpoint, particularly at checkpoints where the traffic
is heavy, as at San Clemente, to select certain cars for an
inquiry but there is no discretion as there was in Ortiz to
select cars for search randomly.
Of course, a car could be searched if probable
cause developed but there is no authority claimed her to make
that kind of invasion.
There is, in effect, no substantial invasion of
privacy which is what the Court referred to in Ortiz as being
involved in a search of a vehicle’s trunk.
Brignoni recognized that the intrusion occasioned
by a stop and inquiry is minimal.

It is modest.

What was significant in Brignoni was the extent of
the potential interference with the lawful traffic, not the
nature of the intrusion, which is not trivial.

our view is that the checkpoint officer, unlike a roving patrol
officer, simply is seldom in a position because of the nature
of the operation to observe a vehicle for a long enough period
or close enough before a stop to see suspicious signs suggesting
illegal activity.
\ roving patrol officer can follow a vehicle for as
long as he believes necessary in order to determine whether to
make a stop on the basis of articulated suspicion but a check­
point officer only has a brief second or two to look at an on­
coming car and the decision simply cannot in most instances be
made if there is something suspicious about the car and I should

Respondents concede this in their brief.

complexion, I suppose, of the driver and the passengers.
MR, EVANS:

I think it necessarily enters into it.

I don’t — the record sh6ws in the Baca case that it is not a

affront common sense to say that they •— if they are looking for
illegal Mexican aliens that they should ignore the facial
features of the occupants of the vehicle but the effort is made
to separate out the ones that in their experience lead them to
think maybe there is something wrong with' that car.

Sometimes:

32
it is articulable.

Sometimes it may not be,

I suspect that in

most instances if they were forced to articulate it, they could
articulate it but first of all, I am not certain that would
rise to the level of reasonable suspicion.
Certainly it would not rise to the level of reason­
able suspicion as the Ninth Circuit has interpreted that phrase
and there is a sense, I suppose — there is a certain amount of
sixth sense that the officers claim to be exercising that they
car

just tell, but they can't tell why, they refer to it as,

they just thought it warranted further inquiry.
And I think it also should be said that, although
randomness plays less and less a part of these checkpoints,
just because of the volume of traffic, there is a sense that
»

there ought to be some risks to any, even the most welldisguised operation, there ought to be some risk of apprehension
there and .to a certain extent, I suppose, there is
certain amount of randomness that goes into the stops and
particularly if the traffic is light they may stop a higher
proportion of the cars even though they might not believe that:
the particular car they are stopping is suspicious.
Now, at the other checkpoints, as 1 have said, the
practice has been to stop virtually all the cars that come by,
varying a little bit with the traffic and, as I said, if anybody
is recognisable as a local resident or someone who habitually
travels the area he is obviously not going to be stopped.

33
The point is that because of the nature of the check­
point operation, it is
Brignoni.

just not a situation like it was in

If a reasonable suspicion requirement is imposed on

checkpoint stops, it means that the government will not have an
adequate ability to enforce the law at these checkpoints.

They

will not be able to carry out their responsibilities and protect
the public interest and I think the likely consequence of a
reasonable suspicion requirement would be that the checkpoints
would have to be closed down because they simply couldn't be
operated in the effective way,
Now, one of the amicus briefs suggests that the
Border Patrol hasn't tried using spotter vehicles on either
ride or spotters of soma sort to alert checkpoint officers
that something suspicions may be coming up but I really wonder
if that is less intrusive.

I mean, if you can picture a line of

Border Patrol vehicles waiting a mile down the road from the
checkpoint and falling into place behind each approaching
vehicle and looking at it and seeing whether it is suspicious
and alerting the officer to stop it, it seems to me that is
much more intrusive than a brief stop with a question or two
about the citizenship of the occupants than there is to have a
riding alongside you for a mile.

I think that would offend

most people a lot more than a stop.
And what is the magic of the stop?
waat it is.

MR. EVANS:

Now, we recognise that the existence or

nonexistence of a prior judicial judgment as to the reasonable­
ness of the particular operation, may well bear upon the reason%

ableness balance itself, although we think that the nature of
the stops are sufficiently non-intrusive and the need for them
is sufficiently great that there is no need to worry about the
nonexistence or existence of a warrant.
We recognize its relevance and our view, to start
with, is that there is no need for a warrant in context of
fixed checkpoints.
First, because the intrusion is so relatively
innocuous that the procedure just doesn't present the kind

of

dangers that the warrant procedure is designed to protect
against.
,cause.

This, is not a search, at least not without probable
There -is no electronic eavesdropping here.

I mean, this

is relatively trivial.
1 think, Mr. Justice Stewart, you asked earlier if
tnere was anything in the record to indicate the overage length
of the stops.
There is something in the record as to the average
length of the stops at the San Clemente checkpoint.

38
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

I know that.
That was three to five minutes, which

appears in the application for the warrant. Although there is
nothing in the record to so indicate,

we were told that stops

at most other checkpoints consumed a total of less than a minute
but as a way of gauging how long for routine inquiries,

no

longer than about five seconds per occupant, so if you taka the
time he sees the checkpoint till the time he leaves, if there
are even three or four1 people in the car, it is likely to be less
than a minute unless something suspicious arises that warrants
further view or further investigation.
QUESTION:

I am not sure I understood that statisti­

cal data — those statistical data in the San Clemente record
because you keep saying — repeating in your brief that the stop
here involves no more intrusion and certainly no more time than
a

top for a traffic light or a stop sign which,

as we know, is

generally a matter of a second —■ lass than a minute.
And yet. the indication is that the average atop is
from three to five minutes, which is considerably longer.

But

•io 1' understand that that three to five minute period is of
those that are put over into secondary?
MR. EVANS:

That is right.

The ones who are referred

off the highway at San Clemente, because of the referral off
the highway, take a little longer than the other checkpoints do,
may take fcnree to five minutes at other checkpoints if

39

someone for some reason gives rise to suspicion but at 3an
Clemente, the initial inquiry is made by an officer at the
secondary area and so there is necessarily a referral and it
takes a little bit longer, but it is not, essentially, a long
delay.
QUESTION:

So,

it is substantially longer than a

stop sign or a traffic light.
MR. EVANS:

Well, it is substantially longer.

QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

That is more like a toll booth stop.
Yes, if that.

And they don't even

extract money from you at the checkpoints.
QUESTION:

No.

QUESTION:

And again, length of time we are talking

about.
MR. EVANS:

Yes.

Well, a second reason why we think warrants would
be

unnecessary in the context of checkpoint stops is that the

stationary nature and the regularized procedure of the operation
makes it, in a sense, unnecessary to have repeated renewals of
warrants for one particular

checkpoint, which is the procedure:

that was followed for some time at San Clemente and other check­
points in the Ninth Circuit after the Ninth Circuit ruled that
we could not operate them without warrants.
Unlike a roving patrol which, in each case I assume
would be essentially unique, a checkpoint does not change
substantially from day-to-day or even from year-to-year and in
our view, judicial scrutiny can most appropriately await an
occasion in an adversary criminal proceeding where the reason­
ableness of its operation can be determined and once determined,
cne way cr the other, there is an opportunity for appeal by
either side and that ultimate resolution of that checkpoint
would stand.

I mean, that would be the end of it.

Either you

would know that checkpoint was reasonable without precluding

41
other people fron, challenging it or you would know that it was
unreasonable, in which case the government would have no choice
but to close it down.

But it is a single spot.

It is not a

unique, special situation requiring advance approval of a judge
because each time it comes to the judge for approval, the judge
says, "Well, I already looked at this last weak.

No reason to

go through this all again.”
And I think that minimizes at least the need for a
warrant of the kind that Mr. Justice Powell suggested in the
concurring opinion in Almeida-Sanchez.

difficult.

At least, they agree it would be very

They say that is the price to be paid, but I think

it enters into the question of whether, indeed, it should be
paid.
First of all, there is a problem of coordination.
All of these checkpoints are — almost all these checkpoints
are correlated with others that are nearby, as I was responding
to Mr. Justice Marshall before.
its own.

A checkpoint does not stand on

It is coordinated with other checkpoints in the area

so that there is no easy way for a person intent on violating
the immigration laws of avoiding defection.
It doesn't always work but that is the aim and if
one magistrate says checkpoint A is okay but the other magis­
trate says checkpoint 3 is no good, well, that is just like
having no checkpoint at all because everybody is going to go up
where checkpoint B is located.
The second thing is the need for flexibility.

The

checkpoints we have here don’t face this problem because these
are permanent checkpoints in the sense that they are operated
roughly around the clock all year and. there is no question
about their operation except if the weather is bad or manpower
is short.

43
But there are other checkpoints that can't be oper­
ated all the time or there is no need to operate them all the
time and experience has shown that Border Patrol agents, the
supervisory officials need to have that flexibility to establish
a checkpoint that perhaps hasn't been used regularly but the
effect of a warrant requirement, because you have to know well
in advance whether you are going to use it may be to limit the
use of the checkpoints only to the major ones which, in the
lonq run, serve very little purpose because the secondary routes
would then become flooded.
--•d third, and I think I mentioned this a second ago
in this context, there is no established procedure for
Appellate review of a denial of a warrant and the Government
would have little recourse if a magistrate or a judge refused
to grant a warrant and that happened to us during the period
of the warrant procedure in the Ninth Circuit.

We had several

warrants denied and we were unable to do anything about it and
r '

the checkpoint had to be shut down.
Of course, if the ruling were to occur in an adver­
sary proceeding, there would be no question about review,
•'fell, if we are wrong about the need for a warrant
and we need one, that would affect only the Texas case.

If we

can only operate these checkpoints with warrants, the Texas
case is a loser but the San Clemente stops were authorised in
advance by a warrant precisely, I think, of the sort that was

44
envisioned by Mr. Justice Powell's concurring opinion in
Almeida-Sanehez.
We think it was superfluous here but there was a
prior judicial approval of the very operation that led to the
stops and inquiries and subsequent arrests of these cases in
California and we think this represents an additional basis for
concluding that the stops here were reasonable.
The Court of Appeals in the Ninth Circuit in this
case, and our California Respondents would give the warrant no
weight because in their view it is unlawfully broad bub their
argument has a kind of Catch 22 flavor about it because they
argue on the one hand that you need reasonable suspicion to
make a stop and if you don’t have reasonable suspicion, then it
is essential that, you have a warrant .

issue.:»

It reqr
requires an analysis and a weighing of the basic

agency decision to conduct a checkpoint.
Now, Hr, Justice Powell’s suggestion in his con­
curring opinion in A Imeida-Sanchez was for a warrant' that
would authorise roving patrol searches over precisely the kind
or area that was involved in Brignoni-Ponce, although a

45
magistrate would, in advance, limit the area and the four
dissenting justices, although dissenting as to the need for the
warrant, agreed that that would be consistent with Fourth
Amendment requirements,,
This warrant is substantially more limited, authorzing only stops, not searches and limited only to a specific
location and not to

any roving, extended aspects,.

It is true that the focus of a "warrant of this sort
is necessarily less precise than it would be the case for more
conventional crime but the special problems of enforcement in
this respect, as they are detailed in Mr. Justice Powell's
concurring opinion we think justifies an unconventional solution
and in this context I think one can say that a warrant is
sufficiently precise if it identifies the place where the
operation is to take place, remembering at all times here that
we are talking about stops and brief inquiries, that it
identifies trj purpose and the scope of the operation and that,
as narrowly as is feasible, it limits the class of vehicles to
be sub jacted to it.
in this case, the class is northbound vehicles on
Interstate 5, which is not a very narrow class, but it is as
narrow as is feasible.

Maybe some of them the same people, but -The Court of Appeals used the figure of

10 million which I think is an accurate reflection of the
number of vehicles that pass that point annually, although the
checkpoint is operated only about 60 percent of the time which
is perhaps a little bit less and the figures would indicate tha
only something less than half of that actually pass through
during the period when the checkpoint is in operation.

It’s pretty close to a general warrant,

isn't it?
MR. EVANS:

Well, it is close in the sense that it

is somewhat general, but it is not close in the sense of what i

books and papers are being rummaged through.

never got heavy, as it does frequently at that point, they
would operate it around the clock.
their aim.

They would like to.

That is

But there are various reasons why it can’t always

be done.
QUESTION:

It seems to me it is one of the most

important ones in the structure and —
MR. EVANS:

Well, it is.

But you see, to a certain

extent, Mr. Justice Blackmun, it is a deterrent and shutting it
down for a few hours is not going to increase substantially its
deterrent value because the persons who are intent to travel
that was illegally don't know, necessarily, when it is down.
Now, you, know, I think the briefs reflect some of
the evidence that was developed in the consolidated proceedings
i:o the Southern District of California that there were scouting
operations, there were what are called "load

houses" where

illegal aliens are kept until a scout has told — has called
back and said the checkpoint is down.
3ut there are, you know, ways of meeting that
problem, too, and they will frequently open the checkpoint
unexpectedly

shutting down and catch, as the record

indicates, an enormous number of people who were trying to
get, through at that point.
xt has been referred to by the Border Patrol people

48
I have talked to as really a game.

It is like a chess game.

They are trying to outguess their adversary, in effect.
QUESTION:

Do you — is it reasonable to assume that

you agree with Mr. Bennett that if there is something to
indicate that the car has just come from Mexico, that there is
a suspicion that would support a stop?
MR. EVANS:

I think that if there is reason to

believe that a vehicle had just crossed the border you have what
would amount to a functional equivalent of a border search.
The example that you were posing to Mr. Bennett
may not be a realistic one, Mr. Chief Justice, because if the
car came through at a point where officers could put a sticker
on it, it has been subjected to an inspection.

We don't have

any problem with people who ccme through where they can be
inspected.

That car has been subjected to the scrutiny that

ordinarily goes with coming into this country.
It is the cars that don't come through.

Now, those

tars are usually on this side of the border and they are left in
remote areas for people who cross the border in remote areas to
drive away in and those cars —
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:
You know, i

People who cross the border on foot.
Illegally, that’s right, clandestinely.

we -/ere in a position to put a sticker on the car,

we wouldn't need to search it later because we have already
inspected it.

49
QUESTION:

Well, one of the factors is time.

There

was a period shown by one of the records in one of the cases
here where they stopped every car crossing the border and it
became an international incident with Mexico protesting —
HR. EVANS:
QUESTION?

That’s right.
And employers on the American side

protesting.
MR. EVANS:

I think in that event, as I say,, if that

were a problem and if that 'fere to be done, if it were clear —
the Ninth Circuit rules themselves hold •— if there is a reason­
able certain-:;;/ that you have got a person or a vehicle containing
things or persons has just crossed the border, you can conduct
what amounts to a border search wherever you find them.
QUESTION:

Does this record anywhere show any current

estimate as to the number of illegal aliens in the country?
Some of your prior cases have reflected 10 or 11 million.
MR. EVANS:
point.

This record is a little stale at this

At*, the Baca hearing in the District Court in California

the estimate was somewhat less than a million but there are
recant estimates that have been given in testimony by
Commissioner Chapman of the Immigration and Naturalisation
Service to Congress that have indicated that the current estimate
is closer to six to eight million and as you indicate, there
■iave been various estimates and some put it as high as 12 million.
Some of those fior. res are reflected in a
report that the House

50
Judiciary Committee made recently with respect to legislation
dealing with making it a crime to knowingly hire illegal aliens.
I'd like to reserve, if I may, the balance of my time,,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Evans.

Mr. Sevilla.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES Ml, SEVILLA, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF MARTINEZ-FUERTE
MR. SEVILLA;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

tiie Court;
In the position of Respondent I would like to reply
to some of the points made by Mr. Evans during his argument.
First, I think a brief statement as to what happens
at the checkpoint again is in order.

Last year Mr. Evans and I

disagreed on this point and we disagree again.

I think if one

looks at the photograph provided by the government in the reply
brief to Ortiz, you can see what the oncoming traffic faces at
the San Clemente checkpoint.
That is, two armed law enforcement officers standing
in the middle of the highway in front of stop signs which say
clearly is top” and overhead there are two additional signs
saying "'Stop."
This is what is called the primary Stop, what the
Baca court said is the "fleeting ston" and it is this where the
officer, without any guideline, regulation or rule makes
do.c-is :v;

a

iiier' or not La. is going to let that individual whom

51
lie has stopped and sees momentarily pass on his passage north­
ward or is to be referred to the secondary area for the inter­
rogation as to the right of the individuals to be in the United
States,
QUESTION:

Now, does that happen to every car?

NR. SEVILLA:

That happens to every car when the

checkpoint is running.
QUESTION:

It does.

MR. SEVILLA:

The point officer makes a stop or the

functional equivalent of a stop and then decides whether or not
he is going to allow that person to go forward.
QUESTION:

And he does that with every car.

’ R. SEVILLA:
QUESTION:

With every car.

And that is the so-callecl '’fleeting stop.

MR. SEVILLA;

That is the fleeting stop.

Then he

selects -QUESTION:

About one out of 20.

MR. SEVILLA:

Whatever the figures — whatever car

he wants to have further inspected.

The car is referred to the

secondary area off the road and during this time, between 50 —
during the average time of the secondary stop, between 60 and
100 other cars will bo waved through and they will look to the
right and see the one victim being interrogated by the law
enforcement officers as to the right to be here.

That stop, as

Mr. Evans indicated, is approximately three to five minutes.

52

There are approximately 1,200 care going through
this checkpoint every hour and therefore if you break it down it
is about 100.
QUESTION:

What is the problem if he stops and he

sees two people laying down hidden on the floor?

What problem

is there with that?
MR. SEVILLA:

With the stop, the initial intrusion

without any factual basis?
QUESTION:

Mo, I said after he stops and he sees

that, certainly there is no complaint about him going to the
secondary area after that, is there?
MR. SEVILLA,s

If you justify —- if you can justify

the initial intrusion, but it seems to me the Fourth Amendment
requires •—
QUESTION:

My point was —

MR. SEVILLA:
QUESTION:
over on the side.

— a factual basis for the stop.

You were talking about just feeing run

But once he does stop him and once he

sees

illegal aliens or what appear to be illegal aliens or for some
reason, somebody laying down on the floor and sends them over
to secondary, the only complaint there is the stop.
MR. SEVILLA:

Yes.

lurid without a factual basis to

allow the point officer to be in a position to see that, I
would submit that it is arbitrary, capricious and unconstitu­
tional.

If the whole purpose of the amendment is to have a

53
factual predicate for a seizure, then without a factual predi­
cate for the seizure, it seams to me it would be unjustified to
stop a person who is going 55 miles an hour on an interstate
highway, 66 miles north of the border without any connection to
the border at all.
QUESTIONs

They could stop him for a red light,

MR. SEVILLA;

Yes, I know.

The government has

alluded that this is the equivalent of a red. light.
Well, at a red light you don't have armed law
enforcement officers inspecting your physiognomy, your interior
of your car and deciding whether or not they want to refer you ~
QUESTION?

Well, you could.

MR. SEVILLA:
QUESTION:

They could.

A police officer could stand at the stop

sign and look into your car and there is nothing in the world
wrong with that.
MR. SEVILLA:
QUESTION:

I agree.

I agree absolutely,,

And if he saw contraband in there, he

could operate accordingly, couldn't he?
MR. SEVILLA:

That is correct, but that is not

what is happening —
QUESTION:

Which is to lock you up.

MR. SEVILLA:

That is not what is happening in these

ca;es and I would submit that the whole purpose of the stop
procedure: in to allow the officers to look at the individuals,

54
to seize them momentarily and make a decision as to whether they
are going to allow the person free passage on.
QUESTION:

Your only point is the stop.

MR. SEVILLA:
QUESTION;

That you are objecting to.

MR. SEVILLA:
whole intrusion.

The only point is the stop.

Well, that is the beginning of the

The stop — I object to the initial stop and

of course wo would, perforce, object to the intrusion that
follows being referred off the highway and interrogated for
three to five minutes, but I would object to both.
QUESTION:

You don't object to the guard looking in

the car, do you?
MR. SEVILLA;

At. a stop sign somewhere in the city,

any officer can look at traffic, just as any citizen can but
they can’t put up a roadblock to stop all the northbound traffic
66 miles north of the border and above 13 communities and some
two million inhabitants just to stop people to see .if they look
like cicxzens or lawful residents.
After all, there are a lot of legal citizens and
residents of brown skin who have a right to proceed northward
and if we are talking about, the right to have this fleeting
stop, what is going to be the factor that the officer grasps
on to decide whether to wave someone to secondary?

It is

going to be
QUESTION:

When you see somebody laying down in the

55
back of the car hiding,,
MR. SEVILLA:

Well, if you can see that, but the

more typical case is just going to be the random, arbitrary
decision to refer someone off to secondary.
QUESTION:

In this case,, that is what he did see,

didn't he?
MR. SEVILLA:
QUESTION:

No, but in the record —

MR. SEVILLA:
QUESTION:

Not in ray case, no.

There is no record on what he saw.

In the Texas case he saw three of them»

MR. SEVILLA:

Laying down after the initial stop,

correct.
QUESTION:

But he had to do something then, didn't

he?
MR. SEVILLA:

Well, it may have allowed foz* further

investigation but that is not the factors in my case and, again,
X would just hark back to my point that without a factual
predicate under Brignoni-Ponce, there is no basis for stopping
an individual who is proceeding away from the border.
QUESTION:

Where was the illegal passenger in your

case?
MR. SEVILLAi

There were two women and they were seated

upright in the passenger compartment,
QUESTION:

Mr. Sevilla, I take it from what you have

said that your argument would be the same if you represented a

56
non-Mexican who had been subjected only to the fleeting stop.
MR. SEVILLA:
QUESTION:

Oh, yes,.

Yes.

But the point is that ..

But you probably wouldn't be in Court.

MR. SEVILLA:

We. probably wouldn't.

The names of

these cases, I think, tell something about what goes on at the
checkpoints.

In Almeida-Sanchez --

QUESTION:

Well, I understand that, but the answer

to my question is, that if you represented a non-Mexican who
had been stopped for five seconds, you would make the same
constitutional argument.
MR. SEVILLA:

Yes, but there is more to it.

If I

was representing a non-Mexican individual, he would not be just
stopped at the primary point, he would be waved off the road
and subjected to the interrogation.

All you would have was the Plaintiff’s

MR. SEVILLA:

That is all we would have and that is

the whole point of the Fourth Amendment is to protect those
intrusions so these people do not have to sue the government
for a five-second stop,,

There is no forum unless there is a

factual predicate upon which an officer bases his decision.

I understand that, but you are saying, in

MR. SEVILLA:

That is the beginning.

That is the

The facts of our case, of course, are

more aggravated than that.

That is the beginning of the

intrusion, certainly.
QUESTION:

Yqs, I understand.

QUESTION;

So you would have a Plaintiff’s case

under Bivens.
MR. SEVILLA;

We would have a plaintiff's case but as

■we stated in Qrtxz to this- Court, we quoted Anthony Amsterdam's
article, there is no lawyer in the world that would take; a case
like that and that is why the Fourth Amendment requires some
protection for the innocent citizenry who travels northward
into California.

58

Mo one is qoina to take a suit like that.

We have tc

the officers.
QUESTION:

Counsel, you should read some of the

petitions for certiorari in this Court and you would find that
your statement is not supported.
NR. SEVILLA.:

I have probably written a few, your

Honor,
QUESTION:

Yes, I think just the statement that "No

lawyer in tie world would take a case like that" is slightly
broad.
NR. SEVILLA:

class action, we would have a case.
QUESTION:

Suppose the client wanted you to bring a

1983 damage suit against the officer for delaying him?
QUESTION:

That is what I said.

QUESTION:

Right.

NR. SEVILLA:
QUESTION:

Right.

You wouldn't take the case.

NR. SEVILLA:

As a practical matter, he would have a

claim but i; would be da minimus unless it was a class action,
course and then they could hand out five-dollar bills to
every one they stopped.
QUESTION:

I have two questions, if I may, very

59

briefly.

I‘11 ask first, as I understand your theory, it

applies to just a slow-down.

We talk about a stop, but even if

they just slow them down to ten miles an hour to look in the
oar without any reason for separating them out.
MR, SEVILLA:

That is —

That is a lesser intrusion.

It is

still an intrusion without a factual purpose.
QUESTION:

Well, why is it lesser?

They look in the

windows both times, whether they stop or not.

I mean, you don't

rely on the conversation aspects of’the stop.

It is just the —

MR. SEVILLA:

That is an extension of the intrusion,

certainly.
QUESTION:

So they are slowing down — they are

slowing up to look in — is the same as the stop to look in,
under the -MR. SEVILLA:
QUESTION:

Basically, yes.

And under your theory, do I correctly

conclude that the random stop that Mr. Bennett discussed to
ask if there were a driver’s license in the operator’s posses­
sion would be equally .invalid.
MR. SEVILLA;

Absolutely not.

That is not the case

here at all.
QUESTION:

What is the difference?

MR. SEVILLA:

Well, as the Court pointed out in

Brignoni-Fonce, Border Patrol officers don't have anything to
do with' regulating highway usage and also, the only way you can

60
enforce the law with respect to traffic

safety and individuals

carrying a license is to step the individual on the road and
see if they have a driver’s license.

There are numerous

alternatives to deterring and apprehending illegal aliens in
this country oxice they have intruded into the. interior of the
country so there are a number of alternatives to the police
power of the states regulating highway usage and safety which
are not analagous by any means to this case and as the Court
said in Brignoni, that is not the issue in these Border Patrol
stop cases.

That is not the issue.
QUESTION:

Now, your statement just now was, "once

they have intruded," so you want to give them the first bite.
Arcs there alternatives to keep them out in the first place?
MR. SEVILLA:

Yes.

Well, as the Baca hearings

there has to be some commitment
problem.

show.,

by Congress to solving this

The Government attorneys make a very persuasive pitch

to the Courts to solve the problem and as Justice White concluded,
the Courts can't solve the problem alone.

We need some help

from the legislative branch.
For one thing, in the Baca hearings, and as you will
see in our brief, there are only 30 people, 30 Border Patrolmen
on a typical day shift covering the entire California-Mexican
border .- 30 people for about 125 to 140 miles of border.
is an impossible situation.

That

They haven't got enough men to

respond to their sensor alerts on the border.

They haven’t got

61
enough money to repair the fences that are down in the high
flooding areas.

They can’t even replace fences and one of the

agents testified in the Baca hearing that the appropriations to
get the fences repaired have been stricken in Congress every
year and, of course, the major deterrent, even as the Border
Patrol officials concede, the major deterrent is going to be
to pass legislation to cut off the magnet for the illegal alien
entering this country, and. that is employment and this Court
can't legislate that legislation.
It has to come from Congress and if they are not
concerned about the problem enough to solve it, I don't think
that v/e should dilute the protections of the Fourth Amendment to
solve a law enforcement problem which Congress has control over
but has not deemed it fit, at this point at least,

to try to

solve it and I think unless they go to that alternative^ we
shouldn’t take the lowest constitutional road to solve the
problem, as Justice Judge Oakes said in the Second Circuit in
the Border Patrol stop case in United States versus Barbera.
So there are other circuits, also, that have looked
at this problem and you will, note the only lengthy written
opinions which rule on this issue are the ones that.old that
;.a Fourth Amendment protections apply because those are the
o. ly ones that can be written that are easy to write.

The

other ones are a one-line opinion saying,

reason­

able."

"It appears

62

"The stop is not reasonable without a factual predi­
cate giving the officers a reasonable suspicion to believe that
illegal activity is afoot"and that is the language directly out
of Terry versus Ohio where "reasonableness" is defined.
The only way that we can take the factual predicate
away is if we are in a purely administrative atmosphere such
as Camera.

This Court held in Almeida-Sanchez that the adminis­

trative analogy does not apply and it doesn't apply here,
either.

We are in the same situation.
QUESTION:

What is the present status of that

employment legislation?
MR. SEVILLA:

Well, as I understand it. Senator

McClellan, who is the head of the Immigration Subcommittee in
the Senate, has decided to hold the first meeting of his Sub­
committee in seven years to consider the Rodino Bill or a
Rodino-type Jill.

,

The Rodino Bill has
as I understand it.

passed the House several times,

It has never been brought to the Floor of

the Senate and as I understand it — and I read in the paper
about a month or two ago that Senator McClellan has decided to
call a meeting of the Subcommittee.
And I think that is where the answer lies.

No matter

what the decision this Court makes in these cases, the Illegal
alien problem is not going to go away.

When Border Patrol

powers were in full flower, the problem was as great as it is

63
today and I made an estimate in our brief that up 20 percent of
Mexico was currently residing in this country, if you take
accepting the Border Patrol's figures.
That, of course, came about with Border Patrol
powers in full flower.

It is an ineffective deterrent.

They

can get through — San Clemente, for example, is only open
seventy percent of the time and ninety-five percent of the
aliens traversing through that checkpoint get through.

It is —

San Clemente is an ineffective deterrent, as are all Border
Patrol checkpoints.
And the other point, the irony of this case is that
Brignoni-Ponce involved the same area, the San Clemente check­
point.

In that case, rather than standing in the middle of the

highway, the officers, of course, were seated in a car perpen­
dicular to the roadway, saw Mr. Brignoni, thought he was a
Mexican-iooking individual, pulled out and stopped him.
The only difference in this case is that the officer
was standing in the middle of the road and I can't be ieva that
:hat difference is of constitutional significance when peoples
rights are at stake and especially when the discretion, which is
unbridled at this point, for a point officer to decide to take
people off the road is so subject to possible abuse because we
are dealing with sensitive factors such as the racial appear­
ance of an individual and in Southern California, we have a
substantial Mexican-American population who are validly

64
residing there.
For the Government to say, well, the point officer
only stops or lets through the local inhabitants is unreal.
It is unrealistic to believe that a point officer is
going to know the 1.5 million residents who are in southern -south of the San Clemente checkpoint.
QUESTION:

When you referred to Senator McClellan’s

committee which had not met for seven years —
MR. SEVILLA:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And it is now going to meet, is that to

consider the legislation chat relates to making it a criminal
act to employ an illegal alien knowingly?
MR. SEVILLA:
QUESTION:

That is my understanding, yes.

That hasn't anything to do with the fence

and the other deficiencies in our border situation, has it?
MR. SEVILLA:

No, but that is certainly something fo

Congress to act upon if they want to solve the problem.
If the Government considers it a problem, as I said
before, it seems to me that they should be acting upon it
rather than trio Government attorneys coming to the courts to
ask for a dilution of traditional Fourth Amendment protection.
And if I might say something about the warrants sine
trim

about up? this is a warrant, perhaps not

against the

re American nation, but it is a warrant

against the

rs population of Southern Cal ifornia.

65
The warrant was unlimited.

It was perpetual.

It

did not even attempt to meet Justice Powell's four factors in
AlKieida~Sanche% for the functional equivalent of probable cause
because it couldn't.

Ninety-nine point nine percent [S3.9] of

the vehicles, not the people, the vehicles going through the
checkpoint contained no aliens at all, no illegal aliens and, of
course, the figure would be higher for the number of people
traversing that checkpoint.
That in no way could be deemed the functional equi­
valent of probable cause.
Second, there is no nexus to the border.

There is —

if we are talking about the equation for functional equivalency
which was not even attempted to be met in this warrant.
is no nexus to the border.

There

It is 66 miles from the border and

as we point out in our brief, we attached a little appendix
here to show where the border is at the bottom and some 66 miles
north of the border up near the San Clemente area is the check­
point "long 1-5, the major route north for Southern California
and it is above soma, oh, 15 major communities, including San
Diego and Oceanside.
So this warrant, as the Court below indicated, does
not even approach Mr. Justice Powell's criteria.

The magistrate

merely concluded that there was cause to believe that massive
immigration violations were taking placa.
"k thout even citing a particular statute he just said

66
"There is probable cause to believe that violations of Title VIII
were taking place," and we say, consider a warrant which indi­
cated that there was probable cause to believe that Title 18
violations were taking place in an area.
It is much too wide.

It is not the type of warrant

that is for a. location near* the border to form as a stopgap for
areas where there is no Border Patrol port of entry where
people can be checked.
In our

brief, we do include the alternatives

because the Government pitches its case on the need — we point
out that there are numerous alternatives.

The Border Patrol

has about ten other programs other than traffic checks.

They

include farm and ranch checking, airport terminal checking,
industrial checking.
We point out in our brief that in twenty days in Los
Angeles the Border Patrol captured 12,000 illegal aliens in
twenty days ■— seventy agents in a twenty-day working period
captured 12,000 in the- Los Angeles area just walking along the
street and asking people for their identifications.
That is a much more efficient way of doing things
than stopping the ingress of the entire Southern California
population into the Los 7mgeles area and points northward.
QUESTION:

Do you think that is a constitutionally

permissible intrusion, walking along the street and stopping any
passerby and asking for his identification?

MR. SEVILLA:

At the checkpoints there are seizures taking place.

You cannot go anyplace.

If you try to run the checkpoint you

are going to be flagged down and arrested, and if you don't
answer, you are going to be detained until you come up with an
answer that satisfies the officer at the checkpoint.
Cf someone is walking along the street and is simply
asked a question, as long as there is no seizure according to,

probably no problem.

We are just asking a question.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OP MARK L. EVANS, ESQ.
MR. EVANS:

I’ll make it brief.

It is quite mis­

leading to say that 99.9 percent of the vehicles contain no
aliens;

parcent of them aren't referred over ~~ or about

68

99 percent of them aren’t referred over for secondary inspection.
Of those that are, the figures under the warrant of
issue here show that 21 percent were, in fact, found with
illegal aliens in it.
Mr. Chief Justice, on the status of the legislation,
what used to be HR 982 in the House has now been made up into a
clean bill called HR 8713 which was reported to the House by the
Judiciary Committee on September 24, 1975 in report number 94506.
The Senate has been — one of the stumbling blocks
in this legislation in the past, Senator Eastland, Chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee has recently introduced his own
version of the bill, it is S3074 which, at Sections 12 and 13
make it unlawful to knowingly employ illegal aliens.
Although the bill as submitted by Senator Eastland
does not have criminal penalties, it has a civil penalty
structure.
