MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We’ll hear arguments first

this morning in 74-1318, Drew Municipal Separate School District
against Andrews.
Counsel,? you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHAMP T. TERNEY, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. TERNEY;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
I am Champ Terney, from Indianola, Mississippi,
representing the Petitioners, Drew Municipal Separate School
District and the individuals, the Superintendent and the Board
of Trustees of the School District.
The Court has in this case permitted divided argu­
ment for both the Petitioners and the Respondents.

I will

speak first on behalf of the Petitioners and Mr. A1lain of
Jackson, Mississippi, will argue in rebuttal, fox' the
Petitioners.
I think that it is important in this particular case
to discuss the factual background against which the rule in
question was adopted.
The town of Drew, Mississippi, is located in a rural
area of the Mississippi Delta, in Sunflower County, Mississippi,
and according to the 1970 Census had a population of 2574.
The School District is comprised of the town of Drew

4
and some additional territory, added territory, outside tire
town and within the county of Sunflower®

The entire District

has a population of approximately five to six thousand'resi­
dents ®
The school itself is divided into an elementary
school, a junior high school, and a high school! in all twelve
grades, with approximately 1200 students»

Eighty percent of

which, at the time of this litigation, were black! twenty
percent white®

It is a public school system in Mississippi®

QUESTION:

How many separata schools?

MR® TERNEY: There are three separate schools®

There

is Hunter High School, Hunter Junior High School, and A® W®
James Elementary School®
QUESTION:

So the whole school population goes

successively to each of these three schools! is that it?
MR® TERNEY:
QUESTION:
MR® TERNEY:

Yes, Mr® Justice Stewart? that’s correct®
Are all the buildings in one location?
They are all, Mr® Justice Brennan,

within the town of Drew®

They are scattered in locations

throughout 'the community®
The school system is fully Integra tad, and the
district court so found in this particular case, that it’s
fully integrated as to faculty, staff, and students®
During the school year 1971-72, within this school
system, there were 28 school-girl pregnancies, requiring those

5

children, 13 to 17 years of age, to be forced to withdraw from
school, to give birth to children out of wedlock»
In Sunflower County, Mississippi, alone, the
statistics in this record, as introduced by the respondents
as an exhibit in the record and is incorporated in the
Appendix, the statistics for 1371 show that of all live births
in Sunflower County, Mississippi, 35»2 percent were illegiti~
mate.
How, faced with this situation,- the alarming rise in
school-girl pregnancies, and an alarming rate of illegitimate
births within the community and county, the Superintendent,
after having learned of the fact that there were teachers
within — teacher’s aides within his school system that were
parents of children born out of wedlock, Mr. Pettey, the
Superintendent, activated his rule.
in just a moment.

And I'll discuss the rule

Which resulted in the non-rehiring of one

of the respondents herein, and the non-hiring of the other
respondent herein.
Now, the rule has been much discussed.
a codified rule.

It was not

The rule was Mr. Pettey’s, and it was

subsequently approved by the Board of Trustees.
I would like to state what we feel and submit to the
Court constitutes the rules

that no individual who is the

natural parent of a child bora out of wedlock may be employed
in the Drew schools as a teacher or teacher aide or in any other

6
position or capacity in direct contact with the students, end
that has a potential role model status.
The rule was to regulate the status and not the
present morals of an individual seeking employment.
Nov/, the respondent Rogers was employed during the
19 71--72 school year as a teacher aide.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Terney, could I just interrupt for a

second?
Where, did you quote the rule from?

Is that from the

principal’s testimony or is that in writing somewhere?
MR. TERNEYs

Mr. Justice Stevens, this is from a

distillation of the testimony in the record, and the way the
rule is applied.
QUESTION;

But is it counsel’s distillation, the

trial court’s, or the witnesses5, or whose is it exactly?
MR. TERNEY;

At this point I can only say that it’s

counsel’s, arrived at through rereading the record and the
testimony in the record.
QUESTIONS
QUESTION;

And the application of the rule.

X sea.
So the rule applies to much more than just

*

teachers and teachers’ aides, doesn’t it?
MR. TERNEY;
QUESTION;
MR. TERNEY;

That’s correct, —»
A much broader spectrum of employees.
That’s correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.

It. does, it would affect any indi.vidu.al that had direct contact

7
with the students and who served in a role model capacity.
In other words* an individual to whom the students related and
looked up in a role model status»
QUESTION;

Well* that would be just about everybody*

except maybe the people who were
MR» TERNEYs
QUESTION?

Cafeteria workers ar© excluded* *—
— there at the night when the students

aren't* to do janitorial service* wouldn't it?
MR. TERNEY:

Correct»

Unless — I think the

Superintendent was unclear at the time of his testimony as to
whether it would affect school bus drivers and some such things
as this»
But I think it's fair to say -that it would affect
anyone to whom the students could relate in a role model
capacity* and that would* in the District's opinion* have an
impact upon their learning experience»
QUESTION;
as a rule.

You've been referring to this* counsel*

Might it not be more accurate to say that this was

an employment policy or a personnel policy?
MR. TERNEY;

Mr. Chief Justice* you are exactly right.
4

I think it has been designated as a rule»
it is not written»

I think you are correct in saying it is a

policy of employment»
QUESTION;

It is not codified*

Yes* sir»
Can you tell us to what employees

specifically this policy* personnel policy applied in addition

8

to teachers and teacher aides?
MR. TERNEYs

Hr0 Justice Stewart, there has been no

other individual within the school system that has been caught
by this rule and excluded from employment, other than teachers
or teacher aides „
Nov/, a reading of the record will reflect that the
Superintendent at the time of his testimony was not completely
certain as to the full application of the rule»

I think it

had to be taken on a case-by-case basis„
QUESTION?

It was his rule, wasn't it, his policy?

MR* TERNEYs That's correct*
QUESTION:

But I think --

If he wasn't certain, how could anybody

else be?
MRo TERNEYs

Mr* Justice Stewart, he was not certain

as to the particular jobs $ ha would have to look at the
particular job at the particular time*

In other words, ha was

questioned — and it's in the Appendix, his testimony in the
Appendix on cross-examination begins on page 35*

And he was

questioned at length about this„
Reading on page 38 of the Appendix, he was questioned
as to whether or not the policy would extend to teachers, and
his answer was "Yes*”
"To teacher aides?"
” Librari ans ? "

"Yes,”

" Yes *t3

"Extends to gym teachers?"

"Yes*"

e
"Would it extend to a cafeteria workers?10

"Yes»

I have never had that to occur, but I think it would, yes»"
"What about a secretary?"
"A janitor?"

"Yes»83

!,I‘m not sure about janitors»"

"Why not?*
His answer was s
each day»

"A janitor runs into the children

I think each one of us can remember some janitor

who gave us candy or was close to us»
janitor?"

Would it extend to a

That's still the question»
His answer is;

"I don't know.

It hasn't occurred

and I haven't mads that decision yet,”
"Would it extend to a bus driver?”
"A school bus driver?"

"I can't say»”

"Would it extend to a nurse?"
"A social worker?"
’’A principal?"

No response»

"Yes.”

"Well, if we had a social worker»w

"Yes»"

"A parti' who volunteers to do school work or to work
with teachers?"

His answer was, "If we had those, it would,

yes»"
"Would you object to a PTA president on the basis of
his unwed parenthood?"
QUESTION:

"I would»"
Well, do you think that — there are just

teachers involved in this case, aren't there?
MR» TERNEYs

Yes, Mr» Justice White, the only two

involved — this is not a class action, the only two individuals

involved were applicants ~ one was an applicant for a teacher
aide position, and the other —
QUESTION;

Do you think you need to defend the

outer boundaries of this rule or not?
HR. TERNEY:
brief so reflects»

Our position is that we do not.

And our

That these individuals who were caught by

the rule cannot be put in the position of asking that the
rule be stricken down because someone, some other individual
may b© caught by it.
QUESTION;

One minor questions

Was this rule

published?
MR. TERNEY;

Mr0 Justice Marshall, it was disseminated

•through the staff level of the school by the Superintendent
down to the individuals responsible for recommending teachers
for employment.
QUESTION;

And to the teachers?

MR. TERNEY; And to the teachers, through the
principal? that's correct.
Going back to — and it may be helpful to the Court,
to give a little background on the respondents involved.
The respondent Rogers , who was employed and was in
the employ of the School District from
year, served as a teacher aide.
teacher’s as such.

in the 1971-72 school

Now, teacher aides are not

They assist the teachers.

They have

probably more direct contact with the students than the teachers

11
themselves»

They go with the students to recess , to the

cafeteria., they assist 'them in different activities throughout
the day„
The respondent Rogers, serving in this capacity, was
single and had one child, which there5s no question, there's no
conflict of evidence to the effect that this child was born
out of wedlocks

She was notified during the spring of 1972 that

she would not be reemployed for the 72-73 school yesar»
At the time she was notified she was pregnant with a
second child, and still was not married»
Now, the respondent Andrews made application for a
teacher aide position in December of 19720

Her application

indicated that she was single and had no children, when in
fact she did have one minor child which was born out of wedlock»
A routine investigation into this individual’s
qualifications for employment revealed that she did in fact
have one child»
I want to emphasise to the Court that no one was
fired as a result of this policy, only not employed»
How, in February 1973, this suit was filed in the
United States District Court, not as a class action»
were held during March through May of ’73»

Hearings

The suit was filed

under 42 U.S.C. 1981, 1983, Title VI, and the Fifth and
Fourteenth Amendments»

And. of course we submit to the Court

that it is not. a Title VII case»

It’s never been pled, the

12
procedures were nob followed.
QUESTION: Did you say it was filed under Title VI?
MR. TERNEYs

They alleged in their complaint,, Mr.

Justice Rehnquist, that this was a violation of Title VI, and
as I understand Title VI —
QUESTIONS

I didnft think Title VI conferred a private

right of action.
MR. TERNEYs

It is the position of the respondents

that it does.
QUESTION:

Is that right?

MR. TERNEY?

Yes, sir.

Now, the district court, after exhaustive evidenti"
ary hearings,

found that the rule, policy had no rational

basis to the purpose for which it was made.

And in the

alternative, the court took a further step, and declared that
the policy created a discriminatory classification based upon
sex, and that the school district had the burden of showing a.
compelling state interest, and struck down the policy on both
grounds.
The court did not reach — the district court die not
reach the issues of race or privacy tier© were urged upon it
by the respondents.

An injunction was issued to the school

district compelling the school district to employ these
individuals.
On '

to the United States Court of Appeals. for

13

the Fifth Circuit, the Court of Appeals affirmed on traditional
equal protection grounds and found it unnecessary to decide on
any other issues, including the issue of sex always.
Now, it is our position that given the factual back"
ground in this particular case, that the rule has rational
basis for the purpose for which it was adopted? and we submit
«

to the Court that the purpose for which this rule was adopted
was to — an attempt by the School District to curb an alarming
rate of illegitimate births within the school population it­
self,,
The respondents say that there were other methods to
do tills, but we submit this was the only way that the School
District could handle this situation. There were other ways it
could be augmented, that could augment this policy.

But to —

as suggested by respondents, to give sex education is good, to
provide contraceptive devices is good, but for the School
District to give tacit approval to this status of parenthood
out of wedlock of children, that this — permitting that to
remain — as a policy of their School District permitting
these people to teach would undermine any other method that
they attempted to enact to curb this situation.
It is our position that an individual in that status
is an improper rola model.
Now, the expert testimony is to the effect that
teachers — and I think this Court is on record — that teachers

14

ar© in a very sensitive area in a classroom, where young minds
are molded and shaped for the future, where ideals are instilled
upon them, the mores of society? and there are some moral over­
tones involved»

We submit that this «—

QUESTION:

Mr. Terney, is there anything in the

record to shov? that the students knew that these two teachers
were mothers of illegitimate children?
MR. TERNEY:

Mr. Justice Stevens, there is nothing in

the record to reflect 'that.
We take the position there that the potential exists,
whether it in fact existed at that time, that the potential
knowledge exists.

And once that knowledge does exist, it may

not — the knowledge may not exist today, but it could exist
tomorrow? and in a small rural School District, that, where
people know their neighbors and know what their neighbors are
doing, and they know about their teachers and what -their
teachers are doing, that knowledge is readily obtainable in a
situation such as this.
And once that knowledge is obtained, that the effec­
tiveness of that teacher is completely destroyed.

If the

teacher admits that she does, he or she does, in fact, have a
child out of wedlock, then if the student has respected that
teacher, then we feel that the child loses some respect.
QUESTION:

Now, one. of the respondents her® answered

the question in the application in th© negative on the subject

15
of any illegitimate children®

Was any issue made in the litiga™

tion of the false answer,, having in mind that in a federal
application it is a felony to give a false answer to an applica­
tion for a federal position,,
MR® TERNEY ;

Mr® Chief Justice, it was only elicited

on cross-examination, her purpose — this was respondent
Andrews

her purpose in falsifying her application®

Her

only response was that she knew of the existence of this policy
and in order to get a job, she knew the only way she could get
a job was to falsify her application in this regard®
QUESTION; Well, did any of the judges dealing with
this, or did the School Board make an issue out of false
answers, as distinguished from the substantive aspects of the
case?
MR® TERNEY;

In the trial of this matter, it did not

go beyond that? no, sir®
I see that my time —
QUESTION";

Mr® Terney, I take it that the rule would

be effective even though the applicant married the father of
the child later?
MR® TERNEY;

Mr® Justice Blackmun, that's correct®

This, was much discussed in the lower courts®

The reason for

that is that once an individual, male or female, black or white,
has a child out of wedlock, that they fall into a status at
that, point of having an illegitimate child®

Regardless of a

16
change in circumstances, they still remain in that status„
QUESTION:

Do you have to defend that position here?

Is that an issue in this case?
MR» TERNEY:

No, sir»

We take tie position that —

Mr» Chief Justice, that we are regulating merely a status of
employment^ that we are not attempting to regulate present
moral status»
If tliere are no further questions, my time has
expired»

I would be happy to attempt to answer any other

questions that the Court may have»
QUESTION:

Well, did either of these respondents

marry the person who fathered ’their child?
MR» TERNEY:

Mr»

Justice Rehnquist, the record does

not reflect that they have? no, sir»
QUESTION: Wall, the one did marry later, did she not?
MR» TERNEY: There is one

Mr» Justice Blackmun,

the one that has married subsequent to the litigation —
QUESTION:
MR» TERNEY:
correct»

That's Mrs» Peacock»
it would be outside the record, that's

And, quite frankly, I don't know whether this would
*•

b© the father of the child or not»
Thank you»
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Now, your co-counsel is

reserving all of his time for rebuttal? is that correct?
MR» TERNEY:

That *s correct

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. McTEER;

Mr. Chief Justice # and may it pleas®

the Courts
In response to one point# I'd like to make this issue
exactly clear.
Katie Mae Andrews# who cams to me in 1973# is now
married# and she’s married to a young man# Mr. Lonzo Peacock.
As to the status of whether or not he was the father of the

But she’s a married

Your Honors# I'm going to describe to you in this
divided argument# the basic «*QUESTION?

Well# is that in this record now# Mr.

McTesr?
MR. McTEERi

Unfortunately# Your Honor# it is not

in this record at this time.
QUESTIONS

Well# then# you couldn't really expect

us to give it any weight or consideration here# would you?
MR. McTERRs

I would expect mere logic# Your Honor#

if the fact were to become known to the Court# to demand
basic —
QUESTIONS

Well# that isn't the way appellate review

18

is conducted, counse1®
MR. McTEER:

I understand,sir®

However, the fact is

evident»
I will discuss the basic irrationality of the rule,
sir, and at the same time set forth the rule’s racially
discriminatory aspects»

My co-counsel, Ms® Copelon, will set

forth tli© sex discriminatory aspects of the rule as well as
the standard of review <, and the basic privacy rights which we
claim have been deprived in this cause®
The rule precisely stated notes the fact that all
teachers, teacher aides, cafeteria workers, dietiticlans,
librarians, gym teachers, secretaries, principals, PTA
presidents, nurses, social workers, volunteer workers, and
perhaps

©van maids, janitors and school bus drivers, who have

aver bore car sired a child out of wedlock are forever barred
from employment at the Drew Municipal Separate School District®
The rule is solely the brainchild of George F® Pettey,
who enacted this rule without talking to any member of the
faculty, without talking to any principal, supervisor or
advisor, and made this rule solely upon his own action®

In

fact, the School Board did not even know of the rule’s enact­
ment until after this lawsuit had been filed®
The first times that many of our clients were aware of
the rule was after a,group of —
QUESTION;

But. the School Board did ultimately adopt

19
it, didn’t it., or ratified it?
MR. McTEER:

It did ratify it.

on the face of the record

There’s no evidence

there was mere approvals or whether

there was a majority vote, or a unanimous vote? just a simple
ratification.
QUESTIONS

Does that have any constitutional

significance, in your view?
MR. McTEERs

Only as to the basic rationality, Mr.

Justice Rehnquist, of the rule’s application, in view of the
fact that we are saying that the rul© is solely the creation of
Mr. Pettey.
QUESTIONs Well, if, in fact, the body charged with
administering the School District does ratify it, I don’t
se© how the fact that

you know, someone has to think of

every rule — the fact that a board member rather than the
Superintendent 'thought it up would bear on the rationality.
MR. McTEER:

This would bear on the rationality only

as to the concern, as I’m trying to point out here, sir, that
no other individuals were involved in the creation of the rule,
until after this lawsuit became evident.

No on© else, frankly,

knew about the rule until after this became evident.
Certainly the School Board did not know until after the suit
was filed.
During thres days of testimony, before the United
States District. Court in Greenville, Mississippi, and numerous

20
depositions which ware taken, these defendants attempted to set
forth some

basic rationality for the rule.

They claimed, in

essence, that the rule was necessary in order to maintain a
proper moral climate in the School District because, as Mr.
Petfeey testified, all unwed parents are simply immoral people.
As a second justification 'they claim that, the rule
was necessary to reduce school-girl pregnancies, because
somehow or another the mare presence of a school girl -- or,
excuse m®, ‘the mere presence of an unwad parent in the School
District would somehow or another increase school-girl
pregnancies.
And I might note for the record that although there
was reference to 28 school-girl pregnancies, there was no
reference whatsoever to any increase.

We don't know whether

or not the figures had increased over the past years or what?
we just know that there were 28 school-girl pregnancies at one
period of time.
In their most recent submission before this Court
last week, the defendants have set forth a- third justification?
that third justification being that an individual who was an
unwed parant gives the appearance, if you will, cf impropriety.
I trust we've come full circle now back to our
morality justification.

However, the question, decided before the courts
below, and the question-which is presented to this Court, is

21
whether or not. all unwed parents are moral lepers ? so infected
with irredeemable moral disease that they actually endanger
the moral development of children»
The trial courts and the Fifth Circuit? looking at
this basic concept? using its own language? noted that this
concept was patently absurd? mischievous? prejudicial? and
would only create stigma where it had never been evident
before»
The court found this rule to b© clearly irrational?
because? as a matter of fact? the morality is not the logical
consequence of unwed parenthood? arid? furthermore? all unwed
parents ar© simply not immoral»

But? more importantly? the

rule completely ignores such aspects of supposed immorality?
as pre-»marital sex? extra-marital sexy the rule doesn't concern
itself at all with the present moral worth of any individual?
their reputation or character»
QUESTION ;

Mr» McTeer? do you think that fch© States of

Mississippi could prohibit? by law? fornication or pre-marital
sex if it wanted to, and make it a crime?
MR» McTEER;

Yes? sir»

However? I do not believe that they can use such
criteria for the purpose of stigmatising individuals or
punishing them —
QUESTION; Well? surely? if you're charged in a
criminal court and convicted on a charge lik© that? you're

22

stigmatized, 1 would think»
MR» McTEERs

There's no individual in this Court,

none of 'these plaintiffs have been charged with any criminal
crime or violation»

These women have attempted to rear their

children, rather than kill them or abort them»

They have made

a basic decision —
QUESTIONs

Wall, why don't you address yourself to

my question?
Is your contention that some sort of proof was
lacking here, that these people in fact had sex out of wedlock?
Because if the State can make it a crime to do that, I don't
sea why the school can't says

If you in fact do it, you're not

fit 'bo teach»
MR» McTEERs

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in response to

your question, I'm trying to say here that these, individuals
cannot be stigmatized solely on the basis of having bore a
child out of wedlock»

If the sole purpose of the rule is to

reduce school-girl pregnancies, then where is the correlation
between unwed parenthood and an increase in school-girl
pregnancies?
QUESTION?

And yet you concede that if Mississippi

were to make it. a criminal offense to do that, and they were
proven to have done it by a. jury, they could go to jail»
MR» McTEERs

In fact, Mr» Rehnquist, the rule heres.

as evidenced from our co-counsel's statement —

23
QUESTIONS

Well, will you answer my question?

MR. McTEERs

I am answering ~ I'm trying to, sir»

I'm trying to®
Having sex out of wedlock is not a disqualification
of this rule»

It does not disqualify you from employment by

way of the rule's operation»
is what disqualifies you»
QUESTION;

Bearing a child out of wedlock

You can have *—

Do you concede they could, do you concede

that the employment barrier could be based on a conviction
for fornication if the State had such a law?
MR» McTEERs

To answer your question, Mr» Chief

Justice, there is no such law, to the best of my knowledge»
QUESTION;

Well, wo explore hypothetical propositions

here»
MR» McTEERs
QUESTION;

Yes, sir»
If there was a State law making it a

criminal act, could the conviction of a crime be a barrier to
employment by a School Board?
MR» McTEERs

In the absence of a showing, Your Honor,

•that that criminal act was directly correlated to either any
of the justified purposes of the rule, there would be no
basis for that conviction or otherwise evidence to be a
criterion of employment»
QUESTION;

You mean, then, a statute of the State

that no person shall be employed as a teacher or teacher aide

24

and whatever the other categories are,, where they are
exemplars to the students , if they have been convicted of a
criminal act in a judicial proceeding? that that would be an
unconstitutional statute?
MR, McTEER:

Well,» Your Honor, you're taking me

through the entire plethora of criminal acts that, could be
performed by a schoolteacher,

I’m talking about women who are

having children,
QUESTIONs Well, you’re not required to answer th©
hypothetical question,
MR, McTEER:

I’m just trying to test your argument,
To answer Your Honor, your hypothetical

question, I’m trying to say her© that the parent bears a child
out of

wedlock, or a woman or a man bears a child or sires a

child out of wedlock, that criterion of employment, even if it
led to a conviction of co-habitation or whatever under
Mississippi law, is not a justifiable criterion or rationally
related to any viable apparent goal of the School District,
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. McTeer, is there any statute

in Mississippi that makes the having of an illegitimate child
a crime?
MR, McTEER;

Your Honor, to the best of my knowledge,

there is no such statuta,
QUESTION;

Jusfc to rephrase Mr, Justice Rehnquisfe’s

question, do you think the STate could male© it a crime to bear
a child out of wedlock?

25

Isn't that the question he perhaps should have
asked you?
MR* McTEER:

Your Honor, —

QUESTION:

Without any inquiry at all into th€5

circumstances of the pregnancy,,
MRo McTEER:

Your Honor, I would think that that would

bear directly upon basic fundamental interests -this Court has
recognized as to the decision to bear, to begat a child,,
QUESTION: So you'd say the State could not make it
a crime to bear a child out of wedlock?
MR0 McTEER:

I would certainly mak© that statement ~

QUESTION s Without further -- without any other facts
than “that one fact?
MR0 McTEER:

That's correcto

Butr Your Honor, this becomes more evident when we
look at certain factual statements and background that is
evident in the Drew area.

And perhaps I can explain this a

little bit more clearly®
Thera were more black illegitimate children born in
Drew, Mississippi for a five-year period, from 1968 through
1971, than total white legitimate or illegitimate children
born in the same period®
is blacko

Eighty percent of this School District

The facts that I've submitted to you in the

Supplemental Brief cl@ar.ly indicated that in the period from
1968 through 1971, the number of black faculty members at the

26
Drew Municipal Separate School District, which was desegregated
by way of a court order 15 years after Brown vs. Board of
Education, has decreased from 75 percent at the Ac w. James
Elementary School to 36 percent„
The point, which is evident, is that this rule, by
its operation, Your Honors, can only affect blade people0
And the reason why it can only affect black people is because,
for ©very 47 -» 46 illegitimate children born in Draw,
Mississippi, only one is a white child; only one is a white
child»
This is a clear Gomillion case»

Gomillion

ve.

Light"

foot is clearly applicable here, because the State has created
a social policy rather than municipal boundaries, which can only
affect black people; and, as a consequence, only black people
will be affected by the rule’s operation»
QUESTION * Well, Gomillion was a Fifteenth Amendment

case»
MR» McTEER;

It certainly was, Your Honor»

QUESTION; And this — the Fifteenth Amendment isn’t
implicated here»
MR» McTEER;

No, it’s not, Your Honor, but I would

presume 'that basic concepts of constitutional law, as they
reflect upon racial discrimination, as concerns the creation
of racial classifications only affecting a particular racial
group would certainly be applicable.

27
The only individuals that have been stigmatised and
eliminated from employment

by this rule’s operation are five

black women, and although the defendants in this cause have
repeatedly mads reference to the supposed right of individuals
to bear children out of wedlock, I would like to state that it
was 1868 before black people in this country had the right to
bear children in wedlock»

Arid that is a clear consequence of

the enactment of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth and Fifteenth
Amendments»
I don’t have to say anything about Dred Scott»

It’s

clear in many placas throughout this country that, as Judge
Taney said in Dred Scott, clearly, black people had no rights
which a white man was bound to respect»
And so, as a consequence of this rule's operation,
the only individuals who will be clearly affected by the rule’s
operation are black people, it is an insurmountable, final
exclusion from employments

thou shalfc not work if thou hast

a child out of wedlock in Drew»
And there can be no more and no greater stigmatising
effect upon any person, particularly young black women, who
went to college -- he didn’t tall you that Katie Mae Andrews
Peacock had a collage degree? that she worked nights in a
factory in order to get it, and she had a child while she was
still in high school»

And it was four years later when the

rule was made evident to her»

28
If a black woman struggles through high school,
struggles through college, and then* at the moment when she
finally gets out of the circle of poverty is told that because
she hors a child out of wedlock four years ago sh© cannot have
a job, then, indeed, the Constitution is senseless to us0
And makes no possibility for any change.
Thank you, sir*

QUESTION?

Mr. McTeer, the National Education

Association and 'the government have both filed amicus briefs,
suggesting -that this petition be dismissed as improvidently
granted.

Does your client take a position on that question

ona way or the other?
MR. McTEERs

I will take the position, Your Honor,

tliat w© have briefed tills case thoroughly and throughout that,
indeed, we recognize the fact there is a possibility for some
right of action under Title IX,
However, there is no clear statement under Title IX
that there is a private cause of action.
Additionally, under Title VII, I might not© that at
one time we did try to creates this action to be a Title VII
action? but in. 1973, 'when the action was filed, the Title VII
amendments had just been put into effect, and to ba actually
honest about it, Your Honor, EEOC was not very sure as to
whether w© could continue with this

cause of action or

create a cause of action against the School District.

29
Furthermore, there was a length-of-time problem
involved in the enactment of Title VII and the period of time
it takes to get a-matter resolved,,
Also, Your Honor, the fact of the matter is that we
have here two federal —- excuse me, a Federal District Court and
a Court of Appeals, which ruled that the flagrant nature of
the violation here was so evident that the court granted
injunctive relief within four months after tee lawsuit was
filed a
And finally, Your Honor, I would like to make note of
the fact that in the Cohen case,

Mr„ Justice Stewart made it

absolutely clear that although in that particular factual
circumstance -- in footnote 8

» in that particular factual

circumstance it might be evident that all future cases would
be governed by Title VII, clearly as to these individual
plaintiffs, respondents, the Court could actually make a
rulingo
And so for all those reasons, we ask that the nature
of this flagrant constitutional violation b@ made ©vidento

MS» COPELQNs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the Courts
I will address myself her© to the fundamental rights
intruded upon by this rule, and also to the sex ©xcommunicatory
character of the rule.
Now, Mre Justice Rehnquist, as I understand your
question, you9re saying why can’t you use the unwed mother as
a symbol of some sexual conduct that is not appropriate her©
for school-girls —

My question was whether Mississippi could

it is clear that they could not

Moreover, fornication is not a crime

under the law of Mississippi»

You have to have co-habitation,

We would.also question, but it is not before this

It is an not-in-force

QUESTION? Do you think Mississippi could make

31
adultery a crime?
MS. COPE LON s

I don't ‘think under this Court's

decisions it could# Your Honor«, But I don't think that that
question is before this Court.
I also think that the School District cannot -QUESTIONS

Do I understand you correctly that —

did you just say that adultery no longer can be made a State
crime under this Court's decisions?
MS. COPELONs

Mr. Justice Blackmun# I'm saying that

under ‘this Court's decisions in Eisenstacit# in Roe.. in a number
of cases where the deterrence of premarital conduct is not a
purpose for punitive treatment# it is. not a useful way.

If we

look at the reality recognized by Mr. Justice Brennan in
Eisenstadt# by this Court in Griswold# these kinds of statutes
intrude deeply into personal freedom.
I don't think this Court has to decide that issue.
That is not the issue.

The issue in this case is whether a

woman can be ~**
QUESTIONS

Well# I guess you're not answering the

question# when you say that.
MS. COPELONs

I'm sorry# Your Honor.

The issue in this case is whether a woman can be
brought out. as a symbol of her# and only her# pre-marital
sexual conduct.

And we say that —

QUESTIONz

Well# doss this policy apply only to

32
women,, females, or does it apply to all —
MSe CGPELON;
that question»

Your Honor, I would like to address

Yes, it does apply only to females»

That there are two reasons —*
QUESTION;

You mean it applies only to females, or

its impact is greater on fema3.es?
MS. COPELONs The way the rule is defined, designed,
and implemented, it applies only to females.
females.

It is directed at

That is its purpose.
Now, let me try to explain,,

The reason we say you

cannot single out a woman, a parent of an unwed child, here a
woman, an unwed mother, as a symbol is for two reasons;
No. 1, you are intruding on fundamental human rijhts
recognized by this Court? the right not to b© forced to have
an abortion, which is one way of avoiding the rule and
maintaining your job, and the right not to be required to get
rid of your child, but to hold onto your child.
Another right recognized by this Court as fundamental.
Thirdly, the. way this rule is designed, the way it is
defined by Mr. Pettey, the way it is implemented and its impact
inevitably shows the sex discriminatory character of this
illegitimacy classification.
First, let me address
QUESTION;

Do you argue that this kind of conduct

has no impact on children if they are aware of it?

33
MS. COPELON:

Yes , Your Honor, and 'that -*» in fact,

that is also absolutely true.
to this rule.

There is no symbolic character

There is no impact on the schoolchildren.

There

r

is no knowledge demonstrated —
QUESTIONs

Of. the rule or a. violation of the rule?

MS. COPELON:
QUESTION:

Pardon me, Your Honor?

I was addressing my question to whether

conduct, pre-marital conduct of this kind by teachers, men or
women, if known in the community, would have no adverse impact
on children who are students in the primary and junior high
and high schools?
MS. COPELON:

Your Honor, No. 1, just to bring it

down to the facts in this case, there is no knowledge whatsoever
shown by the schoolchildren.

Beyond -that, there is no basis

to believe that schoolchildren, even if they knew, would do,
as the NEA said, "monkey see, monkey do".
QUESTION:

There was a good deal of expert testimony

in this case on both sides of that issue, was there not?
MS. COPELON:

Yes, there was, Mr. Justice Stewart.

I’d like to address myself first to the abortion
question, because I think that the petitioners here are raising
a straw person.

They’re saying we5re coming to this Court

and we’re saying you’ve got —>

you are espousing a right to

bear illegitimate children.
We're not ©spousing that here.

No one ©spoused it

34
in the schools in Drew# Mississippi„

The respondents didn't

espouse it®
What we’re saying is that this Court said in Roa#
that you can’t prevent a woman from having an abortion,, and
you can’t likewise compel her to have an abortion,,

This rule

if she has an abortion# sh® can

•they’re not investigating abortions? and they couldn’to

They

say that —
QUESTION: There is also another possibility# too#
isn't there?
MSB COPELON:

Yes# Your Honor# there is another

possibility# and that is# as fch© district court said# a woman
could take the more circumspect or conventional route and
surrender her children to others for upbringing®
Eo the other price of employment —
QUESTION:

No„

That she could not get pregnant®

[Laughter® 3
QUESTION:

That’ s a' possibility # isn51 it?

MSe COPELON;
Your Honor®

That is for certain a possibility#

On the other hand# it wasn’t a possibility for

these respondents;®

They didn’t know about contraception®

They didn't, have the counseling# as; Ms® Peacock herself said#
that white folks have# that tells them about how to not get
pregnant®

She didn’t want to get pregnant®

She said it’s a

35
hard thing to have an illegitimate child;, a child out of wed™
lock»
:

That option wasn’t open -there„ And the School
District is not helping that? though they say they8 re concerned
about school-girl pregnancies»
Your Honor? their rule has its impact in -terms of
coercion and in terms of burdening fundamental liberties»
Not only on the woman? but on the child»
and the mother are bound up»

Because the child

If the child is abandoned? the

child is estranged»
For a black child and for a black unwed mother? thar-s
aren't very many options about abandoning your child,, because
it is true abandonment»

There aren't many homes that will

take black children and adopt, them»

And so for the black

child? it is a life of parentlessness? that that mother would
be subjecting the child to»

And a life of institutions? and

a life of temporary shelters»
QUESTION:

Is this primarily an equal protection

clause claim? or — because the way you're arguing? it doesn't
sound like

it? and I wondered»
MS, COPELONt

It's dual? Your Honor»

It is that wa

say there are fundamental human rights directly infringed here
by the exclusion from employment.
And so there is due process liberty involved
QUESTION:

And then if you’re ~~ so if you're right?

36

the equal protectior: clause has nothing to do with this case?
MS. COPELQN;
QUESTIONS

Ho, Your Honor, it --

If you're right, you would prevail on

that basis.
MS. COPELQN;
QUESTIONs

We could prevail on that basis —

Without any reference to the equal

protection clause.
*

MS. COPELQN; W® could prevail as well on the gorunds
that tills is race discriminatory and, as I will get to in a
moment, that it’s sex discriminatory.
I would like to say, however, in terms of the due
process/equal protection contrast, this is not a cas© which
involves due process, conclusive presumption analysis.

Because

■that would import all of .the discrimination and all of the
deprivation that we're trying to prevent here, and it would
perpetuate that stigma, to say that, unwed parenthood or
motherhood was relevant at all.

So w© don't reach -that stage
j

of individualized determination in this
case.
i
QUESTION;

While I've interrupted you, may I ask

you, do you think it would be unconstitutional for this School
District to require that no teacher should be hired who

is

under eighteen years old?
MS. COPELQN;

Your Honor, I think that would present

a completely different question.
QUESTION;

No, equal protection-wise, I think it —

3?
I don't see the difference»

On the part of the equal protection

clauseo
MSo COPELON:

Well,, No, 1, age has never been given

quite the kind of constitutional scrutiny by this Court that
classifications based on race and classifications based on sex
and classifications based on illegitimacy
QUESTION:

Neither of which this purports to be.

Neither of which this purports to be,
MSo COPELON;
is Q Is it?

It purports not to be, but the question

And by looking at

if we — counsel used the

term "caught"# and. what we suggest to the Court is that there
wasn't very muchsearch to catch anyone h@re0

And that just

as focusing on nurturanca and on the woman who is rearing that
child invades the fundamental right to keep that child# so it
determines this rule to b© a sex-based classification,
QUESTION:

Ms, CopaIon. a minute ago you referred

to the scrutiny given by this Court in cases involving sex,
What scrutiny do you concede that to be?
MS, COPELON:
Justice Rehnquist,

I don’t think it's clear yet# Mr,

I 'think that it is certainly greater than

the scrutiny given to age classifications„

I think that Mr«

Justice Blacknmn’s words in Stanton clearly put the sex basis
•on a

a sex classification and require a heightened scrutiny.

We would -«* in a os© where it was required— urg© upon this
Court it should be given suspect status.

But we don't think#

38

with the constellation of fundamental rights and protected
interests that are involved here, that we need urge upon this
Court that sex be given suspect status in this case»
To look at the rule and why it’s sex-based, part of
it's common senses

unwed parent means, commonly, unwed mothere

The decisions of this Court, the cases that have cor®
before this Court illustrate that historically and legally it
means unwed mother*,

Peter Stanley has to come all the way

here to be recognised as a parent under the law of Illinoisa
?
Surato Gomez had to coma all the way here to have her father's
duty to support her be recognized,
And fundamentally, illegitimacy means legal fatherlessness«,

If the father legitimates the child, the child is

no longer, under law, illegitimate„
Mr„ Pettey meant it, too.

He tried to use the terra

"unwed parent”, it sounds better? but he couldn't stick to it.
He admitted at the hearing that his instruction to Ms, McCorkX®,
who implemented the policy, was -that she should exclude unwed
mothers.

He admitted at the hearing -he knew that something

more would have to be done to find unwed fathers, because
women were so obvious? but he didn't give her any instructions
to investigate unwed fathers.
And finally, she did not investigate th© on® male
in her employ.

Why?

Because she said he was married.

But

Mr, Pettey makes clear that marriage doesn't cure the disability.

39

Any pretense to neutrality is therefore removed by
the fact 'that this rule focuses on the nurturing parento

And it is —»
QUESTION:

Is it shown here* or claimed* that the

either of these teachers * any of the respondents * subsequently
married the father of the child?
MSo COPELONs

That's not in this --

Mr. Chief Justice* I don't know whether

Mso Peacock married the father of the child»
that's irrelevant.
QUESTION:

If

Fundamentally*

in terms of the —

Well* so tin® issu® isn't — so the

issue isn't here* then* as to what would happsn in that kind
of case?
MS. COPELONs This woman* M3. Peacock* or any other
woman who is married and has a child at home* certainly negates
any possibility to rationality of this rola modeling concept.
It could foe thirty years ago that a woman had a child out of
wedlock* and she could be married? but we don't consider that

40

that’s relevant»

We consider that illustrates the irrationality

of the role modeling concept that’s put forward her©»
Just as the idea that die tit.i clans would have some
role modeling capacity;, when what Mr» Pettey said at the
hearing was they handle food»
QUESTION; Well. w@ don’t have a dietitician here* w©
have just teachers, don’t we?
MR. COPELON;

That’s correct. Your Honor» And we

are not trying to litigat® this for dietiticians»

We are

simply saying that when you look at the way this rule developed,
and how it’s articulated, and you look at the justifications
placed on it, that the origin of the rol© and its scope has
a relevance to this Court's determination as to its
reationality to our clients„
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
MS. COPELONs

Your time has ~

May I have a moment. Your Honor, to

sum up?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

If you’ll make it brief,

yes.
MS. COPELONi

In sum, what we are saying her© is that

this rule violates an incredible constellation of fundamental
rights and interests recognised by this Court.
against blapk people only.

It discriminates

It discriminatas against women only.

It is a convenient pretext for exclusion from employment of
black woman, and women generally.

41
Moreover , it intrudes upon
QUESTION s

How many ~~ does the record show what

percentage of the teachers in the school system were Negro?
MSo COPELONs

In our Supplemental Brief, Mr» Justice

Stewart, we submitted figures which show

~

An increasing number of white people»

MSa COPELONs

-- a substantially increasing number

of white people, just in the period that this rule was adopted»
QUESTION;
not?

But still a majority of Negroes, is it

No?
MS» COPELON:

No, no.

It's a minority»

I think it's

25 percent now? from what was 75 parcent.*
The final thing that this rule does is it illustrates
the perversion of Roe vs * Wade, it illustrates -- this Court
has removed sanctions on premarital sex, it's rejected the idea
that contraception is going to stop that, it’s rejected the
idea that not having abortions is going to stop that? it's
rejected the idea that you can force a woman to bear an
illegitimate child in order to deter permarita! sex.
What we have here in an area, in a time when abortion
is available, is an inducement to abortion? and so, putting it
all together, it illustrates that the black woman, the minority
woman, the poor woman can very easily be the first victim of
the perversion of the notion of reproductive control»
QUESTION;

If ther© is an imbalance in the faculty

42
that violates constitutional principles as laid down by this
Court in Mr. Justice Black's opinion of some years ago, that
could be the subject of independent litigation, could it not?
MS. COPELONs

Yes, Your Honor, but what we're saying

under the Keyes opinion is •—
QUESTIONS

It’s not an issue in this case.

MS» COPELON:

No, but what we’r® saying is that that

context of whitening the faculty is something which has led
this Court to look at neutral rules as presenting a prima

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. ALLAIN, ESQ»,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR» ALLAIN;

Mr0 Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
I do not intend to burden the Court, probably, with
that much time, Your Honor; but we would like to say, and
address ourselves for a few moments to this document which —
and the statistics which have been introduced at this late date»
And say that the <?ourt really should not consider them, for
the simple reason there is no showing in the document, or no

43
Shewn statistics, any nexus between the rule which we now have
under question here and the increase of the whit© teacher ratio
in this School Districto
Other statistics would show that also there's a whit©
increase in the student body, which is not,of course, before
this Court,

And therefore we say to the Court that many

variables have entered into this particular thing, and one of
them is Title I money as being no longer available in the amount
they used to be for teachers and teacher aides 0

So we do not

think it adds anything to the case whatsoever, and should not
be used in any determination or decision,»
We would say to the Court, and we do not necessarily
know whether this is of any import, but Mississippi does have
statutes against fornication and adultery.

And also counsel

said that this rule did not apply as equally to males as it
did to females,
QUESTION; Then, I take it, you disagree flatly
with the last counsel as to the existence of a Mississippi
fornication statute.
MR. ALLAIN:

Yes, Your Honor, except maybe she was

talking about there is a fornication statute, it may not act
on one act of fornication, it may be co-habitationi that’s
where we may take issue, rather than there is a fornication
statute in Mississippi,
QUESTION;

I thank counsel would acknowledge that,

Would being the parent of an illegitimate

44
constitute a violation of that statute?
MRo ALLAINs

No, Your Honor, it I'/ould —

QUESTION? Clearly would not.
MR. ALLAINs

- probably have to take more proof

than that, maybe, to bring it about.
We say to the Court that we recognize and the Court
has recognized in several cases that .maybe there is a little
more difficulty in ferreting out, I think as the Chief Justice
said in one case, of the natural father.
But this Court is also on record by saying that mere
fact that sometimes it is more difficult to find the natural
father does not mean that 'the natural father
QUESTIONS

Hr. Attorney General, if you justify the

rule entierly on the basis of the role modal theory, how can
that possibly apply to a male?
MR. ALLAINs

It could apply to a male once it has

been established that a male is —
QUESTIONS

Established to the knowledge of the

students that the male was the parent of an illegitimate child?
right?
MR. ALLAINs
QUESTIONS

Well, that would be right, Your Honor,,
Is that very apt to happen, do you think?

MR. ALLAINs Well, Your Honor, we're talking really
her©, I guess, about not knowledge, but we're talking about
whether or not you're going to lie or not.

45
Nov;# if a male teacher is willing to tell the School
District# fSNo# I do not have an illegitimate child” or has
never been adjudicated so? but we’re not here talking in the
realm of determining when you have one of a knowledge# we're
talking about then whether someone desires to lie about it.
Mow# we do have in this particular case a falsifica­
tion of an application# and Mr. Chief Justice says anything
QUESTION:

But that wasn't the basis of the discharge#

was it?
MR. ALLAIN: That was not# Your Honor.

And I was

going to say the only reason that nothing probably was done
further on that particular issue was because we were in litiga­
tion and we did not. want to be seeming that we were punishing
someone who had sued the School District.

We’d get in

another# maybe another lawsuit about that.
QUESTION:

for dismissal of the father as well as of the mother.
