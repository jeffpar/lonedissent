MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear arguments

next in 68 Original # Commonwealth of Pennsylvania against the
State of New Jersey.
Mr*. Silver# you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE: SILVER# ESQ* #
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR*. SILVER*

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it please

the Courts —•
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE EURGERs

We hope you will bear in

mind that you have a narrow question to present here today#
merely on the question of leave to file a bill of complaints.
MR. SILVER*

We're aware of that# Your Honor.

But I think in order to fully understand fell® issues
relating to that# some explanation has to be mad® of the
underlying tax statute.

But I will be brief as to that.

In 1971# Pennsylvania •—
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

You mean the statute that

derives from Austin v. .New Hampshire?
MR. SILVER*

The statute similar to the one declared

unconstitutional in »MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER* Well# of course# we have
some familiarity with that.
MR. SILVER*

Of course.
. *•. ’«•

V.-

Pennsylvania# in 1971# passed a domestic income tax#

4
and, in response to that, New Jersey passed its commuter's tax,
known as the Transportation Benefits Tax Act*

It taxes both

Pennsylvania citizens who cross over to New Jersey and Mew
Jersey citizens who cross to Pennsylvania*

But immediately

exempts those persons, and in fact even does not require the
filing of a returnThe issue, therefore, is whether or not that statute

•

falls squarely within ’the holding in Austin, and v/e think it
does *
The issue before the Court, raised by New Jersey*s
motion in opposition, is whether Pennsylvania, as a State, has
standing to sue, first, for declaration that that statute is
unconstitutional, and injunctive relief which should follow*
And the second issue, whether or not it has standing
to seek the retroactive application of such determination, and
an accounting and repayment for the funds collected by New
Jersey*
QUESTION?

Your ease, then, is different from Main©

v* Massachusetts, in that in your case it hasn't been established
the New Jersey tax is unconstitutional?
MR,, SILVERj
We have two aspects*

There is no court declaration as to 'that*
We have a first hurdle to get over —

they already have the Austin case, which we don't*

In the

first instance, w© would ask the Court, first, to take juris­
diction to determine whether or not the statute is or is not

5
cons titutional.
1 might add that the issue

1 hop® to expior® the

issue, to be so clear as to really require a summary disposition
©f that matter by the Court®
QUESTION? Wellc what standing does Pennsylvania have
to challenge a New Jersey tax, insofar as it bears on
Pennsylvania citizens?

In Austin the challenge was by individual

taxpayer's claiming violation of privileges and immunities®
MR0 SILVER?

Mr® Justice Rehnquist, we assert several

issues ©f standing, as to our first count®
Tli© first issue, and I think the most important ©n@,
is that, perhaps with the exception of th© commerce clause,
what keeps th© nation together is the privileges and immunities
clause, and that it is our contention 'that Pennsylvania, as a
State, suffers a. trespass against it when its citizens5
privileges and immunities are violated®
The support for that proposition, first, I think, is
in Ward vs® Maryland,

Also, in footnote 5, Mr® Justice

Marshall*s opinion in Austin, where James Madison requested,
information, and what is to prevent the trespasses of one State
against another Stats?

Th® answer was the privileges arid

immunities clause®
That Pennsylvania has been independently harmed by
th© fact that there is a violation of the privileges and
immunities of its citizens

6
Mid I might add,- in support of this proposition? this
Court's opinion in Travis vs. Yale and Town® Manufacturing
Company $ there it was a corporation whose act was nothing more
than withholding the xaoney of its employees»

And this Court

permitted that corporation to assart the privileges and
immunities of its employees»

Now# Pennsylvania —• and I

would like to —
QUESTIONS

But it was acting as a withholder? and as

a conduit of the moneyf at least,, in the Yale
MR. SILVERS

&.

Towne case»

Yes ? but it did not allege that its

privileges and immunities were being violated? but that its
employees * privileges end immunities were violated? and their
standing to raise that was sustained by this Court.
Nov.?? I would add also? I think the answer is contained
in Mr. Justice Marshall's opinion? at 662? in which it is said
‘that the issue

that privileges «uni immunities? in terras of

maintaining the peace between the Statas? that the Constitution
seeks to establish? is such an important issue that it has the
high degree of judicial inquiry.
That is language that I believe to he the converse in
terms of the required level of standing.
Now? Pennsylvania also asserts its interest? £arens
patriae? to seek?to represent its citizens? stand in the shoes
of its citizens to seek a declaration that a statute of a
sister State is unconstitutional

7
QUESTIONS W@ll? can you do 'that in a case where the
other defendant is a State, under the Eleventh Amendment?
MR,, SILVER?

Oh, I think so, Your Honor, becaus© in

Pennsylvania vac West, Virginia, West Virginia passed a statute
which said that before you export natural gas to any other
Statei you must insure that the demands of West Virginia are
first satisfied»
Pennsylvania* by itself, as well as on behalf of its
citissens, parens patriae, together with Ohio, commenced original
actions in this Court seeking © deIcaration that the statute
was a violation of the commerce clause»

And this Court

permitted Pennsylvania, in that case, to seek © declaration
that a sister State statute was unconstitutional»
Now, the question that you raise, in addition to the
on© that I think I tried to answer, is the other aspect, and
that is the Eleventh. Amendment»

The Eleventh Amendment only

precludes, as 1 understand it, money judgments as against the
sister State, except in the areas
course, is Ex Part© Young»
QUESTION?

and the exception, of

But that only —*

But Ex Parte Young doesn't involve any

judgments of any kind ©gainst the Stata, «-»
MR* SlijvERj
QUESTION*

Ho, bliu “**•
— it involves judgment against State

officials»
MR» SILVER?

— it's an injunction»

But I would

8
assert that, first ©£ all, that th© Eleventh Amendment only
precludes suits -« does not preclude all suits against States,
but only suits by individuals against States®
QUESTIONS Well, but wouldn't it preclude a suit where
the State is really not suing in the classical boundary sense,
or water diversion sense, that instead really on behalf of its
own

citizens in a parens patria© capacity?
MR. SILVER?

Your Honor, I think that

first of all,

as I said, that Pennsylvania — that a trespass of th© privileges
and immunities clause as to its citizens is an independent and
separate trespass of Pennsylvania.

Which I think th© ..©pinion

in Austin supports that proposition.
QUESTIONs But it certainly doesn't say so.
MR. SILVER?
clear language®

No, not in — and I agree, not in that

But I think that the history of the privileges

and immunities clause, and tills Court's treatment of it, would
certainly support that proposition.
In addition, I don't think that when a State *»» the
Eleventh Amendment problem comes up in th© N®w Hampshir© case,
Now Hampshire vs, Louisiana, where the State is really not
acting in its sovereign capacity, but seeks an avoidance of
the Eleventh Amendment? and there cannot be an assertion that
Pennsylvania is trying to walk around the Eleventh Amendment
by son® act of an assignment of claims, bond claims, as there
was in New Hampshire vs® Louisiana.

9
QUESTIONs

But, nonetheless, it’s perfectly clear

that a group of citizens of Pennsylvania couldn't get together
and sue New Jersey in a federal court»
MR,, SILVER?
could not

For two reasons»

First of all, they

they may be able to sue an officer -QUESTION? Right*
MR„ SILVER?

But not the State of New Jersey»

—- and that’s an Eleventh Amendment

problem.
That resolves the Eleventh Amendment problem, Mr,
Justice Rehnquist, it does not resolve the problem created
for those people under 28 U»S,Co 1341, the Anti-Tasc Injunction
statute» which precludes a citizen from utilizing the federal
courts to enjoin a tax in federal courts, unless there's a
plain speedy remedy,
QUESTION? Well, but those are two reasons, then, why
citizens of Pennsylvania can't sue the State of New Jersey,
MR» SILVERt
QUESTION?

That’s correct»
And we certainly shouldn’t, under our

original jurisdiction, simply allow that to be circumvented
in a, kind of a dressed up original action her©,
MR» SILVER?

Your Honor, I do not think it’s a

dressed up original action in the sens© that 28 U»SaC» 1341
specifically limits its operation to the district courts,
implying, I think., the congressional intent that where there
is a dispute as between the States, that the State may clearly

10

go to this Court„

That to suggest that it’s an end run is

to assert the jurisdiction — to stand the jurisdiction of this *
Court on its head? and that this is -the perfectly proper place
to go because Pennsylvania, as I intend to demonstrate in the
argument^ has suffered an injury in addition to the injury
suffered by its citizens.
QUESTION?

Mr© Silver^ somewhere in your argument;

would you refer to Massachusetts v. Missouri?

This is heavily

relied upon by Mew Jersey? and not cited in your brief.
I want to b@ sure I know your answer to that one©

And

It doesn’t

'

hav© to be now? whenever you get to it.
MR, SILVER?

Okay,

I would assart also that I think that once the only
as to the merits o£ the case? in terms of the ~~ once the
Court, reaches the issue? New Jersey has conceded with one
exception that their statute is precisely similar to fehs
statute declared by this Court to be unconstitutional in
Austin? except with one aspect.

And that aspect is that the

use of the money is to go to transportation purposes©
Now? the -»« tills Court, in a long line of opinions?
has said there are really two aspects to any tax?

the first

aspect is the imposition? the second aspect is the use©

And

the Court has said that whatever the use is? if the us© is
improper? we would enjoin the use.

But an improper use will

not declare unconstitutional a proper tax? and likewise 1 would

11
assert the only assertion by New Jersey to distinguish their
act is one that is really irrelevant.
Going back to the issue of the original jurisdiction
of this Court in terms of the retroactive relief that we seek*
the Pennsylvania gave a tax credit to all ■— does give a tax
credit to all of its citizens who pay income tax to another
State,
I might add that every State which surrounds
Pennsylvania has a domestic income tax, with the exception of
New Jersey,
QUESTIONz This is a tax credit, not a —
MR, SILVER?
QUESTION t
MR, SILVER?

This is a tax credit, Your Honor,
Yes.
Now, we do provide for a tax credit as

to all States,
I think that Pennsylvania has, within its constitu­
tional powers,as was stated by Mr, Justice Marshall in Austin,
has the power to — and -the authority to grant such an
exemption *■»•- such a tax credit.
The fact that its tax credit also creates harm for it,
dees not preclude it from complaining for, cue, retroactive
relief, and a money judgment in this Court,
QUES TXONS
MR» SILVER:
QUESTION:

Mr, Silver,
Yes, Mr, Justice Powell?
Perhaps it had the power, but certainly

12
it was not required to grant the tax credit# was it?
MR,, SILVER?

No.

No# Year Honor# it is note

QUESTIONs So it was voluntary political action on,
the part of Pennsylvania.
MR» SILVER?
QUESTION?

That is correct.
And can a controversy within the meaning

of the Constitution# between States# arise by a State volun­
tarily, not under any constitutional compulsion# brings about
what you now call as a controversy?
MR,, SILVER?

I think so# Your Honor.

If a State has

the power to do something# it need not release that right and
power to accommodate the unconstitutional acts of the sister
State.
And if Pennsylvania has the right to act properly in
this way# and does act within its power# and by that *»>» by the
exercise of its proper power is harmed by the unconstitutional
'«

v.

acts of another State# I think that it does creata a controversy.
Pennsylvania need not accommodate or surrender its properrights to accommodate ilia mi constitutional acts of a sister
State.
Novi# the alternative that Pennsylvania could do **••»
Pennsylvania could say# could amend its statute and say# We
will give you a tax credit for every State except New Jersey#
because we think their statute is unconstitutional.

That’s

the very types of conduct that the privileges and immunities

13

clause was designed to prohibits

retaliatory

actions by one

State against another State,
And, in fact; I would even suggest there's a possibil­
ity that if we passed such a tax exemption, exempting only New
Jersey citizen*» *

Li*at Pennsylvania would also be in violation

of the privileges and immunities clause, if not of the equal
protection clause, by singling out New Jersey,

But until New

Jersey's statute is declared unconstitutional, Pennsylvania
has, of course, the right to give such a tax credit.? that it
may foe harmed as a consequence does give it the right to
complain in a court.
Now, th© reasons for the retroactive application ar©
set forth in our brief, but New Jersey was clearly on notice,
certainly at the time of th© passage of the Act, certainly at
the time of filing of the Austin case, and certainly at the time
of this Court’s issuing its Austin decision.

And it is a

constitutional tort feasor and should not be permitted to
maintain the benefit that it has achieved by reason of its
unconstitutional acts,
And therefore we would assert that it is not only
within th® power, but the proper power of this Court, to say
to New Jerseys

You have unconstitutionally collected a tax,

and you must not ««• may not be able to keep 'that tax,
To do otherwise would basically enpourage States to
coins so close to violating the privileges and immunities clause

14
that if they are wrong ? they get to keep the bounty? which? in
Pennsylvania's case at this point? is approximately $29 million»
I would s&y that? if I may
QUESTIONs
entitle''’,

Well? aren't the individual

taxpayers

to eat. into that bounty that they get back?
HR. SILVER:

Your Honor? they took a tax credit for

which — in Pennsylvania? for which they were relieved of tax
liability in Pennsylvania»
QUESTIONs Well? if they get their tax back from Maw
Jersey? isn’t that taxable income in Pennsylvania when they
gat it back?
MR» SILVER:

We would asser that it is — well? it

requires — whether it’s taxable income is not an easy question?
but w® would assert that it would require an amendment of the
prior return? because the prior return would show a tax credit»
QUESTION *

Well? maybe the statute of limitations

will have run by that time»
MR» SILVER:

We should hope not? Your Honor»

It's a

three-year —* I believe it’s a three-year statute of limitations»
QUESTION: Well? if Pennsylvania should succeed in its
efforts in this Court to got the money back? could New Jersey
plead the judgment of this Court, in an action by individual
taxpayers of Pennsylvania? seeking to recover moneys? as were
done by the individual taxpayers in Austin?
MR. SILVER:

I should think so? Your Honor*»

15
QUESTIONS Why?
MR» SILVERS Well, because — firr,t of all» the judgment
©£ tills Court, if we would get all of tit® relief that we request,
would first haw to determine Pennsylvania's prior right to the
tax moneysa
QUESTION % Right.
MR» SILVER?

And that judgment, therefor®, —

QUESTION* But than you ..want money, too, don't you?
MR» SILVER?

Certainly»

QUESTION? And you want money, not to go back to the
individuals who have paid the New Jersey tax, but you want
money to go into the coffers of the Pennsylvania State Treasury»
ME„ SILVER*

That is correct. Your Honor, because it

is the coffers of the Pennsylvania State Treasury which
effectively has been diverted to New Jersey»
QUESTION:

But, then why, when the individual tax­

payer comes and sues the Stata of New Jersey, and says your
tax is unconstitutional, and New Jersey says, Well, we've
already paid money into the general fund of Pennsylvania; why
shouldn’t he be able to answer and say, Pine, that's great for
the State of Pennsylvania, but this came out of my pocket and

1 got a right to get it back in my pocket?
MR® SILVER: Well, as I said, I think the judgment of
this Court would determine that. Pennsylvania has, since the
funds were diverted from it, and the judgment of this Court

16

would have to make that determination in order for us to he
successful# but that judgment could b© pleaded# that they do
— -the individual taxpayers do not have the right# following a
judgment of this Court»
QUESTIONS

How could w© foreclose individual tax­

payers who aren't, parties to this action?
MR» «tt.wpj

well# the notion of — I guess it’s the

notion of# I think# collateral estoppel# Your Honor.
QUESTIONs

Well# it's a rather unique version of

collateral estoppel.
QUESTIONg

I'm not sure it would be that# it might

be that they wouldn't state a cans© of action.
MR. SILVER?

That's right.

I'm sorry,

1 think you’re

right# it is not collateral estoppel.
But they have not stated — I think you’re right#
Mr. Justice White# and that is that they do not have -the right
to th@ money# and that this Court would determine that
Pennsylvania's right to —»
QUESTIONS

But your idea is that the money would never

and up in their pocket# it would either end up in New Jersey’s
erPennsylvania’s pocket.
MR, SILVER: That's right.
QUESTION:

They’ve got to pay the tax to on© or the

other j urisdiction»
MR. SILVER: That is oprrect.

That was the point of

17
Mr. Justice Blackraun’s dissent in Austin.
QUESTION z

Even though in Austin# the individual tax­

payers got the money hack.
MR. SILVERS

That remains to b© seen, Your Honor? X

am not sure that that did occur*
QUESTION?

X will allow —

In -any avent, even if you can't get the

money# you want to stay in court and have the law invalidated?
MR. SILVER:

Certainly.

We certainly want# first#

tli© prospective relief to enjoin the statute.

And I just might

add that if ‘diis Court would grant leave# at least as to what
I consider to h© the easier issue# as to the declaratory and
injunctive relief, w@ would file, then, a motion for preliminary
injunction to enjoin possible retroactive question after
January 1st of this year.

Because at that time again the

returns will start being filed for the tax year of 1974.
And in order to avoid a much more difficult collec­
tion problem than already exists# would file at that time a
motion for preliminary injunction.
Nowt I think the question# although I really have
not addressed it# Mr* Justic® Blackraun# in those terms, in your
request that I address myself to Massachi.taet.te vs. Missouri,
has really been answered in toe dialogue between Mr. Justice
Relinquish, Mr\ Justice Whit© and myself# in that the question
in Massachusetts vs. Missouri was the mutual exclusiveness of
the claims.

18
And what I think we have bean talking about is whether
or not the claims of the taxpayers and the claims of Pennsylvania
are mutually exclusive,
We claim that they are.

That one©

» that sine® the

moneys were diverted from the Treasury of Pennsylvania, and,as
a matter of fact, if the Court is going to have retroactive
relief in terms of the New Jersey — the Pennsylvania taxpayers,
just

administrative problem of returning it to 60,000

Pennsylvania taxpayers ©v€sr a period of three years, would be
much easier served than Pennsylvania’s additional attempt to
collect that money if the money went to the pocket from which
it was taken, and that is the Pennsylvania Treasury.
And that really what the issue involved in
Massachusetts vs. Missouri is an issue r@lnti.ng to mutual
exclusiveness, and what I think the Court’s decision in that
case was, that the issue between the States couldn’t be
resolved by this Court, because both courts could come up with
inconsistent judgments, those inconsistent judgments were not
necessarily mutually exclusive.
The only other question that is raised, I believe,
by New Jersey’s brief that 1 wish to deal with is the issue
as to whether or not this Court can give a money judgment? and
I think that it has, in 'the ease of Virginia vs. Wash Virginia,
which is not cited in our brief, at 238, 202? and has ordered
a judicial sell© for the purpose of satisfying a. possible

19

judgment in South Dakota vs» North Dakota, at 192, 286«
Also, X think the

there * s always the **- this Court

has always been troubled, X believe, over its ability to
execute judgments in original actions«

And I think that X

would refer to this Court's opinion in Griffin vs» Thompson,
which Mr« Justice Daniel said, at 43 U.S» 244, that 'there is
an inherent power in ©very court to exercise and execute upon
its judgments»
tod frankly, X think — he says; Without this power
courts would be wholly impotent and useless»
tod that this Court has the power under its original
jurisdiction to establish whatever necessary common law
requirements there are to effectuate a judgment»
And I think the assertion

that there is an inability

to effectuate this Court’s judgment is a red herring in the
case.

I -chink once we get — let’s get the judgment, I think,

and then worry about how to execute it.

X think that ©van —

there’s an argument that New Jersey's public officials; who
have to obey the Constitution and the laws of the United States,
would have to, under their oath, obey the judgment of this
Court.
I would reserve any remaining tine for rebuttal»
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs
Mr. Skiliman

Very well# Mr» Silver.

20
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN SKILLMAN, ESQC,
ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT
MR. SKILLMANt

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it pleas©

the Courts
This matter is before tit® Court on a motion for
leave to file art original action.

The sole issue properly before

the Court* therefore, is whether the Court has original juris­
diction over this matter.
It is the position of New Jersey, briefly stated,
that this matter does not lie within the original jurisdiction
of the Court because the State of Pennsylvania has no cause of
action against New Jersey.
Its-brief in support of the motion for leave to file
relies exclusively upon the equal protection clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment and Article IV, Section 2 of tiie
Constitution„
It is clear that these clauses afford protection only
to individuals «— in this case, individual taxpayers — and not
to States*
If anyone's rights under these clauses have been
violated, it is the Pennsylvania residents who have paid the
v

New Jersey commuter* benefits tax and not the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.
Nor may the Commonwealth pursue this matter on behalf

of its citizens as parens patriae.

21
!t5s been suggested by counsel for Pennsylvania that
if there has been soma type of violation of the constitutional
rights of the cifcisens of Pennsylvania, that there has therefore
bean a trespass of some sort upon the Commonwealth of
Pennsy Xvania.
Ho cases are cited for this proposition, and its
consequences would be rather breathtaking*

This Court has had

hundreds upon hundreds of interstate tax cases com© before it.
through the years, not only under th© privileges and immunities
clause but under th® equal protection clause, and of course
most frequently in the business context under the commerce
clause»
If this case comes within the original jurisdiction
of th® Court because there has been a violation of the constitu­
tional rights of the cifcisans of Pennsylvania and therefore a
trespass upon the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, it would be
difficult to see how all of the rest of the interstate tax
cases involving, not. just the privileges and immunities clause
but also the equal protection clause and commerce clause, would
not also corns within the Court's original jurisdiction*

And

greatly expand teat jurisdiction.
How, there also is a significant Eleventh Amendment
aspect to th© attempt by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to
bring this

.case as an original action, insofar as they seek a
4 i

judgment for money damages against the State of New Jersey,

22
It is clear that under the Eleventh Amendment the
individual Pennsylvania taxpayers could not bring suit in
*

federal district court for the collection of any retroactive
tax benefits0
It therefore should be equally.- clear that the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania cannot dress this matter up as
an original action and circumvent the bar of the Eleventh
Amendment and seek a money judgment against the State of Hew
Jersey o
Now, it was essentially for these reasons
QUESTION«

Your brother cited us a couple of cases

which he says «*•* cases of original jurisdiction in -this Court,
I think, on® in 238 U.S» and another at 192 U.S. — in which
fee says the Court has entered money judgments against the State,
But X suppose 'those w@r® not — the plaintiff in
that case was the State suing on its own behalf, and not on
behalf of its citizens»
MR, SKXLLMANt

Is that it?
That’s correcto

The main precedent on that particular point is th@
case of Virginia vs» West Virginia —
QUESTIONS

Right,

MR, SKILLMAN:

— where, at the time, the State of

West Virginia was established, there was an allocation between
the two States of the then existing bonded indebtedness of the
State of Virgini®

23

QUESTION* Yes.
MR*. SKILLMANs

Clearly a cause of action of the Stats

of Virginia# and the Court did recognise that a money judgment
might b® entered under those extraordinary circumstances»
Here# however# ~~
QUESTIONS

That's in 238 U0S„# is it?

Do you

remember?
MR» SKILLMANs

I believ© tliat that is the latter

of the i»*o cases# in 238»
QUESTIONS

YfiS0

MRo SKILLMANs
Th© other case is South Dakota vs»
[sicj
North Carolina case, where# I believe# over a sharp dissent#
South Dakota was permitted to take an assignment by way of
gift of the bonded indebtedness between certain of its
citizens and to® State of North Carolina [sic] and to sue
under that»
Again it was at the point that the completed gift was
made# it was —QUESTIONS

An obligation ~-

MR* SKILLMANs

an obligation between the State

and th© other State»
Here# on toe other hand# it’s clear that toe
obligation# if any# is an obligation that would run between
the taxpayers of toe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the
State of New Jersey

24
So that extraordinary form of relief is not available

her®»
QUESTIONS

Yes»

MR,, SKXLLMAN:

Hew Jersey relies very heavily* as

indicated in its brief* upon Mas s a ehus ©tts vs. Miss ouri* which
— where the Court found that the interstate tax conflict involved
there did not fall within its original jurisdiction»
The Court specifically held that no justiciable
controversy was presented by Massachusetts8 contention that
the Missouri taxing authorities had improperly refused to
exempt the assets of the estate of & Massachusetts' domiciliary
from the Missouri taxes»
h very similar situation to the on© we have her©*

where the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is claiming that*
notwithstanding the credit provisions of its own laws* that
the State of New Jersey should not have enacted a statute which
would bring 1thos© credit provisions into play»
QUESTION? But the underlying hypothesis* as I under­
stand it* in Massachusetts v. Missouri* was -chat each of the
States could tax the particular estate consistently with the
Constitution»

Her©, I take it* Pennsylvania takes the position

that New Jersey can’t* consistently with the Constitution*
impose this tax on citizens of Pennsylvania»
MR» SKXLLMAN:

Well* I don't think there's any question

under the Travis and Shaffer cases 'that two.States could impose

25
a tax upon the ear® income»

And 1 think that what the Court

was referring to there in terms of legal mutual exclusivity
was one where the Constitution bars double taxation.
Here we have no constitutional bar against double
taxation. Me have an argument that there may be a violation
of the privileges and immunities clause by virtue of the
imposition of Hew Jersey’s tax because of the particular tax
structure of Hew Jersey.

But no inherent or intrinsic

constitutional bar against double taxation.
And I think that that is the main responsa to that.
QUESTION?

You think Massachusetts v. Misscmri* then,

turned on the concept of the bar of double taxation, or the
claim that two States couldn’t tax the same estate?
V

MR. SKXLLMANs

I think partly on that, and also, X

think that the opinion also should be read partly as an attempt
to explain what the Court had held only a few months before i.n
Taxas vs. Florida, where they had entertained an original action
in a case involving five differant States seeking to tax the
estate of a single decedent.

And X think that the mutual

exclusivity also was meant to deal with that problem, and to
try and limit, the paramters of that rather unusual case, which
Justice Frankfurter* in dissenting, had expressed fear might
greatly expand the number of original actions being brought

QUESTIONS

But, nevertheless, the claim her® is that

the Constitution prevents Haw Jersey from imposing the tax in
this case?
MR, SKILLMANs

That is certainly Pennsylvania’s

claim, yes.
It is true and recognised that the constitutional
claims which Pennsylvania seeks to advance on behalf of its
citizens would, if sustained by this Court, result in an
increase in the tax revenues of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,,
But this would b® equally true in almost any case in which a
State taxation provision were declared invalid, because credits
and deductions for taxes paid to other taxing authorities are
so commonplace in the taxing schemes of all States that this
is a very — would be a very frequent consequence of any
declaration of unconstitutionality of a tax.
So, again, if this is a foundation for the Common­
wealth of Pennsylvania proceeding directly•against the State of
New Jersey, this same jurisdictional principle would extend t©
the great majority of interstate tax disputes that come before
the Court, that have coma before the Court through the years.

2?
and with a few unusual exceptions, Massachusetts vs« Missouri
and Texas ve a^Florida, have been brought by the individual
taxpayers, who claim that their individual constitutional rights:
had been violated.
How, while Pennsylvania's proposed complaint only
mentions the equal protection and privileges and immunities
clmuses, their supporting brief refers to the water diversion
and street cases, where the Court has fashioned what it has
called a federal common lew in its role as arbiter of interstate disputes.
How, the short answer to Pennsylvania's reliance
upon those cases, I think I've already given, and that is,
that neither Austin vs. Hew Hampshire nor any other State tax
case- with the possible exception of Texas vs. Florida, has
bean decided on that type of a basis *
However, if the Court were to conclude that these
casos were the appropriate jurisdictional framework for
resolving this matter- we would ask that the matter, on its
merits, also be treated as an interstate dispute, to be resolved
in accordance with principles of federal common law»

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN SKILL-MAN, ESQ®,
ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT - Resumed
MR» SKILLMANs

Mr® Chief Justice , and may it pleas®

the Courts
I would like to comment briefly, if I may, upon the
presentation and argument ©£ the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
I think that felt© most salient feature of that
presentation is that the Commonwealth relies upon the water
division, the street cases, and other cases in which the Court
hm fashioned a general federal common law in its role as
arbiter between the States in the federal system.
However, having established,as they conceive it, the
jurisdiction of the Court under these cases, they than abandon
them and on the merits, instead of relying upon principles
comparable to those in the water diversion cases, or asking
the Court to fashion principles similar to those in the water
division or street cases, on the merits they then turn around
and ask the Court to consider this acase as on® involving
denial of constitutional rights of individual taxpayers of
the Commonwealth®
The State of New Jersey would have no objection to

29
fch© Court; entertaining under its original jurisdiction this
matter under principles comparable to those that have been
fashioned in the water diversion or street cases *

I mean*» it

would require rewriting of a good, deal of constitutional
history,, sine© these cases have previously„ with one or two
exceptions, bean considered under the privileges and
immunities and equal protection and the commerce clauses
applicable to taxpayers<,
But New Jersey would have no objection to this area
of interstate tax dispute being reconsidered under those
principles and under the original jurisdiction of the Court»
QUESTIONS

You mean just kind of transfer all

disputes about th© author!fey of States to levy taxes on inter­
state commerce from other courts to this Court under its
original jurisdiction?
MR» SKILLMiVN s

At least to ihe extent that those

cases properly may be viewed as involving a fight between the
States as distinguished from essentially fights between tax­
payers t which again goes back to the various cases»
QUESTION?

Yes ? but if this can be viewed as a fight

between States*, what interstate commerce taxation problem
can't be?
MR» SKILLMMJs

I think 'that that is the problem that

the Commonwealth has in seeking to proceed in -chat fashion»
All w© are saying at this point is that we are asking them to

30

be consistent»

If they are asking the Court to entertain

original jurisdiction under th© analogy of these other eases*
then we would ask that the merits also be considered under 'the
analogy ©f those cases j arid we would urge that if the case
were so considered — and I*m stating this in the hypothetical,
really * Mr, Justice -» that if the case were so considered*
that th© State of New Jersey would have a very persuasive
case* and there8s a tremendous outflow of money from Hew Jersey
residente to th® Statas of New York and Pennsylvania* and a
very small inflow of money under th© statutes that are —*
under the statute that's involved'1 in this case and in Ilia
comparable statute that’s applicable to th© State of Hew York,
QUESTIONi Wellt than we presumably would have kind
of a —* not just Hew Jersey against Pennsylvania* but w©sd have
to join New York and Delaware and Maryland? so that everybody
could be heard from.
MR» SKXLLMAHg

There are no such taxes comparable to

those involved here applicable to Delaware and Maryland.
There is & comparable tax under a different tax statute
applicable to the State of Hew York.

So it would be a case .

involving certainly the States ©f Pennsylvania arid Hew York.

MR. SKILLMAN:

New Jersey has been striving for the

it would be highly speculative as to what the consequence of
that would be.

situation

and I don't want to go into the merits further

something that New Jersey conjured up in the middle of the

Before this tax was enacted, and it was enacted right

37
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE SILVER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. SILVER*

I do# Your Honor# just vary briefly.

I »» during th© luncheon recess

would like to

further amplify my answer to Mr. Justice Relinquish*s remark#
or questions to m®.
There is no doubt that New Jersey did consult with
Pennsylvania# and extended certain courtesies.

But I think

this Court should know that* first of all, thsir tax is almost
a mere image of ours.

In fact# to some of our embarrassment#

the same type typographical and grammatical errors

that

appear in our Act also appear in New Jersey’s Act.
1 think it5 s essential and important to know that

©very single time we have changed the rat© ~ which has only
been two times? initially it was 2.3 percent# New Jersey had it
at 2.3

when we changed it to 2# Now Jersey immediately

changed theirs to 2.
And that I think in answer to your question# Mr.
Justice Rehnquist# the target here has bean Pennsylvania and
not its citizens^

And truly in support of 'this position# I

would rely on Mr. Justice Blackmun’s dissenting opinion.
On® ©f the reasons# one might ask# iss why hasn’t a
citizen attacked it?

Because if h@ attacks the statute and is

successful# he pays the same amount of money to Pennsylvania.
By reason of what New Jersey has don©# in terms of retaliation.

33
And it is Pennsylvania’s Treasury that is being
harmed by -this statute, and perhaps —
QUESTIONS

Is it animus: against Pennsylvania as

a sovereign entity rather 'than just that it’s thers to collect
as much as much money as possible?
MR* SXLVERs

Well, Your Honor, this statute doss

not tax all non-residents, and that’s a point that I think
should b© emphasized.
This tax statute ssyss

The Commissioner of Trans­

portation shall select a border State, which is a critical
transportation problem; and tinder this statute they didn’t
pick Delaware or N©w York, they only picked Pennsylvania.
And tli© rat® is the exact same rats as Pennsylvania’s rate.
It is «« and it was enacted right after our tax was enacted.
So it is a raid by New Jersey — courtesy, I agree, but,
nonetheless, a raid upon the Treasury —
QUESTIONS
MR. SILVER?

A courteous one*

1

A-courteous raid# but, nonetheless, an

unconstitutional one.
And it is — and although we might have gotten into
intellectual discussions about parens patriae, ©fe cetera, the
primary argument which I had in my brief and relied on, 1
think perhaps a more academic argument, but I think it’s an
argument that is meritorious.

But I think the easier argument

is Pennsylvania is the real party harmed «»

statement, ther** has been effort, substantial efforts to get
New Jersey to pass an income tax.

And I concede that if they

tax their citizens the same way they are taxing our citizens,
w® would not have the seme constitutional underpinnings for
this argument.
It became abundantly clear in July# Mr. Justice
Brennan# that New Jersey was not going to pass an income tax#
and in August we filed our action.
And# Mr. Justice Rshnquist# if I just may say one
,more point# this is not a subtle attempt to utilize the
