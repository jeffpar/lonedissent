MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument next

in No. 75-382, Federal Energy Administration v„ Algonquin.
Mr. Solicitor General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. BORK:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
We are here on writ of certiorari to the Court of
Appeals of the District, of Columbia.

That court, with one judge

dissenting, reversed the District Court's determination that
section 232(b) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 empowers the
President in certain cases to use a system of license fees to
control or to adjust the imports of oil and other commodities
.into this country.
The reasoning of the majority of the panel was that
section 232(b) is a delegation by Congress to the President of
the power only to impose quotas but not to impose license fees.
Hence, the court upheld the. contention of the respondents that
the fees at issue here are without warrant in law.
Before coming to the merits of that discussion, I will
address briefly, as requested by the Court, the question of
whether these suits are barred by .the Anti-Injunction Act.
Neither we nor the respondents believe that they are so far,
Our position is simply that the Anti-Injunction Act

4
appli.es only with respect to taxes imposed by the Internal
Revenue Code of 1954 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1939,
and we think that both the text of the legislative history
support that view.
QUESTIONS

Has that defense been raised wnywhere

along the line?
MR. BORKs

It was discussed below, Mr. Justice

Blackmun, but it was —
QUESTION;

Certainly here there is no disagreement

about it that I —
MR. BOSK:

There is no disagreement about it, but we

were requested to discuss it by the Court.
The Anti-Tnjunction Act is in the 1954 Code and it is
contained in Chapter 76 of Subtitle F,

which — section 7851

of that Code, which is quoted at page 20, Footnote 13 of our
brief, our main brief, provides that Subtitle F, which includes
the Anti-Injunction Act, applies to any tax imposed by this
-title, and of course the fees at issue here are not isiposed by
that title.

Then it says, Subtitle F, does not apply to taxes

imposed under the 1939 Code, except as Subsections 3 and. C
provide, and Subsection C provides in fact that Chapter 76 of
Subtitle F applies to the '39 Code, and that carries with it
the Anti-Injunction Act.
So I think the clear implication is that the AntiInjunction Act applies outside the *54 Code only when

5

specifically made applicable, and it is specifically made ap­
plicable only to the 1939 Coda, hence we.think it is not ap­
plicable to the fees here which, whatever else they are, cer­
tainly are not taxes imposed by the 1954 Code or the 1939 Code.
The respondents have made additional arguments in
this direction in their brief and we accept one of them and
we prefer not to accept the other.

Their first argument is

that these fees are not taxes and hence do not fall under the
Anti-Injunction Rat.

That argument is in sorae tension with

their argument later on in the. brief that they are taxes and
cannot; bs delegated, but in any event we agree that they are
not taxes and don’t fall under the Anti-Injunction .Act, for
that reason.
The other argument is that the Anti-Injunction Act
would not apply to petitioner review PSA regulations in the
Court of Appeals, because the Court of Appeals jurisdiction
for the purpose is given by the FEA Act.

However, the repeal

of a statute and a policy so basic as that expressed in the
Anti-Injunction Act I think ought to be expressed, and there
is certainly no intimation of a desire to repeal the AntiInjunction Act in the PEA Act/ so I think that argument is in­
correct.

But the other two I think are correct, and support the

notion that there is no application of the Anti-Injunction Act
here.
With that, I would like to turn to the merits, if I

6

may,and discuss directly the President's power under section
232(b) to impose license fees for the importation of foreign
oil.

And perhaps 1 should say a word about why the President

shifted from the imposition of quotas to the use of license
fees.
Quotas had been used for some time in this field and
had been found rather unsatisfactory.
quite rigid.

For one thing, they are

They specify particular amounts.

And as demand

changes, domestic demand changes,, they provide much too much
protection for the domestic industry or much too little pro­
tection for domestic industry, and it becomes an administrative nightmare constantly adjusting the size of the qu^ta,
whereas a fee sets the margin of encouragement you wish to give
to the domestic industry, in this case for national security
purposes, and as domestic demand changes imports increase' or
decrease, but the margin remains there and you are given the
amount of protection you desire.
Well, section 232(b) states that the Secretary of the
Treasury must advise the President when he so finds that an
article is being imported in such quantities or under such cir­
cumstances as to threaten to impair the national security, and
the President, unless he disagrees, shall taka such action and
for such time as he deems necessary to adjust the imports of
such article and its derivatives so that such imports will not
threaten to impair the national security.

7
Here the finding was made by the Secretary of State
concerning oil and petroleum products,

l should state in

passing, perhaps, that this section of the statute has never
been used in its history for any com nodity other than oil.
Here the Secretary of the Treasury made that finding, the
President agreed and he placed license fees on the importation
of oil to lessen the amounts which were imported.
Now, I take it that the respondents do not challenge
the finding that there was a threat to national security and,
indeed, the language of the Court of Appeals suggests that
they agree that there was.

So all we are talking about is the

language of the statute.
Now, I read it.

The respondents In the Court of

Appeals read it as if it said "the President shall take such
action as he deems necessary to adjust imports, provided that
the only action he shall deem necessary is quotas.."
not what the statute says.

That is

If it were a quota statute only, it

would be quite easy to write it that way, many delegations of
power in this field are written as quotas.

This is deliberately

given very broad application, "such action as he deems necessary.
So the plain text of this statute supports the
President's power to use license fees, they are certainly with­
out doubt i:

of adjusting imports; they

used in

the history of this Republic since the beginning, monetary
exaction has been used from the beginning as a means of

8

adjusting imports.
Now, when we turn to the legislative history, we find
that it bears out that plain meaning of the statute rather
clearly, and I think no other conclusion is really possible,
• This national security provision appeared in its
present form in the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1955«
The Senate Committee on Finance had before it a number of pro­
posals to control imports of various kinds of products.

Oil

was certainly by no means the only kind of product that was
considered.

There was zinc and. lead and fluorspar and so

forth.
Now, one of these amendments that was before them was
by Senator Neely, which provided for a quota system on oils in
section 1 and provided for a. general power to take such action
with respect to any products as he thought necessary in section
2.

This was replaced, the Neely amendment was replaced by what

we have here, which was then the Byrd-Millin amendment.

Now,

that was a compromise of all of these various proposals, some
of them giving broad power, some of them requiring quotas, some
of them applying different products by name.

And the Byrd”

Millikia amendment was quite broad in this sense, and it simply
says that when there is a finding by the Director of the Office
of Defense Mobilization about effective imports on national
security being threatening» the President is given powers to
take such action as is deemed necessary.

So as to all products,

9
they adopted the second section of the Neely amendment as a
compromise in this Byrd-Milliken amendment, or adopted the same
form of approach.
Now*- the significance of that is, when you realise
that the Byrd-Milliken amendment in this respect is identical
to the approach of the Neely amendment, is that Senator Martin,
who was a cosponsor of Neely, said that during the hearings
that Neely gave the President the power to take such action as
is necessary, and that that included the power to impose import
quotas or to increase duties.
Now, by a common euclidean proposition, if the Neely
amendment gave that power and the Byrd-Milliken amendment is
the same as the Milliken amendment, then the Byrd-Milliken
amendment, which we have before us now in the form of 232(b),
gives that power to use monetary exactions.

But there is more

evidence.
In the floor debate, Senator Milliken stated that his
amendment gave the President the power not only to use quotas
but also to use tariffs and import taxes.

Senator Barkley, who

was a member of the Finance Committee, said the power is to use
cfuof-aa or to take such other seeps
desirable.

the President deemed

He clearly thought there was something other than

quotas that could be used.
Senator Bennett said the power deluded tariffs,
quotas and stockpiling.

Senator Byrd, in a colloquy with

10
Senator Saltonstall, which the Court of Appeals misinterpreted,
said the amendment "puts other commodities on th© same basis as
agricultural commodities" were already on.

Mow, Senator Byrd

had just been discussing with Senator Thye the President's
power under the Agricultural Adjustment. Act he uses duties as
well as quotas to affect the size of imports.
How, the respondents reply in their brief, as I
understand it, that in the discussion of the Agricultural
Adjustment Act, Senator Byrd referred to the use of quotas.
Mow, I don't know what to make of that, because the Act does
provide for the use of duties, use of monetary exactions, un­
less the respondents are suggesting that Senator Byrd didn't
understand the Agricultural Adjustment Act and therefore his
misunderstanding of that Act must be carried over. Into the
legislative history of this Act.

But there is really no basis

in the floor debate to say that Senator Byrd displayed a mis­
understanding of the Agricultural. Adjustment Act.

It is an odd

thing to attribute to him.
QUESTION:

The Agricultural Adjustment Act, as I

understand it, is explicit in authorising duties, is it not?
MR. BORIC:

That is quit® correct.

QUESTIONs

Unlike this statute.

MR. BORK:

Unlike this, that’s right.

That is why I

think it is interesting that he was saying we now put these on
the same basis as agricultural products.

11
QUESTION:

As I understood your argument, this Act is

much broader, that ,1s the powers of the President are much
broader, that he may do anything he deems necessary.
MR. BORK:

I don’t mean to claim that he may do any­

thing he may deem necessary.
QUESTION:

I think the meaning

The legislative history uses some such

language, does it not?
MR. BORK:

Well, steps he deems necessary, but I think.,

Mr. Chief Justice, that we are talking about an area in which
he way deem things necessary.
about customs and so forth.

After all, this is in Title 19,
Now, the respondents here have

suggested that ha can close filling stations or he can declare,
if you read it literally, he can declare dal ight saving time
to be year-round, or that he can repeal Internal Revenue acts
that apply to oil producers in this country, and so forth.

I

think all of that :«s — well, 1 understand the motivation for
that kind of liberal reading, but it just doesn’t square with
the -legislative history or with the purpose of this statute or
its placement in Title 1.9.

I think we are effectively talking

about the use of monetary exactions or quotas.
QUESTION:

But can you suggest any statutes giving

Executive power that are in any broader language than this, to
take such action as he deems necessary, and do we have other
statutes fche.it are broader than that?
MR. BORK:

Well, there is broader authority in

12
general under the Trading With the Enemy Act, which is discussed
at page 51 of our opening brief»
QUESTION:

That would come under the — generally

under the emergency type of statute and •—
MR. BORKs

Well, during time of war or declared

national emergency, which he can declare, I suppose, to exercise
plenary control over property, et cetera.

That is almost with­

out standards, whereas 1 think this statute does have standards,
it does have criteria.
QUESTIONS

That is to adjust the imports?

MR. BORK:

Well, yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, but in

subsection (c) there are a list of topics that the President
should consider in making the decision.
QUESTION:

Yes„

MR. BORK:

The Trading With the Enemy Act, as I under­

stand it, does not have that kind of guidances for the President
and in that sense it is a less confined delegation of power.
QUESTION:

Solicitor, to oversimplify, you say that

it is restricted to tariffs and these quotas, Congress could
easily have said that.
MR. BORK:

Oh, the Congress —

QUESTION;

The Congress preferred to use that broad

language, now what, do we do with that?
MR. BORK:

Well, I suggest, Mr. Justice Marshall, of

course they did mention the possibility of stockpiling, and

13
there may be other restrictive actions,

I didn"t — you see.,

the statute says, for example, when goods are imported in such
amounts or under such circumstances,
QUESTION :

Yes,

MR, BORK:

Mow, I suppose if it wasn’t a question of

amounts but a question of the circumstances, perhaps dumping is
occurring of foreign products in one part of the country, and
perhaps the President could use an anti-discrimination measure
against the

Marshall.

- if national security was affected —

QUESTION:

I thought you just limited it to abroad?

MR, BORIC:

I didn’t mean to do that, Mr, Justice

I meant to say that I think it is limited to things

the President does, acting on imports, rather than some domes­
tic action he might take, like repealing the income tax laws,
which would affect the level of imports, obviously, but I
think is an extravagant and amusing suggestion.

Mo, I didn't

mean to say that only tariffs and quotas# I think there are a
range of other restrictions that they were allowing him, as
long as they react on imports.
How, we have discussed in our brief the — Congressman
Cooper discussed this in the House# nothing to the contrary was
said in the debates.

The respondents keep stressing the fact

that they can find a man who, when talking about this, only
used the word “quota,”

They never find anybody who says it is

restricted to quotas, it is limited to quotas, there is no

14
power to Impose duties, -they just found a man that used the
word “quota,”

We have a number of examples in which it is

perfectly clear that people are talking about monetary exac­
tions as well as quotas.
Now, in 1958, the Office of Defense Mobilization submifcted a report to a subcommittee of the Hotise Ways and Means
Committee, which committee is in charge of this matter, and
that report explicitly stated that the legislative history of
this provision indicated the President was authorized to impose
new or increased tariff duties or quotas.

And after that re­

port was submitted, this very provision was reenacted in the
Trade Act of that year.
Now, it was again reenacted as section 232(b) this
time of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, where it is currently
located.

In 1970, tha House voted to amend that statute to

take away the President's power to impose duties, fees or
charges, and that amendment was deleted on the floor of the
Senate and was not enacted.

And finally, I think to cap it,

in 1973, the President used the fee power on oil that, this un­
successful 1970 amendment would have denied him,

And after the

exertion of that power under section 232(b), Congress went
ahead and reenacted it in the Trade Act of 1974, so it is — 1
find it almost incredible to think that Congress did not know
that it was enacting a power which on its face gave the power
to impose license fees and which they had been told involved

15
tariffs or duties or fees, which the President had exercised
before they reenacted it.

1 think there could hardly be a

clearer demonstration.
Now, the Court of Appeals suggested that this statute
should not be read broadly because, although it was written
broadly, that was all right because other statutes were written
narrowly.

1 think that is a very ode" mode of statutory con­

struction, to say that a broad statute must ba narrowed because
there are narrow statutes all around it.

I think the comparison

indicates that when they wrote a broad statute, they meant to
write a broad statute.
In any case, as I have just pointed out to you, Mr.
Chief Justice, there are other statutes that are broad.

Trading

With the Enemy Act is broader.
Now, at the end X want to come to two of respondents'
arguments.

I think they attempt to raise two arguments of

constitutional dimension which do not -— first of which they
suggest should affect the way in which we read the statute,
They don't suggest the statute is unconstitutional, but they
suggest we alter its meaning in order to avoid deciding whether
it is unconstitutional, and X think there are fatal defects in
that suggestion*
The suggestion is that this is an unconstitutional
delegation to the President of congressional power and, in
order to avoid that, we read it the way they want to read it.

16
The odd thing about that is that if it were too broad a delegation of legislative power, it is difficult to see why
respondents think that quotas remain valid, although fees
don't.

But they attempt to salvage that point by saying that

quotas are laid under the commerce power, while these license
fees are laid under the taxing power, and that for reasons
which are not disclosed and are certainly not obvious, the
tax delegation doctrine is much more stringent when applied to
a delegation of the taxing power,

1 don't think this is, by

the way, a delegation by the taxing power,

I think this is

the commerce power, and it is common to use monetary exactions
as modes of regulations under the commerce power.
necessary

It is not

— this isn't related to the taxing power.
Now, as I mentioned before, of course, when they are

arguing —
QUESTIONS

Mr. Solicitor General, what authority does

Congress rely on to levy an ordinary tariff?

Is it the power

to tax or the power of — the commerce power?
MR. BORE;

The ordinary tariff, I believe, Mr. Justice

Relinquish, is the power to tax, but they have used what could
be in common parlance called taxes under the commerce power, to
regulate in the past.
In any event, mien arguing, as I said, under the ~~
QUESTION:
or two or that.

Mr. Solicitor General, give me an example

I just don't have any in mind.

MR. BORIC:

commerce?

1 wish it hadn’t slipped my

mind because it is a, commerce case in the twenties or thirties,
I will try to think of it as I go along —
QUESTIONs

We would find that helpful.
i

MR. BORKs

— in which that point, was addressed, and

I
the Court said there is no reason you can’t use monetary' exac­
tions under the commarce power.
Here respondents are saying that although this thing
is not a tax under the Anti-Injunction Act, it is a tax when we
get to delegation doctrine, they have a concept, of tax which is
kind of accordian-like, and it collapses and unfolds according
to the current needs of the analysis.

1 don’t think it is a tax, but I don't think it
matters.

Worse than that, I think respondents’ argument is in­

consistent in terms of constitutional policy.

To look at their

brief, on page 34, Note 44, they give us the reason why delega­
tion doctrinis applies uare stringently when tares are involved,

18
and the reason turns out to be Chief Justice Marshall’s state­
ment. that the power to tax involves the power to destroy, and
therefore we have to control this thing much more carefully»
But then it is too bad they put it that way, because
on page 26, Mote 30, they are arguing a different point, and
there' they say that 232(b), this very statute, although it
gives no power to tax, which is too dangerous for the President
to have, it does give them the power to place a complete embargo
and destroy the commerce.
Mow, they say the power to destroy does not imply the
power to tax.

Nov?, so far as I can make out, the argument

runs something like this;

The President cannot have power to

tax because it involves the power to destroy, but he already
has the power to destroy, and that is why he can’t have the
power to tax.

Now, the dominant characteristic of that posi­

tion I think is kind of incoherence.
There is really no reason rooted in constitutional
policy why delegation doctrine should be applied more stringent­
ly to an import fee than to the power to embargo or set a
quota, and I suppose that is the reason that this Court held
in Hampton v. United States that, and held unanimously, that
there is no distinction.

It was their argument that the dele­

gation to the President to rai.se import duty was unconstituion:\1, although other kinds of delegation would not be.

And Mr.

Chief Justice Taft and a unanimous Court said there was no

19
distinction between delegations under the commerce power and
those under the power to levy taxes and fix custom duties.
In the second place, as I have mentioned, these
things are laid under the commerce power and not the power to
tax.
And finally I would suggest that there is no delega­
tion doctrine issue in this case, and the suggestion that we
avoid problem© of delegation doctrine by reading a statute
contrary to its intent and its language is therefore a device
that we need not resort to.
The delegation doctrine cases which struck down
statutes, the Panama Refining case and the Schacter Poultry
ease, even if we assume that they have not. been undercut, and
certainly a case like Southwestern Cable case suggest that
they have been shrunken at least in some dimension, but even if
we assume they have not been undercut and still stand as
perfectly good law, they are not applicable here.

One can

just compare the statutes.
In Panama Refining, section 9(c) of the National
Industrial Recovery Act gave the President completely unguided
discretion whether or not to make criminal the interstate ship­
ment of hot oil.

Unlike the statute before us now, Congress

provided no criteria whatever for 'whether or not he should
make it criminal, required nc findings as a predicate to his
action, anil declared no policy.

The. President was not only

20
unfettered;, he was completely, unguided.
Now, in Schecter Poultry, section 3 of the National
Industrial Recovery Act authorized -the President to impose
codes of fair competition on industries.
the statute„ the power

But whan you look at

was to regulate industry in all ways

altogether, it had nothing to do with coxapetitioh or fair com­
petition.

There was no policy guidance and, in fact, all that

Congress had done was hand to the President his commerce power
and left him to legislate at will.
Nothing of that sort has happened here, not remotely.
The Congress here provides criteria for the President, it pro­
vides criteria which are as definite as the subject matter
itself.

The facts, as I say, are listed in 232(c), and here,

unlike those cases, the Secretary of the Treasury is required
to make a study and a finding prior to the President's de­
cision.
Kow, I have discussed already the fact that the re­
spondents try to make this cases sound like Schecter by talking
about the various things the President might do, and I think I
have adequately suggested why the legislative history and the
placement of this statute confine it so that it is not anything
like Schecter.
1 have not time to discuss their final constitutional
argument, which is .the uniformity requirement as to duties.
'?ou will find substantive arguments as to that are included in

21
our brief»

I would suggest here only that the issue is really

not properly before the Court because it is not an alternative
means-, an alternative ground for sustaining the judgment below»
The judgment below really requires the District Court to hold
that no fees at all may be exacted»

This theory would support

a judgment which eliminated the exemptions from the fees which
introduced the uniformity* but we could exact fees»

So a dif­

ferent judgment would be required* and for that reason I think
that argument is not properly before the Court at this time»
In short* what we have here is an energy crisis that
endangers the national security* we have an energy crisis
which Congress foresaw and provided for quite deliberately and
repeatedly delegated to the President the power to cope with,
this threat by a limited means.

The President responded* and

1 suggest neither the Court of Appeals* reasoning nor the
arguments of the respondents here will stand analysis nor proi

vide any reason to take this delegated power away from the
President* and we ask that the judgment below be reversed.
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you* Mr. Solicitor

General.

01 AT. ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS X. BSILOTTI, ESQ» ,,
OK BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. BELLOTTI:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

22

In accordas.ce with the Court's instructions, we have
briefed the Anti-Injunction Act, and in order to prevent over­
lapping of our arguments we have separated.

Our plan was that

I would take ten minutes — I am not sure that we are going to
need that much time now, Mr. Chief Justice — to argue the
Anti-Injunction Act, and Mr. Dondis would address himself to
arguing that the President and the Federal Energy Administrator
lacked the authority t© impose the license fees on imported
petroleum.
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, why are we so con­

cerned about the Anti-Injunction Act here?
MR. BELLOTTI:

I do not know, ‘lour Honor, except that,

we were asked to brief it and argue it, and on the basis of the
request of this Court we have dona that and I have come down,
here to argue it, and I am not at all sure that that is an
essential argument at this point.
QUESTION: The Solicitor General at least agrees with
«
you and says there is no debate on that ary longer.
ME. BELLOTTI:.
QUESTION:

There is no

debate, Mr. Chief Justice—

It was the Court who asked the parties to

argue —
MR. BELLOTTI:

Yes, Your Honor, and the parties can­

not confer jurisdictions upon this Court, and I am not at all
sure — ■
QUESTION:

You are the wrong parson to whom my Brother

23
Biackmun should direct that question# aren’t you?
QUESTION ?

The answer is that some of the members of

the Court were concerned about it and wanted to hear it and it
is now being heard.
MR. BELLOTTI:
Mr. Chief Justice.

I will do whatever pleases the Court#

I will either sit down or argue the Anti-

Injunction Act.
| Laughter]
QUESTION:

I. know exactly how you feel.

I know ex­

actly how you feel.
QUESTION:

You may make your own election and if.

there'are any questions# it will prolong your argument on this
subject.
MR. BELLOTTI?

Thank you# Mr. Chief Justice.

I will

just take a few minutes.
I think very simply the license fees imposed here are

QUESTIONs

So if there were any difference with re-

spect to the rules about delegation with respect to taxes#
those rules wouldn’t apply here because this just isn’t a tax?

24
MB. BELLOTTX:

This is not a tax.

We never contend

that it is a tax, Mr. Justice, at any point in our argument.
To attempt to apply the Anti-Injunction Act to —
which is part of the Internal Revenue Code, Title 26 — to the
trade laws of these United States, would be anomalous.

The

vary purpose, and I suppose very simple purpose of the AntiInjunction Act is to make sure that we have a guarantee of
revenue to run our government.

That is totally outside the in­

tent of this Act with which we are dealing in these license
fees, which are regulatory in nature.
QUESTION;

General Bellotfci, what if an action were

brought to enjoin the enforcement of tariffs enacted by
Congress, would that be subject to the Anti-Injunction Act?
MR. BELLOTTXs

I would say that it would not, Mr.

Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

Even though levied under — even though

Congress was exercising its taxing power?
MS. BELLOTTX:

The Anti~Injunction Act applies, in my

judgment, very simply to taxes imposed under the Internal
Revenue Code, Title 26, and no others.
Congress was not directly involved in the imposition
of these fees.

It was not for the purpose of raising revenue,

in spite of the fact that it raised probably the most massive
amounts of revenues, more than any other tariff power in the
United States.

In IS74, the year before this, all of the

25
commodities that were entered into this country amounted to
$4.3 billion.

If this program, this license fee program had

reached its ultimate conclusion, it would have anticipated
$4.8 billion.

However, the Court has said that: — has defined

a tan as that which is in a condition to be collected as a tax
and claimed by the proper official to be a tax.
fee scheme fails on both of these counts.

The license

It is not collected

by an Internal Revenue officer under the color of his office,
it is not deposited in the general funds of the Treasury, it
is collected by the Federal Energy Administrator and deposited
in a suspense account and may, without appropriation be used
for refunds and payments incident to the implementation, of the
lienese fee program.
X am not sure, Mr. Chief Justice and Justices, how
much longer we want to go into any formal presentation of the
Anti-Injunction Act.

I think, very simply, it does not apply

t© taxes outside the Internal Revenue Code and obviously the
very purpose of tine Act, to perpetuate and to make sure the
security of revenue does not apply at all here.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGSRs

If we don’t have any

questions, Mr. Attorney General, you may either argue the
other points or you may delegate and assign that time to your
colleague.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD B. DONDIS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
X®. DONDIS:

Thank you, Your Honor.

May it please

the Court:
The license fee now before the Court involves the
broadest exercise of the tariff power in the history of the
American Republic.

In fact, ve would have to go back to

George Ill's stamp tax to determine as broad an executive
power as is claimed in this case.
The statute is a simple one.
the tariff on its face.

It does not mention

It states that the President can take

such action and for such time as he deems necessary to adjust
the imports of an article, and so forth, so that it won't
threaten to impair the national security.

I will get back to

the exact wording and the exact meaning of that statute.

But

I would like to emphasize our position that the Court should
give this a vary narrow and careful construction because in
effect the statute under the interpretation of the government
undermines the. whole tariff structure of the United States.
QUESTION:

What do you say was the objective of

Congress in this particular section, Mr. Dondis?
MR. DONDISs

It was to put on a quota, Your Honor.

If -was written in the background of completa discussion of the

21
quota problem.

It was put in essentially for the oil companies

who were worried about competition abroad.
QUESTION:

Well* to adjust and regulate imports,

isn't that the objective?
MR. DONDISs

Yes, but 1 will explain just what it

adjusts, but X don't, want to just plunge into that problem.
would like to give you a little bit of a background.
tainly want to answer your questions directly.

I

X cer­

X would like

to — X will say though that the first measures under this
statute was a voluntary quota program.

The Senate and Congress

as a whole overwhelmingly discussed it as a quota program, and
it was designed to protect the oil companies substantially
because they had a great many imports which were threatening
prices in America.

However, it was extended to allarticles.

Now, I think you should understand that since the
statute does not mention tax at all, that once it is construed
to include a tax, there is no limit on it, and that is —
QUESTXON:
MR. DONDIS:

Is that your position, that this is a tax?
This is a license fee. Your Honor, which

has a reach that reaches farther, r:uch broader than tax, and
1 will explain why it does.
QUESTION?
MR. DONDISs

But it isn't a tax, though?
1 have to accept the nomenclature of

the government that it is a license tax, but it has all the
instance of a tariff and something more.

28
QUESTION2
here,

Well, then, I have to change my notes

I have the Attorney General as saying it was not a tax.
MR. DONDISs
QUESTION:
MR. DONDIS:

It is ~
Do I have to change ray notes?
Yes.

I will explain what it is.

It is

a very minor point, but let me try to explain it now.
QUESTION:

If it is a tax, you may find yourself

under the Anti-Injunction Act, and that is —
MR. DONDIS:

No, I don't think you would. Your Honor,

because I don’t like to argue that question but there is a
clear right of appeal under the Federal Energy Act, in any
event.

I don't have that problem.
The reason why I think I had better answer that ques­

tion — the reason why it really has a sweep far broader than
a tax is that, the monies are paid in a fund.

They are all

monies exacted on imports, so in that sense it is certainly a
tariff and hence all the incidence and the economic effect of
a tariff.

But the monies are paid into a fund and the govern-

moot allows; exemptions based upon various parts of the country,
so that certain parts of the country, because of these exemp­
tions, don1t pay as high a license fee as others,

The result

is that the imposition is not uniform and it is in violation of
the uniformity clause of the Constitution.
Now, I believe — and I can only speculate — that the
government set. this up as a license fee system in order to avoid

29
that problem.
QUESTION;

Mr. Rondis, did you make this argument in

the lower court.?
MR. DONDISs
QUESTION5

Yes.
And the Court of Appeals did not pass on

this „ did they?
MR. DONDIS:
ized it.

Ho, I don!t think they finally character­

I think they accepted it —
QUESTION s

What is your response to the Solicitor

General’s argument that we may not consider it because it would
not sustain the judgment before us?
MR. DONDIS 3
QUESTION:
MR. DONDIS;

On the uniformity provisions'?
Yes.
Oh, wall, I simply say that the govern­

ment has chosen the form of the system, and I am personally
convinced that it was chosen to get around the Uniformity Act.
Now, we- couldr, * t appeal from the tariff because that is what
the government didn’t have.

It had what they call a license

fee system which is very comparable to that vhich was invali­
dated by this Court in the CATV and NEPCO eases.

All I can say

is we can only appeal from what they give us.
QUESTIONs

I may not understand your argument.

Is

your non-uniformity argument one that is intended to demon­
strate that iv is not a tariff because it is not uniform —
MR. DONDIS;

Ho, no.

30
QUESTION:

— or is it one that is intended to demon­

strate that the relief should be to eliminate the lack of uni­
formity?
MR. DO'MDIS%

No, it is one to demonstrate that this

statute should be vary carefully and narrowly construed, and if
there is a constitutional question, then the tariff should be
construed —~
QUESTIONS

Well, there is no constitutional question

MR. DONDISs

at all.
QUESTIONS

There is no constitutional question derived

from the non-uniformity point unless we decide it is a tariff.
MR.. DONDISs

Wall, I would think it would apply in

the case of a license fee system.
QUESTIONs

What in the Constitution requires s-

license fee system to bo uniform?
MR. DONDISs

Because if a license fee has all the

affects of a tariff. Your Honor, I think it. would have to be
uniform*
v

QUESTION?

Well, for example, could the President say

we will have r.o imports at all through the West Coast, say, or
the East Coast, one or the other, just close up certain ports
to the import of oil, could that be done?
MR, DONDISs

I think he could do that subject to the

31
restrictions of the due process clause.

Now, obviously he

would kill a lot of people if he did that.

I think the due

process clause takes over at some point.
QUESTION:

Do you "flake the due process argument here?
No, we are not raising the constitution-'

MR. DONDIS s
a! question.
QUESTION;

I am trying to understand the thrust of

your non-uniformity argument, and I really don't have it yet.
MR. DONDXS5

Well, I can only say we are bringing

before the Court a question of the interpretation of the statute:
and we say the statute must be interpreted narrowly.
QUESTION;

Must it be interpreted to require uniform

treatment of all parts of the country if there were, for
example, quotas —
MR. DONDXS:

Yes, in the program it only provides the

uniform treatment, and this is not what the government has done.
I don’t think the government should profit on what it has done.
QUESTION8

So if they have quotas administered by

different ports of the country, they would have to be uniform
at every port, you say?
MR. DONDXS:

Yes, X think they could do that.

haven’t set up such a system.

They

But one aspect of the program is

that it has an unlimited tax, there is no limit in the statute
itself, and as a result it has become the highest tariff in
history and the tariff on oil is many times the very high

32
tariff wall established by the Smoofc-Hawley Act*
Now, another aspect of it is that the government used
this statute fco abolish a tariff, and this was invalidated by
the Court of Appeals*

So the government apparently claims that

it includes the right to abolish a tariff and, mind you, this
applies to the entire all articles that can come into the
United States.

The government apparently asserts that power,

provided it makes a finding in the national security.
QUESTIONs

Well, that makes quite a difference, does

it not?
MR, OGNDIS%
QUESTION;
MR. DONDISs

Pardon?
That makes some difference then?
Yes, but how much difference, Your Honor?

The government claimed below — and it is very hard to dispute
— that the national security is not something that can be re­
viewed in this Court.

The government claimed below that it had

to provide no hearings on the question and, as a matter of fact,
in those days of total war, it is doubtful that there are any
commodities that would not be within this clause.

But if you

look under the Trading With the Enemy Act, for example, in the
commerce, they have a list of commodities.

They have almost

every conceivable commodity affecting the public interest.
QUESTION:

What hurt your client the most, an embargo

or this license fee?
MR. DONDISs

The license fee is a devastating — we

just wonder if you want a narrow con­

struction, whether you ought to construe it narrowly to exclude

HR. DONDIS:
QUESTION:
MR. DONDISs

Ho.
or narrowly to exclude license fees?
There is no way, because the word

"restrict" clearly implies., quotas, and because the statutory
history agaixi and again refers to quotas.

There is no doubt

that this was enacted under & background of quotas, no doubt.
But I suggest that one parconic power does not imply another.
And I also suggest to Yours Honors that you have never implied
a tax, never in the history of this Court from language which
does not explicitly provida for tax, and here there is no such
language, there is no language that mentions a measure of tax
nor a method of calculation of tax.

There is no such thing.

34
QUESTION s

But

afore we can combat: that argument ,

we have to find that this is actually a tax?
MR. DONDIS:
QUESTION:

What9s that?
Before we can buy that argument, we have

to agree with you that it is a tax?
MR. DONDIS:

No, I don’t think so.

I think the two

of them, whether it a license fee or a tariff, they are equally
lethal.
QUESTION:

Well, if we find that this is not a tax,

what good is your present argument?
MR. DONDIS:

I think it is inviolative of the tariff

clause and it is not within the power granted to Congress.
QUESTION %

Bo you say the Congress couldn’t have

done this?
MR. DONDIS:

I'm sorry, the power granted by Congress

I would like to point out that if the President has this power,
ha does not have to use the elaborate mechanism of Title 19 of
the U.S. Code, which involves the — which involves all the
technical requirements of tariffs, and if very importantly in­
volves the recommendation of the International Trade Commission
which is a basic body for governing tariffs.
In other words, if you take all the powers taken to­
gether under this statute as claimed by the government, that
is, on a limited tariff, and add the power to abolish a tariff
on almost any article there is in foreign commerce, in our view,

for one thing, the very existence

of the tariff creates vested interests throughout the country.
This immediately —* for example, this tariff hurt the East
very greatly.

It probably created vested interests in the

very loathe to override a veto.

So I think once Congress gives

up the power, I doubt that it can get it back so easily, unless
it Makes some mammouth kind of deal with the President.

But it

certainly was unable to get this back, even though a majority
of Congress and the House disapproved of it.

This is why X am

would be a precedent if it does so, and X would —

MR. DONDIS:

That is quite easy.

There are two

First, the government abolished the tariff and it

also had put exemptions on the fees, so the tariff wasn't even
being felt by that time.

The Circuit Court mentioned that.

Also, Congress in *74 mentioned specifically that it hadn't
gotten to the problem of the oil tariff.
What is mors important, Your Honor, is the 1962
statute.

Look at that.

That specifically gave the govern­

ment the power which the government now claims today.

It

specifically gave a tariff and for security reasons, and that
was rejected in 1962, and Senator Byrd gave a very complete
analysis of that of the reasons why it was rejected.

That is

a far more important indication, because during the sixties,

38
and in *58, the protectionists tried to add the tariff power
to this section mid were unable to, and only in 1970, whan,
for the first time after fifteen years, the President's Task
Force reported that perhaps a tariff could be put on, did
Congress start to attempt legislation the other way.

It

abandoned 970 legislation because President Nixon promised
not to put one on*

It was not until ”73 that he put a mild

one on, and the bite of it, as the Circuit Court said, the

think that is utterly expansive power.

1 don't

The government takes

a different position than the Solicitor General has taken
here«
The term "such action as he deems necessary" is very
common words in statutes, and they don’t.mean that they expand
power, the basic power given in the statute.

All they mean is

that the President or the official can take such measures as
he- deems necessary in order to use the basic powers.

For

example, the. Federal Power Act has a separata section which
says the Commission shall have power to perform any and all

40

acts necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of
this Act.
And in. the MSPCO case? with Your Honors9 unanimous
decision? you validated the license, that general power was
present, and the Circuit Court said that that did not expand
the powers.
Now? the government takes the broadest possible —
let me see, I need the government's brief — they take the
broadest possible position.

They say, '’The President's range

of choice with respect, to the collective actions that he
may take under the provision is subject to only one limitation.
The President must deem the action to be necessary to accomp­
lish the proscribed objective adjusting the imports of the
article, to eliminate the threat, to the national security.
The statute does not otherwise limit in any way the nature of
the action that the President may take.”
Now, the- Solicitor General seems to have backed down
from that position, because obviously he must.

For example,

the President would not be allowed to use subsidies to adjust
imports.

He certainly couldn't, put on a depletion allowance.

Under this -~
QUESTION?

Do we have to decide any more here than

whether he has exercised here, the power is valid?
MR. DGNDIS:

I think you have to decide ~- well, what

1 aia trying to say, Your Honor, is that this general clause

41
doesn't mean much? "such action as he deems necessary."

The

Solicitor General admits that that just cannot be true* other­
wise the President could occupy Saudi Arabia for that, purpose.
And the important part of the statute is the word "adjust.”
And the statute says the President can take such action as he
deems necessary to adjust the imports of an article.

Mow*

that word "adjust68 is a very specific word used, throughout the
Code,, and I have looked high and low in the Code and X can
find no reference* no use of the word "adjust” that means an
indirect adjustment of the type that, the government contends
for.

It usually means a kind of a manual, exact and precise

change.

As a matter of fact, the court below said it meant

withdrawal of goods from the warehouse.
Now, the government has produced no statute which
the term "adjust" refers to an indirect uncertain amount of
change in imports, end I don't third: that is what it mranc.
QUESTIONs

Well, isn't it change in imports, even

!

though it is indirect, and nevertheless an adjustment in im­
ports?
/

MR. DONDXS:

I think it is a change, but X don't call

it an adjustment because "adjust" is a verb and X think it
implies something definite and certain.

this case, on the first tier, the first tier imports, the
President didn't indicate whether they would change imports at

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Solicitor General?
ORAL ARGUMENT* OF ROBERT H. BORK, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL
MR. BORK:

Just a few matters, Mr. Chief Justice.

I

would like, to point out in the first place that the tariff on
oil is in effect in this case involves in no way the assertion
of a power to remove any tariff.

The tariff laws are not at

stake in this case.
Secondly, in reply to a question from Mr, Justice
Powell, we discussed the 1962 unsuccessful amendment to amend
\this law, which would have given the President explicit power
to lay duties and impose quotas.

The reason that was not.

passed is it was not like this statute.

In the first, place,

it was not a national security statuta.

The President was

empowered to do anything when the national interest was in­
volved, a much broader statute and, furthermore, there were no
criteria in the statute for when he should do any of these
things.

If there was a statute like Schechter, like the NIRA,

in any sense, it was that statute and that was why it was re­
jected by the Congress.
QUESTIONt

Mr. Solicitor General, what ~ you probably

have said in your brief ox- in argument and I probably missed
it — what do you think was the basic purpose of these fees?
MR, BORKi

The fees, Mr. Justice White, was to have a

method of providing cutting down foreign imporfcsa and develop­
ing American production, which would provide a known margin.
QUESTION:

Twin purposes?

Certainly, whatever impact

it might have had to limit imports, that was part of the purpose,
J.

taka it?

45
MR. BORK:

It was to limit imports and decrease

American dependence for national security reasons on foreign
oil.
QUESTION:

And so they wanted to raise the price an'3

encourage domestic production, among other things?
MR. BORK:

That is correct, that is one of the pur­

poses, to achieve something of enough independence so that,
for .national security purposes, the Nation wouldn't be abso­
lutely dependent upon foreign oil.
But, Mr. Justice Stevens, I was asked about the
question of.whether whatever uses monetary exaction, regulation
of the commerce power, we were not — I was not sufficiently
prepared for that, but apparently the answer is rather —•
Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois v. United
States, 289 U.S. 48, this case lays that doctrine that because
the taxing power is a distinct power, it does not follow the
duties, may not be imposed in the exercise of the power to
regulate commerce, the contrary is well established, Gibbens v.
Ogden.
That is all I have, Mr. Chief Justice.
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you, gentlemen.
