ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. EVANS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. EVANSs

Mr. Chief Justice, am1 may ifc please

the Court;
At issue in this cs.se is one portion of a Federal
Power Commission order entered in 1972 which established an
optional procedure for the certification of new sales of
natural gas by producers to interstate pipelines.

The Court

of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the
order in every respect except one.

It ruled that, the

commission has no authority under the Natural Gas Act to
authorize the future termination, of a sale of natural gas sit
the same time that it authorizes the sale to commence.

This

Court granted the commission’s petition for writ of certiorari
to review the validity of this advance termination issue which
the commission

referred to in its order as pre-granted

abandonment authority.
The Court simultaneously denied a cross petition by the
respondents here seeking to raise the remaining aspects of the
Court of Appeals" judgment.
Although this single feature of the order is before

4
the Court, I think it would be helpful if I outlined very
briefly the problems that the optional procedure or program was
designed to meet and the solutions that the commission
devised»

Like several other recent orders that have been before

the Court by the Power Commission, this is one of a number of
efforts that the commission has undertaken in order to fulfill
its responsibility to assure an adequate supply of gas to an
interstate market that has been increasingly in critical
shortage of supply.
The commission focused her© on a particular set of
problems resulting principally from the lengthy rate review
proceddings that have been endemic ever since almost the
commission began regulating producer sales.

These lengthy

procedures resulted in rat© uncertainties that the commission
determined, were impeding the willingness of producers to
undertake new exploration and development of gas reserves.
Evan under the area rata proceedings the commission's
rate review function had seemed interminable.

And even after

they were concluded, there were lengthy and very complex
judicial review proceedings, two of which reached this Court.
The rates collected by the producers during this entire period
were,under the provisions of the Natural Gas Act, collected
subject to the possibility of refund if the rates were
ultimately determined to be in excess of the levels found to be
just and reasonable? and producers, as a consequence, were

5
unsure that the funds they had already collected were really
there,, so whether they would have to be refunded.

Nor could

they accurately predict how much they could expect to receive
as a return on investments because there was no assurance what
the rate was likely to b© in the future.

All they knew for

surenas the commission stated in its order here, was that once
they started deliveries to the interstate market, they could
not stop unless they were able to persuade the commission that
the public interest, permitted the abandonment of this service.
With the availability of existing capital and with
the prospective rat.® of ret\irn on their investment unsure and
with the prospect of an indefinite commitment to an interstate
market, which would unsettle prices, the commission found that
producers naturally tended to act cautiously before embarking
upon new exploration and development and before committing new
acreage to the interstate market.
The order hare was designed to meet these problems
by making available to producers an alternative to the area
rat© procedure and in effect giving them the ability to
establish rates with certainty ovar the life of their
contracts.
First, the procedure permitted the producers to file
for the commission’s approval of contracts for the sale of new
gas to interstate pipelines at initial rates and at fixed
incremental rates provided for in the contract above the

6

applicable area ceiling level,
Second, the commission indicated that it would then
conduct in a single proceeding and promptly consider and
resolve whether the sale was one that should be certificated
as consistent with the public convenience and necessity

under

Section 7, and it would also consider and determine whether
it could approve as just and reasonable both the initial rate
in the contract as well as every fixed increment in the
contract.
Third,, if the commission issued a certificate of
convenience and necessity and approved the rates specified in
the contract, including these increments, the producer was to
be free to collect them without risk of refund.

The commissior

undertook to the extent that it could to assure the certainty
of the rates that it approved for the life of the contract.
Fourth and really the only directly pertinent aspect
of the order as far as this case goes, is that the commission
indicated that it would be willing to consider in the same
single proceeding at which it would consider certification and
approval of the rates—it would consider a request by the
producer for authority in advance to terminate service to the
pipeline at the end of the contract term,

This is the feature

that the commission titled pre-granted abandonment.

The theory

was that some otherwise tmav&ilable gas might be attracted to
the interstate market if tha producer were given advance

7
assurance that at the end of the contract term he would be
free to discontinue deliveries without having to demonstrate
again at the end of the term that discontinuance was consistent,
with the public interest at that time.
These benefits of the optional procedure were not
without a quid pro quo because the producer was required to
live with

the rates set in the contract.

He had to waive

his right, whici he ordinarily would have under Section 4 of
the act to file notice of rat© changes for the life of the
contract.

He also had to waive his right to receive, under

certain applicable area rate orders, to receive contingent
escalations of price for existing sales of flowing gas to
other purchasers.
And, finally, the contract could contain no
indefinite pricing clause—that is, one that referred to a
variable standard such as what is common in many contracts„ an
area rate clauses which says that the rate provided for in this
contract will reflect the maximum allowed by the commission
under the applicable area rate.
I would like at the outsat to make clear what the
pre-granted abandonment feature of the

order is not.

Respondents’ contentions her© are bottomed on the assumption
which is made repeatedly in their brief that this aspect of
the order amounts to a form of deregulation.
not so.

That is simply

The commission has not relinquished its control over

8

the termination of service, nor has it in any way indicated
that it is prepared to abandon the explicit statutory
standards governing the termination of service»
On the contrary, the commission's order indicates
unambiguously that future termination will not be authorized
unless the record demonstrates that the proposed termination
will be consistent with the present or future public convenience
and necessity, which is the standard under Section 70 of the
act.

This is not deregulation,
A

example of what is good deregulation is

contained in a bill pending before Congress, which I am told
was approved by the full House Committee on Interstate and
Foreign Commerce, H.R. 9464, approved, I am told, only
yesterday by the committee, which is a design to assure the
availability of adequate supplies of natural gas during
this winter and the following winter.

And it would permit

certain sales of natural gas to be made without commission
■rate regulation in a limited class of cases.
Section 6 of this bill provides that the abandonment
provisions of Section 7 shall not apply to those sales.

The

effect of that, bill, if it is enacted, will be to allow the
producer, consistent with his contract obligations, to
terminate

the sale of natural gas at his will and whenever he

wishes without need for any commission approval.
deregulation.

That is

The order here would have no such effect

9
because the commission would retain full authority and full
control over both whether and whan a termination would take
place.
There is another point which I would like to
emphasize,, which is that the order in this case is not an
order granting an authority to terminate service at any point.
The order here is simply the establishment of a procedure by
which the commission has indicated its willingness to consider
applications for such authority.
quite abstract.

The issue consequently is

It is not whether the commission will

-regulate but rather when.

And because we are dealing here

with the establishment of a procedure rather than with the
grant, of any authority, it seems to me that the respondents
have the

very heavy burden

of demonstrating that in no

conceivable circumstances could the commission ever authorize
termination of service at the same time it authorizes
certification.
The Court, of Appeals in effect held precisely that,
that is, that there are no circumstances in which this could
ever be done.

In its view, Section 7(b) requires that any

authorization to terminate service be granted at the time
roughly when the termination is proposed.
There is an irony to that holding.

Until 20 years

ago that was in fact the commission's position with respect
to Section 7(b).

The issue was first litigated in court

in

10

the mid-1950s in a series of Sunray cases,, one of which
ultimately reached this Court as I will mention in a moment.
A producer in the Sunray litigation had sought a certificate
for sales of natural gas to a pipeline and had asked the
commission to limit the certificate to the duration of the
underlying contract term.

The commission issued a certificate

but declined to issue it with the limitation requested on the
ground that, precisely what the Court of Appeals says here,
that it cannot do so except in a separate proceeding commenced
under Section 7(b) and at the time of the termination.

That

went to the Tenth Circuit which ruled that the commission was
in error.

It held that so long as the commission exercised

its statutory control over th© termination, it could do so at
the time of certification as well as at the time of the
termination.
It also ruled, however, that because the producer
had not demonstrated a reason why h® should be allowed to
terminate, the commission's order should be affirmed anyway,
and what followed was a petition for certiorari by the
producer asking that the case be sent back to the commission
for

reconsideration in light of this new holding

has authority that it thought, it had not.

that it

The commission

filed a responsa in this Court saying that on further study of
the Court of Appeals opinion, it agreed with the legal holding
of the court and it did not object to the proposed disposition

11
of the case which the court in a per curiam opinion in fact
did.
A few years later there was a second round of Sunray
litigation which did reach this Court on the merits.

Again

it was the same producer but a different set of sales.

He

sought again a limited term certificate and again the
commission tendered an unlimited certificate, this time
acknowledging its authority to grant a limited term
certificate

but finding that idler® had. been no showing that

the public convenience and necessity would be served by doing
so.

On review, the Tenth Circuit affirmed, holding that while

the commission has authority and acknowledges that it has
authority to grant a certificate which would expire of its
own force, it is not required to do so in the absence of an
adequate showing.

And this Court subsequently granted

certiorari and affirmed in an opinion for the Court by
Mr. Justice Brennan, reported at 354 US.

And while the only

question presented in the cas© was whether the commission
could properly issue an unlimited certificate when one of
limited duration was applied for, the Court's opinion as well
as the dissenting opinions plainly presupposed that the
commission had authority under the statute to grant limited
terra certificates.

The question was whether it also had the

authority not to.
And this Court's opinion quite pointedly stated at

12
page 157 that there was no contention that the commission was —
and I am quoting—“again indulging in the erroneous notion
that it had no power to issue a limited term certificate,"

The

Court cited at that point the Tenth Circuit's opinion in the
first round of the Sunray litigation which in fact established
that the commission had the power.
The Court's holding, as I read it in the second
Sunray opinion hero, was that the commission could properly
decline to issue a limited term certificate if it did

so with

the recognition that it had authority to grant one.
Respondents have made no effort in their brief to
distinguish between the limited term certificates that were
involved in the Sunray litigation and the so-called pregranted abandonment authority that is involved here, and there
is not any distinction between them anyway.

In either case

the commission simultaneously authorises the commencement of
a sals and the future termination of the sale at a date
certain without need for additional and subsequent commission
approval at the end of the tern.
Nor

respondents even acknowledge the existence of

this Court's statement in the Sunray opinion concerning the
power tc issue the limited term certificates, much less do they
attempt to explain why it is not a full answer to their
contentions here.

They prefer to ignore that aspect of the

Sunray opinion and to focus-on language elsewhere

in the

13
opinion from which they seem t© draw some comfort, unduly I
■chink.

And that was also the Court of Appeals error.

The

language relied upon by both the Court, of Appeals and by tha
respondents relates only to the dangers that the court
perceived from a holding that the commission was compelled to
grant a limited certificate merely because it was requested
by the applicant.

The order here does not have any of those

dangers, and that language seems to me totally inapplicable.
The commission has mad® clear that it would not automatically
grant abandonment authority on a producer’s request but would
require a showing that the public interest, would thereby be
served.
And an we indicate in footnote 9 of our brief, pages

17 to 18, the commission has in

fact rejected such requests

precisely because no such showing was made.
In light of this history, it seems to us the case is
very simple.

The short of it is that Section 7 ft) simply
t

does not address the question of when the commission may
properly authorize the termination of service.

It is designed,

as the legislative history reflects, merely to ensure that
the commission has control over the termination.

It leaves to

the commission the question of when that control is going to
be exercised.
The respondents’ contention that the commission cannot
possibly foresee at the.time of certification what the public

14
interest will be at the time of termination really rests on
a faulty premise that the only proper inquiry for the
commission is whether the public would need the gas at a date
after the proposed termination»

That is just not right.

There

is nothing in the act that forecloses the commission from
considering as one element of the present or future public
.

convenience and necessity—
Q

May 1 ask, Mr. Evans—X am not clear exactly

how -hliis works.

The producer gets the limited certificate and

can abandon at the end of the term.

But does it abandon

without complying with some procedure?

Did you suggest

earlier that there is still a procedure there?
MR. EVANS:
It. is the same as

No, there is no additional procedure.

it would have been in Sunray if the request

for certificate had been granted.
Q

Xn other words, if he got a ten-year certificate

and is permitted to abandon at the and of ten years, com® the
end of ten years, that is it?
MR. EVANS:
Q

And hs goes out of the sales.

MR. EVANS:
Q

That is right.

That is right.

Ec, the law in the contract then would be the

same?
MR. EVANS:

Q

That is right.

I mean, the statutory.

15
MR. EVANS:

Well, it would be, but it would be by the

commission's choice.
Q

And Sunray said that th® law can impose a

different period of service than the contract.
MR. EVANS:

That is right, and indeed the commission

can do so here.
Q

Rut you are suggesting that the commission can

grant a certificate that lasts no longer than the contract.
MR, EVANS:

That is right.

1 think that is suggested

by the opinions in Sunray.
Q

By both opinions, you suggest.

MR, EVANS:

That is right, not only th© majority

opinion but also the dissenting,
Q

What was held actually in Sunray, however, was

that if the commission decided not to do that and insisted
that th© producer should take an unlimited certificate, either
he took the unlimited certificate or he did not get the
certificate.
MR. EVANS:
true here.

Precisely.

Precisely.

And the same is

If an applicant applies for pre-granted

abandonment so-called in this context, and the commission
decides that a showing has not been made—as in fact in the
case cited in the footnote I mentioned did—it is up to him.
He can take it without the pre-granted abandonment or he can
reject it.

It is his option.

16
Q

Has the commission characteristically in the

past granted limited certificates—-I mean, prior to Sunray?
MR. EVANS:

Prior to Sunray, the Courts opinion

I think in Sunray points out. that there were a couple of
instances in its early history when it was granted without
discussion„
Q

Limited certificates.

MR. EVANS:
Q

Pardon me?

Limited.

MR. EVANSs

Limited in duration.

cited in a footnote in the Snnray opinion.

The cases are
I looked at them.

There was no discussion„ and I do not know what happened
between that early history and th® subsequent time when the
commission decided that it did not have that authority.

But

again that issue flip-flopped all through the history.
Originally they thought they had it apparently.

Then they

changed their minds and thought they did not have authority.
G

But S unray did say that that notion of the

commission"s was wrong.
MR. EVANS:
Q

Wrong, exactly.

Whether it was a holding or not.

MR, EVANS:

Whether it was a holding or not.

Let me put it this way.

X think you could charac­

terize it as a holding because I think, as X said, what the
Court was holding was that the commission could refuse to

17

grant a limited certificate but only if it did so with the
recognition that it had authority to do so, that it had
authority to grant a limited certificate.
Q

Unless it had. authority to grant a limited

certificate, there would not have been any need for a Sunray
case.
MR. EVANS;

Exactly.

Exactly.

It rests on that

assumption,
I was saying that the respondents here suggest that
the only inquiry that is proper at the time of the
certification is what the public's need for the gas will be
at the conclusion of the contract.
There is nothing in the act to suppport that.

There

is no reason why the commission cannot taka into account at
th© time of certification, as on© element of the present or
future public convenience and necessity, what the need for the
gas will b© during the period between certification and fcha
period at which termination is proposed.

Where the commission

determines that: a particular sale would not be made unless
advance authority is granted, it seems to me proper for it to
considar whether the need for the gas in th® interim is
sufficient to justify giving this producer th© advance
assurance h© requests.

The

alternative would be to lose the

gas altogether, assuming that the commission5s finding is
correct.—and

of course it is subject to judicial review—in

18

which case the public would have the gas both during and after
the period.

It is not our position that reads Section 7(b) as

a separate protection out of the act.

It is really

respondent's because on their theory the limitations upon what
the commission can properly consider mean that, the gas is not
going to bs able to be attracted, which point Section 7(b) has
never brought into effect because there is never any gag for
there to be terminated.
In any event, respondent’s speculation about what
the commission might and might not do with the authority that
it asserts and hew it might not exercise it really
premature.

is totally

The commission has never given such authority

under this order.

It has denied it on a couple of occasions.

And the proper time, it seems to us, to consider whether it
has correctly applied the statutory standards is

in a concrete

case when it has attempted to do so.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well, Mr. Evans.

Mr. Simons.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MORTON L. SIMONS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SIMONS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court s
Counsel for the Government has rather studiously
avoided saying just what it is that is supposed to be looked
at in an abandonment case.

He says there is nothing in the

19

statute that defines it and there is nothing in the statute
that says when it must be done,

But I do not think you can

interpret this section of the act. Section 7(b), the prohibi­
tion against abandonment of service without commission
approval, without an understanding of what is intended by that
section.

And this Court’s Sunray decision in 364 US does go

to what the policies of that section were.
What essentially they are intended to do is to do
at the time of abandonment, contemporaneous with abandonment,
not an advance licence but contemporaneous with abandonment,
to make a determination of one of two things—whether the
supply is depleted or whether abandonment may be permitted by
public convenience or necessity, which historically has meant:
Is there still a continuing public need for this service?
If there is a continuing public need for the service
at the time

that abandonment, is proposed, then abandonment is

not granted.
Counsel for the Government is simply wrong when he
says the commission has flip-flopped all over the place on
this.

There is not a single case that the Government cites

where they have ever allowed pre-granted abandonment.
And with reference to limited term certificates and
pre-granted abandonment, 1 do not think it is useful to wander
down that semantic pathway.
distinction between the two.

But there is conceptually a
A limited, term certificate is

20

appropriate where the seller only has a limited commodity to
sell as? for example, where he has committed his gas to
someone else, he has sold it in intrastate commerce, the
intrastate sale is not to commence for two years; he, therefore,
can make a sale for the two years until the other sale starts.
A limited term certificate would be appropriate.

Indeed, it

might even be mandatory since he would not have more than a
two-year supply to show.
But when you corn® to abandonment, once service has
been started, the question is, Does the public still need the
service at that point in time?
What was new about what the commission did here—it
decided that

regulation

in its normal traditional sense was

chasing gas away from the interstate mark* c

it was part cind

parcel of the same thinking that was involved in the small
producer exemption case that came to this Court in Texaco v.
FPC a year ago this past June.

Indeed, the two cases, the

small producer case and the optional procedure case, the
optional regulation case, marched through the courts one
behind the other.
The small producer case—the commission8s rule was
adopted in 1971«
August 1972.

The commission's rule here was adopted in

The small producer rule was set aside by the

Court of Appeals in December of 1972, and we briefed the case
in the court below against that background.

21
Then this Court granted certiorari.
case below.

We argued the

This Court in june of 1974 unanimously held that

the small producer exemption had to be set aside.

The mere

fact that the commission found that regulation was having a
discouraging effect and that if you had partial deregulation
you might encourage new supply was a consideration for
Congress.

It was not one that could be made by the commission.
The commission then submitted to the court below this

Court's decision in Texaco and its contemporaneous decision in
Mobil.

And that court in a very careful decision drew some

very important distinctions in finding that two of the three
major parts of the rule, the optional regulation rule, valid
and the third one, the so-called pre-granted abandonment
invalid.
I want to discuss just very briefly what the three
are, to explain why I think it is that the court made the
distinction.

There were three parts to optional regulation.

The commission had set just and reasonable levels.

These were

maximum levels that could be charged.
At the time of the 1972 rule, the dominant price was
the 26 cent level that this Court ultimately sustained in the
Mofai1 case in June cf 1974.

The commission said, “We want to

permit sales at above the just and reasonable level."

Those of

us who were opposing it argued that the commission lacked power
to do that because it was deviating from its own just and

22
reasonable standardThe second thing the commission wanted to do, it
wanted to permit escalations during the term of th© contract.
If it was over a 20-year period and there was a provision for
a two-cent increase each year, it wanted to grant approval to
that.

It wanted to grant approval to the outset of that.
And the third thing it wanted to do, it wanted to

grant pre-granted abandonment.
it wanted to grant the ?(b)

If it had a ten-year contract,

abandonment at the very time that

it authorized the sale to commence, prior even to the
commencement of the sale.

It wanted to do everything at once.

When the rule was still before the commission, the
commission retrenched somewhat, and it conceded that it could
hot insulate the rate and the service from review by subsequent
commissions during the term of the sale.

It would still

remain subject to Section 5 review as to its justness and
reasonableness on initiation of an investigation by any
subsequent commission during the term.
With respect to the rate increases, the court below
made clear that while the commission could say that it was
approving them at the outset, the producer who received the
certificate would have to file for those increases if the
commission in effect in office at the time those filings were
made so determined.

It could suspend those increases and follow

the normal procedure under Section 4(c)

and 4(d) of the act,

23
putting the burden back on the applicant of justifying the
increase.
With those interpretations and with its determination
also that the .initial price has to at least take into account
cost delta, the court was able* to sustain the first two parts,
a price in excess of the just and reasonable ceiling and the
escalations during the term.
Mien it came to the third part—’and I think that this
is really what is crucial—if pre-granted abandonment were
permitted, if the commission in 1973 said, "We are going to
authorize abandonment in 1980/' when the commission in 1980
cam® to look at this, it would have nothing to do.

other regulatory statutes.

Its similar to provisions in

And what is involved—what indeed

the Sung ay decision—in Sunrav (I) , the first of the two
decisions decided by the Tenth Circuit, its 1956 decision,
which the Government relies

so heavily on, that court stated

no single factor in the commission's duty to protect the public
can be more important to the public than the continuity of
service furnished.

And the court went on to note that without

that power all of the other commission's powers fell apart if
the producer can abandon.

24
I think that the difficulty and the real dispute
between ourselves and the Government is a question of what is
abandonment supposed to do and how does this limited term
concept fit in.
It is our position that there can be no such thing
as a pre-granted abandonment.

Pre-granted abandonment is

different from a limited term certificate, that a limited term
certificate is available on in very, rare, very special
circumstances.

The Government itself cites only one case in

footnote 10 of its brief, and that again is the case where a
seller has sold its gas already, the buyer :1s not ready to
talc© it, it 'wants t.o roaka a sale pending its original sale.
Q
abandonment

Mr. Simons, when you say a pre-granted
simply is not available, would you include in that,

say, a determination by the commission at the end of the eighth
year of a tenth year limited certificate—or say an unlimited
certificate of abandonment would be permitted at the end of
ten years?
MR. SIMONS:
Q

At the end of the eighth year?

Yes.

MR. SIMONS:

Obviously you have to come in before the

time is due, and I think that there is some period of time, a
year, 18 months, maybe two years.

The difficulty I have, and

it goes in part to what the commission says—of course
commission projections as to the future are to be respected

25
where that is all you can do,

I fehink that the commission

is entitled to estimate for a year ahead or for a year and a
half ahead, as long as it takes to run the proceeding»

1 think

by the time you get to three years or five years it is
unreasonable because there is no need to run your proceeding
that much in advance of the date that the abandonment is
proposed»

It is simply & question of what is sensible under

the circumstances.
I think the key is the contemporaneous determination.
Contemporaneous does not mean the same day? there can be a
lap over of let us say a year, some reasonable time.

But

contemporaneous determination was the language used by this
Court in Sunray, arid what it was concerned about, it did not
want an advance license to permit abandonment.
Obviously the permission to abandonment has to be
granted at some point before the actual abandonment but not
an advance license.
Counsel for the Government has stated that the
alternative is to lose the gas altogether without pre-granted
abandonment, that unless pre-granted abandonment is permitted,
the gas will never be dedicated to the interstate market.
But what this essentially is saying is that the producer does
not want to be regulated in whole; if part of what regulation
is all about is taken off, ho may be willing to play.

problem.

But it is a policy problem that was resolved by

Congress, and it was a policy problem that v?as answered by
this Court interpreting the congressional intent in Atlantic
Refining v. Public Service Commission, 360 US.

There the

producer said, "We will not sell unless we get our price."
And the commission originally said, "Your price is
too high."
The applicant said, "We will not sell at all unless
we get our price.

There will be a deprivation of gas to the

interstate market.”
So, the commission said, "All right, you can have
your price."
This Court said, “No, that is not lawful.

justification for the

commission giving him an unjust price."

the commission can do in those circumstances is to authorise

MR. SIMONS:

Correct.

No question about that.

And

we go back of course to the dilemma that Mr. Justice White
recognised for a unanimous court in Texaco a little over a
year ago.

It may well be—-there are certainly arguments

made—that regulation is counter-productive in a time of
shortage»

It may be that it is not.

It may be that is when

But even if we assume that it is counter­

productive,. even if w« assume that it chases gas away from the
interstate market# the determination is one to be made in
Congress.
Counsel refers to a bill that apparently was
approved yesterday by the House Commerce Committee addressing
itself to some of these emergency problems.

I am not familiar

with the bill# but I do say that is the forum where it ought
to be handled.

It ought not to be handled by the commission

saying# "The producers do not like regulation# so we will
peel off a few of the more egregious layers of regulation# the
parts they like the least# and see if this will coax them to
play."

That is the determination that Congress ought to make.

aside a year ago, of this optional regulation that is before
the Court in part now, has been the commission5s theory that if
it does these various things, that if it makes regulation
easier, there will be more gas forthcoming.

The fact of the

matter is-—and we have had now three years of history under

It is a procedure that has not worked and is not
There are reasons for it, but certainly whether

there is pre-granted abandonment in it or not, no important
commission program, no important public interest, is being
affected because in fact there are no sales being made
pursuant to this program.

The commission itself has indicated

in a series of recent orders that it has grave doubts about the
validity of pre-granted abandonment of even what it calls
limited certificates, and it makes a distinction between
limited term certificates and pre-granted abandonment.

And it

has increasingly declined to issu® certificates for limited
term certificates or to give pre-granted abandonment.
The short answer, Your Honors, 1 think is simply
this.

The abandonment provision is an important protection to

the public.

Once service is commenced, the public becomes

dependent on that service.

It is an incident of regulation.

Yet it is

The proper determination

should b@ made by the commission in office at the time the
abandonment is proposed or immediately before the time the
abandonment is proposed.

The statute should not b® changed

by administrative interpretation of the Federal Power
Commission, and the Federal Power Commission—except for
footnote 10, the one limited case we spoke about—has cited no
other case when it would be appropriate to grant pre-granted
abandonment.
If it wants the footnote 10 type exception where gas
has already been sold to A to start two years hence and it

hus some gas to sell t© B during that intervening period, it
can draft a rule far tighter, far more carefully than the
broad gauge rule it drafted here and that the court below very
properly set aside.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Simons.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Evans?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. EVANS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. EVANS:

I have just one thought.

Mr. Simons has

relied very heavily on this Court's opinion in the Texaco
case, the small producers' case, and I just want to emphasize

30

that there ware really two questions before the Court in
Texaco.

One was; whether it was proper for the Power Commission

to engage in indirect regulation of small producers if it
could assure just and reasonable rates through that process.
And the attack was made on that plan on the ground that it was
deregulation, it is for Congress.

The Court held that it

would b@ proper if the commission adequately indicated in its
order that it was going to apply the just and reasonable
standard of the statute.
There is no question that the order in this case
applies and intends to apply to the public convenience and
necessity standard of this statute.

There is no similar

question ©bout, the validity of the order.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:52 o^clock p.m. the case was
submitted.3
