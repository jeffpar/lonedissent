PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 74-1409, North against Russell.
Mr. Goss, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES E. GOSS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. GOSS:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
My name is Charles E. Goss, and I an counsel for
appellant.

My client, Lonnie North, is under sentence of 30

days imprisonment in the Harlan County Jail, which was imposed
upon him by one of the appellees in this case, Judge C. B.
Russell, who is the judge of the Lynch City Police Court,
Lynch, Harlan County, Kentucky.
This appeal is from the Court of Appeals of
Kentucky and challenges on Fourteenth and Sixth Amendment
grounds the constitutionality of certain Kentucky statutes
which empower non-lawyer judges to preside in criminal cases
and to impose sentences of imprisonment.

Since this appeal

tests the competency and the capacity of the trial judge in
this case, Judge Russell, I will begin by discussing Judge
Russell's credentials, his qualifications fco act as a judge.
I would start by saying that Judge Russell is not a
lawyer.

He is a coal miner, and he has had absolutely no

legal training whatever.

4
Q

How long has

MR. GOSS:

he been on the bench?

Your Honor, at the tin» the appellant was

tried, Judge Russell had been on the bench for six months in
this small fifth class city which does not augur for very much
experience because they do not have a very heavy case load.
Q

This is part time?

MR. GOSS:
Q

It is a part-time job, Mr, Chief Justice.

Much like the magistrates and the justices of

the peace and some others in England, for example, and in some
states in this country.
MR. GOSS:
country.

Much like some of the

statas in this

I was in England recently and did a very brief study

of the lay judge system over there, and I found that the lay
judge system in England is quite different from the system in
our country in that there they sit. in panels of three and they
have at their disposal the services of a clerk, what they
call a clerk, and he is the gentleman who really makes the
legal decisions and the man who advises the court as to what
the application
Q

of the law ought to be.
Is ha a lawyer?

MR. GOSS:

He is a barrister or a solicitor, yes,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
Q

I suppose, Mr. Goss, there is not any question

here about the lack of qualifications of Judge Russell, is
there?

5

MR. GOSS:

Mr. Justice Blackmun, I certainly hope

that there is no question about it.

Q

That is why I wonder why you emphasise them so.

It seems to me they are fairly clear, that he was not
qualified.
MR. GOSS:

I emphasize them, Mr. Justice Blackmun,

because I felt that it was important to this argument to bring
into focus the lack of competency and capacity of this
particular judge, it being the crux of this case.
Q

Would you take the same position about an

appeals court judge, a judge that was reviewing convictions on
appeal, if he was not a trained lawyer?
MR. GOSS:
Q

Mr. Chief Justice, yes, indeed I would.

Then you might have that problem here some day.

There is no requirement that any member of this Court be a
lawyer.

The Senate could confirm now for the present

vacancy a non-lawyer, if they wanted to.

Would you then say

the court was incompetent as a whole or just that one man was
disqualified, one person?
MR. GOSS:

I would suppose that if that situation

every confronted the Senate,

the Senate would be most

reluctant to confirm a man who was untrained in the law.
I might say this, that my research does not indicate
that there has ever been in the h:.3tory of this

Court a

judge who was not trained in the law, who was not a lawyer.

6
Q

Mr. Goss, are you familiar with the former

New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals, the top court of that
state?
MR. ROSS;
Q

Your Honor, I am not.

That was a 16~judge court of whom six members

were laymen.
MR. GOSS;

There are many variations of court systems

in the different states.
Q

I just wonder if its judgments would come under

the same criticism.
MR. GOSS;

I was very interested In the English

courts, Mr. Justice Brennan, and the way that they are put
together.

The three judges over there are lay judges.

Often

they sit stipendiary magistrates who are trained barristers
or solicitors.

They are largely a blue-ribbon jury because

the decisions they make are largely factual decisions rather
than decisions of law, although they do apply the law to a
case much in the way that a jury does in this country.
Q

But then England does not have a due process

clause, does it?
MR, GOSS;

That i3 correct, Mr. Justice Marshall, and

they do not live under the same kind of constitution that we
live under.
Q

Mr. Goss, your discussion of gual5.fications and

some of the colloquy from the bench suggests almost assuming

7
the point in argument from the beginning.

When you say the

man was not qualified and he was not competent, all you mean is
that he was not legally trained, he did not have a law degree.
MR. GOSS:

I would answer that in two ways.

X would

say that, not only did he not have a law degree, Mr. Justice
Rehnquist, but I would say also that ha did not possess
sufficient legal knowledge subjectively to have accorded
Lonnie North his constitutional rights, his substantive and
procedural constitutional rights.
Q

What legal issues would be involved in

determining the guilt cr innocence in this cate and trying to
apply the law to tha facts?
MR. GOSS:
this case?

What legal issues would be involved in

There ware legal issues that were brought to the

forefront in the actual trial itself, Mr. Chief Justice.
Lonnie North, whan he want into the courtroom, entered a plea
of not guilty and demanded a trial by

jury.

The judge

retired to an office in the next room for a few minutes.

First,

ha said, "X will give you a jury trial if it takes rae all
night."

He cemo back after having been in there for a while

and said, "!. just talked to tie city prosecutor, and ha tells
me I do not have to give you a trial by jury.

I am going to

try you myself."
i

That, Mr. Chief Justice, was a decision of law in
which he erred grievously, and that was on® of the most

c
elementary propositions in Kentucky, that under the Kentucky
Constitution, Section 11, this man was indeed entitled to a
trial by jury.
Q

Mr. Goss, before you proceed, does Kentucky

require a law degree to be licensed to practice?
MR. GOSS:

Mr. Justice Powell, it does.

You have

to have a law degree and you have to pass a bar examination
and you have to be licensed.
Q

That is fairly recent in terms of an absolute

requirement, is it not, the law degree, within the last what—
ten to twenty years?
MR. GOSS:

Within my memory.

Other legal judgments that were required to be made,
Mr. Chief Justice, were decisions that pertained to this man's
constitutional rights.

He

entatled to be represented by

counsel at this hearing, but he did not have counsel.
Q

Presumably a good many well trained, legally

trained, judges have made that judgment also in recent times
pest, have they not?
MR. GOSS:

Yes, indeed, and 1 think that they are

still making that false assumption; according to a recent
report done by the Boston University Law School, many judges
are failing to implement the mandate in Argersinger v. Hamlin.
Q

Then judgments so obtained would be subject to

reversal on that ground, would they' not?

9
MR. GOSS:

Reversal on that ground, except that in

Kentucky we do not have the review kind of process. We have the
trial de novo process in Kentucky.
Q

Even better, is it not?

MR. GOSS:
view of the matter.

That depends, Mr. Chief Justice, on your
We read and took to heart the decision in

this Court in Ward v. Monroeville in which it was stated,
"...nor in any event raay the state's trial court procedure be
deemed constitutionally acceptable simply because a state
eventually offers a man a constitutional trial.

Petitioner

is entitled to a fair trial in the first instance."
Q

Can you not distinguish bias from lack of

competence?
MR. GOSS:

Yos, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I can

distinguish bias between lack of

competence in this respect.

Bias usually appertains in a case on a case-by-case basis,
and competent pertains across the board in every case on which
that person sits.
Q

But. you do not think that bias is a more serious

infection in the process than lack of competence?
MR. G03S:

If I had my choice, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

between a biased judge and a judge who was unfamiliar with the
law, I. think I would be hard put to make the decision.
Q

I will tell you, I would not ba.

We had

justices of the peace in Phoenix where I practiced.

We did not

10

require a law degree.

Some were lawyers and some were laymen.

And I think many members of the bar would have chosen the
laymen to put their case to put their case before just because
you could get a pretty competent layman for the salary.

But

all you could get was the bottom of the barrel so far as the
lawyers were concerned.
MR. GOSSs
Q

It could present a problem.

I think it would present a problem if your view

prevailed here.
MR. GOSS:

I might say too that in Ward v. Monroeville,

Mr. Chief Justice, that that was a case that involved a fine
only.

Here we are talking about a right which in considerably

more fundamental than the right to protect your money and the
right to protect your liberty.
Q

As Mr. Justice Rehnquist pointed out, that case

was dealing with bias, built-in partisanship of the judge,
was it not?
MR. GOSS:

Built-in partisanship of the judga, yes,

it was, Mr. Chief Justice.
Q

Becaiise of his conflicting interests.

MR. GOSS:

Financial bias was really the basis upon

which that case was decided.

But there is broad language in

there, broad constitutional language, which would indicate
that a man need not go through a star-chamber proceeding of
the kind that Lonnie North had to go through in order to find

11
himself eventually in a constitutional court and a court which
is able by training and experience and presided over by a
judge

capable of according him his rights.

This judge did not

advise Lonnie North of his right to be represented by counsel.
He did not advise hint of his right to a trial by jury.
As a matter of fact, he did not comply with any of
the mandates of the Kentucky criminal code of procedure with
.respect to advising him of his various constitutional rights,
because it says specifically that every accused will be advised
of his right to a triad by jury, his right to counsel, of his
right not to incriminate himself, of his right to confront the
witnesses against him.

None of these things were done.

And then when it came down to the trial process, the
judge says, "I am going to try you myself," and as it turned
out only one v;itness testified and that, was the arresting
officer.

And it was obvious on the face of this record that

this trial contained none of the virtues of a due process
trial»
Q

All you need to prevail on is the fairness of

this particular trial.
MR. GOSS:

We need to prevail on the fairness of

this particular trial, and we need to prevail on the fairness
of tiie trial to coria, Mr. Justice White.

If this case were

reversed by this Court, I feel certain that under the lav/s of
Kentucky, it would be sent beck to Kentucky for retrial.

12

Q

Are you suggesting that any trial whatsoever

tried by a non-lawyer would fail to be a due process trial?
MR. GOSS:

I am saying, Your Honor, that the

probability of an unfair trial in a court presided over by a
non-lawyer judge is so great—
Q

So, you say yes.

MR. GOSS:
Q

I say yes.

You say it does not. make any difference how

otherwise well trained a person was .
judges had been on the bench for 2<

Suppose one of these
or 30 years, had studied

the law, had just never been admit’ ed to practice, but as far
as anybody knows he probably knows more about his business than
the lawyers that appear before him

And you would suggest that

your fears there should prevail an< upset any conviction
before a judge like that?
MR. GOSS:

Mr. Justice Wfrite, I will say this, in 17

years of practice I have not found that judge.

I have practiced

before many magistrates, many justices of the peace that have
been on the bench for longer periods than the period you
suggested, and I never saw one yet that was able to conduct a
fair trial, a constitutional trial in accordance with the
Fourteenth Amendment and in accordance

with the

lawus of the

Commonwealth of Kentucky.
Q

And apparently you would say that is true no

matter wh&t the issue in any case was?

13

MR. GOSS:

I think there way be cases—I think there

may be cases, non-imprisonment cases.
Q

Would you ever let one take a plea of guilty?

MR. GOSS:
Q

With proper training, perhaps yes.

Proper training—what do you mean by that?

Do you mean as a lawyer?
MR. GOSS:

On that one restricted point it might very

well be that in terms of one particular point or in terms of
performing one particular service that a person could be
trained to adequately perform that service even though he were
not a lawyer.
Q

Would you say that would also be true where

the plea is not guilty if the only issue

in a case happened

to be a particular kind of issue, like whether he was hurt or
not and the fellow happened to be a doctor?
MR. GOSS:

I would say, Mr. Justice White, that a

criminal trial is a very, very complex matter.
said that many, many times.

Q

This Court has

It has said it in Powell v. Alabama—

Is a criminal trial always a very, very complex

matter?
MR. GOSS:

It depends, Your Honor, upon the

participants in the trial.

I would say that the trial is

being conducted against the background of what could be a very
complicated proceeding.
Q

Mr. Go3s, on the other hand, suppose the judge in

14
this case were a lawyer who had practiced probate law
exclusively for 20 years and then he was mads a magistrate;
he would be all right,
MR. GOSS:

Mr. Justice Marshall, I think that is

right, under the standard

that v/e are asking the Court to

articulate in this case.
Q

That is what you are asking us.

MR. GOSS:
Q

That is correct.

Xn contrast, if he had gone to Harvard College

and had been first in his class and gone two years and seven
months to the Harvard Lav/ School and been first in his class,
then had to leave for reasons of illness or never resumed the
practice of lavr and therefore had never been admitted to the
bar, he would be unqualified under your test.
MR. GOSS:
Q

Disqualified, yes, Mr. Justice Stewart.

Mr. Goss, if your client had been charged only

with a misdemeanor that called for no prison sentence, would
you be making the same argument?
MR. GOSS:

If that had been the case, Mr. Justice

Powell, I would not be here today.
Q

Suppose your client, were charged for the third

time, say, with some traffic violation and the Kentucky law
authorized the revocation of his license and the issue were
whether he would be convicted and, if so, his license would be
revoked

15
MR. GOSS i

I would regard that as principally a

civil natter.
Q

Right.

You would draw the line where

Argersinger—
MR. GOSS:

We would draw the line exactly where

Argersinger drew the line because we realize and understand
that in this country there are over 50 million traffic cases
heard every year , and there are so many misdemeanors on the
books that never really result in imprisonment.
Q

And yet if you were a traveling salesman and

lost your driver's license, the sanction might be very much
more serious for you than if you were confined to jail for a
night or two.
MR, GOSS:

I would say, Mr. Justice Powell, in a

situation like that a trial de novo procedure might be
adequate to protect the interests of the driver.
As I see this line of questioning, if I may be
permitted to say this, the other trial participants in a
criminal case are lawyers.

I think that the trial court was

described by the chief justice as a tripartite, consisting of
three elements—the trial judge, defense counsel, and counsel
for the prosecution.

It is our contention that when one

faction of this tripartite breaks down, then for all practical
purposes you are dealing with an unconstitutional court.
C

The book did not say anything about the judge

16

being

a licensed lawyer, did it?
MR. GOSS:

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

Q

It does not really help yon very much, does it?

Q

Mr. Goss, enlighten me a little bit about the

Kentucky system.

You do have a second tier in the de novo

trial that is available.

Could Mr. North have peaded guilty

and then demanded a jury trial in the second tier without the
plea standing against him?
MR, GOSS:

Yes, Mr. Justice White, he could have.

That is de novo procedure.
Q

So that in the de novo procedure he could have

obtained everything, the lack of which is the basis of your
complaint now.
MR. GOSS:
Q

That is correct.

Without going through a trial.
H *

MR. GOSS:
Q

Without going through a trial.

But you would still make the same argument even

if he had had a lawyer to advise him to plead guilty and take
his de novo procedure?
MR. GOSS:
Q

Under that hypothetical situation, ye3.

You said that you would let him plead guilty

before an untrained judge.
MR. GOSS:

If I said that, Mr. Justice White, I said

it in error.
Q

You did not say that: you said perhaps somebody

17
could be trained to take pleas of guilty.
MR. GOSS:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

But this one was not.

MR. GOSS:

This one was not.

I might say this, that on this whole issue of trial
de novo there are some things involved that really turn on
the question of fair trial.

There are the economic dis­

advantages to a man in having to go through two trials instead
of one, having to pay a lawyer twice.
Q

I thought you just said he did not have to go

through two trials, that he could plead guilty and go right
up and have his de novo trial.
MR. GOSS:

There has to be an appeal lodged in the

circuit court from the lower court, which involves activities
in the lower court, ireluding the acquisition of a judgment,
statement of trust, and bringing it into the circuit court and
getting a bond and lodging the matter in the lawyer court, in
the circuit court.
Q

He can do it all in one stroke, can he not?

MR. GOSS:
correct.

He can do it all in one stroke, that is

But our contention is and our question is, Why should

he?
Q
case?

Could he bypass Judge Russell entirely in this

"X do not want to have anything to do with your court.

I want a de novo trial in the regular court."

18
MR. GOSS:

Mr. Justice Blackmun, no, that is not an

available procedure under the law.
Q

He would have to file a plea of some kind?

MR. GOSS:

He would have to file a plea of some kind.

There would have to be a judgment of conviction, whether
entered on a plea of guilty or following a trial before the
de novo process could be invoked.
With respect to this whole idea of why a lawyer as
opposed to a layman, I think if one starts with the premise
that we are dealing here with two of the most fundamental
rights that ws enjoy a3 citizens, one being the right of a
fair and impartial hearing, in the first instance, another the
right to effective assistance of counsel, both of which are
said to bs by thi3 Court very valuable fundamental rights, then
determination must be made as to what is the best way to
protect these rights.

What kind of judge should you have on

Should you have a judge who is familiar with the

Should he know what the Fourteenth Amendment provides?

Judge Russell did not.

should he know what the Kentucky rules

of criminal procedtire say or ba at least nominally familiar
with them?

His

19

misrepresentation of justice."

I do not know what that means

except that it means that he really did not know what he was
talking about.
Q

A good many people say that about appellate

courts, including lawyers.
MR. GOSS:

I do not think, Mr. Chief Justice, that

is exactly what he meant.

I think he weis trying to tell us

that he did not really know.
Q

He did express a view about some of the

decisions of this Court, I noticed, in the hearing.
MR. GOSS:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, he certainly

did, saying he did not agree with most of them.
If you ask rhetorically why not have lawyers in
these courts, then I think you really reach the crux of this
case in terms of what I am trying to put across.

As I said,

the other people in the case, the other three parts of the
tripartite, the other tv;o parts are lawyers.
judge?

Why not the

And should not the judge be the best trained

participant in the criminal process?
The Sixth Amendment does not say anything about
counsel having to be a licensed lawyer, but it has always been
presumed that counsel must be a licensed lawyer.
Q

In Argerslnger itseld, am I accurate in my

recollection that the opinion suggested that counsel need not
be a licensed lawyer for purposes of the Argersinger

20
requirement.
MR. GOSS:
suggestion in there.

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, there is some
And I believe, as a matter of fact,

that the Solicitor General made that suggestion in an amicus
brief that he filed with the Court.

I do not know how you are

going to get around the state requirements of the state bar
associations.
Q

Am I right in my understanding that in many

states those formerly very rigid requirements have been
loosened up somewhat, at least to

allow law students to

participate in defense of indigent criminal defendants?
MR. GOSS:

That is right.

And they have in

Kentucky also.
But there are such questions as, Do you adopt an
objective standard or do you adopt some subjective standard?
Do you put the benchmark here somewhere and you say this man
has to at least be able to read and write his own name?

Which

you do not have to be able to do in Kentucky to be judge of
a sixth class city.
Q

I gather that under your judicial article, this

court goes out of existence in '78, does it not?
MR. GOSS:
Q

In '78.

And is replaced by what?

MR. GOSS:

By an all-lawyer court, a unified court

system staffed wholly by lawyers.

21
Q

This is a constitutional amendment, is it?

MR. GOSS:
Q

Constitutionel amendment.

Is there not an exception to the statement you

just made?
MR, GOSS:

There is this exception, that if there

are not available within the community lawyers with which to
staff the district court, then lay persons may be called upon,
assuming that they are properly qualified.

But they have to

be approved by the chief justice.
Q

But they could not be.

You would have the same

objection to those laymen, would you not?
MR. GOSS:

Yes, I would.

I would have the same

objection, and it certainly would not be an objection that
would be hard to overcome in terms of implementation.

There

are circuit riding judges in various states in the union that
could be utilized in situations of that kind.
On the other hand, if you adopt some subjective
standard of judicial compentency such as has been suggested by
the attorney general in his brief, then you get into the
question of probing a. person's knowledge.
yourself, What does he have to know?
much he knows?

You have to ask

How do we find out how

And what, kind of test do we promulgate to

determine what his knowledge is?

Which to us would be a very,

very difficult thing to implement.
C

Could you not measure it by very objective

22
standards?

Just what errors did he make?

I gather in this

case the judge made three or four or more very egregious and
self-evident

errors.

So, obviously this conviction, if my

understanding is correct—I understand it is conceded—then this
conviction should have been vacated and

was a nullity on the

new trial.
MR. GOSS:
Mr. Justice Stewart.
argument.

We took it through the courts of Kentucky,
We did not get anywhere with that

That is the reason why we are here today.
Q

As I read it, you insisted on not bringing up

that argument.
MR. GOSS:
Q

Yes, that is true.

That is true.

You obviously did not get anywhere with something

that you refused to embrace.
MR. GOSS:

We had read the decision in Weird v.

Monroeville and taken it to heart, and then I believe that
this man is entitled to a fair trial in the first instance.
We took the harder ground which led us to this Court today.
Q

It was the harder ground in the sense that it

was the one that you thought would take you here as distinguished
from disposing of the case with much less difficulty for
everyone involved.
MR. GOSS:

Is that not so?
It was a harder ground, Mr. Chief Justice,

and was selected in that to us it accorded the kind of relief
that ought to have been accorded in this case, to assure Lonnie

23
North that upon retrial he would be tried in

&

court presided

over by a competent and lawfully trained judge.
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Q

Could I ask you, suppose that the gentleman

went to jail after being convicted by this untrained judge and
h'

then went to federal habeas, would he have exhausted his

state remedies if ha had not appealed?
MR. GOSS:

Mr. Justice White, that would be a very

interesting question in view of the availability of trial de
novo in Kentucky»

I am just not that familiar with that

particular kind of practice.

I wish I could answer your

question.
Q

But apparently the Kentucky courts accepted

this in a state habeas proceeding, accepted this issue, without
requiring exhaustion of the appellate process.
MR. GOSS:

That is correct.

The appellate processes

in so far as they provide for trial de novo.
Thank you,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Chenoweth.

ORAL ARGUMENT 0? ROBERT L. CHENOWETH, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR, CIIENOWETH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The* position of. the appellees today is that the
Federal Constitution does not require that a defendant who is

24

accused of a criminal misdemeanor charge from which the
possible punishment is imprisonment/ that that individual
need not be tried by a lawyer judge, that the Federal
Constitution does not mandate that kind of requirement.
The Tenth Amendment of our Federal Constitution, the
states have the right to establish their own judicial system,
and the Commonwealth of Kentucky has adopted a judicial system
that handles misdemeanor castss, minor criminal misdemeanor
cases, and in part that criminal misdemeanor system utilizes
non-lawyer judges.
We do not feel that in the Tenth Amendment there is
any constitutional compulsion that a state adopt what might be
considered an ideal system of the administration of justice.
The fact that a judicial system has lawyer judges does not

good system cr that, a judicial system that has non-lawyer
judges means that that is a bad judicial system,.

And the

Commonwealth of Kentucky has in part adopted a system using
non-lawyer judges.
The issue in rhis case is not whether the judicial
power was constitutionally exercised by Judge C. B. Russell.
It was not.

The issue is whether that judicial power was

constitutionally vested, and we believe that it- was.

We believe

that judicial power may be constitutionally placed with a

We

readily agree that the Constitution and due process does
require a fair trial in a fair tribunal.

This Court has

considered several times what is necessary for there to be a
fair tribunal.

The Court has

said that the tribunal should be

unbiased, that the tribunal should be neutral and detached—
Turney, Ward, Moore v. Dempsey.

In each of these cases there

was something to taint the tribunal in terms of his biasness
or his neutrality in considering the case.
But we believe that a non-lawyer can be unbiased, he
can ba neutral, he can be detached.

This unbiased, neutral

It is a two-part thing.

A fair trial and a fair

And we do not feel that the non-lawyer judge is

prohibited by that status from being a fair tribunal, and that
status neither prevents him from affording one accused of a
criminal misdemeanor a fair trial.
A non-lawyer judge, it seems, can look at a case—

We believe that the non-lawyer judge can maks

probability we feel that prejudice will result in a case that
is handled by a non-lawyer judge.

There is nothing to show

that non-lawyer judges convict more frequently, are reversed
more on appeal, or that they allow matters into evidence or
otherwise handle a minor criminal misdemeanor case in a fashion
that is any less than one handled by a lawyer judge.

But X would not begin to

say that the non-lawyer judge would necessarily know all of the
evidentiary rules that a lawyer does, but I do not believe
that that prevents the non-1vwyer judge from giving the man a
fair trial.
The real purpose, it seems, for duo process in a
criminal case is to give the accused an opportunity to
defend, and we feel that when you. do have a tripartite entity,

27

when you do have an attorney for the prosecution and you have
an attorney for the defendant, that these two attorneys will
be able to afford the individual accused of the opportunity
to defend.

The argument has been made that the right to a law­

yer judge is required by the Sixth Amendment and specifically
the right to counsel thereunder.

But we believe strongly that

this is not a right to counsel case.
The rights enumerated in the Sixth Amendment give the
tools so that one can prepare an adequate defense in a court of
law.

It is a fundamental right to one accused of a criminal

charge to make a defense.

Due process says that he must have

the opportunity to make that defense.

The Sixth Amendment

gives those standards that all criminal prosecutions must
abide by in order to give that defendant an opportunity to
defend.
Sure, he has s right to be informed of the accusation.
He has the right to be confronted with the

And ha does have the right to assistance

But the rijhts of the Sixth Amendment, basic to

our adversary system of criminal justice, do not have as a part
of that bundle of rights to afford an accused the opportunity
to defend the right—not part of that bundle of rights there is
not existing—the right to a lawyer judge.
Q

Certainly some of the most celebrated cases in

28
the Anglo-Saxon tradition have involved extraordinarily able
counsel like Lord Broras in the divorce trial of Queen Caroline
before the House of Lords, Burke in the impeachment of Warren
Hastings before the House of Lords, and a situation where
most of the House of Lords were not judges, have they not?
MR. CHENOWETH:

X think that is absolutely correct,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, end this is our belief, that when you
do have attorneys who are advocating both sides, that they
will help marshal the evidence, they will overlook the
proceedings of the other opposing counsel.

I would certainly believe that that

or to consider the as car taininent of the truth and that they do

Q

By coincidence, the presiding officer was a

lawyer but the Vice President of the United States might not
be a lawyer.

The present Vice Presidant is not.

If an

29
executive officer or a judicial officer were tried in the
Senate today, the presiding officer ruling on evidence would
be a non-lawyer.

Is that not

MR. CIIENOWETH:

so?

That is correct, and that individual

could surely make a fair and impartial consideration of that
case* and could ascertain the truth of the charges that he would
need to consider.

I feel vary strongly that that type of

proceeding is not in violation of the due process clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment to our Federal Constitution.
Q

Do you think our Shadwick decision helps your

case?
MR. CHENOWETH:

I would only say that I think that

it recognizes the fact that there are matters that a non-lawyer
judge or a non-lawyer individual can make.

Here in that case,

of course, we were talking about clerks, and they were making
de tertii nations of probable cause for warrants on municipal
offenses.

So, wo are not really on square with that case.

But in terms of reasoning I believe that i<re are because it is
a recognition that non-lawyers can make decisions.

Jurors

every day are asked to make just significant decision of beyond
a reasonable doubt, and that is a verj

tremendous burden placed

upon these non-lawyer individuals.

Q

So, what you are saying, unless it were a

MR. CHENOWETH:

I think that that is true.

We argue

in federal habeas corpus cases, however, that those matters
that are known at the time at the time that lower actions are
taken, that these do need to bo raised, and that federal
habeas corpus is no substitute for an appeal.

make errors.

Judges who are lawyers

The circuit judge who considered this case, the •

habeas corpus, he made an, error in terms of whether or not a
habeas was an available situation in the state, and it is not
an available situation.

And the Court of Appeals brought that

out in the first consideration of this case.
So, there are errors that are made, and these errors
are made by lawyer judges and non-lawyer judges.

But with our

fystera in Kentucky, with the two-tier system we presently
have, with the courts of convenience, the police courts being
one of them, we have also the general jurisdiction circuit
courts, and judges are required to be attorneys in the circuit
courts.
This Court of course had occasion to consider cur

32
two-tier system in Kentucky in Colten v. Kentucky, and it was
recognized that these inferior courts, as we refer to them in
the Commonwealth, are designed to afford the speedier and less
costly adjudications and that if the individual accused is
unhappy with the decision that has occurred in the inferior
court, that he has the unconditional right to take an appeal—

tion—to the circuit court where a judge is going to be

We most surely have had this case

before our highest state court.
Q

Not if Judge Kelmore has anything to say about

that.
MR. CHENOWETH:

I think you are absolutely correct.

He was quite unhappy with the developments that came with this
case.

He was unhappy with your confession of error,

I take it.
MR. CHENOWETII:

Yes, sir, I think that is a very

fair statement.
Q

In Kentucky, as I understand it, cities of 20,000

or more do require judges to be lawyers.
MR. CHENOWETH:

Yes, absolutely.

We are talkincr

about the first and second class cities, as our co?istitution
breaks down by population siza.

So, we are talking about

those cities that have greater than 20,00^ people in them.
State lav; does require the police court j .dge in the first and
second class city to be lawyers.

It is to third through

3ixth classes; of cities, all the way from iess than 20 down to
les3 than 1000 people that we do not require.

34
Q

Judges, whether they be lawyers or laymen, in

all cities in Kentucky apply the same state law, I take it.
MR. CIIENOWETII:

Yes, this is true.

The criminal

law is all to be applied the same by all of them, and all fifth
class cities—the law is applied the same in all the fifth
class cities that exist in the state.

This is stated in the

section of our constitution classifying cities, in Section 156
where it talks about all the cities in

a

particular class,

that their organization and their government, the same laws
will apply to them.
Q

Is there any reason other than convenience for

drawing a distinction between the smaller and the larger
cities?
MR. CIIENOWETII:
is.

Yes, I believe that there very much

We have, first of all, the consideration that obviously

as an outgrowth of that smallness there is not going to be
nearly the number of cases.

We have part-time police court

judges in these smaller cities, whereas in the larger cities
they would be a full-time position.
In a small city, being in our rural parts of the
state, the polico court judges know the people in that small
city.

And the prosecutions usually are not that vigorous.

There are differences in handling of the cases in a smaller
class of city.
You also have just the very, very important factor

35
still existing in Kentucky that we have counties in the
Commonwealth of Kentucky where there are very few attorneys,
maybe only one or two or maybe only four or five, existing in
some 24 of our 120 counties.
So, we do have a problem that I think you recognize
in Argersinger

that we still have in the Coranonwealth of

Kentucky, although the situation in Argernlnc ;r as far as the
distribution of attorneys in the Commonwealth is quite
different, we believe, in this case.

In Argersinger the

requirement of having an attorney for a criminal misdemeanor
case--the fact that that attorney would come from a first
class city and drive down the road 25 miles to a class of
city, maybe a fifth or sixth class city, that was really very
unimportant as long as that man helped the accused present his
defense.
But we are trIking about here the fact that, as our
state has liked—and we, I think, the citizens of the
Commonwealth want to have matters handled by
by residents.

re of their own,

And we have residential re< airur.ents for

police court judges.

Sc, it is not the siuttfing of an

attorney from maybe where there are too many attorneys—in
Louisville, Kentucky, for example--into a small community such
as I live in with 4000 people and less than 10,000 people in
the entire county, only 50 miles from Louisville.
Q

Mr. Chenoweth, is the new district court going

36

to be countywide, or what is it going to be?
MR. CIIENOWETH:

The new district court with the

judicial amendment, it will be patterned after the judicial
districts as we now have with the circuit court, which is our
court of general jurisdiction.

We have the 120 counties in

the Commonwealth divided up now in 55 circuit judicial districts.
The district plan is to be placed on top of that.
The judicial amendment specifies that each county
shall be entitled to a district court, and this is the
problem we get into, at least a problem in terms of the way
this case has been framed, is that we do have multi-county
judicial districts, and there will be muLti-county district
court districts.

And the new amendment to our Kentucky

Constitution would say that each county

ls

entitled to a

And the county in which the district court

judge does not reside, he shall appoint a trial commissioner.
That section of the new amendment goes on further to say that
the trial

commissioner shall be an attorney if one is

*

available and qualified.
So, again we are back to the same situation much as
we find ourself before.

If every county is going to be

required to have a district court and there maybe is only one
or two attorneys in the entire county, one of these is
probably going to be the county attorney, one of them is going
to be possibly involved in the commonwealth attorney’s

37
office or some other manner such that he could not be—
obviously he could not be a judge.
Q

But the appointment of the trial commissioner

will be by a district judge in the first instance?
MR. CHENOWETH:

The district judge has the power of

appointing the trial commissioner—
Q

I gather though that if he appoints a layman,

the layman has to be approved by the chief justice of the
Court of Appeals; is that it?
MR. CHEEOWETIi:

I cannot really say that.

There

are so many things that have not been addressed with this.
The General Assembly of course is going to have to meet and
put some flesh on these bones that are in our amendment, and
of course our new State Supreme Court chief justice, he is
given quite a little bit of authority and he has a lot of
decision making to make in the next couple-*Q

What if a defendant with no money wants to

plead guilty and appeal and get a trial de novo; has he got a
problem on his hands?

Is there some fee involved?

MR. CHSNOWETH:

I do not believe so.

If he wants to

plead guilty, he can, and he will go right to the circuit
court.
Q

What does it cost him?

MR. CHENOWETII;

I do not know the cost, of that,

that it would take him to take his case from the police court

38

to—
0

My question is, Were there any substantial

barriers to his securing a constitutional trial, even
assuming that the layman is incompetent?
MR. CHENOWETH:

I do not know the cost figure, but

we do have—and I believe that the statute KRS 26.010 that
sets up the police courts, it gives the police courts con­
current jurisdiction with the circuit court, the court of
general jurisdiction that has a lawyer judge.
I believe that the individual who is accused in
police court, he can ask that that case be initially brought
in the circuit court.
Q

But he has no right to it.

MR. CHENOWETH:
Q

I believe that he does.

You and your colleague then differ.

MR. CHENOWETH:

Yes, that is correct.

I believe that

the statute is that there is concurrent jurisdiction,
Q

Let us assume that there is not, that he would

have to be either tried and found guilty or plead guilty.
Then my question is—which apparently you do not know the
answer to--how difficult it is for him financially to have a
trial de novo.
MR. CHENOWETH:

I cannot really tell you how

difficult it is, Mr. Justice White.
There has been raised the equal protection argument

39

in this case, but wa do not feel that there is an equal
protection argument in this case, which in part we have talked
about already in this argument.

And that is that our classifi­

cation is a classification of cities, and the police courts
are incidental to that constitutional clasiification of
cities.

All individuals who proceed through a court in a

particular class of city, have the same
to be treated the same.

He is going to be faced with that

non-lawyer judge, if that is the situation.
So, we have I think here clearly a situation that
has been recognized, that the equal protection clause
protects the people; and it does not necessarily go to a
geographical area, at least not in looking at situations as
we have here, which have to be recognized a.s being significantly
different from the situation dealing with the right to vote,
for example, where you do not necessarily look at geography
but everyone's vote should count the same nationwide.
We believe again that the Federal Constitution does
not explicitly require and that there .is no implicit
guarantee that an individual who is accused of a criminal
misdemeanor case for which imprisonment is a possibility,
that the constitution requires that that case be heard by a
lawyer judge.

Wa believe that the non-lawyer judge can in

the truth and fact-finding adversary process, that he can make
a fair decision.

And if he is not biased and if he is

40
neutral and detached, that he will in keeping with the due
process have a fair trial in a fair tribunal.
