MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

m will hoar arguments

naxt in Mo. 74-6521, Aldinger against Howard.
Mr. Rosenberg, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN ROSENBERG ON
BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. ROSENBERG:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

In 1966 this Court, in this case of United Mine

Workers v, Gibbs, clarified and explained the doctrine of
pendent jurisdiction.

In this lengthy and comprehensivo

opinion, the? Court referred to the joinder of claim, it did

.not refer to the joinder of parties specifically, and that
raises the issue that's before you today, and this issue is
this:

Whether the district court has the power to assert

pandent jurisdiction over claims,, state law claims, that are
appropriately related to existing Federal claims against a
n irty over when there is no independent basis of Federal
jurisdiction.

Now, since Gibbs, this issue —
QUESTIONs

Against whom no other claim is pending,

is that right?
MR. ROSENBERG: Yes, your Ho.; or, that is correct.
Ncv:, sine

Gibbs, this issue has arisen on a number

of occasions arid in many different «factual settings and context.

4
Now, the very simple facts of this case raise the
issue quit® clearly, and I would like to set them forth vary
briefly.
The petitioner was fired from her public position in
the County Treasurer's office.

The County Treasurer fired her

and than published in a letter -that her work was excellent
but that she had been living with her boyfriend.

The fact

that this is untrua is of no importance to this situation.
Obviously, though, these facts raised both federal and state
law.causes of action.
QUESTIONS

Would there clearly b© a cans© of action

>

*

under state law in Washington?
MR. ROSENBERGs
QUESTION s

¥©3, your Honor.

Against the county?

MR. ROSENBERG:

Against the county, yes, sir, because

under Washington law, the county is specifically liable for
the torts of its officers, agents, and employees.
The complaint filed in the district court asserted
federal jurisdiction over the federal claims against both
parties and state claim and asserted pendent jurisdiction ov-ar
the state claims that existed as well.
QUESTION:

If you look at the complaint, where was

a stats causa of action stated?

Referring to the appendix,

X couldn't find it.
MR. ROSENBERG:

Your Honor, that's on© of the things

5
I f®©X obligated to explain.
This complaint is not wall drafted.

There ar©

sufficient matters and sufficient allegations in it to raise
feh© state claims under appropriate rules of federal procedure.
QUESTION:

Where?

I read this carefully and I just

couldn't find a state cause of action stated.

If there isn’t

any# this question assertadly involved in this case doesn't
exist# do©s it?
MR. ROSENBERG:

If that's true# it doesn't exist, but.

it does exist.
QUESTION:

Where in the complaint?

MR, ROSENBERG:
this:

First of all# the state claims aro

In the appendix# the complaint is on page 12.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. ROSENBERG:

First of all# the State claims

are this intentional invasion of the petitioner's privacy# the
intentional infliction of motional distress, the tort of
libel# perhaps slander.
Now# 1st tm go through the complaint and show where
the allegations? are# your Honor.
First of all# the county is named.

That's in the

caption.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. ROSENBERG:

Secondly# the Treasurer is named as

a county official# and the county is being sued and the

6
Treasurer is being sued in his capacity as a county official.
Fourth# in paragraph 6# on page 14# it says#
•’Defendant Spokane County is a public corporation and an action
may be maintained against it#'8 and# of course# the complaint
asserts that pendent jurisdiction may rise.
QUESTION:

An action may ba maintained against it#

but where is any cause of action stated under State law?
MR. ROSENBERG:

Well# the list of State claims is

not there# but. sufficiant facts are available# your Honor# to
show that a claim is available against —
QUESTION:

If they ara and if the statuta of limita­

tions hasn't run# you are entitled to go back and file a
complaint stating a cause of action under State law# but I
can't find any stated her®.
MR. ROSENBERG:

Your Honor# under Civil Rule 8#

v
under notice pleadings# we have alleged enough facts — let ma
«wen list the facts for you.
QUESTION:

Will you identify the placa where we will

find them as we go along so we can mark it up?
MR. ROSENBERG:
on page 12.

Yes# your Honor.

In the appendix

All the facts in the record are in th® amended

complaint.
Now# what that amended complaint reflects is that
there was a firing# th© stated reasons for the firing# the
committing of the reasons # or the expression of the reasons —»

QUESTION %
ordinarily complaint

I ti'Ti sorry to interrupt you again, but an
mast do mors than reflect, it must allege,

is that not so?
MR. ROSENBERG:

Yes, sir.

The issue in this case is

whether the district court has the power to deal with this.
Now, the court had the power to cause us to amend
the pleadings.

He ecuId have dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6).

He could have entertained a motion to strike, a motion for a
more specific statement.

I submit that the power question 1?. ?.

threshold question that this Court must deal with before the
district court has the opportunity to help us straighten out
our complaint.
QUESTION:

Nell, the question that you say th® Court

must preliminarily deal with arises if and only if a cause of
actios is stated under states law.
MR. ROSENBERGs Yes, sir.
QUESTION:

You agree

MR. ROSENBERG:
QUESTION:

k

that.

Yes.

I just still have trouble seeing where, if

anywhere, is one stated.
iMR« ROSENBERG:

Your Honor, th® case of Connelly v.

Gibson would have to guide th® Court in that determination.
Of course, Connelly is concerned with a district court's
dismissal under Sul® 12(b)(6).

And if I could quote something

very briefly from Connelly, X think you will find that we have

8
stated sufficient facts to apprise the county of the. nature of
the claim against it,

Connelly states, on page 45, "In

appraising the sufficiency of a complaint,, we follow, of course,
the accepted rule that a complaint should not be dismissed for
failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that
the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his
claim which would entitle him to relief,”
QUESTIONs

Mr. Rosenberg., I notice in paragraph 1 of

your complaint, on page 12 of the appendix, and again in
paragraph 20, on page 15, you say that inasmuch as the plaintiff's
dismissal was authorized by 36.16 of the Revised Code of
Washington, that statute, on its face, is violative of
plaintiff's rights under the 1st and 14th Amendments.

Doesn't

that kind of militate against your contention that there was
a state law claim.
MR, ROSENBERGi

No, sir.

No state law, no local

ordinance, regulation, can empower anyone, a state official,
a county official, anyone else, to violate someone's civil
rights.
QUESTION;
statute that,

But if the State of Washington has a

as you say in your complaint, specifically

authorises a dismissal, it may be totally unconstitutional,
but can you consistently with that statute maintain that the
State courts would grant you Stats relief?
MR. ROSENBERGs

If a tort, was involved.

3
QUESTION:

I», the State courts, your cause of action

would b© a Federal cause of action because your claim would be
that the State law violates the Federal Constitution.
MR. ROSENBERGs

No, sir, your Honor.

You are ignoring

the State la*.- claim of libel, slander,, intentional infliction
of emotional distress —
QUESTION%

But that's not stated hare.

At least I

can't find it and so far you haven't pointed it out to me.
QUESTION:

Slander is certainly not mentioned.

MR. ROSENBERG:

Your Honor, I conced© that point,

but I also suggest very strongly that we can fix this complaint
i

up so that if has suitable
QUESTION:

New?

MR. ROSENBERG:
QUIVJTIGN:

State law claims.
You had plenty of time to do it.
Your Honor?

And you haven't.

MR. ROYE^BBBOs

This case is stayed in the district

court pending the outcome of the power question.

If that court

hathe powee to consider the State claims, I guarantee you
that hs will assist us to make them more clear to him.
QUESTION:

You mean you want the court to draw your

complaint for you?
MR. ROSENBERG:

No, sir, we will draw the complaint.

QUESTION:. I think you want us to do it.
MR. ROSENBERG:
with this issue.

No, sir, I would like you not to deal

I wculd like to get to the power question

10
that is before you.
Th© .district court dismissed all the claims against
Spokane County.

It dismissed the Federal claims in light of

Noor v - county of Alameda, and then it dismissed th® State law
claims simply by stating that it no longer had an independent
basis of Federal jurisdiction so it could not entertain them.
New, the district court recognized the problems that
it had and it dismissed th© State law claims without getting
to the merits of them in the way that it felt would be th©
clearest possibles way to point out the incongruity that exists
in th© Federal system.

Th® order of dismissal stated very

clearly that he did not get to the merits and that h© dismissed
solely because ho hasn't th© power, and he included th® rule
54(b) certificate and a certificate pursuant to 28 U.S. Code
1292(b).

Wb went directly to th© Court of Appeals for th®

Ninth Circuit who affirmed and certiorari by this Court was
granted,
Meanwhile, proceedings are stayed

in th® district

court*
Now, th® incongruity that the court tried to point
©•: t

that th© Gib,vs case :ai-tv: '-stxuad and misapplied in

two clearly opposing and exclusive ways.

The joinder of cle±

vary easily could contemplate the joinder of parties in a
number of casses and the majority of th® circuits and district
courts have held that.

In appropriate casas parties are

11
incidentally j oined.
Th© Ninth Circuit; however, has ruled that there is
absolutely no power to join parties, and these claims cannot
bo joined no matter what the circumstance, no matter hew
closely related to the Federal claims.
ThQ Ninth Circuit admits that support for its position
is eroding, and this Court pointed out in Moor v, County of
M-ant&da that th© Ninth Circuit stood virtually alon© in its
inflexible lack of power theory.
Well, the answer to this question is a difficult
on© and it requires this Court to put itself in the place of
th© district courts that contend daily with a very heavy
docket and a very larga ferial case load.
Th® answer that

What is the answer?

Iv. d:l trict courts have found in many cases

is to join all possible claims that are related to on© another
and try them all in on® suit and dispose of them simultaneously.
And pendent jurisdiction allows theta to do this, especially
pendent jurisdiction
QUESTION:

with respect to the joinder of parties.
Could you have sued all the parties that

you wanted to sue in the Superior Court of Spokane County?
MR. ROSENBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes, we could have, your.Honor.

You could have gotten all the relief in the

Washington Stato court system, I take it, that you could have
gotten in the Federal suit.
MR, ROSENBERG:

Sure, ws could have, your Honor.

But

12
the petitioner felt, and I agree, that it's unwise to su©
Spokane County and an officer of Spokane County in Spokane
County Superior Court.

She has given a Federal cause of

action and felt that, it would b© the wiser choice to makes.
QUESTION

Is tills not done every day of the week by

taxpayers and contractors suing in the State courts?
suggesting

Are you

some sort of conflict of interest, or some

lack of capacity on the State courts to deal with this kind of
problem?
MR. ROSENBERGs

No, sir, I am suggesting simply that

as a practical matter it was felt wiser not to sue ‘ Spokan®
County in Spokane County Superior Court.
QUESTION:

That doesn't tell m® very much.

MR. ROSENBERG:

I am afraid I cannot tell you more

than that, because I wasn't present at -that time.
I at this point will agree with the analysis.

I

feel that —- I agree with a number of studies that have been
mad© with' regard to the distinction between Federal and State
jurisdiction, and I feel that in Federal question cases there
is strong Federal policy to keep the cases In Federal court.
I would refer this Court to page 51 of the opening brief.
In the footnote fch-ar© t-:e
Institute study on

quotations from an American Law

the division of jurisdiction, and it gives

three very good reasons why Federal cases should be heard in
Federal court.

13
QUESTION?

Of course, under Judge Niell's ruling

your Federal case would bo held in Federal court.

If just

your State law claim, it wouldn't be heard there.
MR. ROSENBERG?

Yes, sir.

And judicial economy,

convenience ar-a the primary considerations that the Court
should consider when electing to join or not join pendent
claims or pendent, parties.
of discretioni
fit.

Pendant jurisdiction is a doctrine

the Court may or may not. join as it sees

And the reasons frequently cited are judicial economy,

convenience t© the parties, avoidance of piecemeal litigation.
There are a number of very good reasons.
QUESTION t

Bo you see any difference in the pendent

claim issue that was passed on in. Gibbs and the pendent
party issue, that is, where you already have all parties
properly before the Federal court to say w® will add a claim
by. on® against the other, because fchar® are already existing
Federal claims against them, and the pendant party situation
that you have bar© where the party is not her© in Federal
court by virtu® of any other Federal claim, indeed,by no
Federal claim at all.
MR. ROSENBERG:

That.83 correct, but I see no

significance in that distinction*
QUESTION:

I would suppos® the party would.

are talking about efficiency, that party wouldn't

If you
it might

-aks some sans© if h© is already there to say we ought to also

14
try otit some other claims arising out of the same transaction.
MR.ROSENBERG:

Your Honor, that party is there available

to he sued and will he sued in on® court or the other.

The

question is whether we will have two trials or on® of precisely
'and exactly the very same issue.

By State law the county

is liable for the torts of its officers.

That means that

the trial that w® are going to have over th® State claims
against the Treasurer «ire exactly 'the same trial we will have
over -th© State claims against the county, identical in every
way.
QUESTION:

In Washington .state courts, do you hav®

an intermediate court of appeals between your trial courts
and your Superior Court and the State Supreme Court?
MR. ROSENBERG: Y@s, sir.
QUESTION:

And the Supreme Court sits down at

Olympia?
MR. ROSENBERG: Yes, sir.
QUESTION:

When you are talking about 'judicial

economy and convenience of th© parties, I should think it would
he much more convenient to try a case out in Spokane,then go
down to Olympia on your-appeal than to com© all th© way h@r®.
MR. ROSENBERG:

Well, your Honor, we didn't

anticipate an appeal oa this procedural issue.
trying to get to

court for a long time.

We have been

Hie Federal court

and the County Superior Court are within six blocks of on©

15
another.

It is just as convenient for the county to go to one

or the other.
QUESTION:

But in the State court* you could try both

the Federal and the State claim together.
NR. ROSENBERG:

That's true.

There is no question

about that.
QUESTION:

So if you want to talk about one or two

trials* there is one place at least there is no question but
what you could have just one trial* that’s the State court.
MR. ROSENBERG:

Yes* sir.

Keep in mind* however,

that this doctrine arises not only in this particular case,
but it cuts across jurisdictional lines.

It comes up with

respect to virtually every jurisdiction granting basis of
Federal jurisdiction.
Federal.

And there are some that are exclusively

What happens in -those cases when the party cannot

go to State court?
In this case we happen to be able to.

But we made

a choice of forum that was open to us under the Federal and
State law.
QUESTION:

Wall, for your Federal issue it was.

MR. ROSENBERG: Yes, sir.
QUESTION:
State

You certainly couldn’t have brought the

issue to the Federal court independently.
MR. ROSENBERG:

That’s true.

At this point it’s probably important for me to recite

16
some of th-e considerations the courts have found in joining
pendent parties, not only claims but parties as well»
virtually every basis of Federal jurisdiction;, .

In

plaintiffs

and defendants have been joined in Federal question cases,
diversity cases, Taft-Hartley cases-—. Gibbs was a Labor-Management
Relations Act case — Federal Employer*s Liability Act cases,
SEC cases, civil rights cases, patent copyright cases,
admiralty cases.

No one could possibly foretell the combination

of Federal and State claims that will arise.

And that's why

pendent jurisdiction is the appropriate vehicle to deal with
this situation.

While the court has the power to join, it

doesn't have the obligation to join.

It may join if it feels

it appropriate.
Now, the Gibbs court set out an appropriate test that
is as appropriate now as it was then, and that test is this:
First of all, the court must consider the substance of the
claim.

Obviously if there is strong Federal policy to keep it

in Federal court, then the court could do that.

Are the State

claims such that they would confuse the issue?
QUESTION:

Mr. Rosenberg, let me just get something

sorted out in my mind.

How could there ever be a Federal policy

favoring keeping the State claim in the Federal court, because

is
by hypothesis your State claim/always one that could not be
brought in the Federal court in the first instance, at least
against a particular defendant that you are seeking to bring

17
into Federal court?
MR, ROSENBERG;
a slip.

Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens.

I made

I meant of the Federal cause of action, there is

strong Federal policy to keep some in Federal court, and in
others there is no strong Federal policy.

For example, in a

diversity basis of jurisdiction, it makes no difference whether
the Federal court keeps it or not because they are applying
State law.

In some Federal question cases there is exclusive

jurisdiction in the Federal court and it has to stay in
Federal court.
QUESTION:

Is it not correct that every situation

with which you ar© concerned would necessarily be the kind that
would be a common law or State law claim and the kind that
would be brought into Federal court only under diversity grounds
if there were diversity?
MR. ROSENBERG:

No, sir, not at all.

in virtually every jurisdiction granting
QUESTION:

This is really

basis of jurisdiction.

But not against the defendant whom you

cannot sue in Federal court.
MR. ROSENBERG:

That's true.

But there is a claim

against somebody who is appropriately and closely related to
the other defendant.

Now, we are in Federal court already.

There is an existing Federal claim.

The question is simply

may we join the appropriately and closely related State claims
and have one trial of all the issues that ar© raised on a set

18
of facts or two?
QUESTION;

If you prevail against fcha Treasurer

on th® Federal claim, would that same record entitle you to
prevail against th® county, I think you told us, on the State
claim because under Washington law the county is responsible
if its Treasurer is responsible?
MR. ROSENBERG:
responsible.

Is that right?

No, sir.

The county is not

Th® county may be liable.

We would have to

proceed against the county and sue them and try the case again.
QUESTION:

No, no.

I say if you can join the county

as pendent party here, then you would have only one record,
wouldn't you?
MR. ROSENBERG: Yes, sir, if we can join fch© county,
we would have -QUESTION;

The sarn@ record you relied on for recovery

against the Treasurer on th® Federal claim, is that right?
MR. ROSENBERG:
involved.

There is a Federal claim and there are separate

State claims.

Now, the State claims —

QUESTION:
th© same?

No, sir, there are different claims

I know, but would the evidence on both b©

*
MR. ROSENBERG:
QUESTION:

Oh, identical.

All right.

And if the evidence satisfied,

th® Federal claim would be against "whom?
MR. ROSENBERG;

The Federal claim is against the

19
Treasurer
QUESTION:

All right*

And the State claim would be

against the county, the employer?
MR, ROSENBERG:

No, sir.

There are State claims

against the Treasurer as well, and it's those State claims
against the Treasurer that are identical with the State claims
against the county.
QUESTION:

I s@©.

MR. ROSENBERG:

There is a separate Federal claim,

there are separate —■
QUESTION:

If you prevail on the State claim — rather,

the same evidence would entitle

you to prevail on both the

State and Federal claims against the Treasurer, is that it?
MR, ROSENBERG:

Very similar.

There are a few extra

ingredients in the Federal claim, but virtually identical.
QUESTION:

And then having a recovery against the

Treasurer on the State claim, does that also give you recovery
against the county?
MR. ROSENBERG;

Well, if the county was a party, yss,

because it is identical —
QUESTION:

Isn't that right?

And that's why you

want to make the county a party?
MR. ROSENBERG:
QUESTION:
to a 5 tat© claim.

Yes.

So the county would be a pendent party

20

MR. ROSENBERGs

Yes, sir.

Th© claim against the

county is a pandent claim, and by virtue of it being against the
county, the county is a pendent party.
QUESTION:

So you get fch® State issue in the Federal

court as a pendant issue under Gibbs.
MR. ROSENBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Then you want something pendent to that

State claim.
MR. ROSENBERG:

No, sir.

pendent to the Federal claim.
in th© Federal court,
QUESTION:

The State claim is to be

There are already State claims

the State claims against the Treasurer.
And they are pendant.

MR. ROSENBERG:

They are pendent to the Federal claim

against th© Treasurer.
Now, we also have State claims against the county
and they, too, should be pendent to the Federal claims.
QUESTION:

But how do we know that the evidence will

be identical, as you say, until we know what -those State claims
are?

For example, you mentioned the libel claim which you

haven't actually alleged in the complaint, which might require
proof of publication to third parties, which isn't part of your
Federal claim.

And each of your State claims might involve

som© fact not necessarily a part of your Federal claim, isn't
that true?
MR. ROSENBERG;

That's true, and you won't know that;

21
the district court will know that.
QUESTION %

In other words,, if it is part of your

burden to show that the evidence would be substantially identical,
you really haven’t done that until you have pleaded your State
claim, have you?
MR. ROSENBERG;

On the district court level, that’s

true, because the district court must make an inquiry and
determine if the case, if the two claims are reasonably related
and closely related sufficient for him to assume jurisdiction
over them.

He will make an inquiry in this regard.
QUESTION;

Can ha do that on this particular pleading?

MR. ROSENBERG;

Certainly not.

He can’t do it whether

this pleading is good or bad, because he doesn’t have the power
to do it and that’s what h© said in his order of dismissal.
He specifically refused to rule on the validity and whether
our State claims were suitable or not.

He can't do it whether

he wants to or not.
New, district courts in all the other circuits can
do it, but ha cannot.

And that's 'Che problem with this case.

How can a court make a decision like this?
of all, I submit, has to have the power.

The court,first
Once it has the power,

it has to make an inquiry and determine the natura of the
claims and whether they are suitably related.

And the Gibbs

court sets forth an appropriate test for relationship.
QUESTION;

Does h® take any directions at all from

22

tha complaint?
MR. ROSENBERG:

Yes, sir.

II© would read the complaint

to determine what fch© causes of action are.
QUESTION:

Again I ask you, where would he get fch©

State action out of that complaint?
MR. ROSENBERG:

Your Honor, I submit, and I admit,

that this complaint is not very well drafted.

X submit --

QUESTION: Then it should have been dismissed, which it
was dismissed.
MR. ROSENBERG:
QUESTION:

As a matter of fact, it was dismissed.

And h© said it was no good.

What are you

doing, confessing that?
MR. ROSENBERG:
1971.

No, sir.

The case was dismissed in

It went to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals—- it was

dismissed for failure to state a claim as well as abstention.
It went to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, was reversed
and remanded, because fcher© was a claim stated.
cf course, is referring to a Federal claim.

Now, that,

They didn’t get

to tha validity of tha State claim.
But fch© district court can straighten out this
complaint.

He can order ns to amend it.

He can dismiss it if

he wishes..

He can do anything he 'wants with it.

But. at this

point he doesn’t even have fch© power to consider it.
QUESTION:

It would only be a coincidence, even though

a high probability that the Federal district judge sitting on

23
the case would be a judge familiar with Washington law.

It

might be a judge from on© of the other States in the circuit
there very easily -

Here you have been back and for tlx, I don't

know exactly how many times, and I take it the same six blocks
from the Federal court to the State court works the other way
and you could have put a new caption on this complaint and
proved the complaint as you suggest, walked down the street
and action probably would have long sine© been. over.
MR, ROSENBERG;
QUESTION;

We could have done that.

Meanwhile you have been a very large

statistic on the Federal court systems for quite a long time.
MR. ROSENBERG;

Well, if the case wasn’t dismissed

in th© initial round of pleadings, we would have been over
four years ago.

Yes, we could have tried it in the State court,

but in terms of election of remedies that ar© available to us,
w© selected in the Federal court,

QUESTION;

I am speaking of th© time when it appeared

that your only claim was a State claim, and I submit to you
that’s the time it should have been in th© State court and
ever sine© then.
MR. ROSENBERG;

Your Honor, with ail due respect,

there has never been a time that there was only a State claim.
There has always been a Federal claim against the County
Treasurer.

There has always bean that claim, except when it

QUESTIONS

I did not say only a Stat.® claim, I said

a State claim, because, as Mr. Justice Whit® suggested, State
courts are enforcing Federal claims every day in the week.
MR. ROSENBERG:
not before the Court.

Your Honor, of course, this issue is

Th® fact is we are in Federal court and

whether the Federal court can pend State claims to it or not,
whether they hav© the power to do that is th© only issue.
f

>

■

L©t me be as clear as I can.

We are not asking this

Court to rule teat th® district court must hear th® Stat®
claims,but simply that fch© district court has th© power to hear
them, and if it wishes to in the exercise of its discretion,
it will do that.

I feel confident that w© can go back before th®

district court and convince them, that it8 s an .'Important thing
to do.
QUESTION:

In fch© Moor case that wasn't the outcome,

was it?
MR. ROSENBERG:
QUESTION:

No, sir, this Court found --

You could prevail here and still lose

ultimately.
MR. ROSENBERGs
QUESTION:

Yes, that’s true, we could.

How many courts of appeals agree with you

on pendent parties?
MR. ROSENBERG: ' Th© District of Colurabia, the First,
Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth.
QUESTION:

So averyon© agrees with you except the

25
Ninth?
MR. ROSENBERG:

No, th© Ninth has ruled on it and

disagrees vary vehemently.
QUESTXQN;

The Seventh Circuit ~

All agree with you except th© Ninth

because it has ruled on it.
MR. ROSENBERG;

Th© Seventh doesn8t.

Th® Sevens

has ruled on it only once and really didn't give it suitable
treatment.
QUESTION;

Is that in th© Hampton case?

MR. ROSENBERG;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

And that3s understandable.

The Court of Appeals has ruled against you

here?
MR. ROSENBERG;

Yes, th® Ninth Circuit Court of

Appeals.
QUESTION;

Yes.

So they are th© only circuit against

you?
MR. ROSENBERG;

Y©s, sir, and tlie Seventh as well.

And the Seventh.

MR. ROSENBERG;

All right.

I would lik® to read something from a

very recent First Circuit Court of Appeals opinion in conclusion.
Th© First. Circuit Court of Appeals was dealing with a case that
had a virtually interminable history in the Federal court system.
It had been appealed a number of times, was exceedingly complex,
multiple parties, multiple issues, and at the conclusion of
the Court of Appeals treatment of it, they said this:

This .

26
case is one where if there had not existed a doctrine allowing
Federal jurisdiction over pendent parties, it would have had
to be invented.

There are a number of cases where —-

MR, ROSENBERG:

I think .in order to sort it all out.

I think he was referring to the problems that would exist if

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD C. BROCKETT ON
BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. BROCKETT:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice

and Msmbars of

The difficulty that the Court is having with the

complaint in this case and with the allegations contained
therein are some of the problems that the county had with being
joined as a party or th® attempt to join the county as a party
in the Federal district court in Spokane County.

And further,

it would bo our contention, as it has been in th® brief that
v@ filed with this Court, that if -this Court gets beyond the
complaint to a realization that there is in fact a State
claim which has been alleged that could be pendent to a Federal
claim under the civil rights action, that it should then

27
seriously reconsider the doctrines of pendent and

ancillary

jurisdiction to determine whether or not this may not he part,
of the problem with the Federal court systems and with the
numbers of cases that axe filed in the Federal court systems
at the present day.
On© of the admissions, I think, by counsel her© is
that the cas© could well have been filed in til© Superior Court
of Spokane County,on th® basis of the State claims if there
were any and on the basis of th© Federal claim of violation of
the Federal Civil Rights Act.
QUESTION:

Do you know of any cas® ev©r filed in

a trial court of your State stating a cans© of action under
42 United States Code 1983?
MR. BROCKETT:

I don't think I know of any particular

actions, your Honor, that have bean filed in Stat® courts, but
I think it's because of the fact that counsel representing
individuals in civil rights cases feel, as counsel stated hare,
that it's wiser to file those cases in Federal court.
QUESTION:

There is a specific jurisdictional statute,

28 United States Code 1343 conferring Federal district court
jurisdiction over such a cause of action.

Would a State

court in Washington as a matter of its jurisdiction under th©
law of th® State have jurisdiction over a cause of action
stated under 42 United States Code 1983?
MR. BROCKETT:

I don't believe, your Honor, that that

28
particular- section of the United States Cod© gives exclusive
jurisdiction.
QUESTION:
Volume 42o

That section doesn't give any jurisdiction,

Volume 28, 1343 gives jurisdiction to the Federal

court, not exclusively nor unexclusively, it just gives Federal
jurisdiction.
MR. BROCKETTs
QUESTION:

Federal jurisdiction, that's correct.

I just wondered if your State courts,

trial courts, have jurisdiction over a cause of action brought,
stated under 1983 of Volume 42.
MR. BROCKETTs

We believe that they would have the

jurisdiction with the Federal court in order to hear that
particular case.
QUESTION s

Do you know of any case brought in th®

State ““
MR. BROCKETTs

No, not specific cases, because again

of the choice by counsel in filing in Federal district court.
QUESTION:

It generally is to bring it into the

Federal district court.
MR. BROCKETTs

Now, the attempt in this particular cas©

and I think again this is the poorest ease for this Court to be
deciding the matter of pendent jurisdiction in attaching a
State claim to a Federal claim,

because of the fact that the

complaint itself alleges an absence of a State claim.
as this Court has noted, tee Revised Code of Washington

In fact,
36.16.070

29
specifically provides that the Treasurer of Spokane County, as
any other elected official of Spokane County, has the discretion
to discharge at pleasure an employe»©, and what, counsel is asking
in this case, what petitioner is asking, is that the particular
statute when and if it is ruled to be unconstitutional or to
have been applied in an unconstitutional manner would then
creat® a State claim against the county for the action of the
Treasurer and would then ask that that State clam b© mad©
pendent to the Federal cause of action which has been filed
under the Federal Civil Rights Act,
The difficulty that the county expresses her® is much
the same as the difficulty expressed by this Court in Moor v.
County of Alameda, that there is to b© a system of federalism,
that there is to be a distinction between the State and the
Federal courts, and that as Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I believe,
said in a recent opinion, if such an extension of pendent
jurisdiction as this would allow to bring into the case an
additional party that this Court has held should not. b@ a person
under the Federal Civil Rights action, that that would only
call for an ingenious counsel to datermina that there was a
Federal question and then determine that there should be
pendent jurisdiction over any State claim that might be thought
to exist and therefore would go into the Federal court system.
The questions of jurisdiction are questions, of course,
of constitutional law and it has beeA determined and it has been

30
written specifically in Article III, section 2 of the
Constitution

that the Federal courts are courts of limited

jurisdiction.

Many of the writers on the extension of pendcmt

jurisdiction and ancillary jurisdiction and the confusion between
tli© two doctrines have indicated, and the county would propose
here, that the Federal court system is becoming a system of
general jurisdiction by means of the us© of pendent jurisdiction
to allow the joining of State claims in particular cases.

And

it is ©specially an extension which I do not believe this Court
wishes to exercise in this case because it would join a
party which has specifically been held not to Jo© a pcirson under
the Civil Rights Act.
The problems created by the extension of pendent
jurisdiction ar© many and have been mentioned in various
writings,

And I think this Court should certainly consider

those problems.

Number one, the major problem, is that if th®

State court in considering a question of Federal law should
err in interpreting the Federal law, then it can b© corrected
on review by this Court.

However, if the Federal district court

would arr in interpreting a State law, that particular question
is not subject to review by the State courts, and therefore
this Court should consider that question and fore© these causes
of action to b© triad on th© basis of State claims in State
courts with an appropriate review by this Court or other Federal
courts»

QUESTIONS

What you just said is true with respect to

any diversity case, isn’t it?
MR, BROCKETTs
QUESTIONS

That's true, your Honor, but I think -..

sometimes can b© frustrated

by the feict if h© is pulled on the Federal side, he just can’t
get a definitive State ruling on the issue.
MR. BROCKETT:

That's correct, your Honor.

But th®

diversity case, 1 would contend to you, is a different situation
than the Federal question case

and th® allowing of the expansion

of th© Federal question case by pendent jurisdiction.

Diversity

is specifically granted to the Federal courts on th© basis of
the idea historically that an individual who was a citizen of
another State could not get a fair trial by coming into that
particular State.

There is some questioning of that particular

doctrina at the present time because of the movement of society
in the present day and the fact that there are many lawsuits
that era brought in local jurisdictions that are in fact
holding police officers liable for their conduct, and I would
warrant in this particular case if the facts warrant it, would
hold th® Treasurer _and the county liable for any tortious
conduct.
h

QUESTION: ;

,

which was reported in 1969

?

rather disparages this less valid idea about New Englanders
getting a bad deal in -some other jurisdiction, and vie© versa,
ar® they not?

32
MR. BROCKETT£

That is correct, your Honor.

I think

that's something for this Court to consider in determining
whether or not in fact the diversity problem hasn't crept into
the Federal question problem.
QUESTIONS

Well, this Court can't do anything about the

diversity jurisdiction.

Only Congress can do that.

You are

suggesting w© can do something about pendent jurisdiction cases,
MR. BROCKET!6s
QUESTION5

Ye3 .

And ancillary jurisdiction.

MR. BROCKETS

Yes, and what I am suggesting is this

Court go back historically to the Constitution and determine
that the Federal courts should have province and power only
over cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the
United States or diversity cases, which as your Honor has
said they can do nothing about.

I think it is ridiculous for

the doctrine of ancillary or pendent jurisdiction to have
allowed an extension and to in effect fill up the Federal courts
with questions that should be better heard in State courts.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Brockett, you certainly don't need

any broad doctrine lik© that to prevail her© on your case, do
you?

All you are saying is that the principles that give

this topendent claim shouldn't be extended by this Court to a
new class of pendent parties.
MR. BROCKET!s

What we are saying, your Honor, is that

specifically this Court should refuse to go any further than

33
it has or in fact may wish to retreat from the position that
it took in Moor v. County of Alameda and determine in fact that
there should not even ha a pendent jurisdiction over claims
even though between the same parties.
QUESTION:

And overrule Gibbs.

MR. BROCKETT:
QUESTION;

Yes, and overrule Gibbs»
?
And Hearn v. Guslar, too?

MR. BRQCKETT:

And Hearn v. Ousler and the other casas

which this Court has decided.

I would refer to a phrase which

I found in briefing for this case that I thought was of
interest fro® Mr. Justice Holmes in which h© once said, "In my
opinion, the prevailing doctrine has been accepted upon a
subtle fallacy that never has been analysed.

If I am right,

the fallacy has resulted in an unconstitutional assumption of
powers by the courts of the United States which no lapse of
time or respect;able, array of opinion should make us hesitate
to correct."
Now, what I would say on the basis of that is that
ancillary jurisdiction -QUESTION:

What is the citation of that paper?

MR. BROCKET!':
a case.

I ara sorry, your Honor, it isn’t from

It's from a speech of Mr* Justice Holmes.
QUESTION:

But it didn’t have to do with this subject,

did it?
MR. BROCKETT:

No, it didn't.

It wasn’t on the

34
question.
QUESTION:

It's a rather famous work.

MR. BROCKETT: It was just the question of whether or
not fch® Court should reanalyze its opinions and retreat from
them if it's warranted.

QUESTION:

Yes„

MR. BROCKETT:

I think that this Court should find

that ancillary jurisdiction certainly has a role to play in the
Federal jurisdictional scheme of things.

Ancillary jurisdiction

in its proper role is the jurisdiction of the court to hear
those matters which are ancillary to the causa before the court
on fch© basis of the defendant who is an unwilling party to the
action, who has been brought into the action,, and decides that
h® wishes to raise a matter which is within then the ancillary
jurisdiction of ‘fch© court.
The pendent jurisdiction problem, however, whether it.
extends to claims as it was extended in this Court by Moor v.
County of Alameda, or more importantly, whether it extends to
parties who are not properly a party to the particular action,
as we allege the County of Spokane is not in this case, the
court should distinguish between those doctrines, and we would
submit should overrule the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction and
not allow it within the Federal courts.
The doctrine has created problems in this 'regard.

Thermtorn Products,. Inc, y. Hermansdorfer,ruled that once a
case has been removed to the Federal district court, that
district court has jurisdiction of the case and that in fact
the Court, was somewhat split on the determination as to whether
or not that jurisdiction could be given up .and the cas© could
ha sent back to the State court because of the crowded docket
of the Federal district court.

Th<® issue in that case was whether or not

the district court's order to remand is reviewable.

QUESTION:

They say one did exist, as ray brother Whit©

MR. BROCKETT:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

And if you look at page 20 in the record

th© district judge is dismissing, saying, "Nor has this court
power to exercise pendent jurisdiction over th® claims against
Spokane County."
MR. BROCKETT:

Yes, and those claims were just claims

that were assumed to ba existent for th® purpose of determining
whether th® court had power to even hear the cas®.

That's

why th® cas® cam® to this Court on th© basis of th® Ninth

QUESTIONs

Mr. Brocketfc, you read th® Ninth Circuit,

as did th® district court, as holding that there is no power and
not merely that it would ba an abuse of discretion to exercise
th® power that existed?
MR. BROCKETT:

That's correct.

In fact, in this

particular case, if the case is sent back from this Court,
goes back to th© Federal district court, he may still exercise
the discretion not to hear th© case.
QUESTION:

I understand that as to th© district, but

that’s the way you read th© Court of Appeals also as going off
on power.

I found the opinion a little bit ambiguous.
MR. BROCKETT:

No, I think the Ninth Circuit Court
%

does in fact, as this Court has said before, virtually stands

38
a Iona in determining ‘chat the pendent jurisdiction may not be
extended to pendent parties, and that's the determination to
bs mad© in tills c&s© if this Court determines that this is an
appropriate case in which to maIce that determination itself*
We would contend that the doctrine of removal, that
the doctrines of abstention and certification by the Federal
district court are doctrines that have in fact grown up as a
result of th© fact that fch© courts do not want to exercise
jurisdiction over the State law claims and -that, they themselves
feel that these claims should b© better placed in the State
courts, that the State courts should make State law, that if
that law then is in derogation of Federal rights, that it will
bs ruled upon by th© Federal courts and will be appealed to
this particular court.

Otherwise, th© States should have the

right to ml© on their own State law.

And as th® Chief

Justice has mentioned, because of the court dockets that are
very crowded, the court judges ar© required to move around
and may well be in a State in a diversity case, for example,
and not b© that familiar with th© State law.

The Federal court

ruling upon th® question of State law may b® looked to by a
State legislature to give some guidance to it when in fact
the Stata legislature should not be looking to the Federal
court’s determination.

That determination should be mad©

properly by a State court with a review under our constitutional
system and system of federalism by th© Federal courts.

39
The petitioner in this eas© in his raply brief has
indicated that it is absurd for the respondent to contend that
tills extension of the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction is
being used to extend the scop© of a 1983 action, section 1983
of tii© United States Cod©.

We would contend that that’s not

so absurd when one looks at 15 Am. Jur.Trials 620, at
section 27, which states this:
for two purposes:

Pendent jurisdiction is used

One, to try common law or statutory tort

claims against individual defendants sued under section 1983,
and, two, to bring th© city or other entity into fch® action
thus avoiding in part the holding of Monroe v. Pape that
cities ar® not suable under section 1983.
We would contend that that's exactly whafc’s happening
in th® Federal court system, that by fch@ us© of th# doctrine
of pandent jurisdiction and by an imaginative pleading or an
imaginativ© party, a Federal cause of action is filed, and
then th® party attempts to apply for the pendent jurisdiction
over th© Stata law claim, which should not be thor©.
We would ask that this Court determine that there
is no power,as the Ninth Circuit has said, to entertain under
pendent jurisdiction ©specially additional parties.

That if

there is power and if there is discretion, then, for the court
to hear or not to hear on th® basis of that power, what kind
of a rule will there fo® that will be established throughout th©
country upon which all lawyers and courts can base some

40
consideration in a determination of the application of pendent
jurisdiction?

If it’s to be based upon discretion, will it

not have to be on a casa-by-ce.se basis?

And if the discretion

is exercised on a ca3©-by-case application, than how is there
any rule to \hich one can refer?
The other difficulty is that if w© are attempting to
save judicial time and energy in adopting th® doctrine of
pendent jurisdiction, how will there be a saving of judicial
time and energy if th© court has to determine on a case-by-ease
basis in the Federal system whether or not the application
of pendent jurisdiction and that doctrine is appropriate in
that particular case and will it not require review by this
Court on a casa-by-case basis as to th® exercise of 'that
discretion?

.

\

If the fairness is what’s to be considered, than
:1s there a fairness to th® defendant who has a, right to be
sued in the State court on th© basis of the State law claim
and have that State law claim determined by the State court
if th© action can be joined on th© basis of pendent jurisdiction
even though he was not a proper party to th© Federal question
filed in the district court?
QUESTIONS

If you sue th© Treasurer and th©'County

in the State court, th® County on State law claims and the
Treasurer on Federal claim

and a State claim, and the

Treasurer removed to th® Federal court, do you -think th© whole

41
case could com© to the Federal court?
MR. BROCKETT:

I think that that might well be a

determination for the Federal district judge at that point.
QUESTIONS

What do you think the statute means?

It says the antir© eas© may be removed.
MR. BROCKETTs

I think that that might very appropriately

bring the entire case into the Federal system, but it would b@
by virtue of a moves of fch© defendant as opposed to a move of
th® plaintiff.
QUESTION?

So there is a power question.

MR. BROCKETT:

I think it’s a power question when

we look at it on th® basis of th© filing by the plaintiff and
tli® attempt by him to join an additional party or an additional
claim under pendent jurisdiction.

But I think that that power

question is better resolved -—
QUESTION:

It couldnst be a question, then, if fch©

whole cas® were removable.

I’m not suggesting that it is, but

if it were wholly removable and th® Federal court could handle
it, it wouldn’t b© a jurisdictional issue.
MR. BROCKETT:

Wall, your Honor, I would submit this,

that that is the proper application of th© doctrine of
ancillary jurisdiction as opposed to what should b© distinguished
in considering that jurisdiction from pendent jurisdiction.
That is th© proper doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction in which
fche defendant has chosen to remove and th© defendant who is in

42
tli© court then asks 'that there b© a jurisdiction by a proper
joinder even -though of another party V7hc he feels is liable
rather than himself.
The 28 United States Code 1338(b) which appears to
be argued as an extension by Congress of pendent jurisdiction
over patent and copyright cases, the county would allege in
this case, has been the only extension of that doctrine by
congressional authority and that the other extension of
pendent jurisdiction has been a court-created doctrine which
this Court should carefully consider and raced® from so that
cases will be appropriately filed in the State courts, the
determinations will b© made under State law, and then if there
is some difficulty with Federal question or the Federal
constitutional application, it will come into the Federal courts
only upon that basis.
