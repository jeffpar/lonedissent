PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Ernst & Ernst against Hochfelder.
Mr. Berner, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. BERNER, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BERNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The basic issue in these cases is whether Rule 10b-5
is to be turned into a national negligence statute affecting
all conduct in any way touching on the purchase or sale of a
security.
This issue is presented in the Petition for Certiorari
as "Whether Respondents may predicate a cause of action against
Petitioner for aiding and abetting violations of Section 10(b)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 there­
under, on allegations and proof of negligence alone, or whether
there must be alleged and proved something more than negligence,
soma fraud, some knowledge of the fraud, or some reckless or
willful conduct tantamount to fraud."
There are three other issues in this case which are
important to the Petitioner and the Respondents, because a
disposition of ^uiy one of them can dispose of this litigation;
and they are:
Whether Ernst & Ernst, aa a matter of law, audited

4
First Securities with all due diligence;
Whether the Respondents' conduct is such as to estop
them from bringing their claims against Ernst & Ernst; and
Whether the Respondents can avoid the bar of the
statute of limitations.
These issues, of course, are best understood in the
context of the facts, which briefly are that First Securities
was a small broker-dealer in Chicago.
B. Nay.

It was owned by Leston

The Respondents, for many years, were regular

securities customers of First Securities, and, as such, in
their regular securities transactions, received all of the
f

documentary paraphernalia that a securities customer ordinarily
receives.

They would receive purchase of sale forms, confirma­

tion of sales, accountaing3; all the documents that emanate
from a broker-dealer.
Most or all of the Respondents were also friends, or
had soma personal or social relationship with Nay or with
Mrs. Nay, and, as a result, Nay was able to persuade the
respondents to invest in what he called an escrow.
Ha told them that he had befriended a small loan
company that was required by law to maintain a cash escrow.
Their investments would be perfectly safe, and that it paid
12 pereant interest in some cases, 9 percent in the other.
Of course, the escrow was fictitious, and there was
no small loan company; but these people paid their fund3 to

5
Nay by personal checks made payable to him personally.

And

he evidenced the investments, the escrow investments, by
personal notes of his or by letters.

All, however, on

correspondence coming from — or on the letterhead of First
Securities Company.
None of the transactions involving this escrow ever
were reflected on the books and records of First Securities.
The Respondents conducted all of their transactions with respect
to the excrow with Nay personally, as compared with the trans­
actions they had when dealing with First Securities as regular
securities cus tomera.
The Petitioner, Ernst & Ernst, was the auditor of
First Securities from sometime in the middle Forties until
1967.

The Respondents' relationship with First Securities as

regular securities customers and as escrow investors began
in the early Forties in some cases and continued up until 1968.
In Jane of 1968, Nay's

Ponzi

scheme caught up

with him and he shot and killed himself.
QUESTIONs
MR. 3ERNER:

He killed his wife fijrst, didn't he?
Yes, sir.

Shot and killed his wife and

then killed himself.
That was, I believe, June 6, 1968.
The SEC, within a day or two, initiated a receiver/

ship proceeding, which is still pending.

And the Respondents

have made their claims in that receivership proceeding.

6
But in 1971 they sued Ernst & Ernst under Section
10(b) and Rule 10b-5, claiming that Ernst & Ernst caused their
loss.
QUESTION: Does the record show that in every trans­
action for the excrow account the checks were paid to Nay
/sic/

personally and not to First Trust?
MR. BERNER:

Yes, sir.

In the litigation against Ernst & Ernst, there were
a number of depositions taken of all of the people connected
with Ernst s Ernst's audit, with the audit by Ernst & Ernst.
The documents in Ernst & Ernst's possession relating to their
audits over 25 years, such as they still had, were examined by
the Respondents, and than a motion for summary judgment was
filed and granted in favor of Ernst & Ernst in the District
Court, on the grounds that Ernst & Ernst's conduct in the
audits was blameless.
The. District Court also found that the statute of
limitations barred these claims, and found that the Respondents'
own conduct acted as estoppel.
That summary judgment was appealed to the Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which reversed, finding that
there could be a genuine issue of material facts as to whether
or not Ernst £ Ernst's conduct in connection with the audit
might have been negligent, and they pointed to two transactions.
two types of conduct:

7
One, it was the existence of a mail procedure at
First Securities; and the other was an allegation that Nay did
not take regular vacations»
With respect to the — let's refer to it as the "mail
rule".

1 should explain it. That was simply an office procedure

at First Securities, which provided that all mail delivered to
First Securities, addressed to an individual, to his attention
or to him personally, would be delivered to him, put on his
desk.

Nay, being the owner and president of —
QUESTION:
MR. BERNER:

Put on his desk, unopened?
Unopened, yes, sir.

According to the record, in the affidavit of John
Walsh, of Haskins & Sells, that procedure existed at substanti­
ally all the brokerage houses — wall, most of the brokerage
houses in Chicago at that time, and probably most of them in
the country.
Nay, however, had an additional provision, which
restricted anyone else at the office from opening his mail.
As a result, when he was not in the office, his mail was not
opened.
The Court of Appeals found that this could create an
issue of fact as to whether or not Ernst & Ernst audited
diligently, and they reversed.

And in doing so, the Court of

Appeals announced a standard for aiding and abetting liability
under 10b-5 —

8

QUESTION:
MR. BERNER:
QUESTION:

Mr. Berner.
Yes, sir?
Is the term "aiding and abetting" a

familiar one to members of the security bar?
MR. BERNER:

It's becoming familiar.

QUESTION: Where did it come from?
MR. BERNER:

It comes from the — I think it comes

from the criminal law originally, yet it —
QUESTION:
MR. BERNER:

How does it get over into the civil law?
Well, I think it first came over in

Fischer vs. Klstz, a case in the Southern District in the late
Sixties, and in the Seventh Circuit in Brennan vs. Midwestern
Insurance; the Seventh Circuit adopted the analogy.

I believe

it comes over because usually an aider and abetter has very
little if anything to do with the fraud and very little
knowledge, if any, usually no knowledge of the fraud.

But

it's a term which someone has given substantial assistance,
a knowing assistance in connection with some wrong.

And it's

bean imported from the criminal law and there's some old SEC
administrative decisions which use the concept.
But it is not a well-known concept yet in the
securities law.
The standard that the Seventh Circuit adopted is a
negligent standard.

It leaves no room for — at least it does

not require any element of scienter; that is, any element of

9

knowledge of the fraud, of reckless conduct tantamount to fraud.
It's a pure negligence standard.
And, as such, —
QUESTION:

Negligent aiding and abetting?

MR. BERNER:

Yes, sir, negligent aiding and

abetting, and it is, I believe, the first case in the federal
jurisprudence — I'm certain it's the first case in the
securities laws — that adopts that standard, that a person can
negligently aid and abet a securities violation under lQb-5 or
other violations«
The Ninth Circuit has adopted a standard which does
not require th® element of scienter, although the case in
which they adopted it clearly had that element.
But the majority of the Circuits, the Second, Fifth,
Sixth and Tenth Circuits at least, who have specifically
addressed themselves to the question, have required something
more than negligence in terms of culpability, for liability
in a private ironey damage action under Rule 10b-5.
And those Circuits are correct, I believe, if the
statute and th* legislative history and the reasoning behind
those is looked at.

As Mr. Justice Powell pointed out in

his concurring opinion in Blue Chip, when the language — when
a statute is being construed, the place to start is the language
of the statute.
Rule 10b-5 speaks of manipulative and deceptive

10

devices.

That's not clear what that is, but that certainly is

fraud language.

That's not blameless language or negligent

language that talks of fraud.

And the Rule also is replete

with words of fraud.
In fact, Professor Loss has commented, and Judge
Friendly in the Second Circuit, have each stated that if the
rule, if Rule 10b-5 is held to encompass merely negligent
conduct, it goes beyond the mandate of the section in which it
draws its life.
QUESTION:
MR. BERNER:
QUESTION:
MR. BERNER:

Where did (b)(2) come from?
(b) (2) —
That's (b)(2) in this case.
Well, Clause (b)(2) in Rule 10b-5?

Well, I believe that all of Rule 10b-5 was drafted
at the same time, in the early 1940's, by the SEC.

Now, there

is similar language in the Investment Company Act.

The SEC

points to some New York corporation law as perhaps suggesting
the language.
QUESTION:

But (b)(2) doasn't refer — it doesn't

have that fraud language.
MR. BERNER:
QUESTION:
MR. BERNER:
at all.

No, it doesn't, and it —
So where did —
— it doesn't have language as fee fault

It simply speaks of a misrepresentation or an omission.
But I believe the proper view of the three clauses

11
of 10b-5 is that they get to basically the same kind of
behavior.
In this Court's case in Capital Gains Research in
this —
QUESTION2

But, part of your submission, then, that

(b)(2) just isn't within the reach of — if it's construed
this way, not to require scienter of any kind, that it just
isn't authorized by the statute?
MRo BERNER:

Yes, sir.

The legislative history, of course, is not conclusive.
Nowhere does it conclusively say that Section 10(b) requires
something more than negligence.

But it gets near to that,

because a reading of the legislative history makes it clear
that these provisions in the securities laws are designed to
get to dishonest behavior.

The phrases, "honesty in the market­

place", "high ethical standards", those phrase permeate the
legislative hi£3tory.
It is, I think, absolutely clear from the legislative
history that these Acts are not designed to get to the competence
of somebody,'bat his honesty.

And that certain abuses that —

again in Capital Gains Research, that Mr. Justice Goldberg
points to are abuses of honesty.
QUESTION: Do you suggest that the statute deals in
terms of affirmative-action .rather than omissions?
MR. BERNER:

No, I believe it deals in terms of both

12
affirmative actions and omissions.

An omission can be as

culpable as an affirmative action.
The standard which the majority of the Circuits urge,
and which we support, would not constitute a retreat to 1934,
when the Act was drafted. It would not require a retreat to all
common law elements of fraud, as we understood them at that
time.

We’re speaking only of the level of cuplability, and

this would not affect the direction that this Court and other
courts have taken on the other elements which
10b-5 action:

constitute a

elements of reliance, materiality, causation,

and the like.
We submit that requiring something more than
negligence in terras of culpability would simply be a continu­
ation of the direction that Rule 10b-5 and Section 10(b) has
been taking, aid would prevent an abrupt change in direction
which endorsement of the Seventh Circuit’s opinion would
constitute.
With respect to Ernst & Ernst's conduct, even if a
simple negligence standard were permitted for Rule 10b-5, it
is clear, we submit, on the record that as a matter of law
Ernst & Ernst conducted its audit of First Securities with all
due diligence.

Ernst & Ernst's duties to audit First

Securities was to audit in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards.
And the uncontroverted evidence, the affirmative

13

evidence in this case is unequivocal, it is to the effect that
Ernst & Ernst conducted its audit in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards.
The evidence submitted by the Respondents is evidence
that goes to the question of whether or not First Securities
Company maintained high internal accounting controls, strong
internal accounting controls.
issue.

But, of course, that's not the

Whether or not a company has strong or weak internal

accounting controls is not determinative of whether or not an
auditor audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.
The internal accounting controls are controls
arrangement procedures within a company, that are designed to
insure that company that its assets and liabilities are
correctly reflected on the books and records.

And if a company

has strong controls, the auditor then has more confidence in
them, and need not extend his procedures unduly to confirm that.
If the controls are weak, he ha3 to engage in more procedures.
But whether or not they are strong or weak<j is not
determinative of whether the auditor audits correctly.
QUESTION:

Well, the Respondents had a couple of

affidavits that -- and I thought that the mail rule would have
surely alerted auditors to do more than Ernst 6 Ernst did here.
MR. BERNER:

Well, I think that the Respondents have

submitted three affidavits.

One is by a man named Michael

14
Garst, who is a retired National Bank Examiner.
QUESTION: Well, can we really parse this kind of a
thing on — whan it*s simply a reversal of a motion for summary
judgment in the Seventh Circuit, as to whether the affidavits
did or did not make out a conflict on the question of proper
audit; or isn't it more logical for us to concentrate on the
negligence versus something more issue?
MR. BERNER:

Well, that is an

issue that, as I

mentioned in the beginning, the question of negligence or not
can also win this case for Ernst & Ernst; and, as a result,
at least in those terms, that it's quite important for Ernst &
Ernst.
And I believe that a reading of the three affidavits
submitted by the Respondents makes it fairly clear that the
Respondents — two of the three are auditors; one is not an
auditor.

Of the two auditors, one has never audited a brokerage

house, but he at least is an auditor.
And they say that as a matter -- it's a matter of
personal opinion that they express, that they would do — one
says, "would employ additional audit procedures if you found
this rule".
Well, of course, he hasn't reviewed the system at
First Securities like the affiants whose affidavits are
submitted on behalf of Ernst & Ernst did; and they know what the
system was, and they know what procedures were there.

And, as

15
a result, they say, even taking into account the mail rule, the
audit was conducted with all due diligence and in accordance
with generally accepted auditing standards.
The other response —- the Respondents' affidavits
simply say:

taking the mail rule by itself, they would consider

that a possible weakness, and they may do something, they may
employ additional procedures or not; but they don't get to the
question.

And the question is:

did Ernst & Ernst audit in

accordance with generally accepted auditing standards?
Now, even more than that, the Respondents have
charged, particularly in their briefs submitted to this Court,
that Ernst fc Ernst's conduct could be considered as reckless
or fraudulent.

They charge that even if the proper standard

is followed by this Court, the case should be remanded.
And we submit that this is incorrect.

Because the

conduct of Ernst & Ernst was fully disclosed, fully discovered,
is fully out in the open, and on the record.

It was on the

record for the District Court; it was on the record before the
Court of Appeals; and it's here.
And it's not just a record that was developed during
this case, in the other litigation, related litigation in which
the Respondent; were involved, which resulted in a full trial
on the merits, spawned at least three other appeals.
information was developed.

A lot of

In fact, all of the items, the

three or four items about which the Respondents complain in

16
their brief — I mean in their — yes, in their brief, were all
outlined in the complaint itself.
QUESTIONS

So this is nothing new.

Did they allege reckless or willful

misconduct in their complaint?
MR. BERNERt

No.

They allege that Ernst & Ernst

knew or should have known.
But, as the brief of the Hochfelder respondents
points out, they never characterized that conduct, they simply
— they didn't say it was simply negligent, they submitted it,
the facts, to the court.
And it is our view that it should not be permitted at
this stage on the basis of the same record to apply a few
more adjectives and thus send the case back for another view
of the same fasts, simply with different adjectives in mind.
This is not a

new theory they're proposing.

They are simply

proposing that — they are continuing to propose that Ernst &
Ernst's conduct was wrong.
QUESTION: Did they argue in the Seventh Circuit that
there v;as sufficient evidence, or would be a trial to support
a finding of recklessness or willfulness?
MR. BERNER:
Circuit.

It was not that clear in the Seventh

The/ did not emphasize that.

But the Seventh Circuit

opinion, I believe, is quite clear that no finding of — no
finding of recklessness or fraud could be found.

The Seventh

Circuit opinion, the Seventh Circuit had stretched some to find

17
the possibility of negligence.
QUESTION:

Well, the Seventh Circuit said, in fact,

that at common law Ernst & Ernst couldn’t be held —
MR. BERNER:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
— under the Ultramares,

statute, didn't

it?
MR. BERNER:

That's correct.

That's correct.

Which would eliminate a finding of fraudulent or reckless
conduct.

That's correct.
QUESTION:

Was there a claim here in the pleadings

of reliance on the Ernst 6 Ernst certificate?
MR. BERNER:

No, sir, not direct reliance.

In fact,

the record is clear that the plaintiffs did not rely on Ernst &
Ernst and on their audit.
They didn't knew Ernst

&

They had never seen the audit.
Ernst, they didn't know of them.

The theory, as best I can make it out, is that if
Ernst & Ernst had audited properly, it would have told the
Midwest Stock Exchange and the SEC that there were weak internal
accounting controls at First Securities.
QUESTION: And that would derive from the mail, the
opening of his mail, ~
MR. BERNER:
QUESTION:

Opening of the mail —
— and the time he didn't take vacations?

MR. BERNER: Well, the record doesn't support that he
didn't take vacations.

But — as a matter of fact, the record

18

is clear to the contrary.

But vacations, weak internal

accounting controls — and there are two other elements.

One

was the fact that Nay borrowed from his company; and the other
was that there was a temporary net capital violation in 1967.
Both of those were litigated in part of this suit below that
was directed against the Midwest Stock Exchange.

And both of

those were found to be — by the Seventh Circuit and the
District Court, as not instances of negligence on the part of
the Midwest.
Now, Ernst & Ernst was simply to report those to the
Midwest.

The gist of the complaint, as I understand it, is

that Ernst s Ernst reported those informally rather than
formally.
I'm not sure of the legal distinction, but that
appears to be what it is.
And those are not audit problems. For instance, the
excessive barrowinas, they are ca!3ed;. by Nay, they were
always less than the earned surplus.

Nay owned the company.

And the amounts he borrowed were always less than the earned
surplus of the company, considerably less.
They were all reported on the financial statements,
juat as the requisite SEC instructions require.
The Respondente claim that the debt should have bean
reserved, beceuse they said Nay was hopelessly insolvent.
Well, they overlook the fact that the debts were reserved,

19

reserved 100 percent.

Under net capital computations, debts

from jin officer or partner or director of a broker-dealer must
be carried as a zero asset in determining net capital.

And

that was done in these instances.
So those are the other instances, Mr. Chief Justice.
So we submit that a remand on the issue of reckless­
ness or fraud would be particularly inappropriate.

There is

not a new theory that is being urged by the Respondents, there
are merely new adjectives that are being applied to Ernst &
Ernst's conduct, the same conduct that has been fully before
all of the courts.
I would like briefly to touch upon the two other
issues —
QUESTION: Well, may I ask — I think the Commission
suggests that they should have an opportunity to amend their
complaint to affect the theory of reckless or intentional
rather than negligent conduct.
MR. BERNER:
QUESTION:
tli at?

What do you think — what do you say to
' ,

MR. BERNER:
improper.

Yes, sir.

I think the commission's suggestion is

The Commission*s brief was filed several weeks after

the brief of the Hochfelder respondents, where the use of the
words "reckless" and "fraudulent" first occurred.

And the

SEC, the Commission referred to that brief and says perhaps the

20

case should he remanded.
However, the SEC bases that, apparently, on the fact
they believe a new theory is being — may be argued.

We don't

consider this a new theory.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, would that suggestion

involve us with the statute of limitations question?
MR. BERNER:
exist now.

Well, the statute of limitations questions

And the statute would be the same.

It would not

affect the applicable statute.
If I may, I would like —
QUESTION:

Mr. Berner, let me ask you:

If the

general rule is that even an intervenor is not allowed to raise
a new theory in a case, would the SEC, simply as an amicus,
have any right to raise a new theory at this stage?
MR. BERNER:
gratuitous,

Well, we felt that the suggestion was

and is not supported by any case authority as to

their standing.

Tt appears on the last page of their brief.

QUESTION: Doesn't it suggest something like a common
law action?
MR. BERNER:

A common law action — 10b-5 is not the

only statute or the only theory upon which a plaintiff can
proceed in a sacurities case.
QUESTION:
!

•

In a common law —

Assume they did, on what theory did they

-

proceed, on 10(b)?
MR. BERNER:

No, only on 10b-5.

21
QUESTION:

Yes.

Well now, if the SEC suggestion is

construed to be a suggestion for a common lew claim, then it is
a different theory, is it not?
MR» BERNER:
a different theory.

I put that "if".

Well, I don’t — I would not call it
I think they would still be alleging

fraud.

They may have found another way to get at Ernst &

Ernst.

But I wouldn't consider that a different theory.
I'd like to reserve a few minutes, if I may.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Berner.

Mr. King.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLARD L. KING, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS HOCHFELDER, ET AL.
MR. KING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
In 1968, a man calling himself Leston B. Nay, a
member of the Midwest Stock Exchange and president of First
Securities Company of Chicago, murdered his wife and killed
himself.
company

He lssft a suicide note in which he said that his
wee

bankrupt because of hi3 thefts committed over a

period of thirty years.
His 3uicids note also said that a certain escrow, in
which he had said investments to the customers of First
Securities Ccmpany, was spurious.

Nay had persuaded these

plaintiffs, long-time customers of First Securities Company,
to let that company sell their standard securities and invest

22
the proceeds in this fictitious escrow.
Thera was no escrow.

Nay converted their money to

his own use immediately upon its receipt.
Nay's suicide note also asked that Ernst & Ernst be
notified.

Why?

What part had Ernst taken in Nay's horrid

story?
For twenty years, Ernst had certified, each year,
to Midwest Stock Exchange that First Securities Company — a
balance sheet of First Securities Company, showing it to be
solvent, when in fact it was utterly insolvent.
In eachcf those thirty years, Ernst had certified
to Midwest St0 2k Exchange that it had reviewed the internal
accounting controls of Nay's company, as it was required to do
by the standards of its profession.
Actually, the company had no internal accounting
control, because Nay had an adamant office rule that all mail
received by tho company addressed to him or to the company for
*

hie attention could only be opened, seen or read by him.
Whim he was away for a few days, the mail, by his command,
piled up, unopened, on his desk.
Nay secreted the incoming mail on his desk, the great
mass of his correspondence with his escrow victims was found
locked in his desk.

Ernst never reviewed the internal

accounting control.

If it had done so, it would have uncovered

Nay's fraud

Now, what is internal accounting control?
QUESTION:

You say it would have necessarily

uncovered the mail rule that you've just described?
MRo KING:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

What is internal accounting control?
In 1339, the SEC published a volume on that subject,
which established the very simple definition of that term.
Internal accounting control means that the work of each officer
and employee most be counterchecked by the work of another.
It means that no fraud or crime can exist without collusion
between two or more persons.

It means that no one person can

profit by a fraud because his fraud will be discovered by
another person.
QUESTION:
collusion here?

With whom do you suggest there was
You say it takes two, at least two to

accomplish thin.
MR. KING:
suggest.

There was no collusion here that I

I was giving the definition of internal accounting

control, as stated by the SEC on the basis of the testimony
of -twelve leading American public accountantsP in 1939.

I did

not suggest collusion.
The essence of internal accounting control is
required duality.
In 1939, the SEC published the complete transcripts
of the testimony of twelve leading American public accountants,

24
each of whom testified to this definition of required duality
as internal accounting control.
One of those experts was the senior partner of Ernst
6 Ernst.
This occurred in the SEC's investigation of the
colossal frauds at McKesson & Bobbins, a multi-mi11ion-doliar
drug concern whose securities were listed on the New York
Stock Exchange.

The president of that company was an ex­

convict under a fictitious name, who operated the company with
the aid of his three brothers, also under various fictitious
names.

They inflated the sales and inventories by many

millions.

Lika Nay, the president shot himself when his fraud

was discovered.
McKeason had been audited by a nationally known
public accounting firm, and the SEC condemned its failure to
check the internal accounting control.
One of the McKesson criminals required that all of
the incoming mail be put unopened on his desk.

He never took

a vacation.
Under these circumstances, the SEC questioned each
of the twelve leading American public accountants on the duty
of a public ecoountant with respect to checking the incoming
mail.

It shewed each of them a bulletin cf the American

Institute of Certified Public Accountants, under a caption,
"Safeguards surrounding the handling of incoming mail."

Each

of the twelve leading public accountants testified that a public
accountant: must not fail to check the routine of examining the
handling of incoming mail, and find it to be controlled so that
no one could secrete that mail.
QUESTION: Well, Mr. King, supposing they do fail to
check into that, that would still be no more than negligence,
would it?
MR. KING:

I suggest that it would be the grossest

sort of negligance, and gross negligence of a public accountant
is evidence cf fraud.
QUESTION:

Well, that's just a lot of words.

Negligence, grass negligence, evidence of fraud.
three fairly separate things.

So those are

And I don't think it helps

analysis to simply garble them all together.
MR. KING:

I didn't mean to garble them, Mr. Justice.

QUESTION:

Mr. King, do I understand you are now

arguing there was fraud on the part of Ernst fi Ernst?
MR. XING:

Our complaint does not allege either

negligence or fraud.
QUESTION: But in your interrogatories, you expressly
disclaim any charge of fraud.

MR. XING:

That, is right, yes.

QUESTION: Are you standing on that interrogatory, or
are you now chsnging your position?
MR. XING:

Of course I stand upon it, Mr. Justice.

26

QUESTION: Well then, you*re not charging fraud.
MR. KING:

Well, I ask, if necessary, leave to amend

the complaint to charge gross negligence equivalent to fraud.
QUESTION:
MR. KING:

In this Court?
Yes.

Well, this Court has previously,

in cases involving summary judgment, permitted the case to be
reversed for ernendinent of the complaint.
QUESTION: So you are asking that the case be remanded
to allow you to amend your complaint to charge fraud?
MR. KING:

MR. KING:
QUESTION:

MR. KING:

That is correct.
Now, when was this suit instituted?
In 1971.
And this is the first time this has
More or less.
Well, it only occurred to me when this

Court allowed certiorari on the opinion cf the Seventh Circuit.
I had been describing the McKesson report of the SEC.
Since that report, sine© 1939, the SEC, in two cases, has
suspended a broker from the Exchanges for tolerating Nay's mail
rule.
The Advisory Committee of Broker-Dealers to the SEC,
in its volume entitled "Guide to Broker-Dealer Compliance",
has stated:

No personal mail should be permitted in an office,

nor any mail distributed unopened to any salesman or other
employees

27

In opposition to Ernst's motion for summary judgment,
the plaintiffs filed the affidavit of Fred J. Duncombe, a
former president of the Illinois Society of Certified Public
Accountants, and a former member of the board for certifying
them.
Mr. Duncombe*s affidavit stated that he would not
have certified the balance sheet of a company employing Kay's
mail rule because such a company had no internal accounting
control.
To the same effect, the plaintiffs filed in oppositior
to the summary judgment the affidavit of Gerhard Mayer, a
distinguished public accountant of thirty years* experience.
Ernst filed, in support of its

motion for summary

judgment, the affidavit of its partner, Jerry Hooker, who had
been in charge of the First Securities Company audit.
Hooker's affidavit stated that Nay's mail rule was
not relevant to internal accounting control.

On his deposition,

Hooker testified that he would not have objected to Nay's mail
rule if he had known about it.

He was clearly unacquainted

with the elerceitary rules of his profession.

His affidavit is

contrary to tha affidavits of the two distinguished public
accountants that the plaintiffs filed.
It i.3 contrary to the testimony of the twelve leading
American public accountants published by the SEC, in 1939.
It is in the teeth of the two cases where the SEC has suspended

28

a broker from the Exchanges for tolerating May's mail xrule.
I submit that no summary judgment may be issued on
that affidavit.
I turn now to privity, or, as Judge Cardozo called
it, near privity between the plaintiffs and Ernst.
These plaintiffs had been long-time customers of
First Securities Company.

Nay made the proposal of the escrow

to them in the office of the company.
of the escrow to them under this plaque.

Nay made the proposal
This plaque was Nay's

principal tool for perpetrating his fraud.
By tiis plaque, Nay defrauded those people of their
life savings, aggregating approximately one million dollars.
It reads: "Midwest Stock Exchange, organized 1E82, where
high standards of conanercial honor and integrity are maintained
and just and equitable principles of trade and business prevail.
"This certificate of msirbership is issued to Leston B.
Nay of First Securities Company of Chicago."
That plaque was kept there for twenty years by
Ernst's false certification of the balance sheet of First
Securities Company.

That plaque would have come down if

Ernst had ever delivered a correct balance sheet.

That plaque

would have coma down if Ernst had ever told Midwest Stock
Exchange that First Securities Company had no internal
accounting control.
That plaque would have com© down if Ernst had ever

29
told Midwest that Nay secreted the incoming mail.

Twice the

SEC has suspended brokers from the Exchanges for tolerating
that rule.
QUESTIONi

Mr. King, neither you nor Mr. Lassers has

cited in yoir briefs the Blue Chip opinion, although your
opposition cites it repeatedly.

Is there a reason for this?

Do you feel that the Blue Chip case has no bearing on this
one?
MR. KING*

I think their footnote — there's a foot­

note in the Blue Chip case that might have a bearing on
17(a)(5), but, I would — our complaint didn't mention 17(a)(5),
and I would avoid it.
Nay represented this escrow to these plaintiffs as a
First Securities Company project.

The evidence of that in the

Court of Appeals first Nay decision, in tho 463rd Fed 2d, is
overwhelming.
When on® of the plaintiffs asked to withdraw his
escrow investment, Nay said to hints

MYour money is safe at

First Sacuritias,"
And Ernst’s certificate was given wholly for the
benefit of th e 3 @ customers of the company, and not at all for
the benefit c£ Midwest Stock Exchange.

Its;) whole aim was the

protection of the customers of the company.
I suggest that we thus have a situation approaching
privity, as Judge Cardozo said, between Ernst end these

30

plaintiffs.
QUESTION*

Mr. King, the Court of Appeals stated that

plaintiffs admitted lack of reliance on the financial state­
ments prepared by Ernst & Ernst, —
MR. KING:

We never saw the financial statement.

What we did see was this plaque which was kept there by that
certificate.
QUESTION: But you never sew the financial statement?
MR. KING: We never saw it.
QUESTION*

And you agree your clients, therefore,

did not rely on what you contend are the failures of Ernst &
Ernst correctly to audit the accounts of this company?
MR. KING*

I agree that w® never saw the financial

statement, but I think our loss was a direct result of Ernst’s
failure to properly audit the company; their failure to
discover Nay's mail rule, which would have terminated Nay's
operations.

Re couldn't continue those operations if an

auditor reported that he secreted the incoming mail.
QUESTION:

What if all the factual situation was

the same, and Mr. Nay had a sideline dealing in second
mortgages, and did that through the private mail rule, and
that the whole scheme involved forgeries of the second mortgages;
would you think that the seme kind of liability would follow
in that kind cf a case?
MR. KING*

Well, I think you could assume an

31
Isolated transaction by Nay —
QUESTIONi

No, I mean a series.

MR. KING:

A series of isolated transactions --•

QUESTION:

Dozens of them.

MR. KING:

But that’s not this situation.

Here he

represented that this escrow was a First Securities project.
QUESTION:

And he was using the money in the

MR. KING:

That -- I'm not sure.

company.

QUESTION:
MR. KING:

Well, why was the company bankrupt?
That was originally,back in 1938, a

tremendous debt of some $474,000.
QUESTION: Well,

why was the company — what was he

doing to the company that lad to its failure?

This escrow

arrangement, how did that contribute to the failure of the
company?
MR. KING:

His failure was the suicide when he no

longer could pat off the bank out in Colorado to whom ha was
short soma 475 — the company was short some $474,000.
And, mind you, this is incorporated for $35,000.

The

company was utterly, hopelessly insolvent from the instant
Ernst started to audit.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Lassers.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLARD J. LASSERS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS ALLISON, ET AL.
MR. LASSERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
I*d like to start off by responding to Mr. Justice
Powell*8 comment or question as to whether we're, for the first
time in this Court, now arguing that the conduct of Ernst &
Ernst was reckless.
Our answer to that question is that we are not
arguing it for the first time.

Because what happened was we

tried the case below on the theory that all we had to show was
a failure of Ernst & Ernst to observe proper auditing standards.
And that case was tried on that basis in the District Court
and in the Seventh Circuit.
QUESTION:

And what —

When you say it was tried, are you talking

about the case against Ernst 6 Ernst?
MR. LASSERS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

I thought it went off on a grant of summary

judgment.
MR. LASSERS:
yes.

Right.

It was, yes.

Summary judgment.

I*m sorry, I didn't —

Right.

Yes.

*

And then when, in this Court, in the certiorari
petition, Erret 6 Ernst for the first time raised the issue that
something more was needed, and we say:

Well, now, if something

33
more is needed, we are prepared to prove something more.
Second, I'd like to respond to Mr. Justice Blackmun's
comment —
QUESTIONi

Before you start on that, I return to the

response to interrogatories, on page 86 of the Appendix, in
which you say, "We do not contend that Ernst & Ernst employed
any scheme or artifice to defraud."
Do you now refutiate that?
MR. LASSERS:

No, sir.

Because what we're saying

there was we do not contend that Ernst 6 Ernst was in league
with Nay.

What we do say is that if this Court holds that

Ernst & Ernst, — that recklessness is the standard, then we're
prepared to prove recklessness.
After all, you can commit a fraud, if you disregard,
you close your eyes to the obvious.

That, too, is a fraud.

And coming to Mr. Justice Blackmun's comment about
the Blue Chip case.

As I read Blue Chip, I don't think it's

applicable because, as I read Blue Chip, it holds that there
has to be a purchase and a sale.

We grounded our case on

Section 10(b), and it was clearly a purchase and a sale.
QUESTION*

Was there — on the negligence basis,

would there be a cause of action under State law?
Ernst & Ernst..
MR. LASSERS:
QUESTION:

Under State law?

Yes.

Against

34

MR. LASSERS:

I don't know, I can't answer that.

X

haven't researched Illinois law on that question.
Now, I'd like to comment on the mail rule —
QUESTIONs

Mr. Lassers, in this case, for four years

you took discovery?
MR. LASSERSI

Yes, sir.

QUESTION* Extensive discovery?
MRo LASSERS*
QUESTION*

Well, yes.

Yes.

And did you find enough for fraud?

MR. LASSERS*

I think we found enough to prove

recklessness.
QUESTION*

Well, why don't you allege it?

MR. LASSERS *
QUESTION*

What?
Well, why didn't you allege it then?

MR. LASSERS*

Well,

w© did our . discovery after

we filed our camplaint.
QUESTION*

Well, you still could have amended your

complaint, couldn't you?
MR. LASSERS*
QUESTION*
MR. LASSERS*

Ho, but -Couldn't you?
We could — well, we could have asked.

But if —
QUESTION; Well, did you ask?
MR. LASSERS*

No, sir, because Ernst & Ernst never

raised this issue that we had to prove recklessness until we

35
got here.
QUESTION*
QUESTION:

Well, it's your lawsuit.
It’s your lawsuit.

MR. LASSERS*

That certainly is true.

But we felt

that we had alleged enough.
QUESTION:

But if you got a claim for negligence

and a claim for fraud, certainly you allege both of them, don’t
you?

You don't say negligence is good enough to get by on, so

we won’t worry about fraud, even though we can —
MRa LASSERS*

Well, fraud is, of course, a much more

difficult thing to prove.
But — and I’d like to say this about the mail rule,
because I don’t think the full flavor of the mail rule has
come through to the Court.
And that is this:

It wasn't just that there was a

rule in the «ibstract that the auditor failed to find, what
happened was that he went in, the auditors went in every year,
at the beginning of every audit, they would spend two or three
days, they would come in in the morning at nine o’clock,
before the mail was untied from the bundles, and their duty was
to examine the mail as it cam© in, and they watched the mail
being untied from the bundles and they saw the clerk then
/

abstract the letters that were for Mr. Nay and put them off to
one side, and the auditors never raised a question about that
for fifteen years.

And it went through two or three auditors.

36

Now then, the other matter that Mr. Berner alluded
to, very late in the game — yes, sir?
QUESTION:
have done?

What do you suggest the auditors should

Should have said, "Why do you do that?"

And the

answer would have been, "Well, because Mr. Nay likes to open
his own mail."
MR. LASSERS:

All right.

I say that at that point,

and Mr. Mayer, our expert CPA, says that that would have been
enough to trigger a warning to him that further investigation
was at issue.
QUESTION:

Wall, that would be the further

investigation: —
MR. LASSERS:

Right.

QUESTION:

"Why do you hold that mail for Mr.

MR. LASSERS:

Right.

Nay* —

QUESTION: —"'while he*s away on vacation?"
"Well, because he likes to open his own mail."
MR. LASSERS:

Right.

Then they would have — then

Mr, — our expert said he would have — if he hadn't been
allowed, in effect, to look at that mail, and if that practice
hadn't been stopped, in an extreme he would have withdrawn from
the audit.

Ea would have withdrawn from the engagement.
QUESTION:

I understood your colleague to have said

that an accountant, an accounting firm is not to certify unless

37

another person in the organization sees the mail.
MRo LASSERS*

Well, I don’t — I don't know that we

would go that far*
But what I want to say —
QUESTION* But you would go that far if the auditor
weren't permitted to look at it?
MR* LASSERS:

Well, I think that — our autior says

that he wouldn't have certified if that were the practice.
QUESTION t

I ; see.

MRo LASSERS*

Now, I want to stress to the Court

Section 17(a) of the 1934 Act, which I think is essential to
this action here, because that is the section which says that
brokers have to keep books and records, and it says that the
auditor must — you must have a certified audit once a year.
So that the audits that Ernst & Ernst were performing were not
audits that were being undertaken voluntarily, these were
audits pursuant to the SEC's command, and the audits had to be
filed and certified with the SEC.
Our point is that the failure to observe the mail
practices indicated to the auditors, or should have indicated
that there ws.s a violation of internal accounting control.
Under the SEC regulations, the auditors were required to check
internal accounting controls, and that, therefore, they failed
in their statutory and regulatory duties.
Yes?

38

QUESTION:

Mr, Lassers, is 17(a) before us on this

petition for certiorari?
MR, LASSERS:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Did you file any cross-petition?
MR. LASSERS:

No, sir, but as I understand the rule,

that we relied on 17(a) in the Seventh Circuit, and the Seventh
Circuit decided the case on the basis of 17(a), and we are a
respondent, end therefore we're in a position to assert any­
thing that is in support of the judgment below.
QUESTION:

Let me ask you, you mean that if we

reverse the Court of Appeals on the 10(b), that we could
affirm the judgment on 17(a)?
MR, LASSERS:
QUESTION:

Well, our position —

I didn't know that — is there a private

cause of actioi under 17(a)?
ME, LASSERS:

Well, there may be.

has not been decided by this Court.

Now, that issue

It has not been decided

by —
QUESTION:

Well, the Court of Appeals didn't say so,

did it?
MR. LASSERS:

No, it did not.

QUESTION: Well, then we could not affirm on 17(a).
MR. LASSERS:

Our position on 17(a) is — we are

suing under Section 10(b), and our position on 17(a) is —
QUESTION:

Well, if we reverse on — say, if we

39

reverse the Court of Appeals on 10 fp" decided against you on
10(b), then you've lost the case, haven't you?
MR. LASSERS:
QUESTION:

No, sir, Your Honor, because —
Well, then, you -- what about 17(a) then?

MR. LASSERS:

Well, our position on 17(a) is we are

suing under 10(b), and our position is that Section 17(a) sets
up the duty end it also sets up the standard that has to be
adhered to under 10 (b).
QUESTION:

Yes, but you don't know whether you could

stay in court; under 17.
MR. LASSERS: Well, that would be an issue before this
Court, whether there is an implied causa of action under
Section 17, as such.
QUESTION:

Well, the Seventh — the Court of Appeals

certainly didn't decide there was.
MR. LASSERS:
QUESTION:
MR. LASSERS:

No, they reserved the question.
Well, —
But — and as I read the Seventh

Circuit, they held that there

was a — that the Section 17

set up the duty and the standard
QUESTION:

Only — only if we wanted to decide an

issue the Court of Appeals didn't decide, is 17 here.
MR. LASSERS:

Well, I think 17 is here in the sense of

setting up the standard, and that we’re suing under 10(b) about
the standard of care that the auditor is responsible for is

40

laid out very precisely under 17.
Now, the final point I want to make has to do with
another violation, and that has to do with the net capital
violation that occurred very late in the game.
there was this, and here I think that Ernst

c,

What happened

QUESTIONi

Mr. Lassers, could I ask you a question

which I should have asked your colleague, Mr. King?

Is he

the author of a leading biography on Chief Justice Fuller?
MR. LASSERS:
QUESTION:

Yes, he is.
Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Gonson,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL GONSON, ESQ.,
Oi BEHALF OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. GONSON:

Mir. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The basic position of the SEC in- this case, assuming

41
that the auditor's conduct below was not more than negligent,
is that the judgment should be rendered for Ernst & Ernst.
And this is sc< on a very simple basis.
Because the plaintiffs in this case. Respondents here,
in their capacity as escrow investors, were not reasonably
foreseeable by Ernst s Ernst, and, as they concede, they did
not rely on any audit prepared by Ernst & Ernst.
Now, we share with Ernst & Ernst and with the amicus
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants a reluctance
to expose accounting firms to potential daar.ges in vast
amounts for negligence in cases where it strikes one's basic
sense of fairr ess that such damages should not be imposed.
But Ernst

&

Ernst comes to this Court in this quite

unusual case, factually, quite an untypical case, and asks that
the baby be ttrown out with the bath water.

It asks this

Court to enunciate a rule that, if accepted, would also bar
recovery in the meritorious cases, the more typical cases,
the cases whoa© a sense of fairness would say to one that
porhaps damage judgments should be awarded.
Now, if this Court wishes to develop such a broad
rule respecting the liability of auditors for negligence, then
we have offered in our brief —* arid which I'll speak to briefly
today — what we think is a sound approach in doing so.
But in developing such a broad rule in this case,
this Court would then be called upoiv to strike an appropriate

42
balance between two important competing policies.
On the one hand, there is the necessity of maintaining
high professional standards of accountants, because of their
extremely important role with respect to the federal securities
laws.

This country's system of such laws is dependent on the

disclosure, the integrity of disclosures which are made to
investors.

And auditors are recognized as having a public duty

in that respect, to

safeguard the interests of the public who

read their reports, more so than an interest to safeguard the
auditor's clients.
Auditors are called upon to certify financial state­
ments conteire5 in a wide variety of documents required to be
given to investors by public companies and to be filed with the
SEC.

In many instances, the opinion of the auditing firm is

essential before securities may be offered to the public, or
placed privately.

Thus, the continued confidence of the public

in the securities laws of this country has to rest, to some
great extent, on the shoulders of the accounting profession.
Now, when I say this I doh't mean to suggest that
auditors are insurers of the honesty of their clients, certainly
they era not, and they have no obligation affirmatively to seek
out fraud? ncr should they have any liability of any kind for
honest professional judgments which turn out, on hindsight, to
have been erroneous.
But. the auditor is in a peculiarly advantageous

43

position to detact and to stop fraud in its insipiencya
The question here is:

what if he fails to do that,

through negligence, and investors are injured?
Now, we doubt that this Court would wish to say that
there never could be a case under any circumstances under
10b-5 where an injured investor might recover deunages against
an auditor whose professional conduct fell below the standards
of his profession,
QUESTION:

Mr, Gonson, is there anything the

Securities ard Exchange Commission itself can do to a fraudulent
auditor?
MRc GONSON:

Well, certainly.

There are remedies

that are available to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
It could sue an auditor for an injunction, pursuant to the
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act? and, under appro­
priate circumstances, it could bring disciplinary proceedings
under Rule 2(e) of its Rules of Practice.
This Court has recognized in several cases that
private causes of action are an effective supplement to the
SEC's own enforcement procedure.
QUESTION: Wall, you seem to anticipate my next
question:

Heiva you taken any action against Ernst & Ernst?
MR* GONSON:

In this case?

Not to my knowledge,

Your Honor.
QUESTION: What role, if any, do you think Section

44
17(a) of the Exchange Act plays, or ought to play?
MR. GONSON:

Well, this raises a question, to which,

of course, Justice White alluded earlier, and that is that it
does not appear to have been ruled on in the court below.
QUESTION: The court below discussed it in part —
what — part 2 or part 3 of its opinion.

Part 2 of its

opinion.
MR. GONSON:
QUESTIONi
MR. GONSON:

Yes.

It’s a question as to whether —

Just in saying that it was a statutory —
Yes,

could be created; and beyond

that a privateright of action
there, of course, there would be

the question wiether, in this case, the requirements of 17(a)
as it existed at the time of this action were met, which is a
separata factor here.
QUESTION:

Well, you*r@ going, as I understand you,

a little beycnd ftie metes and

bounds of this case in talking

generally about what the rule ought

to be. And it was in that

connection that I asked you the question, What role, if any, do
you think — What function, if any, do you think Section 17(a)
ought to play in deciding the question of civil liability of
accountants?

To investors, under 10(b).

MR. GONSON: Well, that rule, of course, would — I am
speaking much .nore broadly than with respect to just the
audit of broker-dealers —•
QUESTION:

That*3 what I thought

45
MR. GONSON:

— and that rule is of course a rule

that relates to the auditor of broker-dealers.
And the Commission has not prepared a position, Your
Honor, today with respect to what role Section 17(a) should
piety in this case.
Rather, we’re addressing ourselves to the role of
Section 10(b) and 10b-5.
QUESTION:
MR. GONSON:

Okay.
Now, we think that an appropriate

balance, then, must be struck between a sufficiently broad
standard of culpability to reinforce this important right of
investors to receive accurate information, and the need to
avoid unfairness to particular accountants by subjecting him
for damages to negligence to persons who did not rely on hi.s
conduct.
Nov, the question is, how is this balance to be
struck?

Where should the Court look to for guidance to structure

the contours of an appropriate damage remedy?
Before I do get to that, I want to make two brief
points.
First, in this case, we do agree with the Respondents
that negligent conduct is

sufficient to establish a violation

of Section 1C and Rule 10b-5, but it doss not follow that every
negligent violation should give rise to a money damages remedy.
Thus we separate out the two questions.

46
The first, is there a violation of the section; and,
second, what should the remedy be?
I agree with Mr. Berner, Ernst & Ernst's counsel, that
the legislative history on 10(b) is far from conclusive, but I
offer to this Court that there is nothing in the phrase, "any
manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance", which limits
conduct only to that which is done intentionally.
Indeed, when Congress wanted to limit the Act to
willful conduct, both with respect to violations and with
respect to civil liability for those violations, it specifically
said so.
QUESTION*

But don't the terms "manipulative" and

"deceptive" both, at least to the common mind, convey a sense
of intent as well as the objective result of the action?
Can you negligently manipulate something?
MR. 30NS0N: Well, I would respectfully disagree,
Your Honor.

I think that tho phrase, "manipulative and

deceptive", refers not to any particular state of mind, but,
rather, to the conduct, or to the effective conduct.

If one

looks at the phrases that Congress used in the various civil
liability previsions which are set forth in our brief and in
the other briefs, and when they wished to connote conscious
or intentional wrongdoing they use phrases like this, they
said, "did net know".
QUESTION*

Well, what is a manipulative practice

47
that could be negligently carried on?
MR. GONSONt

I’m not sure what a manipulative

practice that could be negligently carried on is, but I think
I know what a deceptive practice that could be negligently
carried on is, and that's the kind of a practice where a person,
through failure to adhere to the standards of his profession,
like an accountant, causes financial statements to be deceptive,
aid to mislead persons.
QUESTION:

Well, of course the statute doesn't use

the word "practice", it uses "device or contrivance", nouns
that are derived from verbs — from the verbs, "devise" or
"contrive", end those are affirmative verbs, those are not
negligent verbs.
MR. GONSON:

That's true, Your Honor.

I would not

disagree with that.
But I would point out that in section 9 of the
Securities Exchange Act, in the subdivisions — in that section,
this is the section that deals with the prohibition against
effecting treinsaction under Securities Exchange for the purpose
of influencing the price.

And that section and several sub­

sections prohibits these practices "for the purpose of" doing
such-and-such.
And the civil liability section, which is Section
9(e) imposes liability on a person who "willfully violates11?
so at least we have in soma sections an indication of the state

48

of culpability required.
We have in 10(b) at least an ambiguous phrase, and
I would suggest that in this situation we look to the
admonition of this Court, as emphasized again and again, that
when the Court is construing the federal securities laws, and
particularly Rule 10b-5, since they are remedial legislation
these laws should be construed not technically and not
restrictively, but flexibly, in order to effectuate the
remedial purposes.
QUESTION!

We are dealing here with a cause of

action that has been implied, aren't we?

And the problem is

how to construe the law with respect to the standard of
performance that's to be required.
Nov7, why shouldn't we look to some other provisions
in the Act, to see what — for some guidance?

Then, if you did,

what would be; the nearest guide to this standard?

Congress has

provided a whole rang© of standards in various sections, all the
way from strict liability to negligence to deliberateness.
MRt GONSON: That's right, Your Honor.
QUESTION!
to this one?

Now, what section is most — is nearest

Is there any?

MRC GONSONs Wall, we do note in our brief, Your
Honor, we're row going to the question of remedy as distinguished
from the question of whether there was a violation, I believe.
QUESTION: Well, no, I just — you say that negligence

49

is enough.

Well, under some sections o£ violative law,

negligence is not enough.
MR. GONSONx

I'm saying that, Your Honor, even though

in a particular case a person may be held to have negligently
violated the law, it still might be improper to enforce
damages under —
QUESTION: Well, I understand that.
that.

I understand

But I still want to know -- at the outset, we want to

know whether the proof of negligence is enough.
Now, Congress has said in some sections that where
it has provided the standard itself, it has 3aid that
negligence ie not enough.
MR. GONSONx
QUESTION:

Your Honor, that's correct.

We —

And aren't there some sections that are

pretty close to this that require mora than just negligence?
MR. GONSONx

Yes, Your Honor.

There are a series of

sections that; require — that would impose liability absolutely,
without fault., as you've Indicated; and there are —
QUESTION:
MR. GONSONx

That's just negligence.
That's correct.

— end there are sections, on the other hand, that
would impose liability only for more than negligence.

But

there are a series of sections that do impose liability cn a
duty to discover kind of theory, and which give defenses to
persons, to shew that they made a reasonable investigation and

50
in the exercise of making that investigation they had no basis
upon which to discover that the information contained was false
and misleading.
And that, I suppose, is close to a negligent standard.
And we think that if, in applying the question of whether
damages should be assessed, rather than deciding on negligence
yes, or negligence no, it is helpful to look to the pattern
of civil liabilities that do exist in the Act, and we have
done that in our brief, and we have extrapolated from them
\iiat we think is a very useful guide.
And if we apply these principles to damage actions
under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, then recovery would be
permitted for violations

which were committed only negligently

under three circumstances:

one, the defendant knew or had

reason to bsliava that the plaintiff would rely on his conduct;
secondly, the plaintiff did in fact so rely; and, thirdly, the
amount of the plaintiff’s damages are fairly ascertainable.
QUESTION:
MR. GONSON:

But that’s not this case.
No, sir; that is not this case.

And

because —
QUESTION:
MR. GONSON:

What case are you arguing, then?
I am speaking largely to a possible rule

that this Court, if it desires to, could issue on the subject
of auditor negligence may do.
QUESTION:

I see

51
MR. GONSON:

In this case we believe that applying

those guidelines, that the record would not justify a recovery
for the plaintiffs.
QUESTION:

I understand.

QUESTION:

Mr. Gonson, how, in this case, just

following the literal text of the rule, can you say that whatever
Ernst & Ernst did that might have violated subsection (b) was
done in connection with the purchase or sale of any securities?
MR. GONSON: Well, I suppose that the Respondents
would take the position that —
QUESTION: Well, you're taking a position, too, that
they could be held liable here, so it isn't just what the
Respondents would say.
MR. GONSON:

Oh, I’m sorry, Your Honor, I misunder­

stood your question.
I t<elieva that the issuance by Nay of these notes to
these investors was the issuance of securities, and I would
think that upon that, the "in connection" phrase probably is
satisfied by the reading of this Court in the Superintendent
case, that this activity sufficiently touches upon that
transaction,
QUESTION: Even though these people never relied on
the statement, and never saw them apparently?
MR, GONSON: Well, I'm not urging for that result.
Your Honor, but I think that the "in connection with" phrase

52
could be satisfied by lying the issuance of the note by Nay to
the conduct which covered up his transactions.
QUESTION*

But if it winds up that we ought to

affirm on the principles you suggest rather than those followed
by the Court of Appeals, what, a3 to Ernst & Ernst, do you
contemplate is left of the case when it gets back to the
District Court?
MR. GONSON:

The complaint does not allege negligence,

nor does it allege intentional or reckless conduct; it simply
alleges facts.

It alleges that there was a failure of the

auditors to perform properly.
The issue of negligence seems to have arisen later
in the case.
We don't know *— w© were invited into the case, of
:

/

course, at this level, before this Court. We do not know
whether, if they had bean advised early in the game, that they
would have pleased something more than negligence.

Perhaps

wanton or heedless conduct.
And. so we were reluctant, even though, we tend to
agree that judgment should be for Ernst £ Ernst, to foreclose
them from the* possibility of making that argument, if it's
their command.
QUESTION* But it would have to be an argument on
something more than negligence?
MR. GONSON:

Yes, Your Honor

53
QUESTION:

There would have to be an amendment which

alleged at least recklessness,
MR, GONSONt

Well, there would have to be, I think,

proof that would establish recklessness.
QUESTION:

Also an amendment, would there not have

to be?
MR. GONSON: Well, the complaint does not, as I say,
allege any standard, it simply alleges facts.
Thcnk you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Berner, do you have anything further?

You have

about three minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. BERNER, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BERNER:

With respect to the question that has

attracted some attention, as to what is alleged in the complaint.,
what the theories are and what the facts are, I would point to
the third defense of Ernst & Ernst in its answer filed in this
case.
It's at page 24 of the Appendix.

In which the

statement is made that "Ernst & Ernst had no knowledge of any
conduct of Nt.y alleged to be fraudulent in the Second Count.
Without such knowledge, Ernst £ Ernst could not aid or abet Nay's
alleged fraudulent conduct."
I believe this should answer questions as to whether

54
the possibility of proving, or the issue as to recklessness or
fraud was ever raised in this case.

It was raised in the

answer to the complaint.
QUESTION:

Would you say that you could aid or abet

without any knowledge, would be quite different from the use
of those terms as words of art in the field of criminal law,
would it not?
MR. BERNER*

Well, my point is that when we — by

this defense we raise the issue as to the level of culpability,
and this defense tends to set out fairly clearly that the
Petitioner, who was defendant below, would take the position
that without some knowledge, some scienter, there could be no
recovery.
This is in response to the discussion as to whether
the Respondent? should be permitted to return to the District
Court and not amend

their complaint, as I understand it, but

simply to make a new argument, which we think is unwarranted.
I would like also to point out that the record
establishes very clearly that Ernst & Ernst in fact did review
the system of internal accounting controls.
And with respect to the mail rule, it has never been
shown in this case, and there is no evidence which supports the
causal connection.

This issue was not included in the petition

f or certiorari, but was argued below.
And to explain the immateriality of a mail rule,

55
if Nay had said to these people, "Please address your mail to
me, to Lock Box 1, or First Securities Company Lock Box 1",
that he opened himself, they would have done it.

And to think

that to require an accountant to review all of the incoming
mail of all of the officers and directors of a brokerage house,
in circumstances such as this, to think that that iB — that
itself is a derogation of generally accepted auditing
standards and is fraud, we submit is absurd.
And, finally, I would say —
QUESTION:

I thought that part of the alleged

fraudulent conduct and scheme on the part of Nay was that he
used First Securities, he used their stationery and he used
the office, end the communications were sent to him at First
Securities. And if he had told the plaintiffs, "When you
communicata with ma about this escrow business, you have to do
it through Lock Box 1", that might well have raised their
suspicions.

That's the point of —

MR. BERNER:
QUESTION:
First Securities.

Well, —
That's part of the fraud, was using

Wasn't it?

MR. BERNER:
QUESTION:
MR. BERNER:

As alleged.

That's as alleged.

But —

Yes.
— it also is reasonable to assume that

he specifically told these people to address all mail to him
in connection with the escrow to his attention or to him

56

personally, because, as the record indicates, he told them he
didn't want anyone at First Securities to know about these
investments.

He didn't want — this was a company whose name

he never revealed, and it should be --* it

should remain

confidential.
QUESTION*

Yes.

QUESTION:

So that, from your point of view, would

alert as much. — should have alerted them as much as the
hypothetical that Mr. Justice Stewart gave to you a moment
ago about the Lock Box.
MK0 BERNER:
QUESTION:
MR. BERNER:
QUESTION:

It should have alerted the Respondents.
Yes .
Yes, sir.

Right.

May I ask a question?

One of the allega­

tions by Respondents, relating to the net capital deficit, is
that there was a concealment by Ernst & Ernst.
If you've addressed that, I don't recall it.
MR. BERNER:

I did not.

The net capital violation

was a temporary violation as of Octpber 31, 1967.

It was a

$9,000 net capital violation that Ernst 6 Ernst discovered
in the course of its audit, and which it reported to the Midwest
Stock Exchange.
And. the Midwest Stock Exchange advised — at the time
of reporting it, they also advised the Midwest Stock Exchange
that the net capital violation had been remedied, and there was

57
no longer a violation at the time of reporting, which was
several weeks after the date as of which the audit was being
made.
And the officer of the Midwest Stock Exchange, Mr.
Rothing, advised Ernst & Ernst to — not to note the net
capital violation on the year-end audit, because it had been
corrected.
QUESTION: The full extent of it was only $9,000?
MR. BERNERt
QUESTION*
MR. BERNER:

Yes, sir.
This was an oral report, was it not?
No, this was on the certified financial

statements that were to be submitted to tho Midwest Stock
Exchange.
QUESTION*

But the communication be tv?® an Ernst

&

Ernst and the Stock Exchange —
MR. BERNER*

Oh, yes, sir, it was oral, but it’s

memorialised in a memorandum.
undisputed.

It's in the record.

It is

There's no dispute about the facts I have just

mentioned,
QUESTION* But I think there's some point made of the
fact that this was done orally and not officially and in
writing; isn't that correct?
MR. BERNER: Well, as I understand it, yes, the
argument is that it was done informally rather than formally.
QUESTION:

Right, informally.

58

MR. BERNERs

I'm not sure what "formally" means.

QUESTION: Well, among other things, I think maybe it
means just the oral nature of it.
QUESTION:

But didn't you say it wus confirmed in

writing?
MR. BERNER:

No, the fact of the telephone conversa­

tion between Mr. Hooker and Mr. Rothing is the subject of a
memorandum that's in the record.
QUESTION:
MR. BERNER:
QUESTION:
MR. BERNER:

A unilateral memorandum, isn't it?
I beg pardon?
Of a one-way — a unilateral memo.
Yets.

And Mr. Rothing testified as to

the conversation in related litigation.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. BERNER:

And testified that he instructed Ernst

& Ernst not to include the existence of this, by then cured,
violation.
QUESTION: Right.
QUESTION:

What is the total amount of damages

claimed in this case?
MR. BERNER: The total amount of damages is
$1,056,000 plus attorneys' fees.

That is compared to the

annual fee received by Ernst & Ernst of between $2,000 and
$2500 for making, for performing these audits.
The damages have been reduced by approximately

59
$200,000 which the Respondents will be receiving, as they
indicate in their brief, out of the receivership proceeding.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:27 o'clock, a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.1
