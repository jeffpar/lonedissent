ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK A. KEENAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. KEENANi

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please this

honorable Courts
Th© Illinois Foster Cara Payment Scheme denies th©
Federal Foster Care Payments to children who are placed in
foster homes maintained by their relatives.
The issues in this case ares
First, whether th© denial by the State of Illinois
violates the Social Security Act and th® supremacy clause; and
Second, whether that denial violates th© equal
protection.
The bast evidence that the Illinois Foster Care
Payment Scheme is in violation of the Social Security Act is
found in the position of th© Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare, the department charged with the stewardship of
administration of the Social Security Act.
Twice, first in a brief filed on behalf of the
Department by the Solicitor General in response to this Court's
invitation, and second in a program instruction issued as
recently as October of 1974, the Department of Health, Educa-

4
tion, and Welfare has unequivocally taken the position that
such payments must be afforded to related foster parents.
*

QUESTIONt

Is that program instruction out of line

with the existing regulations?
MR. KEENAN:

That program instruction is consistent

with the existing regulations, Mr. Justice, in the plaintiffs8
view.
QUESTION %
MR. KEENAN:

It's consistent with it?
It is consistent with it.

There is

nothing ~ the regulations do not speak directly to the question
of whether or not the payments can b@ mad©.

But I respectfully

cite this Court to its ruling in Townsend vs. Swank in the
test thereincontained, which states that absent clear evidence
on the face of the statute, or in the legislative history,
that the States have the option to withhold the payments from a
particular group of otherwise eligible citizens, that those
payments should fo© afforded.
I would also respectfully cite this Court

to its

recent decision in the case of Philbrook vs. Glodgett.

In that

case the State of Vermont attempted to exercise the option on
foohalf of the State to tall its citizens that they had to
accept eligibility for the lower of two levels — the lower of
two categorical assistance programs for which they might b©
eligible.
The State of Illinois hare is trying to do essentially

5
the same thing.
QUESTION*

Mr. Keenan, did I read somewhere, perhaps

among these voluminous papers, 'that the HEW has sine© amended
or revised th® applicable or pertinent regulations?
Since this case was filed hare.
MR. KEENAN:
Mr. Justice Brennan.

It is not contained in the regulations,
It’s contained in an October 1974 program

instruction, which is set out in th© Appellants5 brief at page
27 and th® pages following.
QUESTION:

Well, is that

revision pertinent to the

issue we have?
MR. KEENANs

I think it is not a revision, Your

Honor.
QUESTIONS
MR. KEENAN:

I see.
I think that it is a revision of HEW's

— of on© position that had been previously taken by on©
regional administrator of HEW.

But prior to this very clear

program instruction, I think that th© Washington Legal
Department of HEW had not rendered a specific opinion on this.
I think in IS74, after this cas© had been filed
before this Court, after th© district courts in South Dakota
and Ohio had decided this identical question the same way th®
plaintiffs now urg© upon this Court, then HEW saw fit to
clarify what it regarded to be confusion on th© parts of
Illinois and certain other States.

6

QUESTION? And does this support your position?
MR. KEENAN?
QUESTION?

It does, indeed* Your Honor.
Mr. Keenan, as I read the district court's

opinion, they didn't pass on any statutory question, they simply
treated the equal protection contention and ruled against you.
MR. KEENAN?

I think they — I think the district

court, the three-judge district court entertained the statutory
contention to the following extent?
The three-judge court specifically stated that it
found th© Illinois Poster Care Schema to bs consistent with
rather than in conflict — th® purposes of th© Illinois Foster
Cara Schema to b© consistent with rather than in conflict with
the federal statutes, as the plaintiffs had urged in their
arguments and briefs below, and in oral argument.
QUESTION?

Where do you find that in the district

court opinion?
Is it that section on page 59 of the Appendix?
MR. KEENAN?

Yes, Your Honor.

"Far from being

inconsistent with the federal schema, th© Illinois scheme in
general seems to parallel it.”
And then it footnotes it and citas ‘th© Illinois
"exception to policy” scheme.

And I think that is about the

only extant to which the district court entertained the statutory
interpretation question.
QUESTION?

Yes, if you take from page 55 of the

7
Appendix,, where the district court has its opinion headed “The
Merits'" to page 60# they simply conclude at the end# “The
Illinois scheme does not deny plaintiffs equal protection of the
laws.

Summary judgment is

entered in favor of defendants„B

I think you are somewhat hard-pressed to show that
they squarely addressed any statutory contention.
MR. KEENANs

Well# I would candidly admit to Your

Honor that the issua of whether or not the Illinois Schema
violates the Social Security Act or is inconsistent with the
Social Security Act was much more fully briefed in the appeal#
and that's the cm€- for several reasons.

First# it's just the

way the case came up in the district court# and I will admit
that. I have learned a considerable amount about statutory
interpretation laws sine© this complaint was originally filed
soms 'three years ago# Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Did you allege in the complaint that there

was a conflict between the fedaral statute and the State?
MR. KEENAN:

We alleged that it violated the purposes

of the federal Act# and it violated -the purposes of th© State
law# which must b© consistent with the federal law# because#
in order to participate in the categorieial assistance programs
under Title IV# the purposes of th© State law must be consistant
with th© purposes of th© federal law.
And that — and th© overriding purpose which th©
plaintiffs allege is violated is that th© lav; must be administered

8

and executed in order to maintain and strengthen families»
And the Illinois Foster

Car© Payment Scheme, as now written,

creates an economic disincentive to that, it

pails families

apart, as happened to the plaintiffs in this case.
QUESTIONs Well, tall me, Hr, Keenan, in light of
our colloquy earlier, on this clarification as you term it,
if you did raise the issue of inconsistency with the federal
statute, rather than reach th© constitutional question, ought
w© not remand this for reconsideration in light of th© clarifi™
cation?
MR, KEENAN:

I think it more proper, Your Honor, that

this Court retain its jurisdiction and decide the issue on
th© merits,
QUESTION3
MR, KEENAN:

The constitutional issue?
No — well, whatever issue this Court

decides, of course? but this Court traditionally entertains
tee statutory interpretation issue and seeks grounds for
decision other than th© constitutional on© —*
QUESTION:

Provided th© statutory issue is before us,
4

MR, KEENAN:

Provided the statutory issue is

before

it? and I think it is sufficiently raised by th© allegation in
th© complaint, first, that th© Illinois Foster Care Payment
Schema violates tea purpose of the f@deral law, and second, by
that language in th© district court opinion which specifically
which I would call a finding to the effect that th© Illinois

9

Foster Cars Payment Scheme doss not «“ is not inconsistent with
the federal law, but it rather parallels it»

1

think that

was error on the part of the district court -be make that as a
finding.
QUESTION^

Now, this clarification, if ‘that was the

right word for it, was issued two years after your lawsuit
started, was it not?
MR. KEENAN s

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTIONS And on page 28, about eight lines from the
bottom — beginning about nine lines from the bottom, what does
that language

wtha foster car© rate of payment prevails

regardless of whether or not the foster home is operated by &
relative*5?

Is that now binding on all the States?
MR. KEENANs

The plaintiffs believe it is, Your

Honor, and I think that it is clear that the position of the
Department of HEW thinks that it is.
QUESTION!

Well, then, if we seat the case back,

wouidndt that dispose of it?
If we remanded the cas© along the lines Mr. Justice
4

Braannan just hypothesised to you?
:

I

MR, KEENAN:
QUESTION:

i

■

1 would urge that this Court should not.
Wall, did we decide matters that are not

necessary for decision here?
MR. KEENAN:

I believe this matter is necessary for

decision, Mr. Chief Justice, because the only method the Depart-

10
ment of Health* Education, and Welfare has to enforce* what
it regards to — what is* absent an opinion by this Court*
merely an opinion by counsel* which will obviously be

disagreed

with by the attorneys General cf the States which have a scheme
similar to Illinois* the only method they have* that HEW has
of enforcing tills is conducting a compliance hearing.
Now* compliance hearings have been* oh* I would say*
quit® unsuccessful in securing immediate compliance,

I have

no *— it is no secret that fee Illinois Poster Car® — that
the Illinois Child Welfare Payments Schema* in general* is
fraught with confusion,
I would expect that to b@ the case in other States,
I think that if this Court wore to retain its jurisdiction*
that the policy of securing uniform national administration of
the Social Security Act* particularly Title IV of the Social
Security Act* would ba much batter served than by leaving it
with -the Department of Health* Education* and Welfare,

I

believe if this Court were to remand* with instructions to the
Stats of Illinois* that they should follow this new program
inelruction* that too Attorney General would advise the officials
of the State along the lines that he has urged inhis brief.
That is* that we don’t — 'this is the State speaking.
State of Illinois does not believe this to be a binding
advisement or a binding policy on the part of HEW —
QUESTION:

How

do we know that?

The

11
MRe KEENAN;

Because they say so in -their brief,

Your Honor.
QUESTION;

But if it were remanded for reconsidera­

tion in tli© light of this new directive, might that not have
something to do with their view of the matter?
MR. KEENAN:

It might indeed, Your Honor, but I

respectfully submit that question is not before the Court, and
that the purposes of, first of all, efficiency and national
administration, and the speedy justice would be much better
served if this Court were to retain its jurisdiction and to
decide the case on th© merits,.
This case is about three and a half years old
already, Your Honor, and the named plaintiffs and -the members
of the plaintiff class have — if their contention is
correct, they have suffered a violation of their rights to
categorical assistant payments under the Social Security Act.
If this Court sees fit to remand and then sends it
back to the district court, two of the judges of which are no
longer available to sit — one of the judges, of course, being
Judge Stevens — then it’s going to be another lengthy and
complex process before the case can be resolved.
I think if this Court were to retain it3 jurisdiction
and decide the case on its merits, -that would avoid'the
problem of — the possibility of Illinois and other States
continuing their conflicting interpretation, continuing

12

their position that this October *74 progr«am guideline is
not binding, is not an accurate representation of what the
Social Security Act requires.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Keenan, in your prayer for relief, on

page 16 of the Appendix, consisting of a number of paragraphs,
(a), (b) , (c) t (d), (©) , and (f) , looking at paragraph {©) you
ask “That the three-judge court enter a final judgment
permanently enjoining the State Director'... agents, et cetera,
acting in concert ... from enforcing,applying, or executing
Illinois Revised Statutes ... and Illinois Family Services
Placement Management, as written, because said statutes and
regulations violate

equal protection of the law as guaranteed

by Plaintiffs by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution
of the United States.w
New, that's the only thing I can find in your prayer
for relief that suggests a basis for* invalidating those
statutes.

And that is strictly a constitutional claim.
MR. KEENANs

That is correct, Your Honor.

I would

respectfully ask this Court to entertain the rul© of construc­
tion of pleadings 'that's particularly on cases that are
decided in summary on a motion to dismiss or on a summary
judgment, as 'this case was, -that if the weal pleaded facts
of the complaint set out any basis on which the trial court
can grant relief, that the Court should grant that relief
whether or not that issue is raised upon the law.

The facts

13

of the complaint were well pleaded.
filed on both sides.

There were affidavits

We respectfully urge that for purposes

of this Court's jurisdiction* that the district court should
have, notwithstanding the failure to pray for an injunction on
strictly statutory interpretation grounds in the prayer, that
the district court should have recognized that issue, seized
it, and granted the relief.
law.

In other words, the law is the

If the Illinois scheme is in fact in violation of the

Social Security Act, then first the trial court, and. then I
would respectfully ask that this Court recognize that and
enter the appropriate judgment.
I would respectfully ask this Court to consider the
effects of reversal.
increased expenditures

The State may take the position that
will be the result if the present

foster care payment scheme in Illinois is invalidated.
We respectfully urge upon this Court that that would not follow.
What would in fact happen if relatives were available for
foster care placement, that first there would be a movement, of
children who are now placed in strangers* homes into the homes
maintained by their relatives.

That would mean two things:

First, there would be a number of already licensed,
already recruited, and already available foster homes maintained
by strangers that Illinois could place its wards in.
Second, I think there would be a movement of these
children out of institutional placements into placements with

14
relatives.
A third possible effect would be that the process of
recruiting foster homes would be much simplified.

Under the.

present scheme the placement worker does not look first to the
relatives for a place in which to put the child5. even though
the Federal law requires that, even though the State law
requires it.

The Federal law is unquestionably clear that if

it is at all possible for a ward

of the State to live with

relatives, that that would be the best placement for the ward.
QUESTION:
MR. KEENAN:

Why don111 they do it?
They don’t do it, your Honor, because

of the scheme which precludes licensing of relatives, and in
the placement worker's mind that prevention of licensing means
that they simply don't look first at the relatives? they look
first at strangers, and the result is that as soon as the
child is declared a ward of the juvenile court, the placement
worker, who has a heavy case load and is under pressure to
move the child from the home that the court has, cf course,
ordered the child removed from, must find a place quickly.
And the first place they look is an already licensed foster
.home, because that has been the practice in the State and
because that's -the way the statute is set up.
Too often placement workers have approached a
relative and said, "Can you take in this child who is a ward
of the court?"

15
The relative said, as did the plaintiffs in this

er 3

case, "We would like to, but we cannot afford it, we cannot
afford to subsidize what is clearly the State's obligation."
QUESTION:

Do you say it is irrational for a State

to proceed on the assumption that kinfolk, if we may call them
that, have a greater obligation to take care of their
relatives than strangers?
MR. KEENAN:

Plaintiffs respectfully urge that what

is illegal cannot be rational in terms of equal protection
jurisprudence.
QUESTION:
MR. KEENAN:

Well, that doesn!t answer the question.
I think it would not be rational because

such a position on the part of the State of Illinois would be
based on a mistake of law.
QUESTION:

Has it not been the tradition, going back

not just to the history of this country, but to all civilised
people, that people take care of their own?
MR. KEENAN:

It is, of course, a tradition, your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, that tradition, you say, cannot

form a rational basis for 3.egislative action.
MR. KEENAN:

That tradition cannot form a rational

basis for legislative action in the United States in 1970, your
Honor, particularly when the Illinois legislature has stated
that the only parsons who

ar© responsible for the care of

16

children are the natural and adopted parents.

The Illinois

legislature by enacting that law recognized that willing as
the relatives might be to discharge their moral duty# if the
Court please# and to take in and take care of their relatives,
that it is simply not economically feasible.

And I would

respectfully say to the Court once again what occurred in this
case.

The Youakims subsidized the State's obligation as heavily

as they could.

They took in two of the children and kept them

for as long as they can, but they couldn't take in the other
two because they couldn't afford two further.
The State has the obligation to maintain those
children.

Congress has recognized that they are more

expensive to maintain than children who are kept in the homes
of

parents

or caretaker relatives.

It seems that in light

of the clear expression by the Congress that these children
should be placed with relatives, enactment by the Congress of
the economic tools in which to arrange it, and the statement
by the Illinois legislature that no one save the natural or
adopted parents or the State guardian has the legal duty to
take care of it, that then it is not rational for the State
to proceed on that assumption given the economic realities of
the State of Illinois right now.
QUESTION:

When they go into the home of a person

who is related, there are no standards -- I will put that as
a question.

Are there any standards by which the environment

17
R

5

can be measured by the State, as distinguished from going into
the home of a licensed foster parent?
MR. KEENAN:

The standards which are imposed upon

the plaintiff related foster parents are identical to the
standards imposed upon all other foster homes.

The duties of

the plaintiff related foster parents are identical to the duties
of all foster parents in the State of Illinois.

The expense

of maintaining a larger home? one that has a separate bedroom
for the foster chiId, or maintaining a clean home,of maintaining
higher standards of child care, of maintaining a better family
environment according to the detailed regulations set out in
the requirements for foster homes in Illinois, are all imposed
upon the plaintiffs.

The only thing that doesn’t come along

with the package is the financial assistance to the child
which the child needs to stay in such a home.
It costs the same, and I think the State should
concede that it costs the same, to maintain a child in a foster
home maintained by his relatives as it costs to maintain a
child in a foster home maintained by strangers.

Certainly

they have to comply with the same standards, certainly they
have to submit to the same amount of government intervention,
they have to file the same reports, the parents have the same
duties.
Yet, only in the case of the plaintiff children
does the State say to the children, t!We will not pay your

18

expenses, and unless your relatives are willing to subsidize
part of my" —■ that is, the State's —- "guardianship obligation
to support you, you may not live in what the Congress has
declared to be the best possible placement for you»"
QUESTIONS

Were you aware of this program instruction

when the case was in the district court?
MR. KEENAN;

The program instruction was issued

after the district court's opinion was written, your Honor.
The district court filed its opinion in —
QUESTION:
MR. KEENAN:

January of *74?
January or February of '74, your Honor.

And the program instruction issued in October.
QUESTION:

October.

And then you took your notice

of appeal?
MR. KEENAN:

In April of '74.

So the record was

closed and the case was pending before this Court at the time
the program instruction issued.
I also note, your Honor, and I think it may be
important, that this Court invited the Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare to address itself in an amicus brief
to this.

That invitation issued to the Solicitor and thence,

I presume, over to the Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare in October of 1974. I think it not unreasonable to
conclude that this clarification resulted from -the legal
research, the considerable legal research that was done in the.

QUESTION:

May I suggest, though, Mr. Keenan, the

promulgation of the instruction, and I don’t find any reference

brief on the merits.

And he has not filed a

at the time that your appeal was pending, jurisdictional
statement, before we noted probable jurisdiction.
MR. KEENAN:

Yes, your Honor.

It is speculative on

my part that there is interlocking causation between those two
events.
QUESTION:

Why do you suggest there is no reference

to the instruction and the Solicitor did file in February?
MR. KEENAN:

Mr. Justice Brennan, I didn't v/rite the

brief for him, is the only answer I can possibly make.
I would, if the Court please, if there are no

QUESTION:

I take it from what you say you certainly

wouldn't object from a decision on your behalf based on the
statutory ground, whether the decision issued in the district
court or here.

I would not, your Honor.

I urge that

QUESTION:

You would like to get it over with.

20

MR. KEENAN:

I certainly would, and certainly a

decision from this Court would have a much quicker effect on
giving national uniform execution to title IV —
QUESTION:

Don't you agree, now that the statutory

ground has emerged clearly and you insist that it is in the case,
don't you agree that that has to be reached first?
MR. KEENAN:

I do, your Honor, and I am respectfully

urging that this Court reach that ground first and; if proper,
decide this case as it did the Townsend case, as it has decided
a series of other social security cases.
QUESTION:

What if the statutory ground had been

reached in the district court first and it had been decided in
your favor?

The case could never have gotten here directly.

MR. KEENAN:

That is correct, your Honor.

If there are no further questions at this time, I
would

respectfully reserve about 5 minutes of my time for

rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. KEENAN:

Very well.

Thank you, your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Bargiel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. BARGIEL ON
BEHALF OF APPELLEES
.MR. BARGIEL:

fir. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My name is Paul Bargiel; I am Assistant Attorney

21
General in the State of Illinois, and I represent the Illinois
Department of Children and Family Services in this matter.
I would respectfully suggest that the controversy
as presented involves two different aspects.

The first of

those is can a relative under the Social Security Act ever be
a foster parent?

And, secondly, if a foster parent is paid

additional assistance over and above what a relative is paid
to care for a needy and dependent child, can that violate the
equal protection clause?
I would like to direct myself to the first aspect of
the case at this time.
We would respectfully submit that the plain meaning
of the provisions of title IV of the AFDC program support the
conclusion that relatives are not foster parents and are not
eligible for aid under the provisions of section 608.

The

basic AFDC program set out in title IV defines essentially
three classes of needy
for aid.

dependent children who are eligible

Section 606 defines the first class and says that a

dependent child is one who is deprived of parental support for
certain specified reasons and lives with a relative specified
in section 606.
QUESTION;

Is this what the district court decided?

MR. BARGIEL:

Your Honor, the district court decided

that there was no denial of equal protection and it made the
determination that the Illinois welfare scheme rather than

22

running contrary to the Federal statute, parallels the Federal
statute.
QUESTION:

You didn51 present this argument to the

district court?
MR. BARGIEL:

We presented the argument

— or we

took the position that the Illinois welfare scheme was — to the
extent that it was presented, we took the position that the
Illinois welfare scheme was consistent with the Federal statute.
QUESTION:

I understand that, but did you make this

argument that you are making now to the district court?
MR. BARGIEL:
the district court.
QUESTION:

Well, I did not make the argument to

The argument was made that —
This argument takes you farther than the

district court took you, doesn’t it?
MR. BARGIEL:

That’s true, I agree with you, Mr.

Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

The State would be getting more relief

if we decided in your favor on this ground than it got in the
district court.
MR. BARGIEL:

I suppose that’s conceivable in that

the Federal district court only decided the equal protection
question.

But I think it certainly implied that the Federal

district court would have, had it considered, or had it made
specific findings with regard to the question of the consistency
of the Illinois welfare scheme to the Federal scheme, would

23
have found that in fact, or impliedly found, that there was
no inconsistency.
QUESTION:
take it.

That could be argued the other way, I

Since it did reach the constitutional question, it

must have been on at least the premise that the construction
is contrary to the one you reached the equal protection on.
MR. BARGIEL:

No, I would assume, your Honor, that

the district court,had it considered the statutory construction
question, would have had to determine the statutory construction
question in our favor, that is, that there was no difference
between the two.

It would have reached the —

QUESTION:

Is the construction you urge consistent

with this so-called clarification?

Does the HEW, in other

words, agree with you on that?
MR. BARGIEL:

No, I think that's quite clear the IIEW

does not agree with us.

And that is again one of the reasons

that we are urging this position.

That, in addition to the

memorandum which was filed which Mr. Keenan referred to by the
Solicitor General.
QUESTION:

Are you going to follow this or not?

MR. BARGIEL:
Honor?

Are we going to follow what, your

The new program instruction?
QUESTION:

Yes.
x

MR. BARGIEL:
QUESTION:

Uh~~

Have you taken any steps to do it?

24

MR. BARGIEL:

To my knowledge, no steps have been

taken at this particular -QUESTION;

What have you done?

MR. BARGIEL:

I don't know.

Just ignored it?

I don't think that the

State of Illinois is going to ignore it# but I certainly think
that the position of the Department of Children and Family
Services, as of the last time that I checked and currently,
is that the program instruction of HEW is erroneous and does
not —
QUESTION:

In other words, that it erroneously

construes the statute.
MR. BARGIEL:
QUESTION:

That is correct, your Honor.

The proper construction is the one you

urge, and if you are right, then Illinois does not have to
follow the construction.
MR. BARGIEL:
our current position.

That is correct, your Honor.

That is

At least it's current as of the time I

came here.
QUESTION:

And if you are right, then, as my Brother

White has suggested, you get more than is accorded to you by
the district court, because there is nothing in the district
court opinion that says that it would be improper or
unconstitutional for Illinois to pay related foster parents
the same as unrelated foster parents are paid.

That decision

of the district court simply says it is not unconstitutional

25
to pay them less»

But your argument now, your statutory

argument would be that it would be contrary to the statute to
even consider related foster parents as foster parents.
MR. BARGIEL:
QUESTION;

That is basically correct.

Or at least you say the State,under the

social security Act, doesn't have to pay them anything.
Related foster parents.
MR. BARGIEL:

No, that's not our position.

Our

position —QUESTION:

That's what I ~~

MR. BARGIEL:

No, your Honor.

Our position is that

related persons under the Social Security Act are not foster
parents.

By definition those two categories are mutually

exclusive.
QUESTION:

So they are not foster parents.

MR. BARGIEL:

That is precisely correct.

We don't

say —
QUESTION:

But they are parents for purposes of AF3C.

MR. BARGIEL:

They are relatives for purposes of

AFDC and eligible under section 606.
QUESTION:

Not as foster parents.

MR. BARGIEL:

Right.

But not as foster parents.

Our position is not that we don't have to pay them anything
but that they are not eligible for categorical assistance under
section 608.

My position was initially that I would think that

26
I would think, had the court considered, or if it did, and I
don't knqw except from the opinion, it would have impliedly had t<
come to the conclusion that the position we had taken was
consistent with the Social Security Act before it got to the
equal protection portion, or that traditionally is what they
should have done.
QUESTION;

It's opinion didn't show any evidence of

that, and perhaps responsive to what my Brother Rehnquist
has pointed out, the complaint really doesn’t make a statutory
claim.
MR. BARGIEL:
that.

I in all candor have to agree with

The question — I came to that realization as of a

couple of days ago, as a matter of fact.

It’s clear that the

complaint raises only an equal protection ground, and it’s
clear that the prayer for relief only asks for relief on that
basis, and the three-judge court’s opinion only makes one
small reference to the comparison between -the Illinois welfare
scheme and the statutory scheme.
At any rate, that position was argued by the
appellants, and I certainly did not want to be remiss in
responding to it.
If I may, then, I will very briefly move along and
say that our position with regard to the Social Security Act
is that section 606 sets out certain specified relatives and
says that chi3.dren who live with these relatives are eligible

27
for aid.

In father and mother, one of the specified relatives,

section 608, if you move along, defines a dependent child as
one who may, notwithstanding section 606(a) of this title,
shall also include a child who would meet the requirements of
this section 606(a), that is, that he would be living with a
certain specified relative, except for his removal after
April 30, 1961, from the home of a relative specified in
section 606.

And then if you drop down to —

QUESTION: Where are you?
MR. BARGIEL:

I'm sorry.

I apologise, your Honor.

1’» reading from the supplement to our brief, appendix, it's
A-9, and it sets out section 608 of the Social Security Act.
If I may, I will start again.
QUESTION:

I hope before you finish this discussion,

you will tell us why we should ignore the contrary interpretation
of HEW.

Ordinarily an agency's interpretation of a Federal

statute is something to which we give considerables respect,
isn't it?
MR. BARGIEL:

That is very definitely true.

I

certainly don't mean to be disrespectful in urging that that
particular program instruction is erroneous, but —
QUESTION:

What are th© principles that entitle us

to ignore it?
MR. BARGIEL:

Well, I think, first this Court has

on occasion certainly more than once come to the conclusion

28
that an HEW interpretation of a statute was erroneous.

I think

Burns v. Alcola was such a case.
Our position here is first that the Court ought to
look to the plain meaning of the words employed by the
Congress in the statute and attempt to discern the intent of
the Congress in enacting a particular section of the statute,
and if the intent can be discerned in that fashion, then it
ought to be followed.
And we are suggesting that section 608 defines a
>

class of needy dependent children.

It does so in terms which

are so unambiguous with reference to the Act, that only one
conclusion is possible, one conclusion is apparent.
is -that relatives are

And that

not foster parents.

And I say, if I may very briefly refer the Court to
the language employed there, it says at the beginning;
"the term 5 dependent child" shall, notwithstanding
section 606(a) of this title, also include a child who would
meet the requirements of such section 606(a) or of section 607
of this title except for his removal after April 30, 1961, from
the home of a relative as a result of a judicial determination."
And we submit that that part clearly indicates that:
section 608, the definition of dependent child is' to be
applied notwithstanding any specified relative in section 606,
and it’s also to include a new category — the employment of
the words"also include" indicates that this is a creation of a

29

new class»

And then it further defines the class as children

who are removed from the home of a specified relative.
And then if you drop down to about five lines from
the bottom to what is designated (a)(3) it says, "who has
been placed in a foster family home or child-care institution
as a result of such determination."
*

So we are suggesting there that the Congress has
employed the term "foster family home or child-care institution"
and above they have talked about removing a child from the
home of a relative.

And we would suggest that"foster family

home or child-care institution" means something other than the
home of a relative, because a child is removed from the home
of a relative and put into a foster family home or child-care
institution.
So we would suggest that that language indicates
that Congress intended that a foster family home was a nanrelated home.

And if you go on in that vary same provision,

if you go to page All, which continues the reproduction of
section 608, and you go to part (f), part (f) requires that
any State who intends to employ the foster care program also
have a plan which, in my language, the provision indicates,
in my language, is to rehabilitate the home from which the
child came so that hopefully the child can go back there.
And the
for

-language here says that it must include a provision

30

QUESTION:
BARGIEL:

What part of 11?
Yes.

Aril now?

A-ll, (f), your Honor.

I am reading

from (f).
It says that the State plan must include a provision
for development of a plan for each such child (including periodic
review

of the necessity for the child's being in a foster

family home or child-care institution) to assure that he receives
proper care and that services are provided which are designed
to improve the conditions in the home from which he was removed
or to otherwise make possible his being placed in the home of
a relative specified in section 606.
And we submit that this provision, this requirement
on the State has no meaning whatsoever once the child is
already in the home of a relative.

These children came, at

least as I understand it, from foster family homes where people
were unrelated to them, or they came from child-care institutions.
And this provision in the Social Security Act has no meaning
to the States, it has no meaning whatsoever if the purpose of
the provision is to require the State to enable these children
or €;nable the home from which they cams, which was an
unrelated home, to be such that the children can go back.
I agree with counsel that the children are in the
home

which is best suited for them, and they are not receiving

foster care any more.
these provisions.

I think that's the clear indication of

31

I think this provision also indicates that foster
care is temporary care, by definition.
a permanent place for any child.

It's not intended to be

And yet if you consider the

complaint which was filed in this particular case on behalf
of the plaintiffs and all the necessary inferences and
implications which come from that, they suggest that they are
in the best home which is possible for them, and the care
which they are receiving is not intended, at least on their
part, to be temporary care, but permanent care.
So we would submit that that also indicates that
these people are not foster parents, the children are not
foster children, and they are not receiving foster care,
certainly not under the terms of the Social Security Act.
That, in a nutshell, is our position with regard to
the Illinois welfare scheme as it comports to the Social
Security Act, and therefore the supremacy clause of the
United States Constitution.
We would also suggest that with regard to the equal
protection argument which is raised, that the distinction
between relatives and nonrelated foster parents is based upon
differences which are rationally related to the foster care
program»

*
Now, it’s clear that the statute which creates the

Illinois Department of Children and Family Services has as its
overriding purpose the care of all the neglected children of the

32
State of Illinois.

And that purpose is also reflected in the

Aid to Families with Dependent Children program.
QUESTION:

What would happen to them in the case —

I gather all these children were sent to relatives because
conditions at the foster home were not what were desired.

Is

that right?
MR. BARGIEL:

I don’t know if there is any

generalization which can be drawn -QUESTION:

Well, whatever the reason was, they were

in foster homes, nonrelated, were they not?
MR. BARGIEL:
QUESTION:

Right.

And they then went to the homes of

relatives.
MR. BARGIEL:

Yes.

I don't think that we can assume

from that, your Honor —
QUESTION:

Whatever the reason may be.

Now suppose

the relatives say, "We simply can't afford without this help
to keep them."

Then what happens to the children?

Do you have

to take them back and put them back in foster homes?
MR. BARGIEL:
your Honor.

There are two things that can happen,

One of the things which has not been expressed

to this point but appears in the brief is that although we
contend, and I do feel, that foster parents are not the same
as relatives and Congress would permit us to pay more money
because they also in the Social Security Act appropriate more

33

money for foster care, the State of Illinois has a policy which
is an exception to the rule whereby a related person who cares
for a child, who can prove that he has need of money in order
to continue to care for that child, can receive up to the full
amount of foster care.
QUESTION:

That is, a child —

(Inaudible)

MR. BARGIEL:
as a matter of fact,

These plaintiffs in this particular case
are receiving the $105 payment.

It's

true that when they brought this case they were receiving
$63 per month, which was the AFDC provision.

They subsequently

made application, or they made application at some time —
QUESTION:

MR. BARGIEL:
correct.

QUESTION s

payment?
MR. BARGIEL:
QUESTION:

They are not —

How and why are they getting it?

MR. BARGIEL:
QUESTION:

It's the same thing as.

Illinois ~~ pardon?

They mat the burden of showing that they

34

MR. BARGIEL;

That's right.

Illinois has a policy

whereby a relative who cares for a needy and dependent child
who can show that he has special need and requires more money
can get more money up to the same amount that one would receive
for foster care.

And if I am not mistaken, I was told by the

chief counsel of the Illinois Department of Children and
Family Services that this additional money, the difference
between the $63 and $105 is not matched by Federal funds but
comes from State funds.
QUESTION;

As I take it, your friend's position is

that the denial of equal protection arises out of the fact
that the true foster care category gets the $105 without any
showing, and Ms clients had to make a showing of need to get
the difference between $63 and $105.
MR. BARGIEL;

Is that right?

That very well may be.

Yes, I assume

that's true, your Honor, but if there is a QUESTION;

He wouldn't have any other —- the facts

being what they are now, that they are receiving the full
$105, he would have no other basis, would he?
MR. BARGIEL;

I would agree.

We think not.

But I

would say if there is a fault with that, in response to your
Honor's question, in that position of my adversary, if there
is a fault with that, then it's with the Social Security Act,
because the Social Security Act does not

the Aid to

Families with Dependent Children program — and the three-

35
judge court recognized this -—* does not consider the need of
the parent in determining whether or not a child is eligible
for aid.
QUESTION:

If your adversary is right that there is

a conflict here, that your interpretation of the Federal
statute is in error, and that you are obliged to pay under the
Federal statute, then instead of coining out of State funds,
the foster payment would in part at least come out of Federal
funds?
MR. BARGIEL:

I think that that’s certainly true,

given -QUESTION:

May I ask, though, if they

are in fact

receiving it, does the State make any claim here there is no
controversys at least as to these named plaintiffs and others
Was it certified as a class action?
MR. BARGIEL:

Yes, it was certified.

The three-

judge court found that there was a proper class.
QUESTION:

And yet all the named plaintiffs, you

understand are now receiving the full $105.
MR. BARGIEL:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

As to them is there still any controversy

MR. BARGIEL:

As to the named plaintiffs.

Well,

certainly there is no controversy in the sense that they have
anything to gain by this litigation.
QUESTION:

What about our Sousner decision -then?

36

MR. BARGIELs
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, your Honor, I8m not --

On whether or not there is still the

class action for us to decide if all the named plaintiffs
are without
MR. 3ARGIEL:

Well, now, I'm not sure whether I am

familiar with that or not.
QUESTION:

I would suggest that —

We could send it back to the trial court

to find out whether they are actually getting the money or not?
MR. BARGIELs

I think that's clear.

There is no

controversy as to whether or not they are getting the money.
I had submitted to the Court some xerox materials a couple of
months ago which indicate that the named plaintiffs are
receiving the extra money, and they have never contested that.
QUESTION:

What if you won here, would they continue

to get it?
\

MR. BARGIEL:
I don't think

I think without question, your Honor.

I realize, of course, that they received the

additional money after this litigation was started.

I frankly

don't think that that had anything to do with their receiving
the money.

As a matter* of fact, there were affidavits filed

in the lower court
QUESTION:

Is that the way the State is treating

all children living with relatives?
MR. BARGIEL:

According to an affidavit which I

believe was filed by one of the parties for plaintiffs' counsel

37

there were 1500 relatives who care for children who are
related to them, and of those 1500 140 are receiving the full
amount pursuant to this exception policy, which is about 10
percent of the entire class as designated by them of all these
persons.

And it's not clear that the entire 1500 have asked

for additional aid or attempted to show any need.

So certainly

they are not the only people -—
QUESTION:

There are other members of the class, you

can see there are other members of the designated class other
than the named plaintiffs.
MR. BARGIEL:
QUESTION:

Oh, unquestionably.

That’s true, yes.

Well, even these named plaintiffs are in

a different position from the foster home people in that if
the relatives cannot continue to maintain their showing of
need, they might go back down to $63 hypothetically.
MR. BARGIEL:
is.

That's conceivable, yes.

It certainly

I wouldn't —
QUESTION:

So there is a difference in the burden.

MR. BARGIEL:
QUESTION:

I am sorry, I'm not sure I —•

Difference in the burden in the sense that

they must show a need, the relatives must show a need above
$63.
MR. BARGIEL:

Unquestionably.

I say that’s true.

But again let me direct myself to the question that your
Honor first asked.

I don’t think there is any difficulty with

38
that on an equal protection basis because the Federal Act,
the Social Security Act itself, does not require, has nothing
to do with the need of the custodian who cares for the child.
It doesn't deal with that question at all under section 606
or 608 or 607.

Eligibility is determined by the need of the

child, and under section 608 it has to do with the home from
which the child is removed.
Under section 608, an unrelated millionnaire could
take in a neglected child, and that family would be eligible
for AFDC under section 608 if the home from which the child
was taken had been previously eligible.
So what I am saying is that need is not provided
for, at least need of the custodian,in the Social Security Act,
and it seems to me that there would be no difficulty with the
State saying in order to qualify for additional benefits which
are not yours to begin with you must show a need as a
custodian.
I will attempt to finish up very quickly.

I would

say here, too, that the plaintiffs, with regard to the equal
protection argument that is raised, the plaintiffs asked the
court to consider the plight of relatives who live with people
who are related to them who cannot afford to maintain those
children if they don’t receive the full foster care benefit.
On the other hand, I think their argument ignores the
fact that there are many neglected children in the State of

39
Illinois and in every State that don't have relatives to take
care of them, there just aren’t any, or there are relatives
who don’t consider or would not consider taking care of these
children.
Now, it's quite clear, as your Honor points out,
that people — it’s been traditionally true that people take
care of their own, people take care of their kin, and so on.
If the State of Illinois is going to be deprived of money
QUESTION;

I didn’t say they do so.

I said is that

not the tradition?
MR. BARGIEL;

Well, I think that is the tradition.

At least I think that it's fair to recognize that it's more
likely to happen than it is in a case where there is no
blood relation.
But at any rate if what counsel suggests is to
happen

and

the State of Illinois will be deprived of funds,

certainly everything won’t be raised to the $105 benefit.
The amount of money is going to stay the same and that will
be equalized probably somewhere between $63 and $105.
QUESTION;

You mean all foster homes will get something

less than $105.
MR. BARGIEL;
going to occur.

Right.

In all probability that is what-is

And then conceivably relatives will be able to

receive more money.
QUESTION;

Doesn’t foster care arise when the State

40

has made the child a dependent of the State?
MR. BARGIEL:

Well, under the definition, a child

would have to be removed from the home of a relative and
adjudicated a ward of the State.

Yes, that's true.

The

specific language is that he would have to be removed from the
home of a relative pursuant to a judicial determination.
QUESTION:

And Illinois' practice has been that

even when that happens, when we remove the child from the
home of a relative and then place the child with another
relative, you have not treated that relative as a foster
parent at all.
MR. BARGIEL:
QUESTION:

That .is precisely correct, your Honor.

What is the degree of relationship?

MR. BARGIEL:

The degree is the same -— I believe

the State statute is the same as tho Federal statute.
quoting now from page 11 of our brief.

I'm

Section 606(a) says

that the following relatives are eligible for assistances
That's father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, brother, sister,
stepfather, stepmother, stepbrother, stepsister, uncle, aunt,
first cousin, nephew, or niece.

That's the Federal statute.

Now, the State statute, which is, the pertinent
part is reproduced on page 13 of our brief in footnote 2»
That specifies -that the child or children must be living with
the grandfather, grandmother, brother, sister, stepfather,
stepmother, stepbrother, stepsister, uncle or aunt, or other

41
relative approved by the Department.
So it seems to me there is a direct parallel between
the State and Federal law.
QUESTION:

The Federal law certainly wouldn't require

the State to pay foster care amounts to a a mother.
MR. BARGIEL:
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. BARGIEL:
QUESTION:

The Federal law?

No.

I agree with you.

Or a grandfather.

It would only be when

tiie State adjudicates the person a foster child, or makes him
a dependent of the State.
MR. BARGIEL:
QUESTION:

No

Well, that's what the definition says that

you read us.
MR. BARGIEL:
your Honor's question.

I5m sorry.

Maybe I misunderstand

It says — the Federal law defines in

section 606 a certain class of relatives.

And as a matter of

fact* your Honors —
QUESTION:

I understand -that.

MR. BARGIEL:

OK.

And that class of relatives

includes father and mother.
QUESTION:

I understand.

MR. BARGIEL:

.And what I would suggest is that if a

sister in this case, when you considar section 606 and
*

section 603, if a sister can be a foster mother and her

42
brothers and sisters can be foster children, then there is
no reason why you can't ultimately get to a situation where you
have a chain of events which leads a child back to his father
or mother and have a natural father or mother be
QUESTION:

Do you understand your opponent’s position

to be that the Federal law requires foster care payments to
relatives even though the State has not adjudicated the child
and made it a dependent of the State?
MR, BARGIEL:

Oh, no.

You have to have — that I

agree with.
QUESTION:

All right.

As long as the State does

not and need not declare the child a foster child, its only
requirement is to pay AFDC?
MR. BARGIEL:

Yes, I certainly agree with that.

As

long as that doesn't happen and the child lives with a
relative, that is true.
QUESTION:

But your point is that the ultimate

extreme of your brother's argument could be that a foster
child, i.a., a child who had been made a ward of the State,
ends up in the home of his own mother or father and she gets
not AFDC payments, but she gets paid as a foster parent.
MR. BA.RGIEL:
QUESTION;

That is precisely correct.

You know that the only time that child

is removed from the family is for some reason.
reason would it bs?

Now, what

It wouldn’t be just to give them more

43

money.

It would be because the child isn't being cared for

properly.

Now, the State isn’t about to put it back in that

home that is declared to be unfit.
MR. BARGIEL:
QUESTION:

No, but it does have —

Not for a long time.

MR. BARGIEL:

It has an obligation to determine or

to see that that home can be --QUESTION:

I know, but they find another home, not

Right?
MR. BARGIEL:
QUESTION:

Well, certainly

it —

So it isn’t going to end up then in the

home from which it was removed.
MR. BARGIEL:

I think that it’s conceivable that it

ultimately cisuld at some time in the future.
QUESTION:

Does it happen often?

I mean, if a

mother has been declared unfit or a father declared unfit,
for that reason the child has-been removed from their care,
is it very likely that you are going to commit that child
to that mother and father again?
MR. BARGIEL:

I don't know whether it’s likely or

not, it's certainly conceivable.
QUESTION:

Does it happen?

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Keenan, you have about

six minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK A. KEENAN
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. KEENAN.

Once again, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
First, with respect to the suggestion of mootness,
three of the four named minor plaintiffs began receiving
the exception-to-policy payments which they considered to be
foster care payments, and 28 months after the suit was filed,
I think, as Mr. Justice Brennan said, the Sizenor case, and I
would also say this Court's recent opinion in Gerstein v. Pugh
and the Federal rule that says the State must apply to the
district court if it wishes to moot the case.
Second, with respect to the State’s contention that
the plaintiff related foster parents are not foster parents,
first I would cite the district court’s opinion where it named
them, the district court said they were foster parents.
Second, citing this Court to the Federal foster
care blueprint section, 408, of the Act, foster care payments
can be made to children placed in the home of any individual.
Now, undex: this Court’s opixiion in the Shea case, I
think any means any, and had Congress meant any individual to
mean any individual other than relatives, it would have in
section 408 —- if Congress had meant those payments to be denied

45
relatives, it would have set out in section 408 the enumerated
relatives in section 606(a)»

It did not.

When Congress said

foster care payments can be made to children who are wards of
the State placed in the home of any individual, it meant
precisely what it said.
The interpretation urged by the State of Illinois,
I think, is a tortured one, and I think the one urged by the
plaintiffs is a simple one.

Congress examined children who

had been removed from the home of their parents or a relative,
most usually their parents, and who are declared wards of the
State.

And it recognized that those children were more

expensive to care for, and it further recognized in section
401 of the Act that the best possible placement for those
children was with a relative.
I think it not relevant whether or not the child
was removed from the home of his parents or from the horae of
his relatives.

I think with respect to the question --

let me go back to that.
I think it not relevant the nature, whether or not
he was removed from his parents or his relatives, because he
meets the criterion, the characteristics of need, which the
Congress declared in order to make him eligible for the
categorical assistance payments under section 408.
»

QUESTION:

You concede that he certainly has to be

removed from the home of a relative and be made a foster child?

46

MR. KEENAN:
QUESTION:

Absolutely, your Honor.

Absolutely.

And the Social Security Act nor you can

force that to be done except for good cause.
MR. KEENAN:

Only at the discretion of the State's

Attorney in Illinois and on the judgment of the juvenile
court judge.
And the suggestion that foster care payments would
go down, the plaintiffs simply don't understand.

I think this

Court's opinion, or the decision in this case one way or another
is not. going to have any effect on the number of dependency
and neglect petitions that are filed in juvenile courts in
the State of Illinois.

And those foster care payments are

federally subsidized to the extent of $100.

I don’t see how

it is going to cost any more money one way or the other.
All that's going to happen is that these children
will not be placed in the homes of strangers, which the
Congress disapproves, but they will be placed in foster homes
maintained by their relatives, which would serve the purposes
of the Act and it would serve the purposes of the State law
to maintain its strength in families.

The named plaintiffs and the State?

MR. KEENAN:
QUESTION:

Absolutely.
Still?

MR. KEENAN:

Still.

Because the exception-to-policy

payments are discretionary and can be withdrawn at any time.
Congress meant those categorical assistance payments to be
made because of the nature, because of the characteristics of
the child, that is, that he was removed from the home -—
QUESTION:

You suggest if the State won it might

terminate the State —
MR. KEENAN:

It could tomorrow.

Yes.

Yes.

With respect, finally, to the Chief Justice’s
question about the tradition, it's true that traditionally
relatives take care of their own, but a lot of traditions in
this country were changed in the thirties whan the Social
Security Act 'was passed, and they have been continually changing
in light of the economic realities.

I think Congress recognized

those realities when it said that any child who was removed
from the home in which he was living and declared to be a ward
of the State has a right to categorical assistance payments
under the foster care scheme.

The district court found that the named plaintiffs
are such children.

This Court should recognise that they are

such children and it should secure them the rights and
eligibility for -those foster care payments.

It should do so

because -- I respectfully urge that it should do so because
that is required by the Social Security Act, by the policy of
the Federal and State laws , and by the equal protection
clause.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.
