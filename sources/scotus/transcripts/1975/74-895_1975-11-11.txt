MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 74-895, Virginia State Board of Pharmacy against
Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, et al.
Mr. Troy.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY F. TROY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. TROY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may

it please

the Court:
It has been traditional that the practice of
professions are to be above the morals of the market place.
This case presents the question of whether the practice of
pharmacy and the dispensing of drugs should be subject to the
morals of the market place.
Should presecription drugs be advertised?
The concerns of this case, however, are not only
in the professional pharmacy but, rather, in each and every
profession, law, medicine, optometry, dentistry and any other
prefession controlled by the state.
The true question, then, is the ability of a
legislature to regulate these professions within the economic
and social policies deemed provident.
In Virginia, the practice of pharmacy is a
profession.
assembly.

It has been deemed a profession by the general
It has been found a profession by the courts.

It is a profession from the time that the
pharmacist secures a drug through the time that he prepares
it, compounds it, dispenses it and delivers it to the patient»
Our brief, in footnote three, pages 6 and 7, sets
forth some of the statutes which comprise the scheme by which
the profession of pharmacy is regulated in the Commonwealth»
QUESTION:

MR. Troy, let me get this straight out.

How do you define a profession?
MR. TROY:

Your Honor, the General Assembly has

defined this profession.

It has defined it within the scheme-

work of what has traditionally been defined as pz*ofession.
A learned profession, requirement of a degree, a requirement
of some protection to the health, safety and welfare of the
people and in this case, it has been shown, not only by
statute but in the record itself that the pharmacist is the
last professional who interposes himself between a patient and
a drug.
He has a vital role in the medical health team.
Nov;, in 196 8, the Virginia General Assembly enacted
a measure prohibiting the advertisement of the price of
prescription drugs.
The history of that statute is set forth in the
Appendix at page 20 and I would point out here in response to
the Appellee's statement that the legislature enacted this
without any basis whatsoever.

5
The short answer is that since that 1968 enactment
the statute has been enacted or amended twice with full
knowledge of the 1969 federal court decision sustaining the
validity of this statute.
Now, the lecrislature declared by this statute that
any pharmacist who advertised would be guilty of unprofessional conduct.
The statute regulates only the conduct of the
pharmacist.
As the Appendix demonstrates and as Judge Butsner
of the Fourth Circuit found, speaking for the. three-judge
court in Patterson Drug Company v. Kingery, a pharmacist,
"Must have extensive knowledge of a wide range of drugs.
Accuracy is essential.

Mistakes can be serious."

Just four pages of the Appendix, pages 44-47
demonstrate, by the testimony of Mr. Carl Emswiller, a
pharmacist in nearby Loudon County, that a pharmacist plays
a

vital role in the health field and the dispensing of

drugs„
A pharmacist, in dispensing

drugs, is doing more

than what I, as a layman, would comprehend.

That is, taking

pills from a big bottle, counting to 25 or 30 and pouring
pills into a small bottle.
The entire educational training of a pharmacist
is geared to impart to him a knowledge greater than a

6

physician as relates to drugs, their chemical composition
and their reactions, contraindications or synergystic effects
of such chemical elements *
QUESTION:

Well, if that is the case, why doesn't

he write prescriptions?
MR. TROY:

I'm sorry, your Honor?

QUESTION:

If that is the case, why doesn’t he

write prescriptions?
MR. TROY:

The reason that he does not write

prescriptions, of course, is that his education is to the
extent of knowing the chemical elements of drugs and their
contraindications.
The doctor, of course, is the one that knows what
the therapeutic effect of these drugs is for the particular
disease that the doctor is prescribing [for.]

cases.

QUESTION:

And their contraindication.

MR. TROY:

And their contraindications in some

But as the record in this case —
QUESTION:

In some cases?

MR. TROY:

In some cases, yes, your Honor,

because, as the record shows in this case, pharmacists do
keep medical profile records containing a patient's allergies,
sensitivities or reactions to drugs.
For example, Mr. Emswiller detailed — again on
the Appendix pages 44 through 47 — two instances of the

7
utilisation and value of the medical profile card.
Among typical examples, he detailed two instances
where medical profile records assisted in the dispensing of
drugs,

One, an example of a patient taking a blood pressure

tablet which would have, due to a chemical element in such
tablets, potentiated the anesthesia that was about to be
administered preparatory to surgery.
Another specific example was a patient taking a
tranquilizer who was then prescribed a different type of
tranquilizer.

The second one had what was known as an

MAO inhibitor, in short, a drug which would interfere in the
manner in which the body was utilizing the former drug.
Due to the nature of these drugs, it was necessary
that a two-week period elapse.prior to the administration of
the second drug for a prolonging and intensifying of the
former drug would have occurred in the body with serious
overdose and drug side effects.
The record before this Court demonstrates that the
profession of pharmacy is completely entwined in the
dispersing of prescription drugs.
QUESTION;

What happens if somebody gives a

prescription to their butler and tells him to go over and
get it filled?
MR. TROY:

Under the medical profile records that

a pharmacist would have, your Honor, the prescription, of

8
course,, would be written in the name of the individualj the
record would be in the name of the individual.

The pharmacist.,

by looking at the record and comparing the prescription about
to be filled, could tell if there would be any side effects.
QUESTION:

Well, can he fill one with somebody that

he doesn't have a record of?

sal.

MR. TROY:

Can he?

Yes, he can, yotir Honor.

QUESTION:

Well, of course.

So this isn't univer­

I mean —
MR. TROY:

No, by no means universal.

QUESTION:

Sometimes people just send it in and

send the money and if you put down the money, you get the
prescription.
MR. TROY:

Exactly, your Honor and as Judge Butzner

found, speaking for the three-judge court, that although
monitoring is not completely effective because of the mobility
of customers or because of the availability of non-prescrip­
tion, OTC items that could be antagonistic, it is not a
perfect cure but it is a benefit to the public.
QUESTION:

Mr, Troy, you have mentioned the

importance of druggists compounding drugs.

As I understand

the stipulation, 95 percent of the drugs dispensed do not
require compounding by the —
MR. TROY:

That is exactly correct, your Honor and

it could be even a little more but the point is, and as

9
pointed out in the Appendix,, that today as compared to prior
years when druggists used to compound drugs, today we are
talking about drugs that have a benefit of curing rather than
just a palliative effect as in the old days of compounding
and these drugs, while they have the benefit of curing, have
also the benefit and ability to do great harms and as in the
example of Mr. Eraswilier, where there was a drug that he
dispensed that did not have to be compounded, nonetheless,
he knew that if he gave that second drug, that that patient,
since it had not been a two-week elapsed period of time,
would have been harmed by that drug, notwithstanding that it
was a drug that was not compounded.
QUESTION:

Mr. Troy, may I ask, I don't quite

understand how this argument addresses the question that you
presented, whether or not. the First Amendment, the prohibition
of price advertising is a violation of the First Amendment.
Is that the issue we have?
MR. TROY:

Yes, exactly, your Honor,

QUESTION:

And does everything you have been

saying have any bearing if it does?
MR. TROY:

Yes, your Honor, for this reason —

QUESTION:

I can understand if you were

arguing a compelling interest argument, assuming that there
was a First Amendment protection, but I thought the question
you gave us was whether or not commercial advertising had

10
First Amendment protection.
MR. TROY:
connection.

Yes, your Honor and this is the

The statute here is a measure addressed to the

public health.

It is, as Mr. Justice Stewart found in Head

and has described similar statutes, "Within the most
traditional concept of what is compendiously known as the
police power."

But the local —

QUESTION:
First

Wasn’t Head a due process case, not a

Amendment case?
MR. TROY:

Exactly, yes it was, your Honor.

The lower court paid lip service only to the
principles announced in these cases in Semler, Head,
Williamson and it found that this was not a 14fch Amendment
case but rather, was a First Amendment case because it
violated consumers' right to know.
QUESTION:

And you disagree with

this?

MR. TROY:

Yes, your Honor, for this reason.

QUESTION:

You say, then, this is a due process

MR. TROY:

No, your Honor, this is, in the context

case?

in which it has been framed for us by the lower court, a
First Amendment case.

But the lower court simply ignored

Fourteenth Amendment cases and under the guise of the First
Amendment, then examined the wisdom of the Virginia statute
and absent a convincing explanation for its wisdom, it struck

11
it down.
Now, somehow it reasoned that approaching this
from a consumer viewpoint would not ba an intrusion upon the
state's regulation of pharmacies,
I suggest that the court’s decision is analytically
unsound.

It has set at war the First and the Fourteenth

Amendments,
How can there be a constitutional right to receive
information which the state has a legitimate and constitu­
tional right under the Fourteenth Amendment in prohibiting
the dissemination of that very same information?
There can only be two answers.
right to know is a concommitant right.
independent right which would allow

One, that the

It is not an

access to

any informa­

tion, commercial or otherwise, which perhaps has an economic
impact upon the

consuming public.

The second answer is that an independent
constitutional right would exist and consequently, if so,
Semler, Head, Williamson and like cases must be Overruled.
The two are diametrically opposed and cannot stand together.
Now, this Court has not granted a right to know
where there has not been a concommitant First Amendment right
to speak.
QUESTION:

What is the state's interest in

permitting the advertising?

To forbid — to do away with

12
competition?

Or what?

MR, TROY:

Ho, your Honor, it is a health matter»

QUESTION?

Well, I know, but how does it protect

MR» TROYs

As I have indicated — let me answer

health?

this directly.

This is exactly as in the Head situation

where the statute was upheld because consumers could put the
needs of their pocketbooks above the remedial needs,
QUESTION:

So if you advertised price — so-called

"price cutting," you think it might lead everyone to

cut

prices, which lowers profits which would put the druggist in
a poorer position to do his job.
MR, TROY;

Is that

it?

As an attorney with some anti-trust

background, I would be the first to concede that advertising
does generate price competition but the purpose of this
statute is that the General Assembly, in its wisdom, has
decided that the delivery of a prescription drug is part and
parcel entwined with the health care that must be given,
QUESTION:

All right, now, how does advertising
"f

impinge on that?
MR. TROY:

The advertising, of course, would

induce consumers to think of this as a mere commodity and
would be deceptive in and of itself because they would not
realize what —
QUESTION:

Well, the General Assembly, in its

13
wisdom, hasn't —- doesnt

fix prices on drugs and it

doesn't prevent a druggist from cutting a price at the
request of a consumer.
MR. TROY:

That is correct, your Honor.

This has

no effect on prices.
1

QUESTION:

And it wouldn't prevent, I suppose,

consumers picketing a drugstore to say that the druggist was
charging too high a price.
MR. TROY:

Mo, I don't think it would at all.

QUESTION:

And it wouldn't even prevent one

druggist from picketing another.
MR. TROY:

Well, the statute —

QUESTION:

Would it?

MR. TROY:

— does not intend to regulate price.

QUESTION:

So if a druggist wants to sell the

Would it?

drugs more cheaply than his competitors, he may do so without
interference.
MR. TROY:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

Well, but doesn't — if you are

talking about a Fourteenth Amendment type of analysis where
you talk about any conceivable set of of facts, don't you
have to get back to Justice White's earlier question that if
you have price advertising you are going to have price
wars and if the pharmacist does have a responsible position
the less he can charge for the unit the less time he is able

14
to devote to supervising its distribution»
MR» TROY:

Well, that is perhaps an analysis.

Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION;

Thank you.

[Laughter»3
MR. TROY;

The

sorry — that came out.

What 1

meant to say is that, though we did not rely on that analysis
per se in the lower court, what we felt was that this
monitoring situation, if you have advertising, you are going
to induce patrons, patients, to shop around — to shop from
pharmacy to pharmacy and by not having price advertising,
you are, in effect, creating a system whereby perhaps a
physician-pharmacist-patient relationship would exist.
Now —
QUESTION:

Does the law prevent me from writing a

letter to my friends in the Lodge — if I belong to one —
that there is an awful good price in certain drugs at a
certain drugstore?
MR. TROYs

No, sir,

QUESTION:

So anybody — everybody but the druggist

can advertise the fact that there is a cut rate druggist
down the street.
MR. TROY;

Exactly.

And the fact is, of course, that the statute
does not in any way intend to state to a consumer that you

15
cannot shop around.

We cannot protect all consumers.

The General Assembly,, however, on the basis of
the record, found that there was a rational relationship
between monitoring -- between having patients go to the same
pharmacist and consequently, on that basis, enacted the
statute»
QUESTION:

Does the record show that they do go

to the same pharmacist?
MR. TROY:

Well, in those cases where the

monitoring has worked, of course, yes, your Honor.

The

record would show that there are examples where people have
come back time and time again and have been stopped from
taking «antagonistic drugs.
Now, to remove the price restrictions would, I
agree, create retail incentive for price competition but
where is the constitutional right for the lowest price
possible?
QUESTION:

Does this law reach the pharmacist who

puts a sign on his prescription counter that says, "I sell
drugs 10 percent 1q3s than you can buy them anywhere else"?
MR. TROY:

Yes, it would, your Honor.

There is,

under the Patterson v. Kingery decision, which was in 1969,
an agreement, of course, that you could issue a discount.
When that case first came before the court, the
words"issue, advertise or promote a prescription drug" was

16
the language of the statute.
The court,, in upholding the statute, struck out
the word "issue" and on that basis, of course, senior
citizen discount plans of 10 percent have been in effect in
the Commonwealth but —
QUESTION;

Well,(pan he put on something — my

price for some of these, oh, say, Achromycin tablets — on
his prescription counter as $2?

Can he do that?

MR. TROY;

No, I don't think he could under this

QUESTION;

But if you ask him what his'price is,

statute.
*

he can certainly tell you.
MR. TROY;

Yes, sir.

QUESTION;

And then you can go outside and tell

everybody else you want to.
MR. TROY;
the next pharmacist.

You could, or you could go down to
You could shop around.

QUESTION;

Yes, right.

MR. TROY;

The state, just because it creates

a system which it feels protects health, does not necessarily
mean that you as a consumer have to accept what the state
is, in fact, trying to protect you from.
QUESTION;

Well, must we take account of a First

Amendment here of the druggist?
MR. TROY:

Or not?

The First Amendment interest of the

17
druggist, your Honor —
QUESTION:

Is there any

First Amendment interest

to the druggist to take account of in this case?
MR, TROY:

No, I do not think so, for this reason --

QUESTION:

Well, what if there is.

MR. TROY:

Well, if there is, then I suggest that

you have a balancing test and the balancing

would be the

governmental interest in regulating versus any First Amend­
ment rights that may be existing.
This brings U3 to this Court’s recent decision in
f

.. i

Bigelow.
QUESTION:

Mr. Troy, I wanted to be suie you would

touch upon Bigelow because you didn't

course, was filed before Bigelow came down —

r,

MR, TROY:

Yes, your Honor,

QUESTION:

— and

S \ ■

you haven't seen fit to file

a supplemental so I am particularly interested in your comment.
MR, TROY:

Simply because Bigelow is simply not

applicable for this reason:
In this case, what is advertised is commercial
advertising in its purest sense.

Phrases 3uch as "compare,

save, pay less or dial-a-discount" do not, as found in
Bigelow, convey information of interest regarding the fora,
the subject matter of the law in another state or advertised
activity which pertains to a constitutional interest.

Such phrases

do no wore than simply propose a
They are entitled to little, if any,

constitutional weight.
Now, as I have said, those phrases would create,
perhaps, a retail incentive for price competition but again,
where is the constitutional right to the lowest price
possible?
Trying to ensure the lowest price is, in a
content in itself, a wise economic policy.. It is not,
however, I suggest, a constitutional prerequisite.
For example, does every victim of an anti-trust
price-fixing conspiracy have a cause of action for violation
of First Amendment rights, notwithstanding the Parker Brown
decision.
If e. balancing of whatever First Amendment
interests are involved must be made, then, as I have stated,
it should be done in light of this Court’s recognition for
over 40 years of the inherent interests of the state through
its police power to regulate the various professions.
Since, in this case, it is the manner by which
price information is disseminated and not the actual
dissemination of price information itself that is regulated,
then the balancing, if any, must be done as it was in
McDonald, not under a compelling interest doctrine but under

.19

the rational relationship test.
In the instant case, that test has been applied
and the statute has been found not wanting.

It has been

found, by a district court whose decision was declared to
have no infirmity by the lower court, to have a statute
before it which had a rational and reasonable basis.

The

Virginia statute, wise or foolish, economically sound or
improvident, should be sustained.
By doing so, this Court will be sustaining the
constitutional framework that legislative bodies, not courts,
must decide the wisdom of economic and social policies.
We cannot and should not turn back the clock for
40 yee.rs under the guise of an independent right to know
which would begin anew the scrutiny of wisdom of legislative
choicer in the health regulatory and other professional
fields.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Morrison.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN B. MORRISON, ESQ„
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. MORRISON:

Mr, Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This is a First Amendment case.

There is only one

question and that is the constitutionality of the Virginia
statute which prohibits the advertising of the price of
prescription drugs.

20

The Pharmacy Board below, on

its brief in this

Court, relied on Valentine against Chrestensen for the
proposition that commercial advertising is entitled to no
protection under the First Amendment,
Now, whatever the merits of that position may
have been before June 16th of last year when this Court
decided Bigelow, that position simply has no merit today,
Bigelow clearly and unmistakeably forecloses any
fraud argument based on Valentine that all commercial
advertising is outside ths First Amendment,
Bigelow said you have got to look at the
information being cc-nveyed.

You have got to balance the

interest in having that information conveyed against the
interest of the state in prohibiting the dissemination, the
traditional kind of First Amendment balancing.
Bigelow said you have to find a clear relationship
between the prohibitions and the goals of the state.

Now,

Bigelow did not specifically decide whether, under the line
of cases, it did rely upon the cases such as the New York
Times and Sullivan and Pittsburgh Press,which were precursors
and we say whatever Valentine once stood for, it now only
relates to the manner in which the distribution may be
controlled by the state.
Counsel for the Pharmacy Board today said, well,
Bigelow is not a commercial advertising case.

21
Let me read you from the brief that the State of
Virginia put in the Bigelow case last year.
Counsel for the State of Virginia was the same
counsel exactly as on the brief today and let me read you
from page 7, referring to the advertisement in Bigelow;
"Appellant3 s conduct is clearly within the hard
core of commercial activity unprotected by the First
Amendment 0"
Page 9, "The advertisement, therefore, can only
be viewed as a proposal for the sale of services."
Page 11, "Quite simply, it —"

the advertisement --

"does no more than propose a commercial transaction."
That is exactly what they contended here today.
That is what they contended last year and that is what we
suggest today is what went on in Bigelow.
There was, essentially, a commercial transaction.
True, it was for the sale of services for abortions as
opposed to the sale of pills but, essentially, in terms of
the
the First Amendment kind of analysis, that is,/First Amendment
has no applicability to commercial transactions, the
proposition is the same.
Now, as the Court is aware, the traditional First
Amendment analysis requires that the state is unable to
prevail unless it can show both a compelling state interest
and that it has accomplished that interest by the least

22

restrictive alternative possible.
That particular mode of analysis was not
specifically adopted in Bigelow, nor was it rejected.

The

court si.mply said a clear relationship has to be shown.
Now, we believe that as in Bigelow, it wasn't
necessary to decide whether all First Amendment analyses
carry forth with those compelling state interests and the
least restrictive alternative.
You don't have to decide that question here today
because whichever way you strike the balance, the scales
tips so heavily in favor of public disclosure of this
information under the First Amendment that under

even the.

most relaxed rational relationship test the plaintiffs will
prevail.
I'd like to turn for just a moment before
weighing —
QUESTION:

Bigelow involved, did it not, the

criminal conviction of the publisher of the newspaper?
MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

It did, your Honor.

And this case involves

there is no

newspaper, of course, involved in this case.
MR, MORRISON:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

This case involves, what, an action

for declaratory judgment?
MR. MORRISON:

And Injunction.

23
QUESTION;

And an injunction?

MR. MORRISON:

Yese sir* we sought the convening

and retainment—- the conveing of a three-judge court and
hence the direct appeal to this Court because of the
injunction that was granted below.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

Let me say a word about —

No free press question in this case,

is there?
MR. MORRISON:
newspaper.

Well, none of the plaintiffs is a

Although, of course, the effect of this law —

although none of the plaintiffs is a newspaper — is to
prohibit newspapers — indeed, newspapers in the District of
Columbia that sell in Maryland and in Virginia from
dissipating information about prescription drugs in Virginia
so while none of the plaintiffs is a newspaper, it plainly
has ar. effect on newspapers and it :Ls only an indirect
effect because, of course, no pharmacist would place an ad
in a newspaper knowing that he would be subject to disciplinary
proceedings for having done so.
QUESTION s

Is this law directed at all against

newspapers?
MR. MORRISON:

MR» MORRISON:

/

[Laughter.]
I8d like to talk a

little bit about these

Fourteenth Amendment cases and what we have here.
QUESTION:

If you are right that this will not --

the Virginia statute would not survive even a rational basis
test, 1 would think you could prevail on the Fourteenth
Amendment as well as on the First,
MR. MORRISON:

Well, it is not clear that after

North Dakota Pharmacy that I can even make a substantive due
process argument under the Fourteenth Amendment

25
Indeed, we had such a count in our complaint.
We were about to go to argument before the three-judge court.
A

week or two before, this Court decided North Dakota

Pharmacy.

Seeing that that was not our best point at that

time, we withdrew that claim from the District Court and
believed that we had a strong First Amendment claim and that
we chose to base our contention on that.
I don't think North Dakota Pharmacy can be read
so broadly as to prohibit any substantive due process
challenge, but we didn't consider that it was appropriate for
r

us to go under: it here and we made that decision.
Talking about the Fourteenth Amendment cases
cited, Williamson, Semler and Head, there is two important
points to note about that.
First, that those cases analyzed the question
only from the Fourteenth Amendment point of view.
Footnote 10 in the Bicelow case last year at
page 15

of the slip opinion specifically notes the fact

that Head, in particular, did not consider the First Amend­
ment challenge because it had not been properly brought
before this Court.
Second, the same thing is true and was emphasized
in the Pittsburgh Press case.
387 of 413

Again, footnote 10 at page

U.S. so this Court has recognized on two

separate occasions that those cases do not involve First

26

Arnen ebrient =
But aside from the fact that they don’t involve the
First Amendment, I think the most important thing to note
about reading those cases is that there is not one word of
mention any place in there about the interest that the
consumers have in finding out this information and I'll talk
about that interest in a minute but regardless of whatever
the extent of the interest is, the fact that consumers
have an interest in finding out how much they are going to
have to.pay for drugs that may save their lives in this
case is a kind of question that was never even considered.
QUESTION:

Is that a constitutional interest that

you are talking about?
MR. MORRISON:

Yes, it is, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

It is the right to receive information under the First Amend­
ment and the concommitant right on the part of the pharmacist
to speak freely and while the pharmacist is subject to
requisition under the Fourteenth Amendment,

there are still

specific First Amendment prohibitions that cannot be over­
ruled .
For instance, this Court, in NAACP against Button,
absolutely clear that lawyers are subject to regulation as a
profession under the Fourteenth Amendment but when the lawyers
tried to cloak all of their actions in, we are a profession,
we are subject to regulation, this Court said no, you can'-t

27

ride roughshod over the First Amendment associational rights
specifically guaranteed

under the general guise of

regulations.
QUESTION s

But what about your — if your

argument is applied to the legal profession, putting aside
the anti-trust problem, is the state bar

regulation pro­

hibiting lawyers from advertising a violation of the First
Amendment?
MR. MORRISON:

Well, I want to answer that

question directly because it is something that has been
alluded to a number of times.
QUESTION:

That is your next case.

MR. MORRISON:

The first point I want to make is

that the mode of analysis employed in Bigelow

that we are

seeking to have employed here requiring the recognition of
a First Amendment right and requiring the balancing of the
two kinds of interests, that is, the interest on the one
hand in obtaining the information, the specific items of
information that we are talking about as against the interest
that the state has in precluding the dissemination of that
information, that kind of balancing test would most
definitely have to be engaged in in a case similar tc the
one that you suggested.
Nov/, the second point I want to make and this is,
again, very important, we cannot predict the outcome of that

28
case now because we don't know, first, what kind of informa­
tion we are talking about»
I can see wide distinctions, for instance, between
information about what a lawyer charges on a specific per--hour
basis on the one hand and a lawyer who attempted to make the
same kind of guarantees that the dentist did in a similar
case, saying "I guarantee no pain —" whatever the legal
equivalent of that may be — and”I guarantee satisfaction»"
Those are different kinds of questions and they
would have to be looked at differently on one side of the
scale.
Similarly, we don’t know and we don’t have a
record, as we nave here, on what specific justifications the
Sar would put forth»

Here, we have the monitoring justifi­

cation .
We can sit down.
"Does that make any sense?

We can analyse it.

We can say,

Does it come close to promoting

a goal that the state has an interest in and does —
QUESTION:

Now, in weighing, on your submission,

the state's interest, do we get any help in evaluating the
state’s interest out of 'Williams and those other cases?
MR. MORRISON;

Well, I think that those cases do

stand for the proposition that the state has an interest in
seeing that professionals do not engage in what v/e call over­
reaching activities and it may very well be that in the

29

context of analyzing what professionals who, after all, are
licensed by the state, given an imprimatur of going out to
the public and say, you are a professional.

The state says

that /ou can do a good job.
The state nay well — and I don’t suggest that
there is a definite answer — but may well be able to say,
hold on.

YOu can’t say the sane thing to soap makers.
QUESTION:

But you can’t do that, I gather, from

what you are suggesting there.

Your next step is going to be

that you can’t do that as to the consumer.
ME. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

Well, the —

If they are evaluating the conduct of

the professionals themselves, that is one thing, but here you
are talking about whether the consumer is entitled to this
information.
MR. MORRISON:

No, I

would say, Mr. Justice

Brennan, that both of those interests can properly be focused.
We can focus on the entire transaction.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. MORRISON:

I^nd I do not mean to suggest that

the state could not focus on it.
QUESTION:

All right.

MR. MORRISON:

Indeed, I think there are very many

important consumer interests that can be protected against
by deceptive and fraudulent advertising.

All I am suggesting

30
is that in the context of a particular case with regard to
the regulations of a particular profession, we have to look
at the particular information under the kind of analysis we
are suggesting here and look at the state's rationale for
prohibiting the dissemination of it judged against the
interests of both parties, the disseminator of the informa­
tion and the person who is going to receive it.
QUESTION:

And what do you perceive as the reasons

for preventing this dis —
MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. MORRISON:

In this case?
In preventing the dissemination.
Well, the only ones that have been

suggested is the fact that pharmacy is a profession and I
think that the NAACP against Button case

eliminates that as

a blanket excuse for all kinds of First Amendment restrictions.
And the second is the monitoring argument.
is the only other one that has been put forward here.

That
I

would suggest arguments that have been raised in other cases
and I'll just deal with them quickly, if I may.
First, it is suggested ---QUESTION:
do you tie that in?

Well, what about the monitoring?

Iiow

I mean, why does that fit in as a

reason?
MR. MORRISON:
all, obviously

'Well, I don't think it fits in at

31

QUESTION:

Nell, yes, but I gather that unless

the pharmacy makes an adequate profit they won't be able to
engage in this kind of activity.
MR. MORRISON:

Is that their argument?

No, that is not the monitoring

argument.
QUESTION:

Well, what is it?

MR. MORRISON:

Let me give you the monitoring

argument, as I understand it.
QUESTION:

That is what I want to know.

QUESTION:

That is the other side.

MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

Monitoring is a practice —

You are being asked, in other words,

to argue your opponent's case now.
MR. MORRISON:

Is that it?

No, I am stating their case.

not going to argue it, I can assure you of that.

I am

I —

[Laucrhter. 3
QUESTION:

You are the one who says that your

interests outweigh the state's.

Now, you can't tell me how

it outweighs the stateb unless you tell me what the state's
are.
MR. MORRISON:

That is right and that is what I

am going to do right now.
QUESTION:

That is right.

MR. MORRISON:

The state claims that monitoring,

which is the keeping of records of what prescription drugs

32
are taken by each patient, will encourage — will permit a
pharmacist to be able to look at a record -- profile — and
tell whether a patient is takincr a drug that may be antagonis­
tic to the one which he is about to fill a prescription on.
Now, they claim that what this statute does is,
it does not tell consumers what prices are being charged at
different drugstores around town or around the county and
therefore, consumers presumably won’t know enough to shop
around and get a better buy and therefore they will, just out
of habit, go back to the stame drugstore they have always
been going to.

That is what I understand the argument is.

Now, the difficulty with that argument is about
three-fold.

The first is that there is not the slightest

evidence any place that this isr anything but an invention
and that the legislature had the foggiest notion that they
were creating a monitoring system.
The statute we have in front of us is the product
of a regulation which was issued in 1967 by the State
Pharmacy Board.

That regulation.said, no advertising the

price of prescription drugs.
The Attorney General in Virginia said, uh uh, you
don’t have authority to issue that regulation.
So, 19S8, the statute was passed.
about monitoring.

Not a word

They didn't pass a monitoring statute.

They passed a no price advertising statute.

33

QUESTION:

Well, did they have a word about any­

thing else in the statute?
MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

Not a word.

Well, then, how do you know what was in

the back of their minds?

How do you know that monitoring

was —
MR. MORRISON:

I am suggesting that there was no

evidence of it and there is subsequent evidence of conduct
which supports that inference and that is, first, that the
Pharmacy Board has never urged upon the state to pass a
regulation, a statute.
They have never attempted to pass a regulation
which would require monitoring.
The state pharmacists’ own code of ethics,which
doesn't require any state authority at all —
QUESTION:

Would you be out of here if, in fact,

what they had in mind and said so was, we think it is best
that people who have to use drugs patronise a single
dispenser so that we can have a record of everything that
the patient buys?
That is what you understand to be monitoring.
MR. J40RRIS0N:

That is right.

If that was in the

legislative history of this statute?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. MORRISON:

No, it wouldn’t — that is the

34
next reason I am going to get to, and that is, that the
statute goes much too far.

It is vastly over-inclusive.

It

does much more than needed to accomplish this end.
After all, we have a doctor who is involved in
this transaction.

We are dealing only with drugs which the

doctor has told the patient, "You better take this drug
because this may save your life.
that you have."
optional.

It may cure an illness

So we are not dealing with something that is

We are dealing with prescription drugs and the

doctor has a professional obligation to be sure that antag­
onistic drugs aren’t taken.
Now, of course, no doctor is perfect as no lawyer
or no pharmacist is perfect and there may be times when they
will miss.
The book will not be accurate or they will not
take the time to check.

That simply means that we have got

malpractice and on the other hand, it does suggest to me that
the pharmacist can provide a useful function but only as a
back-up function.
The primary responsibility is on the doctor and
that is where it ought to continue to be placed

and if the

state elected a number of less-restrictive ways of accomplishing
this monitoring, short of a price control regulation, which
is almost what they have here, then we would have a different
case.

35
We don't.

They have done with this no-advertising

statute that which they ought to have done — if it is worth
doing at all, with the monitoring statute.
Now, the second reason is that the monitoring,
that the statute is vastly ineffective for achieving even
the limited ends that it is supposed to achieve and it is
ineffective for a number of reasons.
First, only a small minority of pharmacists
actually monitor these days.
The second, consumers shop around in any event.
They don11 always

go to the same store for a variety of

reasons.

be closer to one doctor, may be closerto

One may

their home, their office.
drug sales at one

There may be non-prescription

place and they decide, well, as long as I

am in here, I might as well

fill my prescription.

Indeed, the way the advertising rules work, the
pharmacist can advertise nonprescription drags, nondrug items.
They can even advertise that they will give you a free cup of
coffee while you

wait and they can advertise free delivery,

but the one thing that the consumer really wants to know is,
what is it going to cost?

Where in this range of 100 to

600 percent variation are you, Mr. Pharmacist, going to fall?
That information you can't get under this statute.
QUESTION:

Do you agree with Mr. Troy that this

prohibition goes so far as to prevent the pharmacist from

36

putting a sign even on his prescription counter that "I sell
suchandsuch for $1.2G!'?
MR. MORRISON:

I certainly think that it could be
I

interpreted that way and I would say that with respect to
Mr. Justice White's question earlier about whether a
consumer cou?.d go in and circulate, obtain the factual
information from the pharmacist by asking him and go out an
put a consumer's bulletin or guide out.
would
I / say that there are situations in which not
the pharmacist btrt other laws similar to this — those laws
have been construed to say, a doctor who cooperates or a
lawyer who cooperates in that situation, simply giving out
factual information, is engaged in unethical conduct the way
a pharmacist would be here.
QUESTION:

There is nothing to suggest that a labor

union, for example, couldn't go to a pharmacist or to a chain
drugstore and negotiate for lower prescription rates for its
members.
MR. MORRISON:

Absolutely nothing in the statute

that says -QUESTION:
from circulating

And nothing to forbid;the labor union

that among its members.

MR. MORRISON:

Circulating that fact among its

members?
QUESTION:

Umn hum.

37

MR. MORRISONs

Well, I don't know whether the

pharmacists who cooperate in that venture — if he knew that
the information was going to be circulated might be guilty
of this rather broad statute.

It hasn't been pressed that

far, although I suggest that other similar statutes have been
pressed —
QUESTION:
pharmcicisfcs.

Well, this law is directed only against

It is not directed against --

MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION;

That is correct.

-- either labor unions or members of

the Elks or anybody else.
MR. MORRISON:

That is right because that — but

that only goes to the mechanism for enforcing it.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. MORRISON:

And I would suggest that, similar

to the other statutes that I mentioned earlier also involved
only doctors —• only doctors in the one case I am thinking of,
particularly.
Only a doctor could be disciplined but that if the
doctor knowingly cooperates being aware that the result is
going to be this kind of information dissemination, he would
be guilty of —QUESTION:

Well, as a matter of fact —

QUESTION:

Just a moment ago, Mr. Morrison, I

think that this was almost a price control law.

Was that —

38

was there anything implicit in that suggestion that -MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

No, I —

-— a state would violate the Constitu­

tion by enacting a law regulating prices?
MR. MORRISON:

No, and I misspoke and I wanted to

correct that and I was in the middle of another thought.
QUESTION:

Well, I am glad I gave you an oppor­

tunity.
MR. MORRISON:

Thank you very much, sir.

What I wanted to say is, indeed, it is just the
opposite because, as was earlier pointed out, the state
doesn't even have a policy prohibiting price competition.
If, indeed, it had a policy prohibiting price
!

J

competition — if, for instance, all pharmacists had to
charge prices in accordance with what the State Pharmacy
Board determined after appropriate hearing was a reasonable
pries, in the way a utility has to charge, for instance, the
Telephone Company, Electric Company —- and in that situation,
somebody was advertising a price below the price we would
have a case like Pittsburgh Press, aiding and abetting an
illegal activity.
But here we are not aiding and abetting anything
that is illegal.

It is perfectly legal for a pharmacist to

charge any price the pharmacist chooses.
Indeed, it is perfectly legal and the state has

39

no policy against consumers shopping around»

All it has a

policy against, as far as we can determine, is consumers
shopping around in a meaningful way by newspaper advertising
and other forms of media advertising so they can

find out

what the prices are reasonably instead of having to walk
around in a fog.
QUESTION:

Well, the state has a policy, rightly

or wrongly, or rationally or irrationally, against advertising,
price advertising by pharmacists, that is all.
MR. MORRISON:

That is the policy, yes, sir.

That is what the statute says and they claim it is to
enforce the policy having to do with monitoring.
QUESTION:

ttfell, it is that policy, whatever it is.

QUESTION:

Mr. Morrison, let me ask you this and

I hope it isn't irrelevant.
I think it is a fact that drugs by trade names
generally are more expensive than drugs by their basic
chemical —
MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

Generic names.

— or generic name.

Suppose Virginia

had a statute requiring physicians to prescribe in the
generic name.

Would this be unconstitutional, do you think?

MR. MORRISON:

Well, I would first say that I —

my first offhand reaction is that that would not be a First
Amendment issue.

40

My second reaction is that it would not be
constitutional — not be unconstitutional, excuse me,
because I would think that the state would have a legitimate
interest if it made a factual determination that pills are
pharmacologically identical, to be able to say to the doctor,
"You must prescribe that unless there is some medical reason
for doing so."
But I don’t think, whatever the outcome of that
case may be, it would control the facts of this case,
QUESTION:

Would you think that in further

answer to Justice Blackmun8 s question that a physician had
a First Amendment right not to prescribe in the generic
name and you would then balance the state’s interest to see
whether he would prevail or the state?
MR. MORRISON:

Well, 1 don’t see the speech

element of First Amendment coming in.
QUESTION:

Well, call it freedom of expression.

He is writing on a prescription pad rather than speaking.
MR. MORRISON:

Well, I would say that would very

much come under the O’Brien -- United States against O’Brien,
where it is a mixed act of speech and conduct and

it is much

more having to do with the conduct and the content.
I think almost anything that any of us does could
be a speech
QUESTION:

Well, why shoudln’t the doctor be able

41

to prescribe a certain proprietary drug if

he just thinks

it is better or he just wants his customers to use that
drug?
MR, MORRISON:
QUESTION:

Well, my —

I mean, why isn’t

it at least a

First Amendment issue?
MR, MORRISON:
haven't focused on it.

Well, it might be.

As I say, I

It would seem to me that it is not

a traditional kind of expression issue.

He may have a Fifth

or a Fourteenth Amendment right to engage in his occupation
in accordance with what he determines to be the best dictates
of his profession and training and I would certainly want
to think about it and I would want to see what the justifi­
cations were.
My own belief is that such a statute would be
constitutional because of the state's interest in ensuring
that people who are in need of medical assistance are
permitted to

are able to buy at the least possible price

sphere the is no medical difference.
Now, if there were medical differences, of course,
we would be at a different kind of inquiry.
QUESTION:

Mr. Morrison, has there ever been any

advertising in Virginia of prescription drugs?
MR. MORRISON:

Oh, yes, since we won this case

almost a year and a half ago there has been advertising

42

going on.
QUESTION:

And that is what —

MR, MORRISON:
QUESTION;

Thera has been no stay.

The point I am driving at is,

how

come the pharmacists are not involved?
MR. MORRISON:
Honor.

The pharm — I’m sorry, your

Why arerft they plaintiffs?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. MORRISON:

Well, the pharmacists had a try at

this in 1969 in Patterson against Kingery.

They didn’t win

that case.
QUESTION:

I see.

HR. MORRISON:

I see.

These are consumers and we thought

that we could do a little better.
QUESTION:

So feir you have.

MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Mr. Morrison, before you go on, in

responding to a question about lawyers and whether or not the
principles you advocate here today also would be applicable
to lawyers, you stated, as I understood you, that it would
depend on the facts.
1811 try to put a. fairly straightforward factual
situation.
As you know, most lawyers have an hourly rate, at
least for internal record purposes and the first step in most

43
legal charge computations is to look at one's record and see
how many hours have been devoted to the representation.
Let's assume a desire on the part of lawyers or
assume that the issue were whether or not lawyers would be
allowed to advertise that their hourly rate for non-litigatior.
advice was $25 an hour or whatever it might be.

What would

your reaction to that be?
MR„ MORRISON:

Well;, ray first reaction would be

that that is certainly an item of information that consumers
would want to know.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. MORRISON:

That the lawyer would want to be

able to disseminate that, either because he wants to be sure
the people he is attracting can pay the fees or because he
thinks that he will get people to come in at that rate
because he thinks it is a good, competitive rate»
Nov;, on the assumption that we are talking about
a dignified notice or simply a statement someplace in a legal
register of some kind that says $25 an hour is what this
lawyer charges, I would see no interest of the state of the
kind that I would think would be sufficient to overturn it
but as I said before, I think that before we prejudge a case
like that, the state ought to be able to have an opportunity
to present whatever justification, the equivalent of
monitoring or whatever else the state has to put forth and we

can make a determination at that time.

My own judgment would

be, since I think that is what you have asked, is that there
is no sufficient interest of the state involved but, again, I
would say that I would want, finally, to wait until we saw
exactly what the facts were before we —
QUESTION:

Well, even if there were, according to

your submission, as I understand it, the First Amendment of
the Constitution would override it.
MR. MORRISON:

Well, the First Amendment —

If there

part of potential clients or potential customers of

MR. MORRISON:

Well, in every case, of course,

there would be a strong presumption that the right to know
would be —
QUESTION:

Well, if he has a right to know.

MR. MORRISON:

Yes.

But there could — there is

always engaged in the permissible balancing test that there
are certain kinds of cases —
QUESTION:

Well, some people think so, but others

don' t.
MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

That is right,

Others think if there is a clear

constitutional right, that is the end of it and any state

45
statute

that impedes or interferes with t*hat right is

invalid.
MR, MORRISONS
Mr, Justice

I think that is correct,,

Stewart,
QUESTION:

That is not your submission, as I

understand it,
.MR, MORRISON:
QUESTION:

No, it ~

Your submission is that in this instance,

the state interest does not override the right to know.
Isn’t that it?
QUESTION:

That is one way of looking at it, but

that is not the way that some constitutional lawyers do.
MR. MORRISON:

I think that is right.'

I don’t

believe that the absolutist view of the First Amendment
commands a majority of the justices of this Court at this
time and I have said that, of course, under an absolutist
view we would be entitled to win but even without that, even
under the traditional view that if the state could show the
compelling state interest and it was the least restrictive
*

way they could prevent this dissemination, then that case
might be cited against the dissemination of the information.
But we have to look at the facts.
The analysis would be the same.
QUESTION:

First of all, on a absolutist view or

any other view, you have to look at the Constitution, don’t

46
you?
MR, MORRISON;
QUESTION;

That is correct,

And where do you

find in the

Constitution any right to know?
MR. MORRISON;
QUESTION:

Well, it is the correlative

Particularly if you were an absolutist?

MR. MORRISON:
of the right to speak.

It is the correlative, I would say,
Freedom of speech that I think

Justice Brennan said that the marketplace would be a barren
place indeed if we had only sellers and no buyers and we
have recognized the right to receive information specifically
in a number of contexts, Hamont —
QUESTION:

I don’t think anyone joined in saying

that, though, did they?
MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

You were concurring.

That is Lament, isn't it?

MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

Wasn't I alone?

Yes.

One may fully accept that and still

say that the Constitution protected the right to know by
guaranteeing the right to speak or the right to a fair press,
to a free press and that those were the constitutional
guarantees and anything elses is derivative and is not
protected directly by the Constitution.
MR. MORRISON:

Well, we would certainly say that

to the extent that there is a direct right to speak, that

47
would plainly support the right to receive the information
but there have been a couple of cases in which the question
about the right to speak has not been at issue, Kleinclienst
against Mandel, for instance.

No one claimed that Professor

Mandel had a constitutional right under our Constitution, as
someone from Belgium, to speak; nor did anyone say that the
Hanoi government in Lamont had a right to speak, yet we
upheld the constitutional rights in those cases,
QUESTION:

Well, you are not suggesting, are you,

that the consumers have a right to know even though the
pharmacists don't have a right to speak?
MR, MORRISON:

Well, I think the pharmacists do

have a right to speak in this case.
QUESTION:

But they are not here.

MR. MORRISON:

But they are not here and I do say

that there have been cases in this Court and I simply make
the observation, I think that the rights are equal and the
same and that when you view the entire transaction together
considering all of the rights involved, that you do have a
constitutional right to have this information disseminated
and received in this case.
i

What I am saying is that there have been a couple
of cases where the right to receive has seemingly been
elevated above the right that the person who was making the
statement had under our Constitution.

QUESTION;

Mr. Morrison, maybe this is why I, for

one, anyway, am always a little uneasy about using a phrase
such as the right to know.
I think I had rather plump for something like the
free flow of information.

It puts a little less emphasis on

right to know on one party and the right to speak on the
other and we have restricted them here a little bit.

I am

groping, obviously.
MR. MORRISON:

I agree with you, one hundred

percent, Mr. Justice BXackmun.

I don't think, and I read my

brief again with that specific in mind, that we specifically
adopted the right to know phraseology in this Court, largely
relying upon your Honors' opinion.
In Bigelow, where that phrase was not involved,
and I agree that the free flow of information is what the
First Amendment is really all about, and we are suggesting
here that the consumers have a very important part to be
heard in explaining why this information should be disseminated.
QUESTION:

Eufc you don't suggest that the First

Amendment, the right to free speech, means that you must have
something to say, do you?
MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

Then, if you —

MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

No, I don't.

Yes.

Something meaningful to say?
Then, if you are going to measure

49
it by the free flow of information, information presumably
meaning something to say, you have put a limit on the First
Amendment, haven81 you?
MR, MORRISONS

Well, I donefc think so.

I am

only talking about •—
QUESTIONS

A person has the same right to speak

or to write even if what he is speaking or writing is
utterly foolish, doesn"t he?
MR, MORRISON:

That is absolutely correct-

I am

only talking about those cases in which a state is claiming
that some interest in prohibiting certain kinds of infor­
mation

may be raised and in. those cases I think that it is

proper, as this Court did in Bigelow last year, to take a
look at the kind of information that we are talking about.
That was my only point.
QUESTION:

Well, if we are speaking of information.

MR. MORRISON:

Yes, yes.

Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you hcive anything

further, Mr. Troy?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY F. TROY, ESQ.
MR. TROY:

Yes, your Honor.

First, as to Bigelow, let me quote from their
brief that they filed, pages 28 and 29, describing the
advertisement in question.

50

"The advertisement contained much more than a
proposal for a commercial transaction.

The information that

New York had legalised abortion was important, not just to
persons dealing with pregnancy but to citizens in Virginia
generally.

Knowledge that other states had altered their

laws on such a controversial subject as abortion is likely
to have a tangible impact on the attitude of persons con“
cerning restrictive law3 in their own state."
Now, that was the argument that was made in
Bigelow and it is, I suggest, the argument that was adopted
by this Court when it found that the advertisement did contain
certain information.
QUESTION:

Now -Well, you concede this a3 a First

Amendment case, don't you?
MR. TROY:

In the context that we have brought it

to this Court it has come by an independent right to knowgranted under the First Amendment and therefore i3 a First
Amendment case.
QUESTION:

Well, by that you mean, that it was

on the basis of the First Amendment that this case was
