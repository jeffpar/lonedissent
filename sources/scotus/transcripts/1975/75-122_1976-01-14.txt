P R 0 C E E D I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Lawrence Cantor against the Detroit Edison Company.
Mr. Weinstein, you may proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BURTIN I. WEINSTEIN ON
BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. WEINSTEINS
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

This case is here on a writ of certiorari granted

by tills Court on October 6, 1975, from the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

This is a private treble

damage action seeking an injunction by Lawrence Cantor.

Mr.

Cantor is a retail druggist in the Detroit area who sells
lightbulbs or lamps — the two terms can he used interchangeably, both in the briefs and arguments here

in

competition with Detro.it Edison.
QUESTION:

Whan we read and hear about lamps, we are

talking actually about light bulbs.
MR. WEINSTEIN:

That's correct.

The technical

term for light bulbs is lamps, and they have been used
interchangeably.
\

QUESTION:

Lamp has another meaning, you know.

t

MR. WEINSTEIN:

It is not a floor lamp, your Honor,

no „
Edison is an investor-owned private electric
utility.

It serves a large area of southeastern Michigan and

4
it secures its monopoly as an electric utility via a franchise
granted to it by th® municipality in which it serves.
The gist of this action is that Edison via its
monopoly power has unlawfully extended this monopoly by means
of an illegal tie-in.

That is to say# every residential

customer of Detroit Edison must whan he purchases electrical
energy pay a price# included in the charge for electrical
service# to Detroit Edison for lamps or light bulbs.

It

doesn*t make it different —
QUESTION:

He doesn't have the choice of not accepting

that additional service.
MR. WEINSTEIN:
QUESTION:

H© does not hav© that choice at all.

He has to take it.

MR. WEINSTEIN:

Th© fact that makes it a tie-in# in

fact# that is different than commercial customers who do not
have that program at all.
Edison is unique# as a matter of fact# Mr. Justice
BXackmun# in the country.

They are the only electric utility

company that continues to have this program in its present
format.

Edison’s program
QUESTIONs ...

for a great many years# hasn’t it

in most utilities?
MR. WEINSTEIN:

Yes, your Honor.

In fact# Thomas

Edison in 1886 helped devise the program before regulation
even began.

5
QUESTIONS

It has not been used in recent years very

widely, has it?
MR, WEINSTEIN:

No, your Honor,

In fact, in

of many regulatory agencies, many courts, including the Suprema
Court of the State of Illinois in the Consumers8 Stores case
said this was a monopolistic practice, it was unreasonable.
Wisconsin did this.

And this is on© of the major contentions

that Detroit Edison is the only one doing this now after
everyone else has decided it is either unreasonable or monopolis­
tic and the people don’t take advantage of the program and
they subsidize others.
What really happens here, you have to know physically
the facts.

The custom©!' of Edison walks in with some burned

out lamps in a shopping bag.

He goes over to one of the

distribution centers where these bulbs are given to them.
There is a list of bulbs, approved bulbs, and I would like to
put quotes around the word "approved" because the only approval
that exists her© for this list of bulbs is Detroit Edison’s
list of bulbs which they have, changed from time to time.
He walks in with these bulbs and picks up a few bulbs
that he needs and hands in the burned out lamps.
QUESTION:

I gather the manufacturer is not Detroit

Edison, of the bulbs,
MR. WEINSTEIN:

No, your Honor.

Edison makes a point

of the fact that they are able to purchase great quantities of

6

bulbs because -they can (a) deal direct with fcha manufacturers
with large quantity discounts.

And there is a vice in th©r®,

your Honor, because within the various service centers, they
sell regular light bulbs, and if you look at page 276 of the
Appendix, this is a point of purchase retail advertisement,
and it shows

this is probably stuck in a bin in their stores

and it says, '’These lamps available for free exchange.”
QUESTION:

What page?

MR. WEINSTEIN:
QUESTION:

I’m sorry.

275.

Excuse me.

275a.

MR. WEINSTEIN:

Yes, your Honor.

available for free exchange.”

"These lamps

Than it lists and entire new

list of bulbs that are not part of the program,

Edison sells

fch©3«s bulbs at a regular price, and you can assume that if
they are able to get such a great, deal from the manufacturer
because they buy in such large quantities these bulbs, that
the bulbs that are sold at the regular price, they make a
much greater profit on than any other bulb seller than Detroit
Edison.
The program is carried on in 35 distribution centers
in the service area.

There are 50 agents selected by Edison

at their own whim and caprice throughout the service area who
also are able to give these bulbs away, and they call it a free
light bulb program.

The fact of the matter is it is not free.

The fact of the matter is it is not an exchange.

7
The program is highly promoted in Detroit»
Edison is the best-loved utility in the country»
got this great free program»

Detroit

They have

And if the customers knew what

the program was really about, X would begin to wonder myself
whether they would still love Detroit Edison.
Edison itself justifies this program by keeping the
sockets filled»

They want the lamps, th© lights, to be used.

This also brings them increased revenue th© more th© lights
are used.

If your light burns out, you don't bother about

getting until you get over to the store to buy some, but if
you have got a whole supply of bulbs in your house, you just
screw another bulb into place, it doesn't cost you anything,
supposedly, and you have got more electricity, mar© light.
QUESTION:

If the utility could show that it is

passing on to the customer the benefit or a substantial part
of the benefit of its bulk sales purchase advantage, they
might deserve to ba well loved, wouldn't you think?
MR. WEINSTEINs

Not necessarily, your Honor, because,

especially when you take into consideration that these are
longer light bulbs.

Now that's a great PR term, "longer light

bulbs."
QUESTION;

This I want to know about.

Do these

bulbs last longer than th® ones you and I might buy from Mr.
Cantor?
MR. WEINSTEIN:

Yes, they do last longer, but they

8

I

are more inefficient.

Edison in its brief, I believe it is

on page 7, admits that these bulbs are 8 percent less efficient
because they are longer life and the last part of their life
they keep on giving you less electricity.
an insidious device.

And this is really

If you want to read a book and you need

a 60-watt bulb to read that book and the last hundred hours
of the longer light bulb, you. might need two of those bulbs.
So you have got more elcactricity going.

You are burning up

more electricity and you are increasing Detroit Edison's
revenues.
QUESTIONS

Is there any other issue in this case

besides the Parker v. Brown issue?
MR. WEINSTEIN;

I don't believe there is any other

issue in this case whatsoever.
The customer satisfaction issue has been raised here
for the first time.

I don't believe it is an issue, because

in the trial court a stipulation was entered into.

After

Edison filed an answer and there was a lot of discovery, it was
stipulated that the only issue for summary judgment would be
whether or not this program received justification to be
shielded or exempt from our antitrust laws because of the
doctrine of Parker v. Brown.

And w© submit that the Michigan

Public Service Commission, MPSC, which is the regulatory agency
in Michigan, neither had the authority to approve this program
within the doctrine espoused by Parker v. Brown and also if the

9

authority hare is granted just for the sake of this argument,
we don’t believe Edison’s program was regulated in the manner
in which to grant them an exemption from our antitrust laws,
which this Court has said is the magna carta of economic
freedom in this country„
I would like to go into this Michigan analysis of
what Michigan has done with the authority question, because
that is the best way to analyze whether or not there is
authority here»
Remember I said that the way to determine — we
feel there are two questions»

Did th® Michigan Public Service

Commission have the authority to regulate?

And assuming for

the sake of argument they did have the authority, did they
regulate?
QUESTION:

You mean did they have the authority to

regulate under Michigan State law?
MR. WEINSTEIN:

That’s correct, your Honor,

You see,

the Michigan Public Service Commission is stringently limited
in its authority here.
QUESTION:

But presumably the Michigan Public

Service Company has decided it had that authority.

Judge
|

Feikens, who was a Michigan lawyer sitting on the bench in
Detroit, ruled against you;,,
a lot of Michigan cases

the Sixth Circuit which handles

likewise ruled against you.

You

wouldn’t ask this Court to superimpose its judgment of Michigan

10

law against them, would you?
MR. WEINSTEINj

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, on the

contrary, the Michigan Public Service Coramission in a case we
have submitted in a typewritten brief due to the delay here,
in 1937.

It's McCraev.

Detroit Gas, I believe, and it's

cited in our typewritten brief, but th© cite to it is
24 P.U.R. 225.

In that case the prosecuting attorney for

Wayne County in 1937 asked the Michigan regulatory agency
there, a successor to the regulatory agency that exists today,
they asked them to investigate monopolistic practices and
schemes engaged in by Detroit Edison.

And the Michigan Public

Service Commission, or at that time it was called the Michigan
Public Utilities Commission, stated, and I am quoting from
the order of the MPSC -there, that it is without jurisdiction
to investigate the acts, practices, devices, and schemes under
which the present rates were established in order to consider
and report how such evils may be remedied.
QUESTION?

Well, maybe I misunderstood you.

Your

point, then, isn’t that the Michigan Public Service Commission
didn’t have the authority to approve Detroit Edison’s plan, but
that it had no authority to investigate the monopolistic
implications of it?
MR. WEINSTEIN:
QUESTION:

That’s also true.

It’s unlike —

You say that’s also true.

But it is it

part of your contention that ‘the Michigan Public Service

11
Commission had no authority to approve Detroit Edison8s light
bulb plan?
MR. WEINSTEIN;

That's exactly right* sir.

Another case that describes this* your Honor, is
the Huron Portland Cement case, and in that particular case
Huron Portland Cement asked the Michigan Public Service
Commission to force a utility to render service to them.

And

as justification for that, they cited -- and I think it’s
important to look at the statute;
page 5, it is section 460.6.

it is in our appendix at

And in 460.6 it appears to be —

and I say appears to b® ~ a grant of complete power.

But

then in the Huron Portland Cement case, which is a Michigan
Supreme Court casa, the Michigan Supreme Court said that this
is just a mere grant of jurisdiction over utilities.

In order

to determine what the Michigan Public Service Commission can
do, what authority it has, you must look to the other statutes.
And the statute that they refer you to for electric utilities
in the Huron Portland Cement case is called the Transmission
of Electricity Act.
at page 9.
appendix.

It is also part of our appendix, and it's

Those two sections are at the bottom of the
They are 460 ~ now I say 460, I mean the chapter

in which they talk about utilities generally — 552.
QUESTION;

Could you summarize at all the contention

you are trying to make here?
MR. WEINSTEIN;

Sure.

The contention I am trying to

12
make is that the Michigan Public Service Commission talks about
just the meat and potatoes of ratas, the cost to the consumer.
They have a twofold duty.
rate is reasonable.

They have a duty to see that the

They have another duty to see that the

investor in the company gets a fair rate of return.
nothing further to do.

They have

They talk about conditions of services,

and those services refer basically to the transmission of
this electric service.

In fact, Detroit Edison knows very

well what it means by service.

It describes the terra "service"

in its rate book, which was attached to defendant's response,
in thair motion for summary judgment.

And in four different

places they talk about character of service.

And each time

they talk about it, they talk about it as alternating current
service, primary high voltage service.
So they are only talking when they discuss service
here the. question of whether or not the" rate was fair.

And

that's the cost of electrical service.
Remember

you know, ifc"s difficult for me to be

able to express because the lamp or the light seems to be an
integral part of this thing that we call light up here.

But

it really is another commodity, it’s a product like a
refrigerator.

If Edison tied in the sale of refrigerators,

it would be a more obvious situation.

But we don't have that;

we have a little innocuous thing called a lamp or light bulb.
This light bulb, being a product, is beyond the

13

jurisdiction of the Michigan Public Service Commission to
regulate that.
The Constitution in Michigan -- I understand this
goes back to years ago when the farmers in the upper peninsula
were complaining about the setting of rates down in Lansing
and they wanted to retain jurisdiction over the rate-making
process.

And the Constitution says that the municipalities

will reserve to themselves jurisdiction over the streets and
alleys and that the Michigan Public Service Commission does
not grant the monopoly.
QUESTION:

So you say then that the Commission

wasn’t authorised to approve Detroit Edison’s plan.
MR. WEINSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Absolutely not.

Then it seems to m® you have got these

resil hurdles to overcome.

And if you have a. district judge

who is a Michigan lawyer in the Sixth Circuit as well as the
Public Service Commission saying they did have that power s
you are asking us to superimpose our judgment of Michigan law
on them.
MR. WEINSTEIN:
follow Michigan law.

No, your Honor, I am asking you to

We feel very strongly that the Michigan

Public Service Commission didn’t do anything in this program
because they didn’t have a job to do.

They knew their job.

This is no attack on the regulatory agency here at all.
The Michigan Public Service Commission knew they couldn’t

14
regulate light bulbs.

They didn't do so.

And that's the

second point of my argument, that there is no evidence
whatsoever in the record indicating any regulation by the
Michigan Public Service Commission to bring it within the
ambit of a shield from the antitrust laws.

If you examine

the record, and it is extensive here, there are many, many
things that they did not regulate.
Now, I admit to this Court that I am sort of backdooring the situation.

I have a difficult case before me, I

admit that, because I cannot prove the lack of existence of
something.

I can only show you what -QUESTION;

Mr. Weinstein, I gather you are arguing

that even if you are wrong ~
MR. WEINSTEINs
QUESTION;

I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.

You are arguing that even if you are

wrong and we have to accept what the Michigan judges have
!

said is Michigan law, namely, that the Commission did have
authority to approve this practice, you are nevertheless
arguing that this doesn't constitute a State command, aren't
you?
MR. WEINSTEIN;
QUESTION;

That's correct.

Why don't you get to that?

MR. WEINSTEIN;

All right.

The Parker v. Brown

case —
QUESTION; It's the relevant issue here.

You may as

15
well argue it.
MR. WEINSTEIN;

All right.

I believe that without

authority to regulate th© program* without an interest in
the State* there is no statute in Michigan mentioning lamp
sales.
QUESTION;

Why don't you accept the premise for the

purpose of argument that the Commission could approve this
practice?
MR. WEINSTEIN;

Very well* your Honor.

For the sake

of this argument* I will concede that point that they did have
authority -QUESTION;

You don't have to concede it.

MR. WEINSTEIN;

OK.assume it arguendo.

There is

nothing in the evidence to show that they did regulate this
program.

And the only way I can show you how they did not

regulate this program is to show you what, they have not
regulated and what Detroit Edison has not chosen to reveal
to the Michigan Public Service Commission.
Remember* this is a motion for summary judgment*
and the facts should be looked at in the best light to the
person opposing that motion for summary judgment.

And the

most revealing fact again is that there is no evidence.
If there was evidence of considered judgment and the kind of
regulation that would exempt an antitrust activity* Detroit
Edison would be the first ones 'to bring it to this Court's

16

attention,
QUESTION;

Let5s assume for the moment again for the

sake of argument that the Public Service Commission did
approve, had the power to approve and did approve exactly
what the company did»

Now, does that mean that it’s exempt

from the antitrust laws?
MR. WEINSTEIN;

I don't believe so, your Honor,

because there has been no State institution —•
QUESTION;

But I thought you have argued in your

brief that it didn't mak© any difference whether it had the
power to approve or not.
MR.WEINSTEIN;
QUESTION;
not.

It doesn't make any difference.

Or whether they actually approved it or

They didn't order the company to do this.
MR. WEINSTEIN;
QUESTION;

That’s correct, your Honor.

The State statute didn't order them to do

it.
MR. WEINSTEIN;
QUESTION;

Exactly right.

Why don't you argue that?

MR. WEINSTEIN;

I have been trying *— I thought I

was (inaudible).
QUESTION;

Before you leave that, before you gat to

that point, may I ask this questions

Assume that the

legislature of Mississippi had adopted a statute directing
electric utilities in the State to include this, service as a

17
part of that servies to the public, what would your response
to that sort of legislation be?
MR. WEINSTEIN:

If there were that type of legisla­

tion by the State legislature evidencing a statewide interest
in the. sale of light bulbs akin to the statewide interest in
agricultural commodities under Parker v„ Brown, then I would
say to you that would be State action.
QUESTION:

Suppose the legislature went a bit further

and directed the utilities to provide electric refrigerators,
electric stoves, electric dishwashers and other designated
appliances, would that trouble you any?
MR. WEINSTEIN:

That would trouble me because it

would be more difficult to foist those types of commodities
on the consumer.

Remember, the consumer has no choice hare.

He has got to take those light bulbs.

A light bulb is a

commodity like salt, we all need it.
QUESTION:

But if this case depends on whether or not

the State has directed something, why do you draw a distinc­
tion between lamps and refrigerators?
MR. WEINSTEINs

I don't believe I understand the

question.
QUESTION:

If the issue in this case is whether under

Parker this case before us today must turn on whether or not
the Stata has directed tha utility to do this, if that is the
issue, what difference would j_t make whether the State

18

directed that the utility provides lamp bulbs or electric
*

refrigerators?
MR. WEINSTEIN;

I believe that there are a number of

cases that this Court has addressed itself to a position,
both in the Continental Ore case where there is an assertion
made by Union Carbide that their subsidiary v/as directed to
preclude Continental from the* vanadium market, and this Court
said that that was not State action because certainly th©
Canadian Government didn't approve this thing.
Also, in the Schwegmann

case there was a situation

where in the fair price area, fair traded prices, there was
a Louisiana statute that was enacted saying that non-signers
shall be bound.

And this Court by Justice Douglas said that

flies in the face of th© antitrust laws.
And I believe that lamps fly in the face of th©
antitrust laws.

I believe, refrigerators most certainly fly

in the face of the antitrust laws as well.
is so venal.

Th© tie-in contract

The program itself is so venal in that its only

purpose is to increase the revenues *—
QUESTION;

Wouldn’t a State law requiring all

companies to charge th© same prices for milk be an exception
to the antitrust laws?
MR. WEINSTEIN;

In th© early thirties, the Nebbia

case in New York there was that situation.

Rut in that

situation there was venous competition in milk.

19

QUESTION;

I know, but it nevertheless is a State

policy to have uniform prices in a certain industry.

Do you

think the companies following that State law are subject to
the antitrust laws?
MR. WEINSTEIN;

I believe that in my case, sine©

Detroit Edison is the only private utility that does this
program,-

there is no State interest.
QUESTION;

I am positing a situation where the State

has ordered the companies to charge the same prices.

Here

you say the State has never ordered Edison to do this.
MR. WEINSTEIN;
bit better now.

I understand the question a little

You ar© talking about prices.

Now, if the

State is interested in the rat© -- w© have no quarrel here
with the rate that Detroit Edison charges»

We only have a

quarrel with the method by which they tie the Imaps into the
sale of electricity.
The program has not been regulated.
advertised this program as free.

They have

They have never submitted

anything to the Michigan Public Service Commission seeking
approval.
In 1954 Detroit Edison on its own,again without
going back to the regulatory agency, stopped home delivery.
There has been no regulation of th© other bulbs that they sell
when I addressed myself to page 275 of the appendix.

There

is nothing here to indicata that the Michigan Public Service

20

Commission investigated the competitive effect — the anti­
competitive effect of this program.
There
in the

is a survey made by an independent company

Appendix at page 290, and that tells you what the

program is really all about, on page 292,, and what they have
really tried to do here.

It say? "We believe that the free" —

and they do not understand the program themselves — "lamp
renewal policy helps raise the wattage on lamps used, thus
giving better lighting service to the public and resulting in
lighting revenues to The Detroit Edison Company considerably
above average."
Now, this program has a lot of aspects to it, the
longer life aspect to it of the bulbs, also means that revenues
of Detroit Edison go up.
Another aspect of th© program — and all of these
facets which are more fully set out in the facts in our brief •
have never been subjected to th® regulation of th© Michigan
Public Service Commission.

It's similar to, if this were

a gas company involved her®, that th© gas utility company
says, "You have got to run all your furnaces at 75°, forget
about energy conservation, forget about those things, in
order to get our gas, you have got to run at 75®.™
same -thing as using these longer light bulbs.

That's the

They want to

beep th© sockets full.
QUESTION:

If you plan on reserving five minutes for

21

rebuttal, the Solicitor General's time is approaching.
MR. WEINSTEIN:

Thank you, your Honor.

I would like

to reserva that time.
I just wanted to conclude by saying that there were
two questions I thought I would address myself to in the
beginning, and those questions are:

Does the Michigan Public

Service Commission have authority to regulate?

And the

answer to that question we believe heartily is no.
it did tuive authority, it did not do so.

Even if

And without authority,

there was no compulsion by the State, there was no acting by
the Stat€).

This entire program was begun, created, initiated

by Detroit Edison.

They have done this by themselves and

they should have to suffer for the risks involved in doing
this.

They certainly didn't have their heads in the sand in

the 1930's when other companies knew that this program was
unreasonable and monopolistic.
Thank you.
I have one request, your Honor.

Due to the fact

that we have received the two briefs from the amicus around
January 5, we would like to have leave of the Court to file
a response to fch@ amicus briefs.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
soon can you do it?

You may within -- how

A week?

MR. WEINSTEIN:

A week I think would be fine.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You are ahead of me.

I

22
haven't received them yet*
MR. WEINSTEIN!

January 5th?
Yes, sir.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Solicitor General.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK AS AMICUS
CURIAE ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. BORK:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

The United States is here as amicus curiae in support

of the petitioner because any rule announced in this case will
heavily affect the Government's enforcement policy.

This is

a relatively new field of antitrust enforcement and it's

that

way because there has been a modern proliferation of regulatory
agencies, licensing agencies, and so forth at State and local
K

levels which offer ever-increasing opportunities for quite
sophisticated businesses to get anticompetitive policies
immunized in some way by regulation, or appear to be
immunized in som® way by regulation.

And we think it's quit©

important to the Federal antitrust policy -that any immunity
that is granted be on© that arises because there is a
deliberat© and affirmative regulatory policy of the State to
command th© activity which is questioned.
We think here that if th© position or th© doctrine
espoused by Detroit Edison becomes th® law, then th© immunity
of Parker v. Brown will he expanded and will in fact shield
anticompetitive conduct that no State particularly wants and
certainly that no State requires.

23

Now, I should make it clear that I express no
opinion on the legality of the underlying conduct here. I
don’t know whether this is an illegal tie-in or not.
think tiie record permits us to tell.

I don’t

There is much play on

both sides by the petitioner and by the respondent about whether
or not this program is good for consumers.

I frankly don't

know, and I don’t think the question is before this Court at
this time, so I intend not to address that.
Furthermore, I think the Noerr case which appears
in the briefs frequently is not involved here.

At least it

is the Government’s position that any company may petition
the State for any rule it wants.

We have no objection in any

way to any request made by a company of a State.
QUESTION:

Or companies can get together to do so

under the Noerr case3
MR. BORK:

That is true.

And we have no objection

to anything that Detroit Edison may have asked the State to do
or not to do.

That’s certainly entirely up to them.

The question here is simply whether a Federal court
may even examine respondent's practice in the light cast by
the antitrust laws, and we think the answer to that is yes.
We think the immunity doctrine which derives from Parker v.
Brown simply does not cover the situation.
immunity depends upon two questions:

The status of

One, petitioner's counsel

has just discussed in part, which is the question of whether

24

indeed there is a State agency acting with authority to act,
the ultra vires question so to speak»

I shall not discuss

that.
I should like to discuss the question of whether the
conduct here was compelled by any affirmative policy of the
State.
tell

I think not.
on

The record here shows that so far as we can

a. motion for summary judgment the State of Michigan

did not compel or direct Detroit Edison to charge for light
bulbs in its rates for electricity.

By that I mean this:

There is no State statute requiring the practice or mentioning
the practice.

There exists no order or regulation of the Michigan

Public Service Commission that mentions the practice.
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, do you take the

position that the defendant could abandon the policy without
the approval of the State?
MR. BORK:

I think it’s quite clear that they could,

Mr. Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

Could or could not?

MR. ?30RK:

Could abandon, in one of two ways.

QUESTION:

VJould they have to adjust their rates?

MR. BORK:

They may have to do that, but I think

they would have to

go

back with a new tariff.

They might

have to go back with a new tariff with a lower rate because of
decreased costs.

I am not even sure of that because it is

typical in regulations that costs may decrease for some reason.

25
and the company does not immediately go in and adjust its
rates.

There is a regulatory lag there.
QUESTION:

Surely there would be jurisdiction on the

part of the State Commission to —
MR. BORK:
would be.

To require lower rates.

I think there

And here I am told, indeed, that at one time this

company had home delivery and a man actually came to your house
and installed the light bulbs.

When they dropped home

delivery for a much less expensive form of dispensation of
these bulbs, no mention of that fact was made to the Michigan
Public Service Company, no tariff change was instituted.
I think they could drop it.

So

At a minimum, I think they could

certainly go back and say, "We have dropped it and we offer
you a new tariff without that cost element."

I think there is

no question
QUESTION:

In accord with ordinary public utility

regulation practice they presumably in due course have to make
a nev; filing, wouldn’t they, at least?
MR. BORK:

Well, if they wanted to change a rate.

QUESTION:

If they no longer offered free light

bulbs, I would suppose they would have to make a new filing,
but I really don't what that has to do with this case.
MR. BORK:

I don't either.

But. I think it’s

important here that, the Michigan Public Service Commission
which regulates across the State has never taken explicit

26
notice of this practice, have never even inquired into it.
This is a motion for summary judgment in which Detroit Edison
purports to be compelled, and I think it's up to them to show
an affirmative policy across the State, and so far as we can
tell from this record, Detroit Edison has not shown that
otner public utilities are required to —
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, neither court

below decided that Parker v„ Brown applied here because there
was an affirmative policy, did it?

Didn't, it just say that

the approval of —

We

MR. BORK:

Of the tariff.

QUESTION:

Approval of the tariff was enough.

MR. BORK:

That's right, but —

QUESTION:

Let's assume we decided that was wrong.

wouldn't go on and,say,examine Michigan law and then

decide there wasn't any affirmative policy, would we?
MR. BORK:

No, no.

No, no.

But I'm saying that

insofar as someone wishes to say that I am compelled or
required or directed by State law as it was possible to say in
Parker v. Brown.

One would look at least, to some compulsion

somewhere in the law.
QUESTION:

But that wasn't the standard the 6our€ of

Appeals used or the district court either.
MR. BORK:
that —

No.

I take it they were using something

27
QUESTION:

Then you are saying that approval of the

tariff was enough.
MR. BORK:

Yes, that8s true, Mr. Justice White.

I

think it is not,for this reason
QUESTION:

In your view the courts below have said

that the State law requires, so there is an affirmative policy.
MR. BORK:

That's my point I wish to make about that.

And that is that apparently this Commission will approve
tariffs without light bulb programs included.

As far as we

know? it has never disapproved a tariff because a light bulb
program was not included.

And it seems to me it follows from

that that this practice is not. in any v/ay arequired by any
agency of the State.

The State's .policy insofar as it can be

said to have a policy is entirely permissive.

The initiative

about whether or not there is a bulb program included in the
tariff is left to the utility's initiative, and indeed the
utility has the power to decide that question.
QUESTION:

Well, in Parker v. Brown the initiative

came from the growers, too.
MR. BORK:

Well, in Parker v' Browh, Mr.. Justice

Rehnquist, the State had enacted an elaborate policy
particularly with respect to the prorate programs.

'hcd

QUESTION;

But they had to be initiated by the growers.

MR. BORK:

They had triggered by some producers who

however, once they triggered it by going into the

State law,, that State lav/ became compulsory as to all growers
and so forth who did not want the program.
compelled by State law.

So they were

Indeed, there were criminal penalties

involved.
What I am saying here is that so far as this record
shows the Michigan Public Service Commission says, in effect,
"You tell us which way you would rather go — light bulb program
or no light bulb program and we will compel
you wish to go."

That is not a State affirmative policy.

In

They just

That’s why this case reminds one, I think, of
Schwegmann rather than Parker v. Brown.

At most hare you have

I don’t think it’s a. policy, I think it's

an inadvertence -™ at most here you have a State policy which
is,

if you elect to have a light bulb program, all right.

That is what the State said about the Fair Trade Act and that
was not sufficient State action in Schwegmann to stand up
against Sherman Act attack.
QUESTION;

Do you know the citation of Schwegmann?

I don’t see it in your brief.
MR. BORK:

It’s in petitioner’s brief.

It's 341 U.S.

QUESTION;

Thank you very much.

MR. BORK;

In fact, I think there is actually less

334 o

29
State action here than there was in Schwegmann because at
least there the State had an explicit affirmative policy of
letting the private party elect whether or not to use Fair Trade.
Here so far as we can tell, we have nothing more than State
inadvertence or indifference or oversight.

There is no

explicit policy about letting them
Now, I would refer to the Goldfarb case, 421 U.S. at
page 790 where this Court explains why the supreme courts ~
the Supreme Court of Virginia; in that case, at least mentioned
advisory fee schedules, but that was all, and that was held
not to be State action which would immunise the agreed-upon
fees in that case.

Here there is no mention of this program in

any State law.
QUESTION;

Mr. Solicitor General, has the Department

of Justice ever argued Federal preemption in this area?
MR. BORK;

Federal preemption, we may have argued in

some cases, Mr. Justice Blackmun, but we are not claiming
Federal preemption here.
QUESTION:

I know you are not.

I wondered why in a

MR. BORK;

Because I think we do feel that Parker v.

way.

Brown is rightly decided.

We do feel the Sherman Act was not

intended to take away the power to regulate industries from
States.

So we have no desire to argue preemption in that sense.
I would refer this Court also to the opinion in

30

Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison with which there has been much
play in this case.

It seems to me that, that case is disposi­

tive in favor of a lack of immunity here,

I know that Jackson

v. Metropolitan Edison involved the 14th amendment, but I
think if there was no State action under the 14th amendment
in that case, there can be no State action for Parker purposes
in this case.

And I think that at a minimum the State

action concept under the 14th amendment, is as broad as the
1

\

•

State action concept for Parker purposes, and indeed I would
take one step further and say that it’s probably broader.

You

can see that by transposing the facts of the Schwegmann case.
There the Court said that a private party might force
retailers to maintain prices and provided the procedures if he
elected.
If one, in a parallel fashion, supposed a

statute

in which a State said a private party may force retailers to
keep off a racial group from the premises of the retailer and
provided procedures, I have no doubt that that would be State
action for the purposes of the 14th amendment.

So that I think

the 14th amendment State action concept is broader than the
State action concept here.

If that's true, or if it's

coterminus, then Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison I think is
dispositive of this case in favor of the petitioner.
QUESTION;

It's really -- one might not want to

push the analogy too close.

It’s not much more than an

31
analogy, in other words.
MR. BORK:

Jackson?

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. BORK:

Well, I think ites --

QUESTION:

The question is a different question.

MR. BORK:

It is a different question, but as I

ask myself how does State action concept differ, I think it
essentially involves affirmative State policy or involvement
under the 14th amendment.
under Parker.

It involves affirmative State policy

I think it's somewhat perhaps •— I don't think

it's necessary for the Court to decide which is broader, but it
seems to me that it can hardly be argued plausibly that the
antitrust concept of State action is broader than the 14th
amendment concept, and unless that’s true, then I think
Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison really disposes of this case
by analogy, if you wish to say it that way.
QUESTION:

You say

..

but it might

riot run the other way.
MR. BORK:
how it could

I don't think it would run — I don't see

run the other way.

QUESTION:

That assumes that Parker v. Brown is the

limit of the governmental immunity.
MR. BORK:

Well, if you go further than that, Mr.

Justice Reshnquist,and say that Parker v. Brown allows not only
affirmative State policy, but any time the State gets into the

32

area and involves itself heavily, then you have done two
things:

One is you have said the State has the power of

implied repealer over the Federal antitrust laws.
think that's correct.

I don't

And the other thing is that you are

creating an elaborate administrative mechanism into which any
party can insert his program and cry sanctuary, even though the
State wasn't thinking about it.
QUESTION;

You have 50 of them.

MR. BORK: You have 50 of them, not to mention all
the localities.

And this is becoming a serious antitrust

problem, and I think applying the rule as we ask does two
things:

It forwards Federal antitrust policy, it also begins

to put some pressure on agencies to focus and to make visible
decisions, visible to the electorate, to elected officials
about what it is they wish to require as State policy.

I

think it's desirable at both ends.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Solicitor

General.
QUESTION:

I have one question.

On your point that

the Jackson case would be dispositive, I suppose one could
distinguish if one thought this was a command and the other
was merely permission.
MR. BORK:

Those are different State programs.

If one thought this were a command, I

think that is quite true, Mr. Justice Stevens.

If this is a

command, however, then I fear that almost any regulatory

33
touching of the subject will turn out to be a command*

AFTERNOON SESSION
(1p.m. )
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Mr. Reycraft, you may

begin whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE D. REYCRAFT ON
BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. REYCRAFTs
the Courts

Fir. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

With the exception of the treble damages which

the petitioner seeks here, all he seeks otherwise is available
to him from the Michigan Public Service Commission.

He

conceded during oral argument before Judge Feikens that it may
well be, theoretically at least, that the Michigan Public
Service Commission can tell Detroit Edison to avoid including
the cost of light bulbs in its rate base for purposes of
determining its rate.
When Judge Feikens asked him whether he had ever
tried to invoke the proceedings in the Michigan Public Service
Commission, he admitted that it was a crucial question as to
whether or not the lamp exchange program came within the
jurisdiction, but he conceded that he hadn't approached the
Commission at all.
It seems to us that Judge Feikens was.correct in his
opinion when he said certainly the antitrust court should not
step in when the Commission hasn't even been approached by fch©
plaintiff.

35
Now, the petitioner and the Department of Justice
both seam to us to be operating under what we believe are
misconceptions of both fact and law and the way the regulatory
process works in the State of Michigan.

The Commission's most

recent order to Detroit Edison involving the lamp supply
program is in Case U-4570, which is dated February 3, 1975.
The Opinion and Order of the Commission begins with the language"
"Therefore, It Is-Ordered'that;"
It goes on to say at paragraph D, "In conformance
with Commission Order No. D-3096, Filing Procedures, The Detroit
Edison Company shall promptly file with the Commission rate
schedules substantially the same as those attached hereto as
Exhibit A."
Exhibit A, which is referred to in the order is the
lamp supply program.

It contains the following languages

"Incandescent lamps will be furnished without extra charge
(1) to residents connected for the first time to the company's
lines in such quantities as may be needed for all permanent
fixtures, (2) as replacements of approved burned-out lamps in
proportion to the us® of energy for lighting purposes under the
applicable rates."
The Commission then went on to say, "The Commission
specifically reserves jurisdiction of the matters herein
contained and the authority to issue such further order
orders as the facte and circumstances
require."

QUESTION;

Your argument is they were ordered and

required to do it by the Stats.
MR. REYCRAFT:
QUESTION;

That is correct.

Do you think that is the standard that

Parker v , Brown says that when an

agency in a State issues a command to a private entity which
is within the scope of its authority, that the conduct that
follows is
QUESTION;

Do you think the rule should be broader

than that and probably just mere authorization?
MR. REYCRAFT;

I don't, your Honor.

I don't think it

is necessary for us at least to go that far.
QUESTION;

So you agree that the test is what the

Solicitor General said it is?
MR. REYCRAFT; I. would rather say that the test is
what Parker v. Brown said it is.
QUESTION;
v,. Brown

Exactly.

But do you think

he read Parker

right or not?
MR. REYCRAFT:

As I understood what h© said," I think

that he overread Parker v. Brown in that he appears to be
imposing a broader test upon what the scope of th® legislative
command is.
QUESTION;

Mere authorization wouldn't, do it.

MR. REYCRAFT:

Mere authorization, w© are not

Now what standard do you think the Court

of Appeals acted under?
MR. REYCRAFT 2

The Court of Appeals adopted Judge

Feikens opinion which had before it all these orders I am
referring to which commanded Detroit Edison -QUESTION:

That may be true, but what standard did

the Court of Appeals use in affirming the. —
MR. REYCRAFT:

What it said'was that the district

court had correctly applied the principles of Parker v. Brown
and thereby affirmed it.
QUESTION:

Didn’t it refer to authorization or not?

MR. REYCRAFT:

I believe it did say it was authorized,

but it did refer to Parker v. Brown which, of course, is
narrower than mere authorization.
QUESTION:

How about the district judge?

MR. REYCRAFT:
correctly

The district judge, I believe

described Parker v. Brown.

I can’t quote him

verbatim, but I believe he correctly recited Parker v. Brown.
QUESTION: I take it you don’t think there is any
problem here of either court below applying it wrong,
Parker v. Brown, saying that mere authorization is enough?
MR. REYCRAFT:

I don’t think so, Mr. Justice

Blackmun.
QUESTION:

Mr. Reycraft,

the district court

38
said when a State agency acts affirmatively in approving rates
and practices of utilities, there is no antitrust liability.
Do you think that’s a correct statement of law?
MR. REYCRAFT:

I think acting affirmatively — not

only that, I would take it that the court implies that that’s
a command of the State.
QUESTION:

That isn’t what it says.

That

isn’t

what, the court says»
MR. REYCRAFT:

All right, it. didn't use th® word

"command"9 no, sir.
QUESTION:
either:

And it isn’t what tie Court of Appeals said

"In concluding that th@ affirmative action of the
' i

;

Commission in approving appellee's rat© structure that provides
for the distribution of light bulbs and its continuing supervision
of appellee brings the challenged practice within the doctrine
of Parker v. Brown.
MR. REYCRAFT:

That’s what it says, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

It doesn’t say anything about command.

It says the affirmative action in approving.
MR. REYCRAFT:

Th® action, however, which is

referred to is in fact a command, and those commands were
before the district court and were in the record which the
Court of Appeals considered.
QUESTION:

Could th® company have altered its rates

39

without further action of the Commission?
MR. REYCRAFTs

No, it could not, Mr. Chief Justice,

it could not have altered its rates.

.

It must get th® approval

of th© Commission to either increase or decrease its rates.
QUESTIONS

Than do you say that the rate structure

was a command even though it didn’t use the word command?
MR. REYCRAFTs
QUESTION;

Rate structure is indeed a command.

Was the company required to file a tariff

which included the furnishing of light bulbs?
MR. REYCRAFT:

No.

Th® company could have filed a

tariff which did not include light bulbs, but as long as ~
QUESTION:

It was not ordered to file a tariff that

It was not commanded to

Obviously, it seems to me, a public utility —

QUESTION:

Was there some law in Michigan that

required idle Public Service Commission to approve th® tariff
if it had light bulbs in it?
MR. REYCRAFT:

The law is 460.6, which, of course, is

a broad grant of jurisdiction to th© Public Service Commission
to completely regulate public utilities within the State,
including electric lighting companies and all th© services

40
that they provide with it.

There is, of course, no specific

reference to light bulbs in the statute, but there is reference
to electric lighting in it, and that is the authority

under

which the Public Service Commission was operating.
!

QUESTION:

Mr. Reycraft, is the Solicitor General

correct that years ago

they stopped going to fch© homes to

deliver bulbs and didn't change the tariff?
MR. REYCRAFT:

I don’t know whether that’s correct or

not, Mr. Justice Marshall.

I believe that the practice may have

been discontinued at the end of the effective tariff.

In other

words, when Detroit Edison filed a new tariff, I believe that
that particular home delivery service may have been excluded.
But that occurred back in the 1930's, and I can’t represent to
this Court that it was terminated before or only after the new
tariff became effective, but that is my belief.
QUESTION:

Tb® State says to an industry, "You can

fix prices in the industry, or you needn't fix prices in the
industry, but if you want to, go ahead, just file a piece of
paper up here with our Commissioner of Prices and if he says
OK, go ahead."

Is that all right?

MR. REYCRAFT;

No, sir, that’s not all right.

That

does not provide any trust immunity within Parker v. Brown.
QUESTION:

But even if the law said, "If you want to

fix prices in the industry, just file a piece of paper, and if
you file a piece qf paper, then you will be ordered to do it."

41
MR. REYCRAFT:
QUESTION:

Well, I would think that that —

Then you are under an order, once you have

all agreed to this under an order, then the order is good,
although you don't have to decide to in the first place, the
law doesn't require you to fix prices.

You have an option to

fix prices or not.
MR. REYCRAFT:

If it’s optional, as I understand the

Court's decision in Parker v. Brown, then the conduct is
excluded from the antitrust laws.
I would like to refer to another decision

of the

Commission in 1964 where in Case No. 1791 the Michigan
Public Service Commission specifically reviewed th® lamp exchange
program.

At the time it was

available to our commercial

customers, and Detroit Edison wanted to reduce its cost so it
could reduce its rates, and it did go to th© Commission and it
asked for permission to eliminat© the lamp supply program to
large commercial customers.

Th© Public Service Commission did

permit that.

lamp replacements of approved

It said that

burned-out incandescent lights will continue to be furnished
under its general service rate which applied to small business,
and it also required it to

continue to furnish lamps under

the exchange program to residential customers.

So not only

did it consider the lamp supply program in 1964, but it exercised
discriminatory judgment as to which parts of the program
would continue and which parts would b® eliminated.

And in 1964

42
it. said, it further ordered that Detroit Edison shall promptly
file rat© changes to be effective on service rendered after
December 1, 1364, and that included the residential lamp
program.

And at that time it reserved jurisdiction of the

matter and the authority to issue further orders as they may b®
required.

And the order is signed by each of the Commissioners

under date of November 12, 1964.

There have been 18 orders

of the Michigan Public Service Commission and its predecessor
to Detroit Edison since 1916.

The Michigan Public Service

Commission and its predecessor ~ well, State regulation of
utilities began in Michigan in 1909.

And sine© 1916 Detroit

Edison has been at all times under an affirmative order to
continue the lamp supply program.
Now, the petitioner complains that there hasn't been
any antitrust type hearing, which 1 understand is th® nature of
what h@ thinks would b@ appropriate in the Michigan Public
Service Commission.

The reason for that, it seems to me, is that

no on© has ever asked for such a hearing.

W© don't know of any

complaints which have been mad© to th® Michigan Public Service
Commission about th© lamp supply program.
someone may not have written a letter.
complaints.

I wouldn't say that

There may not have been

But w© don't know about it.

There has been a cas© filed in a State court in
Michigan which the petitioner refers to in his brief.
Grill cas®.

It's the

It was filed in 1973 and it seeks an injunction

43

against the continuation of the lamp program.

We haven't

mentioned it in our brief# for which I apologize.

But 1 have

learned over the recess that th® Circuit Court in Michigan
has decided that case and had dismissed it in 1974.

That's an

unreported opinion and I didn't know about it# and I would like
permission to furnish a copy to th© Court.

It decided the

case# it dismissed the case on the ground that it lacked
jurisdiction of the subject matter because th© Michigan Public
Service Commission had jurisdiction over th© lamp supply

program and that th© petitioner# th© plaintiff in that case#
had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before
coming into even th© State circuit court.*
We think that these ar© State law questions that th®

should argue to th© Commission.

to decide what are# I would concede at. least# realistic and

QUESTIONS

Does th® Parker v. Brown issue, which I

44
understand to be the basis of th® decision in th© district
court turn at all on whether or not the plaintiff has exhausted
his State administrative remedies?
MR. REYCRAFT:

I don't believe that it does, Its:.

Justice Stevens„
QUESTIONS

Then really it's not before us, is it?

MR. REYCRAFT:

It is not except to th® extent that —

I don't know that jurisdiction was argued in Parker v. Brown
but here petitioner is arguing that the Michigan Public
Service Commission did not have jurisdiction to order the lamp
supply program into effect or to be continued.

So when he

says that, he is bringing into this case th© State law question
which I don't know was raised in Parker v. Brown.
I think it's unreasonable to expect that the Michigan
Public Service Commission would on its own initiative start an
antitrust type hearing on a light bulb exchange program which
has been in effect in Detroit Edison and its predecessor since
1885 and has been under orders of the Commission since 1916.
I would like to go into' the facts a little bit,
although I know that th© Court doesn't want to get into too
much detail of the facts.

It seems to me they demonstrat® th®

reasonableness of th© Commission's continuing to order the
lamp exchange program and th© reasonableness of its. not
initiating antitrust criteria before th© Michigan Public Service
Commission.

45
QUESTIONs

Mr. Reycraft, does the reasonableness of

th© program relate to whether there is a violation of law?
But would it relate

to the question whether Parker v» Brown

applies?
MR. REYCRAFT:

I think it relates to the question

of whether th© Michigan Public Service Commission procedures
were adequate and whether th®y conducted an adequate inquiry
into Detroit Edison's lamp exchange program.

For example, the

Public Service Commission has had rate hearings just about
©very year for th© past five years — 1970,

these costs to b© included in customer installation expense
which is where they ar© included.
This is also consistent with th© treatment which the
Federal Power Commission requires and has required since 1937.
So that there isn't any mystery about th© fact that there has
been a lamp supply program that Detroit Edison has had in effect
since 1885.
How, my friend on tha other aid© has said that th.©
lamp supply program has mad® Detroit Edison th® best-loved
utility in th® country, and if that's ‘the result of the lamp
program, which I understood is what h® is saying, it seams to
me that that certainly demonstrates th® widespread us® and
knowledge of the existence of tha lamp supply program.
We had a survey conducted some years ago which
indicated that 94 parcent of our customers us© th® lamp supply
program.

There ar© about a million and a half households in

Detroit Edison's service area which gets service from Detroit.
If 94 percent of them us® th® lamp supply program, it's hardly

47
any secret»

At least we have not kept it a secret, and in

fact the exhibit which petitioner's counsel referred to in the
appendix which shows the availability of th© different sized
light bulbs demonstrates that this program is well publicised»
QUESTION:

Mr. Reycraft, are you arguing that a

plaintiff before h© can prosecute in a Federal antitrust suit
has to exhaust procedures before a State agency?
MR» REYGRAFT:

I've got some alternative grounds,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, on which I think that this case can
and should b® disposed of,where there is an available State
procedure, I think he should b© required to exhaust it.
QUESTIONs

But there is no authority, at least from

this Court, for that proposition, is there?
MR. REYGRAFTs

No, I would agree with that.

X think

th© closest authority is the Ricci case where th© Court
referred an antitrust plaintiff to th© Commodity Exchange
Authority before the Court decided

QUESTION:

And hera the State proceeding is a rat©”
.And as you said the hearings certainly

didn't proceed as though it had any anticompetitive
included in it.
MR. REYCRAFTs

My basic point is that the petitioner

is arguing that th® command which the Michigan Public Service
Commission did issue was outside th© scope of their authority
and the ultra vires # as th© Solicitor General referred to it,
and I think that th© determination of that question is a
State question.
All right.

Now* I think if that's the basis of his

argument that this is antitrust violation —
QUESTION s

Apparently both courts below accepted th©

order as valid, didn't they?
MR. REYCRAFT:

They did# and

T

think correctly.

I have started to talk about gome of the facts which
shot*

th© reasonableness of tlx© exercise by the Public Service

Commission of their jurisdiction.

These include the fact that

th® cost of -th® light bulbs were passed through to th®
t

consumer without any profit or any markup on the part of the
company as required by the Michigan Public Service Commission.
Th® petitioner argues that the customer service
offices are part of Detroit Edison's rat® base and that therefore
there may bs som© element of those facilities in Detroit’s
profits,.

The fact is that these customer service offices perform

49
a wide variety of services, and they would hav© to be continued
even if the lamp exchange program was discontinued.
Edison’s profits are allowed

Detroit

as a percentage of its rate base.

The current percentage allowed is 8.7 percent,

And that is not

applied in any way to the cost of the light bulbs.

Thas® are

passed -through as a cost of service and included in the
customer’s rate foas®.

Thera ar© 50 of these customer sarvie©

centers and 35 agents who distributa the bulbs.

That sounds like an argument to me that

it doesn’t cost them anything because it’s there anyway.

QUESTION;

We hav© that kind of argument at home.

MR. REYCRAFTs

Sir?

Yes.

Well, in Detroit you

could send somebody down to th® customer service canter and
have the argument there.
QUESTION;

Your rates could be entirely reasonable

and that wouldn’t be a defense to an antitrust action, would it?
MR. REYCRAFTs

My argument, Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc,

50

is as fco the reasonableness of the procedures of the
Michigan Public Service Commission.

Th® petitioner has

complained that there was no antitrust criteria for the Michigan
Public Service Commission and th© fact that the program is a
program which is beneficial fco the public

„

th© fact that it

does not return a profit fco Detroit Edison, the fact that the
cost of the bulbs is far below what th® consumer could get th®
bulbs for on fch© open market, all explaining to my satisfaction
at least why the Michigan Public Service Commission did not
hold an extended antitrust type trial, which is what petitioner
seems to be asking here.
In 1972, for example, there were 18 ~
QUESTXQN:

Suppose, Mr. Raycraffc, your analysis

is correct — and, of course, it’s summary judgment, so I guess
we have to taka your opponent's version whether it’s a dispute —
but if your analysis is correct, you have demonstrated that
giving the customers an option, they still take th© free light
bulbs.
MR. REYCRAFTs
QUESTION:

That may well be.

So that w® are really deciding about whether

it should be optional or mandatory.
MR. REYCRAFT:
sure about that.

Well, I think what we are -- I'm not

I think that if the program became optional,

I'm not sure that Detroit Edison would apply to hava a program
in its tariff, and I'm not sure whether if it became optional

Was there a class determination

MR. REYCRAFT:

No, your Honor, there was no motion

for a class determination.

No class determination has been

Anci I might say at that point that the petitioner has

testified in this case that h© sold -- I ball®vet it was over
a two- or three-year period — light bulbs with a retail gross
value of about. $135.

H® also testified that his cost for

those bulbs was about $90.
100 watt bulb was 21 cents.

His specific price pssr bulb for a
He sold them for 32 cents.

Th© average cost of bulbs for customers in th©
Detroit area in 1972 was $1.80 through the. Detroit Edison
program, which, of course, is included in our rate base.
Another reason why we are cibi® to furnish light bulbs
at this cost is because Detroit Edison gets

competitive bids

52
from the light bulb manufacturers.

Th@r® ar© three principal

manufacturers ~ General Electric# Westinghouse# and Sylvania.
Detroit Edison puts together specifications and asks for bids,
And it buys from the manufacturer which submits the best bid#
and these savings# as X testified# are passed on to the
consumer»
In addition, the bulbs that they will get# b@ca.us©
they will ask for competitive bids# has a longer life than a
generally available commercial bulb.

The average bulb# th©

average life of a 100-watt bulb is X#350 hours, whereas th®
generally available commercial bulb has only 750 hours of light.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Beyeraft# how many utilities are there

MR. REYCRAFT:

MR. REYCR&FTs

In th© first instance, of

And do you know of any instance where

the Commission has ordered a utility to have a lamp program

MR. REYCRAFT;

MR. CRAFTs

No, I don’t.

And the statute doesn’t say so.
No, th® statute does not say that electric

utilities shall have lamp supply programs.

No, it does not.

The Michigan Public Service Commission is an agency,
of course, created by the State of Michigan, and unlike the
Advisory Prorata Commission in Parker v. Brown, it does not
consist of a group of private self-interested persons who are
acting in a quasi-governmental capacity.

Each of the

Commissioners is appointed for a term of 6 years bv th©
Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate.

They are

prohibited from having any pecuniary interest in any regulated

They

A utility can’t

increase its rates directly or increase' its rates indirectly

54
by reducing service, and that includes eliminating the light
bulbs, without specific permission of th® Michigan Public
Service Commission.

So before raising rates or reducing

service, fchay need the approval of the Commission.
As I said, the procedures are extensive? 65 days
of hearings in the last rate case and over 7500 pages of
testimony.
This Court recently considered th© Parker v« Brown
issue in Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar and repeated th®
holding that if private conduct is required by th® State acting
in its capacity as sovereign, fcha conduct is not subject to
Federal antitrust laws.

There, unlike the Michigan Public

Service Commission, th® Virginia State Bar was only a State
agency for very limited purposes and certainly was not.under
any command from the Virginia State Supreme Court to fix
minimum prices for attorneys offering their services.

They said it 10 consecutive times —

They said "ordered."

MR. REYCRAFT:

They said that — I quoted the language a little earlier.
They said, "It is hereby ordered that the Detroit Edison

MR. REYCRAFT:

The Commission does have the "power to

it exists, to make it optional, or to discontinue it altogether.
What they would do if the issue were presented to them in that
way, I cannot honestly say that I know.

That kind of a proceed­

ing in a rate proceeding generally requires no

and appearance of witnesses in th® rate proceeding so that
consumers could come in and say, "We want it this way, we want
it that way."

Yes, we did that.

And v© have don© it sine® 1916 on 18 separate occasions, yes,

Now, it seems to me that the Michigan Public
Service Commission could easily, if it's brought to its
attention, take into account antitrust policy.

Michigan has

an antitrust law, so the antitrust laws in competition ar®

59

fcne State policy of Michigan just, as are the national policy
of the United States under the Federal antitrust laws.

So

that in State utilities, public utilities can be the first
line of defense against anticompetitive practices which may
later turn out to be antitrust violations.

So that the

petitioner has a forum before the Michigan Public Service
Commission, there is a procedure under which it can intervene,
it could appear as a witness in a separate complaint procedure
which he could use if he really 'wants a determination as to
whether this light bulb program should continue rather than to
have a nice lawsuit with a big class action which at some time
might produce treble damages.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Trienens.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD J. TRIENENS AS
AMICUS CURIAE ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. TRIENENS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

60

the Court:

I represent a group of Michigan utilities who

locally couldn't care less about light bulbs»

Some are

electric companies who do not have this provision^ others are
gas and telephone companies.

Our concern is not with this

particular tariff or the provisions, merits, public interest,
anticompetitive or otherwise features of it»

Our interest is

in tne position taken by petitioner and the Solicitor General
which would make life absolutely impossible for a utility to
operat©, and would be grossly unjust.
Let me just as an illustration of the point that has
just been discussed by Mr, Justice White and Mr, Justice
Marshall, I don't think it makes the slightest difference
whether the utility proposed this tariff,

whether the

Chairman of the Commission drafts it, or the Speaker of the
House drafts it.
tariff,

The point is, no matter who submitted this

the utility does not have the option.

If Detroit

Edison files a tariff with this lamp provision in it, the
Commission can take it out.

If the utility files a tariff

vita tnfe provision out, the Michigan Commission can put it
back in.
The authority for that is under the pervasive
regulatory statute which is common in the public utility
regulatory matters where in addition to fixing rates, the
Commission may by order also establish such rules and
conditions of service as shall be just and reasonable.

61

Now, you are absolutely right, Mr. Justice Marshall,
there are hundreds of these conditions of service and these
tariffs just bristle with problems.

Who puts the meter where,

who takes the pipe how far in, and who pays how much to get a
cable put in in a subdivision.
problems.

These are just full of

And they bristle with antitrust problems.

And this

is just one of them.
My point is that under the pervasive regulation it
doesn't matter who wrote the first draft.

The important thing

is that the Michigan Commission is th® on® who decides it.
Now, there is more to it than that, and this is
%

critical and it's something I hope I can emphasize enough.
The standards are different.

Under Parker v. Brown you can't

just say, "Let's forget competition."

There has to be a State

policy that competition is displaced, eliminated, or
subordinated.
And that isn't enough.

You also have to substitute

machinery whereby the State imposes its views of what the
proper decision is under the other stand&ard.

In the utility

field they call it the public interest standard.
x

Now, in Michigan, the, Michigan Supreme Court said
in the case of

.Fern

here in 1951 that the right to

exclude competition where the general public convenience and
necessity so require has been delegated by th® legislature to
the Michigan Public Services Commission.

62
The standard is not the same as th© standard under
the antitrust laws.
QUESTION;

Are you arguing this case or some other

case?
MR. TRIEMENS:

I am arguing this case, because the

question here is really one of standards.

The question her© is

the

QUESTION:

Are you arguing that the Michigan Public

Service Commission doss have authority to and regularly does

MR. TRIENENS:

Mo. sir.

I am saying they don’t have

to and that’s irrelevant, because the statute has said
as Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in connection with ■ a

and
Federal

statute regarding these public utilities, surely it cannot be
said that competition is of itself a national policy in areas
like public utilities.
Now, that's shown not only -- I’m reading from
FCC v. RCA Communications, 346 U.S. 92.
abundantly plain by th© legislative
QUESTION:
there do you think?

That's also made
and shown by Congress

What competition was he referring to

63
MR. TRIENENS:

He is referring there to two overseas

cables as to whether -— there is no doubt that competition was
aided, by allowing another cable to come in, and he says there
is more to it than that, that competition is not the national
policy, the be all and end all, when you are dealing with these
regulatory matters where it's pervasively regulated under a
public interest standard.
Now, that is the critical distinction here because
there has been a different standard and the machinery for
enforcing that standard substituted for competition —
substituted for competition.

That's what public utility

regulation is all about.
The Solicitor General speaks of a trend. He says
there has been a trend here where, as he would put it, soma
people arts starting .to use mechanisms of States to frustrate
national policy.

Now, as I have read, the national policy is

not -— and I emphasize "not" — to impose competition as part
of the standard of regulating public utilities.
not.

It's simply

And the Federal Power Act, the Federal Corrimunications Act,

th® Natural Gas Act all use the public interest standard, and
most importantly here, leave to the States,

leave to the

States as to these local distribution matters like Detroit
Edison the question of their regulation under their public
interest standard.
Now, if you go to a Federal antitrust court

and

64
that's what this is all about •— whether you are going to have
a hearing on whether these light bulbs last long and whether
they ar© good or bad or indifferent, you are going to have a
hearing in an antitrust court.

That's what these people want.

It may be that the petitioners want treble damages, but what
the Solicitor General wants is to take over in the antitrust
courts the imposition of Federal antitrust standards.
he doesn't preempt.

He says

He preempts in practical effect by imposing

Federal antitrust standards through the Federal courts on the
States.
QUESTION;

Suppose the Commission in Michigan tells

the Podunk Gas Company in Michigan that you must furnish
light bulbs with your electricity.
MR. TRIENENS;
QUESTION;

They may do that.

Well, suppose they say you must also

furnish electric stoves.
MR. TRIENENS:
QUESTION;

I think they could do that, too.

Where would it stop?

Coliid they go to

electric automobiles'?
MR. TRIENENS;

Where would they stop.

It would not

stop, in my view, because the Federal antitrust court started
trying all these tariff matters.

If they took over too much

beyond the traditional public utility regulation and the
Commission did that, which I doubt, and the State court affirmed,
which I doubt, this Court still sits to review.

jf there is

65

a commerce problem or a due process problem, or they have gone
too far, this Court sits.

You do not make every tariff issue

into an antitrust case in order to deal with that kind of
speculative problem that is not before us.
QUESTION:

Mr. Trienens --

MR. TRIENENS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

-- in my home town of Phoenix, there are

two utilities both serving the same general area and there is,
as I said, a conscious policy of division of territory which
is approved, by the Arizona Corporation Commission.

Do you

understand under th® Solicitor General's theory that because
*th® two utilities agree that they should be ordered to do that
by the Utility Commission that that territory allocation would
be actionable?
MR. TRIENENS:

I think that the answer is yes.

While

he would say they don’t preempt, he has suggested to you this
court
morning that there be some antitrust/’review" of each and every
decision of that kind to find out whether they had stated the
State policy precisely enough.
Now, that’s a fine business for the Federal courts

You think the McCarran Amendment was

MR. TRIENENSs

I think it scared them to death and

they weren't taking any chances.
If they go to a nearing — now, say this is on a
public interest standard.

If they go to a hearing, I don't

know how it's going to come out any more than any of the
counsel here.

But the Public Service Commission in Michigan

would have the hearing.

People in Detroit who want or don't

want light bulbs could come to that hearing.
would decide it.

The Commission

They would either knock the provision out or

change it, as they did in

..

or they could have two kinds

of rates, on® with and one without,

or any other alternative.

The point is it would be decided on the public interest standard
of Michigan and not under the be all and end all sole aim
which is the antitrust law.
I'm not here arguing that these utilities in Michigan
ar© engaged in a State action any more them the raisin growers
in Parker v, Brown were in State, action.

What X am saying is

and what Parker v, Brown means is that where the State defines
an area, defines an area where it doesn’t believe that the
State's interest is served, public interest is served, by having
;

competition be the sole standard.
Ar-d that's not enough.

Where they also substitute

regulatory machinery which is pervasive, then that does
displace the antitrust laws, not because of some implied
immunity, but because that is what the antitrust laws meant,

68

that is what they meant sine® Olsen v.■ Smith in 1904, that9s
what 'they have never meant.

And what the Solicitor General

is suggesting in adding to the business of the Federal court
is a radical departure that if it has merit

— I say it does

not economically — if it has merit, that8s a matter for
Congress.

There is a raging dispute in Congress about

deregulation, and if there is deregulation, the antitrust laws
come in.

You can argue that in surface transportation, you

can argue it in electricity.

All I am saying is it8s a

legislative matter, and Parker v„ Brown, which simply construes
and applies the Sherman Act should not be given this vast
extension.

This is a matter that should be left for Congress.
Mow, there is a fairness question her®, too.
QUESTION:

What about the question I asked Mr.

Reycraft, if the State had a general statute that said that
if industrias would like to substitute price fixing for
competition,they may.

They just — anybody who wants to fix

prices can come in and apply to the Price Commissioner and. get
permission.
MR. TRIENENS: I say that * s Schwegmann and it"s not
permitted.

I say under Parker v. Brown it's much closer to that

than this case, because under Parker v. Brown whether there was
going to be any displacement of competition depended on the
initiative of the petitioning raisin growers.

Here it doesn’t

depend on any initiative of Michigan Consolidated Gas or on

Detroit Edison.

They are regulated, their rates are fixed —

I know, but the decision whether or not

to furnish light bulbs is their decision.
MR. TRIENENS:

It is th© Commission’s decision.

Well, they haven’t ordered anybody to

Why should they?

I didn't ask you that.

Could who take it out?

Detroit Edison.

MR. TRIENENS;

Detroit Edison could file a tariff

which in effect asks for relief from the outstanding order
and ask the Commission to relieve them of doing that with a
corresponding rate adjustment.

do not furnish

■

MR. TRIENENS:

That's correct.

And some of them have

another alternative, where they are ordered to keep furnishing
them if the customer wants them, but not furnish them if the
customer doesn't.
QUESTION:

What kind of a State policy is that with

respect to -this?
MR. TRIEMENS s

The State policy is that electric

companies are pervasively regulated and all the terms and
conditions of the rate, what service is provided, how far it
goes, and who maintains what, is to b© decided by the Michigan
Commission in the public interest with competition not being
the be all. and end all as it would be under the antitrust laws.
QUESTION:

Or even a factor, it doesn't have to be in
i

your view.
MR. TRIENENS:

It, doesn't have to be a factor.

A

State can eliminate or subordinate it, as they wish.
QUESTION:

And you say in effect then all the

Michigan utilities, the ones -that, furnish light bulbs and those
that don't, are subjected to this same pervasive regulatory
standard.
MR. TRIENENS:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

And you would say the same thing, I suppose,

They didn8t submit to the Commission the

agreement.
MR. TRXENENS;

There is the question that Mr. Justice

Stevens asked me about.
QUESTION;

X want your answer.

MR,TRXENENS;

I don't believe they do.

X don't

believe they can get together and conspire to do it.

X think

they have to make their own judgment on what they think is in
the public interest, make their draft of the regulation,
submit it to the Commission, and whether the Commission let's
it go into effect or not is for the Commission to decide in
the public interest,
If X may make just one comment here.

Looking at it

from the point of view of the utility itself, to subject a
utility to duplicate but. inconsistent standards, one where
competition is the sol® aim, the other, the public interest
where it isn't.

It's an impossible position to put a utility.

Whether the Commission

drafts these orders or whether the

utility comes with a proposal, he can't do it when he's got
two masters.

It's just basically unfair and is not intended

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BURTON I. WEINSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. WEINSTEINs

I hops I don't use all of that? your

Honor.
The existence of a State remedy is no bar to a Federal
remedy here.

There is no reason to require us to go back to

the Michigan Public Service Commission.

In fact, in the briefs

I don3t believe -they have given any substantial reason why we
can go back there.
Simply, there is no command here by the State.

The

MPSC will command whatever the company asks.
QUESTIONS

Could I ask this on© question.

Does the

record show that there are other Michigan public utilities that
do not have lamp programs or that hav© optional programs?
MR. WEINSTEIN;

Tine record does not show that.

Th© Michigan Public Service Commission, will do what
the utility wants.

Th© company would at most just have to file

a new tariff and lower the rates, and it could drop the light
bulb program.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
