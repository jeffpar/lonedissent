MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

next in No. 74-1563, City of Eastlak© against Forest City
Enterprises.
Mr. Andrews
ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. MELVIN ANDREWS ON
BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. ANDREWSs
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

The City of Eastlake is located approximately 15

miles east of Cleveland, in the State of Ohio, and has about
20,000 people, and it is a city which operates under a charter
type of government which, under the Ohio Constitution, grants
to the city all rights of local self-government, and it grants
to the people sovereign rights insofar as they do not conflict
with the Ohio Constitution or general laws.
The City of Eastlak© has adopted a general zoning
plan some 25 years ago in which the entire city is zoned into
various districts for industrial, business, and residential
use.

The general zoning plan of the City of Eastlak© is not

under attack in this case.
In May of 1971, Forest City, the respondent herein,
asked or requested rezoning of an 8-acr© parcel of land from
a limited industrial use to a multiple-family us® for the
purpose of building multiple housing.

The record does not

disclose the type of multiple housing, whether it b© very

4
expensive apartments or the lower economic variety»
At any rate, the Planning Commission of the City of
Eastlake approved this rezoning request, and in the meantime
the voters by initiative petition had made an amendment to the.
East!ake City Charter requiring that before any rescuing
of land becomes finally effective it must be submitted to a
55 percent majority vote of the people»
Mow, the City Council then approved the rezoning
request of Forest City, and under the Eastlak® Charter amendment
it was submitted for a vote of the people and failed to
receive th© 55 percent affirmative vote necessary for its
passage.
Forest City then applied to 'the local Court of Common
Pleas requesting injunctive relief and declaratory judgment
asking that the court declare th© Eastlak® Charter amendment
to be unconstitutional.»

The Court of Common Pleas affirmed

the constitutionality of the Eastlak© Charter amendment,and
subsequently in the Court of Appeals, the Eastlak© Charter
amendment was affirmed, and then in the Ohio Supreme Court
the decision was reversed.

And the Ohio Supreme Court found

a reasonable us© of property by rezoning may not be mad©
dependent upon the potentially arbitrary and unreasonable
whims of the voting public without violating due process under
the 14th Amendment to th© Federal Constitution.
It's important to note that th© Ohio Supreme Court

5
did not find the Eastlake Charter amendment to violate the
Ohio Constitution or the general laws of the State of Ohio
even though this was contended by the respondent throughout.
The issue in this case is whether the mandatory
referendum voting procedure of the Eastlake Charter relative
to rezoning constituted unlawful delegation of legislative
power to th® electorate in violation of the Federal Constitutione
I believe basically that the Ohio Supreme Court got th© cart
before th© horse because th© delegation of power is not from
the Council to the people, but itss exactly the opposite under
the Charter and under th© Ohio Constitution.
given by th® people to th© Council.

Th® power is

They can give as much of

the power to th® Council as -they desire or they can retain it
unto themselves.
Really, what is involved here, we beHave, is a
struggle on a lawful issue between whether th© final power of
rezoning shall reside in the City Council or whether it shall
reside in th© people.
Th© Supreme Court has placed in jeopardy th® final
power of th© people in respect to rezoning.
QUESTION s

Your entire argument is based upon the

hypothesis that zoning is a legislative function.
MR. ANDREWS:

That is correct.

Now, the history of Ohio, without exception, mad©
th© determination that rezoning property is a legislative act

6

and as such subject to referendum»
QUESTION;

A variance would probably be an

administrative or quasi-judicial act, is that it?
MR. ANDREWS;

That’s right.

W© are not talking of

a variance here nor a hardship nor administering of the act.
QUESTION;

A general sorting provision.

MR. ANDREWS:

That’s right.

The basic thinking is

that as long as the people have the initial right to enact
zoning ordinances, then they also have the right of change,
because if that ware not so, then the final power of zoning
would vest in the Council and not in th© people.
My basic position is this is a pure local issue
as to where that power should be vested.
QUESTION;

If on® thought of zoning, generally

zoning, as a judicial or quasi™judicial function, you couldn't
make the argument you are making, could you?
MR. ANDREWS:

Thar® are, cases throughout the United

States where they have called rezoning a quasi-judicial act
or an administrative act and attempted to get around the
referendum, because the referendum even in Ohio is restricted
to legislative acts.
QUESTIONs

Right.

MR. ANDREWS;

But the Ohio Supreme Court, even in

this case, found this to be a legislative act and cited the
Ohio law which backs that up.

7
QUESTION s

toother Ohio law that has traditionally

been considered a l@gislat.iv© function»
MR. ANDREWSs
QUESTION?

That is correct, your Honor.

Is there any claim here that the existing

use of the property,, existing indiistrial zoning was an
unreasonable classification?
MR. ANDREWS:

Absolutely not.

This is the basic

problem here that there is no claim whatsoever that the
existing zoning classification of the property, which is
industrial zone

classification, is in any manner unreasonable.

There is no claim that there is any economic damage to the
respondent here by virtu© of the failure of the city to
rezone.

In other words, this property may b© equally valuable

as industrial property, maybe more so, than it would as
multiple family zoned housing.
There is nothing in the record to show that it would
be good city planning to resone the property as requested.
In fact, the proposed parcel is located directly between
industrial and business zoned property.
The very reason that this cam© into being is that
the respondent here is a very large developer of property
throughout the Ohio district, and idle history has been such
that they can go into a given community
power or control over the Council.

and exercise much

So the City of Eastlake

residents felt, rightly or wrongly, that Forest City had too

8

much sway over Council and that Council was making these
decisions not because of what is good fox' the city# but because
of pressures and so forth, what was good for Forest City.
And the very traditional concept of referendum was to sort of
counterbalance the wealthy and the entrenched, so -that the
people could reserve to -themselves the power to in effect veto
the actions of their Council.
QUESTION:

What if in Ohio, what if this city

subjected r®zoning or variances to referendum.
MR. ANDREWS:
QUESTIONs

There is a difference.

Let’s suppose it did.

What Federal

constitutional provision is implicated by that?
MR. ANDREWS:

The only way we got into the Federal

implication is that the Ohio Supreme Court made no finding of
any violation of Ohio law. but said that this procedure violated
the 14th Amendment of the Federal Constitution. Our premise is
that
QUESTION:

In what respect?

I understand tills,

In

my example, what provision of the Federal Constitution do you
think might be implicated?
MR. ANDREWS:
QUESTION:

Well, they said the 14th Amendment —

How about you?

MR. ANDREWS:

What do you think?

I don’t believe it's a question for

a Federal constitutional constraint at all.

Variances ar® administrative probably.

QUESTION:

Just talc®

MR. ANDREWS;

Probably a variance is usually given to

a board of appeals, and generally speaking, I think variances
are to be considered administrative probably —
QUESTION;

Then what provision of th© Federal

Constitution would b® implicated if those decisions were subject
to referendum?
MR. ANDREWS;

I don9t believe there would b© any.

I think the line is drawn here,

We go back to the Ambler

Realty case, 1926, in which this Court in its initial case
finding the general zoning to be valid under the police powers
said, number on®, that it had to he reasonable, and secondly
had to pass certain tests it has to bear reasonable resemblance
to fch© public health, the safety, morals and welfare.
I believe that if the final decision of the Council
people and so forth violates those safeguards of Ambler, then
on a case-by-cas© basis, then it should foe determined whether
/
/
or not it*s an unconstitutional restriction.

10

Federal Constitution has anything to do with a decision of the
people so long as fch© decision is reasonable as it applies to
any given property»
QUESTION;

What if the State of Ohio should make

every decision of the Suprema Court of Ohio subject to popular
recall, referendum»

Would that violate the Federal Constitution?

MR» ANDREWS;
QUESTION;

Would you repeat that, please?

Let's say the Ohio State legislature

provides that ©very decision of the Ohio Supreme Court upon
initiative of 5 percent of the people could fo© subject to
referendum and recall, i.e., popular overruling.

Would that

violate the Federal Constitution?
MR. ANDREWSs
QUESTION;

Really, this is far afield from —

Maybe not in theory.

I don't think it is

very far afield in theory, at least arguably.
MR. ANDREWS;

1 don't believe that court decisions

constitutionally can b© made the subject of a vote of the people
QUESTION;

Well, why not?

QUESTION;

In every State system?

MR. ANDREWS;

Pardon?

QUESTION;

State system.

QUESTION:

They didn't command any division of powers

in the State system.
QUESTION;

Ho, it has been expressly held.

QUESTION;

What, if you had a provision under Ohio

11
statute that said after a criminal defendant's trial in -the
Court of Common Pleas., th© verdict would then be submitted to
a referendum of the people in that county, and if they found
him guilty even if th© jury and th® Court of Common Pleas had
found him innocent, he would be regarded as guilty.
SIR. ANDREWSs

No, 1 don01 believe the people would

have that power.
QUESTION:

Take th© 6th and 14th Amendments,the

Supreme Court of Ohio hypothesis doesn’t involve those, does it?
MR. ANDREW^:

Like I say, that requiras so much —

I just haven’t considered that kind of a question her®.
think that we are into a different area.

I

I think we are dealing

here with a local decision, not with a court decision, that we
are dealing with legislative matters which are subject to th©
vote of the people.
Now, -whether judicial matters are subject to th© vote
of th® people is another question.

I don’t think it is involved

here.
QUESTION:

If th® Supreme Court of Ohio had based

this decision solely on Ohio law, would you be h©r@?
MR. ANDREWS s

It would have been much more difficult

to be her©, but -the Ohio Supreme Court base??, this entirely upon
a Federal Constitutional ground .

In effect, by their silence,

this held this does not: violate the Ohio Constitution or general
laws

12
QUESTION:

Do you think that Ohio would have reached

a different result if the referendum called for a

simple

majority rather than a 55 percent?
MR. ANDREWSs
difference whatsoever.

1

think there would hav® been no

Th@ traditional concept of Ohio law,

and I have quoted Idles® various decisions in my brief, many of
the statutes of Ohio require 55, 60, and 65 percent —
QUESTIONS

But the only issue her© is whether -they

were right in saying that merely submitting it to a referendum
violated the 14th Amendment.
MR. ANDREWS?

That's right.

And that's the precis©

issue that we are talking about here, and this is exactly what
the respondent contends, that it is the procedure by which
this is given to the people that they are arguing about.

They

don’t seem to say that there is? anything wrong with having a
referendum on zoning matters as long as 10 percent petition is
circulated, but the moment you eliminate that 10 percent
petition and say it will be by automatic referendum, then
they say that is not correct.
But anyhow, really, this

.doesn't make -that much

change because in the zoning procedures under Eastlake Charter,
and this is a traditional method, first of all, it goes to the
Planning Commission, and then there is a public hearing fosfor®
:-h&

Planning Commits ion, than it goes to City Council, there

is a public hearing before the City Council.

This far ids.©

13
amendment makes no change whatsoever»

If City Council turns

the change down, it makes no difference.

It’s only in the

event that City Council approves the proposed rezoning that
for the first time does this amendment com® into play, and than
it says before -that decision of City "Council becomes final
that it must be approved by a majority vote of the people.
How, if w© have a builder whose property or rezoning
is destined to become a subject of referendum by the 10 parcant
petition, it makes no difference at all other than the fact
fch© electorate havs to circulate fch® 10 pereant petition.
On til© other side of the fane®, if it does make a
difference, it might add as much, as siz months time to the
application, because you do haves to submit it for a vote of-the
people and there is some delay involved there.
I think we should at least mention, because of
Judge Stern's decision, that fch® record does not substantiate
any claim of racial or economic discrimination in this case.
I believe that respondent will probably back ate up.

Thera is

no record in tills case whatsoever except for the Charter and
the applicable ordinances.

So really we ar® talking entirely

about the constitutionality of fch® Eastlak© procedure provided
for rezoning.

It's a little unfortunate, because in the

Ohio Supreme Court there was a housing unit that filed a briaf

which was far afield from fch® record in this case, and there
fchsy advocated discrimination and impeding the right to

14
travel and so forth, and Judge Stern in his concurring majority
opinion adopted this kind of wording.
that the record in this case

But I don't believe

substantiates that and I don't

believe it is basically a discrimination case.
As a practical matter I believe that this case is
pretty well governed by the finding of this Court in thej
Valtierra case rising out of California.

Almost the same

arguments were mad® .in that case* even though that cas@
applied to public housing.

It was a constitutional amendment

of the State of California requiring before any low-rent housing
comes into any community it's subject to automatic referendum
requirements.

And the same arguments were mad© in here that

the developers were entitled

to this 10 percent procedure fcypa

petition and there Judge Black, I bel’ieve, .in the ruling said
that the referendum is a democratic decision-making procedure
in which by insuring that all people in the community will have
a voice in the decision which may lead to larga expenditures
of local government funds for increased public services:, so it
gives them a voice in the decisions that will affect the
development of the community.
I think that's what we are saying her®,that this is

a means whereby the people have a constitutioni! right to
reserve unto themselves -tin© power in respect to ra zoning.

NoWf if reasoning was a power -that was sat aside by
the Ohio Constitution, they said, "No, you can't vote on that,

SI

.15

that would b® something else.

There are certain things such

as fiscal matters, tax matters which are exempt.
not on® of them.

And rescuing

Basoning is

traditionally has been

subject to a vote of the people, first of all in adopting the
general zoning plan, and secondly, w© feel that they have the
power to reson®.
QUESTIONS

You haven’t, I think, dealt specifically

with the two or three decisions in this Court upon which the
Supreme Court of Ohio reliad, have you?
MR. ANDREWS;

Are you speaking now of -- Oh, y®s.

We are speaking now of the two cases

the Supreme Court balow

and also the respondents hare roly pretty much upon Roberge,
and this is a case way back in 1928, in which the court held
that th© philanthropic home could not be made the subject of
voting by people located in th® same block, and also th®
Eubank case which was in 1912, and this is one in which they
attempted to establish building lines by adjacent neighbors.
w© believe that neither of these cases ar® correctly
interpreted by the respondent or by the Ohio Supreme Court
because these are neighborhood preference cases.

They say that

they can’t hay© a vote of people in th® neighborhood, preference
cases, unless there are established standards.

But even in

those cases, in each case, th© Court said the power to locate
a philanthropic home, or th® general power of a city to locate
a philanthropic home we do not decide.

And in the other case

.16
the power to establish building lines we do not decide.
So these are the cases 'which war© relied upon by th® respondent
and I think they are misinterpreted, misrelied upon by th®
Ohio Supreme Court.

And this is exactly th® wording which was

used by the district court case out in California, the
Alameda Spanish Speaking case in which they said that th®
two cases war© misinterpreted and were not a basis for a finding
where the. entire referendum power of th® city is involved.
QUESTION;

Mr. Andrews, may I ask you a question?

MR. ANDREWS;
QUESTION;

Yes.

I understood you to indicate that th®

referendum was required because some history indicates that
th© Council was subservient to large economic interests of
some kind.
MR. ANDREWS;
QUESTION;

Y©s.

Is fchsr© anything in th© record to

indicata that?
MR. .ANDREWS;

No.

Th® reason this was circulated,

the petition, and so forth, it was conceded by th© respondent
that the petition was correctly circulated, that th©• amendment was
correctly made, and so th® reason why this amendment was mad®
is somewhat immaterial to this case,
QUESTION;

Then as th® eas© comes to us th® record

is silent on why thir procedure was adopted.

MR. ANDREWS;

That is correct.

17
QUESTIONS

And you suggest there is nothing in th©

record to show there is any public interest in having this
rescuing take place.

Should w© not presum® that the City

Council acted in the beat interests of th© community and there™
fore there is some public interest to b® served by this par­
ticular rezoning?
MR. ANDREWSs

That certainly is not in th® record* but

I suppose it is a presumption .

1 donst think it's —

QUESTIONS

You represent th© city and as lawyer for

the city you are describing th© City Council th© way you did
earlier, that -they ar© subservient to outside interests.
MR. ANDREWSs

No.

I am saying this* that th© City

Council is subservient to the electors.
saying

In other words, I am

th® final decision is not in th® Council, th© final

decision is in th© electors and that the electors have a
constitutional right to veto the actions of their elected
representatives if -they so desire.
QUESTION:

Mr. Andrews, I presume

if

one can assume

that tba City Council acted in th© public interest, on© can
assume that the people who voted in the referendum likewise
acted in the public interest.
MR. ANDREWS s

I certainly hope so.

As they state

in th© Valtierra case that such procedure, the referendum
procedure, show devotion to democracy and not to bias and
\
prejudice. So I hop© that we can assume that, yes.

ia
QUESTION?

Th© Valtierra ease did not involve a due

process issue,, did it?
MR, ANDREW'S:

No# they used equal protection.

But

the arguments war© the same.
QUESTION:
statement?

What is th® logical end of your last

Suppos® th© citizens adopted an am@ndm.smt to the

City Charter find say instead of 55 percent we have to have 95
percent# and then along comes a referendum on this kind of a
zoning ordinance and only 93 percent vote in favor of it.
MR. ANDREWS:

I think that would be an unreasonable

requirement and X think an unconstitutional requirement.
QUESTION:

Where would you draw th® lino# then?

MR. ANDREWS:

I don't know that th© courts have

ever really drawn that line.

I know in Ohio they have held

that 55 percent is constitutional in certain, issues.
QUESTION:

W© gave some

intimations of it in th,®

West Virginia case a couple of years ago where I think it was
either 66 or 60# there was some input that could go so high
that it might create constitutional problems.
MR. ANDREWS:

Yes.

As far as I know# no court has

ever held — and also as far as I know no court has ever held

the automatic referendum procedure or practice itself to b®
unconstitutional»
QUESTION:

X take it 'that th® zoning that results

from th® referendum, this referendum procedure# is subject to

19
the same typ® of review as if .it had simply been limited to
th© City Council.

That is, one© it has gone to referendum

doesn't mean all judicial review is foreclosed of th®
reasonableness of it.
MR. ANDREWS;

Absolutely.

You have th© same Ambler

procedural safeguards to th® final decision.
That's why 1 am saying that the way that th©
political decision is mad©,by th© people or Council, is of
no consequence, but if they make th® wrong decision, be it
Council or people, then w© go into the Ambler test and if it's
unreasonable, it's subject to judicial scrutiny on a case-bycase basis.
QUESTION;

Would unreasonableness embrace on© that

Mr. Justice Blackraun suggested, 90 or 93 percent?
MR. ANDREWS %

I would think so, almost without a

doubt.

The crucial difference in Valtierra,, and there are several
differences, the first difference is that Valtierra was

QUESTION?

Is your argument that if there had been

QUESTION:

Th® result is that you area left with

MR, GINN:

111© result is that we ar© left with

QUESTION:

How is that?

MR. GINN:

Because, your Honor* the essential issue

in the case is exactly that, the du© process issue.

will explain to the Court why.
QUESTION:

MR. GINN:

On the use of the property.

Th® vice* if you will, the shortcoming of

the Euclid mandatory referendum system — we have a traditional
referendum system, and I believe th© Court understands that —

th© point wh©r® the Council has validated th© request for the
change, has found that the request for a change is within th©
public safety, morals, and general welfare of th® community*
And at that point it is that the Eastlake mandatory zoning
procedure takes over.

My property and the right to utilize it is being

In other words* in order to have a constitutional

system for restricting my property rights under Euclidf under

Now* suppose at th© time you acquired th© property*

No* I would not* your Honor* because I

have no vested right in the zoning.

Th© zoning — this is the

24
very thing that precipitated Justice Stern's concurring opinion
in th© Supreme Court below.

The attempt to think in terms of

a constitutional zoning system as though it's a restricted
covenant running with the land, the right to change it which
is a matter of favor, it can ba granted or denied depending
upon the status of the particular litigant standing before th®
people.

We may increase th,© size of th® vote in
We may under a constitutional or a

classic zoning system provide for various procedures for
change, but th© end result, the final decision h@r@, is a
decision which in affect is a mandatory referendum decision,
it is one which is not reviewable on any of the bases which
support a due process system.

It is on® which can't be

referred to any of the standards of health, safety, or general

Under the classic zoning system, your Honor,we have

a provision for — as it prescribes it in Euclid v, Ambler Realty

MR.. GINN:

You can put your side in be for® the

people, your Honor, but let’s examine that because I think
that is ~ due process is a matter of the burdens of court
that society places on the individual.

And in the case of a

mandatory referendum, the burden is placed on the homeowner
not only of carrying the initial burden, and that is o£
going to the Planning Commission, fch© public hearing, and the
Council, and having his request for a change validated as
being within the public welfare.

Now, the individual property

owner is given an additional burden, and that additional
burden is to act in effect as the private Attorney General
for the public: officials seeking to validate their judgment
now with respect to my use of property, that is, whether or not
my us© fits the general welfare.

validity of what -th® voters did.

46

MR. GINN;

There® is, your Honor, a presumption?

QUESTION;

I would suppos© so.

MR. GINN;

Well# that# your Honor# then# is a

presumption of validity which w© cannot surmount and which w©
ought not to have placed upon us as a burden under the 14th
Amendment.
QUESTION;

No# I don't understand

if

this is an

inequitable refusal to resone in violation of the standards
set out in Ambler, why you couldn't seek review in th® Common
*

Pleas Court the same as you would have been able to do had
this simply been Council action.
MR. GINN;

Well# w® would certainly attempt that.

I think the burdens and the whole process would be different#
because we are not able to examine# as Euclid v. Ambler Realty#
as McGautha# as other decisions of this Court have said# in
order to have a due process system at the ©nd of fch© line#
judicial review must b© available in a reasonable manner which
enables th© person who has been deprived of his rights to
examine into the basis of the decision.

And we are deprived of

that under this system.
Thank you # your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
Mr. Andrews?

Do you hav® anything further#

You have only one minute left.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. MELVIN ANDREWS
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. ANDREWS;
of Mr. Justice

Very briefly, in answer to the question

-Stewart* the decision would be reviewable the

same from the Council or the people.

That typ© of case you

look at the property and determine what the restrictions are
on the property and whether the decision is mad© by Council
or the people it makes no difference.
reasonable or are they not?

Are those restrictions

That's the issue fchor®.

Secondly, I think Mr. Ginn's position is he doesn't
want the people to vote on rezoning.
And, thirdly, in respect to th® Eastlake Charter,
rezoning has always been a subject of referendum under the
Eastlake Charter, the only difference being that under the old
'

»

system, so to speak, it required a 10 percent petition of the
people in order to bring the referendum to vote, and the
substantive right to the same.
the procedure is different.

Now, the only difference is

Instead of the requirement that

th© people circulate a 10 percent petition, that is eliminated.
That's the only difference.
QUESTION:

Mr. .Andrews, let m® just get th© 55 percent

requirement clear in my mind.

Do I correctly understand that

if an individual, say, an owner of a two-flat wanted to rezone
to single-family, just a very minor 30-foot lot wanted to
change, that proparty owner would still, in order to get that

48
done have to bear the cost of a citywide referendum to get
it approved?
MR. ANDREWS!

Let's get straight on this class.

The lower court held the fact that th© cost of the referendum
should be chargeable to the applicant was unconstitutional.
We have accepted that and we have not pursued it on review?
so that is not

—

QUESTION:

Nevertheless, is it true that no matter

how small the parcel and no matter how minor th® change in
zoning, th© property owner has the burden of getting 55 percent
of the electorate to agree to that particular change?
MR. ANDREWS:

That is correct.

It was just very

recently a piece of property up th© street from this
particular property was put up to a vote of the people.
was a 9-acre parcel from industrial to business.

It

They received

a 78 percent majority vote.
Eut this is true.
QUESTION:

We drat'; th© line at rezoning, yes.

Unless you are talking about a variance.

MR. ANDREWS:

A variance is something ©Isa.

We are talking of rezoning, though.
QUESTION:

And my brother's example might b© no more

than a variance.
MR. ANDREWS:

That's right.

If it got into a

variance, that is administrative, that is not subject to a
vote.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you, gentlemen.

Th© case is submitted.

th© above-entitled matter were concluded.)
