MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 75-552* Kleppe against. Sierra Club? and 75-561,
American Electric Power against Sierra Club.
Mr. Randolph, I think you may proceed when you9 re
ready..
ORAL ARGUMENT OP A. RAYMOND RANDOLPH, JR., ESQ„#
ON BEHAL OF ELBPPE- ET AL.
MR. RANDOLPH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case, which is her© on writs of certiorari to
the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia,
arises under the National Environmental Policy Act, which I
will refer to as NEPA throughout my argument.
This provides that an environmental impact statement
shall ba included in every report or recommendation on
proposals for major federal actions significantly affecting
the environment.
The federal petitioners violated the provision I've
just quoted, according to the Respondents in this case,
because they had not prepared on© massive impact statement
covering all federal activities relating to coal raining in an
area respondents call th& Northern Great Plains Region.
That is a 90,000-square-mile area described in their complaint
as comprising northeastern Wyoming, eastern Montana, western

Nortia Dakota and western South Dakota
I*ve had distributed to the Court two maps, both of
these maps are taken from material in the record»

i don’t

plan to refer to them now* but later in my argument I will
refer to them directly»
On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district
court ruled in favor of -the government and the intervenors in
this case»
among the court’s many findings of fact at this stag®!
and on remand for supplementing the .record* two findings of
fact* we believe* are crucial and dispositive in this case»
First, that the Northern Great. Plains Region defined
by respondents is not "an entity, region or area considered
by the federal government for purposes of any federal program,
project, or action»"
Second, that there is no existing or proposed federal
regional program, plan, project, or other regional federal
action for developing coal in the region respondents have
defined,
The district court, with respect to these two
findings of fact, could not have found otherwise»

Our

evidence was to this effect in the district court and
respondente, without offering any other contrary evidence,
not only conceded that no plan or program for development
of thoir Northern Great Plains Region existed, they stressed

5
that facto
They argued to the district courts they argued to
the Court of Appeals that NEPA compelled the government to adopt
such a regional plan or proposal, an argument that, in this
Court, they now have ostensibly dropped»
I'll mention briefly a number of the other district
court03 findings of fact, and then proceed to my argumento
And these are findings taken both from the original proceeding
in the district court and from the remand»
On®, that; the government has prepared and will
continue to prepare environmental impact statements for
groups of mines or individual mines within the area described
in respondent's complaint»

These impact statements, the

court found to be, at page 114a and 115a of the Petition
Appendix -— these statements the court found to fo© comprehensive,
and noted that they assessed the cumulative impacts of coal
mining and related activities»
On® of the statements, impact statements that the
district court, considered, is the six-volume Eastern Powder
River Basin impact statement»

And for the benefit of the

Court, this isn't befor© the Court, but I brought a copy in
so the Court might see what an impact statement looks like;
all six volumes»
It covers an area in Wyoming of approximately —
I can't lift it? I would if I —

QUESTIONs

Right in front of your chair®

MR® RANDOLPHS

This covers an area in northeastern

Wyoming of approximately 7500 square miles, which is about
the sis© of the State of New Jersey, and focuses on four mining
plans and a railroad' right-of-way®
As I said; th® district court found that that state­
ment was comprehensive and assessed cumulative impacts of coal
mining®
Th© district court found; in addition,

that since

1970 the government, the federal government; in cooperation
with States, industry', private groups, other individuals,
local governments had conducted various coal related studies
in idie Western States®

These were studies only, I must empha­

size a
One of these, which was prominently mentioned in the
briefs and also in the ©pinions below, is the Northern Great
Plains Resources Program, the NGPKP, as it’s sometimes
referred to* which was begun in 1972®

This was a joint

investigation by the States of Wyoming, Montana, Nebraska,
North Dakota and South. Dakota, that collected data on geology,
minerals, including coal, and mainly coal, air quality, social

7
and economic conditions f and so forth.

And then analysed all

this material on the basis of possible development scenarios.
The study, or the program, as I should refer to it?
proposed no regional plan? it suggested no preferred develop™
ment program? it suggested no development program whatsoever.
It was not designed to? the district court so found.
The district court also found that since 1973 the
Secretary of Interior had continued in effect what was a
virtual moratorium on private coal development; new private
coal development in th© federal coal reserves throughout the
country.

During this period; a national impact statement or,

as it*s sometimes referred to, a coal programmatic was prepared.
This assessed the old procedures that the Secretary had
utilized under tee Mineral Leasing Act, and it formulated a
new process applicable nationwide for implementing that same

Act.
On the basis of this evidence, the district court
found that the government had taken action under NEPA, but
it was national action in scop®, the action was on a national
basis.
As to the region teat we're discussing in this case,
the district court found, as I stressed before, tear© was no
special plan or program for that region as such? and certainly
no regional action.
Th© Court of Appeals reversed, with one judge

8
dissenting.

The Court majority accepted -the lower court's

findings of fact, but held that ‘the government was, and I
use the Court's word, "contemplating” a regional program.
The relevance of this apparently was that under the
lower court's, Court of Appeals5 view, an impact statement
under the state NEPA must be issued well in advance of any
report on proposals for major federal action, ergo, contempla­
tion could trigger the impact statement requirement.
I must stress, though, that th© Court, of Appeals did
not hold that th© government had yet viola-bed NEPA, but only
that it would if it kept following the course that the court
-thought it was following.

And in light of this, the Court

issued a remand, order, and instructed the government to announce
whether it would do on© impact statement covering this 90,000square-roile area.
In January this Court stayed the Court of Appeals
injunction, "which had prevented th© Secretary of Interior
from talcing action with respect to the four pending mining
plans analysed in the Eastsrn Powder River Basin impact
statement.
Thereafter, in February of this year, th© Secretary
approved those four mining plans.
As I stated at the outset, w© think the district
court’s decision in this case is correct, and we think the
district court’s findings of fact and this case.

9
The government has completed a national impact
statement covering coal leasing policies nationwideu

It

includes an analysis of the four Statas here, it includes an
analysis of ©very State where federal land is located.
It5s completed this massive impact, statement covering
th® Eastern Powder River Basin in Wyoming.
not been challenged in any court.

That statement has

In fact, the statement

covers three-quarters of all th© economically recoverable
coal by strip mining in th© area that the respondents define
as the Northern Great Plains Region„
QUESTION s

Did th© government concede that it was

required by the hot to file a national impact statement?
MR® RANDOLPHS

Yes.

It was a national program, and

it was major federal action? but it was nationwide.

It's

been filed -- that's -** th© government also has issued impact
statements for individual nines, for clusters of mines, arid
in fact will continue to do so.
The argument here, however, is that none of this is
sufficient.

That an impact statement must be done for an

area smaller than the United States but larger than the
Eastern Powder River Basin, which is the size of th® State of
New Jersey, as I stated.
Even if respondents are right, that, that would be a
good idea

and we do not think it would be «— we do think

that the National Environmental Policy Act does not mandate

QUESTION :
Randolph %

May I ask you* before you proceed# Mr0

As was pointed out in another case during the

argument yesterday# the language of 102(2)(c) is a little —
it doesn't say anything about filing an impact statement., it
just says it shall "include in every recommendation or report
on proposals for legislation and other major federal actions"
— I guess the language

* recommendation or report on proposals:

for" qualifies "other major federal actions"# or maybe it
doesn't.
But what has become — sty question is :

What has the

government dona with this big impact# national impact state­
ment?
It doesn't, fils it anywhere,
MR, RANDOLPH:

No# it doesn't file it; it.

distributes it in a draft form —
QUESTION:

But th® statute doesn't require that

anything b® dona with it# except that it be -included in
every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation
and other major federal actions,"
MR, RANDOLPH:
QUESTIONs

Yes,

Well# —

It's kind of dumb language,

MR, RANDOLPH:

— what it's don©# Mr, Justice

Stewart# is published — and I will give the Court the cite#
if I can find it — in 41 Fad Rag 11035# in March of this year#

11
a series of regulations implementing the proposals and
suggestions and the formulated policy that the National Impact
Statement prepares0
Sof in other words, they did an impact statement,
they have assessed the National Coal Policy ■—
QUESTION».

Righto

MRo RANDOLPHS

—» and in 41 Federal Register they

have now published regulations which the Secretary expects to
implement, taxing the suggestions and putting into the policy
of environmental factorse
QUESTIONs

And this is then a proposal for a major-

federal action?
MR. RANDOLPHz

Xtss a real action on a proposal.

QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTIONs

Wall, if it's simply a report, what was

the proposal or major federal action which required it under
the Act?
MR. RANDOLPHS

The major federal action would be

the Secretary's adoption, which he did, I think, in the —
there5s an appendix to the green brief by the American
Electric Power Company that shows on January of this year
the Secretary adopted the new Mineral Leasing Program suggested
in the National Impact Statement.
QUESTION; And this is a report on a proposal for
major federal action?

12

MR0 RANDOLPHS

Yes,

Of course, that is not in issue

in this case at all.
QUESTION:

No* but I just was wondering.

MR. RANDOLPH:

And what is at issue in 'this case*

in fact* is whether he has to do an impact statement for the
area that respondents have described,,
QUESTION :

Right.

MIL, RANDOLPH:

In addition to the ones he's already

done o
And, as you pointed out, Mr, Justice Stewart, what
the statute says is that; a final impact statement must be
issued with each report or recommendation on proposals for
major federal action.
In this case -—
The mand* ought to be an "or*.

QUESTION:
Shouldn*t it?

KLegislation or major federal actions".
MR. RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

"Or other -major federal actions."

MR. RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

Yes, there's another source --

~~ involved in tills ease.

Yes.

MR. RANDOLPH:

The district court, as I stated,

found that a regional plan does not escist and has not been
proposed for this region that; we're talking about.
Certainly if it hasn't been proposed, there's no

13
report or recommendation on such a regional proposal for
development»

The district court so found.

The only proposals in existence her© are private
applications -that the government must act on»

The district

court found none of the privat.© applications are for regional
action»

The grant of one coal mining lease does not permit

the Secretary of 'the Interior to grant another any plac© else
in that region.
What, then, are the relevant major federal actions
in this case?
The national Coal Leasing Program we8v© discussed,
hut we5 ve clone an impact statement on that»

That leaves only

the approval of particular leases, mining plans, ric£its-of~way,
and so forth»
To be sure, these have to b© the subject of
environmental impact statements.

And they will be, if they're

not already, the subject of an environmental impact statement.
But, in the absence of a'proposal for regional action
and a report on that kind of a proposal, NEPA does not require
a regional impact statement.

Otherwise — realise what a

court is saying to the federal agencys it*s saying, "Well,
you don't have a regional development program.

But we're going

to order you to do a regional impact statement, evaluating tire
environment,sal affects of the regional action you would have
planned if you had a regional program."

14
"And, on top of that* since

SEP A. requires you to

consider alternatives * we’re going to ask you* direct you to
consider the alternatives to the regional action you don't
have planed but you would have planned if you had®"
We don’t think that makes any sense.
QUESTION:

Mr. Randolph - it is true# though# is it

not# that in a challenge to a particular impact statement#
relating to a particular mining lease# toe argument might be
made that it’s inadequate because it doesn’t sufficiently
discuss regional consequences?
MKc RANDOLPHS

QUESTIONs

Y©s, that could b@ dona.

And they might# in such a challenge#

ask for toe same thing they seem to be asking for here?
MR. RANDOLPH?

They could.

And they have.

Environmental groups have asked for that in a number of
different cases# and toe circuits around the country have
looked at toe scope of toe impact statements

Does it assess

the- cumulative effects of one more mine and one more mine?
Does it — is it comprehensive?

Doss it consider

not only the effect of this rains# but toe secondary effects?
That’s the tost.
lenged.

This statement has not been chal­

This statement does that# according to toe findings

of fact of "Sue district court on page 114a of toe petition.
So we think that the district court’s findings of
fact that there is no regional plan existing or proposed are

15
conelusivs and end this case.
That is not a very complex analysis # we admit»

But

NEPAe I think I should remind# requires impact statements for
actions# not for areas.

And we think that our analysis is a

proper analysis# as do the other circuits# including now the
Second Circuit on remand from this Court# reversing its
prior decision in the Conservation Society case»
We think that# to paraphrase Chief Justice Marshall#
we must never forget that it is a statute we are expanding
here? and if that is forgotten# if a court goes further than
that# as respondents ask this Court to do# it enters a nevernever land»
Suppose five or ten or any number of suite were
brought in regard to the area that we3 re talking about in -the
Midwest?

Soma picked a different area for study»

picked overlapping areas»
smaller»

Others larger»

Some

Others picked areas teat were
Some independent»

I submit there is absolutely no principal way for

a court, to say# after sifting through all the environmental
studies anc! statistics# that here# this is tee one area under
NEPA that you must study federal agencies»
Now# respondents have proposed a test to enable the
Court to do that»

I’ll call it tee three-adverb test# although

I’m not sure they*re all proper adverbs»

And it’s a test# I

must add# that tea district court# or the Court of Appeals

16
itself did not adopt»
Respondents say that the area they have chosen is
mandatory because all federal actions are *— and I use their
adverbs — geographically# environmentally# and programmatically
related.
This is summarized in their brief at pages 28 to 29
and then expanded upon throughout»
I'll take the least likely adverb first#
prograinrr.atics.lly —*
QUESTION.;

Geographically# programmatically ~ and

what's the third?
MR» RANDOLPH;
QUESTION;

Environmentally,

Environmental ly»

MRo RANDOLPH:
first# programmatically.

I'll take the least likely adverb
Now# X suppose what they mean by

this is that all federal, actions regarding coal development
in the area take place under the same federal program.

If

they're referring to the National Program for implementing
-biia Mineral Leasing Act# their assertion is true but
irrelevant»
One could draw a line around any piece of federal
land in the United States and make the same statement.»

It

doesn't lead to their region at all»
If they're referring to soma other program for
development of their region# their statement is in flat,, direct.

17
contradiction of the findings of fact of the district court
that there is no such program existing or proposed? a finding
of fact? as I stated? that respondents conceded.,
Nov/? they make two other statements?,

They are

geographically and environmentally related,
I think these statements? and we submit, -these
statements? are meaningless? also.
If one encircles any area within the United. States?
one can say that all the actions within that area arc;
geographically related.
It is likewise environmentally related? in the sense
that the effects on the environment from activities within the
region will be? of course? felt within the region.
Respondents5 answer to this is that our region
makes sense because? and I quote from -their brief at 104?
"it is s, geologic fact the extent of the region is defined
simply by the presence of coal,"
For this they cite their map? and I’d like to turn
to that? on page 103 of the respondente’ brief.
The shaded portion of that map at 103? respondents
tell us? represents? and they say? the Fort Union and Powder
River coal formations? and that is the extent of the region.
But. we submit that map is highly misleading? and
certainly inaccurate.
In the first place? it omits all the coal fields in

18

the States that they have dealt with here, and Is11 get to
that in a moment»
But first I5d like -to talk about the geologic
fact»
QUESTIONs Was the map in evidence in the district
court?
MR® RANDOLPH?

Well* there was a. map that was

contained in the back pocket of the Northern Great Plains
Resources Program that was a geologic ma.p®

They referenced

that map on the righthand corner of page 103 and sav they
have drawn this from that map®
And that's whet I'm just about to discuss* Mr»
Justice Relinquish.
First of all* they talk about the Fort Union and
Powder River coal formations„

In fact* what this map shows

is the surface exposure only of a portion of the Fort union
rock formation.

There is no such thing as a Powder River

rock formation, and* in fact* to be precise, there’s not
such thing as a coal formation at all.
What there is — the phrase is sometimes used, I
admit? but what in fact you have are coal seams in rock
formations.

So* to get this straight* they have drawn here

the surfaces exposure of the portion of on© rock formation,
the Fort Union rock formation»
Now, what they have left out, even in respect to

19

i

■this, is 'the fact that the Fort Union rock formation goes on
for miles arid miles and miles beyond this area they've drawn.
In fact* —
QUESTIONz Nell, I suspect you could go a long way
before you find nine people ‘that knew less about the Fort
Union rock formation —
[Laughter, ]
QUESTION:

than the ones you're arguing too

We can!t resolve this as a question of fact,
certainly.
MR. RANDOLPH:

I will make that point.

QUESTION:

Okay„

QUESTION:

It's been made.

[Laughter, ]
MR. RANDOLPH:

But to sum this up as far as their

map is concerned, they've left out about 100,000 miles of
'the. Fort Union rock formation• There is coal in the Fort Union
rock formation, and I'll give the Court the pages:

pages

218 to 220 in the regional impact statement reports coal in
the Fort Union rock formation as far south as the Colorado»
Utah border that runs into — I think it runs into Idaho.
It's the Green River coal field.
Anyway, there are .about 100,000 miles off if they're
drawing fchfi Fort Union rock formation.
QUESTION:

Mr. Randolph- I had the impression from

20

the Court of Appeals opinion that they didn't contrive this
area, though, that they found this area in a lot of work that
had been done by the government in one way or another»

Isn’t,

there some basis for that?
MR. RANDOLPHS
geologic map,

That's righto

They found this in. a

But I think they —

QUESTION s Well, thenf you attribute the arbitrary
selection to them or to the government?
MR® RANDOLPH?

No,,

They have, in fact, tried to

-- they have another line around this — tried to duplicate
the Northern Great Plains Resources Program Study area, but
they left out the State of Nebraskar which that also studied,
and that, study considered various different areas throughout
the different States for different programs,
It didn't propose anything, it was a development
program.

The reason, we admit —
QUESTION3

differently.

Well, let me put the question a little

Are you saying that the area they described is

one that they defined initially, without any reference to
prior government tentative proposals or tentative planning
or anything like that?
MR. RANDOLPH?

The precise area that they define

is their area, yes.
The area, just the miles, square miles covered by
the Northern Great Plains Resources Program is 140,000 square

21
miles i theirs is about. 90,000 square mi las *
It takes in part of tie area that -this program
studied»
Now, right before we break, I'd like to refer to
our map and the yellow portion»

The underlay on this map

is what we understand to be their region, if they had drawn
the coal field rather than the rock formation, which is not
— so they don't correspond»
But the underlay is what w© understand to be their
region»

They say:

The extent of our region is defined by

the presence of coal»
The overlay is the presence of coal, and I don't
think one has to -- and there are other coal fields, they
look like a botched Rohrschach inkblot test, but. there are
other coal fields throughout the area

I don't think one

has to be versed in Euclidean geometry to see that on that
map any number, countless numbers of lines could be drawn
around countless numbers of areas»
Now, if it's simply the presence of coal that
defines the region, where does one draw the line?

This map

is a little mis leading, too, because that's a macro*-view,
and if the Court gets the impression that all 'that coal is
minable, it's a wrong impression, that I'll dispel after lunch»
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We*11 resume there at

[1:00 pda»]

MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Mr* Randolph, you may

pick up where you left off*
ORAL ARGUMENT OF A» RAYMOND RANDOLPH, JR., ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF KLEPPE, ET AL*
MR, RANDOLPH?

- Resumed

Mr,. Chief Justice, may it please the

Courts
I was about to say that the foldovsr map we have is
a kind of a macro-view, a not very well focused satellite
picture of coal fields»
The other map we have, however, is a very focused
picture of the surface minable coal deposits in the area
generally represented, I think, by respondents* complaint,
When one looks at this map, and the blackened areas
are the areas of the surface minable coal ~~
QUESTIONj

Now, which map are we talking about now?

MR, RANDOLPH:

The photographic reduction of the

very large map.
Now, the blackened areas are the economically
recoverable coal.

In the portion on the yellow map that is

represented by the underlay — this map that I'm referring to
now shows the economically recoverable coal there.
Our point about this is that when one does focus
down even more sharply into this area, where does one draw the

23
line?
Now, I would suggest.* just on a look at this map,
that on® logical place to draw a line around is in the lower
part of -fell® map, in the series of mines that runs north to
south, with the numbers 7, 1, 2, 10, 3, 3, 4»

If the Court

sees that?
QUESTION:

Yes„

*

MR. RANDOLPH;

The lower portion, of the rasp- on

•the left-hand side, toward the west, there’s a series of mines
with numbers by them, 7, 1, 2, 10, 8, 3, 4.
the Secretary of Interior drew his line.

That’s where

He encompassed that

area with a 50-mil©~wide slot that runs 150 miles north and
south.
That’s the Eastern Powder River Basin.

It’s called

that because it's to the east of the Powder River, and it
lies in the shallower formation.

As I said, not all the

coal in this area is in the Port Union rock formationi much
of the coal there is in what they call the Wasatch formation.
But, again, my point in all this, and the conclusion
from all these reaps is that the kind of geological mistakes
I’ve been talking about, we think are inevitable, unless

*

unless, in the absence of a regional plan for development,
it i:? left to the Secretary of the Interior, who has fee
expertise in geology, who has the expertise in environmental
considerations, who has the expertise in administering his own

24
program, thus it's left to him to define the appropriate areas
for study in his administration of the Mineral Leasing Act„
QUESTION:

Mr* Randolphf —

MR» RANDOLPH s
QUESTION:

Yes?

— up in the lefthand corner, these

proposed mines, have impact statements bean put on those?
MR» RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

MR» RANDOLPHS
QUESTION;

Yes»

I would —

One of them is in your area, isn't it?

Ones of them is in the Powder —
MR. RANDOLPH;

Yes, there are two ether mines, for

which individual impact statements are prepared for them»»
And also, I might add for the Court, there are two
other clusters of mines on this map? one in the upper righthand portion of the map and «another in the middle portion of
the map.
Regional impact statements in considering all those
mines are going to be prepared, the Secretary of Interior
announced to Congress, the Senate committee, about two months
i

ago»
But, again, ray point in all -this is that — in the
absence of a regional plan, the definition of the area to be
covered has to he left to the Secretary»
i-.,:--

.h

It's in his

25
I think one of the curiosities of this case is that
respondents rely upon a case called Udali v, Taiwan, which,
as the Court remembers, is a case that says:

in regard to the

interpretation of a statute by an official who administers
that statute, it's entitled to great weight.
Th© statute in that case was the Mineral Leasing Act.
QUESTION; Right.
MR. RANDOLPH;

Th© official who administered it was

the Secretary of Interior.
QUESTION;

What if the Secretary simply decides to

make a study of, say, a region of four or five

Western

States, without recommending or proposing any legislation or
any major federal action? does that have to be accompanied,
in your view, by an impact statement?
Ml. RANDOLPH;

Absolutely not.

Such studies, Mr.

Justice Relinquish, are underway all the tine, continuously.
Th® very existence for the Bureau of .Land Management, the
very reason for the existence of the Bureau of Land Management,
of course, is to manage the federal lands, and they are
constantly studying the resources and so on and so forth.
Th© Bureau of Mines is not really a regulatory
agency, ifc*s really a research agency.

And they conduct

studies all the time.
Various areas are constantly being studied.

I think

all th© federal land, at one point or another, is under constant

26

analysis end study, for coal mines, for various things0

So

we don’t think that that would require an impact statement»
I think the result of that would be that, it would deter the
governmental agencies from studying the material»
4

Now, suppose everything I’ve told to the Court, at
least in the argument portion so far, suppos® I’m mistaken?
Suppose I’m wrong?
Suppose the Court of Appeals accurately detected
that a regional development plan is in fact contemplated,
and that, it just so happens that this regional plan the
government is supposedly pondering corresponds, it just happens
to correspond with the region that respondents have identified?
Nevertheless, we submit the government still prevails
in this case»
The fact is NEPA does not say, or even imply, that
an impact statement must be done on contemplatione.

NEPA does

not say that an impact statement must be don® when that
contemplation somehow mystically rises to the level of a
proposal»
What the statute does say, and Mr» Justice Stewart
pointed this out earlier in ray argument, it says -that an
impact statement must he done, included in a report on the
proposal»
And SCRAP II, this Court’s decision in SCRAP II,
said and held the statute means what it says»

I quote from

27
the opinion:

The time at which an agency must prepare -the

final statement is the time at which it makes a recommendation
or report on a proposal for federal action.
Even under the Court of Appeals opinion, which said
the only thing that exists her© is some contemplation, that
time has not arrived.

And we submit it may never arrivee

As a matter of fact, we go further, we said, we would submit,
it will never arrive»
The court below, we think, therefore, should have
affirmed»

In the absence of, and violation of NEPA, and

the court below found none, it was improper for that court
to continue the injunction which prevented the Secretary of
Interior from taking actions that have already been fully
analyzed in what the district court found to be a comprehensive
impact statement that assesses the cumulative consequences
of coal mining»

That is, the statement for the Eastern

Powder River Basin»
I’d like to reserve the balance of my time, Mr®
Chief J ustics.
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

very well»

Mr» Mendicino.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF V« FRANK MENDICINO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF WYOMING AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. MENDICINO:
please the Court:

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it

28

1' am here today on behalf of the State of Wyoming
and 21 other amici States , because we have a lot at stakef we
think, in the decision that this Court reaches in this case<>
We believe that NEPA contemplates a major State
role in the implementation of the Act,

We know from experi­

ence that the impact of federal programs on our States are
tremendous.,

And we believe that program environmental impact

statements are truly the only means that we have of determining
the scop© and the magnitude erf these federal programs»
We think that Interior, the Department of the Interior,
would defeat those objectives by preparing environmental impact
statements under NEPA on a project-by-project basis; and
that’s our understanding of the real issue in this case»
Now, let me tell you a little bit about the Wyoming
experience and what’s happening on the ground in my State»
At last count we had no fewer than 134 coal leases,
pending applications or prospecting permits in the Eastern
Powder River Basin»
Projections for the next few years in the northeastern
part of our State call for 34 strip mines, nine electric
power and coal gasification plants, 225 miles of new power
lines, and 150 miles of new railroad tracks»
”■ a respectfully submit that it*s ridiculous to think
that a series of environmental impact statements on each one
of those particular projects, all of which require,either

23
directly or indirectly, federal action before they can corns
into fruition.

We think it®3 ridiculous to think that a

series of environmental impact statements on those projects
will analyze what*s going to happen to our State, in the earns
way that an. environmental impact statement, taking «all of
■them into consideration in determining the cumulative effect
of all of those projects., would have.
QUESTIONs

Mr„ Attorney General, your neighboring

State of Utah has not joined yon in your brief, has it?
MR. MENDICXNG ;
QUESTIONj

No, sir0

As a matter of fact, it’s filed a brief

MRo MENDICINOz
QUESTION:

Yes. air? it has.

Is that because their experience is

somewhat different -then yours?
MR» MENDICINOs

I believe that one of the reasons

— and I really can't — I really perhaps can't answer that.
I think that they had a facility which has since gone by the
board, Your Honor, that may have played a part in their
decision not to join in the brief.

That's really the only

reason that I can give you for that.
After this litigation was initiated, there has bsen
or have been indications that the Department will now agree
to prepare sub-regional impact statements«
We suggest that that*s not. a great deal better, at

30

least in the way that w© understand they intend to do it,
on a project-by-project basis*
Let rm use as an example of this# Sheridan County,
Wyoming,.

There are few —
QUESTION:

•the language of the

Mr» Attorney General, what do you do with
statute?

Where has there been a regional

federal proposal?
MRo MENDICINO:

We don’t know, Your Honor»

Vie think

that they should know*
QUESTIONS Well, I knew, but if they say there isn’t,
MRo MENDICINO;
QUESTION?.

We believe very strongly

The only time you submit an impact

statement is when the federal government makes a report on a
proposalo

And there hasn’t been a report on a proposal on a

regional basis»
MR» MENDICING?

Your Honor, we would differ with

that,
QUESTION: Well, where is it?

That's what I asked

you» Where is the report?
MR» MENDXCINQ:

What we are saying in this case, Your

Honor., is that in the Department of Interior -they do in fact
have plans for an area larger in scope than a project-byproject basis, or even larger than the Eastern Powder River
Basin»
Ws don’t know where it is, but we do know, as a

31

matter of fact, as most people do in this country, that we
face an energy crisis.

Wa do know that we have enormous

untapped natural resources in our State , and we do know that
the projects which I have suggested in
QUESTION: Well, how would you suggest the eas® go
forward, have a lawsuit and call the people from the Interior
Department and ask them if they have a proposal or a plan,
or what?
MRo MENDICINO:

I think the first ‘thing that has to

be done is the result of the decision in this Court? is that
a determination be made as to the scop© of environmental
impact statement»

If you agree that NEPA calls for an

environmental impact statement on a project-by-project basis
only, then I think that obviously you would necessarily decide
that our argument is incorrect, in terms of the language of
the statute«
QUESTION: Well, don’t you think before — under the
statute, wouldn’t you have to find that -there was a proposal
somewhere for a regional plan?
MRo MENDICINOs

Yes, sir, I certainly do»

I don’t,

think we've gotten to that point yet„
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but until you find that,

isn't the requirement for an impact statement limited to the
project that's been proposed?
MRo MENDICINO:

Not if there is a plan*

They have

32
taken the position, as I understand the issue — now, I can't
honestly say that I got this understanding from ray brother's
argument; but as I understand the basic issue in the case,
it is whether or not a project environmental impact statement
is sufficient»
If you agree that —
QUESTION: Well, wouldn't it be sufficient if all they
have in mind, or that's the only proposal that ever has been
made is for a project?
MR®MENDICING :
made®

If the only proposal that they have

But we say that the facts and the pronouncements from

•the Department clearly demonstrate that their plan goes ranch
further than that®

The leases that I .have mentioned to you

point- that out®
QUESTION:

Well, I gather, as far as the statute

is concerned, at least if you just limit consideration to
the words on their face, before they trigger an impact
statement there; has to be a recommendation or a report on
something®

And it goes on to say, something, "on proposals

for legislation and other major federal actions"®
But unless we can say that something, or a court,
can say that something constitutes a. recommendation or a
report on one of those idlings, that the statute doesn't call
for an impact statement®
QUESTION:

In other words, what is the major federal

33

action that you rely on?
MR. MENDIC1N0? Well# I've got to confess# Your
Honor# -chat I*ve got to rely on Mr, Terris for that* —
QUESTIONS Well# wasn't the —
MR. MENDICINO;
QUESTIONS

— portion of the argument.

— wasn't the finding of the district

court quite to the contrary?

That there was no -- that the

only proposal there was was a project proposal?
MR. MENDICINO?

Yes

,

that was the finding.

QUESTION; Well# did the Court of Appeals set that
aside and find it was erroneous?
MR. MENDICINO;

The way that I read — contrary

again to ray brother's interpretation

the way that I read

that is that the Court of Appeals sent that back to determine
whether or not there was a program that was larger in scop©
than the project, the specific project.
QUESTIONS

Thank you.

MR. MENDICINO;

That's, I think, extremely important.

I started to mention Sheridan County, and I think
you could note this on the map.

There's very little develop­

ment anticipated in that county.
QUESTIONs

Where is that one?

MR. MEN DICING s

That is in the northern part of the

State? Your Honor.
QUESTION;

Oh# I see it.

That's left here of the —-

34

is it ~~ yes.
QUESTION;

On tills map, left of the Powder River

Valley?
MRo MENDICINOl
QUESTIONi

It°s the —

Yes»

MR, MENDICINQ:

It3 s the area there with the three

small coal deposits that are shown on the left»
QUESTION: The area where 5 and 6 are»
MR» MENDICINO:

Right.

The projections for the increase in the population
in that county are only nine porcent by 1981»

However, there

are extensive developments taking place south, in Johnson
County, Wyoming, in North and Big Horn County, Montana.
If you take the anticipated development with the
accompanying population increases - the projections for those
two counties, in addition to Sheridan County, the projections
are -that there will be a population increase in Sheridan
County alone of over 40 percent by 3.981»
And I think the implications of that, in tanas of
the need end demand for public services, are obvious.

And

that points; out why we believe that the environmental impact
statement has to take into consideration more, than a single
project.
Now, as stated in the amicus brief, I repeat here,
we have not taken a position as 22 States on what that

35
geographical area should b€i0

We do feel, however? that it must

be broader? and that, the Act calls for it to be broader

That's quits correct, Your Honor.

Now, the question in this case, really the root

Can

Yes, we would have to do an environmental

impact statement on the region if v?e did planning? but. since
we're not going to do any planning, w© are excused from it.
In other words, the argument is?

The less we do

zander NEPA, the less NEPA requires us to do.
Now, NEPA three separate times talks about federal
planning.

Is it conceivable that the Congress of the United

Statas said that if you are controlling development and you're
issuing leases and doing all these things, that simply because
you won't plan, that you don't have to do any regional
analysis?

are mentioned in finding 14 are both -regional studies on
this region»
QUESTION': Well* the first one- is on a national
basis * and the second one is Southeastern Montana and
Northeastern Wyoming, which is different from the region you
describ©»
MR® TERRIS:
QUESTION:

Your Honor* I want to —
And the third is a national coal leasing

policy* and then the fourth is the Indian lands in the NGPRP»
But there’s quite a group of different things — is this your
strongest finding in support of your position that there5s a
regional program?
MR» TERRIS:

Well* let me be clear* Your Honor®

I do not believe that the Department of the Interior has sat
down and said:

Here is our program for development in -she

Northern Great Plains»
I do not believe that’s happened»
they're planning»

I don’t believe

The question* Your Honor* is when they do

all these different tilings * and they attempt to control

49

development, I think th© finding is vary clear that that is
what they’re doing.

And, by the way, that finding, Your Honor,

is based — let me just go to the underlying facts on which
that finding was based.
Secretary Morton*s affidavit says that the
Department has taken action to control development of coal
on a national basis and in the Northern Great Plains.
Now, that5s what that finding is based on.

There

are some other facts, too, that support that.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Terris, is it your position that the

action that has been taken, I think you’ve characterised it
as a study and in other ways, focuses precisely on the same
regional area that you ar® recommending?
MR. TERRISs

Your Honor, there really are two

issues in this case, and they are really sub issues.
The first, issue is?
statement at all?

Do you have to do a regional

Is there any requirement in NEPA that

require you to do anything more than look at the specific
strip mine which is in front of you?
That, I submit, to Your Honors, —
QUESTION:

Well, that would suggest the answer to

that would have to be yes if, in fact, the Interior came up
with a proposal for legislation or other major federal action
on a regional basis.

Then of course 'mere would have to bs

regional impact statement.

MRo TERRIS e

No, but I*ra saying, Your HOnor, let

m©
QUESTION; Are you saying they did do that, that's
what the finding says?
MR® 'PERRISs

I'm saying that they both had a

regional proposal and they had so many individual proposals
that they have to foe even separate from the first proposition?
they have to be analyzed regionally®
Let me go back to Justice Powell's point; because it
seems to ass it isolates the two basic questions here®
One is;

Do you ever have to look beyond the specific

topic the government is considering at that moment?
That's the first issue, and I regard ‘that as the
basic issue®
The second is is;
you do soars times have to®

If the answer to that is yes,
Then what should the si z® of the

regions be her®?
QUESTION; Well, the statute itself may require you
to look beyond the particular project, as on© of Justice
Stevens' questions this morning indicated, that can be done
in an individual project statement®

It may have to talk

about other tilings than just the immediate consequences of
•chat, project®
MR® TERRIS;

Your Honor, that is correct, and if the

government's position had aver been that what they propose to

51
do was in the context of an individual project, to look at
"the entire interrelationship in a region , there would not have
been any litigation.,

The government®s position from the

start, and it still is today, that they do not have to look
beyond the specific projecte
QUESTIONS Well, why can*t

you can challenge that

if you disagree with it when they file an impact statement
•that everybody concedes is required for a specific project®
And you can say it*s not broad enough®
MR® TERRISs

We could, Your Honor, and there is a

procedural question which was argued in the courts below,
which has not, bean, argued in this Court, as to whether,
proce dural ly, the way we should have proceeded, instead of
coming in and isolating this basic question which cuts across
•the board, or whether we should have literally brought
separat», lawsuits against every single environmental impact
statement, ’which is inadequate, because it does not look at
the whole region®
Now, that. Your Honor, I don't think is a basic
question, except in terras of judicial economy®

I think if we

had ever brought one lawsuit after another of that kind,
it would have been thought that that was a very improper way
for ub to proceed®
But I •— that is not the basic issue®

I quite agree,

if Your Honors believe that the way for us to proceed in the

52
future is to attack each statement separately, then# of
course, we will do so.

But I think the basic question in

front of us isn't that procedural one, but whether when the
government makes clear that its position is that they are
not required by NEPA to do regional statements, that in that
context they do not have to look beyond ~QUESTIONs

Mr» Terris, who is better qualified to

draw the lines of the region in this area, the Interior
Department or this Court?
MR* TERRISs

The Interior Department, Your Honor*

And the Interior Department is —
QUESTIONs Well,wait a minute»

Aren't you asking

us to do that?
MR» TERRIS s

Mo»

Let me be very clear about that»

The line we want is the Department of Interior's line»
QUESTION: And what is that?
MR* TERRIS s

And let me go back to the map that

was given to you, because —
QUESTION:

Wall, I understand that their line is

the Powder Basin, that's their line»
MR. TERRIS 8
QUESTION:
MR* TERRISj

No *

Let me go bade --

Isn't that what they say?
Well, let me *•— Your Honor, they do

in on© sens®, but 1st me go back to the map, which was
distributed to you*

53

If you will look on the lefthand side, under
Explanationr it is said there is a line which says, Outline
of the northern Great Plains Coal Field»
Now, it’s a very faint line in the map, but you will
see it winding around, and teat line is the identical line
which is in our map in the brief, which is the Northern Great
Plains Resource Program Study area, the area teat they have
chosen to control development»

The 1975 water study of tee

Interior Department.; statements by Secretary Morton that
you had to do a. study of this area in order to control and
coordinate development;; statements by tee Administrator of
EPA that this was the right area; statements by the Council
on Environmental Quality that this was the right area»
QUESTION;

They are all studies; no proposal yet»

MR» TERRIS;

Your Honor, I’m going to a different

question, I believe, when I go to this.
QUESTION:
MR. TERRIS;

Gh.

Okay.

I'm going to the question if you

assume that we have met the statute, that there are proposals,
then I’m going to the question;

What is tee right area for

analysis?
And what I'm saying to Your Honors is I agree
completely that the Department of Interior has considerable
discretion in determining what is the proper region»
What I am suggesting to Your Honors is that they have

54
repeatedly# ever and over and over again# saids

the right

region for environmental analysis under NEPA is the identical
region which we have argued there should be a regional
analysis„
Now e that isn* t a coincidence that we came to the
same area»

The reason we came to it is because these are

geological facts»

Th© government has submitted a brief

showing that there is lots of other coal in the United States»
That's true»

But they are not in the same geological

formation# and the Department of the Interior made the
decision that the right area# th© right geological formation
was this one»
How# I want to go back to Justice Powell’s question#
because I do net believe that is really the fundamenta],
question in this case»

I want to explain that»

If this is tii© right region# let's make an assumption
right now that the sub regions — and I think that's the way
Interior describes them — that the sub regions are correcto
QUESTION %

That's what I wanted to ask you»

We'v©

been talking about project-by-project# but really ar© we not
talking about the differences between one over-all region and
five sub regions?
MR» TERRIS:

Your Honor# that leads me# I think#

to the basic point»
QUESTION:

Let me just ask on® question about ih at.

55

Doss the record tell us whether -the five sub~regional impact
statements are all prepared in the same office under the same
supervision, or are they working entirely autonomously?
MR» TERRIS $

I believe. Your Honor , they tend, to be

sub-divided, at least in the start, to different regional
offices, in different offices of the Bureau of Land Management
and other

federal agencies that are in the field.
In other words,
QUESTION %

Would it satisfy your purpose if we had

•the five 3ub~regional statements and then -they bound them
all together in one great huge volume, with a long introduc­
tion, sort of talking about the things that overlap among
■them?
I mean, there's no harm in having the five sub­
regional statements, I guess?
MR0 TERRIS;

No<,

No, Your Honor.

Let me just —

let me explain the ramifications of what we're now dealing
with.
And this goes back to Justice Brennan's earlier
question.

Everybody believes, Your Honor, that you have to

look beyond the individual project..

I don't -think there's

■any dispute about that.
This statement, this sub-regional statement, makes
the same assumptions that we do? namely, you can't look at a
mine by itself, you have to take, a region.

Now, they've taken

56

a much smaller region, but they have taken a region»

And

we’v® cited in our brief at great length how one federal
agency after another, EPA, CEQ, Interior, all the other line
agencies that deal with this problem, have all agreed that
you cannot look at individual statements by themselves»
Now, the government — we sot out, by the way, at
great length in our brief, how Secretary Kleppe has
essentially agreed with our position»

On January 26, he stated

that he had made a determination — it’s in the appendix to
our brief, the documents —- he had made a determination that
indeed you die have to do regional statements»
QUESTION;

Where does he make that statement?

MR» TERRIS;
QUESTION:

Where?

It*s in —

I don't mean where in the brief, but

what was -tie forum?
MR» TERRIS;

The forum was, Your Honor, that

when he makes final decisions, at least on big issues, he
has what's called a program decision option
QUESTION;

*

Well, was it a press conference or —

MR» TERRIS;
conference, Your Honor»

It was announced through a press
The document that's in the back is

not a press release, it is the actual decision document that
ha signed»
■ Ha had a press conference, and he released it to
the press»

But we are not relying on simply a press release.

57
Now, he then told the Senate Committee the same
tiling a few weeks later, that he had decided to do sub*-regional
statements*

He has done one*

Two are. about to be started,

in North Dakota and Southeastern Montana*

Two others are

under consideration in a priority list;.*
Now, at least we believe that he has made the
determination, which we have argued for from the beginning,
QUESTION:
MR» TERRIS;

Well, v/e can dismiss the case as moot*
No, Your Honor, I think -there’s one

more issue to decide, and I do not think it is the basic
issue, although I think the government, by the way, will
dispute that it’s moot, even on the point I've just been
making»
They want to say that the Secretary has started
this process out of the goodness of his heart, NEPA did not
require that he do this, and he

that means he presumably

could change his mind at any time»
QUESTION:

Well, isn’t it the Secretary of Interior

in the whole management program to be doing tills and before
NEPA was ever on the books?
MR» TERRIS:

Well, Your Honor, they didn't do it,

though, however, before NEPA was on the books, and that's
of course why he
QUESTION:

Well, we've had litigation for the last

twenty years showing that they've been doing this with — not

58

only with coal# but timber and a great many other -things*
MR, TERRIS s

You mean -these kind of environmental

analyses?
QUESTIONs

Not an impact statements because the

word wasn't invented? but making that kind, of studyf and
keeping their studi.es going currently,,
MR® TERRISs
very strongly*

Your Honor, with all respect# I disagree

I think that the history of NEPA shows how

little indeed they did of this kind of thing before 1970# and
that what NEPA, has dons has started really a major revolution
in the way that federal agencies proceed in terms of the
environment®

And 1 think -this is a constructive step along

that line®
I would just point out that even if -this document
on the Eastern Powder River- Basin is adequate# and Your
■r>

Honors say that -that is the right region, I would remind you
that there have been no such statements on any other part of
the region# that at least four-fifths of tee region has not
been analysed at all9 and teat that is what they are just
beginning to do*
QUESTION: Ws don't have tc pass on that# do we?
t:IRo TERRIS;

Ho# not only do you not have to, I

thinkt Your Honor# it would be improper to®
QUESTION:
we read it

I hop© you*«e not even suggesting that.

59
[Laughter* 'j
MR® TERRIS %
QUESTIONt
MR» TERRIS:

I ata not, Your Honor®
Thank you®
I remind you that I did not bring this

pile of documents in front of you,» Your Honor®
I do not think it is relevant* except for the fact
that I think what is relevant is that the Department of the
Interior has decided that, yes, indeed, it does do regional,»—
suh~regional statements®

But 'that it does not intend to do

regional statements, and I think the major issue you have in
front of you that is left, the major issue of dispute is the
question:

whether we are correct in taking Interior's own

lines and saying, yes, indeed, that is the right area®
Because I do not think we have a major dispute with Interior
on the question of whether sub**regional or regional statements
*

have to h@ done®
I do think we have a dispute with the Department of
Justice, to be very frank about it*
QUESTION:

But if the government is right that the

Secretary has clone this out of the goodness of his heart,
and the law doesn*t require him to do it, then you*re not
entitled to any judicial relief in the way of an injunction,
I presume®
MR® TERRIS:
QUESTION:

That's quite true®
That tire Court of Appeals was wrong in

60
issuing the injunction»
MRo TERRISs

That is correct-, Your Honor, and that's

why. I think that it is not moot in any kind of —
QUESTION: So even if we agree with all that you
say, that the injunction issued by -the Court of Appeals should
be dissolved?
MR„ TERRISz

Oh, Bot,

No, no, Your Honor»

QUESTION s Well * I thought that's what you said»
MR0 TERRISs

No, let m© fos clear about it*

I rely on Interior's new-found policy of doing
sub-regional statements, as confirming our view, and that
of EPA and CEQ, that regional analysis is required by NEPA»
In other words, I think that is the —
QUESTION:
MR» TERRIS:

But; they say that is not the case»
Your Honor, the Department of Justice

says that is not the case*
QUESTION: Well, the Department of Justice represents
the United States in all litigation before this Court*
MR» TERRIS:

That's quite correct, Your Honor»

But Secretary Kleppe said, in his program decision option
document, I think it's very clear if you look at it, that he
was — that NEPA required these actions»

And I think it is

very clear that that's what the Secretary was doing*
QUESTION:

And that's sort of an administrative

interpretation of the statute, to which w© should give

61

deference?
MR» TERRIS s
deference to that.

Yes f sir.

I think you should give

X think, even more, though, Your Honor,

X think the proper interpreter of NEPA, th® one that Congress
and the President have both charged with interpreting NEPA,
happens to be EPA and CEQ.
Now, I do — I think that Interior is entitled -to
some deference, too.

Here I think there is a coincidence which

has occurred, in which all three agencies have found that
regional analysis is required by the Act»
QUESTIONS

Now, which are you saying that they say?

That a regional —
MR» TERRISs

Sub™regional would be more accurate»

i
questions

'«“• a sub™regional statement ia required

because a sub-regional statement is th® natural requirement
of a project proposal?
MR. TERRIS s
QUESTIONS

No.
Or are you saying that th® Department of

Interior has said they have a sub-regional proposal?
MR. TERRISs
Your Honor.

I'm not sure what Interior thinks,

Let me say that —

QUESTION % Well, you”*re certainly relying on
Secretary Kleppe's decision.

Now, did ha say they have a

regional proposal, or that, for some reason or another, they3re
going to do e. sub-regional statement?

52
MR. TERRISz

I think it's more accurata to say that

NEPA *•«- that in order to carry out our NEPA responsibilities,
we’re going to do a sub-regional statement,,
QUESTION: Well* do you —- then do you agree with
this statement in the Court of Appeals:

We hold that

comprehensive measure federal action is contemplated in
•the Northern Great Plains* and therefore

what?

Do you 'think that that is enough* that some major
federal action is contemplated?
MRo TERRIS:

No* but I want to be clear that the

Court ©f Appeals did not think it was enough.

The Court of

Appeals expressly stated —
QUESTION: Well* it went on from there -- it went, on
from there to say that tee district court’s contrary
conclusion was in error*
And than went on to order further proceedings
based on teat statement.
MR. TERRIS:

Yes, Your Honor. But it did not

say that a contemplated action was enough.
the contrary.

It expressly said

It said* although it thought teat action was

contemplated* it was going to remand the case to the district
court in order to determine whether the federal role — in
other words* the district court was going to determine what
kinds of actions really were going to foe taken.
QUESTION: Well* tee district court found teat there

63
wasn’t any proposal, any regional proposal»
MR. TERRISs

It didn’t use, I don’t, believe, Your

Honor, those words.

It said there was no plan or program.

QUESTIONS Well, at the time the Court of Appeals
acted, the Court of Appeals seemed to concede there wasn’t —that they agreed that there wasn't any plan or proposal.
They just said something is contemplated.
MR. TERRISs

Your Honor, but it said that that’s

all they could find now, that it was contemplated.

Therefor®,

it was not making a determination —
QUESTION;

Well, how could they ever say, then, that

up till that: very moment an impact statement was required?
MR. TERRISs
QUESTION;

It didn’t.

The holding is not —

Then why shouldn’t they have affirmed?

MR. TERRIS;

Because, Your Honor, they thought

that the issue was unclear on the role of the federal
government —
QUESTION;

Well, -they were clear enough that it

was only contemplated.
MR. TERRIS;
contemplated.

At that point. Your Honor, it was

I think, by the way, that’s a very conservative

view of the facts before the Court of Appeals.
But taking that conservative view, the Court of
Appeals then said;

We're remanding to the district court to

determine what the role of the federal government actually

64
would be»

Now* that’s directly consistent,, I submit* with

SCRAP* that you send it back to the district court to debarmine whether the federal government was really going to take
these kinds of actions.
QUESTION?

Is it fair to say* Mr. Terris* that

what the Court of Appeals did was to take a whole series of
relatively minor actions of the federal government*
accumulated them* and said that taking them all together
■this amounts to major federal action?
MRo TERRISs

In part* you're right* Your Honor?

but I think not completely.
QUESTION?

I think the fact —

Well* didn’t fehay say almost. --

did Judge Wright say almost exactly that?
MRo TERRIS?

Well* there's on© of — I would have

to change at least on© part of that statement»

That ©ach

individual part were not small actions* each one of them is
actually a huge action* each one of those actions * for
example* has — and the government* I think* concades this -that, each one of those is a major federal action under NEPA»
So what the Court of Appeals was saying* in a
situation — and the Court* by the way* expressly cam® down
on this language about controlling development»

Where you

are controlling development* you have dozens or hundreds of
actions* where now it turns out the federal government itself
admits they have to do regional analysis»

That in that kind

65

of situation you have to look at the entire region»
QUESTION s

And I —

18 ve found this language that. I was

trying to paraphrase„

Judge Wright said;

The question is

whether the cumulative effect of various federal actions all
individually minor;, put together constitute major federal
action*
Now, he is acknowledging that these were each
minor*
MR* TERRIS s
was clearly wrong*

Your Honor, all I can say is that he

And I think he was clearly wrong, Your

Honor, on the proposition that I think the federal government
will agree with me, because they are each individually,
Your Honor, actions in which they admit -they have to do
environmental impact statements*
The mines we’re talking about *»- just so that we
understand what we’re talking about here, each one of these,
each mine is among the largest mines in the United States»
It has •*“ each one of the mines has several square miles of
area*

It is doubtful, according to the federal government

itself, that these lands will be reclaimed for dozens of
years, and probably maybe not forever»
We’re talking about power plants and coal gasifica­
tion plants of the sise that are among the largest in the
country*
QUESTIONs

Mr* Terris, there’s one thing you haven’t

66
really addressed*

You said there should be on© over-all

regional statement instead of five sub-regional oq©3 ? why?
MR* TERRISs

Well* Your Honor — let ms come back*

because I think I — to the statute* because obviously that's
what we're talking about*
One® w© decide? we've got a proposal or an action*
that triggers the environmental impact, statement requirement*
and I've argued at length about why I think -that there is
such a proposal and action* in fact there ar© many of them*
And that; they arcs tied together by controlling development*
Now* then* the question — the question* after
you decide that is s

What should be the scope of the

anvironmenfcal s tatement?
Now* I submit that the way you determine that is
to look to the five factors in 102(2)(cl*

You look to what

area, you have to examine in order to determine the
environmental impact and the alternatives to the project*
In other words* it's a practical question that one is
dealing with at; that point*
And CEQ has said the way you look at that* giving
a gloss on that* is whether there’s an interrelationship*
the three adverbs that
U3 *

icome from CEQj they don't come from

.

QUESTION:
and programmatically?

Is that environmentally* geographically

67
MRo TERRIS s
CEQ e

That is right,,

Now, those com© from

They are gloss an how do you look at those five

factors and analyse them, when you have interrelationships
between projects?
Now, we say you have to look at the whole area,
but I would not make that argument to Your Honors simply on
a logical basis0

I think it is true logically, we’ve argued

at length in cur brief that it is logically true? but our
basic proposition is they decided that you had to look to
the whole region to analy ze those five factors <>
You will see in our brief that SPA said you had to
do that, Secretary Morton said you had to do -that, fee
Northern Great Plains Resource Program said you had to do
feat —
QUESTION;

Let me ask a question — I know the

red light’s on, so I’ll b© very brief„

But is it not

correct feat in order for us to say five sub-regions are not
adequate, you need one over-all region, w© must conclude
that the Secretary is arbitrary in determining that five are
adequate?

Isn’t that the standard to use?
MRo TERRIS;

I think feat’s correct, Your Honor»

I think you only get to that proposition after you first
decide whether regional analysis has to be don© at all?
then you get to feat proposition»

And I think fee question

is whether he was arbitrary in fee light of his own and other

68

federal agencies5 prior decisions and actions0
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi
Mr. Shea.

Very well, Mr. Terris.

Whenever you’re ready.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS M. SHEA, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN BOTH CASES
MR. SHEA %

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Courts
First I would like to ask the Court to look at that
finding 14 again.
QUESTIONS

Page 30, isnet it?

MR. SHEAs

That3s on page 90a, yes, in the

Petition for Cert.
The Department of 'the Interior has taken action
to control development on a national basis, and they have*,
with their programmatic on a national basis, and their
leasing policy on a national basis.
That covers the whole nation, including th©
Northern Great Plains.
It says a number of other 'things, but what this is
talking about, as you get down to 'th© and, those actions,
however, are not part of a plan or program to develop or
encouragement development or it attempts to control develop­
ment by individual companies in a manner consistent with the
policies and procedures of th® National Environmental Policy

69
Act.,
3: don#t see how -tills can be relied on for the
proposition that the federal government and carrier has
undertaken to control development of the region.

Except as

they8 re controlling development pursuant to a leasing program
which applies to the whole nation,
QUESTION:

Is it possible*. Mr, Shea*, that even

having completed,, which they have hot dons apparently, even
having completed the study of the whole area, and concluded
that the development of th© coal resources was in th® public
interest and should proceed, that they might then, with
respect to particular mines on particular arsas, say that
that was an interference with tbs environment which was not
tolerable, and that; that particular project would not go
forward?

Is that possible?
MR* SHEA:

Wall, of course, if the Court please,

Thera has been no change of position on the part of Interior,
Th© initial affidavit which was put in by Secretary Morton
set out and we've completed this coal programmatic, and we
have th® information from the Northern Great Plains Resources
Program.

We® 11 decide possibly we'll have an. impact state-

raent for the whole region, but possibly the purposes of NEPA
will be better served by preparing an impact statement on an
individual project or on certain sub-regions, or on th®
basis of basin boundaries, eh cetera.

70
And this is exactly what Secretary Kleppe is -saying
today o
Now, indeed it,ss so, of course, these studies are
going on all the time, and what they finally decide on is
what project they will

what major federal action they will

decide^ to carry forward*
Now, I would like

to ask the Court, if it will, to

return to the statute, and to SCRAP XI, which it seems to m®
says that the statute mcjans what it says»
And I would like to suggest to idle Court that there
is a very different question presented on what is ~ what
Interior is compelled to do, what they must do under the
statute, and what they find it wise to do.
Now, they may find it wise to prepare particular
regional statements, rather than the statement on a particular
projecto
Incidentally, I think all the Secretary has said
he*s going fee. do is to, he thinks, prepare a couple of more
regional statements, I believe in response to question put.
to him,/
But that distinction, it seems to me, has to be
kept in mind, which I think your question posed and suggested,
and I would like to — I'm not sure that these matters are
not well in mind, from the questions to© Court has put —
but looking to 102(2)(C), this is what is compulsory and all

71
that is compulsory?

that there be included in every

re commendati bn or report; on proposals for

major federal

actions significantly affecting the quality of the human
environment»

And what i.s to be included?

The environmental impact of tie proposed action0
Any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided
should the proposal be implemented»
Alternatives to the proposed action»
Any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of
resources which would be involved in the proposed action
should it b@ implemented»
Now, if the Court please, in SCRAP II, if I under­
stood correctly its holding, its teaching, the Court said
that if we want to determine what kind of an impact
statement is to be prepared, we must first define accurately
what the proposed major federal action is»
And secondly, that in circumstances such as existed
there, «aid as exist here, where the proposals were by private
companies, that the recommendation of the proposal for major
federal actionis the approval of those applications? or,
in SCRAP II, the failure to suspend»
But the approval of 'those actions»
How,gentlemen, X suggest that it is impossible
to read 102(2) (C) — 1 shan't say impossible, but it seams- to
be very difficult to read 102(2)

(c)

*— as .relating to some-

72
thing other than a specific proposal0
leases«

The approval of mining

But how you can read this as saying that it covers

prior action, that it covers applications which are pending,

on which there® s no commitment, to approve? can you read the
environmental impact of the proposed action as saying the
environmental impact of ail prior actions and all applica-»
tions for leases, and for rights-of-way, ion mining plans?
Can you say that any irreversible and irretrievable
commitment of resources which would be involved in the
proposed action, that you can read into that all the actions
which have been taken in the way of leases and mining plans,
-at cetera?

And all those applications which are pending,

that there’s no commitment to approve, which may or may not
be approved?
I suggest to the Court that it is not to be so
re ad»
Mow, to be sura, as Mr0 Jus-tic© Rehnquist suggested,
and I think Mr, Justice Stevens suggested it, when there is
indeed the recommendation of a proposal of a particular
raining plan, for instance, where that9s approved, it must
deal with the situation in which it is approved»

If this

adds further impact on the environment that breaks the camel9s
back, well, of course you've got to look at what the
circumstances are, what the cumulative effect of it is»
And if it's claimed that that impact statement is inadequate,

73
it can be claimed that it's inadequate because it doesn't
give consideration to the. cumulative effects»
But, may I say again» that this doesn't mean that
the Secretary is under obligation»

Ha may do it because it

is the wise course, it is the most desirable way of managing»
But this is quit© different from saying that he's under
obligation to prepare a regional impact statement»
Now, h@ would be under an obligation to prepare a
regional impact statement if that constituted — if a plan
had been -«* if h© had a plan which involved the entire region,
that he was carrying it into effect»

Except, as you know,

the decisions of 'the Courts of Appeals have hold that even
where you have such a thing as the two phases of the Tetons
or where you have the Central Utah project, if part —
authorised by the Congress —~ if part of that has independent
utility, a single impact statement on that part of the
independent utility which does not commit you to go forward
and finish the entire project,, can be supported by an
impact statement which is limited to ‘that part»
Now, therefore, I would submit, Your Honors

and

I did have the feeling feat this was brought out in the
course of -the questions

that you have got to find a

proposal, and the proposal has not, so far as I could hoar,
been brought to your attention by opposing counsel»
Nor by the court below

74
1 n.ean5- what h@ talked about., the court below said
was all of these prior approvals, ail of these things in
being, all of the applications which are pending, and the
studies which have been made, that these indicate that
Interior is contemplating controlling*
QUESTION?

Mr* Shea, before you leave that point,

Judge MacKinnon, in his dissent, made th© point that the
commitment of th© granting of approval in on© area does not
necessarily involve & commitment to grant approval in other
areaso
In other words, he took the position that these
five regions, or perhaps even th© individual projects, are
not sufficiently interdepontent to require any one over-all
statement*
Your opponent argues that we need on® statement far
the entire area*

What I“d like you to tell me is whether we

need to decide that issue or not*
Do you understand my question?
Do we have to agree with Judge MacKinnon on tie
point that the entire area is not interdependent in order
to agree with his ultimate conclusion?
MR* SHEAs

Well, I’m not sure that I really fully

understand your question*

The findings of the district

court is that there is no planned program or other major
federal action*

Indeed —

75
QUESTION s

And tliat is the end of 'die case?

MRo SHEA:

Yes o And this was conceded

QUESTION 2

Well, we. do not have ~~

MR3 SHEA?

~ by opposing counsel.

QUESTION;

If we agree to that, then we don't

MRo SHEA:

I don't se© what's lefty and I don't

have to ~~*

see how that has gotten around*
QUESTION: Welly Mr0 Shea, it may be that — it
may be that if one project necessarily determines the shape
or form or outcome of another, that having a plan for this
project necessarily means you have a plan for the other one?

MRo SHEA:

If they are integrated, sira

QUESTION: Well, that's exactly the questi.on„
MRo SHEA:
QUESTION:

Is that the question?
Well, it seemed to me -«* I'm not too

clear„
QUESTION:

The question is:

Do we have to decide

whether or not they are integrated?

MRo SHEA:

Well, I think that

QUESTION:

As I understand it, your answer is no0

MR0 SHEA:
QUESTION;

you know, this

In the first place, -~
Yens say no, but Judge MacKinnon

apparently thought he had to decide this, if he wanted to —
MRo SHEA»:

In the first place, you know, there is

76

a finding that so far as these proposals of the private
companies are concerned# that they are not being constructed
or carried out pursuant to any integrated plan* tod also
that the plan that — these projects of the individual
companys are not integrated or interrelated*
Mow# if I may try to gat at it — because I don*t
chink Ifv® bean responsive*

That's finding 31*

If I may try to gat at it in this way# if the
Court please»
It seems to rm that unless you can find a proposal
— unless you can find a proposal# there is no basis for
acquiring an impact statement»

And the way they sought to

get « proposal was to sny that; all of this is interrelated»
1 don't think they have ~~ you know# it would be dependent
upon what the interrelation was»

The fact that it's

interrelated doesn’t make it a single project*
It seems to me that the tests which have been
made by the Courts of Appeals are the proper tests*

That is#

if you go forward with this particular proposal# can you —
are you committed to something greater?

Or does it have

independent utility?
Mow# it seemed to vm that I thought what Judge
MacKinnon was saying was -that there isn't any kind of such
interrelation as they're talking about*
QUESTIONj Wall# there isn't necessarily*

77
MKo SHEAs

Righto

QUESTION s

It's possible, but not necessarily so„

MR® SHEAs

Wall, really not -- on 90,000 square

miles, it isn't even possible,,
QUESTION s Well, possible that some of them near
to each other -«
MR® SHEAs

Ohc

Rut that's a very different matter®

That's a very different matter®
It might be that, as Mr® Justice White suggested,
it might, be that you have a particular proposal which, if
you carry it out, you're committed to carrying out something
more®
QUESTIONS

On the ©tear hand, even if a series of

projects were wholly unrelated, if the Interior Department
actually had a plan for the development, or a proposal for­
th© whole area, there would have to be an area impact
statement?
MR® SHEA?

That raises, I think, a somewhat

di f fi cul. t qaes tion 0
QUESTIONS
MR® SHEAs

I mean a proposal —
I would be dubious about -that, because

does that plan —*
QUESTIONs

What if they mad® a proposal?

MR® SHEAs

If they had such a plan, would that —

remember, it isn't just that there must b® a proposal for

78
major federal action, but it must significantly affect 'the
©nvironment0
So that you would have to find not only that it
was a proposal for major federal action, but that it
significantly affected the environment»
QUESTIONs But at least it would be something that
wasn51 there before, if you had a proposal?
MR» SHEAs

Well, yes„

QUESTIONS For an area»
MR» SHEAs

But w@ don't have that, obviously»

This would raise — you know, I can't just
QUESTION % Well, the Court of Appeals is against
you on that»
MR» SHEAs

On what?

QUESTIONz

They say that apparently they think the

possibility is a must, that the Interior Department has
gone far enough along the line towards a proposal to trigger
the need for an. «—
MRo SHEAs

What they say is that all the actions

that have taken place in the past, and all of toe pending
applications which may or may not be approved, that this,
in our view, said the Court, constitutes major federal action,
and thus, it goes on to say, thus -«» I don't know how it
follows
QUESTIONs

Well, it all adds up tos

for the

79

purposes of the statute, a proposal — whether you call it a
program, a plan or, I think the language was, nothing at all.

I

MR0 SHEAs

Yes, that’s right»

And then it goes on to say that thus

but all it

held was that there’s contemplation, that they contemplate
controlling

it’s the next, the very next sentence, Mr.

Justice White, they contemplate controlling the development
of the regiono
Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I see that I have a rad
light in front, of me.
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Your time is up»

Thank you, gentlemen„
The case is submitted.
