MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Wo. 74-676, W. J. Estelle, Director, Texas Department
of Corrections against Harry Lee Williams.
Mr. Sullivan, you may proceed, whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DUNKLIN SULLIVAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. SULLIVAN:

Mr. Chief Justice

and may it

Please the Court:
I am the Assistant Attorney General from Texas
and I represent Petitioner in this case, W. J. Estelle, the
Director of the Texas Department of Corrections.
We are here on this case on a petition for writ
of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit.
The question involved in this case is whether a
defendant's trial and jail clothing is so inherently pre­
judicial that it destroys his presumption of innocence and
therefore denies him a fair trial.
The Respondent in this case, Harry Lae Williams,
was convicted by a jury of assault with intent to murder
with malice in November of 1970, Houston, and was assessed
by the trial judge as punishment to confinement for 10 years
in the Texas Department of Corrections.

The Coart of Criminal Appeals c£ Texas affirmed
this conviction on direct appeal.

The Federal District Court

below then held an evidentiary hearing in the federal
habeas corpus case and denied the respondent relief, holding
that while trial and jail clothing was inherently pre­
judicial, that evidence of his guilt was so overwhelming
that trial and jail clothing was harmless error.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit reversed this holding and affirming again that

trial

and jail clothes is inherently prejudicial but they found that
harmless error was not available in this particular set of
circumstances»
And although the Fifth Circuit had held in the
Hernandez case in 1971 for the first time specifically saying
that trial and jail clothing was inherently prejudicial, in
the Williams case they held for the first time that the
decision would be given retroactive application.
Our contention is that the United States
Constitution, while it guarantees a fair trial, does not
guarantee a perfect trial and we contend that trying a man
in jail clothing is not so fundamentally unfair to destroy
the presumption of innocence and deny a man a fair trial.
A juror is aware

most jurors are -- -that

defendants are arrested and they are kept iri jail prior to
and that
trial/ when a defendant is brought into the courtroom in

5
jail clothing,, that the jurors are not so surprised or
shocked.
QUESTION:

Do you have bail in Texas?

MR, SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

Yea, you.r Honor, we do,

Well, you said that they assumed that

everybody that comes there has been staying in jail»
Isn't that what you said?
MR,. SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir»

You didn't mean that, did you?

MR. SULLIVAN:

Well, I mean the ones that are not

able to be released on bail would foa brought in in jail
clothes„
QUESTION:

Those that don’t have enough money to

buy clothes.
MR. SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

And have to wear the jail clothes.

MR. SULLIVAN;
QUESTION:

Or — yes, sir.

And have to wear the ja.il clothes.

Those are the ones you are talking

about.
MR. SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Mr. Sullivan, what kind of jail

clothes would they wear, the old striped ones?
MR. SULLIVAN:
striped.

No, your Honor, they weren’t

Most of the ones were, I think, described — it

was a white T-shirt, and it had Harris County Jail stencilled

6

across the back and a pair of pants that had Harris County
Jail maybe stencilled down one side of the pants.

No striped

clothes.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll resume there

after lunch, Counsel.
[Whereupon, a recess was taken for luncheon
from 12:00 o'clock noon to 1:02 o'clock p.m.]

AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Sullivan, you may

resume your argument.
MR. SULLIVAN:

Thank you,, your Honor.

I believe the last thing we talked about was
Judge Blackmun had asked about the attire of the defendants
who were brought into the courtroom and I would like to say
that they didr-'fc have on the striped uniform with the little
old striped hat.
It was ;a pair of white overalls in most cases
with Harris County Jail stencilled across the back of the
uniform and sometimes down the leg of one or either both
pair [of the legs of] the trousers he had on.
I would also like to point out to the

Court that

there were none of these defendants, as far as I can determine,
that were compelled to go to trial in the jail clothes they
had on.

7
Tha reason they were tried was because the
attorney raised no objection

to the trial judge ashing that

they be tried in the other type clothing than the clothes
they had on and it is our position that being tried in jail
clothing is not any more prejudicial to a defendant than
reading to a jury the indictment or under —- reading to a
jury

prior convictions alleged in the indictment for

enhancement under the state habitual criminal statutes,,
QUESTIONS

Mr. Sullivan, did Judge Love give any

instructions about prison garb to the jury at all?
MR. SULLIVAN; No, sir, he didn't.
However the
voir dire of the whole
prosecuting attorney on tha/ jury panel did so speak or ask
any of the jurors if the fact that the defendant was in jail
clothing would have any kind of effect on them and none of
the jurors voiced an objection and the defense attorney did
the same thing.
He said that the fact that this man sitting over
here with the jail clothes on, does that have any effect on
you?

And, again, none of the jurors objected.
QUESTION;

Do you know whether Mr. Williams had

any personal clothes that were taken from him at the -time of
his incarceration?
MR. SULLIVAN;
the federal habeas here.

Yes, sir, he says that he did in
He said that he had the clothes on

that he was arrested in and he had asked

somebody at the

8
rehabilitation center, told them that he wanted to have
these clothes when he went to the state court for trial.
QUESTION:

Is it

your position that personal

clothes might be more offensive in the eyes of the jury than
prison garb?

Might be?

MR. SULLIVAN:
honest.

No, sir, it really isn’t, to be

I just don't think that it makes that much of an

impression,

tad we have cited some testimony here from

jurors in a federal habeas hearing in which they responded
that they really didn't remember what type of clothing the
defendant had on and it just didn't make that much of an
impression on them.
QUESTION:

One of the courts below commented that

it was the preference of some defense attorneys to have their
clients tried in prison clothes, that it would give the
impression he had already served some time so why give him
a lot more, in affect.
MR. SULLIVAN:

Yes, sir, that is exactly correct

and of course, in this case, you could almost say that the
defense counsel, when he asked the prospective jurors if it
would be okay with them, if it wouldn't harm their, in any way,
that he consented to having his man tried in these prison
clothes.
And there is a Fifth Circuit case where the
defense attorney did testify that he wanted his man tried in

9

jail garb because he thought it would make a sympathetic
impression on the jury so
QUESTION;

As I understand the Fifth Circuit has

explicitly cut out an exception from their so-called "per se"
rule for that situation,
MR, SULLIVAN ;

Isn't that correct?
Yes, sir, that's correct, if you

can get an attorney to testify that he wanted his man tried
in jail clothes because he thought it would

make the jury

be in sympathy and that is an exception,
QUESTION;

Well, I suppose after this decision

of the Fifth Circuit, in any case, where there was not. a
request

that ha be tried in civilian clothes, that you

would assume that, he and his counsel were satisfied or even
preferred that he be tried in jail attire.

Isn't that

correct?
MR. SULLIVAN;

Yes, sir, and that is the thing

that bothers me about the Fifth Circuit's holding jin this
case, they've nor — in the Hernandas case, when we filed our
motion for rehearing, they said that the defendant! has got
to make an objection.

He has got to make the trial judge
?

aware that he doesn't want to be tried in jail clothes and
then they started sort of undercutting that decision and now
they say, well, in Harris County everybody was tried in jail
clothes and so the fact that the lawyer, you know, didn't
object does not waiver that right because the lawyers

10-11
testified — a lot of them did — that they didn't think
there would be any use in objecting because everybody was
being tried and objection would be denied.

There wouldn't

be substantial objection,
}

QUESTION;

In other words, it is your position

that if the defendant asks

to be tried in civilian clothes

that he is entitled to it?
MR. SULLIVAN;

Yes, sir, I think that that would

be the best thing as far as
QUESTION;

But how about the Constitution?

Assuming he requests to be tried in his street clothes, in
his civilian clothes, and is turned down and he is convicted,
would his conviction stand under your view of the Constitu­
tion?
MR. SULLIVAN;

Under my view, then, I’d think

that he would have to show that he was harmed, substantially
harmed by the being so tried.
QUESTION;

Oh, so you wouldn’t have a per se

ruling in that situation?
You wouldn’t presume any harm?
MR. SULLIVAN;

No, sir, unless he was able to

specifically show harm,
QUESTION;

When you answered Justice White's

question about a request to be tried in street clothes, do
you mean a request to the trial judge?

12
MR» SULLIVAN:

Yes, sir, to the trial judge

because in habeas hearings, of course, the petitioner will
say I asked somebody at the rehabilitation center in the
hold-over tank and, of course, he can?t remember who it was
and it is pretty hard fco find out who he was talking about»
It puts the state in a hard position to rebut his
testimony.
QUESTION?

Well, even if he is perfectly accurate

in his testimony, I suppose asking somebody at the
rehabilitation center isn't the same thing as calling it to
the attention of the judge- who is responsible for conducting
the trial.
MR, SULLIVANs

Yes, your Honor, that is ray

position that it should, be brought to the attention of the
trial judge.

In fact, in this very case here we have a

certificate from the trial judge and he stated that if he
had. been asked or requested for Williams to be tried in
civilian clothes, he would have allowed that request.
QUESTION;

How does the prisoner prove he was

harmed by being tried in prison garb?
MR. SIJLLIVAN:

Well, your Honor, I think in one

of the Tenth Circuit cases they proved he was harmed when
the prosecutor kept referring to his as "the man sitting over
here with the jail clothes on just like all the rest of them,"
and they seemed to infer from that that the jury might —

13
QUESTION:
ial misconduct.

Well, that sounds to me like prosecutor

How, otherwise, does he prove it?

If no one says anything about i.t and there he sits
and he is convicted, how do we know if the jury considered
this?
MR, SULLIVAN;

Well, perhaps by the length of the

term of the sentence he got, maybe.
There was an Oklahoma case where the maximum
punishment was seven years and the objected he was tried in
jail clothes.

He got a five-year sentence,

QUESTION:

But was that a jury-sentencing

arrangement?
MR, SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, I believe so,

That is, in your state it is the jury

sentence that doss it?
MR, SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

Sir?

In your state, Texas, the jury imposes,

fixes the sentence, does it?
MR. SULLIVAN:

Yes, sir, but in this particular

case the trial judge set it, in the Williams case.

The

defendant has the choice, either the jury can assess the
punishment or else the trial judge can.
In this case he elected to have the trial judge
assess the punishment.
years.

The trial judge assessed him 10

The maximum was 25 years.

14
QUESTIONS

Mr. Sullivan, why does Texas try them

in jury clothes?
MR. SULLIVANs

In

well, your Honor, we haven®t

tried them since the Hernandez decision in '71.

Up until that

time the only reason I have is that they just never — it
never occurred to them that it was inherently unfair.
QUESTION:

It used to be the fashion to do it

this way.
MR. SULLIVAN:

Yes, sir, in Harris County and some

of the other counties that had large numbers of defendants,
I suppose because a lot of the defendants when they were
arrested, maybe the clothes they had on were — that they
didn't think would make a very good impression and they
thought perhaps they looked better to the jury and the overalls
were starched and ~
QUESTION:

This is why I asked you before as to

whether it might not be possible to be less offensive for
the defendant to be in issued garments rather than in his
own,

One can imagine that certain types of dress would not

be very welcome in Harris County or any other county,
I am trying — what I am trying to get at is,
what the interest

of the state is in trying a man in prison

clothes,
MR. SULLIVAN:

Well, your Honor, I really don't

think — like I said, it was the state, you know, having much

15
you know, it hadn't formed much of an impression one way
or another but they just assumed that it was okay unless the
defendant raised an objection to it»
New, if he objected to the trial judge, they
would allow him to get some civilian clothing from somewhere.
If he didn't object they assumed that it was okay,
QUESTION;

Well, is the state's real interest here

or is it part of the state's interest to prevent this
decision from being applied to everyone who has ever been
tried in Texas and he is still in jail?
MR* SULLIVAN:

No, sir, our main interest is in

keeping it from being applied retroactively.
QUESTION;

Well, that is what I mean*

MR. SULLIVAN!
QUESTION:

Right,

When was this tried?

MR. SULLIVAN :

The Ml Hi mas case was tried in

1970»
QUESTION;

1970?

MR* SULLIVAN:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

tod this was applied retroactively,

then?
MR. SULLIVAN;
QUESTION?

Yes, sir,

And this was — you mean, it was

applied retroactively in the sense that the Fifth Circuit
had already decided the case of Hernandez?

16
MR. SULLIVAN:

No, sir, Hernandez didn't say if

it was retroactive.
QUESTION :

Was this the first case?

MR. SULLIVAN:

No, sir, Hernandez was the first

case.
QUESTION:

Well, was this the first case that

announced this particular rule?
MR. SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

Of retroactivity?

Well, you think this is a retroactivity

case, is it?
MR. SULLIVAN:
Williams case,

Yes, that's what they say in the

They say that we hold that now it is going to

be applied retroactively.
QUESTION:

To everyone who has ever been tried.

MR. SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

Right.

Whc is still in jail.

MR. SULLIVAN:

Yes, sir.

And, of course, our

concern is, if it is given retroactive application, we. have
got, you know, all the people in the penitentiary that were
I
convicted on the recidivist statutes. If they can just
allege and knock out one prior conviction because of being
tried in jail clothes, they will be entitled to -be released.
QUESTION:

Why do you say Williams is being

applied retroactively?
MR, SULLIVAN:

Because the Fifth Circuit held it

17
was .
QUESTION:

I knew, but why?

That «ay be what the

Fifth Circuit said, but in this case is it applied retro­
actively?
MR* SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

Well, yes, 1' suppose so because —

Isn't this the first case that ewr

announced this particular rule?
MR, SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

Uh ~

Mr. Sullivan, if this circuit in

Brooks against Tessas, as I recall, said trial in prison
garb is inherently unfair, that is in 1967.
MR,, SULLIVAN:
QUESTION?

Hernandea was in 1971.

MR. SULLIVAN:
QUESTION?
So that in 1970

Yes, sir.

Right.

And the trial of Williams was in 1970.

CA-5 by dictum had held or had said that

trial in prison garb was inherently unfair.

That is the

sequence, isn't it?
MR,, SULLIVAN:

That is in the Brooks case you

are talking about?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. SULLIVAN;

Yes.

They had said that, of course.

The Brooks case, of course was disposed of mainly because of
the ineffective assistance of an attorney in that case and
they did say that trial in prison clothes — garb is

18

inherently unfair but that was just at the conclusion of a
lot of other things that the attorney didn’t do»
In fact, there was a federal judge in Houston that
in 1970, some three years after the Brooks decision
decided, you know, that the Brooks decision really didn’t
stand for that proposition and he said it was all .right to
try a defendant in jail clothing.

It was not inherently

prejudicial so —
QUESTION:

Well, isn’t Williams, though, the first

case that said that a conviction in prison clothes cannot
be upheld even though the defendant did not request being
tried in civilian clothes?
MR. SULLIVANS

Yes, sir, I suppose.

Of course, in the Hernandez case the defense
attorney made no objection either.

He testified at the

federal habeas hearing that he did object because he felt
that it would be — that everybody wan being tried and that
he felt it would be a useless objection and when Hernandez
went up the Fifth Circuit, you know, reversed that, saying
that for the first time that a trial in prison clothes is
inherently prejudicial and —
QUESTION t

So this case, Williams didn't go any

farther than prior cases had gone?
MR, SULLIVAN:

Except for specifically holding

that it was retroactive because, see, we had argued before

19
that it wasn't and there was another Fifth Circuit, case,
Goodspeed, I believe, in which one judge said he thought it
ought to be applied retroactively but the other two said, well,
we are not presented with that yet»

We are not going to make

that determination,
But in the Williams case they definitely said it
was retroactive so ~~ and of course, it is for this reason
that, although we don't think i£ is inherently prejudicial,
we haven't tried anybody in jail clothes since Hernandez in
'71 and we would ask this Court to hold that this Williams
case should not be applied retrospectively,
QUESTION:

In any event, not any trial before

Hernandez.
MR. SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

In '71.

1971.

So any trials before 1971.

MR. SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And Hernandez was decided when?

MR. SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

He mande a.

Yes,

your Honor.

You are also asking us to hold that it

isn’t constitutional infirmity to try a person in prison
garb, aren61 you?
MR. SULLIVAN:

Yes, sir, that is true,

But, of

course, I recognize there is a possibility of unfairness

20
here and you

know, trying to be fair to the defendant and

the state, I suppose if there is a possibility that a
defendant might suffer some collateral effects, sc if this
Court would hold that ~ you know, don't do it any more, well,
we would have no quarrel "with that but especially not to
hold it retroactive»
QUESTION:

Is this the trial judge who, when some

prisoner objected, loaned his

the judge loaned him a suit

of his own clothes?
MR, SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

To be tried in.

MR. SULLIVAN;

Yes, sir and there is a case on the

books in the Court of Criminal Appeals of another tx'ial judge
that did the same thing.
have any clothes to ’wear.

The defendant, you know, didn't
His attorney objected and the judge

went back and had an old suit of clothes he lent the
appellant himself.
The final thing I’d like to say is as to why I
don't particularly feel it is inherently prejudicial is that
there are some real fine attorneys in the Harris County Bar
Association and there was never — there were

very few

objections made by any of those lawyers to defendants being
tried in this jail clothing and I argue that the reason they
didn’t object was because they just attached no significance
tc it.

They just didn’t think it made that much difference

21
and it is hard for me to believe that an attorney who really
thinks a client is going to be denied a fair trial by being
tried in jail clothes would just stand by and not make an
objection because he thought it would be denied because, of
course, you never know until you make an objection if it
will be denied or not.
QUESTION;

Mr. Sullivan, in Texas do state judges

wear robes?
MR. SULLIVAN:
QUESTION;

Did they in 1970?

MR. SULLIVAN;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir,

Yes, sir.

If they had not, do you think it would

make a difference in the fairness of the trial?
At one time they did not.

Am I not correct on

that?
MR. SULLIVAN;
not.

Yea, sir, at one time they did

I don't know exactly the year they started, started

wearing robes„
QUESTION;

Bo I understand that Texas or at least

Harris County changed its way of doing things after the
Hernandez decision in 1971?
MR. SULLIVAN:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir, that is correct.

So now, since 1971, even without a

request from the defendant, civilian clothes are provided?
MR. SULLIVAN;

Yes, sir, they are provided.

I

22

think the only way you can get tried in jail clothes now is_
to say, "I want to he tried in jail clothes.'''
QUESTION:

And that has been true since 1971.

MR. SULLIVAN:

Since 1971, since the Hernandez

decision.
QUESTION:

Is that true throughout Texas or only

in Harris County?
MR. SULLIVAN:
your Honor.

1 think throughout the state,

It is, you know, since Hernandez has come down

we don't do it. any more.
QUESTION:

And before Hernandez, was this problem

peculiar to Harris County or was it general throughout. Texas?
MR. SULLIVAN:

It was mainly Harris County.

There

vmre some out of Tarrant County, where Fort Worth is and
Dallas County had some

the larger counties mainly.

There

were a couple from some of the smaller counties.
QUESTION:

From what?

MR. SULLIVAN:

From some of the other smaller

counties in the state but not a whole lot.
QUESTION:

Umn hmn, mostly from —-

MR. SULLIVAN:

Mostly from Harris County, your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Houston is Harris County.

MR. SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

So it has been changed throughout the

23

States since 1971.
MR. SULLIVAN %
QUESTION s
in civilian clothes.

Yes, sir, since Hernandez.

So now routinely defendants are tried
The only way they would be tried in

jail clothes would be if they may an affirmative request.
MR. SULLIVAN:

Yes, sir, that is my understanding.

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr, Sullivan.

Mr, Aderholt.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BEN L. ADERHOLT, ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. ADERHOLT:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Let me respond first to some of the questions
that were presented to Mr. Sullivan and then I will present on
the rest oaf, the argument.
The identity of jail clothes in Texas, I agree
with Mr. Sullivan, is as he has described it.

I would add

that the penitentiary garb and the jail garb, I believe the
testimony shows is the same — the same white coveralls,
possibly with a different lettering on the garment showing
whether it is the jail or the Department of Corrections.
In additition to that, the defendant is brought in
in shower thongs,
QUESTION:

In what?

MR. ADERHOLT:

Shower thongs, where the feet

24
slip through a kind of a crow’s foot.
The defendants were all triad.
QUESTION:

Would you state again what that is

called?
MR. ADERHOLT:

Shower thongs [ha pronounces it

"shower tongs"] is what 1 call

them and what I. believe the

defendant called them in the habeas corpus hearings -QUESTION j

Shower thongs„

MR. ADERHOLT:

—* where his feet — sandals, where

his feet are bare and slips one of the tongs ----QUESTION:

Thongs.

MR, ADERHOLT:
QUESTION:

•— through his toes.

Oh, yes.

MR, ADERHOLT:

This was in November, a cold month.,

and I think this would have been something that the jury
would have immediately seen.
Second -QUESTION:

Well, what if they had seen it?

What

is unfair about it?
MR. ADERHOLT:

I think it carries with it all

kinds of negative inferences.

The same could then --- the

defendant, could come in in a Rabbi’s clothing or a surgeon's
whites rather than the prison whites.
jury

I think that the

makes shorthand assessment of the defendant,

especially in this case where the defendant did not take the

25
stand„
QUESTIONs

But they know he has been indicted,

It is probably no secret to most jurors that criminal
defendants who can’t make bail spend time in jail between
the time of their arraignment and trial.

But what does

this add to that?
MR, ADERHOLT;

I am not sure that the jury,

Mr. Justice Relinquish, knows or should know whether the
defendant cannot make bail.
QUESTION:

Well, how would it prejudice the jury

in determining the issues in these criminal offenses with
which he is charged to know that he had not been able to
make bail —■ or to know that he had bean able to make bail?
MR. ADERHOLTs

I think precisely because we are

not able to measure what the jury thinks of a man who comes
in dressed like this — in addition to that, I
QUESTIONs

Now, wait a minute,

You say, because

we don’t know, therefore we decided it is unconstitutional.
I would have thought that the rule was just the
* *

opposite, that there is a presumption of constitutionality
and if you don’t know, that is the reason for saying there
is no constitutional infiment.
MR. ADERHOLT:

One of the lower courts stated that

the prosecutor could not have gotten admissible prior
conviction for other charges brought against the defendant.

26

He also stated

that the jury might have inferred

or probably did infer from the appearance of the defendant
that he had other charges pending or was a convicted criminal
and was too dangerous to release»
QUESTION:

Well, why would it be any sort of a

permissible inference on the jury’s part that he had prior
convictions, from seeing him in prison garb?
MR. ADERHOLT:
his chest and

Because he has "Jail" printed on

because he is not a free man.

He is brought

in by the Sheriff and he —
QUESTION;

But he is in the custody of the Sheriff

during the trial whether he has got prison garb on or not,
isn’t he?
MR. ADERHOLT:

But he doesn't have a choice of

putting on clothes that would make him look like an ordinary
average defendant that has the presumption of dignity and
the self-respect of a free man,
QUESTION;

What if his counsel has consented on

the record to being tried in jail clothing because he wants
to be tried in jail clothing?

Is the judge then required to

explain to the jury that you must draw no inferences from
this because the defendant affirmatively wishes to be tried
in jail clothing?
That would seem to follow from your colloquy with
Justice Rehnquist.

27
MR. ADERHOLT:

In view of the long line of cases,

I think that a trial judge might consider

something in his

charge just to protect the integrity of the trial.
On the other hand, I believe that the Fifth
Circuit in Garcia, which carved out this exception of where
it is used as a trial tactic to gain sympathy from the jury
QUESTION:

Well, what do you suggest that the

jury infers when there has bean a trial in jail clothing
by request if nothing is explained to them?
Don9t they draw the same inferences that they
would in any other case?
MR, ADERHOLT:

If I understand your question and

statement correctly,. Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that they
would draw the sansa inference.
QUESTION:

That is just as harmful or just as

beneficial — depending on the point of view — as in the
case where he has not consented, is it not?
MR,, ADERHOLT:
beneficial thing.

I would never consider it to be a

Some lawyers may believe that it would be

beneficial to gain sympathy because he had been in jail and
couldn't get out to prepare his defense, that he had been
incarcerated long enough for this kind of offense and there­
fore no longer.

QUESTION:

But then let me go back to the same

question I asked of your opponent,

Suppose this man’s

28
regular clothing were of a hippie type and he showed up in
sandals in December in Harris County and insisted on wearing
those clothes.

Might, he not be worse off in the eyes of a

particular jury than to be in a clean — if it is clean
prison garb?
tod while you are answering that, you and your
opponents say different things about where"Harris County
Jail"is.

You said it was on the chest,

it was on the back.

Your opponent said

What does the record ©how?

MR. ADERHO.LT:

I believe the record does show it

to be on his back.
The hippie clothes question, Mr. Justice Blackmun,
1 can't imagine any lawyer not being extremely cautious in
trying — in dressing his defendant for trial before an
average jury in Texas, especially and I think anywhere.
«>

The objective would be to emulate — give a mirror
image to the jury«

as was stated in an article in the

Practical Lawyer by a prosecutor in Ohio and he takes our
position that it is extremely unfair.
QUESTION:

But the real difference is, if a man

wants to make a jackass out of himself, he has a right to do
it but ha can't be compelled to do it.
MR. ADERHOLTs

I think that .is the distinction,

Mr. Justice Marshall.
QUESTION:

You don't suggest that he was

29
compelled to do it here, do you?
MR. ADERHOLT:
QUESTION:

Yes, we do.

I thought he made no objection here.

MR. ADERHOLT:

He made no objection.

The record

shows that he asked the captain — and ha named the captain

on the trial in the habeas corpus who refused to let him put
on, a suit that the man had pressed and waiting for him at
the rehabilitation center.
In addition to that, the rehabilitation centers
wher» the defendants live are some miles from the trial
location in Houston, Texas.

At that time the accused

requested a suit that he had ready and waiting for him and
this was denied.

This was refused.

QUESTION:

But he did not renew that request to

the trial judge who was presiding over the trial,, did he?
MR. ADERHOLTs
QUESTION:

No, he did not.

Well, isn't that judge the person who

has the responsibility for the conduct of the trial?
MR. ADERHOLT:
have made an objection.

Yes, your Honor, I think he should
This was an inept trial by the

defense counsel, if I may say so.
QUESTION:

Well, now are you arguing ineffective

assistance of counsel?
MR. ADERHOLT:
Circuit.

We argued that in the Fifth

However, we felt the stronger case was on the

30

previous presidential decisions.,
I would like to add to that that the trial judge
appointed a lawyer to represent this man earlier in 1970.
The man was — the defendant was indigent and the trial court
allowed this trial to proceed with the defendant in jail
clothes in the face of some 19 decisions before December of
1970 in 15 different courts including the eastern district
of Louisiana? the Fifth Circuit in Brooks versus Texas, and
some nine or ten Supreme Court decisions in other states.
1 believe that it was well-established law — rule
in

by the time that the defendant was tried.

There were

nine Supreme Court decisions in Florida? Colorado? Alabama?
Arkansas? Pennsylvania? Michigan —
QUESTION:

Was the trial judge supposed to read

through all those by himself without ever having it called
to his attention by defense counsel?
MR. ADERHOLT:

No? your Honor? but I do believe

that the Sheriff is the one who compelled the accused to
wear these clothes.
QUESTION:

The state did this,
Wall? but is the state simply — is

the state one entity in this sense that if you make a
complaint to a captain in the sheriff’s office some miles
away from the courthouse? it is the same as having protested
to the judge to whom the state has entrusted responsibility
for the trial?

31
MR. ADERHOLT:
to the court.

He did not.

He should have made an objection
The decisions do not require an

objection.
QUESTIONS

Well, what decisions?

Are you talking

about a decision of this Court?
MR. ADERHOLT:

Mo, your Honor, I am talking about

lower court decisions.
QUESTION:

Well, why shouldn’t an objection be

required here where whatever may be the case with, perhaps,
more fundamental rights — if this is a constitutional right
if some lawyers like to have the client tried in jail garb,
as the record here indicates and others apparently feel it
is prejudicial.
Why shouldn’t we at least require that someone
who doesn’t want to be tried that way haves called the
objection to the attention of the trial judge?
MR, ADERHOLT:

With the exception of the funda­

mental nature; that you discussed, I think that an objection
should be lodged but there are those cases where, as in
this case, as in Hernandez, as in many others, where the
circumstances are such where any objection is chiliad, the
lawyer testified in the habeas corpus hearing that he had
made an objection in a trial court in that county before and
he was denied.
QUESTIONz

Well, you say "chilled."

I certainly,

32
in IS years of practice, I would not only make an objection
before different trial judges, I'd make the same objection
time and again before the same trial judge and I never felt
he was going to cut ray heed off if I did it so long as I was
courteous and respectful.
To say that you. made an objection before another
trial judge

and it was denied doesn't strike me as any

reason at all why you shouldn't make an objection before
this trial judge.
QUESTION;

In this connection, do you accept

Judge Love's exhibit — well, the exhibit which is Judge
Love's affidavit to the effect that on numerous occasions
during that period of time since 1958, "I have granted
requests by defendants or their attorneys for them to be
allowed to obtain civilian clothes to wear at their

trials.

"I have never compelled a defendant to go to trial
in jail clothes whenever his attorney requests otherwise.”
And he goes on to say that, "Had this request
been made of me, I would have granted such, request and
permitted the defendant to be tried in civilian clothing.”
Do you accept this as a statement of fact in
this case ox* do you not?
MR. ADERKOLTs

No, I do not, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

The trial judge, 1 do not believe, would falsify such an
affidavit.

On the other hand, I don't know who prepared the

33
affidavit.

It was brought the day of trial.

I strenuously

objected that I did not have an opportunity to cross-examine
that statement.

I had had depositions in the case on these

very issues showing the practice of that trial court —
every case tried in his court on a non-bail defendant was
tried in prison garb.
QUESTION:

You mean Judge Love’s court, not just

the district court of Harris County?
MR. ADERHOLT s

Judge Love’s court, every defendant.

There was no exception and this affidavit showed up in trial
and I objected to Judge —
QUESTION:

You mean on the habeas corpus hearing?

MR. ADERHOLT:

On the habeas corpus hearing, yes,

your Honor, that I did not have an opportunity to crossexamine that statement because I believe the facts to be
otherwise.
QUESTION:

What year did you gat into this case?

MR. ADERHOLT:

The end of — early 1971, I believe,

your Honor.
QUESTION:

Was that by appointment?

MR. ADERHOLT:
QUESTION:

It was by appointment of Judge Love.

Had you taken Judge Love's deposition in

the habeas case»?
MR. ADERHOLT:

No, I took the deposition of his

clerk and the sheriff and every single lawyer who tried the

34
case where the defendant was tried

in prison garb and that

was introduced into evidence of the case of the habeas corpus
hearing.
QUESTION:

Mr. Aderholt, you suggested that you

had argued at one point in this controversy that there was
ineffective assistance of counsel.

Are you referring there

to the fact that counsel failed to object?
MR. ADERHOLT:

I think that that was one of my

grounds,
QUESTION:

Was the practice in Testas generally

for lawyers to object when they thought the court had made a
ruling that was adverse to the client's interest?
MR. ADERHOLT:
QUESTION:

Yes, of course it is.

Isn't it that you not only make

objection, you have to file a bill of exception in writing?
Is that still the law in Texas?
MS. ADERHOLT:

I don't know, Mr, Justice Marshall.

I think, though, that if it is a fundamental error, that there

would be no objection required.
QUESTION:

But normally don’t you file objection

and a bill of exception both?
MR. ADERHOLT:

I think it is wise, unless the

record reflects what you complain of.
QUESTION:

CA-5» I think, in Hernandez, repeated

what it had said earlier, that this error, constitutional or

35
otherwise, could bs waived by failing to object»
Are

you suggesting that it was unnecessary for

counsel to object in order to accomplish a waiver of the
rights?
In other words, are you saying objection is not
necessary under any circumstances?
MR. ADERHOLT;

I believe that the rule is

presently in all jurisdictions, with varying degrees, that
there is no objection required»

X do believe that the error-

that the rule should be stated, that it is error to try an
accused in prison garb unless he voluntarily waives a known
right to observe standard,
QUESTION:

Can he v?eiive it through his counsel?

That is mv point.
MR. ADERHQLT:
QUESTION:

Yes, he may.

Can he waive it through his counsel?

MR. ADERHGLT:

Yes, he may.

I certainly think ha

should be able to and could.
QUESTION:

Can yon really bring yourself to say

that the right not to be tried

in prison garb is — you can

squate with the right of counsel that was involved in %erbst?
If we are talking about fundamental rights.
QUESTION:

the fairness of a jury trial,
QUESTZON:

1 believe that the *—

Well, but the right to trial by jury

itself was held nan-retroactive.
MR. ADERHOLT:

Yes, your Honor, but I do.n9t believe

retroactivity even comes into this case,

I tried to persuade

the Fifth Circuit not to discuss retroactivity.
QUESTION:

Why isn't it in this case?

MR. ADERHOLT:

Because we have 19 decisions before

the case was even tried that —
QUESTION:

But assuming that Hernandez was a

new departure, however, retroactivity is involved in this
case.
MR. ADERHOLT:

Yes, because the Fifth Circuit made

it so, but 1 do believe -QUESTION:

Well, then Hernandez is the first time

it ever suggested it was putting it on a constitutional
basis?
MR. ADERHOLT:

No,your Honor, I believe Brooks

versus Texas —QUESTION:

It just said fundamentally unfair.

MR. ADERHOLT:
QUESTION:

They said that it —

They said unfair.

MR, ADERHOLT:

That said that it was inherently

prejudicial.
QUESTION:

Uh huh, well —

3?

QUESTION:

I suppose the only reason the Fifth

Circuit could upset a Texas conviction would be on a
constitutional basis, wouldn't it?
MR. ADSRHOLT:

But we have four — five federal

courts handing down decisions on the jail clothes case before
Williams

was tried in Harris County.
QUESTION:

Are they‘binding on this Court?

MR. ADSRHOLT:
QUESTION:

No.

Well, then ~

MR. ADSRHOLT:

But I was speaking in terras of

retroactivity in connection to the constitutional right.

The

Fifth Circuit has clearly indicated that it was a fundamental
protection.
One of the earlier statements was that the Fifth
Circuit had laid down a per se rule

in Hernandea and also

in Williams and the way I read the case is it is hot a per se
rule and it is not a per se rule in any of the many and
lengthy decisions across the country.
In all these cases it appears to me that the
question is whether or not harmless error — whether it is
harmless or not beyond a reasonable doubt.
I would add that one element that I have not
stressed is that all of these cases that we are discussing
are a particular class of defendant.
generally have poorer counsel.

They, if I may say so,

They generally are not

38
protected as thoroughly as someone who is able to hire an
attorney and get out of jail and defend himself.
There, further,- is no legitimate state interest
in trying a defendant in jail clothes»

It is simply an

unnecessary influence on the jury.
The prosecutor of Williams was brought by the
state to testify in the habeas corpus hearing and. the
prosecutor in Judge Love's court stated that he encountered
jurors who were hostile to defendants because they were
brought in in jail clothes.

That was his own testimony.

toy attorney who tries jury cases in Texas knows
that jurors — it is almost impossible to convince them of
the presumption of innocence if the defense rested after
the defendant was brought in and an indictment read, many
defendants would be in a great deal of trouble if the defense
stopped right there, even though the presumption of innocence
would apply to them.
I believe that putting a defendant in this kind
of a garb is simply unnecessary.

It gives the jury negative

inferences and in this particular case where the defendant
does not take a stand, the jury must make its assessment,
QUESTION;

Do I understand you to agree that this

judge is the same judge who lent a suit of clothing to a
defendant who objected to being tried in jail clothes?
MR. ADEHKOLT:

I meant to cover that, Fir, Chief

39

Justice.
earlier

v

The affidavit, or the exhibit that was referred to

did not, I believe, state that quite clearly.

The

judge did say he had lent a suit of civilian clothes to a
defendant.
Again, this was not subject to ny cross-examination
and we do not know when he is talking about.

I think that

the judge was very sensitive to this issue because Hernandes
had been handed down already.
The point is —
QUESTION:

The affidavit says that this happened

on several occasions and he had people that brought: the
clothing in and they were permitted to change into civilian
clothes in the jury room.
MR. ADERHOLT:
QUESTION:

But we do not Itnow when.

Does that not suggest that if an

objection had been made, this judge would have promptly
granted what you say is required?
MR. ADERHOLT:

it never happened.
clothes.

That might be a fair conclusion
I do not accept it, though, because

All the defendants were tried in jail

We don't know whether an objection —
QUESTION:

No, we are talking about this case.

You concede that no objection was made and I took it you
agreed that this judge had, on prior occasions, \suppXied
clothing.

Did you agree or not agree?

40
MR. ADERHOLT;

Ho, 1 did not, Mr. Chief Justice.

I stated that we do not know very much about those occasions,
whether they occurred before Williams5 trial or after
Williams' trial and 1 do not know of any incidents where this
judge has done this.
QUESTION s

In the Hernandez case on rehearing, the

court Fifth Circuit said this:

"Appellee's petition for

rehearing states that surely some burden must ba put on the
defendant and his attorney to make known that he desires to
be tried in civilian clothes before the state can be held
accountable for his being trxed in jail clothes."
Than the Court said, "We agree and our opinion is
not to the contrary.

Defendant may not remain silent and

willingly go to trial in prison garb and thereafter claim
error."
Now, is that the rule that was applied in the case
before us?
MR. ADERHOLT:

It was.

The Fifth Circuit followed

Brooks, its earlier decision in Brooks versus Texas in 1967
and made a very strong policy statement and also held in
Hernandez, versus Tex;: s

a very strong case and it looked like

it was a per se rule.
I think on rehearing it took a small step back and
stated all the Chapman and Harrington tests should come into
play.

41
QUESTION:
rehearing.

Well, that isn't what they said on

That was in the main opinion.

just what I said, just what I read you.

Here they said
They said, "We

agree a defendant may not remain silent and willingly go to
trial in prison garh.,!
MR. ADERHOLT:

But Hernandez made no objection,

your Honor.
QUESTION:

I know, but they went on to explain

why you couldn't, in Hernandez, why you

couldn't stick him

with a waiver because he thought it might ■— he didn't think
he

had any chance whatsoever to win such a motion.
MR. ADERHOLT:

Well, that was trial counsel's

testimony in the habeas in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but you just told us

that there had bean so many — you just told us what the
xule was in Hernandez, chat this is that it wasn't a new rule
at all, that any fool ought to know that you shouldn't try a
fellow in prison garb.

It has been the rule since Brooks

and all these other decisions in other cases.
So why wouldn't you oblige.the attorney to speak
up?
MR. ADERHOLT:

Because Hernandez made no objection

the court said,, we did not decide, that is not a voluntary
waiver.
QUESTION:

We are not bound by Hernandez.

That is

42
a Fifth Circuit case»
QUESTION:

But even on an Hernandea basis, they

had some very special reason for saying there was no voluntary
waiver in Hernandea which certainly doesn't seem to apply
here .
MR. ADERHOLT:

Your Honor, the facts

and in Williams are practically identical.
QUESTION:

in Hernandez

The

They must have found some other basis

for reversal, in light of what Justice White just read to you.
MR. ADERHOLT:

I believe that their statement on

a motion for rehearing is, "The defendant may not willingly
go to trial and later claim error."
However, there was no objectior-, in Her nandas and
so it must be taken to mean, within the meaning of the
opinion, that an objection is not required.
QUESTION:

Well, is this the key to it in this

case, after quoting what Justice White has just read you from
Hernandeg, the Fifth Circuit went on to say, "Waiver of the
objection cannot be inferred that merely from failure to
object, if trial in prison garb is customary in the juris­
diction," and I think your position is that it was customary
and that is what this habeas record shows.
You say that Judge Love's affidavit doesn't
really depict the actual practice which you say in Judge
Love's court was always to try in prison garb.

Is that right?

43
MR,, ADERHOLT:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

Then the Fifth Circuit goes on, "It

must be shown that the practice was not customary and might
not foe insisted upon if objected to or that the defendant
hoped to elicit sympathy by his appearance in such clothing."
MR. ADERHOLT:

That is precisely my position and

I believe that the Hernandez case, when looked at on its
motion for rehearing, is clear and is coinscribed with the
other cases on point from 1938 on.
QUESTION:

Well, do you think trying a person in

prison garb, when he objects or even when he doesn't object,
is an error that could be harmless?
MR. ADERHOLT:

Do I believe that it could ever be

harmless?
QUESTION:

Yes, could you hold it a harmless

error?
MR. ADERHOLT:
QUESTION:

Oh, yes, I do.

Let’s assume a man requests to be

tried in his civilian clothes and is turned down.

They go

to trial and he is convicted and the state defends on the
grounds that it was harmless error.
MR. ADERHOLT:

I think that it could foe harmless

and I think that that ought to be the test, that the real
ought-to-be and I believe is in all jurisdictions, that it
is an error, a fundamental error to try an accused in prison

44
garb unless he voluntarily waives the right and if the
probable impact on the jury was harmless beyond unreasonable
doubt.
The per se rule is easier to apply but X believe
that is the rule as found in all jurisdictions up to 1970.
QUESTION:

Well, how do you determine whether it

is harmless or not?
MR. ADERHOLT :
QUESTION:

You can’t.

MR. ADERHOLT:
QUESTION:

That's —

That is awfully broad.

You can’t examine the jurors.

MR. ADERHOLT:

It was done in the habeas hearing

that counsel just referred to and it should and could have
been done in this case.
QUESTION:

They permitted inquiry of the jurors

themselves?
MR. ABERHOLT:

Yes, your Honor.

I think that the

that the question should have been gone into.

Now, the

Hernandea decision and the Williams decision and the Thomas
decision are all Fifth Circuit decisions, went into the test
of harmless error on the angle of sufficiency of evidence.

In Hernandez, the court said that there was
insufficiency of evidence —
QUESTION:

Is it the case in Texas that you may

impeach a jury verdict by examination of the jurors?

MR. ADEHHOLT:

I think that the question, the

inquisition of the jury was whether or not. they identified it
as a prison uniform and whether or not it made any impact on
them.
QUESTION?

The Fifth Circuits best of harmless

error, as I understand it in the —> a3 spelled out in the
Thomas case doesn't go to the jurors' impression about the
prison — about the clothing the defendant was wearing but
rather as to what the evidence of/guilt

was in the case and

/

if it was so overwhelming that the court can say beyond a
reasonable doubt that he would have been found guilty what­
ever he was wearing or not wearing than, they'd find it was
harmless error.

That is the Thomas case, isn't it?

MR. ADERHOLT:

It is, and I believe that is the

holding in all these jurisdictions
QUESTION:

That's what I thought, too,

MR, ADEHHOLT:

— and cases that I have — and I

did not have an opportunity to go into my view of the
sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence on the question
of whether or not the defendant was guilty of assault with
intent to murder with malice.
QUESTION:

The federal appeals goes into that at

some length,
MR. ADERHOLT:

out —

It does at seme length and the

i

46
QUESTION :

My only question was whether the

inquiry as to the harmlassnass of the error was directed to
the jury's impression or the impressions the members of the
jury drew from the clothing he was wearing or rather,, does
It go to the evidence of guilt

in the case?

And it does,

it is the latter to which the courts have directed their
inquiry, is it not, in determining whether or not the error
was harmless?
MR. ADERHOLT:

It dq^s, Mr. Justice Stewart, and

it also, however, mentions — the reason I bring this in,
that the defendant, in order to win, must prove that he was
tried in an identifiable jail or prison garb.
QUESTION;

First of all.

MR. ADERH0L7:
QUESTION:

First.,

But than that can still be harmless

in the view of these courts that have decided this case.
MR. ADERHOLT:

Yes.

All the courts have

determined -QUESTION:

Right.

MR. ADERHOLT s

— the harmless error under

Chapman —
QUESTION;

Right.

MR. ADERHOLT;

— to be one of the grounds of the

sufficiency of the evidence.
QUESTION:

Beyond, —-

so that a court can say,

47
beyond a reasonable doubt, that however he might have been
dressed at the time'of this trial, he would have bean found
guilty.
MR. ADERHOLT:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

That, should be

Wall, nevertheless, that isn't the

inquiry that has been made to juries in these situations.
You just suggested you do ask jurors whether they noticed
the clothing.
MR. ADERHOLT:

Wo, your Honor, I believe that my

answer was that there was one case that was brought up in
the statete brief where jurors were questioned on a habeas
corpus as to whether, one, they identified this as a prison
garb and they said they didn't and secondly, whether or not
what was the impact I believe was the other inquiry.
QUESTION:

Yes.

That indicates that it has

happened at least once in these cases that you do inquire
from the jurors about the impact of the clothing.
MR. ADERHOLT:

Yes, your Honor, I think the state

could have subpoenaed those 12 jurors and asked them to
defeat our claim.
QUESTION:

Or you could‘have subpoenaed them,

X suppose.
MR. ADERHOLT:

I could have but I think that the

sufficiency of the evidence in this case was so poor to
prove that he was guilty of the offense with malice that we

48
chose not to bring the jurors in and that is the difficult
thing to do, is to bring jurors in.
QUESTION:

Mr. Merho.lt, let me ask you one snore

question of, perhaps, comparing the various degrees of
these rights.

You just agreed, I believe, with Mr. Justice

Stewart in his statement of the harmless error test in this
case and that is whether the evidence was so overwhelming
that no matter how the guy was dressed, he would, have been
convicted.

That situation you find harmless error.
How about where the man has been deprived of

counsel?

Do you have a harmless error finding there that

3/ou say, no matter whether this guy had a lawyer or not, he
would have been convicted, the evidence was so overwhelming?
MR. ADEFHOLT:

No, I would not follow that logic.

I do, however, believe that this has been many,
\

many years of decision as held by lower courts, since 1938,
that, this is one of the tests to be used under Chapman and
Harrington.
QUESTION:

Chapman, Justice Rehnquist has been

stirring the issues before the Court in Chapman and is
suggesting by his question what was said in the dissenting
opinion that I remember well but Chapman decided that if a
constitutional

error existed in a case, the conviction

nonetheless could be affirmed if the court could say beyond a
reasonable doubt that that error did .not affect the verdict

49
of guilt but recognized exceptions among which were
deprivation of the right to counsel.
Now, whether or not that wsis rational, that is
what the court did in Chapman.
MR. ADERHOLT:

Yes, and included within this

concept of harmless error I guess you would have to put in
the two exceptions in the Fifth Circuit and the other
decisions of the Garcia exception where he uses a trial
tactic and, secondly, the Henderson exception where the
crime was committed in prison it was impossible to keep it
from, the jury.
QUESTION;

Right, there are exceptions to the

harmless error rule.
MR. ADERHOLT:
QUESTION:

Yes.

If you can show there has been a

deprivation of counsel, if you can show that there has been
an involuntary confession, then there is no room to argue
that the error was harmless.'

That is the Chapman holding.

But those are exceptions.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Aderholt.

Did you have anything further, Mr. Sullivan?
MR. SULLIVAN:

No, your Honor,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Aderholt, you

appeared by appointment of the Court at our request, as you
did in the Fifth Circuit on behalf of the Court.
