P ROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 73-1288, Dunhill against the Republic of Cuba
and Daniel Solano Pinera.
Mr. Friedman„ you may begin whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF VICTOR S. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
We are hare pursuant to this Court's order of
last June which restored this case to the calendar for
reargument, directing the parties to address the question
of whether this Court's holding in Banco Nacional de Cuba,
versus Sabbatino should be reconsidered.
The United States filed a brief amicus and we
have ceded 15 minutes of our time for oral argument to the
Government.
On this question, our position, supported by the
United States, is that Sabbatino should be reconsidered inso~
far as it may be read to permit a foreign sovereign to
utilize the active state doctrine to repudiate its commercial
obligations.
The amount of foreign trade being conducted by
government agencies continues to increase in size and

4
importance.
Largely as a result of that, the Doctrine of
Sovereign Immunity in the United States and elsehere has
been restricted so that a foreign government acting in a
commercial capacity may not assert sovereign immunity as a
defense to defeat adjudication of claims properly brought
against it.
QUESTION:

Is that true even though the foreign

government is the defendant, say, maybe just as a ship in
New York harbor and is libeled by a private plaintiff?
MR» FRIEDMAN:

Well, the assertion of a claim

against the property of the foreign government stands on a
somewhat different footing but the actual adjudication of
claims against the foreign

government, when you eliminate

the property difficulties that some courts have had -QUESTION:

Well, how do you get your jurisdiction

over a foreign government other than by attaching a
property?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

We can, in some occasions serve

a trading agency if it has an office in the United States,
can serve it under some long-arm statutes.

One can get

jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

And in that case, even though they

are a defendant and are not seeking any relief, your
position is that the claim of the private plaintiff can be

5

adjudicated.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Absolutely, your Honor.

Certainly, under the restrictive theory of sovereign

i

immunity.

There have been some difficulties where the

State Department, for example, may come in and suggest
immunity even though the case would

seem to be covered by

the restrictive theory but absent such a suggestion, the
rule today is fairly unanimous in the United States courts
that such a claim can be adjudicated.
And we do not see any reason why the foreign
government should be able to accomplish the same results
that it could have accomplished under sovereign immunity,
simply by characterizing the repudiation of its obligations
as an act of state.
Before addressing this question more fully,
however, we feel compelled to stress here as we have in our
b riefs that this issue need be reached by the Court only if
certain threshold issues are passed.
In particular, ws do not believe this issue need
be reached unless this Court agrees with the Court of Appeals
that the act of state in issue here was indeed Cuba's
repudiation of its obligation to return to Dunhill certain
payments that Dunhill had made, to Cuba for cigars.
I stress this because Cuba now appears to argue
with us, contrary to its prior position — end although for

different reasons, that this holding of the Court of Appeals
/

was incorrect.
In order to put these contentions in context
and explain some

of these threshold questions, I'd like

very briefly to review the history of the litigation, in a
capsule form.
The litigation, of course, arose out of the 1960
decree in Cuba which nationalized or intervened certain of
the Cuban cigar factories.
Dunhill and two other United States importers,
for a number of years simply stood on the sidelines as
stakeholders while the former owners of these businesses
in Cuba battled with the courts of the United States to
determine which of them was entitled to payments for cigars
shipped both before and after the intervention.
In the prior action not involving Dunhill or the
other importers, Palicio against Brush and Bloch, it was
held by the Second Circuit that the interventors could
recover for all of the post-intervention shipments of the
cigars.
The interventors, at that point, stipulated that
the owners could recover for the pre-intervention shipments
because, in their view, the amounts were too small to worry
about.
After those threshold issues were resolved,

both the owners and the interventors pressed their claims
against the importer.

That: is this action.

And it later developed in this action that the
fundamental assumption which underlay that stipulation v/as
incorrect because

it turned out that as of the date of the

intervention, there was unpaid almost a half a million
dollars for preintervention shipments of cigars.
It further developed in our case -- and it was
strenuously contested by the interventors — that the
importers had paid those sums shortly after the intervention
and it further developed that those payments had found their
way to the Cuban Government.
As a matter of law, the District Court ruled
that those amounts were still owed by the importers to the
owners.

We had paid the wrong people.

But that, we could,

recover those amounts from Cuba.
In the case of Dunhill, because the amounts
transmitted to Cuba exceeded by some $55,000 the amount
due for cigars shipped after the intervention, the District
Court entered an affirmative judgment in favor of Dunhill
against Cuba in that amount.
The Court of Appeals affirmed the District
Court's rulings in every respect except one.

It set aside

the affirmative judgment against Cuba in favor of Dunhill.
The Court of Appeals held -- again over Cuba's

8

vigorous opposition, that the evidence showed that Cuba had
received all of the post-intervention payments but it also
held that Cuba's — and I quote — "failure to honor the
importer's demand " for return of the payments constituted
an act of state and therefore, under the Sabbatino and
First National City Bank, no affirmative judgment could be
entered against Cuba*
Dunhill, of course, is seeking —
QUESTION:

Is that the only act. of state the

Court of Appeals identified?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

With respect to —

MR,, FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Absolutely, your Honor.

With respect to Dunhill.

Their holding was not based on the

notion that Cuba had nationalized an accounts receivable?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, your Honor, on that issue --

on that issue, the issue of the accounts receivable, the
Court held that since the accounts receivable had a United
States situs, that no act of state would be recognized.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

’

The n : effect, of course, of the

Court of Appeals' ruling is to impose double liability against
Dunhill for the amounts which it now cannot recover in Cuba.
Under the rulings of the court now, that money is still
owed by Dunhill to the owners and there is no recovery over

9

it.
The

first threshold question before we reach

Sabbatino, of course, remains the principle question on
which certiorari was duly granted.
That is, whether statements by counsel for Cuba
that Petitioner’s unjust enrichment counterclaim would not
be honored by his client, constitute or evidence an act of
state.
We continue to urge, as we did before, that in
our view, that those statements that Cuba would refuse to
make any such repayments did not and could not. constitute
an act of state and we will not belabor that argument here
again.

We note only that if our position is accepted in

that regard, reexamination of Sabbatino, however desirable,
is unnecessary to a decision of the case.
The result would simply be to revert to Judge
Brien's ruling and to reinstate the affirmative judgment
he entered against Cuba.
A second major threshold issue is created by
Cuba's complete shift in position as to precisely what
constitutes the operative act of
this case.

The Court of Appeals, of course, found it to

be the repudiation of the obligation to repay Dunhili.

Court of Appeals described.

Then you say that the barrier

Yes, your

Honor, because
QUESTION:

There is no question of sovereign

immunity or anything like that?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Sovereign immunity has never

been asserted by Cuba in this case and indeed, your Honor,
it could not have been asserted because of the restrictive
theory about sovereign immunity now adopted by the courts
and although Cuba has never requested a suggestion of
sovereign immunity from the State Department, I think with
the State Department *s present position that would be
unlikely,
QUESTION:

Mr. Friedman, has Cuba ever acknow­

ledged an obligation to repay the importers?

Are you

contending they repudiated an obligation that they never
acknowledged to exist is what I am really asking.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

So far as we know, Mr. Justice

Stevens, Cuba, qua Cuba, has never said anything about this
obligation.

Cuba brought all of the contentions into the

United States courts seeking the moneys which it later
turned out they had already received.
So it is difficult for me to address your
question

in these terms.

11
QUESTION:
don’t understand

Well, I perhaps stated it wrong.

I

them to be contending that they repudiated

an existing obligation but rather that their act of state
was to, in effect, appropriate the property of your clients
when it was in Cuba, namely the cash when it was paid on
account.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
respond to you.

If I may, your Honor,

let me

This is a third position that Cuba is now

taking, as I see it, for the first time, in its reply to the
Government's amicus brief.

One of the great difficulties

we have had, I think, in analyzing an act of state issue
here, is identifying it.

It is quite clear that up to the

time that certiorari was granted in this case, the only act
of state on which Cuba was relying was this repudiation of
the asserted obligation.
If I may read from its brief in opposition to
our petition for certiorari, Cuba said, "But here, the
Republic of Cuba is a party to the suit.

For seven long

years it has been asserting that its repudiation of the
debt was its act of state." That assertion was made in the
District Court, in the Court of Appeals and is now being
made in this Court.
QUESTION:

And it was the foundation for the

Court of Appeals’ judgment.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Absolutely, your Honor,

12

absolutely.

Now, contrast that with the position that Cuba

took in the brief

on reargument in which Cuba now says,

"We do not agree that the act of state doctrine does not
apply to commercial transactions but find no need to argue
the point here.

It

is, of course, absurd to characterize

this as an ordinary commercial controversy.
"It arose, not out of the normal international
trade but out of an intervention and it is the intervention
which is the act of state, not the repudiation of a
commercial debt."
So we are faced with a rather threshold
difficulty here in analyzing just what it is that Cuba says
is the act of state.
There was, of course, no proof of anything at
the trial other than the fact that a decree had been
entered.
With respect to the decree itself, there are
some very difficult issues presented by Cuba’s present —
what I consider Cuba's present position.

That is that the

decree now somehow constitutes the act of state.
The theory of that, of course, is that the
decree, having nationalized the accounts receivable of the
owners, somehow operated to give a claim of right to Cuba’s
appropriation of the funds as they arrived in Cuba.
The difficulty is that to deal v/ith that issue,

13
I do not believe that the proper pax*ties are before the
Court.

The net effect of reversing the lower court's

conclusions on that issue wouId be to adversely affect the
rights of the owners.

They are the real parties in interest.

Dunhill, in fact, has no real stake in this
because if the accounts receivable were appropriated by
Cuba in an act of state: that would be recognized by the
United States Court, we paid the right people.
QUESTION:

Let me ask you, suppose we disagreed

with you and agreed with the Court of Appeals that there was
an act of state in the repudiation and that the ruling of
Sabbatino was therefore to be contended with.

That would

bar any consideration of whether or not there was a
violation of international law.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

If Sabbatino were followed and

that ruling and that version of the Sabbatino case ware to
be followed, yes.
QUESTION:

Well, assume Sabbatino were not

followed in that respect.

Would you claim it was a

violation of international law in the repudiation of Cuba
of this debt?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes, we would, your Honor, but I

don't think we would even necessarily reach that question —
QUESTION:

Because?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Because in our view Sabbatino

should not apply to ~~

Well, I understand that, but — oh,

repudiation of a debt incurred in the course of a
commercial transaction so that one does not even reach the
question of whether such a repudiation is a violation of

either say it is not an act of state or one can say,
although it may be an act of state, such an act of state
will not be given recognition as a defense by the sovereign
who is committing the act of state to its commercial
obligation.
QUESTION:

So you say that whether or not it

violates international law, you have another reason for
saying that the act of state would not bar recovery.

But we do not need to reach that

in this case at all, on our theory of how Sabbatino should
be read to deal with repudiation of commercial obligations.
I would like to address myself for a minute to
Mr. Justice Stevens’ question regarding the last known
position, at least, of Cuba with respect to what the fct
of state is.
Cuba now appears to taka the position in its
reply to the Government's amicus brief that the act of state
may have been neither the decree itself nor the laterrepudiation but somehow a seizure of the funds as they
arrived in Cuba — perhaps under the authority of the
original intervention decree.
Our response to that is that that factual
assertion is

so contrary to the actual position taken by

Cuba in the courts below during the course of this
litigation that it should be rejected out of hand.
It must be recalled that in —
QUESTION:

Let me just get that straight

because I have some difficulty following these changes of
position.

In those briefs in opposition to the petition

for certiorari, they contended that the nationalization
included the nationalisation of the accounts receivable,
that the decree itself-- that the act of state included
nationalization of the accounts receivable.

QUESTION:

That is.

As I read it, on page three,

it says, "They argued that even if they had received the
payments, the payments were not recoverable in this suit
because one, the nationalisation of the owner's property
included the nationalization of the owner's accounts
receivable and hence the interventor was entitled to

Maybe that is the wrong document.

Correct.

MR. FRIEDMAN: And therefore they were entitled —

They

were therefore entitled to these payments as they came in.
That was not the act of state against Dunhill.
The act of state against Dunhill
QUESTION:

was the repudiation.

But it seems to me there isn't such

a great difference between an argument that they
nationalized the accounts receivable and an argument which
they now make that in all events we nationalized the payments
on account of the accounts receivable as they came in.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I think there is an enormous

difference, your Honor, because the nationalisation of the
accounts receivable is the nationalization of a Cuban asset,
one that does not even raise the issue of out-of-state, or
one that affects the rights of American citizens.
When you talk about nationalizing payments, that
is a very different question because those payments were

18

payments of Dunhill.
QUESTION:

But I suppose their theory would be

that when they arrived they became the payments of the prior
owners.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, if the prior nationalization

was effective to nationalize the accounts receivable.

The

courts below have both held that not to be so, for purposes
of American law because the accounts receivable were held
by both the district court and the Court of Appeals under
the Republic of Iraq case to have a situs in the United
States and therefore not subject to the act of state
doctrine.
QUESTION:

And do they clearly retain their situs

in the United States when payment is made on the account?
Or is that part of the problem?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is a different issue,

9

though, your Honor, because we start with the premise now
from the rulings of the courts below that the accounts
receivable 'were not nationalized so that if the payments —
if it is now true disposition that it was the payments that
were nationalized as they went down by some affirmative act
of the sovereign, my response is somewhat different.
My response there is that that so contradicts
the factual position that Cuba took through 15 years of
litigation in our courts, that they should not be heard to

19

urge it at this point.
It must be recalled that in 1961, shortly after
the alleged seizures took place, Cuba came into our courts
^

and sought to .recover them.

Later on, in the Ralicio

against Bloch litigation, when it became —* when they
thought that the payments were insignificant, they gave up
their right to them.
Then, in our litigation when it developed again —
QUESTION:

They stipulated that they would not

seek to recover them in that litigation.

Is that a complete

abandonment of the right to them?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
+

my point.

No, your Honor, and that is not

I am not arguing whether that stipulation was

effective or not.

I am simply saying,

when it later

developed in our case that the amounts were substantial,
they reasserted their right to the money.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

When it turned out that not only

had they been paid but the court found that they had
received them over their vigorous opposition, they still,
maintained that they were entitled to the money and that they
_

hadn't received them.

They maintained that as late as the

Court of Appeals.
,

And how can Cuba now come in and say, with that
history, 15 years of denying that they ever received the

20

money and claiming that they wanted it, to now say, wait a
minute.
tell you.

At the very beginning of all of this, we forgot to
We really took this money in the first instance.
In our view, that claim of the factual basis

for the act of state makes all of the proceedings that went
on below a charade.
For the reasons I have stated, we conclude that
the Sabbatino issue that is now framed by the Court need be
reached only if the Court concludes — as did the Court of
Appeals that counsel's statements were sufficient to
evidence the act of state and that act of state was the
repudiation by Cuba of its obligations to DunhiXl.
Nov/, once past that threshold issue, we believe
that Sabbatino should be reconsidered, as I have indicated
and the act of state doctrine should not be available as a
defense to a sovereign in the effort to repudiate its
commercial obligations.
We

begin from the premise that the act of

state doctrine is a doctrine of judicial extension.
QUESTION:

In this respect, are you more or less

in agreement with the United States?
NR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

I think we are,your Honor.

Yes.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes, I think we are.

There may

be differences in phraseology, but I think we come out

21

fairly close and for fairly much the same reasons.
Indeed,, having argued at length in our brief
that we did not believe that the executive branch could be
embarrassed by such a ruling and that there would be no
interference with our foreign relations or separation of
powers problem created by that, we obviously are gratified
that the executive branch, in its views, concurred and,
indeed, I think that with the Court's permission, I would
like to defer my argument on that subject in view of the
time element to government counsel.
I would like, with the Court's permission, to
stress a slightly different approach to the problem and that
is, based on our own experiences as counsel

to clients

engaged in a considerable volume of international trade.
The government, obviously* has far greater
expertise in dealing with the foreign relations aspect.
Perhaps the private counsel can add something to the issue.
Obviously, trade .is conducted today with a
variety of energies overseas; sometimes, obviously, private
entities and in some instances governmental.

In some

instances some mixture, which may be analagous to some of
our forms, sometimes not.
As a commercial lawyer, I start with the premise
that the law ought to reflect, in dealing with commercial
problems, as nearly as possible the expectations of the

22
parties to commercial transactions.
Those expectations, I can assure the Court, do
not vary, depending on whether the party on the other side of
the transaction is an agency of a foreign government, is a
private trader, or is some combination of the two.
Indeed, in many instances, with the numerous
forms that now exist in the commercial world, it is
difficult to know and, indeed, one may never know precisely
what the form of the other entity is.
There are types of trading companies throughout
the world that have no analog in our system.
some government ownership.
ownership.

There may be

There may be some private

The interests to be served may never fully be

known by the other party to the transaction but in entering
into agreement with those entities as well as with the state
trading companies or with private traders, the expectations
of the parties do not Vciry.
The considerations do not vary.

There is as

much difference in dealing from one government to another —
with one government as to another government as there is
between large company and small company, as between one
country and another country.

The differences'vary by all

•m

of these considerations.
I am saying that there simply is no reason for
making any distinction, in my view, between the obligations

and the rights of part:;-es dealing with foreign sovereigns
in the commercial context as opposed to when they deal with
private traders.
I cannot argue with Cuba when Cuba says that
government agencies will not lightly repudicite their
commercial transactions.

I take that to be a given,

particularly countries which engage in state trading on a
large scale, have a vital interest in protecting their
reputation in the international community.
But the same is true of the private trader in
the international community.

Indeed, in international

trade, perhaps more so, even, than in domestic trade,
because of the smaller opportunity for face-to-face contact,
trading reputations are of particular importance but I
suggest that those do riot vary.
The importance of that does not vary, depending
on whether one is dealing with a state trading agency or
with a significant private trading agency.
With the Court's permission, I should like to
reserve my last five minutes for rebuttal.

24

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTONIN SCALIA, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES
MR. SCALIAj

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The principle purpose of the government’s
appearing as amicus in the present case is to preserve the
vitality of a legal document which is not itself technically
at issue in the case but which the opinion of the court
below, if accepted by this Court, would effectively destroy.
I refer, of course, to the restrictive document
of sovereign immunity under which it is not all of the
activities of a foreign sovereign as to which that sovereign
will not be held accountable in our courts but rather only
those activities which are of a governmental as opposed to
a private nature.
At the time the famous Tate letter was issued
by the State Department in 1952, that modern doctrine of
sovereign immunity had already been adopted by virtually
all of the important trading nations of the west.

The

significant exceptions were England and the United Statens.
Since that time, only last November, in the
Philippine Admiral case, the Privy Council has made it
clear that England is no longer an exception.
It has likewise been assumed that the United
States is no longer an exception to the restrictive theory

25
of sovereign immunity.
Although the natter has never reached this
Court, it has been considered a number of times by lower
T

federal courts and by state courts.

Their decisions are

uniform in accepting it.
In view of those decisions, in view of the
Tate letter and in view of the deference which this Court
has normally accorded to the State Department's views in
this area of sovereign immunity, it has, I think, properly
been assumed that the applicable United States lav? does
adopt the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity.
Respondents have not asserted sovereign immunity
in the present case for the obvious reason that the
assertion would not. have been permitted»

Under the

restrictive theory,, the re are several other reasons why the
assertion may not have laid as well.
But clearly there was no way in which the
merchandising of tobacco or the receipt of an erroneous
payment in connection with that merchandising activity could
have been considered a governmental activity

rather than a

commercial activity on the part of the Respondent.
^

That being so, it would surely reduce the law
to''ineffectiveness and perhaps expose it to ridicule if the

j

Respondent, having been denied the claim of sovereign
immunity, were able to achieve precisely the same result by

26

simply appearing and repudiating the obligation as to the
very acts on which the claim of sovereign immunity was
denied.
Nothing occurred in this case except the
appearance of an attorney who, instead of asserting any
sovereign immunity, simply asserted that the Government of
Cuba would not honor the obligation and what is claimed is
that the effect of that statement should be the same as far
as the rights of these parties are concerned as the
assertion of sovereign immunity Under the old absolute
theory.
Respondent's reply brief seeks to calm our
fears on this point by assuring us that repudiation of a
commercial obligation will be unlikely.
Respondent says, and I am quoting his brief,
his reply brief to the government now, "It is only in the
unusual case and we suggest; primarily in the political case
in which this defense is called upon, that is the act of
state doctrine."
He continues,"It is likely that the more naked
the repudiation"-- that is, the more unconnected with
governmental functions --"the more political the background."
The trouble with all of these hopeful assurances
is that they are destroyed by the experience of this very
case.

There could not have been a more naked repudiation

27
than the mere statement of counsel in the case and as to the
high political background of the repudiation, it’s

non­

existence is shown by the fact that up until the point when
it was discovered that we were talking about a lot of money,
Cuba was willing to stipulate on the point and indeed did so.
That is one of the issues below.
So there is no

high political background here.

It is simply a question of a lot of money and until it was
clear that it involved a lot of money, Cuba didn't care
about the point.
I suggest, then, that despite what Respondent
asserts in the reply brief, if the theory of act of state
that Respondent is arguing in this case is adopted, that
we can expect the state trading nations to use it precisely
where they previously used the doctrine of absolute sovereign
immunity.

That is, wherever they do not wish to be held

liable.
How, then, can one avoid this absurd result of
on the one hand saying the foreign state has no sovereign
immunity but on the other saying,which, means the sovereign
must simply appear and Siy that it doesn’t want to pay.
In the view of the United States, it is
difficult not to avoid that result.

If one simply regards

the statement and the application of the act of state
doctrine as it has historically been described and applied

28
by this Court.
Respondents would have us believe that the act
of state doctrine applies to all acts of the sovereign
power but whether one chooses the old cases or the new ones,
whether one takes the formulation in Underhill

or in

Sahbatino, the description of the doctrine has always shown
that this is not so.
There have been qualifications, not simply a
statement that an act of state is not examinable.

In

Underhill, for example, the doctrine of act of state was
described as applicable to acts done

by sovereigns within

their own states in the exercise of governmental authority.
Two qualifications:

in their own states and in

the exercise of governmental authority.
In Sabbatino it was described as being applicable
to public acts of a recognized foreign sovereign power,
committed within its own territory.
There are, in other words, two conditions
attached.

The first is the territorial condition that the

act of state must have been performed within the government’s
own territory.
One may interpret that territorial condition
litex'ally, I suppose and if it is interpreted literally the
only act of state that appears on the record in the present
case occurred within the United States, consisting of the

29

statement of counsel for Cuba»
There is no evidence of any other action on, the
part of the government of Cuba.

The government — the United States, as
described in our brief
QUESTION:

Mr. Scalia, is that statement of the

lawyer's contradicted any place?
MR. SCALIAs

Up until now.

No, sir.. I don't believe there was

any contrary evidence educed to show that the lawyer was not
authorized and I think -QUESTION s

Is that true as of now?

MR. SCALIA:
*

yes, sir.

I believe that is true as of now,

I don't, think that the issue of v?hether the

statement of the lawyer was, in fact, authorized is really
present in this petition.

Of course, if he were not

authorised then the matter would be much simpler but for
purposes of the present case I think it is assumed that the
statement was authorized to be made by Cuba but nevertheless
the only act of

Cuba —

QUESTION:

Was the statement made to authorize

it made in Cuba?
MR. SCALIA::

that.
QUESTION:

MR. SCALIA:

QUESTION:

Well, has the government got any

contrary evidence of any kind?

X would assume they would

have shown it.
MR. SCALIA:

Contrary evidence to what effect,

sir?
QUESTION:

The fact that he wasn't talking about

the treaty.
MR. SCALIA:
QUESTION:

Yes, I think that is

correct.

And the fact that the government

hasn't produced it after all these years

leads roe to what

conclusion?
MR. SCALIA:

I think the conclusion that the

statement of the lawyer was authorized and again, I am not
contesting that.

But the point is, the only-action, the

only public act committed by Cuba as far as we know ~
surely, -the authorization to the lawyer, even if it was
given in Cuba, does not constitute a public act any more
than the authorization by the President to one of his
delegates in the United States for that delegate to do a
particular act constitutes the act itself.
QUESTION:
ask you one more

The act is —

Now that I have interrupted, I'll

question.

Do you want Sabbatino overruled

or not?

I thought that was what it was all
MR. SCALIA:

Yes, sir.

about.

Well, I think, as

described in the government's brief we think that the issue
of Sabbatino is not involved in this case because the act
of state doctrine, properly understood, is not involved in
this case.

There was no act of state, therefore, there is

no reason for Sabbatino to be presented to the Court in
this case.
If, however, the Court should disagree with
our interpretation of the act of state doctrine and if the
Court should find that when Sabbatino spoke of an act of
state it meant an act of state which could even consist of
a simple repudiation of a contractual obligation, then I
would assert that Sabbatino should be reexamined but there —•
on that point, whether there is --- whether a commercial
act can be an act of state but in the view of the government
there is really no need to get to that issue because it
would be reading Sabbatino to be unnecessarily wrong if one
were to read its description of act of state to include this
simple repudiation.
As I was saying, the Court’s decisions and the
application of the act of state doctrine have brought for­
ward two conditions, the territorial condition, which can be
interpreted literally or, as the government suggests in its
brief, perhaps can better be interpreted, not literally so

32
as to mean the act of state must be committed within the
if
territory of the state and/it is committed within that
territory, that is enough.

And if it is not, that is abso­

lutely conclusive that there is no act of state.
Rather, we think that the expression of
territoriality is really a description of the most common
situation in which the foreign governmental act constitutes
an act as to which there is such a preeminent claim of the
foreign government to exclusive legislative jurisdiction
over the matter that the courts of the United States should
not interpose our reexamination of that foreign state's
action.
But it is the second qualification to the act
of state doctrine which is, 1 think, squarely raised in the
present case and which is of most importance to the
government.

That is, the qualification that the act of

state is an act performed in the exercise of governmental
authority and that it is a public act.
Respondents would have us believe that these
qualifications mean nothing, that they are mere surplusage,
and entirely redundant, that when one says act of state, one
has Said it all.

So long

as the state has acted, that is it.

But the cases haven't described it that way.
They have felt constrained to say, an act of the state in
the exercise of its governmental authority or to say, public

33

acts of state.
I would assert, to the contrary of Respondent's
contention, that it is not the government's position on
''

this matter that is new or novel.

What is truly novel and

inventive is the repudiation which occurred in this case.
If the act of state doctrine indeed were under­
stood to be as Respondent represents it, it is indeed
marvelous that such a repudiation before an

American court

has never, to our knowledge, previously occurred.

That is

the novelty of the case, not the government's assertion of
what I believe has been understood to be the correct
interpretation of the act of state doctrine.
^

We assert, in other words, that the decision of
the Second Circuit in the Victory Transport case, which
involved precisely this issue, whether the denomination by
a state of a port in a commercial contract as a safe port
amounted to an act of Estate and therefore could not be
reexamined in litigation.
The Second Circuit held, of course, that the
denomination of a safe port in a contract is a commercial
act which merchants

W

do all the time.

The mere fact that it

was done by a state or by a state-trading agency makes no
difference and does not prevent the government from — excuse
me, does not prevent the courts from inquiring into the case.
QUESTION:

Does that opinion address any

34
distinction between the Second Circuit opinion and this case?
MR, SCAL1AExcuse me, sir?
QUESTION:
was also a

Does that opinion — you said that

Second Circuit decision?
MR, SCALIA;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir,
And did that opinion address any

distinctions?
MR. SCALIA;
QUESTION;

That

an earlier opinion, sir.

In the Second Circuit, the State

Department took the position that they weren't going to
intervene because the court matter was pending, Sabbatino,
The court asked for the State Department’s
opinion and the State Department said,

"Since this is a

court matter, we won't give you our opinion."
Remember that?
MR, SCALIA;

Yes.

But the position of the

State Department in the; present case is --- it has not sought
to intervene in the. present; case here.
The position of the government on the matter
is simply that the interpretation we are urging of the
act of state doctrine is in the interest of the executive
branch and should be adopted by the courts for the simple
reason that the two purposes sought to be achieved by the
act of state doctrine are neither of them served by
application of the doctrine to commercial transactions

35
because if you are concerned about that, first of all, the
avoidance of embarrassment

to

United States' foreign

policy, the Tait letter makes it clear that thjxre is no
such embarrassment in the case of commercial transactions
and it

is made further clear by the Appendix to the

government's brief in this case.
The second purpose, the purpose of enabling the
Court to avoid cases which do not have manageable legal
standards, that purpose also is not served by adopting an
active state doctrine in the commercial field which is almost
a prototype of a field where there are manageable legal
standards.
QUESTION:

Mr. Scalia, does any country that you

know of concede or admit today that it applies the act of
state doctrine to commercial transactions?
MR. SCALIA:

It: is said that the act of state

doctrine is applied by a number of other countries but their
application is a good deal less clear than our own has been
and I am unaware of any statement by another country that it
applies to commercial transactions.

I am just guarding that

statement with the faci: theifc I tend to think the application
by other countries has been a good deal less rational than
our

at least their description of it has been a good deal

less rational than our own in any event.
QUESTION:

You mean generally.

36
MR. SCALIA;
QUESTION:

Generally.
It may be de facto in its application

perhaps without conceding that that in fact is what is being
done.
MR. SCALIAs

I am certain that there are cases

in foreign countries in which, in a commercial transaction,
where what Respondent would call an act of state has
occurred.

The foreign court has given no regard -— has not

given it any special treatment.
I see that my time has expired.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF VICTOR RABXNONITZ, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. RABINOWITZ:

[Mr. Chief Justice axxd may it

please the Court.]
I am glad that I can find one point of agreement
with the government in this case in the assertion that the
Sabbatino case is not involved in this litigation.
I agree completely with that statement.

I think

that my analysis is different but I think I can agree that the
Sabbatino case, the issue of the Sabbatino case need not be
and in fact, as I understand the situation, cannot be reached
on this issue.
Let me first address myself to what has been the

37

principle burden of the Petitioner's argument, namely, was
there an

act of state by the government of Cuba and what

was it?
Yes, there was an act of state and the act of
state was the intervention decree of September 16th, 1960
#

and everything that has happened since that time has been
based on that intervention decree.
Of course, it was not a single act.

act of state doctrine

I!m

I don't want to take too much time

on this.
"Under the act of state doctrine, the Cuban
Government in accepting, expropriating, seizing, nationaliz­
ing, whatever word you want, to take this money, has done
so pursuant to a regulation, a law, a decree of the
Government of Cuba and therefore the courts of this state
will not look into the matter nor will the federal court."
"Now, I am not talking about the extraterritorial
effect of an act of state.

I am talking about a territorial

effect, namely, the seizure or the acceptance or the
appropriation of this money when it got down to Cuba.
"We are not concerned with whether they
expropriated

debts on September 15th.

The question is

what happened on October 1st and October 15th and November 8th
and December 12th when the money came down.

At that time

the Cuban Government took this money and under the act of
state doctrine it belongs to the Cuban Government."
And the decree to which counsel was referring
in that case was, of course, the nationalization decree
of September 15th, I960 and not to any other act of state

39
which counsel made up or created or passed for the benefits
of his argument.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rabinowitz, would you agree that

\

your characterization in that part of the transcript of the
act of state is quite different from your characterization
when you said"For seven long years it has been asserting
that its repudiation of the debt was its act of state"?
They are two quite different concepts,, are they
not?
MR. RABINOWITZ:

I don't think they are two

different concepts, your Honor.
QUESTION:

But the debt couldn't have arrived

until the money arrived.
MR. RABINOWITZ:

I do think that they are

different formulations, at least in my mind.
different!formulations of the same problem.

They were
The repudiation

of which we spoke there: was not a naked repudiation of a
commercial debt.

It wasn't a repudiation which was created

in a vacuum.
At all times it has been clear that the Cuban
position has been based on the intervention decree of 1960
and there was never any suggestion that there was any
subsequent action —
QUESTION:

But Mr. Rabinowitz, the debt did not

exist at the time of the decree.

Isn't that correct?

40

MR. RABINOWITZ:

Well, I don't know whether the

debt existed at the tine of the decree.
QUESTION:

Well, what were you referring to as

the debt when you referred to the repudiation of the debt
in your brief?
MR. RABINOWITZ:

The debt that we are talking

about as a result of the rather strange way in which this
case is developed -- this debt that we are talking about, I
suppose perhaps was not created.
QUESTION:

It is clear that that referred to

your obligation to return the money that had been delivered
to Cuba.

That is what you are talking about there.
MR. RABINOWITZ:

But the obligation, the debt

was not — the debt is Dunhill’s
QUESTION:

— was not created until —

That debt should not exist at the

time of the decree.
MR. RABINOWITZ:
QUESTION:

Pardon me?

That debt should not exist at the time

of the decree.
MR. RABINOWITZ:

That debt I would say did not

exist until the district court handed down its opinion in
1970.
QUESTION:

Well, but that is just another way of

saying it did not exist at the time of the decree.
MR. RABINOWITZ:

I suppose that that is true.

41
QUESTION :

The are f ore, the decree could not be

the repudiation of a subsequently-ereated debt.
MR. RABINQT7XTZ :

Well, perhaps the word

"repudiation" was an unwise one.

The Cuban Government from

the very beginning has taken the position that this money
belonged to it.

It belonged to it and it collected the

money in, much as the receiver who is appointed by a court
in the United States and given authority to take over the
property and the assets of a company will acquire and will
take in and will take title to accounts receivable or other
money that happened to come into his possession.

An

interventor is very like a receiver, except that it is an
executive rather than a judicial officer and the functions
that he was to perform under the intervention decree were
precisely to take into his possession all of the property
of the intervened company.
Now, when that money came down into Cuba, it
took it.
When subsequently —
QUESTION:

Again, Mr. Rabinowits, was it at that

time property of the intervened company?
I think it has been held that it was not.
MR. RABINOWITZ:

Cube* claimed that it was

property of the intervened company, of course.
There was some question at that time --- I suppose

42

there might have been a question, was this property of the
intervened company or was it property of the former owners?
No one dreamed at that point that it would turn
out to be property of Dunhill.
anybody dreamed of it.

At least, I don't think

Dunhill didn't even make a claim to

this money until 1969 on the last day of the trial in
district court Dunhill came in and amended its answer to
claim the money.

It hadn't

even claimed it up to that time.

At this point it became apparent as a result of
what developed in the trial that a possible outcome of this
complex set of affairs would be that Cuba would be directed
to pay the money back to Dunhill.

Up to this point it had

never even demanded it.
QUESTION:

The short of it

is, though, that

if you were correct as to what — as to the consequences of
the intervention, your argument certainly should be and I
suppose it was, that this‘so-called debt should never have
been cidjudicated.
MR. RABINOWITZ:

QUESTION:

That you didn't owe

MRa RABINOWITZ:
QUESTION:

Certainly.

anything.

That was our position as —

Because it was your money in the

first place.
MR. RABINOWITZ:
QUESTION:

Exactly.

But those judgments, the judgments of

43
the court still stand,

I take it, that you owed the money

and was it your claim — I thought that was what you claimed
in your response

to your petition for certiorari, that even

if you owed it, you repudiated it.
MR. RABINOWITZ:
what we claimed.

Oh, I don't think that that was

What we claimed was that we didn't owe it

because it was an act of state.
QUESTION:

Well, did the Court of Appeals

suggest that if you. owed the money you nevertheless had
repudiated the debt as an act of state?
MR. RABINOWITZ:

In the Court of Appeals we

made what I considered then and still consider to be an
alternative argument and it is a very broad argument and I
don’t find it necessary to repeat it here and it was picked
up by the Court of Appeals and was accepted by the Court
of

Appeals which may be the reason for all of the trouble

here now.
The Court of Appeals took a very broad position
and as I read the opinion and, incidentally, I wasn’t alone
in so doing, it followed the decision of the New York Court
of Appeals in the French case and quoted from it, I think,
extensively and it. took the position at that time that any
repudiation, any refusail of: a sovereign to pay a debt was
an act of state.
QUESTION:

Well, now, you defended that judgment

44
in your response to your petition for certiorari»
MR. RABIN0T7ITZ

I would defend that judgment

here today if I had to.
QUESTION:

Yes, but you did in your response to

your petition for certiorari.
MR. RABINOWITZ;
QUESTION:

I suppose I did.

Yes.

MR. RABINOWITZ:

Yes, and I would do it today

and I think it was an accurate, a sound decision, but I
don't believe I have to go that far.

I don't think I have

to go nearly that far because I think that we have here a
long time prior to that position a clear and unequivocal
act of state which has resulted in Cuba's contention that it
was entitled to this money from the very beginning.

It was

claiming the money as a result of the intervention decree
and it was therefore entitled to the money under the act of
state document.
QUESTION:

On that basis you claim that there

shouldn't have been any set-off either, I take it.
MR. RABINOWITZ:

On that basis I claim that

there shouldn't have been any set-off and that issue, your*
Honor, is raised in the petition —
QUESTION:
,

In your petition —

MR. RABINOWITZ:

— for certiorari which this

Court has up to this.point at least refused to either —-

45
QUESTION:

I understand, I understand.

MR., RABINOWITZ:

Exactly.

QUESTION:

It is one way or the other, isn't it?

QUESTION:

On that basis, there never was any

V

debt.

Is that right?
MR. RABINOWITZ:

On that basis there never was

any debt, yes, sir, and I argued that in my petition for
certiorari and so far the Court has not passed upon that
and I wish it would.

But —

QUESTION:

Well, it may be we will.

MR. RABINOWITZ:

I am getting a little tired of

this case.
[Laughter.]
Now, I think that that is of importance here
because I have apparently been charged with having, as I say,
committed an

act of state and it is not an offense to which

I am prepared to plead guilty.
That ’really is the iss/ue that I see in this
case.

Was there an act of state?

The answer is yes,

What was the act of state?

Here it was, Cuba

is entitled to this money and is under no obligation to pay
it back.

I think we are entitled to a lot of other money

as we11 but that can await disposition of the petition for
certiorari.
Remember, I said here last time that I didn't

46

even think this petition for certiorari should have been
granted .

I thought the whole thing was a mistake.

The

Court obviously does not see it my way or I wouldn’t be here
now and so I am not stressing that point at this time.
The Court, when it originally granted the
petition for certiorari here the first time put forth a
second question.

That second question said, assuming an

act of state may petition again an affirmative judgment on
its counterclaim in the circumstances of this case — I am
not reciting the full language of it.
Nov/, I am not going to discuss that here unless
the Court wants me to.
Respondent.

It was not raised at all by

It is fully discussed in the brief.

I think

that the'question assumes something which is not a fact,
namely, that this Court in the National City Bank case
adopted our so-called

counter claim" ruled, as I recall

the situation there were only four judges, only one judge
who opted for a clear counter claim rule and that was
Mr. Justice Douglas.

Three judges opted for a counter claim

rule when supported by a

State Department letter and the

other five judges voted aoainst it altogether so I am not
going to discuss it because as I said, I think that counsel
hasn't urged the point and I don't want to build a non­
existent argument here.
The order for reargument, however, and the

47
Government's brief here do raise two very important inter­
national law questions.

I don't believe that either of them

are raised on the second but they are interesting.

I think

it is a mistake for a court to decide questions just
because they are interesting.
I think that the rule that a court should
decide only the cases before it is a salutory rule.
However interested we may be in the broader
questions, those broader questions will get here soon
enough.

They are back in the District Court in the

Southern District of New York.

We are going to be here with

them, I think sometime pretty soon and all of the questions
about the National City Bark cases, the Sabbatino case and
so forth, will be here and sufficient unto the day.
But these issues were raised by the Court and
the

Solicitor General and I think that out of respect I

should answer them.

All that the Sabbatino case did was to say

that the act of state doctrine was not a defense when it
was alleged that the act was a violation of international
lav;.
It is net my understanding that the dissenting
opinion in the Sabbatino case or any of the other

49
academicians who have written extensively on the subject
of the Sabbatino case have ever urged that the act of state
doctrine should be abolished or that the act of state
doctrine was wrong., but merely that the Sabbatino decision
was wrong in failing to allow an international law exception.
QUESTION:

Let s assume that in a case the act

of state doctrine is raised

as a defense to an action

and the other side says, we:!!* it shouldn't be a defense
because this is a violation of international law.
Now, Sabbatino, you suggest, says that that
prior response isn't worth very much.
MR. RABINOWITZ:
QUESTION:

That's right.

Now, if it were worth something and

the act of state doctrine would not bar an action if it
were in violation of international lav; you have to go through
the process of deciding whether it would be in violation of
international law.
MR. RABINOWITZs
QUESTION:

Yes, certainly.

And if it is decided that the act

doesn't violate interactional lav/, the act of state doctrine
is a defense.
MR. RABINOWITZ:

I read the Solicitor

General's brief, that is the issue that it is interested in.

51
It is not interested in the intervention and it says speci­
fically that it is not taking any position on Cuba’s
contention that it had the right to receive and retain the
funds on the basis of the intervention decree.
Rather, it assumes that we have here what it
refers to as a "naked repudiation of a commercial obligation"
or something like that and it says that the act of state
doctrine should not apply to that kind of a dispute.
Now, this is a major innovation in

our law.

The act of state doctrine has never been so limited up to
this point.
QUESTION:

Well, perhaps the act of state

doctrine itself was an innovation when it came along,,
wasn’t it?
MR. RABINOWITZ:

Well, of course, of course

and I am not suggesting that innovations are as appropriate
once in a while as our law develops.
QUESTION;

Does that have any basis except for

the national interest of a country when a foreign sovereign
comes into our courts asking for the benefits of our legal
system?
MR. RABINOWITZ:

Well, I think now you are

getting into the counter claim problem which is a somewhat
different one and I think that Mr. Justice Brennan’s answer
to that in the National City Bank case was an adequate one

.

i

52
and it was namely that wher, he asks for our system of laws
he is asking among other things for the act of state
doctrine and that the reasons for the act of state doctrine
have nothing to do with the convenience of the foreign
sovereign.

It has to c'!o with our own problems, our own

division of responsibilities between the executive and. the
judicial branch of the government and while it may be true
that we don't want to insult foreign sovereigns, the
important burden of the Sabbatino decision, and I think of
the dissent in

the City Bank case was that the important

problem was the embarassraent in between the executive
branches and the judicial branches of the government
rather than the embarrassment between the United States
and some foreign country.
QUESTIONs

In other words, it was a matter of

deference by the judiciary towards the foreign policy pro­
blems of the executive branch.
MR. RABIMOWITZ:

No, sir, I would say that it

was an effort on the part of the judiciary to maintain its
independence by not putting itself in a political position
which

would make it very difficult for it to do so and

if your Honor would take a reference on that, I think that
in my last brief in the response to the government's brief
I cited in a rather extensive footnote the comments by
former Attorney General Kat zenbach in discussing the

53
Rosemarie case in which he pointed to a notorious example
in which the judiciary of Great Britain was forced into a
position where it had to make a finding in one way or the
other on an issue because the government had so committed
itself to that position that to have done otherwise would
have resulted in a very serious conflict between the
judiciary and the governmer t and this is precisely what I
think the act of state doctrine is designed, among other
things, to accomplish,
But when we get. to the question of political
versus commercial obligations and the government's, I say,
contention that we now should have a restrictive theory of
act of state, the government's contention here is based on
first the government says that this is, I think primarily,
that this is by analogy, by analogy to the restrictive
theory of sovereign immunity.
We have a restrictive theory of sovereign
immunity, a theory which, incidentally, has never been
passed upon by this Court and therefore we should have a
restrictive theory of act of state as well and the
restrictive theory is, as formulated by the Tate letter and
State Department, was that sovereign immunity should not
apply to jure gestionis or commercial transactions, business
transactions I guess would be a better translation, but
should apply only to jure imperii.

54
Now, that distinction which was established by
the state letter — by the Tate letter, has not had the kind
of a history that should commend itself to its extension,
almost
Every commentator as far — or/every commentator
discussing that question has found it very difficult to
make this distinction.

The usual example given is the
\

contract by which a government buys shoes for its army.
The government in its brief in this case says
well, that is obviously a commercial transaction.
The Court of Appeals in the Victory Transport
case said it finds such a contention astonishing,

it is

obviously a governmental action.
The fact of the matter is that the dichotomy
between commercial and political or

commercial and business

and government is, in the era in which we live, a false one
because there are many acts which are both commercial and
highly political.
We need only read the newspapers to see that
large numbers of our commercial transactions,, whether it
be oil from the middle east or it be wheat to Russia or it
be copper from the Allende-operated copper mines in Chile —all of these which on their surface appear to be commercial
transactions, in

effect, have tremendous political

implications and therefore, what I suggest is a slick and an
easy distinction between the two, is one that should be

55

accepted with a great deal of caution.
Now, let's take this case.

Counsel various times

in briefs here have referred to this as a commercial
transaction.

As I did my test to point out this morning,

this was not a commercial transaction at all.

It was a

transaction not involving a debt between tobacco merchants,
as someone put xt in one of the briefs, but a transaction
which arose out of —■ it was one of a long series of
political decrees in the Republic of Cuba in the course of
the transformation of the economic, social and political
system of that government which took place beginning in 1960
and, I suppose, extendi.ng light on into the present.
This intervention decree was one of many
intervention decrees which nationalised private property
in Cuba.

In no sense was it a commercial transaction.
■Since that time, Cuba has engaged in extensive

commercial transactions between tobacco merchants.

As a

matter of fact, one of the best of the customers of Cuba
throughout the world is DunhiXl, which purchases cigars in
large numbers and sells them throughout

Canada

and England

and perhaps in other pc.rts of i;.he world without any problem
about commercial repudiation of debts or anything like that.
Those are ordinary commercial transactions.
questions are raised about sovereign immunity.

No

That act of

state, when there is a dispute about whether the cigars are

56

wormy or not wormy or whatever else happens to cigars, the
disputes are settled in the normal course»
sovereign immunity.

Nobody pleads

Nobody pleads acts of state.

The

\

business goes on in a perfectly normal way.
This is not that kind of a transaction at all.
This transaction was a transaction that was originally a
transaction which expropriated ■— in which Cuba expropriated
the property, not of Dunhill, expropriated the property of
its own citizens.
It was a politi,cal act and in no way a commer­
cial act and that has been the guts and the source and the
origin of the problem that existed here.
The formulation that Mr. Justice Stevens
referred to awhile ago in, I believe it was a brief in
petition to

opposition to the petition for certiorari,

must be read, I submit, in, against the background of this.
It wasn't ci mere repudiation of commercial debt.
It was an old position that had been taken froiti the very
beginning.
I think that the origin of the formulation which
I agree now was an unfortunate one is due to the fact that
at that time we were talking about a court of appeals
decision.

We ware trying to dissuade this Court from

issuing certiorari to review a court of appeals decision
and we used the language that perhaps the court of appeals

57
used but certainly it was never regarded by anyone as a
commercial as distinguished from a political transaction.
Nov;, the fact is that the restricted theory of
sovereign immunity which the government places a great deal
of reliance on has not been applied at all by the State
Department in delicate and difficult and troublesome
situations.
X referred to, in my brief, to three notorious
cases in which this is true.

In Rich against Navdera Vacuba,

in Spacil against Crowe and I believe in Isbrandtsen
against President of India, there were three transactions
which were perfectly normal, every day commercial trans­
actions involving sale of copper, the sale of wheat and an
attachment by a longshoreman who wanted wages and in everyone
of those cases, the State Department filed a suggestion of
immunity in direct contradiction to the Tate letter and when
it was asked to explain, it said, "We don’t have to explain.
That is executive discretion.
thing.

We can apply the

We don’t have to explain any­

Tate letter or not apply the Tate

letter, as we wish."
Nov, I respectfully suggest that this is not a
rule of law
thought,

that should he automatically, without mud's more

be extended to the act of state doctrine.
There is a great deal of difference between

sovereign immunity and act of state.

Sovereign immunity

58

never goes to the merits of a situation at all*

Sovereign

immunity merely relates to a question of jurisdiction and it
has, in historical terms, a base involving eommity between
nations, the fact that a country might be insulted if it was
sued in the courts of the United States, thcit this is an
affront to a foreign sovereign to sue it in the United States
We have a doctrine of sovereign immunity in our
own laws affecting the right of a citizen to sue the United
States*

It is modified by statute but still a doctrine which

in the absence of statute, exists*
There is nothing strange or revolutionary or
restrictive about the ancient doctrine of sovereign immunity*
The act of state doctrine is quite a different
matter*

Mow we are. concerned, and for the first time, unlike

in the sovereign immunity case, we are concerned with
passing on the question of the validity, vel non of the act
of a foreign sovereign.

This is the question that never

arises in connection with sovereign immunity.

It will, I

think, always arise in connection with act of state.
It is only in the act of state area that we get
to the question of the merits of the controversy.

In the

sovereign immunity situation we stop at the very beginning
and say, either we have jurisdiction or we don't have
jurisdiction.
When we get to act of state, the problem is a

59

much more serious one «md £is I say, it seems to me that the
extension of a sovereign immunity doctrine which has not
been noticeable for its success should not be made so
quickly to the act of state area and particularly is that
true because so far as this case is concerned, as I have
pointed out, I do not believe we have in any sense of the
word a commercial transaction.
It is a political transaction,

I suppose it has

commercial aspects just like many political acts have
commercial aspects but primarily and in its essence, the
issue that was raised here is a political issue and not a
commercial issue and the extension of the doctrine of
sovereign immunity will, raise all sorts of problems,
I don’t know how the courts could have
handled Rich against Naviera Vacuba had it not been for the
wise judgment of the State Department in filing a suggestion
of immunity in that case in clear violation of the Tate
letter because it would have resulted in a most difficult
and troublesome problem.

The matter is discussed at great

length in ray brief and in texts that I have referred to in
the brief and I think it will appear clear there that the
Court would have been placed in an intolerable position had
it not been for the St cite Department bailing it out with the
suggestion of immunity.
QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Rabinowitz, your argument

60

on the sovereign immunity point seems to be that you approve
of this sort of discretion in the State Department to on
occasion invoke sovereign immunity.
MR. RABINOWITZ

If I had my choice, I would

prefer an absolute theory of sovereign immunity.
QUESTION;

Nonetheless you are willing to toler­

ate it in the area of sovereign immunity.
MR. RABINOWITZ ;

I am willing to tolerate it

because no one has got -- if you proceed with the theory of
restrictive immunity, then there has to be an escape hatch.
There must be an escape hatch.

Otherwise, hov/ do we

QUESTION;

MR. RABINOWITZ:.

Well, I think not, with all due

I do not faelreve, and I was going to

come to that

in a little while in connection with the latest Bernstein
letter -- I suppose we call it the Lee letter now — and I
was going to come to that and I will in a few minutes.
I think that the necessity of having an escape
hatch, a door out to save the Court from, really, a very
serious embarrassment in the Naviera Vacuba situation, is an

I

61

unfortunate thing in that it would have been saved had we
had an absolute theory of sovereign immunity to begin with.
We didn't and therefore we had to find this alternative
method.

I think it would be better if we didn’t have to

find it because we may not always have a

State Department

as alert to the needs of the situation as existed at that
time.
In any event, I would have preferred not to
have to rely on executive discretion, concerned as it is
with many political

considerations in a situation like that.

However, really, what I, in closing on this
point, I just want to say what counsel has already refuted
before I said it, I don't believe that the doctrine of act
of state or the doctrine of sovereign immunity is part of
the arsenal of the trading nation.
I think that most trading nations rely upon
act of state or sovereign immunity in only very rare
situations and only when I suggest the political issue is
somewhere hidden deep.

would say it is probably true as a

generality.
Only when there is a political issue which is
hidden deep in the background of the case, which makes it
difficult to defend the case on other grounds and therefore
the Court must -- the Defendant must rely on one of the

62

other defenses.
The letter of the legal advisor in this case is
not clear whether it is a part of the Justice Department's
brief or not.

This legal advisor, unlike his predecessors

in the Bernstein case and the City Bank case, makes very'
broad pronouncements of State Department policy which look
far into the future.
The last sentence of his brief, for example, is
"It is our view that if the; Court should decide to overrule
the holding in Sabbatino so that acts of state would there­
after be subject to adjudication in American courts under
international law, we would not anticipate embarrassment
to the conduct of the future policy of the United States."
We congratulate the State Department on its
ability to see

so clearly into the future.

That talent

was unfortunately not shared by its predecessor State
Departmenta.
The State Department, in the Sabbatino case,

Sabbatino case in argument before this Court.

It opposed any changes in the doctrine in opposing the
Hickenlooper Amendment.
Attorney General F.atxenbaeh, as I said, has
written extensively on the subject since and it is obvious
that other State Departments have not been able to see the

63

future as clearly as the present State Department does.
QUESTION:

In how many countries, Mr. Rabiniwitz,

is the act of state doctrine or its substantial equivalent
followed by the courts?
MR. RABINOWITZ:
difficult to tell.

Your Honor, it is very

Foreign decisions are not readily

assimilable to ours.

If you’ll look at the example of the

Anglo Iranian cases you'll find that the Italian and
Japanese cases came to the same conclusion, came to an
act of state conclusion even though they didn't refer to
act of state, they referred to other grounds.
QUESTION:

Does Cuba apply it?

MR. RABINOWITZ:
in Cuba

I don't know of any decision

at all.
I might say’, the government makes a great play

of the foreign decisions.

I might say that foreign law

differs from the law of the United States in many respects
and I think that the law of the United States is vastly
superior to the lav of many foreign countries and the fact
that other countries do not adopt the act of state doctrine
does not seem to me to be decisive

as to what we ought to

do.

We have our own

We have our ova Constitution.

relationship between judiciary and executive.

The indepen­

dence of the judiciary is, to us, a very critical point in
our existence and in our constitutional structure and the

64
act of state doctrine nay not be so important to other
countries which have different constitutions and different
traditions.
MOW; I, in jus-; closing with respect to the
Lee letter and really in respose to what Mr. Justice
Rehnquist said a little while ago, I don't believe that this
Court can be expected to follow the State Department around
when one State Department says, "We consider the act of
state doctrine to be essential to the independence of the
judiciary,” this Court is supposed to say,

"Yes, we think

so, too."
And when another State Department comes

along

and says, "We don't think the act of state doctrine or the
Sabbati.no doctrine hais any significance whatsoever.

We

don't anticipate any embarrassment in the future," I don't
believe that this Court: is supposed to say, "That’s right
also."
QUESTION:

But you are perfectly willing to

have us follow the State Department around in the area of
sovereign immunity.
MR. RABINOWITZ:
Honor.

I am not willing to do it, your

I don't have a choice.
QUESTION:

here, either.
[Laughter.]

Well, you may not have a choice

65
MR. RABINOWITZj

That may be.

I don't personally have a choice.

1 don't mean that

I think that the State

Department, the Ex Rarte Peru doctrine and its
)

me put it this way.

well, let

The doctrine which seems to be

followed by many of the district courts, namely, that the
State Department's view not: only

as to the granting of

immunity but as to the denial of immunity is conclusive.
I would suggest that that doctrine would be
unnecessary if we had a theory of sovereign immunity.
Now, since we --- I mean, an absolute theory of
sovereign immunity.
Now, since we have a restricted theory of
I

sovereign immunity which for reasons X have just set forth
I don’t think is workable, we have to find a way out because
it is not workable and so we have these letters such as the
suggestions which were filed in the Spacil case, Naviera
Vacuba and Isbrandtsen case:, all of which appeared on their
face to be commercial transactions but the State Department
apparently held that they were political.
I’d like not to get to Sabbatino.

As I said a

few moments ago, the Sabbafcino case held that the act of
fe

state doctrine will apply even when the question at issue is
alleged to be — or the act in question is alleged to be. a
violation of international law and therefore we met at the
threshold with a problem so far as this case is concerned.

What is the question of international law in
this case?
Counsel for the Petitioner has been able to
suggest no question of international lav? at all.
QUESTION:

Unless you reconsider, there is

nothing to talk about on that.
MR. RABINOWITZ:
reconsider?

Well,’ what is there to

If there —
QUESTION:

Well, there is nothing to talk about.

I mean, if you are going to consider whether there is a
question of international law, you are not obeying Sabbatino
You

are not supposed to go into the merits of the

international law question..
MR. RABINOWITZ:

I'm sorry.

We misunderstand

each other or I misunderstand you, perhaps.
QUESTION:

It could be either weiy.

MR. RABINOWITZ;

Could be.

Under the Uabbatino decision, as I understand it
when an act of state is alleged, it is no response -- or an
act of state is pleaded as a defense it is no response to
say — not a valid response to say, the act of state
doctrine is not applicable in this case because there is a
violation of international law.
That is what the Court held, as I understand it,
in Sabbatino and it is on that issue that your Honor

67
dissented.
Therefore, the problem here as to whether the
Sabbatino decision applies — and I might say that nobody
I

even mentioned Sabbatino in the lower courts in this case.
It wasn't until the reargument in this Court that anybody
even dreamed for a moment that Sabbatino had anything to do
with this case and the reason that nobody dreamed that
Sabbatino had anything to do with the case was because the
first step was never taken, namely, Cuba pleaded act of
state and no one said, your act of state is a violation of
international law and no one said it because there is no
grounds for saying it.

}

QUESTION:

But might they not have refrained

from saying it because they considered Sabbatino as being
binding?
MR. RABINGh'ITZ:

I would doubt it, your Honor.

It is possible.

But even now, when the Court

has directed that the matter be reargued no one has been
able to point to a respect in which the act of state that we
are talking about is a violation cf international law.

Even

now no one claims that it is a violation of international
|

law.
It is true that the Petitioner, because the
Court asked him to consider the question and therefore he
had to do it, he says, oh, there is a violation of

at the time about whether this money belonged to the former

dispute about whether it belonged to Dunhill.

the money and it was paid.
^

No question of international raised yet.
Finally we get to the district court because
that is the next thing that, happened and the district court

That was what they had to

for certiorari that is pending before your Honors.
But Dunhill said, now argued that, well, if we
have to pay the former owners, then we paid this money by
mistake and we want it back and so the court issued a decree.

69

Well, a decree of the United States Court does
not transform an act of Cuba done in Cuba from an act
which is consistent with international law to an act which
is inconsistent with international lav/.

7vt no point here —

I'm sorry, my time is up — at no point here have we had
any definitions of the illegal act which would give rise to
any question at all as to vrhether the Sabbatino decision
applies,
QUESTION:

if you just looked at what the court of appeals held, that

state, if there was one, was in the repudiation

of some later debt.

about that?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF VICTOR S. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Thank you, Mr, Chief Justice.

I'd like to start by picking up Mr. Justice
|

White's comments.
The reason that nobody in the courts below ever
took up Cuba on the question of whether or not there had
been some violation of international lav? was very simply
that in our view, and the view of the other parties to the
case, no act of stcite was ever shown in the courts below.
The only thing that we had on the record that
was ever asserted as an act of state against the importers
were statements by counsel talking of the repudiation that

|

Cuba would not pay back to the importers any judgments
entered against it.
There was no act of stats at that time asserted
against the importers.

There was nothing to which anyone

72
could point and say, that is a violation of international
law.
The first time an act of state was defined,
really, in this case was by the court of appeals and there
for the first time the suggestion was that it was the
repudiation of the claim, the unjust enrichment claim of
Dunhill that Cuba had evidenced through statements of counsel
at the trial.
That, we suggest, if the issue need
can constitute a violation of international law.

be reached,
It is

nothing more than a discriminatory taking of property
belonging to Dunhill which erroneously found its way to
Cuba.
Now, if thcit property were the property of the
owners rather than of Dunhill, as counsel for Cuba maintains,
then the decree should havt. said, Cubit owes that money back
to the owners, not the pass-through that puts Dunhill in the
untenable position that, the court of appeals rulings have
done.
Let me return now to the — again, to the issue
that I still consider critical and that is, just precisely
what was the act of state in this case?
I now have gathered that Cuba's position is that
the act of state was, in fact, a decree, that everything
that flowed, whether it. was a taking of the money as it

73
reached Cuba ox- whether it was the subsequent repudiation
of the obligation — all of that arose somehow similarly out
of the original decree which seized the accounts.
But Dunhill is put in an absolutely untenable
position by that reasoning.

The courts below have held that

the decree was ineffective to seize the account and that
therefore when Dunhill paid the money to Cuba, it was
to the wrong party.

paid

That is precisely what has put Dunhill

in the position it now finds itself.
I suggest that for the Court to find that some­
how the act of state was the decree itself and charge Dunhill
with that as a valid act of state unrelated to a commercial
transaction is to fly in the face of the key holdings of
the court below and not deal with all of the issues that
are presented in the case.
If the Court is to get to the issue of whether
or not that decree was the act of state, I see no way it
can do it without granting or dealing, at least, with the
other petitions for certiorari and that iirxcludes both Cuba's
cross-petition as well as the conditional cross“petition
of the importers.
I'd like to talk just for a minute about the
comments that counsel for Cuba has made on the difference
between the act of state and sovereign immunity and why it
is inappropriate to apply the principles of one doctrine

74
into the other.
We had suggested in our brief and we submit now
that when you are dealing with a sovereign who is acting in
a commercial context, the question of whether or not it can
interpose sovereign immunity defense or act of state defense
because it wants to repudiate that obligation has no
difference.
I think this case illustrates it well.

Other

cases, certainly the same is true.
Now, the question here is not whether an act
of state is valid.

The only question here is whether the

act of state asserted can be used as a defense to justify
a repudiation of otherwise commercial transactions.
I'd like also to comment on the inability that
counsel for Cuba finds to make the distinction between the
commercial and the political transaction which we have
suggested in somewhat different terms in our argument.
The fact that there may be difficult cases such
as shoes for the military c.oes not mean that the basic
distinction between commercial and political transactions
cannot be made and obviously in this case nobody would
suggest that the purchase and sale of cigars? was anything
other than a normal commercial transaction.
QUESTION s

Mr. Friedman, would you contend that

the intervention of the cigar companies was a commercial or

75
a political transaction?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Oh, I would concede that that was

a political transaction.
QUESTION:

That that was political.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes.

By the same; token, there are obviously easy
cases on the other sides where nobody would argue that the
act of the foreign state was clearly a political act
unrelated to its commercial activity but with the volume of
normal commercial activities being carried on by state
trading agencies throughout the "world today, it is folly to
suggest

that in most

say, this

is a commercial transaction and should be treated,

and the sovereign should be treated as though it is a party
to a commercial transaction, not a sovereign exercising some
kind of sovereign rights.

you win a judgment over and above the

amount of the set-off,

how are you supposed to collect it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
on that.

Well, let me — I want to comment

Counsel for Cuba has suggested that we have perhaps

abandoned the second argument on which we relied in the
first instance.

That is net so.

I simply did not want to

repeat our position in that regard and that, you will recall,
deals with the question of whether, given the nature of these

76

cases against the importers, that they all can be treated
as one.
QUESTION: In what?
MR. FRIEDMAN: For purposes of pool.

^

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

And that v?ouId be one way.

There

may be other ways in terms of —
QUESTION:

So you, in effect, would put it

within the prior —- within the First National City Bank?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is right.

In that sense it

falls within the First National City Bank if you treat this
whole case as a pool because on balance there is mors money

going from the importers as a group to —
QUESTION:

But the situation hasn't changed since

you were here last.
MR. FRIEDMAN':
QUESTION:
question.

No.

No, it has not, your Honor.

Mr. Friedman, let me ask one more

If you view the act of state as the retention of

the payments pursuant to the decree, as Cuba argues, even
though you say we must grant your cert petition if we do
that, but in that event, would the act be commercial or
)

political?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

In that event, your Honor, I

would still hold that the act is commercial because to the
extent that Cuba were to say that it was retaining payments

made in the normal commercial sense, I don't see any
difference between a retention of payments or even if it
were a decree saying, we seize the payments,

if that arises

out of a course of commercial dealings, I see no difference.
Let me give a different example, if I may»

Let's

suppose the transaction were an equal transaction where goods
were going down to Cuba.
It seems to me it makes no difference at that
point whether the foreign government says/’We refuse to
pay for the goods/’

or "We seize the goods/'

It is the

same repudiation of a commercial transaction.
I see my time is up.

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

gentlemen.
