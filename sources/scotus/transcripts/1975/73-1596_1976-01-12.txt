MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We if ill hear arguments

next in No. 73-1596, Harper against Wong.
Mr. Solicitor General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. BORX:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it Please

the Court:
We are here on writ of certiorari to the Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
Respondents are four aliens who have been denied
employment in the Federal Competitive Civil Service by a
reason of the Civil Service Commission's regulation
requiring that applicants for most positions be either
citizens of the United States or persons owing the United
States allegiance.
Respondents filed a class action challenging
this regulation on constitutional and other grounds.
The District Court, on the government's motion
dismissed for failure to state a claim.

The Ninth Circuit

reversed, holding that the regulation violates the Equal
Protection principle of the due process clause of the Fifth
Amendment.
The Court said, that alienage is a suspect
classification so that a compelling governmental interest

must be shown»
The Court of Appeals relied, as we believe
mistakenly, on the cases of this Court in Graham against
Richardson and Sugarman against Dougall.
Those cases concerned state restrictions on the
eligibility of aliens for state employment and state welfare
benefits.
It is our contention that the Civil Service
Commission's regulation is a valid exercise of the national
power and I reached that result in alternative ways.
My first submission is that the equal protection
principle has no application to the Federal Government's
dealings with aliens as aliens.
I want to be quite clear about that.
The equal protection principle obviously applies
to persons which includes, of course, aliens and it protects
them from a variety of inequalities? for example, inequal­
ities on account of race, inequalities on account of
religion —-but my submission is that the equal protection
principle doss not apply to a pure alienage classification.
QUESTION:

In other words, Mr. Solicitor General,

the Congress could make it a criminal offense for an alien
to rob a bank but only — it's a criminal offense only if
he is an alien.

Is that correct?

MR. BORX:

I think that might be the case.

The

5

Congress could make substantive rule.

The Congress could

not deprive the alien of due process of law, trial and so
forth.

The Congress could make it —
QUESTION:

No, but it could describe and create

and define the offense as an offense only if committed by
an alien.
MR. BORK:

In effect, I think some of the things,

many of the statutes on the books are offenses only for
aliens
QUESTION:

And they can do that with bank

robbery or interstate transportation of a stolen car or
stealing from the mail or any of the normal federal offenses
with which we are familiar .
MR. BORK:

Yes, I have a little difficulty

imagining the situation in which those are not made offenses
also for citisens but they certainly are the argument I am
making which X think/ taken to its logical extreme, would
lead to that result and I think one need not, in practice,
anticipate that particular result.
QUESTION:

But that is -- excuse me, that

is

the thrust of your argument, isn’t it?
MR. BORK:

The contention is that the aliens

have tie explicit guarantees of the Constitution. " For
example, Congress could not pxovide ex post facto punishment
ror an alien who had robbed a bank.

Congress could not

6

deprive an alien of due process of law.

Congress could not

deprive the alien of his First Amendment right to speak or
to worship.
Congress could do none of those things and
Congress may not treat an alien differently from other
persons on the grounds that he is black or white or yellow
or female but I think Congress has plenary power with
respect to alienage.
QUESTION:
taken out and

Why is it that the equal protection is

all the others are left in?

MR. BORK:

Well, precisely, Mr, Justice Marshall,

because whereas the states -- in the cases we dealt with, in
Sugarman against Dougall and Graham against Richardson and
In Re Griffiths and so forth, have no power- given to them
by the Federal Constitution over aliens as a class.
The Federal Government has plenary power, extra­
ordinary power over the alienage — the aliens as a class;
not only the power coming from Article I, Section 8, Clause
4, which gives explicit power to legislate with respect to
immigration and naturalization but indeed, the inherent
powers arising out of the power to conduct foreign policy,
the power of national defense and so forth.
And, indeed, the Constitution itself, in many
places, Article IV, confines privileges and immunities
specifically so that for purposes of federal legislation,

7
alienage is not only not a suspect classification, it is an
inevitable classification.

The Federal Government has not

only the power but the duty to legislate with respect to
aliens as a class.
QUESTION:

But that could be said, so long as

within the equal protection clause.

There would be nothing

contrary about that, would there?
MR. BORK:

Well, my alternative submission —

QUESTION:

It is internally inconsistent to say

MR. BORK:

I think it is internally inconsistent

that.

to say it to this extent:

the Respondents' claim here, and

I think the only way Respondents can prevail, is that
alienage is a suspect classification, which I think is
quite wrong in this context and therefore, we must show the
most compelling governmental need to classify with respect
to alienage.
If that were true, I don't see how any federal
legislation with respect to alienage is going to survive.
I don't know of a statute offhand that has ever
survived the strict judicial scrutiny test.
QUESTION:

No, it's just a way of announcing the

conclusion in advance.
MR. BORK:

I think so, Mr. Justice Stewart, so

that if we say that a compelling governmental interest must

be shown, I doubt that it will ever be shown, with respect
to any of these statutes and we have, in our brief, in
the Appendix and in our supplemental brief in the Appendix,
over 200 statutes in the Federal Code, 200 provisions in the
Federal Code which classify one way or another by alienage.
QUESTION:

Did Congress —

MR. BORIS:

And that --- pardon me.

QUESTION:

Go ahead, finish.

MR. BORK:

And that doesn't even deal with

Title VIII, which is the main codification of the rights and
liabilities of aliens
i
Pardon me, Mr.
QUESTION:

Chief Justice.

Could Congress, Mr. Solicitor General,

enact a statute now that hereafter all aliens admitted to
this country must apply for citizenship within five years
or be deported?
MR. BORK:

I have no doubt, Mr. Chief Justice,

that that legislation would be well within Congress' power.
QUESTION:

Could they apply it then to persons

who had been in the United States before the enactment of
that statute?
MR. BORK:

I have no doubt that that is true

also, Mr. Chief Justice.

We certainly had the deportation

cases which were much more severe than that in which persons
who had joined the communist party at a time when it was

9

not illegal to do so were subsequently deported because of
an after-enacted statute so that I have no doubt —

A

QUESTION:

Are those illustrations of the kind

of plenary power that you suggest Congress has over aliens
as aliens?
MR, BORK:

They are indeed, Mr. Chief Justice.

QUESTION:

But Mr. Solicitor General, has

Congress done anything with respect to the eligibility of
aliens for federal employment?
We are not really dealing with a statute, are we,
here?
MR. BORK:

Mr. Justice Stevens, we are dealing

with a regulation taken under the Civil Service Act of
1883 and Congress —
QUESTION:

But the statute itself is silent with

respect to the discrimination involved, is it not?
MR. BORK:

The statute itself is silent.

The

legislative history of the statute is not silent, Mr. Justice
Stevens.
QUESTION:

Is it not also true that any executive

order is also silent with respect to this particular area?
MR. BORK:
Mr. Justice Stevens.

I don’t believe that is true,
In the second part of our brief, our

main brief, it is quite clear, not only that Congress, in
enacting the federal, the Civil Service statute and in its

10

various amendments later»
It is also quite clear that President Arthur
required in his order citizenship and that President
Theodore Roosevelt extended the category from not only
citizens but to persons who owe allegiance, so the two
Presidents dealt with the citizenship requirement in a
knowing way.
No, I think insofar as we are talking about a
deliberate policy, Mr. Justice Stevens, the legislative
history — which is cited in our brief -- and the two
Presidents and the executive ox*der 10577 -— which is also
in our brief -- refers to citizenship so I think this is
just about as deliberate a policy as one could seek.
Well, I —
QUESTION;

Let me put a question that I was

leading up and I am not sure it is appropriate but I have
it in mind.
Supposing the paragraph of the regulation of the
Civil Service agency, whatever its proper title is,
requiring citizenship as a condition of eligibility were
simply repealed so there was nothing in words that required
that an applicant for employment be a citizen and then take
it a step further and

suppose the Postmaster in Chicago

had to taka on extra heip for the Christmas season or
something like that and he put into effect a regulation for

11
his own office requiring everyone to be a citizen.

Would

you contend such a regulation would be valid?
He, of course, speaks for the Federal Government
within his own office.
MR. BORK:

Yes.

As a matter of fact, of course,

the Post Office now does hire aliens.
QUESTION:

I understand they do.

MR. BORK:

But in this case, if the regulation

were repealed, I would think, if we were dealing with a
part of the competitive Civil Service, that the repeal of
the regulation and the failure to exclude citizens would be
in contravention of the executive order and in contravention
of the intent of Congress.
Nov/, I don't know -- I suppose —
QUESTION:

You really haven’t answered the

question I mean to put.
Suppose the statute is silent.

The executive

order is silent and the top regulation is silent and just a
local branch of the Federal Government decides for itself
it would like to employ citizens only.
MR. BORK:

Could they do so?

Oh, I think there is no doubt,

Mr. Justice Stevens, that if all of those expressions of
policy are made silent that the local branch of government
certainly could.
QUESTION:

Could make the discrimination.

12
MR, BORK:
"discrimination.

I would prefer not to use the word

ts

QUESTION:

Well, but you say it .is made, you

know, it is inherent in the system.

It is inherent in the

system.
MR. BORK:

It is the Federal Government’s power

to do this, to classify in this way is inherent in the
system.

The Federal Government need not classify --QUESTION:

And that includes the power of any

federal officer unless explicitly prohibited.
MR. BORK:
Indeed,

I would think so.

I would think so.

are sections of the government

which do have the power to hire aliens and do so.
QUESTION:

How do you justify that under the

regulation, under the executive order?
MR. BORK:

Oh, well, there —

QUESTION:

Does it come under the two exceptions

iirhich are specified?
MR. BORK:

I believe so, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

QUESTION:

I are thinking of the Post Office

There is a

Department.

I am thinking of NASA and others.
MR. BORK:

Well, I think they are not under the

competitive Civil Service now, are they?

The Post Office?

They are not and I think there are statutory

13

exceptions for certain places like the Defense Department
which, by nature of its work may wish often to hire aliens
and may wish to make the individualised determination that ~
and finds it worthwhile to expend its resources making —
QUESTION:

I suppose the Atomic Energy Commission

is under that blanket, too, wouldn't it be?
MR. BORK:

I am not particularly aware of the —

QUESTION:

Wererft there aliens employed in the

Atomic Energy Commission?
MR. BORK:

Oh, you can get exceptions made,

certainly, Mr, Chief Justice and the Atomic Energy Commission
had
undoubtedly for that kind of work would have/to make that
exception at the time when the European scientists came to
this country.
QUESTION:

Sometimes the most sensitive areas

are the exception areas.
MR, BORK:

Oh, Mr, Justice Blackmun, I don’t

think the reason for this regulation is necessarily the
sensitivity of the work involved.
That is one reason ■— one thing that requiring
residence in this country for five years does is to give in
the ordinary case a track record for the person applying
and a way of checking about him.
In a situation where you badly need some kind
of talent, somebody hasn't been here five years, you expend

14

the resources to do the checking or take your chances and
I

that seems to me in no way to cast doubt upon the general
a

rule that the Federal Government sees fit to follow.
But my main point is that we have here an
exercise by the Civil Service Commission of a delegated,
combined power of Congress and the President and those are
pov/ers relatina to naturalization, to foreign policy, to
national defense and to treaty-making.
And, in. fact, I think, what has been exercised
is a power that is inherent — without even respect to the
constitutional provision of the very idea of a nation-state
which possesses sovereignty.

Every nation-state distin­

guishes between those who owe allegiance to it and those
who do not and so obvious is that that I think every nation
or virtually every nation in the world makes that
distinction.
And I think so obvious is it that it has been
exercised and crone uncontested for over 9 0 years in this
country

in this explicit form and I think that is

constitutionally a relevant factor because it gives this
practice all the support that long-continued and universally.

.

accepted usage confers.
So I think those are what makes this case
different from the state cases, Sugarman and Graham.
Respondents' only argument in this connection is,

15
I think, a simplistic and a mechanical one.

That argument

runs as follows:
Whenever an equal protection principle has been
formulated in a case involving a state, that principle must,
automatically be applied against the Federal Government,
Their example is the formulation of the equal
protection principle in Brown against Board of Education
applied against the Federal Government in Belling against
Sharpe and I think that argument is patently fallacious
because that progression from state to federal cannot be
made when the Constitution explicitly gives the Federal
Government the power and, as I say, the duty to legislate
about aliens.
States are not independent sovereigns.
not have the power to naturalise,

They do

They do not have the

power to conduct foreign affairs, to make decisions about
national defense, to make treaties.

They have none of the

powers which gives Congress power over aliens -- over
alienage.
When we move from state cases like Sugarman and
Graham against Richardson, we really move into a whole new
framework — cases like the Chinese Exclusion case; cases
like Uarisiades against Shaughnessey, Kliendienst against
Mandpi, cases that show an extraordinary degree of federal
power in this field.

16

I think it is incontestable, as the Chief
Justice^ question a moment ago pointed out, that Congress
has the power to exclude aliens from this country altogether
and that as a corollary of that power, it can attach such
conditions to entry as it sees fit.
QUESTION:

Well, now, that goes a bit further

than the argument you made earlier —MR. BORK:

It does indeed, sir.

QUESTION:

— because it would follow that aliens

could be excluded on the ground that they would be granted
none of the rights granted other people in our country by
the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
MR. BORK:

Well, I had meant to say —

QUESTION:

And

MR. BORIC:

I had meant to say

under that condition.
sIsg

earlier,,

Mr. Justice Stewart, that aliens could not be deprived of
the explicit protections of the Constitution.
QUESTION:

But could they be admitted on the

condition that they be given none of the benefits?
MR. 30RK:

No, I think not.

QUESTION:

Well, why not?

MR, BORK:

Well, because when we are dealing v?ith

If your argument is --

unconstitutional conditions, Mr, Justice Stewart, we are
dealing with explicit guarantees that are asked to be
given up by the aliens.

Here, I am merely suggesting that they could have
been admitted on the condition that they not apply for
federal employment until they were naturalised, which I
think is not an unconstitutional condition and my claim is
much less broad than it may have seemed when I began that
line of development.
But, for example, Congress now excludes aliens
from entry to perform certain kinds of labor, skilled or
unskilled, unless they get a certification from the
Secretary of Labor that they are not taking away a job of
an American citizen and if any of them violates that, I am
sure he may be deported.

That is the kind of condition I

am talking about that could be attached to the shore and
therefore I think that this kind of condition about not
seeking federal employment could be attached at the shore
but that is not essential to my argument because in any
case the federal power to admit or to exclude or to deport
is plenary and it is necessarily intertwined with decisions
about the aliens rights and obligations while he is in
this country.
There is no way the two can be separated.
QUESTION:

Well, you could certainly separate

them by simply not going so far as you do in saying that
Congress' power has to do with the exclusion and deportation
of aliens and not with all these other things you have

in
talked about and not with what is involved in this case,
that this has not had to do with exclusion or deportation.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, again, what

I meant by the fact that they are inevitably intertwined —
I think that is right and I think it is right, not because
of a legal point but simply because Congress* decision
about how many people to admit will necessarily be affected
by the power they have over aliens here so that the less
power Congress has to classify alienage in this country,
that may affect -- indeed, in some cases will affect
Congress* decision about time for naturalization, degree of
numbers entering and so forth.
And it is because it is intertwined, T think,
that historically, we have view Congress as having such
power over aliens in this country.
Now, Congress has been very liberal in provisions
for aliens but I think that there is absolutely no
constitutional necessity that the package of rights and
obligations that they provide for aliens be of equal value
to the package possessed by citizens and I think to begin
now to require Congress -— or to take away from Congress
effectively by applying this compelling governmental
interest test, would be to

take away from Congress almost

all its power in this field and I think that would be a
constitutional innovation for v?hieh I can find no warrant in

19

the text or in the history or, indeed, of the policy of the
Constitution and that is why I say I think the only fully
satisfactory formulation of the lav? with respect to resident
aliens is that it protects aliens as persons but not in
their status as aliens.
Nov?, I think that is a logical answer to this
case but I would like to move on to the — if this Court
disagrees and thinks that the equal protection analysis is
to some degree relevant, as we have discussed, there are,
of course, two degrees of severity with which that analysis
applies and I think the proper test here because of the
federal powers in this field is, at most, the rational basis
test.

Anything more would take Congress almost out of the

game.
I think in the context of a federal case
involving federal power, it is appropriate to note that
alienage is not like race or sex in immutable characteristics.
The disability imposed by this regulation is
temporary and it is limited.

Naturalization and the

privileges of citizenship are available in five years or
three years if the alien marries a citizen.
Now, in fact, the utter inappropriateness of
calling alienage a suspect category in this case is demon­
strated by a ract of which j have been informed by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, and that is that two

PO-21
of the Respondents in this case, have now applied for and
received citizenship»
All four of them are eligible — the last time
this case was argued — in fact, Mow Sun Wong, the leading
plaintiff, I am informed, was naturalized in January 7th,
1975, which was five days before this case was argued last
term.
And Mr. Mok was naturalized on September 16th,
1976 —- 1975, I am sorry.
Now, the fact that they can choose.,

all of them

can choose to be citizens — and two of the Respondents
have acquired citizenship and all of the rights that go
with it, seems to me to illustrate dramatically how un­
realistic it is to speak of aliens in a federal context as
a suspect classification whose rights must be protected
because they are persons who are discriminated against as
persons who are discriminated against on grounds of race.
They can move out of the category easily.
of the four Sespondents here have.

Two

I trust if the other

remaining two do become citizens before this case is
decided, the counsel of Respondents will tell us, will tell
the Court but there is simply no reality to the claim of
suspect classification.
Now, turning to the rational relation test just
very briefly I want to say this.

22

If this regulation must

pass the rational rela­

tionship test, I think it does so quite easily and I will
mention just three relationships it has to a permissible
governmental purpose»
In the first place, it offers an inducement for
resident aliens to acquire knowledge of this country, our
language, something of our government, to proclaim
allegiance and to become citizens and I think Congress may
legitimately wish to

induce aliens living here to

»

integrate themselves into our national life and our
political communities by becoming citizens.
One of the Respondents, as we discussed last
time, has now been here for over 29 years and has not
troubled to apply for citizenship.

And I sea no reason

why Congress may not have a policy to induce such a person
to declare that integration in our political community,
that an application for and the receipt of citizenship
implies and shows.
I don't think that this is a matter to be taken
lightly.

It is a force,

an actual force

and a symbolic

force of some importance in making for the cohesion of the
political community to which it belongs.
There was, I think, last time we discussed this
case, some mention of xenophobia.
here at all.

I don’t think that is

This country traditionally and today is more

23
hospitable to aliens and makes naturalization easier than
most.

If xenophobia were involved, Congress would simply

bar all aliens from our shores.
This legislative and Presidential purpose alone,
I think, is that of integrating people into the national
political community and strengthening the cohesion of that
community symbolically and actually.

I think that is

sufficient to justify the regulation.
But if I were to go on to another point, I would
say that there is an administrative burden.
may be kept from some kinds of positions.

Obviously aliens
Obviously, aliens

may be kept from even menial positions in some kinds of
federal facilities.

Obviously, it is more difficult to

check an alien's background if he has not been here some
sufficient period of time to have established a record in
this country.
I take it that the government is entitled, as
suggested in other cases recently, to make a broad rule to
take care of administrative difficulties of that kind and
not have to follow aliens about to make sure they aren't
transferred to the wrong place to keep reclassifying jobs
as the situation changes.
And finally, I would suggest that in the federal
context it is important to note and legitimate to note that
the

federal payroll has become an important means for

24
implementing social policies.
Federal affirmative hiring programs have helped
to counterbalance discrimination in the private sector and
I think Congress may wish to maximise the effectiveness of
the federal payroll in this function by confining it to
citizens.
None of the three objectives I have mentioned
is impermissible.

None of them, I think, is evil.

Each of

them bears a rational relation to the regulation of the
commission which means that the regulations do not offend
the equal protection principle of the Fifth Amendment and
we ask that the judgment of the Court of Appeals be
reversed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you,

Mr. Solicitor General.
Mr. Steinman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD H„ STEINMAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. STEINMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;
The government today, as it has done

in the

past, is trying to paint this case for what it is not.

The

government is trying to paint this case as one involving
plenary power of Congress.

This case does not, although

as we shall argue later, even if it does, the governments

25

actions are not immune from

constitutional strictures.

The plenary power of Congress stems, over this
area which we are discussing, stems from the Constitution,
Article I, Section VIII, clause four.

The only words in

the Constitution are naturalization, Congress' plenary
power over naturalization.
This Court, in cases as recent as Sugarman and
Griffiths, has interpretated that to mean Congress' plenary
power over immigration and naturalization and as it has
been pointed out today, immigration connotes entry to this
country, deportation and naturalization.
Issues where national security, foreign affairs
and this country's sovereignty are inevitably intertwined,
that is not involved today.,
QUESTION:

What would be your answer to the

hypothetical about the power' of Congress to enact the
statute that required aliens, (A), to learn the language of
the counfcrY so that they could pass a test within five years
and apply for citizenship within five years or be deported
at the end of that time?
MR,, STEXNMAN:

Naturally we already have the

language requirement to become a citizen, your Honor,

I

think that if Congress is dealing in areas of naturalization,
and I emphasize that it is Congress, as Mr. Justice Stevens
says, we don’t even have a statute today really dealing with
/

26

aliens but if Congress was acting in regard to naturalisation,
that would be a clear indication that it was an exercise of
plenary power and in that area, this Court's role is not

*

eliminated but the test is quite different.
I think the Court then gives far greater
deference.
The notion that somehow this case is going to lead
to this Court automatically striking down 200 statutes is
just not correct.
First of all, many of those statutes involve
appointed officials and I think that aliens may have
difficulty raising standings.
Many of those statues only involve a mere few
people, not the millions involved here.
Most importantly, many of those statutes
involved issues of national affairs, security, the sovereignty
of this country and regardless of what test this Court
utilizes, whether this Court talks about the status of
aliens, a suspect class; whether this Court talks about
conditions not being rationally related; whether this Court
-talks about presumptions being irrebuttable or not, the fact
is that this Government surely has the right in certain
circumstances to clear, precise, tailored circumstances not
to allow aliens to do certain things.
The problem in this case, of course, as the

27
problem in other cases this Court has dealt with is total
blanket exclusion and one of the interesting points which,
as your Honor mentioned, is that the government has
explicitly, in other areas, and the Atomic Energy Commission
example, your Honor, is in the statute.

It is noted at

page 84, note 72 of the government's brief, the government,
in areas involving the essence of national security, the
Atomic Energy Commission, the Department of Defense, NASA,
highest officials in the executive branch, has, by statute
allowed aliens to work in those departments — again, an
example of tailoring.
For I do want to emphasize that this ca.se does
not involve integration and does not involve plenary power.
What it involves is a blanket exclusion against individuals
who have been lawfully admitted — and if I may quote this
Court, a decision of this Court in 1370, once an alien
lav/fully enters and resides in this country, he becomes
invested with the rights guaranteed by the Constitution to
all people within their borders.
These rights are unalienable and guard against
any encroachment by federal or state authorities.
decision is Hellenic Lines versus Rhoditis.

That

It appears at

page 39 of our brief.
One of the problems that I have with the
Solicitor General's argument is that he concedes to this

Court that certain particular rights in the Constitution
apply to aliens, resident aliens»

He conceded today that

the First Amendment applies, that due process applies,
Mr. Justice Marshall asked him, why doesn't
equal protection apply?

Why is the government allowed to

be selective?
The fact that equal protection may involve
inherent classification is not an answer.

Consider the

hypothetical of Congress saying that aliens do not have
First Amendment rights.

I submit to you that that is

the classification between aliens and citizens but as the
Solicitor General Conceded today, under the Court's
decision, resident aliens clearly have First Amendment
rights.
I think it is important to emphasize in this
case the facts of what these people were seeking and by the
way, your Honor, I did not know that last year one of my
clients had become a citizen and I was awtire that another
had but it is very clear from these courts8 decisions that
one does not have to become a citizen to taka advantage of
constitutional rights.
Mr, Justice Powell in the Griffiths case,
recognized that the person in that case chose not to
exercise the right to be a citizen.
In Sugarman versus Dougall, two of the

29

aforenamed appellees had been here long enough to qualify.
In Graham versus Richardson,. Mrs . Graham had
been here much longer than the requisite period of time to
become a citizen.

This Court did not require the

individuals there to exercise that option.

This Court did

not require it here.
What my clients were seeking was to work as a
janitor, a file clerk, loading and unloading mail at the
Post Office and as evaluator of educational programs and
one of the ironies, of course, is that three of them at one
time worked for the Federal Government — two in a California
state program which paid their salaries, one, Respondent
Lui., who inadvertently got a job at the Post Office.
QUESTION:

But no one has questioned, that I am

aware of, the power of the United States Government to hire
aliens if they want to.
MR. STEINMAN:

That is not involved here, is it?
Well, I point the irony because

they actually got around, if you will, to regulation
involved here -- although they didn't get around to totally —
and that they worked outstandingly, according to the
Appendix, the evaluations of their supervisors, and yet
because of this blanket exclusion -- in the regulation, not
the statute, they had to leave federal employment and I
think also it should be noted that the exclusion in the
federal regulation says that to work for the federal

30

Government, you must be s citizen or owe permanent
allegiance.
Unfortunately, the Federal Government has taken
the position — which I have never seen justified --- that
owing permanent allegiance means only individuals from
American Samoa

I point you to the government's brief,

page 81, note 67.
I do not know why owing permanent allegiance
cannot be extended to others.
For example, three of my four-named plaintiffs
at the time this case had been brought, filed declarations
of intent to become a citizen.

It is too bad that they

had to wait five years to exercise their option to become
citizens before they became open to federal employment.
Now, what I would like to emphasise to this
Court is that, given the nature of the jobs that they sought,
not involving national security -- given that they had
performed outstandingly, there is no justification to
exclude them.
Clearly, the court below relied on compelling
interests„
We, as Mr. Justice Powell indicated in the
Griffiths case, we are not concerned with labels, whether
this Court calls it overriding interest, important interest,
compelling interest — whether this Court uses the rational

31

relationship test, whether this Court uses irrebuttable
presumption, as clearly this regulation creates an
irrebuttable presumption.
V7e are concerned with the facts that aliens,
solely because of their status, are excluded from federal
employment.
Mr. Bork said that in regard to the Federal
Government, aliens are not a suspect classification.

I

submit that they strongly are.
This Court has said continually that aliens
are inherently suspect.

They are a discrete and-- an

example of a discrete and insular minorityfor whom such
Kraerner (?)
heightened judicial solicitude is appropriate in Grainer
and Sugarman.

They are inherently suspect even i-.f it is

the Federal Government.

They are examples of discrete

and insular

even of the Federal Government.

minorities

The fact that the disability is' not one that is
long, the fact that these appellees can become citizens,
is not relevant.
Graham.

It was not relevant to this Court in

It was not relevant in Sugarman. It was not

relevant in Griffith.
The point is that the suspect classification
remains the same.

What is different in this case is the

interest which the government can assert.
That is why the lower court did not say that

32

Sugarman and Graham were dispositive.
but not squarely controlling.

)

It found them helpful

What one must do is analyse

the interests that are involved.
As we submit, the government must be required to
show the strongest possible interest.
But even if you don't require that, even if you
use the traditional rational relationship test, I submit to
you that the rationals offered by the government are very,
very weak.
For example, the government says that one of the
rationals is that we want to induce aliens to become
citizens„
Well, first of all, there are numerous statutes

^

which allow non-citizens to work for the Federal Government,
including the most sensitive positions.
Clearly, those are not inducements to become
citizens„
QUESTION;

But those statutory exceptions are

for the benefit of the United States' own interests, are
they not?
That is, if we want to hire, the United States
w

wants to hire Wehner Von Braun or other scientists, the
United States surely has plenary powers to waive these:
considerations, do they not?
MR. STEXNMANs

I totally agree but, of course.

33

there are no facts in this case that showed that it was in
Congress' mind?since the statute is silent I don't know that
we can say that it was in Congress' mind.
There are no facts to say that it was in the
mind of the Civil Service Commission that the reason for the
regulation was to induce citizenship.
Obviously,- one of the ways this Court could have
answered that in Sugarman versus Dougall was to say that
the states might have requirements that to work for the
state Civil Service, you must be a citizen, would be
enhancing the congressional role in inducing citizenship.
QUESTION:

But the Solicitor General says that

is the difference between the state and the Federal
Government.
MR, STEINMAN:
QUESTION:

I agree with him.

I assume you agree.

MR. STEINMAN:

I agree that there is a difference,

but as this Court stated last term — if I may quote
directly from Weinberger versus Weisenfield, that is S5
Supreme Court 1228 No. 2, this Court's approach to the Fifth
Amendment equal protection claims has always been precisely
the same as the equal protection claims under* the Fourth
Amendment.
QUESTION:

Is that the case of aliens?

MR. STEINMAN:

No, it is involving --

34

QUESTION:

His point is that alien is in a

different category.
J

MR. STEINMAN:

Well, I think that alien is in a

different category in regard to what interest the government
is allowed to assert.
QUESTION:

Period.

MR. STEINMAN:

I respectfully disagree, your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, aliens can be excluded from this

country, but you can't exclude American-born from this
country.
MR. STEINMAN:

If you were talking about issues

of injury, naturalisation, deportation —
QUESTION:

No, no, no.
!

MR. STEINMAN:
QUESTION:

-- then I cannot disagree with you.

Once you come in the country, you

still are alien until you become a citizen.
MR. STEINMAN:

Right, and when that --

1
QUESTION:

And there is a difference between a

resident alien and a citizen, right?
MR. STEINMAN:

There are several differences.

Citizens, of course, are not subject to requirements of

entry»

Citizens are not subject to

deportation.

naturalization

Any congressional law which says because you

are a citizen, you cannot hold a federal job would be
struck down automatically.
What we are suggesting here is that when the
Federal Government is dealing with resident aliens, it has
many powers, but its powers must be tested by the principles
of this Court and whether those principles require strong
compelling interest, rational relationships, presumptions
are not rebuttable.

Aliens are deserving of the protections

carved out under the Fifth Amendment.
I totally agree with your Honor that aliens are
and have been treated differently than citizens.

One of the

things that we are not going to do in this case if we
prevail is to wipe out the distinction between citizens
and aliens.
QUESTIONj

Do you think it

would have helped --

or would it help this regulation of the Civil Service
Commission if, as Congress often does, it recited a series
of preambles, considerations for enacting the regulations —
one, for example, that it wanted to encourage people to
apply promptly for citizenship.
Two, that it wanted to

ctBcttroe federal employ”

menf for American citizens because at the present time,
studies have shown that there are 10 or 11 illegal aliens

in the United States and in addition to many aliens legally
in the United States.
And, third, that Federal Government programs of
affirmative action to remedy past discrimination will be
served by limiting federal employment to naturalized or
native-born citizens„

/

Would that take care of the flaws you see in
this regulation?
MR, 3TEINMAN:

Well, I don't think that it would

take care of the flaws, but it would surely aid our
understanding of what Congress is doing.

I would not

concede —
QUESTION:

Congress — this is, I am going to

your point that Congress has not done this.
MR. STEINMAN:
QUESTIOH:

Right, and I ~

The Civil Service Commission has

done it.
MR. STEINMAN:

I still emphasize that the proper

test would not be rational relationships.

But if that test

were applied, then I think that some of the reasons articu­
lated by your Honor would not be sufficient? for example,
wanting to keep federal jobs only for citizens.

That

smacks of the special public interest doctrine which this
Court has consistently struck down in the last 10 years.
Wanting to induce people to become citizens, I

v?ould think that that might be partly closer to the process
of naturalization and if that would be

deemed by this

Court to be Congress exercising its powers of naturalization
then I would concede in that situation plenary power
applies and this Court could probably give far greater
deference to the Congress8 decision.
Unfortunately, we have no reasons offered in
this case.

We have no reasons that would at all justify,

even under the Court's minimal test, excltiding millions of
resident aliens solely because of their status from seeking,
all types of federal jobs.
The Congress has numberable reasons that it can
offer why aliens should not hold certain types of employment
issues of national security, issues of foreign affairs.
hs this Court has pointed out in Sugarman,
government has the right to require citizenship to vote, to
hold elective office, to hold important offices, to hold
offices where policy-making' and executive-making decisions
are made.
Those rights would continue after this case
and to the extent that Congress exercises its rights, it
will make sure that certain jobs only go to citizens.
My clients are dealing, unfortunately, with
a blanket umbrella»
competent.

They can't even show that they are

They can't, even show that they would make a

good mail clerk or a good janitor.

They are foreclosed at

the door.
QUESTION:

Mr. Sfceinman, may I interrupt a minute?

I am not completely clear on your answer to the
Solicitor General's argument that the incentive to become
a citizen is a rational basis for a rule such as this.

I

am not sure whether you are saying that that is not the
real reason and we don't know what the reason is.
Or are you saying, even if it could be demon­
strated that that is why the regulation was adopted it would
not. be a valid reason.
MR. STEINMMF:

Well, again, it has not been

stated here and under a stricter test then, rational
relationship would not be valid.
Under the rational relationship test, I would
argue, clearly, that Congress, when it is touching upon
issues of naturalization, inducements to become a citizen,
has far greater rights and can assert interests which this
Court, should give greater deference to,
I think one of the problems with the Congress
articulating that rationale, your Honor*, is that there are
so many other statutes, there are so many other areas where
Congress does not have that similar inducement and X would
like the Congress to explain to the Court
QUESTION:

I am not sure I understand your

38
answer.
MR. STEINMAN:
QUESTION:

I'd like fco —

You are saying that if Congress had

articulated this as its real reason, it would be a
sufficient reason.

That is what you seem to be saying.

MR. STEINMAN:

Well, it would be a sufficient

reason if Congress could explain, at least to me, your
Honor, but quite possibly not to yourself, why it is
rationally related to induced citizenship for Civil Service
positions but not for all the other positions where
citizenship is not required.
If your hypothetical suggests that Congress has
given that reason, I think I have a much weaker case.

1511

agree to that,
QUESTION:

Well, that is wholly contrary to

conventional protection clause analysis, isn’t it?
don't require a given reason.

We

The ordinary approach has

been to define whether any conceivable rational reason
exists.

We don’t — it has never been the analysis to

stick Congress with a reason they gave or to require them
to give a reason or anything along similar lines in
conventional equal protection clause analysis.
✓

MR. STEINMAN:

i think the conventional analysis,

your Honor, if the cases would be looked at, did not
involve the situation as in here, where we have important

39

governmental interests that are being curtailed, whether
or not we use the notion of suspect classification or
rational relation»
QUESTION:

Why is this a suspect classification

when it is a classification that is in the 14th Amendment
of the United States, that was an Amendment that came after
a good deal of national trauma, of civil war and a proposal
and adoption of that amendment and that defines citizenship
of the United States?
It must have some meaning and it mustn’t be —
why is it invidious and suspect and irrational?
MR» STEINMAN:

Well, I think for the same

reasons that the Court indicated in the Rodriguez case
what the indicia are or a suspect classification, individuals
who have suffered long disabilities, who have had a history
of unequal treatment, who have been in a position of
political powerlessness.
In the Griffiths^ case, Mr» Justice Powell out­
lined some of the hostile treatment that resident aliens
have suffered in this country,
I think these were the reasons that led this
Court in the Graham case and in Sugarman to hold that, like
other

suspect classifications, aliens are needful of the

heightened judicial solicitude»

I think that one of the

reasons, of course, is that aliens can’t vote and maybe are

40

politically powerless.
the right to vote.

I am not saying that aliens have

I think clearly this Court has made it

clear and I think that under the Constitution, the Congress
and the states can foreclose aliens from voting.
QUESTION:

Well, the 14th Amendment virtually

says so, doesn’t it?
MR. STEINMAN:
is correct.

I think that the interpretation

But we are not seeking voting.

We are not

seeking things that relate to the country's sovereignty.
We are seeking jobs with the Federal Civil Service and to
the extent that issues of the national sovereignty, issues
of loyalty and security are present in the federal jobs,
then v/e-

willingly concede that aliens should not be in

those positions.
The problem is that now we can make no deter­
mination.
QUESTION:

You don't think that the affirmativa

action programs are sufficient consideration even though,
presumably, every time an alien fills a Civil Service
position, it is one less position available for either American citizens or for American citizens perhaps subject
to the affirmative action program?
MR. STEINMAN:

I have two responses, one legal,

one factual.
I think legally this Court has

said that

41
descriptions like that, of favoring citizens over non• 0

citizens, is the type of special public interest doctrine
which this Court 'went out of its way in both G rah are and
Sugarman to repudiate.
I think factually, your Honor, we have filed
amicus briefs which show that the unemployment rate among
resident aliens, unfortunately in the San Francisco Bay
area, is three to four times that of citizens and although
clearly, if a resident alien gets a job he replaces a
citizen, I think the amici show that it is far easier for
a citizen, at least where I come from, to gat employment
than resident aliens.
But, again, Congress has not said this and as
Mr. Justice Stevens recognized. Congress has not even
discussed aliens.

I don't wish at this time to repeat what

is in my brief concerning our non-constitutional arguments.
I think it is very clear.
I think that the executive order, 10577, does,
Mr. Justice Stevens, mention citizenship.

But what at

present it requires the Civil Service Commission to do is
to establish criteria with relation to citizenship.
I submit that if the President thought that the
criteria was going to be blanket exclusion of all non­
citizens, that would have been a rather vain and idle
justice.

Unfortunately, the Civil Service Commission has

not established any criteria.

What they have done is

issued a blanket order.
One other response I would like to make is that
we are faced, clearly, with the policy that it has been in
existence a long time, although I clearly submit to you
that there is no statutory authorisation.
I would hope that as this Court has recognised
in the area of constitutional law, that the fact that a
policy has existed for a long time does not immunize it
from constitutional protection.,
Likewise, the fact that, the Civil Service
Commission has for many decades foreclosed aliens from the
federal employment should not immunize it from the test
that this Court has laid down in relation to the explicit,
specific authorisation that Congress must give an executive
or administrative body when dealing with important
interests such as are at. stake here.
Again, 1 hope that my brief is adequate on that
point.
QUESTION;

Are you saying, Mr. Steinman, that

limiting federal employment, the employment in government,
to citizens of the sovereign is not an attribute of
sovereignty, or are you saying that, assume that it is ■—
there has been no action taken by the sovereign to so
declare that is the national policy?

43
MR. STEINMAN:

1 would answer to your first part,

no, it is not an action of sovereignty and the reason that
I would is -QUESTION:

Not an attribute of sovereignty?

MR„ STEINMAN:

Attribute.

And the reason that I

would is that this Court has made it very clear that the
£>lenary power deals with matters of entry, naturalization
and deportation, as the quotation I read from the 1970 case
of Hellenic versus Rhoditis stated.
Once the alien is lawfully in this country,
absent naturalization issues, absent issues of deportation,
the alien does get full and complete treatment of the
Constituti Oil.
But, your Honor, if you are correct, if it was an
attribute of sovereignty, then my position -QUESTION:

I didn’t state it.

I asked you for

your view.
MR. STEINMAN:

If the hypothetical is correct,

excuse me,, that it was an attribution of sovereignty, then
I would submit that the fact that Congress’ plenary powers
are involved does not mean that this

Court gives absoluta

okay to what is going on.
This Court still has a role to play.

Our brief

enunciates the numerous cases, using the war powers, where
this Court has said that, "the talismanie incantation of

44
the plenary power cannot immunize Congress' action under the
Constitution„
^

Clearly, though, if the plenary power is present,
I would concede that the Court's test is more deferential.
But as I stated here, I do not believe that the
plenary power is present.
In closing, I would like to say that the only
justification or reason that really exists for the total
exclusion of resident aliens from all federal employment
is that they are aliens.
To state that would confess discrimination.

)

Hence,

the Petitioners are silent.
I submit that such silence can no longer immunize
constitutional violations.
As this Court said in Graham versus Richardson,
the Congress does not have the power to authorize individual
states to violate the equal protection clausa.
I would submit that when Congress is not acting
in areas of deportation, naturalization and immigration,
Congress itself cannot authorize its own violation of equal

>

protection guarantees of the Fifth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Wall, why isn't

a limitation of

government employment to citizens an act of the government
relating to naturalization?
%

MR. STEINMAN:

Well, I have a couple of answers.

45
First of all, this Congress has clearly never
stated that and I don't think it is just because it is not
in the Title VIII of the United States Code.
Secondly, the fact that it

may be related to

naturalisation does not explain, then, why everything else
is not related to naturalization.
For example, a resident alien exercising Fifth
Amendment rights.

We want to encourage resident aliens to

become citizens.

Hence, we deny them for five years First

Amendment rights.

This Court would not accept such an

argument.
QUESTION:

That

is so obvious that I don't think

it needs — it doesn't constitute an answer to my question.
MR, STEINMANs

Well, I think that outside the

area of deportation, naturalization and immigration, where
it clearly relates to that plenary power, the problem — the
reason that it is obvious, your Honor, I think is because
the Constitution does treat resident aliens under the Fifth
Amendment protection, that we would not tolerate saying a
resident alien does not have First Amendment rights.
That is why I say we should not tolerate that a
resident alien does not have equal protection rights.
What is different vis-a-vis the citizen is that
the governmental interests and the way those interests are
balanced will be quite different for the resident alien than

46

they are for citizens.
Thank you very much.

It is quite

clear Congress intended this and it is also quite clear that

a statement of their rational purpose, which is satisfactory
to Respondent's counsel.

MR. BORK:

-

Of our initial brief, your Honor.

It is

47
page 78, footnote 63 there.

I just cited that because it is

an extraordinarily clear statement by Senator Hawley that
Congress assumed citizenship in this area as, indeed, every­
body had.
On the question of the —
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, they did assume

it but they didn't explicitly require it in the statute.
MR. BORK:
citizenship.

The statute does not say chare must be

Congress assumed, apparently, that anybody

carrying that out would naturally require citizenship and
Congress had been aware of this practice over the yeax’s and
legislated in light of it and in the Public Works Act, which
we discuss at page 83 of our brief, they have been saying
that salaries may not be paid to aliens in this country with
certain exceptions, if they work for the govarnment so that
this is a Congressional policy, there is no ioubt about that,
as well as a Presidential policy, which is why I said the
policy came to us with the combined weight of the Congress
and the Presidency.
But on the question of the suspect classification,
I would like to direct the Court’s attention to Johnson
against Robison, decided in 1974, in which conscientious
objectors who are, one assumes, will always have the record
of a conscientious objector, has held -- conscientious
objectors are held not to be a suspect classification

48

and I would think if that is the case, then aliens who can
leave the category certainly do not qualify.
In this case, essentially, we are being told by
Respondent's counsel that they don’t like any imposition of
obligations upon aliens whichever way we do it because we
are told that this statute or regulation is overbroad.
We are

required to make individualized

determinations.
I think Weinberger against Salfi suggests
that we are not so required, if there is good reason not to
require us to expend resources to make individualised
determinations.
But on the other hand, it is held against us by
\

Respondent's counsel that in some areas of government, the
government finds it useful to make individualized deter­
minations and to hire aliens so that we are attacked with
both overbreadth and underbreadth.
I submit

that this is a traditional power,

clearly a constitutional power of government.

There is no

inequity involved and it would be extraordinary to change a
constitutional power and practice of this sort for these
reasons at this time.
