PROCEEDINGS

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We- will hear arguments

next in 75-317, Nebraska Press Association v. Stuart.
Mr. Prettyman, you may proceed Whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. BARRETT PRETTYMAN, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR. PRETTYMAN;
may it please the Court;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
I am E. Barrett Prefctyman, Jr., and

I represent a group of newspapers, press and broadcasting
associations, UP, AP, Sigma Delta Chi ChajDter, and several
individual journalists.

Mr. Floyd Abrams, who is with me,

representing certain amici, will also argue for a reversal of
this ca.se.
The basic question before the Court is whether it is
permissible under the First Amendment for a court to issue a
direct prior restraint against the press, prohibiting in ad­
vance of publication the reporting of information revealed in
public court proceedings, in public court records and from
other sources about pending judicial proceedings.
The case arose out of multiple murders.
QUESTION;

Was it at the time prior to the case

you are arguing, Mr. Prettyman?
MR. PRETTYMAN;

I certainly think that under any

definition, Your Honor, it applies here, and that is in this

5

case at least., it is an order not to print certain information
in advance of that information being printed.
This case, as I said, arose out of scultiple murders
in Lincoln County, Nebraska back in October of *75.

The

suspect, Erwin Simanfcs, was arrested the following morning,
which was a Sunday, and on Monday and Tuesday, as would be
normally expected, a number of stories, factual in nature,
appeared in the local media.

They told about his arrest, they

mentioned that the Lincoln County Attorney had said that Mr.
Simants had made a statement, that the Lincoln County Attorney
had said that he had a theory about the motive which would be
brought out when the autopsy was completed, and it was also
reported that one person, had said that Simants5 father had
told him that Simants had told the father that he had com­
mitted the killings.
QUESTION:

What are the local media in Lincoln

County?
MU. PRETTYMANs

Actually, there is no newspaper in

Sutherland, a small town of 800, where it occurred.
Platte Telegraph is the nearest newspaper.

The North

There are a number

of other newspapers, from Omaha and Denver and so forth, which
permeat, which come into the state.

There fire a number of

radio stations, and there are also several television stations.
1 think you can assume for present purposes that all the media
were into the state.

6

QUESTION :

But In Lincoln County there is no local

media right in —
MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTIONS

— in this town?

MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, and it is not very far away.

And there there is a television station —

MR. PRETTYMAN;
QUESTION:

In North Platte there is a newspaper.

And is North Platte the county seat?

MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTIONs

Not in Sutherland.

The North Platte Telegraph.

— a newspaper, and two or three radio

stations?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

That is ary understanding, yes, sir.

On the Tuesday evening, the prosecutor, in advance
of a preliminary hearing that was expected the next day, moved
for a prior restraint in the county court,
admitted to back it up.

No evidence was

The county court entered an order the

following day in which it said that, because of the reason­
able likelihood of prejudicial news that would make it diffi­
cult if not impossible to empanel an impartial jury, he was
entering the order.
Well, it is a pretty broad order.

It prohibited not

only any evidence that would come forward at the preliminary
hearing, but any evidence apart from the preliminary hearing
except as would be allowed in certain voluntary press bar
guidelines that were then in effect in Nebraska.

That order

7
would have remained in effect even after trial.
As a result of that order,, which the press chose to
obey, the press could not report the following day what hap­
pened at the preliminary hearing, even though it was an open
preliminary hearing.

The public was there, the press was

there, anybody who wanted to be could be there and could
leave and go out and tell anybody he wanted to what had hap­
pened, but the press was prohibited from reporting what had
occurred.
QUESTION s

Under Nebraska law, Mr. Prettyman, could

that have been a closed hearing, with the consent of the de­
fendant?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

We are in a strange situation as re­

gards closed hearings there, because you’ have a statute which
says that it has to be open, but the Nebraska Supreme Court in
this case seems to interpret it in a way that seems to allow
it to have been closed.

Certainly the judge at the time

thought that that hearing had to be open.

I would argue with

you in a different case that it had to be open constitution­
ally, but that isn’t this case.

There is nothing before you

in regard to the closed hearing problem.
Since the Sim&nts case was actually —
QUESTION:

Well, would you agree, Mr. Prettyman,

that to entertain the arguments you advance we must explore
all of the alternatives to what you characterise as prior

8
restraint?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

I think you must say that there are

certainly — I would certainly argue that there are many alter­
natives available.

I would certainly hop® that you would bank

on the Sheppard type alternatives and not on closed hearings.
1 think a. closed hearing is the handmaiden to the prior re­
straint.

And certainly when they are used either alternatively

or,even worse, hand in glove with each other, then you have
really effectively stopped the complete flow of news.
QUESTION?

Well, would you take the same view of an

order directed at the prosecutor and the defense counsel, that
they would be held in contempt if they discussed the case
publicly?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Well, again, Your Honor, that is not

this case and I want to stress it —
QUESTION:

Yes,

MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

— because there is no such —

It is an alternative that you must rely

on —
MR. PRETTYMAN:
ed in Sheppard.

It is an alternative that was suggest­

In a different case, I might be before you

arguing that that is impermissible, but, again, it is not this
case.

I certainly agree that it was an alternative suggested

in Sheppard.
QUESTION:

Well, would it be a prior restraint if

9

he ordered the prosecutor not to discuss the case?
MR. PRETTY MM?:
on the prosecutor.
QUESTION:

Well, it would he a prior restraint

It would —
So would the same constitutional prin­

ciples apply or not?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Oh, absolutely not, Your Honor.

I

should say not.
QUESTIONS

So just the fact that it is a prior re­

straint is not controlling?
MR. PRETTYUAN:

In the prior restraint on the prose­

cutor, you. have a free speech problem for the prosecutor, but
you don't have the direct prior restraint on the press that
you have here.
QUESTION:

What I am trying to figure out is how im­

portant is the label "prior restraint"?
MR. PRETTYMANs

Well, I think insofar as this case

is important, I don't know that the label means vary much, but
what actually occurred is of extreme importance, that is you
have directly prohibited the press from publishing certain
information.

Now, whether you want that label or some other,

that is the issue here, whether you can do that under the
First Amendment.
QUESTION?

Well, I take it though you

vjouIg

guish it between the prosecutor and the press —
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Absolutely.

distin­

10

QUESTION s

— and what is a prior restraint —- what

would be an illegal prior restraint for the press may not be
with respect to the prosecutor may not be?
MR. PRETTYMAN:
may have to decide that.

That's correct;, in the nest case you
But certainly if you are going to

have prior restraints, the one that is worse, the one that
affects the public the most, the most onerous one is the ona
that is the direct prior restraint on the press, as this Court
has recognised in New York Times, Minnesota and other cases.
QUESTIONs

To give an example, to a degree the rules

of evidence and the rules of procedure are a restraint on the
lawyers who are appearing in the court room?
MR. PRETTYMAN%
QUESTIONS

Sure.

Arid, so -t

MR. PRETTYMANs

Just as you can restrict the press

in a court room, too, by not sitting inside the bar and from
doing a number of things, taking pictures and from doing a
number of things.
QUESTION!

Or having sound equipment.

MR. PRETTYMAN!

Absolutely.

There is no question but

that you can impose some restrictions on the press.

The Court

has always distinguished between those incidental restrictions
and the direct prior restraint forbidding a newspaper not to
publish,
QUESTION:

And you say that the prior —- the case is

11
saying that prior restraint comes here with a heavy presumptiers, against it, at least, at their core, they are limited to
cases involving the press rather than to individuals?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Yes, I would say that, Your Honor.

I don't think that you have directly applied the same standards
heretofore.
QUESTION t

You interpret it broadly?

MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Interpreted broadly for the press?

MR. PRETTYMAN:

Yes.

I want to emphasise that the

order that I have just described is not the order before you.
I am going through the four orders simply to give you a feeling
of the difficulty of this area because there are four orders
that have been entered in this case and they are all different.
Because the trial was going to be in the District
Court, the petitioners here went to the District Court and
asked for him to strike the County Court order, and the District
Court entered its own order, and its grounds was because of
the nature of the crimes charged.

He said that there was a

clear and present danger that the pretrial publicity could
impinge on the defendant's right to a fair trial. He also in­
cluded those guidelines as part of his order, but he changed a
number of items and said, for example, that we could not report
the identity of persons sexually assaulted in connection with
these murders.

That order "would have remained in effect until

12

after the jury was sworn.
After a number of procedural problems with which the
Court is fully familiar, and it doesn't involve us now so I
Vv'on't go through them, Mr. Justice Blackmun entered an order
granting in part and staying in part the District Court's order.
He eliminated the guidelines as being too broad and vague, and
he did allow certain information to be published, but he also
prohibited the publiceition of other items, including facts
strongly implicative of the accused or facts highly prejudicial
to the accused.

That order was then succeeded by the fourth

order, which is the one that is before you, and that order is
the one of the Nebraska Supreme Court, entered on December 1,
1975.

It too eliminated the guidelines, but it prohibited the

publication of the existence of content of confessions or ad­
missions against interest made by the accused to law enforce­
ment officers or to third parties, except the press.

And it

also prohibited, and I quote, "other information strongly im­
plicative of the accused as the perpetrator of the slayings,"
whatever that means, and we are not sura.

That applied inter­

estingly only to petitioners and not to all the other media,
and it was effective only as to events which had occurred prior
to the entry of the order.
As a result of all four of these orders, the press
was prohibited from publishing information, most of it coming
from public records and public hearings, for over eleven weeks.

13
The trial followed and Mr, Sintants was found guilty.
Now, insofar as this Nebraska Supreme Court order prohibited the publication of news developed in an open court hearing or from open court records, I just don’t think there can be
any question, and I submit to you it is very clear that that is
blatantly unconstitutional under Craig v. Harney and Estes v.
Texas and Cox Broadcasting.
QUESTIONS
tion.

Mr. Prettyman, just a question of informa­

Mr. Simants has been convicted, has he not?
MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Has he been sentenced to death, do 3/ou

know?
MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Is there an appeal in that case in the

Nebraska Supreme Court?
MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

Has it been heard?

MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:
might

Yes, sir.

No, that is my understand, it has not.

So that there is a possibility that there

that could be heard, he might win a reversal and would

have a new trial?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Correct.

In which case I would assume

the same order would be entered again, if this Court allowed it
to do so.
QUESTION:

I. suppose the first trial, once the jury

14
was empaneled and sworn, it was sequestered?
MR» PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

It was»

The first trial, I suppose, was fully re­

ported by the news media, was it not?
MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

So if there is a new trial, the community

has been apprised of everything at least that came out in open
court?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

As a matter of fact, in this small com­

munity, that community was apprised of everything about this
event, with or without the media.

The gossip and rumors are

clearly indicated in the newspapers and in the record.
QUESTION:

Why is this a live case, Mr. Prettyman?

The

orders have expired?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

It has expired.

I would assume that

you have already made the decision that this is not a snoot case,
because if you recall we moved the Court prior to the expiration
of the order for an expedited hearing, we offered to have briefs
to you in typewritten form the next day, and —
QUESTION:

I am accepting your offer now.

MR. PRETTYMAN:

Sir, that issue, I assume, you have

already passed on, because ■—
QUESTION:

Well, just briefly, why do you think in a

nutshell this is still a live case?
MR. PRETTYMAN;

I think it is a live case because, not

15
only for the reason mentioned by Mr. Blackmun that this order
could be entered again in regards to this very person, but
that orders are coming down from all over the country.

We have

had eleven of them in the last six months, and this is a problem
which is typically under your decisions of such short duration
that unless you are going to take these and face these and rule
on them now, they are just going to continue and they will ex­
pire before you can take one that is alive,

I think it is not

only capable of repetition but it is being repeated every day.
We just had one the other day in Nebraska,
QUESTIONS

Well, I think in Sise Nine and Weinstein v,

Bradford, which was a per curiam that carae down a couple of
months ago, we made it rather clear that they are capable of
repetition but evading review standard applied to these par­
ticular litigants, not just to the issue in general.
MR, PRETTYMAN:

Well, I think you have done that,

Your Honor, and in response to that I would simply say that in
Carroll, that case was moot, and in Jarbone, in the Third
Circuit, that case was moot, and yet the Court nevertheless took
it and decided it, and I would assume it did so on two grounds
— and Judge Gesell, incidentally, also did it after the firing
of Mr. Cox — and it did it on two grounds.

One was that it

could actually apply to the parties in the same cense that Mr.
Justice Blackmun just pointed out, but also that the issue' was
of such moment and was occurring again in other situations and

16
was otherwise so incapable of being decided quickly that it was
necessary for the Court to hear it»
QUESTIONS

Just kind of an exception to Article III

then?
MR. PRETTYMANs
QUESTION:

It is a kind of exception? yes? sir.

Mr. Prettyman? suppose hypothetically —

and I emphasize hypothetically

it was possible that the case

might come here and be reversed with the Sheppard case treat­
ment —MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION;

Yes.

— even after we decided this case?

MR. PRETTYMAN:

I9m sorry? I didn't get the purport

of the question.
QUESTION:

Even after we've decided this case? sup­

pose im decided it in your favor —
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Yes? you decide that prior restraint

is impermissible.
QUESTION:

■— and then his case comes up here? hypo­

thetically and theoretically we could reverse on the ground
that there was excessive publicity.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

You certainly could? but I would be

very surprised because I don’t see how the publicity in this
case could conceivably be called excessive.

It was very factua

and. it was limited? but it is perfectly possible that you could
take the case and reverse it on that ground? yes? sir.

17
QUESTION?

Well, the bottom line is that if we hold

that he might be retried, that is enough to keep it alive, you
don't have to push the other point, do you?
MR. PRETTYMANs

That’s right, sure.

I emphasise that

insofar as the order prohibited what occurred in open court, it
seems to me you have already ruled on it and you have said that
is impermissible.

But this order went further, as I have said,

and would keep us from talking to people and finding out things
about this judicial proceeding, and therefore I have to go
further.

And I think in order tc make the point, let me give

you a hypothetical, because it seems to me that the fact that
this is the press somehow is giving the courts a strange impres­
sion that you can enter these orders that they would!)81 do
under other circumstances.
Let us just suppose for a moment that every minister,
priest and rabbi in Lincoln County had gotten — every one of
them- had gotten together a couple of weeks before this gentle­
man ’s trial and they had decided that Mr. Simants was the
embodiment of the devil and that they were going to have to do
something about him, were going to make him a symbol, and that
they were going to gat together on Sunday and Saturday in their
pulpits and they were going to reveal his confession, they were
going to reveal the sexual nature of his crimes, they were
going to condemn him as guilty, and they were going to ask for
the death penalty.

18

And in order for me to make my point, if you will
assume with me that all of the overwhelming majority of the
people in Lincoln County went to their churches and synagogues
that next Sunday, is there any question but that this Court
would sanction a prior restraint on the giving of those
sermons?

I don't think any judge would say that you can enjoin

those people from getting up in their pulpits and talking about
his confession,

And it somehow doesn't seem so bad to the

courts, at least that is what is going on around the country,
when they do it in regard to the press.

And yet, as you

pointed out, Mr. Justice Stewart, in your Yale speech, the
press is the one private organization that, is carged out and
mentioned specifically «a entitled to protection under the
Pirst Amendment.
QUESTION:

What if the president of the Lincoln

County Bar Association had done what your hypothetical calls
for the priests, rabbis and pastors doing, had a meeting of
the Lincoln County Bar Association?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

I think that then they might possibly

have been held in contempt after the event.

They certainly

would have been called up under the canons of ethics, but that
no prior restraint could possibly have been entered.
QUESTION:

Mr. Prettyman, what if your ministers had

also agreed that they would advocate lynching the man, could a
prior restraint be permitted then?

13
MR. PRETTYMAN%
QUESTION:

I do not believe so, no, sir.

Well, how is the president of the Lincoln

County Bar Association any better off if he is called up on
contempt and fined $500 than if he is preliminarily enjoined,
cited for contempted when he makes the speech and fined $500
for civil contempt?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Well, Your Honor, the difference be­

tween prior restraint and a contempt after the event has just
been made so clear through all of your opinions.

The prior

restraint, in the first place, people tend to obey them and
therefore it directly prohibits the doing of the event.

In

the second place, if he is going to be held for contempt, he
can contest the order itself.

He can even get a jury trial.

He can contest the contempt order.
you can’t do it.

But in a prior restraint,

If the prior restraint is entered, you then

must obey it under the law as it now stands until it is re­
versed on appeal.

And if you go in and try to attack the

order, the only defense is that you didn't violate it, that
you can't attack the order itself.

So there is a great differ-

ence between the two situations, certainly in terms of impact.
We say that the assumption that someone who hears
about a case, even an alleged confession, the fact that he
can’t be impartial or, if he is partial, that he can't be
weeded out during the voir dire is simply unsupported.
fact, it is directly refuted by statutes in Nebraska and

In

20
elsewhere which we have cited in our reply brief which allow
jurors to sit even if they have formed opinions of guilt from
reading newspapers, so long as the judge is satisfied that
that jury is impartial.

The courts have made it clear, from

United States v. Burr in 1807 all down through Irvin v. Dowd
and Reynolds and Murphy v. Florida, that a juror can give an
impartial verdict even if he has some preconceived notion as
to guilt.

And if we need any examl es of that, we have cer­

tainly had them recently with Ca31y, Chapin, Mitchell, Connally,
Liddy, all of whom stand, it seems to me, as irrefutable proof
that even all pervasive publicity does not necessarily result
in an unfair trial.
We trust our juries in so many ways.

We sit there

and tell them, look, don’t listen to the confession given by
your co-defendant, it doesn't apply to you, and we give them
these instructions and we trust them and *?e expect therm to do
their job, and Nebraska is not willing to conceive that with
proper voir dire and proper constructions that you, can't find
twelve people who are going to try to give this man an impar­
tial and fair verdict.
Thera are ample ways short of prior restraint to deal
with adverse publicity.

Sheppard — I counted twelve of them

in Sheppard, and I don't need to go through them because you
are certainly aware of them, but certainly two of them, change
of venue and continuance, neither of which were given here,

21

would obviously be —
QUESTION:

There was a request for a change of

venue that was denied?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

This is not in the record,, but the

fact is
QUESTIONs

Well, I thought I read it in the brief

somewhere.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

— that there was a request for a

change of venue, which was denied.

There was not a request

for a continuance and the judge did not grant one sua sponte.
QUESTION:

And under Nebraska law, the change of

venue could be only to an adjacent county, is that correct?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Yes, that is correct.

sponse to that is two-fold,

And our re­

First of all, even if you put the

surrounding counties together, you’ve got over 80,000 people,
so you are certainly going to be able to find twelve jurors.
But, secondly, under the Groppi case and Irvin v. Dowd, I
think that that provision would be unconstitutional if it in
effect prevented him from getting twelve impartial jurors.
QUESTION:

If the trial judge entered an order, a

protective order along the lines yen have intimated as an
alternative, namely a written directive or a directive on the
record to the prosecutor that he is not to talk to anyone,
specifically including media, and the defense counsel the same,
to the witnesses, would the media representatives be in

22
violation if they importuned these people to violate the order?
MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTIONS

I don*t believe so, Your Honor,

Could an order appropriately be entered

that they should not importune the prosecutor to violate the
order?
MR. PRETTYMAN:
access.

That would be an order prohibiting

It would be an order in effect stopping theirs from

seeking out news, and I think it would have many of the same
constitutional infirmities that this one had.

It would not be

as direct, but I think that it would be close to it.
QUESTIONs

But you think it is all right to put the

order on the attorneys?
MR. PRETTYMAN:
stitutionality of that.

I have said I do not concede the con­
I have simply

said that it is not

involved here and. that I recognise that Sheppard cited it as
one alternative.
QUESTION:

When you suggest — what are the alterna­

tives that you think would survive constitutional scrutiny?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Well, I think certainly that a con­

I think certainly the change of venue would.

I think when you get to trial, certainly sequestation would.
I think that you can even bring in a foreign jury, if necessary,
if it came down to that bad a case.

But I want to emphasise

to you that somehow the assumption is that simply because you
have a danger that a jury might hear some bad things, that you

23

are not going to have a trial.

every single person in the United States saw it?

QUESTION:

You would have

But you wouldn't say go free.

Well, is that the issue really, Mr.

Prefctyman, or is the issue that a defendant has a constitution­
al right to be protected from influences that will impair a
fair trial?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

That is what Sheppard is all about.

-That -is what Sheppard gives him.

It gives him & number of ways

that he can protect himself short of prior restraint.

It is

very instructive that in Sheppard, despite all of these ways
that were listed, the Court three times made clear that it was
not talking about prior restraint on the press, and therefore
you don't have this conflict that everyone seems to assume you
have.

We have ways of.protecting jurors, and that is the

point I want to make most strongly, that, you can protect them
and that you have a constitutional jury, as I say, even if you
have people who have read the newspapers and who come to the
jury room first with some kind of preconceived notion. As I say,
they even have a statute in Nebraska which makes certain that

24
a juror is not stricken just because he has read a newspaper
and has heard some bad publicity.

The judges have the right

to determine for themselves whether that man is impartial.
I want to save a little bit of time for rebuttal, so
can I just, simply say that it seems to me that, at this point
in time, after two-hundred years, when we have let our press
print what it is able to get, to subject them now to a prior
restraint, after all of this time, is to take away one of the
great liberties that we have.

I don't think we have to look

very far around the world, and 1 don't think we have to look
very far outside of this country to understand the extraordin­
ary importance of allowing the press, the only really free
press probably left in the world, to publish what it has gotten
hold of so that the public can be contemporaneously informed
of all of that,
If one of those Watergate people had broken in and
had immediately confessed that he had broken into the
Democratic Headquarters at the direction of the White House,
could we restrain for six months from trial time the fact that
that had happened?

That is what you are going to get into.

You are going to get into decisions as to, well, some of these
confessions raay be, ought to be in the public interest, we
will get them, out and some of them we shouldn't — don’t put
the courts into that position.

They are not equipped to handle

it, and the values are too great.

Mr. Prefctyraan, let me interject the moment

of lightness in all this seriousness.

World-Herald.
MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

The judge of the Eighth Circuit sent me

this very brief clipping from the Omaha World-Herald, your
client.

I read it in its entirety, as illustrative of "a

responsible press”:
"Three Justices of the Nebraska Supreme Court and
Judge Donald Lay, of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in
St. Louis, will take part next weak in a seminar on appellate
practice in Nebraska,

Anyone having information that leads to

the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible
are asked to contact Joe Smith.”

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FLOYD ABRAMS, ESQ,,
OH BEHALF OF NBC, AS AMICI CURIAE
MR. ABRAMS s
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

26

Mr. Prettyman represents, as he has advised you,
large elements of the Nebraska press,

I appear here today on

behalf of a variety of publishers, broadcasters and journalists
from around the country to join with that press and to urge
upon you today a ruling which would be unthinkable in any
nation in the world except ours and unlikely in the rest, that
it is in our view entirely consistent with American history
makes it. no less remarkable but simply points to the remark­
able nature of that history, for what we would ask of you is
nothing less than a renunciation of power, the conclusion by
this Court that the Judiciary should not and indeed may not
tell the press in advance what news it may print, save only in
that rare national security situation, in that rare national
security case adverted to by this Court in Near v. Minnesota,
in the Pentagon Papers case, and what we urge upon you in that
denunciation that occurred two-hundred years ago, that it has
been reaffirmed by this Court since its formation and that
you should reaffirm it today.
Mr. Justice Stevens asked earlier whether the label
prior restraint was important here and what the relevance of
it is, and I would like to devote the bulk of my remarks to
that question.
I would like to start historically, because I think
it is important to note that until very recently it was ac­
cepted by one and all that whatever else could be done to the

27
press with respect to pretrial publicity, the one thing that
could not be done was any kind of prior restraint*

Twenty

years ago this month, if I can be personal for a moment, I was
on a college debating team and we used to talk about this sub­
ject and debate this subject full-time for a year.

I know all

the remedies that people proposed to control what was then
thought sometimes to be an irresponsible press.

No one even

suggested in the scholarly works ox* in our debates the idea of
prior restraint.

So understood was it that, while there could

be some area perhaps for contempt of court after trials were
over, that there could be no prior restraints in the area.

And

we were not alone.
The oases supported us, as they existed then.

Our

brief, submitted on behalf of amici curiae that I represent,
indicate that in our effort to survey all the cases in this
area in American history, we come upon only five prior to the
Sheppard case in which there is any reports at all of any
attempt to obtain prior restraints against the press, and that
in each of those cases it was easily and summarily reversed.
There have, of course, been many cases since Sheppard --- and,
while it is true that nearly all of them have been reversed,
all but one or two or three at the most, it is also true that
prior restraints on the press around the country are becoming
common place.
Within the last year, New York has had its first,

.28
New- Jersey has had its first and its second, and Nebraska has
had its first and second and third.

And I think it is a fair

question to ask what is new or what has changed to lead to the
start of a process by which prior restraints are now being
issued in almost common place fashion.

But I would urge on

you, it is not that the press has been more irresponsible, by
anyone * s judgment, within the last few years than in the years
preceding it.

The days of the front page are over, if they

ever existed, and even the Patty Hearst trial bore no resem­
blance to that of Sam Sheppard or Bruno Hauptmann.
It in not that guilty defendant? are walking free on
the streets because of the press and because of the sometimes
perhaps excessive pretrial publicity, and it is not that inno­
cent men, so far as we can tell, are in jail because of irre­
sponsible press coverage of trials.

And it is not, I would

urge on you, that we now have reason to think that juries are
less trustworthy than we ever thought they were.

Indeed, as

Mr, Prettyman indicated, I can hardly think of a time in our
history when juries have proved their mettle in a more strong
basis than they have within the last few years.

Nor is it that

studies of scholars, of judges, of lawyers and of journalists
have concluded within the last few years that anything has
changed and that we should retreat from abhorrence of prior
restraint in this area.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Abrams, neither you so far nor Mr.

29

Pretfcyman have referred to the trial judge's post-trial inquiry
of the jury.

1 hope at some point before you sit down you will

give us your comments on that,
MR. ABRAMS:

Surely, Your Honor.

In fact, I will

turn to that right now, after just observing that there are
/

/

five separate studies ira this area by bar association groups
and the like, and each of those conclude that prior restraints
e.re constitutionally impermissible or unwise with both of them.
With respect to the post-trial study, I would have a
few comments to make.
record of this case.

First, it is really devoid ‘of the
Mr. Prettyman, in his brief, urged upon

you that if you cared to take account •>* that post-trial, study,
that the petitioners before; you should be permitted to put in
a post-trial study of their own, which is a poll taken by the
North Platte Newspaper of the jurors as to what they meant when
the judge asked them those questions after the trial.

I suspect

you will not be interested in that poll, but I think it is
first a rather unreliable study.

I think the phraseology of

the study is, to say the least, slanted.

And I am struck by

the fact, as Mr. Prettynan's brief argues to you, that one
would believe jurors at the post-trial moment, when they are
asked that question, and not believe them when they are asked
if they could give a fair trial in the voir dire time prior to
a trial beginning.
It seems to me a good part of what is involved in

30

this case involves just that question of whether we can trust
jurors or not.

As 1 have urged upon you, we think there is no

time in our history when jurors have better indicated their
ability to decide cases and to decide them without reliance cf.
outside factors, which might have been indicated and which
others might have thought might have affected them.
Slow, we have urged upon you the Sheppard case.

We

have urged it again and again, and it is for you to decide
whether our interpretation of Sheppard and our reading of
Sheppard is correct.

It is supported, we urge on you, by the

higher courts of New York and California and by the Court of
Appeals for the Firth Circuit.

And I can think of only one

other reason, apart from what I believe, to be- a misinterpre-*
t&tion by many lower courts of the Sheppard decision, for the
amount of gag orders or restrictive orders that have been
issued in recent years.
X detect, for* what it may be worth to you, a profound
and growing sense of judicial concern at what is sometimes
viewed to be irresponsibility on the part of the press and its
coverage of courts and of other matters.

X have been con-»

fronted, when X have argued before other courts than this, with
a number of questions relating to just those matters, relating
essentially to matters of responsibility.

And X could do no

more with respect to that than to urge on you the language in
the CBS case of the Chief Justice and the full majority of the

31
Court that the risks of abuse of the First Amendment were well
known to the framers, who accepted the reality that risks of
those abuse were evils for which there was no acceptable
remedy other than toe spirit of moderation and a sense of
responsibility and civility on the part of those who exercise
the guarantee of the freedom of expression.
I wish to be clear.

We may be back some day, I sus­

pect some of us will, representing clients, some of our
brethren representing clients will be back, urging on you the
proposition that the power to hold the press in contempt is
very narrow, that the power to punish the press for what it
prints is narrower still, but historically the power to ban the
press in advance from deciding what to print is narrowest
still, and that is this case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Abrams, before you proceed, I think

perhaps I missed something.

You were tailing us of the demon­

strable see-change in judicial attitude in recent years, and.
then you told us why it was not attributable to this and not
attributable to that and not attributable to the other tiling.
What 1 missed I think was your ”0 Henry* ending.

What is it

attributable to?
MR. ABRAMS:

Mr. Justice Stewart, what I meant to

convey and perhaps got lost in conveying was that I think it
is attributable to two separate things.

One is a misreading,

as we view it, of the Sheppard case by lower 'Courts around the

32

country.

And second is what 1 described as what X view at

least or what X see at least as a continuing sense of judicial
concern at the natura of the reporting which occurs with re­
spect to the judicial process.
I think it is.

Those are the two things that

It is also, I think, and we have urged upon

you in our amici brief, a misreading of those cases ©f this
Court which deal with the heavy burden on prior restraints.

X

did not understand the concept of heavy burden on prior re­
straints to be an invitation to enter prior restraints when on
some basis or another it was thought useful to do so.
We believe that the nature of the prior restraint
idea as set forth in Southeastern Promotions case by Justice
Blackraun, and that you must take into account in deciding
whether there can be prior restraints at all whether historic­
ally there has been a category established here of prior re­
straints which are acceptable in this area and an exception to
what the Court in Southeastern Promotions referred to as the
prohibition against prior restraints.
QUESTION:
question.

Mr. Abrams, let me just ask a specific

What do you do about the problem of the inadmissible

confession?

Sav for some reason a confession is very dramatic

but yet it would be rather clear that it would not ha admis­
sible to trial.

Is that just something we have to live with,,

there is no way of curtailing the publication of that kind of
information?

33

MR. ABRAMS:

Well, I think you have to live with it,

Mro Justice Stevens, and one of the ways that you live with it
is by giving jury instructions-,' by appropriate voir dires, by
all of the Sheppard methods.

But to take your question at its

narrowest, yes, it is ouz- view that there are such things as
we do have to live with, if it finally comes to that, be it
confessions or something else.
I would close with this observation:

We well appre­

ciate that there are casos in which this Court must sit as a
drawer of very hard to draw lines on an ad hoc basis, on a
case by case basis.

There are, of course? areas xtl which it

may properly be said, as -Justice Holmes did, that the power to
tax: is not the power to destroy while this Court sits.
We believe the power to make prior restraints on
news reporting is the power to destroy, and we urge this court,
not. to permit the birth or growth of such a rule of law.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Abrams.

Mr, Mosher.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD MOSHER, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT STUART
MR. MOSHER:

Mr'. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
I am Harold Mosher, Assistant Attorney General of the
State of Nebraska, representing the Honorable Hugh Stuart,

34
Judge of Lincoln County.

Mr. Milton Larson.? Lincoln County

Attorney? is also with me here today and will argue certain
aspects of the case.

8;00

Let !ner if I may, take this case from the tops

p.»u, October 18, 1975, KNOP, the only television station in
North Platte? began transmitting the NBC Saturday Night Movie,
"The Deadly Tower," a dramatisation of the 1966 massacre of 16
persons and the wounding of 31 others by a sniper atop the
tower at the University of Texas*, in Austin,
By an uncanny coincidence, the movie provided the
electric background for another grotesque mass murder.

About

18 minutes into the movie, a KNOP newsman answered a telephone
call from the sheriff's office which requested the television
station to put a warning on the air that there had been a kill*’
ing at nearby Sutherland, Nebraska? and that everyone should
lock their doors and windows.
The case at bar was born.

It is therefore proper

that certain events be reviewed and placed in their proper
perspective.

The town of Sutherland is located in western

Nebraska between the North and South Platte Rivers,
cattle country, cattle country at its very best.

It is

The town of

Sutherland has 1970 population of approximately 800 persons.

The population today is somewhat larger due to & number of
transient workers who are employed in the construction of a
huge electrical generating facility nearby.

35
Following the television announcement, law enforce­
ment officers in the Sutherland area continued their investiga­
tion of the crime.

And early the next morning, on a tip by a

reliable informer, they arrested the respondent, Erwin Charles
Simants, near the scene of the crime,
QUESTIOMs

Mr. Mosher, suppose that after the restric­

tive order challenged here as prior restraint had gone into
effect that the local television station decided to rerun the
dramatisation of the Texas sniper killings and both the defense
and the prosecution came to the court and said this was going
to stir up all kinds of passion and prejudice and impede a fair
trial and we want a restraining order to restrain the showing
of the dramatisation of the Texas city affair, cl© you think
that would be an appropriate matter for the trial court to
consider?
MR, MOSHER:

X doubt it very much, Your Honor,

I

doubt it very iraeh.
QUESTION:

Do you think it would have a tendency to

provoke passions and prejudices?
MR. MOSHERs

I doubt it, I really do.

That, of

course, is not the issue in this case, but I really doubt it
very much.

When it is all said and don© —- and I will get to

it, with your permission, in a few moments — the so-called
restraining order here by the Supreme Court of Nebraska is
purely a very narrow one, and the court was simply not called

36
■upon to go any further, and it certainly did not.

But just

because of the particular aspect like this, I doubt it.

1

doubt it, because there are so many other variables in the
world in which we live.

Movies nearby may be showing certain

types of film which in and of themselves one might argue could
%

lead to this kind of thing.

But I seriously doubt that one

could perhaps, in a given case one might make a showing.

I am

at a loss, however, to suggest what that showing might be.
QUESTION;

Could I just question your characteriza­

tion of the order as a narrow one.

It does include, as I

understand the way it has been narrowed down, the prohibition
against publishing any information strongly implicative of the
accused as the perpetrator of the slain.

Do you regard that

as a narrow prohibition?
MR. MOSHER;
QUESTION:

Certainly.

May I get to it in a moment?

Yes, certainly.

I don5t want to take you

out of order.
MR. MOSHSRs

Certainly.

Let me continue though with

some facts, if I may, because I think they are important.
Following his arrest, in fact the same day, October 19th, Erwin
Charles Simants was charged with sisc counts of murder in the
first degree by a complaint filed by the County Attorney, and
thereafter that same day Siraants was arraigned arda preliminary
hearing was scheduled for October 27, 197S.
The statement on page five of the brief of the

37
respondents — pardon sue, the petitioners — that, “On October
20, the Lincoln. County Attorney told the press that Simants
had given authorities *a statement'” exemplifies the need in
cases such as this for the trial courts to be able to restrict
the media in certain cases.

Specifically, the quote on page

five of the petitioners brief refers the reader to page 88 of
the joint appendix, and there, sure enough, is a copy of a
newspaper, and the quote,

“Lincoln County Attorney Milton

Larson said Monday that Simants has given authorities a state­
ment . ”
Putting aside for a moment how the repetition of
quotations such as that could influence a community where a
jury will ultimately be chosen is the naked fact that the
statement is falsa.

Indeed, the writer, who is the bureau

chief of one of the Nation's largest wire services, has now
admitted that hearsay of an ambulance driver's husband was
falsely attributed to the County Attorney, thus the petition­
ers themselves have demonstrated in this Court at tills time the
need for restrictive orders in cases such as this.

It is

therefore not -—
QUESTIONi

Would that mean, Mr. Mosher, just an

order restricting them from making falsa statements or raking
any statements?
MR. MOSHER:

I think it means, Youir Honor, that,

first of all, before they are going to get to a question like

38
this, before they would ever get to it again,, is whether or
not this Court is going to allow the Supreme Court of Nebraska
to implement section 3.1 of the Guidelines of the American Bar
Association's Fair Trial-—Free Press.
If you allow the Supreme Court of Nebraska to imple­
ment that particular section, the section provides that de­
fense counsel may move, timely move, at any time prior to
trial, to close the hearing, close the hearing, and thereby
insure that matters of this will not be made public prior to
the actual trial.
As you know today, defense counsel has a myriad of
tools at his disposal to discover the government's case against,
the individual.

And any defense counsel worth his salt can

certainly learn 'whether or not there is a confession.

He can

also at that time also make adequate presentation to the
court that not only should the preliminary hearing be closed,
but that the prosecution in and of itself is not to make public
statements about the nature of a confession.
Ey ding this in this manner, this type of an error
simply will not repeat itself.
The same day that this quote appeared in the morning
newspaper, the County Attorney filed a motion for a restrictive
order, which requested the count;/ court to restrict publication of testimony to be set at the preliminary hearing.
hearing was had on that motion the same evening.

The

The attorneys

39

representing the state, the defendant, and the news media were

Simants joined the state's motion to restrict publication of
testimony from the preliminary hearing.

He even went a step

further and asked that the restrictive order be broadened to
close the preliminary hearing.
counsel were overruled.

The motions of the defense

The motion of the state was sustained»

The next day
QUESTION:

Mr. Mosher, you have, I gather, two hear­

ings in Nebraska prior to the trial, at least two.

One is an

arraignment and the other is the preliminary hearing.
MR. MOSHER:
QUESTION;
MR. MOSHER;
QUESTION:

That is correct.
And which comes first?
The arraignment is first.
And what is the function and purpose of an

arraignment?
MR. MOSHER:

Primarily the only function of it is to

set a time for a preliminary hearing.

It serves a second func­

tion, to determine whether or not the accused has sufficient
funds to secure the services ©f an attorney.

That is all the

so-called arraignment does.
QUESTION:

There is no evidence at an arraignment

hearing?
MR. MOSHER:

None whatsoever.

The court, just simply

40

at that stage of the game merely makes inquiry if the defendant
desires an attorney, if he has the funds to secure one, and
if not an application at that time is made, counsel is appointed and the date for preliminary hearing is set.
QUESTIONi

There is no pleading at the arraignment

hearing?
MR. MOSHER:
QUESTION:

None whatsoever, absolutely none.
But there may be a waiver of the prelimin­

ary hearing, might there?
MR. MOSHER:
QUESTION:
MR. MOSHER:

Yes, it can be waived,
I mean then,
I doubt it.

I doubt it.

It probably

could at that time if the defendant was represented by counsel.
But for the defendant in and of himself to waive it at that
time, I don’t know if the court would allow it.
QUESTIONs
MR. MOSHER:

That’s fine.
They have never had that precise ques­

tion that I know of in the history of the state.
QUESTION:

Jit the preliminary hearing, does he plead

at that time?
MR. MOSHER:
QUESTIONs
MR. MOSHER:
QUESTION:

At the preliminary hearing?
Yea.
Very rarely.
Generally, the purpose of the preliminary

hearing is to see whether or not there is a prima facie case

41
and whether or not to bind him over, is that it?
MS. MOSHER:

That is correct,

preliminary hearing does two things;

The purpose of the

It puts the burden on

the government to prove to the examining magistrate, one, that
a crime has been committed; and, two, that the probable cause
— not proof beyond a reasonable doubt — but the probable
cause to believe that the accused committed the crime charged.
If there is, it goes to the District Court where the trial is
held on the merits,
QUESTION:

Well, then, when does he plead?

When does

he plead?
MR. MOSHER:
QUESTION:
MR. MOSHER:
QUESTION:

In the District Court.
Not until then?
That is correct.
He doesn’t do it at the arraignment and

doesn't do it at the preliminary hearing?
MR. MOSHER:
QUESTION;

No, absolutely not,
And generally the defendant doesn’t adduce

any evidence at the preliminary hearing, does he?
MR. MOSHER:

Well, fee may in a given case.

In a

given ease, counsel may very well feel that the evidence
adduced by the government is so weak that it can be exploited
at that level.

Weaknesses can be shown through testimony, I

have seen cases in which that is exactly the case, in which
case, even though one might argue that on its face the

42
government presented a prima facie case, the fact remains that
the trial judge, or the magistrate, if you will, is the
credibility, is the trier of facts, it is upon him to make the
determination, what witnesses are to him to be believed and
whether or not the bind over is to follow®
QUESTION:

And the preliminary hearing is normally

open to the public?
MR. MOSHER;

Normally it is open to the public, yes,

Your Honor.
QUESTION;

The statute that was construed by the

Supreme Court of Nebraska is the one that requires a public
hearing but only at the trial itself, as the court has con­
strued it?
MR. MOSHER:

I do not understand your question, if

you would give it to me again.
QUESTION;

Does the Nebraska statute, as presently

construed, require that the preliminary hearing be open to the
public?
MR. MOSHER;
QUESTION;
MR. MOSHER:

Certainly.
It does?
The statute, in and of itself, says

that you cannot close it except for certain reasons.

Now, the

Supreme Court of Nebraska, in its December 1 opinion in this
case, has said that, by implementing section 3.1, the American
Bar Association Standards, that preliminary hearing can be

43
closed under certain circumstances, and those circumstances are
the ones which are enumerated in section 3.1.
The next day, the preliminary hearing was held on
the amended complaint which charged murder in the first degree,
and further charges that one or more of the murders was com™
mitted in the perpetration of one or more sexual assaults.
After testimony from several witnesses and the in­
troduction of other evidence, Simants was bound over to the
District Court for trial.

The very next day, October 23rd,

attorneys representing the media in the aforesaid criminal
case filed a motion requesting that argument be heard on a
challenge of the constitutionality of this restrictive order.
The District Court granted the motion to intervene and four
days later, on October 27thr the District Court terminated
the County Court's order and imposed one of its own.
Late in the afternoon of Friday, October. 31, 1375,
the petitioners sought relief in the Supreme Court of Nebraska
on two procedural rights; filed im appeal from the District
Court's order and at the same time they filed a petition in
the Supreme Court of Nebraska for leave to file an original
action in the nature of a writ of mandamus.
Obviously, the Supreme Court of Nebraska could not
have been expe ;ted to order the partias to write briefs and
drive over 200 miles to Lincoln .and to give oral argument on
these two cases the same day in which they were docketed, late

44
Friday afternoon, October 31, 1975? nor could the Supreme Court
©f Nebraska be expected to hear the cases the following week,
and that it had previously called store than fifty cases for
oral argument that week.

In order to hear argument on that

many cases, the Supreme Court of Nebraska divided itself into
two divisions, and it brought in several district judges to
help with the caseload.
Thus, the statement on page 20 of the reply brief of
the petitioners, and I quote, that "the Nebraska Supreme Court
refused to act expeditiously in this case® is s-imply unfair and
contrary to fact.
To compound the problem, the Supreme Court of Nebraska
learned that while the two cases were pending in it® court, the
petitioners had previously contacted Mr. Justice Blackmun of
this Court, as the Justice assigned to the Eighth Circuit, and
asked him to stay the order entered by the District Court of
Nebraska.

The Supreme Court of Nebraska immediately issued a

memorandum opinion in which it noted that the petitioners were,
seeking concurrent relief in both this Court and the Supreme
Court of Nebraska, and consequently declined to fake action so
long as the position of the exercising of parallel jurisdic­
tion of the Supreme Court of the United States could not be
determined.

It did, however, continue the action until this

Court made known whether or not it would accept jurisdiction.
On November 13th, Mr. Justice Blackmun, in his

43

capacity as Circuit Judge, issued a chambers opinion in which
he noted the desire to refrain from issuing or denying a stay
until the Nebraska Supreme Court had an opportunity to act.
The very next day, November 14th, the Supreme Court
©f Nebraska set the original action in the writ of mandamus
as well as the appeal for oral argument on November 25th,

It

notified counsel to file typewritten briefs to expedite the
hearing.

And thus I again submit to you that any statement

attributed to the Supreme Court of Nebraska that it failed to
act expeditiously in this matter simply is contrary to fact.
On November 20th, Mr. Justice Blackman —
QUESTION;

Mr. Mosher, isn't eleven days a pretty

long time under the circumstances?
MR. MOSHERs
QUESTIONs

Not really, Your Honor.
The excuse given, as I remember, was that

they had some kind of a seminar to attend.
MR. MOSHERs
that I can't answer.

I am not privy to that information, so
I can tell you, though, that the court

in that period of time, and when it was first docketed, on
Friday, October 31st, the following week, through Monday and
Tuesday of the second week, heard fifty-some cases, I believe,
as a matter of fact, it was 53, and that is a terrible case­
load for any court to carry.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Attorney General, that doesn't

help us in this case, does it?

46
MR. MOSHERz
all.

It does not help you in this case at

All that it really does though is set the background as

to how this case cams here and under what circumstances, be­
cause I do not. want to leave you with the impression, nor do I
want anyone else to leave you with the impression that somehow
or another the courts in Nebraska, ware derelict in this
matter.

They simply were not»
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, don't we have to

decide whether it was the routine case or an exceptional case?
And which is your position?
MR. MOSHER;

Well, I think this was an exceptional

OS.SO «

J*-

QUESTIONS

Well, then, should not the Supreme Court

of Nebraska have expedited it?
MR. MOSHER;
QUESTION;

They did.
Well, then, what is the relevance of these

27 or 30 other cases on the -docket?
MR. MOSHER:

Well, Your Honor, when you have called

fifty cases for oral argument, there is just no way to stop it.
QUESTIONs

In other words, it is fairly exceptional

but not extremely exceptional?
MR. MOSHER;

Well, there is no way to stop it.

If

you have got 53 cases coming in for argument the next day, and
these attorneys are coming in from a,11 over the state, at a

QUESTION%

Well, I would suggest that maybe they

just had to replace one case on the docket and heard this one
first»
MR, MOSHER:

Perhaps that could have been done, but

perhaps also, four Honor, there was a need for time to brief
the matter,
QUESTION:
another way.

Well, Mr. Attorney General, let's put it

If there were 500 cases, would it have made any

difference?
MR* MOSHER:
QUESTION:

500 casas would have
What, do the numbers have to do with the

point we've got before us?
MR. MOSHER:

Only to the point, as I have said, Your

Honors, to try to impress upon you that the fact that the
Supreme Court of Nebraska was not derelict.

But let's turn to

the first issue
QUESTION:

Let me just interrupt; once more.

Aren't

you demonstrating that one or the vices in these orders is
that inevitably they will remain in effect for some period of
time until the judicial process can face up to the question of
whether to remove them, that that is an inevitable part of
the procedure, i.f you once enter the order?
¥ '

MR. MOSHER:

Well, there is always a certain time

lag, 'four Honor, there has to be.

That is just part of the

48
system.

But to say that ten or eleven days is unreasonable,

I don’!t consider it to be.
that it is unreasonable.

Someone else can very well argue
I just know that what the court was

up against, I just know that they heard arguments for nine days
and for them to say then that they took eleven days before
this was set down, at the same time giving the attorneys the
proper time to brief the matter, I don't consider^it to be un­
reasonable.
There are, though, several issues, and I would like
to address myself to them.

First is the first very basic

issue, and that is whether or not the courts have the power
and under what circumstances to enter a valid protective order.
The answer

seems to me unequivocal — the

courts do have the

power.
There are a few basic considerations, it seems to me,
make this conclusion absolutely necessary.

One, the pure

administration of justice is one of the most essential func­
tions of government.

Every other right, including the right

of a free press, may well depend upon the ability to get a
judicial hearing zu dispassionate, as impartial.as the weakness
inherent in men will permit.
Two, the media has the power, whether lawful or not,
to destroy the right to a fair trial.

Not only does it have

this power, but it has been exercised, as demonstrated in the
case of Sheppard, v. Maxwell.

49
Three, no government: can. long endure if it can permit
private persons or persons to prevent the discharge of one of
its essential functions.

The press has taken the position that

the courts have no power, save national security, to issue a
restrictive order.

That position, 1 submit to you, finds no

support whatever in the Constitution of the United States, nor
does it find any support in the teachings of this Court.
Two dangerous impressions, moreover, are left in the
position that the petitioners have taken in this case.

One is

that the press is above the law, and the other is that the
people and the government are antagonistic and thus the press
will somehow protect the people from the government.

We submit

to you that these impressions are based upon misconceptions.
The fundamental principles of American law and from
Anglo-American law for at least 700 years is that no one is
above the law, and. certainly neither the Constitution nor the
people has conferred upon private corporations, whether engaged
in the publishing, in the broadcasting business, or any other
business — not even the President of the United States ~~ all
are under the law and none have the right and the sole discre­
tion to prevent the judicial branch or any other branch of the
government from carrying out its assigned functions.
Secondly, America's greatest claim to its place in
history is its government of the people, by the people, and for
the people.

If is the government who is at the control of the

50

people.

The people want and they need a news media to assist

them in this process, but only tinder the law and not above it.
Freedom of the press simply is not absolute.

Indeed, absolute

discretion is not granted, is granted to no one under the
Constitution.

Ours is a government of laws, it is not a

government of men.
Thus, it cannot seriously be doubted that the courts
have the power to render broad protective orders.

The critical

issue is under what circumstances can a restrictive order be
entered and what should be its scope.

The issue here is

delicate, it is a. delicate balancing of the interests between
the First and Sixth Amendments.

This is where the courts must

give careful consideration to the important functions the media
performs.
Perhaps a good place to start is preliminary hearings
apd since it is a likely source of most restrictive orders.
As I have previously alluded to you, under Nebraska law, one
i

who believes he has been unjustly charge with a criminal offense:
has a right to a prompt preliminary hearing before a magistrate.
At that particular hearing, the government does have the
burden of proving, one, whether cr not a. crime has been com­
mitted? and, two, whether or not the parson charged committed
the crime.
The dissemination of public information at that stage
of the trial can in a proper case create havoc in providing the

51

defendant with a fair trial, because frequently at such hear­
ings there is testimony relating to confessions.

And 1 call

your attention to several empirical studies, empirical studies
which are cited on pages 10 and 13 of the brief of Respondent
Stuart, which demonstrate how the publication of a confession
or the fact that one has been given can in a particular case
deny that criminal defendant a fair trial.
In the case of Estes v. Texas, this Court itself ob­
served that a pretrial can create a major problem for the de­
fendant in a criminal case.

Indeed, the Court went on to state

that pretrial publicity may be more harmful than publicity
during the trial, for it may well set the community opinion as
to guilt or innocence.
QUESTION:

Mr. Mosher, a minute ago you said that

frequently at pretrial hearings there would be an offer of a
confession.
MR. MOSHER;
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Is that typical in Nebraska of felony pre-

trials, that more often than not if there has been a confes­
sion, the state will seek to offer it?
MR. MOSHER:
no answer, Your Honor.

I don't know if I can give you a yes or
It will depend an awful lot on the

facts in the particular case.

In this particular case that you

have before you, no eyewitnesses survived, and so if the
government was going to make much of a case, certainly a

52
confession was a way of doing it»

There were simply no eye­

witnesses to this heinous crime.
QUESTION:

Was the confession in fact offered at the

pretrial?
MR. MOSHER:

It was — pardon me

it was.

To cope vrith the procebelia prejudice in a case at
bar, the Supreme Court of Nebraska restricted the petitioners
from publishing confessions and admissions.

The Supreme Court

of Nebraska did not restrict the petitioners from publishing
that six persons had been, slain in their homes.

It did not

restrict the news media from, investigating any portion of the
crime,, it did not restrict the news media from publishing the
names of the victims, their age, or their six, that Erwin • ~
Charles Simants had been arrested.
QUESTION:

What was the purpose of the newspapers in-

vestigating if they can't, publish?
MR. MOSHER;

Oh, they could publish immediately, of

course, Your Honor, under the terms of this particular restrict­
ing order, just as soon as the jury was empaneled.
QUESTION:

So they would investigate and then wait

around until that time?
MR. MOSHER:
QUESTION:

Certainly.
What is the difference between everybody

else going out and talking about what happened in the prelimin­
ary hearing except the press?

53

MR. MOSHER:

I think it is probably one of degree.

I think it is one of degree.

The newspapers in this Nation

really do enjoy a. tremendous sense of credibility.
QUESTION:

Well, then, it wasn't a public hearing,

was it?
MR. MOSHER:
QUESTION s
MR. MOSHER:
QUESTION;

What's that?
what?
What wasn’t a public hearing?
The preliminary hearing, it couldn't be

pxifclic if it couldn’t be published.
t

MR. MOSHER;

But there is no requirement under the

Constitution that a preliminary hearing be a public hearing.
QUESTION:
MR. MOSHER:

But it is —
The Sixth Amendment, only goes to a public

trial.
QUESTION:

I thought you said it was the lav; of

Nebraska.
MR. MOSHER:
QUESTION:

The law of Nebraska
Well, at any rate, it was a public hearing

here, wasn't it’, or not?
MR. MOSHER:

It was public except for the press?

Well, even the press, the way the case

was developed, was entitled to attend.
QUESTION:

They could hear it but they couldn’t

publish it.
MR. MOSHER:

That’s correct.

54
QUESTION:

Well, 1 don't know how any newspaper can

exist if all it does is hear.
MR. MOSHER:

But, Your Honor, it was not a total

restriction, it was merely a restriction until the jury was
empaneled and placed in the box.

At that stage of the game,

the press was free to let it all hang out.

There was nothing

to restrict them after the jury was in the box.

It was simply

an attempt, a very sincere attempt to balance the First Amend­
ment and Sixth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Mr. Mosher, your theory of why this is a

narrow order then goes to the fact that it was a limited period
of time, rather than the scope of the prohibition?
MR. MOSHER:

That is one thing.

The other thing I

think why it is very narrow is what, they restricted the publi­
cation on.
QUESTION:

Well, what about that third clause that I

asked you about before, isn’t that rather broad?
MR. MOSHER:

No, I don't believe so at all.

I think

all the court was really saying here? is that, one, you cannot
publish before this matter goes to — before the jury is
empaneled — one, admissions against interest or confessions,
and, two, you cannot publish the fact that the man has had
prior criminal conduct.
QUESTION:

This is all the —

How about information tending to prove

guilt, isn't that part of the order?

55

MR. MOSHER s
QUESTION:

Freeisely.
And isn’t that the thing the newspaper

people would probably most like to publish if they have their
cwn reporters out digging around for facts?
MR. MOSHER:

I don’t think so, Your Honor, because

the second one,- for example, let the media publish anything
that -QUESTION:

Would you think this order would have been

appropriate in the Watergate background, would it have been a
narrow order?
MR. MOSHER:

I don’t know the scope of your question,

because Watergate —■
QUESTION:

Any information tending to prove guilt of

any of the crimes under discussion.
MR. MOSHER:

Well, of course, Watergate involved a

tremendous amount of investigation by the media before the
government acted.

In fact, probably Watergate is the media's

finest hour, it certainly is one of its finest hours, because
here is some investigation that went on by the media before the
government acted to set the criminal process in action.
was not the case here.

This

The government had set it in action.

The government had arrested a person —*
QUESTION:

Well, I am really just directing my atten­

tion —- directing your attention to the scope of the order, the
prohibition of information tending to prove guilt.

Do you

56

think that is a narrow order?
HR„ MOSHER:

That is a narrow order.

QUESTIONS

Are the terms of the order tending to

prove guilt of the accused or just tending to prove guilt,
period?
MR. MOSHER:

The terms of the order prohibit the

media from publishing before the jury is empaneled, from pub­
lishing the fact that this man had confessed.

It also pro­

hibited the media from publishing such other matters excepting
those statements that they might get from the accused.

Nov?, if

the accused was willing to talk to the media, they were per­
fectly free to publish it.
QUESTION:

Well, what if an investigative reporter,

after this order was entered but before Simants' trial, came
upon some leads that led him to think that X rather than
Simants was guilty, would he have been free to publish that?
MR. MOSHER:
QUESTION:

Oh, I think he probably could, certainly.
Didn't the order contain words such as

”seriously implicating"?
MR. MOSHER:

It did, which of course v/ould go to the

prior criminal conduct of the accused.
QUESTION:

That to me assumes a little more narrower

than Mr. Justice Stevens’ description of ”tending to prove
guilt."
MR. MOSHER:

Yes, I think so.

57
QUESTION:

Yes, and it is also limited to the ac­

cused, as Mr. Justice Relinquish points out, the information
strongly implicative of the accused as the perpetrator of the
slayings, so (a)

it has to he strong, and <fc>)

it has to relate

to the particular accused.
MR. MOSHER:
QUESTION:

Yes.
And that is what narrows it, I guess.

MR. MOSHER:

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Larson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MILTON R. LARSON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT STATE OF NEBRASKA
MR. LARSON:
please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors, may it

My name is Milt Larson, and 1 am the

prosecutor in this action, here representing the State of

Nebraska.
I believe that insofar as the factual background, Mr.
Mosher has done a very good job in setting forth the situation.
The one thing that he did not mention in terms of whether the
state may have overreacted to some publicity, I was called to
Sutherland on the evening of October 18th, assisted in the
criminal investigation, the bodies were in the house from
approximately 10 o9clock, when I got there, until 4:30 the next
morning, everything left just as it was for the purpose of get­
ting the criminal investigation underway and completed, and
before the bodies were removed, there was an NBC helicopter

58

frons Denverj. that had arrived.

There were news media repre­

sentatives from the wire services, AP, UPI, Omaha World-Herald,
all of the local radio stations, television.

It was very

apparent very early that 1 was going to be faced with a good
deal of publicity.
In this regard, I would like to narrow the issues
here a little bit.

We have — I think that we need to say that

we are talking here only about the very exceptional case in the
criminal arena., the sensational case, the highly publicized
case.

However, we are also talking therefore about the major

cases., the ones that the public are presumably going to be the
most interested in.
Certainly this case, involving the mass murder of six
people, involving sexual assaults on children and an elderly
woman after — both before and after death, must fall within
the realm of an exceptional case.

You have to couple that,

unlike the Watergate situations that happened in a metropolitan
area, where everyone is not terribly concerned about it, here
we have a situation in a town of 800 where virtually everyone
knows everyone, the people in the community knew both the
accused and all of the victims, they were very vitally inter­
ested in it, they were going to learn all that they could, and
rightfully so, they would want to learn all that, they could,
but that adds to the prosecution’s burden of protecting the
individual’s right to a fair trial.

I don’t mean to sound as

53
c. defense attorney, but as an officer of the court I felt that
it was the burden of the prosecution as well, and I think that
is clearly indicated in Sheppard, to take reasonable steps
that I thought were necessary to protect the individual’s
right to a fair trial.
I do also wish tc reemphasize the fact that I did not
at any time state that the defendant had made a statement, and
I. am very happy to report, that it would, have been highly em­
barrassing had 1 done that.

I was misquoted on that.

Then with regard to the pervasiveness of the County
Court5s order, he simply said you shall not report what happens
at the preliminary hearing, period, except as in compliance
with the bar press guidelines.

You have to take that into ac­

count in terms of the circumstances there.
Nebraska has «. statute requiring that if a man is
held without bond, that he shall be entitled to a preliminary
hearing within four days,

That isn’t very much time.

By the

time we got even organized ■— I have a four-man staff — by
the time I even got organized to consider the procedural prob­
lems of due process and fair trial under the Sixth Amendment,
it was Monday.

I had to have the preliminary hearing Tuesday.

And so I asked — I simply put a motion on and said, "Your
Honor, I request that the Court enter whatever order it deems
necessary to protect this individual’s right to a fair trial."
And the judge looked at it and he said, "My, gosh, I see the

so
problem."

In the meantime I have rceived calls from the

Chicago Tribune, the L.A. Sun-Times, tha London Sunday Times,
KBC, ABC, everyone, and I was very much appalled at what was
going to transpire.
So tha judge said obviously this needs to be consid­
ered , obviously I had not much time, "Call all of the media
that are here and that are represented, ask them to come to
the Court, this evening and we are going to talk this over. ”
And we came in and he ultimately decided that he wasn’t going
to be able to make any extensive study of the law in the area,
and he said, "You are going to be able to get a review from the
District Court, and I am just going to shut it down and you can
get your review there."
The following morning we had our preliminary hearing.
The following evening we had a hearing as to the — we had a
review of the County Court's order, and the District Judge also
said, "The order is over-broad, but I don’t know how over-broad
it isT because I am not right up to date on everything with
regard to free press and fair trial, so I want to postpone this
matter until October 2?th ~ that was four days -- request that
counsel give me some guidelines, give me their thoughts as to
what ought to go into the order, and if there ought not to be
an order, what the bases for that is," and on October 27th he
modified the order, which was five days after the original
order had been entered, and I think, under the circumstances,

61

he got it on a Wednesday, gave Thursday and Friday for the
people involved to get their information together as to what
they wanted to put before the judge, and then on October 27th
he had another hearing at which he entered his order and heard
arguments as to its validity and what ought to be in it and
what not to be in it, and decided to go with the bar press
guidelines»

And Justice Blackmun I think correctly stated that

they are over-broad because they are not specific enough in
all areas.

If you are going to be charged with contempt, you

certainly ought to know what you are being charged with, and I
couldn’t agree more.

That is absolutely correct.

So, it was limited to confessions, confessions made
to law enforcement people, confessions made to others, and to
those facts strongly implicative of this defendant.

Now, in

addressing Justice Stevens8 questions, that would on its face
appear to be rather pervasive, but I would submit that it is
not when applied to the facts of the case itself.
Basically, at the time of the preliminary hearing,
all we had was the confession of the defendant.

All of the

physical evidence that was to later corroborate the confession,
the fibers that were found from his coat that were found on
the body of the defendants, efc cetera, this was all being
packaged and being sent to the FBI Laboratory in Washington,
here in Washington, D. C.
We had nothing at the time of the preliminary hearing

62

to secure a probable cause for the bind-over of this defendant
except — nothing inculpatory except his confession, which is
sufficient for establishing probable cause to bind him over.
But. with regard to the questions that are involved here, the
— I think what comes into conflict are the two rules of law,
one, that that which transpires in the open court room may be
published with impunity, and, two, that where there is a reasonable likelihood of prejudical news coverage, that the judge
shall take those steps that are required to protect the right
to a fair trial.
Clearly, none of the cases have indicated that there
is any indication toward prior restraint that that is at all
desirable.

But I would submit that in exceptional cases, where

locale and circumstance combined are such that pervasive pub­
licity, extensive publicity and prejudicial publicity would
create a clear and present danger to the empaneling of a fair
and impartial jury, that that must necessarily — that the
judge must necessarily have the authority to enter any appro­
priate order —
QUESTION:

Doesn't that cut another way — in a

place with 800 people, were the whole 800 people talking about
anything else but the —
MR. LARSON:

No, Your Honor.

I presume what you -are

getting to now is the rumor and innuendo that goes in the
absence of reporting, is that correct?

63

QUESTION:
MR. LARSON:

Well# you can't stop that.
No.

And my answer to that

- and it is

only a feeling# but I think that it is correct — that that
I

which Mrs. Jones tells me, I am willing to be more easily con­
vinced to put aside than if 1 have read in the papers in the
headlines evidence established at a preliminary hearing shows
that a confession was made.

1 think that once it is given the

sanction of the judicial proceeding# once it is given the
sanction of the written word in the paper# recorded under
judicial proceedings# that it is much more devastating to the
rights of the criminal defendant for a fair trial.
QUESTION:
MR. LARSON:

In a small town of 800?
Yes# Your Honor.

First of all# with re­

gard to that# as a practical matter# anyone who was from
Sutherland was removed i'ot. cause without opposition by the
prosecution# because of that very
QUESTION:

Have you ever participated in the game of

telling your friend on your right and it goes all around the
house until it gets back to you?
MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

Yes# Your Honor.
Well# in a town of 300# I don’t know how

you are going to stop that.
MR. LARSON:

We can't stop it# Your Honor# but I do

think that it is not going to be as prejudicial a© what comes
out in the paper that the judicial proceedings have indicated

/

64

that a confession was made.
In, regard to the confession itself, I would submit to
the Court that a confession in an exceptional case such as we
have before us uniquely lends itself to a restriction in the
pretrial proceeding.

I think it is also important to remember

that we are talking about pretrial here.

I can’t conceive of

any basis during the trial of precluding publicity, because
obviously the jury can be sequestered at that time, they don’t
need to have access to that information.

But we are talking

about pretrial and we don't know who the prospective jurors are
going to be.

We do know, though, what type of information they

are going to have at their disposal.
I would submit, Your Honors, that in light of the
four-day requirement, in light of the fact that we of necessity
had to introduce the confession at the preliminary hearing in
order to get a. bind-over.

It can hardly be said, as the

petitioners would have you believe, that we volunteered that
information for dissemination to the public.

As a matter ©f

prosecution, as a matter of getting ray job done, 1 had no
alternative but to introduce that confession*
QUESTIONS

So when you *—

Before a confession is introduced at a

preliminary hearing, is there any test of its voluntariness/
MR. LARSONs

Ho, Your Honor, that was the next point

that I was going to raise.

Due process before the admission of

a confession into the trial portion requires a due process

65

hearing outside the presence of the jury as to the relation\

ship of voluntariness.

That was held.

But X would submit to

you that that would be of very little moment iis the conJ

fession had already been published and the jurors already
have knowledge of it, because X would submit that what would
go through the mind of the juror, if they went through the
trial and no confession was introduced, was not that there
must not have been a confession but, rather, that, well, the
prosecutor didn't introduce the confession but I know it was
made.

And X think that that type of prejudice simply cannot

be overcome.
And X think that the issue, the basic issue here is
that in the exceptional case who shall govern, who shall have
ultimate authority to protect the due process requirements with
relationship to a fair trial* shall, it be the courts, shall it
be the judiciary, or shall it be the editor?

I would submit

that; before public dissemination of information relative to
the existence of the confession can be or should be dissemin­
ated, that the question of voluntariness should first be deter­
mined in the first instance by the judiciary and not by
editorial comment.

And again I am talking about exceptional

cases, highly publicized cases.

I am talking about this case,

gentlemen, where in a small rural community we had. a mass
murder of the coops that was unprecedented in Nebraska since
the Starkweather case in 1957.

66
It would seem to me that if ever there was a situa­
tion where there could be a limited prior restraint -- and
again we must say limited, I feel that, as 1 think is clearly
J

the law, it ca:a be no more pervasive than is absolutely neces­
sary to insure the judicial process and the orderly administra­
tion of justice, and that is really what we are talking about,
is the ultimate

power of the courts to control their own

processes to insure that due process of the law is met.

I

think that should talk about the Estes case, the Rideau case,
the Sheppard case, which indicate that due process — that
actual prejudice need not. be shown where due process demands
a reversal because of the prejudicial publicity.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you, Ms.-. Larson.

Mr. Frettyman, you have I think eight minutes left.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF 1. BARRETT PRETTYMAN, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL
MR. PRETTYMAN:

I don’t think I will take it all,

Your Honor.
I just, want to say that I would foe making my argu­
ment even if prior restraints worked.

They don’t work, at least:

in the sense of guaranteeing a fair trial or bsnefitting the
public.

They result, as you have just pointed out, Mr. Justice

Marshall, in rumor and gossip and speculation that is often
far more dangerous to a defendant than factual reporting in a
newspaper.

They result in the cover-up of occasional

s?
corruption and abuse of power and of pressures that elected
judges are sometimes put under.
QUEST I OKI s

They —

Do you have to go that far*, Mr. Pretfcyman?

If the press are permitted to be present and have access to the
entire record, you have a rather hard time covering it up.
MR. PRETTYMANs
QUESTIONS

Yes, but —

It would be delayed reporting, but you

couldn’t cover it up, could yon?
MR. PRETTY:

The problem, of course, is what is

actually going on, and that is that you are having a combina­
tion of closed hearings and prior restraints, and what we are
having more and more now, what is developing at an accelerated
rate is the fact that the press is being cut off entirely.
Now, you sort of assume that the publication of a
confession must be a bad thing, it is going to harm the de­
fendant.

In fact, people confess to things all the time that

they didn’t do, and the publication of confessions can result
in freeing people.

There was an incident the other day in

Britain where a young man was charged with a crime and he got
on television and said "I didn't do it," and the youngster who
had been at the scene saw it and said, "That man was not there,51
and he told his father and they got the police and the fellow
got off.

Now, the same thing would have happened if he had

actually confessed on television, if he said "I did do it,” and
that young boy said, "I was there and hs didn’t do it at all.

68
That could have gotten that man off.
You can't just assume that
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that our decision in

the Rideau case was erroneous?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

No, but I would point out, Your

Honor, that in that case you are talking about the effect at
trial, and that you reversed, you didn't enter a prior restraint:»
And I think Rideau is a very good example because you didn't
order that man to go free, you sent him back for a new trial,
and you assumed that, despite those 50,000 people or however
many it was who saw that television program, that somehow, with
the Sheppard help, that man was going to get a fair trial the
next time around.
QUESTION:

Well, the narrow issue there was whether

or not he was constitutionally entitled to a change of venue,
for which he had made a motion.
MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTIONt

That’s true.

Mr. Prattyman, I suppose your position, if

you prevail here, will be to increase the number of closed
hearings.

How, you said a while ago that that is another case

and —
MR, PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

-— you would be arguing against this.

But

is this a privilege for the press to assert or for the defense
to assert?

69

MR. :?KETT7MANs

Well* of course* we would contend —

and the Nebraska Supreme Court, doesn't agree with us — that
the press is entitled to intervene here* that it represents

7

not only its own rights but the public's rights..

One very-

strange aspect of this cs-.se is that the Nebraska Supreme Court

I think what is going to happen if you allow these

things is this:

Defendants* as a matter of course* are going

to ask for a prior restraint both to prevent themselves from
being charged with ineffective assistance of counsel and also
because it is obviously in their client’s interest, not to have
any publicity about this.

So that is going to become the

normal thing.
Then prosecutors, what is their attitude- going to be?

But I thought you were saying that the

State of Nebraska is constitutionally obligated to open up its
preliminary hearing?
MR. PRETTYMANs

Mo, I wasn’t arguing that now.

I might argue in the next case that it was, but that isn't this
case.

In this case.» they chose to have a public hearing and

they nevertheless refused to give us the information that was

MR. PRETTYMAN:

Your Honor, 7. think that if the

Court is really going to attempt to decide in each case whether
a little bit of time is too much or too little, you are really
in trouble.

Let’s say, for example, that on the morning of

an election a Congressman is indicted and confesses and an
unconstitutional order

unconstitutional or not — is entered

immediately after the press, but it stays in effect only until
7:00 o’clock that night, that man is reelected.

or a month is all right.
QUESTION s

Has there ever been such a casse?

MR. PRETTYMAN:

Well, I can only say this, that this

Court has said on several occasions that it is the contempo­
raneous -- In Re Oliver was one, and I think there have been
several others —- has emphasised that it is the contemporaneous
publishing of news, the public's right immediately to news,
because you cannot judge the impact that news is going to have.
In the Joan Little case, for example, the fact that women's
rights were immediately able to generate support for us, was
extremely important.

And in the Schulenkamp case, the immedi-

/

ate putting out of the news resulted in the whole juvenile
system beinghredone, and all of that could have been lost if
there had been a delay.

There is a momentum to these things.
■

There is a momentum to news, and I think Watergate, of course,
is the great example, the fact that news coming out now of
something is of vital importance to the public in a suit.
As soon as you start saying, no, let's just keep it
from them for a little while, you put yourself in very serious
trouble.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you gentlemen.

case is submitted.

case was submitted.]
