OPAL ARGUMENT OP MICHAEL D. DONAHUE, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. DONAHUES

Mr. chief Justice,, and may it please

the Court:
My name is Michael Donahue, I am an Assistant
Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the
United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.

The

case presents a similar question to the case previously
i.rgue:?; it's; somewhat di ffarant, but it broadly presents the
question of whether and to what extent the procedural require­
ment?; of ths Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
extend to the intrastate transfer of State prisoners.
QUESTION;

Intrastate.

MR. DOHAHUEs

Intras ta r.e, Your Honor.

Thi >: action was originally commenced by seventeen
inmates confined to the Massachusetts Correctional Institute
at Norfolk:: MCI Norfolk is a medium security institution.

An amsndad complaint was later filed by six inmates,
who arc the respondents here.

They sought declaratory and

injunctive relief pursuant to Section 1983? sought money

4
damages.' against the Commissioner of Correction, the Superintend
cant, of Norfolk, alleging that hearings that had been held
transferring them from Norfolk to Walpole were unconstitutional
as violative of the Due Process Clause,
The respondents asked the district court to enjoin
any transfer to Walpole and fco any of the other State
institutions, and ordered — it sought an order to the
correction officials to place the inmates in the general
population of Norfolk*
The chronology of the case is briefly as follows?
In November the case was filed and the district judge denied
a temporary restraining order0
On January 10, 1975, following argument, the district
judge granted a preliminary injunction, and ordered that the
department officials submit regulations to deal with the
question of hearings to be applied at MCI Norfolk»

The

regulations were to be .'similar and fco provide the same rights
to inmates who were confined to MCI Walpole*
Tbs district judge stayed part of fie or dir 'pendingappeal.

the full panel of the First Circuit stayed the

remainder of the order- pending full argument on the morits fco
the full bench of the First Circuit.
In June last year the Court of Appeals reached a

decision affirming the district court*

In so doing, they held

that the loss suffered by inmates in transfer from Norfolk to

.5

Walpole was sufficient to constitute a deprivation of liberty
within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendments.
It was a purely weight analysis , it did not reach it.
in the first instance by arguing whether or not there was a
liberty or property interest involved»

It said there was a

cumulative approach, that the loss suffered by the inmates on
the transfer from Norfolk to Walpole was sufficient to invoke
the procedures required by the Fourteenth Amendment*
Judge Levin Campbell of the First Circuit dissented*
Judge Campbell argued that inmates had no recognisable interest
in the Fourteenth Amendment, they had no interest in liberty
or property in remaining in any particular institution,,
Judge Campbell said in his dissent that remaining
in
e

correction institution in Massachusetts was no more than

unilateral expectation, conditioned by no Act of the Stats,
On December 8, 1975, this Court granted certiorari*
In the fall of 1974, the Massachusetts Correctional

Instituta at Norfolk was undergoing a series of significant
disruptive incidents, a .series of fires occurred, beginning
in August 1974 and continued through October*

There were nine

fires that were serious enough to require the assistance of
outside fire departments

from the surrounding communities.

At various points four of the surrounding towns sent fire­
fighters in to engage in putting out the blase*
From'August to October, over $100,000 in damages had

6
occurred within the institution., two inmate living units were
burned down? there was a partial loss of the. laundry at the
institutione
At some point in October, the record —
QUESTIONS

I’m having some trouble following you?

you might speak just a little more slowly,
MR. DONAHUEs

Okay .

At some point in October 1974,

the Superintendent of Norfolk, Mr, Larry Meachum, was informed
by certain inmates at the institution that certain other
inmates, among whom were the respondents here, were engaged
in the disruptive incidents at the institution»
Meachum began to take action to cause them to be
removed from the general population.

On the 16th of October

h® removed the first of the respondents.
By the 24th of October, all of the other respondents
were removed from the general population.

By October 31st,

there were no further fires in the institution.
By October 25th, each of the inmates had received a
notice of a s'discipline hearing", notice of a discipline charge,
which stated in general terms that the Superintendant of the
institution had received information through a reliable source
that they were engaged in certain general conduct.

In seme

of the respondents * cases, it was that they had engaged in
setting the fires or participating in the fires»

In other

cases, it was alleged that they were trafficking in narcotics?

7
and in other cases it was alleged that -they had possession of
the ammunition ox' weapons within the institution»
The local District Attorney was informed at the same
time , and the matter was referred to his office for investiga»’
tion, because — specifically because of the Massachusetts
correctional procedures which were in force at that time, no
disciplinary hearing was held, because the regulations barred
holding a disciplinary hearing or barred imposing sanctions
as a result of disciplinary punishment when the matter had
been referred to the local District Attorney»
Those regulations are no longer in effect»
Ey early November, each of the respondents received
notices of "classification” hearings.

The classification

hearings notified them in general terms of the same informant
information that had been contained in the disciplinary
notices, and it specifically informed the inmates that -they
•-■•duId possibly be subjected to transfers to higher custody
status as a result of the classification hearings which were
to be scheduled»
Classification in Massachusetts determines custody
level, it does not adjudicate the specific instances of
misconduct,

A Classification Board may review instances of

misconduct or allegations of misconduct only insofar as they
relate to the custody level at the institution»

It doss not

determine guilt or innocence on specific disciplinary charges»

8

Classification hearings were scheduled and held for
each one of the respondents through early November 1975 —
excuse me* 1974.
At the hearings each inmate was represented by
counsel or represented by a law student.

Each inmate was read

a prepared statement by the Board as to the purpose of the
hearing* the powers of the Classification Board* the possibility
that transfer could result.
I might add
were not held

interject at this point — the hearings

on the same day* they were held over a one-week

period during — or approximately a one-week period during
November.
Following the statement made by the Classification
Board to the inmate* the. inmate and counsel were asked to leave
the room for the express purpose of allowing the Superintendent,
to como in and testify as to the informant information that he
possessed.
The Superintendent came in the room* — stated times
not reflected by the record; the* record does reflect* however*
and the. reports of the classification notices* beginning at
page 68 of the Appendix* that the Board examined Meachum as
to the sources of his information.

They probed his informa­

tion® to tea credibility of the informants and the reliability
of the information.
Thera are specific findings in the classification

9
reporto that the

Classification Board found toe information

to be reliable..
In on© instance# one of to© respondents was
recommended by the Classification Board not to be transferred»
And then, on a review by the Commissioner of Correct# who had
the ultimate responsibility in Massachusetts# the Commissioner
of Correction overruled that and ordered that he be transferred»
But I'm moving ahead of the game at this point»
Following Meachum’s testimony# h© was excused# the
inmats was called back into to© room# they were told that
Meachum again had presented informant information.

In no

instance does it appear that th© Board summarized the informa­
tion for toe inmate»
The position that was presented to the Court of
Appeals and not to the district court# in an affidavit, by
Meachum# was that Meachum's judgment was that it would
compromise the safety and security of the informant»
There is other evidence in the record, in the
classification reports, that the Classification Board felt
toat to reveal any more of the information from Meachum to
iho inmatet than the general charges would have compromised

the safety and security of the informants»
The inmate was allowed to present any testimony he
wished.

He wasn't given a compulsory process»

He was not

allowed to compel toe presence of correction officers.

But he

1G

was allowed to submit documentary evidence*

The record

r&'l'.'Cts that certain of the respondents submitted documentary
evidence from individuals they worked for at the institution*
The record reflects that certain of 'the respondents were
allowed — request and were allowed and did present correction
officers to testify#
The Board heard from the social workers in each
case*, who testified as to the institutional history of the
respondents? they testified as to their criminal history#
And the Boasrd had a full view of what the inmates’ conduct
had been in the institution#
QUESTION:

Mr. Donahue, in reciting this description

of the procedures that wore followed, are w© to take it that
you acknowledge that the Constitution required those pro­
cedures?
MR. DONAHUE:

No, I don't, Your Honor#

No, 1 don't#

I'm going into detail on the facts because I think
they are crucial# and because it's not the —
QUESTION; Well, why are they crucial, if the
Constitution didn't require them?

MR. DONAHUE:

Because of the position of the

Commonweal*ih, the position of my clients has been, throughout,
that hearings may or may not be a good thing in correction
practice.

In this instance hearings were held because my

clients regarded them as a useful tool in correction practice.

11
We do siot, however, think that -they are constitur
tionally required, because we do not think, in this instance,
that there was any State-created interest sufficient to create
a liberty or property interest within the meaning of the
Fourteenth Amendment®
The existence of hearings and the provision for
hearings is not necessarily a question which implicates the
Fourteenth Amendment®

I do not concede that the Fourteenth

Amendment requires that hearings b@ held®
Following the hearings, the Board ©rally announced
its recommendations to counsel and to the inmate®

They

informed them what their recommendations were to be, and
informed them what the circulation would be®

OF vL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL C. DONAIIUE, ESQ, ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - Resumed
MR. DONAHUEs

Mr, Chief Justice* and may it please

the Courts
When the Board’s decision ultimately was made* they
made only recommendations * there was no ultimate decision made
by the Board,

Th© power to transfer in Massachusetts is

vested in the Commissioner of Correction,
At page 6a of the Respondents' brief* the
Massachusetts statute is contained.

There are no standards

implied* it just indicates that the Commissioner may transfer
an inmat© in his discretion.
So what the Board did in this instance was to make
factual-, findings and give recommendations to the Commissioner,
who then proceeded to act.
Because there are no statutes., or because there are
no regulations which give substantive standards to th® transfer
question* it is the -- the Petitioners * position is that
there is no legitimate claim of entitlement for an inmate
to remain in 'the correctional institution, and that any
inms.t©'s desire to remain in that institution is therefore

13
conditioned by no Act of the State,

The desire to remain in

the institution is nothing more than a unilateral expectation..
The Commissioner’s decision is entirely discretion™
ary.

Moreover# it’s important to focus# I think* on the

question as to what this Board did* even if due process is
found to apply.
What this Board did was not adjudicate misconduct.
What tee Board did was only to determine the question as to
the appropriateness of these inmates remaining at Norfolk in
a situation which* in tee Superintendents a judgment was
untenable .
If due process applies in the first instance* we
suggest this is crucial* because they did not determine
misconduct.
reran*

These inmates were not punished* at least they

objectively punished.

The gravity of tie loss that

tee inmates suffered is* in our judgment* no more
significant than tee loss suffered by the teacher in Board
of_ R a gents v8_._jRote»

His subjective perception may have been

lost# but there was nothing # not an objective standard which
suggest that the Court could base the decision# saying
that, there was a constitutional right.
These inmates were not committed to segregation at
Walpole# they suffered no loss of goodtime# they were not
branded as trouble-makers# as the Court of Appeals found.
They were —*■ they did have notations entered in an institu™

14
taonal record, but that was the only thing.
To derive injury from the mere entry of the
notation is a very speculative type of approach of due process,
and we think that this Court's opinion, at least recently,
?
in Paul vs, Davis, recognized that the stigma, unless there is
an independent liberty or property interest, is not
cognizable.
The quarrel that we have with the First Circuit's
opinion exists because the Court of Appeals' decision would
require us to give information which, in our judgment, would
have revealed the identify of the informants.

That’s the

crux of the matter before the Court on the question of whether
the process was adequate; if, indeed, process is found,
A summary of the evidences could have revealed the
names and the identity of informants, and it was the only
procedure, in fact, that was abbreviated by my clients,

We

argued to the Courts of Appeals that the procedures that, were
followed in the hearings were consistent with this Court's
interpretation in Wolff, that when institutional security was
implicated, there war© certain matters that might be. rralufr d
from information given to the inmates.
The Court of Appeals rejected that idea, and they
said that it was a — that, quite frankly, th® language that
this Court had used was cryptic.
We didn't find anything cryptic about it.

The

15
language in Wolff# we thought.;, gave the department 'the right
to exclude summaries of evidence when, in their judgment, it
would have compromised the safety and security of the
informants„
The record, at least as to the finding of the
Classification Board, is clear on that question.

There was

no question in the mind of the Superintendent, there appears
to have bmm no question in the minds of the Classification
Committee that to give the inmates a summary of the evidence
would have compromised their safety.
If due process is to serve in this instance two
purposes, it may very well have said "to accurately ascertain
facts*5,

We contend this was done.

There was no procedure

that this Board followed which would compromise the accurate
identification of facts.
The procedures that the Board followed, insofar as
the.

was to. accurately ascertain facts, was adequate.
i.oio:;

alleging the imnato to testify, to have an input

in its decision, we believe that was also adequate*

There is

v

,o dealt that the inmates in these cases, because

they were

represented by counsel, because they were allowed to call
witnesses, because they were allowed to present documentary
rjidance, had anything but a full input into the factual
considerations by the Board.
This may not necessarily have been the case if we

16

were adjudicating a specific instance of punishmentt but we
were not adjudicating specific instances of punishment.

Th©

Board was not to dotsmine whether or not these individuals
were involved in setting the fires.

The only question before

the Board was the propriety of these inmates , whom the
Superintendent believed to have bean involved -- the propriety
of these inmates remaining at the institution in Norfolk,
This case, we suggest, really presents the question
of where the balance ought to be struck in prison situations.
A balance that was noted in Wolff vs. McDonnell between -fee
need for institutional security and the right to protect
individuals.
In this instance we believe what Judge Campbell, in
his dissenting opinion, that the State's interest is paramount,
the State's interest is so important in instances of this
nature that the Court should properly strike the balance in
our favor.
We're not trying to limit the right to hearing.
In Massachusetts, hearings are held for virtually every
conceivable administrative purpose.

Prior to this Court's

opinion in Wolff vs, McDonnell, the record reflects that
Mass••zchusatfcs had promulgated disciplinary procedures, which
grantee procedures in excess of what this Court said were
constitutionally mandated in Wolff vs. McDonnell.
Classification regulations, in its full sense, were

17
issued later*

Evary procedure dealing with transfer, every

procedure dealing with discipline is covered under Massachusetts
regulations,,

There are no standards.

We don't think that they

create an entitlement by that, by the existence of the
regulations»
But the procedures in Massachusetts, the Massachusetts
prison system, were followed to allow a hearing in virtually
every conceivable limitation.
So that's not a mandated question before the Court.
The question is not an effort on the part of the government to
limit the right of hearings and to take unilateral and
arbitrary action, that's simply not presented by the case.
QUESTION;

But I understood from your answer to an

earlier question of mine that so far as the United States
Constitution goes, Massachusetts could have taken unilateral
and what you call arbitrary action.
MR. DONAHUE;

To be consistent with the issue, Your

Honor, that’s true.
But, as 1 mentioned earlier- our judgment is that
what is mandated by good correctional practice and what ;;is
mandated by sound administrative judgments aren't necessarily
required by the Constitution.
We may. by virtue of ~~
QUESTION; And it's only 'the latter, of course, that's
of any concern of ours

18

MRo DONAHUEs

Absolutely, Your Honor0

Yes»

Our position is that while a hearing may be necessary
may be wise in specific instances, it.as not necessarily
mandated in this case»
If we create a system of regulations, which place
substantive standards on the conduct of the individuals, w®
may create an entitlement»

But this record does not reflect

that any entitlement was created»
This record only reflects that inmates were trans­
ferred from one institution to another, and suffered some
deprivation as a result of that»

We do not think that that,

is sufficient to invoke the procedural requirements of due
process»
If it is entitlement, if it .is Board of Regents vs» QUESTIONS

In other words, if a regulation said

that no inmate shall be transferred from a medium security
institution to a maximum security institution, unless he is
guilty of some kind of misconduct in the former institution,
than you think he would have an entitlement to stay in
mediumsecurity institution,
MRo DONAHUEs

upon a finding that he was guilty of misconduct, and such a
finding could be made only after according him some sort of a

MRo DONAHUE;
QUESTION;

Absolutely.
A determination.

MR. DONAHUE:

Yes.

QUESTION; And you say there is no substantive
regulation of any kind here.
MR. DONAHUE;
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, there isn't.

In your view, does that right spring

from the Constitution or from the regulation?
MR. DONAHUE; Wa believeit springs from the regulation,
Your Honor? it’s an entitlement, .it’s a State-created
interest.
Whether it is a liberty type interest, such as was
involved in the Nebraska procedures in Wolff, the statutory
creation cf goodtisne, or whether it’s the example that Mr.
Justice Stewart pointed out as to transferring only for mis­
conduct, then that is a different question that — and w©
believe that the State has created the right rather than
something that's inherent in the Fourteenth Amendment.
QUESTION;
stand your position.

Mr. Donahue, I want to be aura I under­
Assume that within a given institution

there’s an inmate in the general population, to start with,
there area no regulations applicable, just the day-to-day
administration by the Warden, and he is transferred fro» the
general population to solitary confinement for a six-month
period.

Does he have a liberty interest that's been affected?

20

MR. DONAHUEi

X don't believe it's inherent in toe

Constitution, Your Honor.

If regulations exist, so as to

premise the —
QUESTION:

I'm assuming no regulations, —

MR. DONAHUE;
QUESTION:

No regulations.

— just a, change in status from the

general population in a medium security institution to
solitary confinement for six months, living cn bread and
water during the entire six months®
But it's not cruel and unusual? I don’t want to
posit a case where you have an Eighth Amendment issue.
Would you say he had any liberty interests of which
he’d been deprived?
MR. DONAHUE:

No, Your Honor.

No, Your Honor.

I think there is no independent liberty interest springing
from the Fourteenth Amendment in that type of situation.
It may well implicate, as you say, the Eighth Amendment.
QUESTION:

You would agree toat constitutionally

that's the same case as the transfer from a medium security
institution to a separate facility which has that kind of
conditions in it?
MR. DONAHUE *
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes.

MR. DONAHUE:

Yes, Your Honor,

The question of what the Fourteenth Amendment

of

21
what we believe; the Fourteenth Amendment does in this instance
is — well, excuse me? let ms back up on that.
We believe that the Fourteenth Amendment -- there
are very limited and inherent rights in the Fourteenth
Amendment,

What exists, we believe, from this Court®s decision

in Board of Regents vs, Roth, from Perry vs, Sinderman, from
Wolff vs, McDonnell, and Goss vs, Lopez, is a recognition that
certain due process rights are created and are conditioned by
the State,

But there are other due process rights which are

inherent in the Constitution,
Thera are other rights that are inherent in the
Constitution, such as the inmate's right in Procunier vs,
Martinas, which is something that was inherent, rather than
springing from the State's created interest.
The thrust of our position is that due process must
have an objective reference point.

It must contain soma

limiting princip1@.
Due process, in order to be understood and applied
consistently, must mean more than what a particular district
judge says it means at any particular moment®

It must have

a point of reference to which all individuals, all citizens,
and all governmental agencies can say it applies.
It can't exist by virtue of a weight interest, or
a weight analysis, where on© single judge will say that because
of this cumulation of deprivations, we believe that due process.

22
has to apply6

We think such an approach is inconsistent with

this Court5s analysis in Board of Regents vs® Roth. it’s
inconsistent with the Court’s analysis in Wolff vs® McDonnell,
We strongly believe that that's what the Court of
Appeals did here®

They cumulated the deprivations that the

inmate was to suffer upon transfer# and they said# therefore,
due process applies»
We think that's an improper approach to defining
whether a liberty or property interest exists? and for that
basis wesr© asking that the Court of Appeals be reversed»
QUESTIONS

Now# suppose two inmates are charged with

exactly -the same violation# and one of them gets a hearing
and is sent to solitary? the other one doesn't get a hearing
and is transferred to a maximum security institution»
MR» DONAHUE:

Well# there are -two —

QUESTION: And the reason they give to them is that
*you broke a rule'3»

And he asks# "Are you punishing me?"

And they say# "Webl# yes# I guess so,”
MR» DONAHUE:
Your Honor»

It can’t, happen in Massachusetts#

The hypothetical you raise can’t tappers®

Disciplinary boards in Massachusetts can’t transfer®
Disciplinary boards can only recommend transfer to Classifica­
tion Boards®
QUESTION:

Well# a disciplinary board — there

wasn’t any disciplinary board involved in ray example? they

23

just transferred him,
MR, DONAHUE: And neither did the Board adjudicate
the specific question of misconduct# they only determined
whether or not the inmate could appropriately remain at the
institution.
There's never been an adjudication of this in this
case# of whether those inmates did what the informants said
they wsre to do.
In my clients' judgment# that was not a crucial
question»

The crucial and the most overriding question from

the State's point of view was to remove -these people from
the general population.
QUESTION;

And it's in his file -that he takes along

with him to the other institution that said# "This fellow is
being transferred, because he» burns things up»”

That wouldn't

make any difference to you?
MR. DONAHUE:

And you would say he still isn’t, entitled

No, Your Honor# I think that —

Even though his colleague# who was sent

to solitary # was entitled to a hearing,
MR, DONAHUE:

For breaking a rule.

Yes# I think there is # I think they are independent
questions. Your Honor.

I think that what is involved is an

adjudication of misconduct in one instance# for which the
inmate is punished# objectively punished:

segregation? loss

of goodtime.
In the other instance# if the department chooses not
to punish him but 3:ather to remove him from the' source of
his difficulty# I think it’s a different question.
With the Court’s permission# I’ll reserve the rest
of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Jones.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEITK A. JONES# ESQ,#
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. JONES:

Mr, Chief Justice# and may it please

the Court:
I will address only the question of whether the
transfer of a prisoner to a prison with a higher security
classification implicates the procedural protections of due

25
process.
It is the position of the United States that such a
trasnfer does not implicat® due process»

By its tarns , the Due Process Clause applies only
where governmental action threatens to deprive an individual
of life, liberty, or property»
In a case such as this, therefore, analysis
necessarily begins with an inquiry into whether the substantivis
interest at stake, the substantiva interest underlying the
claim, are subsumed under either liberty or property.
As ‘Shis Court stated in Board of Regents v» Roth,
wTo determine whether due process requirements apply in the
first place, we must look not to the 'weight* but to the
nature of the interest at stake.“
The Court of Appeals bypassed this necessary inquiry
into the nature of the affected interest, and formulated the
issue solely in terms of the weight of those interests* by
asking whether the detriment worked by the challenged transfer
was serious enough to trigger the application of the due
process.
The detriment alone, without more, is not sufficient
to implicate due process.

That much this Court settled in

Roth.

QUESTION: Well, it settled it in Paul v» Davis,
resettled it, didn't it?

26
MR. JONES;

Yes? that’s righto

reputation in Paul v° Davis

The .interest and

or the interest and continued

employment in Roth? was not sufficient to implicate due
process ? because those affected interests were neither liberty
nor property.
QUESTIONS

No matter how grievous the damage —

MR. JONES s
QUESTIONS

Yes.
— it has? as you say? to b© liberty or

property or life.
MR. JONES;

That’s correct? Mr. Justice Stewart.

We believe that it is important that the Roth
analysis be adhered to.

The requirement that a liberty or a

property interest be affected? a requirement -that is imposed
by the Constitution itself? is an appropriate and wise
limitation on the applicability of due process.
A contrary rule would threaten to hamstring the
government? hamstring the essential operations of the
government? by requiring a hearing or other due process
procedure at virtually every turn.
With regard to the governments of prisons? for
exaas?le ? the denial of a furlough? the termination of an
educational program? change in work assignment might be
dsemed by some court to work a sufficient detriment to
implicate due process? and require a hearing.
QUESTION;

What about transfer to solitary confine'»

27

ment?
MR, JONES:

Transfer to solitary confinement raises

a slightly different question,

As we note, I think, in Foot­

note 15 at page 22 of our brief, there may be an issue of
whether the conditions of solitary confinement are so different
from those of other confinements as to possibly implicate a
constitutional libe rty„
We would say that, in answer to your question, there
would be no liberty interest of nonconstitutional origin

if

the State could put a man in solitary confinement without a
finding of misconduct.
But whether there’s an interest of constitutional
origin in that special circumstances is an issue that need not
be reached in this case,
QUESTION:

That’s factual — really it’s largely

or partly factual, isn't it?
liberty or property,

Whether or not. something is

I suppose if you

if the Warden took

somebody in the general prison population and put him in leg
irons or a straitjackat, or handcuffs, that would be a
deprivation of his liberty as a matter of fact, wouldn’t it?
Even though he had originally been inside the prison in th©
gen#ral population„
MRo JONES:

Well, our answer to that would be that

if there were no articulated standards in the rules governing
.his confinement, there would be no nonconstitutional origin

23
for a liberty interest# land the question would be whether
there's a constitutional liberty involved»

And that might# in

soma cases# be a factual question»
We don't think it's a factual question here.
QUESTION5

Well; a constitutional origin

MR. JONES;

And the reason for that *—

QUESTION;
At least generally»

—■■ has a different reason# doesn't it?
I mean that's a liberty or freedom that

is protected by the Constitution itself# i.e.# the liberty
of speech or the liberty of the free exercise of religion»
•That's one kind of a liberty»
But where — that’s not indicated in this case#
that sort of constitutional liberty isn't indicated here at
all# it's a matter of' factual liberty? isn't it?

Freedom»

MR. JONESi

Well# I don’t know ~

QUESTION:

Not constitutionally protected, but

whether in fact the parson was deprived of his freedom of
movement? not his constitutional freedom.
MR. JONES;

Well# if it's not a constitutional

basis# I'm not sure what basis it is.

I mean# I think

I

think that there are two arguments that —
QUESTION;

Nobody has a constitutional right to be

out of jail# he has a constitutional right to be —
\

MR. JONES;
QUESTION:

Wall# he has a constitutional right —
— released from jail only after he's

29
been accorded due procsss of law,
MR, JONES:

And that is a different way of phrasing

it, hut I don’t see the difference in substance»
QUESTION:

Well, there's quit® a difference.

Don't

you sso the difference between the liberty that's embodied
in the liberty in tne First Amendment, on the one hand, which
is a constitutionally protected liberty', from the factual
liberty of whether somebody has got his arms free or whether
he's in handcuffs?

Aren't they two quite different concepts?

MR, JOJES: Well, they're differant in this sense:
the First Amendment affirmatively grants certain liberties.
The Fourteenth Amendment grants you a right not to be deprived
of liberty without due process.
But I would not say that what liberty is is a
factual question? my analysis would be that it's —
QUESTION:

Well, it's a factual matter whether a

person is free to walk the streets or in prison, isn't it?
MR, JONES:
QUESTION:
MR, JONES:

There's no doubt about that,
And that's a matter of fact,
That's true.

Our argument — or let me rephrase it.
As I understand the Respondents5 argument about
constitutional liberty, they say it is inherent in the concept
of liberty, or physical freedom from the control of the State
is at the heart of constitutional liberty.

30

QUESTION: Well, but you lost a good deal of that
when you wore committed to a correctional institution, haven't
you?
MR» JONES;

That's correct, Mr» Chief Justice®

I was just setting up a syllogism so -that I could
knock it. down®
QUESTION:

The point is that you lost part of it,

but not all of it? isn't that it?
MR. JONES;
QUESTION;

Well, ~
Isn’t there some remaining concept of

liberty with the inmate?
MR. JONES;

Once a prisoner, or one® a man has been

convicted and sentenced, he is lawfully subject to whatever
conditions of confinement that may be fairly said to be
inherent, within that sentence.

An imprisonment within a

mod «sum security institution is plainly within the range
anticipated by his senssnes»
Well, that's not —
QUESTION;
MR. JONES:

Even if solitary is not?
Even if solitary is not? that is

correct.
Indeed, counsel for the State informs me -that the
respondents in 'this very case were actually sentenced to a
maximum security institution? a fortiori, they have no
constitutionally based interest in avoiding a re-transfer to

31

such an institution*,
This is not to say that a. mars is deprived of all
possible constitutional liberties when he is convicted and
sentenced»
QUESTIONi Well, just a moment, Mr, Jones»

Supposing

a man is out on parole and he was originally sentenced to a
maximum security institution»

Why does he have any

constitutionally protected right to a hearing before his parols
is revoked?

Why is he different from a man who originally

goes into maximum and then gets into minimum?
MR» JONES s

In Morrissey v«, Brewer, he was

different for one of two reasons s

First, under the statutes

and regulations governing his parole, his parole could not
be revoked unless and until it was proved, that he had violated
the conditions of that parole»

That is, he had a nonconst!tu~

tional entitlement that amounted to a liberty interest»
Now, a second possibility was that he had a
constitutionally based interest once he had been freed on
parole»

I mean, it may be that once a man is liberated on

parol®, he takes on some of the protected liberty interests
that were deprived from him, taken away from him upon the
conviction and sentence.
In this case, there's no right of constitutional
origin, nor is there any of nonconstitutional origin, which
I have triad to show.

32
QUESTION;

Is that comparable to toe right that was

involved in the case of goodtime, good-behavior credit?
MR. JONESs

That’s true.

In Wolff v« McDonnell,,

the predicate for the Court’s opinion was that goodtime could
not be forfeited unless and until it was shown that there had
been misconduct.

That is not the case here.

There can be a

transfer to a prison., even to a maximum security prison# without
any showing by the State of misconduct.

There’s nothing in

the statutes# regulations or rules governing the conditions of
confinement that prevents the State from making that transfer#
for any — or no reason? but for any reason that the custodian
deems app rop ri a te „
QUESTIONS

If there were# it would be more like

solitary# if — where there’s a rule about solitary?
MR. JONES?.

Footnote 19 in the Wolff opinion seamed

to include a factual assumption that there was a statutory
or regulatory predicate that a man could not be placed in
solitary confinement unless the State had shown misconduct.
QUESTION:

And if there were that kind of a predicate#

you would ugrea there would b© a
MR. JONES?

—

Then there would be an entitlement of

nonconstitutional origin that would amount to a liberty
interest.
QUESTION: And similarly if there were a rule about
transfer?

33

MRo JONES;

That’s correct»

If the Stats adopted a rule about transfer, which,
said that a man may be transferred to a higher security
institution only if

it is shown that he is guilty of misconduct»

Then the man has a protected right, whether -that is a liberty
interest or property interest, one need not inquire into.
He has an entitlement that is safeguarded by the guarantee
of due process»
QUESTION;

You seem to say in your brief that

independently of any rule it may be that the Constitution
itself would require a hearing before a man is placed in
solitary»
At least you concede that that’s possible»
MR» JONES;

Yes, that’s a possibility0

QUESTION;

And you say we don't need to decide it

here»
But if you think that’s possible, that is, that the
Constitution itself might require a hearing, wholly aside
from any State rule, then I suppose you should — you must;,
in this case, which involves a transfer, you must face up to
that possibility? at least this isn’t, in kind, enough of a
chang® of the condition to trigger a right to a hearing»
MR» JONES;

Well, it's not that the detriment is

serious enough, all w© meant to suggest in our footnote with
regard to solitary confinement was that there may be some

34
elements of person®! freedom from physical control of the
State that have not bean wholly divested from the prisoner
•upon conviction and sentence»

We don31 concede that that’s

necessarily the case.
But we suggest that that may b@ a possibility»
QUESTIONs
QUESTION ?

Mr» Jones, what — oh, excuse me»
Laying aside the Eighth Amendment, Mr»

Jones, and laying aside all humanitarian considerations, is
there anything to prevent a State from saying that every
person convicted of homicide in the first or second degree
will be confined in solitary confinement permanently?
Laying aside the Eighth Amendment now, cruel and inhuman»
MR» JONES2

Well, I take it, that- other than tho

Eighth Amendment* nothing would prevent the State from imposing
that as a crime for proven punishment — I mean.-, as a punishment
for a proven crime.
QUESTION;

What .about the Halfway House?

Where a

prisoner is allowed to be living out in the community * working
in private industry, and retaining his money? he’d have a
little bit of property, wouldn’t ho?
MR. JONESs

Involved.

Well, I don’t try to distinguish between

property interest and liberty interest.

I think that liberty

interest can ©manata from statutes and regulations.
QUESTION!

I see.

QUESTION;

Isn’t it likely that the Morrissey v.

35

Brewer standards would probably ba thought to apply to the
Halfway House situation that Justice Marshall poses?
MR. JONES:
that hypothetical.
QUESTION:

Wellr I*ra not sure I fully understand
If the man is released -Out on a work release? on a work release,,

where he*s out. either going to school or a job, or both, and
provided he roasts certain conditions, such — roust like the
conditions of parole, he*s allowed to stay at liberty.
Now, the termination of that, I think, Mr. Justice
Marshall was posing to you.
MR. JONES:

I see.

Well, my answer to it

and it*s

the answer I've been giving to the other questions, I think —
is that if there is a nonconstitutional origin for his
interest, that is, if the statuta or regulation or rule
provides that his furlough, or whatever it is, cannot be
revoked unless it's determined that he is guilty of something,
then he has an interest -that requires some kind of due
process determination before it can be deprived.
QUESTION-:
that says:

What if Massachusetts passes a statute

Walpole is, from now on, not a penal institution,

but w© think :it*s just damn good experience for all our

citizens to spend a year there? and so, from now on, by

Right o

MR. JONESs

Th©r© are many questions I haven’t

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Jones.

Mr. Shapiro.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD SHAPIRO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SHAPIRO:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Courts
The Petitioners8 argument ignores the four critical
facts which form the basis of 'the decisions of the district
court, and the Court of Appeals in upholding the prisoners'
claims.
First of all, the close relationship of this case
to Wolff vs. McDonnell is indicated by the fact that a
disciplinary process was initiated in this ease.

This

demonstrates that there was a recognition on the part of
prison officials that there ware historical facts at contro­
versy , and that there was a violation of a regulation at
stake.
In. addition, transfer, as appears on page 117 of
the Appendi?:, is a possible sanction for major misconduct in
th® Walpole prison system,, — in the Massachusetts prison
system, pardon me

39

Second# both the district court and the Court of
Appeals noted that Massachusetts has deliberately differenti­
ated the institutions within the State# and has provided
graduated conditions of confinement in the various institutions,,
This has a definite and real meaning to the legal
conclusions reached by the Court of Appeals arid the district
court.
In Massachusetts# 'there8s a system of prisons#
ranging from maximum through medium# minimum# halfway houses#
pre-release centers? a variety of institutions with different
physical conditions of confinement# different custody controls,
different restrictions on movement# and different opportunities
for programs.
The purpose# as conceded by -the Massachusetts
Correctional Authorities# is to

allow inmates whose conduct

demonstrates that -they are able to function in a responsible
'fashion to have fewer bodily restraints placed upon them# and
to have a greater opportunity to participate in programs.
Similarly# by allowing fewer bodily restraints
placed upon the inmates, by allowing them to have a greater
opportunity to participate in programs# perhaps work in the
community part of the day# perhaps go out into the community
on furloughs# which are limited passes# it indicates to the
Parol© Board# when they consider this inmate for release on
parols# that ha or she has demonstrated responsibility in

40
their actions , and an ability to function in society, as
determined by prison officials in the placement of this person
within the prison system*
It suggests the converse is true when a person is
placed in a more restrictive condition of confinement? that
the same types of concerns are reflected by the Parole Board;
if the prison officials have already mad© some judgment about
the responsibility of this parson and the ability to function
in society»
Within the —•
QUESTION:

Do I interpret your argument, Mr» Shapiro,

then, to be that there is some kind of a property or liberty
interest in the anticipation of parole?
MR, SHAPIRO:

No, Your Honor, it flows independently

from the — any liberty interest in the anticipation of
parol©»

The analogy that the Court of Appeals drew between

this Court in Wolff vs, McDonnell is similar to the arguant
presented by the Respondents in this case.
That is, that Massachusetts had no obligation to
create a. system of confinement where there are deliberate
differentiations among the institutions, where there are
graduated conditions of confinement»

But one® having don© so,

and one® having demonstrated, in this case, that the with­
drawal of those conditions is related, and the additional
restrictions upon liberty are related to allegations of

41
serious misconduct, than at least the liberty interest of
the. Due Process Clausa, as recognized in Wolff, is implicated»
QUESTION;

But that's quite a different basis for

finding a liberty interest than Wolff found, where the statute
conferred goodtime credits and the condition on which they
should be taken away o
MR» SHAPIRO;

Your Honor, there's an independent

liberty interest that Petitioners — that Respondents assert
in this case.

There's a liberty interest which flows from

the constitutional concept of liberty, the factual restraints
upon liberty, the closer controls.
In Wolff the Court recognized that even if liberty
is State-created, that this liberty is protected by the Due
Process Claus®»

The Court did not have to fac© the question

that is precisely faced in this case, as to the physical,
factual restrictions on bodily movements.
QUESTION;

Well, okay.

That

So, supposing the man stays

at Walpole, but they've had a bad time at Walpole, so they
decide that instead of getting one hour's exercise in the
afternoon, you're only going to get half an hour, you're only
going to gat two meals a day, the whole population.

Now,

under your theory, I suppose they would be entitled to a
hearing on that?
MR, SHAPIRO;

If there*s an adverse change in

conditions of confinement, then they would be entitled to a

42
hearing? the liberty interest would bo implicated»
The question would still remain as to what process
is due 0

QUESTION:

So doss my hypothesis.

It operates as

an immediate physical change on the restraints.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Your Honor, X*m not saying that in an

appropriate case that -that may not constitute adverse change
in conditions of confinement.

What I am saying is that -this

case is even more compelling, and you don't have to reach the
issue faced by more limited restrictions on a person's
liberty.
Within the scheme — within th® Massachusetts
prison system scheme —~
QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, before you leave that point,

isn't, it rattier• fundamental that the deprivation that triggers
the operation of the Sue Process' Claus© must b© of a sufficient;

magnitude to be called a "grievous loss"?

And isn't the

response, to Mr. Justice Rehnquist that one may not necessarily
conclude that that particular deprivation is sufficiently
serious to require the procedure?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, Your,Honor.

I was suggesting

that it may implicate liberty, but it may not be —
QUESTION:

Still not be a sufficiently grievous

loss to constitute a deprivation within the meaning of th©
Fourteenth Amendment•
MR. SHAPIRO:
;os, Your i-Icnor.

It may still be a ote minimis losst
viol's why an ©valuation of the particu­

lar circumstances is necessary.

44
QUESTION?

Now, would you consider a change from an

eleven o'clock lights-out hour in the prison to nine o'clock
a deprivation that required some process?
MR. SHAPIRO;

Again, Your Honor, that question is

not before the Court? but in the appropriate ~
QUESTION:

Most of the questions we’re asking about

aren’t before the Court.

But we’re trying to probe just what

you’re driving at.
MR. SHAPIRO:

What I’m suggesting is when there are

changes in the actual physical fact of liberty, the actual
movement, the actual bodily restraints, then the liberty
interest may be implicated.
If, in your hypothetical, Your Honor, there would
be none of those changes to begin with, that it would just
function as a change in just the lighting, it may be that
that would again fall within the category of de minimis losses.
Although, if it restricts the movement of the inmate, the
ability to —*
QUESTION:

Let’s extend it, then:

the lights out at

That restricts a lot of movement now.
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That would —

What, about that?

MR. SHAPIRO:

That would implicate the liberty

interest, and I would suggest that, in appropriate circumstances,

45
it may not be a de minimis loss

,

and it may still require

some procedureo
QUESTION :

What kind of a hearing?

A sort of a

rulemaking proceeding?
MR* SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, it again —
Because it affects everybody in the

institution»
MR» SHAPIRO:

The crux of our argument is that

when allegations of serious misconduct are at issue, and the
liberty interest is implicated, there is a need for the
minimal due process provided in Wolff vs» McDonnell.
QUESTION:
MR» SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Why don't, you limit —
But. in a situation —
Why don't you limit it to the individual

instead of the whole group?

Because I would assume that if

the State of Massachusetts said that because of all the
trouble at Walpole, ws're going to make it a maximum
institution; there's nothing anybody could do about it»
Could they?
MR» SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

No,

Your Honor, that's —

So why don't you stick to the individual

involved, rather than the groups?
MR, SHAPIRO:

What I was suggesting, Your Honor, is

that even if the liberty interest of a group is implicated,
there's still the question of what procedures are appropriate»

46

And beyond the question of allegations of misconduct,
there may be lesser procedures than those required in Wolff
vs. McDonn®11.

But those procedures are necessary to insure

that the purposes of the Due Process Clausa are fulfilled in
the individual case.
In our ease, though,, we have situations where there
were allegations of-serious misconduct against individual
prison inmates.

There was no determination made with respect

to any larger group.

It focused, on individual conduct.

Within the scheme, the general scheme that 15ve
already discussed in Massachusetts*, the district court and
the Court of Appeals recognized this as a finding of fact of
the district court, that they found that the conditions of
confinement at Walpole ana Bridgewater are substantially more
adverse than those at Norfolk.
And the district — the Court of Appeals and district
court recognized that this implicated the basic values of
liberty.

The external restraints on bodily movement were

increased as a result of a transfer from Norfolk to Walpole and
Bridgewater.

There was stricter security, closer custody,

fewer programs? and it was more difficult to obtain furloughs,
work release, educational release, and other rehabilitative
opportunities.
This is fundamentally important because it demon"
stratas that the ability of the inmate to assert his

47
responsibility, to demonstrate his ability to function in
society is minimised and reduced, as he is moved back into the
system through — into higher custody status levels, and that
will affect all of the future decisions which are made about
this inmate, and could follow the inmate throughout his entire
term of incarceration*
This possibility is made more certain by the fact
'that in the present case the defendants have stipulated that
there was a notation in the' file, and that this notation did
indicate the reason, the fact of the transfer, and the reasons
for the transfer? and it was noted in the file and will b®
considered by future agencies within the Department of
Corrections, and ultimately by the Parole Board*
Now, this
QUESTION;

Is there any reason why tha Parole Board

couldn't consider total hearsay when it decides whether or not
to grant a man parole?
MR. SHAPIRO;

No, Your Honor*

W€$* re not arguing

that there's any liberty interest in parole? we’re arguing that
the liberty interest of an. inmate who is transferred involves
not only the possible impositions of sanctions as a result of
notation in the file, but also immediate disruptive, severe
changes in the nature and seriousness and conditions of
confinement.
QUESTION;

But what do you add when you say it also

48

means a notation in the file?

Assuming your other argument

is valid»
MR„ SHAPIROs

It recognises,. Your Honor, first of

all, that within the prison system it9s not just a question of
reputation that’s at issue, as was stated in Paul vs» Davis,
it’s a question of whether all the future decisions that will
affect the quality, length and severity of an inmate’s
incarceration will be based on erroneous information*

And

that’s a present interest,, to the inmate«
QUESTION %

Well, supposing the Parole Board at

the time of its hearing takes a look at the man's entire file
and finds a notation two years ago, made by the Warden, "This
guy set fire to his bunk, December 2nd, 1973"? he never had a
hearing on it, it was simply tee Warden’s observation —
maybe the Warden didn’t even observe it»
Wow, is the Parole Board prevented from considering
that, because h@ didn’t have a hearing?
MR» SHAPIROs
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor*

Then why does your argument here about

tee file notation have any added weight to your liberty claim?
MR. SHAPIRO:

It. demonstrates the Court’s concern

in Wolff vs* McDonnell with the collateral consequences that
could follow from a misunderstanding of the nature of tee
perceived charge in the prison system.

It again — it just

emphasizes the seriousness of the effects of this determina-

49
fcion upon the inmate, and therefore it demonstrates that there
are collateral as well — and future consequences, as well as
immediate, direct consequences on the inmate's condition of
the confinement and his liberty»
Now, with this factual background, which was duly
noted by the district court and the Court of Appeals, there
ar© two separate inquiries before the Court?
Whether the Due Process Clause is applicable in
the instant circumstances; and what procedures ar® required»
The Court of Appeals, first of ail, read Wolff as
implicating liberty interests in two respects»
In on© respect there are the external physical
restraints upon bodily movement., which were not discussed in
Wolff, but which ar® present in a transfer to mors adverse
conditions of confinement»
The Court recognised that this implicated the liberty
interest, and then considered whether they were certain and
serious enough to implicate 'the liberty clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment,
The Court found that the. adverse change in conditions,
of confinement, based on the factual record in -this case, had
severe, abrupt, immediate and comprehensive effects on the
prisoner's limited liberty»

There were additional -bodily

restraints placed on the inmate, and several other instances
of transfer, which affected the nature, severity, and possibly

50
the length of his incarceration.
These direct and immediate losses are identical to,
if not more serious -than, those already recognized in Wolff,
Goodtima, as the Court recognized in Wolff has a future effect,,
and may be restored,

A transfer represents an immediate

disruptive effect on all the conditions of confinement of
the inmate,
QUESTION;
I*m interested.

Since you*ve said that several times,

Suppose they have just built a new institu­

tion in Massachusetts?, of the same level of security as the
prisoners then confined, and they transfer the prisoner to
that place without consulting him, he*s just informed one
day that, "Tomorrow morning, get your things ready", and he's
taken.
Is a hearing required on that?
MR. SHAPIRO;

Your Honor, in that situation, the

liberty interest would be implicated if there is an adverse
change in conditions of confinement.
QUESTION:

It's not —

Well, just take my hypothetical.

It's a

brand-new, modern, the most modern institution of its kind
available.
MR. SHAPIRO;

As the First Circuit has recognized,

there are disruptions inherent in transfer.

There's a

discontinuation of programs, there are changes in the inmate's
daily, life which,

affect all aspects? so, in any case, —

51
QUESTIONS

But your answer is they must have a

hearing in order to do that?
MR, SHAPIROs

No, Your Honor»

I was suggesting

that the liberty clausa is implicated.
Now, the appropriate procedures that may be
required in those circumsfcances depend on balancing the
interest, and if -there —
QUESTION :

Who is going to do the balancing?

MR. SHAPIRO2
QUBSTIQN:

Well, ~

The district judge or the Warden.?

MR. SHAPIRO:

I would suggest that when allegations

of serious misconduct are not at issue, Your Honor, the
balancing can be left, in the first instance, as this Court,
recognised in Wolff, to the sound discretion of correctional
officials.

So long as they fulfill the purposes of the Due

Procsss Clause, which are to protect 'the individual against
arbitrary action of the government, and to insure that
determinations are made on the basis of reliable information
for imposition of the sanction; which, in this case, is a
trans fer»
QUESTION:

Well, there's no sanction here; the

Corrections Board, the over-all supervisory body, has built
a new institution, and they decide that 650 from one
5. restitution must be moved into the new one to relieve
crowding, 350 from another, and so on.

52

Mo invidious action, no discipline, they’re just
going to move 650 people»
MR, SHAPIROs

Is a hearing necessary?

So long as the determination --if

the determinations are based on allegations of individual
misconduct or misbehavior, a hearing is necessary»
QUESTIONt

You3 re not following my hypothetical

question»
MR» SHAPIRO:

In the situation where there is a

selection of inmates, some lesser — the liberty interest is
still implicatedj the question is still, What procedures are
appropriate in those circumstances?
And it may be, based on those circumstances, that
some lesser procedures ar® appropriate to fulfill the purposes
of the Due Process Claus© in -chose circumstances»
I would suggest that a checklist might be provided,
informal consultation, other types of means of —- an
opportunity for the inmate to submit facts to the correctional
authorities.
QUESTION:

Mr. 3hapi.ro, let me try9 with the Chief

Jusfcice5 s question.
If they build a brand-new institution to take care
of all the prisoners in this existing institution, and this
existing institution had been condemned and is falling down;
they could move them then, couldn’t they?
MR» SHAPIRO:

Yes, Your Honor»

QUESTIONS

Mrc Shapiro, there was a hearing here?

in what respects do you consider it deficient?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Your Honor, as both the district court

and Court of Appeals noted, there was? inadequate notice under
the standards in Wolff.
One® the liberty interest is implicated, as we
suggested, Du® Process procedures must be applied.

In cases

where the allegations are cf serious misbehavior and are no
different than those that were considered by the Court in
Wolff, then the san» minimal due process procedures are
required.
In this case, the notice did not even state the time
and place of the alleged offense.
QUESTION:

The —

Any question that they knew when the

hearing would be held?
MR. SHAPIRO:

The inmates knew when the hearing

would be held, but they didn't know anything about the time
or place of the conduct charged in -the notices of the
classification hearing.

That, was the failure to follow

minimal due process that was recognized by the Court of
Appeals *
The opportunity to be heard then became a hollow
ritual. Your Honor, because the inmates did not know what they
were supposed to defend themselves against, what charges?
they appeared primarily with

5-4
they had no idea hew to deal with the allegations of misconducts
I would only suggest that in these circumstances
the hearing requirements to consider allegations of serious
misconduct did not even provide the minimal due process re­
quirements recognised by this Court in Wolff.
QUESTION;

If the notices had complied with —

under requirements you just described* would the hearings
otherwise have bean adequate?
MR. SHAPIRO;

Provided that a summary of the

information* which gave the inmates some idea of the conduct
that was charged; yes, the hearings would have been adequate,
because then the inmate would have had an opportunity to be
heard in response to the charges.
In this case, tee opportunity to be heard was
meaningless, because the inmate wasn't even aware of the
charges.
QUESTION;

Mr. Shapiro, Mr. Donahue told us that

bote sides agreed, as I recall it — and I may have it wrong
— that if the summary of evidence had been disclosed to the
inmates, that there would have been a threat of serious harm
to people involved.

Is that correct?

MR. SHAPIRO;
the record.

Your Honor, that does not appear in

That was never presented as an evidentiary

matter. It was never suggested even to the Classification

55
Boardo
I would suggest, Your Honor, that the record
reflects that the Classification Board never considered whether
the release of any of the informant information would endanger
the informants»
At the district court level there was no indication
that the release of the time and place of the alleged offense,
that minimal amount of information to allow the inmate an
opportunity to be heard would in any way endanger the security
of the institution»
QUESTION;

Assume, hypothetically, that the release

of the information was stated by the director or Warden of
the institution as something that would endanger the lives
and safety of the informants; would you think they could
withhold the details from -the subjects?
MR» SHAPIRO;

Your Honor, a heavy burden would bs

placed upon them in that case»

I would say, no, they

couldn*-;: withhold basic information such as the time and place
of the alleged offense, or else they would erode all of the
minimal due process procedures recognised in Wolff»
QUESTION:

But -*»

Well, the time and place might enable

th© subject to identify the informant very readily; probably
would»
MR» SHAPIRO;

If —* at that point, Your Honor, the

heavy burden would be placed upon th© correctional officials

56

to demonstrat© why minimal due process procedures in Wolff
should be erodesd in the instant circumstances.
That's not the situation in our case* because in
our case there was a regulation in effect at Walpole* which
was a maximum security prison* which indicated that a release
of summary of informant information was appropriate and
consistent with correctional goals* and would not — and this
reflects the sound discretion of correctional administrators
that a release in Massachusetts wuld not be inconsistent
with legitimate correctional goals* absent any demonstration
on the record by the prison officials in this ease why that
regulation should not have been followed* or why to® minimal
due process procedures in Wolff

shouldn't have bean followed*

they failed to meet their burden.
In another case they would still have that burden*
but perhaps they could meet it.
QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro* may I ask an unrelated

question* while you*re interrupted.
In some of the briefs there is reference to toe larges
number of transfers* I think the government brief tells us
there are 14 or 15 thousand a year* something like that* in
that system.

I don't recall what toe number is in Massachu­

setts? but .is there anything in the record that you're «Mare
of that tells us how many of those transfers* or what the
proportion of trans fers are from

&

higher security classifies-

5?

tion to a lower, as opposed to from a lower to a higher?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Noc

There's nothing that I'm aware

of- either in Massachusetts or in th© federal system that
provides -that information, or provides information about how
many higher-custody transfers may have been voluntary
transfers, and may not have involved any disputes of
allegations of misconduct or any disputed facts, and th©
inmate just merely wanted a transfer»
QUESTION s

I would suppos® th© normal change would

be from higher to lower classification, just as one works
toward parole? right?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, Your Honor»

But in an excep­

tional case there may be movement to higher classification,
to be closer to relatives or closer to family? and the
statistics don't reveal any of that information at all»
QUESTION s
MR. SHAPIROs

Thank you.
In summary, with respect to the

interests implicated, the prisoners maintain that there's a
liberty interest which flows because — from th® Constitution,
which resulted from the external bodily restraints upon the
prisoners and the closer custody and conditions of confine­
ment; that, secondarily, within Massachusetts, because of the
deliberate differentiation of conditions of confinement,
because of the graduated conditions of confinement, there's a
liberty inherent, in effect State-created, as in Wolff, and

58
very similar to th© creation of goodtime credits in Wolff,

which is implicated by a transfero
And, as we’ve argued in our brief, there’s also a
property interest which is implicated in this case, and
because of the particular statutes and administrative
regulations in Massachusetts»
There are two points that deserve emphasis, Your
Honor, in conclusion:
One is that a hearing in these circumstances is
necessary to insure that there’s a reliable determination of
th® disputed facts»

Minimal due process procedures in tills

cas® will not impinge at all on the appropriate good-faith
exercise of administrative discretion»
One© the facts have been reliably found, than the
correction officials will b© free to exercise their
discretion„
In the cas© where allegations of serious misconduct
ere at issue, this Court has already recognised that the need
for minimal due process procedures is evident, and that in
similar situations, when transfer results in th® same
deprivations, the need is no less»
Petitioners, the prison officials, in addition,
concede in their argument that they, th© prison officials,
have no interest in acting arbitrary and capriciously®
hearing in -these circumstances would insure that their

And a

59
discretion is exercised appropriately and on the basis of
facts reliably found.
The Petitioners — the prison officials ~ the
prisoners’ claims — pardon res, Your Honors
considerations already reflected in Wolff,

is grounded in
The prisoners do

retain a residuum of liberty# a limited liberty.

When this is

interfered with# the Due Process Clause is implicated.
When allegations of misconduct are at issue# minimal
due process procedures are necessary to insure reliable
determination of fact,

Other circumstances# not presented by

allegations of misconduct# and not presented in the instant,
case# other transfer circumstances# where liberty interests
are implicated- may be left to the sound discretion of prison
officials to forge appropriate procedures # based on the
individual circumstances.

So long as these procedures insure

-that the lofty purposes of the Due. Process Clause are
maintained in the prisons of this country.
Thank you,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you# Mr. Shapiro.

Mr, Donahue# do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL C. DONAHUE# ESQ, ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. DONAHUE:

Yes, Mr. chief Justice.

May it pleas® the Court:
Just two brief points.

The possibility of a transfer

60
occurring for disciplinary measures is somewhat invidious in
The sanctions -'chat may be imposed by the

the recordo

disciplinary regulations which appear in this record include
transfer, as a possible sanction*
That is not -the practice in Massachusetts,

First

of all* because those regulations are no longer in effect?
and, second of all, it was never the practice of the
disciplinary board; to transfer? it only recommended transfers
to the Classification Board,
I'd like to address the point that Mr, Shapiro
raised concerning the inmate's interest in remaining in the
institution.
As Mr, Jones pointed out, all of these inmates, in
this instance, were sentenced-to MCI Walpole, prior to being
transferred, for whatever re-asoh, to MCI Norfolk,

No reason

is apparent in th© record why any of these inmates were ever
sent to Norfolk,
Transfers occur in Massachusetts for a myriad of
reasons.

They may occur because of population control,

They may occur simply because of program availability.

They

may — for certain matters in Massachusetts, they may occur
because of the hospital at Norfolk, which is regarded as
significantly better than the hospital at Walpole,

Inmates

who have medical problems may be sent to Norfolk,
It does not depend on their behavior.

It is not

61
predicated • upon their behavior.

There may be general

instances where an inmate will be transferred to Norfolk
for behavior# but there is no indication in the record of
this case that any of these inmates were sent to Norfolk
because they were better behaved than other inmates who
remained at Walpole.
QUESTION %

Did you mention# or did someone mention

earlier in the argument# a figure of -the total number of
transfers in one year in Massachusetts?

Qr was that in the

other case?
MR. DONAHUE?

I believe it might have bean in the

other case# Your Honor.
QUESTION?
MR. DONAHUE?

But you don01 know what the figure is?
I don't think such statistics are

available.
In any event# I think it would be significantly
less

t

because there are approximately 2700 inmates in

Massachusetts.

The institutions at Norfolk and Walpole are

only approximat®ly one mile apart# so there, wouldn't probably
be any significant disruption of the administrativa process.
We do not contend that that would b© the case here.
QUESTION:

What is the total prison population in

Massachuaetts?
MR. DONAHUE?

QUESTION?

Approximately 2700# Your Honor.
That's the total?

62
MR. DONAHUE;
QUESTION;

Yes-* Your Honor»

Mr. Donahue* would you car® to comment

on th© adequacy of the notice here?

I know you suggest that

no hearing at all was necessary? but* assuming a hearing was
necessary* what do you say about the notice?
MR® DONAHUE;

Your Honor* the district court and the

Court of Appeals said that the notice was inadequate because
it did not state -'die time and placa of the hearings

[sic] 0

My brother said that was not presented.
The district court’s rulings include a reference to
the defendants assarting that to give such notice would have
compromised the safety of the informants.

It was my

clients' position that any further notice* any further detail
would have seriously compromised the safety of 'the informants .
As the Chief Justice pointed out earlier in a
question* in Norfolk* which is an open institution* whore
inmates roam generally at will* there would have been a great
deal of probability that giving the time and place of the
offense that they were charging* the informant could have
been identified.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
Th® case is submitted.

Thank you* gentlemen.

[Whereupon* at 2s01 p.m., the case: in th® above*’
entitled matter was submitted.!
