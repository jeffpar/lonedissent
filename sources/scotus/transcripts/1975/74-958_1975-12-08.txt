PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

next in United States against Janis.
Mr. Solicitor General, you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. BORK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
We are here upon a writ of certiorari to the Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

The Court of Appeals

affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment against
the United States and did so on the basis of the district
court's findings of fact and conclusions of law without any
opinion of its own.
The district court granted summary judgment to
respondent, both upon his suit for a refund of taxes collected
under an assessment and a levy, and also upon the Government's
counterclaim for the unpaid balance of the assessment.
The facts underlying this suit are fairly simple.
The Los Ange3.es Police Department prepared an affidavit,
somewhat lengthy, designed to show probable cause for a search
and obtained from the municipal court judge a warrant directing
the search for bookmaking paraphernalia, and in the search
that ensued, respondent and one Morris Levine were arrested

4
and certain property, including $4/940 in cash/ was seizedShortly after that occurred/ the Los Angeles police
officer notified a Revenue agent of the Internal Revenue
Service of the arrest and of the seizure.

There is a Federal

tax, of course, on wagers, and since respondent and Levine
filed no tax returns for the period in question, the Internal
Revenue Service checked the wagering records and calculated
the number of days the surveillance of respondent Levine
indicated that the wagering activity had gone on, that
indicated a period of 77 days.
Working with that information, the Service made an
assessment against respondent Levine of about $89,000 plus
interest, and pursuant to that assessment the Internal
Revenue Service levied upon the cash seized by the Los
Angeles police in partial satisfaction of respondent's
tax liability.
The State prosecution for respondent Levine for
illegal gambling foundered when the same municipal court judge
who had issued the warrant granted a motion to quash it on
the ground that the supporting affidavit was inadequate to
show the reliability of the information passed on by the
informants, although it was adequate to indicate the
reliability of the informants themselves.
Two years later respondent began this tax refund
suit, and as I have said, the Government counterclaimed for the

5

unpaid balance of -the assessment.
Now, the cases hold that a taxpayer claiming a
refund or opposing a collection suit has the burden of proving
his real tax liability.

Respondent presented no evidence

upon that issue whatever.

He relied exclusively upon a motion

to suppress the tax assessment on the ground that the
information on which the assessment was based had been illegally
obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment.
The district court accepted that theory and suppressed
the assessment, and fchs Ninth Circuit affirmed, as I say,
per curiam and 'without, opinion.
I think the .legal theory underlying these decisions
below is an extraordinary one, or rather it must be an
extraordinary one because it's not articulated in the district
court or in the Court of Appeals beyond the statement that the
Government's assessment grew out of knowledge.

It was

ultimately held to have been obtained by a search warrant that
did not meet Fourth Amendment standards, a warrant obtained
by the Los Angeles police.
How that fact connects with this tax litigation is
nowhere explained, and I will attempt to show that there is
no adequate connection.
What has happened here is that the court below
without analysis or argument have fashioned a sweeping
extension of the exclusionary rule.

When I say without

6

argument, I mean without argument by the court.

This

extension amounts to a new rule that not only may evidence be
excluded from judicial proceedings, but that the Government
may be required to forego its civil rights, if it knew of its
civil rights, only because some other government obtained
information under a warrant subsequently held to be inadequate.
QUESTIONS

What civil rights does the Government

MR. BORK:

The right to the collection of taxes,

have?

Mr. Justice Rahnquist.

I meant its rights in a civil

litigation.
QUESTION;

Oh.

QUESTION:

This must have some effect, I suppose,

on the activities under the informants statutes where people
secretly inform, give information that leads to tax liability.
Is that possible?
MR. 30RK:

I suppose it would be if they had given

the information to the Internal Revenue Service, but I don’t
think it would apply in this situation where the information
was given to the Los Angeles Police Department for a criminal
investigation, at least not that I know of.

There is

certainly nothing in the record that suggests any such
QUESTION:

What I am suggesting is the possibility

that when a tax assessment or deficiency claim is based upon
an informant's information, this case would perhaps have some

7
implication that the court must inquirer or someone must
inquire, into how the informant got his information that he
passed on to the Internal Revenue.
MR. BORK;
Justice.

Is that possible?

I suppose it's possible, Mr. Chief

I suppose in the case of an informant speaking

directly to the Internal Revenue Service, that the Internal
Revenue Service would verify the information in some other
way before they could collect the taxes.
No, I think you’re right, they might make an
assessment on the basis of that information which could be
hearsay even as a grand jury’s indictment could be based on
hearsay.

And if the assessment resulted in a collection, I

think that's correct.
QUESTION?

Mr. Solicitor General, would you have a

different case if the Internal Revenue Service agents had seized
these records and this money directly themselves by a warrant
of search.
MR. BORKs

I think one might, Mr. Justice Powell.

There is a suggestion in respondent’s brief here that if
this assessment is not suppressed, Internal Revenue agents
will be free to break into homes and offices.
I find that suggestion mildly humorous because I
don’t think the Internal Revenue Service has any such
intention or perhaps indeed capacity.
But I will suggest in -the course of this argument

8
that it would be unwise to extend the exclusionary rule to
civil litigation.

But the basis for that suggestion

essentially is in -the world as we know it and as the courts
observe it illegal searches and seizures primarily occur in
connection with criminal investigation, and there just isn't
much evidence, or any, perhaps, evidence of illegal search
and seizure in civil matters.
Should that become common by the Internal Revenue
Service or any other agency of Government, and I suppose the
time would have come to consider the extension of the
exclusionary rule to that class.of cases.
stand now we have nothing like that.

But as matters

And it would be a

different case, as you suggested.
QUESTIONS

General Bark, how frequently do we have

a situation of this kind where the IRS is using material so
obtained from State or local authorities?
MR. BQRK;

The only thing in the record on that,

Mr. Justice Blackmun, is the statement by the police officer
here that when it was a large book‘-making operation, he
generally notified the Internal Revenue Service.
a smaller .one, he did not.

If it was

He said that was not a departmental

policy, and he supposed that some other officers would not
notify the IRS, but he would.
As a nationwide matter, I frankly do not know the
frequency with which it occurs.

9
QUESTION;

Mr. Solicitor General, suppose the

Federal tax people were told or otherwise knew that the
information that was being presented to us had been obtained
by patently illegal search and seizure.

I know you suggest

as a general rule you should avoid the exclusionary rule,
but what about in the individual case where the officer knows.
MR. BQRK:

I think, Mr. Justice White, that the

issue is always an issue of general deterrence and not an
issue of are we upset about this case, because this Court has
recognized it is too late to repair the privacy interests of
the individual raising the case.

All that can be done is to

deter the police in the future.
If there were a common pattern and practice by
which police in any city or police generally conducted
unconstitutional raids for the purpose of handing the informa­
tion over to the IRS, then I think we would have a different
kind of case altogether, and we would have to consider at that
point the fashioning of the exclusionary rule when the
Internal Revenue Service attempted to benefit by that kind of
a practice.
QUESTION;

But even if you were going to say that

you would exclude evidence

on

the facts I posed, that is

not the case here, I take it.
MR. RORK;

That is not ail the case here.

.
This

case is a case in which ail the facts indicate the Los Angeles

10

Police Department acted in the utmost good faith, obtained
a warrant, and the Internal Revenue Service acted in the
utmost good faith.

And 1 will suggest, indeed, in a moment

that I think it’s probably unlikely that the evidence should
have been excluded even in a State trial, much less in the
Internal Revenue’s proceedings.
The crucial element —
QUESTION:

Did you say should not have been?

MR. BORK:

I will suggest, Mr. Justice Brennan,

that when a warrant has been obtained, when the primary
purpose of the exclusionary rule has been carried out to
force or to get the police before a neutral and detached
magistrate and when they make a good faith and bona fide
effort to show probable cause and later it is said that there
is a procedural defect, indeed, a mistake on the part of the
magistrate if you would ask in this case, something didn’t
satisfy him, it is quite likely the information —
QUESTION:

I wonder if that issue is here.

MR. BORK:

Well, it’s one way to decide this case,

as I look at this case.
QUESTION:

It’s not addressed below, of course.

MR. BORK:

Well, the Court of Appeals didn’t say

anything, Mr. Justice Brennan, and the district court merely
had findings of fact and conclusions of lav;.
As I look at this case, there are so many ways it

11
could be decided, and I suggest they are all ways it could
be decided in favor of the Government, that I would urge upon
you a variety of ways to cut this case .for decision»
One of them, of course, is the one I just mentioned,
because the crucial element in the exclusionary rule is the
factor deterrence.

Is there a realistic judgment that

excluding evidence in a particular class of cases will
actually deter police officials or others from illegal
searches and seizures, force them before magistrates.
Now, I think deterrence is not usefully applied to
people v;ho have acted in complete good faith and turn out to
be mistaken in a close case.
QUESTION:

Under the holding that we have before us

©ssentiaJJ.y the district court holding, suppose the IRS had
come to this information by reading in the Los Angeles Times
an account of the motion to suppress in the State courts and
then proceeding from that information conducted an investigation.
Does this holding insulate rhe Government?

Or would it be

subject to the same challenge your friend is making?
MR. BORKs

I think that, Mr. Chief Justice, would

be subject to the same challenge that my brother is making
here.

I think this is an extraordinary sweeping ruling which

says, I think, that if the Government's knowledge can be
traced back through however many links to an illegal search
and seizure, the Government is not entitled to have that

12
knowledge.
QUESTION;

Even though that knowledge has become

public property by virtue of being reported in a nex^spaper
account of the motion to suppress?
MR. BORK;

Well, if it were not the view of the

court below and of my brother here that the Government would
be foreclosed in such a case, then I think it would be
relatively unimportant that the Government was told by a
Los Angeles police officer because the Government could have
learned of it easily later through the proceedings in the
municipal court.
I think it is a very sweeping rule that is being
urged upon us.

I suppose I could distinguish the case you

put, but in honesty I think the rationale below really says
if the knowledge derives from illegally seized evidence, it
may not be used.
QUESTION;

Tell me, Mr. Solicitor General, your

emphasis on deterrence, suppose one's view was that the
exclusionary rule has other premises, traditional integrity,
and so forth?
MR. BORK;

Well, I think it has been suggested,

Mr. Justice Brennan, that those other, particularly judicial
integrity, interests run just about parallel with deterrence
so that the analysis turns out to be much the same.

And,

indeed, if judicial integrity meant that evidence of this

13
sort could not be used in this tax litigation, then I would
really suppose that you would have to overrule Harris v. New
York, Calandra, Peltier, because those are all cases in which
evidence of this sort gets used in some way.

And if judicial

integrity means that under no circumstances may anything
happen because of —
QUESTION:

I guess those are all three cases in which

I dissented, weren't they?

upon?

MR. BORK:

True, Mr. Justice Brennan.

QUESTION:

What was the case that Harris relied

MR. BORK:

Walder.

QUESTION:

I don't think Justice Brennan dissented

in that case.
MR. BORK:

No, but I do recall

same as Walder or not.
QUESTION:

I wasn't here when Walder was --

MR. BORK: That's what I mean.
In any event, I think this rule, one of which I
urge that when a warrant has been sought in good faith with
a good faith attempt to show probable cause, that there ought
not to be exclusions.

It would obviously go beyond this case,

it would go to criminal cases.
decision like -that.

And there is a basis for a

For example, Aguilar v. Texas notes that

a magistrate's mistake is not to be taken as seriously as a

14
police officer's mistake when he acts without a warrant.

And

there is the observation in Peltier that if the purpose of
the exclusionary rule was to deter unlawful police conduct,
then evidence obtained from a search should be suppressed only
if it can be said that the law enforcement officer had
knowledge or may be properly charged with knowledge that the
search was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that in the legendary

language of Justice Cardozo it is the blunder of the magistrate,
not the blunder of the constable?
MR. BORK;

I think that is certainly much of what is

involved here, Mr. Chief Justice.

We had a police officer

make a good faith attempt to put as much information as he
could in, and a magistrated accepted it.
QUESTION:

Surely you would be contending for the

same position if there had been no warrant, would you not?

one

MR. BORK:

If there had been no warrant?

QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. BORK;

Oh, in this case?

I was just offering

I would, indeed, because I think there is no deterrence*

here, but I was offering one way to cut the case.
The other way to cut the case is that this is a
civil litigation and. for the reasons I have discussed earlier
I think there is no reason to extend the exclusionary rule
into civil litigation when we know in this class of case

15
there is no evidence that there is anything to deter, and in
Calandra, of course, it is noted that the standing requirement
is premised on a recognition that the need for deterrence and
hence the rationale for excluding the evidence are strongest
where the Government's unlawful conduct would result in the
imposition of a criminal sanction.
Now, it may be that Camara v. Municipal Court comes
close to saying that the exclusionary rule, or that warrants
can be required in civil cases.

However, that, of course,

resulted in a criminal prosecution.
And I have suggested earlier that indeed if one
began to see a pattern of unlawful searches and seizures in
the enforcement of civil liability, that it might become
necessary to consider the extension of the exclusionary rule
to civil cases.

But that is not the case here.

QUESTION;

Whatever Camara may or may not have hinted

at, has that not been swallowed up by Harris and Calandra
and the other cases you referred to?
MR. BORK:
Justice.

Well, in a sense it had, Mr. Chief

I was just suggesting that there is a suggestion in

Camara that even if it were a purely civil case, a 'warrant
might be required in that context.

And I was merely suggesting

that I am not trying to draw
QUESTION:
Solicitor General.

It’s an odd way of putting it, Mr1.

16

MR. BORK:

I will try to straighten the observation.

The warrant could be required in that context, but
that was a criminal prosecution, the opinion also noted, so
I don't think it's a direct holding that the exclusionary rule
or the warrants requirement might always be used in civil
cases.

But I am willing to recognize the possibility that in

a variety of kinds of civil cases, if you get unlawful searches
and seizures as a pattern, one might extend the exclusionary
rule to that kind of

MR. BORK:

present, Mr. Justice White, I am suggesting, because we have
no pattern of unlawful searches and seizures to enforce civil

QUESTION:

But you wouldn't suggest that the Fourth

Amendment is designed only to protect against -- only to
protect criminal defendants.
MR. BORK:

No, no.

I didn't mean to suggest that at

all5 if I did, I misspoke.
QUESTION:

And that even if you couldn't exclude

evidence in a civil case, you could sue for damages if there

17
had been an illegal search or seizure»
MR, BORKs

That is true.

But here if we are talking about deterrence
realistically, it seems to me bad enough to apply the
exclusionary rule to Los Angeles police behavior in this case.
It seems to me

little short ludicrous to apply the exclusionary

rule to the Internal Revenue Service in this case.

I can't

imagine what it is that the Internal Revenue Service is
expected to do differently in the future.

I cannot imagine

what behavior of the Internal Revenue Service is to be modified.
The only result here is that respondent escapes
paying taxes that other people in respondent’s position must
pay.

The deterrent rationale here has reached a vanishing

point.
There is one aspect of respondent’s brief not
discussed in ours and I should mention it briefly.

He raises

a Fifth .Amendment point at the end of his brief, the argument
being apparently that for respondent to meet his burden of
proof to establish his tax liability, he would have to
incriminate himself because short of saying he was not
engaged in bookmaking, he would have to say, "I was engaged
in bookmaking, but I didn't make that much money."
In the first place that is not in issue here.

This

question here and the decision below is entirely about the
fact that the Government learned of respondent's activities

18
because of a search later held to be unlawful.
And I would also point out that in this case the
statute of limitations,, both Federal and State, have run. If this
case goes back for trial, there is no possibility respondent
could incriminate himself. He was arrested on November 30,
1968.

The longest California statute is three years.

Federal statute is five.

The

Indeed, it is not shown that he

meets the other requirements of the Federal statute.
I should point out to the Court that insofar as this
is a generalizable problem and not really a problem relating
to this respondent, the tax court makes a regular practice of
deferring civil litigation until either the criminal trial, if
there is one, has been held and those proceedings are closed,
or until the statute of limitations has run.

So that the

taxpayer is not put to the choice of incriminating himself
or giving up his money.

And the Third Circuit Court of

Appeals in the lanelli case, Ianelli v. Long, 487 F. 2d 317,
at 318 has specifically authorized the practice and indeed
said it would be an abuse of discretion if a district court
refused to put a civil litigation over so that the respondent
will not be put to that kind of a choice.
I don’t think that's in -the case here, but respondent
has raised it and I thought I would mention it.
QUESTION:

Is that practice written down anywhere?

MR. BORK:

No, this is a judicial practice.

It's

19

not written down.
QUESTION;

Not a rule of the court or anything?

MR. BORK:

Of the tax court?

QUESTION;

But in the Third Circuit citation that you

I gather not.

gave us, is it cited there that it is the practice of the tax
court?
MR. BORK;

The Third Circuit said the district

court was understandably -- no, this doesn’t discuss the tax
court, Mr. Justice Stewart.

This is the Third Circuit’s

direction to the district court.
QUESTION;

District court, for a refund.

MR. BORK;

Yes.

And he says proceedings should be

deferred until the conclusion of the related criminal
proceedings or until the running of all applicable statute of
limitations, and if that’s refused and is arbitrary, it will
be cured by the appellate court.
So I think there is no Fifth Amendment issue in this
case, and I mention that merely to meet a point raised by the
respondent.
For the reasons I have discussed, the United States
asks that this case be reversed and remanded for trial.
QUESTION:

General Bork, just as a matter of curiosity,

is there any income tax aspect, of Mr. Janis* problems?
MR. BORK;
Mr. Justice Blackmun.

I believe this is entirely an excise tax,

20

QUESTION:

I gather so, but I am asking is there any

income tax assessment levied against him that is —
MR. BORIC:

There is none now that I know of.

If the

question is was one levied, the answer is no.
QUESTION:

To the extent you argue that the

exclusionary rule should not apply to civil cases generally
at this juncture in our experience, do you understand that there
are Courts of Appeals cases to the contrary other than this one?
MR. BORK:

I do.

QUESTION:

And is it a fairly general view in the

Courts of Appeals?
MR. BORIC:

I think they are split.

Our brief

discusses that, and I think they are split in the Court of
Appeals.
QUESTION:

What do you understand to be the basis of

the Courts of Appeals5 application of the exclusionary rule
to civil cases?
MR. BORK:

Well, some of them, as our brief suggests,

have invoked the dictum in Silverthorne.

The essence of the

provision is not that evidence so acquired shall not be used ~~
QUESTION:

But they have chosen from our prior

cases rather than reflect what the experience in that circuit
may be with respect to -the performance or behavior of the
Internal Revenue Service?
MR. BORK:

These aren't entirely tax cases.

And

21

furthermore, -there is no practice — the Suarez case, for
example, which is cited in footnote 14, page 37 of our
brief, is a case involving — it's a tax case, but it was a
police raid and it was not --- it was like this case in that
sense, but it was not a case of the Internal Revenue Service
fomenting the raid or carrying it on itself, and there was no
indication that we are tired of an Internal Revenue Service
practice.

None of that at all.
I think these are cases which are badly reasoned,

and in the same footnote we give the cases in the Court of
Appeals that go the other way<and I think are better reasoned
cases.
I should like to reserve any time I have left for
rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Sturman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HERBERT D„ STURMAN
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR.STURMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
Before commencing with my argument, I would like to
clear up one thing which I believe is in doubt right now.

And

that is the Solicitor referred to this case as being decided
on a motion for summary judgment.

The record is very clear

that the plaintiff had made a motion for summary judgment in
this case .

That motion was denied in April of 1972.

In

22
February of 1973 this case came to ferial in the Federal
district court.

All parties had an opportunity to present any

evidence that they desired.

Accordingly, although the case

was tried on stipulated facts and exhibits which were submitted
by speculation, all parties were represented, all parties
were in a position to submit any additional evidence that the
parties had.
QUESTION:

How would that affect the basic proposition

that is presented in this case?
MR. STURMAN:

It would affect the basic proposition

because the Government has chosen to rely solely on its
certificate of assessment.

It has not sought to introduce

any other additional evidence, any untainted evidence.

It has

not sought to put anyone on the stand who could attest to the
fact that perhaps the plaintiff was a bookmaker, that perhaps
the plaintiff was engaged in bookmaking activities.

It relies

solely upon its certificate of assessment which in turn is
based solely upon evidence obtained in violation of the
taxpayer's fourth amendment rights.

And I think it is

significant because as a former government counsel, I know
that had I tried that case I might have put a lot more
evidence into the record and tried to put evidence into the
record.

But here we have a naked certificate of assessment.
QUESTION:

sharper relief.

Doesn’t that put the basic issue in

23
MR. 3TURMAN s

It does put the basic issue into

relief very clearly.
The Government's position appears to be that,
number one, the exclusionary rule should not be applied in a
civil case, and primarily that the rule should not be applied
because it will not constitute a deterrent.

Additionally,

as mentioned in the Government’s brief, the Government
contends that notwithstanding the fact that the exclusionary
rule may be applied, the Federal tax assessment retains his
presumption of validity and as such the taxpayer has a further
burden in order rebut this presumption of validity.
With all due respect to the Solicitor General, I
believe that the deterrence argument is really here in this
case.

Our record establishes that the Los Angeles police

officer who had arrested the taxpayer had contacted the
Internal Revenue Service as a matter of his policy, as a
matter of police procedure.
QUESTIONs

He testified that —

I thought he denied that it was a policy

of police procedure; it was just his individual.
MR. STURMANs

He said it was his police procedure,

I believe, your Honor.
QUESTIONS

It was his.

MR. STURMAN:
QUESTIONS

His police procedure.

But it wasn’t under the rules and regulations

of the police department.

24
MR. STURMAN :

It is not under the rules and regula­

tions of the police department.
QUESTION s

What happens if the police was very

friendly with a reporter and tells him, "You know, I arrested
So and So.

He is a bookmaker."

He gave him all the facts,

and the reporter gave it to the IRS*
MR. STURMAN:

Your Honor raises an interesting

question which is precisely what happened in the Suarez case
in the tax court.

The Internal Revenue Service obtained

the information in that case from the newspaper.

The newspaper

article was printed, the Internal Revenue Service then went
to see the police department.

And the tax court in Suarez

held that since the proposed assessment was based solely upon
illegally obtained evidence, the assessment was stripped of
its presumption of validity, therefore the Government had the
burden of coming forward with untainted evidence in order to
establish the assessment.
QUESTION:

And that’s your position.

Once it’s

illegally — the Fourth. Amendment rights are violated, there
is no way it can ever be used.
MR. STURMAN:

That is not my position, your Honor.

Our case is based on a very careful record, and our
record clearly establishes that the assessment was based
solely upon illegally obtained evidence.
QUESTION:

That assumes it was illegally obtained.

25
The Government doesn't agree It was illegally obtained.
MR. STURMAN:

The Government in its petition for

certiorari conceded that the evidence was illegally obtained.
Now the Government has taken somewhat of a lesser,conciliatory
position.
However, I would like to address myself to one thing
the Chief Justice stated about that.

And that is that the

blunder of the magistrate is what we have here as opposed to
the blunder of the lav; enforcement official.
I don't think we have that at all.

If you read that

affidavit that the lav; enforcement official submitted, the
affidavit clearly shows that law enforcement official was
familiar with the Aguilar case because he details with
particularity the credibility of his informant.

But he has

nothing in there with respect to the underlying circumstances
which gave rise to the informant's tip.
QUESTION:
par

What if we were to decide that we wouldn't

search warrants in civil proceedings the way we did in

Aguilar and SpineHi in criminal proceedings?
MR. STURMANs
QUESTIONs

OK.

I'm not sure I understand the question,
Aguilar and SpineHi were direct

appeals in criminal proceedings, and there the court went into
some detail as to whether the affidavit properly supported the
issue in civil warrant.

They were criminal cases.

What if we

were to decide in this case that in a civil proceedings we

26
wouldn’t go behind the warrant, we would say that the Fourth
Amendment was sufficiently complied with when you have taken
your evidence before a neutral magistrate and we won’t worry
about whether the affidavit was sufficient in the light of
the criminal holdings in Aguilar and Spinelli.
MR. STURMAN:

What your Honor is suggesting is a

different standard for the admissibility of evidence in a
civil case as opposed to a criminal case.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. STURMAN:

Well, I think what you would foe doing

here is you would say that the Fourth Amendment, you would be
giving a criminal greater dignity than a civil taxpayer.
QUESTION:

You could put it the other way around

and say that where you are going to impose criminal sanctions
on a citizen, you will hold the Government to a higher
standard than when you are simply trying to collect back
taxes.
MR. STURMAN:

It’s the same Fourth Amendment applying

to all people, there, is no doubt about that.
Now, I would assume that if you have a violation of
a person's Fourth Amendment rights, that that violation should
be the same where rights are violated, whether it be for
criminal purposes or whether it be for civil purposes.
QUESTION:

What about the Walder case followed by

the Harris case, for example?

Those were both criminal cascas,

27
weren't they?
MR. STURMANj
QUESTION:

I believe, your Honor, they were.

And the evidence, even though concededly

obtained initially in violation, nevertheless it was
admissible in the criminal case for impeachment.
MR. STURMANs
Honor.

For impeachment purposes.

Yes, your

But there is a difference between impeachment purposes

and talcing that evidence and using that evidence as the
sole basis for a civil tax assessment.
A civil tax assessment can have the same effect as
a threat of incarceration, or actual incarceration.

The

Government has very powerful tools in the levying procedure
and the assessment procedure, but if this Court were to
reverse this case, I really think that the potential effect
could be catastrophic.

And here is why:

The court in essence would be giving a license to
all law enforcement officials to violate constitutional
rights where crime which would give rise to tax liability is
involved.

And a law enforcement official knowing that his

evidence, although insufficient for a criminal prosecution,
may nevertheless be used for civil tax liability may very
well go after that evidence.

And if the object of the rule

is to deter, we want to deter that type of conduct.
QUESTION:

What interest does the policeman in

Los Angeles have in seeing that the Federal Government gets its

28

proper tax revenues?
MR. STURMAN:
interest.

Well, your Honor, he has a very close

He has a close interest for several reasons.

In

this particular case —
QUESTION:

Is it different from yours or mine to

see that everybody pays his fair share of taxes?
MR. STURMAN:

His interest is to prevent crime,

which is a commendable interest.

However, there are many

ways of skinning a cat, and one of the ways of preventing
crime is through the use of the civil processes of the
Internal Revenue Service*
QUESTION:

You mean the way they got A1 Capone 'back

30 or 40 years ago.
MR* STURMAN:

I didn't say that.

criminal case, I believe.

That was a

I'm talking about the threat of

a civil tax assessment,of a jeopardy assessment, of a levy,
of a seizure of property.

This is a very, very powerful

governmental weapon, and these law enforcement officials know
it, and in fact the Federal Government knows it.

The Federal

Government has all these task forces today coordinating with
local law enforcement agencies.

For example, the Bureau of

Narcotics coordinates with police officers throughout the
United States, and as part of that coordination the Internal
Revenue Service is involved because of,the narcotics tax.
So there is a very close cooperation between State

29

and Federal agencies.

The object is to prevent crime, and one

of the ways of preventing crime is through the use of the
Internal Revenue Service.
QUESTION:

Maybe the object is also to collect

income taxes from a very lucrative source as far as narcotics
are concerned.
MR. STURMAN:

The object is to collect income taxes,

and the collection process is commendable, but the collection
process can be within the framework of the Constitution.
QUESTION:

The IRS might well be criticized as being

less than diligent if it didn't pursue narcotics income,
might it not?
MR. STURMAN:

There is no doubt, that the IRS should

pursue narcotics income.

There is no doubt that the IRS

should pursue a bookmaker’s income.
we really have in this case.

But let's look at what

We have a situation where a

taxpayer's Fourth Amendment rights were violated by a
governmental agency, not the United States of America, but a
local governmental agency.
QUESTION:

The Los Angeles Police Department.

MR. STURMAN:
All right.

The Los Angeles Police Department.
Now we have the Internal Revenue Service

as a result of this violation imposing tax liability against,
the taxpayer.

And the Internal Revenue Service is saying that

even though our evidence is legally obtained under the Fourth

30

Amendment, which apparently was conceded in petitioner's
brief and now I am not so sura, even though it was illegally
obtained, even if the court were to apply the exclusionary
rule, nevertheless there is a superior burden which attaches
to a civil tax assessment.
QUESTION:

When you say that the evidence was

illegally obtained, I take it there has been no trial of the
action that the Government might bring against your client yet.
MR. STURMAN:

The evidence was obtained by the

Los Angeles Police Department.
QUESTION:

What I meant,has any action that the

Government seeks to bring against your client

yet been

tried?
MR. STURMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

This case right here.

I thought you were the plaintiff in this

case.
MR. STURMAN:

We are the plaintiff in this case.

What is happening here is we as the plaintiff have sued for
approximately a $5,000 refund.

The Internal Revenue Service

as a matter of policy has denied our claim for refund and
has also filed a counterclaim where it is seeking to collect
approximately $85,000 with interest.
QUESTION:

Did the Government have an opportunity

to proffer its evidence and so forth at the trial, or did it —
MR. STURMAN:

That is precisely the first point I

31

made when I stood up here and wanted to correct something for
the record, that this was not on a motion for summary judgment.
QUESTION;

But it doesn't have to have been on a

motion for summary judgment for the matter to have gone off
on a motion to suppress, or the effect of granting of a motion
to suppress rather than a full trial on the merits.
What I am interested in is do we know from this
record precisely what evidence it was that the Government would
have used against you?

And how do you relate that particular

evidence to the unlawful search and seizure?
MR. STURMANj
evidence is involved.

All right.

We know exactly what

The evidence that was involved is

approximately §5,-000 in cash which the Government seised.
The further evidence is bookmaking markers, bookraaking
paraphernalia, upon which the Government made its determina­
tion that the taxpayer was engaged in bookmaking activities
for a 5-day period and they arrived at his daily gross for
that 5-day period.

They then discussed with the Los Angeles
»

Police Department a period of surveillance, and they made a
determination that the taxpayer had been engaged in bookmaking
activities for a 77-day period, and they averaged out his
daily gross in order to arrive at the excise tax, which is
a percentage of the gross volume of activity.
QUESTION;

That is all set out at the top of page 5A

of the district court's opinion, or it is summarized.

32

MR. STURMANs
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

Those computations aren't "evidence" in

the normal understanding of the word.
MR. STURMANs

What we have here, your Honor, is an

excise tax based on bookmaking activities.

All evidence that

the taxpayer was a bookmaker was illegally obtained evidence.
All evidence of bookmaking activities was obtained in violation
of the taxpayer's Fourth Amendment rights.

So we have a

naked assessment derived at from figures which the Revenue
Service got from the Los Angeles Police Department who had
obtained that information as a result of a defective search
warrant.
Am I being responsive to your question?
QUESTION:

When you say something is derived from

figures that were obtained from the Los Angeles Police
Department, I don’t think of "figures" being admissible in
trial in the ordinary evidentiary sense.
QUESTION:

But it’s money, you say.

They got money,

actual physical money.
MR. STURMAN:

They’ve got money plus they had

notations in order to determine the volume of bookmaking.
QUESTION:

And they proposed to introduce this money

at trial?
MR. STURMAN:

No, they proposed to introduce -- and

they did introduce — what is found on the last page of the

33

appendix.

And that is the only piece of evidence proffered

by the Government,, other than the evidence which was stipulated
to in the pretrial conference order.
QUESTION:

This certificate of assessments and

payments?
MR. STURMAN:
QUESTION;

That is correct, your Honor.

Well,

they certainly didn't seize that

from your client, did they?
MR. STURMAN;

No.

The certificate of assessment and

Payments is really the Government’s bill, so to speak.

It’s

what they contend the taxpayer owes.
QUESTION:

What is there about the certificate of

assessments and payments, which is the only thing that was in
evidence that was illegally seized?
QUESTION;

Don’t you say the whole assessment is

the product of an illegal search?
MR. STURMAN:

The information contained on this

certificate of assessment and payments is derived completely
as a result of the search which violated the taxpayer’s
Fourth Amendment rights.
QUESTION;
reasoning.

OK, there is a third step, really,in your

First, the Los Angeles Police seize something

illegally from your client.

Then the Federal officials got

hold of it, but they didn’t use that itself, or -they used that
simply to compile the information in the evidence they actually

34
did seek to use.

So you have got a fruit of the poisonous

tree problem, it seems to me, rather than a direct use of
evidence illegally seized.
MR. STURMAN:
QUESTION:

That's Suarez, isn’t it?

That is the Suarez case, your Honor.

That's Suarez that you may not base the

assessment that you make on illegally obtained evidence.
MR. sTURMAN:

That is correct, your Honor.

The

Suarez case says we have to weigh on the one hand the tax
collection process and on the other hand we have to weigh the
constitutional rights of individuals.

And the Suarez case

in the tax court, which is basically a pro-Governmenfc court,
found that the tax collection procedure ~~
QUESTION:

It depends on whether you win or lose.

MR. STURMAN; I stand corrected, your Honor.
QUESTION:

They do decide for the taxpayer on

occasion.
MR. STURMAN:

They did decide for the taxpayer and

they found that the constitutional rights were paramount.
QUESTION:

Mr. Sturman, can I go back to on© of the

statements you made some time ago.

As I understood you, you

expressed the view that you were not. taking what might be called
a per se position, you were not saying that all illegally
obtained evidence must be excluded so far as IRS is concerned.
Or stated in the affirmative, you were suggesting that the IRS
under some circumstances could use illegally obtained evidence.

35

Would you suggest some examples of when that would
be proper, in your judgment?
MR. STURMANi

I would suggest, your Honor, that there

may very well be situations where the Internal Revenue Service
has on its own sufficient evidence and that there is also
other evidence which is illegally obtained and the use of the
illegally obtained evidence would not sufficient taint the
assessment.
But I would suggest that on this record the entire
assessment is based solely upon the legally obtained evidence.
QUESTION;

Suppose in this case the Los Angeles

policeman had not tipped the IRS but the IRS had discovered
the fact that -this evidence was available through its own
independent sources and had gone to the L.A. police.
that question was put to you earlier.

I think

Does that make any

difference?
MR. STURMAN;

In my view, no, your Honor, it would

not make a difference.
QUESTION;

But I still can't quite visualize a

specific case that you would agree that the IRS may properly
use illegally seized evidence, seized illegally by, as you
say, an officer of either the State or Federal Government.
MR. STURMANs

Your Honor, perhaps I was not

responsive to your question.

I don’t think the IRS should

be able to use any illegal evidence.

What I am saying is that

36
if a portion of the assessment is predicated upon illegally
obtained evidence and a sufficient portion of the assessment
is predicated on other evidence, then the assessment should
stand.
QUESTION;

You are saying that if there is sufficient

evidence independent of the illegally seised evidence to
support the assessment, the assessment would stand.
MR. STURMANs
QUESTION;

That is correct, your Honor.

That would be true in any case involving

the exclusion of illegally seised evidence.
MR. STURMAN:
QUESTION;

That is precisely our position here.

So again you are standing on a view

that if the Government, has to rely on illegally seised
evidence, in every case, that would not be permissible under
the Constitution.
MR. STURMAN:
QUESTION;

That is correct, your Honor.

There is one further thing and that is

illegally obtained evidence in a civil case will have a much
more detrimental effect against the victim than if it were to
get into evidence in a criminal case, and the reason being
because of the difference of burdens of proof.

In the criminal

case the Government has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
Here the Government has a presumption of validity in its
assessment and only has to prove by a preponderance of the
evidence.

So the admission of the illegally obtained evidence

37

is more detrimental to the civil litigant than it is to the
criminal litigant because of the different standards in burden
of proof.
QUESTION;

Is that any more than saying $89,000 in

taxes is always painful with your legitimate business man or
part of the Mafia.
MR. STURMAN;

It's painful, your Honor, there is no

doubt about that.
QUESTION;

That doesn't get us very far, does it?

MR. STURMAN;

But the point is pain as a consequence

of one governmental agency using

illegally obtained evidence

from another governmental agency
QUESTION:

How can the Internal Revenue Service

deter or influence the conduct of the Los Angeles police?
MR. STURMAN:

Very easily.

How can we deter?

Because, as I mentioned before, we have the task force, we
have the close governmental cooperation, and the Los Angeles
police works very closely with the Bureau of Narcotics.
QUESTION;

You mean the Bureau of Narcotics might

say to the Los Angeles police,

If you continue getting

defective warrants, we are not going to cooperate with you
on the narcotics traffic?
MR. STURMAN;

No, the Bureau of Narcotics may say

to the Los Angeles police, "Get him under any circumstances,"
and this may seem harsh, but the Bureau of Narcotics are

38

comprised of people who want to stop the narcotics traffic,
and oftentimes the end justifies the means, and law enforcement
officials' conduct should be deterred.

One of th© ways of

deterring that is by applying the exclusionary rule in this
case because if the exclusionary rule is not applied, then
what we have here is a situation where every law enforcement
official who is involved in preventing crime which involves
tax-producing conduct, will go out to get his evidence under
any circumstance.

He will get the evidence for the simple

reason that if he can't use that evidence at his level in a
criminal prosecution, the evidence may be turned over to the
Internal Revenue Service so he will be in essence accomplishing
indirectly what he can't accomplish directly.
QUESTION;

Wouldn’t it be more to his own advantage,

though, to see that the evidence was obtained legally if his
responsibility is primarily criminal rather than civil?
MR. STURMANs
advantage.

Of course, it. would be to his

But there are situations where th® evidence is

difficult to come by.
For example, in this affidavit
don't have a blunder by a magistrate.

we have here, we

We have a blunder by

a police officer who detailed very carefully the reliability
of the informant but had no reference whatsoever as to what
the underlying basis of the tip was.
Well, maybe there was no underlying basis.

Maybe

39

the fact

was the taxpayer was engaged in bookxnaking activities

was casually overheard in a neighborhood bar, as pointed out
in Spinelli.
QUESTION:

Does that strike you as a gross miscarriage

of justice that a warrant should issue on that basis?
MR. STURMAN:

You see, I don't think that's the

issue.
QUESTION:

Does it strike you ■—

MR.STURMAN;

Are you talking to me personally or as

an advocate?
QUESTION:

I'm talking

well, as an advocate.

I have no right to talk to you personally, I don't think.
MR. STURMAN:
have here.

All right.

Here is what I think we

We have a situation where you have the initial

determination as to whether or not evidence was illegally
obtained.
The next question is if it's illegally obtained,
should it be excluded because of the deterrent effect?
And the final question is we exclude it in criminal
cases, should we exclude it in civil cases?
I think that what we have here is a situation where
no matter what the views of the various Justices are, if the
evidence is illegally obtained in the first place, it's got
to be excluded, assuming a deterrent effect can be found.
And I think that the area of reform, so to speak

and I am

40

now getting back to your question ■— is on whether or not
the evidence was initially illegally obtained in the first
place.

It was clearly illegally obtained under Aguilar.

was clearly illegally obtained under Spinelli.

It

But I cannot

control the eight members of this Court as to whether it is
clearly illegally obtained today.
Thank you very much.
QUESTION:

Did the Suarez case go to any court of

appeals,, go any further?
MR. STURMAN:
QUESTION:

Not to my knowledge, your Honor.

Are there any additional tax court

decisions that follow Suarez?
MR. 5TURMAN:

There are several others.

There is,

of course, this case, and in addition to that —
QUESTION:

This is a district court case.

MR. STURMAN:
QUESTION:

Pardon me?

This did not come from th© tax court,

this case?
MR. STURMAN:

This came from the Federal district

court.
QUESTION:

Court of appeals.

MR. STURMAN:

I'm sorry.

It started in the Federal

district court, your Honor.
QUESTION:

My question is directed to the inquiry

as to whether or not Suarez has been consistently followed in

41
the tax court.
MR. STURMANs
QUESTION;

In the tax court itself?

Yes.

MR. STURMAN;

I don't know that.

I would believe

that it would have to be because I think the full panel of
the tax court had heard that case, so it would be followed in
the tax court.

There are, however, other circuit coi.trts that

have gone along with the contentions advanced by the taxpayer
today and there are numerous other opinions.

There is only

one case, which really creates a conflict, and that’s
Compton v. United States.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you.

Mr. Solicit General, you can plan on resuming at

Mr. Solicitor General,

you may continue.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. BORK;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
I just wish to clarify one point.
The Government thought that a summary judgment had
been entered here because on pages 10a and 11a of our
petition for certiorari we reproduced the district court's
order which enters judgment.

The Government had not -thought

that there was a trial because the record shows only a
discussion of the legal point, and we thought respondent had
not had an opportunity to put in his evidence.
Now, the district court does refer to this on page
9a of our petition for certiorari as a trial, and if respondent
is correct a about this and if w@ should prevail here, then
the proper disposition would be to remand the entry of a
judgment for the United States.
But I think the situation is ambiguous and should
the Government prevail, I think the remand should be for
disposition by the trial court.

Let the trial court decide

whether or not respondent had a chance to put his evidence in.

QUESTION:

Disposition of the tax claims»

Rehnquist.
If there are no questions, I conclude my
presentation, Mr. Chief Justice.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Solicitor General.
Thank you, Mr. Sturman.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 1:03 p.m., the argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded.)
