MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No, 73-2066, the National Independent
Coal Operator’s Association against the Secretary of the
Interior, and the consolidated case# the Secretary of the
Interior against Delta Mining Company,

>

Mr, Kilcullens you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN I, KILCULLEN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL INDEPENDENT
COAL OPERATOR’S ASSOCIATION, ET AL,
MR. KILCULLEN:

Mr, Chief Justice and members of

•the Courts
These consolidated cases present a single legal issue
as to whether the Bureau of Mines of the Department of Interior,
in assessing civil penalties for alleged violations of the
Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act, followed strictly the
procedural requirements spelled out by Congress in -the Act.
The Act directs that the operator of a coal mine in
which a violation occurs shall be assessed a civil penalty
by the Secretary of the Interior in an amount not less than
$10,000 for each violation.
The penalty provisions of the statute are mandatory.
That is, the Secretary must assess a penalty in each instance
where he finds a violation.
In this respect, the Act differs from other occupa-

4
fcional and safety acts, such as OSHA, which give the administra­
tive agency discretion to assess penalties where a fault is
foundo
Here the statute requires, in each case, that a
penalty be assessed regardless of fault.
Because of the mandatory nature of the penalty
provisions of this statute, Congress wrote into the Act certain
procedural safeguards, which must be followed by the Secretary
in assessing these penalties.
The Act expressly provides that a penalty shall be
assessed by -the Secretary only after the mine operator
charged with the violation has had an opportunity for a public
hearing, and the Secretary has determined by decision incorpor­
ating findings of fact that a violation occurred, and the
amount of the penalty which is warranted.
The statute also requires that hearings be subject
to the provisions of -the Administrative Procedure Act.
In determining the amount of the penalty the Secretary
must consider six criteria spelled out in the statutes
The operator’s prior record of violations? the sisse
of his business? whether he was negligent? the gravity of the
violation? his good-faith effort to achieve compliance? and
whether the penalty would affect his ability to continue in
business.
These cases are before the Court because the Secretary

5

has not applied these procedural safeguards.

Instead,. he.has

adopted a summary type of procedure under which he has ■
authorized the Bureau of Mines to issue a proposed order, a
proposed assessment in advance of any hearing or any finding
or determination that a violation occurred.
Unless the mine operator requests formal adjudication
within a certain number of days after he receives such a
proposed order, -the order becomes final by its terms»
The Bureau of Mines assessment officer who issues
these assessment orders

is not a qualified administrative law

judge, nor does ha have authority to hold hearings or to
adjudicate disputed issues*
On deposition, he admitted that he made no effort
to determine whether a violation had in fact occurred, and he
also admitted that in fixing the amount of -the penalty h®
simply followed a pre-set penalty schedule9 which gave no
consideration to the six statutory criteria,.
In the National Independent Coal Operator8s case,
the District Court found that the assessment officer gave no
meaningful consideration to the six statutory criteria for
determining penalties, and that he made no independent determinatxon as to whether 'the charged violation had occurred.
In the Delta Mining group of cases, the District
Court refused enforcement of these penalty assessment orders
on the same grounds

that there had been — they were not based

6
on a genuine determination as to the o'courrence of a violation
or consideration of the statutory criteria for determining the
penalty amount.
Now, the government has argued that the statutory
language requires only that the mine operator b© given an
opportunity for a hearing, and if he does not request a hearing
there is no need for a decision incorporating findings of fact.
In other words, the procedural requirements of the
Act are satisfied simply by advising the operator that he can
request 51 hearing.

The balance of the section which calls for

a determination, the government says, becomes inoperative once
he has been given this opportunity for a hearing.
The District Courts in the cases below rejected this
argument and held that in all cases, before an assessment order
can become final, it must be supported by a decision incorporating
the Secretary's findings that a violation did occur, and the
amount of the penalty which is warranted? and held that the
proceedings leading to the orders sought to b® enforced by
the Secretary did not comply with the requirements of the Act.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Kileullan, isn't your version of what

Congress provided her© rather elaborate by the standards of
normal administrative law, such — if Congress clearly provided
it, certainly that’s the way it ought to be.

But if there’s

ambiguity, isn't there -some question as to whether this isn’t
a rather unusually elaborate proceeding?

?
MR. KILCULLEN;

I don't think sc, Your Honor.

I

think that it simply follows the standard procedure for
adjudicating penalties.

Any penalty to be asserted against

th© citizen, there must be some adjudicative process? and
this is simply what the Congress provided here, that there
must be a determination.
QUESTIONS

Well, he has an opportunity for an

adjudication if he wants on©.
MR. KILCULLENs But the statute says that -the
Secretary must apply these criteria in making a determination
and unless he's done so, the operator's failure to request a
hearing does not validate the —* or does not cure the
Secretary’s failure to comply with the statute.
He has to find that there has been a violation, and,
having found that there's a violation, he must then decide what
the amount; of iris penalty must be.

And in doing so, he has to

take into account ’these six criteria.
The procedure that has been followed her© eliminates
that.

It simply involves issuing a proposed order and advising

the operator that if he doesn't request a hearing, the proposed
order becomes final.
QUESTIONS

And if he requests a proceeding without

more, all the procedure goes in; right?
MR. KILCULLEN;
procedure, and then the —»

Yes, sir.

That initiates th® hearing

QUESTION3 Well, why didn’t you do that?
MR. KILCULLENs

Your question is why did not the

operators request a hearing?
QUESTIONS

Yes, sir.

MR. KILCULLENs

I can’t answer that question- other

than to say ‘that the operators undoubtedly felt that this
procedure — that these orders were not in accordance with the
statutory procedure, -that the orders were not valid orders.
QUESTION?

It wouldn't have cost him anything to send

a note, would it?
MR. KILCULLEN; Well, in every one of these cases -Your Honor, in every one of these cases
QUESTION;
”we want a hearing”.

All you had to do was send a notice that
Isn’t that right?

MR. KILCULLEN;

In every one of these cases, the

operator protested, filed a protest v/ith the» assessment
officer.

And sent in material to establish that the circum­

stances of the violation were such that a penalty, the penalties
assessed should not be
QUESTIONs

Just, like a lawyers’ fight, you just

wanted to try this out.
MR. KILCULLENs
QUESTION;

Sir?

It5s a lawyers’ fight? you just wanted

to try this statute out.

When all you had to do was send in
:

one little piece of paper saying, ”1 request a hearing.”

9

MR. KILCULLEN ?

Well, 1 don’t, know whether you “re

correct in saying it's a lawyers’ fight»

I believe that the

mine operator is entitled to the due process that is set out in
the statute, Your Honor,

And his failure to request a hearing

does not entitle the Secretary to

disregard the statute.

He can’t avoid his responsibility to adjudicate? he’s got to
make a determination.

He can’t assume that a violation occurred,

which he does in these — which the assessment officer does.
He can’t assume the existence of a violation.

He

must find, under the statute ha must find that there was? in
fact, a violation.
And if he finds that, as I say, he ’then has to
determine the amount that’s to be assessed.
QUESTION?

Mr. Kilcullen, are the operators really

claiming that they don't know what these alleged violations
consist of?

Or are they really arguing litigation here?

MR. KILCULLEN?

Litigation, Your Honor?

No, 1 think that they are not

given adequate

notice as to what the nature of the charge is.
Court so found in the National Independent case.

The District
That all they

get is a pro forma printed form, with some blanks filled in,
that says "You have been assessed" or ”We propose to assess a
penalty of" so much money? without any explanation ©f why or
how the penalty was determined.
QUESTION? Well, isn’t that ‘the reason for requesting a

10

hearing, then?
MR. KILCULLEN: Well, the Secretary originally set up
a procedure whereby in each case the matter would be sent to
the Office of Hearings and Appeals, and then

'the Bureau of

Mines had to request, had to file a petition for 'an assessment*
in which they would spoil out the circumstances, all of the
factual background and so on.
In that circumstance, the matter would then go to
an Administrativa Law Judge, who would take testimony and make
findings .
And than a further appeal from that to the Board of
Mina Operations Appeals»
Now, after this procedure was in affect for a year,
the Secretary decided he was going to take a shortcut, and he
then adopted this new summary procedure under which the
assessment office would send out these proposed penalties»
Nov;, the important point, I think, is that the
assessment officer made no adjudication, no attempt to adjudicate»
He didn’t — he admitted that he made no attempt to find
whether a violation had occurred.

He simply took., the notice of

violation that had been issued by the Mine Inspector and, on
the basis of that, he issued the penalties.
Now, the penalties were in large amounts in many
cases, running $5,000 to $10,000.
QUESTION s But the Mine Inspector did make an effort

11
to find out whether a violation had occurred., didn’t he?
MR, KILCULLEN; Wellf he found a situation which he
considered, to he a violation# but that does not prove the
existence of a violation.

There has to be sortie actual proof.

In many of these instances -*« and these cases are
now being heard by Administrative Law Judges — when the
evidence is heard# it’s found that there was not in fact a
violation.

The Mine Inspector misread the situation,
QUESTION; And that sort of a hearing was open to any

of your clients on request?
MR, KILCULLENs

They could go to a hearing? right.

The question is whether the order# which became final without
a hearing# was a valid order.

Because it was not based upon

a determination as to the existence of a violation, or the
application of 'tine statutory criteria,
QUESTION;

Nell# you say it wasn't based upon a

determination of the existence of a violation.

Why# at that

stage of the administrative proceeding# isn't the adjudicating
officer entitled to take the representations c£ the Mine Safety
Inspector?
MR, KILCULLEN; There is no adjudicative officer in
this procedure# Your Honor,
adjudicative officer.

The Secretary dispensed with an

All he has is an assessment officer# who —

QUESTION; Well# call it an — why isn’t the assessment
officer, then# entitled to take a finding of the Mine Safety

12
Inspector?
MR, KILCULLEN;
QUESTION ;

Why is he not entitled to take it?

Yes,

MR, KILCULLEN; Because it's an unproved violation,
and it has to be established by adequate evidence,
QUESTION; Well,, you say it has to be proved twice,
then, in the course of an administrative hearings

first,

at

the preliminary stage and then, if a hearing is requested,
again,
MR, KILCULLEN;
understand,

There is no

no, sir, I don't

I think perhaps I*m not getting across.

The assessment officer just follows a — it's a
ministerial act with him? all ha

does is just — in fact his

staff, his clerical staff, just filled in the blanks on these
forms, these preprinted forms#

And he made no effort to

adjudicate or make any determination of any of these questions.
He just sent out an order and ha said;

Unless you pay this

order or request a hearing, it becomes a final order of the
Secretary#
We contend, Your Honor, 'that the Secretary can't
disregard the statute#

His failure to comply with the

statutory requirements cannot be waived by the person who is
charged with the violation,
QUESTION;

You mean even if the mine operator had,

in writing, expressly purported to dispensa with the need for

13
a hearing, or with findings,
MR. KILCULLEN*

H® could pay

—

pay the penalty

and settle the case at that level if he wished.

But if he did

not wish to pay this penalty , h© filed — in these cases , as
we have indicated — he filed a protest.

He said:

MI think

this is erroneous? it’s wrong."
Now, at that stage he should have ““if the Secretary
wanted to make this penalty a final penalty, h© should have
gona through the adjudicative process.
QUESTION;

Well, did you rest on any constitutional

argument below?
Did you make a constitutional argument?
MR. KILCULLEN';

We did — we did in fact make a

constitutional argument in this case.
QUESTION;

And that was rejected, too, I take it?

MR. KILCULLEN;

No, no, the District Court held in

our favor*,
QUESTIONs The District Court did*
MR. KILCULLEN;

in each case? and the Third

Circuit held in our favor in the on© case.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. KILCULLEN:

Now, the Court of Appeals for the

District of Columbia ■»QUESTION: Did they reject the constitutional argument?
MR. KILCULLEN; They didnrt consider the constitutional

14
argument.

They read the statuta.

They said, We’re going to

go back and try to find out what Congress meant, in this statute,
and they -- we feel they misread completely the statute.
QUESTION*

Are you pressing a constitutional claim

here?
MR, KILCULLEN:

Well, the question of due process of

law, I think, is a proper question here.
QUESTION*

The —•

So your answer is yes, you are pressing

that?
MR. KILCULLEN*
QUESTIONS

Yes ? yes, sir.

Now, you didn’t ask for a post-assessment

hearing, either, I take it.

Couldn’t you have had a de novo

hearing before a jury?
MR. KILCULLEN:

Well, that is a question, the

statute is ambiguous on that point? and, in fact, in the
District Court
QUESTION*

Let's assume you could have.

You didn't

find out whether you could -- anyway, whether you could have
had that kind of a hearing or not?
MR. KILCULLEN;

This would come up in a situation

where the Secretary goes into the District Court for enforcement,
as he did in the Delta Mining case,
QUESTION*

Yes.

MR. KILCULLEN* And the operator then says*

"I think

this order of -«die Secretary is invalid, it wasn’t properly

The government said in the

Delta Mining case, in the pretrial conference, the government

MR. KILCULLENs
It’s in the Appendix.

It says the court, that is, the District Court,
"shall have jurisdiction to enter a judgment enforcing,modifying,
and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in
part the order and decision of the Secretary, or it may remand
the proceedings to the Secretary for such further action as
it may direct*

The court should consider and determine da novo

all relevant issues, except issues of fact which ware or could
have been litigated in review proceedings before a court

under Section 106 of this Act" ~
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

„Mr. Kilcullen, I think

you’re getting into Mr* Blackwell’s time now*
MR* KILCULLEN:

Yes, sir»

Well, the point simply,

Xell just finish up on that point.
The government argued in the pretrial conference
that these issues could have been litigated in an appeals
proceeding under section 106, and therefore the operator was not
entitled to de novo consideration in the trial court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE

BURGER:

Vary well*

Mr. Blackwell,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRED BLACKWELL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF DELTA MIKING, INC., ET AL.
MR. BLACKWELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the Courts
I want, to emphasize that there is no consi&aration
of health or safety of the miners attaching to the issues in

17
this case.

The coal mine inspector issues a notice to abate

a condition which he considers unsafe.

That inspector’s order

must be obeyed within the time he allows for the ,correction,
otherwise the affected part of the nine is closed down.
So there is absolutely no connection between this
case and the safety actions which are taken in the day**to™day
operations in the min®.

The penalty assessment process comas

many months after the condition has bean corrected.
X would also like to emphasize that we’re not asking
this Court to give ug any due process protection beyond that
already spelled out in the statute.

We merely ask that the

Secretary be required to honor the express penalty assessment
procedures that are already there.
We contend that the penalty orders in these cases
are invalid for a number of reasons.

The major one of which

is that the Secretary did not comply with section 109(a)(1)
and (a)(3) of the Act.

The first sentence in each of these

provisions requires that a violation must occur before a
penalty can be assessed.

Violation must occur before a penalty

can be assessed.
However, the testimony of the Secretary’s assessment
officer, Mr. Everett Turner, shows that no proper finding of
b. violation has been made in these cases.

The Turner testimony.

Appendix page 93, shows that the assessment officer looked
solely to the charge in the inspector’s unsworn statement, and

18
assumed, on the basis of that, -that a violation had occurred.
No written finding of violation was put in the
assessment order, and in the Delta and G»M»W® cases no written
finding; that a violation had occurred was issued until long
after the final penalty orders had been issued.
In one instance, the finding of violation come almost
on© year end eight months after the penalty order was issued.
The findings wars never presented to the operators prior to
the Secretary's enforcement action, .and we saw the findings
for the first time when we received the complaint, as attach»
ments — as exhibits attached to the complaint.
Moreover, these findings, when they did come, although
it’s an adjudicatory function to find such a violation, the
findings were made by Mr, Turner, Mr» Everett Turner, who is
the Secretary's assessment officer.

He is not a hearing

officer! he is not a juridical officer.
This penalty process was not under the jurisdiction
of a juridical officer at any time during the process,
QUESTIONS Wasn’t that in part because it’s the
government’s position that^ there was no occasion absent a
request for a hearing?
MR, BLACKWELL!

That’s the government’s ~ the

government’s position is that there is a distinction in 'the
penalty assessment procedure in a hearing and a nonhearing
situation®

That the statute simply does not. contain such a

19
distinction.

In fact,- when the Secretary first implemented

the Coal Act in 1970, his construction of the statute was the
same as our construction here today;,

the penalty assessment

function was placed under the jurisdiction of a hearing officer
from the very beginning.

If he had maintained that procedure

which was in conformity with 'the statute, we wouldn’t have
this problem today.
Now, the fact that a hearing has not been held cannot
by any stretch of the imagination justify a government agencydispensing a sanction, a monetary penalty, issuing -the order
“you pay this", and then, months latar, say "By the way, you
ware guilty of something".

That's why we're fighting.-”

how long would it taken?
MR. BLACKWELL: The hearing in these cases could have

MR. BLACKWELLt
QUESTIONS

When would it have been decided?

Yes.

MR. BLACKWELLs

Well, if the hearing examiner is

not too —
QUESTIONS

You mean to tell me that if you asked for

a hearing you would get one within three days?
MR. BLACKWELLs
QUESTIONS

oh, oh, I thought — excuse me.

I never heard of an administrative

agency doing that in history1
MR. BLACKWELLs

Excuse me, I misunderstood you? I

thought you asked how long the hearing would take if it were
held.
QUESTIONs

No, no.

That's what I meant, when will it

be finished?
MR. BLACKWELLt

Well, the administrative hearing, if

it had been asked, would have — could have been concluded,
I say, within a year after the assessment order.
QUESTION? Which is the same time you have here.
You complained about it took a year.
MR. BLACKWELLs

Yes

Am I right?

no, I'm not complaining about

21
a year,. 1 am pointing out that one of the findings of violation
of a standard in a mine, on which the penalties were based,
was not made until a year and eight months after the penalty
assessment was issued»

'Verdict first; trial afterwards!

I just can't square this with American jurisprudence
by any stretch of the imagination.
QUESTION;

How would you compare this', Hr. Blackwell,

with traffic violations, where the traffic violation is asserted
in the notice and where you can get a trial if you want, but
if you don’t ask for a trial, the penalty is automatic, isn't
it?
MR. BLACKWELLS
correct.

Mr. Chief Justice, yes, that’s

I think it is a grave error to inject the traffic

ticket violation into this case.
No. 1, there are no $10,000 traffic tickets in this
country; and wa have — -these penalties can be up to $10,000.
But, more basically, all of these traffic ticket procedures
are established under a city ordinance, under a State code,
and I believe I’ve seen maybe some by court order.
Those procedures, then, must -- how -they work, must
be measured by the originating authority in the ordinance.
Hera we have a different set of procedures, with its own source
of statutory authority. We must measure these procedures by
its statutory source, and the traffic ticket by its statutory
source

important distinction in my minds

QUESTION:

I understand they’ don’t solve the problem
But for the — do we have any problem in

this case as to the future validity of a set cf regulations?
MR. BLACKWELL:

In this case, those new regulations

are not involved at all, Your Honor.

It’s only the former

regulations„
QUESTION: At least the old regulations -chat, we’re
arguing about have been replaced?
MR, BLACKWELL: They have been replaced.

.And I have

had no reason to study those, to make even a speculative
judgment on their validity or nonvalidity.
QUESTION:

But what's at issue here is past assess­

ments , then?
MR. BLACKWELLs

That’s right.

It was the method in.

which the past assessments were issued under the former
regulation.
/411 I know is —* I'm just not familiar with what’s
going on under the new regulation, except I have information
that the nonhearing situation under the new regulations are

able to deal with these expeditiously, and there's no backup
there.
QUESTION:

operation of ‘these procedures?
MR» BLACKWELLs

Well, I think you have a serious

question of mootness, in any event? and the only tiling that
might save it is the government’s 2,000 cases distributed to
the District Attorneys all over the country that they say they
want to enforce»
QUESTIONi Well, doesn’t that resolve the mootness
issue as to the Third Circuit’s case, though, where there you
did have an effort to enforce these penalties, and the
government seeks to enforce them regardless of the affect of
these new rules?
You don’t contend that's moot, do you?
MR» BLACKWELL;

Ho, no»

No»

As I said, that is

what prevents itt the 2,000 cases prevents ‘the mootness»
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Your time has expired,

Mr. Blackwell.
MR» BLACKWELL s

I may just conclude, gentlemen,

the Third Circuit had all of these arguments before it as well
as the D. C„ Court of Appeals, when it rendered its decision»
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Mr. Randolph.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. RAYMOND RANDOLPH, JR., ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE SECRETARY OF INTERIOR, ET AL»
MR» RANDOLPH:
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justic®, and may it pleas©

25
Mr* Justice Rehnquist, in the D0 C. Circuit case,
they also sought a declaratory judgment, to the extent that
the court might hold that the regulations are invalid*, and
that, in turn, might affect pending cases for enforcement»
The action may not be moot»
In our brief in opposition in the D, C» Circuit cae©
we pointed out only that so long as that decision stands it
really has no effect outside of the Circuit, because of the
fact that there are no mines within the District of Columbia»
And, therefore, it would be proper for this Court only to hear
the Delta Mining case;

but I don't think it’s technically

moot, because of the declaratory judgment aspect of it.
These are the first cases -that have reached the
Court ~~
QUESTIONS

Mr» Randolph, why does the declaratory

judgment aspect change the mootness question?
MR,, RANDOLPHS

Well, :-if the regulations are held

invalid, then the argument ~~ and the argument indeed was in
DoLta Mining — that therefore the penalties assessed under
those regulations are invalid as well.
And if those penalties assessed are invalid, then
enforcement factions can't be sought and must be dismissed;
that would be the argument.

That was the holding in the Delta

Mining case»
QUESTION; Well, was it that the regulation was

26
invalid,, or was it, the construction of what the regulations say?
MR. RANDOLPHs

No, the regulations were held invalid

in the Delta Mining case.
The regulations under which the penalties were
assessed were held invalid„
These are the first cases, obviously, to reach the
Court involving the Federal Coal Mine Health end Safety Act
of 1969«

And 1 might point out to the Court that this Act is

a culmination of federal legislative efforts dealing with coal
mining that dates bade to 1865.
The purpose of the Act was to cure some of the
problems, many of the problems that led to the failure of past
legislation.
The purpose of the Act, as

well, was to protect the

coal miners? the primary purpose, to protect their health and
safety.

Congress recognizing that they were engaged in the

most hazardous occupation within the United States.
Congress found that between I960 and 19S8, under
the past law, that federal insp®ct02?s that had observed 1.3 —
had observed 1.3 million violations of'the Advisory Safety
Code of idle Bureau of Mines.

The major problem —* one of the

major problems that Congress identified, even enforcing the
existing laws — and this is in the Senate Report, right in
the vary beginning of the Report on this bill, — was that
the enforcement procedures didn't work.

Congress ©aid they

27

were too complex, -they were too difficult*

It made it impossible

to secure compliance even with the laws that were on the books
at that time.

And therefor©, Congress abandoned, in this Act,

it abandoned the approach of seeking voluntary compliance.
It imposed 125 specific mandatory standards of health and
safety that coal mine operators must comply with.

And it

imposed penalties for violations of those standards, in. order
to make it no longer profitable for the coal mine operators to
continue operating in violation of the law,- to make it no longer
profitable for them to operate in violation of Health

and

Safety Standards at the expense of the miners.
The issue in this case is one of statutory interpreta­
tion.

I think I will explain later that it goes beyond the

particular regulations that are involved here.
The question specifically is, what does section
109(a)(3) of this Act require when the Secretary assesses a
penalty in the absence of a request for the holding of an
administrative hearing?
More specifically, a written detailed findings of
fact, such as those required under the APA after a hearing,
are those kinds of findings of fact required .fc© be incorporated
in the Secretary's assessment order when 'there has been no
hearing, and when, indeed, the mine operator is entitled to a
trial de novo, in a District Court, on all issues; and a trial
by jury on all factual issues.

28
Arc! let me add, right here at the outset, that the
statement that was

I believe Mr, Kilcullen quoted, of the

attorney in the pretrial proceedings in the Delta Mining case,
about what "de novo" means is not the position of the
government.

The position of the government is that de novo

trial on all issues means an absolute de novo trial on all
issues of fact and laws that the administrative proceedings
become irrelevant, they wash out»
I'd like to put this case in its proper perspective,
by just, outlining for the Court the steps that lead to an
assessment, and finally the steps that lead into the District
Courts,
We begin with the mine inspectors themselves, and
•tineae are people specifically required by the Act, under
section 505,to be experienced peoples in raining.

All the people

appointed by the- Secretary to administer this Act are required
by the statute itself to be experienced mining people.
The mine inspector approaches the mine without any
advance notice.

In fact, the statute specifically prevents him

from giving any notice.

Each mine within the United States

must foe inspected entirely four times a year. There are also
spot inspections, periodically.

For dangerous mines, where

there have been fatalities or serious accidents within the past
five years, there must be a spot check once out of arery five
days by a mine inspector.

29
The union representatives has an absolute right to
accompany the mine inspector when he reaches the mine. The
company official,, I'm fcoldr usually does.*as well.
Let's suppose the mine inspector goes into the mine
shaft and* as in Delta Mining, G.M.&W. and the Hears Company
mines, he finds violations of the Act.
At that point he writes out a detailed notice of
violation — quite analogous, Mr* Chief Justice, to a traffic
ticket — under Section 104(e) of the Act, he's required to set
down precisely what he finds is wrong, what sections of the
Act or the regulations are

.violated.

And then he also sets a time for abatement.

In 'this

case, I notice in the Delta Mining situation, the operator had
on® month to correct that violation.
Now, this is handed, this notice of violation is
required by the statute to be handed right there to the company
official.

But that's not all.

The Act also requires

specifically that the mine inspector post the notice of
violation, saying what was wrong and where in the mine, and
how long it is before .it can be — before it has to be corrected.
He must post that notice on a bulletin board.
And to give you an idea of how

careful Congress was

in. this detailed Act, there's even a section in the Act, 10 7(a),
that requires mine operators to have bulletin boards, so ‘they
wouldn't get into the problem of having no place to post it.

30

The bulletin boards must, be right outside the mine entrance»
Than the mine inspector returns to check to see whether
there's been an abatement, to check to see whether the violation
has in fact been remedied 0
If it hasn't, if there has been no abatement, the mine
inspector can order withdrawal of all people from the area of
tii® violation.

Or he can extend the time for correcting the

violation.
But let’s suppose that the violation has been
abated.

If that’s done, then the notice of violation

and the

abatement notice is sent to the asse*" .ment office of the
Bureau of Mines.
Now, what I’ve just described is happening, I think
we said in our brief, at the rate of 80,000 times a year.
30,000 violations of the Health and Safety Standards of the Act
and regulations.
That was wrong. That figure is not accurate today.
Because the latest figures show that that rate has increased
now to 110,000 violations a year.
Congress could have stopped right there.

It could

have let the Traffic Officer, it could have let the Mina
Inspector write out a fine, serve it on the mine operator,
and says

Either pay it or litigate in District Court.
The APA would not have been applicable at all to 'that

situation.

If the Court will notice, in Section 554(a)(3) of

31
the

APA, it specifically is made inapplicable, the findings of

fact requirement, the hearing requirement, to situations
involving inspections»

And that’s precisely what this is„

It’s also mads inapplicable *»~ the APA hearing require­
ments and finding of fact requirements are totally inapplicable
when there is a trial de novo in a District Court available.
But Congress didn’t stop right there»
another step in the process»
to assess the penalties.

No.

It gave

It required the Secretary himself

And it gave — it thought it advisable

to give the rain® ■'Operators an opportunity for a hearing.
The way that has been operating, the way it operated
under the old regulation, is that the Assessment Officer would,
after getting the notice of violation, the abatement, would
make up a proposed order of assessment, the Assessment Officer
is a man, as 1 said, experienced in mining, and send it to
the mine operator.
It’s not an order to pay, he can’t bs required to pay?
it just says that "You have 15 days to protest this."
In the Delta Mining- case, the addendum at page 2 8
of our brief, shows that there was a protest.
basis that we didn't violate the Act.

It wasn't on 'the

It wasn’t -- there was

no allegation in the protest that we haven't violated the
Act, it was that the -*■ this is a new mine, people have to be
trained? we showed good faith In trying to abate, and so on and
so forth..

32
But let's assume in the usual case -that the operator
does protest»

If he does not protest, the proposed assessment,

order, then the order becomes the final order of the Secretary»
Me can request, a hearing at this point, but let's
assume he doesn't»
The Assessment Officer takes the protest from the mine
operator, reconsiders, and let's assume he re-issues the
assessment order»
The mine operator again has the opportunity to request
a hearing»

And I might add that if he does request a hearing,

the hearing- itself is de novo»

Nothing that went on before is

considered to be bearing one way or another on whether there's
a violation»
And if he loses the hearing, I might add, he has the
opportunity to appeal within the administrative process to the
Board of Mine Operations Appeal»
But let’s assume he doesn't request a hearing,
because that's the situation in this case»
If he doesn't request a hearing, then the order,
the proposed order of assessment becomes the final order ef
the Secretary»

Now, that sets forth the amount of 'the fine,

it sets forth the regulations violated, it sets forth the days
on which tiie notices of violation were issued, and so on and
so fortii„
I might add, also, that this isn’t all»

This isn't

33
the mine operator's only opportunity to find out what he's been
charged with and why he8a been assessed a certain penalty,.
In fact, under the old regulations, one of the most normal
occurrences was that conferences were held, informal conferences0
It may be as little as simply the picking up of a telephone and
calling the Assessment Officer and asking hints

"Why the penalty

you asgiS;§sed against me was $25 instead of $50?”
QUESTIONS

Are you going to deal with the conjunctive

language in. section 109(a)(3), which seems to cut against your
point?
MR» RANDOLPHs

Yes»

If you please, I'll do it now*

I'd like to just finish up this summary»
As a matter of fact, the GAO report that surveyed
the operations of the Assessment Office pointed out that for
three Assessment Officers, 35 percent, of their time was spent
in informal conferences»
Now, even after all this, the Secretary cannot
collect a cent from the mine operators»
thing»

He can't collect any­

I can't force the mine operator to pay»
He must go to the District Court, where the trial is

de novo on all relevant issues, and regarding issues of fact,
the mine operators can request a jury trial»

I notice that

Delta Mining and G.M«W. infact did requrest a jury trial .in
this case.
What this means is simply this;

34
That after ali these administrative proceedings ,
regardless of what went on during those administrative proceed­
ings, as soon as the mine operator does not pay, "they are all
transformed into nothing more than a charge, an allegation, a
complaint in a civil case» The administrative proceedings are
not facts, they are simply allegations to he proved like any
other case in a District Court»
Now, the claim here is that the mine operator who
never requested an administrative hearing can defend a de novo
trial and enforcement action on the basis that the Secretary
did not make adequate findings of fc.ct,

The relevant statute,

109(a)(3) scarcely compels such a result on its language»
It's always difficult to argue orally about whether
a statute is plain on its face or it's not plain.

The very fact

that Judge MacKinnon, Chief Judge Bazelon, Judge McGowan —
and, incidentally, 1 might add, the GAO itself in its report
thought that the statute did not require written findings of
fact when no heaj*ing had been held, is at least some evidence
that reasonable men differ on whether this statute means one
thing or another.
Our reading is that idle findings of fact are necessary
as to a violation and as to a penalty only after the min®
operator has taken advantage of his opportunity for an APA
type hearing.
The Secretary, himself, has always read the

35
statute this way»

There have been a number of Statements in

the argument that said that originally the Secretary read the
statute the other way, and required findings of fact with
regard to every order»

That is not so.

The original regulations which were issued, I might
add, Saturday, March 28, 1970, were enjoined, incidentally, in
a case called Ratliff v» Hickel in the Western District of
Virginia, in a suit by the mine operators? so that these
regulations did not go into effect — I don’t think a single
penalty was assessed under them»

But these original regulations,

which are contained in 35 Federal Register 5256, said only that
the hearing examiner has to determine the amount of' the penalty
which is warranted, and incorporate in his decision the
violation of an order that the penalty be paid.
The only time findings of fact were required under
those regulations is after a hearing, which is precisely the
point wo5re making her©»
Nov;, back to the statutory language itself»
I think the reading that we propose, Mr» Justice
Rehnquist, certainly is within the meaning of the — reasonably
within the wording, so that the language can bear that meaning»
f

Whether it’s conclusive or not conclusive, on the fac@ of
this statute, I think is really beside the point»
QUESTION;

Mr. Randolph, could I interrupt you here»

As I recall, Judge Adams, in the Third Circuit opinion,

35

argued that the APA itself requires findings where there is
a hearingo

And, therefore, that under the Secretary's inter­

pretation of -these statutes, section 109 adds nothing.
Do you have an answer to that one?
MRa RANDOLPH?

Well, I have a copule of answers to

that, Mra Justice Blackmun.
First of all, I -think it's the wrong question.

The

question should have been, when you look at this statute109(a) (3), notice that the APA is invoked right at -axe bottom?
it5s the last sentence.
The question should have been:

Why, after requiring

findings of fact and a decision in a hearing, did Congress
.invoke the APA in the last part of the section?
The answer to that, if that question had been asked
-- and, incidentally, it wasn't, by the court — -trie answer to
that is quite clears

that Congress wanted to bring in to bear

on the hearing all of the detailed requirements about what we
mean by a hearing examiner, when the hearing has to be held,
notice, and no on, -that would be swept in by a reference to
the APA.
It had to refer specifically to -the APA to accomplish
that, for two reasons:

First of all — and I don't think this

was mentioned in our brief — section 507 of the Act, this
Act, the Coal Mine Act, specifically says that the APA is
inapplicable, ‘this entire Act, unless it's expressly so provided.

Bo Congress had to invoke the APA for that reason,
NO. i.
And, No. 2, the APA would not have appliad her©, in
this case, otherwise, because of the trial do novo in the
District Court, which would make the APA inapplicable,,
And I might add the. really remarkable thing about
this statute is that the mine operators are even given an
opportunity for a hearing.
this statute.

That's the remarkable thing about

That cuts against the grain of jurisprudence,

because in de novo, trial d® novo situations, hearings are
not required.
Mow, getting back to the particular language, w®
think that this language is illuminated by the legislative
his tori' that bears on it.

‘Phis is not a detailed ~ what I

am about to tell the Court is not a detailed analysis of
reports and a snippet of a hearing, and maybe a line from
another report, and so on and so forth, this ia, I think,
probably the most solid legislative history that one can have.
Because I rely on the House provision, and what that said,
and the Senate bill, and what that said, and what happened
when they were put together and emerged from conference.
And I think this will explain why that conjunction
is there.
These two provisions, the House bill and -the Senate
bill, the predecessors of section 109(a)(3) are set out in our

38
brief on pages 24 to 25,
One thing is absolutely clear

from both these bills»

And that is 'that no findings of fact were required, except in
regard to a hearing, after a hearing was held.
The Senate bill could hardly be more explicit on this
point.

The original Senate bill from which this statute is

derived said that the mine operator, 25 — 18m sorry, page 24
to 25 of our brief.
QUESTION!

Of your Delta brief?

MR. RANDOLPHs

Yes.

The other brief didn't go that

high, I don’t believe.
Now, the Senate bill, which is on page 25, originally
said that the — "An order assessing a civil penalty ... shall
be issued by the Secretary" et cetera, et cetera,"only after
the mine operator has been given an opportunity for a hearing,
and the Secretary has determined by decision incorporating
findings of fact based on the record of such hearing."
Now, -that language is absolutely clear, that the
only time findings of fact were required was when there was a
hearing, which is our point.
The House bill, I think, was just as clear.
The Conference Committee took those bills, the House
bill and the Senate bill, and what they did to that language
that I just

quoted, on. page 25, is that instead of saying

"incorporating findings of fact based on the record of such

39
hearing”# they took out "based on the record of such hearing”
and added instead "therein”.
There’s not a word in the Conference Report that they
were intending to change the meaning of this provision by doing
that5, by trying to streamline the language.

We don’t think

they did.
As a matter of fact# since the Senate and House bills
were in agreement on this point# — 1 think we mentioned this
in -fche brief — Conference Committees are appointed to resolve
differences between the houses.

They're to compromise.

Here there was no difference.

The two bills were

the same, they were put together — the mine operators argue
that something new came out.
If that were true# then the Conference Committee had
exceeded its authority# and a point of order would have been
put on the Floor# and that would have defeated this entire
legislation.
Wa find that incredible to believe# since the legis­
lative history is perfectly plain,
f

Now, — and that's why the Conjunction is in there#
Mr, Justice Rehnquist# because it’s’derived from .this particular
provision on page 25,
Now# the mine operator’s only point# really — and I
don’t think tfv-tf stressed this in their argument# but since it’s
“■

-

'

.

..

" '“ief I’ll deal with it- — for requiring findings of fact

40
is, in cases where there's no hearing, is simply this:

If the

mine operators had these findings of fact, they’d be more apt
to pay»

And that would relieve -die courts of some of the burden

of enforcement suits»
Let me respond to that»
There's three points that I -chink are against it.
No, 1, Congress never considered it, Congress never considered
whether the administrative bur-den entailed by that kind of a
process, as outweighed by the alleged benefits that the min©
operators cite.
Mo, 2, the underlying assumption that the mine
operators will tend to pay more lacks any support whatever»
There's no evidentiary support for that„

And if the idea is

that the mine operators need more information, because if they
only knew what they were being charged with and why they were
being penalised they would pay, the fact is -they could have
gotten that information, indeed in many cases did, if not
by talking to the Mine Inspector, calling up the hearing
officer, seeking an informal conference, they had that
opportunity»
And yet, still, we have, under -these old regulations,
more than 18,000 violations that have not been paid yet.
The third point, and I think this is probably the
most significant, is as to the burden on the courts, I think •—>
vvfe thin* —** personally, that the burden might well increase if

41
you accept -die mine operators’ arguments®
it mean?

Because what does

It means that the mines operators are then given one

more opportunity to contest in a de novo enforcement action to
«argue that the whole action should ba dismissed, not because
they didn’t violate teha Act, not because the penalty is too
high, but because the findings of fact were not adequate®
Not sufficient under administrative law.
Professor Davis, in his Administrative Law Treatise,
says, ,...at section 1601, that the amount of litigation involved
where the adequacy of administrativa findings is nothing
short of tremendous.

If that is what this results in, if a

holding for the mine operators results in that, it means that
every enforcement action will be met at the outset with the
contest over whether the findings of fact were detailed enough,
were sufficient enough, and so on and so forth.
And that, X think Mr. Blackwell used the argument
of Alice in Wonderland, that is Alice in Wonderland like.
Why?

Because the only importance of those

administrative proceedings is merely that they are a charge,
they are simply a claim.

They wash out, as soon as the

enforcement action is brought. They are irrelevant.
QUESTIONi

You mean brought in court?

MR. RANDOLPHS

Yes,

QUESTIONs Well, but it’s certainly not unknown to
administrative law, even where you have a trial da novo to

42

require some sort of procedural safeguards in the administrative
proceeding„ and some sort of an administrative record.
MR. RANDOLPHS

I think that if — in light of the

system that's now set up, that there:; are administrative safeguards.

Indeed, there are more than enough administrative

safeguards for the mine operators.

They have a right to «■—

QUESTION; But that isn't the argument you were making
a minute ago. A minute ago you were saying it doesn’t make any
difference whether there are or not, because the whole thing
washes out when an enforcement action is brought.
MR. RANDOLPH;

I said it doesn’t make any difference

whether the findings of fact ware adequate enough, detailed
enough, because --die court, in an enforcement action, can’t
rely upon them, anyway.
They are irrelevant to whether the — and the jury is
the one that determines .the facts. Mr. Blackwell, indeed,
requested a jury.
So what is the —» the jury is not going to consider
whether the administrator’s findings of fact were sufficient or
not.

They are just irrelevant to that consideration.
Now, I think this is whsre the Third Circuit want

wrong in the Delta Mining case.

If you read the opinion by

that Court, there’s not a word in the entire opinion — the
words Mde novo" don’t appear within the entire opinion.

I

don’t know whether the Court mistakenly thought that this was

43
the kind of case where the administrative action is reviewed
on the basis of sufficiency of the evidence, but I would point
out that there are two things that ” think this Court can
see the error that the Court of Appeals fell into in the Delta
Mining case«
One of the main reasons, on page 11a of the —* our
petition, I'll read it to the lourt.
Delta.Mining, said:

The Court of Appeals, in

Judicial review of a final administrative

determination is heralded as a right, and such review is
rendered practically impossible, or at least vastly 'more
difficult where the agency’s decision is not accompanied by
express findings.
That goes precisely to the point that I was just
discussing,,

It's not rendered more difficult, because there

is no review of the agency's findings»

This is a de novo

trial, the agency's findings are transformed merely into a
charge that has to be proven»
So I think that's wrong»
On page 12a, 'the Court, said finally?

Though it might

not be beyond Congress' power to provide for the entry by the
Secretary of penalty assessment, orders without findings of
fact, such a provision would run against the grain of much of
our administrative jurisprudence.
I submit that it’s just the other way around.
Requiring findings of fact when there's been no administrative

44
hearing runs directly against the grain of our administrative
jurisprudence,, because the APA, which is a reflection or that
tradition,, says specifically that, No. 1, hearings are not
required? No, 2, findings of fact are not required, when there
is an opportunity for de novo review of all the issues in
a District Court proceeding.
That's precisely what this statute provides.
