HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We'll hear arguments next,

in 74-1435, Environmental Protection Agency against State Water
Resources Control Board, California and Washington.
Mr. Friedman, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ„,
OTJ BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court s
This case, which is here on a writ of certiorari to
the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, presents the same
issue as the last case with respect to the need of federal
instrumentalities to obtain STate permits, except it arises undei
the- 19 72 amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.
The operative language is the same except for the
addition of six words that I will come to later.
Section 313 of the Water Act, like Section 119 of
the Air Act, requires that federal instrumentalities comply with
State requirements respecting control and abatement of pollution
to the same extent that, any person is subject to such require­
ments .
Because of some differences between the statutes,
however, I would like briefly to outline to the Court the
regulatory scheme under the Water Act.
Prior to 1972, the federal program for the control of

4
water pollution was based mainly upon the development by the
States of what are called Water Quality Standards.

That is,

a general standard as to the level of pollutants that, would be
permissible within water.

And the federal enforcement role was

rathe r 1imited.
The 1972 amendments marked a dramatic shift in the
emphasis and the method by which water pollution was to be
controlled.

Instead of stressing primarily the quality of the

water generally, the Act decided to deal with what is called
"point source" pollution, the specific individual, the specific
firm that is polluting.

And the focus was on what are called

technology based limitations; that is, trying to devise the
best technology possible in order to reduce the pollutants
that each particular point source makes.
And this particular technique, the control of the
point source pollutants, was to be accomplished through a
permit system.

So that this case is unlike the other case

in that in the other case there was no reference at all to
anything about permits? in this case there’s an explicit
scheme for permits.
How, what the statute does is it requires that, the
Environmental Protection Agency develop nationwide standards,
standards for effluent limitations, for point source pollutants
in various industries.

It’s on an industry-by-industry basis.

For example, they might have a standard for a cement plant?

5
the cement plant can't discharge more than a certain amount
of phosphate for each hundred tons of cement produced.
that kind of -thing.

It's

To determine the maximum permissible

pollutants from each particular source.
And it’s made illegal under Section 301 of the Act
for any person to discharge pollutants into any navigable
waters except in compliance with the effluent limitations that
the federal agency has developed for the particular sources,
except in compliance with the General Water Quality Standards
that the federal government and the States have developed, and
except in compliance with the permit provisions of Section
402, which has created something called the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System.
And under that system, EPA has undertaken to issue,
is required to issue permits to individual dischargers as long
as those dischargers meet the standards it has provided for
e f f1uent dis ch arges.
And to date it hsis issued more than 30,000 of these
permits.

That's the federal agency has issued more than

30,000 of these permits.
The Act further provides, however, that a State may
itself submit a plan under which it will issue permits, and
if the State’s permit plan meets a large variety of specified
conditions in the statute, as well as meeting the general
standards- then the Administrator of the EPA is directed to

6

approve it.

And once he approves it, that:, under the statute,

automatically terminates his authority to continue to issue
permits.
And thus far the Administrator of EPA has approved
27 different State plans for State issuance of permits.
The EP7\ has issued rather detailed regulations
governing the State permit plan.

And one of those regulations,

which is at issue in this case, is that plans that he approves
for State permit programs do not cover agencies and instru­
mentalities of the federal government.
This case arose out of these facts.

The States of

California and Washington submitted to the EPA their plans
for a program permit.

EPA approved those plans, but indicated

in each instance that the plan did not cover permits for
federal facilities, and that the Administrator would therefore
continue to issue permits for federal facilities.
In accordance with the provisions of the statute,
the States Wien took this ruling to the Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit, which held that under the statute the
Administrator has no authority to deny the States the right
to issue permits for federal facilities.
The arguments that I have just made under the Clean
Air Act are, we think, equally applicable to this statute.
Section 313 obviously was modeled upon Section 113.

The

legislative history of this section, like that of Section 113,

7
again reflects repeated emphasis that what the federal
authorities are to comply with are the State emission standards,
the State —- the substantive things, the effluent limitations,
s ame req uirenents.
There's nothing in this history, like that under the
Clean Air Act, that indicates Congress was intending to require
federal facilities to obtain State permits.
Now, there is one distinction between the language
of Section 313 and the language of 118, which both the Court of
Appeals and the States of California and Washington argue
calls for a different result.

This is a provision which,

where after the statute says that they shall comply with State
and federal requirements to the

same extent as any other

person, it then adds the phrase, ‘'including the payment of
reasonable service charges."
QUESTION:

I don't

did you say that they think,

this, that language leads to a different result in this case
or, rather, that it just makes it a stronger case than
Kentucky had.
HR. FRIEDMAN:

Makes it a stronger case.

There is

a suggestion ~~ there is a suggestion —*
QUESTION:

A stronger case than Kentucky's case?

MR. FRIEDMAN;
QUESTION:

Than Kentucky's case.

Is their claim.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

There's also the suggestion that if

8

the Court were to agree

with us in the Kentucky case, it could

go the other way in this case0
The argument is made that the —
QUESTION:

I thought vice versa — well, yes, if

the Court could agree with — we should agree with you in the
Kentucky case a
MR. FRIEDMAN;

If they hold that there's no authority

to apply permits under the Clean Air Act.
Now, the argument is that the words "including the
payment of .reasonable service charges” refers to charges that
the State might impose for issuing permits, and that since a
permit might be viewed in the nature of a tax. Congress
inserted this provision in order to make it clear that the
federal facilities could pay for -the State permits.
We think, to the contrary, -that what this refers to
is to make it clear that the federal facilities will have to
comply with any State requirements relating to the treatment
of waste material.

In this statute there are a number of

provisions which provide for vast federal funding and research
into the development of adequate local waste treatment
facilities.
And the charges for those facilities are, naturally,
extensive.

And we think that what Congress intended in this

provision was that if a State should conclude as part of its
plan that waste material “would have to be processed through a

9

local treatment facility., that the federal instrumentalities
would have to comply with that, and they would have to pay
reasonable charges therefor? not any charges the State saw
fit to impose., but reasonable charges.
I an told that the fees for permits are relatively
modest.

An average permit fee may sometimes be $25 or $50.

The State of Washington, which is a respondent here, makes no
charge for permit fees.

And it seems most unlikely that

Congress was concerned about that.
Much more probable, in the light of this whole
statute, it seems to us, is that Congress wanted to make it
clear that in complying with the federal standards —- I3m
sorry, in complying with the State standards, federal facilities
would, if the State required compliance in going through the
local waste treatment plants, would have to do that.
Now, here again, under this! statute, as under the
Clean Air Act, there are a number of provisions within the
statute itself which we think are inconsistent with the view
that Congress intended to require the federal facilities to
get the State permits, which, one® again, as I just want to
repeat it, requiring them to get the State permit means the
State can tell them how to operate.
For example, there are several provisions which
authorize the States to adopt certain procedures and certain
standards, except with respect to point sources of pollution

10

owned or operated by the United Statesc

One example is

Section 308, which provides and requires that permits, to be
approvable, must have detailed provisions governing
monitoring, inspection, and entry onto plants *

Obviously

designed to insure that there is compliance with the sub­
stantive standards contained in the permits.
The statute, however, explicitly provides that the
State standards are not applicable to government facilities.
Now, once again, it seems rather unlikely to us 'that
if Congress intended to give the States the authority to
require federal facilities to obtain permits, and then turned
around and said to the States? "You've got to have in your
plans adequate provisions for monitoring and inspection, to
make sure that your permit holders are complying with these
standards", it, at the same time, would have said, "But you
can't do this with respect, to federal facilities."
It's all part of the same thing.

If the inspection

and monitoring is that important for compliance, and if the
federal facilities were intended to have to get State permits,
it seems clear to us Congress would have said, "And the
federal facilities also are subject to these inspection
requirements"

but. Congress did not.

There's a similar thing with respect to so-called
new sources of pollution.

And the statute is explicit ’that

the United States must meet the new sources.

11

Once again, the Environmental Protection Agency may
authorize the States to apply and enforce their own standards
of performance for new sources, if they equal the federal
standards, except for new sources owned or operated by the
United States.
Here, too, we think it most unlikely that if Congress
had intended to require and authorize the States to issue
permits for federal facilities, it would have denied the
States the authority to enforce those permits against federal
facilities where the very standards sought to be enforced are
those contained in the permits.
We have set forth in our brief a number of other
examples and instances in which the whole .statutory scheme,
the use of the language, the way it's structured, the various
provisions seem to us inconsistent with 'the notion that when
it used these general words "to comply with the requirements"
respecting pollution of State, federal and local sources, that
Congress intended thereby to give the States, in effect, what
amounts to a veto power over the operation of federal
facilities, usually on federal land, within the State, unless
the State decidas that it wishes to authorize the federal
facility so to operate.
Once again, as in the Clean Air Act, we think some­
thing much more explicit and specific is required than what
we have in either this language or in this legislative history,

12

which t I reiterate, again indicates that what Congress was
concerned about was the effluent limitations and not the
procedures that the State might devise in order to achieve
compliance with those requirements by the private firms and
people within the State.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well, Mr. Friedman.

Mr. Walston.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RODERICK WALSTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT, STATE OF CALIFORNIA
MR. WALSTON;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
The Solicitor General argues in this case that this
case is very similar to the Kentucky case.

However, in one

fundamental respect, our case is very different from the
Kentucky case, and that is that our case has a specific permit
provision in Section 402 of the Water Act that’s applicable
to all dischargers.
Thus, there is express authority in -the Water Act
for States and the Administrator, himself, to issue permits
to dischargers.

And that authority is found in Section 402

of the Water Act.
Thus, the only issue in the Court is whether -the
States have authority to apply these permits to federal dis­
chargers

13

So there is a fundamental difference between this
case and the Kentucky case in that respect.
Now,,

the Administrator argues that Section 313»

which imposes an obligation on federal dischargers to comply
with all the requirements under the Act, does not include
permits under Section 402.
Now, that result would lead to a very illogical
result, especially as applied to the Administrator's case.
For the Administrator concedes that federal dischargers have
to comply with permits which he, the Administrator himself,
issues in States where he operates his own NPDES permit
program.
Well,, what is the source of that obligation?

Where

does the Administrator himself get authority to issue permits
to federal dischargers?
That authority has to be found in Section 313 of the
Water Act, because that’s the only provision in 'the Water Act
f

that defines the obligation of federal dischargers under the
Act.

And that section specifically provides that federal

dischargers must comply with both State requirements and
federal requirements.
Therefore, the word 31 requirements’3 in 313 must
include Section 402 permits, or otherwise the Administrator,
himself, would lack authority to issue permits to federal
dischargers.

14

And under that result, of course, federal dischargers
would be entirely exempt from the 402 permit provisions of the
Act,

And the Administrator himself, in this case, has conceded

that that is not the result to be implied; that Congress indeed
intended for federal dischargers to comply with the 40 2 permit
program*
Thus, the Administrator's position results in a very
difficult dilemma, which the Administrator has yet failed to
address in this case*

Either the word "requirements” includes

Section 402 permits or it does not.
include permits issued by the States.

And if it does, it must
And if it does not, the

Administrator, himself, lacks authority to issue permits to
federal dischargers.
Now, the Court asked a number of questions in the

Kentucky case that I think are partially applicable, at least
to the issues in this case.
First, Justices Burger, Marshall and Blackmun asked
the question of why does the State have authority or need
authority to issue permits to federal dischargers.
Well, the answer in our case is that the permit
process itself is the very process by which an effluent limita­
tion is developed with respect to a federal discharger.

The

permit process is the process which enables the State to get
the necessary information it needs to define the effluent
limitation to be imposed on the discharger himself.

15

There’s a number of questions that have to be asked
of these dischargers , and we have to get answers from them.
For instancef what are the —
QUESTIONS

Well, they are willing to give you the

answers.
MR* WALSTON:
QUESTIONS

Pardon me?
They’re willing to give you the answers,

they’re willing to supply the information.
MR. WALSTON:

Well, they’re not willing to supply

the information that the State necessarily requests.

For

instance, California has an administrative procedural process
which requires all dischargers to come to the State to undergo
cross-examination, to offer documentary data, and so forth.
That, I suppose, would be classified ais a procedural require­
ment under the Administrator’s view.
QUESTION:

But you say the federal facilities in

California have been unwilling to comply with, or substantially
comply with those procedures?
MR. WALSTON:

As a practical matter, they haven’t.

As a practical matter, the federal dischargers in California
have historically complied with State administrative procedural
requirements.

They’ve gone to the State of California and

they’ve got permits from the State of California.”"
Thus, the administrative practice in California is
somewhat inconsistent with the position, the theoretical

16

position being advanced by the Solicitor General in this case.
QUESTIONS

Well, as a practical matter, then, has

California up to now been able to get the kind of information
you say that it’s essential for it to get in order to evolve
the effluent limitations?
MR. WALSTON s

Yes 0

And the reason for that is that

the federal dischargers in California have in fact complied
with the procedural requirements of California.
Obviously, if they weren’t required to so comply,
as the Solicitor General says they need not comply, then
California couldn’t get the information that it has historically
obtained through the administrative permit process.
There is a second answer to the argument which was —
or the question which was posed by the various Justices, and

that is this:

The Administrator, himself, can't, .issue permits

to federal dischargers once he approves a State program, by
virtue of Section 402(c) of the Water Act.
That provision requires idle Administrator to
suspend his permit-issuing authority in the entire State,
after he approves a State program.
Thus, if tlie Administrator himself can’t issue these
permits, then nobyd can, according to the Solicitor General’s
position in this case.
QUESTION: Well, do you agree that the well-established
doctrine is that when the federal government surrenders its

17
immunity , it can be accomplished only by very clear and express
s tatemants ?
MRa WALSTON:

I think that’s probably a correct

statement of law, Your Honor»

But I don’t think the question

is really applicable here.
Section 313 of the Water Act constitutes a clear
waiver of federal immunity from State regulation„

It

specifically provides that federal dischargers have to comply
with State and local requirements.

And, as a matter of fact,

the Solicitor General concedes that this language obligates
federal dischargers to comply with State effluent limitations»
So there’s been a waiver of sovereign immunity, or
federal immunity in. this case»

All we’re really talking about

is the extent or the scope of the waiver.
As I say, it seems to me implicit in the concept
that the State has the authority to issue effluent limitations
to assnine therefrom that the State has the authority to issue
the permit which contains those limitations»

There’s an

integral —
QUESTION:

But the federal government doesn’t have

to follow it.
MR. WALSTON:
QUESTION:

Pardon me?

There’s nothing that says the federal

government has to follow it»
MR. WALSTON:

Section 313 —

18

QUESTION;

I understand the Solicitor General’s

point is that if you want to subject the federal government to
permits, you have to say it.
MR. WALSTONs Well, we think that Congress said that
in Section 313.
QUESTION;

In haec verba, practically.

MR. WALSTON;
QUESTION;

Pardon me?
In haec verba, practically.

MR. WALSTON;

Yes, we think that Congress spelled

that out in Section 313.
QUESTION:

Congress said

It didn't, say "permits'5.

MR. WALSTON; Well, it must have included permits,
because this is the only

Section 313 is the only authority

that the Administrator himself has to issue permits to federal
dischargers.
QUESTION:

Well, I don't know whether, in this —

in this delicate field, I don't know whether you have to give
up a certain point.
As I understand the government's point, they're
willing to go along with everything but this permit business.
I

MR. WALSTON;

Yes, and we feel that -that would make

it very difficult for the State to actually develop the —
QUESTION;
do it?

Would it be impossible for the State to

Would just make it difficult.
MR. WALSTON;

I don't think so.

I don't --

19

QUESTION; Would just make it difficult»
MR» WALSTON;

I don’t think that it would be possible

for a State to develop an effective meaningful limitation,,
effluent limitation, unless it somehow had the authority to
engage the —
QUESTION;

But a minute ago you said it would be

' more difficult.
You retract that now?
MR. WALSTON; Well, I suppose it wouldn't be
impossible

I suppose that’s true. But it certainly would

be very difficult.
QUESTION;

Of course it would.

MR. WALSTON:

Of course, the State could shoot in

the dark.
QUESTION:

You just want the federal government to

say, "We are bound by you, the State".
MR. WALSTON;

Yes.

I suppose that’s true.

In other words t the State could —
QUESTION: And the next step is by permit.
MR. WALSTON:

Yes.

But it would be pretty diffi­

cult —
QUESTION:
MR. WALSTON;

But you wouldn't settle for less?
Pardon me?

QUESTION: And you wouldn’t settle for less?
MR. WALSTON:

We don’t think

we won’t, settle for

20
less , because we don't think Congress settled for less0

We

don't see a distinction between the permit process and the
effluent limitation that's contained in the permit.
I suppose,, in answer to your question, Justice
Marshall, that the State could certainly shoot in the dark.
It could throw out some effluent limitations based on very
poor data, that the federal discharger himself might
voluntarily submit.

Rut we wouldn’t have any assurance -that

that’s a very meaningful effluent limitation.
We can't do that.

We can’t form an effective

meaningful limitation unless we’ve got the federal discharger
in there to find out, for example, how long it's going to take
him to solve his water pollution problems.

In other words,

what kind of schedule of compliance, for example, has to be
built into the federal permit.
QUESTION;

Wien must it —

Well, what you’re suggesting, Mr. Walston,

is that the State’s substantive regulations don’t simply exist
as a body of common law that can be plucked out and applied to
a particular individual by the EPA, but, rather, that they are
developed in the permit, application procedure almost on a
case-by-case basis.
MR. WALSTON;

That's precisely correct, and that's

the whole concept, Justice Relinquish, of the permit system in
the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.
The permit, system enables the States or the Admin-

21
isfcrator, as the case may he, to develop effluent limitations
that are applicable on a case-by-case basis, permit-by-permit
basis to each individual discharger.

And 'the State can't

develop a broad effluent limitation that is broadly applicable
to everybody, it has to develop a limitation by looking at the
exigencies of the specific, particular discharge.

And the

Solicitor General's opinion — or position, would not allow
the States to do that.
Next,. Justice Powell asked the question of whether
the States could prevent federal dischargers actually from
operating.

Could the State, for instance, shut down Fort Knox?
Well, there's two answers to that.
First of all, Section. 313 of the Water Act specific­

ally authorises the President to exempt a federal effluant
source, if he deems that exemption to be in the paramount
interest of the United States.
Thus, the President could simply say, "You can't
shut down Fort Knox,51 to the State of Kentucky, "simply because
I exempt Fort Knox.”
QUESTIONs

Well, does the permit — the procedural

aspect really have anything to do with the power, the ultimate
power to shut down or not shut down?
MR. WALSTON:

I suppose, hypothetically, that if a

State refused to issue a permit, the discharger -then couldn’t
operate.

I suppose that’s true.

As a practical matter, the

22
States don’t do that.

They issue the permit and then impose

the effluent limitations in the permit itself»
So the effluent limitations are the conditions which
the discharger must meet»
response to that question.

And this leads into the second
And I think Justice Rehnquist

appreciated this response.
We get. the same result, even under the Administrator’s
view of this case.

For he concedes that federal dischargers

have to comply with State effluent limitations»
Well , it's the effluent limitation that defines the
specific nature of the obligation on the federal discharger.
The permit itself is little more than a certification that the
discharger is complying with those limitations.
But it's the effluent limitation that tells the
discharger what steps he must taka to correct water pollution,
to stop polluting the water, and when he must take these steps.
And so, hypothetically, I suppose a State could
develop such astringent effluent limitations, Justice Powell,
that the practical effect would be to shut down the federal
facility.
QUESTION;

And the Administrator concedes that

MR. WALSTON;

by that.

The State says that?

Yes.

The federal government has got to abide

Right?
MR. WALSTON;

Unh-hunh.

QUESTION; Well, now, suppose the State says, "You
can’t discharge more than one point blank” — the same figure
— "and also get a permit."
MR. WALSTON:
QUESTION;

Yes.

What’s the benefit of the permit?

MR. WALSTON;

The permit enables the State to make

that determination about, the one point one figure that the
fedarctl discharger has to live with.

If the State can’t issue

the permit and engage in the administrative process that leads
to the issuance of the permit, it may not know whether the
one point one figure is correct, or whether a one point two
figure would be correct, or whether the figure should be five
or three or two, or whatever.
QUESTION; Well, once the federal government says,
"Well, you go ahead and tell me how much I can do"? right?
MR. WALSTON;
QUESTION;

Unh-hunh.

Is that okay?

Without a permit?

MR. WALSTONX
QUESTION;

Unh-hunh.
"You tell us how much we can discharge,

and we'll abide by it? but we won’t apply for a permit."
MR. WALSTON; Well, certainly, the federal government,
in that case, the federal discharger has to comply and live
with that particular limitation.
QUESTION;

I said they said that.

MR. WALSTON;

Yeah, they agree with that.

QUESTION; Would they still have to get a permit?
MR. WALSTON;
QUESTION;

Why?

Yes, under Section. 313 —

Well, Section 313 of the Water Act

Section 313 requires federal dischargers to

comply with State requirements respecting control and abatement
of pollution.

And if we don’t agree with you on what

313 means, then that’s it.
MR. WALSTON:

It’s not only that’s it, it means that

And the Administrator, this is —

QUESTION: Well, before we get to all of that, you

Do you agree?
MR. WALSTON: Well, we lose —- the Administrator

loses his own authority to issue permits.
QUESTION;

Do you agree that you lose?

MR. WALSTON:

Yes, I certainly agree with that.

QUESTION: And your point is that under any consistent
reading of the statutory language, then the Administrator, too,
would lose any authority to —
MR. WALSTON:

Precisely.

I understood that's

your basic 402 argument.
MR. WALSTON:

Right.

I think you were beginning to explain a specific
and more limited argument with respect to 402(c) a few minutes
ago, 'when we interrupted you with questions.

I'm not sura

I understand that.
MR. WALSTON:

Well, 402(c) requires the Administrator

to suspend the issuance of permits into a State once he —
suspend his issuance of permits in that particular State once
he approves the State program.
Thus, under that result, the Administrator, once he
approves a State program, doesn't have authority to issue

So, what I'm saying is that once the Administrator
approves a State permit program, ha doesn't have any authority
to issue permits to federal dischargers under the language of

And along these lines, I'd like to

Now, listen carefully:

MR. WALSTON:

Yes.

And tlie Senate Report — and we did quote the Senate
in our brief,, page 10, at footnote 10 , states as follows:

"Therefore, the bill provides that after a State
submits a program which meets the criteria established by the
Administrator pursuant to regulations, the Administrator shall
suspend his activity in such State”

■— in such State — "under

the federal permit program,"
Thus, ones the Administrator approves a State program,
he loses the authority to issue permits to any discharger,
federal or otherwise? and thus he has no authority to issue
permits to federal dischargers once he approves the State
program.
Thus,
QUESTION:

Mr. Walston, could I ask a question about

the federal permit program?
As I read 402 (a), the whole federal permit program
is permissive rather than mandatory.

Do you understand that

the federal government is required to issue permits rather
than, for example, setting general limitations which must be
complied with across the board?
MR. WALSTON: Well, we believe that Section 402 is
mandatory as to federal dischargers by virtue of Section 313.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SLADE GORTON, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS, STATE OF

WASHINGTON

AND ITS DEPARTMENT OF ECOLOGY
MR, GORTON;

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
Mr. Justice Stevens, the basic answer to your last
question is that there are, of course, a number of sections of
this Act which are of great importance.

The one which answers

your last question is Section 301, which is the prohibitory
section of the Act, which says "thou shalt not" without a
permit.
This means «»
QUESTION:

I don’t think it quite says that, Mr.

Gorton, At least, I don’t so read it.

Maybe that’s the way

it’s generally understood, but
QUESTION: Where do we:, find that?
MR. GORTON:

All right. Section 301(a)

QUESTION; And where do we find that in the papers
filed with us?
MR. GORTON;
in any of the briefs.
QUESTION:
QUESTION;

I'm not sure that 301 is quoted in full
It may be in ours.
All right,
It says, "except as in compliance with

this section and section 402 ? among other sections"
MR. GORTON: Right.
QUESTION:

the discharger of pollutant"—

—» "the discharge is unlawful."

But what is it. that says one is not in compliance
with 402 if there's been no permit program instituted?
The permit program provided by* in — specified in 402 is
permissive, is what I'm suggesting.
QUESTION: That is the federal permit.
QUESTION:

The federal permit program.

MR. GORTON: The federal permit program is a — does
— it is true that the federal program says that,the second
line of Section 402 says that the Administrator may issue a
permit —QUESTION:

Could not one read that — I just suggest

this as a possibility — to allow a specific permit of greater
discharge than .the limitation would normally authorize?
MR. GORTON:

Yes.

There's no question about that.

This is why we had —
QUESTION: Well, just to get my thought out, so ‘that
you can address it:

would it not be consistent with the scheme

of the Act for the federal government to have a general
effluent limitation, and then soma permits which are more
liberal?
MR. GORTON:
scheme of the program.

Yes.

As a matter of fact, that is the

We have certain goals set out in -the

30

statute for 1977, others for 19 85.

Those goals are not met by

the conditions of the permits which are issued today.
QUESTION: Then, would it not follow, that the
abandonment or suspension of a federal permit program within a
given State would not remove all federal control over discharges
within that State?
MR. GORTON:

No, I don’t —

QUESTION:

That the limitations would still apply?

MR. GORTON:

No.

Because the State, under Section

510, has the right to impose more stringent limitations than
does the federal government itself.

That State authority is

specifically not. only preserved but, perhaps, as you may say,
created by Section 510.
QUESTION: Do you understand —• just to get my last
question, so I understand this — do you understand that the
federal government would have the authority to disapprove of a
State permit program on the ground that it was too severe?
MR. GORTON:

No.

The federal government would not

have the authority to disapprove, -~
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:

Because of 510?
■—* because of 510.

We must meet nine

qualifications under Section 402(b) to be authorized to have a
permit program.
When we have met those nine qualifications, we are
entitled to manage our own permit program.

But that permit

31
program and our effluent limitations may be more restrictive
than -those which the EPA Aqraini sirator — -that operated under
Section 402(a).
This is consistent —- I’d like to go back, if I can,,
and walk through several sections of this statute, and just a
bit of history.
Up until 1970, of course, as the Solicitor and we
agree, only the States could issue permits in water pollution
control matters.

In 1970, the President discovered the 1899

Refuse Act, and the Corps of Engineers began to issue permits
to water polluters.
This, of course, created a duplicatory and relatively
wasteful system, besides having the Corps of Engineers involved
in it, which it was one of the principal designs of the 1972
Act to cure? it wanted to get rid of that duplicatory system.
So the permit system in 402 first says, under 402(a), EPA
issues permits,
Second, it says, in Section 402(h) «— and this was
expected and is explicitly listed in the sponsor’s remarks
about the Act.

teat as soon as the States met federal

Qualifications, the EPA must — must — approve the State plan
-*** not may? at one point it did say "may”.

But as the Act

was passed, it said "must approve tee State plans”? and under
402(c), "must promptly suspend the issuance of its own
permits."

Now, 402, we all agree, contains no exemptions for
federal agencies.

But during the course of the passage of

that Act through Congress, at one point

it did contain an

exemption for federal agencies from one relatively limited
element of Section 402.

But that was not only taken out by

the Conference Committee, but the Conference Committee Report
shows that it was taken out, conscious of the fact that the
federal government should not have that specific exemption.
Section 301 refers to persons.

The prohibition of

Section 301 refers to persons, and is the basic prohibitory
section of the Act.
But federal agencies are not included within the
definition of persons in Section 502, subsection (5).

So if

it were not for Section 313, EPA could not issue permits to
federal entities? and, of course, neither could the States.
Section 313, as my colleague from California has
already said, is the reason EPA. can issue permits, as well as
the States? and it lumps them directly together.

It says

federal agencies are to comply with federal and State require­
ments respecting control of abatement and pollution to the
same extant that any parson is subject to such requirements.
So ‘the federal agecies seek 402(a) permits or 402 (b)
permits by reason of exactly the same authority.

And if the

word "requirements*' in this statute, Hr, Chief Justice, is
not broad enough to include procedural matters, i.e. state

permite under 402 (h) , it's not. broad enough to include federal
procedural requirements or permits under 402(a)»
The authority of the EPA. and the States are identi~
cal»
Now, not only is this a wrong and absurd result,
because it would free federal agencies from any obligation to
secure any permits at all, and because the dictionary
definition of the word "requirements” has to be totally
distorted for you to come to that kind of an answer, it is
also wrong ■—
QUESTION:

Mr, Gorton, may I go back to my prior

point, just where you are now?

It would not, however, free

the federal agency from the requirement of complying with the
applicable effluent limitation; is that not correct?
MR. GORTON;
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON;

That's right.
Yes.
That's right.

This part of the

distinction would still theoretically exist.

But neither we

nore EPA makes the claim, of course, — EPA doesn't want to
make the claim

that federal entities are free from the

permit., its own permit requirements.
But there’s another matter which helps in this
connection as well, and this may answer directly your question.
If you go to Section 505(f)(6), 505(f)(6) or 505 is
the so-called citizen's suit provision of this statute, which

34

means that if EPA doesn't do its job and -the State doesn’t do
its job, a citizen can corae in and bring a lawsuit in order
to enforce the Act.
Under that, an effluent limitation, i.e. the substance
that the Solicitor is talking about, is defined in 505(f)(5)
as a Section 402 permit.

That is to say, there is no distinction

between substance and procedure.
And then, in parentheses, which also includes a
Section 313 requirement.

Right back to the very word which

the Solicitor claims doesn’t include permits.
Effluent limitations, permits, requirements.

All

fall within the same —

to my brief as well.
QUESTION: Right.
QUESTION; What color- is -the California brief?

35

QUESTION;

[indicating]

e

It’s this color — whatever color this

putty color.

MR. GORTON;

Correct.

And let me read it.

Section 505 describes, quote, "an effluent standard
or limitation", end quote, as including, quote, "a permit or
condition thereof issued under Section 402 of this Act, which
is in effect under this Act", paren, "(including a requirement
applicable by reason of Section 313 of this Act)", end quote.
And the only answer the Solicitor has to that
proposition is that the first five subsections of that section
aren't requirements and that therefore -this doesn’t mean
anything.
But the first five subsections aren’t included in
the parenthetical expression.

It’s a non sequitur, even so

much as to argue that point.
QUESTION;

Mr. Attorney General, are you able to tell

us how many States have found it possible to function without
a permit system?
MR. GORTON;
like the Air case.

No States, Your Honor.

This is not

This is not like the Air case», no.

QUESTION;
MR. GORTON;

It’s not like the other case?
No. This is not that kind

there are

27 States, as the Solicitor General says, which have qualified
to operate their own permit system.

But in the other 23, -the

Administrator continues to operate a permit system.

This is

36

■the. current number
Now, the United States claims that because federal
agencies are expressly exempted from State procedures enforcing
new source standards by the terms of 306(c) of the Act, and
because federal agencies are expressly exempted from State
procedures for inspection,, monitoring and entry with respect
to point sources within the State, by the terms of 308(c),
an exemption from the State permit programs authorised by
Section 402(b) has got to be implied*
Now, there are two reasons where this isn°t so.
The first is because each of those two exemptions, not to
mention another in 401(a) which is irrelevant to this argument,
and 'the original House version which was right in Section 40 2
itself, and was removed by the Conference Committee, each of
these shows graphically that the Congress knew perfectly
well how to exempt federal agencies from specific Water
Control Act programs when it wished to do so.
Not only did it not do so in either Section 402 or
313, it even expunged the partial exemption which originally
appeared in Section 402 in the House version, and the legis­
lative history, which you111 find noted on page 30 of the
California brief, expressly shows that the Conference Committee
knew exactly what it was doing in taking out that particular
exemption„
QUESTION?

When you use the term "program”, what do

37

you embrace in that?
HR. GORTON: Well, in the case of 306 (c) and 308(c),
these were fragmented and limited programs.

306(c) applies

— or Section 306 applies only to new source standards; that
is, a new factory or a new installation.

And Section 308

creates a way in which -there will be inspection and monitoring,
a

procedural matter, I think, essentially, as opposed to

substantive requirements.
And this, of course, is exactly the pointc

What the

Congress decided was that if the State wanted to do a halfbaked job and only control new sources, or perhaps only to have
an independent inspection system, not related to any substantive
requirements whatsoever, Congress wasn’t going to let the
States do that to federal agencies; and that’s why they were
exempted.
They wanted to encourage 'the States to take over the
whole program.

This is the point of the entire Act.

So a State can have a program for new sources only.
It can have an inspection program only.

But without having a

full 402(b) permit system; but it can’t enforce that against
the federal government because EPA in that same State will
still be operating a permit program under 402(a).
And the Congress didn't want this kind of duplicatory
sys tern.
But once the State took its responsibilities under

38
402 (b), the federal agencies

then the federal agencies fall

within in, because, under the express terms of Section 402(b),
we must have elements of a new source program under 306, and
an inspection and monitoring system covered by Section 308»
And at that point, of course, the federal agencies
must secure State permits as well as abide by State substantive
standards.
And so this Act is completely consistent throughout,
just as the State can't require federal agencies to abide by
fragmented State programs and create a dual or duplicatory
system while EPA is still issuing permits under Section 402 (a),
so EPA can't create a dual or parallel permit program by
carving federal agencies out of a State permit program under
402(b).
With all of the confusion which is automatically
going to attend, upon a federal permit program, to enforce
State standards.
This is what Section 402(c) says.
313 says.

It's what Section

And it's what they mean.
And the very case which the Solicitor General is

making takes him right out of court himself, along with us.

39

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ0,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
First, let me just briefly allude to the argument
that Mr. Gorton has made with reference to Section 505(f) (6),
and what that says is that, in effect, a citizen's suit may be
brought against, a federal instrumentality which is alleged to
be violating an effluent standard or limitation? and then it
says that an effluent standard or limitation includes ” =» permit
or condition therciof issued under 402 of the Act, which is in
effect under the Act (including a requirement applicable by
reason of section 313 of the Act)."
We think all that the "requirement applicable by
reason of Section 313 of the Act" refers to is a substantive
standard imposed in a federal permit, not in a State permit,
in a federal permit that has been issued to a federal facility.
I! d like to also —
QUESTION:

Mr. Friedman, that depends on — you’ve

answered the case when you say that — that depends on how you
read 313, doesn’t it?

And isn’t that what we’re here to

decide?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
back to that; but roy point

Yes, Mr. Justice, it does come
they say that the fact that there’s

a reference to a requirement of 313 in 505(f) (6) «—

40
QUESTION: And isn’t it a question what does the
word ’’requirement" mean in 313?
MR. FRIEDMANs

Yes.

It seems to me, if you conclude

one way or the other, it’s easy.

But what they say is the

fact there's a reference to a requirement under 313 necessarily
indicates that 313 requirements includes the State permit
system.

That's —
QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

You’re saying requirement —

you’re arguing "requirement" means substantive limitation in
313, ergo, it means the same thing in 506 -— whatever it is.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, what we say is it means a

substantive requirement either in a — it means a substantive
requirement, in a federal permit, Mr. Justice.
That is our point.

But if

if they’re right, it

could mean one of two things.
It couldn't mean the substantive requirement in a
permit, because we say the States have no authority to require
permits for federal facilities.
But we do say it means the same substantive require»
rnent which may be included in a federal permit that has been
issued to a federal facility.
If I may just refer briefly to one point you made
earlier as to whether the permit program under Section 402 is
a mandatory program, the Environmental Protection Agency takes
the position 'that it is, that they have to have a permit prograir

41
— that this is the whole scheme of the statute to control
point source pollution by a program of permits.

First, to be

issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, and then, if a
satisfactory State permit program is included, by the State.
Now, the suggestion is made that because the statute
requires and terminates the authority of the Administrator to
issue federal permits once he approves a State permit program,
if he approves a State permit program, that means one of two
things:

either that his entire authority to issue permits to

federal facilities is terminated? or, as it's been suggested
in the brief, that somehow when he gets rid of his authority
to issue permits, that, means somehow the States get it.
Well, it. seems to us that if we are correct in our
position, that there is no authority under this statute to —
for the States to compel federal instrumentalities to obtain
permits, that when the Administrator approves a State plan
which provides for the State issuance of permits necessarily,
he cannot approve the plan insofar as it purports to give the
States authority to issue permits for federal facilities,
because there's nothing in the statute that permits that.
And we think that inherent in the whole concept is
that when he approves a plan, all that, he can approve and all
that he loses authority to issue is with respect to those
portions of the State plan that are valid? and that if the
State plan is invalid, as h-a held in his regulation and as he

42
held in these two cases, if it's invalid because under ‘tine
statute the State cannot require federal instrumentalities to
obtain a permit, then, necessarily, his approval «— his approval
of the State plan does not toxsch upon that issue.,
QUESTION:

That's your response to the 402(c)

argument .
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:
argument, that if

Yes.

But how about to their more basic 402
that the State and federal permits under

the statute stand or fall together?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

We don't think they have to, Mr.

Justice.
QUESTION:

Well, I’d like to hear why, because —

MR. FRIEDMAN;
QUESTION:

Because we —
that’s a great big part of their

argument, and, so far as I've heard, you haven't, directed
yourself to it.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes.

Our answer to that is -that the

authority to issue permits doss not stem from 313, it stems
from 402.

All that 313 doss is to state that the federal

facilities must comply with the substantive requirements of
State and federal law, however those requirements are imposed,
whether they’re imposed under a State permit program, whether
the State has some sort of a regulatory scheme, that doesn't
matter, as long as the State imposes substantive requirements,

43

313 requires the federal instrumentalities to comply„ But
there’s nothing in 313 that speaks of permits,
The whole argument is whether the word "requirements”
in 313 covers permits.

But 313 does not authorize any issuance

of permits,
The permits are issued by the federal system under -by the Administrator under 402$ if the /administrator delegates
to the States the authority to issue such permits , then they
have that authority under 402.
But you look to 402 only to see who can issue permits.
\

But the authority to issue permits, and the requirement that
there be compliance with the substantive standards, either in
the permits or elsewhere, is what 317 [sic] does.
QUESTION:

Well, perhaps you’ve said, Mr. Friedman;

would the Administrator approve a State plan that did not have
a permit system?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

He would not have — no, because,

under 402, the only State plan is a State plan for a permit.
Now, he could approve —
QUESTION:

So that if a State doesn't have a permit

system, -their plan will be disapproved?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That's right. The only State,

because — and then the federal permit plan would continue in
operation.

That's what we have in the 23 States that have

not submitted, and do not have any State -- any federally

44
delegated,, federally approved permit piam
'Hiat doesn’t mean that the State couldn’t impose
other requirements„

But a State might have a permit plan

which is very different from the federal standards, which it
would apply within the State, but, nevertheless, there would
still be the federal permit plan»
The only way that the State can oust the FPA plan
which is in operation is if it submits a plan which EPA
approves.
QUESTIONS

So that if a State submits a plan that

has only substantive standards in it, and no permit system,
what happens?
MR. FRIEDMAN; The EPA would have to disapprove that
plan.
QUESTION:

In its entirety?

MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:
QUESTION;

In its entirety.

Okay.
So in that respect, as in others, this

statute is different — this federal statute is different
from the Air legislation that we had in the previous case?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION;

It’s different because —?

Which does not require that State plans

have permits.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That’s correct.

This statute is

different because one of the key elements of this is a permit

45
plan,
QUESTION;

Right.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Right.

But it seems to us it's — there's

been a suggestion here that somehow, because you have a permit
plan generally, that necessarily indicates the Congress
intended to impose that same kind of permit plan, permits
issued by the States, upon the federal authorities and the
State authorities.
It seems to us it's a very different thing — I'd
like to conclude on this note ~ between saying that the
federal instrumentalities have to comply with the substantive
requirements that the State has imposed, which is what Congress
has done in Section 370 [sic] .

And to take the next and, to

us, a very large step of saying "and it's the States" — it's
the States and not the federal government that can require
the federal instrumentalities to do that.
We don't think Congress has-! gone that far in this
s fcatuta.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
QUESTION:

Thank you —

Could I just ask one question?

Is

there any way for a State to articulate a substantive require™
ment except through a permit?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, I think they can negotiate,

they do it; they can announce that for a particular — they

46
can coins in and talk and they can say that for a particular
point you shan't throw into the water more than ten gallons
of chlorine a day.
They come in* they talk to these people, they can
work the thing out, and then the federal people would be
required to comply with that.
We don't accept -this notion that the only way -the only way — you can have meaningful effluent standards
is through a State permit program.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 12:00 o’clock, noon, the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
