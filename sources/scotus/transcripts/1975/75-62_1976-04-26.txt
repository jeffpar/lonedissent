MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

School V. Gonzales; Wo. 75-278, Southern Independent School
Association v. McCracv; and Wo. 75-306, McCrary v. Runyon.
Mr. Koutoulakos, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS KOUTOULAKOS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN RESPONDENTS AND PETITIONERS
MR. KOUTOULAKOS:
Justices:

Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable

I represent the Bobbe's School, which is Mr. and

Mrs. Runyon, who are operating it, and I will limit my argument
to the narrow areas of what.I consider the crucial issue in
this case and, if necessary, will rebut on the point of the
statute of limitations on the right of attorneys fees.
Now, first let me touch on the facts a little bit as
to the reason why we are here.

The Bobbe's School is a small

school in Arlington, Virginia, in Fairfax, Virginia, it is right,
on the line, that operates a private school.

It has been

stipulated in the facts that the school is not supported in. any
way by any federal or state money and it depends entirely in its;
support upon the student enrollment.
Insofar a** th-* Bobfoe*« school is concerned — now,
this case was consolidated with the Brewster School — but
insofar as the Bobbe's School is concerned, Mr. and Mrs. McCrary

5
McCrary and Mr. and Mrs. Gonzales, testified — and, of course,
this is unrebutted — that, as a result of a telephone call —
this is by both parties, one in 5 69 and one in '71 or 372, as
I recall

and no further contact and no formal application,

as a. result of a telephone call, it brought into play section
1981 of the Civil Rights Act that we are now here under.

And

the court, upon hearing evidence — and there is a serious
question in my mind as to whether or not — and the dissent
was'in agreement with what I am going to say — that there is
a serious question of whether or not they made out a case.
They certainly did not rebut the fact that there are
selective standards of exclusion by our school.
evidence contrary to that.

There is no

I think all the evidence is clear

that no one would be admitted on the basis of a phone call.
There has to be a formal application and certain admission
policies that are necessary, such as a medical examination, a
personal interview with a parant and, based on that, then it
is determined as to whether or not the person is to be admitted.
Now, if seems to me that the bedrock of what the
plaintiffs relied upon to be here is the Jones case.

First,

starting off with section 1981 and just going briefly, it says
that all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States
shall have the same right in every state and territory to make
and enforce contracts to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to
the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the

6

security of parsons and property as is enjoyed by white
citizens.
Now, I will jump to the Jones case, because, as I
say, that seems to be the foundation of private discrimination
and, really, that is what X think we are here on.
at the outset, X want, to make this observation;

Now, first,
Being of

Greek heritage, it is not a question of whether I agree or
don't agree with restrictive policies.

1 am here, as Mr.

Justice Marshall used to, in the old days, support individual
rights in this battle to eliminate abuses.

Well, X am here in

support of an individual right of a citizen in this country or
any person in this country the right of privacy and the right
to freely choose his associates.
Now, the Jones case says that private discrimination
at least in contract matters is barred by the Constitution.
Now, without getting to the question of whether X agree or
don’t agree with that decision, I do want to say that that de­
cision can be distinguished.
First, if we get to the 1883 civil rights cases, X
think in those cases the Honorable Court there determined that
Congress is limited as to what it can do, and there sre certain
basic rights that transcend and militate against the right of
Congress or any other political body to regulate against, and
X am talking about the freedom of association.
Now, it seems to me that we are at the crossroads,

7
and I have -tried to read — and 1 am not certainly the smartest
man in the world nor the most brilliant legal author, but it
seems to me that just plain common sense at least leads me to
the conclusion that this country is based on two things, and it
separates us from other nations, and that is the most basic
thing is the right to be left alone, the right of individual
freedom which, of course, incorporates with it —- and I think
it is protected by the Bill of Rights, but I think this right
transcends the Bill of Rights.
to be left alone and to be free,

I think it is a God-given right
find as the Pierce and the

Yoder and the Mayer cases indicated with reference to private
schools and the right of an education, there is certainly no
constitutional right to an education.

This Court has held

that once a state steps in and provides an education, then due
process requires that all people be treated alike, independent
of color, and 1 certainly subscribe to that.
ing about public schools.

But we are talk­

And when we get into the area of

private schools, I think all the cases that I have read from
this Court — and: I don't want tc take your time in citing them,
but they all point to the fact that private schools do have a
\

right to exist, regardless of their discriminatory policies,
and I think they have got that right.
I think any more than I have the right to invite
whoever I want to in my home and the argument would be, well,
this is a private school, however, it does require a certain

8
amount of touch with the public, isn't that sufficient, to bring
it within the ambit of the Mayers case, and I say no.
QUESTION:

Well, why is that any different than an

employer who insists that he, as a private employer, should
have the right to choose whom he wants to as his employees?
MR. KOUTOULAKOS:

Well, because I think, as the

dissent pointed out in this case, in the Runyon case, that
this is the right of association in personal situations that,
come into play in a private school, and 31 think parents, it
the parent has the right, as this Court said in the Fierce
case, to select the school and the education for its children,
then I say that there is a concomitant right of the private
school to select the students it wants to educate, and I feel
that that right has to be a fundamentally protected right.
It seems to me that the right of contract, if the
Jones case is accepted to its fullest analysis, then it gives
the right to a group that no other group can have in this
country.

It gives a unilateral right to force a contract when

that violates and emasculates all the rules of contract at
least that I have been introduced to, both in law school and
since mv active career as a practitioner.

It seems to me that

tha contract right that they are talking about in 1981 dealt
with, of course, eliminating the shackles of slavery and
should have been, there is no argument on that.

And that is

all they are talking about, because the blacks did not have a

9
right to contract and? as a result of that, they were sub­
mitted to the humiliation that those folks had to go through,
and that is what they are talking about.
They certainly are not talking about? and I don't
believe that they intended to talk about the fact that a pri­
vata school, like a private individual, is mandated to accept
a contract by somebody they don’t want to accept a contract
with, any more than I can be forced to accept a contract or
anybody else because contracts require mutuality.

If we are

going to get into the Ophelian legalities and explanations of
rights and duties, and if we are going to get into contractual
rights, whether it. be Williston or anybody else, whatever it
may be, I have never seen any decision, any contract forced
upon an individual absent a mutuality of the minds... and that
is exactly what is being done here,
QUESTION s

Except the statute says that all. persons

shall have the right to make and enforce contracts?
MR. KOUTOULAKOS x
QUESTIONs

Exactly.

And what you say is certainly correct, as

I remember my contract law from law school, except that if a
school, your client, says we will never ever make any offer to
anybody or the Negro race, so nobody in the Negro race will
ever have an opportunity of accepting, isn't that depriving
everybody in the Negro race of his right to make a contract?
MR. KOUTCULAKOS:

Wall, now, we are assuming, as we

10

are here, that this is a purely private school?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. KOUTOULAKOSs

My answer is no, and if it is —

and, regardless of my views, I may disagree with it —* I say
they have got that right.

It is an absolute right that every

citizen has —
QUESTION;

Well, I was talking about the application

of the statute,
MR. KOUTOULAKOS;

Well, I say, no, it doesn’t apply

to that, because, in citing the civil rights ease of 1883 and
bring them forward, the Constitution cannot reach private dis­
crimination, it is just that simple.
QUESTION;
the statute.

Well, my question went to the wording of

I have a right to make a contract under this

statute, the same right as all white citizens, and let's say
the whole world said that it is agreed that I would never,
during my whole lifetime, have an offer and therefore I could
never accept and I could never make a contract, wouldn’t that
deprive me of my right to make contracts?
MR. KOUTOULAKOS;

Well, maybe in the pure sense of

the word, but in the sense of a right and a duty that a con­
tract would bring into play, then I say that that statute can­
not do that, because it cannot force a person to enter into a.
contract that doesn't wish to, and I think that has been funda­
mental in all our cases.

There is absolutely no decision that

11
I have seen anywhere

and, of course, 1 couldn't possibly

read them all — that says, you, Mr. Koutoulakos, must be
mandated to accept a contract whether you want to or.not, and
that is exactly what the interpretation of 1981 would have to
do, and I say, no, that is not the case.
QUESTION

l suppose as a matter of contract law,

your client would make the offer arid the applicant would make
the acceptance, or is it the other way?
MR. KOUTOULAKOS;

Well, it seems to me that the offer

has to come from the other way.
QUESTIONS

You invite the offer, is that year theory?

MR. KOUTOULAKOS:

Exactly.

Exactly correct, like you

would invite a guest into your home, and that is exactly the
predicate that I am operating under.
QUESTION:

Yes, but if a man is running a contracting

business and he puts an ad in the paper saying that he needs
seven bricklayers and five plumbers and what not, he is then
inviting applications, is he not?
MR. KOUTOULAKOS:

But he also has the right to re­

fuse those applications.
QUESTION:

Oh, yes, but he is inviting applications.

MR. KOUTOULAKOS:
QUESTION:

Yes.

But if he announced or practiced a univer­

sal refusal to employ any person of a particular race, where
would he be?

12
MR. KOUTQULAKOS%

Well, of course, depending on

whether you have any federal involvement or state involvement,
absent that —~
QUESTION:

lie is building an interstate highway.

MR. K0UTGULAK05:

He’s got the right.

Absent what

the criteria have been as set out in prior court, precedents,
he has that right,

It may not be a nice right, it may be some-

thing that we don't like —
QUESTION:

Well, that is absent the statute —•

MR. KOUTQULAKOS:
QUESTION:

Absent a statute ~

-— certainly he has, unless there is state

action or state involvement.
MR. KOUTOULAKOS:
QUESTIONz

That's right.

But there is a statute covering the Chief

Justice's question, Title VII,- and there is a statute here,
and the question is does it apply in this situation?

That is

the only question
MR,. KOUTOULAKOSs

That's right, and I say it doesn't.

I say
QUESTION;

That is —

MR. KOUTOULAKOSs

-- there has been some rathex in­

teresting decisions even flowing from that decision — and I
certainly don't want to be presumptuous.

I said earlier, I

disagree with it, I will say it again, I disagree with it, but
any one can be distinguished —

13

QUESTION s
don't you?

You also disagree with Smith v. Allright,

The same exact argument was made that the primary

in Texas was white because the white people wanted it white
and they had a right to do it and nobody could do anything
about their right to associate with whom they wanted to asso­
ciate , and this Court just ignored chat argument completely.
MR. KOUTOULAKOSs

Well, except for one things

We

are talking here about a statute that owes its existence to
the post-revolutionary days, and a hard reading of both the
debates and. the decisions — and I have just got to believe
that this Court was just as conversant with the debates in
those days, back in 1883, when they came down hard with that
decision, as they are today —
QUESTION:

Which, decision?

MR. KOUTOULAKOSs
QUESTIONS

Well, 1 am talking about Smith v. Allright,,

MR. KOUTOULAKOSs
QUESTION;

The 1883 civil rights decision.

I understand that, but —-■

Smith v. Allright says you don't have

that unlimited right to associate with only whom you want to
associate with.
MR. KOUTOULAKOSs
along with that argument.
QUESTIONS

Well, literally, I just don’t go
I ■—

You mean you don't go along with the de­

cision?
MR. KOUTOULAKOSs

Well, if that is the decision, I

14
don't go along with the decision.
QUESTION;

The decision said you couldn’t bar Negroes

from voting in the primary in Texas.
MR. KOUTOULAKOS;
QUESTION;

Yes, but

Period.

MR. KOUTOULAKOS:

Right, but you are talking about

a —
QUESTION;

And the civil rights cases said to the

contrary.
MR. KOUTOULAKOS:

But you are talking about a voting

right now.
QUESTION;

No, I am talking about the right — they

said that it was a right to assemble, the right to be together.
It was just like a country club,

I can remember like it was

yesterday, it was just a perfect little private matter, you do
whatever you please, and this Court, just threw it right out the
window.
MR. KOUTOULAKOS;

Well, of course, they must have

made that argument with tongue in cheeck, if it deals with
voting rights.
chat view.

Certainly, I would have to agree with you on

It is a little different proposition than the pri­

va te schools.
QUESTION:

And yet; say there is no state action in

here at all?
MR. KOUTOULAKOS;

No.

Well —

15

QUESTION s

It is completely financed — I guess the

buildings and all are completely financed by private people,
and I assume they pay taxes?
MR. KOUTOULAKOS:
QUESTION:

The state actually —

I assume they pay taxes.

MR. KOUTOULAKOS:

I would, assume to, but I really

don't knowlQUESTION:

Do you think that school pays property

taxes?
MR. KOUTOULAKOS:
don't.

I would hope so, but some schools

I would say that they probably did.
QUESTION:

Do they meet the requirements of the

Virginia educational laws?
MR. KOUTOULAKOS:

Are you talking about the school

that I represent?
QUESTIONs

Yes, sir.

MR. KOUTOULAKOS:

Well, you know that private schools

in Virginia, at least this one is not regulated other than
having a certificate, and that is the only type of thing that
they have to meet.

Yes, they do pay taxes.

I didn't realise

you were referring to my — yes, they do pay taxes.
QUESTIONs

And they have a certificate and they are

not periodically examined by the state?
MR. KOUTOULAKOS:
reasons, that type of thing.

For health reasons, fire prevention
We have a very comprehensive

16

public school statutory scheme in Virginia.

It is one of the

finest in the world, and that is why I come down hard on the
right of a private school, at least in our state, to do as it
chooses, because our public school system ---QUESTION:

The state law doesn’t give you the right to

refuse Negroes.
MR,. K0UT0ULAK08 s
gives us

I am not saying that the state lav?

I say that insofar as a private individual is con­

cerned — and I am, of course, taking the position that the
private school, that is a purely private school, has the same
rights, and that is a right that is a personal right, that is a
God-given right for you to live with — and that is what I think
separates the democracy from other nations —* that right to
choose your associates, whom you want to bring in your home, and
to do as you see fit personally, as long as -QUESTION:

This isn't no home.

people and love children.
QUESTION:

And let me make this observation —

How long has this school been in existence?

MR. KOOTOULAKOS:

Since late — the late fifties.

They never had an opportunity to reject or admit be­
cause no black person had ever applied.

Once they did apply,

we have admitted them, and I think there are two or three
presently in the school now, so that is not the question.

The

question that we come down hard on is the individual right of a
private citizen, just like a private school, to insist on who
they wish —

Wait a minute.

I thought it was the ques­

since the decision came down, they did

apply.

But not at the time this lawsuit —

MR. KOUTGULAKOS:
QUESTIONi

Well, none — at that time —

The question is whether this school can

practice a policy of complete racial exclusion, that is the
question,
MR. KOUTGULAKOS:

That is the question, yes, that is

at least before this Court, and we take the position that if it
is a private school, it can, it has got the freedom of choice.
t

QUESTION:

And that is the issue, isn't it?

MR. KOUTGULAKOS;

That is the issue, that is squarely

the issue, no question.

started is not relevant to

QUESTION:

MR. KOUTGULAKOS:

No, because we still take the posi­

tion •— and, as 1 say, regardless of my personal views, I take
the position that we have got that right, as an individual, we
have cot the right of privacy and the right of association.
X remember what Justice Braudels said in a dissent, he said,

19

you know, one of the great rights we have in this country, and
he considers it the highest right, is the right to be left
alone*

We are. getting so much government regulation, govern­

ment interference in everything any more, and when that falls
short, I guess, it evolves upon the courts — when they see
abuses ~ and I certainly don’t argue that too much, but 1
think sometimes we have extended ourselves into areas that
belong to the legislatures,

I don’t believe we can legislate

or, rather, we can, by judicial pressure, do away with one’s —
QUESTION:

Well, the point is the legislature acted

here and we have a Statute to construe, that is the only issue
here ,
MR. KOUTOULAKOS:

That’s right, but the interpreta­

tion of the statute, and why 1 —
QUESTION!

And that is what is at issue here.

MR* KOUTOULAKOS:

— like the dissent, and I guess I

am — I guess I am mostly on the dissent side — that the
Honorable Justice White and Justice Harlan had — and I think
that pretty well covers it, just like there is a —

20

QUESTION:

Well, certainly you would agree that it

has different language?
MR. KOUTOULAKOS:
QUESTIONS

Well —

1981 — because I think it might help your

case.
MR. KOUTOULAKOS:

Yes, it does, but I am saying though

that the Justices went into the history of private and non­
private discrimination and its application, and I have got to
say that I thought the dissent was brilliant.
much, but

I liked it very

in any event, I do take the position — and there

is a recent case, the Cook case, that came up from Alabama, in
federal court, that distinguishes aven the decision of Jones
and comes down very hard at least on the argument that I am
trying to make.
QUESTION;

That case arose under section 1982.

This

is quite a different section, worded quite differently -•
MR. KOUTOULAXOS;
QUESTION:

13SI —

— 1381.

MR. KOUTOULAKOS:

— is what is discussed in the Cook

case.
QUESTION -

Yes, but .Jones v. Mayer was 1982.

MR. KOUTOULAXOS:

1982, that is all it is, and that

is exactly right, but 1901 only comes in by allusion, you are
absolutely correct, and I would like to leave it with that and
leave 1981 exactly as I would like to argue.

21
Now, 2 am only going to touch briefly on the fact
that I think the Court was correct in the statute of limita­
tions application and attorneys fees.

I think absent — of

course, the general rule is rather clear in this country, anyhow
— absent any contractual, any contract between the parti.es or
any statutory mandate, attorneys fees are not awarded.

And in

this case, I certainly agree with the findings of the Court of
Appeals, there is certainly no bad faith.

.And as the dissent

again — at the pain of repeating myself — indicated, there is
a serious question in their mind, and there always was in my
mind, as to whether or not the case was proved, because we
certainly do have selective admissibility standards, and 1
think we met that test.

It just was overlooked, and at least

it brought the issue head-on to this Honorable Court tc be
decided.
And with reference to the statute of limitations, 1
think that is rather clear, state law applies and the two-year
statute was the applicable one.
Thank you*

22

School, that 1 represent, has been in operation for more than
twenty years, it is a small school, and the school year in
question had 177 pupils*

It is a private school, it receives

no public funds or assistance of any kind*
QUESTIONS

Pupils are boys and girls?

MR» LIPSCOMBs
QUESTION;

Boys and girls, Your Honor.

In what classes, what grades'?

MR. LIPSCOMB:

From pre-kindergarten up through the

sixth grade.
It has a plan or purpose of exclusiveness.

They

practice selectivity in admission of pupils on the basis of
such criteria as readiness, previous school record, age,
mental, physical and emotional maturity, intelligence, and
achievement potential.
QUESTION;

Does it now have —

MR. LIPSCOMB:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, it does now have —
other than white children?

MR. LIPSCOMB:

Yes.

As a matter of fact. Your Honor

it has always had non-white pupils, many Orientals, many from
Asia, India.

It now, as a result of the decision below, it

now, on w advice, has bean accepting all Negro applicants
and leaning over backwards to accept them, even when there is
some doubt as to whether they are qualified.
QUESTIONs
advice

It has rejected-

You had better be careful with that

23
MR. LIPSCOMB2
QUESTION:

What5 s that, sir?

You had better be a little careful with

that advice* or you will have another lawsuit.
[Laughter]
MR. LIPSCOMB;

Your Honor,, it is a problem getting

back into court again on this, and we don't want to get back
into court again on it, and we believe, in being careful.
The school rejects all unqualified applicants, in­
cluding whites, and it is in the contract.

It reserves the

right to accept or deny the application of any child for any
reason whatever.

It does not advertise in newspapers, maga­

zines, on radio or television.

It carries an advertisement in

the Yellow Pages of the telephone book, which states that it
is a private school.

Most of the parents learn about the

school from other parents.
In May '69, the Gonzales applied for admission of
their child to the summer camp, their main purpose being to
get the child into the camp, get him accustomed to the en­
vironment, so that ha could continue school in the fall in
the first grade.
They were the first Negroes ever to apply to the
school.

They were given an application to fill out and return

but failed to provide records of his previous education, as
required.

And the only previous training

of

the child was

in a day nursery school which did not provide kindergarten

24
training, including reading and numbers writing, which was
required by Fairfax-Brewster for admission to its first, grade.
The child was rejected by a letter dated May 16.
This action was filed three years and seven months later.
Mr. Gonzales testified that when he got the rejection notice,
he called the school, he talked to a person identified ass
Capt. Reiss, who said MThe .school is not integrated."
Reiss denied having had the conversation.
roboration of that call.

Capt.

There was no cor­

And Mrs. Bryant, who turned out to

be a neighbor of the Gonzales and also of the McCracy's, who
are plaintiffs in the other action here, testified that she
had telephoned the school in January of *72 and,, upon inquiry,
had been told by a woman or a man, she wasn’t sure, she
couldn’t remember which, that the school did not admit Negro
children.

There was no corroboration of that conversation.
The witnesses for the school denied that the school

had a policy of not accepting Negroes,

Mrs. Gonzs3.es testi­

fied that at all. times there was a public school available
for her child,

About a week after rejection by Fairfax-

Brewster and her inquiry at Bobbers School, the child was im­
mediately accepted into another' private school in the area,
where if stayed for two years, and it went to a parochial
private school for two years•

A month before the trial, the

family moved out of the county and the child was attending
public school in that new county at the time of trial.

25
The District Court found as a fact that the Gonzales
child had been rejected because of his race*, stating that the
school could have given him an examination, even though he had
not provided the educational background they had required.

It

also found that it was the policy of the school not to accept
Negroes.

There was no founding or conclusion or even any im­

plication of bad faith, perjury or untruthfulness under oath
as to any witnesses,

The court concluded that the school had
It awarded compensatory damages on be-'

half of the child and attorneys fees tc the plaintiffs.

It

had previously ruled that the claim of the parents was barred
by Virginia's two-year statute of limitations, which is ex­
pressly made applicable to every action for personal injuries.
It also awarded a permanent injunction enjoining FairfaxBrewster from discriminating on the basis of color in its
admissions policy.
We contend, first, that section 1981 does not pro-?
hibit or in any way affect the right of private schools to
reject applicants because

clearly the intent of the 39th Congress, when it enacted the
Civil Rights Act of 1866, from which Section 1981 as well as
•Section 1982 is derived, that the act should be construed —
that the act should not be construed, this was their clearly
expressed intent during the legislative debates, that the
act should not be construed to require white children and

26

black children to attend the same schools.
The bill was introduced in the House by Congressman
Wilson, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, co-author of the
bill, and its floor manager.

I might point out to the Court

that the members of the 39th Congress did not mean by the
term "civil rights" what that term may mean today.
said or asked, "What do these terms mean?"

Wilson

He was speaking

of civil rights and immunities, "What do these terms mean?
Do they mean that in all things civil, social, political, all
citizens, without distinction of race or color, shall be
equal?

By no means can they be so construed.

Do they mean

that all citizens shall vote in the several States?

"No," he

said»
And then he went on to say, "Nor do they mean that
all citizens shall sit on the juries, or that their children
shall attend the same schools.

These are not civil rights or

immunities."
Wilson defined "civil rights" as "The absolute
rights of individuals, the natural rights of men, the right
of personal security, the right of personal liberty, and the
right, to acquire and enjoy property.

Those/' he said, "are

the great fundamental rights which was the object of the bill
to protect.

And," he said —

AFTERNOON SESSION - 1;Q0 O5CLOCK
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Lipscomb, you may

proceed„
MR. LIPSCOMB;

Thank you.; sir.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court;
When the bill was introduced in the 39th Congress,
it. contained a clause declaring that there shall be no dis­
crimination in civil rights,or immunities among the inhabitants
of any state or territory of the United States on account of
race, color of previous condition of slavery.
this clause created consternation.

In both houses,

There were intense objec­

tions to it, and they were tied in, the objections were tied
in often to the problem of schools and whether this language
could be construed so as to require the white children and the
Negro children to attend the same schools.

In fact, the ob­

jections were so strong that eventually Congressman Wilson,
in order to obtain passage of this bill, amended the bill to
delete that clause.
QUESTIONs

Were they talking, do you think, about

public schools or private schools?
MR. LIPSCOMB;

.Your Honor, they didn’t distinguish,

but I think they were talking about — they were concerned
with the idea that they objected to, was the.children attend­
ing the same schools.

They didn't distinguish, they didn’t

differentiate between public and private.

30

QUESTION:

In many parts of the country, there were

not public schools in those days, is that correct?
MR. LIPSCOMBs

That may be true.

There were some in

the South, I know, and I say that they didn't distinguish.
They made no distinction.

Now, when the plaintiffs below

filed the supplemental brief about a week ago, it spurred me
to some additional research.

I found some statements made by

Senator Trumble, in the 42nd Congress, 2d Session, connection
with a supplemental civil rights bill, introduced by Senator
Sumner, which would have prohibited racial discrimination in
all common schools and other public institutions of learning.
Senator Tremble's remarks are extremely interesting
and revealing.

With the permission of the Court, I would

like to quote them.

This is the 42nd Congress, 2d Session,

at page 3189, he said — and may I say, Your HOnors, that
Senator Trumfole was the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Com­
mittee, he was the chief sponsor of the bill on the Senate
side, he was a co-author of the bill.
At page 3189 of the Congressional Globe, ha said
that the right to go to school is not a civil right and never
was, it is a privilege.

The Senator may try, I deny his

right as a member of congress to force anybody into a school
or to force anybody to take anybody into a school.
At' page 3190, he said, "Why, sir, we passed years
ago a civil rights bill conferring upon the colored people all

31

the civil rights which white people have, and they have them
to the same extent."
At page 3191, he made remarks which 1 will not read
here, but refer the Court to.

At page 3426, he said, "I do

not believe in legislation forcing them to the same schools.
Are we now undertaking to control how they should go to school
by act of Congress?"
It was the idea, Mr, Justice Stewart, that the re­
quiring children of the two races to go to school, they ob­
jected to.

They considered schools and education to be with­

in the domain of the states and not a civil right at all, so
therefore they didn’t consider that going to school or the
requirement of going to the same schools was comprehended
within the language “right to make and enforce contracts,"
which is contained in Section 1981, which Mr. Justice Stewart
questioned ny Brother Koutoulako® about.
QUESTION:

Wall, would the issue of contract come

up. with respect to public school attendance?
t*-R. LIPSCOMB?
right,

Well, Tour Honor, it is a property

I think this Court has held that the right to attend

public school is a property right, and so it would come under
Section 1982.
QUESTION:

Wall, it is a statutory entitlement in

those stater., and I suppose that includes now all the fifty
states where there is an absolute statutory right to go to a

32
public school.

But it is only by reason of that that —

MR. LIPSCOMB:

Well, Your Honor, when the Congress

enacted that language and they selected that language, of
course, they were trying

the mischief they were seeking to

correct was the reenactment, in effect the reenactment of the
slave codes, the new black codes which simply continued the
disabilities that slaves had had. before the abolition of
slavery, the disability to enter and eater into contracts, to
own property, to acquire it, so they were seeking to eliminate
those disabilities, and that is what they meant whey then
said to make and enforce contracts.
QUESTIONS

In that setting, Mr, Lipscomb, where

would sophisticated people such, as you would have in the
Congress, including lawyers, speak of the right to attend
public school in contract terms?
MR. LIPSCOMBj
really think not,

I don't think they would, no, sir. I

I don't think that is the kind of situation

which they had any intention would be comprehended in the
clause«
QUESTIONS

They night conceivably do that with re­

spect to higher education of that clay, that is colleges and
universities, where you paid a large tuition, where you had
conceivably that would

it would be

embraced in terms of contract.
M?u LIPSCOMB:

Conceivably, Your Honor, and 1 would

33

not quarrel with that.

But I wanted to move, if I might, to

the Thirteenth Amendment very briefly and to point out to the
Court that the Thirteenth — that section 2 of the Thirteenth
Amendment and section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, while
virtually identical in language, are really quite different in
scope, and that is because the subject matter of the two amend­
ments is so vastly different.
The Fourteenth Amendment contains those magnificent
generalities and great ideas and concepts like equal protection
of the law, due process; the Fourteenth Amendment ~ those
ideas are capable of growth and development, but the Thirteenth
Amendment —
QUESTION;

The bulk of the Fourteenth Amendment con­

fines itself to restrictions upon the states, as states.
MR. LIPSCOKB:
correct.

That's correct, Your Honor.

Now, taking the Thirteenth Amendment, Your Honor, it

is a sterile subject matter, it can't grow.
slavery.

That's

It abolished

That was the end of slavery, 110 years ago, it

abolished slavery.

That was the end, there could be no further

growth or development,

The incidence of slavery that existed

then cannot be added to or enlarged under the Thirteenth
Amendment, and to do so ■*—
QUESTION;

But they could be retained as they were

in the black codes.
MR. LIPSCOMB;

No, I mean to say if could not be —

34
the authority of Congress to enact appropriate legislation
couldn't enlarge the incidence and add to them, to those that
existed and which were abolished when slavery was abolished.
That is what I meant.
QUESTIONS

But Congress has power under section 2 of

tha Thirteenth Amendment to eliminate the vestages of slavery.
MR. LIPSCOMB;
Your Honor.

I don't know about the word "vestages?

The vestages are very •— the incidence I would

accept, but vestages and badges are very loose, vague, motive
terms.
QUESTION:

Well, what do you think section 2 of the

Thirteenth Amendment did mean then?
MR. LIPSCOMB:

That they might enforce the abolition

of slavery by appropriate legislation and not go beyond
slavery itself, involuntary servitude and the necessary inci­
dence that were understood by the people at that tints to be
part of slavery.

Discrimination, for example, was not regarded

by the people of that time as an incident of slavery.
QUESTION:

Well, how about the ability, the legal

capacity to own property?
MR. LIPSCOMB:
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor, they did mean that.

And to make contracts?

MR. LIPSCOMB;

They did mean that, Your Honor.

think therefore that so construed, the Civil Rights Act of
1866 is quite proper.

MR. LIPSCOMB:

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. LIPSCOMB:

Very well.

Private schools and public schools

Private schools have not yet been held

to be a public accommodation, along with inns, common carriers,
theatres, and similar places of amusement, and restaurants,
and no reasonable member of the public would expect that he
could demand admission into a private school and force his way
in simply because they carried an advertisement in the Yellow
Pages.
Lawyers are in the classified pages.

They may have

their cards in Martindale Hubbard, but 1 don't think that
they can be compelled to accept clients they don't want, ex­
cept in those unusual situations when they are appointed to
represent a person that hasn't an attorney by a court, as an
officer of the court.
About private schools, they may do things that public
schools may not.

They may provide religious instruction, they

may propagate a sectarian viewpoint, they may do many things,
including discipline, that tha public schools are inhibited

36

from doing.

They are not private clubs,

Private schools are

a different form or mode of private association or private
club*

The relationships are personal and intimate.

The

management provides the expertise, the professional staff and
the facilities in which the children associate with the
teachers and other children, and where parents also get into
the act.

Parents who place their children in private schools

undergo great sacrifice to do it.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Leonard.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE S. LEONARD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN RESPONDENTS AND PETITIONERS
MR. LEONARD:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
f'/y name is George Leonard.

I represent an intervenor

in the District Court by the name of the Southern Independent
School Association, approximately 375 schools, approximately
17 5,000 chiloran„
The factual discussions which the Court has heard
up to this point do not affect this particular intervenor.

We

stipulated with Mr. Brown in the lower court that these schools
do in fact, without any question, discriminate against Negroes
because of their color in exactly the same sense that a black
school may discriminate against whites because of his color or
a Chinese ox a French school or any other kind of school.

3?
We do it ™~ we have stipulated that a majority of
the schools represented by this particular association actu­
ally have that particular limitation on their admission*

So

the factual question of whether we do or don't is not in this
case as far as the intervenor is concerned.
The issue,, as it was stated by both the majority and
minority in the Fourth Circuit, we believe to be too narrow.
They said the issue was is an otherwise qualified black child
entitled to be admitted to any school of his choice, a private
school.
The actual issue in this case is much broader than
that.

It comes

up under 1981 and involves the First Amend­

ment and the freedom of association.

The actual issue in this

case is whether any child of any color may attend any school
of his choice.

If he is a boy, may he attend a girls school.

If he is Jew, may he attend a Catholic school.

If he is a

Chinese, may he attend a school for Mexican-Americans.
The question is truly about as broad as this Court
saw it to be back in the Pierce case, namely just how far do
the options of a parent go in trying to decide what kind of
education that child will have.
Wow, I hold no brief here, this intervenor does not
make any claim that its parents are right and other parents
are wrong, that white children alone should gather and all
others should be mixed.

We stand for the proposition, and we

38

claim it before this Court,, and we have claimed it before the
courts below, that every parent with a school child in this
country may select a school that that parent believes, given
some basic mathematical and reading ability,, that that paxent.
believes itfill develop the child into the kind of person that
the parent wants it to be.
QUESTIONi

There are certainly some limitations on

that, though, aren't there?

I mean, could the state then re­

quire accreditation and that sort of thing?
MR. LEONARD;
requirement.

Well, as I said, there is a minimum

This Court *— not this Court, the Supreme Court

of Tennessee — and I think a very illustrative case

held

that the use of poisonous snakes in religious — well, it does
have an analogy, Mr, Justice Rehnqu'ist.
this way;

Stop and think of it

Row far must religion be allowed to go?

How far

must race be allowed to go?
There was a Zionist church and school in Illinois
many, many years ago and they taught that the earth was flat
and the question was whether they could so teach.
time, as a matter of fact, it was upheld.

At that

Since then, this

Court has issued its holdings on the question of evolution
cannot be stopped by a state.

You must be able — the teacher

must be allowed to teach evolution.
Certain basic mathematics — we have in the Rodrigues
opinion from this Court, for example, the question of whether

39
education itself is not a constitutional right, but there is
some sort of amorphous beginning of education, probably the
ability to read and write and do simple things, which every
child is entitled to.

If a school does not provide that, I

think it would be completely and utterly proper for the state
to say we will not qualify you, we will not justify you.

But

if you give them the basic education, then what you give them
in addition to that, whether it is religious training, whether
it is training for home economics for girls in the girls school,
whether it is bricklaying for boys in a boys school, it makes
no difference, provided that the fundamental education at the
core is given,
QUESTION?

Well, why isn’t the state or in this

case Congress, if indeed Congress did say so, free to say that
just as important as reading and writing and arithmetic is
learning in an integrated environment?
MR. LEONARD;

You are quite right, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, and if they said sc, what I am trying to address my­
self to at this moment is exactly that point,
QUESTION:

I won't distract you,

MR. LEONARD;

This was made —- this point was made in

point five of the brief of this intervener.
answered by any responding brief.

It has never been

I don't believe it can be

answered.

And it goes directly to Mr. justice Rehnquist s

question.

If a person wants an integrated education, public,

40

private or otherwise, is he entitled to get it, and the answer
is clearly yes.
If we had schools which were so located in the
United States that a child who couldn’t get into them could
not be educated, I think we would have a very difficult case
on our hands.
QUESTION:

But you concede that even though a parent

might want education for his children which was totally
deficient in the three R*s, the state can tell that parent,
no, you cannot acquire that kind of education even in a pri­
vate school, do you not?
MR. LEONARD:

No, I don't go that far at all.

I do

feel that there is some fundamental type of education that
every child in the United States 13 entitled to.
QUESTION:

But how —

MR. LEONARD:
QUESTION:

How far does it go?

It is not so•much a question of what the

child is entitle! to, it is & question of what limits the
state can put on the choica that the parents —
MR. LEONARD-:
ample?

Ah, how far can the state go, for ex­

Some states hove passed laws — I believe Wisconsin is

one of them — that every•private school in the state must be
integrated.

Let’s take that as an example.

Suppose they have

a law which says that every private school in the state must
be racially integrated but not othersise, would that be valid?

41
7 really don't know the answer, because it is not the case
which arises on the facts in this record.

I think it is a

very difficult question to raise as to whether you can take
one particular form of discrimination and say that you cannot
have, like the teaching of German, if you are — the Court
will recall, you had a decision many years ago in Waters when
the State of Iowa tried to prevent the teaching of German in
schools because of World War I, 1 presume, and this Court
held that you could not prevent that type of teaching.
QUESTION:

Do you think that is still good law?

HR. LEONARD:

As a matter of fact, yes, I do believe

it is good law, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

1 believe that there

are certain things of a fundamentally academic nature which a
state cannot take away.
Now, if we look at the Yoder decision, for example,
the state insisted that these children go on beyond a certain
degree of time, and this Court held that, when they were re­
turned to the Mennonite community, the average community
there, they did in fact receive equivalent instruction.

Now,

it might be Amish instruction, it might be Mennonite instruc­
tion, but it was equivalent instruction so that, for all
practical purposes, the state could not take the position that
education shall be thus and so.

It is like the pregnancy case,

you cannot fix an absolute line and say above or foelcw that is
valid unless there is a good reason for it.

Now, I think the

42
German, there would be no good reason,
well used language.

German is a fairly

Evolution- this Court held there was no

good reason to stop its teaching.
Now we come down to the question of whether a child
is entitled to an integrated education.

250,, 000 black children

in the United States attend private schools, a quarter of a
million of them.

How many attend all-black schools?

I do not

know.
QUESTION:

Do you know of any private "all black

school" that excludes people?
MR. LEONARD;

Yes, Your Honor, Sedalia, North

Carolina.

North Carolina, a very good: one it is, too.

excludes anybody on the grounds of race?
MR, LEONARDr

l don't really know that I car.

The

eleven schools in Mississippi that were all black, that were
talked about in the case down there, were I believe parochial
schools.

I believe the ones that were spoken of in

44
Philadelphia, in the lemon brief were again parochial schools.
QUESTION s

Can you imagine a white student applying

to an all-Negro school in Mississippi?
MR. LEONARDS
they do seem to attend.
but they do.

I can imagine it, Your Honor, because
I can’t say that I am in favor of it,

I think that any child who goes into a school

which is 99.9 percent of a different color is really express­
ing something —
QUESTIONs

All I am objecting to you, sir, is compar­

ing your school with the average Negro private school.

There

is no comparison.
MR. LEONARD:
QUESTIONt

I believer there is.

Mr. Leonard, do you rely in your argument

on the religion, either of the two religion clauses of the
First Amendment?
MR. LEONARD:

The second point I wanted to come to,

if I may, if I find the time, Your Honor, is that the decisions
in this country

and I may say, frankly, of this Court. —

have divided discrimination into malign and benign.

I believe

that the word of this Court in one case, it was invidious
discrimination; in another case, it was benevolent.
Mro Justice White, as a matter of fact, took the
occasion to note -- I think it was in Wheeler v. Barrera, and
Mr. Justice Douglas did as well — that the decision in that
case, which gave government funding to parochial schools, was

45

So if I may come back for the momentr we have an
amicus in this case by the name of the Council for American
Private Education? it claims to represent 90 percent of all
the private schools in the United States.

Those 90 percent of

the private schools in the United States are? according to
that brief? totally integrated.
VJe have 16,000 private schools? roughly speaking? in
the United States? 90 percent of all children attend integrated
public schools? 10 percent of all children in the United States
attend private schools.

Of the 10 percent that attend private

schools? 90 percent go to religious schools,,

I don't know7

■whether they axe integrated or not in a racial sense, they are
certainly integrated in a religious sense,
QUESTIONj

Segregated?

I ■ R. LEONARDs
QUESTION?

Pardon?

Did you mean they are integrated in a re­

ligious sense?
MR. LEONARD;

I don’t believe that a practicing

Roman Catholic would make a good. Jewish Rabbi? and there are
schools for both.
QUESTIONs

So they are segregated? the religious

schools f not integrated? religiously?

47
MR. LEONARD?
itely segregated.

Oh, religiously they are very defini-

They may be — I believe the Catholic Church

takes the position that it is totally integrated racially.
Of the 10 percent of children that go to private
schools, 30 percent of them go to religious schools, 10 percent
go to everything else there is.

Now, we have Indian schools,

we have Chinese schools, we have black schools, we have French
schools, we have German schools — 1 would like to call the
Court's attention, if X may, to the list which we put into the
record, appearing at page 168 of the appendix.

Now, we just

took the 33,000 names in the tax-exempt lists and picked out
the first hundred we came to which' apparently were - definitely
educational organisations catering to one particular ethnic
religious or other type group.
QUESTIONS

What page of the appendix is that on?

MR. LEONARD?

Page 168 of the appendix.

In short, gentlemen, 99 percent of all schools in
the United States are totally integrated in a racial sense?
1 percent is not, and that is divided up into every form that
!

you can think of.

Yet there are enough of these schools one

place or another that every single parent still hasi some
control over the education of the child.

If she believes in a

particular type of association, she can find it.
I have already broached on the subject of' the
visions between the courts which is growing.

The Second

48
Circuit was very frank about it.

In the Weise and Jackson

case, they said let everybody know, we use a double standard
for determining state action.

If it is religious discrimin*4

ation, we don’t find state action? if it is racial discrimin­
ation, we do find state action.
In the Vorchheime case, which was just reversed two
weeks ago, in the Third Circuit, they held that as long as the
City of Philadelphia maintained coeducational high schools, it
could maintain a public boys high school and girls high school.
QUESTIONS

Do your opponents rely here at all on

state actions, in effect saying —
MR. LEONARD*

Hone whatever, as far as X know.

It

was never raised as a question below, and, as far as I know,
even the tax exemptions have been taken away from these par­
ticular schools.
So that what we have in this particular case is in
every type of discrimination involved, and discrimination at
one time was a good word, and when I stand here to use it I

don't mean that this is necessarily a horrible thing.

In a

•'country which is essentially a pluralistic country,, the dis­
crimination between people, between the meals you eat, between
the type of things you drink, the words you use and the
people you associate with, inevitably there is discrimination
in virtually every element of life.
How, when wc; come down to the question of putting a

49
child into a school, if that child is black he can go to an
integrated school, a black school or a public school, which is
always integrated.

If he happens to be Spanish surnamed, there

are a whole series of private schools which he can attend, or
he can attend an integrated school or he can attend a public
school.
There is still a virtual choice for a parent in this
country to find a school.

Now, there may exist situations

where the only school in a given area, the only school there
is within reachable area is one particular type.
you have a different problem.

In that case,

The whole question of reason­

ableness is gone.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON W. BROWN, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN RESPONDENTS AND PETITIONERS
MR. BROWN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Courts
I will be presenting the argument in the three cases
in which the plaintiffs below are the respondents? those are
Nos. 75-62, 75-66, and 75-278.

My co-counself Mr. Boggs? will

present argument in the case in which the plaintiffs below
are the petitioners, that is No. 75-306,

the issues in that

latter proceeding pertaining to the matter of attorneys fees
and the applicable statute of limitations in this case.
In ray argument concerning the question of whether
private schools may diecriminate on the basis of race, the
matter really- resolves its a If, as Mr. Justice Stewart has just
indicated, to two essential problems.

One, whether 42 TJ.S.

1981 applies as a matter of statutory construction to the
finds of contracts that are at issue in this proceeding? end,
secondly, whether, if it does -apply, it is a constitutional
application of the statute, or, in other words, is there some
'do:cl of proscription' io the First Amendment which restricts
the application in this instance.
With respect to the first issue of the statute, the
Court ha a indicates, pr evioi.sly, of course, that the two pro­
visions of the 1863 Civil Rights Act should be read in a
literal way.

That was the plain holding in Jones V. Mayer,

52
and it has been the holding in the Sullivan v. Little Hunting
Park* and Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven Recreational Association,
*

and indeed it is the essence of the holding in Johnson v.
Railway Express Agency.

Those are the four cases in which

the Court has previously passed on the 1866 Civil Rights Act,
The plain words, of course, of section 1981 are easy
to understand.

They are simply that all persons shall have

the same right to make and enforce contracts as white citizens.
The. term "make and enforce contracts" is the key expression»
It has been suggested earlier that this should not
be an expansive term or term that has an expanding meaning, as
perhaps the Fourteenth Amendment has been construed.
doesn’t need to have an expanded meaning.
says.

It

It is clear what it

It refers to contracts of all kinds, and it doesn't

matter whether it is a contract of a type that might have beers
foreseen or cc<n templa ted by the Congress in 1866 or r.\o t.
Now, there obviously are some limitations: when you
get to the question of whether the First Amendment might limit
it, but for: the moment srs are talking about, the literal appli­
cation of section 1981.
CCESTIOSs

Mr. Brown, don't you think there might

bs some significance to the difference in the introductory
language between 1983. and 1982, one saying all persons within
the jurisdiction of the United States, as 1981 does, and 1982
starting with different language?

53
MR. BROWNi

The different language in 1982 and the

— the language that exists in 1981 was added in 1870, Your
Honor, as a result oi: the Civil Rights Act of 1970? and it was
designed to encompass within the protection of 1981 non­

citizens or aliens.
QUESTIONj
MR. BROWN;
QUESTION?

Senator Stewart’s amendment basically?

I beg your pardon?
Senator Stewart of Nevada was the one

who introduced it.
*

MR. BROWNs

I am not certain about it, Your Honor,

but that I think is what you are referring to with respect to
the different introductory language.
QUESTIONs

Well, wasn’t he thrusting basically at a

Fourteenth Amendment type of right, rather than the Thirteenth
Amendment?
MR. BROWNs

Well, Your Honor, if you are suggesting

that — if 1 understand you, are you suggesting that 1981 re­
quires state action?
QUESTION;

Well, I am suggesting that that would be

— on a clean slate, that might be a very logical inference,
where you wouldn't get that sort of an inference from 1982,
'based, as it. was held to be in Jones, or, the Thirteenth Amend­
ment .
MR. BROWNS

Well, knowing we are on a clean slate,

because there are several decisions which we are building on,

54

and, secondly, this Court has examined that legislative his­
tory,

Mr, Justice Blackmun, in writing the decision in

Tillman v, Wheaton-Haven, referred, for example, to the fact
that in the 1879 act, Congress reenacted what is now section
1981 in verbatim, and it also in another section said we are
hereby adopting and reenacting all of the 1866 act.

Now, it

seems —
QUESTIONS

statutes?

question, sir.

/

MR. BROWNt
Honor.

Wall, I can*t respond to this, Your

I am not certain of this,

I didn't anticipate this

line of questioning, because X thought the issue had been
well settled by the Court*r opinions in Tillman and Johnson v.
Railway Express.

56
QUESTION?

It has been settled.

The question is

whether it was well settled.
MR. BROWN%

Oh.

[Laughter]
QUESTION:

There is a lot of thought that it had

been well settled before Jones v. Mayer.
QUESTION:

That involved 1982.

QUESTION:

Well, a very similar question.

MR. BROWN?

Yes, Your Honor, I realize that.

Well, if I might proceed, as far as the application
of section 1981, as we say, we think that to the contracts
that are involved here, we do think that the matter has been
settled by Jones and Tillman and Johnson, and we think that
it would be a surprising development indeed if it were not
well settled, that the statute does apply here.
Now, the argument has been made by the schools here
in their arguments before the Court that this involves a
coercion, the making of a contract, this matter of prohibiting
the person who offers to make ''die contract from, conditioning
it on the ground of race.

This Court, however, in upholding

the 1964 Civil Rights Act, for example, made it very clear
-chat a person he-

no constitutional right to discriminate,

when Congress has said that patrons of a business establish­
ment or another type of establishment

may not be selected on

the basis of race, that this does not deprive the individual

5?
of any rights- any constitutional rights, rights of due pro­
cess or property or liberty, that there is no deprivation of
Fifth Amendment rights by Congress enacting this type of a
statute.
The argument has also been made here in the brief
by Fairfax-Brewster School and has been repeated again today
that in enacting the Civil Rights Act of 1866, Congress did
not intend, or that there is legislative history which would,
indicate that Congress did not intend the Act to cover private
schools®

We submit that this is an enlarged reading of the

legislative history.

We5ve discussed this in this orange

reply brief that we filed in the case, where this issue had
been raised, and we pointed out that there had been a clause
that had been included in the original bill which prohibited
that said there shall be no discrimination in civil rights.
Some of the persons, principally Congressman Bingham, for
example, of Ohio, who objected to this language and there
were many others who argued that this would have the effect of
interfering with various state segregation laws, that is state
imposed segregation of schools, juries, et cetera, that they
had at that time.
Fla and others felt that — that is Congressman
Bingham and others — felt that the matter of discriminatory
state action should he doalt with in another amendment to the
Constitution, and. indeed at. that time the Fourteenth Amendment

58
was then being drafted.

So consequently, when this language

that has been referred to by the counsel for Fairfax-Brewster
was — the statements that were being made by Congressman
Wilson, where he said we don't intend this amendment to apply
to schools, they were really saying they didn't want — the
proponents of the 1866 Act did not — they were trying to
save it from these attacks, and they were trying to say we do
not intend this Act to nullify state discrimination laws.
There is no evidence at all that they had any reference, any
intention, to have? their language referred to private schools.
They were trying to say, as I say, ultimately they
agreed in the amendment that Congressman Bingham was propos­
ing, which then eliminated this no discrimination in civil
rights clause.

The Thirteenth Amendment — rather, the 1866

Act was then enacted in its present form, and there has been
no — there is really no evidence in the legislative history
as to exactly what kind of contracts Congress really had in
mind.

It is a very vague

it is very generalised language,

the legislative history itself takes up many pages of the
Congressional Globe of that era, but it leaves very little
evidence, it provides very little evidence of eactly what
Congress was talking about.
However, this Court has held, and other courts have
hale, that this phrase "giving blacks the same right to make
and enforce contracts as white citizens," that this language

59
is broad enough to cover employment contracts, that it will
cover contracts concerning the admission to amusement parks or
admission tickets to amusement parks? another case has held
that it covers the guest privileges of private swimming clubs
— I am referring now to cases that are cited in our brief —
it has been held, and this is significant here, that this
statutory term covers privately owned, a privately owned
barber trade school, it was held to cover a privately owned
law school, a purchase of insurance policy, admissions to —
QUESTION:
in terms of schools.

Let me ask you a hypothetical question,
Suppose a particular community, a diplo­

matic community in Washington establishes a school on property
not covered by diplomatic immunity, and the requirement for
admission to the school is that one or more, one or both of
the parents be nationals of a Spanish-speaking country, and
this would be obviously the diplomatic community's means of
preserving the culture and the background of their children.
Do you think 19SI reaches it?
MR. BROWNs
QUESTION:

Well, 1931 has been applied to —
I am assuming, of course, that you have

an application of some person who doesn’t fit that category
and —
MR. BROWN:

If you just said Spanish-speaking, I

wouldn’t think that 19il proscribed it.

Now, where Spanish­

speaking takes or a racial — is used in a racial context, it

60
has been held to apply, and indeed there is a case precisely
like that that we cited in our brief involving a tavern in
Oregon that prohibited Spanish from being spoken there.

This

was used as a basis for primarily — the owner argued — for
minimizing the. chances of racial antagonisms between MexicanAmericans and Caucasian Americans.

And when the Spanish­

speaking — there was Spanish spoken by Mexic&n-Americaaa ,
The Court held this constituted racial discrimination when
they 'were excluded from the tavern as a result.
All I am saying, Your Honor, in answer to your ques­
tion, that then 1981 only applies to racial discrimination in
its present form, that's all, it doesn’t cover any other kinds
of discrimination*
QUESTION*

Then assuta® further that the claim is

made that in operative effect this excluded racial groups,
MR, BROWNs

Well, it seems to me that it would be

arguable that them it carae within the. proscription of 1981,
QUESTIONs

Mr. Brown, in light of your comment that

you construe 1981 as applying only to racial discrimination,
does that suggest that you disagree with counsel for petitione
who stated here fifteen or twenty minutes ago that if you
prevail, the principle would apply to all-girl schools, allboy schools?
MR, BROWNj

No, sir, not on the question we are

talking about here, the portion of the construction of this

statute.

This statute was enacted pursuant to the Thirteenth

Amendment, and, aside from this question that Your Honors
heard argued last week in the McDonald case, involving the
question of whether whites have a course of action under 1981,
this does not prosecribe anything but. racial discrimination,
so far as any of the cases indicate, or the legislative history
would indicatee
QUESTION:

In your view, 1981 does not embrace whites

or the rights of whites?

QUESTION:

Well, that was only last week.

MR. BROWNs

That was the McDonald case.

QUESTION:

In any case, as I understand it, it is

your submission and your understanding that you are imparting
to us that whoever may be the permissible plaintiff under
section 1981r the only cause of action that can be stated

MR. BROWN:

Yes, sir, no question about that in my

view.
QUESTION:

So it would not apply, in your view, to

an all-boys school or an all-girls school, so that the
opposite sex would have a. contractual right to enter?
MR. BROWN:

I do not believe so, Your Honor.

could be wrong, but I don’t, believe that case has been

Certainly, the issue isn't presented here.

Whether somebody will bring a case proposing such a theory, I
don't knew.
QUESTION;

Do you know of any case anywhere that

has construed section 1981 to ba applicable to anything except
racial discrimination?
Ml. BROWN*

No, I do not know of any case.

There

was a question at one time as to whether it covered aliens, I
believe, Mexican-Miericans, but 1 think that was resolved.

I

think some case had been brought asserting the right of women,
but I don't think it has been successful, that is asserting
that women have a cause of action for sex discrimination, but

civil rights language.

As I understood your position,, it is

that you acknowledge that the elimination of that language
evidences an. intent not to have the statute apply to state
operated integrated schools —
MR. BROW;
QUESTIONs

Yes,, sir.
— but that leaves open the question then

of whether it applies to privately operated schools?
MR« BROWN;
QUESTION;

Yea, sir.
And do you think it is probable that.

Congress would have first legislated against private discrim­
ination and, secondly, reserved the question of public inte­
gration?

I am just trying to gat your position in the —
MR. BROWN;

Your Honor, the fact was that in a his­

torical context it happened concurrently, you know,- because at
the same time the 1866 Act was in Congress, I think they called
'it the Committee of Reconstruction,, a committee of — a joint
committee of Congress, which wag actively engaged in -drafting
the Fourteenth Amendment, so I think it is my view, from
reading the legislative history, and I have read a fair amount
of it; that:, they were really sort of compartmentalizing what
they were doing.

They intended to reach private discrimination

with the Thirteenth Amendment or with the 1866 Act — excuse
rae —* and that they intended the Fourteenth Amendment to cover
::nat’v discrimination or s cate action discrimination«

65
QUESTION:

And. Congressman Bingham, who proposed

the amendment of this legislation, was at the same time a
member of that committee that was actively engaged in drafting
the Fourteenth Amendment.
MR. BROWNt

He was the principal voice on it, yes,

sir.
Just one more thing I would like to call the Court's
attention to.

One question of trying to discern the intent of

Congress with respect to schools, if you read Brown v. Board
cf Education, again, the Court kind of threw up its hands at
that point, after having been deluged with extensive briefs
on this whole question of what was the intent of Congress in
enacting the Fourteenth Amendment.

In fact, the Court issued

these special questions to the litigants and saying what did
Congress intend, did it intend to cover schools, and the Court
said in its opinion that the intent of Congresses of that
period were very difficult to discern, if not impossible,
therefore, we have to resort to contemporary landmarks at this
time in trying to find out whether we think it is permissible
or not, that is, state imposed discrimination in the schools.
My only point is that this Court in a sense has al­
ready held that it is — that the intent of Congress is diffi­
cult if not impossible to discern vis-a-vis schools in that
period.
QUESTION:

Just to summarize it once more, what you

66

are saying, I understand the point that the deliberations over
the Fourteenth Amendment were focused on state action and
therefore that problem might have been reserved.

You must foe

sayingP if 1 understand it correctly, that if we use the
phrase "badge of slavery/' that private discrimination in
schools — discrimination in private schools would foe a badge
of slavery, but discrimination in a public operated school
would not be a badge of slavery, within the Thirteenth Amend­
ment framework?
MR. BROWN:

Yes, I think that is the way you would

have to read it.
QUESTION:
MR. BROWN:
QUESTION:

That must be what you are -Yes, sir.
Were there in fe,ct between .1365 and 1870

public school systems in all of the states?
MR. BROWN:

the states, Your Honor.

course --QUESTION:
MR. BROWN:

Yes — and I guess they in most in­

stances operated on a segregated basis, and this was what some
of the conservatives in the Congress at that time were object­
ing to about this language in the .1866 Act, which —
QUESTION:

You don't mean in all of the states, that

they were segregated, do you?

67
MR. BROWNs

No, I don’t really know.

I mean I have

not seen any clear evidence of a survey of this whole question.
QUESTIONS

was in Boston, Massachusetts in 1850Ss, Roberts v. City of
Boston.

MR. BROWN;

I just really don’t know the answer to

that, Your Honor»
If I might proceed to — as I said, what seems to me
to be the second crucial question in the case, namely whether
there is any right or reason for exempting privately owned
schools, non-public schools from the thrust of section 1981,
it seems to me this breaks down into two facets.

The first

i

~~ and two identifiable points here — the first one, it seems
to me, concerns the matter of whether there is an institu­
tional privacy that, these schools can assert, and then,
secondly,, whether there is a right of privacy, a personal
privacy that the parents can assert on behalf of their chil­
dren or behalf of their — that is an expression of their

right, to raise and control the education of their children
the way they wish to.
With respect to the institutional privacy — and the
reason I break it down is because in a sense the Court — it
seems to me they come from two different frames of the law,
two different lines of decisions.

On the question of the in­

stitutional privacy and whether these schools are in fact
selective and are therefore in a position to assert a privacy
and a right of exclusion, I would point out, first of all, as
the record shows, that the schools — both of these schools
advertise in the Yellow Pages of the phone book, that is both
the defendant schools, they have open enrollments, they
solicit patrons and enrollments in the community where they
are located, and I would say, in addition, the record does not
show anything to the contrary so far as these schools that
are represented by the Southern Independent School Association.
Indeed, it is well known that the reason these
schools exist and are able to continue in existence is because
they attract and solicit

their enrollments are open, I

should say, to everyone in communities where there is courtordered desegregation of schools, and that they have become
— and they are perpetuate-:, because they have a constant in­
flow of white students.

Bo as far as we are to know, they are

open to all white persons in the community.

The Court, in Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park and in

69
Tillman v. Wheaton Haven Recreation Association, had a much
more

difficult question before it, it seems to me, in this

regard, because there you are concerned with neighborhood
swimming pools and recreation associations, which really con­
form much more closely to the conventional concept of what is
a private institution.

But the Court held in the Sullivan

case, and it held in the Tillman case, that those two associ­
ations were not. "truly private" because they had no plan or
purpose of exclusiveness.

They were open to every white

person in the areas they served, there being no selective
element other than race.

Now, it seems to me that that

language really covers these schools.

They have no plan or

purpose of exclusiveness: any of these schools, and they are
open to everyone in the communities or the areas that they
serve, and race is the only factor that constitutes an abso­
lute bar.
New, of course, they do have other selective
characteristics, but then so did the swimming pools in the
Sullivan and Tillman casos.

The memberships in those associ­

ations were subject to approval of the board of directors and
they had various other kinds of geographic and financial
qualifications, but race became the absolute bar.
Now, again, with respect to schools, government
regulation of schools is a very common thing.

As Mr. Justice

Relinquish mentioned earlier in the course of the argument.

70
there are state regulations that have been in existence for
years that govern such matters as curriculum? teacher quali­
fications,, and various other — and academic standards, and
so forth.
Now, the other very important and very significant
thing is that in 1972 Congress, as we noted in our brief,
Congress amended Title VII of the fair employment provisions
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to apply them to private
schools.

There had originally been an exemption for educa­

tional institutions in Title VII, but Congress repealed that
in 1972 and made Title VII applicable to private schools.
Now, it would certainly be incongruous in the ex­
treme for the Court to say that the schools could apply racial
criteria in their selection of students, where Congress has
at the same time said that they may not use race as a criteria
in selecting faculties.

If any school has 15 or more employ­

ees,. they are subject to Title VII under the Civil Rights Act.
That is an important consideration to be borne in mind in
considering the issue here, it seems to me.
I would also point out that, as we have in our
brief, there are 16 states that have non-discrimination educa­
tion laws, 16 states that have adopted laws which prohibit
discrimination in admissions policies.

Many of these, a

number of these are modeled after, are fashioned after a model
law that has been promulgated by the National Conference of

71
Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, so obviously it wouldbe a surprise to the persons who drafted those laws and the
legislatures that have enacted them for the Court to say that
it is unconstitutional to somehow prohibit schools from dis­
criminating on the basis of race.

That, of course, would

be the effect of a holding against the plaintiffs in this
case.
Now, it seems to me
QUESTION:

You mean a constitutional holding

against the plaintiffs?
MR. BROWN:
QUESTION:

I beg your pardon?
You mean that would be the effect of a

constitutional holding against the plaintiffs?

I suppose

it would be possible for the Court to decide that 1981
didn't reach, which would have no constitutional implications
at all?
MR. BROWN:

Yes, sir.

New, the next face of the constitutional argument
is the one X alluded to earlier, which is what I think is
really involved here.

There have been references made by

opposing counsel to right of association and the freedom of
persons to express their beliefs and right of privacy and
go

forth, which I don't think quite hit the real issue.
It seems to me that the proper term, an appro­

priate term, let's say, an apt term was used by Professor

72
Lewis Henkin —- and we don't refer to this in our brief, but
there is an interesting article by Professor Lewis Henkin in
72 Columbia Law Review, at page 1410, in which he refers to
autonomy as being an accurate perhaps description of what this
Court has talked about in some of its privacy cases, that what
we are really talking about here perhaps is the matter of
familial autonomy.
Now, 1 am saying this because I want to make clear
what I think might be a helpful frame of reference for the
Court in its analysis of the issue.
The cases from which the right of privacy flows,
which have been the basis for the constitutional right of pri­
vacy as it has been explicated by the Court, of course, are
Griswold v. Connecticut, Sisenstadt v. Baird, Stanley v.
Georgia, and Roe v« Wade.
cases.

Those are basically the privacy

They deal with such matters as marriage, procreation,

contraception, what are essentially family relationships.
they are not all really privacy.

But

They don't involve necessarily

an invasion of privacy so much as they involve the state's
interference with the ability to act freely and according to
one's own personal dictates.
New, acllrd to that line of cases are the other two
cases which the Court has frequently referred to, Pierce v.
Society 'of Sisters and Meyer v. Nebraska.

Pierce v. Society of

Sisters, of course, was a situation where the state had said

73
that in effect private schools couldn’t exist, all persons had
to send their children to public schools.

And Meyer v.

Nebraska, of course, was an attempt to restrict the teaching
of foreign languages in'private schools.

And those cases are

the essence of or sort of the basis, I should say, of what has
been referred to as the right and liberty of persons to direct
the education and up-bringing of their own children.
Now, we don’t in any way dispute this, that this
right exists.

We could not.

However, in

case of Norwood

v. Harrison, Mr. Chief Justice Burger, writing the opinion,
referred to the Pierce case, for example, and at page 461 of
the Court's opinion in Norwood, the opinion says, "As Mr.
Justice White observed in his concurring opinion in Yoder,
Pierce held simply that while a state may posit [educational]
standads, it may not pre-empt the educational process by re­
quiring children to attend public schools," and that is exatly the point.

In Pierce and in Meyer v. Nebraska, the Court

said very clearly that the state, through its police powers,
has a right to posit educational standards and other kinds of
regulations that are necessary to control the manner in which
schools are operated.
Now, parents do not have complete autonomy in how
they raise their children, and it is well engrained in our
legal system today.

Compulsory school laws have been upheld

everywhere that they have been challenged.

Parents have

74
objected to compulsory school laws on moral,» religious and
constitutional grounds*, but they have never been successfully
challenged,, that is such laws.
QUESTION?

Are there any states that, do not permit

an equivalent education by private tutors?
MR, BROWN:

I do not believe so.

I do not believe

so, Your Ho nor.
The other case which is an important one to bear in
mind is Prince v. Massachusetts, where a person used her child
for the purpose of selling religious tracts, and the state
prosecutor of the State of Massachusetts prosecuted the
parent on the ground that it was a violation of the stats
child labor law, and this Court held that notwithstanding the
very sacred right, if you will, of the parent to control the
chi id8 s activity and particularly there, where the child was
being used in a religious way or as an expression of religious
belief, that notwithstanding the importance and the high pri­
ority given these rights, the state still had a legitimate
interest and the right to control that chiId5s upbringing and
interfere —- I don't acan to control the upbringing, but to
require the parent to abide by the child labor laws.

The Court

said that the state has a wide range of power for limiting
parental freedom and authority in things affecting the child’s
welfare, ana this includes to soma extant matters of conscience
and religious conviction.

75
So we submit that, notwithstanding the expressions
of conscience, the expressions that we’ve heard here about
belief that segregated education is a superior form of educa­
tion,, that the state here may legitimately in a constitutional
sense tell parents that, if you are going to send your child
to school and you are required to by the compulsory education
laws, they have to go to school under the conditions that we,
the state, have found to be most appropriate in a democratic
society.
I would just in closing like to add one word, and
that is that 1 think it is very significant that we have in
this case the support of the Solicitor General of the United
States and also the Council for American Private Education,
the National Association of Independent Schools, and the
Southern Association of Independent Schools.

This comprises

the majority of the educational industry, if you will, in the
United States, and they .are saying to this Court that they do
not believe that the Court’s affirmance of the courts below
will interfere with the way they operate the schools or that
they will interfere with the right of parents who send their
children to those schools to control the? education of their
children unduly.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Hoggs.

Very well, Mr. Brown.

76

CRM, ARGUMENT OF RODERIC V. 0, BOGGS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN RESPONDENTS AND PETITIONERS
MR. BOGGSs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
There are two additional issues which I would like to
address this afternoon.

The first concerns the award of

attorneys fees in this case by the District Court,-, which was
subsequently reversed by the Court of Appeals.

The second in­

volves the appropriate statute of limitations to be applied to
a 1981 action brought in the state of Virginia.

The Fourth

Circuit Court of Appeals in this case applied the two-year
personal injury statute of limitations and petitioners seek to
apply the five-year statute of limitations.
Turning first to the question of attorneys fees, we
submit that there are two bases under which attorneys fees
could appropriately be supported as an award in this case.

The

first involves the up;; lication of the bad-faith exception to
the American rule? and the second involves a finding of an ex­
plicit statutory authorisation to award fees in section 1988 of
42 U.S. Code.
Before discussing the attorney fee issue, however, in
detail with these theories, I would like to note briefly the
manner in which■the attorney fee question was raised in the
course of this litigation.

We think it is quite important to

vote that in this case the District Court, at the conclusion of

77
the trial awarded $2,000 in attorneys fees without, however,
hearing argument on this question and without making any
specific findings as to the basis for the award of fees.
Xfc is also, of course, important to note that this
case arose before this Court's decision in Alyeska.

On appeal,

only the private attorney general theory was briefed and
argued.

Subsequently, in the Court Circuit's opinion in this

case, the private attorney general theory was held inapplicable
and by a 4**3 margin, the Court of Appeals found that no badfaith was present on the record before it.

I would think

possibly of importance to the Court was the absence of any
findings of bad-faith were made explicitly by the District
Court.
We would note# however, that the general pattern
which has been seen in cases considered by Circuit Courts
since this Court's decision in Alyeska has seen remands to
District Courts in circumstances where the private attorney
general theory had been utilised to award fees

but no basis

for bad-faith had been explicitly recognised and discussed by
Courts of Appeals.
We would therefore suggest that, at a minimum in
this case, based cn the record, a remand would be necessary
should tills Court, be unable to agree with our conclusions from
the record that bad**faith has amply been made out before the
Dis trict Court

78

QUESTIONS

I would be interested in your bad-faith

point.
MR. BOGGSs
QUESTION:

Excuse me, Your Honor?
I had difficult in. finding your bad-faith

point.
MR. BOGGSs

Well, I 'would like to turn now specific­

ally to the question of bad-faith in this case.

We believe

that the bad-faith in this case is constituted not by the de­
fense by these schools of what they believe to be their constifcutional rights to refuse admission to black students, but
snore by the manner in which they have asserted this defense,
specifically by their repeated denials under oath of having
refused tct admit these children on the basis of their race»
The Court of Appeals found it quite important, in
considering this question, in finding and stating that they
believe faults of perception and memory could have accounted
for the testimony that was given on several occasions by de­
fendants1 witnesses.

We, however, submit that a review of the

record of this case will show that there is no question of
perception or memory in the conduct of defendants? quite the
contrary is true.
In the case of the Gonzales children and the FairfaxBrewster School in particular, there is testimony by three
members of the staff of that school that they remember fully
the circumstances under which Colin Gonzales applied.

They

79
remembered that he had bean rejected not because of his race,
because they claimed there was no policy of racial discrimin­
ation, but rather they claimed that he was rejected because he
had not had sufficient preschool experience,

MR. BOGGS:
QUESTION:

Well, that is witnesses,
That is witnesses, but it is also —
Ue11, what about the bad-faith of the

parties?
MR. BOGGS:

The partias in this instance I think are

much the same, three individuals involved were the directore.
In fact, they constitute the administration entirely of the
school.
We would submit, Your Honor,- that this testimony
under oath cannot be accounted for on the basis of perception
and memory, and in fact can only be seen as a deliberate
attempt '.by the defendants to deceive the court and to protect
this litigation.

It must be remembered that, as a result of

that testimony, the result of that, position —

No, we would disagree with that. Your

Wait, now.

Did they assert a First

MR. BOGGS:

They asserted a constitutional —

QUESTION:

Is the First Amendment a constitutional

MR. BOGGS s
QUESTION;

They did assert a. constitutional right.
And it is pretty hard to find any bad-

faith when you are asserting a constitution£;l right, isn’t it?
MR. BOGGS:

We do not submit that there is any bad-

faith in their assertion of a constitutional right.

The bad-

faith in this case cones not from the constitutional defense
but the manner in which they denied the .underlying facts of
discrimination under oath and in a wav which could not possibly
in our judgment be caused by failures of perception and memory,
-and we would submit that there was ample case authority from
this Court and from the circuits which distinguish quite
clearly between litigation conduct, the giving of disingenuous
testimony —
QUESTION:

t?ovr two other federal courts have already

passed on this issue, have they not?
MR. BOGGS:
Honor.

1 don't believe you could say two, Your

The Court of Appeals did review this directive without

the benefit of findings from the District Court.■ The District
Court, as we pointed out initially,

reached .its conclusions we

believe on the basis of the private attorney general theory.

81
It made no findings as to credibility, in explicit sense.

How­

ever, we would note that in commenting on this testimony of
the three witnesses, the three administrative people from
Fairfax-Brewster School, the District Court explicitly found
that the court rejects this testimony as unbelievable and finds
that the reason for the rejection was because Colin Gonzales
was black.
In other words, we are saying, as this Court in fact
made quite clear in the case of Hall v. Cole several years ago,
that in determining and looking at bad-faith, we must distin­
guish between deceptive litigation conduct and the putting
forward of a constitutional defense of some kind.

That dis­

tinction we think is very clear in this case, and if you review
the record carefully I think we submit you will come to the
same conclusion tiat we have, that there is a distinction here.
We aren’t questioning the right of either of these
schools to make a constitutional defense.
that they have not done just that.

We claim though

They have extended this

litigation unduly, put us through the necessity of interroga­
tories, a two-day trial on the question of discrimination it­
self, not the constitutional aspect of the case, and required
us beyond that to pursue this question of credibility on to
the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.

In fact, in listening to

the argument of counsel for the schools this morning, I would
submit that the question of credibility is still being argued

82

to some extent by them»
QUESTIONS

Well, at least three of the seven members

of the Court of Appeals indicated that they were far from convinced that the District Court was right in its finding of
facts, in other words that they were far from convinced .that
your opponents were correct in the factual assertions that
they made.

Now, that certainly detracts from any inference of

bad-faith, doesn't it?
MR. BOGGS:

Well, I think if this Court is not con­

vinced the way we are, Mr, Justice Stewart, that the appropri­
ate course would be to send this case back to the trial court.
After all, bad-faith, as many cases — we cite some of them —
make clear, when bad-faith is an issue, the court relies
heavily upon trial court discretion, in fact the case is made
clear that in. the absence of clearly erroneous judgments by
the trial court, a finding of bad-faith must be. sustained on
appeal.

The problem here is simply that that wasn't made.

suggest, the record leads to that conclusion.

We

There is obvious­

ly a difference of opinion on that question, and if this Court
disagrees with us, we think a remand on that question would be
required.
QUESTION:

Alyeska was decided after the Court of

Appeals decision in this case?
MR. BOGGS:
Court of Appeals —

Alyeska was decided after the initial

83

QUESTION:
MR. BOGGS:
QUESTION:

How long after?
Almost simultaneously.
Was there a petition for rehearing of any

kind in the Court of Appeals —
MR. BOGGS:
QUESTION:
MR. BOGGS:

There was a petition for rehearing.
--- based on Alyeska?
I am not sure it was based on Alyeska.

It was before Alyeska but during the time that petition was
pending, Alyeska was handed down and, for that reason, the
three judges in dissent

who raised the private attorney general

theory withdraw that aspect of their opinion but maintained
their position in regard to bad-faith.
I would also suggest, Your Honor, that in looting at
bad-faith, this Court has at least on one occasion made it
clear that it is particularly sensitive to questions of badfaith in matters of racial discrimination,.

1 would call the.

Court’s attention to its decision in Newman v. Biggie Park
Enterprises, where the Court, in a footnote. Footnote 5, I
believe, specifically cited as. an example of bad-faith the
raising of a defense regarding the denial of discrimination,
which was subsequently withdrawn prior to trial, and cited that
as an example of vexatious litigation tactics.
QUESTION:

As you have just indicated, far from be­

ing withdrawn prior to trial, it is still being asserted here.
in this case

84
MR. BOGGS:

That1s right.

I think that this Court,

if this Court doss not agree with our interpretation of that,
which is in our judgment is a fortiori

situation, in other

words maintaining a vexatious defense even to trial, fee proper
i

course is a remand on that issue.
The second theory which we would like to submit to
the Court justifies the award of attorneys fees in this case
is found in examination of section 1988 of 42 U„3. Code.

This

section was originally the third section of the 1866 Civil
Rights Act.
We submit that 1988 provides for this Court the
specific legislative guidance which after Alyeska appears to
be required in order to find the authority to grant, attorneys
fees absent one of the generally recognized exceptions to the
American rule.
As this Court I believe is familiar from its de­
cisions in other cases dealing with 1.988, the language of that
provision speaks in terms of the jurisdiction of courts in
civil rights cases being exercised in conformity with the laws
of the United States so far as such laws are suitable to carry
the same into affect, and to the extent that those laws are
not fully adopted, the Court may then look to state laws
modified by common law, as long as it is consistent with the
federal law.

We believe that this section provides an explicit

85

invitation, to seek remedies to make fully effective the 1886
Act and in fact other civil rights provisions of Chapter 21 of
42 U.S.C.
We would also like to submit and state that this
Court has recognized the ability that it possesses tc apply
the 186S Act f section 1988 f, to draw upon federal law to make
fully whole victims of discrimination in determining appropriate:
relief and remedies, and we would cite for that proposition the
case of Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, in which the Court —
and I quote — stated "as we read section 1988, both federal
and state rules on damages may be utilized, whichever best
serves the policies expressed in the federal statute." We
therefore suggest that as an appropriate course for this Court
to follow, to draw upon the private attorney general provisions
of later enacted statutes which allow the award of attorneys
■fees, in civil rights cases.
Wa think no less is required to fully effectuate the
purposes of the 1866 Civil Rights Act.
Finally, Your Honors, I would like to turn my atten­
tion to the question of the statute of limitations that has
been applied in this case.

The Fcmrfc Circuit Court of Appeals

applied in this case the two-year statute of limitations which
is taken from the personal injury provisions of Virginia Code,
section 8-24.

This section, which had first been applied in

1972 in the case of Almond v* Kent, that being an 1983 action,

86
involving a suit in which a citizen had been beaten allegedly
by the police, was in fact a personal injury case»- a physical
injury case, as well as a constitutional case.
The Court in that instance was choosing between, the
application of the two-year limit for personal injuries and a
one-year limit based on transitory torts.

It chose, in. a. way

that was quite helpful to the plaintiff in that case, the twoyear limit.

Subsequently, the logic applied in that case to a

1983 action has been applied to section 1981 and 1982 «actions,
but of course they do not involve necessarily and normally do
not involve explicit physical injury.
We submit, that the classification —
QUESTIONS

But neither docs 1983 — 1983, while it '

might have in that case have involved personal injuries, the
cause of action is a violation of federal constitutional or
statutory law, is it not?
MR. BOGGS:
Honor.

No, we absolutely agree with that, Your

We think that is one reason —
QUESTION:

Physical injuries are only part of that

■cause of action.
MR. BOGGSs

Precisely, and that is exactly the

reason why we think neither 1981, 1932 nor .1983 actions should
be equated for purposes of analogy with physical personal in­
jury.

We would state here parenthetically that it is interest

lag to note that in Virginia law, application within the state

8?
of Virginia* that two-year lissit, to the best of our ability
to research the question, .is only applied to cases of physical
bodily injury* and there is no case that has been cited to us
in opposing briefs or that we have been able to research which
applies it any place else

except in the area of civil rights.

And it is for that reason that we think that in searching for
the most analogous statute of limitations, which is a course
that federal courts are obliged to fake, and federal statutes
are silent on that question, the appropriate thing to do is to
look at the second section of that Virginia statute which
specifies that in personal actions for which no ' '•'•••*<- i ■?
otherwise prescribed, a five-year limit should be adopted if
the cause of action is found to survive, and a one-year limit
is to be applied if the cause does not survive*
We would, applying that analysis, suggest that a
five-year statute is dictated by virtue of the fact that even
in the opinion of the Fourth Circuit in Almond v. Kent in the
4

first instances, there was no question but that the federal
right under 1983 — and we would suggest under 1981 and 1982,
as well — would survive on the basis of generally accepted
federal principles.
Because of that. Your Honors, we suggest that the
appropriate resolution of this case on the statute of limitations is to hold that for the purposes of analogy the state of
Virginia, the five-year statute of limitations is the

88

appropriate one to be applied.
QUESTIONS

This goes just to the damages in just one

of the cases, is that correct?
MR. BOGGS %

That's right.

The way this issue arises.,

Mr. Justice Stewart, is that in the case of the Gonzales
family, the parents were not entitled, were ruled not able to
bring this case, because the statute of limitations barred
them.

They filed the suit three and a half yeasr approximately

after the cause of action eirose.
QUESTION?

That is just one of the cases?

MR. BOGGS: That's right.

We would suggest in that

case that the appropriate course of action would be a remand
for relief not inconsistent with the findings.
Thank you. Your Flonor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

case is submitted.
