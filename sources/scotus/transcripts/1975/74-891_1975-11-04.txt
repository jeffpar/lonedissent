ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARSON P, PORTER ON
BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. PORTERS
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

I am here today on behalf of the petitioners,

the Chiefs of Polices of Louisville, Kentucky, and Jefferson
County, Kerntucky.
This case arises out of a factual situation which
began when the respondent was arrested for shoplifting in a
Louisville retail store back in the summer of 1971«

Subsequently,

in September of 1971 this individual had his cas® by his
motion‘filed away with leave"which under Kentucky law
constitutas & general continuance of the charges of shoplifting.
Subsequently, in December ©f 1972, the petitioners sent a
flier to a number of merchants in our community indicating
that the persona named in that flier had been arrested for
shoplifting in the past two years and war® "active shoplifters,,89
QUESTIONi

There is quit© a difference between the

two e isnS! t there?
MR. PORTERi

I don't think there is any question

about that, Mr. Chief Justice.
the cas®.

And that's the real heart of

4
Subsequently, the respondent, after finding out about
the circulation of this flier, had the status of his ea.s©
changed on his motion from filed away, fra® the general
continuance status, and the criminal charge was changed to
"dismissed.
He -then brought an action or attempted to do so in
the United States District Court for the Western District of
Kentucky, under 42 U.S.C. 1983, and right there, I think, is
the nut of this case;, th® question being, in short, Did the
respondent bring his action in the right court?
Wa submitted to the district court that the
respondent had failed to state a claim under section 1983
for, in fact, the allegations which he set forth by the
factual circumstances I just recited th© statement of acfciv®
shoplifters, no question, that's different from his status
as an arrested person®

But that constitutes in our estimation

and in the estimation of the district court in Kentucky at
bast an allegation of defamation which is cognisable in the
circuit courts of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and not under
1983.

They contended in their complaint that the right,

privilege, or immunity which had been denied to th© respondent
was on© of two thingss

Either (a) a deprivation of his

constitutional right of privacy, or (b) a denial of due
process«
I would like to focus th© Court's attention, if you

s
will, firstly on t'hoir allegation that this gentleman had
been denied his alleged constitutional right of privacy.
We basically.submitted to th® district court, and the district
court held in his failure to state a claim decision, that
the facts of -this case did not give rise to a constitutional
protected right of privacy,

tod I think the teachings of the

Sixth Circuit says this Court — nobody in this case has
been able to sit© a decision rendered by tills Court dispositive
of this issue or where this Court has recognized &
constitutional right of privacy in the defamation area.
We have, of course, learned about Griswold for married folks
in contraceptives and Bioanstadt for unmarried people, and
th® abortion case in

Roe v„ Wade, but not what we consider

to be primarily, if not totally, a defamation case.
But th® Rinth Circuit had a similar case.

Back in

1963 they decided in a split decision York.v. Story.

In that

case th® majority taid that th® factual circumstandas there
did in fact arise to a constitutional invasion,
*

tod I would

submit to the Court that that decision was correct, and i
would embrace it, because the facts in that case

are

entirely different from th© facts in th© case at bar.
For example, in York a young lady had gone to the
local police department to complain about being rapad.

When

she got there a police officer, acting as a police officer,
took her into a room, asked her to strip nude, posed hex’ in,

6
as tli@ court said,, lewd and. lascivious poses and took
photographs of bar and than circulated the photographs to all
of his friends on the police department.
Now, I would suggest that that, as the court held,
shocked the conscience of that court, shocked my conscience,
and I think it would shock the conscience of this Court.
QUESTIONS

Well, maybe so, but you don't need to

concede th© correctness of that decision.

It may shock all

our consciences, but it may not have been a violation of any
constitutional right.

In other words, we don't hsv® that case

before us.
V

MS. POSTER:

You are exactly right, your Honor*

I was drawing that case to show what they did in the sazm
circuit six years later in a case very similar to th© on© at
bar, Baker y. Howard,

In that case the Ninth Circuit held

unanimously teat tea fact situation did not ©rise to a
constitutional deprivation.

Therein, in fact, there was

proof that Baker had had a statement alleging that he had
committed a crime broadcast to th© general public pursuant
to th© direction of tee police department over the radio
station, and he had in fact lost his job because of this.
I would submit that to be a potential denial of a property
right.

The Ninth Circuit in that case held this did not

constitute a deprivation,that this was not th© kind of case
teat was cognizable under section 1983,

7
Now, in the transcript before yon in this casa, at
the evidentiary hearing held on the motion for preliminary
injunction, which the district court denied,respondent called
two witnesses.

They called fchs employer of the respondent

for the purpose of attempting t© show to the court the loss
which respondent had suffered because of this dissemination.
But the best testimony that was advanced there was that the
employer knew about it, had thought about restricting his
employ®© * s activities as a photographer for feh@ local news­
paper, but in fact when asked by the judge, "What have you
done,” he said, “Nothing, your Honor.
against this gentleman whatsoever. *

2'v® taken no action
Some int@rost.ing

distinctions between our fact situation and Baker v. Howard.
I respectfully submit to the Court "chat if the
teaching of Baker y. Howard is correct, where the gentleman
lost his job because of the dissemination and whsr® in this
case there has been no proof advanced whatsoever of any fcyp©
of griavious injury, I respectfully submit that this case
doesn't even rise on the hierarchical ladder to Baker v.
Howard, much less approach the grievious loss in York v. Story
QUESTION:

Well, supposing that there had b®<nn an

adequate showing in your view of significant loss, as 2 read
your brief your contention is that nonetheless if th® loss
itself isn't imposed by the sovereign powers of government,
then it's not cognisable under 1983.

8
HR. PORTERs

Yea, your Honor.

What w© are saying

is while wa are admitting for ■the purposes of argomant that
th@s® actions were taken under color of law* which put us
under the first aspect of 1983, w@ ar© submitting that we do
not and we have not deprived the respondeat of any right,
privilege, or immunity guarantied by the Constitution or the
Federal laws.

Therefore» since he can’t make out a case,

he failed to state a claim advancing both propositions which
are required, w© contend that what he has basically is a
defamation case, and that he should

suing us, if he wishes

to do so, in tht circuit courts of the Commonwealth ©f Kentucky.
That is the heart of this lawsuit.
QUESTIONi

of citizenship, I

suppose Im could sue you in the Federal courts.
MR. PORTER?
QUESTIONS
pictured

No question about that, your Honor.
Were th.®r@ about 115 of these p®opi©

us shoplifters?
MR. PORTER?
QUESTION;

hara in the appendix.

There were 121 persons.
l was just looking at what is reproduced
About half or more of them are worsen.

Along with 'this Annex A that appears in the appendix on page 8.,
was that distributed to the businessmen, too?
MR. PORTER•
Honor.

That's the cover letter, I believe, youi:

Yes, sir.
QUESTION;

And how about the material on pag© 9, was

9
that distributed also to fcfoa Louisville businessman?
MR, PORTERS
Annex A.

Yes, sir.

Pag® 9 is a continuation of

That constituted the cover letter.
QUESTIONi
MR. PORTER?

I see.
And as you will note# in the o©v@r

letter they made the statement^

"These parsons have been

arrested during 1971 and 1972 f8 which is a factual statement,
"or have been active in various criminal fields in high
density shopping areas."
QUESTION t
MR. PORTERs

Sight.
The thrust of our position being -that

basically at bast those statements and the "Active Shoplifter"
label constitute nothing more than a defamation claim.
QUESTION s

And the testimony was that this had bo@n

don® repeatedly at the Christmas season?
MR. PORTER?

Yes, your Honor.

For 1.5, years .

It has not been don® since.
QUESTIONS
MR. PORTERS
QUESTIONt

It has not been done since.
No, sir.
And that businessmen when they didn't

gat their copy of this would call the police headquarters
and say, "Aren't you going to do.it again this year," or
something like that?
MR. PORTER?

Yes, your Honor.

enjoyed receiving this information.

The businessmen

I don’t think there is

10
any question about that.

Part of the thrust of our argument,

your Honor, is that the dissemination itself constituted a
legitimate law-enforcement dissemination that these persons
are charged under Kentucky st&fcufc®, the store detective, the
owner of the sto», and any merchant's employee has the right,
if not the obligation, to apprehend persons ‘they have
reasonable grounds to believe &r© shoplifting on the premises
of their store.
Because of that statutory cloak of authority, we
contend that the dissemination from the polio© department to
these merchants was a protected dissemination within lawenforcement or quasi-law-enforcement groups.

It served a

proper law-enforcement function.
The only point which the respondent might raise which
would be a legitimate concern with regard to this dissemina­
tion is the attachment of the word "Active Shoplifter” which
I contend is a gratuitous editorial comment made by the
petitioners in addition to the circulation and the dissemination«
But at best, the labeling there constitutes nothing more than
a defamation claim.
QUESTION:

That's a question of privilege that

you wouldn't be able to raise on a motion to dismiss, isn't it?
If your only ground war© to say that even though this states
a claim under 1983, we nonetheless war© privileged because
we were engaged in a legitimate law-enforcement activity.

11
foil wouldn't be able ordinarily to g©fc the complaint dismissed
where you are asserting a qualified privilege that may depend
on subjective good faith*
MR. PORTSRs

No? your Honor, we are not assarting —

we did not assert in this case th® qualified privilege as an
affirmative defense.

I would concur with your analysis there.

What X am sayingt your Honor? is that the factual
allegation did not set forth a claim cognisable under 1983
because no privilegee right? or immunity enjoyed by the
respondent vis-a-vis the Constitution or th® Federal laws
ha® been deprived.
QUESTIONS

But that's quite independent from your

position that it'© legitimate lew-enforcement activities® that
your clients were engaged in.
QUESTION %
MR. PORTERs
QUESTION s

It would b® &n affirmative defense.
Y@s? sir? I concur with that.
Evan to a defamation action that would

bn ®x% affirmative defense.
MR. PORTERs
QUESTION %

Yes? sir.

No question.

I concur.

On what ground did the court below proceed?

Was it on due process grounds?
MR. PORTERs
QUESTIONS

Yes? your Honor.
A lot of it was procedural dues process?

wasn't it?
MR. PORTERs

Your Honor? th® Sixth Circuit reversed

12
and th® thrust of their opinion was on the due process grounds
QUESTIONS

You haven't addressed that yet# have you?

MR. PORTERs I would, be delighted to do s© at this
i

point now.
QUESTIONS

I mean, before you osa say it wasn't ©

1983 action# you have to say that there wasn't properly
alleged a deprivation of procedural due process.
MR. PORTERs

2 concur with that# your Honor# and I

was attacking -QUESTIONS

Did th© court feelow suggest that even with

proper procedures th© officials couldn1t hav® don® this?
MR. PORTER?

The court below rested its ©pinion

largely on th© Wisconsin v. Constantinsau situation wherein
they were making th© thrust of their position that because of
th© labeling which took place in th® case at bar as similar
to th® posting and labeling in th® Con@tanti.neau circumstances
that as they interpreted the Constantine&u decision whenever
that is undertaken due process must be entered into prior to
tdi@ posting and labeling.
Now# w® would submit for th© Court's attention that
there are east® serious distinctions —
QUESTION s5
MR. PORTER?
QUESTION?

May I interrupt at this point?
Yes# your Honor.
Actually# after going all through lab©!

carries with it a badge ©f disgrace# and all th® rest ©f it#

13
all of this was done without fcfe® slightest regard for dxm
process.

Thera was no notice or opportunity to b@ heard prior

to th® distribution of th® flier

and th© appellant and

others have never been afforded the opportunity to refute th©
charges in a. original proceeding»
How, do I correctly read that as saying that in what,
was don® her© th©r® was denial of Federal procedural due
process?
MB.o PORTER?

i think that is their point, y®a, your

Honor»
QUESTIONS

How, if that's so, does not that allege

a violation of 1983?
MR. PORTER?

X think if that's so, there is no

question,but that it doss allege a violation of 1983.

Mid

my answer is that wo, with all &u© respect to th® Sixth
Circuit Court .of Appeals, respectfully dissent from their
©pinion in that we would draw th® following distinctions between
the CQaatanttaeau application and its application to the case
at bar;

In th® first place —
QUESTIONS

cognizable in 1983.

That doesn't m&mi you say it isn't
It just means that you would dismiss it

for failure of proof.
MR.

porters

No, your Honor, I would dismiss it for

failure to state a claim and not. h# cognizable under 1983
P

because X don't think this is a Constantineau case.

14
QUESTION:

You don't agree with the Sixth Circuit

that Constanfcineau governs this case,
MR. PORTER;

That's exactly our position, for the

following reasons;
In the first place, Wisconsin v. Constanfcineau struck
down a facially unconstitutional statute passed by the
Wisconsin legislature which said as follows, that a wife or
various members, sheriff, board of aldermen, mayor, and so forth
of a particular community could by swearing out an affidavit
supplying a picture of the appropriate person have that person,
without any other notice or hearing or whatever, the sheriff
was mandated to take that to every bar and every liquor store
in that community, post it 'there for fch® general public to see,
saying that the per,son whose picture is on this poster cannot
b® served alcoholic beverages for a period of 1 year»
Now, in the case at bar, we have no statutory mandat®,
w@ have two chiefs of police taking on their own, making a
gratuitous editorial comment, not pursuant to any kind of
direction or authority —
QUESTION;

I thought you admitted that this was State

action on their part.
MS. PORTER;

.1 did admit, your Honor, that it was

State action —
QUESTION;

You can't say they did it on their own,

they took it on the part of the State.

15
MR. PORTERs

I ezft just trying to draw the distinction,

your Honor, that but for the fact that those two gentleman war©
chiefs of police, I donst think there would be any question
but this is nothing but a defamation case and that there is
a factual distinction in the first point between the statutory
problem in Wisconsin v.» Constantineau and the actions taken
here.
Secondly, though —
QUESTION:

In Cons tantlneau what was dons was don©

under the authority of a statute of the legislature.

Her® you

have a couple of police officials just doing this out of thin
air with no -—
MR, PORTER:

I would say that the Cons tantineau

situation was worse, your Honor, because the officials in the
Constantinesu case had no choice.

When that affidavit was

signed, they had to act pursuant to their statute.
QUESTION:
MR. PORTER:
QUESTION:

They followed the Wisconsin statute.
Yes, sir,
And you say the chiefs of police her© were

not purporting to follow any statute.
MR. PORTER:
QUESTION:

No, your Honor,
Did th® State of Kentucky attach any

disabilities to these people th® way the State of Wisconsin
did to th® parson who was posted, simply as a result of -th®
circulation of this flier?

16
MR. PORTER:
about the posting.

I think there war® two important points

The first was that the Wisconsin posting

was to the general public at large.

The dissemination her® was

to this group of merchants.
Secondly -QUESTION:

As I recall, under that, all that happened

was when it was posted the liquor dealer couldn't sell the lady
any drinks, wasn't that it?
MR. PORTER:

Yes, your Honor.

Sh® was deprived of

the opportunity to purchase liquor for a year.
QUESTION:

These fellows have to go through the rest

of their lives with accusations, apparently untrue, that they
were active shoplifters.
QUESTION:

Would you finish answering my question

when you get a chance?
MR. PORTERs

Yes, your Honor.

In focussing on the attachment of the label, which I
believe was your question, Mr. Justice Relinquish, with regard
to this situation as distinguished from the Constantineau
situation, we contend to this Court that the respondent in this
particular case did not receive from this type of publication
the attachment that was passed on in Wisconsin v. Constantineau,
for one reason because of its limited circulation.
Secondly, and I think in analysing these 19£3 cases
and making a determination as to whether there has been a claim

17
asserted and when the Coart takas evidentiary proof on that
matter, as they did in this instance? respondent advanced his
evidentiary proof

as distinguished from Cons tan11neau« There

is not on® incident in the transcript of any time when the
person has been denied employment, when he has ever been
stopped in a store, when he has ever been asked about this,
other than rQUESTION%

Now you ar© going to injury.

Doesn't that

go to the injury?
MR. PORTERs

In my estimation, your Honor, and I

respectfully submit,it goes both to the injury and potential
damages to this individual and whether or not h® has been
deprived a constitutional right.

That is the reading of the

right of privacy case© from the Ninth. Circuit, th© Fifth,
and th© Third Circuit

or Second Circuit, excuse tm — in

Rosenberg v- Martin*
QUESTION!

More accurately, don’t you mean whether or

not he has been deprived of liberty or property?
MR. PORTERs

I think that’s right, your Honor, as

to whether he is entitled to due process.
QUESTION:
MR. PORTER;

You refer to th® 14th Amendment.
If we get in the due process area, I

think —
QUESTION?

That’s where we are, isn’t it?

th® theory of this complaint, was it not?

That was

18
MR., PORTER?

That was one-haIf of the theory, yes,

your Honor.
QUESTION s

And that was the basis upon which the court

of appeals for the Sixth Circuit decided the case.
MR. PORTER?
QUESTION?

Yes, your Honor.
So -the question is even though if he had

been deprived of liberty or property, what happened here might
have been a violation of due process, procedural du® process
rights.

The first inquiry is whether he has bean deprived of

liberty or property because unless h® has been, than he hasn't
been deprived of what's guaranteed to him by the 14th Amendment.
MR. PORTER?

.Hint's the reaching of the Roth case,

as I underat find it, your Honor, that unless h© can allege and
assert deprivation of liberty or property —
QUESTION?
MR, PORTER?

Deprived by the State of liberty or property
That's right, your Honor.

Ail right, now --- yes, sir.
QUESTION?

On that point, we're not giving you much

of a chance to argue your case, but maybe I can help you.
In Constaatineam the party was deprived of a very
fundamental right of liberty.

He was not allowed to buy

whisky for a year.
MR. PORTER?

Yes, your Honor.

I would consider that

to be fundamental, and grievous.
QUESTION?

All right.

Now, in this cas® fch@r© was

19
no deprivation of anything shown by fch® record.
MR. FORTERs

That's right? your Honor? that's our

contention.
QUESTION?
MR, PORTERs
QUESTION s
MR. PQRTERs

Does evidence totally back that up?
X assert that it does? your Honor.
Is there any evidence to fch® contrary?
No? your Honor.

Our position with regard to the due process question
is basically%

Is the man entitled to the full-blown due

process hearing prior to fch® time when a public official?
in this case two chiefs of police? make what amounts to a
defamatory statement about the gentleman?

Or is due process

served by an after-the-fact proceeding? which we contend in a
defamation case is cognisable in the State court?
This Court recently in Arnett v. Kennedy

in reviewing

the language of the Both case where there was an obvious
deprivation of a property interest in that that was a, civil
service employe© who had lost his job? pointed out that fch®
after-the-fact due process remedy was appropriate? that in that
procedure — and X argue this case only by analogy? not as
dispositive of our case — but that in that proceeding du®
process? not as respondent would urge in the district court
and in fch® Sixth Circuit and in their briefs? but fche.fc due
process can be provided adequately to this gentleman after the
fact? not prior to fch© time that this type of defamation? if we

\

20

can categorize it as that? is made by these individuals.
1 think it0s important ~
QUESTIONs

lliis is after 15 years? right?

MR. PORTER?
QUESTIONs

Ho? your Honor —
After the fact means 15 y©ars.

MR. PORTER?

No? your Honor? the 15 years refers to

the 15th consecutive year when they had sent this circular.
The evidence is this is the first time this gentleman had been
on the circular.
*

,*

QUESTIONs

But others have been on there.

MR. PORTER?

There is no class action before us in

this case? your Honor.
My suggestion to the Court is? very simply? that
this cars® should be decided on the basis of the factual
allegations set forth in the complaint and the proof presented
at the evidentiary h@ar.ing in this transcript, that it should
not be given a broad interpretation? it should not open the
doors to the Federal courthouses throughout this country by
attaching the Coagtantlnaau broad interpretation so that ©very
potentially defamatory statement uttered by a public official
would be redressabl® under 1983.

We submit to the Court that

the appropriate remedy is under the common law defamation

remedy.
Basically, in reviewing fchs context of this eas©, I
think it appropriate to assert to th® Court that th® right of

21
privacy having not bean recognized by this Court, not elevating
in our estimation under these factual ciroamsta,.'c@s to a
constitutional level, and in our estimation inappropriate
application of Constantinaau to the facts at bar, wherein th©
liberty and property procedures and application of due proc®sa
have not been attached to this gentleman, that under these
circumstances, w© respectfully submit that th® decision of
th© Sixth Circuit below should be reversed.
QUESTIONS

May 2 just ask on® question.

ME. PORTERs
QUESTION?

Yes, your Honor.
Under Kentucky law in a State defamation

suit against th©s© police officers, would they have a defense
of privilege?
MR. PORTER:

They may hav® a defense of qualified

privilege, your Honor.

-That point, of course, has not been

briefed or addressed anywhere in this lawsuit to date.
that defense would probably b® raised.

But

I think that the case

law in the Commonwealth of Kentucky in that area is not what
I could say to th® Court is absolutely clear, and if we would
raise ’ 'that defense ■ —
QUESTION:

I take it In Kentucky, at least historicallyf

it has been a*defamation to accuse soma person falsely of being
a criminal.
MR. PORTER:
QUESTION:

No question about that, your Honor.
And th© reason it is is that it injures

22
His reputationpresumably.
MR. PORTSRs

No question about that*

Th® issue in

this cas&!0 though, is whether that injury to his reputation
arises to a constitutional deprivation*
QUESTIONS

Whether that’s a deprivation of liberty

or property*
MR* PQRTERs

Yess. your Honor.

And we contend and

respectfully submit that it is not and that the decision of
this Court should tak® the opportunity to carve out this sat
of factual circumstances from the broad scops of the
Const an ti-ivaau and Rote languag® and leave Ida© appropriate
remedy in fell® State courts for persons who find themselves in
these circumstances.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL T. TAYLOR III
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. TAYLOR*
the Court*

Mr. Chief Justice,, and may it pleas©

We would begin t© set the record, I believe, a

little bit. more correctly before the Court because some of
the Justices indicated that it was perhaps — or at least the
inquiry ran a,s to, well, had there been any damage to Davis
p©r s®.
QUESTION*

Not whether there was any damage? has

there been a deprivation of liberty or property.

23
MR. TAYLOR:

May I please refer tchis Court, Ik th©

appendix, to th© response that the employer of Davis gave.
St's the very last page of th© appendix, and if I may, it°s
very brief, just read it directly.
The question:

As a result of th© flier, did you feel

that you might have to possibly limit the places that h© 'would
possibly in th© future go in as a member —

By that they

meant, of course, of the news staff.
QUESTIONs
MR. TAYLOR:

Are you on page 30?

Mr. Justice Stewart, it la 35.
QUESTION:
MR. TAYLOR:
Questions

Thank you.
The answer:

Very definitely, I would.

And why did you feel that way?

And I read directly now from th® proof adduced before
th© trial court at the seeking of the preliminary injunction,
which was denied, and h@ goes on to says

QUESTION?

If you would ©ddress that, 1 would

appreciate it.
MR. TAYLOR*

Thank you.

X believe, Mr. Justice Powell, that when criminality

is imputed, I believe that when by State action -- a State

so forth, but by State action, that whan on© is indiscriminately
lumped into a criminal class and taken as having been
convicted, when the mere fact of arrest is all that's

QUESTION?

You don’t, then, Mr. Taylor, base your

28
claim on a protection of refutation based on Kentucky law.
Take an example,

York where they talk about an abuse can be so gross, and I
might add that in the brief for petitioner it was stated
somewhere along the line that Katz v, United States says there
is no general constitutional right to privacy, is what they
wrote.

But it also did

say, as has Baker and the other cases,

that it is a question of perhaps the heinousness of the
offpnse.
Now, therefore, I respond that we're talking, I
believe, about a matter of degree.

I don't believe that every

time someone bad mouths someone that they are automatically
into a situation of constitutional proportions. I think what
I would emphasize in the case at bar is that her® you had the
Christmas season, you had 800, the wide dissemination, and
I've mentioned that already, the broadcast aspect and what was
called — I couldn't help but reflect a minute ago when the

MR. TAYLOR?

Thank you.

I was suggesting that on® college professor imputing
to another as being a fraud is a vastly different case from
the combined police departments in the Christmas season for
15 years to run indiscriminately through their arrest records
and I say indiscriminately because I’m in those cities and
counties in practice and can assure this Court that there ar©
more arrests for this offense than the 112 appearing here.

They

just sort of giv© to the community — at least that’s how they
saw it* you sas.

And I think that’s a tragic and a sad thing

really* like where they took credit bsr®.

Credit for what?

For calling an innocent man all 'diis number of times a criminal.
The constitutional argument* I think* also should
give a good deal of thought to just the most basic premis® in

33

American criminal jurisprudence, the absoluta bedrock, the
on® axiom, the one rule that every school child learns and
that, of course, I am referring to the presumption of
innocence.
QUESTIONS

No on© found this man guilty in eny

official proceeding.
MR. TAYLOR;

With all respect, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

the police department tried him and they hav© characterised
him as active in this field.

They have printed — how else

do you communicat® in a brochure the picture and the language
describes and relates, they say thief.
QUESTIONS

I thought that presumption of innocence

that you just mentioned was directed to criminal proceedings
directed at ultimate incarceration of the person.
MR. TAYLOR;

I think a presumption of innocence is

shared and possessed by all of us at all stages in our life
and in the proceeding of a criminal case.

Itss a basic thing.

W@ were trying to reach the constitutional aspect of
our fact situation here.

In other words, did Davis have

standing.
Well, w® submit in behalf of respondent Davis that
he had standing, constitutional standing, because of his
constitutional presumption of innocence.

Now, I £ra©Xy

concede that the magic language, your presumption of innocence,
is not in an adjective way spalled out in th© Constitution, but

beginning of this Court, that right has assumed and has always

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARSON P. PORTER
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. PORTER?

Yes, your Honor.

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; You hav® about 5 minutes
remaining.
MR. PORTER;

Thank you, your Honor.

39
Mr„ Chief Justice, and may it please the Courts
There are a couple of points which 1 should like to address

to the Courtss attention.

On®, I think, fails in the area of

what X would like to characterize as a factual misstatement
by my l©ara©d colleague, Mr. Taylor, analysing the status of
"filed away59 in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and putting it in
the proper context of this particular litigation.
On© of the interesting points is that this gentleman
at the time the dissemination was mad® was in a status where
his case was subject to being reopened.

It was not until

after the dissemination was mad© that Mr. Taylor cam® to the
local police court and petitioned for dismissal of the charge.
The second and most important thing X would like to
follow up on is Mr, Justice Powell's comments regarding prior
restraint on & significant First Amendment freedom of these
two particular chiefs of polio®, the question really tealag
in the and result is this Court going to say to fch© factual
circumstances presented here today that before these petitioners
mad® these editorial and potentially defamatory remarks about
this respondent, they had t© hold a full evidentiary due
process hearing, or, as w© respectfully submit

and petition

the Court to adopt the proposition, that the proper remedy
lies in th© circuit courts of the Commonwealth of Kentucky
for defamation.
Thank you, your Honor

40
QUESTIONI

May X ask you a question.

Suppos® an action was brought against the officials
in the Kentucky courts and an injunction was sought. On the
right facts X suppos® you would, as well as damages, X suppos®
a plaintiff could get an injunction against the polio®
continuing to ~~ if he could prove that the allegation was
false.
MR. PORTER? Yes, your Honor, injunctive relief would
lie ~
QUESTIONS

On the grounds that there was irreparable

injury involved?
MR. PORTERs

Yes, sir, on the *— w© have adopted

the civil rules in the Commonwealth of Kentucky that the
temporary restraining order could b© issued to prevent the
further dissemination of thss© particular articles or at least
with the words 8Active Shoplifters” attached to this
dissemination.

That kind of injunctive relief could lie,.

QUESTIONS

Was

this procedural delay that you

had referred to part of some program in Kentucky that's
generally called .early diversion of cases, that is, deferral
of any prosecution in certain types of cases, first offenders,
and .bo forth?

Or was it just administrative inadvertence that

no prosecution proceeded?
MR. PORTER;

Mo, your Honor, it’s a specific

provision in the Kentucky law where the respondent in this cas®

41
QUESTION;
*'MR„ PORTER?

On the application of it, though»
Well, according to fch® transcript that

was presented at the evidentiary hearing, there were no
proseouting witnesses present at the time the respondent made
the motion that his case b® *£il©d away-, ” instead ©£ making fch©
motion 'that it fee in fact dismissed.

There is no question he

is entitled to a presumption of innocence, but in Kentucky
w® make a distinction between dismissal, filed away, and
convicted, and there is a procedure whereby a criminal defendant
can instead of asserting I want to have my day in court, I want
to hav® a trial, I want to b@ dismissed, and say to the court,
and it would b® granted by fch® court as it was in this instance.
that X would like to have my case filed away with general leave
to to® reopened.

Obviously, when your e&s® is in that category,

the police haves to retain the arrest records in their file or
there wouldn’t be a file on which the case could subsequently
ba reopened.

And that was the status of the respondent’s

position on the date of this dissemination.
QUESTION i

It was standard how it is. determined what

cases may be filed away?

MR. PORTERs

No, sir, your Honor, there is no

particular standard, itsa basically a presentation of the
circumstances to the court.

And first off, in the case cited

in the brief, VanArsdale.v. Caswell, it cannot be done unless
the defendant concurs
