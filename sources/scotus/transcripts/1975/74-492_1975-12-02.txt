MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

We will hear argument

next in 74-492, Ohio against Gallagher.
Mr. Jacobson, you may proceed whenever you ar@ ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HERBERT M. JACOBSON
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. JACOBSOHs
this Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

Our respondent in this case is a man by the name

of Terry Gallagher, and in a resume of the facts as they
developed at trial, ha was tried, without a jury and the court
found him guilty in November of 1972.

The offense was

armed robbery, and he was thereafter sentenced to the Ohio
penitentiary.
At the time of the offense, "however, Gallagher
had been on parole. He had been placed on parole in February
of that year.

His parol-3 official was one William Sykes, who

was a member of

Ohio Parols Authority and was assigned to

our area.
Upon b:D Ino informed of the armed robbery., Sykes,
saying that it was part of his duty to do so and part of his
job, visited Sykes at the county jail.
at the county jail.

He visited Gallagher

Sorry.

Nov/, there are two visits that Sykes made to
Gallagher.

On© was on June 26 of 1972, and the respondent

did not speak to him and failed to make any statement whatsoever,

4
and there was no conversation»
Four days before that, however, on June 22, the
respondent Gallagher had been contacted by deputy sheriffs of
our county who ware investigating the armed robbery offense
and had presented him with the printed Miranda form which had
all of the warnings

or

them, and he acknowledged these Miranda

warnings and signed the stenciled form that had Miranda on them.
This was admitted to foe a voluntary act by him and that he
fully understood that he was signing an acknowledgement that
Miranda, had been uttered.
This in effect was one of the reasons why Gallagher
did not talk to Mr. Sykes when he visited him the first time
on June 26th, keeping in mind that ha also was

021

parole and

had been in contact with the criminal system before*

And

when Sykes than determined that in furtherance of his duty as
a State Parol® Officer to go back and visit with him, and he
did so a weak later, on July 3rd.

Now, this was 11 days after

he received his full panoply of rights under Miranda.

And in an

informal conversation at that time Sykes obtained, or rather
heard from the respondent, Gallagher, of his participation in
this armed robbery.
There ware no Miranda warnings given at that
conversation that took place between Mr. Sykes and Terry
Gallagher on July 3rd.

Later at the trial the State called

Mr. William Sykes as a witness, and he testified on behalf of

5

the State indicating what Gallagher had acknowledged to him,
and of course his statements were inculpatory.

And he further

indicated that he was not forced to talk to his parol© officer.
The objections were made at the time of trial to
Mr. Sykes’ testimony.

The trial court overruled the objections,

and the matter was taken to our second district court of
appeals, and in a unanimous opinion, the appellate court there
held that there was no error prejudicial to the respondent
Gallagher and affirmed the trial court.
The matter then went to the Supreme Court of our
State, leave having been granted for the appeal, and they in
turn found that the utterances that war© mad® by the respondent
to Sykes on July 3rd were inadmissible because 'the parole
officer had failed again to warn the respondent of his rights
under Miranda.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Jacobson, 1 am looking at the opinion

of your Supreme Court at page 17 of the petition for certiorari.
And the opening sentence is;

”Th© question presented is

whether testimony, concerning certain statements made by
appellant to his parole officer ...was received at trial in
violation of appellant®s privilege against self-incrimination,
as guaranteed by Section 10, Article 1 of the Ohio Constitution,
and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.M
On what did the affirmativa answer to that question
that there was a violation of the appellant’s privilege

6
against self-incrimination rest?

On a violation of the Ohio

Constitution, of the United States Constitution, or on both?
MR. . JACOBSON s

The Supreme Court in our State

indicated that it was both.

They did not use "or".

They said

by Section 10, Article I of our constitution and ~~

Yes , but w@ are also going under the

QUESTION;

You might have an argument if there was

seme evidence here that the Suprema Court of Ohio felt
compelled to construe its own constitution th® same as the
Federal and that the Federal cases force them to construe their

opinion to that affect.

QUESTION;

And may I suggest that perhaps this isn’t

as simple as some of us might have initially thought.

My

brother Brennan read you that first paragraph and particularly
the last clause of it.

But then the very next paragraph says,

"The opinion of fch© Court of Appeals and the brief of appellee
cite case© from other jurisdictions which had considered this
question.”

Now, how possibly could other jurisdictions have

considered the question of the validity of what happened here
under the Ohio constitution?
MR. JACOBSON;

They could not have, your Honor.

It

would have to be under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution.
QUESTION:

Well, I suggest what we ought to do with

this, then, is what we have done in other cases with this

to your Supreme Court to tell us whether they rested in on your

QUESTION;

Well, you presumably have a number of

points to make, and whatever disposition the Court makes of

QUESTION;

The only problem I want from you is on©

case that you had to support that — a case of this Court.
MR. JACOBSON;

Well, U.S.. v, Deafcon indicated that

was a Federal question.
QUESTION;

What?

A Federal question as to whether

it’s on a State and Federal ground?
MR,. JACOBSON;

No, that it was on a Federal on©.

Haas backs that up by holding that the State, is a proper
aggrieved party.
QUESTIONs

MR. JACOBSONs

It's Oregon v. Haas.

It's 95 S. Cfe.

1215, cited in 375.
QUESTION:

But that was in the context of contention

that if a State court ruled against a State, the State had no
right to come to this Court even to assert, that the State court
had been wrong on the Federal ground.
The suggestion here mad® is that the State court didn't
rule against you just on the Federal ground, but also on a
State ground.
MR. JACOBSON:

All the Supreme Court of Ohio did was

to cite Federal law, and based on Federal law is why they came
to that conclusion, and that is so indicated in Deaton.

Daaton

is a Federal cas®, and that's the very cas© upon which they
rested the basis and foundation of their reversal.
QUESTION;

Let me ask you this, Mr. Jacobson.

We

have confused you and ourselves sufficiently already, so, with
your leave, I will add to it a little bit.
I am familiar with the syllabus rule in Ohio, an$ I
have checked the Ohio State reports and I find that the syllabus
has the footnote --- the headnote is reprinted on page 13,
Appendix A of the petition is precisely the syllabus as it
appears in the Ohio State reports.
That's the law under Ohio.
extra.

That is the law of the cas©.

The opinion is just something

There is not a word of the State or Federal Constitution

in that, and indeed in the italicised language above, this is
said to be the law of criminal law and of evidence, not

12
constitutional lav? at all.
What significance, if any, do you think, that has?
MR. JACOBSONs

My only answer is that the statements

so uttered by the accused to his parole officer became the
vital issue in the case under the Fifth Amendment upon which
Miranda is wholly based.
QUESTIONS

It would appear the man who wrote the

syllabus and the judge who wrote the opinion didn't talk to
each oilier very much about this case.
They are the same man, unres3 it has changed since
my father was a member of .that.court,
QUESTIONs

They didn’t talk to each other much.

(Laughter.)
MR. JACOBSONs

Well, the Supreme Court of Ohio in

making its ruling in which they did ravers® indicated in their
finding that there was an inherent compulsion in the parole
officer-parolee relationship.
Our position is that w© do not believe that this is
to

h®

consonant with th® Fifth Amendment principles, and that

is th© reason we petitioned for the writ to this Court, and
that's th© basis, in my judgment, upon which it was granted.
Now, basically, one of the questions involved here
is whether th® principio of Miranda under th© Fifth Amendment
to the Federal Constitution should be extended or not.

Nov?,

it was Miranda itself that made applicable under the Fifth

.13

Amendment to the area of confessions obtained at a polio®
station, and this had formerly always been an area where the
reliability of confessions and the principle of voluntariness
as developed by this Court were fashioned under the due process
of the Fourteenth Amendment»
The Fifth Amendment speaks of compulsion.
may not he compelled to testify against himself.
would apply to the area of the courtroom.

A witness

And that,

So when Miranda,

came out and said that to circumvent -this compulsion idea as
a necessary component for the usage of the Fifth, that the
atmosphere was inherently compulsory and therefore the Miranda
warnings were developed in the famous case of Miranda v.
Arizona and that automatically now creates compulsion when
these statements ara not given.

So it takes statements which

have been obtained from an accused, a statement which is
purely voluntary, a statement which is reliable and truthful
and stands the tests of due process under the Fourteenth
Amendment under the theory of voluntariness, it takas it out
of that area of the Fourteenth and places it squarely under
the Fifth, because Miranda says so.

And I feel that this is

really an arbitrary, artificial feast to say that just because
Miranda is not cited or there is a failure to give the full
panoply of rights which otherwise would be a voluntary state­
ment without Miranda and now it becomes a compulsory statement
compelled by the accused to h® made just merely because of a

14
failure of giving th® warnings.
QUESTION s

You arcs just rearguing Miranda.

MR. JACOBSON;

X am rearguing Miranda because 1 think

th© test there is such that — 2 will tie it in later — goes
into -■-* Miranda first took it out of the courtroom into the

They then have indicated,

our Supreme Court of Ohio, that they are now taking out of the

officer-parolea relationship.
QUESTION;

So he interrogated him without

At least fch©

prosecution didn’t until the statement was suppressed.
QUESTION;

I euppos® if the statement to the polio©

had been admissible in evidence, there would have been no need
to call the parol© officer.
MR. JACOBSON;

That’s exactly right, your Honor.

It just became a matter of necessity following the court's
ruling in suppressing the statement that had formerly bean
given when the officers took the Miranda warning from him and
h© signed the Miranda warning indicating that h© knew his
rights completely and that h® at that time -than waived them.
The position if the Supreme Court of Ohio and the
position of perhaps three other States are upheld by this Court,
then the question is what exactly are w® going to put in the
way of future parol© officers--parole© relationships?

Now, here

18

we have Miranda basically referring to a policeman, a law
enforcement officer, and in some States they argua that a
parol© officer is a law enforcement officer»

But we challenge

that statement because parole officers are not in the field of
general interrogations and general investigations.
not there to put an individual into the jail.

They ar©

Their job

begins when the policeman3s job ends, and that's the way it
should bs,afe that point it is the duty of a parol© officer or
a probation officer to maintain a dialog with his parol®©,
to maintain a cordial relationship, to try to sea if h@ can
help him get back onto th© road where h© will stay out of th©
j&ilhouss® in th© future.

His job is to try to reform, to help

this man.
Now, if we say that he is a law enforcement officer
and therefore comas under Miranda and that every tins® he sees
his parol®©, we ar® going to put up a wall between them, a
wall of hostility, then the entire relationship, th© entire
area of a parol® officer and parole® is endangered.

QUESTION:

For purposes of compulsion, your court

compulsive than interrogation by an ordinary policeman because
of th© powers that th© parole officer has over th® person.
MR. JACOBSON:

about that?
MR. SCHWARZ:

You know, I -think th© Court in

dat©rmining that question has to consider th© Ohio law, and
it is that the syllabus is —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Well, W© have held that

we must recognize that the Ohio law,isthat th© law of ths case
is the syllabus.

We so held in~Beek : v. Ohio.

24
It doesn't tall us anything on this question, does
it?

It doesn’t say a word about any constitution, Stats or

Federal,
MR. SCHWARZ:

That5s correct.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

It indicates that tills is

a qu@st.ion so far as the Ohio Supreme Court goes of the law
of evidence and the law of criminal law of Ohio.
QUEST!01:

Ther© might b® a rule of evidence in

Montgomery County.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Right.

QUESTION:

Only.

QUESTION:

Is th®r@ an. Ohio syllabus heading called

5! Cons titutiona 1 Law B ?
MR. SCHWARZ:

y©s, there is.

Do you mean State or

May I ask you this?

1 know that the

Federal, your Honor?
QUESTION:

Supra®* Court of Ohio itself prepares the so-called syllabus.
Who prepares the italicized language above the syllabus?

If

yon will look at the petition for writ of certiorari in this
case and turn to page 13, which is the first page of Appendix A,
you will see above -the syllabus italicized language.
MR. SCHWARZ:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Who composes -that?

MR. SCHWARZ:

Do you know?

I assume that the person who prints

that in the Ohio bar do©s that.

MR. SGHWARZs
QUESTION?

Y®sr sir.

Or the editor, not the court.

MR» SCHWARZ?

Not th© court.

I think the court

writes only the syllabus and the decision.
QUESTION:

Well, the syllabus the court writes, and

then an individual justice writes an opinion, is that right?
MR. SCHWARZ:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

If it hasn01 changed, that's the way it is.

MR. SCHWARZ;

I think in this ease they were both

written by th® same person.
QUESTION?
MR.

They generally have been.
just in th® ©vent that the jurisdictional

question is resolved in th© manner that this Court does consider
the case, th® chronology of th® cas®, I believe, is a little
bit other than reported by th® petitioner.

The respondent was,

in fact, interrogated on June 22, 1973, in a small police
interrogation room by two detectives and by a member of the
probation authority, not the parol® authority, but the probation
authority was confronted with another alleged accomplice who
had supposedly already pled guilty to this charge.
Prior to discussing the matter with th© respondent,
th© police did in fact have him execute a Miranda warning form
and read them to him.

It was subsequent to that that the

police or the detectives in fact obtained statements against

26
interest from th® respondent and obtained them by promises of
M the record shows, the police promised to drop

leniency»

some 20 charges against this individual or would not file
20 additional charges which th@y could not prove anyhow»

So

they in effect gave him nothing for something and got. th®
admissions„
It was not until at the time of -trial when the
motion to suppress was sustained that th® parol® officer cam©
into th® pietur©»
only go back

1 think any discussion involving -this can

the Mathic

that art© Indicates that

any person who is on® of the authorities who may put someone in
jail or who may cause criminal prosecution at a subsequent tins©
must in fact give the warnings»

In th® Mathis case, of course,

it was th® tax investigator, and there was a subsequent
prosecution based on information gained while he was in custody.
I think the rights waiver in this case is entirely
Ineffective in'any manner inasmuch as it was gotten, or it was
used only as a tool in obtaining a confession rather than as
a deterrent to a person incriminating himself.
QUESTIONS

Well, did the Supreme Court of Ohio hold

that the rights waiver was ineffective for purposes of even
the police interrogation, or did they hold that the man's
statements were induced by a promise of leni®ney?

Those would

be two quit® different things, I would think.
MR. SCHWARZ:

Tfea Ohio Supreme Court held that th®

27
defendant operated under a promise of leniency in accordance
with the trial court.

The trial court also held that there

was a promise of leniency which mad® the statements to the
police officers, the polios detectives, inadmissible.
QUESTIONs

But they w@r@ inadmissibl© then, not for

failure to give Miranda warnings, but for the misplaced promis®
of leniency.
MR. SCHWARZs

Thatas correct.

After the waiver was

in fact signed, then the promises of leniency war® made, and it
was subsequent to that that the parol© officer mad® his first
visit to tfe© man who was then incarcerated in' the Dayton jail.
QUESTION %

Why waron•t the original Miranda warnings

given by the police good enough for the parol© officer's visit?
MR. SCHWARZ;

Because subsequent to that time

promises of leniency had been mad® to him by the police in
order to obtain admissions against interest.

At that time tfe®

promises of leniency operated to vitiat® the rights waiver.
QUESTION:

What about the fact of whether he knew

all of what' a Miranda warning would tell him.

I thought that's

what Mr. Justice Rahnquist was probing at.
MR. SCHWARZ s
QUESTION?

I think the —

He had the warning.

Why did h® need

another one, if ha knew what it would say?

MR. SCHWARZS

Because that warning had in effect been

vitiated and had bean made null and void by the subsequent

23
promisee of leniency,
QUESTIONS

Yew hi®an that washed it out of his mind?

MR® SCHWARZs

No, sir, but 1 think the decision in

Miranda v® Arizona states that even if a lawyer were in fact
arrested, he would be entitled to have these warnings read,
and 1 assume & lawyer would know his rights to have counsel
and to remain silent®
QUESTION?

But I don't sea how a promise of leniency

could somehow erase the effect of a previous warning that you
have a right to r©main silent, th® right to have a lawyer *
I don’t see how that would have any connection.
MR® SCHWARZ?

It's my position that the connection

is* in the mind of the person who has been given the promises,
having already mad® statements against interest that h® has no
way of knowing will b© kept out of the trial,will talk to this
parol® officer and tell him anything®
QUESTIONs

Presumably even if he had gotten another

set of Miranda warnings under your hypothesis.
MR, SCHWARZ:
think that's the case®

That's only & hypo.

But, no, 1 don't

Having be®n mads th© promise, he would

then tall this to his parol® officer because the parol© officer
had the authority, if he doesn't cooperate, to return him to
th® institution or to recommend that he be returned.
QUESTION:

Mr, Schwarz, relating to the Miranda

issue, is it. your position that whenever a parole officer

29
Interviews his parols® and moves into the question that
relates to another crime, that the Miranda rule applies?
MR. SCHWARZs
QUESTION;

Yes, sir»

In other words, no question whatever as

to whether or not the statement may have been entirely
voluntary, a matter of free will under the circumstances?
MR. SCHWARZ;

Yes, sir.

I -think in that situation

it’s even more Important that the parol© officer give the
warnings because that parol©© may rely upon some confidential
relationship which we all know does not astirt in the law.
QUESTION;This would also b@ your view, I take it,
if the parole officer war© visiting the parole® in the
parole©8e residence in an environment that was not normally
regarded as coercive.
MR. SCHWARZs

Ho, sir, then 1 think it’s out of the

in-custodial range cf Miranda.
QUESTIONs

You are aware — or I will put it to you —

in Ohio could a parol© ha revoked for failure of the parole®
to cooperate with his parol© officer?
MR. SCHWARZ:
QUESTION;

Ho, sir.

It could.

MR. SCHWARZ;

not?

I don't think it could without a formal

hearing and scan© other justification other than —
QUESTION;

Assume a formal hearing.

It developed

that he refused to answer questions of the parol© officer about

30

the commission of criminal acts while on parole, and certainly
in Ohio I would assume that after a hearing, parol® would b©
revoked on that ground, would it not?
MR. SCHWARZ %

I don't think so»

If that case were

pending and ready to go to trial, no, I don51 think so.
QUESTIONS

Oh, yes, but it may b© that you would say

whatever the parole® says to his parol© officer may not be
admissible in & separate criminal prosecution.
MR. SCHWARZs
QUESTION%

That's correct, sir.

Let's suppose that the only thing that

Sykes * testimony was used for in this case was for revocation
of parol®.

You wouldn't suggest that it wasn't admissible for

that purpose?
‘MR* SCHWARZ:

Wo, sit.

1 think that’s an csntirely

different situation.
QUESTION:

So yon ar® really saying that the parol©

officer needs tc- give Miranda warnings only when he is
interrogating in custody and asking him about a saparat® crime.
ME. SCHWARZ:

Crimes other than the on© for which he

is on parole and at which the officer may testify.
QUESTION:

Is it your view that in the formal hearing

on parol© revocation,forget about another trial, but in the
formal hearing on parole revocation that the statements mad©
by th@ subject to the parole officer are not admissible even
in the parol© hearing unless he had a Miranda, warning?

31
QUESTION*

No.

MR. SCHW&RSs

H© »aya they were admissible.
No* I said they would b® admissible in

that case.
QUESTIONS

I misunderstood your r©spons@«

MR. SCHWARis

But not at the subsequent trial for the

subsequent criia®.
QUESTION %

In other words* the bar that you want to

put up is that the mass simply can; i testify in a court with
reference to that — the trial for that particular crime.
MR. SCHWARZ:

Thatcs correct* sir.

Thank you,,
MR,, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you* gentlemen.
