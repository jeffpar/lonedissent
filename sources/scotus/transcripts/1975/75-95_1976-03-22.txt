ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEX B. SHIPLEY, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. SHIPLEYs

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Courts
This case was originally brought by the respondent,
the plaintiff below, who was a member of the Tennessee National
Guard.

He also served in a dual capacity, a separat® and dis­

tinet capacity, as a National Guard technician, which is a
federal civil service capacity, exempt from the normal merit
competitive civil service because of the requirement that the
civil servants must maintain their membership in the Tennessee
National Guard.
Now, the plaintiff alleges that he was wrongfully
denied his opportunity to reinlist in the Tennessee National
Guard, the Air National Guard, asserting that the only reason
he was not allowed to -reinlist was a sham to deny him his oppor­
tunity for continued employment as a technician, as a National
Guard technician under 32 U.S.C. Section 709, which creates the
National Guard technician positions.
The complaint argued that in this case the military
commanders ’ discretion in determining whether or not to accept

\

4
an offer of ra in 1 i. s fcment was so broad and vagu© and lacked ob-.
jactive criteria and was thus unconstitutional,

apparently a

delegation of authority argument, rather than a 14th Amendment
vagueness argument.
Th® denial of th© opportunity then to reinlist denied
the plaintiff, according to th© complaint, his administrative
review which he would have had had he been dismissed for cause
from his National Guard technician status.

Now, the complaint

was dismmissed by th® District Court, alluding to th© unique
relationship between the state militia and on® of its members
and holding that the judiciary should avoid interference with
legitimate military matters.
Now, th© Sixth Circuit, to which certiorari was granted,
reversed and remanded the case directing the District Court to
determine a threshold question, her© whether or not this mili­
tary decision not to reinlist this man was mad© for a military
reason, indicating that you look to th© militaryness of th© de­
cision rather than, to the fact that th© decision-maker was a
military man.
Th® National Guard Technicians Act of 1968 was passed
in order to create, a federal civil service position for National
Guard technicians.

Prior to that time, they had been called

caretakers and they war® considered to b® state employees, con­
sequently you had a wide diversion of employment benefits, re­
tirement b©n®fits, so Congress in 1968 chose to make thssa

\

s
persons federal civil service employees.
The top-level supervisor of these federal civil
service employees with the states is the Adjutant General.

Now,

h© receives that authority from the congressional enactment.
Because of the difficulties which had arisen previous­
ly with these caretakers not being military members of th© par­
ticular units in which they served in their caretaker capacity
during the weeks work, as opposed to their weekend warrior
capacity, th® Congress imposed the basic requirement that a man
is to be a National Guardsman in order to hold this civil
service position.

Th® Adjutant General, the top-level supervisor,

is required by the congressional enactment to promptly separat®
from employment any technician who fails to maintain his
National Guard technician.
Now, of course, a technician might be separated for
cause, ha might be fired, as: it were, and were he separated for
cause, a right of appeal would exist up to the Adjutant General,
who is the military commander of the state National Guard.
Now, th© Sixth Circuit opinion indicates that because
this man is a National Guard technician, he has a particular
right to continued membership in th® National Guard, thus ap­
parently drafting the cause requirement for firing a civil
service technician onto the prerequisite for National Guard
membership to be n .contained in the first instance.

So that

decision avoided the issue of the required membership in the

\

6
National Guard.
Now, a military member of the National Guard can loss
his National Guard status for a variety of reasons.

He may b@

too old to continua to serve in the National Guard.

H© may have

a physical illness; or injury which would cause him to be
separated from the National Guard.

He may simply fail to rain-

list.
So the loss of guard membership for any of those
reasons results in a consequent virtually automatic loss of the
technician employment.
QUESTIONS

What if the National Guard just concludes

that he isn't up to par in terms of his technical competence?
MR. SHIPLEYs

Are you alluding, Your Honor, t© his

military capacity?
QUESTION;

Technical, in his technician capacity.

Do they have two choices, are you telling us, they can dismiss
him from that job for cause or they can just simply wait until
his enlistment expires and than decline to reinlist him and k©
is automatically out?
MR. SHIPLEY:

Well, Your Honor, a Guard member has no

right t© reinlist, no more than a member of -QUESTION:

So you have these two avenues to terminate

him?
MR. SHIPLEY:

Your Honor, exactly.

If the National

Guard chose not fee reinlist him, for whatever purpose,- he would

7
not b© abl© to mala tain his technician employmeat.

Now, that

is a decision that is what we ar© her© for, because tills is a
purely military decision on whether or not to determine this
man9 s -- whether the military wants to accept his offer to r@~
inlist.

The Court of Claims case, which considered enlistments

hav® all alluded to the fact that enlistment is a contract and
it —
QUESTIONS

Mr. Shipley, does it makes any difference

whether it is military or not?

I mean, supposing this was

simply a civilian contact in a classical employment at will
type of thing, doesn't the Board of Regents v. Roth indicate
that there is no requirement for a hearing?
MR. SHIPLEY!
in this case.

Your Honor, exactly.

Now that is true

We ar® not dealing necessarily with the employ­

ment at will or continued employment at will, but we axe dealing
with a determination that is mads whether to employ in the first
instance a reinlistment.

So the same would apply whether or

not this was a military decision, that is correct.
QUESTION:

I thought you said this was civil service.

MR, SHIPLEY:

Your Honor, it is civil service, the

technician status is civil service, it is civil s@rvi.cs -QUESTION:

Then you can't fire at will.

MR. SHIPLEY:
QUESTION:
in this case?

He can fir© him for cause.

You agree that they can't fir® him at will

8
MR. SHIPLEYs

In technician status*, that's right,.

Your Honor, we agree.
QUESTions

So that if they want fe© fire him and they

arent5 willing to go through the normal firing processes, they
just refuse to let him rainlist?
MR. SHIPLEY:

That's right, Your Honor, they can re­

fuse to let him reinlist.
QUESTION:

That is all right?

MR. SHIPLEYs
QUESTION:

That is all right?

MR. SHIPLEY:
QUESTION:

That would b@ right.

Yes, Your Honor.

Now, all the Court of Appeals said was let's

go back and find out if there is some hanky-panky in this?
MR. SHIPLEY:

W©11, Your Honor, I don't think there is

any allegation of hanky-panky because I think that the fact ©f
the matter is that; a Guard commander in making his determina­
tion on whether or not to let the Guardsman reinlist might well
consider his —
QUESTION:

Well, that is what the court said go find

out.
MR. SHIPLEY:
QUESTION:

Exactly, Your Honor.

The court says go find out whether th®

reason to fir© him, not to let him reinlist, was not. to deprive
him of his job.
MR. SHIPLEY:

That is what th© court said, but they

9
want further, Your Honor, in stating that —
QUESTIONs

Wail? what, is wrong with finding that out?

MR, SHIi?LEY:

Well, Your Honor, the difficulty it

creates there is -—
QUESTION;

Oh, I admit there is a difficulty,

MR, SHIPLEY:
Guard capacity.

— is that it would creat® a bifurcated

If I were a weekend warrior who did not serve

as a National Guard technician, than I would not have this
additional right to maintain continued membership in the
National Guard, but, if on him other hand, I was a National
Guard technician —
QUESTIONs

I thought this case was limited to a man

that has fchs statas of the standing job, the civil service job.
That is the only one he is limited to.
MR. SHIPLEYs
QUESTION:

Right.

It doesn't apply to the other on®.

MR, SHIPLEY:

But th© technician status, Your Honor,

is subservient to th© military status.

The whole purpose of

th© technician program is to maintain, ©quip, train th© weekend
warrior personnel.
QUESTION s

And tc give him civil service status is

what you said.
MR. SHIPLEYs
service status.

It does.

He does have certain civil

Ha is not a member of the competitive civil

service, but as a result ha must maintain his Guard membership,

10
but there is nothing in the legislative history of this Act
which indicates that Congress intended to create a greater
right to Guard membership for a National Guard technician as
opposed to any other National Guardsman.
QUESTIONS

What military level is the decision not. to

permit reinlistmonfc made?
MR. SHIPLEY2

Your Honor, the Air Fore® regulation

which is a directive but not binding on the State of Tennessee
National Guard, and which X understand is generally followed,
is that the decision is made by the unit commander, the initial
decision on whether or not to accept —
QUESTION :

In this instance, the unit would b© what?

MR. SHIPLEY:
QUESTION:

I would have to refer Your Honor —

I know, but what kind of a unit is it?

MR. SHIPLEY:

We sire dealing with the basic — I am an

Army man and I am not familiar with the Air Fore® terminology,
and I have to apologize.

I don’t know whether it is a wing or

group, but it is the basic level unit commander that would b© a
company in the Army.
QUESTION:

A company?

MR. SHIPLEY:
QUESTION:

It would b® a captain or at most a major?

MR. SHIPLEY:
QUESTIONs

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, Your Honor.

But h© did in fact in this case, he did in

fact in this case consult some sort of advisory group of other

11
officers, didn't ha?
MR. SHIPLEY:

Right, Your Honor, and this is in heap­

ing with the normal —■ if a man says I want to reinlist and the
military says we have decided not to accept your reinlistmeat,
the unit commander or his superior can convene a board of
officers just to advise him, d© we think this man ought to re­
inlist.
QUESTIONS

But he doesn't have to ~ I mean there is

nothing in the way of review of the initial decision, at. what­
ever level it is mad®, whether it is captain or major?
MR. SHIPLEY:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, I would —

The Guardsman has no —

MR. SHIPLEY:

Exactly, Year Honor.

does not have a right of review.

Now, the Guardsman

Now, assuming it is a military

decision, I am sure if a superior commander decided to counter­
mand the decision of his inferior commander, then that would
obtain.
QUESTION:

This, I take it, in the Tennessee Guard

unit would be the adjutant general, he would be the top —
MR. SHIPLEY:
QUESTION:

Could it get to him?

MR. SHIPLEY:
QUESTION:

H® is the top, Your Honor.

It could get 'to him, I believe.

Not a right, so far as- the Guardsman, is

concerned?
MR. SHIPLEY:

It is not e right vested in the Guardsman

12
himself.

it is a method by which the military commanders up

fch© chain ©f command can make this determination.
QUESTIONS

It is your position, General Shipley, as I

understand it, ‘that a reinlisfcment confers no more rights upon
fch® applicant for reinlistment than would an applicant for
original enlistment?
MR. SHIPLEYs
QUESTIONS

Exactly, Your Honor, exactly.

Which ar© se.ro.

MR. SHIPLEYs

55©roexcept you do have a military

record to determine, and the commander has seen your ~~
QUESTIONS

It may be more to go on, but so far as the

rights of the applicant go, they ar® sere.
MR. SHIPLEYs
QUESTIONs

That is your submission, as I understand it.

MR. SHIPLEYs
QUESTIONS

Start from scratch.

Yes, Your Honor.

And it is for that reason, from your point

of view, that there is nothing for any court to review, because
they can do this for any reason they desire?
MR. SHIPLEYs

Right, Your Honor, and I think that is

•tbs danger in the Sixth Circuit precedent in this case that a
well pleaded but factually unsubstantial complaint.
QUESTIONS

One question.

The man, the adjutant
i

general is in charge of him as a specialist, right?
MR. SHIPLEYs
QUESTION'S

As a technician.

T Y

iaia?

13
MR. SHIPLEYs
QUESTIONs

Yes, Your Honor.

He is responsible for him as a Guardsman?

MR. SHIPLEYs

H© is subservient fco th© governor as

comraander-in-chief of the stats Guard, as a Guardsman.
QUESTIONS

Wall, would you say that th© decision to

refuse enlistment ©r reinlisfcmeat is wholly discretionary, not
subject to review on any ground?
MR. SHIPLEY;
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

Wall, what if a —

MR. SHIPLEY;

.Absent a constitutionally protected

ground, such as race or First Amendment -QUESTION:

I know, that is a pretty big absent, isn't

it?
MR. SHIPLEY;
QUESTION;

Yss, Your Honor.

And I suppose if there was a statutory, if

the statute regulating this technician job expressly says that
you cannot refuse to roinlisit because of your job performance —
MR. SHIPLEY:

Then that would be a. statutory created

right, and there is none.
QUESTION;

Exactly.

Wall, the argument here is that

— the argument or the other side is that that is what th®
statute means.

Bui. you say that they could have refused reta­

ils tment even if whoever refused reinlistmeat said expressly the
reason I am refusing reinlistmeat is because we are unsatisfied
with your performance as a technician?

14
MR. SHIPLEY;

Your Honor, I think that that would be

an appropriate military dotermination.
QUESTIONs

Now, in *—

Wall, don’t w© hav® to judge th@ case on

this basis?
MR. SHIPLEY;

Certainly, Your Honor, but there is n©

allegation here other than — the only allegation here is that
they chose not to r@in.list him because —
QUESTION;

I know, but the Court of Appeals apparently

thought, as I understand it, thought that the real reason they
were refusing to reinlist was that they wore unsatisfied with
his job performance.
MR. SHIPLEY:

.Well, Your Honor, the allegation was

that
QUESTION;

.: 1 '

.And- I thought your position was that even if
\,;V.

v.

that is the case, there is no judicial review of that decision.
MR. SHIPLEY:

We think so, Your* Honor.

But under the

complaint in this caser,/ the complaint asserts that the only
reason they chose not to reinlist him, the cause, the underlying
cause may be there, but the only reason was to deny him any
administratiye review available to him in his technician status.
So what we have her® is there are no charges against this man,
there are — nobody coming in making statements against him that
he is being denied th© opportunity to refute,

it is merely a

military determination that they decide that it was not in the
best interests of the Tennessee Air National Guard to opt for

15
Ilis r©iniistmenfc.
QUESTION:

Which doesn't require any charges?

MR, SHIPLEY:

Right.

Right, Your Honor.

It is a

military decision which
QUESTION:

General Shiplay, as I understand you, you

would agree that if h@ were terminated or refused reinlistment
for a constitution,ally impermissible reason, that he would b©
entitled to soaa hearing?
MR. SHIPLEY;

Oh, exactly, Your Honor.

But w® are not

here —
QUESTION:

In other words, if the purpose was to deny

him a constitutional right, he would be entitled to some kind of
hearing?
MR. SHIPLEY:
QUESTION;

Yes.

Supposing he has alleged — and I think on®

might read his complaint this way — that the statute gave him a
right not to be discharged except for cause, which gave him a
property interest in his job, and that that entitled him con­
stitutionally to a. hearing in connection with a discharge, and
that the purpose of the refusal to reinlist was to deny him his
constitutional right to a hearing in connection with his dis­
charge.
MR. SHIPLEY:

That, might be so, Your Honor, except for

th© statute itself and the legislative history itself indicates
that the technician, status is subservient to th© military status.

16
The whole purpose of 'the technician program is to support the
military, not vice versa, and the requirement that he maintain
Ms Guard membership is in 709 {b} and in {©) {1} it states that
the adjutant general shall separate him, and it is not until
(e)(3) where they say if they want to fir© him for causa they
may do so and later on in the statute it says any appeal from
that decision goes only as far as the adjutant general.
QUESTIONS

Would you agree that if he were terminated

for any reason other than failure to continue his status in the
Reserve, that he would h© entitled constitutionally to a hearing?
MR» SHIPLEY:

Wall, Your Honor, there are several

other reasons, but if he were separated for cause from his
technician job, certainly
QUESTION s

He would have a constitutional right to a

hearing, that, is my question.
QUESTION:

But do you have to call on the Constitution

when the statute says -ha has; that right?
MR. SHIPLEY:

Well, I don't think we get to the ques­

tion of whether hs has a constitutional right, and I think, maybe
that if we are locking at the statute to see whether it does
create a right to continue Guard membership.
QUESTION:

Well, does the statute create th© right to

a. hearing from an administrative dismissal as a technician for
cause?
MR. SHIPLEY:

For cause.

17
QUESTIONs

I suppose it is your position that for all

QUESTIONS

Well, what is the difference between the

mi 11 tary and civilian judgments?

The only trouble with this

case is the sam© man is both th© civilian and the military.
MR. SHIPLEYs
QUESTIONS

In this particular instance ----

The adjutant general is both, isn't he?

MR. SHIPLEY:

In this particular instance, he may

well b® both.
QUESTION:

H© is both.

MR. SHIPLEYs

He actually wears two hats, Your Honor,

because, as a National Guard technician, his supervisor is a
civil service technician.
QUESTION":

H© says while I've got th© hat cn as super­

visor of this man, I can't fire him without a hearing, so I will
put my other hat on and fir© him without a. hearing.

18
MR, SHIPLEY;

No, Your Honor» because he didn't fir®

him in this case, h© chose not to reinlist him, and there is no
right to reinlistmant.
QUESTIONS

'which is firing him.

MR. SHIPLEY;

Now, Your Honor, if during his term of

enlistment, during his six-year period, apparently which this
man had enlisted for a six-year period in the Guard, that h©
had chosen to boot him out, then there ar© certain administrative
rights available to Guard members before a nan can h© separated
from the Guard for cause, but this is not the case hers.

This

is a cas© where his term was up, his contract terra was up, and
he maintained he h.as no right to continued employment, to re­
newed employment.
QUESTION;

And he had been in the Guard for 17-1/2

years?
MR. SHIPLEY:

No, Your Honor.

He apparently — now,

this was not alleged .iti the complaint below. — he had been in
the Guard, as I understand it — and all I know is what is in
the complaint, frankly — for six years.

He was apparently en­

listed in the Guard :asd hired as a civil service technician at
the same time.

He apparently had prior military experience.

QUESTION;

Of 17-1/2 years?

MR. SHIPLEY;

Apparently so.

Now, this came up on the

first time -~
QUESTIONs

And all of a sudden he becomes inefficient?

19
■MR. SHIPLEY:

Your Honor* this cams up* the 17-1/2

years of service* asms up for the first time at the Sixth
Circuit level,

Th©r® is no allegation in the complaint that h®

had any more time than his six years as a technician and as a
Guardsman.
QUESTION?

General Shipley* I am not sure I understood

your answer to my question.

If h® were terminated for reason

other than failure to obtain reinlistment, would you agree that
he do®s or does not have a constitutional right to a hearing?
I understand h® has a right to an administrative right to a
hearing* but does he also have a constitutional right?
MR. SHIPLEYs

As a technician, h© would have a statu­

tory right to a hearing.
QUESTION:

Does he have a constitutional right, to a

hearing?
MR. SHIPLEY%

If dismissed for cause, I think under

Board of Regents and even under Sindermann, I think that both of
those cases would indicate fee has, if he has the entitlement
and if ho has charges brought against him —
QUESTION S

So he would have —

MR. SHIPLEYt
right.

— then h© would have his constitutional

But we havs neither of those present here.
QUESTION?

I take it you think the situation here is

like thSi non-tenurad teacher, say, who is hired for a year and
during the term, during that year he might b© entitled under his

20
contract to a hearing if his contract, was terminated before the
year is over, but at the end of to© year they might refuse re­
newal of the contract —■
MR. SHIPLEY:
QUESTION:

Right.

— for a reason that, if mad© during the

term would entitle him to a hearing, which at the end of the
term doesn't?
MR. SHIPLEY:

Right.

And in opposition to Perry v.

Sindermann, there is no allegation her® of any d© facto tenure,
any d® facto opportunity t© automatically have a right to re­
new that contract absent any charges or statements against him.
And I think that i.s what the crux of this case is, is that this
decision is purely a military decision, purely whether or not
the military, given the discretion given to to© military by the
Constitution, given the authority to run the military to the
Congress —

It is a different question.

Supposing ha asked for a

statement of reasons for not being allowed to reinlist and he
received a letter which said, on®, we'v© heard from our tech­
nical people and they think you ar© kind ©£ an average tech­
nician and they would like to get rid of you? and, two, they
don't want to take the trouble to have a hearing, so we have
decided just not, to let you reinlist.
MR. SHIPLEY;

Would that be all right?

Your Honor, that is not the factual

situation her®.
QUESTION;

Well, if you read that into the complaint.

MR. SHIPLEY;

.And under Roth, if you ax© putting the

blot on the discussion,' so to speak, perhaps he does have some
constitutionally protected right to soma kind of hearing in his
technician status.

Now, in his military status, I don't believe

that has ever bean determined.

I believe that the military

QUESTION;

No, my hypothetical latter is written by a

military man, saying this is why we are not going to let you
reinlist.

You would say that is perfectly all right?
MR. SHIPLEY;

I don't believe, Your Honor, and I

23

think historically the courts have chosen net to get into that
area of military fiseiaion-making and not to review the military
decision.

Now —
QUESTION:

Why don't you just answer?

I thought your

position at th® outset of your argument was that the answer to
that question you war® just asked is y©s, plain simple y©s,
that they could

or that there is no constitutional right, and

that he 'would not get a hearing, even for that express reason?
I thought that was the position you took?
MR. SHIPLEY*

Your Honor, as I recall, th© first argu­

ment of th© question was could it consider his technician
capacity.
*

QUESTION'S

When I asked you th® question a while ago,

if they told him expressly that th© reason they were refusing
retailstment was because of his poor performance as a technician,
would there bo any review, judicial review, and you said no,
there would not be judicial review.
MR. SHIPLEY*

There is my —

QUESTIONNow, isn’t that still the same answer to
Mr. Justice Stevens?

Isn't it or not?

MR. SHIPLEY:

Well, I felt like the situation, the

question was differently, I don't knot*.

I hope I haven't

answered the same question two different ways.

I certainly

didn't intend to.
QUESTION*

Wall, it certainly sounds like it.

QUESTIONs

The only additional fact is tb@y say (a)

we understand you «ire not a vary good technician, and (b) we
don't want to h® bothered with a lot of hearings, so instead of
having a hearing on the technician side of the coin, we ar©
simply not going to 1st you reinlist.

You say that is perfect"

ly all right?
MR. SHIPLEY:

I think that is all right at the ©sad of

the term of reinlistment, at the ©nd of the enlistment term.
QUESTION:

And they might put a p. s. on fch® letter and

say you are lucky that we waited this long.
MR. SHIPLEY:
QUESTION:

They might, Your Honor.

Unless they waited -that long, they could

have removed him s. technician only with a hearing, because dur­
ing his term of enlistment he would have had tenure in the
National Guard.
MR. SHIPLEY:

Exactly, Your Honor, and I would reiter­

ate that in this case there is no such allegation and the:
military statement, was that we have chosen not to r©inlist you
la th® best interests cf the National Guard, and that, is the
purely military decision that was made by the military commandar,
hnd we think that the question that the Sixth Circuit posed is
and of itself a military decision.
If th® Court has no further questions at this tin®, I
would like to reserva any remaining time I have for rebuttal,

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM TERRY DENTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. DENTON:

Mr. Chi©£ Justice, and may it pl@as© th©

Court;
I £@©1 at ths outset of ’this argument that I should
point out that th© Court ©f Appeals correctly noted that on©
must look not to th® nature of th® decision or must look to th©
nature of th© decision and not the mere identity of th© decision,
maker.

This is where w® feel -that the petitioners arts incor­

rect in that they are alleging that the mere fact that it was a
military commander who mad© th© decision, that it was a military
decision.
Our allegations are to th® effect that it was a mili­
tary command©r wfee mad© the decision, but it, mad© for a noarailitary purpose1, that purpose being a sham to remove th©
respondent from hiss technician employment,
QUESTION:

You say it is not a military decision if

the commander reaches th© conclusion that his performance as a
technician is not supportive of th© military mission of the
unit?
MR. DEMON:
QUESTION:
MR. DENTON:

No, sir, and that instance, it would ba
That is not a military decision?
— it would fos a military decision in

26
that instance.

But where he wants to remove the man for other

than a military purpose,, this would be for benefit, to answer
your question, his decision in that instance would b@ for the
benefit of the military.
QUESTIONS

Well, as I hear you, you have really an­

swered tlie question both ways.
MR. DENTONs
working both ways.

It can work both ways.

It is capable ©f

That is why you must lock to the nature of

the decision and not merely th© decision maker.
QUESTIONS

Well, suppose when his r©tnlistra©nt cam©

up, retailstment was refused and he was notified expressly that
we ar© not reinlisting you because we think you are only an
average technician and we can do better, w® are not -saying that
there is anything wrong with your performance in the sense that
x*m could have fired you during th© term --

MR. DENTON:
QUESTIONS

Okay.
— but w© just think we can do batter, so

wa are going to net rsd.nl 1st you.
MR. DENTON:

In that instance, I feel that th© com­

mandar* a decision would then be within the purview of a military
decision.
QUESTION:

But it is only if you think that they are

firing him because of some reason —
MR. DENTON:
QUESTION:'

Some reason other than a military purpose.
Wall, like soma — suppose they have another

27

fellow and say the reason vm aren't reinlisting yon is because
of your performance on a certain day which was — you just
weren't a good technician on that day* we could have fired you
then for cause, but we just waited until now?
MR. DENTON:

If they had an ability to fir© the tech­

nician for cause on any day, then I think, under the dictates of
Congress, and Congress, in providing the portion of a provision
in th® statute for removal for cause, then they must remove for
cause.
QUESTION:

Wall, they didn’t go ahead and do it but

they just waited until the end of the term.
MR. DENTON:
QUESTION:

Then I think it is impermissible conduct.
Then why did Congress give them this right

to —
MR. DENTON:

I don't think Congress ©ver intended for

them to havo this dual capacity.

I think this is something

that —
QUESTIONi

Well, to read th© statuta, the statute says

an enlistment in the Guard is the base of the employment, does
it not?
MR. DENTON:

It is a requisite.

But a man could also

have an outstanding military performance record and could be
dismissed by military commander.
QUESTION:

Well, why can't the statute be read as

simply saying that if you -terminated within the six-year enlistment

28
period, you have got to give them a hearing or perhaps, alter­
natively, dismissal by a court martial?
MR. DENTON:
QUESTIONS
it?

If it is -I suppose 'that could b© don©, too, couldn't

,
MR. DENTONs
QUESTIONs

I’m sorry, I didn’t —
I mean h© could ha terminated within the

six y@ars if fe© were found guilty of some offense by a court
martial?
MR. DENTON:

Yes, Your Honor, he could.

If h© ware

court martialsd and dismissed from the service as a result of
tii© court martial, he could foe.
QUESTION:
appeal on the other

Then h© wouldn't have any administrative
3ids,

MR. DENTON:
QUESTION:

would he?

No, Your Honor, he would not.
Then why can’t this statute be read as

meaning only that if he is terminated within the period of his
enlistment, h© gets an administrative hearing, but when his
enli

expires, that is not renewed, that is the end of it?
MR. DENTON:

I don’t think I follow Your Honor in his

question.
QUESTIONs

1 will repeat it then,

fey does the statute;

— why can’t the statute b@ read as meaning simply that if he is
terminated during the six-year period of his enlistment, then
they must give him the administrative hearing?

But if h© isn’t

29
rainlisted, he is in the same posture as the mmi who just said
h© didn't want to reinlist but he wanted to keep his job.
MR. DEMONs

The statute deals specifically with the

technician’s employment and dees not deal with the military
aspect of which the technician’s employment does rest upon the
military aspect.

The commander, as far as the sham, could, for

political purposes;, or through friendship, design to place someone else in the technician’s position and therefore refuse reinlistineat on that basis,
QUESTIONS

But that wouldn’t have to be & constitu­

tionally impermissible reason, would it?

It might be one that

wouldn’t meet the standard of cause.
MR. DENTON.:

According to our argument, ’they would ba

constitutionally impermissible because it would involve an
abuse of discretion — maybe* not constitutionally impermissible,
it would be statutory' and regulatory impermissible.
QUESTIONS

Okay.

But if it is not .constitutionally

impermissible and simply would be a violation of the cause re­
quirement if it had bean done undor the cause section, what is
your argument for the proposition that sine®' they haven't pro­
ceeded under the cause section, nonetheless the provisions of
that section are somehow imported into what otherwise seems to
be a rather unlimited discretion?
MR. DEMONj

Our argument would be that if they desired

to remove the respondent from. the technician’s employment, they

30
should have done so for cause, have done so through the
statute.
QUESTIONS

But the statute gives them two ways,
*

doesn’t it?

It says you can remove him for cause or you could

deny him reialistruant.
MR. DENTONs

No, Your Honor, the statute doesn't say

you can deny him reinlistment.
moval for cause.

The statute only deals with re­

I don’t think Congress, in enacting the

statute, ever meant to give the National Guard the means of r©~
raoval for other than causa.
QUESTIO?':

You say then as a matter of statutory con-

structure of the Act of Congress, ha is entitled to a hearing
even though he is told he is being denied reinlistxnent rather
than being dismiss «2d from the technician's job?
MS. DENTON:
into the statute.

I don’t think you can read ’that itself

I think that reading into the Sixth Circuit's

decision that this comes from that, it would be permissible or
it would be necessary to give him a hearing, especially in this
case where the commander convened a board which we allege was to
hear charges and statements against the respondent, to make a
determination as to whether or not ha should ha allowed to re­
inlist, then to© respondent, upon the commander convening the
board, requested to be allowed to appear before this board.
QUESTIONs

Do you think the Sixth Circuit's decision

is based on the United States Constitution?

Do you think the

31
Sixth Circuit intended its decision to be based on the U.S.
Constitution?
MR. DENTON;

I think so and, of course, the statute

and regulations.
QUESTION;

And your argument here is based in part on

th© Constitution cis well as on th© statute?
MR. DENTON;

And part on the Constitution, also regu­

lations, also statutory.
QUESTION;

And what is your constitutional point pre­

cisely?
MR. DENTONs

It being that once a commander convened

the board of officers to hear charges and statements ant his
refusal to allow th© respondent to appear before this board,
also his refusal to furnish the respondent with a copy of any
charges or statements, that was constitutionally impermissible.
QUESTION:
MR. DENTON;

Why?
Because it denied the respondent his

rights of procedural due process.

It attaches a stigma to him

before other people who ware passing upon his conduct and his
per formanc©.
QUESTION:

But fchesra was never any public statement,

or, so far as I can tell, any private statement as to why your
client was denied reinlistment.
MR. DENTON:

Wall, quite often, though, under th© law,

there are not public statements or public hearings possibly held

32

wher® people had baen entitled to procedural due process.
There are different methods of denying a parson procedural due
process.
QUESTION;

But you don’t contend there was any damag~

ing reason publicly —
MR. DENTON;
QUESTION;
MR. DEM1 ON;

Most certainly we do.
Wall, what was it?
It was damaging to the respondent in that

he lost his technician’s position -QUESTION;

I mean a reason given by the people who

refused reinlistment to him.
MR. DENTON:

I think the mere statement of saying that

it was not in the best interest of the Tennessee National Guard
to allow his reinlistment, especially in light of th© fact that
he had 17-1/2 years of employment or military expertise employ­
ment ■—
QUESTION:

Does th© record show that he had 17-1/2

years?
MR. DENTON:

Your Honor, as Shipley correctly brought

before this Court’:; attention, that was first raised in. the
Sixth Circuit.
QUESTION;

Well, I am not quit© sure I understand.

Dees th© record show that he had 17 years?
MR. DENTON:
QUESTION:

Do you mean his military record or —
Does anything before us show this?

33
MRo DENTON;

It would only be in the brief, it would

not be in the technical record itself.
QUESTION;

So the answer is no -then?

MR. DENTON;

Well, the brief, the brief in the —

QUESTION:

The brief is not a part of the record, is

QUESTION:

I think there is some mention of it in the

opinion of the Sixth Circuit, isn’t there, or not.?
MR. DENTON:

1 believe it is, Your Honor.

QUESTION;

But that is really not

QUESTION:,

Well, how much tine is in th© record?

The

record shows how much time -he served in the National Guard?
MR. DENTON:

Actual credible time,

I am not sure that

it is National Guard time, all National Guard time is 17-1/2
years credible time.
QUESTION:

Is that in the record?

MR. DENTON:

It would only be. possibly in the record

as far as th® decision of the Sixth Circuit.
QUESTION:
Circuit, where
or

Wall, taking out the decision of the Sixth

is there in the testimony, evidence, affidavits

MR. DENTON:

of course, there is no testimony.

The

only thing to rely on is —
QUESTION:
MR. DENTON;

There is no testimony

cn -~

—- would b© the complaint.

Th© complaint

34
was dismissed without an evidentiary hearing.

Of course, then

from there, there was no brief filed.
QUESTION:

It was never in the record to show how

loxig he was in?
MR. DENTONs

No, Your Honor, other than the briefs

which have been filed.
QUESTION:

And the brief is not evidence to me.

MR. DEM'ON;
QUESTION:

That would b® the only thing.

No, Your Honor, it is not.
Mr. Denton, as I understand your position

it is that ones a member of the National Guard becomes a tech­
nician, he -then can never be denied the right to reinlist with
cut a prior hearing?
MR. DENTON:

Is that right?
He can be if it is not, the denial of

reinlistment is not a mere sham to got rid of him from his
technician1s employment.
QUESTION:
MR. DENTON:

Well, how does on© determine --This is to an evidentiary hearing at

least, and if there is sufficient allegations in the complaintthen this is our contention, that th© federal courts should r®
view at least to make a determination of whether or not a de­
cision made by a military commandar for a non-military reason,
as noted in th© Sixth Circuit’s opinion.
QUESTION:
MR. DENTON:
QUESTION;

Th© answer to my question then is yes?
That is correct.
And that is that ones the status of

35
technician is attained, it may be the first month he is a
member of the National Guard, from then on he can never be de­
nied the right or the claim to reinlist without a prior eviden­
tiary hearing?
MR<, DENTON:

The answer is not yes, it is yes if his

denial to reinlist or the denial to reinlist, is a sham to get
rid of him from his technician's job.
QUESTION:

But suppose the commanding general, the

adjutant general just said you ar© -the worst soldier we've ever
had and totally incompetent —
MR. DEM'ON:

That would ba a military decision and

you would have no ~
QUESTION:

Wouldn't you have to have a hearing to de­

termine whether that was a sham?
MR. DENTON:

No, Your Honor, not in that, instance,

because it would bis a military decision and not merely a mili­
tary decision-maker making a decision for a non-military purpose.
QUESTION:

But suppose he believed that that was the

real reason, the point that he says that is what you told me,
but I know the. real reason you fired me or ’wouldn't let me rein­
list is because you didn't like ray work as a technician?
Wouldn’t ha always ba fra© to make that allegation in a complaint.?
MR. DENTON:

He ecuId, he could make that allegation

and then it would be up to the court to determine whether or
not he had sufficient or mads sufficient allegation —

36

QUESTIONS

Well, he could make that allegation,, re­

gard lass of v?hat -blue commanding officer said to him.
\

MR. DENTON;
QUESTION:

He could.
So then h© always would have an opportunity

of a hearing?
MR. DENTON:

Also h@ would have to show sufficient

allegation before the court would bs willing to review it, under
our argument.
QUESTION:

Well, his allegation would be exactly what

you put in this complaint, namely that the real reason you said
that is you didn't like my work —
MR. DENTON:
QUESTIONs
QUESTION:

True
and you didn't want to give me a hearing.
If your client were not a technician,

would you assert that he had any claim for complaint upon denial
of reinlistment?
MR. DENTON;

If he ware not a technician, merely he

was a military personnel?
QUESTION:
MR. DENTON:

Just art ordinary National Guardsman?

,

No, Your Honor he would not have a right

to a hearing in this instance then if he were merely a military
personnel»
QUESTION:

Your position is bottomed on the fact that

your client is a technician or was a technician?
MR. DENTON:

Right, Your Honor.

I think the facts in

37

the decision of this case are, unique to my client’s type of
employment.

It doesn’t apply across the board to all military

personnel,

It applies in the instance where you have civilian

technicians in employment based upon military employment,
QUESTION:

You recognize, of course, that before one

may attain th© position of technician, he must be a member of
the National Guard?
MR. DENTON2
with that.

That is correct.

We have no argument

That is by operation of law.

If he loses his Guard

membership, he loses his technician's employment.
QUESTION?
MR. DENTON:
QUESTION:
MR. DENTON:

How many days a week is he a technician?
He is a technician five days a week.
And the other two?
Th© other two, h© is off. duty actually.

He has one weekend I think per month that he performs services
as a National Guardsman.
QUESTION:

And on that day ha performs services, mili­

tary —
MR. DENTON:
QUESTION:
MR. DEMON:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
— military services?
Yes.
And ©re they the same functions that he

performs during th© week as a civilian technician?
MR. DENTON:
are.

Basically, as I understand, most of them

In this particular instances, th® respondent did perform

38

the-very same functions.
QUESTION %

And if the commander had said , we are not

allowing you to reinlist because in on© weekend of the month you
performed so poorly we decided that you ought not reinlist, we
ought not permit you to reinlist, somewhat the situation?
MR. DENTON:

If it is mad© for a military purpose,

where in that case; it is —QUESTION:

On that day, performing military duties,

you didn’t perform satisfactorily —
MR. DENI'ON s
QUESTION:

Right.
— for that reason, we arenofc permitting

you to rein list.
MR. DENTON:

But again, too, then there would not be

a sham to get him out of his technician’s job.
QUESTION:
MR. DENTON:
,

QUESTION:

So that —
It would b® for military reasons.
— it would be very simple then, instead of

denying him reinlistment as they did, if they merely said we
deny you reinlistment because on the one weekend of the month
that you have t© report as a military person, you did not psrf arm saidsfactorily.
MR. DENTON:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Let m© take you outside the military.

think as U.S. Attorney is appointed for four years.

I

Suppose the

four-year period expires and he isn’t reappointed, is he entitled

39
to a hearlag?
MR. DENTON:

1 don't believe so, Your Honor.

I be­

lieve that would probably fall — I don't remember the exact
name of the case*, but it was in regard to **£**«"«• or something
of that nature* where the District Court's law clerk* or maybe
the clerk of the District Court was not retained by the Federal
District Judge* and the court held that there was not —*
QUESTION:

Well* I am speaking of a normal U.S.

MR. DENTON;

Right.
Sometimes there is a vacancy* why* the

District Court steps in, but I am just speaking of the usual
situation.
MR. DENTON:
matter.

It would be a purely discretionary

Possibly it could attach, if the U.S. Attorney had per­

formed such a job for such period of time whereby he became
vested with a property interest in continued employment.

This

is another aspect of this in that we feel that due to the
respondent's past military record* awards* citations* being

^within —
QUESTION:

Let ra® s-aa if I understand you.

Are you

saying that a U.S. Attorney can acquire some kind of tenure in
his job beyond his period of appointment?
MR. DENTON:

If you want to relate tenure and a vested

property interest* if you want to say they have the same

40

connotation, yes.

I don't feel they have 'the same connotation.

I think of tenure as being somewhat different from a vested
property interest by virtue of things that have been performance
of the employee-employer relationship, whatever over the past.
It would be probably somewhat akin to Perry v„ Sindermaim,
where it was found that there was a tenure program, although
not spelled out, and the professor became vested with a right
of property interest and continued employment and renewal of
his contract.
QUESTION?

Mr. Denton, you are familiar with Roth, I

take it, the Board of Regents v. Roth?
MR. DENTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Are you aware that there in that case,

when it had been in "the Seventh Circuit, the board got here,
although Roth had no claim of entitlement to be rehired, it was
simply a tenure at will, tfe«s Seventh Circuit, held that as a
prophylactic matter to make sure that the refual to rehire wasn't
for impermissible purposes, he was entitled to a hearing either
in federal court or administratively, and this Court disapproved
that, as I read the opinion.

Now, it seams to me that your

argument that there is a prophylactic necessity for this sort
of hearing to make sure that it wasn't improper reasons is very
much th© position that the Seventh Circuit took in Roth and that
was not followed in this Court.
MR. DEMONs

I -think the distinction in that case wars

41
that th© Seventh Circuit held that a mar© subjective expectancy
was protected, and this Court disagreed, saying that a mere
subjective expectancy was not.

I agree with that, that mere

subjective expectancy is not protected, but w© think that th©
respondent had a justifiable and reasonable expectancy, based
upon 17-1/2 years of credible tima, based upon previous reinlistments, based upon military record, awards and citations,
that they have created in him a reasonable justifiable expec­
tation that he would be allowed to reinlist.
QUESTXOMs

Is there any way to get you off of that

17-1/2 years?
MR. DENTON:
QUESTION:

I will get off of it, Your Honor.
Well, doesn't that argument depend on

factors other than his being a technician?

I thought I under­

stood you to answer Mr. Justice Powell by saying that you relied
entirely on his status as a technician?

And if that is true, I

don't see whether it makes any difference whether he was on©
year or 17-1/2 years.
MR. DENTON:
QUESTION:

I’m sorry, I don't fellow you.
Do you rely on any — would you say h© had

a claim if h® were not a technician?
MR. DENTON:

If he ware not a technician, doss h© have

a claim?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. DENTON:

No, Your Honor.

42
QUESTIONS

If you rely entirely upon his status as a

technician, what difference does it make whether he was in the
service for 17 years or only for six weeks?
MR. DENTON:
QUESTION:

If I rely on his status as a technician?
Yes* your point being that when his term

of reinlistment comes up, his status as a technician entitles
him to a special protection.

It seems t© me that is completely

independent of the 17-1/2 year point, and vice versa.

If 17-1/2

years gives him an. expectancy under Roth and all the rest of
it, then he doesn't, need to be a technician.
MR. DENTON:
of reinlistment.

His 17-1/2 years gives him an expectancy

One® h® rain lists, then his technician's

employment continues unless dismissed for cause.
QUESTION:
MR. DENTON:

I have to confess I am confused.
If I may, I go back to the idea -that once

the board was convened, the respondent became clothed by the
right to appear before this board, a right to have a copy of the
charges ©r statements mad© against him, all of which were denied
to him.

This was set forth in the complaint, also set forth

that the command®2 exceeded his scops of authority and abused,
the authority, if it is in fact vested ia him, the complaint
just set out the alleged vested discretion ©r prerogative.

Our

position is that this discretion or prerogative does not ia fact
exist.

If it doss in fact exist, we would have expected the

petitioners to set forth specifically where that regulation or

43
statute vesting tha commandar with this discretion or preroga­
tive, where we can locate it, something they have totally failed
to do, which would have been very simple.

I think possibly it

could have foreclosed the issues in this case.
Of course, we feel that the commander overstepped his
authority and abused it and acted in an arbitrary and capricious
and unreasonable manner when he used the military aspect of the
respondent’s employment in order to terminate his technician's
job.
Also if the military commander is given unfretted
authority or prerogative or discretion, without judicial re­
straint or tee possibility of review by the judiciary, then tee
decision of a military coranumder would be left to stand even if
it war® made on constitutionally impermissible or statutory or
regulatory impermissible grounds, such as race, religion or sex,
to deny review would then or allow the military commander to do
that which the Constitution and statutes and regulations says
he cannot do.
QUESTION:
in your complaint?

But you didn't allege that here, did you,
You didn't allege that the refusal to allow

reinlistment was because of race, religion, something like that?
MR. DENTON:

No, Your Honor, we did not.

That issue

has not been raised in fcha complaint.
We would say that once sufficient allegations have
been mad© before a court, allegations of a natur® th,at the

44
commandes had exceeded hia statutory and regulatory authority,
that the» commander had violated th© constitutional rights of
the respondent or a petitioner, plaintiff, that then th® courts
could review, they hav© a r;lght to review in the first instance,
to determine if there has been a violation, and if this violation

QUESTION:

Is there a normal term ©f six years or

46

something like that?
MR. DENTON;

I am really not that familiar with it,

Your Honor, to be abl® to answer that.
W© feel that the Sixth Circuit’s decision doss not go
outside the old bounds of non-reviewability, but actually is
remunerative of that.

They just set forth a method of review,

if there are sufficient allegations.

Wo feel that the Sixth

Circuit’s decision is judicially correct.
QUESTION;

The opinion written for the Court of

Appeals was written by a former member of the Court of Military
Appeals, wasn’t it?
MR. DENTON ;

Judge Duncan was formerly the Chief

Justice, as I understand it, of the United States Court of
Military Appeals and as such I would feel that he does possess
some expertise ip. the area of military matters.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you.

Do you have anything further?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEX B. SHIPLEY, JR., ESQ. — REBUTTAL
MR. SHIPLEY;

Briefly, Your Honor, I would like to

reiterat© that this was a purely military decision and to refer
Your Honors to the. prayers of the complaint.

He wants to be

reinstated in his -iisploymeat, h® wants to he reinstated in the
National Guard, he wants full back pay for any period of time
after which he was terminated in his Guard technician status,
and h@ is seeking $100,000 in damages from his military

47
commander.

And we would assert that to subject military com­

manders to the possibility of these types of suits would
severely interfere with the military preparedness of this
country through the National Guard program.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The

case is submitted.
[Whereupon, afe 2:05 o’clock p.m», the above-entitled
cas© was submitted.]
