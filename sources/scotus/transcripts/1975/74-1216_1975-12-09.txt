MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume arguments

in Risfcaino against Ross.
Mr. West.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL G. WEST, J.D.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. WEST:

[Resuming]

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Good morning.

Just prior to yesterday's recess, I

was discussing this Court's decision in Daniel v. Louisiana,
which held Taylor v. Louisiana not retroactive, and in
particular that part of the Daniel case dealing with the effect
upon the criminal justice system if Tay/lor were to be held to
be retroactive.
Ross’s contention is that the retroactive application
of Ilam no doubt will have some effect on the criminal justice
system within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts but not the
calamitous effect urged on this Court by the Corcmonwetilth.
We also su-gest that the decision of the First
Circuit in Ross does not
by the Commonwealth.

have the wide ramifications suggested

Yesterday I mentioned a couple of those

limitations but one that I would like to mention now and what
triggered the Ross doctrine in asking questions as to racial
prejudice is that the defense counsel must submit quest:.ons
to the trial judge to ask the prospective jurors.

Failure to do

27

that and failure of the trial judge to refuse those questions
or similar questions to the same effect will not bring the
doctrine in

Ham or Ross into existence.

Also as a practical matter, in order to challenge
the once conviction based upon the Ham case, a criminal
defendant probably would still have to be in jail.

There

have been 36 months that have passed since the Ham decision.
Presumably all states except Massachusetts
Ham decision.

have followed the

And even in Massachusetts in the second Ross

decision, the Supreme Judicial Court, although affirming
Ross's conviction, said that in future cases it is good policy
to ask these questions as to racial prejudice although not
constitutionally required.

And in addition the legislature of

Massachusetts has twice since the second Ross decision in May
of 1973 revised the statute upon which this suit is predicated
to now provide that the trial judge must ask or shall ask
questions as to racial prejudice to the prospective jurors.
Q

When is that duty triggered under the new

statute, when any defendant asks for it?
MR. WEST:
Q

Yes.

No matter what the situation?

MR. WEST:

Yes.

And in addition it appears that

the statute says, and it is on page 42 of my brief—
Q

And whether or not there are any witnesses, you

do not have to suggest who the witnesses are going to be?

28

MR. WEST:

No, only if the court believes that

there are possible preconceived opinions toward the credibility
of certain classes of persons.

They do not limit it co a

racial prejudice.
Q
rule should be?

What do you think the scope of the constitutional
Who is constitutionally entitled to the

question?
MR. WEST:

Certainly defendants of a racial minority

are clearly covered, in my opinion.

Also I would take the

position of the defense in the Ham case, and that is that
questions that rise to a serious nature of prejudices should
also be included such as the beard in the Ham case, such as
someone's religious preference.
Q

What if the defendant is not a member

of a

minority group?
MR. WEST:

It depends on the case, Your Honor.

For

example, if the case involved capital punishment, I think that it
would be constitutionally required to ask.
Q

I am talking about racial questions.

MR. WEST:
Q

Yes.

Suppose a defendant is not a member of a minority

and he asks that the jury be interrogated about racial preju­
dice?
MR. WEST:

I think in that case it is up to the

trial judge to find out if there is any possible racial

29

prejudice in that case.

For example, the victim or the

defendant or the witness-Q

So, you say it is not limited to where the

defendant is a member of the minority group.
MR. WEST:

That is correct, and I think I answered

that yesterday for Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
Q

Where does it stop?

Any defendant at any time,

I take it, was constitutionally entitled to have the jury
interrogated about racial prejudice if he asked for it.
MR. WEST:

If he asked for it and if the nature of

the case at all suggests that the question of black and white
is part of that case, either if the defendant or the victim or
a witness is of another racial minority.

I think in those

cases it is constitutionally required.
Q
acquainted

I gather then the judge on voir dire has to be
with what may develop during the trial as to the

identity of witnesses, would you not say?
MR. WEST:
Q

Yes.

There might be a white accused, but he may have

a black witness.
MR. WEST:
Q

That is right.

The defense counsel has first to tell the judge

this and then the judge has to make a preliminary determination,
as I understand your brief, to question jurors who may have
prejudices.

30

MR„ WEST:
Q

That is righto

But defense counsel has a burden, does he not?

MR. WEST:

That is right.

And failure of trie defense

counsel to submit any questions automatically does not trigger
either the Ham doctrine apparently or the Ross doctrine of the
First Circuit.
Q
minority?

Why do you limit the right to a member of a
I suppose you would say any defendant, white or

black, could have the instruction.
MR. WEST:
Q

How about the prosecution?

MR. WEST:
Q

That is right.

Yes, I believe sc.

But the defense, I gather, just does not get it

by asking for it.

As I understand what your brief says, you

do not quote the full statute, but the judge has to bs
satisfied thctt some jurors may have prejudices.
MR. WEST:

That is right, and that is exactly the

Ross case because there was not only one question submitted by
Ross, but co-defendant's counsel submitted approximately 30
questions.
Q

What I am getting at is, as I understand this

statute, there is a burden on defense to persuade the judge
that this is a situation and this trial would involve situations
where jurors may have prejudices.
MR. WENT;

That is right.

31
Q

And until he persuades him of that, the judge

has no duty, as I understand it, to permit these questions.
MR. WEST:
Q

That is right.

Is that right?

MR. WEST:
burden not only

Yes.

In fact, I think there is a further

to submit that and convince the judge that

there is a possibility of prejudice, but .in the Ross case I
think the judge was sort of convinced of that, that there may
be some prejudice, except he felt that asking these questions
would not be helpful.
Q

To persuade the judge, you would say you

would not have to show any more than that a witness is black?
MR. WEST:
Q

That is all you have to show?

MR. WEST:
Q

Yes.

I would think so,

Your Honor, and I think-—

If you had to show any more, I take it, you

would question the constitutionality of the statute under Ham
MR. WEST:

That is right, and that is exactly what

we are doing here.
Q
you.

That is almost a per se rule then, as I understand

All you have to say to the judge is that the defense is

going to have a black witness, and then he must permit the
questions to be asked of the panel.
MR. WEST:
Q

Yes.

On that basis I do not know why you would not say

32
that as long as the jury is mixed, you must ask the jury this
question because witnesses are either going to be white or
black.
MR. WEST:

Yes.

I think those questions are

constitutionally required, particularly however, in cases of
violent crimes.

At the moment I am prepared to limit my per se

rule to violent crimes because those apparently are crimes in
which racial prejudice most stands out.
Q

Incidentally, the full text of that statute

is not in the papers here,is it?
MR. WEST:

I do not believe so.

And I do not think

it is in the appendix, either.
Q

Why do you limit it to violent crime?

MR. WEST:

First of all, the First Circuit “Limited

it to violent crimes.
Q

But you are taking the position here that it

should be limited to violent crimes.
MR. WEST:
all crimes.

Yes.

My personal preference would be for

But for purposes of this argument, I think I would

limit it to violent crimes because those have the most
potential for racial prejudice.
Q

How about demonstrations, convictions for

disturbing the peace.

Those have no violent overtones, and

yet certainly during the sixties there were occasional racial
implications in those cases.

33

MR, WEST:

Yes.

As I say, my personal preference

would bs to have it for all crimes.

The Ilam case was

certainly not a violent crime, possession of marijuana.
Q

The statute, as I understand you, satisfies

your personal preference.
MR, WEST:
Q

Which statute, Your Honor?

This new statute.

Apparently the new statute

is not limited to cases of prosecution for violent cr:.mes, is
it?
MR. WEST:

It is not.

It doss not satisfy me,

however, because when reading the new statute, it has to be
triggered by the judge, meaning the judge has to be persuaded
that there are some factors.

And I would like to take that,

discretion from the judge and trigger this question.
Q

I do not understand.

it is a per se rule.
as you suggested

Once you say we have a black witness or,

to Justice White, if you have a mixed jury,

black and white, then automatically
question.

You told us earlier that

the judge has to ask the

He has no discretion.
MR. WEST:

No, he has to ask the question if defense

counsel requests it.
Q

You would want him to ask him without a request

from defense counsel?
MR. WEST:

No, I would limit that to only when defense

counscil asked those questions.

I think that is a strategy

34

decision of defense counsel, whether to inject that issue into
the trial.
Q

Does that go for any witness?

MR. WEST:
Q

Yes, in my opinion,it would.

If it was just a purely technical witness—

suppose the witness was a ballistics expert.
MR. WEST:

I think those technical witnesses have

their impacts on juries, and I would certainly include that
type of witness in my discussion.
Q

A witness that brought in a birth certificate.

MR. WEST:

I would not even do it in that case

because the birth certificate may well be a crucial issue in
the case.
Q

But the man that brings it has nothing to do

with the certificate, does he?
MR. WEST:
Q

I understand that.

I am just wondering if you are not painting

with a pretty broad brush.
MR. WEST:

I think I am, and I think that in issues

of racial prejudice one must paint with a broad brush because
of the Fourteenth Amendment and the purpose behind the
Fourteenth Amendment, to stop invidious discrimination.

And

I think that when you give judges discretion in this area, you
wind up with cases like the Ross case limited to special
circumstances or when one is a special target for racial

35

prejudice.

And I think that I would rather err on the side of

being broader in this area than being limited and restricted
as I think the Supreme Judicial Court was.
Q

It is your position, but you are not sure we are

going to take that position, are you?
MR. WEST:
Q

I cannot be sure.

Mr. West, you continue to talk in terms of

racial prejudice.

There can be all sorts of prejudice

disassociated with race.

It was not that many years ago that

a Republican in Mississippi was not the most popular fellow.
Or today a

member of the Irish Republican Army might find

himself unwelcome in some communities.

Would extend the

constitutional rule to any situation in which arguably there
might be prejudice against a particular defendant or a
particular witness in the case?
MR. WEST:

Yes, I would.

And the decision of yours

in Ham approves those state cases upon which Aldridge relied.
And some of those

state cases deal with—-I remember ane of them

dealt with a political-party, the

Knew Nothing Party.

I am

not sure cf the name of the case.

And that case was approved

by this Court, which included that one must ask questions as
to prejudice against—
Q
those cases.

Mr. West, I wrote Ham, and we did not approve
We cited them, and we made it quite clear in

Ham the principle was based on the equal protection clause and

36

the racial implications of the Fourteenth Amendment.
MR. WEST:

As I recall in your decision, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, you said that you relied on Ham and all those state
cases upon which Ilam relied.

And I took that as you approved

or reaffirmed Aldridge and you also reaffirmed those state
cases upon which Aldridge relied.
Q

How then would you explain our rejection of the

voir dire request with respect to beards?
MR. WEST:

I think that what you were saying was that

the beard controversy did not rise to a serious level.

That

did not rise to a constitutional right, although certainly the
one as to race you were very careful to limit it to because
of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Q

In so limiting it, I do not see how you can say

that the case itself stands for anything more than that.
MR. WEST:

It

Weis

just from your language,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that I assumed that you were affirming
those state cases.
Q
it says

the

In fact, I am trying to find that—

Here is the language.

In referring to Aldridge,

Court's opinion relied upon a number of state

court holdings throughout the country to the same effciCt, but
it was not expressly grounded upon any constitutional requirement.

I take it that some of the state cases were grounded in

a constitutional requirement, were they not?
MR. WEST:

Yes, Sixth Amendment.

37
Q

So, Aldridge could not possibly itself have

approved those cases because it did not rest on a constitutional
ground expressly.
MR. WEST:

Yes, except the language that I have

quoted in some papers in front of me says that the Ham
conviction was relying on the firmly established precedent
in Aldridge and in numerous state cases upon which it relied,
and

I took that to mean—
Q

Where did you get that language?

MR. WEST:

It was from the Ham case itself.

If I

could have a moment later on, if you would like, I could find
that exact language.
Q

Never mind.

MR. WEST:

If I could continue, the point that I was

trying to make is that this Court does not have to reach the
issue of the impact on the criminal justice system to
Massachusetts or the good faith reliance on prior precedent,
because the issue in hand goes precisely to the truth finding
function of the jury and renders suspect Ross's conviction.
And therefore, according to the Williams' case would
invoke the retrospective application of Ham without regard to
good faith reliance and effect on the criminal justice system.
We are here dealing not with an exclusion of
evidence case or an illegal search and seizure case, which this
Court has generally not held to be retroactive.

We are dealing

38

with a case which shows the possibility, the probability, the
likelihood that the Ross jury acted in an arbitrary way, not
based upon the evidence but rather based upon the race; of
Mr, Ross and the conviction resulting therefrom,,
The purpose of applying Ham retroactively would be
to guarantee an accused a totally fair and impartial
tribunal and to protect the integrity and dignity of the
judicial process from any hint of bias or prejudice.
was not cifforded either ox these protections.

Ross

The duty that

the courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts owes ho James
Ross, Jr. requires no less.
If I can move on to the issue of the applicability
of Ham to Ross--Ham, as you know, was a case involving the
possession of marijuana.

The trial judge was asked to ask

prospective jurors two questions.

He refused to do so and asked

only those general questions provided in the South Cazolina
statute.

This Court said that the missing element in the Ham,

decision was that the court did not focus the attention of the
prospective jurors as to any racial prejudice they might
entertain.

And I would suggest to this Court that that is also

the missing element in the Ross case.
Ross case are mot similar.

The Ham case ar.d the

Each involved a black defendant.

In each the principal witness was a police officer or a
quasi-police official.

In the Ross case he was a security

officer dressed in the Boston patrolman's uniform patrolling

3S

Boston University»
In order to be found guilty, both Ham and Ross
needed a unanimous verdict»

Each final jury was composed of

ten whites and two blacks.

The statutes upon which each state

operates is almost identical, asking the same questions.

The

procedure in each state is the same. It has given wide
discretion to the trial judge.

And in each case two jurors

were excused because of racial prejudice, in the Ham case and
the Ross case.
And, finally, each question that was presented to
this Court for decision in the cert petitions filed by Ross
and Ham were almost identical.
Aldridge was a case whose facts are strikingly similar
to Ross.

The Ham case relied, I think, heavily on Aldridge

and affirmed Aldridge, and I think that the significance of
the Ham case was that it reaffirmed Aldridge and gave it
explicit constitutional underpinnings.
Ross asserts that the trial judge failure to ask
specific questions as to racial prejudice is not only
constitutional error but requires reversal, without the need to
show actual prejudice.

It is twisted logic, as the Commonwealth

asserts, that on the one hand Ross was not entitled to have
these questions asked but, on the other hand, he must show
actual prejudice.

One wonders how a criminal defendant can

show actual prejudice without being able to ask questions of

40

prospective jurors .
Q

You said reverse when you meant affirmance.

MR. WEST:

I mean

affirmance of the reversal of

his conviction and affirmance of the Court of Appeals
decision.
Can the Commonwealth assure James Ross that any
error here was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt?

Can

the

Commonwealth assure this Court that not one of the jurors
chosen harbored any prejudice against Ross because of his race?
We cannot,, especially beause of the conclusion reached

by the

Kerner Commission and the recent events concerning racial
segregation and integration in Boston.

Even if one of the

12 jurors were prejudiced against Ross, his right to a fair
trial was impaired.
Seemingly in recognition of the difficulty of
criminal defendants to show actual prejudice, this Court on
several occasions has dispensed with this requirement.

In

Aldridge and in Ham, in Peters v. Kiff, the Court said,
"Moreover, if there is no showing of actual bias in the
tribunal, this Court has held due process is denied by
circumstances that create the likelihood or the appearance of
bias."

The same result in Taylor v. Louisiana.

The defendant

there did not. allege that the failure to have women on the
jury was actually prejudicial.
In conclusion, in summary, although Massachusetts

41
abolished slavery in 1783, racism is still part of American
life, so much so that the Kerner CcmiTdssion report stated in
1968 that race prejudice has shaped cur history decisively in
the past and now threatens to do so again.

One cannot doubt

the validity of that part of the Kerner Commission report.
Certainly this Court in both Aldridge and Ham have recognized
that problem and Ross asks that you do so again.
Failure to afford James Ross a new trial after
struggling for five years and seven appellate hearings is, as
stated so eloquently by Mr. Justice Marshall,"to see this
Court's decision in Ham v. South Carolina stillborn and to
write an epitaph for those essential demands of fairness
recognized by this Court over 40 years ago in Aldridge."
Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MISS BARBARA A. II. SMITH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MISS SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor.

I would just like to

address the Court on the new statute which Mr. West has
referred to.

a determination whether the circumstances of the case require
that the questions be posed.

administration of the statute at trial?
