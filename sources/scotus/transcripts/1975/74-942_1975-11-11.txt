MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Goode»
Mr, Penny, you may proceed whenever you are ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. PENNY, JR,, ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. PENNY;

Mr. Chief Justice and if it please

the Court;
This case is before you on writ of certiorari to
the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and concerns the propriety
of the entry of

mandatory injunctive relief where the

District Court expressly found that the Defendants had not
violated Plaintiff’s constitutional rights where there was
no continuing course of conduct to enjoin and where there was
an adequate remedy of law.
This case is before this Court in consolidated form.
It originated as two separate cases filed and tried, for the
most part, in 1970.

They were consolidated in 1973 by the

district judge for purposes of relief.
The Plaintiffs are essentially the same, individual
plaintiffs suing ort behalf of the class of all Philadelphia
citizens and on behalf of a specifically included class of all
Philadelphia’s black citizens.
The Defendants also are essentially the same.

They are the mayor, the police commissioner and the managing
director of Philadelphia and, in addition, a police captain.
The class Plaintiffs averred that the Defendants,
these defendant city officials had engaged upon a course of
conduct of the basest, lowest form of racial discrimination.
The averment was

that these city officials had made a

conscious decision to deprive a segment of Philadelphia’s
society of their basic constitutional freedom.
It was averred that genocide was the goal, that
now-Mayor Rizzo had actually planned and was attempting to
carry out the extermination of Philadelphia's black community
and the vehicle for carrying out this plan was supposedly the
Philadelphia police department, whose officers, it was
alleged, were ordered,

directed and encouraged to trample

upon the constitutional rights of Philadelphia's citizens
and, in particular, Philadelphia's black citizens.
After 21 days of testimony and after 250 witnesses,
or approximately 250 witnesses, the court was forced to
conclude that on those allegations, Plaintiffs utterly failed
to prove their case.
The court concluded that there was no policy of
racial discrimination.

There was no policy to violate

constitutional rights.

The court refused to find that any

defendant violated any constitutional right of any class
plaintiff or any individual plaintiff.

5

Additionally, aside from the claims of palpably
unconstitutional conduct, Plaintiffs in the Goode case
averred that the police department’s internal disciplinary
procedures for disciplining police officers were and* in
their words, "inadequate."
They averred they had a right and a need to
adequate administrative procedures internal to the police
department and they demanded a remedy in the form of the
adoption of their scheme for their, in their words, "adequate
internal procedures."
The court heard evidence on this issue and
decided that the police department’s procedures were, indeed,
inadequate in terms of disciplining police officers and in
terms of receiving citizen complaints.
Yet, both the District Court and the Circuit
Court pointed out that there was absolutely no constitutional
right in the plaintiffs <x in the class plaintiffs to have any
improved procedures.
Essentially, the basic question is whether a
citizen has a constitutional right enforceable in the federal
courts for his elected officials and his elected officials’
appointees to act wisely or adequately or efficiently and
the court said no, they don’t have that right but nevertheless
the relief was. entered and it was entered because the court
heard evidence and made findings regarding separate,

6

individual, independent incidents of police misconduct.
There are approximately 38 to 40 introduced at trial.

The

court made findings and it is not entirely clear from the
court's opinion but it appears that upon approximately 25
of these incidents the court concluded that the police
officers involved who were not defendants did act uncon­
stitutionally towards these individual citizens.
The question —
QUESTION:

I noticed that in Judge Fullam’s

opinion that in the Goode case he makes specific findings
with respect to several of those incidents.
unconstitutional invasion

This was an

of the Plaintiff's rights.

But

in the COPP&R case I don't find those specific findings.
MR. PENNY:

In the COPPAR case there — on two of

the incidents the court made a finding.

I think one, he

characterized the police action as an overreaction.

That was

in the Locke and Perry incident where the finding was that
the police officer had a bucket of water thrown on him from
the third floor when he was checking out a stolen car and then
the police went in and did overreact.
The other one was the Brown and Smalley incident
where,. I believe he used the words, "The police acted
unreasonably*" although he didn't use the words "unconsti­
tutionally. "
I am — when I said approximately 25 incidents I

7
am just giving you the best estimate that you could, out of
the whole ca3e, find maybe 25 incidents or so where there
was conduct which is arguably unconstitutional." 'I don * t
say that Judge Fullam concluded that in 25 incidents.
Judge Fullam’s conclusions as to uneonstitutionality,

I believe, only go to the — six of the incidents

in the Goode case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Penny, this Court stayed Judge

Fullam's order, did it?
MR. PENNY:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
Has there been any extent of compliance

with it despite its stay?
MR. PENNY:

No, your Honor, the changes have not

been implemented as far as I know.

I haven't checked on it

but I don’t believe I would be stating the facts in all
candor if

1 said they were.

I don’t think they have been”

The court found, on the basis of these individual
sporadic incidents of conduct, these 25 or so incidents,
that they had occurred in the past and that in the future,
sporadic incidents also would occur and the question is,
assuming that a remedy can be awarded in the absence of a
v
right -— and you must remember that the district court
refused to find that the Defendants -- these Defendant city
officials had embarked upon any policy to violate anyone9s
constitutional rights, but assumingthat their remedy is

8
proper, some remedy, the question is whether the court's
prediction that these individual incidents will occur in the
future on a part of persons not defendants presents an
appropriate case for the entry of mandatory injunctive
relief.
Now, generally, I believe that for a single act
or an independent act in violation of one's constitutional
rights by another one acting under color of state law, the
typical remedy is damages.
However, if a Plaintiff establishes a continuing
course of conduct, something that is violating his consti­
tutional rights and immediately threatens to violate his
constitutional rights in the future, then that Plaintiff is
entitled to have that conduct stopped.

But here we have 25

incidents involving 30 police officers strung out over a
period of three years where the court found in that same
period that there were 300,000 arrests.
During that period of time there were approximately
8,000 police officers and there are literally millions of
police/citizen interactions which did not amount to arrest.
The Plaintiffs not only failed to establish a
course of conduct to be enjoined, they failed to establish a
pattern of conduct.
We have 25 incidents, each one, against — if
properly pleaded, against the appropriate defendant, may well

0

9

be eligible for damage relief.

You put them together in one

case, you still have 30 separate incidents without a single
unifying characteristic, other than you have Philadelphia
police officers who I don't think in this case are acting
any differently — and I think as the judge found, the case
is typical of most urban police departments, that in the
course of events, in the course of happenings, unconstitu­
tional actions by police officers do occur.
We see this in bad arrests.

MR. PENNY;

I think that it is a fair reading of

violated the constitutional rights of certain parsons.

the hope of this relief is that maybe these future unknown
acts that are specific that we don't know who they are going

QUESTION:

I suppose you could even go so far as

to say that with 8,000 policemen operating in a large city
in the metropolitan area, that you could conceive that that
25 incidents or 30 incidents of violations would occur in

MR, PENNY:

Over the course of a three-year period?

QUESTION 2

It would be rather remarkable if it

was that low.
MR. PENNYs
your Honor.
pattern.

I think that would be true also,

I think — the Circuit Court used the term

I don't believe Judge Fa11am did but I think the

Circuit Court used the term "pattern of police abuse, was
established."
But as I understand the word "pattern," it is an
outgrowth of Title VII where Congress has said, you don't
have to shdw an intentional policy to do anything to
discriminate in your employment.

All you have to do is show

the effects of your existing policies and if the .effect of
those existing policies is to demonstrate a pattern of
conduct statistically, then the courts will do something
about it.

But there is no similar provision in 1983.
There is no pattern here.

There is no clear and

imminent threat which should be or can be enjoined.
The question as to who, when, where, hottf and why
are unanswered in the record and they are unanswerable and
the failure — and this remedy, as I said, only hopes to stop
future unknown acts.

We don't know if it will or not and the

reason we don't know is because it doesn't go to any
unconstitutional conduct.

12

Unless

you are prepared to say that inadequate

procedures are in themselves unconstitutional, then the
remedy — and the District Court was not prepared to say that»
The Circuit Court was not prepared to say that — then the
remedy doesn't enjoin anything that is unconstitutional»

It

just substitutes the court5s judgment on the adequacy of
internal police department administrative procedures.
Now, Plaintiffs concede that it is impossible to
frame injunctive relief which would stop the constitutional
violations shown in this case, which would stop these future
various and independent acts.
The reason is not because of anything unique to
the police department.

It is not unique to this case — or

to the Defendants in this case.

The reason is because of a

fundamental failure in the Plaintiffs' case.
failed to prove the underlying policy.

That is, they

They failed to prove

the continuing course of unconstitutional conduct.
They failed to prove the existence of something
which could be enjoined.

And the real impossibility of

framing such injunctive relief in view of this fundamental
fault in their case comes to the fore when you understand
that they have attempted to present these unrelated incidents
of police conduct.
For this purpose, to create an injunctive decree
which will preserve for all time and for all people,

every

13
conceivable right existing under the Constitution, from
violation for any police officer because there is no
definition of the rights here.

There is no definition of

who, when, where, how and why.
I respectfully submit -QUESTION:
a minute?

Mr. Penny, may I interrupt you just for

You mentioned the fact, as I understood it, that

over the three-year period there were 300,000 arrests and
about 25 or 30 specific examples of police misconduct
introduced in evidence.
Is there any evidence in this record of comparable
police misconduct and. to the effect that it is more likely
to occur in Philadelphia than in other large cities?
MR. PENNY:

No, your Honor.

In fact. Judge

Fullam says that it is rather typical of any urban police
force at ■— I believe it is on page 123 of the Appendix.
"A review of this material suggests-that the
problems disclosed by the record in the present case are not
new and are fairly typical of the problems afflicting the
police departments in major urban areas."
QUESTION:

Is that on page 123a?

MR. PENNY:

Yes, your Honor.

I believe it is.

Yes, your Honor, about two-thirds of the way
down after the succession of citations to various treatises
and commission reports.

14
Because of the failure of the Plaintiffs to
establish the existence of any conduct whatsoever on the
part of the defendant city officials in this case * as X
said, the court, in view of the allegations, the court was
forced to make that statement, that there was no policy,
mandatory injunctive

relief is inappropriate* .

First of all, because it is beyond the power of
the court because it is just fundamental that where you
fail to establish a right against the defendant you cannot
have a remedy.
Secondly, it is even assuming that a remedy would
be appropriate, there is nothing here to enjoin.
no conduct.

There is

It is just guesswork.
Thank you, your Honors.

I would like to reserve

the rest of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Hearn.
ORAL ARGUMENT 'OF PETER HEARN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR- HEARN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
At no point in their presentation today do the
Petitioners address themselves to the findings which Judge
Fullain did make.

To the contrary, they blithely and

incorrectly assert that both the District Court and the Court

15

of Appeals found that they had engaged in no legal wrong­
doing.
However, there were a number of express findings
upon which this relief was predicated»
QUESTION:

These findings —

That is a different statement than you

that may be so but was there some finding that these parti­
cular defendants did wrong?
MR„ HEARN:

Yes, sir, there was a finding that

they engaged in a policy to avoid or minimize the consequences
of proven police misconduct.
QUESTION:

What page is that?

MR. HEARN:

That is on page 124a of the Appendix.

QUESTION:

And did they find that a constitutional

wrong on these defendants or what?
MR. HEARN:

Mr, Justice White, the premise of both

the District Court and the Court of Appeals was that the
defendants tolerated, condoned or acquiesced in the misconduct
of those under their supervision and control.
QUESTION:
MR. HEARN:

Where is that finding?
Well, the finding is that there was a

policy to avoid or minimize the consequences of proven
police misconduct.
QUESTION:
MR. HEARN:
QUESTION:

Now, this is —
That is on page 124a,
This is 5.

16
QUESTION:

At some point, would you juxtapose that

with finding number 3 above and suggest what you think the
relationship is?

The finding that the evidence does not

disclose any conscious departmental policy of racial bias
or of discriminatory enforcement on racial lines„
MR. HEARN:

Yes, sir, the finding three above I

believe addresses itself simply to a policy of racial bias
and I believe the finding to which I had just adverted, the
number 5, has to deal with the failure to do anything about
all forms of illegal conduct by police officers, whether
it is the application of excessive force, whether the question
of illegal arrest.

>

In other words, I think that he is saying in
number three that there is no express racial motivation here
but I believe to the contrary in number 5 he has expressly
found that there is a policy of condoning this unaceptably
high number.
QUESTION:

Mr, Hearn?

rft

MR. HEARN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Do you read the word police misconduct

in that finding 5 that you just quoted a3 being the equivalent
of constitutional violations or as embracing something more
than that?
MR. HEARNs

There was evidence beyond the scope

of unconstitutional conduct.

There was considerably more

17
evidence of unconstitutional conduct than my brother would
indicate»

As to what the court meant by this tern I do not

know but certainly our case is grounded upon, specific
findings of unconstitutional activity which was acquiesced in
and condoned where there was a policy to minimise or avoid the
consequences by those who were condeded and found to be in
position of supervision and control»
QUESTION:

If Judge Fullam then followed your

theory of the case or in order to have his findings support
your theory, you would have to read misconduct to mean
constitutional violations in that finding, wouldn't you?
MR,, HEARN:

Well, I think that wa can get some

glean on what Judge Fullam intended by referring to page
130a where ha concludes toward the bottom of his opinin in
the next to last paragraph- "Violations of constitutional
rights by police do occur in an unacceptably high number of
instances," and so I would submit, Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc,
that he is talking about unconstitutional acts as affording
the underpinning,- the basis for the remedy that he entered.
Now —
...............

i

QUESTION:

The answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc9s

question is yes.
MR» HEARN:

Yes, sir, that is correct»

Both the District Court on page 124a and the
Court of Appeals did use the word "pattern."

As X have said,

18
it found that the number of violations was unacceptably high
and with respect to whether there were two years, three years
or a shorter period, in the Goode case there were six
incidents over is months involving just two police officers.
In the COPPAR case, which was later consolidated
with the case in which I was counsel originally, there war®
28 incidente over a period of five months,,
There was also extensive testimony that this was
basically a tip-of-the-iceberg problem and that moreover there
was a policy by the department to discourage the filing of
complaints whereby this information would come. to.the
attention of the senior officers so that the time period, I
submit, is much greatly reduced over what was indicated to
the Court eari lev and tha4>..

+-w«re was a greater

concentration when the temporary restraining order entered
by .Judge Pullam was in effect.
There were some 16 incidents in the

COPPAR case

over a three and a half month period prior to the entry of
that restraining order and there were 12 incidents during the
one and a half months in which the restraining order was in
effect so that the frequency was ascending that the bulk of
the evidence in this case is in a much more confined period
and as I have said, the period of concentration was greater
when there was a court order restraining on constitutional
activity.

19
QUESTION %

Is there any reason to think that any

of the concentration was cine to the Black Panther convention
activity in September of that year?

I believe that was why

the restraining order was initially entered, wasn't it?
MR. HEARN2

Well, it was entered ahout that time.

I do net believe there was any connection, factual connection,
that these incidents which were proven did not grow out of
that convention and by the way, I think that the reference to
one sentence in the complaint of the case that was later
consolidated with *5oode to the reference to genocide and that
the reference to the 6,000 advocates of violence and non-"
violence who ware coming to the City sf Philadelphia is no
more than an attempt to discredit this case before this
Court.
In fact, as we have attempted to point out, the
convention itself was not involved in these incidents and,
moreover, it was attended by■a much smaller number, something
like 500 people.

It was entirely peaceful and it involved

largely residents of the City of Philadelphia.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Hearn, before you go on, I note in

the Court's opinion that it refers to some very general
matters here.

It recitas The President's Commission on Law

Enforcement at page 123a, referring to President Johnson's
Commission of 19S?, described the Philadelphia Highway Patrol
as a "skull-cracking division" and then it gives soma quotations.

20

Can you enlighten me on how something that happened,
several years before with a different police department has
any relevance to this —■ the findings in thi3 case?
MR. HEARN:

Well, I believe that this is a reference

published by a governmental advisory commission of the highest
order,,
QUESTION:

Assuming it is entirely correct, that

the Philadelphia Highway Patrol indeed was guilty of having
a skull-cracking division, what does it have to do with
Philadelphia police, the police department?

Are the two

connected in some way or are they under the same —?
MR. HEARN:

Well -- oh, yes, sir, the Philadelphia

Highway Patrol is a part of the Philadelphia Police Department
and one of the defendants here in both cases is Captain
Murphy, who is the commander of the Highway Patrol and there
was evidence of a substantial number of incidents here
involving highway patrolmen and I believe that that was the
basis of the reference to it by Judge Fullam.
Now —
QUESTION:

Is the Highway Patrol a traffic unit,

Mr. Hearn?
MR. HEARN:

No, sir, definitely not.

It is —- I

am goring mildly outside of the record but I believe it is an
elite group that where there are more stringent physical
requirements.

I believe it is considered to be a more mobile,

21
a mora forward# aggressive entity as a part of the department.
It is not related to the control of traffic at all.

I mean#

it does have the right to arrest for speeding and the like,
but --QUESTION:

I suppose the procedures of that

inquiry were not adversary in any sense, were they?
MR. HEARN;

Before the Commission, Mr. Chief

Justice?
QUESTION;

Before the Commission.

MR. HEARN;

Not to ray knowledge:

I am not

entirely certain how the record and.the findings of the
V-

"* v •

Commission were developed, however.
N.

{

QUESTION:

Well, one of the members of this Court
V

was on the Commission, Counselj
MR. HEARN:

Justice Powell, X think.

But I think that the essential point
i

that the Petitioners fail to understand here is that we are
not talking about a right to the procedure which is set forth
in Judge Fullam’s decree.
That is the remedy.

The right that was violated
\

was fc’ris acts of those who were under the supervision and
control of the Defendants.
The remedy is what Judge Fullam concluded on the
basis of his findings of fact and his consideration of the
entire record was the most appropriate but mild remedy.
Aa to what this decree does, I think it is

22

particularly important to point out that it is procedural
only.

This decree has nothing to do with what the substantive

standards are that are applied to police activities.
It has nothing to do with who decides.

This is

police judging police.
All that this decree does is to specify that there
will be complaint forms of a certain kind available, that
they will be distributed at. certain locations, that the
investigation will not involve what the facts disclosed
were the inhibiting element of the chain of command, that
there would be a six-month statute of limitations, so to
speak,relative to the submission of these complaints, that
there will be minimal investigational steps and minimal
time periods, that anonymous complaints will be handled and
that frivolous complaints will be screen out.
There is a procedure for eliminating

frivolous

complaints.
The hearing that is involved only if there is a
dispute on the facts as to a non-frivolous complaint and,
finally, there is a provision that records will be kept for
a period of two years.
QUESTION:
MR. HEARN:

How about the decision maker?
The decision maker is no different.

The decision maker is the Commissioner of Police or his
deputy in certain cases, but there is —

23
QUESTION:

Is this the provision on 129a in the

Appendix in the opinion?
MR. HEARN:

No* this is Judge Fullam's directive

to the police department.

He said that they were to offer

a program which would be addressed to the general problem
and then on 129a he is discussing some of the points that
he believes —
QUESTION 5

He says, "Adjudication of non-frivolous

complaints by an impartial individual or body, insulated
so far as is practicable from chain of command pressures.
Now, is that — the police would have to conform
with that directive if the injunction were not stayed.
MR. HEARNs
QUESTION:

That is correct, but —
But what did he mean by that?

Do you

know?
MR. HEARN:

Well, he

meant that the evidence

showed, Mr. Justice White, that district commanders — that
would be somebody running a police station or precinct —
tended to inhibit the flow of the complaint if it were made
i

in that district, that it was in their interest to not
report complaints about what —
QUESTION:

Well, I just wonder, who is supposed

to make the decision now?

Do you know what hs meant by an

impartial individual or body to make decisions?
MR. HEARN:

Well

24

QUESTION:

Did he mean non-police?

MR. HEARN:
QUESTION s

No, h© did not.
How do you know ha didn't?

MR. HEARN:

Well, because the decree makes it

claar that it is police, that it is the police commissioner.

In other words, Judge Fullam

directed that a

upon the good faith of the defendants in which we fully
concur that with mild pressure from the Court that they \*ould,
in effect, put their house in order.

Now, Judge Fullam, after 67 pages of

writing, a very comprehensive opinion, says, "In^conclusion,
it should be emphasized that this Court has .not decided that
the Plaintiffs and the class they represent have a constitu­

he ordered, is it not?
It is, Mr. Chief Justice Burger, the

remedy that he ordered but this case was not tried nor was
it the Plaintiffs’ contention at any time that we had a

right to that.
The right that we are claiming is not to have
violations on the street by those under the supervision and
control of the Defendants in an unacceptably high number.
QUESTION;

At this stage, on review, we are not

concerned especially or particularly with what you asked
but what the court decided.
You cast it on constitutional grounds.

The court

granted some relief while at the same time conceding that
there was no constitutional right to the relief.
Now, that leaves only — as least, I suggest to
you, isn't his fall-back position that this must be under
some supervisory jurisdiction if it isn't constitutional?
And he is exercising a supervisory jurisdiction
over a state, is he not?

You mean, you disagree with what I

MR. HEARN;
with what you read.

No, sir, I don't.

I don't disagree

I disagree with your interpretation

because I believe that in the foilwing sentence he goes on

27

to say v.’hat the court has decided is that under existing
circumstances ,

violations of constitutional rights by-

police do occur in an unacceptably high number of instances
and in the absence of change in procedures such violations
are likely to continue to occur and that revision of pro­
cedures for handling civilian complaints is a necessary first
step in attempting to prevent future abuses.
QUESTION:

That is an entirely logical extension

of the part that I read but where does a United States District
Judge, what is the source of his auidiority to impose a
supervisory power over a state or a municipal government in
these circumstances?
Isn't his. power limited to granting damages or
injunctions in the ordinary sense to stop doing something?
MR. HEARN:

No, sir- I believe it is not and I

believe that the school desegregation cases are examples of
remedies fashioned to achieve a right —
QUESTION:

Do you think that this is a parallel

to desegregation?
MR. HEARN:

I don't think that it is a factual

parallel but as it relates to the interplay between right
and remedy, X believe that it is comparable to the reapportionme.nt cases and to the desegregation cases

that 13 83

—

section 1983 in the Fourteenth Amendment, as this Court said
in Monroe versus Pape , includes or involves, brings within

28
its sphere, under the rubric of color of state law, those
state officials who are unable or unwilling to enforce a
state law and that this is what the unconstitutional activity
is and that the court had before

it a number of possibliitiea

It could have entered an injunction of the sort that it had
for a temporary restraining order for a short period of
time, which is much like the decree in Allea — Allee versus
Medrano which simply says you may not engage in unconsti­

,

tutional activity henceforth

but I submit that that leads

to exactly the thing that courts should seek to avoid and that;
is the bringing in, the hauling into court of specific
police officers to stand under the test of hindsight for
\

some act that they might have done at 10th and South Street
on a particular night.
QUESTION:

But won't you get a certain amount of

hauling in here if the district captain didn't process the
complaint in 45 days?

I mean, there are certainly directives

in Judge Fullam's order that would be basically contempt
citations.
MR. IIEARN:

If there was a wilful failure to do

something mandated by the order I submit, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that would be appropriate for a contempt proceeding.
But. there is also a retention of jurisdiction here
and that if the defendants at any time for any of the reasons
that they argued here —- in many instances for the first time

make this order unworkable, then they can go back.

They can

evidence about the impact on the

operations room which they claim here but never claimed
below and never produced any evidence on below — and he
would consider that and make a finding and if he thought that
it were proper contention and that we didn't have any
evidence contrary that was properly cognizable, that he would
make a finding and modify his order.
This procedure allows for exactly the working out
of these elements of mechanical difficulty, shall I say, as
the decree goes along.
QUESTION:
analogy.

Mr. Hearn, just let me follow this

Suppose people in Philadelphia came to the federal

judge, both of them, and said,"the local

assessor is following

improper practices in assessment of real estate, favoring
some people over others and thereby inflicting a denial of
the equal protection.”

And the judge heard all the evidence

about how one house was valued at 25 percent more than
another house that he, the judge, concluded, was of the same
value and that he found 25 or 50 or 1,250 illustrations of
that.

Do you think the judge would have the power to order

the assessor or the county or the municipality to make up a
new set of regulations as to how they should go about the
assessment of their property for tax purposes?
MR. HEARN;

Assuming, Mr. Chief Justice, that

30

the contention that the plaintiffs in such a case would make
is unconstitutional — and I am not prepared —
QUESTION:

Oh, yes, I said denial of equal

protection.
MR. HEARN:

— on this — then I would submit

that the court could formulate relief which it concluded
would be most likely to avoid a recurrence of the uncon­
stitutional practice.
Now, certainly, the type of order that you
contemplate which goes into an entire revision of the process
QUESTION:

That isn't very much different from

what you have got here, is it?
MR. HEARN:

I believe it is.

I believe this is

a very —
QUESTION;

No, no, just to paraphrase him, just to

simply say that you have got to improve your procedures for
handling assessments of real estate property under your
statutes, substituting real estate for police complaints
here.
MR. HEARN:

Well, but of course, the specific

decree I think is the one that would govern more so than that
language.

I think that — that language, I think, is

predicated upon, in great part, a procedure

endorsed in the

Yale Law Journal which was cited, I believe, in your
dissenting opinion in Allee with respect to allowing the

31
defendants to develop the program, to assume their good
faith in this situation.
QUESTION:

Sometimes you cite a Law Review

article because we do not endorse it, not because we endorse
it.
MR. HEARN:

Well, sir, I understood the reference

to it to be approving but I could

be incorrect, hut the

Well, Mr. Hearn, may I ask, what we

have here, of course, is the final judgment which is
appended to the Appendix,

Yes, sir.
Attached to that is a procedure.

It

runs several pages and goes even down to the colors of the
various sheets, original, yellow, pink, golden rod, green,

MR. HEARN:

the line but the -— all of the great specificity that you
were referring to —
QUESTION:
MR. HEARN:

Yes.
— the fact that we have what I submit

appears to be something that it is not, and that is, a
federal district judge telliig a t-olice department that the
golden rod copy goes to the operations division or something
of that sort, that is simply not involved.
QUESTION:

Well, I gather this was a part of his

order, though.
MR. HEARN:

It is involved in it but this was just

like in the school desegregation cases, this wa3 a plan
developed by the people that, I submit, are best able to
do it.
QUESTION:

But a court order, they didn't volun­

teer it.
MR. HEARN:

They didn't volunteer it, Mr, Justice

Rehnquist, but I think this is the most appropriate form of
remedy here.

There is some coersion involved.

QUESTION:

Well, an injunction is coersive.

33

MR. HEARN:

Yes, sir, that is right, I agree.

When you have a record such as the findings here of
unconstitutional activity, I think that it is appropriate
and, indeed, the duty of the Federal District Court to do
something and the question here is, did it go about it in
the least intrusive —

works.
MR. HEARN:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Mr. Justice Brennan.
And you are saying that it was all

nowhere in the decree is there a reference to

whether there is any kind of violation of questions of comity
or state criminal procedure.

None of these questions are

involved.

No, sir, I think it is much less

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. PENNY, ESQ.
If it Please the Court, I would like
a misconception.

to correct

The Defendants did not come close to

drafting the decree or the Appendix to the decree.
What happened was, on March 14th of 1973, the
District Court entered the opinion, the long opinion which
is set out in the printed Appendix.
The Court ordered the Defendants to submit a
program.
Nov-/, the order was unappealable and as the Court
recognizes and

mentions several times, at various points in

the record we had objected to the right of the Court on this
record to enter any decree but nevertheless we couldn't
appeal at that time and we, in good faith, complied with the
court order.
We submitted a proposal.

That proposal was four

pages long and had four pages of forms attached, three pages
of schematic designs and one, the fourth page, was a form
for the — the citizen complaint form itself.
QUESTION:

So, following up on Mr. Justice White's

38

suggestion, that is at least 10 pages, isn't it?
MR, PENNY;
total.

No, that's — that is eight pages

It is eight pages total, four pages of flow charts

and forms and four pages of a directive.
The court's directive is 14 pages long exclusive
of any flow charts and forms.

They are not there.

We submitted something and it is totally unlike
what the court eventually implemented.
I want to address the right versus remedy issue.
This case can be construed in two ways.

Either the court

entered relief because it did determine that the procedures
were inadequate and despite what it said about not having a
constitutional right to adequacy, decided to render them
adequate anyhow.
Or, the court decided that the Defendants could
be held liable despite the court's conclusion that they
hadn't violated the Constitution and either of those two
events, the relief, the remedy is thoroughly improper.
It is either a remedy without a right or it is a
remedy where the court recognises it doesn't have a right to
question the wisdom of the executive branches of local
government.
As for the inadequacy, it has been asserted to
you that it was only raised

in the question of a remedy.

Paragraph 18 of the Goode complaint, inadequacy is alleged.

39

Paragraphs 49 to 53, the need for a mandatory
injunction in the form of adequate procedures and the right
to relief in that form.
Paragraph at page 21a, paragraph 2, a and b of
their wherefore clausa demanding relief, they demand
revision of the procedures.
These procedures and the disciplinary procedures
did not arise

back in 1973.

since the beginning.

They have been in this case

That was the reason this suit was

filed.
As far as the analogy with the school desegre­
gation cases, in every one of those cases there is a policy
of unconstitutional conduct which is stopped immediately —
to paraphrase one of this Court's opinions, the relief will
halt segregation and will halt it now.
And the saiae with re apportionment cases.
nothing equivalent here.

There is

This decree does not enjoin anything

other than what the court deems is inadequate.
We don't know if it is ever going to prevent any
unconstitutional conduct because we don't know what the court
is talking about other than something will happen in the
future.
There was some question about the meaning of the.
court where the court said, it is the policy of the
department to discourage the filing of such complaints to

40
avoid or minimise the consequences of proven misconduct and
to resist disclosure of the final disposition of such
complaints.
This was brought out to the Court at the beginning
in Mr. Hearn's remarks, stating that that is a policy
determination by the Court.
I believe — it seems they are to be somewhat
irreconcilable with paragraph t^ree of the findings, as you
pointed out, Mr. Chief Justice, but if you turn to page 128a
of the

Appendix, it is explained that what the court is

talking about there is the policies of the department being
the procedures of the department had the result of minimizing
and discouraging complaints.
"The complaints are handled on a chain of command
basis" and this results in a tendency to minimize and
\

discourage complaints so when the court said, talking about
the policy to minimize complaints, it wasn't talking about
a wilful policy on the part of the department to discourage
complaints.

What it was talking about was the end result

of the duly authorized departmental policies.
Finally, Mr. Kearn's remarks mentioned that the
effect of the decree is actually very mild and he says if
we want to change it or if we can't live with it, we can go
back to court.
Well, we shouldn't have to go back to court.

A

41
mandatory injunction is always harsh.

It is the most extra­

ordinary form of judicial remedy and in this case it results
in the District Court taking power to itself which the
statutes of Pennsylvania place elsewhere,
QUESTION;
about the decree?

Mr. Penny,may I ask you a question

As I read it, whenever a complaint is

filed resulting in disputed facts, an adversary hearing is
then required,
MR, PENNY;
QUESTION;
MR. PENNY;

Yes, your Honor.
Is that correct?
1 believe — well, first of all, this

only goes to complaints which don't allege criminal conduct.
If the complaint alleges criminal conduct, it is elsewhere.
QUESTION;
MR. PENNY;

Yes.
And when I say criminal conduct, I

am not sure if the judge intended to subsume federal
criminal conduct, which may take this case out of all civil
rights violations also but where, in a nonfrivolous, non­
criminal complaint, there is a factual dispute, the case is
supposed to be moved to a substantially altered police board
of inquiry which is to conduct hearings for the purpose of
resolving the issues and determining the liability of the
officers.
QUESTION:

That is an adversary proceeding, as

I judge, with counsel, the right to examine and cross-examine

42

witnesses, and that right is required.
MR. PENNY:

Yes, your Honor, the Complainant has

the right to be represented by counsel, to cross-examine
the police officers, there is a stenographic record taken
and it is available to any complainant so long as he avers
a case where there is a factual dispute.
QUESTION:

Is that new procedure in Philadelphia?

MR. PENNY:

Very new, your Honor.

What the court has done here, and I try to point
this out in the brief, is create a system which is a mirror
image of the court.
The police department’s regulations are designed,
disciplinary regulations, are designed to go at violations of
police regulations.

They were never designed to provide an

open forum for the people v?ho have complaints about the
police department.

It is a disciplinary tool and it involves

a police officer and his relation to the department.
Under the existing procedures, the complainant
has no right to counsel.

He has no right to demand a

hearing and he has no right to accuse or to confront the
accused in the present situation,

though I believe he does

have this right under the court's decree.
QUESTION:

Under the decree, would the policeman

still be entitled to assert Fifth Amendment rights or is
that gone, too?

43
MR. PENNY:

I don't imagine that Judge Fuliam

would require the waiver of the Fifth Amendment rights.

It

does present a severe hardship to the police officer who is,
on the one hand, a defendant in the civil suit for damages
and on the other hand must submit to this procedure within
the police department, in this procedure contemplated by
Judge Fullam.

It —

QUESTION:

In all seriousness, I suppose his

answers would be admissible against him in a civil suit for
damag :s.
MR. PENNY:

That is precisely my point, your Honor,

because there is stenographic record taken and he would be
testifying under oath.

I think it is the best form of

discovery available for any Civil Right3 plaintiff.
file the complaint.

He'd

He'd go to the department and get

everything he wants and it certainly puts the department or
the police officer at a severe disadvantage in the subsequent
civil rights suit for damages.
One further point, Mr. Chief Justice, with your
example regarding the assessors.

This really goes far

farther because with at least the assessors you have a finite
number of homes.
There is only a certain number of properties to
assess and there are only a certain number of problems that
could arise.

With the police department there is literally

44
almost an infinite number of chances for something to occur
and I think that the scope of this is far beyond your
example of the assessors and this is an extremely, extremely
substantial interference with the rights of the police
department and the rights of the Defendant city officials here
where the court has refused to find that they violated anyone9s
constitutional rights and repeats that ---- says that twice
during its opinion.,
I thank you, your Honors,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
