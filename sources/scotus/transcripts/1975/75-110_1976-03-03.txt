MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We’ll hear arguments next

in 75-110 , Sakraida against Ag Pro, Incorporated*
Mr, Tatern, you may proceed whenever you’re ready*
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B0 TATEM, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TATEM;

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please the

Court t
My name is Steve Tatem from El Paso, Texas, and I
represent the Petitioner in this case, that has been sued for
violating United States Lsfcfcars Patent entitled "Dairy Establish­
ment" ,
The patent was filed on November the 5th of 1963,
and was finally issued an November the 14th of 1965.
It has .been admitted in this case and so found by the
Fifth Circuit chat every element in this patent, consisting of
13 elements, is old in the art,
In a part of the Fifth Circuit opinion, which has
validated this patent on the basio that it exhibite novelty and
is not obvious, the court has specifically said that while this
honorable court rejected its rationale in Graham, when it
validated a patent, on the basis that an old result in a
cheaper and otherwise mors advantageous way, although the
court rejected that proposition, the Fifth Circuit in this
case confessed that it was ignorant as to what test, if any,

4
this court substituted for what it had struck out.
It is submitted that tills case is controlled and
governed by the decisions in this case * rendered by this
Court in Andersoncs-Dlack Rock* Graham vs, John Deere* A&P* and
Lincoln Englneering,
It is our position ‘chat the Court of Appeals erred in
setting aside the trial court findings on three different
occasions* to the effect -that this combination patent did not
show novelty* nonobviousness* and that under Rule 52 they are
supported by credible evidence* were not clearly erroneous*
and

they were reached by a proper application of the law to

the facts.
QUESTION:

is it pretty well settled in the federal

courts generally that findings of novelty vel non* utility
vel non* obviousness vel non of a district court era subject
to the standards'of Rule 52* i,e, * that there are findings of
fact not of law?
MR, TATEMs

Hr, Justice* it is my understanding* and

I confess that I am not a patent attorney * this* by chance* is
the first patent cas© that I have ever had th© pleasure to b©
dealing with.

But as I understand the law and this Court’s
case* while the three inquiries that

are risked under Section 10 3 are considered factual inquiries*
the final determination as to whether or not a patent is or is
not valid is a question of law to which this Court and only

5
this Court is the finsi arbiter,
1 am also of the opinion -that the question of novelty
would be in that same category,
QUESTION; Well, Mr, T atern , I don’t know if Justice
Stewart feels completely satisfied with your answer to his
question, but I, at any rate, am left with some uncertainty.
You say it is initially s question of fact, but in
the last analysis it's a question of law.

Does that mean only

when it’s so clear that .reasonable people couldn’t disagree,
or only when it falls outside the clearly erroneous standard
is it a question of law, or is this basically a question of
law initially, rather than a question of fact?
MR, TATEM;

Well, I believe that the validity of a

patent, is a question of law.

In making that, determination,

whether it is the trial court or the Court of Appeals or this
Court, of necessity, in reaching the question of whether or
not it is noncbvious, there are certain factual inquiries that
lay the predicate as to whether or not the final decision,
obviou'jo-nenbbviousness, is one of law,
I think that it is relevant in undeistending what
is involved in this particular patent, and the only —- the
only means that we’re talking about in this particular patent
that is allegedly new and outside the prior art, is the mans
to house or hold water at the upper end of a dairy barn in a
pool, or on the floor, so that when it -- so that, it can be

6
released suddenly, to flow downhill, and as it, flows downhill
the natural propensity of water removes manure that is on
or on deposit on trie concreta floor.
I think it is important for this Court to understand,
first, what are the basic features of what I refer to as a
standard Grade A dairy barn floor plan, and tine reason for that
is that they are fairly standard, they are regulated, in order
to b ■ able to sell and produce Grade A milk, you have to have
certain sanitary conditions in order to be entitled to that
type of production.
First, basic to a modern dairy is the fact that the
floor is concrete, it. is paved.

It generally slopes downhill

towards a drain. The reason for that is to allow or to assist
water that is or the floor to be removed.

The floor itself

is contoured, ox* it is shaped to try to avoid puddles,
may or may not b-s grooves in the concrete.

There

The grooves would

allow or assist water to remove manure 'that may be deposited on
the floor,
QUESTION;

Would the diagram, this Exhibit A,

show us what it’s like, Mr, Tatera?
At page 27 of the Exhibit — of the Appendix,
That's the patent, I gather,
MR, TATEM;

Well, Mr. Kolisch has reproduced in a

Supplemental Appendix, beginning on page 11, his patent
QUESTION;

Pag® 11 of what?

7
MR. TATEM:

Of tiie Supplemental Appendix, which is

this one0
Mow, tli© patent is also in evidence and is a part
of the single™volume Appendix, although I confess it is a little
harder to read, because it's small.
QUESTION: That's the one I think I was looking at,
Mr. Tatem, isn't, it?
MR. TATEM:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Well, then, it's also —
MR. TATEM:

I would just refer you to the larger

one, because it’s easier? at page 11.
QUESTION:

Yes.

There’s also a movie, I understand,

from reading the briefs, now cut down to a two-and-a~half«minute
movie, that the respondents at least tell us we ought to look
at before we try to —*
MR. TATEM:

Well, in all candor, Mr. Justice, the

tend-a-half-minute movie was not. in evidence.

There is a

larger one —- there is a larger movie, I think it was about
15 or 20 minutes.
QUESTION:

That's what I understood from reading the

brief, but that what's filed here is about a two-and-a-hal£minute version.

Maybe I misunderstood the brief.

We can hoar

from Respondents•
MR. TATEM:

There may be one that is filed.

may be one that is filed.

But —

Thera

8
QUESTIONS

If there is on® that is filed, do you

object to the fact that, some of us have looked at it?
MR. TATEMs

Well, --

QUESTION;

We thought it was in the record*

QUESTION;

I thought it was — there was a raovi© in

the record, played for the court.
MR. TATEMs There was a movie in tine record, Your
Honor, but that was the one that was introduced in the trial
eroufe before Judge Guinn in El Paso, and it’s about 15 or 20
minutes.
Now, as I understand, the one that has been asked to
be shown in argument is an edited movie, not from the same
one, and wa would object to that being shown, because it is an
attempt to supplement the record.

Or it is not the same movie

that was —**
QUESTION:

Well, it’s a reduction of the record? it

MR. TATEMs

I don’t know that it’s from the same

has

movie, Your Honor.
QUESTION:
goes to the record.

It goes to the record as an Appendix
It’s an abbreviation.

MR. TATEMs

Well, —

QUESTION:

Well, you say you don't know whether it's

abbreviation of the movie in the record? is that it?
MR, TATEMs That is true.

9

QUESTION;

Well, is it your position that a Justice

of the Court who had seen that two or three»minute movie ought
to disqualify himself?
QUESTION:

I donst think we should let Justice

Rehnquist out of this case on that basis0
[Laughter» J
QUESTION; What is your reply to 'that question?
QUESTION;

[Laughing]

You've got two!

MR. TATEM;

No, I don't want to disqualify any judge»

I can't make a decision on that, because I haven't seen the
movie; -that you're thinking about.

I don't want you to dis­

qualify
QUESTION;

I haven't seen it, Mr. Tafcern.

I gather

from what you've said, you feel I ought not look at it.
JjTlo TATE?:;

If it’s not the same movie in evidence?

that’s right.
QUESTION;

Well. I —

MR. TATEM:

But I wouldn’t say that the movie is

going to disqualify a judge that has looked at it.
QUESTION:
MR. TATE 11 s
QUESTION:

I know, but I haven't seen it.
Yes, sir.
I didn't even know it was being shown.

I didn't ©van know it was here.
MR. TATEM:

If there's a movie that the Court wants

to see, the one that was in evidence is 15 or 20 minutes.

10
QUESTIONS Well, that's not hera, I gather»
I

MR» TATEM:
QUESTION;
MR. TATEMs

I think it is»
Oh, it is?
So far as I understand it, it is»

I was asked very specifically to have all of the
exhibits

from the Fifth Circuit up here, and I was under the

impression that that was -QUESTION: Well, in any event, if I look at any, I
should look at that and not at the two-and-a-half-minute
abbreviated version.

That's your position,

MR, TATEM: That would be my position»
QUESTION:

All right.

QUESTION: Counsel, the Respondent’s brief says the
two-and-a-half-minute film strip was shown to the Fifth
Circuit at the argument on the merits, so you must have seen
it then.
MR, TATEM:
QUESTION:
MR. TATEM;

No, sir? I was not at the Fifth Circuit,
Oh, I see.
It was my understanding, as long as the

matter has been raised, that the movie that was offered to the
Fifth Circuit was from the same movie.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. TATEM: We are not sure now»

It may be»

3ut I’m

saying that there has bean some question raised about it, and
I am not in a position to say because I did not see the movie.

11
QUESTION:

Well, I hope you and your fellow counsel

get this straightened out, because I frankly had been planning
to look at the movie, because I can often understand -things
better that way, by contrast,
bfeeprintso

-chan looking at drawings and

And so if, promptly after the argument, you and

counsel would get together, either

saying this is properly a

part of this case, or isn't? I would be interested in knowing,
because I had been planning to look at the movie.
MR. TATEM: All right, sir.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

And indicate, if you

will, which it. was that the Fifth Circuit saw; that is, the
two-and-a~half-minute abridged version or -Che full version.
Because we should certainly have available to us whatever the
Fifth Circuit saw, if we want to look at it.
MR. TATEM:

All right,, sir.

I believe

I may be

wrong, but I thought -die Fifth Circuit had two movies there.
I may be wrong, but I thought all the exhibits were also before
the Fifth Circuit.
All right.

On top of the floor ara cow stalls,

feeding area, milking area, and holding area.

And the cow, of

necessity, needs to walk from various areas to the other on
this concrete floor.
Also, in a standard dairy barn is some type of
trough or tank, which holds the water.
Now, I submit to the Court that in the mid-1960*s,

12
when the application for this particular patent, was submitted#
and if we look at the definition of how Webster defines "flush"#
to mean a sudden release or washout# sudden rapid flow of
water to flood# it would be most difficult to come up with a
new idea that added to the sum of useful knowledge with a
"flush system"»
Because, by definition, we*re dealing with water that
must be suddenly released, as a rapid rate of flow, to wash
out,, to flow or to flood, in order’ to have a flush system,
by definition»
The Respondent’s expert, Mr» Huber, has given us a
detailed explanation of how this flush concept works»

It's

in the Appendix beginning at page 114 -through 116? but his
basic concept is that, when water begins to flow, it creates
energy# which serves as a cleaning action»

And that the

natural propensity of water, as it flews downhill, is to have
the bottom of -the water onto the floor, the top surface of
the water goer farter# and therefore, as the water flews
downhill, it has a natural cleaning action»
The basic propensity of water is generally related
to -the amount of water released, or to the slope.or the. grade
of the floor onto which it is released.
Now, when we get to this point in the record, and
it was in the record before, it is in our briefs, we have
cited this reference before, X think it is relevant, to discuss

13
this legend of Hercules.,,

What did he do?

It is recorded, it

is only a legend, but it is recorded in Greek Mythology, that
as Hercules, as his fifth labor,saw the conditions of the
stables, he, at a single glance, diverted -the stream, Alpheus,
to clean the stables of the filthy manure on the floor.
QUESTIONS

Is that the basis for your claim of non™

obviousness?
MR. TATEHi

No, sir, it is not.
It helps, though, doesn't it?

questions

MR. TATEMs

It certainly does.

I would cite the Court —
QUESTION;

How long did it take them to reduce that

concept to practice?
[Laughter.

]

MR. TATEM:

Well -- well, I would say until the time

of the bucket.
[Laughter. j
MR. TATEMs

Because,it is submitted, and again I

have to be in all candor with the Court,

it seems that this

tank is simply the release of ~~ we’re talking about a tank
that has 2,000 gallons of waters and releasing 2,000 gallons
of water, of itself is going to bring about some action#

And

v/e maintain that that is not a novel idea, it does not add to
the sum of useful knowledge«
But I do direct the Court's attention to some prior

14
art that is recorded and that is set out in some detail,
beginning on page 5 of our Reply Brief*
The first of the patents is the McCornack patent#
which — again it is much more legible if you look in the blue
Appendix, it's much larger,

beginning on page 550

The McCornack patent, by chance, is named "Dairy
Plant”, the patent we’re talking about is "Dairy Establishment"*
%

The patent of McCornack was issued on June the 1st of 1937»
But the McCornack patent deals with the idea of trying to save
labor, both as to the milking and removal of manure operation
and for disposing of the manure or slurry as a natural
fertilizer after the operation is complete.
McCormack teaches that —- and they also use the word
"flush” specifically in these specifications — that the milking
benches and gutters are washed, the water flows from the shieldst
flushes simultaneously by means of a common valve.

McCornack

haachss that what happens is, is that the operator who is
located near the rear of the cows steps on a foot pedal in
the floor that releases the'water against the shields, which
flows downhill.
I also cite the Court’s attention to the patent of
Bogert, which begins on page 5 through 7 of the Reply Brief.
Bogcrt specifically deals with an apparatus for cleaning the
surfaces of barns.

Its application for patent was issued on

March the 4th of 1941.

15

Now, in Bogart, Bogart refers to "a fluid cleaning
medium", which, when you read the specifications, is water»
Bogert refers to a "fluid cleaning medium supply tank", which
is attached on the floor at the upper end of this particular
barn, which, when a "cap valve" — and 1 direct the Court's
attention to the visualisation of this, it’s very similar to
the top of a commode seat; it's on page 75„

That's his basic

layout»
But, be that as it may, this, if you will, commode
seat is picked up by a chain which causes the water to be
stored in this "fluid cleaning medium supply tank", to go
downhill by gravity and then enter the various gutters»
Now, 1 want to point out specifically that in Bogart,
which is the March 4, '41 patent, the cows were arranged so
that the manure of necessity fell into a gutter, it did not
flow onto the floor.

So, therefore, the fluid from the "fluid

cleaning medium supply tank" only flushed the gutter.
The patent in question, the cows are — 'the manure is
not necessarily deposited in such a manner.

In other words,

it is not accumulated solely in the gutter, so his tank is
wider.
I want to refer the Court specifically to the
language of the Patent Office, on page 13 through 15 of my
brief.
In examining these;: prior art publications, the Patent

16

Office said this;

"Since the patent to McCormack discloses

that it is old in the art to flush cattle stalls and to collect
•the waste for fertilizer, it is held to bs an obvious
expedient under 35 U.S.Co 103 to provide the Kruetzer dairy
establishment with such a flushing means and waste collection
tankaG
On page —
QUESTION; Before you go on, Mr. Tatam, I’m trying
to got something clear from this opinion.

There’s some

suggestions in the Fifth Circuit opinion that indicate that
the Fifth Circuit, in effect, determined that, you had not
exercised due diligence and that 'this was not really newly
discovered evidence, that —
MR, TATEM:

No, sir.

QUESTION:
penalized for that.
'-aRo. TATEM;
Fifth Circuit said.

I —

and that you are, at least in part,
What do you have to say about that?
Mr. Chief Justice, that is what the
The prior art that I am talking about is

not what the Fifth Circuit was talking about.
QUESTION:

Well, was the

Mission procedure

fundamentally like yours?
MR. TATEM:

It has been conceded by the Respondent

that it was identical to their patent, but that we haven’t ~~
I have not talked about Mission Dairy yet.
necessary, at this point in time, for me —

Maybe it is

17
QUESTIONs

Well, you corns to it whenever you want,

but just to he sure that you give us some information about
that aspect of the; ces«i»
MR» TATEM:

All righto

What I simply wanted to do

— and it is my position that the record before, that was mad®
before Judge Guinn, that went up tc the Fifth Circuit with
respect to the McCornack and Bogert patents,

as well as the

other evidence, was sufficient for this Court to apply the
four Supreme Court cases I have brought to the Court’s
attentiono
let me bring up what happened procedural lye
In January of 1973, my client, who then was living
in Florida, by chance met Mr, Herbert Meyer, who happened to
bs in Florida»

At that particular time in January of "73, we

had not received a decision, the second decision from the
Fi f th Ci rcui t.
In February of 573, the Fifth Circuit reversed for
the second time this patent application — I mean this patent
case»
We filed at that time, when we had received notice
that the second case had been reversed, a motion for rehearing,
addressed to the Fifth Circuit, raising the question that Mr»
Sakrsida had,only three weeks

before, personally met the earned

man who owned the Mission Dairy in Gonzales, California»

It

was at that time that the Fifth Circuit directed us, since we

18

were the appellee, to bring this motion to the attention of
the trial court, because they were the only medium through which
we could set to get a record; so we did that0
We filed a motion pursuant to the direction of the
Fifth Circuit with the trial court in El Paso,
different trial court that was sent from

There was a

San Antonio, Texas,

to El Paso to receive the testimony with respect to Mr»
Herbert Meyer, Mr* Bud Sakraida, Mra Chester Whitmojre and
Mr, Frank Souza.

Those exhibits, together with the pictures

from Herb Meyer's dairy are also before the Court as Exhibits
A through K„
following that hearing, Judge Wood, up until that
timef had had nothing to do with this case, also entered
findings of fact and conclusions of law.

He found that the

patent lacked novelty, it did not.meet the test of obviousness ?
it was anticipated by this prior art, and that the Petitioner
had exercised due diligence in discovering the name of the
witnesses, because they arose simply out of a by-chance
meeting somewhere in the State of Florida in January of '73,
QUESTION!

What about the statement of the Fifth

Circuit opinion — if I'm reading the right opinion — cn page
3a of the Appendix.

Sakraida testified that that occasion

you speak of was the first time he had full knowledge of these
factsj however — this is the important part — the evidence
clearly establishes that prior to the original trial Sakraida

19
was aware that.

Mission Dairy was using a flushing system

which was a possible source of prior art»
MR. TATEMt Hell, —
QUESTION % And that Sakraida had sent one of his men
over to look at it before the trial, and he reported he wasn't
able to see it»
MR. TATEM;

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, Judge Wood's

findings on that very point —
QUESTION; Before or after this opinion?
MR. TATEM: Before.

He was the trial court that

accumulated that record, and attended that hearing.
appear in the record first at page 174 through
175.

Second, they appear in the Appendix at page 268.

But

he is clear and he gave credence to our testimony that —
my light is on. do you want me to continue?

All right.

QUESTION; vt want To find out .about it.
MR* TATEM;

He gave credence to our testimony that

until this by-chance meeting we never identified anything with,
respect to Mission Dairy.
QUESTION;

But the Court of Appeals uses the term

"clearly establishes”, and they are referring to something
that is contrary to what the district court found, which would
suggest to me that they are making a determination of
* clearly erroneous!!.
MR. TATEM:

Wall ~~ but, Mr. Chief Justice, the nams

20

of Mayer is ths

.ink to Mission Dairy»

Because until you find

Mr„ Mayer, you’re not; able to ascertain what it was that was
in existence at Mission Dairy»

Because Mr0 Meyer held the key

to that»
The testimony in the record is essentially to this
effect*

Between the date that the summary judgment was gifanted

and Idi© date of the merits, my client, was living in the Stats*
of Florida,

The Mission Dairy is in the State of California»

The trial was pending in El Paso, Texas,
Through rumors, source unknown, the record is that
Mr, Sakraida ~~ it was through a rumor suggested, it was
suggested to him that he go to Mission Dairy and check out
what it was that was there*
Since he was living in the State of Florida, he asked
e man who sold milking equipment, a man identified as a Mr*
Wisdom, who was living in the State of Oregon, that the next
time he was cown in the area to go by the dairy and try to
find out what was there.
The testimony is that when he went to the Mission
1 airy, ha received a rebuff by the manager, a Mr. Dick Ripley»
ha was not ~~ he got to the preraises, but he was not able to
get in and supposedly find out about this flushing gat© that
they had.
He called our client about the rebuff, and we did
rot know anything mors, about it than what we’d been informed

21
about by Mr» Wisdom.
The name of Herbert Meyer is an assumption that the
Respondent would have us believe was linked at the same time
we went to Mission Dairy.

Thera is absolutely no evidence

in the Appendix as to where Herbert Meyer was, when Mr.
Wisdom was in California, that we knew Mr. Meyer’s name.
And the trial court chose to believe us on those facts.
And that's why that — findings to that affect is so clear
with respect to that.
QUESTION:

Mr. Tatam, even assuming that the trial

court was right in finding that this was newly discovered
evidence# it wasn't prior art, was it?

Because it wasn’t

that Mission — doesn’t the record show that Mission Dairy
came into being after the patentee's device was reduced to
practice, and less than a year before the application?
MR, xM'EM:

Mr. Justice Stevens, the evidence with

respect to Herbert Maver is that in January of ’62 he had
plans on file with the California Soil Conservation Service
with respect to his idea.
QUESTION:

But isn’t there a finding, or isn't it

undisputed that the Mission idea was reduced to practice in
October?
MR. TATEM: As far as mining operations•

It is our

position that the Mission Dairy, though, is clearly evidence
of

oirsry skill in *Pv:

erfc;

end that was part of the heals

22
of what ws were using it®
QUESTION:

But you don't contend there was prior

art?
0

MR® TATEM:

We do®

Because I think you ~ I don't

think —
QUESTION:

On what theory?

MR. TATEM: The fact -that the idea was known and made
public a year prior to the application of this patent, and
that is, when you go down to the California Soil Conservation
people, or the Department of the Agriculture, and file youx
plan*;'.; to get approval as to what you're going to build or do,
that you have — that you have reduced, in essence, or have
publicized -*»
QUESTION:

You. say the filing of the plan for this

big barn was a reduction to practice? is that what you're
saying?
MR. TATEM:

I'm saying he's publicizing his idms0

Obviously there's a time lapse between when he actually filed
the plan and when he actually got the equipment

you sea,

the problem was not getting the dairy started, I mean he hei —
some of tiiis was getting the milking equipment there.
That is part of the problem.
QUESTION:

I understand the practical problems, I'm

just not sure I understand your legal theory.
Your legal theory is that the filing of the plans for

23

something that had not yet bean reduced to practice was prior
art.
MR® TATEM:

Mr. Chief Justice, on page 14 through 16

of our Reply Brief, we hava addressed that vary point with
several cases, the relevancy of Mission Dairy as prior art or
evidence of ordinary skill in the art.
QUESTIONS Wall, I understood you to be arguing that
it was not prior art, but it, nevertheless, was evidence that
this was not a very inventive concept.
MR. TATEMs

Wall, —

QUESTIONS

Because somebody els© simultaneously

developed it.

Which is a different argument.

MR. TATEM:

We're saying that it was effectively

publicized at the time he goes to California and files those
plans.

Now, that — but that's just Herbert Meyer.
Cheater Whitmore's plan was written in the Hoards

Dairyman as early

as '53.

Frank Sousa was building dairy

QUESTION:

That’s true.
Well, I would have thought, at least it's

possible, that the preliminary question is whether or not the
Court of Appeals was correct in its ruling on your 60(b)(2)
motion.

And if we disagree with the Court of Appeals, then,

arguably, the correct disposition on our part would be to remand,
it to the Court of Appeals, with direction to consider that
so-called newly discovered evidence.
Isn’t that right?

Well, --

MR. TATEM:

is whether or not the Court of Appeals should reconsider this
case on all of the evidence that you've now tried to introduce,
instead of only on part of it. because they held that your
60(b)(2) motion was not well taken.
MR. TATEM: Well, Mr. Justice, it is my position that
the record is sufficient, as it was at the Fifth Circuit
before we went back to the third hearing befor© Judge Guinn -before Judge Wood.
I do think -that this Court, if it feels that there
is any doubt as to the validity of this case, it should
consider this case

it should consider the evidence that

was offered before Judge Wood, and —*

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. PIERRE KOLISCH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KOLISCHs

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please 'the

Court;
My name is Pierre Kolisch, and I represent the
patentees.
Very simply, my client's invention is for solving
che problem of nontoilet-trained cows.
[Laughter. ]
MR. KOLISCH' j

The prior art, which my brother Tatera

has talked about, and particularly the McCornack and the Bogart
patents -~
QUESTION;

Counsel, having brought that analogy in,

I wonder if you think it would be appropriate for us to take
judicial notice of the common variety of toilets available
to everybody1, in considering the obviousness of -this case?
MR. KOLISCH:
Stevens.

Yes, I certainly do, Mr, Justice

And, as you know, there is a completely different

principle under which the ordinary toilet works.

27
QUESTIONS What's the difference?
question s

A water closet»

MR» KOLISCHs Well, the ordinary toilet, you have a
bowl and then you have a pipe that comes down and bends around,
and that pipe comes up to approximately the level of the water
in the toilet, and that pip© always remains full of water»
It acts as a blockage or a trap to the sewer»
And whan you add more water, simply put more water
in. whether by bucket; or otherwise, then there is sufficient
pressure and it just pushes down- and it empties out the pipe
that comas up»
QUESTION:

But in common they have the hudraulic

pressure, do they not?
MR» KOLISCH: Well, I think that any cleaning, whether
it's by hose or whether it's by bucket or in any way, everyone
has been trying to get rid of cow manure in barns for about
thousands of years *-*■• I can't tall you how long»
And we know ~~ I think this is a good place to
start.

We;’re considering a patent here which is made up,

admittedly, of a combination of mechanical elements.
And whenever we deal with a patent, of that type,
there are a number of semantic and ideological, pitfalls, which
the courts, I believe,•have had trouble wrestling with»
I would suggest to you that one way of approaching
this patent, and perhaps avoiding some of these pitfalls, is

28

to consider., first, what these two inventors did, and then how
they did it.
Now, the record establishes that the bast way of
cleaning dairy barn floors, up until the time of this invention,
was by the use of power.

Now, power, I mean the use of a

power-driven blade, a front-end loader which would get all the
manures together in a pile, and then the manure would be
removed to some place and ultimately the manure had to be
taken and placed on the fields surrounding it.
Now, in order to do a proper cleanup job, that type
of a scraping operation had to be followed by a hosing
operation.

Now, the necessity for the hosing operation was ■*■■■

and we're talking about commercial dairies, we’re talking

about dairies whars there are hundreds of cows involved —- is
that when you scraps a floor, which has been covered with
manure, you leave a thin, slippery film, and this is exceedingly
dangerous to it;

cows as well as to anybody who is walking

on it.
So you have to follow up the scraping operation with
a hosing operation.
Now, once you’ve done that, you then have to get rid
of it. And still you haven’t solved the problem.
Mow, you could, of course, start by hosing, and
that sometimes is dona, but that won’t work on a 300-foot

alleyway, fcae&uca oner you start hosing, I think, as any of

29

you know, you are starting to splash things all over the
place* tod, besides that, all that you do by a hosing operation
is to force it into piles*

And in the end even your hose is

not going to dislodge these piles*
So what did these too inventors do?

They cam® along

and they solved a problem, and the record shows that to clean
up a comparable alleyway, three or four hundred feet long,
would take four or five hours*

Literally, in one minuta,

according to the patented invention, just as long as it takes
to wave my hand, you've cleaned it»
Now, what you’ve done is you hava substituted for
hours of dirty, disagreeable, miserable labor, a shining
clean floor that takes no time, no effort, no money, and
satisfies all of toe sanitary requirements, plus being
ecologically extremely sound. Because what you’ve done,
according to the system, is you've put the manure in a form
so that it can be put through a sprinkler system and put on
the surrounding fields.
Now, what X have described is precisely what Gribble
end Bennett invented.

This is what they contributed to the

dairy Industry.
Now, let me pick up where ray brother Tatam did,
with respect to these too prior art patents»
And those ware, Mr, Chief Justice, in the record
before the district court? it is undisputed that they are

30
properly before this Court.
1 tliink they exemplify the best of the prior art„
They show that the technology was to install pipes all over
a dairyo
Now , the McCornack patent is extremely detailed and
complicated piece of equipment„ But basically what he showed
was that there are partitions between the cows during their
milking area — they refer here to cow shields,
QUESTIONS

Is there a diagram in the record that

shows
MR» KGLISCK:

Yes0

I think if you were to look at

the Supplemental record, on page 62, Figure 14 —

do not dispute that if the cows aren't careful enough to drop
their offal in the gutter, it will be removed,

MiR, KOLISCH:

No,

It talks in 'idle patent that

there may be use ~~ that it may be necessary to use hand
cleaning also, because this does not cover all the barn floor’s
area.

It is simply - QUESTION:

But, let me change the question slightly,

to the extent that this device is intended to flush portions

would previously be cleaned manually?
MRa KOLISCH:

No.

I think that under the McCornack

patent, thor.e portions where the water is discharged in the
gutters and on the shield that supposedly they would be cleaned.
However, it is not the same concept as the invention.
QUESTION: What’s the difference in concept?
MR. KOLISCH:

Yes•

The difference in the concept

is the difference between taking a hose and
QUESTION: But this is not a hose.
MR. KOLISCH:

This does not describe using hoses.

MRa KOLISCH:
QUESTION:

McCornack’s is a hose0

MR. KOLISCH:

oh, yes.

It’s water under pressure.

It’s a series of pipeswhether -- it all comes from water
under pressure.

They are just pipes that are —

QUESTIONs

So,, is: the difference in concept the

different method of getting the water propelled through the
gutters?
MRo KOLISCHs Well, it’s e difference in the way in
which the water acts one® it is released, whether it8s a pipe
or a hose, the water comes out in the form of th© artifice
from which it is being discharged, and it is point impingement,
and it must be, whether it comas from a pipe —

So the difference in concept is one hug©

flow rather than several separate flows simultaneously, is
that it?

pipes, and gutters.

The invention eliminates all hoses,

There simply aren’t any in the invention.

No such thing as hoses, pipes and gutters, all of which are
in the prior art and are necessary in the prior art? the
same: thing in —■
QUESTIONs The difference, then, is the difference
betw ;en cleaning everything at once and cleaning only a portion
of the barn?
MR. KOLISCHs
QUESTION:

Well, and also —

I’m trying to articulate

what the

difference is.
MR. KOLISCH:

I appreciate that, Mr. Justice. Stevens•

But it is more than that, it is the way in which it is done•
It’s the difference between releasing a tidal wave or a flood

34
and having water come out of a pipe, or a hose»
Now, in both cases there's water —
QUESTION s

But the water comes out of many pipes

simultaneously ?
MR» KOLISCK:

Yese

But many pipes simultaneously,

you simply have, perhaps, this type of effects

a spray

effect, in effect» But it is not hydraulically, it does not
operate in the same way at all»

Because the pipe-discharged

water simply cannot do the job which the flood release water
does»
I think a good example is shovm in the Bogert patent,
which was another one»

1 think if you look at. page 75, you

see a top plan view»
Page 75. you see cow stalls to the left and to the
right, and those are indicated at 5 and 6»

Then behind each

of the cows there is a gutter, No» 12 and No» 13»
In h-s-twQ‘?n those gutters there's a cow walkway»
The lines which you see, dotted lines in there, are embedded
underground pipes which run under the cow walkway and then
discharge at a plurality of places into the gutters, 12 and 13»
The water from ~~ the water for those pipes comes
from a large tank, and that's shown on page 77, at Figure 7»
QUESTION: We're in a different patent now, aren't we?
The Bogert one»

MU KOLISCK:

Yes, I'm calking about Bogert now,

35

because it's still the same principle as McComack, and I
think -these are illustrative of the prior art»
Figure 7 on page 77 of the Supplemental record -•~
I’m sorry# Supplemental Appendix# shows the large tank and
there are pipe connections which come in and are shown at the
bottom, with numbers 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21, and the water
simply runs out from these pipes, under pressure, and is fed
into the gutter at various places„
Now, this — now, the problem, for instance, with
Bogert and all the others, and that’s why I started somewhat
facetiously in saying that the invention had to do with cows
who were not toilet or gutter train-ado
Bogert, 1 will assume, works perfectly well as long
«

as the cows remain positioned over the gutters»

But, as we

all know, cows don’t remain that way, and whan the cows roam,
walk up and down this broad alleyway, which is marked S, there
isn’t any way of cleaning them, there isn’t any provision,
there isn’t any suggestion as to how to get rid. of that.
And that, of course, was the genius of this invention»

For

the first 'time it was — a. dairyman was enabled to wash all
of his floor areas immediately without the use of any labor,
without the use of any power»
Her© was a situation where you could get rid of it,
all of the problems and all of the help that you had in connec­
tion with the removal

obviousness is treated as an issue of law by the Courts of
Appeals generally?
MR. KOLISCH:

In the end it comas , but -there are

certain factual bases -QUESTION!
Justice Stewarto

Yese but that's not what you answered Mr„

He asked you, on the issue of obviousness,

does Rule 52(a) apply?
MR® KOLISCH;

Moc

I think that the ultimate

question —
QUESTION:

Your answer was no to that, I taka it?
/

MRq KOLISCH;

the ultimate question is on® of

law,
QUESTION; And that was the ruling of the Fifth
Circuit»
MR» KOLISCH;

Yes»

QUESTION; The underlying historical fact questions,
they said clear and — or they —* that was a Rule 52 question»
MRo KOLISCII:

Yes®

QUESTION; But. the ultimat® issue was a law question®
MR. KOLISCH;
QUESTION:

Yes, I believe it is a law question®

On the second appeal to the Fifth Circuit,

did the Fifth Circuit conclude that any of the district court
findings on th? three parts of the Graham test were clearly
erroneous?

47
MRo KOLISCH:

Yes,

In fact- the Fifth Circuit

%

found that there was really no evidence to support 'the findings
of the district court.
And tiiat

brings me to the question of th© newly

discovered evidence, which there are good procedural as well
as substantive reasons, I think, for rejecting it.
The first one is th© jurisdictional question, which
4

I have raised with respect to whether or not this is properly
here.

And that is in my brief,

question,

That's a pur® jurisdictional

I admit I raised it for th® first time here,

I

didn't think about it before. But it's jurisdictional, and
the Court, of course, is always interested in jurisdictional
quastions„
The second one was that the documents which were
introduced at. the hearing on newly discovered evidence should
have been rejected, because those documents were deliberately
withheld and not shown to me. There was a Rule 34 motion made
to have the defendant disclose all of his evidence, documentary
evidence, which he may have on prior art.
covered Rovey, Whitmore, and all the rest.

That would have
That was not

disclosed.
Thirdly, with respect to the Mission Dairy and Mr,
Meyer’s testimony, Mr, Meyer and the Mission Dairy were
admittedly the key to all the newly discovered evidences,
because Mr, Meyer was the one who knew about it all and tied

48
the whole thing together,,
There isn't any question -that the defendant, as well
as his attorney, knew about the Mission Dairy in October of
1969»

At that time he made a deliberate choices

”1 don't

need the Mission Dairy to win tills case”, and therefore he
didn't use the evidence.
He went through a motion for summary judgment, didn't
use it.

Two years later he went through a trial, and he didn’t

use this evidence.
After the Court of Appeals, for the second time,
reversed and said the patent is invalid, he reached back and
said, **Ahf but I have some newly discovered evidence, which
I want the court to considor.m
The court very generously, T think, sent it to back
to the district court for a hearing under 60(b)(2), and there
simply said, “Oh, we're going to let all the evidence in53, and
never passed the threshold question, which Mr. Justice Stewart
brought up:

Is this newly discovered evidence?

Because there are very strict requirements tinder
60(b) (2) .
The threshold questions were never satisfactorily
answered.

In fact, they were never answered, because under

60(b)(2) you have to show (1) it's newly discovered, (2) it
could not have been discovered by due diligence.

In this

case there isn’t any question he knew about it, and it didn’t

49

take due diligence to find out who the owner of 'the Mission
Dairy was , once you knew about the Mission Dairy. All you had
to do was to take a deposition.
So, I think that under any test? whether it's even
the Cuno testy that very controversial £lash~of~genius test
which this Court handed down
QUESTION: Da you think that's still extant?
MR. KGLISCH:

I don't think it is, Mr. Chief Justice,

but sonte times language from that decision creeps back in, and
therefor®
QUESTION:

I thought Section 102 had been — the

last sentence of it -MR. KOLISCH:
QUESTION:

Was supposedly •—

~«* was supposedly designed and deliberately

enacted to reject that test, wasn't it?
MR. KOLISCH;

Yes.

I think that that legislation

was enacted to dispense with it.
I would say this on the philosophical, ideological:
Gribbl® and Bennett are a classic case of the beneficial
effect that the patent system should have.

Now, here war©

two individuals who had nothing except some good ideas, hard
work and determination.
with
Now,/the potential of a legally enforcible right,
they went ahead and obtained a patent.
Now, based on this belief, they started with a little

50

business» they had nothing» and they succeeded in building up
a reputable business» which has received good commercial
acceptance0
Interestingly enough» this case has none of the
odious features which some of the cases before this Court
involving patents may have had.

They made the patent available

to anybody» practically for nothing.

All -that they asked was

that you pay them a fee» a one-time fee of $1500 plus one
dollar per cow.

And that means that anybody could get it.

An installation of 300 cows costs $250»000 and the rent or the
charge would foe $1800 once» and that's all.
Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER2

Thank you» gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon» at 2:14 o'clock» p.m,» the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
