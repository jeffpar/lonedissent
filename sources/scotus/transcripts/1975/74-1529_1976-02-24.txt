HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 1529, Henderson against Morgan.
Mr. Lewifetes.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL LEWITTES ON
BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. LEWITTES:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This case involves the granting of a Federal

writ of habeas corpus to a State prisoner by the United States
District Court for the Northern District of New York, wherein
th® district, court vacated a 1965 plea of guilty solely on
the grounds that th© relater, that is, th© respondent here,
was not formally advised of each legal element of th© crime
to which he pleaded where the plea was otherwise unassailable
and where th© respondent admitted th© act charged.
The Sacond Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously
affirmed without opinion the granting of th® writ.
Turning to the facts for a moment, the crime was
committed on th© night of April 6, 1965, whereupon a Mrs.
Ada Francisco, a widow, who owned a farm where th® respondent
was working, was brutally murdered in her home in Fulton
County, which is an upstate rural community in New York State,
by an assailant who stabbed her more than 40 times.

The

respondent Morgan was convicted of that murder, which occurred
while he was working on th® victim’s farm.

4
Mr. Morgan at that time was IB years old, and the
record varies as to his intelligence quotient from a range of
40 to 75.

It is noteworthy, as we will refer to later on,

that at the time of sentence there was a psychiatric report on
toe basis of a psychiatric examination at the Utica State
Hospital that the defendant, the respondent in this case, was
competent to stand trial, was able to understand the nature of
the charges, and would be able to assist in the defense.
The underlying altercation which resulted in the
commission of the crime here was no doubt the fact that the
respondent originally was a resident of fch© Rome Strafe© Hospital,
which is a division of the New York State Mental

Hygiene

Department for young defectives, mental defectives.
QUESTION?

Apparently

He was there as a patient.

MR. LEWITTES: He was there as a patient, your Honor,
that8s correct.

And apparently his record was good enough

so that he was released out to various farms, and in particular
in this case to the farm of the decedent where h© worked.
Apparently as well, there was a rule on the part of the Rome
State Hospital that those that ware released would, have to be
home by 10 o'clock at night each night, and the respondent
violated those rules and Mrs. Francisco, the decedent, told
the respondent that ha must not do that again, must not violat®
the rule, but yet he did, and she said, ’’Well, I am going to
have to tell the people at Rom© State Hospital," and respondent,

5
fearing, no doubt, that he would be returned to the State
hospital, sat, according to the record, brooded about it, and
decided that he was going to leave.
He went up to Mrs. Francisco's room with a hunting
knife in his hand.
reveals

It was not a pocket

knife, as the record

it was a hunting knife 5 inches long.

He went into

the room, awakened her, the decedent screamed, and thereupon
the respondent stabbed her approximately 44 times, ran away
with a smeill sum of money, fled in the decedent's car, drove
about 100 miles away, was involved in a head-on collision
with another car, and was taken into the hospital, whereupon
he was arrested, based upon a description of respondent.
were looking for him.

They

They did find the hunting knife in the

car, and confessions were made, the record shows.
He was arraigned about nine days afterwards to the
crime of murder in the first degree, at which time the judge
at the arraignment proceeding assigned to him two counsel, two
lawyers.
court.

The indictment murder one was read to him in open
He was advised that h@ was entitled to a jury trial

and he had a right to subpoena witnesses on his behalf and
to produce any evidence necessary for the defense.
The attorneys at the time of the arraignment,
requested that the respondent be examined psychiafcrically.
This was granted by the court.

Th© attorneys also informed

the court that they would move at that time to. obtain copies

6
of various statements made by the respondent to the police and
to the district attorney's office.
That was in April of 1965.

On June 8, 1965, respondent

in fact pleaded guilty to murder in the second degree upon the
recommendation of the district attorney and the request of the
respondent.

The defense counsel were present at that time,
/

as were members of the family.

The trial court was quite

aware of the limited intelligence of feh© respondent,and the
record shows, the plea minutes do demonstrate th© solicitude
taken by th© trial judge.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lewittes, does New York make what I

think of as a customer distinction between the first degree
murder and second degree murder that first degree would require
a predisposition as well as intent, whereas second degree,
intent would bo sufficient without predisposition—premeditation?
MR. LEWITTES:
the statute read in 1965.

That is correct.

That is the way

It has subsequently been changed,

your Honor, but at that time murder in th® first degree requires
premeditation and deliberation with intent.

Murder in the

second just required intent to effect the design to kill.
The respondent at the time of plea admitted he had
consulted with his attorney and that h® knew that he was going
to go to prison, and seven days later th© sentence was imposed
and an indeterminate term of 25 years to life.

Tha actual

minimum amount under th© statute for murder in the second

7
degree at that time was 20 years to life.
There was a plea for leniency on the part of the
defense, and before passing sentence the court did note, as is
required and was required at that time in New York State that
prior to sentence the trial judge must have before him a
presentence report and a social history report, and he did have
the report of a psychiatrist»
It is noteworthy as well that at the time of sentence
there was no surprise or disappointment either by defense
counsel or by the respondent when sentence was pronounced»
All was quiet for five years, and then five years
a
after the conviction/coram nobis application was commenced by
this respondent, and for th© first time h© now alleged that
the plea was involuntary because he was unaware of th®
consequences of the plea and he was unaware that intent was
an element, of murder in the second degree»
Th® Supreme Court in Fulton County denied the writ
without a hearing»

It determined that indeed it was voluntary,

that h® did have counsel, that ha had spoken to counsel about
it, and that it was voluntary and knowingly mad©.
This State coram nobis denial was affirmed
unanimously without opinion by th® Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court in New York State and leave to appeal was denied
by th® New York Court of Appeals on July 6, 1972»
Than following fch© procedure that

is quit® familiar

8

in my office, the State inmate then proceeded by way of a
Federal writ of habeas corpus, this time in the District Court
for -the Northern District of New York, and h@ raised the sam©
issues that he raised in the State coram nobis proceeding,
th© trial- court had failed to ascertain a factual basis for
the plea and that he was not told the elements of the crime
to which h© pleaded, what were the consequences of it»
The district court denied the Federal writ of habeas
corpus, not unlike the decision in coram nobis that

actually

tracked the decision of the State corara nobis in the State
court determination, and the district court held that the

plea

was indeed voluntary.
A certificate of probable cause was granted by the
Second Circuit Court of Appeals, and they reversed and remanded
1 may say without any request for opposition by the State
to put in opposition papers on certificate of probable cause.
QUESTION:

It was not orally argued, then, to th®

Court of Appeals.
MR. LEWITTES:
QUESTION:

It was not.

Did you know about the pendancy of the

applicable for certificate .of probable cause?

Did your office

know?
MR. LEWITTES:
QUESTION:

We did not know at that time.

No notice was given.

MR. LEWITTES;

That’s correct.

s
QUESTION:

Does a statute or rule require notice,

I wonder?
MR» LEWITTES;

I do not believe that it does.

I

may say this in all candor, however, that when the certificate
of probable cause was granted, w© did

move for a rehearing

of that, which was denied»
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR» LEWITTES:

Th© Second Circuit reversal and remand

was for an evidentiary hearing to be held in the district
court to determine whether or not the allegations raised in
th@ Federal writ of habeas corpus action —
QUESTION:

Is there any practice at all relating

to notice that you are familiar with?
MR» LEWITTES:

I can say, Mr. Justice Brennan, that

there is no hard and fast rule.

I usually find, my experience

is, that where th® relator is defended by counsel as opposed
to pro se, when he is defended by counsel we do get notice of
it.

But usually in the pro se applications, it's determined

in the first instance by th© pro s© clerk, and then through
the judges, and we don't —
QUESTION:

You mean th© clerk in the district court

or in the court of appeals?
MR. LEWITTES:

In th© Second Circuit Court of Appeals,

and very often we do not get any notice of it until th®
denial or th© permission to so proceed.

10

QUESTION?

Did they ever follow any procedure

comparable to an order to show cans© directed fco your office
why relief should not be granted?
MR» LEWITTESs
probable cause

a
Not when it comes to/certificat® of

in most cases.

QUESTION s

Does the Court of Appeals on a significant

number of occasions grant a certificate of probable cause
but not decide the casej set it down for oral argument after
granting it?
MR. LEWITTES;
QUESTION;

No, they usually remand it.

So if they grant a certificate —

MR. LEWITTES;

Oh, I am sox'ry.

They do grant a

certificate of probable«cause, and counsel is then usually
assigned if there is no counsel at that time and then the
appeal proceeds normally.
QUESTION;

So this would be the extraordinary

procedure, the one followed here.
MR. LEWITTES%
QUESTION;

That's correct.

May I ask a question?

In your brief

and in your petition, as I understand it, you take the position
that the Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, adopted a per se
rule.
MR. LEWITTES;
QUESTION;

We do.

And yet if I am reading the district

court's opinion, correctly, on page 6a of your petition for a

11
writ, bottom of page 6a# the judge under a caption entitled
"The Law" cites Boykin in the first instance and than says,
"The standard to be applied to the plea of guilty herein is
whether under all of fch© circumstances the petitioner mads a
reasoned choice, voluntarily# after proper advice, and with

ti

full understanding of the consequences."
Do you find any fault with that statement of th©
standard?
MR. L33JITTES: I find no disagreement with the statement
at all.

My disagreement, is with the application thereafter,

in spit© of that statement# the district court went on and did
formulate th© per se rule.
QUESTIONS

The district court may have decided th©

facts incorrectly# but the court said, and it stated the rule
correctly# you have just conceded, so there would be no precedent
against you# would there?
MR. LEWITTESs

Well# I am afraid I am not in agreement.

On page 8a of the appendix, and this is to th© petition, the
court cites th© statement in McCarthy and then says, "Based
upon the foregoing, 1 hold as a matter of law that petitioner's
plea of guilty was not intelligently or knowingly entered."

So it seems to me that in spit® of th® general statement at
th® beginning cf feha decision, it is clear .indeed, and it seems
also in light of th© fact

of th© remand order by th© Second

Circuit Court of Appeals that the holding was indeed that this

12
was a per se rule, that but for that, it would have been
voluntary,
QUESTION;

You are suggesting that the court has

held any time you fail to advise a person of an element of a
crime, that automatically means the plea is not voluntary»
MR» LEWITTES:
QUESTION;

That is cur understanding

of the case.

If the word "fact" had been substituted

for th® word "law" in the passage you read us, you wouldn't
b© so sure that it was a
MR. LEWITTES;

per se rule,-would you?
Well, I might be because if it read,

"I hold as a matter of fact that petitioner's plea of guilty was
not intelligently or knowingly entered and was, therefore,
involuntary," I still would fear that that mere fact rather
than the us© of the word "lav;" still could render a guilty
plea involuntary.
QUESTION;

Well, based on your submission, it would

have been an erroneous factual determination in

this case.

But if the district court's opinion contained, as my brother
Powell pointed out it did contain, a statement of the proper
general principles to be applied, -this would then be a single
erroneous case, in your submission,
MR. LEWITTES;
QUESTION;

Yss.

I am not assuming it was erroneous, but

you say it was.
MR. LEWITTES;

There was -this evidentiary hearing

I

13
on the basis of the remand where the relator, the respondent
here, did testify, th© two defense counsel testified, th©
district attorney testified, and although technically not mada
part of the rule 52(a), conclusions of law and findings of
fact, the court did note that indeed there was a factual basis
for the plea, but did hold, as mentioned a moment ago, that
the more fact, in essence, that th© element of the crime was
not told to the respondent, the plea was involuntary as a
matter of lav/.
The district court —
QUESTION:

Do you read the district court's opinion,

Lue Court of Appeals8 opinion as reading out any possibility of
harmless error in a situation like this?

I would think where

the defendant had stabbed the victim 40 times, whether he
knew as a matter of law that intent had to be proved or not
might be fairly immaterial since I would think a jury confronted
with chat evidence would virtually inevitably conclude that
there was intent»
1-13. LEWITTES:

I have a feeling they read out the

harmless error here.
QUESTION:

You mean you read this as in effect a

holding that the omission to mention any element means the
guilty plea must be vacated.
MR. LEWITTES:

Yes* that is the way we read this

decision, and that is the evil of this decision, we feel.

14
Wow, tlie decision itself in the district court is
quite odd, it seems to me, particularly when they commence
their discussion of the law, citing Boykin v. Alabama, and
they claim it's not applicable to the instant because Boykin
is not retroactive, and yet they rely upon the McCarthy case
which was held not to b® retroactive in the Halliday decision
in this Court, and yet they base their reliance upon McCarthy v.
United States, which was, of course, decided under the
supervisory powers of this Court,so that it is a strange
decision even on that basis.
QUESTION:

Do you think there is some possibility

that Judge Port may not have been entirely persuaded by the
Court of Appeals?
MR. LEWITTES:
Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

No, I think the opposite was true,
I think that he was very much

influenced by the circuit court.
QUESTION:

He reversed and he decided (Inaudible)

coin® out the other way.
MR. LEWITTES:
QUESTION:

In my judgment that's correct.

Do you have intent to use these in relying

on the McCarthy case?
MR. LEWITTES:

I think if we look at page 8a. of the

appendix to the petition for writ of certiorari **■-■
QUESTION:

That's what I was looking at.

you to give in© your view of it.

I wanted

15
MR.LEWITTES:

It says there that, citing McCarthy,

it cannot be truly voluntary unless the defendant possesses an
understanding of the law in relation to the facts,
QUESTIONS

What does New York State have in the way

of a counterpart of Rule 11 of the Federal —
MR, LEWITTES:
QUESTIONS

We don't,

So what, they were doing was applying

Rule 11 as apparantly a judicially constructed —
MR. LEWITTES:

Very much so.

And I believe that the

fear that Justice Harlan related in the Boykin case in his
dissent that no weapon was -QUESTION:

excuse me.

I take it you would be making the same

-argument if this was a Boykin case?
MR. LEWITTES:
QUESTION:

Yes.

I gather •— I judge the district court

said this is a pre-Boykin case and be judged by pre-Boykin
standards.
MR. LEWITTES:

Yes, I would make this argument even

if it were post-Boykin because I think that wa can't isolate
one single element and fashion a per se rule.
the court decisions in

And I think

Brady and MeMann v. Richardson and

in the Alford case tell us that we have to look at all the
relevant circumstances.
QUESTION:

So you wouldn't say that it's never a

violation of the Boykin rule to put on the record reasonable —

16

and make a reasonable showing on the record that a plea is
intelligent and voluntary to -- you wouldn't say it's never a
violation of that rule to fail to inform him of an element
of a crime.
MR. LEWITTES;
QUESTION;

No.

When is it?

MR. LEWITTES;

I think that it’s a violation of the

Boykin rule when there is no factual basis for the plea in
conjunction with not understanding the nature of the plea,
plus the fact that it must be intelligently and knowingly
made.

So what I am saying in essence is that it must be a

voluntary statement, it must be consentual.
QUESTION;

It must to® consentual, but how about not

knowing an element of the crime that you are pleading guilty
to?
MR. LEWITTES;

I don't think—if we set it, forth

that way, we have a problem, because vs can communicate to a
defendant in essence the element of a crime without formally
using the statutory phrase.
QUESTION;

If after Boykin, or before, I gather you

think would be true — I guess you think the rule's the same
after as before Boykin.
MR. LEWITTES;
QUESTION;

That's correct.

So it doesn't make any difference whether

Boykin is retroactive.

17
MR. LEWITTES:

Mo, it does not, except that I think

many of the cases that have followed Boykin assume — some of
the cases assume

that they are constitutional requirements,

although they flow out of Boykin to McCarthy.
QUESTION;

One difference Boykin made, though, was

the requirement of having it on the record.
MR. LEWITTES:

Yes.

There was no record at all in

the Boykin case.
QUESTION;

Now, suppose you believe after Boykin

or before, suppos® you agree that it's been shown that th©
defendant was actually ignorant of one of the element of th©
crime to which he was pleading guilty.
MR. LEWITTES;

I don't think that in itself would

change my view, because if the motivation behind the plea was,
for example, that he — and there were several reasons why
one pleads guilty, but one may be that he still felt that he
wants a shorter sentence and sentence is a very important
motivation and perhaps the most important motivation--I think
that even if he did not understand -the element, that he
understood that h@ would get a lower sentence and there would be
less penalty imposed, and he pleaded because of that, I do
not believe th® guilty plea would b© infirm.
QUESTION;

What if as the maximum that he could have

gotten under New York law -- Ufa?
MR. LEWITTES;

He could have had a mandatory sentence

18

of life on a murder one conviction at that time.
QUESTI ON:

This was a plea of guilty to second

degree murder.
MR. LEWITTES:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

What was the maximum sentence that could

have been imposed?
MR. LEWITTES:
rainimun was 20 years.
QUESTION:

He received 25 her®.
Twenty-five years to life.

MR. LEWITTES:
QUESTION:

The maximum was life, but the

To life.

Did the State argue in the Court of Appeals

that the error, if any, was harmless beyond a reasonable
doubt?
MR. LEWITTES:
QUESTION:

I do not believe that they did.

But you suggest now, at least I got an

inference, that with 44 stab wounds the intent element is
really not an element in the case, that any trier of fact
could reasonably assume if you stab somebody 44 times, you
intended it.
MR. .LEWITTES:

I believe as well, Mr. Chief Justice,

that that was the assessment of his counsel, that that would
be the problem if ha had to go to trial,that no jury would
believe that there was no intent her®.
QUESTION:

Is the impact of this holding now that

all the State courts in the Second Circuit are bound by Rule 11?

19
MR. LEWXTTESs

It would appear to be.

Yes, it would.

And I am disturbed by that for many reasons, because I think
that Rule 11 goes to soma extent to the tools to be used by a
judge.

These are tools in ascertaining voluntariness.

They

do not necessarily go to voluntariness itself.
But this case, of all cases, we believe, is the
perfect example not to have any per se rule.

This was a case

where the man was very happy to get away with what he did
sentencewise. He entered -the room with a knife, and the multiple
stab wounds.

And to permit a par s© rule here would not only

do substantial harm, as far as criminal administration is
concerned, but I should like to tell the Court, and I am sure
you are well aware, that -there is hardly a guilty plea entered
or has been entered where the legal elements were
told to the defendant.»

necessarily

So I can .imagine the plethora of

Federal writs of habeas corpus that will succeed after this.
QUESTION:

If you prevail, what do we do with this

case?
MR. LEWXTTESs
QUESTION:

I think we —

Do we tell them the standard — you were

right and we read it as you have suggested it should b© read.
We say, no, there is no per se rule, it’s the totality of
circumstances.
MR. LEWXTTESs
QUESTION;

And this is on® of th© circumstances.

Then what'do we do, send it back

and let

20
them apply the rule?
MR. LEWITTESs 1 think you could reverse.
QUESTION:

MR. LEWITTES s

In a case where there was evidentiary

QUESTION:

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr'. Lynch.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH S. LYNCH ON
BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. LYNCH;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas® the

21
Court:

,

days

Sitting in the courtroom on portions of the last two
X have been struck by what seems to me to b€i a

significant difference between this lawsuit and fch© cases I
have heard

and I suppose many of the cases that com® her®.

In those cases the parties are in disagreement about what the
law is.

There is no such disagreement here.

We all recognize

that under our system of justice and probably under any
enlightened system of justice, for a plea of guilt for a crime
to be valid, it must be an intelligent act, it must b© done
by a person who realises the significance and consequences of
that.
Both parties also agree that when the question is
whether a particular plea meets that standard, that the judge
charged with determining that question must look at all of
the circumstances that surround the plea.
QUESTION:

Than you adopt the totality of circumstances

rule?
MR. LYNCH:
QUESTION:
MR. LYNCH:
QUESTION:
MR. LYNCH:

I do, your Honor.
You think *the Second Circuit did?
Yes.
In this casfi?
In this case.

Very definitely, your

Honor, if I may explain.
QUESTION:
in the McCarthy case?

How do you explain relying on Rule 11

2.2

MR. LYNCH:

I don't think that this case stands for

the proposition as counsel has suggested it.
QUESTIONS

The authority is cited- in the opinion,

isn’t it?
MR. LYNCH;
voluntary.

The opinion says that the.plea must be

What I ara saying, your Honor, is this;

As I read

Kercheval and Machibroda, the plea must be voluntary, that in
deciding whether it’s voluntary the court can and must look at
the circumstances surrounding it, and they say that's what,
they did here.
QUESTION;

What would you say are the crucial

elements of the totality of circumstances?

Starting, I suppose,

with the fact that h© had counsel, you would concede that was • - MR. LYNCH;

It would be pertinent, very definitely,

your Honor.
QUESTION;

I think — would you have to inquire

whether this was experienced counsel?
MR. LYNCH;
QUESTION;
MR. LYNCH;

Yes.
Do you think it passes those two tests here?
Yes. I hav© no quarrel with the conduct

of fch@ defense counsel her®.

They did certainly as good, a

job as I could hav© done, and while that may not be a very
adequate standard, it compels ra@ to say that they did a good
job.
I think the other circumstances that are included here

23

and that were before the court and which I say that the court
must have taken into consideration was the age of the accused,
the fact that prior to this particular problem h© had had no
t

serious brushes with the lav? and therefore was not presumably
familiar, as hardened criminals are, familiar with the judicial
process.

And, of course, very importantly, the diminished

intellectual quotient of the accused.
QUESTION :

Mr. Lynch, Judge Port originally found

that it had been a voluntary and intelligent plea, didn’t he?
And then the Second Circuit reversed.
MR. LYNCH:
QUESTION:

That's correct, your Honor.
And at page 10 — that very short opinion

of the Second Circuit, at page 10a of your petition, ”Th@
case is remanded to the district court to conduct an evidentiary
hearing on the issues raised by petitioner, including whether,
at the time of his entry of his guilty plea, he was aware that
intent was an essential element of the crime.”
Now, doesn’t that suggest that the Second Circuit
thought that fact might have been dispositive?
MR. LYNCH:

It certainly suggests that th® Second

Circuit thought it was important, but it does not mean, I
0

believe, that in deciding this case Judge Port looked only at
that issue.

See, I think where th® parties part company, or

where the disagreement arises, is that the petition®? says to
this Court that there was only one factor that decided th®

24
outcome of this case, namely, -the fact that this young man
did not know that intent was an element of the crime.
Let me say, so I don't forget it, parenthetically,
X would agree with you that there is all kinds of intent in
this case.

If this went to a jury, a jury clearly could have

found intent in the number of wounds.
QUESTION :

Let me interrupt you, then go ahead and

answer.
Judge Port originally found it to be voluntary and
advised.

It goes up to the Second Circuit, the Second Circuit

says take it back and consider whether he knew intent was an
essential element of the crime and whether he was advised of
the scop® of the punishment.

It goes back to Judg© Port.

Judge Port says he was advised of the scope of the punishment.
He did not know that intent was an element of the crime, and
Judg© PGrt releases him.
Now, to Judge Port that was dispositive, what the
Second Circuit said about intent.
MR. LYNCH s

1 respectfully disagree, your Honor,

because in Judge Portes original decision, there had been no
evidentiary hearing.

After the Second Circuit decision, there

was ah evidentiary hearing* for the first time the judge saw
this young man.

He heard testimony not only from this young

man but from the other people, and it is this type of thing
■that creates the additional circumstances which I contend h©

25
took into consideration.
QUESTION;
MR. LYNCH;

It doesn't say he did, though,
No, that’s true.

Well, he does not say

that he did except insofar as he says, "I am going to apply
the totality of circumstance rul@.M

When he talks about the

law that h© is going to apply, he says that he is going to use
the very standard that the petitioner says he should us®.
You see, what the petitioner says hero, as I understand his argument on reading his brief, everything h® says
is premised on one simple conclusion, and that conclusion is
that sine© the opinion talks about nothing except intent, of
necessity it must b© only intent that dictated the decision.
Now, I think that is logically wrong and unpersuasive
when the court says,

I am not just going to consider this

on the element of intent, but I am going to look at all the
surrounding circumstances.

I think it is also significant

when those circumstances are as important and as significant
as they are here, and of course I'm thinking about the
intellectual level of this young man particularly.
Really, that premis©, that if it's not cited, it’s
not considered, I suppose has a corollary that says that if
a
you are writing/ decision,you must put in the decision what you
consider to be significant, because if you don’t, it will b©
assumed -that you haven’t considered it.

While I think the

premises ar© logical, I think the corollary is potentially

26
catastrophic, and I would assume makes the writing of opinions
even more chancy than I suppose they are without that
corollary»
QUESTION;

Of course, you can say it’s just the other

side of the coin on guilty pleas„

You are supposed to put on

the record the elements that go into a guilty plea»
MR. LYNCH;

Under the Federal rules as I understand

them, that's correct.
QUESTION;
MR. LYNCH;
QUESTION;

He's under Boykin, too.
Yes.
So may we assume that the judge put of

record the elements that he relied on in overturning the
guilty plea?

He was supposed to.

MR. LYNCH;

Yes, I think you may assume that.

I

would like to have you also assume what I think is a valid
assumption, that whan a judge- says, "X am going to take into
consideration all of th© circumstances,” that is what he does.
Mow, there is no question that he wrote solely in
terms of intent.
QUESTION;
MR. LYNCH;
QUESTION;

Th© first time or the second time?
The second time.
Those ware all of the circumstances, as

far as h® was concerned.
MR. LYNCH;
that, your Honor.

Well, you see, I find difficulty accepting

27
QUESTION;
MR. LYNCH;

I gather that.
Because — well, stop and think a second.

Isn't in any adversary proceeding, isn't on® of th© most
significant things that takas place throughout the proceeding,
isn't it the presence of the witnesses, the appearance, the
impression they create, their integrity, their ability to
honestly call and relate?

That is present in every proceeding,

and it was present here, and it seems to mss that, to say that
this stands for the proposition that th® decision rests only
on the element of intent overlooks the fact that this judge
saw these witnesses, cam® to th© conclusion as to what their
testimony was and to what th© facts were and factored it into
th® decision that he rendered here.
QUESTION;

But that had been twice.

K© did that

twice, and the first time h© came out black and the next time
he cams out white.
MR. LYNCH;

No, if I may disagree, Mr. Chief Justice.

The first time there was no hearing.

All he had. in front of

him on the first occasion were papers.
QUESTION;

On the second

Th© papers probably shaved that this man

stabbed the victim 44 times.
MR. LYNCH:
QUESTION;
is it not?

True.
A pretty important element of intent,

You have already conceded —
MR. LYNCH;

I have conceded on the issue, Mr.

28

Chief Justice, it's vital if it went to a jury for
determination.

There is no question they could have found

intent.
QUESTIONS

Isn't it vital in the appraisal of the

defendant and his lawyer as to how he should plead?
MR. LYNCH;

Yes.

But that is not the issue her©.

As I understand the issue her©, it's not whether he had the
intent, but it's whether h® knew that the State had to prove
that he had the intent.

H® says that he did not — and I

think that is a very different proposition.
QUESTION;

Well, if you concede that without any

doubt, as you apparently have, that the State could make a
case of intent, —
MR. LYNCH;
QUESTION:

No question.
— then — how is the degree of his

understanding of this, a layman8s understanding of this,
assuming a perfectly average intelligent person, not a subnormal,
as he is, what would that have to do with it?
MR. LYNCH:

Doesn't it really go to the very question

we are trying to resolve, whether the pl@a is voluntary and
intelligent?
In other words, how can a person make an intelligent
decision as to what he should do under these circumstances
if ha doesn't know that on® of the problems that the people
face here is that they must prove that h© had intent. .

29
QUESTION;

As a r@alist.ic matter mustn't such a

person, a layman, on that kind of an issue depend almost entirely
on his counsel?
MR. LYNCH;

Yes, but you see her®, your Honor, the

counsel quite candidly admitted -- and I don't denigrate them
for this

one counsel said that h@ had not told the accused

that intent was an ©lenient of this matter, and th€i other
counsel said he thought but ha couldn't b® sure, and the
accused himself testified that he had never bean told.
QUESTION;

Isn't that one of -the things that counsel

would just pretty well writ© off in assessing the defens® of
this kind of a case when you stab 44 times.

You don't

dwell to any great length with your client on how we are going
to disprove the element of intent.
MR. LYNCH;

I agree with that.

I wouldn't dwell on

it, particularly where, as her®, my client had very limited
ability to understand.
not dwell on it.

But that doesn't mean that — I might

I -think X would have to tell it to him.

So there may be some inconsistency in saying that an accused
who was someplace between an idiot and a moron must be told
— I am not saying h© has to be told the element of the crime.
1 think he has to be told the substance of the crime.

And I

think that that wasn't told to him hare, and I think that's
one of the circumstances that, resulted in this decision.
QUESTION;

Yet he was found capable? of standing trial.

30
That, decision was never challenged,
MR. LYNCH;

That9s true, and wo ar@ not saying in

this proceeding that he was not capable of understanding.

In

fact, the irony of this ■—
QUESTION;

Mr. Lynch, did I ask -— you say the

defendant has to be told the substance of the crime.
9

MR. LYNCH ;
QUESTION;

Yes.
Suppose his lawyer tells him that if the

jury finds (a) that you are mentally competent and (b) that
you stabbed this lady 44 times, they will find you guilty.
Wouldn't that be substantially true?
MR. LYNCH;

Ah — I don't think it would ba

technically true, but I think it would be possibly sufficient.
QUESTION;

So as soon as you admit that all they

have to tell him is the substance of the crime, it seems to me
you have confessed error.
MR. LYNCHt

But you s®@, they didn't tell him that,

your Honor.
QUESTION;

Oh, y@s.

The only thing the judge found

was that he wasn’t aware of this concept of intent, which may
mean that he thought, well, I didn’t really mean to kill her.
That would be a defense.
MR. LYNCH;

You see, that’s what I am really saying.

Perhaps my answer to your original question, was ill-conceived.
But, what I am saying here is it’s my understanding of the law

31

that the plea must be an intelligent plea.

Now, that obviously

assumes that the parson making that plea has some knowledge,
I mean, if Mr. Morgan were from another planet and came down
and was charged and had no knowledge of our society or our
rules whatsoever, I take it that we would have to impart some
knowledge to him.
Now, the question turns what kind of knowledge must
you impart for the plea to be an intelligent act?

And what

I suggest is that what you must tell an accused for ,his
*

plea to b@ an intelligent act is the substance, the essential
substance, of the crime with which ha is charged.
Now, I don't wish to get into —
QUESTION:

What is fch© difference between that and

telling him the specific legal elements of the crime?
MR. LYNCHs

Let me explain,

There ar© a number of

cases, as I am sure your Honors ar© aware, where pleas have
been set aside because the accused didn’t understand the
nature of what he was doing.

Now, these have tended to fall,

and may exclusively fall, under the conspiracy area.
Th® courts have said in those matters, because the accused
didn't know what h® was doing, he didn't know in effect what
a conspiracy was, we. ar® not. going to accept his plea, and w@
are going to send it back for repleading.
I take those cases to mean that for an accused to
plead intelligently in accordance with the constitutional

32
requirements of due process, he must know fch© essential
substance of the crime. The essential substance of conspiracy,
I take it, is that two or more people get together to commit
a crime.

The essential —
QUESTION;

But that's a good deal more subtle than

whether 44 stab wounds affords a basis for inference of intent.
MR. LYNCH %

Well, it may b@ more subtle.

in fact,

the petitioner has suggested that the conspiracy cases that
have set aside pleas should be considered »— he doesn't phrase
it this way, but I gather is sort of an aberration in the
system, that those ar© complex cases and therefor© can b©
understood only in that light.

I would prefer to think of

them as, as I think they ar©, not an aberration, but an actual
practical example of the principi® of th® rule which says that
the accused must know.
Now, a conspiracy cass, complex as it raay or may not
be, the plea of such a charge may not necessarily have to b©
ssfc aside because th® accused isn't told.

In fact, as I

?

recall, 1 think it’s the Podell case.
through partly to trial.

There th© case went

Th© accused was an attorney.

H®

pleaded, guilty and then h© moved to set th® plea aside on th®
grounds he didn't ~ not that he didn't understand, but that
he wasn't told th© elements of conspiracy, and -the court had
no problems, they said, well, this is a sophisticated and
intelligent man, h© doesn't need —

33

QUESTION?

By that same analogy, the court might

have reached that conclusion very properly if this young
fellow had been pleading guilty to a conspiracy, given all the
other facts.

But when he is pleading something very much

less subtle than conspiracy,

isn't the explanation to be

tailored to the nature, of the crime?
MR. LYNCH:

I think it's to be tailored to the nature

of the accused, because I think that a sophisticated accused
may need no explanation, certainly the attorney, the example
I just mentioned, requires no explanation.

The unsophisticated,

or the mentally deficient, I think, need a lot more.
If the standard is the complexity of the crime,
doesn't -that necessarily presuppose that you make a list of
the crimes in order of complexity and that seems to me like
an unworkable judicial rule.
QUESTION;

I wonder if your suggestion about the

intelligence of the accused may not cut the other way.

Isn't

it possible that fch© more ignorant the man, the more important
it is that h@ have the advice of counsel on which to rely.
MR. LYNCH;
QUESTION:

I would accept that.
Here you do have two trained counsel who

in effect made fch© decision for him.
MR. LYNCH;
QUESTION;

That's true.
So isn’t it reasonable to assume, then,

they mad© an intelligent decision?

34
MR. LYNCH;

Let ms say quit© candidly that they

made the decision I am sure X would have suggested be made.
There is no issue there.

But the issue really is not whether

they did what was right or wrong,, but whether this was an
intelligent plea.
Now, there are problems both ways.

I mean, here you

have a. young man of very limited intellectual ability, and I
suppose it can be said, with such a person isn't it really
unwise to say you must tell him in great deal what the
substance of the crime -is.

On the other hand, as has been

pointed out, he has been found able to stand trial, he is
able to understand enough apparently to go to trial, and it
seems to me that the due process provisions of our Constitution
say that under those circumstances if his plea is to be an
intelligent on®, it has to be mad® on 'the basis of some
knowledge.

He is not just a chip in a whirlwind of legal

knowledge here, his has to make an intelligent decision of his
own, and he has to ~

QUESTION;
said,

Let's assume that, he asked him. and hti

"Yes.”
MR. LYNCH s

I would not consider that giving him the

35
information that he needed»
QUESTION;

Or intent?

MR. LYNCH;

That8s correct.

QUESTION s

Why not?

MR. LYNCH;

Because when I talk of substance of the

crime, your Honor, I am talking about the element without
which the crime would not be the same.

Now, whan you ar®

talking about murder second, the very thing that distinguishes
it from the lesser degrees of homicide is the intent to cause
the death -QUESTION;

You think, Mr. Lynch, that the lawyers,

tiie two of them, should have said to him,

"Now, look, young

fellow, second degree is th© plea that they are asking you to
make,

And let in© tell you what that’s all about.

It involves

intent, it involves this, it involves that, or it involves
fcfc® other thing.

Now, in this case 44 stab wounds are

enough to establish intent, th® jury can find intent on the
basis of that.

Now there you are.

do you want to plead?

That’s th® whole tiling.

You can get 20 y@ars to life."

Now

Is that

what they should have don®?
MR. LYNCH;

I think that's the least they should hav©

■dons.
QUESTION;

And you don’t suppose in Judge Port’s

initial findings it suggested that’s exactly what they said
to him?

36

MR, LYNCH:

No,

You sse, I would hop© the Court

not go off on the original decision»

Th© original decision

was decided on papers submitted
QUESTION?

I agree, Mr, Lynch, but Judge Port did

in his initial opinion lay out th© things that h© found had
been don© at the plea hearing by everyone concerned, the lawyers,
th© accused, and th© judge.

There are a couple of paragraphs

there.
MR. LYNCH:
QUESTION:
I agree.

Insofar as that was
I know he doesn't use th.© word "intent.''

But he talks about what th© lawyers did.

He lays

down, as 1 read it here, he says, "On the taking of th© plea
th© court made a special effort to emphasize to the defendant
the gravity and importance of this change of plea.

Th© court

asked the defendant whether h© understood that h© was accused
of killing th© victim, that a plea of guilty was the same as
being convicted after a jury trial, and that h© would be
sentenced to prison.

The defendant answered in the affirmative

to each of these questions."
MR. LYNCH:
QUESTION:

That’s correct, your Honor.
And then he asked him in addition if h©

fully understood what h@ was doing, if he was doing this
voluntarily and upon th© advice of counsel.
again

responded in the affirmative.

mother and two brothers ware present

The defendant

Further, defendant's
within the courtroom when

37
h© changed his plea to guilty.
So that’s a recital, at least, of what Judge Port
found on fell© basis of only the papers had occurred at the
taking of ‘the plea.
\

MR. LYNCH:

That’s correct, your Honor.

The reason

that the decision was differant on the second occasion, in ny
judgment, is ironically enough th© presence of the defense
counsel testifying on behalf of the people of the State of
New York.

I think it’s very possible that those counsel had

not been present, and if the court had not had an opportunity
to see the witnesses, it. would have com® to a different resolve.
QUESTION^

You mean, so even if there were some

suggestion in what I have just read you that the issue of intent
had been discussed between counsel, that after hearing th®
lawyers, th© judge concluded, no, ha was wrong.
MR. LYNCHi

I think that after hearing not only the

lawyers, but th© accused himself, the court had a complete
picture of not only what went on, what was in the record
originally, but he could better understand the intellectual
deficiency of the accused and could recognise, as I think ha
did recognize, based upon that deficiency, that the accused
didn’t know that intent was. an element.
You know, it’s very well for us to say that he
should have known, I mean, that intent was so obvious, and it
is obvious here, but -this young man testified at th©

38
evidentiary hearing that he didn't intend to kill this woman.
Now, yon know, ~~
QUESTION %

It. would be quite possible to read that

testimony, though, as confusing intent and premeditation,
wouldn't it?

He testified as he went up the stairs h@ didn't

have the intent to kill her.
MR. LYNCH;

That's a possibility - - that's on©

possible explanation of fch© testimony, your Honor, that's
trues.

I think it's also possibles to interpret that testimony

to mean that he actually believed he didn't intend.
QUESTION;

That h@ didn’t intend not only at the

first stab wound but at the 44th to ~~
MR. LYNCH;

That's what he said.

And whan you are

dealing -- Now, if this were a perfectly rational human
being, normal human being, I would agree that testimony is
incredible as a matter of law.

I am not. sure it is incredible

when you are dealing with a parson of this intellectual level,
or lack of it, really.
I think that the ■—
QUESTION;

Not at the level of one competent to

stand trial is what you ar© saying.
MR. LYNCH;

He was competent, found to b© competent,

and I can say candidly that I was surprised in my discussions
with him at the l^vel of his understanding at that time.
I think that if he had. been told that intent was. an element of

the crime, I am sure h© could have understood it»

He says

he wouldn't have pleaded if he had been so told»
QUESTIONS

I gather you are suggesting to us that

we ought not to male® these decisions on the cold record when

MR. LYNCH:

That's correct, your Honor.
— asked the questions, heard his answers,

and
MR. LYNCH:

That's correct, your Honor.

that this is clearly a question of fact.

I feel

In fact I have

cited the Biarlv cas© with the proposition that the question
of idle voluntariness of a guilty plea is always a question of
fact and that obviously only the judge that sees the witness
and hears the testimony is in a position to make that judgment.
I would ask that you affirm the judgment of the
lower court.

Unless you have any other questions —

If the sentence were reduced to 20 years,

At the very most, this decision stands

for the proposition,if you say he didn't consider another
single thing, at the very most it stands for the proposition
that when a parson is charged with murder in the second degree,
h© must know that intent, is an element of that crime and that
he must not — that that information may not come to him from
the horrendous nature of the crime.

It's got to come to him

by someone who is in a position to tell him this is the element
It’s the only element

that was talked about here.

There are

cases, as the Court realizes, where people, for example, have
been found guilty of postal robbery and they attempt to set —not found guilty, pleaded guilty to postal robbery and they
attempt to set the plea aside on the grounds -that it was not
explained to them that to commit this crime you have to put

in danger.

And there are certain presumptions as to whether a

weapon is dangerous or whether it's not.

The court had no

They said you don't have to know all that,

you don't have to be told all that.
