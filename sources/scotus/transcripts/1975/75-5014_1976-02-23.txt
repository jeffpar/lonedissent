MR. CHIEF JUSTICE

BURGER:

We'll hear arguments

first this morning in 75-5014, Doyle against Ohio and
75-5315, Wood against Ohio.
Mr. Willis.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. WILLIS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. WILLIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Please the Court:
Jefferson Doyle and Richard Wood, the Petitioners
in this case, were convicted and sentenced to serve penal
terms of 20 to 40 years for the sale of majijuana.
This Court granted certiorari to consider, among
other things, the question left unanswered in U.S. versus
Hale.

That is, whether the Constitution prohibits the

prosecution from showing that one who had been advised of
his right of silence and of his right of counsel properly
subjects himself to questions designed to show he
availed himself of such rights.
Also involved here are serious questions as to
whether an

accused can be asked why he failed to disclose

his defense at the preliminary hearing where he appeared
with counsel and whether a defense witness arrested and
charged with the same offense can be asked comparable
questions.

4
These include why they did not consent to a
search of the car.

Then there is the further fact that

these points were vigorously argued to the jury.
The relevant facts are not in serious dispute.
Doyle and Wood were arrested shortly after they
had been seen emerging from a parking lot.
had preceded them.

An informer

He was carrying a ten-pound bag of

marijuana which he indicated had been purchased from the
Petitione rs.
Their defense was that they had been framed.
The facts show that they had driven about the
city, according to their defense, in search pf the person
V

that framed them and they were stopped and arrested by the
local police who were aided by the Sheriff's Department.
The Court of Appeals expressly viewed the
asking of the assailed questions as properly designed to
test credibility.

The related arguments were approved

on the basis of this determination.
In a nutshell, we contend here that to the
extent Raffel may have somehow survived as a viable
concept, this Court's decisions in Johnson, Grnnewald
and Griffin

may have even been invigorated by Harris,

this Court’s decisions in Miranda and Hale cex'tainly, when
viewed in tandem, mandate that Raffel should be expressly
relegated to the archives of antiquity.

5

The State and the Government in its amicus brief
would have this Court declare in spite of the clear and
v

unambiguous thrust of Miranda and Griffin that the failure

)

~

'

of an accused based on his right of silence and to counsel
to reveal the details of his defense during police
interrogation is a factor that bears on credibility.
While it is doubtless true that the Grunewald,
Hale conclusion that mere silence is not inconsistent with
innocence is a valid premise, it is also true that a
request to consult with counsel should not create a
negative force against the believability of an exculpatory
defense, as was the case here.
Raffel, of course, held that it was proper to
show at a subsequent trial that the accused did not
testify at his first trial.

For me, it is most difficult

to square Raffe1 with the Griffin principle that one can
be penalized for not having testified.
The elementary fairness concept expressed in
Johnson makes the fact that the Miranda warnings were given
these Petitioners a most crucial consideration.
The same is true of Grunewald as it is hard to
see how this Court's supervisory powers over the lower
federal courts could possibly be more sensitive to the
rights of an accused to a fair trial than is the
Constitution itself.

6

As counsel reads Hale, absent a duty to speak,
and absent a threshold inconsistency between a failure to
do so and later exculpatory testimony, proof of silence
lacks a significant probative value and should be excluded.
Here, of course, as was the case in Grunewald,
the focus on Doyle and Wood following their arrests, was
so intense that it wa3 natural for them to feel they were
being questioned solely for the purpose of providing
evidence that could be used against them.
Indeed, there is simply no basis in this record,
even for the strained hope by them, that the revelation
of their defense to the police during interrogation could
have possibly resulted in their release.
Raffel, of course, was based on an assumption,
rejected in Grunewald and again in Hale, that silence is
inconsistent with a later exculpatory defense but, as the
Court has recognized •— and I think it is salient here —
that there is simply no proof that an innocent person
would tend to make an exculpatory statement whereas the
guilty person will remain silent.
We contend that there is simply something wrong
with the rule which permits the conversion of one's
permissible use of the Fifth Amendment shield into
evidence of quilt.
This, of course, is the point made in the

7
concurring opinion in GrunewaId, which we contend was
adopted in Griffin and, certainly, impeachment tends to
demonstrate its untruth by implication, which was a point
made in one of the concurring opinions in Miranda.
The interesting aspect of this case, of course,
lies in the fact that in Ohio there were decisions which
had expressly excluded the ability of the prosecutor to
comment on the failure of the person to appear before the
Grand Jury.
The Supreme Court of Ohio had indicated that
this, of course, was improper and that no amount of
instruction could cure this fault on the part of the
state.
There were decisions which indicated it was
impermissible to comment on the fact that one did not
reveal his defense at a preliminary hearing.
Again, the Supreme Court of Ohio has taken the
position that an instruction was insufficient and then there
was the Stevens case out of Ohio which indicated that it
was impermissible to argue to the jury that at the point
of arrest would have been a good time for the defendant
to have revealed his exculpatory defense.
There was a statute in Ohio which was, of course,
applicable at the time this case was tried and that statute
expressly provided that when an accused person appeared

s
at a pre

'.minary htsarinn without counsel he should be

expressly advised that he need not make any statement and
that the failure to make a statement could not be used
against him at the time of trial„
Thus, we have the anomalous situation where one
appears with counsel and he is, of course, penalized
because he did not reveal his defence at the preliminary
hearing.

To put the issue in its proper context, X think

that a slight emphasis should Le given to some of the
questions chat were asked of Mr. Wood and Mr , D- y..r .

with an attorney that it doesn’t make any difference whether
he appears at a post-trial — or whether he appears at a
trial post-indictment; it doesn't make any difference
whether he appears as a witness or that the implications
are exactly the same.
In this case, when Doyle and Wood were stopped,
the officer indicated and it is a fact, he told them that
they had the right to remain silent and they had the right
to consult an attorney.

Both indicated that they wanted

to consult an attorney.
Later, they came to the incarceration area and
indicated to Wood, "You don't have any objections to us
searching your car."
He said, "I want to consult with an attorney
about that"and that was his evidence on the point and
Doyle, of course, gave comparable indication.
'Phan, of course, the 3tate then went to the
problem of getting a search warrant and they located in the
car some money and of course, they were asked at the trial,
"Why didn’t you consent to the search of the car?"

and

"Why was it that you didn't reveal this framed defense to
the police on the night of the arrest," and "Why, v/hen you
appeared at the preliminary hearing, didn't you reveal the
contents of your defense?"

AnA the question about the counsel was brought
to tho fore by questions a3ked of one of the Petitioners.
He said, "Well, why didn’t you relate the essence of your
defense?" and he indicated that, "I wanted to consult with
an attorney."
He said, "Well, you appeared at the preliminary
hearing.

You had an attorney at that time, didn't you?"
And he said, "Ye3."
And, "Well, why didn’t you

tell the judge at

that preliminary hearing that you had been framed?

That

would have been a wonderful time to have revealed to the
judge that you had been framed."
And all of these questions, of course, were
asked over objections and the only instruction given the
court related to the testimony of one who appeared as a
rebuttal witness in the V7ood trial.

He was asked, on

rebuttal, "Did Mr. Wood at any time protest his innocence?
And we again objected and the Court indicated "Did
Mr. Doyle at any tine protest his innocence?"
Doyle, testifying as a witness in the Wood trial
And the Court instructed the jury that that went to
impeach the credibility of Mr. Doyle, who had appeared as
a witness on behalf of Mr. Wood.
QUESTION:

Do you think there is any inconsis­

tency between the Defendants' silence at the time of

arrest and his testimony at trial?
MR. WILLIS:
QUESTION:

Do I see any inconsistency?
Yes.

MR. WILLIS:

Mr. Justice Stevens, I see none.

I

feel that the Constitution, as interpreted by Miranda,
having conferred upon the accused the absolute right to
remain silent, I see no inconsistency between that and
the position taken by this Court in —QUESTION:

Assuming that the Court should

disagree with you on the question of

whether there is

inconsistency or not, would your position then fail?
Does your case turn on the question of whether
or not there is inconsistency, in other words?
MR. WILLIS:
Harris

I would say so, in the light of

versus New York; the position taken by the Court

there, of course, related to inconsistent statements
which were at variance with the later defense and I think,
although I am not in agreement necessarily with Harris, but,
given Harris, I don’t think that this case would turn on
that point because here —
QUESTION:

Do you think, Mr. Willis, there could

ever be a case in which silence would be inconsistent with
trial testimony?
MR. WILLIS:

I would suppose so , using the Third

Circuit's case of U.S. ex rel — the Burt case, whatever

12
it is, there the indication was that the man was arrested
and at some time after a person had been killed and later
he was charqed with the murder and his defense was
accident and he was questioned as to whether or not or
why he had not reported the fact that he had accidentally
injured someone.
I think in that instance at least I could live
with that opinion and then there is the Fifth Circuit
opinion in Ramirez, where the person testified at trial
that he was coerced into selling the contraband.

I think

there I can see how he miqht have been under some duty
to speak and I think that is the point.
Absent a duty to speak, X have problems with it
and I have even greater problems when the man is given
the

liranda warnings, which is to the effect that he has

the right to remain silent and I think that he certainly
can rely on that and there is an old opinion rendered
in the Sixth Circuit.

I think it is probably McCarthy and

it is probably back in the twenties and the point there
was made that if a person could be penalized for exercising
his right of silence, that you ought to change the
warning to read that anything that you say can be used
against you and if you don’t say anything, that can be
used against you, too and I think that makes sense.
It just seems that there is something wrong to

13

tell a man that you have the right to remain silent.

You

have the right to consult with an attorney and he says,
"Very good.

I want to exercise those rights."

And than later he is penalized for having done
so and I just can't reconcile that with the position
taken by Mr. Justice Douglas in Johnson and I cannot take QUESTIO*!:

You would seem to accept that if there

is inconsistency between silence and his later trial
testimony.
MR. WILLIS:

Inconsistency, but I do not

accept the premise that silence is necessarily inconsistent
QUESTION:

At the time of the arrest, the officer

can't really know what the man is going to testify to
i

later.

So, why would he have to give him that warning?
MR. WILLIS:

The Court said he must be warned in

Miranda and £ am relying on that.
QUESTION:
used against you.

This Court —

The warning that your silence may be
You say, your silence may be used

against you if: you testify later in a way inconsistent
with silence.
MR. WILLIS:
QUESTION:

But I am net agreeing —
Just remember that circumstance in

which it would be permissible.
MR. WILLIS:

I admit that some of the decisions

tend to suggest that this is the case.

Again, the

14

Third Circuit opinion in Durt and Ramirez decision out of
the Fifth Circuit tend3 to say that there are some
circumstances in which silence is inconsistent with
innocence and later exculpatory testimony and for that
reason was admissible, that for that reason this Court
ought to articulat® a standard under which all of us can
live and I believe that that is one of the real problems
that confronts defense counsel.
If you recall -- I think it was Mr. Justice
Jackson in Watts versus Indiana indicated that any lawyer
worth his salt will advise his client not to make any
statement under any circumstance and —
QUESTION:

Well, sure, your client is free and

you are free to argue to the jury that no inference should
be drawn or that it is such a debateable inference that he
may as well just have been following his Miranda warnings.
Why convert it into a question of law rather than simply
something that the jury should evaluate one way or the
other?
MR, WILLIS:

Well, I take this position,

Mr. Justice Relinquist, that any defendant who does not
testify goes against the grain and certainly, if you can’t
penalize him for not testifying to a jury in open court,
why should you penalize him because he does not desire to
risk distortion by the police officers as to what he might

15

have said when questioned on the public highway and for
that reason and because the drift, as I apprehend from the
Court's decisions is that he has thi3 right to remain
silent.

Why should he be penalized?
QUESTION:

him?

Well, why do you say you are penalizing

I mean, you let in a lot of statements made by the

defendant to third parties at a trial.

You don't regard

those as penalizing him, do you?
MR. WILLIS:

Well, I don’t say he is being

penalized but I think he probably subjects himself to
testimony that tends to prove him guilty when it is
provided by others but I think the Fifth Amendment says
he doesn't have to provide any testimony himself which is
incriminating and this is at least the thrust of the
position I am trying to defend.
Certainly I don't see how one can conclude that
because a person is told he can remain silent and he
decides to remain silent that he must be guilty and that
this has some evidentiary value insofar as the question of
guilt or innocence is concerned.
QUESTION:
I

You seem to be accepting, as a premise,

Mr. Willis, the idea that the silence is incriminating.
You say that he is not obliged to answer because this
tends to incriminate him.
MR. ’WILLIS:

No, I am not saying that

I am not

necessarily saying that.

If I am, then I am not — what I

am tryinq to say I am not saying vary well.
VJhat I am really tryinq to say is that this
Court indicated in Miranda that the man has the right to
remain silent and he has to be told of this and that he
has a right to counsel and he has to be told of this.
Nov/, it seems to me that there is something
basically unfair to then turn that around and penalize him
by exposing co the jury that he elected to remain silent
when he had an option which would have permitted him to
waive these constitutional rights and reveal to these
police officers, possibly in some secret session or in the
presence of five or six other police officers who may very
well distort what he has to say -- I think he has a right
to reveal his defense in an open court where it can be
fully evaluated.
QUESTION:

Well, do you mean he has a right to

reserve totally any statement about his defense until he
is in open court with his counsel?
MR, WILLIS:
point.

That is it.

That is precisely the

I. feel that he has no duty to speak when interro­

gated by the police officers and I think this Court has
made that point very clear and this is the point that I
think Mr. Justice Douglas made in Johnson when the
particular defendant was told by the court that he could

17
refuse to answer questions based or hi3 Fifth Amendment
rights and then later, the prosecutor was able to argue
that the man had exercised his right of silence.
Certainly, the — it is something fundamentally
wrong to penalize a person for having exercised the right
that is extended to him and this is the point upon which I
place my basic emphasis.
QUESTION:

Mr. Willis, you referred to Justice

Jackson's often-quoted observation that if a lawyer is
called in, any lawyer worth his salt will tell his client
to say nothing whatever.
In the Miranda opinion, Chief Justice Warren,
you will recall, added at .some point in his discussion
of the setting that we are talking

about and he goes on

to say that, "It can be assumed that in such circumstances,
that is, when a lawyer is called in and the client tells
the lawyer he is innocent and can exculpate himself,”

his

statement goes on, "a lawyer would advise his client to
talk freely to police in order to clear himself."
Certainly, there is some inconsistency between
those two observations of the two justices.
MR. WILLIS:
QUESTION:

Yes, and —
Of course, neither of them is a ruling

of law but an observation.
MR. WILLIS:

This is the point I was going to

18

make.

I think that the statement by Mr, Justice Warren,

of course, was dicta

and it certainly — I don’t agree

with that particular statement and I feel that as counsel
for a person who is under accusation that I have the
choice of giving him the advice which I consider to be
consistent with the client’s bast interests.

I think that

that is traditionally the role that defense counsel has
to bear when he assumes the obligation of defending one
accused client.
X see nothing improper in indicating to a person
against whom there is arrayed some suspicious circumstances
that he should exercise his right to reserve, as the
Court has indicated, his right to defend against these
charges in open court, particularly when the likelihood
that if he were to make all sorts of exculpatory statements
is not going to result in his release in any way.
In any event, or avoid the problem of going to
trial and hairing the issue decided by a jury.
QUESTION:

Mr. Willis, do you draw a distinction

between the circumstances that exist at the time of arrest
when the Miranda warnings are given and those that exist
at the preliminary hearings?
MR. WILLIS:

Yes.

In this case I do because at

the preliminary hearing, the man cippeared with counsel.
QUESTION:

Right.

19

MR. WILLIS:

And certainly if he retains counsel,

he ought to follow counsel's advice and at that point we
can assume that counsel had evaluated all the facts and
circumstances and in this particular case he has conducted
a pretrial motion to suppress which had been defeated and
the likelihood was good that the man was going to get
indicted by the grand jury.
Also, we had the state statute which expressly
indicated that if persons had appeared without counsel,
the Court had to advise them that they would not make any
statements and their failure to make any statements could
not be used against them at the time of trial so are we
to say that counsel can't give the same advice to his
client that the Court would be required to give if he
appeared without counsel?
I hope that answers the Court's question.
QUESTION:
MR. WILLIS:
QUESTION:

He took the stand, didn't he?
At the trial, yes.
At the trial and his election not to

testify or to offer any explanation

of his original silence

at the preliminary hearing as a trial tactic — as lawyers
i

would perhaps say —
MR. WILLIS:

Well, I wouldn't necessarily call

it, Mr. Justice, a trial tactic although it probably
results in being just that but the point was that it would

20
have been futile for him to have testified at the pre­
liminary hearings.
Now, the burden there is only a probable cause
to believe that this person v?as implicated in some crime
and it is then up to the grand jury to determine whether
or not he should be indicted so the likelihood of him
forestalling this situation at. that point was too remote
for him even to involve himself in trying to explain his
particular defense at that time.
QUESTION:

In a marijuana case, once you lose

your motion to suppress you are a dead pigeon anyhow,
aren't you?

So far as the gran jury is concerned.

MR. WILLIS:

Oh, so far as the grand jury is

concerned, yes.
I’d like to reserve whatever time I have left.
QUESTION:

Mr. Willis, could I ask you one

question on the facts?
MR. WILLIS:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes.

It was the defense theory at the

trial that the informant had framed the defendant, as I
understand it.
MR. WILLIS:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Was it part of the theory that the

arresting officers were parties to the frame?
MR. WILLIS:

Not precisely, no.

I would say

21

no.

That was not a part of tha defense.
The point was that the particular informant had

already been sentenced to the penitentiary and he had been
brought back and was out on bail pending a habeas corpus
ruling and he sought out these officers in an effort to
try to do something to help himself.
QUESTION:

He admitted as much.

All right, thank you.

MR. WILLIS:

And we were concerned that he was

trying to get these people to go to the penitentiary in
his place.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Collins.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD L. COLLINS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF STATE OF OHIO
MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:
commence?

Mr. Chief Justice —

May I ask you a question before you

1> the State of Ohio so impoverished that it

can't afford to print briefs filed in the United States
Supreme Court?
MR, COLLINS:

I am sorry, your Honor.

I thought

that we had complied with the rule.
QUESTION:

You have complied with the rule but

my question v;as directed to the fact that the great State
of Ohio comes to our Court with a brief that is not printed
whereas most people who do appear here manage to find the
means to print their briefs and it just puzzles me.

22

Mm. COLLINS:

Your Honor, I had expected that

since the Petitioners had come in here with
form of pauper, that we could have replied

in the
in kind if we

had chosen to do so.
QUESTION:

You have a perfect right to do it

under the rules and I understand.
QUESTION:

You didn't take a pauper’s oath,

did you?
[Laughter.]
MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:

Excuse me?

Ohio didn't take a pauper’s oath,

did it?
NR. COLLINS:

No, your Honor.

May it please the Court, my name is Ronald L.
Collins.

I am the prosecuting attorney for Tuscarawas

County, Ohio.

I wish to deal a little bit with the facts

in this case and then I wish to stress five points in
argument for clarification and amplification of the
written briefs which we have provided the Court.
Before we get into those matters, I do have one
thing to indicate to the Court lest the Court place undue

$

emphasis on the matter that was brought to the attention
of the Court by Mr. Willis of the Defendants being
sentenced to 20 to 40 years in Ohio Penitentiary and as
the Court is aware in the case of Downey versus Parini,

23
which has been sent back to the Sixth Circuit and to Ohio
for further determination, Ohio has retroactively changed
its penalties in marijuana cases and this will apply to
these defendants.
As Mr. Willis pointed out to the Court, the
fact3 here are relatively simple.

I think they are

complicated only by the disbelieved testimony of the
Petitioners — or the Defendants below in that they are
very important facts, very important to this particular
case.
X think they are important in the light of
Mr. Willis'

concession here that inconsistency turns this

case and that Raniret is such a case.

We contend it is

but a short 3tep and perhaps even backwards from Ramirez
to oar case.
In the fact3 of our case, on April 28th, 1973,
the informant notified the Multi-County Narcotics Bureau,
which is the local bureau in our country, Tuscarawas County,
Ohio, that he had set up a deal with one of the defendants,
Mr. Jefferson Doyle, to purchase a quantity of marijuana
from him.
The deal was for ten pounds of marijuana, a
grocery-sack full, as it turned out.

The price v/as to be

$175 a pound or $1,750 for the ten pounds.
The Bureau had trouble getting this amount of

money on the short notice that they had.

However, they did

cmther some amount of it, about $1,320 or $1,340 as I
recall and had some part of that money photocopied so that
they had the serial numbers.
The Informant was searched so that they

found no

drugs on him and the surveillance team and, in fact,
several surveillance teams were set up to watch the
Informant as he went to his rendez-vous.

The photocopied

money — or, some of the money was photocopied and all that
was given to him, including the photocopied money and he
set off for his rendez-vous with the Petitioners, the
Defendants below.
The exchange was made.

The Informant gave the

hefeudants his money and the Defendants gave the
Informant the marijuana.
Later, after a search warrant, the money including
that which was photocopied was found in the locked,
rented car o: the Petitioners balled up under the floor mat
on the passenger side of the car.
At trial and the trial testimony of the Defendants
who testified for and in their own behalf at separate trials
and in each other’s behalf as witnesses in the separate
trials, their testimony essentially was that they were
involved in this matter but it was only one of the
Defendants, Mr. Doyle, who wanted to buy marijuana, not to

25
and that, it was the Informant — who, I might point out,
the evidence showed knew he was under surveillance at the
time this rendezvous took place was framing — the Informant
was framing the Defendants, that the mnriiuana was his ten
pounds and not the Defendants, that the money — how did
they explain the money?
Well, apparently it had

been thrown in the

window into the back seat at the time that they turned down
the deal to purchase the nariiuana, according to their
story.
Then it was their testimony that after they left
this rendez-vous they discovered this money in the back
seat and beinrr scared, not knowing what to do, they hid it
under the floor mat.
QUESTION:
these facts

Yes, they did hide it and —
Before you go on, counsel, how do

-elate to the legal and constitutional claims

presented to us?
MR. COLLINS:

Well,

it is going to be the conten­

tion, as I get to it in my argument of the state that in
considering the question of consistency or inconsistency,
with the silence at the time of the arrest, the Court
must consider the nature of the trial testimony and what I
am sotting forth here is the nature of the trial testimony.
QUESTION:

In other words, your claim, is that not

all silence •— that silence may not be used to impeach

26

unrter all circumstances but under some circumstances and
that this is one of the cases where it may be so used,
,»m. COLLINS:

That is correct, dr. Chief Justice.

The Petitioners also went on to testify in their
part of their case that they were chasiricf this informant
after they found the money to find out what was going on,
maybe some ten or fifteen, twenty minutes and that after
they had driven around some several blocks they wanted to
find out what was going on end my question is, were they
porb.m? wantin': to know what had happened to the other
$400 that they had wanted since they had indicated in their
testimony that they did count the money.
At this point, they were picked un and they did
not talk to she lav? enforconen:: officers who did pick then
up,

dan had found out about this through the Informant

going through the Sheriff* 9 Department and later a radio
communication celling them

telling the other officers

what had happened.
At trial, the prosecutor cross-examined on the
.silence of the DePendants at the time of their arrest.
That is clear.
Mow, in argument, I would like to stress five
poin ts.
First, it has been mentioned what is being
penalized by the prosecutor's cross-examination,

I want to

27
deal with exactly what is being penalized.
Second, how the silence of the Defendants at tae
time of the arrest became meaningful conduct, not just
silence.
Third, I

would like to deal with the purpose of

the Prosecutor's questions.
Fourth, the inapplicability of Miranda and fifth,
some due process considerations.
QUESTION:
preliminary

Are you going to talk about the

learing, too?

MR. COLLINS:
O'OM'hi'ION:

I will if you have a question, sir.

Well, do you think it is important?

MR. COLLINS:

I think not, because I think that

the preliminary hearing goes a loner with the same kind of
point: that wo contend obtained at trial;
the prorecut .O'

Ln other words, that

could male no use of the silence of the

Defendants ii their case in chief and this certainly
couldn't he brought up In. the only side of the case
presort.eh at the preliminary hearing, the state’s case and
t...crefers. cV- :o was no occasion, since the Defendant did
not t&ke the stand at the preliminary hearing, there was no
occasion for this issue to come up.
?hi warning that the Court gave is very similar
to the warning which police officers give
QUESTION:

as the Miranda --

Let me put the question this way.

Do

28

you think there is the sane decree of inconsistency between
failina to take the stand at a preliminary hearing on
advice of counsel and the failure to make a volunteered
statement at the time of arrest?
MR. COLLINS:
particular

Yes.

In the particular — given the

facts —

QUESTION:

Do you think they are equally

inconsistent with the trial testimony?
MR, COLLINSs
QUESTION:

This particular trial testimony.

Well, is it true that the prosecutor

argued to the -jury that he didn't talk at the preliminary
hearinc?
MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:

Absolutely,

I thought you said it wasn't in the

case.
MR. COLLINS:

I said that it is not in the case

that they took the stand.
QUESTION:

It is net .in your part of the case.

MR. COLLINS:

It is not in the preliminary

hearing, Mr. Justice Marshall.
QUESTION:

But the prosecutor did argue that the

failure to testify at the preliminary hearings was
evidence to be considered against the Petitioners.
MR, COLLINS:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

What if the government had used his

29

silence» cn its nide of the case?
MR. COLLINS:
I

Well, that absolutely would have

been error.
QUESTION:

Under what?

i

MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:

Well —

Under Griffin?

MR. COLLINS:

No, I don’t think Griffin applies

to this type of case,
QUESTION:

Why not?

!1R. COLLINS:
have some application.

If the Defendant was silent.

Yes, in that case Griffin would
I think what makes Griffin have more

application in our particular case is the fact that the
Defendants took the stand.
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but suppose the

Government jut somebody or; the stand and said, well, he
didn’t tr-ke the stand end. explain anything at his preliminary
hearing -- or at any other time did he say — on their 3xde
of tire case,
MR, COLLINS:
QUESTION:

You think that is error.

MR. COLLINS:

!)

QUESTION:
does that oi

I think that’s —

Yes.

Well, let’s suppose the government

their direct side of the case and then the

Defendant takes the stand and they impeach him, or they
ask him the same questions about his preliminary hearing.

30
Did you — were you silent at the preliminary hearings?
And did you ever explain this?

And he says no.

And you say that is permissible but using it on
their side or the case is not.
MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:

And you are

MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:
the silence

That is correct.

I think Miranda compels that.

And you are suggesting that.

Well, is

Just for impeachment purposes?

MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Not as substantive evidence.

MR. SOLLINS:

Absolutely, not as evidence of

guilt but evidence for impeaching purposes that his story,
that these s ;ories that they are telling are exculpatory
stories, are later fabrications.
The

-irst point in the argument that I

would like

to make is about penalizing and Mr. Willis and the
Peti -.ioners would contend that the state by their questions
on cross-examination, that the state was penalizing the
Defendants for their exercising of their constitutional
privilege,
We contend that if there is any penalty at all,
that it was not a penalty for the exercise of the
constitutional privilege.
The penalty was for the taking the stand and

31
giving this fabrication, this fabricated, exculpatory story.
If they had not taken the stand, the prosecution
ft

couldn’t have said a thing about their silence or their
silence at the tire of arrest.
QUESTION:

Well, don't we have to change the

Miranda rulings to bide by

what you sav, which is that

you are hereby warned that if you make any statements, it
would be used against you if you take the stand?
MR. COLLINS:

No, I don’t think that needs to be

done.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't that what you are

arguing?

)

MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:

what I am arguing is that --

Aren't you arguing, once he takes the

stand, the Miranda ruling means nothing?
Un. COLLINS:

I am arguing that when the trial

testimony turns out to be inconsistent with silence, that
the Miranda warning means nothing.
QUESTION:

So once he takes the stand and

testifies, thee is inconsistent, isn’t it, with silence?
MR. COLLINS:

!>

QUESTION:

No, not —

Talking is .inconsistent, with silence,

isn't it?
MR. COLLINS:
silence.

Yes, talking is inconsistent with

32
QUESTION:

Well, so don't you have to tell him,

whatever you tell us, we'll use against you it you take the
stand’
MR. COLLINS:

No, I think the trial court has

got to view it as a factual matter, listen to the testimony
of the Defendant, which exculpates them, and determine
whether the nature of that testimony is such aa it would
call for something other than silence.
QUESTION:

Well, can you imagine any testimony,

exculpatory testimony of the defendant that wouldn’t justify
you in using the Miranda business?
MR. COLLINS;

Yes, I would point out the Ilale

case.
QUESTION:

Well, the Hale case was the supervisor,

I think.
MR. COLLINS:

I understand that, but I am

talking about the fact pattern in the Hale case, where —
and I think it is a close case, but the factors that were
brought out in that trial —
QUESTION:

Would you be satisfied if we applied

Hale to the State of Ohio?
MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:

Yes.

You would be?

MR. COLLINS:

Yes.

As a matter of fact, I think

I argue that in the written brief.

33

QUESTION:

Well, Hale was just an evidentiary

opinion and "just the fact of saying this testimony was
inconsistent, right?
MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:

Well, Hale —

So if it were applied to the state,

what would you say the

constitutional basis would be for

applying it to the state?

Due process — that silence just

isn't any evidence.
MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:

Well, I am not saying that —

It certainly wouldn't be a Fifth

Amendment matter, would it?
MR. COLLINS:

No, I chink it would have to be

due process and I think due process considerations would
come down on our side.
QUESTION:

I don't think —

Well, it doesn’t sound like you are

satisfied with Hale as applied to this case.
MR, COLLINS:

Well, I view Hale as not reaching

the constitutional question at all and either constitutional
question on due process or Fifth Amendment and I don't think
this is a Fifth Amendment case.
Fifth Amendment case.
process

I don't think Hale was a

If it was anything, it was a due

case and that is the same thing that I think this

is.
The point is a related point and that is that in
licrht of the trial testimony of the Defendants, their

silence at the time of their arrest became conduct because
here they are with this marked money, this photocopied
money in their car.

They have all these things that they

have testified to and which are set out in detail and I
don't want to dwell on the facts of them, which made them -*

this conduct made them voiceless in the presence of the
realities that they were facing.
A ;hird point is -- related to this as well, that
the arosecutor asked about — and this has been a question
before, asked about the defendant's silence, not to show
cruilk, but to show that they were lying on the witness
stand.
I think the fourth point I would like to stress
here is that in my view, Miranda has no proper application
to either Hale or to this case.

The warnings in Ilale and

in this case were given, were needed.

The Defendants said

nothing.
I contend tlvt there is a different line of
cases here entirely separate

from ‘liranda — Raffol versus

United Staten, 'fun or aid versus United States, Harris versus
Her' York and the United States versus Hale.
As a matter of fact, throughout the Appellate
arounent of this case, this state has relied on the language
in Harris and I think the prosecution does have a right to
rely on the language in Harris

some of which shows that

35
Miranda does not apply.
The Court, at page 224

in Harris had said, "Some

coiaments in the Miranda opinion can, indeed, be read as
indicating a bar to use of a counsel’s statement for any
purpose.” A, discussion of that issue was not at all
necessary to the Court’s holding and cannot be regarded as
controlling.
Miranda barred the prosecution from making its
case with statements of an accused, made while in custody

Due process and the Constitution, in my opinion,
amount to fairness and I don't think that there is anything
fair about presenting a lop-sided version to the jury.

think that the Defendant in this case, Petitioners, should

directly to the is.sue of whether there was a fabrication
or not — was there a recent fabrication after the

trial twice — two separate trials.
I think the iury had a right to weigh the
credibility of the Defendants and I think that the proper —
the prosecution had properly used this silence, given the
facts and the nature of the Defendants’ testimony, as
impeachment, as showing that this was a recent fabrication,
that the>y did not have a story at the time they were
arrested and now all of a sudden, at trial, they do have
a story.
There should be a full and not just a selective
development of the recent fabrication and credibility issues.
Thank you.

37
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. WILLIS, ESQ.
QUESTION:
you, Mr, Willis.

Lot mo put a hypothetical question to

I am not sure whether you conceded, in

answer to Mr. Justice Stevens, that in some circumstances
silence might have a probative, value.

But take this

hypothetical case, a setting the sane as you have here
except that the charge is inflicting serious injury while
driving an automobile under the influence of liquor, three
men in the car and at a point after insignificant pre~
liminaries, the policeman turns to the driver who has
furnished his driver’s

license and shown that he is the

owner of the car and says, "You are now under arrest for
driving while under the influence of liquor and it is my
duty to warn you," and then he goes on with the usual
warning.
And the owner of the car makes no response.
at a preliminary hearing, he appears with a lawyer.

Then,
Makes

no statement, ro preliminary response at all and then at
the trial, his defense is, he wasn’t driving the car at all,
he was sleeping the back seat and the other two passengers
were

the other two men were in the front seat and one of

them was driving.
Would you say that the silence in these two first
circumstances or in either of them is inconsistent 'with
innocence or that it has probative value?

30
MR. COLLINS:

I would sav that it is not

inconsistent with innocence and I would like to correct
any impression that I may have given.

I did not concede

l)

that there wore «any circumstances in which silence could
he inconsistent with innocence.
I indicated that there were some cases, Burt
versus New Jersey and Ramirez., where the Court took the
position that in those circumstances, it was inconsistent
with innocence.
I jaid I could see how the Court came to that
conclusion although I don't agree with it but I am
indicating that this case does not fall in that ilk.
)

This

is a different case in its entirety.
My position is that silence can never, following
the warnings — that that eliminates any duties or impulse
that the accused might otherwise have to explain
incriminating circumstances and that he has a right to
rely on the warnings given to him by Miranda and that
would apply across the board in all cases.
That is the position I have attempted to assert
here.
Certainly, if these Defendants had the right to
remain silent, then the police did riot have the right to
create the evidence out of their exercise of the right to
remain

silent.

39
I feel that this Court's decison in Halo ought to
be applied full-strength to the facts and the factual
pattern involved hare.
Certainly we have to concern ourselves about
them asking these Petitioners about consenting to a search
of the car.

I feel that they don't have to consent to the

search of the car .

They asked Mr. Wood about thi3.

was the lessor of the car.

He

He indicated, "I want to

discuss that with my attorney."
Nov;, how can you then torture that legitimately
in the light of Grunewald and all these other cases into
some evidence that can be used against these particular
Petitioners?
I feel that the Court ought to follow the
suggestion made by Mr. Justice Black in his concurring
opinion in Grunewald and ought to eliminate Raffel from
the books of this Court as a viable opinion.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
