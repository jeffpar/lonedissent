MRe CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We811 hear arguments next

in 74-1471, TSC Industries against Northway.
Mr. Morency, you may proceed whenever you're ready„
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH N. MORENCY, JR0 , ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MORENCY;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
I shall not try to maintain the level of interest, or
even to make comparisons with respect to the very challenging
patent case the Court has just heard.

Although I’ll admit

my colleagues and I have thought of several ways in which it
might be done.
[Laughter,3
MR. MORENCY;

I would also state that

I have mad®

arrangements with the Marshal to reserve approximately ten
minutes for rebuttal.
This case began in 1969, on December 4th, in the
afternoon preceding the December 5, 1969 stockholders'
meetings of TSC Industries, Inc., and National Industries, Inc.
That was a swap of the assets of TSC for securities
of National Industries, which were passed through to the
holders of the TSC stock.
The issue now before this Court is whether, on the
summary judgment record, and under the limitations of Rule 56

4
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Seventh Circuit
could properly find that 'the omission of four actual matters
from the 80-page proxy statement was so serious, so important
as to make -the entire proxy statement violative of Rule
14a-9 o

14a-9 is a rule promulgated by the SEC which prohibits

the making of a misleading or false statement of a material,
fact, and authorizes —QUESTION:

Mr, Reich

[sic], it does seam to me 'chat

there may be on© common element, though perhaps you may not see
it that way, between the prior case and yours, and that is an
inquiry, perhaps, as to what’s a question of fact and what's a
question of law»
Is there any generally accepted standard in the
«Courts of Appeals or in this Court as to whether a question of
materiality, such as the Court of Appeals and the district
court passed on hers, is generally a question of law or a
question of fact?
MR, MQRENCY:

Mr, Justice, I think that is rather

well understood, and I think a question of materiality is a
question of fact.
It may become a question of law when the court finds
that, all reasonable men would agree on whether a matter is so
important or not,

And this is the basis on which the Seventh

Circuit decided these various questions on 'die summary judgment
record

5
QUESTIONs

Judge McLaren*s holding was , in effect,

that it was reasonably debatable, so he denied summary judgment»
MRo MORENCY:

That is true»

Judge McLaren found that

certain important facts were missing as to some matters„

He

found -that key facts were hopelessly in dispute as to other
\

matters» And therefore he concluded that the requisite
summary judgment finding could not b® made; that is, that there
were no material disputed issues of fact»

Ha could not make

i

such a finding, and therefore he concluded he could not give
plaintiff its partial summary judgment on the issue of
liabilitye
Plaintiff sought that partial summary judgment on
the issue of liability solely on the basis of Rule 14 — or,
rather, Section

14 of the 1934 Act, and the SEC proxy rules

promulgated thereunder.
Now, you are right, Mr„ Justice, I did not think of
that connection* But primarily I think because various Courts of
Appeals, who have considered -the issue, have so decided itD
We cite a number of cases to that effect, one of which is the
Joh n_s_ llopki.ns case, another of which is Rogen v„

I Ilk on»

When this case was filed, the complaint charged that
this was a steal, that National Industries, in collusion with
TSC directors dominated by National Industries, it was said,
had conspired together to sell off this valuable business of
TSC at a grossly inadequate price0

6
However, there was no motion for a temporary restrain»
ing order in this case, filed the day before the shareholders'
meetings .
After two and a half years of discovery, apparently
no fraud could be found and established, and the plaintiff, a
private holding company, called Northway, Inc., filed a motion
for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability only,
predicated entirely on omissions from the proxy statement,
with the single exception no longer material here, and charged
that under the proxy rules the proxy statement was rendered
fatally defective because of these omissions.
The Court of Appeals found, and so did the district
court, that all of the required disclosures had bean made.
So the case was considered below on the question whether the
omissions were of such magnitude and such seriousness as to
render the proxy statement disclosures actually made of the
required matters false

or misleading.

Once again reference

to Rule 14a-9.
These alleged omissions, serious omissions, really
fell into two areas.
One area related to the alleged control, which
plaintiff said National had over TSC and its influence over
TSC in 1969.
The other related to an alleged manipulation of
prices of the common stock of National Industries, which, by

7
the way, was not involved in the transaction at all*

The

National securities that were given to 'the TSC holders were the
National Series B Preferred Stock and National Warrants*
Now, the Seventh Circuit, in deciding the case,
followed almost religiously the position
brief filed with it*

o£ an SEC amicus

They followed religiously on the

omissions * They did not follow the plaintiffs claim that
there was a failure to properly report control or a change
in control, but 'they did say that four omissions were serious*
The Circuit, so found, but in so finding I think the
Circuit discovered that it had to redefine materiality and
depart from the teaching of this Court in Mills and the holdings
of other Circuits, such as the Second and Fifth? and they went
ahead and defined materiality by reference to relevancy of a
factual matter, saying that it was sufficient as required
disclosure even if it was relevant only for some stockholders.
Now, it is our position, and we believe that the
legislative history and the deciding cases support the position,
that Rule 14a**9, which is the catchall, is violated only when
the omitted fact itself is material, and its omission makes the
disclosures in the proxy statement itself false or misleading
in a material respect.,,
There are certain key facts which we refer to in our
Reply brief, and which we believe put this case in a context
which makes it much easier to analyze*

8
Admittedly , an 80-page proxy statement is not an
easy document to digest or to analyse,,
full text in the Appendix,

It is reproduced in

We have twenty copies which do not

meet the Court's printing rule, but which were printed for the
shareholders in '69, which we're perfectly willing to deposit
with the Clerk in the interest of avoiding eyestrain for the
Justices and their clerks.
But let's go back to the transaction, and see what
actually happened.
Unlike the finding in the Seventh Circuit, and contra
the position of the Respondent here, this transaction was
actually determined and defined by Blanche Noyes,
Noyes was an old TSC director.
by several years.

Blanches

His history was TSC antedated

The first interest that National Industries

ever had in it, in February of '69,

He is a partner in a

prestigious investment banking firm, and was an investment
banker and is an investment banker of ability, himself,
Both he and his wife are stockholdres in TSC,
It was his firm and he who analysed the proposed
transaction, as outlined by National Industries in its
proposal, and said it wasn't good enough»

Ha made a counter­

proposal, which National Industries accepted without further
discussion.

And it was his counterproposal which became the

exchange ratio in the transaction.
It was his firm that handled 195,000-shara public

9
offering in the spring of 1969, and it was his firm in the
fall of that year that handled the review of the transaction
at the request of TSC and for the benefit of TSC directors
and shareholders„
Now, how "was the transaction adopted, by this board?
✓

Once again we find that total absence of influence
by National Industries,
board.

National had five directors on this

None of those directors voted on the October 16th

meeting? the three who were present abstained.
The transaction was — and the resolutions in respect,
of it were adopted by a vote of four independent disinterested
directors, none of whom had any connection with National.
Here I refer to Mr. Noyes, Mr, Schaefer, who was the
chief executive officer of the company,in fact although not in
title, and Directors DePorst and Sharfman.
Now, where is the context in which these so-called
omissions must be viewed?

These ones that were so serious that,

they shouldn’t, allow the transaction to be upset.
First of all, it's clear that National Industries was
not in control of -die TSC in the fall of 1969.

The district

court said that National's alleged control was not established.
The Court of Appeals agreed.

Therefore, on this summary

judgment record, U3 ray it is clearcut that National is not
in control of TSCD
Secondly, th® terns of-exchange were determined not

10
by National but by Blancles Noyes, the investment banker„ and
TSC Director,,
Thirdly, the transaction itself, as far as TSC is
concerned, is initiated as a result of resolutions adopted
after the report of Mr, Noyes is received, both in writing and
orally, by his fellow Directors at TSC,
With all of the National nominees abstaining.
Now, what's in the proxy statement?
Well, at. Appendix 267, you will find it is promin­
ently and plainly disclosed that National owned 34 percent of
the TSC stock, 'that five of the ten Directors were National’s
nominees,

Who these five persons were and what their jobs

were at National Industries is also prominently and plainly
disclosed.
The two of the — two of ‘the omissions which the
court below said as a matter of law on the summary judgment
record were so serious that, reasonable men would not differ
on iii&iz importance, were related to the titles of Stanley
Yarmuth and Charles Simon©Hi,
Yarmuth was the president and chief executive
officer of National Industries, and Simonalli was the director
and executive vice president of National,

They became

directors of TSC,
When first elected, there were four National
directors out of a total board of ten.

And Yarmuth becam© the

11
Chairman of the Board and SimoneHi became the Chairman of the
Executive! Committee at TSC»
Yarmuth's position as Chairman of the Board* per
•the By-laws* made him chief executive officer»

On the record

here* it is plain that he never f’auctioned as such»

His

affidavit and the testimony make it perfectly clear that he
didn't even know he v*ss "the chief executive officer.” until
after the lawsuit was filed .and discovery had begun»
As to Simonelli* the record is perfectly clear that
this transaction was on© in which the executive committes of
this board had no power whatever»

So his title as Chairman

e.-, the Executive Committee* on which he and Yarmuth served*
along with a majority of three old TSC Directors* could not be
very important to anyone»
h&'t that is tee kind of thing which * at the urging

o.c rue SEC’s lawyers* the Seventh Circuit, said* in disagreement
with tee district judge who analyzed this record carefully*
saxd was so serious* so material* sd important* teat the
proxy statement thereby violated the basic proxy rule as to
emitted matarial»
Now, wo 'chink that the Seventh Circuit arrived at
ite misconstruction of 14a-9 fundamentally in three steps»
First of all* he said* correctly we submit* that tee
alleged control of TSC by National was not established on
the summary judgment record.

Point 1.

12
Then they said that; certain facts are persuasive
indicators — and the phrase is theirs — persuasive indicators
of control.

Then they concluded that the proxy statement

should ha%r@ disclosed those suggestive facts which indicated
a "substantial likelihood of control".
In brief, we suggest to the Court that what they
did was to confuse suggestive facts, soft information, with
the kind of hard information which the legislative history
and the SEC*3 own rules tell us is to be sought, printed, and
understood in a proxy statement.
Proxy statements are supposed to tell the facts the
way they are.
ascertainable.

Pacts which are known. Facts which are
Hot matter which is suggestive of a fact,

when the ultimate, fact, control, has already, been .postulated by
the court as being not established on the summary judgment
record.
This, la the kind and quality of nitpicking, frankly,
that —QUESTION:

Mr» Morancy, you referred a couple of

minutes to the summary judgment record.

Is it. -*» all you have

to maintain, I suppose, is that your opponents were not entitled
to have summary judgment granted.

Do you go further and

contend that on 'the summary judgment record you would have been
entitled to summary judgment, or that it was

a fact question

t at;, should have bssn resolved by the trier of facts?

13
MR, MQRENCYs

Mr0 Justice, we did not make a cross-

motion. The reason we did not is evidence from Judge McLaren*s
order and memorandum opinion.

There are , frankly, some

undisposed, undecided, unresolved important factual questions
in this record today.
There are questions on which* despite the fact that
counsel for both sides

her© in full battle array* nobody

can answer with accuracy and completeness,
So we do not feel we*re entitled to summary judgment,
and we certainly submit they wars not.
But the Court of Appeals held they were* in disagree­
ment with Judge McLaren,
And the reason that we think the Court of Appeals
made .tills, confusing sot of holdings lias in the fact that thijy
gave the SEC amicus brief a whole lot more credit than it was
due.

It was prepared by the Commission's lawyers* who know

the least of all about the review of proxy statements,
QUESTION;

Wall* the Court of Appeals didn't

accept the test that the Commission proposed* did it?
MR, MORENCY:

Well, the Commission didn't really

propose a test in its amicus brief below.
QUESTION;

Oh, it didn't. But it does here.

MR, MORENCYs
QUESTION:

Oh, it does here, and, as I read it, —
It poses a significant propensity test,

which the Court of Appeals rejected.

Is that right?

14
MR. 140KENCY;

That's true.

Well, Mr. Justice

White, if you can tell exactly what it is that the SEC brief
in this Court says this test should be, you will have
succeeded where all of my colleagues have tried and failed.
Because we can't make sense out of it.
QUESTION:

Well, I had thought that they suggested

the significant propensity test.
MRo MGREKCY; They do suggest significant propensity,
and they changed the wording of Justice Harlan in the famous
Mills opinion just a little bit.,
QUESTION: But at least they do not — they do not
embrace the "might have” test that this Court Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit used»

MR.. M0.RENCY:

No, Mr. Justice, and they do not

embrace the relevancy idea that the Seventh Circuit espoused
and said relevancy ~~
QUESTION:

Well, assume that we agreed with

whatever it. is the SEC proposes, assume we agreed with it. and
that it is different from what the Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit uses, what would we do?
MR. MORENGY?

I think you ought to ~~

QUESTION: Would we — we would vacate and remand,
to use the right test, I suppose?
MR. MQKENCY:

I think what the Court would probably

do would be to use these four ©missions as examples of things

15
which are not material as a matter of law on a summary judgment
record, announce a correct test, and remand so that the district
court could go ahead with the trial.
QUESTION:

Yes, but the Commission says that under

any test, including its test, the judgment should be affirmed,,

MR. MORENCY3

Yes.

And the Commission speaks with

a forked —
QUESTION:

As a matter of law.

MR. MORENCY:

The

Commission, as w® point out in

our Reply Brief, speaks with a forked tongue.

They speak to

us in October of 1975 and they tell us, in their comprehensive
rslet.se on .materiality,, which we cite and quote at some length,
what their rules are and what they follow? and yet their
lawyers. file brinfs in this Court where they don’t even mention
that release.
QUESTION:

Why dc we need to reach the first

suggestion they make?

Why ---- if we were to decide to remand,

why wouldn’t it bsuenotxgh simply to clarify what is the proper
basis of the evaluation?

I carefully avoid the use of the word

"test" here.
MR. MORENCY:

Mr. Chief Justice, I think the confusion

that you have in the Seventh Circuit and the confusion evident
from the amicus brief of the SEC hers is a good enough reason
to show you that you’re going to have to use very strong language
ia formulating your test of materiality, or your materiality

16
standard, end state it in such terms that Commission lawyers,
plaintiff's lawyers, we, will all understand you0

Merely

reversing and remanding on the ground that they didn't say it
right when they said relevancy for some is enough, will not
do the tricko

I think, frankly, some judicial leadership is

called for here, and we are hopeful this Court will provide
it.
We know it's needed.

It's never been decided.

1 would like to reserve the balance of my time, if
I may.

position to evaluate what is the first thing that will corns to

MR, REESE:

Yes- Mr, Justice Rehnquist, we certainly

agree# and we believe that h© should be afforded the oppor­
tunity to make -the decision# to make the judgments about
whether this is a good deal.

The underlying statutory policy#

as explained by this Court unanimously in Mills # is not to
substitute a judicial appraisal of the merger’s merits for
the shareholder’s actual informed vote,

I think it’s perhaps

not too much to say that the shareholder has the right to be
wrong to turn down a bad deal,
QUESTION: But if that's so# wouldn’t the materiality
normally be a question of fact for the finder of fact#
rather than a ques tion of law?
MR. REESE;

Well, why shouldn't the same principles obtain heirs?
MR. REESE;

Perhaps, Hr. Justice Eshnquist, I car.

tions in this field of behavior are the — is the normal

The —» c@rta.in kinds of questions of

fraud, common”lav/ deceit, are ordinarily submitted to juries0
When we impose a higher standard, an equitable standard imposed
upon a fiduciary, requiring disclosure of all material
information and ail conflicts of interest, the question is
decided by the judge under traditional equitable principles0
The point, I think, Your Honor, is perhaps demonstrated
most clearly by precedent* Whether a fact is material is, in
significant part, a question of law? if, indeed, summary
judgment could never be granted on the question of materiality,
then this Court's unanimous decision in Mills would not have
been handed down.

There the Court did indeed direct the entry

of summary judgment on the question of nondisclosure in a

Well, I'm not: sure that was my question

20
MR® REESE: Well, what 1 hoped to lead into was the
question of the Seventh Circuit's decision in this case, and
its relationship with, for example, the Gerstie opinion which
used a somewhat different phrasing»
In the first place, if I may, before addressing that
particular question, I would note that there are in the record
her® and in the briefs offered a variety of tests or standards
or measures or evaluation of materiality»

The government in

/

this situation has not, 1 think,

and this is in partial

response to a question of Mr. Justice White — has not adopted
the test that was rejected by the Seventh Circuit.
Thera is a critical difference.

The government is

speaking of a significant propensity to affect the judgment of
a reasonable shareholder.
The test, the significant propensity test, which the
Seventh Circuit was rejecting was a significant propensity to
change the outcome of the vote.
What the

I think that -the Court of Appeals opinion

must bo read in the light of that Court's experience with these
questions and the arguments which were presented, which the
Court was addressing in the terms in which those arguments were
made«

Do you think Justice Harlan's language

MRo REESE;

Their — in cases where there is an

issue of what occurred, an issue of fact in the historical
sense, perhaps that formulation would be an appropriate
instruction to be submitted to ‘the jury, along with the
determination of what occurred.
But I think it serves both as a guide to lower
courts and, in appropriate cases where there are fact issues,
for instructions to a jury.
If the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit had
been reversed in Mills, Judge Swygert was a member of that
panel, the reason for reversal was that panel's holding that
liability was not established without a factual determination
of the probability thnt " truthful proxy statement would have
produced a different result.
QUESTION;
MR. REESE;
QUESTION:

Catting back to Mills for a moment, —
Yes, sir.
•-» Mr. Hqo3 3, I sent for it, and I notice

that, at least es I read Footnote 4 on page 381 of Justice
Earl Jin* s opinion, he say.-:> that the respondents asked th® Court
to review the conclusion of the lower courts that a proxy
statement was misleading in a material effect, but this
Court refused to pass on it because it wasn't raised by the
petition.
Is that consistent with your answer that — earlier
that the Court must have decided that the statement was

22
material as a matter of law?
MRo REESE;

Yesf 1 think it is, Mre Justice

Rehnquist, on this ground;

There is a difference between this

Court's scouring the record to determine whether the facts
omitted from the proxy statement and found to be established
without genuine controversy in the lower courts, whether -those
facts were properly found and existed without genuine contro­
versy.
This Court declined to consider that question. But
'this Court did directly address the question of what is the
test; what is the standard.; that was an essential step in the
t

Court's concluding that the Seventh Circuit erred in denying
summary judgment, and in this Court's remanding -the case with
the direction that summary judgment must be entered.
The Court was laying down, if you will, a formula,
saying these are the elements that must he established to
impose liability in a proxy case.

One of those elements is

the omission of facts which are material, in the sans© that
they might have been considered important td a reasonable
shareholder.

this is the top of page 14 ~~ to show that the fact omitted,
because of its obvious significance, almost certainly would
have turned the shareholders* vote th© other way.
That’s almost precisely what ‘the Seventh Circuit

said in —
QUESTION;

Now,, here's what the Court of Appeals —

here’s what the Securities and Exchange Commission says hares
To the contrary it believes -- I guess the Commission believes
— that Mi11s announced the following criterion for determining
when facts submitted for a proxy statement are materials
Whether the admitted facts have an significant propensity to
affect the judgment of a reasonable shareholder in deciding
how to vote ,
Nowdo you accept -chat?
MR, REESE:

Yest we do, Your Honor,

It’s the

significant propensity to affect the judgment of a reasonable
shareholder.

We think that's, for all practical purposes in

decision of concrete cases, the equivalent of this Court’s
formulation in Mills,
QUESTION:
MR, REESE:
QUESTION:

Of "might have".

Of "might have1"?

Yes.
Mr. Reese, I think you've answered the

question I was going to put, but I'll put it more specifically.
Do you perceive any distinction at all between the
standard applied by the Court of Appeals and that proposed by
the SEC?
MR, REESE:

I do not .. I do not, Your Honor, the —*

QUESTION: Do you see any difference between the
standard applied by the Court of Appeals in the Seventh Circuit

26

and that proposed by Judge Friendly in 'the Second Circuit?
MR* REESEs
that I think that

I must confess, Mr* Justice Powell,
that that distinction between "would" and

"might" is indeed gossamer, as both Courts considered that it
might be*
QUESTION:

Your brief, as I recall it, presented a

question before this Court largely as a factual issue, whereas
the question that we took the case to decide, as stated in the
Petition, related to the proper standard*

What you’re telling

us now is it really doesn't matter which of -these formulations
we adoptj so far as you're concerned, you're entitled to
affirmance and a judgment on -Idle facts in this case, as I
undere tand 11,
MR* REESE:

Yes, Mr» Justice Powell»

I might say,

c : course, we took that position in opposition to certiorari
from the beginning»
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes,

MR* REESE: We think that the facts, uncontradicted,
admitted, established, are so obviously important under these
ci'rcumstances that they are beyond the reach of any nice
adjustment, refinement, —
QUESTION:

So that if we adopt it verbatim, the

formulation of the Second Circuit, your position is that the
judgment of the Seventh Circuit should be affirmed?
MRa REESE;

Yes, Mr® Justice Powell, with specific —

27
QUESTION: Would you object to our adopting that
s tandard?
MRo REESE: With this specific understanding, which
I think was plainly understood by the author of the Ggratis
opinion, who chose to use "would5’, that is that "would" does
not introduce an element of probability which must be
determined fit a trial«

That was the concern that Judge

Swygert had with the use of "would", footnote 13 in Judge
Swygert’s opinion.

It becomes very refined, on that question,

and it makes it plain that what he is concerned about is the
possible connotation that "would" means there has to be a
trial of the probability„
QUESTION:

Mills directly rejected that, and

But Mills was ~~ I thought it was dealing

not with the question of materiality but with the question of
causation,

That, is correct, Mr, Justice Stewart,

but “~

And purported to make a distinction

between the two, as my brother Rehnquist has pointed out, in
footnote 3

•*—

4, footnote 4 on page 381 of the Rills opinion,

MR, REESE:

Yes, but I believe that 'the basic question

confronting this Court was not to write an essay on causation,
but to determine what, elements ’were necessary to make a case
of liabilityo

And fchr Court expressly said, it is not

necessary, and would he destructive of the statutory purpose,

28
the congressional purpose; would substitute a judicial
t

appraisal of the merits for the shareholders' actual and
informed vote.
QUESTION; Do you think ~
MR* REESE;
QUESTION;

If that requirement war© imposed*
analyticallyc in the end.,, that

materiality and — questions of materiality and causation
kind of come together and end up to be very much, the same
question?
MR. REESE:

selling document, is broadcast to the public at large# in the
light of a. statutory policy requiring full disclosure# seeking
to encourage reliance, I think# in practice# ~~

At least the way causation has been

held to be, in cases like Mills»
MR® REESE:

Yes.
And Associated Tribe of th® Ute«

os one doesn't have to shew actual reliance of any kind# then
materiality and causation are very much the same thing# aren’t
they?

defense of no causation would never work?

How about the Courts of Appeals?

about trial courts?

Do you know what they say in that

MR. REESE:

There is some authority that if they

don’t nesd the votes, if they have enough votes, half the
vote or half the shares, so they can put it through without a

the proxy statement will not have any causal relationship with,

QUESTION:

Well, anyway, in general, are there some

30
district courts or soma Courts of Appeals that say that causa­
tion is a relevant issue in trials of these cases?
MRs REESE:

That in those situations where the

defendant already has the votes and doesn’t need any proxy
votes, then causation will bar any selection, Thera is
authority to that effect,, yes.

It's a minority*

But if the plaintiff sues and the

defendant says, Well, look, now that plaintiff just was never

MR* REESE:
QUESTION:

The — the —
It. isn't an individual question, it's a

question of causation and —
MR. REESE:

Oh. I should have — I should have made

plainer, Mr* Justice White —- I apologize.

There is a whole

line of cases which says that if the proxy statement did not
authorize the action which caused the injury of which the
plaintiff complains, -there is no causal relationshipj i f the
proxy statement merely failed to reveal some prior wrongdoing,
which is not the subject of the proxy vote, there is no
causal relationship.
The four admitted facts were not speaking to the
question of the basis of the district court's decision, and
whether the district court denied summary judgment on the
ground that it found that there were factual issues*
The grounds on which the district court chose not to

31
grant summary judgment, I think a careful reading will
disclose,, don't — don't rest on a general proposition that
there are genuine issues of material fact»
First, there is the substantial premium over current
market values, represented by the securities being offered to
the TSG shareholders»

He found — he found that that violation

did not warrant summary judgment, because he said there was
no evidence in the record to show that the corrected value
of the warrants — Mr» Keyes' opinion fully explained, said
those warrants were not worth the five™dollar-and-a-quarter
market value that was listed in the proxy statement.

It was

hiss opinion that with the issuance of six times as many
warrants, three million instead of less than half a million,
there would be e; substantial decline, to $3.50»
That decline abolished any — any substantial
premium, and w-a asserted that half — half the opinion had
been presented; the good news had been presented, the bad
raws had been held back»
Judges McLaren rejected that ground, because he said
there was no evidence in the record to show that this revised
warrant value would substantially destroy the premium.
he ...* I think we're at. fault in not making it clear
that all that was required was simple arithmetic as appli&d
to ike exchange ratio, plugging in the market values.
When it carta to the Madison National purchases of

32
260 „000 shares of National Common Stock during the two-year
period for which the market, values are nicely set forth,
conveniently, in the proxy statement, when Edward Merkl© was
on the payroll of National, receiving $12,000 a year for one
day a month, a thousand dollars a day for such services as
the TSC Board might call upon him to perform,,
The reason for denial of summary judgment in the
district court on that ground was, as a matter of law, he
said there is no necessity for disclosure here, unless there
was collusion, unless National and Mr. Merkle from Madison
got together and agreed that they should do this.
We took the position, which we have again perhaps
x .5.1 d to make clear, that, whether Mr. Merkl® was acting in
consultation with National officers or purely unilateral, his
actions were called into question by his relationships with
National as an employee, and there was a duty to disclose,
regardless of whether a substantive violation of some other
provision, sore provision forbidding market rigging, was
involved or not.

We were not saying that the purchases war®

unlawful in themselves, we ware simply saying that they should
be disclosed.

And

QUESTION:

Mr. Reese, excuse nta for interrupting.

The respondent owned 200 shares, as I recall.

What was the

market value of those shares at the time of the merger?
MR. REESE: At the time of the merger, the Preferred

33
Shares were —
QUESTION!

I’m talking about the 20© shares that your

client owned»
MR. REESE!

I would have to add it up.

The shares

were selling at about 12, so I guess that would be about
$2500„
QUESTION! Right»

And what was the market value of

the, securities obtained by your client., oh, say, a month or a
year later?
MR. REESE:

If the market, with the elimination of

the premium, would have bean —
QUESTION: What do you mean by "elimination of the
premium"?
I'm talking now about the securities your client
received in tha merger.
MR. REESE: The value of the Warrant was five and a
quarter, as Hot id in the proxy statement.

Mr. Noyes said

that value will not hold, that market price is not a fair
indicator of the value of the Warrants you will in fact
racsiye, that it. will drop to three--fifty.
Mr. Noyes was right.

It did drop to three-fifty.

Within —
QUESTION: Does your client still hold the securities?
MR. REESE:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION: What are they worth today on the market?

34
MRc REESE:

The Warrants are worth about two

dollars, they’re up with the recant market surge»
Preferred is worth about fourteen dollars»

The

The National

Common, .into which the Preferred is convertible at a discount,
three-quarters of a share of Common, is most recently, I
believe, quoted at eleven dollars»
3: should explain, Your Honor, -that 'those are all
outside the record»
QUESTION: But if you take the current market of
these securities today, as compared with the market pre­
marge r of the whole stock, what’s the theoretical loss to your
client, if he sold out today?
MR» REESE: The theoretical loss — the client in a
sense — I don’t inaan to evade the question; but the suit is
derivative»

MR. REESE:
Honor.

I would think substantially more, Your

Our expert has analysed the value of TSC, and its

shares, and. th® valu© of the National securities that wars
received.

He has concluded that the TSC securities were under-

35
valued and depressed after National obtained control , and
that their true value was not 12 or 13, but perhaps somewhere
in the twenties, so we*d be talking about a matter of tan
dollars or more per share«,
QUESTION?

Unh-hunh*

Arid the respondent is a

personal holding corporation?
MRe REESE;

I think that's probably a grand

description for a family —* a personal corporation that a
retired businessman established simply as part of his estate
planning and to handle his personal investments*
The grounds of Judge McLaren*s opinion — if I may
resume and try to put that one to rest — he held as a matter
of 1- .v? that there was no duty to disclose unless there was in
fact manipulation•

And that is not a determination of

adjudication as to a question of fact but as to what the law
requires«,
My time has expired*
Thank you0
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Do you have anything

further, Mr* Morency?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH N. MORENCY, JR., ESQ*,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MORENCY;

Just a very limited matter or two, if

the Court please,
I would like to say, first of all, that I think we

36

deal effectively with this matter of the Hornblower opinion
in our Reply Brief, in which we point out to the Court that
in referring to a substantial premium over current market
values, the Hornblower firm and Noyes referred to a premium
measured by market prices at the time the exchange ratio was
determined in early October.
And 'the premium was certainly there 0
W® point out in our Reply Brief that there was a
premium of 22 percent for one class of stock and 17 for
another, or 19 and 17,
Secondly, I think that in the discussion insufficient
attention has bean given to the SEC definitional effort in
their brief.

Admittedly, as the Justices have brought out,

tai.y do espouse essentially a Mills test at page 4, but look
at page 14.
Thera they say they reject: the restatement of torts
tist, which is essentially the same thing as the Mills test.
That is why it was' not in an effort to be coy or facetious
tint I suggestsd so strongly to the Court that that brief be
with ere;-' i care, because it meets itself coining around
the comer.
QUESTION:

Well, it nays — it rejects a statement

that a reasonable man would attach importance.
MR. MOKENCY:

No, I don't think, Mr. Justice White.

I think, if you go to page 14 —

37
QUESTION?

That’s where I am.

MR. MORENCY:

-- of the SEC brief, you will find them

saying that they reject the idea ‘that the test of materiality,
which 'Hie Gerstla opinion, the Smallwood opinion, the Lewis
case and others have adhered to, that is, where or not a
reasonable man would attach importance to it in determining
his choice of action in the transaction in question —
QUESTION:

That’s right, would

attach? would

attach„
MR. MORENCY s
QUESTION:

Un-*hunh.
"Would" attach0

That’s the word they

disagree with.
MR. MORENCY:
QUESTION:

I read —
And what they embrace is that a

reasonable man "might have" or would there be a significant
propensity that a reasonable man would? not that he would, as
a matter of fact.
MR. MORENCY:

Well, let me. suggest to the Court

that
QUESTION: Well, at least that’s the only difference
that I can see in the test, they propose and the test that
they rejact.
MR. MORENCYs

I'm hopeful that this Court will

announce a standard of materiality on which the members of the
Court and the members of the bar can agree as to its meaning,

whatever your standard may be.
and assemble one for yourselves,

You're well able to phrase
I don't purport to suggest

that to you,
But I do suggest that, you've got to stick with a
reasonable shareholder test; and that you've got to be
extremely careful in allowing the Courts of Appeals to deter­
mine, as a matter of law., that certain facts are so critical
as to warrant upsetting an entire 80-page proxy statement,
Aifd that is what the Seventh. Circuit did in rejecting;item
after item after item, the judgments mad® by the district
judge who went over this record with great care,

Judges make mistakes? lawyers make

But I think the number of mistakes made in this

area can be substantially diminished once this Court lays down
a test of materiality in plain language that we can all read,
and perhaps even uses the nitpicking omissions in this case
as illustrations of that which is not sufficient as a matter
