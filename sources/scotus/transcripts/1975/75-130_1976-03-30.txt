PROCEEDINGS

MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 75^130, Robert Quinn against Muscare.
Mr. Quinlan, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
oral argument of william r, quinlan, esq.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. QUINLAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may It please

the Court:
The fundamental issues presented for review here are
one, whether in suspensions of nonprobationary State and local
governmental employees for cause due process requires a hearing
before the suspension becomes effective.
Secondly, is due process satisfied"'by a post-suspen­
sion hearing where in the event the charges against the employee
are disallowed he is awarded back pay and the suspension is de­
leted from the employee's service record.
Additionally, because of the context in which this
case comes to this Court, there is a collateral issue, that is,
whether or not municipal fire departments can constitutionally
promulgate rules requiring its fire fighters to limit the amount
and location of their facial hair for, among other reasons, to
insure the efficient operation of gas masks that- fire fighters
are required to wear.
The facts are, basically, as follows.

The Respondent

Francis Muscare, a Lieutenant in the Chicago Fire Department,

4
has been a fire fighter with the Chicago Fire Department since
1955»

The Chicago Fire Department, as I alluded to earlier, has

a Rule 51*9.33 limiting the amount of facial hair that may be
worn by fire fighters to at most a small moustache and precisely
limited sideburns with no beard.

But from October 1973 until

the trial of this cause in March of 1974, Lt. Museare wore a
goatee.

In fact, some three years before, Museare had worn the

same sort of beard.

At that time, he had been ordered to shave

it off but refused.

In consequence, at a uniform inspection,

h3s superior officers declined to inspect him.

He then brought

himself into compliance by shaving.
The following year, Museare again grew a beard.

This

time, he was summoned- before a departmental board consisting of
two fire chiefs and an .instructor in the fire academy in the
use of safety masks.

At that hearing he was told to shave off

the beard again, and again Lt. Museare reluctantly complied,
However, in December of 1973, when Lt. Museare
appeared with his squad at the Chicago Fire Department Academy
for instruction in a two-day course in the use of self-contained
breathing apparatus, which are safety masks, he was again
Wearing a beard.
The instructor was Fire Fighter Leonard Johnson,
Later at the trial, Johnson testified that during the class he
informed Museare on the basis of the instructional material that
he had been provided with and his experience that facial hair

5
should not be worn with safety masks.
Muscare disputed this and contended that New York and
Boston permitted fire fighters to wear long hair and beards.
Each member of the class was expected to put the
apparatus on, charge it and test it to determine whether or not
he was getting a good facial fit,
Johnson stated that by watching a fire fighter try on
a mask he could tell whether he succeeded in obtaining a tight
facial seal.

But Muscare failed to test the apparatus in the

class at the Fire Aeaderny.
I might indicate from the record it is not clear
whether a lieutenant would be required to do so since he was
dealing with a fire fighter as an instructor.

However, he did

not in fact try on the mask.
On the second day of class, each student was expected
to walk up five floors of the Fire Academy building and then
back down to the first floor with the gas masks on, sealed and
functioning.

Muscare did not.

Instructor Johnson stated at the trial that he did
not know whether Muscare while wearing his beard could get a
good seal on the mask, because Muscare did not put the mask on
and a gas mask can be tested only by a man putting it on.
In due course, Instructor Johnson reported Muscare’s
conduct in the class to the Drill Master,

Muscare was soon, in

the same month of December 1973, ivarned that he would not be

6
permitted to continue working unless he shaved off his beard.
A few days later, Museare was advised that charges
had been filed against him with the administrative authorities
of the Fire Department.

Because of the fortuitous circumstances

the superior with authority to impose the penalty was taken ill
with appendicitis, no further action was taken for more than two
months.

Then a suspension of 29 days was issued in February of

197^ to Museare and he was notified in person by three superior
officers who came to his fire station and informed him that he
was suspended, effective immediately,

A letter subsequently

followed on March 4, 197^j> from the Chief of Personnel, Chief
Braun, which indicated that he was charged with violation of
three rules.
The first rule was the failure to conform to the
grooming code; the second rule was his violation of conduct
unbecoming a fire fighter; and the third violation was dis­
obedience of a direct and lawful order,
Museare did not exercise his statutory right provided
for under the Illinois Statutes, Chapter' 24, Section 18-1, to
a hearing before the Civil Service Commission,

The Civil Service

Commission is empowered in the event that it finds the suspen­
sion unwarranted, that the employee would be entitled to back
pay for the period of the suspension and erasure of the sus­
pension from his employment.
From an adverse determination of the Commission, the

7
employee has a statutory right to judicial review with the right
of further appeal to the higher court*
Muscare failed to exhaust these remedies.

Instead of

exhausting these administrative remedies before the Civil Service
Commission, Muscare filed the instant lawsuit under 43 USC 1983
on March 11th.
The basic thrust of the complaint dealt with and
asked for declaratory injunctive relief on the grounds that the
grooming code of the Fire Department infringed upon his consti­
tutional rights, and that the other two violations that he had
been charged with were both vague and, therefore, overly broad
and unconstitutional.

He also indicated that he did not receive

due process of Xaxtf in the imposition of this penalty.
The District Court denied both a temporary and perman­
ent injunction, upheld the validity of the no-beard rule, in­
dicating that Muscare had been afforded due process and entered
a judgment in favor of the Department.
Primarily, the court did not look to any of the other
two reasons that had been alleged for the basis of this grooming
code.

One of which was the Fire Department was a paramilitary

organization and, as such, required discipline and, two, that
the grooming code was appropriate in a uniform force.
QUESTION:

Did the District Court focus on the pro­

cedural due process question that became the foundation of the
Court of Appeals opinion?

8
MR, QUINLAN:

That was primarily not the thrust of

the argument before the District Court.

It came on in a pre-

J.iminary injunction and motions were filed In support and op­
position to the preliminary injunction.
He determined that the facial

or th® grooming code of

the Department was rationally related to safety measures,
.although other arguments had been made for it.

The Issue was

raised on a motion for reconsideration that due process issues
were also raised.

He then Indicated that his judgment presumed

that the due process was satisfactory to comply with the
0onstitution.
And, accordingly, the. judgment, I wou.ld say, was based
upon both thoS'e grounds.
QUESTION: . But there wasn't very much discussion of
the question of procedural due process •—
MR. QUINLAN:

No, sir —

QUESTION:

at the District Court level, was there?

MIL QUINLAN:

No, sir, that is quite correct.

On appeal, the attention focused then on the due
process issue as opposed to the validity of the grooming code.
The Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit reversed,
finding that no hearing of any kind was afforded the Appellant
prior to his suspension, and that full suspension review pro­
vided by State statute would not satisfy the requirements of due
process.

9
The Court of Appeals did not deem it necessary to
determine whether a trial type proceeding was essential to due
process, nor did the Court deem it necessary to pass on the
validity of the Fire Department’s no-beard rule.
The Court here granted certiorari on March 14, 1975*
As we view the issues, there are several considerations
that we believe ought to be taken in resolving this question.
Initially, in a governmental type of employment situation, the
argument is raised whether it is a property interest or some
liberty has been violated before due process applies.
We believe that under the decisions of this Court in
dealing with governmental employees that any property or
Interest in the job is determined by State statute or by
eontract.
Here we have a State statute x-zhich provides for a non­
probationary employee to receive certain rights.

One of these

rights is a hearing ;Lf he is suspended for more than five days
subsequent to the suspension.

For the period from one to five

days, no hearing ds provided.

For any procedure for suspension

beyond five days, then there is a full-blown hearing required
before the sanction can be imposed.

He is entitled to counsel,

notice of written charges and subpoena power is available both
to the Civil Service Commission and to the individual.
So, in this context, it is our argument that the
property right of the individual is determined by the statute.

10

Once the property right is determined by the statute,
I,he question then becomes what is necessary to accomplish due
process of law in that context, as we view the case.
Under our interpretation of the cases of this Court,
particularly Arnett v. Kennedy, it is not required that the individual have a pretrial or presuspension hearing.
the Court will recall, was a termination case.
pension case.

Arnett, as

This is a sus­

And under these circumstances, we believe, that

the right to a hearing subsequent to the imposition of a sus­
pension of more than five days is adequate due process under
these circumstances.
On the five day position with one to five days, it
would be our contention that the legislature has recognized
this as not involving a property right at all- that this would
be rev leviable only on the basis of an appeal to the Circuit
Court by writ of mandamus or,, perhaps, by filing a 1983 action
in the United States District Court to review whether the
action taken was arbitrary or capricious.
QUESTION:

Was it ever indicated below what the

hearing was supposed to be directed at, or what was the need
for the hearing?

The one who is claiming the hearing.
MR. QUINLAN:

He indicated that he was entitled to

some right to notice and opportunity to be heard.
QUESTION:

About what?

MR. QUINLAN:

About what?

About whether — one of his contentions

was about whether or not the 29~day suspension was a severe
suspension under the circumstances, also —
QUESTION:

That isn't — that's just a —

Well, I'll put it another way.
Was there any factual dispute in the case?

MR.

QUINLAN:

As to his wearing of the goatee?

No,

there was not.
QUESTION:

Or any other factual dispute, for that

matter?
MR. QUINLAN:

There was a factual dispute in relation

to whether or not one could get a close fit, or a tight fit,
even if he had facial hair.

It was admitted by the expert that

testified on behalf of the City of Chicago, as well as by the
drill instructor, that it was theoretically possible that such
an individual could obtain a good or secure fit.

This could not

12
be determined, however, without the individual trying on the
mask,
QUESTION:

You won{t reach that question, though,

unless you say that there are some limits on the right of the
Fire Department to prevent beards,
MRa QUINLAN:

I think it is a twofold answer to that,

Justice White,
First of all, it was upheld at the District Court
level as being a general rule of regulation, and as a general
rule it could be applied uniformly, even though in specific
instances it might not, in fact, cause any danger or safety
problem.

It was a generic and uniform rule.
So I think that on that ground that that would be the

basis of doing it.
Second of all, I think you are absolutely correct,
there are a number of cases that now suggest that whether or
not the right to wear hair or a hairstyle or facial beards is
of constitutional dimension, in dealing with police and fire
departments there is obviously a legitimate interest in the
State for limiting facial hair.
So in the first point, it was a general rule that the
Court found it was based upon a rational related basis, namely,
safety.

And the expert did testify that in his judgment facial

hair would cause difficulties in getting a secure fit on the
rask.

However, he indicated that because of the structure of

13
Individual faces* because of the difference in the dental
structure of chins* etcetera* that in a particular instance it
anight not* in fact* cause the problem.

But as a general rule

it was his opinion that facial hair would prevent or could pre­
vent a close or tight fit on the gas nask.
QUESTION;

The Respondent contends here* doesn't he*

that even though the facts surrounding the gas mask incident
nay be undisputed* he should at least have had a hearing in
order to argue whether a penalty should be imposed to* in
effect* argue in mitigation?
MR. QUINLAN;
suspension hearing.

Yes, he does.

He argues for a pre­

There is a post-suspension hearing procedure

provided for by statute that he did not avail himself of,, so
that that could have been reviewed at that time.

It would have

been within the propriety of the Civil Service Commission to
either remove it completely or lower it if it did not believe
that that was the appropriate suspension.
QUESTION;

Is there any opportunity at all before the

suspension takes effect for him to write a letter or to say
anything at all fee anybody?
MR. QUINLAN;
Mr. Justice White.

There is no formalized procedure*

As a matter of fact* he did have these

opportunities on other occasions.

He once went before a depart­

mental review board to argue the position.
the departmental review board.

It was rejected by

From time to time* these types of

14

matters have been matters which are discussed within the
department, and it is possible to secure a meeting with the
member who would be in a position to issue that particular
penalty.
There is nothing in the record to support that, but
ais a practical matter these sources have been available, but
it is not a matter of procedure nor a matter of right.
QUESTION:

Mr. Quinlan.

MRo QUINLAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Exactly what issue do you consider to be

before us on this appeal?
MR. QUINLAN:

Well, Your Honor, we consider both

Issues to be before you.
QUESTION:

The due process issue and the substantive

validity of the beard regulation?
.**■>

MR0 QUINLAN:

Yes, Your Honor, we believe that this

Court, of course, has the power to review the facial grooming
code of the Fire Department even though the Court of Appeals did
not pass on it.
QUESTION:

If we agree with the Court of Appeals and

the case was remanded for a due process hearing, then that would
be the only issue i^e need address here, I take it?

If the

Court agreed with the Court of Appeals.
MR. QUINLAN:

If the Court agreed with the Court of

Appeals that the requirement was correct but that there was a

15
due process hearing necessary?
QUESTION:

If we agreed with the Court of Appeals,

do you think we should go ahead and address the substantive due
process issue that was not decided by the Court of Appeals?
MR„ QUINLAN:

Yes, Your Honor, I would submit that

I think this Court should because that issue then would remain
open,

Because even if he were to receive a hearing or this

Court were to require a presuspension hearing, the entire issue
then comes back to the one that was ruled upon in the District
Court as to whether or not this particular rule was constitu­
tional,,

If it were unconstitutional, of course, then whether or

not he had a hearing x^ould be somewhat irrelevant,
QUESTION:
tive remedies.

The Respondent did not exhaust administra­

Are you making that point?

MR, QUINLAN:

He did make that point, Your Honor, yes,

that he had the choice to secure administrative remedies under
the State procedures and he did not do so,
QUESTION:

Do you urge that in this Court?

MR, QUINLAN:
QUESTION:

So you are presenting three issues,

MR, QUINLAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, we do,

Yes, sir,

Well, if we were to decide that the grooming

code is constitutional, what would be the occasion for a hearing
on a remand?
MR, QUINLAN:

The occasion for a hearing on remand —

16
the basis if this Court were to assume that the Court of
Appeals appropriately interprets Goss v. Lopez and Arnett v,
Kennedy, then, of course, the Court of Appeals was saying that
you cannot impose a penalty of even one day or a suspension —
QUESTION:

Even if the grooming code were constitu­

tional?
MRe QUINLAN:

Even if the grooming code was consti­

tutional.
QUESTION:

One question would be whether, even

assuming it's a valid regulation — this hair, moustache and
goatee regulation — whether or not a 29-day suspension was too
harsh a penalty.

That would be one of the questions to be

inquired Into at any hearing, wouldn't it?
MR, QUINLAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Can't it involve his good, faith belief

that it was an invalid regulation.

It might involve a good

many —
MR. QUINLAN:

We suggest that avenue was open to him

by seeking review before the Civil Service Commission which he
did not avail himself —
QUESTION:

That's the separate question suggested

by my brother Powell as to exhaustion of administrative
remedies.
MR. QUINLAN:

Yes, sir.

That is correct.

That would

be an issue, and that would be one of the things, of course, if

1?
he had employed the procedure under the Civil Service Commission,
The Civil Service Commission would have to determine whether or
not the suspension — the propriety of the suspension,
QUESTION:

Well, do you understand the Respondents to

have even made the contention that a 29-day suspension for
violation of this regulation, assuming that procedural due
process was complied with and assuming that the regulation is
valid, is some sort of a cruel and unusual punishment, or so
arbitrary that the punishment itself would violate the United
States Constitution?
MR* QUINLAN:
that argument.

No, I do not understand them to make

As I understand their argument, Justice Rehnquisfc,

It is that he was entitled to offer evidence in mitigation to
determine what might be an appropriate penalty, and that
perhaps he might have an argument that in his case he could
wear the mask, or that he was advised by counsel that it was
unconstitutional, and accordingly these might be grounds upon
which the Department would determine that such a suspension was
unduly severe,
QUESTION:

In addition to having a beard that appeared

to violate the regulation, the Respondent declined to obey an
Express order, didn!t he?
MR, QUINLAN:

That is correct, to shave off the

beard,
QUESTION:

Well, I thought the order was to put the

18

t;as mask on and he refused to do that»
MR5 QUINLAN:

No, there is no evidence that he was

ordered to put on the mask»

As X indicated earlier to one of

the Justices, there would be some question as to whether or not
a fire fighter could direct a lieutenant to do so.
QUESTION:

This was a mask drill, wasn't it?

MRo QUINLAN:
QUESTION:

Normally, —

A mask drill, yes, sir,

And he did not put the mask on?

MR» QUINLAN:

No, sir, he did not at that time.

He

indicated that he subsequently put it on,
QUESTION:

There is no claim that he disobeyed

an order to put it on at that time?
MR0 QUINLAN:
QUESTION:

No, sir, that is not —

Because the teacher, the instructor, was

si fire fighter, as you said,

This Respondent is a lieutenant

and there would be some question about any — the power of a
fire fighter to give an order to a lieute even in the environment
of a school, correct?
MR, QUINLAN:

He probably would have to have the

support of the drill master in such circumstances.

Normally,

;lf they participate in the drill and it takes place it just goes
X

forward.

In this instance the Lieutenant chose not to do so,
QUESTION:

He was served with the charges, I take it,

before the suspension?
MR, QUINLAN:

No, sir.

He was notified first by

19
Chief Morgan that unless he shaved his beard he could not con­
tinue to serve in the Fire Service., and a couple of days later
he was notified the charges had' been tendered to Chief Fire
Marshal

Foley who was the only one authorized to impose any

sanction whatsoever.

Chief Morgan could not Impose any sanction

under the rules of the Fire Department.
QUESTION:

What were the charges that v?ere made

against him?
MR. QUINLAN:

That is not clear.

The charges,
(?)
basically, as I understand them again as it de jures the_ record
was on the basis of failure to shave off the goatee after
receiving a direct order to do so.
QUESTION:

What did the letter from the Chief of

Personnel say?
MR. QUINLAN:

The letter from the Chief of Personnel

enumerated the three regulations which he was in violation of,
one of which was the dress code which specifically provides for
a limited wearing of sideburns, a moustache that cannot go be­
yond the lips and no wearing of face hair on the chin or a

beard.
QUESTION:
those regulations?

Did it say that he was in violation of
Did it mention conduct unbecoming an officer

and disobedience of orders?
MRo QUINLAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Well, now how about those latter two

20
matters?

Did it indicate — did the letter indicate what those

charges consisted of?
MR. QUINLAN:

Well, the direct -- the lawful ones —

no, it did not specifically specify*
tions*

There were generic charges*

There were no specifica­
They would evolve,

obviously, from the situation where he refused the order of
Chief Morgan to shave off the goatee, and this would constitute
conduct unbecoming an officer*
Under the State law of Illinois, any of the charges,
If sufficient, would be grounds for the suspension.
QUESTION:

Do you think the due process question is

any different if you are suspended for disobedience to an
order than when you are suspended for disobeying the hair code
or if you are charged with conduct unbecoming an officer?
MR. QUINLAN:

Well, it might be if you are getting

into a situation where you are talking about an emergency type
of situation, because of the context in which it takes place,
that it might be immediately necessary fco summarily remove
somebody from that position as a fire fighter, such as he re­
fused an order to enter a building or refused —
QUESTION:

Bat If it goes on your record that you

are suspended for conduct unbecoming an officer without there
being any indication of what the conduct was, thatfs a little
bit different than saying you wore a moustache*
boo harsh.

It was a little

21
MR, QUINLAN;

Yes, it is.

He would have had an opportunity if he chose to seek
«

review of that, to b3ve that set forth, the basis of the various
charges»
QUESTION;

You are speaking of the Civil Service

review?
MR. QUINLAN:
QUESTION;

Yes.

Suppose he had taken that route, asked for

the review and they sustained his position.

Would he have re­

ceived the back pay for whatever period had elapsed?
MR. QUINLAN;

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, he would have

and also the disciplinary sanction would have been expunged
from his record, so that he would have been right back where he
started, as having never been disciplined.
QUESTION;

The only problem —

There is nothing more that he is asking

for that he —* or is there anything that he is asking for that
he could not have gotten, conceivably, by the administrative
review?

.
MR, QUINLAN;

In my judgment, quite honestly, not.

However, he Is saying that he has a right before any sanction is
imposed to a hearing because of the fact of loss of wages and
because of the interference with his alleged property rights,

What about the validity of the grooming

Could he have had that determined on administrative

MR. QUINLAN:

He could have raised that issue at

that time and the propriety of that would have been reviewed,
Probably —
QUESTION:

May the Civil Service Commission decide

the constitutionality of the question?
MR. QUINLAN:

I was just going to say they probably

would not have decided on a constitutional basis but they would
have reviewed it as to whether or not it was a reasonable
regulation of the department,
QUESTION:

But that would not answer his constitutional

challenge.
MR. QUINLAN:

No, but he could raise the constitutional

challenge on appeal to the Circuit Court,
QUESTION:

I was going to ask: there would have been

Judicial review of the Civil Service determination?
MR, QUINLAN:

Yes, sir, so that after whatever de­

termination the Civil Service Commission made he would be
entitled to employ judicial review to the Circuit Court,
QUESTION:

Mr. Quinlan, has the regulation since been

changed?
MR. QUINLAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, it has,

And does that affect the posture of this

case in any way?
MR, QUINLAN:

It is our judgment it does not affect

the posture of this case because this was a voluntary change on

23
the part of the now Personnel Board which has surplanfeed the
Civil Service Commission and the Fire Department®

The basis of

it was that this case was in conflict with the Kropel case
which upheld * basically, the five-day — the review’ after more
than five-day suspension, plus then t*re had the case here,
Quinn v» Musca re 5 that held that you had to have a hearing for
even one day*
Accordingly, to avoid any problem with issues of
back pay or things of that nature, the department personnel
chose to adopt the regulation authorizing review for suspensions,
even of a day or more»

It breaks down into three different

categories„
QUESTION:

If you prevail here, will you go back to

the old regulation?
MR, QUINLAN:

I doubt that very much®

The procedure

has not had a long Inventory of experience but this is like
any other personnel procedure that is adopted j It seems that
once, you take a step forward if it seems to work appropriately
and Is more satisfactory to the personnel, it would continue to
persist „
QUESTION:

Well, with the change In regulations, I

just wonder how important this case tea become since It was
bsken"?
MR, QUINLAN:

I think it is important on a twofold

basis, one of which is the aspect whether or not the burden

24
would be on the employee to seek review.

Under our current

rules and regulations, for anything under five days he must
file a written notice within 24 hours with the department asking
for a hearing.

He has a hearing then before a departmental

officer and if he concurs in the original judgment that is
certified to the Personnel Board that then imposes it.

But if

he writes the letter the sanction is not imposed for 24 hours.
If it is more than five days, he then has 24 hours to ask for
a review by the Civil Service Commission.

Then it is up to

the Civil Service Commission to sustain the finding of the
Individual department.

If it is, obviously, for more than thirty

days, between five and thirty, It's the Personnel Board that
would determine whether the department’s action is appropriate.
He has to request it.
On the other hand, if it is more than thirty days,
then charges must be brought against him officially with the
Personnel Board and that is a full trial-type of proceeding.

Yes, sir.

— looking at page 9 of the Appendix, It

appears that Respondent d5.d request back pay as a part of his

claim for relief in the District Court because he was not given
a presuspension hearing.

I suppose that element of his claim

would survive regardless of the amendment of the regulation.
MR. QUINLAN:

I am not sure I understand your question,

25
Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

Well* presumably* If all he saw was an

injunction against the enforcement of these regulations and you
change the regulations* the injunctive issue may well be moot.
But if he seeks back pay as a result of the application of the
injunction* that claim survives* I would think* even though you
change the regulations so that injunctive relief would no longer
be appropriate.
MR. QUINLAN:

If you were to hold that the due

process requirements require a

We would then be in a situation where

we had suspended him inappropriately and he would be entitled
to back pay for that period of time.

I think you are correct*

sir,
I would like to save what little time I have left for
rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well* Mr. Quinlan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LINDA HIRSHMAN* ESQ.
FOR THE RESPONDENTS
MRS. HIRSHMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please

the Court:
My name is Linda Hirshman and I represent the
Respondent Lfc. Francis Muse are in this action.
In light of your questions of Mr, Quinlan* I think I
would like to begin with the issue of what a hearing might have

26

consisted of had Respondent been allowed or provided with even
the most rudimentary hearing prior to his 29“day suspension0
The record in this ease demonstrates that Respondent
was suspended from his employment for 29 days, based on three
violations — alleged violations of three Chicago Fire Department
rules and regulations, the rule prescribing proper personal
appearance, the rule forbidding disobedience of orders and the
)

rule forbidding conduct unbecoming a member or employee of the
Chicago Fire Department.
At no time until the hearing in Federal Court on his
constitutional claims did Respondent find out from Petitioner
what underlying facts were involved in their charges against
him»
However, based' on these charges alone, obviously,
there are several levels at which Respondent could have
utilized a prior hearing.
First of all, on the question of proper personal
appearance.

On the bare facts at issue here, what you have is

the administration taking a look at Respondent and making their
determination without ever finding out from him, for example,
whether his self-contained breathing apparatus fits, which he
testified without rebuttal at trial it did, with no problem at
drill and fighting fires,
QUESTION:

But, Mrs 6 Hirshman, there is no proviso in

the regulation, is there, that you are exempt from it if your

27

aelf-contained breathing apparatus fits?
MI&3 o HIRSHMAN:

No* that really speaks to the fact

that the Petitioner adhered so tenaciously to the fact that the
only justification for the regulation was the safe use of the
self-contained breathing apparatus and« indeed, would go to
loltigation if not to the substantive violation.
The Fire Commissioner had a range of penalties which
Lie can Impose for violations of the range of rules involved in
the Fire Department Rules and Regulations * of which Respondent
was accused of violating three,
He could have chosen a reprimand.

He could have

chosen, as Acting Chief Fire Marshal Foley did, initially, in
3)ecember, to do nothing to Respondent,
Furthermore, Respondent had numerous things to say on
the subject of disobedience of orders.

Disobedience of orders

is a classic factual issue involving questions of the authority
to give the order, which we saw discussed here just a moment
ago,
QUESTION:

Are you speaking of the classroom episode?

MIS, HIRSHMAN:

Either the classroom episode or —

we don11 know, Mr, Chief Justice, because all we got was a
letter that sa3.d disobedience of orders,

We never found out

any factual basis, what orders were disobeyed, who gave them,
whether Respondent properly heard them, whether the person was
authorized to give Respondent an order, and so forth.

All things

28
of which he should have properly been notified and given an
opportunity to respond to before he was suspended for 29 days.
QUESTION;

Was he free to ask for what would be the

equivalent of a bill of particulars?
MRS„ HIRSHMAN:

No, Mr, Chief Justice, because

essentially what he had was a Chief, in December, said to him
«*« he did not say to him,

‘'You cannot continue working for the

Fire Department if you continue to wear your goatee."

That is

not what he said»
If you will look at the complaint

or, I am sorry,

Respondent1a affidavit which is the only place where there Is
any evidence about the encounter between Chief Morgan and
Respondent.

It is there.

Chief Morgan said.

You will see that that is not what

He said something like,

"Shave the beard,"

and "You are working under charges»"
QUESTION:

Where is the affidavit?

MRS0 HIR3HMAN:

In the Appendix at pages 18 ■— I am

sorry, page 19, paragraph, of the affidavit, three.
Petitioner never brought Chief Morgan to testify at
i

the hearing on the preliminary injunction, and so Respondent’s
affidavit stands unrebutted on the subject of the conversation.
At any rate, working under charges is in a sense part
of the sort of on-going employment situation and very dicerent
from,

Other kinds of things,

for example, whether or not Lfc, Muscare got a good fit —
QUESTION:

Why don't we talk about this ease?

MRS0 HIRSHMAN:

All right.

I think that this case

ought to have involved an ability to appear in person —
QUESTION:

So you say the Constitution entitled you

to an oral hearing before suspension in this case?
MRS® HIRSHMAN:

I am asking you to affirm the Circuit

Qourt opinion that says that this wasn't enough and we'll work
out what's enough as we get it on a case" by case basis.

But I

would say that in this case where you have a question, a dis­
puted question of fact, for example, in the mitigation issue in
terms of whether or not the man's safety mask fit, he ought to
have been given a moment in front of someone with the authority
to make a decision about the severity cf his suspension to show
them ~~ it's a very simple test *— that he gets a vacuum seal
on his face mask.
The question of disobedience of orders Is a very
large one, and the question of conduct unbecoming a member or
employee of the Fire Department is a very large one, and X think
depending on what the specifics of the charges were would depend

32

on how much of a hearing he would be asking for»
QUESTION:

You wouldn't say that he was entitled to

call any witnesses?
MRS» HIRSKMAN:

I think that it varies, as you said*

depending on the situation*
QUESTION:

Talking about this ease., do you think you

would have been entitled to call witnesses?
MRS, HIRSKMAN:
QUESTION:

Before he —

Not general — not in general, just this

case*
MRS o HIE3HMAN:

Disobedience of orders might have

involved incidents in which calling of witnesses would be very
pertinent.-

I think that what we have here Is a situation where

bhe notice was so inadequate that we can't really speak to what
the hearing would have to consist of until we had a decent
notice of what the charges were.
QUESTION:

In the same affidavit that you emphasized

to us, paragraph three, that is his affidavit, is it not?
MRS» HIRSKMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

It recites, "that the Chief instructed him

to shave his beard off," and that he declined to do so.

Now,

«hat could a notice tell you about that that his affidavit
doesn't show?
MRSo HIRSKMAN:

Well, as it turns out, that what

Acting Fire Marshal Foley had In mind when he decided to suspend

33
Lt. Muscare for 29 days.
Acting Fire Marshal Foley had in mind two earlier
incidents that Chief Foley had not been present at, that he had
just heard about, when he determined that 29 days was the proper
suspension length for Lt. Muscare.
QUESTION:

Where do we find that out?

MRS „ HIRSHMAN:
page 134, "Answer.

So —

There is testimony to that effect at

0i!tThis particular person involved had been

involved in this argument about hair and about the beard prior
to this affair and had complied by shaving it off.

Now it

was the second time around,"
Now, Lt. Muscare did not have notice that Acting Chief
Fire Marshal Foley had in his mind his concept of what had gone
before in Lt» Muscare’s career, never had a chance to answer
him anything about it, when he found three Fire Marshals
entering his duty station and telling him to turn in his
badge, that he was being suspended for a 29-day period involving
a loss of $1400 in pay for him.
Essentially, what we are saying here is that — and
by the way, just as an aside, we have made the contention that
due process was violated in the suspension procedures from the

very outset of this litigation.

It is contained in the complaint

and we have consistently litigated the issue and there is sub­
stantial testimony -QUESTION: . Is there an administrative hearing still

34
open to you?
MRS» HIRSHMAN:

Yes,

There Is no time limit on the

administrative hearing,
QUESTION:

And If you succeeded in whatever it was you

wanted to present at that hearing you would get back pay to the
initiation of the suspension?

MK5o HIRSHMAN:

Yes,

The problem with the hearing* in

addition to the fact that it is not guaranteed at any time
relative to the suspension, that is to say there is no guarantee
of promptness in the statute whatsoever --the statute is silent
about the timing of the later hearing,

But in addition to that

at the later hearing, under the existing law, Lt. Muscare has
to bear the burden of proving that the suspension was wrongful,
based on a letter which had nothing but three rule numbers on
It,

And with that kind of notice, and without ever hearing —

as It turned out we found out In the trial In Federal Court —
what Chief Foley, part of what Chief Foley had in his mind.
But without ever hearing that, with nothing but that letter under
the Illinois law, his later hearing — he has to go to the later
hearing and disprove, for example, conduct unbecoming a member
or employee of the Chicago Fire Department without ever knowing
what underlay those charges.
And so the later hearing is obviously insufficient under
any circumstances, and there is — it is my understanding that

35
there Is no issue over exhaustion of administrative remedies
here#

first of all, because we are suing under 1983*and secondly,

because as this Court recently handed down in Matthews v»
Ellsrich, when you have a claim that your right to a prior
hearing has been violated then you don't have to exhaust in
order to bring your constitutional claim.
So I think the paucity of, the real lack of value of
the later hearing is illustrated by all of these things.
QUESTION:

Doesn't the remedies available on the

later hearing at least serve to factually distinguish this ease
from Goss which the 7th Circuit relied on?

Here, your man can

get back pay and he can get expungementj whereas, I take it, in
loss there was no way that a later hearing could have restored
fche school children, to the days they missed from school.
MIS. HIRSHMAN:

Well, the loss of the pay for 30 clays

for an adult who is working and earning his living and relying
on his salary is a serious deprivation, and I don't think that
you can so readily distinguish the issue on the grounds that
you could always get back pay, because as this Court has noted
back pay doesn't necessarily make up for the taking away of the
property without prior procedures.

InSniadach the woman might

have gotten her wages back and —
QUESTION:

Wasn't that true in Arnett v. Kennedy?

MRS. BIRSHMAN:

My understanding of Arnett v. Kennedy

is that three of the justices who ruled in Arnett v, Kennedy held

36
that the Federal employee should have been given an evidentiary
hearing prior to his discharge* and that two of the justices
held that the very protective procedures in Arnett v. Kennedy
were sufficient to satisfy, to constitute-an accommodation of
competing interests, and that three of you directed yourselves
to the property issue and «*«QUESTION:

I am speaking about your argument that has

to do with the depriva1 of pay until after the hearing, and I
am asking whether the factual situation in Arnett v, Kennedy
wasn’t precisely the same in this respect as in this case?
MRS* HIRSHMAN:

No, Mr, Justice Blackmun, because in

Arnett v, Kennedy the Federal employee had 30 days advance
notice of the pending adverse action against him; he had an
opportunity to submit affidavits and to appear orally; he had a
copy of the charges and the material underlying the charges; he
had a really substantially protective procedure before the
deprivation was imposed.
My understanding of this Court's recent writing in
Eayning -- if that *s the proper pronunciation -«• y, Indiana
State Emp1oyees Associaiion is that the question of, is .that
*

Arnett did not determine that a public employee could be sus­
pended or discharged without any prior procedures.
Indeed, this case stands in the greatest contrast to
Arnett v, Kennedy because for every protective procedure in
Arnett there is a complete void of protective procedures here.

37
In place of 30 days advance notice* fire marshals walked Into
Lt. Muscare's fire station and told him to turn in his badge.
In place of a copy of the mafcer5.al that the discharge was based
on* Lt. Museare didn’t find out even what Chief Foley ted in
his mind until we went to Federal Court on a constitutional
challenge to the actions against him.
So that if Arnett represents what is acceptable* it
seems to me that -what was done in this case represents what is
not acceptable.

It Is so divoid •»-

QUESTION; If you think there are factual issues and
some real substantive content that a hearing might have* why
should anyone face up to a constitutional issue until you've
gone to* taken advantage of your administrative remedy* and if
you succeed you will be reinstated with back pay which is all
we could do for your client now.

In the preliminary hearing,

And the improper procedures are such that they

substance,
QUESTION:

But there is an element of mitigation

here, it seems to me, along the line of Justice White's
question.

Even if you are right about the constitutional

requirement of a

for now is, in effect, an award of two years’ back pay,
MRS, HIRSHMAN:
29 days.

Oh, no.

He was only suspended for

It is 29 days6 back pay.
QUESTION:

Well, did he go back to work?

MRS * HIRSHMAN:
QUESTION:

Okay,

Yes,
You are asking for 29 days’,

$1400 back pay, whereas, for all we know, if you had gone for
the post-suspension hearing you might have won and 15 days
after the suspension you might have been reinstated,
MRS. HIRSHMAN:
QUESTION:

No.

How do you know that isn't so?

40
MRS. HIRSHMAN:

There is nothing in the statute to

indicate that you could get a hearing, let alone a decision
within 3-5 days.
QUESTION:

Okay.

So the statute doesn't affirmatively

grant you the right, what about the procedures of the Civil
Service Commission?

Is there anything in the record that would

indicate their calendar was such you couldn't have been heard?
MRSo HIRSHMAN:
all, Your Honor.

There is nothing in the record at

We had several valid and serious constitu­

tional claims against the suspension which was being levied
against Respondent.

We were asking for immediate relief in the

form of a temporary restraining order.

It was our judgment at

that time and it is absolutely de jure of the record, and so
I really cannot speak to the tardiness of the Civil Service
Commission.
of immediacy.

You can see in the statute there is no guarantee
We went for temporary restraining order which

is the fastest kind of relief to get the man reinstated on the
grounds that his constitutional right had been violated.
Repeatedly this Court has ruled that 1983 does not
require exhaustion of administrative remedies, particularly
not where the administrative remedies are so inadequate, as they
are here.

QUESTION:

Is that for the future, that he might

get in trouble again?
MRS„ HIRSHMAN:

I would certainly not represent that

my client might get in trouble again, but, Your Honor, the
continued maintenance of the summary suspension procedures are
inherently capable of repetition but evasive of review because
they apply only to short suspensions and by the time you get
an appeal, particu3.arly to the Supreme Court, the suspension
time is over.

Any suspension of more than 30 days calls Into

play the protective procedures of the Illinois statute, so
that
QUESTION:

May I interrupt for just a minute, please,

Ma ’am?
You mentioned the fact that, in effect, the Illinois

42

statute allows suspension for up to 30 days without a hearing.
Let's assume the statute required a hearing if the suspension
exceeded five days, would that be valid, in your opinion?
MB&.. HlfSHMAM:
QUESTION:

Well, ~~ a prior hearing?

Yes.

No hearing at all, but if the

jsuspension were only for five days.
MRS. HIRSHMAN:

Well, I think that you run into a di»

dl minimis situation there.
QUESTION:

Five days would probably be all right?

MRS. HIK3HMAM:

There are suspensions or temporary

deprivations so short and so brief in their nature and effect
that you might have a de minimis situation in which case the due
process protections would not attach.

Now, this was a wage

earner, earning a fairly decent, living, so that you might think
that even a week's pay deprivation would be serious enough to
call the due process clause into play, but I think that you
could argue that five days was de minimis. Although in Goss v,
I,op eg, this Court held that 10 days was not de minimis»
You would have to draw the line at some very short
period, yes.

By selecting the 29 days for Lt. Muscare's sus--

pension, the Fire Department suspended him for the longest
possible time without affording him the statutory protections
available under Illinois law.

For suspensions of over 30 days,

tb.ere are substantially protective prior procedures, but -~
QUESTION:

Well, there has to be a dividing line

43
s omewhere ,
MRS, HIRSHMAN:

I don't mean to say that they weren't,

under the statute, entitled to do what they did.

However, they

have contended that their undertaking with regard to it. Muscare
was somehow done in great good faith and with the greatest of
tolerance.

And I think that the selection of 29 days which

has no calendar or any kind of inherent integrity to suspend
him^when any suspension of over 30 days would have called verydifferent procedures into play is an indication of their desire
to be as summary as possible with him at that time.
The really peculiar thing about it is that Chief
Morgan had, according to the record, told Acting Chief Fire
Marshall Foley about Lt, Muscare, something about him, we
don't know what, in December, and Chief Foley had determined
that he would not suspend Lt. Muscare in December.

Lt. Muscare

worked at his job fighting fires and wearing his mask,
according to his unrebutted testimony, without incident.
Two and one-half months later, Acting Chief Fire Marshall Foley
changed his mind and said, decided that he would suspend
Lt. Muscare.
QUESTION:

Is there a remote possibility that the

administration of the Fire Department is concerned that if they
let Muscare have a small moustache the next thing they will have
is a man who wants t
little bit longer?

little bit longer one and somebody else a
Isn't this a matter on which the

44
administration of an organization like this has to have some
regulations?
MRS. HIRSHMAN:

Well, Your Honor, it is our position

that this Court is not confronted with a Court of Appeals
ruling on the issue of the personal appearance rule,
QUESTION:

The —

Well, it has a good deal to do with the

matter of obeying orders, when he was ordered to dispense with
the beard, doesn't it?
MBS, HIRSHMAN:

Yes.

The Petitioner has argued that

the personal appearance rule is constitutional.

Throughout

these proceedings, they have contended that it is justified
by safety.
The amicus curiae have pointed out in their brief
that the safety justification simply is not supported by the
facts in the record, but in any case that the procedures used
in this case for this permanent public employee are so
arbitrary that they represent a level that is below even the
most rudimentary requirements of the due process clause, and
that they cannot be sustained.

Accordingly, we would ask that

this Court affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals of the
7th Circuit.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Hirshman, just before you sit down,

I hesitate to add to your problems, but I am having a problem.
In colloquy with my Brother Marshall, you explained
that the reason that you are here and the reason that you could

^5
get more relief here.than you could have in the administrative
proceedings was that this is a situation that is capable of
repetition and yet evading review.

Yet* as I understand it*

and* I think* as you told Mr. Justice Blackmun earlier* the rules
have now been changed and they have been changed in a way that
would, fully* as I understand it, fully satisfy your constitu­
tional claim, and there is no indication that they are going
to be changed back.
MBS. HIRSHMAN;

Well, there is.

In Petitioner’s reply

brief* they specifically represent that the rules were changed
only for purposes of complying with the 7th Circuit's decision
in this case last May* and that they couldn't say whether —
that they had done it specifically for that purpose* that they
were waiting for this Court to make a determination and that
they couldn't say whether or not they were going to change
them back.

So we have an indication from the very people that

were responsible for the change that they are seriously con­
sidering changing them back.
They specifically say in their brief on page 12,
reply brief on page 12, ,!At least until the issues ..raised had
been settled by this Court* this procedural change was adopted
as an interim measure.”
So we have that and* of course, we are making a
constitutional claim and we are asking for back pay and for
expungment of his file, and* you know* 42 USC 1983 does provide

46
that we are properly in the Federal court.
QUESTION:

Yes, I understand, but it is not every

case In which you have a change In the rules of the game that
fully satisfies your constitutional claim, as I understand it.
Am I correct about that?
MRS o HlfSHMAN:

We've only starting living with the

new rules —
QUESTION:

Had these rules been applied to your

client fs case you would be fully satisfied constitutionally,
would you not?
MRS o HIK3HMAN:

On the whole, although we never «—

again, you know, since we don't know what was involved, since
we got such an inadequate notice, we don't know what we would
have needed, because we never found out exactly what it was
that the Fire Department had in mind.
QUESTION:

But in any ease —

Just what in addition to these rules do

you claim the Constitution requiresthe new rules?
MRS» HIRSHMAN:
situation to another.

I think it varies from one fact

As I pointed out, there might be a

situation in which, for example, criminal conduct was alleged
in which the person might want to bring an alibi witness, or
something like that.

So I think that it really

as this

Court has so many times ruled,it should be flexible,
QUESTION:

That's not your case.

I think

There wasn't any

criminal conduct alleged and you didn't have any alibi --

47
MRS. HIRSHMAN:

I think that Lt. Muscare would have

faired just fine under these regulations.
QUESTION:

Your client.

He would have faii-ed — he

would have had everything that you are saying the Constitution
requires, would he not?
MRS o HIRSHMAN:

Insofar as I can judge from the

notice that I got.
QUESTION:

You are a careful lawyer.

You hedge every

answer, I'll say that.
QUESTION:

You still want some back pay, though?

MRS. HIK3HMAN:

Yes, I am asking for 29 days back pay

and for expungment of his record as this kind of thing, his
permanent Civil Service record, is very significant to him.
QUESTION;

You can get that from the Commission.

MRS, HIRSHMAN:
QUESTION:

Not necessarily.

I said you can.

MRS, HIRSHMAN:

They have the pother to issue those

remedies but we would be going on a substantive issue with
inadequate notice and bearing the burden of proof.
QUESTION:

Despite what my Brother Stewart said, we

agree that it is possible that they might, perhaps under some
circumstances unknown to you get relief?
MRS, HIRSHMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor,

Thank you.

MRS, HIRSHMAN;

Thank you, Your Honor.

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Mr, Quinlan?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J, QUINN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, QUINLAN:
like to note two things:

Just quickly, Your Honor, I would just
one, the reason for the 29 days is

observed on page 134 of the Abstract where the severity of the
sanction was given because of the fact this had occurred
before and he did not shave the beard off in the interim.
Page 105 of the Abstract indicates that Chief Fire
Marshall never Indicated that he would not take sanctions.
One other observation I would like to make is that
I think vie do have to have some minimal guides in terms of
standards of what due process requires when we are talking
about applying sanctions to some 40,000 employees in a city
the size of the City of Chicago,
Finally, for whatever it Is worth, on page 161 of
the Abstract, the Court of Appeals indicates that he was
warned that ha could not continue as a fire fighter,

I don't

think that whether he was actually warned he couldn't continue
as a fire fighter or not is of any real substantial dimension.
He was told he was to shave off his beard and the charges had
been filed.
Thank you, Your Honor,
QUESTION:

The second point, I gather, is that you

49
agree with your adversary counsel that this ease is here for
decision and should be decided.
MR. QUINLAN:

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

What we are saying Is

There is nothing moot about it.

MR, QUINLAN:

«- if vte continue the rules it would

be a matter of employer «employee relations,
they are of constitutional dimension.

We are not saying,

We did have those two

court decisions which required us to do something in the interim.
MR, CHIEP JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, counsel.

The case is submitted,
{Whereupon, at 11:16 o’clock, a*m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
