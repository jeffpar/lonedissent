MR„ CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 74-773, Hudgens against the National Labor Relations
Board.
Mr. Cohen, you may proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE M. COHEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. COHEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
The question that we have in this case is whan in a
case arising under the National Labor Relations Act do non­
employees have the right to picket on private property, in this
case the private property of a modern shopping center.
To resolve this question, four decisions of this
Court must be reconciled.

Vie have, first of all, the Babcock &

Wilcox decision of the Court in 1956, which was a case arising
under the National Labor Relations Act and held that nonemployees do not have a right to come on private property to
engage in organizational activities except where there are no
other reasonable alternatives available.
The second case is a Constitutional case arising
under the First Amendment, the Logan Valley case in 1968.

In

that case this Court held that a union may picket on the
private property of a shopping center where the center is the
functional equivalent of public property, where the picketing

4
is directly related to the use to which the center is being pit,
and where there are no other reasonable alternatives or oppor­
tunities for the pickets to convey their message to the intended
audience.
The third case that has to be reconciled--two cases
actually—they were decided at the same day in 1972.

First,

the Lloyd case, which also arose under the First Amendment, not
the Labor Act, where the Court held that Vietnam protesters
could not enter upon the private property of a shopping center
to handbill because the handbills were not related to the
functions of the center, there were other alternatives
\

available, and the center was not the functional equivalent of
public property.
Finally, decided the same day as Lloyd, there was tie
Central Hardware v. Labor Board case, which arose under the
Act, not the Constitution, as does this case, in which this
Court held that non-employees, organisers, on the parking lot
of a large retail store were subject to the Babcock & Wilcox
test, that they had no right of entry unless there was an
absence of other reasonable alternatives.
In this case we have a situation like Babcock, like
Central Hardware, that arises under the National Labor Relations
Act, not the Constitution.
Q
arise under the

Mr. Cohen, let me ask you, why does this case
National Labor Relations Act?

Your client,

5

tha petitioner, did not employ any of these people»

They had

no dispute whatever with him»
MR» COHEN:
Q

That is correct»

Why does it then arise under the National Labor

Relations Act?
MR, COHEN;

Because the union representing the

pickets involved filed a charge against Hudgens, the owner of
the center? and under tha Labor Act any employer can be subject
to a charge»

The Board found that the employer's conduct--thet

Hudgens being an employer, not necessarily the employer of the
pickets but nevertheless being an employer, had committed a
violation of Section 8(a)(1) by excluding the pickets and that
that conduct interfered with the pickets' right for selforganization guaranteed by Section 7 of the Act and therefore
was a violation of the Act»
Q

Would the Board’s reasoning carry over so far

that if you did not have a shopping center but had a simple
street and your client had a place on one side of the street
with a parking lot and another business had a place across the
street without a parking lot and the employees across the street
wanted, to organise that place but they could not find any
access, so they said your client’s parking lot was the nearest
place they could make contact-—do you think that the Board
would say that your client, even though he had no connection
whatever with either the employer or the employees that were ii

6
the dispute would have violated the act?
MR. COHEN;

1 think the position that the union has

taken in this case would support that reasoning.
Q

Do you agree with it?

MR„ COHEN:
Q

No , I do not.

So, what would the Board say?

MR. COHEN;

The Board would take the position, as I

understand it, it depends in the Board's mind really on the
type of property that is involved.

The Board says the dis­

tinguishing feature in this case-Q

The argument would not be that your client, in

Justice Rehnquist's example, was not subject to the Act.
MR. COHEN:
Q

No.

They would say of course he is subject to the

Act.
MR. COHEN;

That is correct.

That is correct.

And

if my client, to use Justice Rehnquist's example, had a large
shopping center, then the Board would make the identical
argument it was making here today.
Q

But what argument would it make in the example

I gave you where it was simply an entirely independeng business
premise across the street v/ith a parking lot?
MR. COHEN:

They would take tbs position that if this

were a large shopping center, quasi-public property, that the
pickets would have a right to come onto that property because

7
that would be the best location,, if you will, where the pickets
could engage in their conduct unless there was some other
reasonably attractive public place.

If there was a nearest

quasi-public place, the pickets would have a right to picket
there even if it was an employer of some other business.
Q

That sounds like an amalgamation of the First

Amendment and the National-MR. COHEN;
Q

That is what the Board has got here.

But you said that you did not think the Board

would hold the employer as having committed an unfair labor
practice in Justice Rehnquist's example, that they would say,
"Sure, you are an employer, but you just have not violated the;
act.
MR. COHEN;

As I understand the Board's argument, it.

turns on—
Q

They would say he is an employer, nevertheless.

MR. COHEN;

That is correct.

And the? Board says that

the difference between the Central Hardware case and this case
is the type of property that is involved.

If you have what the

Board says is quasi-public property, property that is the
functional equivalent of municipal property and they would put
any large shopping center in that category, then according to
the Board, you do not have a Section 7 case, you have a
Constitutional case.

And if you have a Constitutional case,

you first look to whether there is a direct relationship

8

involved.

And, second, you look to whether there is some public

site available.

If there is no public site available and there

is a direct relationship, then the pickets have a right to cone
onto the property.
The. case turned, in other words, on whether you have
a large shopping center such as we have here, or whether you
have a small shopping center as the Board had in the Nichols
case or a single standing store such as Central Hardware.

In

those cases the Board says you do not have quasi-public
property and there is no right to come on unless you can meet
the Babcock £ Wilcox burden, which is essentially our position.
The union takes the opposite point of view.
union says, "We agree with you.

It is not a question here of

whether you have a large center or a small center.
the Constitution does not apply."
in agreement.

The

In any casa,

So far w@ and the union are

Where the union parts company it says that

Babcock only applies to organizational cases; Central. Hardware
only applies to organizational cases.

Where you have picketing,

the pickets have an absolute right to come on as long as they
are

engaged in peaceful primary picket.

That is the union’s

position.
Q

Wherever they picket.

MR. COHEN:

Wherever they picket, as long as they are

in primary picketing, as I understand it.
Q

And on whosever property?

9
MR. COHEN:

On whosever property it is.

There is an

absolute right, according to the union, as I read their brief,
to always engage in peaceful primary picketing, even if it is on
private property.
Q

What case do they cite for that?

MR. COHEN:

They cite for that the Steelworkers case

which involves Section 8(b)(4) question of where a union was
picketing on the private property of a railroad company to
appeal to the railroad's csmployees.

That was a violation of

Section 8(b) (4) as a secondary boycott.

This Court held it i^as

not a secondary boycott.
Q

That was a common situs?

MR. COHEN:

That was a common situs, yes.

Let me briefly cite the facts in this case in respect
of these different arguments 1 have been discussing, and the
facts are generally not in dispute.
Scott Hudgens owns and operates what is called the
North DaKalb Shopping Center located in a
area of Atlanta.

At each entrance there is a public right of way,

and there is undisputed testimony in the record that pickets
could have picketed on that right of way safely and with their
picket signs legible to anyone passing by.

And it is at page

141 of the appendix.
After you enter the center, you cross a large parking
lot and then reach an enclosed mall building.

There is a ten-

foot. wide sidewalk surrounding the mall building and four
entrances into the main mall building from the sidewalk.
Eighty-five to ninety percent of the customers of the tenant
stores use one of those four entrances.

There are also some

There is piped, in music, benches, fountains,

drinking fountains, temperature controls, carousel for children.
The center has regulations, dress regulations, parking
regulations, security regulations which it enforces.

The center

is closed at certain times of the day to anybody coming through.
There is also a long established and uniformly
enforced policy that no one has disputed here forbidding any
commercial activity on the mall except at least small booths,
kiosks, which are leased out and handled like any other tenant
store.
In fact, the center here involved wag before this
Court in a case in 1974 called Steffel v. Thompson, which

11
involved the center's exclusion of Vietnam War protesters»

It .

came up on a procedural question rather than on the merits,
but that was the identical center and the identical policy we
have here today»

And then the pickets were inside approximately 15

Q

I gather that the only chance that the customers

headed for the Butler store would have seen those signs-MR. COIIEN:

If the picketing were put out on the

right of way, yes, they would have been 500 feet away.

Customers

would have seen them as they entered the shopping center.
Q

So, it would not have been as effective

MR. COIIEN:
correct.

Certainly in the union's opinion that is

The union would say it was diluted because of the

distance involved.
Q

Would you doubt that?

MR. COIIEN:

No, I would not.

The Board found a violation here, and after* the case
then went to the Fifth Circuit, there was a remand as a result
of Central Hardware and Lloyd.

The Board heard the case again

13
found another violation but on a different theory altogether,
which I'll discuss, and then the case was in turn appealed to
the Fifth Circuit which enforced the Board’s order but on a
third theory altogether.
So, let me turn, if 1 could, to the different
theories that have been advanced to this Court, and there are
four or five of them, and try to explain where I think the
parties differ.
First, there is the position of the Board in its
initial decision, which is really advocated here today, and adds
to the Constitutional test.

What the Board says is that where

you have a large shopping center, quasi-public property, then
Central Hardware and Babcock are irrelevant.

But those cases

only apply when you have a'single standing store or something
that is not a functional equivalent.
Where you have a large shopping center, then you apply
a Constitutional test.

And under the Board's Constitutional

test it differs from the statutory test.

The Constitutional

test as the Board would apply it is say, "First, do you have <
direct relationship?"

And they would answer that by saying y«s,

because the picketing is at Butler.
And, second, if you do have a direct relationship,
then the burden is on the employer, not on the union as it would
be under Babcock, the statutory test, but it is on the employer
to show that there is no public place, not just a reasonable

14
alternative but public place, for the union engaged in its
picketing»

If the employer cannot show that, then the union

has a right to picket on the shopping center if it is a large
quasi-public piece of property»
Second, there is the approach—this is a different
approach--that the union argues»

As I said, they agree with vs

that their Constitutional test has no bearing here»

But they

would say that Central Hardware and Babcock apply only to
organizational situations, that where you are dealing with a
picketing situation, a primary picketing situation, then the
union has an absolute right to come onto private property
engaged in peaceful primary picketing»
This position has not been accepted by the Board»
It was rejected in both this case and the Nichols case, and it
was also rejected by the Third Circuit in the Peddis Building
case, which involved picketing on industrial power»
There is the position of the Court of Appeals, which is
really a blend of these two tests and was urged in this Court
by the araicus Chamber of Commerce»

What the Court of Appeals

said was that neither the statutory test nor the Constitutional
test provide the answer, and we need something in between»

So,

they agreed, except that there ought to be a test of direct
relationship, and they agreed there ought to be a test of
alternatives, but it was not clear whether they were applying
the test of alternatives the Board proposes or the test of

15
alternatives of Babcock..

In any case, what they said was

alternatives were met here because there was no real alternative
to picketing inside the mall»
Q

Do you think they upheld the Board?

Q

Yes, they did.

On a ground you think that the Board used or not?

I think that this is assuming an effect: ve

But we have not

argued that here because we think that the test that the Court
of Appeals proposed was the wrong test too.
Q

Would not Cherry require that it go back to the

Board?
MR. COHEN:

I think that if the Court of Appeals ha£

said the Board has advanced the wrong test and if the new test-—
none of the parties has argued, the Board, the union and us did
not argue it.

It was proposed only by an amicus.

And the

16

proper resolution would have been to send it back to the Board
to apply that test, yes.
Q

But that is even assuming that the Court of

Appeals was right in its theory.
MR. COHEN:
Q

That is correct, which we do not agree.

And the reason you do not argue Chenery is you

say the Court of Appeals was wrong.
MR. COHEN:

That is why we are here today, and that

is why we have argued—

Q

That is correct.

The old-fashioned kind of company town.

What if

you had a company town here, a Marsh v. Alabama; would you think
this was not a Constitutional case?
MR- COHEN:

I would say if the case arose under the

Constitution and you had a company town, then you would have
a different result altogether.
Q

No, the company town and the company was the

employer like Marsh v„ Alabama.
MR- COHEN:

Then I think what you have is you apply

a Babcock test, but you find no alternative.

The Second Circuit got the

case and said in that situation the employees had never left
Grossinger's, they never have a chance to go out and see anybody
else, they are isolated there; there is no real alternative to
the union to coming onto the private property to organise.
we say the same thing would be true of picketing.

And

There is no

real alternative.
Q

And it would still be no more than a statutory

case, in your view?

MR. COHEN:

But the statutory test and the Constitu­

tional test would yield the same results. I say you apply a
*!
statutory test, yes. But the statutory test and the

18

Constitutional test would both determine in that situation there
is no alternative»

So, the union would have a right to picket

or engage in organizational activity.
Q

Could not the test for an unfair labor practice

be different from a Constitutional violation?
MR. COHEN:
Q

Yes, it is.

That is what I thoughtyou were arguing.

MR. COHEN:
the same result.

The test is different but it would yield

The test under the Constitution asks for a

direct relationship and it imposes alternatives.

I say that

the Board is arguing that the alternative test is different
from the statutory test.

We do not necessarily agree with that.

We think the test of alternatives under the statute is not any
different from the test of alternatives which is implied in
Lloyd

and. implied in Logan Valley.

There is not a more

stringent test that the Board proposes.

But we do not have to

reach that question because in our view what you are dealing
with is strictly a statutory test as long as the union has
filed charges under the Labor Act.
Q

If you have a pure company town situation, the

hypothesis is that the company is the equivalent of government.
MR. COHEN:
Q

That is correct.

That is the theoretical underpinning of Marsh v.

Alabama, and then there is no more room for alternatives, is
there?

There might be room for time and place regulation, but

19

beyond -chat there is no room for anything.
MR,, COHEN:

In a First Amendment case, that is

This Court said in Central Hardware the Labor Act may be

In that situation, the Labor Act gives

you the same protection, except it is an unfair labor practice
because under

that situation there is no alternative if you

cannot meet the Babcock & Wilcox test.

So, you end up with tha

same result.
Q

In your position, Mr. Cohen, how do you reason

through under Idle statutory language how this is an unfair
labor practice where the employer does not employee any of
these people and the dispute is basically between one of his
tenants?
MR. COHEN:

I do not differ with the Board in the

proposition that an employer—*that someone besides an employer
or tiie individuals involved could violate the law.

I mean,

has held—let us say that someone who comes and pickets another

He is not employed by the

That is an unfair labor practice.

20

1 would not part with the Board as far as the
employer involved here.

I think it is a stronger case for us

the fact that you do not have—-that Hudgens is involved.
I do not think that is what it turns on.

But

What it turns on

under the statute is whether there has been an interference
with employee rights.

And there is not an interference with

employe® rights if the employees have other alternatives
available.

Then you look to the employer's property rights.
Q

And you are going to get to what you think those

are in this case, I guess.
MR. COHEW:

Yes.

Yes, 1 am.

I wanted to first cover,

if I could, briefly why we think the Board's position and the
Union's position are wrong, why we think that either a test of
quasi-public property as opposed to purely private property,
which is the Board's approach, or picketing as opposed to
organisational rights-—neither of those provides a proper
dichotomy for resolving this dispute.
The Board's position we think is wrong mostly
because it would give you an illogical situation.

You v/ould

have someone who had a large private store like Central
Hardware, someone who had a small shopping center like the
Board had in the Nichols case, a discount store, an industrial
park-all of those employers would have one rule, and someone
who was in a large shopping center such

as Lloyd or Logan

Valley presumably or DeKalb Center here would have a different

21
rule, that you would have one rule for large centers and one
rule for small centers.
intended.

That is not what we think the Act.

There is not any demarcation in the Act that one

type of employer would ba able to insulate himself from the
same activities that the other employer would be subjected.
If there is anything to be learned from law, it is
that size, openness, in cluster with other stores in a modern
shopping center do not make the difference.
what this Court said in Lloyd.

This is exactly

That the fact that an employe::

may choose one particular place for his retail business, one
citus, and be a larger store than some other store, that is not
what determines Constitutional rights and it is not what
determines rights under the Act.
In addition, in our view, Central Hardware did not
restrict itself only to certain types of locations.

The

difference between Logan Valley and Central Hardware was that
Logan Valley was not a Section 7 case—Logan Valley was a
Section 7 case.

And that would apply equally well to large

shopping centers as well as small.
Q

Logan Valley was not a Section 7 case.

MR. COHEN:

Logan Valley was not a Section 7 case?

Logan Valley was a Constitutional case.
Q

And did not even involve a labor dispute--yes,

it did.
MR. COHEN:

Yes, it did.

22
' Q

Yes, it did.

MR. COHEN;
Q

It. was Tanner that did not involve a labor—

MR. COHEN:
Q

It involved labor picketing.

That is correct.

But you are not very much interested in having

this Court say there was not any violation of the act here
because under the act you can only commit an unfair labor
practice in these circumstances if so and so, and that these
facts do not amount to unfair labor practice.

But, nevertheless,

if you wanted to, you could go into court and get relief unde*
the First Amendment <
Q

It would be a Pyrrhic victory.

MR. COHEN;
Q

Of course.

You would not like that very much, I do not

suppose.
MR. COHEN;
Q

Of course.

You want us in effect to decide both questions

here.
MR. COHEN:

I have not asked that because it is really

not before the Court in this case.
Q

The Board thought it was.

It equated^what it

thought was a Constitutional question.
MR. COHEN:
me say this.
Q

And I think that is where it erred.

Let

I think—
But you would be very happy, I suppose, if the

23
Court said the Board misunderstood the Constitutional test; the
Constitutional test is narrower than the Board thought; it was,
and it is no broader than the
MR» COHEN;

Labor Act test.»

Then 1 think you would reach the result I

wish»
Q

That is what I say; you would be happy then»

MR. COHEN;

That is correct.

Let me just say that on the Constitutional argument,
because this is one of the arguments the Board advances, you
cannot have a different test under the Constitution than you
would under the statute.

So, therefore, the test that we apply
/

under the statute has got to be the same as the Constitutional
test; it has got to be the narrower test because otherwise you
would have conflict.
I think the first question you have is, Can the state
courts have any jurisdiction at all in this area?
question this Court has never answered.

That is a

You may never have a

Constitutional case like Logan Valley if in fact the state
courts are preempted.
Q

Logan Valley carae up from a state court.

MR. COHEN:

But Logan Valley did not meet the

preemption question because it had not been presented in
court below.

the

So, the only Justice who met it was Mr. Justice

Harlan, who said that he felt it was preempted.

If. came up again

in the Taggart case and again the Court did not answer the

24
question because they found that the writ had been properly
granted, although there was a separate opinion by the Chief
Justice and a separate opinion by Mr. Justice Harlan again on
the preemption question.
The Georgia Supreme Court in this case has said tha-:
they were preempted.

They could not give a declaratory

judgment, and that is the question that is before this Court
on a separate petition for cert.

It has not been ruled on,

But there is, first of all, a question we have as to
whether the state courts are preempted and, even if they are,
whether you have a conflict.
0

Is there tny way this particular employer coulc

ever get before the Board?
MR. COHEN:
Q

No.

Ke could not possibly ever find out whether the

behavior is protected or prohibited?
MR. COHEN;

That is why that area may not be preempted,

as you said in Ariadne, Mr. Justice White, and as the Chief
Justice said on Taggart, because it may be a no-law area.

So

that if you have a conflict, we would say, because if you want to
avoid a no-law area, that may just be the price to pay for
having a—in order to provide a remedy for a wrong.
Let me turn, if I could, quickly to the union’s
argument and then to why we think the Babcock test is met.
The right to picket we submit is—even primary

25
picketing, even for a peaceful purpose—is not an absolute
right.

That right has been restricted by th® Act; it has been

restricted by state law under certain circumstances?

the union

does not have an absolute right to engage in primary picketing.
It has a right only if it meets other conflicting purposes and
competing purposes under the Act.
The union's argument that it would have an absolute
right to appropriate private property to picket whenever it
does would also lead to illogical results.

It means the union

could come onto private property and picket to obtain recogni­
tion , to give an illustration; but it could not come onto that
same private property to sign up people on authorisation cards
to hold a board election.
So, xvhat you would have is a case where a union could
proceed to coerce an employer by recognitional picketing as it
would have under the unionis view an absolute right to do so,
but could not come onto the property to proceed to obtain a
board election, which is the preferred course of conduct as
this Court said in Linden, this Court said in Gissel Packing.
Taking their point of view,which is what we contend,
then w® think the question really is, Has the union exhausted
any other alternatives to communicating its message besides
picketing?—that that has got to be approached like Babcock &
Wilcox.

Those alternatives here-—and there was no evidence put

on that the union even tried any alternative.

The only evidence

26
that was put on "was by us as to what alternatives had been used
by the shopping center to bring people into the center to conduct
business with Butler and the other tenants.,

They consisted of

newspaper, radio, television, all the different techniques that
the Board apd the Courts of Appeals have applied and said are
alternatives, to communicating with emplcySsKs»
For example

'Central Hardware -.when that case was

remanded back to the Board, one of the things they looked to-—
I mean, remanded to the CkftSaefclof Appeals—-was had the union
tried newspapers, had it tried' radio and television, to just
appeal to those employees who worked at the Central Hardware
store»

If that is an effective alternative to appeal to the

people working at the Central Hardware Store, it is also an
effective alternative to reaching the potential customers of the
Butler store.

The Butler store in fact is a larger audience.

So, if it is effective to reach a small group, why is it not
effective for reaching a larger group?

No one has ever answered

that question.
No one has answered the question of v/hy the union
could not have picketed on the right of way here.

There was a

question asked of a witness, page 141 of the record, "Could the
union safely picket on the right of way?”
The witness says, ’’Absolutely„"
"Could someone read the picket signs?"
He said, "Easily"—-narrowly but in the record, and

27
yet everyone said that is just not a correct place because it
is too far away»
Q

Do you think you might run into secondary

problems?
MR. COHEN;

No* I do not, and I think that this is a

specter—
Q

It sounds like you were ready for that question.

MR. COHEN;
in the case.

Yes, because

I think this is a red herring

Everyone kept saying if you picket in a common

place where there are many tenants, you are always going to
have secondary problems.
One of the interesting cases on that that just came
up was the Wire Service case.
Q

Where you would—

MR. COHEN;

But you have more drydock.

You have

Q

I would think your client would complain more

about consumer picketing at the entrance to the entire shoppirg
center than picketing a single employer's establishment.
MR. COHEN:

My client would not but many clients

would, and I think the illustrative case is the Wire Service
case, I was saying.
Q

There you had a tenant of a large building—

Every tenant in the shopping center would be on

the pickets' backs then, I suppose, because they are interfering
with everybody's business.

28
MR* COHENe

But it would not be as disruptive as

picketing on the enclosed 30~foot wide island.
Q

,

What do you mean "disruptive”?

MR* COHEN;

It would not cause we think as much loss

of potential business, if you will.
Q

But it is only causing the potential loss of

business in one store.
MR, COHEN;
Q
so disruptive?

Let us assume it is.

Then how do you aay that is

It certainly disrupts one store.

MR. COHEN;
that

Well, that may be.

It disrupts one store.

almost an extension of the store itself.

It is

There it is more

disruptive, we believe, than it would be picketing on a public
right of way.
Q

We cannot restrict the public right of way.
Is part of your case that this picketing was net

related to the purposes of the shopping center?
MR. COHEM:

That is not part of our case.

It has been

advanced by some of the parties; we have not really contended it.

Do you concede it or not?

We have said that is not really relevant.

I have not argued it is connected because

The Chamber has argued

here as an amicus on our side that it is not connected because
it arose at a different place than where the pickets are.

And

if you say anything that is directed at a customer at a
shopping center,, any consumer picketing at a shopping center,
at a store, is related, then everything is related.

I am not arguing that, yes.

That issue is certainly in the Constitutional

Correct.

For Constitutional purposes, would this be

MR. COHEN:

Chamber has adopted, that if there is a directly-related test,
it may not have been met here.

But I would not argue it with

the same vigor that they have argued it because I think it is a
position that we do not have to really urge in our situation.

Q

Let me just ask you about that inquiry on

picketing at the highway.

If

I understood you correctly, you

said that they could get their message across by picketing
outside where they entered front the main highway.
MR. COHEN:
Q

Yes.

Might they not run into the local police

department who might say that that presented traffic hazards
with cars slowing down and people slowing down to try to read
signs?
MR. COHEN:

I presume that is a possibility..

fir.-.t of all, it was never tried here; we do not know.

But,
And the

testimony in the record is that there was a sufficient public
place for the pickets to stand with their picket signs that
would not have caused any traffic hazards.
Q

Maybe I misunderstood the facts, Mr. Cohen, but

I thought you said the public right of way was off the public
highway»
MR. COHEM:

It was off the public highway; that is

correct.

Do you suggest also that for consumer picketing

Yes.

This
They

say, "Well, look, that would be expensive or be less convenient

But their test is not whether

you have a most effective area, the most convenient area, the
most reasonable place.

It is a question of whether you have

any other reasonable alternative, and here there were other
reasonable alternatives, just like there was for communicating
organizing- purposes to the employees.
Q

Then expense has nothing to do with reasonableness

of the alternatives?
MR. COHEN:

Oh, sure.

If it turned out here that the

expense was so prohibitive: that the union could not possibly

We put on an expert

witness in this case, a friend who was well versed in adver­
tising, and he said that if I had so many dollars to spend,
bow much I would pay for hypothetical pickets, to reach nine
stores in the Atlanta area, which is really picketed, that radio,
television, mailing, newspapers, all of these were both more
effective and less costly.

So, the evidence hare is that it

was a reasonable alternative.
Q

Do you think the Board conceded

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COME

ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT NLRB
MR. COMEs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please fchs

Court:
/

The principle of Babcock, as we see it, is that in
striking a balance between property rights and employee rights
for purposes of the National Labor Relations Act, accommodation
between the two must be obtained with as little destruction c f
one as is consistent with the maintenance of the other.
As applied to the facts of Babcock, which involve
non-employee union representatives seeking access to wholly
private property to solicit employees to join the union, the
Court concluded that non-employees could be excluded except
where it could be shown that there wore no other reasonable
means of reaching the employees.
We submit that the facts of this case are different
and therefore the accommodation for purposes of the National
Labor Relations Act could properly be different.

The property

34

is not wholly private but has assumed, as this Court used the
phrase in Central Hardware, some significant degree of functional
attributes of public property devoted to public use»
Secondly, access is sought by employees and their
purpose is not to solicit for union membership but to appeal
through peaceful picketing to customers of their employer's
retail store to withhold patronage from that store in support of
a lav/ful economic strike they have against-their employer»
Q

Mr» Come--

MR» COME:

Yes., Your Honor.

--what if instead of the shopping center situation

Why, for purposes of the Act as opposed to the

35
MR. COME:

First of all, 1 think that for purposes of

the Act in the situation that yon are positing, unlike here
where you have a closer interrelationship between the shopping
center owner

and the store owner, this was not explored in

this case because the parties stipulated that Hudgens was an
employer and that was as far as the matter went.
Q

In my hypothesis both employers would be

employers under the Act.
MR. COME;

However, if it were necessary to dispose

of this case, findings could have been made that Hudgens, xn
view of the relationship to Butler, not only brought Butler
onto this center but, in terras of the lease, the rent that
Hudgens was paid was dependent upon the revenue of the Butler
store.

It could be found that Hudgens was acting as an agent

of Eutler; under the statutory definition of employer under the
Act, it includes anyone who is acting as an agent of an employer
either directly or indirectly.
Q
agent

Ilow could you find that Hudgens was acting as an

of Butler unless Butler told Hudgens in effect, !!Get o:t

there and stop those pickets"?
MR. COME:

The Act also has a very liberal definition

of agency vrhich says that the mere fact that there has not be-sn
any specific direction or authorisation is not controlling.
think that you could have found apparent authority or at
least ratification of the acts of Hudgens.

1

36

All I want to point out is that I think that the two
situations, the hypothetical and this case, are factually
distinguishable, and in an appropriate case I would feel
confident that the Board would draw the distinction that 1 am
drawing.
Turning to the factors that I have mentioned at the
outset, first of all, this is a situation where Hudgens’
property interest is substantially attenfcuated.

The shopping

center is the kind of property to which the First Amendment
would accord a broad right of access.
Q

There are two factors, as I understand it.

First

of all, two factors distinguish this from Babcock & Wilcox.
First, that this was quasi-public property.
MR. COME:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Secondly, that this was not organizational

picketing but rather consumer picketing.
MR. COME:
Q

By employees.

MR. COME:
Q

That is correct, by employees.
Those two factors--

Yes, Your Honor.

But for the moment, that

MR. COME:

The logic of that would lead to that

conclusion.
Q

That is e in the light of present Board rule.

MR. COME:

Yes.

However, I must point out that this

is a situation where the Board perhaps more than usual is
feeling its way because its view of this has had to be

38
refocused considerably in the light of this Court’s decision
in Central Hardware and in Lloyd, which are only about three
years away.
Q

Mr. Corae, pursuing the discussion that you and

Mr. Justice Stewart have been having, assume in this case
that there were no union agreement between the union and the
employer with respect to the warehouse employees.

And assume

further that the union was attempting to organize the warehouse
employees.

Would your position be the same with respect to

picketing at the shopping center of one of the retail outlets
of this employer?
MR. COME;
Q

Yes, I think it would be.

Is that compatible with your responses to

Mr. Justice Stewart?
MR. COME;

Yes, I think it was.

As I understood his;

question, he gave me the situation where it was purely private
property and not quasi-public.

I think that on quasi-publie

a Constitutional test is very, very relevant to determining the
proper balance for Section 7 purposes.

There may be situations

and I think Central Hardware and Babcock show the situation—
where Section 7 may give broader rights than the Constitution
would provide.

But I submit that it is not reasonable! to say

that Section 7 would ever accord less protection than the
Constitution would afford, given an employer-employee relation­
ship .

39
Q

Mr. Come, just one more question before we leave

this line of thinking;

As I understand your position, it does

not matter whether the activity at the warehouse was organiza­
tional activity or a dispute as to wages and working conditions
where a union already had a contract.
MR. COME:

No, I do not think so, Your Honor,

would say yes, I do not think it makes a difference.

I

I think

Logan Valley shows you that because in Logan Valley it was
straight organizational.

I mean, the union did not represent

anybody in the store, the vandalized market.
Q

But, nonetheless—

Right, but that was one sit® where the

organization was directed against the employees of the store.
Here you have an organizational effort at one location.

Suppose

the organizational effort had been in Seattle, Washington, the
same employer.

Could the union have posted pickets in front

of a store in Atlanta, Georgia with respect to which there war,
no union organization activity in a shopping center?
MR. COME;

As I understand the scope of. the protect:, on

for mutual aid and -the protection that Section 7 gives, fellow
employees have a right te appeal to-“employees in one segment
have a right to appeal to their fellow employees working at
other places of the same employer.

however, and I do not think that we have to answer the case ol

They can

What are the rules of the Board with respect to that?

Is thet

a Babcock test?
MR. COME:

I do not think that it is a Babcock test ,

and I think you have to make an accommodation-Q

Let us assume there is a gate into the parking

lot on the public street and the employees co-id just as well
picket on the public street, but they say, "No, it is much mere
effective if we come right into the back door," on the
employer’s parking lot.
MR. COME:

What is the Board rule there?

The reason I am hesitating is that I do

not know of a case that exactly presents that situation.

The

only ones that I am familiar with are situations where there is
either a public sidewalk where you can picket or there is not-Q

Mr. Come, we are familiar with shopping around

here with the Sears Roebuck and Lord and Taylor setups where

41
you have to go up ramps to park, and most people, I gather,
most customers, enter those two stores from the parking lots
which are elevated a couple of stories above the street.
MR, COME:

It would depend upon, as it is here,

whether or not there is a wholly public area where that
activity can be reasonably carried on.
Q

You must know those stores; on Wisconsin Avenue

the entrance to Sears Roebuck, you go up these ramps and there
are large parking lots in back, and you go in the back way.
MR. COME:

I would say in that sort of situation you

would probably find that the public places would afford an
adequate opportunity.

they do or do not.
Q

I do not care about the answer.

What would be the test, the standard?

You

say it is not a Babcock test?
MR. COME:

In that situation it would be the Babcocl

test because that is not quasi-public property.

That is

private property.
Q

So, you do say then even though it is the

employer's own employees picketing, that they may not use his
property to picket him and consumer picket except in conformity
with Babcock.

If under Babcock they have other reasonable ws) s

the question is also whether there is an alternative public

I think it t.oes

engaging in.

But I do not think that that is this case,

because here we have quasi-public property and Lloyd, we submit,
makes it clear that the Constitution would have given these
employees the right to engage

in peaceful picketing at the

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Corae, I think you have

some time left.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COME, ESQ.
MR. COME:

[Resuming]

Petitioner’s counsel in response to a

question from Justice Stewart indicated that there could well
be congruence between the Constitution and the statute if this
were a pure company town such as we had in Marsh v. Alabama.
We submit that there is no logical reason why there cannot
be such congruence when we have quasi-public property.

The

difference is, as this Court pointed out in Lloyd, that where
you have quasi-public property, you have to satisfy two
conditions.
One, you have to show that the activity is directly
related in its purpose to the use of the shopping center and
there was no other reasonable opportunity for the pickets to
convey their message to their intended audience.

If this wars

a pur© company town, you would not have to meet those tests.
Let us show how those tests were met on the facts
here.

Although the underlying contract dispute involved

Butler's warehouse employees, they were engaging in what woull
normally be privileged as legitimate primary activity in
carrying their dispute to their employer's retail store and
seeking the aid of their fellow employees working there and o:
the store's customers.

44
To be sure, Hudgens

owned title to the property

but, as this Court recognised in Steelworkers, the fact that
title may reside in a third party does not necessarily impair
tine legitimacy of otherwise primary activity.
Q

That was a much different fact situation from

this though.
MR. COME:

That is true.

But in a sense though it

was a mor© difficult case in that it was purely private
property.

It was the Carrier plant and it was the railroad

entrance to that plant which serviced other plants.
property owned by the railroad.

It was cn

Here we have quasi-publie

property.
Q

What makes you think this is quasi-publie?

MR. COME:

It is quasi-publie because in all material

respects it is like the shopping center in Logan Valley.
Q

How much of Logan Valley do you think is left

after the Lloyd case?
MR. COME:

I think that quite a bit of it is left.

It has been narrowed but only in the sense you have to meet the
two conditions of relatedness and the showing that there was no
other adequate opportunity for conveying the pickets' message.
I think that 'the Court, when you read Central Hardware and
Tanner together, draws the distinction that I am drawing
between purely private property and a shopping center such as
vie have here, in Lloyd, and in Log mi Valley.

45
The store picketing was directly related to the use
of this shopping center in that th© center was designed to
attract customers to the stores, and the principal purpose of
the pickets was to induce customers to withhold their patronage
from the Butler store pending their resolution on the discputa
with Butler which Butler, as

the employer of both of these

employees, the warehouse and -the retail stores, was in a position
to resolvec
In Lloyd, by contrast, the message on the handbills
which protested the Vietnam wax' was, as the Court pointed out,
directed to all members of the public, not solely to the
patrons of Lloyd's center or any of its operations.

Respond­

ents could have distributed these handbills on any public
street or any public sidewalk, in any public park or in any
public building in the city of Portland.

That is not the

situation we have here.
We have a relatedness that would satisfy the Lloyd
and the Logan

Valley tests.

Secondly, picketing

sit the entrances to the Butler

stores afforded the only reasonable means of conveying the
pickets5 message to their intended audience.

As the court

below pointed out, this is not an organisational campaign where
it is oftentimes relatively easy to find out who the employees
are and appeal to them at their homes.

We are appealing here

to the patrons of Butler stores whose identity is not readily

federal court or you brought a charge before the Labor Board,
and I submit that that would foe—
Q
that way?

What if the Constitutional right were measured
What if that were the Constitutional rule, that

property rights need not give way to picketing if there are
other reasonable means of getting the message across?
that were the Constitutional rule?

What 1:

Would you suggest Section 7

ought to go farther?
MR. COME:

I think that would

be a question as to

whether the Board would be right if it were to extend it
farther.

Section 7 can go further than the Constitution.

And

I respectfully submit that it is not reasonable to say that I;
goes less than the Constitution would go, particularly in the
situation here v/her® you have

the basic rights that Section f

seeks to protect, the right to engage in peaceful strike and
peaceful picketing in support of that right.

Section 7 and the

48

Board’s procedures were uniquely designed to deal with that
problem, and to fore® employees to go to the Federal Court and
to seek vindication under the Constitution would put the law
back to where it was before the Wagner Act was enacted.
Q

But the Constitution does not get you anywhere

except against governmental action.
MR. COME:
Q

That is correct, but—

Until or unless Mr. Hudgens here can be equated

with government, there are no rights at all under the Consti­
tution .
MR. COME:
Q

That is correct and that—

Until or unless Mr. Hudgens can be equated with

the company town in Marsh v. Alabama, there is no need to tall;
about anything under the Constitution because it is simply
inapplicable.
MR. COME:
Q

I think that there is a middle situation.

That is what I do not understand.

That is what

I did not frankly understand in Tanner, and of course you have
the Court's opinion.
MR. COME:

I had problems too, but I think we have to

start with Tanner as a given and having that as a given—
Q

.No, one really has to start with the Constitution

as the given.
MR. COME:

That is correct, but this Court interpreted

the Constitution in Tanner and 1 think ended up with a middle

49
situation which, although is not as much state action as a
company town in Marsh v. Alabama, is enough state action to
invoke the Constitutional protections provided you can satisfy
the relatedness and the inability to make the appeal on public
property test.

And we believe that on the facts here the

Board has satisfied those tests.
Thank you.
Q

Mr. Come, are you asking affirmance here on the

reasoning of the Court of Appeals or on the Board's reasoning?
MR. COME:
Court of Appeals.

I would say on the reasoning of the
I think that the Board's reasoning is not a

model of clarity here.

But I think that there's enough in

the Board's opinion to indicate that although they expressed
themselves perhaps—
Q

Do you see any Chenery problem here?

MR. COME:
Q

No, 1 do not, Your Honor.

Why?

MR. COME:

Because I think that the Board's opinion

indicates that although it said it was applying Babcock, it
recognised that a different balance was called for here.
Q

So, you do not think that the Court of Appeals’

basis in fact., is any different from the Board?
MR. COME:

Not if the Board had the benefit of the

Court of Appeals' opinion; I am quite sure that the Board
would have embraced it.

50

Q

That may be so, but Chenery says the Court of

Appeals should not invent a new rule and than make the fact
finding.
MR. COME:

I know that that is the general rule, but

there are exceptions, and I think that this is one of those
that fits—Q

If there are not any, you mean that we ought to

create one.
MR. COME:

There are some, Your Honor, particularly

where you have—what you have here really is an interpretation
of two recent decisions of this Court, and this Court is
certainly in the best position to make that interpretation.
Q

That is on the rules, not the facts.

MR. COME:
Q

What is that?

It depends on what the rule is, not the facts.

MR. COME:

But if you interpret Lloyd and Central

Hardware as the Fifth Circuit did, the Board has made
adequate fact findings to fit within that rule.
Q

You are now telling us that beeaiase you now like

what the Court of Appeals did, consider the case as if the
Board had already—
MR. COME:
way.

Yes, Your Honor, and the law develops that

The Board learns from the courts of appeals and from this

Court.
Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER 3
ORAL ARGUMENT

Mr. Gold

OF LAURENCE GOLD, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT RWDSU
MR. GOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The petitioner's argument, as I understand it, is that
the Babcock & Wilcox test, which we have been discussing,
applies, across the board no matter how one would denominate
the property for Constitutional purposes, whether it would be
a purely private, the intermediate public-private type of
property at issue in Logan Veil ley and Lloyd, at least in the
Constitutional context that those cases arose, or the purely
public private property, if I can call it. that, of Marsh and
other cases like that.
Q

Do you understand that Log an Valley created

some intermediate twilight zone kind of situation?

I do not

think I would have joined the Logan Valley opinion if I had
understood it that way.

I thought he equated it with Marsh

v. Alabama.
MR. GOLD:
Stewart.

That was my understanding, Mr. Justice

We participated in that case.

But, as you can

appreciate, we try to learn from the subsequent decisions, and
the lesson that 1 believe has to be drawn from the majority
opinion is that—
Q

Which case?

52
MR„ GOLD:
Q

In Lloyd v. Tanner»

I was talking about Logan Valley.

MR, GOLD:

I agree fully.

As I read Logan Valley?

it equated the situation in Marsh and the situation in—that
was before the Court at that time,

X can only read the majority

opinion, however, in Lloyd to reach a different result, and
that is why there is a very interesting recent case in which
Judge Tuttle wrote the opinion which the petitioner cites in
his reply brief, migrant workers.

It is in 513 Fed, 2nd,

Judge Tuttle carves up the area into three different
categories of this type and holds that in that case the
company town is not completely dead as we had thought but there
was one in existence.
for,

This is not the rule that I would argue

X only say that is my understanding of—
Q

What you are faced with.

MR. GOLD:
Q

Yes.

How do you say Lloyd created a different rule

from Logan?
MR. GOLD:

My understanding, Mr. Justice White, of

Marsh is that you do not have to show that the message that you
are communicating is one which is directly related to the store
in front of which you are standing or to the general shopping
center area.

I would assume that after Lloyd, if antiwar

protesters had appeared in Chickasaw and Chickasaw was still n
company town, that they would have had a First Amendment right.

53
to distribute their handbills in Chickasaw just the way the
Jehovah's Witness did»
But my understanding of

Lloyd is that Lloyd does i ot

overrule Logan Valley but rather states that the property is
not as fully dedicated to the public and that there are First
Amendment rights which are recognised, but they are narrow.
You have to have speech which is directly related to the
functions and purposes of the shopping center.

And that is why

I think, as I understand for Constitutional purposes, there
are three different types of property that we are discussing,
at least functionally and whan we discuss them in terras of
First Amendment rights.
But the point I wanted to make is that we accept-—
Q

But Logan saved those situations where it might

be said that -the activities being engaged in were not related
to the uses to which the shopping center was dedicated.
MR. GOLD:
Q

It saved it as an open question.

It did not purport to say then that Logan's

rationale would apply where the activity was not related.
MR. GOLD:
Q

I do not disagree with that.

What is the difference between that and Lloyd?

Lloyd deals with it but it is not inconsistent.
MR. GOLD:

Mr. Justice White, I did not mean to imply

that Lloyd was inconsistent with Logan.
there is language in

I meant to imply that

Logan which would have indicated that the

54
question, saved in - Logan would receive an affirmative answer
when it was posed»

That, was not the case when the question

was finally posed»

So, now I was saying to Mr. Justice Stewart

I understand there to be a difference between a company town and
a shopping center such as Log an or Lloyd for First Amendment
purposes =
The question before us here is whether there is
three types of property or more when we are dealing with
Section 7 and the National Labor Relations Act.

Our view of

the case is that we start by answering the petitioner on his
own premise, which is that all these types of property are the
same, the factory in Babcock & Wilcox and the shopping center
in this case and in Logan and Central Hardware and Lloyd. And
our view is that Babcock & Wi loose teaches that in a situation
in which entre is sought for the purpose of communieating with
employees about whether or not they should become organized,
the act is essentially neutral as to where the activity takes
place and that the basic point of Babcock & Wi loose is that tha
property rights are not absolute, the National Labor Relations
Act enacts its own system which displaces private rights on
occasion.

That had also been the lesson of Republic Aviation.

It is the lesson in such cases as Lynn and Letter Carriers v„
Austin when you talk about the right of reputation. That what was
necessary was to draw the fair inferences out of the statute as
to when private property would be displaced.

55
Q

Mr, Come said he did not think there was any

other adequate means of communication, but he did not treat
the specifics mentioned by Mr. Cohan.

Do you have any comment

on those alternatives?
MR. GOLDs

Yes,

We have two basic points that I

would make on the alternatives.

First, as I was coining to

here, we deal not with organizing activity of the type that
was at stake in Babcock s Wilcox but with picketing in support
of an economic strike at the struck employer’s facility.
We know7 from what this Court has said and from what
Section 7 says that Congress did not merely give a right to
picket somewhere.

It had in mind that employers could continue

to operate when they were faced with a strike and that unions
would have the countervailing record of peaceful, non-obstucting,
non-obstrueted picketing at the location in which they would
attempt to convince those who were approaching the situs to
buy or sell or otherwise contribute to the day to day activities
of the employer, that they should not do so, and this is the:
balance that the act strikes.
And it is our view, first of all, Mr. Chief Justice,
that that is a right as a matter of law and that just as this
Court-Q

And is to do this kind of picketing at the

situs-”

f

MR. GOLD s

Right.

56

Q

-“the business situs.

MR. GOLD:

At the business situs.

In the words of the

Steelworkers case, at the entrance to the struck facility.

That

is where you have a fair chance to employ this countervailing
method,not somewhere far away where, as even Mr. Cohen
acknowledged, if I understand his answer to your question, I
believe, the* message is diffused and somebody going by itfith his
windows rolled up in Atlanta if it is hot or cold—because it is
air conditioned most probably if it is hot—-but so that he has
some chance to see the sign, see what the message is, and make
a determination whether he is going to shop at Butler's or is
not going to shop at Butler's.
had in mind.

We think that is what Congress

That is the classic confrontation of struggle in

the economic strike.

We think that the fair reading of cases

such as the Steelworkers case is that this particular place is
the preferred place at which to carry on that activity, and we
think from cases like American Ship and from Insurance Agents
that it is not for the Board or a court to say that there may
be some other way to do it, that the union does not need this
right, that the employer ought to be safeguarded from it.

We

think that is the place, and we think the inquiry is, Is this
the entranceway?

We think that that is a functional

question.

Is this the place at the site where you have a fair opportunity
to get your message to the employer?
P

And so our first answer, as I have tried to indicate,

57
is that we believe that in.this circumstance you do not apply
Babcock & Wilcox, which dealt with quite a different phenomenon
and where you have a different statutory

matrix and you draw

diffefent inferences from the statute, but you deal with the
particular Section 7 right that we have here at stake»
that Congress has spoken with specificity.

We think

We think that the

only way for Congress's will to ba carried out is to say that
property rights give way to the extent that it is necessary
to allow people to have a fair opportunity to reach those who
are approaching the site.
The second and perhaps even more long-winded answer
I would have to the question you asked, Mr. Chief Justice, is
to say that this Court has never had the opportunity since the
Babcock & wi 1 cox case in 35.1 US to say what reasonable alterna­
tive means are.
Mr. Cohen says that as long as it is theoretically
possible with the expenditure of almost infinite resources, at
least from the union point of view, to reach people—
Q

From the argument you just completed, we never

get. to the alternative.
MR. GOLD:

Ho.

It is our point of view that the basic

lesson, of Babcock & Wilcox is that you reach an accommodation
which works the least destruction to the rights.

As w© under­

stand the statute, in this situation as opposed to the Babcock
& Wilcox situation, the statute is in neutral

on where this

58
activity takes place.
Q

It has defined the right and specified it.

MR. GOLD;
Q

That is right.

And that is to picket at the business site.

MR. GOLDs

Right.

And we do not think we can be

strippei of our right to picket in support of our economic
strike at that site, and we do not think that we can be
relegated to taking out advertisements and so on if we can
afford it.
Q

Or even to move away 500 feet, where Mr. Cohen

suggests.
MR. GOLDs

That is right.

And I would point out

again, only if I understood him correctly because 1 am not
positive I did, and I know he will have rebuttal time and will
speak for himself--! understood him to admit that the message
is diffused, it is not the same if one is five hundred thousand
feet away at a place where vehicles are entering and so on,
especially where you have 60 stores and all the other facts
that are here.
Q

Could 2 ask you—a single hardware store with a

parking lot behind it, fronting on a public street, entrances
in front and back—is it your position that the union would
have the right to picket the back door as well as the front
on the employer8s parking lot?
MR. GOLD:

Clearly I think we have the right to picket

59
in the front? and if customers were also entering in the back
and if you had the same type of factual situation here, they
were driving onto this lot and we could not reach them, 1 would
give precisely the same answer.
Q

That is my position.

How about that Sears Roebuck example?

You are

familiar with that store, are you not?
MR. GOLD s
Q
go in there.

Yes.

Or Lord and Taylor.

You know how you have to

It is all on private property.

You go up

ramps

and you park, and I gather as many people come in frora the
parking lot which is elevated into the upper floors as come in
from the front of the store.

How about that?

Could they picket

up there?
MR. GOLD:

I think it would be an improper and unfair

definition of what the entranceway is to say that the only
place they could picket would be out where the cars drive in off
the public street with all the problems-”
Q

As I remember that Lord and Taylor thing, you are

a block away for the ramp.
MR. GOLD:

That is right.

And there are walkways

around the store as people exit from their cars and walk to the
©ntranceways, and I think that is the entranceway.
Q

Have there been any cases on this one?

I had not

realized that you could picket on the employer’s own property
if there was some alternative place to picket.

60
MR. GOLD:

I think that is the question that is here

I do not think we know.
Q

That is why we are here.

You said the right to strike or rather to picket

at a particular site was itself defined in the statute.
is that definition?

Where

What statute and what language ars you

talking about?
MR. GOLDs

It is not in haec verba.

We draw the

understanding out of this Court's opinions, most particularly
Steelworkers.
Q

I thought you said a moment ago it was defined

in the statute.
MR. GOLD:

No,

I was saying that Section 7 gives the

right to strike and picket and that Congress had certain things
in mind when if. granted that right; and, as this Court has
recognized, one of the things it had in mind was that the
picketing would take place; at the entrance to the struck site.
That is exactly what this Court said.
Q

That is not what I understood you to say earlier,

MR. GOLD:

I apologize if I was not clear.

But I

not mean to imply that there is anything in haec verba in the
statute.

I am saying the statute was enacted against the

background of a certain understanding, and that has been the
understanding of this Court in cases such as the Steelworkers
case.

Q

Mr. Gold, do I understand you to say that this

did

61
type of picketing would have been valid on the parking lot at
Central Hardware?
MR. GOLD:

That would be the position that that 1

would argue for, Your Honor.
Q

So, you draw the basic distinction between

organizational activity and picketing directed towards the
customers of the store?
MR. GOLD:

In support of an economic strike,

right.

In other words, I am seeking to answer the petitioner3 y
argument on all fours.

The petitioner argues that you do not

draw the line between different types of property but have one
test.

I am saying, very well, we accept that, that we are

drawing the fair inferences from the statute and in light of
Steelworkers and the other cases, we think this is the fairest
inference.
Q

Your argument would get you in the store too

then.
MR. GOLD:
Q

No, I do not think—

Why not?

I

It is just the employer's property.

Just picket inside the front door as the most accurate, most
effective way of picketing.
MR. GOLD:

No, because I do not ‘think I could stand up

here with a straight face and say that—
Q

You are standing up here with a straight face

just outside the door.

62

MR. GOLD;

1 think that is all the difference 'in the

world.
Q

There is only a glass doer between you.

MR. GOLD;

I take it that eventually one could

argue to go inside the manager's office or anywhere else.
do not think that that is the fair inference.

I

I do think the

fair inference is that the employer could not by his property
rights exit off your right to appeal to the customers to use fhi
one weapon that Congress gave you.
Q

On your own property?

MR. GOLD:
Q

Yes, on your own property.

You say the employer's property right must give

way if it means that that gives you an effective way of
operating.
MR. GOLD:
Q

So, you would go inside the door too.

MR. GOLD:
Q

In this instance, yes.

No, I would not ask to go inside the door.

Your time has run out, but I have just one

question I would like to ask you.

Do you support affirmance on

the reasoning of the Court of Appeals?
MR. GOLD:

I have a great deal of trouble, given all

the changes that I—
Q

I gather the answer is no, not compXetely.

MR. GOLD:
Q

Not completely.

Secondly, then what do you do with the Chenery

63

point?
MR. GOLDi

On the Chensry point I would say that I

would hope that the least that would come out of this case
would be that the Court would articulate the standard that we
have stated and remand it for a determination.
Q

So, if we agree with you, we will have to remand

will we?
MR. GOLD:
appropriate»

I would think that would be perfectly

1 apologize? 2 never got to the second part of

my answer to the Chief Justice.
Q

We did not let you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Cohen, do you have

something further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. LAWRENCE M. COHEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. COHEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Th© answer

I

think to the question that was asked of

Mr. Gold is that this Court nor th® Board nor the courts of
appeal have never held what Mr. Gold now seeks, which is the
proposition that a union has an absolute right to picket at

I think th@ cases that are illustrative and the anawe,:
also to some of the hypotheticals asked of Mr» Come, are two
board decisions which came out after Lloyd, after Central
Hardware, and dealt with the precise type df question we haves
here, the Nichols case and the Visceglia case.

case you had a small shopping canter, five, stores.

has been onforcement denied by the Third Circuit.

Would you spell that first word.

MR. COHEN:
Q

V-i-s-c-e-g-l-i-a.

Enforcement denied?

65
MR. COHEN:

Enforcement denied»

And enforcement was

denied because, if 1 could explain the facts in the Nichols
case—the Board in applying the picketing situation involving
a store in a small shopping center, said that "As 1 understas 1
in Central Hardware"—this is the administrative law judge5 £
opinion which was adopted by the Board—"an employer may
violate Section 0.1 by denying a union the right to engage in
organizational activities on private property"—-and that
encompassed picketing here, they said'» “That result will follow
only if acts are shown to meet the criteria enunciated in
Babcock s Wilcox.

As the general counsel offered no evidence

that would bring the case within Babcock & Wilcox criteria, it
follows the complaint must be dismissed»5'
In Viaceglia you had an employer located in a big
industrial park.

The union came onto the private roads of the

industrial park.

It was ah economic strike against that

employer.

It picketed at the entrance to that employer's plant

The Board concluded that it was a Babcock & Wilcox case.
said in sc many

words:

It

"For the reasons expressed in Centra.!

Hardware, we find that principles of Babcock a Wilcox, rather
than Logan Valley, are applicable."
The Board found that the Babcock test had been met
for many of the reasons that Mr. Gold indicated, but the Third
Circuit reversed and said that is not Babcock & Wilcox, there
are other reasonable alternatives, the Board did not consider

66
thern^. besides picketing, and therefore we dismiss the complaint,
w® find we deny enforcement because Babcock 6 Hi Icon test has*
been met.
Q

Mr. Gold would disagree with at least the first

case, would he not?
MR. COKENs

I think ha would disagree with both of

them because he said there is an absolute right to picket,

y'n

point I wanted to make in response to Mr. Gold is that his
position has been on® that, has never bean accepted by any
court.

The Steelworkers case only said that it was not an

8(b)(4) secondary boycott violation.

That is

all the Court says.

So, w® do not even have to consider whether there was violence
here.

That is a matter for state law and for other provisions

of the act.

It is not a matter for 8(b)(4).

The answer I think is that picketing is one means of
communication, not the only means of communication.
be more effective in the union's mind.

It may

It may be more persuasiv--

in many ways.
But it is not, under a Babcock analysis, which is
what the Board has been applying, what w© would apply in these
cases.

It is not the only answer.
The only difference between the Nichols case and th©

Visceglia ease

and th© ease that is at bar is the fact that

those were smaller properties? they differed in sis©; they
differed because they were clustered in & small—they were not

67
clustered in a shopping center? they differed in degree of
openness.

But this Court in

Lloyd mad© it clear that that is

a question of degree? it is not a question of principle, that
there is difference between those cases and these cases as
fundamental principles of law.

And I think that is the point

we make here today, that Babcock must apply to all types of
property, cutting across the line because it is a

Section 7

case, that if there is a Constitutional right under Lloyd,
that is a different question altogether.

And when you apply

Babcock, you look to the question of all type i of ccnonunica­
tion, not merely just & question of whether the union can picket
at the struck plant.
