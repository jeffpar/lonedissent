QUESTIONS

Well, the Clerk's office is open on

Sa turd ay, too.
MR. GOLD;

Yes.

This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the
Fifth Circuit.

That court, ©a banc, reversed a panel decision

and held that the agency shop clausa in. the collective bargain­
ing agreement in question here contravened Texas * law prohibit­
ing such forms of union security.

That clause, as is common,

required the payment of dues by employees who have completed
■thirty days of employment as a condition of continued employ­
ment.
The collective agreement here is between the oil,
Chemical and Atomic Workers Union and its local and the Mobil
Corporation, and the agreement covers unlicensed seamen who
work ora the corporation * s tankers which ply the high seas be­
tween Taxas and the Eastern ports and also on occasion between
foreign ports.
The clause in question is set out at page 281 of tfea
printed appendix, and the entire agreement is at pages 280
through 329.
We believe that two questions are presented.

The

first is what is the test for determining to whom the law ap­
plies whsn you have a situation in which an agreement is nego­
tiated and administered in different states and work is per­
formed in still another jurisdiction and there are contrasting

5
onion security policies in all three.
'■fa

suggest that the answer to that question is that

the law of the jurisdiction where the bulk of the work is per­
formed is the law that should apply.
There is a second question, and that is whether the
test we have just, stated applies in a case such as this, where
on© of the jurisdictions is the high seas, or whether its uprli
cation is limited to cases in which the work is land-based with
in the United States.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Gold, you don't rely, do you, on the

constltutionai complex principles that would say Texas didn't,
have enough contact with this contract, even apart from federal
preemption?
Kl. GOLD:
■:ap .. „

No, we view this as a federal statutory

Section 14(b) sets the framework for the case, and we

don't think that it is a case which is in the area of constitu­
tional conflicts of laws.
Very summarily, the facts ar© theses

The District

Court found, and it is a conservative estimate, that the
covered seamen do 80 to 90 percent of their work on the employ­
's:;:

i: tanker.-? that I just, described, while those -tankers ar© on

fchs high seaa and outside the boundaries of any state.
QUESTION:

But ©very employ®© does some of hi;

MR. GOLD:

They are on —

in Texas?

work

6
QUESTION:

10 percent?

MR. GOLDS

10 to 20 percent is the estimate.

20 percent?
Our

figures, as w© note at pages 3 arid 4 of the record, would in­
dicata that perhaps it is closer to 5 porcent.

I would also

note, in light of your question, that that time in port is
approximately the same amount of time spent in northern ports,
where, again, the seamen are on ship whan the boat is under
pilot or whan it is being loaded and unloaded, and there is a
non-right fco work —
QUESTION:

And where are the workers hired?

MR. GOLD:

They are hired principally in two different

locations, as thes record shows, perhaps 60 percent in Texas end
40 percent in northern ports.
QtEtTIOH:

And you wouldn't distinguish between the 60

rad the 40 in your presentation?
KH. GOLD:
tinction.

TLa Xowsr court would not make such a dis­

W3 don’t believe that the point of hire or the point

;;f :ccu;-.1.d©nc'R are the points which indicate who is covered.
However, if you had a unit where you had people working in on©
state and other people working in another state, then we would
■think that th©rs would be a difference,

and the leading NLRB

c?.?« which wo rely on makes just that distinction.

There are

bargaining anils from tims to time which are in more than on©
state.

Tha District Ccurt hold that since the Mobil Oil

7
Corporation's headquarters for — administrative headquarters,
out of which it ran its American flag tanker fleet, was in
Texas, that the greatest part of -the administration of the
agreement took placa in Texas whan you compare that state to
any other state.

Neither the District Court nor the Court of

Appeals' majority, however, gave any weight to any of the
activities which occurred on shipboard in reaching that con­
clusion.
As I have already stated, it is our view that really
the only operative fact that is relevant her© is the fact that
the overwhelming bulk of the work takes place on ships which are
on the high seas.

Wa suggest that the job situs is the appro­

priate test,for four separate reasons.
First, of all, the job situs test, we believe, is ths
■cast which moot accurately reflects the language of section
14(b), which is the operative provision of the federal labor
law in question hare.
Before getting to that, if I may digress, in 1947,
:h©r© was & complete review of the entire question of unions
security by the Congress in connection with the passage of the
Taft-Hartley amendments, and the resolution of that review was
that as a matter of federal law, uniform throughout employment
in this country, the closed shop, which requires union maraharship at the time of hire, was to be barred, that no employe©
who was not a union member at the time of hire could be

3

required to join the union for the first thirty days or pay
dues, that thereafter there was nothing in federal law which
prohibited as a condition of continued employment the require"
meat that employees pay dues, but that the states were free to
enact their own policy on the question of whether, after the
30th day of employment, employees could be required to pay dues
or become union members as a condition of continued, employment.
We think 'that that background is relevant because it
indicates a congressional determination to bs neutral between
right to work and union security states.

Both policies are

valid under fell© national labor, and since policies are valid,
it seems to us clear that there has to be a circumscribed scop©
for the policy of a right to work state or of a union security
state, and the limitation has to be one concerning what employ™
.-v.t relationships are centered in that state, because if one

state could in ©ssonce export its policy to cover employment
relationships in another;, that would be contrary to the bas ic
policy of neutrality,; and the question therefore is what is the
V;ring of the tp.ployj&feht relationship, where is the center of
•the employment relationship.
As I have indicated before I started

that digression,

v® believe it is the place where the employees are working sad

we believe that that is the test, first of all, which dees the
best service to the language.
Among other places, section 14(h) is set oat in full,

9
it is a short provision, at page 14 of our opening brief, the
brown brief for petitioners.

It is phrased as a permission to

the states and is phrased also in terms of covering numerous
states.

To put it in focus, we think that a fair paraphrase of

the language is that each state may prohibit fch® execution or
application ©f an agreement requiring membership in a labor
organisation as a condition of employment in that state or
territory, and w© think that on the normal and accepted concept
of where is somebody employed for purposes of determining what,
his permissible conditions of employment are thirty days and
thereafter during his tenure of employment, it is a place where
he is working.

That just seams to us to be the common sens® of

the matter.
y.ii is fcru-o, as the ccmpany points out, that the

statute permits a state to prohibit both the execution and ap­
plication, it is in the subjectiva, either on© or both may b©
?rdiibit©d by a state, but we don’t think that cuts against our

crgmvant that fch© prohibition has to relate to employees who
ara working in that state, because the common sens© of that, w®
believe, is ‘that a state may prohibit execution of an agreement

cov::ri:-‘.g employees in fch a state in question in order to assure
that fch© agreement can be declared unlawful before anybody is
discharged.

If a state were only to prohibit application, the

argument could have been made, we take it, that the msres ©aoscuhion of tht agreement, if no one is discharged, is not illegal,

10
and we don’t —

On the other

hand, as I have indicated, these voyages typically go from Texas
to New York, Rhode Island and New Jersey, all of which are
union security states...

ally they would be in Florida territorial waters for a good,

rather, that SO to 90 percent of their work takes place on the
high seas outside the territorial waters of any state.

That's right, they come in --

QUESTION:

MR. GOLD:

That's right.

MR.GOLD:

matter is greater than min®.
QUESTIONS

Mali, it is pretty ancient expertise.

I

,

don’t think tha geography has changed •—
. GOLD:

Okay.

As I said —

QUESTION:

— even though I have.

MR. GOLD:

As I have indicated, -the record facts, as

wa understarI them and as the District Court found them, ar©
that such vessels are located on the high seas or in ports
otter -than ports, located in the State of Ter as approximately 80
]:•• ;rcent to 90 percent of the time, and that finding is set out
at page 8 of our brief, and that has been the basis upon which
w© have understood the case.
QUESTION:

of course, when they get up into the

12
©astern ports, Hew York, Providence, Boston, the ships then are
in non-right to work states —
MR. GOlDs

Correct.

QUESTION:

— although the crew generally goes ashore

on liberty during the loading and unloading operations, don''t
they?
MR. GOLD:

Well, the record indicates that the crew

is permitted off the ship when they are not standing watches or
otherwise working for eight hours at a time, that indicates
that the time found during which the seamen are in territorial
waters, as id.® from the point you have raised, Mr. Justice
Stewart, is probably less, if anything, than the court found,
if we looked at working time.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, what if you have a collective

bargaining coz .tract executed in Houston or Beaumont covering
workers who, it was cfot.oaded, war© trained in Texas for 25 days
and then sent somawbare els® which didn’t have a right to work
law?

Would you say that.- Texas could not forbid the execution

of that sort of an agreement?
MR. GOLD:

Yes, I would, Your Honor •—

QUESTION:

I take it, you probably would?

MR. GOLD:

— and I would say that, by the same token,

if all the facts you stated wars true and the occurrence; took
place in Louisiana, and the employees were then seat to Taras,
•that Texas could prohibit application of that agreement, or if

13
it was executed solely to cover such employees —
QUESTION:

Surely, Texas couldn’t prohibit its execu­

tion in Louisiana.
HR. GOLD:

Well,

"prohibit execution" may be an im­

proper terra, but what I was trying to say was I believe that
Texas, in the situation we are talking about, if youhad only a
tingle unit of such employees, could enjoin its application tc
those ©rapley@©s, and I would think that is true if the agree­
ment was negotiated in Louisiana, whether if both of the
.-signatory parties, namely the union and the employee, war©
located in Louisiana, so long as the work was taking place in
Texas.

That is & consequence of our theory'-, .and we think that

ihat neutral principia is the best application of section 14(b)-,'
not booeusa w$ believe m are going to win every case under, it,
because it make,.: the most sans© for all the reasons that I
am trying to state.
Obviously., I don’t go so far as to say that we would
be here arguing this point if it didn't result in this —
QUESTION^

What would you do if the contract is execu­

ted in Texas and exactly 50 percent of the work is done in
Texas and 50 percent don© in the state that does not have a
right to work law?
MR. GOLD:

Well, if you get to a point where the ,

balance is absolutely equal, the labor board — and to sort of
move into my second point .sad try to answer that question —

14
the labor board would deal with the administration of a pro­
vision requiring union shop elections in order for a union shop
provision to go into effect, and it had to deal with the
variety of questions which can arise in determining which law
applies.

And basically whafe the labor board did was set down

two rules.
Th© first rule is the job site of the employees in
question, is determinative.

The second rule, which arose in a

slightly different way than, you state, but is equivalent to it,
is that the headquarters of the employees, the place where
they are paid, receive their instructions and report, controls.
And that, arose in a cases of truck drivers going through many
states, soma right to work, soma union security, and the board.sz
conclusion that there' wasn't any way to really find out where
the preponderant amount of the work was.

The board nevertheless

said that since we are focusing on the situation of these

employees whose condition of continued employment is in ques­
tion, was the issue, that it would look to the employee head­
quarters in the. absence of a clear job site, and we think that
that was a sensible principled reading of the statute and
enjoys and gives the argument we make the added weight set out
' -i ca”-fcc such :.r Norwegian Nitrogen and other eases which hulk

agency at the —
QUESTION:

Wall, how much of the job has to be

15
performed ia the state with the right to work law before that
law is applicable?
MR. GOLD:

W© would think that whichever state the

preponderance of the work was done ought to b® -the state whose
law controls, and I would take it that there will be some
cases where you may gat into as close a situation as you en­
visage, but I don't think that they will b© ■—
QUESTION:

What about the collective bargaining con­

tract; that covers workers in two different states and some
workers d© all their work in one state and other workers do all
•their work in another?
MR. GOLD:

That was precisely the issue that first

faced the board in a case called Giant Food? which we cite? and
uv: hcuru

; b; teat ten catena a: an who worked entirely i: on

right to work nfa&fce were covered by the right to work, and the
•employees in the union security state could have the union
security provision applied to them, and we think that that ra&ten
the vary bent sene® that can be made 1», this area in terms of
QUESTION:

So the bargaining contract has to reflect

both, I take it?
HR. GOLD:

Well, that's right.

There are agreements,

■ n .c cn the; one you had before you in General Motors, where yea
have plants — I have no idea how many states, but in a very
vast number of states, and the basic reaction of the court was
that obviously the

'

law would apply as to the plants

16
Indiana, but, that wouldn't have negated the agreement as to the
©ap loy ees in Mi chigan.

QUESTIONs

And hence the placa ©f contracting isn't

very important?
MR. GOLD?
ba important.

Jin, we would not believe that it ought to

Th© one thing that is clear in employer-employes

relationships is that we can count on the employer to have
people work where he needs them.

On the other hand, where an

agreement is negotiated may have nothing at all to do with the
situation of the employees and what is the rule most fairly
attuned to their situation.
Obviously, if the rule wore the place of negotiation,

there might be feasts of strength about where an agreement was
to be negotiated.
QUESTIONS

On® could concede your two-state analogy,

I suppose, saying that the union security state has every bit
much right to have its policy enforced as does the right to
work state, and sti.ll feel that here th© result might coat® out
differently than you suggest because, as you say, the federal
policy is

you don't have a pro-union security state

pulling against a right to work state, but. it is basically
Texas versus the Federal government.
MR. GOLD:

Wall, I think ~

QUESTION:

You don't say that, tbs federal policy is

neutral, do you?

17
MR. GOLD:

No, 1 say -the federal conflicts principle

is neutral, but —
QUESTIONS

I -thought earlier you said that the federal

policy was neutral with respect to right to work —
MR. GOLD %

What I was attempting to say, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, was that the federal policy is neutral between law
givers.

Normally, if the federal government does something,, it

is supreme by the fact of its action.

Here, in 8(a)(3), the

federal government has not utilized the preemptive powers it
has on the basis of the commerce clause.

But, again, because it

seems to wrap up so many things, I go back to the first labor
board case, this Giant Food case, which —

Columbia.

QUESTIONs

had that involved the District of Columbia?

MR. GOLD:

—• which involved th® District of

Now, Congress has never enacted a right to work law

for any federal jurisdiction in which it has the same type of
uxelusive control that a state has, that th© state of Texas has
within Texas.

And in .that sense, the federal jurisdictions

are union security jurisdictions, just the way New York is.
Most union security states don't have a law saying that union
security is permissible.

There is th© absence of a law pro-

eements between employers and unions which require
condition of e-atimsad employment.

And th© federal jurisdic­

tion, such as th© District ©f Columbia, is that type of juris­
diction.

18
Now, it is th® second point of our argument that the
high seas, an American flag ship on the high seas is within an
exclusive, federal jurisdiction, the federal maritima juris­
diction, which is just th© same for present purposes as federal
jurisdiction over th® District of Columbia.

So you do have,

in terms of the neutrality of conflicts principi©, the same
type of interests at stake that you would have in a case where
the employees spent 80 or 90 percent of their time in the
District of Columbia, but 10 percent of their time in Virginia.
QUESTION:

Do you think you can draw th© same infer-

ones from Congress'9 failure?, to legislate with respect to union
security on the high, seas that you could from its failure to
legislate with respect to union security or its absence in th®
District of Columbia?
MR. GOLDs.
is proper to do so-

Y©3, Mr. Justice Relinquish, we think it

-ffcr

the reason that, as we point out at

length in our brief — and as Judge Ainsworth, who is an
admiralty and maritime '.lawyer of some not© pointed out in his
dissent -- the federal government has always regulated th®
employment conditions of American ship sailors on the high seas
in th® way that states havs regulated employment conditions
within th© states.

Indeed,.the federal law regulating that

;::p.loyiraat relationship was far more detailed, I think, far
'l3”;3 iaisseK-faira tear- a comparable stats policy.
QUESTION:

But you could get a number of federal

19
maritime., enactments that would apply to a worker within the
three-mile or tea-mile territorial limits of Texas waters,
couldn't you?
MR. GOLD:

Well, we make the point in our reply brief

that w® think -ai® only thing we claim — and I hops w® made it
clearly in our opening brief, too — the only thing we claim is
that there is exclusive jurisdiction on the high seas.

Whan

you get into territorial waters, you get into all the complexi­
ties of fch© extent to which the state law and the federal law
are concurrent, complexities which we don’t think are answered
by any of this Court’s precedents that we know.

And nothing

that we are arguing her© would prejudge the question of whether
the state right to work law would ba preeminent for somebody
who worked solely Within the territorial waters or primarily
within the territorial waters of a given state.
1 would like to reserve —
CiOStlON:

Before you sit down, if you haven’t

thought about this, you could ba thinking about this while you
are sitting down:

This is a matter of construing the language

of 14(b), which appears on page 14.
HR. GOLD:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Dc you think fch© phrase “in any state or

territory ir which such" and so on modifies employment or dosa
it modify execution or application of agreements?
MR * GOLD:

Ir: cur view, it modifies employment or

20
there would have been no need to gon to say in which such
execution or application is prohibited.

In other words, w©

think the respondents wish to suggest that this provision reads
"nothing in this act shall be construed as authorizing the
execution or application of agreements requiring membership in
a labor organisation as a condition of employment where such
execution or application of prohibited by the state ©r terri­
torial law.

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. golds

And w© think the second reference indicates

that the focus is on the employe® who we are trying to deter­
mine may have to pay dues as a condition of continued employ­
ment .

QUESTION!

So you say the employment must be in any

state or fcsrritory
MR. GOLOs . Yes,.

I'M, SOLDi

tod again to go on with some of the ex-

,;les that I was discussing with Mr. Justice Rehnqnist and Mr.
■■'asvice Lhiv,^,- ,;n icn’t bellsv® it would'make v@rv good sens©
to say if you have a situation in which an agreement is nego­
tiated in Texas and all the work is to be don® in Louisiana,

21
that this was intended to permit Texas to cancel Louisiana's
choice by saying you were foolish enough to wonder into our
state to executive the agreement, even though the people who
ar® really affected by it aren’t working hero, we are going to
invalidate the agreement.
QUESTION; 'The agreement, I suppose, means collective
bargaining agreement, doesn't it?
HE. GOLD;

Yes.

QUESTION2

Mr. Gold, has the petitioner abandoned fcha

primary jurisdiction issue that was raised in the petition?
MR. GOLD;

In light of your opinion in Connell, we

have not pressed it.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF -JAMES W. HAMBRIGHT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

MR. HAMB;R:&ht.;

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, members of

the Court;
The issue i'a this ossa is whether Texas, the State af
Texas has sufficient interest in the employment relationship
between respondent and the employees in

its tanker fleet Im&H"

cuartsred at Beaumont so that uadar section 14 (b) of the NI-.RA,
as amended, the Texas right to work law applies to the agency
shop clause in that agreement.
The trial court said that it did.
said -that the trial court was correct.

The Firth Circuit

W© urge this Court to

22
affirm, primarily for the reason that Congress has mad© no
exception as to seafaring or maritime employees under the TaftHartley Act, as it did under the Railway Labor Act for airline
pilots and train crews, and for fch© further reason, Your
Honors, that the employment relationship in this case is
centered in Taxas.
We start with the proposition —
QUESTION:

I take it, you wouldn't be here if none of

the work was done in Texas?
MR. HAMBRIGHT:

Your Honor, 2 think in this case w®

have so much mors than the work.

W© have tbs hiring, firing

and ~“
QUESTION:

I understand that, but suppose none of the

work was done in Taxas, all was done in Louisiana, say —
MR. HAMBRIGHT:

Your Honor, 14(b) speaks in terms of

•elocution or applicat.io», and I can't conceive of a situation
bh r-

u:nder tbs parass "application® that I could ba h©r@ before

you if there was utterly no work don® in the state where I was
urging the contract's application.
QUESTION s

So if an agreement is negotiated and

®:: cured in Taxas covering employees working at two different
plants, on© in Texas and one in Louisiana, the Iw

of Louisiana

rather than of Texas would govern the employees working at the
Louisiana plant?
MR. HAMBRIGHT:

In that connection, Your Honor, va

23
ecme back

tka

"execution," and that is what your

question is directed toward, and in looking through the legis­
lative history, I found nothing to indicate whether they meant
execution to mean signing the document, or performing the work,
because execution, when you exacute a contract, sometimes it
means you carry out the terms of the contract,

So without

reaching that area, and the looking I have don© has turned up
nothing, 1' -would have to say Your Honor is correct.
QUESTION:

So th© only difference in this case is that

10 to 20 percent of the work in addition was done in Texas?
MR. HAMBRIGHT:

Oh, no, Your Honor, we take the posi­

tion that under the phrase "application," there comes things
c.:uch as enforcement of the agency shop clause itself.

Douglas held that in Sch@rmerhorn,

Justice

-th® second, the second

Schermerhoru case, which this Court unanimously decided in 1963,
when he said that if. there could be any doubt that the language
of the section means' that the act shall not b® construed to
authorize any "application" of a union's security contract,
such as discharging an employe© which, under the circumstances,
in prohibited by the state, the legislative history of ths
section dispel it.

So therefor®, Your Honor, I think that when

speak of application, we cannot just, look at work, as my
colleague is suggesting, but we must look at things such as th©
enforcement of a union’s security clause, and this Court has
squarely noticed that distinction.

24
Haw* it is our contention that we start with the
proposition laid down by this Court in the Cooley cas® that a
state can enact a law regulating maritime commerce if the
state lav/ covers a matter not requiring a single uniform rule
nationally, and if the state law is not in conflict with the
national law.
Now, in this situation, on the question of uniformity,
Congress says there shall be disuniformity in the area of right
to work.

Again, in the Schermerhorn, the second opinion, which

I have referred to, Justice Douglas wrote for the unanimous
Court -that there is a conflict between state and federal law,
but it is a conflict santioned by Congress, with directions to
give the state the right, of way to state laws barring the execu­
tion and enforcement of union security agreements.
the word "enforcement."

And he used

Ha did nit say "execution and applica­

tion," as the statute does.

He departed just a little bit and

said the "execution and enforcement.K
QUESTION:

But you say that wasn't a departure? from

the -true meaning of the statute.
MR. HAMBRXGHT:
QUESTION:

I think that Your Honor —

I thought that was your point?

MR. HAMBRXGHT2

Mr. Justice. Stewart, I think that the

enforcement is part of the application, yes, sir, without ..
QUESTION:

Oh.

MR. HAMBRIGHT%

He further -- and on this uniformity

25
point, he further said that Congress, in other words, chose to
abandon any search for uniformity in dealing with the problems
of state, laws barring the execution and application --- he is
back, Mr. Justice, he. is back on state laws and application of
agreements authorized by 14(b) and decided to suffer a medley
of attitudes and philosophies on the subject.

So in that re­

gard, l think it would be well to see what we have here on the
subject of uniformity from the Solicitor General, who filed a
brief at the invitation of this Court.
Xu his brief — and that is the Solicitor General's
brief, on page 14 — h® said that he agreed that the United
States agrees that a state right to work lav? can be applied to

thus maritime industry.

That is what he came up with, Your

Honors, aft, nr looking it over.

Nov;, he filed three briefs with

I

yon.
writ.

First, he filed a memorandum urging you to grant this
Then he filed a brief with you, and then ha filed a

reply to our brief.

So I am talking about his primary brief.

He says in there that the United States agrees that a
•/cate right to work lav; can be applied to the maritime industry,
then ha further says, on that same page, that section 14(b) of
Taft-Hartley contains no exclusion for maritime workers .is
do is the Railway Labor Act.

Then he further said that Congress

expressly permits diversity of regulation as to union security,
and then his grand final©, which I think is most pertinent
here, he says maritime commerce would not necessarily be

26
disrupted or hindered by the applicatiori to different ships or
different employers of different union security rules.
QUESTION?

But in his grand grand finale, he agreed

that the job site should control?
MRo EAMBRIGHTs

Sir, h© seemed to find nothing wrong

with the idea that Texas law might well apply to these employ­
ees.

He only felt that Texas had an insufficient contact.
QUESTION:

H® said job site.

MR. HAMBRIGHT:
QUESTIONS

Yes, sir.

His test on —

Ho doesn't say controls.

MR. HAMERICHT:

Yes, sir, his test, the Solicitor

General's brief, on page 15, and I quota his test,

"A state

has a sufficient interest in the employment relationship only
if the employes performa some work within the stats."
QUESTION:

Mow, to get to his grand grand finals,

/hich is on.page 3 of his last brief — isn't that his last
brief?

MR. HAMBRIGHT:
QUESTION:

That is the final word from him.

That is the final word from him.

MR. HAMBRIGHT:

Yes, sir, Mr. Justice, it is.

Ha

said that Texas does not have sufficient interest and that the
job site, in his view, is predominant.

But X©t me explain how

I think he arrived at that and perhaps dropped the ball.
la, his brief, or. page 15, and I am speaking of his
primary brief, seven lines down, he states "these employees

Then on page 18 —

What are you referring to?

MR. HAMBRIGHT:

Solicitor General.

Yes, sir, that’s right,
I’m sorry.

He says "these

Tharf Your Honors, on page. 18, which coincidentally
is 18 lines down, he says "you can only perform a union
security clausa where work is dona or where dues ar® collected
and ©11 of ih@’3Q events take place outside Texas.

The work is

performed’ at sea, the dues ar© deducted from wages paid at sea.*
Than ha goes on, on page 7, line 5, he says, in
referring to this work fore®,

"a group of workers who perform

their work outside the boundarias of any state.”
QUESTION:

Wall, h® acknowledges all this in the

rupplemeatol memorandum, derrm'h he?
MR. HAMBRIGHT:

He acknowledges that he had misstated

20

the
QUESTION:

Well, he acknowledges that they do some

work in Texas?
MR. HAMBRIGHT:

Yes, sir.

But the thrust of his job

situs test is that there is no work don© in Texas, because he
says, Your Honor, that it must b® a state where some work is
don©.

He lays that down in his primary brief there.
Than, again in his primary brief, on page 11, lin® 8,

he says, "Texas cannot impose its judgment upon seamen all of
whom work and are paid outside its borders.”

Now, if it pleas©

the Court, this is not in accord with —
QUESTION:

Excusa m®, I just want to be sure I follow

what you are calling our attention to.

As I read the brief,

the first thing on page 15 was the quota from Judge Ainsworth,
rather than a quota of the Solicitor General himself, and I
don't think you. directly quoted the language on page 11, either.
Does it say exactly what you said?
MR. hit3RIGHT:
CYTESTION:

I think it does, Mr. Justice Stevens.

I didn't find it, let me just put it that

way.
MR. HAMBRIGHT:

On page 11, he says, "How can it im­

pose its" -•••■ speaking of Texas — "how can it impos® its judg­
ed in the instant case, all of whom
work and are paid outside its borders?"
QUESTION:

Thank you.

I see it now.

29
MR. HAMBRIGHT:
cio\m.

Y©s, sir, it is about Sevan lines

So my point is that on four different, pages of this

brief -—
QUESTION?

That is a statement that they all work out-

sid® its borders, it is not a statement -that none of them work
within its borders.
MR. HAMBRIGHT:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Which is quit© different.

MR. HAMBRIGHT:

How, in point of fact, the findings of

fact show that all of these seamen do work in Texas, they ill
corns there regularly and repetitively.

It shows that the

voyages normally start and stop in Texas.

It show3, -the state­

ment of findings of fact on appendix page 29, states that a
more substantini part or ths administration of the bargaining
agreement occurs in Texas than in any other state.
Now, on the question of payment, the Solicitor speaks
about collection of dues, says they are deducted from wages
paid at sea.

The facts show that these dues are computed and

deducted in Beaumont, that they are mailed off from Texas.
QUESTION:
isn’t it?

Well, that ia almost a semantical point,

I mean they art, deducted from wages, the residue of

thi.i wrgws being paid at ,'vt, but the union dues are in fact
deducted in Beaumont.

Yr a ce.t state it either way, but it.

doesn't seem to me evidences a real factual dispute.
MR. MMMM.rig:Mr. Mastic® Rehnquist, it ties in with

30
this concept, we think.

There is an exhibit that shows that

in a representative year there is about a $6 million payroll,
and that of this amount of money, only about $1,900,000 is
carried aboard ship for payment in cash to the seamen.

But the

other $4 million, the payment of that occurs within Texas.
QUESTION:

Where is fcha money earned?

MR. HAMBRIGHT:
QUESTION:

Partially in Texas, Your Honor, and —

A very small part.

MR. HAMBRIGHT:

Yes, sir, more so than in any other

of the states though.

QUESTION:

But not mar® so than on the high seas?

MR. HAMBRIGHT:

Oh, no, sir, that is correct.

But

The seamen can designate an

that they don't take the

money

them?'-.lives, it is mailed direct to their families, and all of
this is handled in Beaumont, and there is well Over a million
dollars a year disbursed in that manner.
Furthermore, the record shows that these seamen work
for 90 days are

on

vacation 30 days, but they remain a coiitij.ru-'

©us employe® all along.

And the 30-day portion of their wages,

of course, corpus directly from Texas to them.

And then, of

©ours©, the withholding tax is deducted in Beaumont ©ad paid
in Austin at the IRS office.
QUESTION:

So --

What does the record shew about the

residence of these men?

How many of them reside in Texas?

31
MR. HAMBRIGHT;

Your Honor, the record shows that

out of 289, 123 reside in Texas.

It shows 10 in Rhode Island,

10 in Maine, 13 in Louisiana, IS in Florida, 21 in New Jersey,
and SO in New York.

And then there are 3S others in 16 other

states, each having fewer than 6.
Now, the designated shipping port for these men, 152
©f them hav© designated Beaumont as their shipping port, the
others, Providence, Rhoda Island and some in New York.

But the

residence of these gentlemen, of course, is a matter that the
authors of the Harvard Law Review took into account wheel they
diacussed this case.

They held or oppinod, as much as the

Attorney General did, that Texas does hav© the right, to have
this right to work law and that there is no exemption for blue
water maritime eeamo» —
QUESTIONs

Are th® Harvard Lav? Review5 s opinions re­

garded as holdings in. Texas?
!12. Eh.IERIGHTt

H© view them with a lot more attention-

than we do soma of the reading matter, Your Honor.

In this

particular case, I viewed it with great authority as it came
I.

■ .

down point b/ point -in support of what 'the en banc panel said,
until they got again to the bottom line in which they said,
apart from my brother here, they said the Harvard Law Review
article does not say that job situs is th© test, they said that
residence ought to ba the test.

They said that the court did

have power to erpuag© this agency shop clause, but they

32

suggested that perhaps it would b@ better if we did it only in
part# and if we split it up and let it go away with respect to
the Texas residence, but- those from, as the authors there said,
the New York contingent, let it remain as to them»
Now, of course, the thing wrong with that bottom line
approach is, as this Court knows, in the H. K. Porter Company
case, this Court held that the court cannot tell parties what
to put in their labor contract and can’t tell them to modify
their clauses but can only tell them to bargain.

So I think

fch© Harvard people were on the right track until they got down
to the theory part of it.

And, of course, there is another

impediment to that also, union counsel, at th© trial of this
case, told Judga Fisher, said, "Youtr Honor, there is no way the
court can carve on this casti with sufficient. delicacy to split
up -the coverage of -this clause.a

That is in the record here,

but that is what he told th© trial court.
And then, again, th® Harvard people, I think, may
have disregarded th© fact that it is not just Texas and New
fork, but that son® of these people live in seven or eight
other states, as wall.
Now, if if please th© Court, I would Ilk© to speck

QUESTIONi

Could I ask, I take it your position is

that th© act should be coastruad so that only one law applies
under any contract?

33

MR, HAMBRIGHT:

No, sir, I do not believe, Hr. Justice

White, that you should in this case go into a sweeping docision
as to that nature, and the reason this is so is that this case
doss not concern very many people.

The Solicitor told you in

his initial memo that maybe 50,000 seamen could b® affected by
it.

But in a footnote, he told you that about 20,000 of that

figures, which he got from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, were
supervisors and not under the act, so that cuts it back to
maybe 30,000.

But the biggest distinction is, he was speaking

of people that work under maritime contracts, as we normally
view them, out of hiring halls, where they have no particular
company, no particular —

Your Honors, it is with Mobil

Your Honors# this has

in the union's initial answer#

they said less than 5 percent of the work was dons in Texas#
but when it came time to submit findings of fact,# after a twoday trial, they submitted a proposed finding in which they got
it up to 10 percent.

And then when they submitted a proposed

amended conclusion of law, they got, it up t© 20 percent.

And w©

have evidence her®. Your Honors, that puts it up higher than
that# because fhas® ships com© to Brownsville, Corpus Christ!#
Houston# Baytown# they are adding, topping off to their cargo,

And the proof shows there is a grievance here whore

i man, tlm chip load&d in three different ports and h@ caught

So what I am saying to this Court is that, more than

waters of Texas in the normal trade and# further,
work is done on the shore in Texas.

The labor —

Mr. Hambright, are you disagreeing with

Finding 18-A that they quota that says 80 to 90 percent is on
the high seas or in ports other than Texas?
Ida. HAMBRIGHT:

'So, sir? I am not disagreeing with

that because the court uses the 80 to 90 to show that there is

36

some divergence or some variation.

These are averages, Mr.

Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

Is there any other findings with respect

to the percentage of work that is within or without Texas other
than 18-A?
MR. HAMBRIGHT%
QUESTION:

No, sir, there is not.

So to go beyond that, w© have to go to the

record, the original record?
MR. HAMBRIQHT:

That is correct, Your Honor.

That is

correct.
Another matter that w© have is this business of the
old board cases, where he indicated that the test used by the
board in 1948, which was on© year after Taft“Hartley, and it
has never ravertad

to those,

is where they report for work,

where they are paid and where they get their instructions.

by radie fre i Bsaumont, where the fleat manager is located and
the fleet marina superintendent, he speaks every day on 'the

The only place a man can be terminated is in Beaumont,
Texas, and there is an' exhibit showing a letter whsre an
employee w«.s isiead terminated in Beaumont, to illustrate that.
The only place that these people are covered by unemployment
compensation insurance is in Texas, nowhere else.
QUESTION:

The early board cases to which you are

37
referring ar© Giant Food, Northland Greyhound, and Western
Electric?
MR. HAMBRIGHT:

Yes, sir. Your Honor*, and they were

decided under a provision that was repealed by Congress within
a year or so after that and it has never been reenacted.
QUESTION;

That is the requirement of a vote?

MR. HAMBRIGHT;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir, prior to the —

But the basic issue is the same, wasn't it?

MR. HAMBRIGHT:

In think in that case it was not,

Your Honor, for this reason:

In those cases, .the question was

which state law applied and not whether any state lav,? applied.
So I think they can be distinguished in that manner as well.
QUESTION:

But it was not clear to me whether or not

you think those cases were rightly or wrongly decided.
MR. HAMBRIGHT:

Your Honor, under the facts then

before the board, just from reading the cases, I would say that
they were .decided in accord with expediency —
QUESTION:

Well, I don't know if that is right or

wrong, but -MR, RAMBRIGHT:

Your Honor,

I don't think this will

ever be a problem to the board.
QUESTION:

My second question is do you think these,

eases help you in your position in this case or hurt you?
MR. HAMBRIGHT:

In those cases, Your Honor, I think

they help us because they say you look to the focal point of

30
the relationship, and they examined everything, not just the
work.

They examined where they paid, where they instructed,

where do they report, and. the record shows that all 289 of
these employees regularly report to Beaumont at on© time or
another to catch their ship for the baginning of a voyage.
That is in the record.

So they use a multi-dimensional analysis

and I think that is what this Court should do, like -Hie Fifth
Circuit did, and if that is done, if you look at the whole
employment relationship, Your Honor, X submit there will be no
problem whatsoever to the board in future dealings in this
area.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hambright, do I understand that these

60"'Scot® men in New York go to Beaumont every time they get on
the boat?
MR. HJiMBRIGHT:

They regularly and repetitively go tc

Beaumont.

For ©very trip?

How do they go there,

plan© or something?
MR. HAMBRIGHT:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, they get —

Are you sura they don’t go down on one of

the boats?
MR. HAMBRIGHT:

Oh, Your Honor, they do, but they

also fly —

That is what I thought.

MR. HAMBRIGHT:

— sometimes they fly to catch the

39
ship there because they get —
QUESTION?

They rid® right on the same ship?

MR. HAMBRIGHT:

Well, when their work cycle is over,

Mr. Justice Marshall, the 90 days is over and they go ashore,
3G days later they have to catch a ship again.

That decision

is —
QUESTION:

And they go to Beaumont to catch it?

MR. HAMBRIGHTs

Very often that is the case, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

I thought you said they always did.

MR. HAMBRIGHT:

No, sir, I said that regularly and

repetitively they do catch ships in Beaumont, but not every
time.

I didn’t mean to say that. Your Honor.
Another thing that has to do with the application of

the labor contract is the handling of grievances.

The record

shews that 23 out of 21 top-level grievances were heard in
Beaumont, Texas in this cases, and only 4 went to arbitration.
Now, that is a pretty important aspect of labor relations„
All of the employees get their mail in Beaumont *
ones in New York, they are no exception.

The

Whan they first com.©

with the company -- this didn't show up in the appendix too
well, but they get this welcome aboard booklet, and in there it
aays that your mailing address shall be P. 0. Box so-and-so,
Beaumont, Texas.

So that is just one more indication of the

fact that fcfr® ©mployraenfc relationship is actually cantered in

40
Texas.
And I hop® the Court will bear in mind that these are
not hiring hall seamen.

These are not seamen who are sitting

around waiting and hoping that thay might get a job.

So where

the arms of admiralty around these people with the special
privileges affording seafaring men, when they don't have a job
at all, and in our cas© these men have a permanent lifetime
job.
Thank you, Your Honors.
QUESTION;

Mr. Hambright, just before you sit down,

in your colloquy with Mr. Justice White, did you agree that
this case, properly decided, should b® confined to maritime
employment, or did you take the view that it has a considerably
broader application?
MR. HAMBRIGHT;
QUESTION:

You said that in those early NLRB cases ~

MR. HAMBRIGHT;
QUESTION:

Mr. Justice —

Yes, sir.

— which were decided, on© in 1947, on© in

1948, and cm© in 19:49, I think, you said they ware different
because theyiinvolved two competing, two or more competing
states

whereas- in this case you just have the State of Texas

eu the one hand vis-a-vis no state on the other hand.
MR. HAMBRIGHT;
QUESTION:

That is correct. Your Honor.

IT: w. is this a cas© that just involves

that, the State of Texas, a state versus no stata, or should it

41
— do os its impact go further, two cases involving competition
between or among two or more states?
MR. HAMBRIGHT:

Mr. Justice Stewart, 1 think absolute­

ly the case only involvas Texas vis-a-vis the admiralty.

There

is no showing that any substantial part of the administration
of -this labor contract occurs elsewhere.

In the matter of

money, for instance, this $6 million, the proof shows that only
$67,000 was disbursed from any other office, less than one per­
cent.

So it is so tied in with the State of Texas that you

really need not bit© off any more than just 'that on© problem.
That is our —
QUESTION*

But there is no competition impossible be-

t.wsen states, is there?

If the state doesn't have a right to

work law, the federal lav? governs, so it is always the question
of either state or federal law, it is not a question of which
■state law, it is & question of state or federal law, isn’t it?

them and taking soma more, what would you say about that?
MR. golds

Our theory» Mr. Chief Justice» th© result

ought to b© the same because the work would b© on .American flag
vessels, where 80 or 90 percent of the work was being dm® on
th© high seas and w© think that that is a £©d©ral jurisdiction
equivalent to th® District of Columbia.
flay I very quickly, if I have the time, make two
points:

First of all, up until 19S2» this employer had its

fettdquarterr- in New York.

All of the administrativa details

that are now performed in Texas were performed in New York, but
th® work that the covered employees did then, as now, was 80
percent on the high seas.

We don't understand» if we look at

this in terms of the covered employees and their situation» why
tier® should b® a different result because th© employer uni­
laterally is doing his paperwork and other such aspects of its
business in on© state or another.

terstand and to find the facts about is wh®r© is the work
don©» where is th© work being done.

44
Standard the board applied in those older cases —
MR. GOLD :

Yes.

QUESTION:

— the headquarters sort of approach?

MR. GOLD:

Yes, Your Honor? because —

QUESTION:

That certainly involved more than where the

work was done.
MR. GOLD:

Well? Mr. Justice White? the first case? as

I have indicated, was the Giant Food case? where you had em­
ployees who stayed in a. particular place? half of them in
Virginia and half in the District of Columbia? and the board
said that the job site was controlling.

Then in the more com­

plicated situation? where you could not say with assurance
where the preponderance of the work was? they want to the stand­
ard that you are discussing? and we agree with both of those
holdings.

We think they are as sound and as close to equity as

one is going to gat in this area.
And the last point I would like to make is that we
era not arguing that maritime employees are exempt from right
to work laws.

As I have indicated in trying to answer Mr.

Justice Relinquish's questions? we think it is an entirely dif­
ferent matter if they are working in territorial waters and xm
don't think that this cas® gets into that.
And finally? just to give an analogy, bo far r.s I
understand it? casinos are only legally run in Nevada, that is

& right to work state.

The job situs of those employess is

Nevada.
QUESTION?

Well, how about the workers os. the drilling

MR. GOLDs

On the drilling platforms, I would say

platforms?

that it depended on the location of the drilling platforms.

In

application of one of your cases, whose name escapes me now,
wh©r© the Court went into the question of the extent to which
under a statute of Congress, those are an extension of the
state within the federal maritime jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, would your argument be the same

if these krukers stayed within territorial waters all the way
up the coast?
MR. GOLD;

No, Your Honor, X think that in that case

you would b«a into the situation —
QUESTION;

The state?

MR. GOLD:

That's right, and it would be like bus

drivers driving through many states and 'fell© headquarters test
of the Greyhound case would apply.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The

case is submitted.
{Whereupon, at 2:15 o’clock p.m., the above-entitled
case was submitted.]
