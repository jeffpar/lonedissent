MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear arguments

next in No. 74~775, The City of New Orleans against Nancy
Duke.
Mr. Loeffelholz.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL P. LOEFFELHOLZ, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The first issue presented by this matter is one
of jurisdiction.

We are here before this Court today under

the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 1254 subparagraph two which comes
from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, the original case
being heard by the United States District

Court

for the

-Eastern District of Louisiana on an attack upon one of our
city ordinances regulating street vendors and hawkers

in

the historical disttrict known as the Vieux Carre or French
Quarter of the City of New Orleans.
That particular ordinance holds and provides that
•j

holders of permits not valid for eight previous years may
not receive or apply for and get another permit for the
coining year, what we would commonly call a .(Grandfather
Clause.B
The District Court, on cross-motion for summary
judgment, held in our favor.

The Fifth Circuit Court of

Appeals after placing us on their summary calendar,, reversed,
holding that the ordinance — the ordinance's Grandfather
Clause was unconstitutional as applied.
We filed a direct appeal to this Court under 1254,2.
Now, under 1254.2, a municipal ordinance that is
well-established by this time, it can be

considered as a

statute because 1254.2 merely provides for direct appeal
from a Court of Appeals judgment which holds a state statute
invalid.
The jurisprudence over the years has established
one other requirement, this requirement being that the
judgment of the Court of Appeals be a final judgment and
what is "final" has been indeed an elusive question down
through the jurisprudence.
Most recently, after my brief was filed, this
Court, in Dorn versus Salem Inn« did not-recognize

. \

the fact that this question is, indeed, a hard question.
All of the cases that I have been able to find,
mainly Cox, MTM versus Miami, Baxley -- I'm sorry, MTM versus
Baxley, North Dakota Board versus Snyder's Drug and Miami
Herald

versus Torniilo, seem to distill it down to one

question.
If the Court of Appeals does finally determine
the constitutional question before it and therefore the
question will not survive the remand and the remand has no

5

material effect on the federal constitutional issue, then,
for purposes of 1254,2, direct appeal to this Honorable
Court, that is a final judgment,
QUESTION:

Mr. Loeffelholz, where all that really

is involved on this jurisdictional point is whether you
should come here by appeal or by certiorari, isn't it?
MR, LOEFFELHOLZ:

That is correct, Mr, Justice

REhnquist, and we would also submit that the City of El Paso
case would allow you to treat this matter as a matter on
certiorari as well but at any rate, the Fifth Circuit Court
of Appeals8 opinion did finally determine that the Grand­
father Clause is unconstitutional as it appears in that
particular city ordinance.
The only thing left for the District Court to
decide is whether that particular provision of the city
ordinance is severable from the ordinance's general
preclusion of hot dog pushcart

vendors in the French Quarter.

There can be no question that the ordinance does
create some form of statutory discrimination.

That is

well-established and conceded.
However, not all statutory discriminations are
violative of the Fourth Amendment, as this Court has taught
in many, many cases.

States are afforded wide latitude in

the area of regulation, of their streets under the police
power

and presumption of validity must be presumed at the

6

time of the legislative enactment.
To be unconstitutional, there must be some form
of invidious discrimination based upon some totally arbitrary
ground which bears no rational relation to the legitimate
government ends sought by the legislation.
The case

the Fifth Circuit relied upon heavily

in its decision was Morey versu3 Doud and Morey versus Doud,
which was in 1957, some time ago, set forth four distinct
requirements to be looked into before a statutue is declared
unconstitutional.
It starts out by stating the proposition that the
Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment does not take
from the state the power to classify any adoption of police
laws but admits of the exercise of a wide scope of discretion
in that regard and avoids what is done only when it was
without any reasonable basis and therefore arbitrary.
The second criteria established by Morey is that
the classification, having some reasonable basis, does not
offend against the Fourteenth Amendment merely because it is
not made with some mathematical nicety or because in practice
it results in some form of inequality.
The third criteria is that when the classification
in such law is called in question, if any state of fact —
and this is important — can reasonably be conceived that
would sustain it — the existence of that state of facts at

7
the time the law was enacted must be assumed.

The legislature,

the legislative body, we are talking about judicial restraint
at this point, the legislative body, which is the embodiment
of the whole entire City of New Orleans, the council's
judgment must be presumed to have been valid at the time that
the ordinance was enacted.
So what we come down to actually —
QUESTION:

Well, I take it you feel Morey against

Dauci has no application here at all.
MR. LOEFPELHOLZ:

Well, Mr., Justice Blackmun, I

feel that it has application in that it is the guiding
principle.

It sets forth very succinctly what the legion of

cases seem to all be saying in different ways.

It sets out

the requirements which we must investigate and the investigation we must proceed upon very succinctly in one,, two,
three, four terms.
QUESTION:

But you didn't cite it in your brief.

MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

I mentioned it, I believe.

I

did not cite it.
QUESTIONs

Well, you did in your jurisdictional

statement but I
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:
QUESTION:

I stand corrected.

~ I don't recall that it is in your

brief at all so I assume you felt it had no application.
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

Well, I feel that as far as the

law is concerned, it may have application in the area

of

the Equal Protection argument and I feel that the Fifth
Circuit Court of Appeals, rightly so, looked at those
requirements as expressed in Morey versus Doud but their
interpretation of it strongly differs from ours„
What we must do, therefore, in the area of Equal
Protection arguments, is weigh the society's interest, and
the society is you and me and everyone else, against a
particular individual's interest to see if the societal inter
is
est is compelling and this/important again and therefore
predominant over the individual's rights and privileges,,
If the state interest is compelling, then the
legislation will and must be upheld.
QUESTION:

Well, why are we talking about whether

or not the state's interest is compelling when you are
simply dealing with ordinary economic legislation?

I thought

that the test you read earlier is that if any set of facts
can be conceived even hypothetically that would justify the
legislature's actions, the law will be sustained.
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:
QUESTION:

Well —

That's the McGowan against Maryland

test.
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

That is the McGowan test,

Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

Yes, isn't that what controls here?

9

MR. Io IFFELHOLZ:

That should control.

As far as

our argument is concerned,, we hope it controls and it is,
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, as you pointed out, economic
legislation, which is what we are dealing with here.
We have the French

Quarter of New Orleans and we

have an area that must be regulated in some way, shape or
form and the way that it is chosen to be regulated definitely
deals upon economics and finance.
QUESTION:

Well, now, the rationality test did

not save the exception in the Illinois statute in Morey and
t

Doud.
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:
QUESTION:

No, it did not.

And you have gotten out of Persuadis,

I gather, that even though it

did not there, the grandfather

clause here is saved by the rationality test.
MR. I/isFFELHOLZ:

Is that it?

Well, that is what it boils

down to, Mr. Justice Brennan.

That is correct.

And as far

as -- if I may return for a second to answer Mr. Justice
Rehnquist's question on the economic legislation, we do
have economic legislation here.
We don't have individual fundamental rights per
se in question.

The Levy versus Louisiana, Palmer versus

Thompson, San An .onio School District versus Rodriguez and
legrons of cases all held that there are no- constitutional
guaj.ai.uees

-ghts

to financial and economic equality,

10

only that all persons similarly circumstanced be treated
alike.
QUESTION:

Well, now., here you have, I gather, a

hot dog vendor Lucky somathing-or-other, wasn't it?
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:
QUESTION:

Lucky Dogs, that’s right.

Lucky Dogs and they have been doing

business in the French Quarter for eight years or more.

Is

that right?
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:
QUESTION:

Well, over eight years in any event.

MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:
QUESTION:

Twenty-two years.

Yes, sir.

And this particular Appellee has been a

competitor of Lucky Dogs for only two years.
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

Right?

No, sir, that is not correct.

This particular Appellee is not a competitor of Lucky Dogs.
In volume —
QUESTION:

But it has been doing business for

about two years.
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

Well, it has bean doing

business for about two years but if you would look at volume
one of the Appendix, page 80 and 81, which is all the
District Court had before it when it decided, and the Fifth
Circuit had before it as well, this is the entire record.
The sworn affidavit — the sworn affidavit of
Miss Dukes and her only employee, Mr. Frank D. Siliker,

11
state that their only business -- and I go to the middle of
the first paragraph of Mr» Siliker's affidavit on page 80 -—
their only business, which business"consists of selling
drinks, confections and novelties."
It does not mention hot dogs.

It mentions cold

drinks, confections — meaning, I would imagine, candy -— and
novelties such as, I guess, stuffed animals, horns, buttons,
whatever.

It does not mention hot dogs and that 13 signifi­

cant because in the French Quarter of New Orleans over so
many years, the hot dog peddler, peddlers, whatever you
want to call them, have bean distilled down to this one
company and I would say that the factual determination
contained in these affidavits certainly would not put
Mrs. Dukes and Mr. Siliker on the same footing or in the
same class as Lucky Dogs.
Well, isn't the argument that this is a reasonable
classification, chat hot dogs may be classified one way and
soft drinks peddlers another?
MR. LOWFFLER:

13 that it?

That is correct, and as the Fifth

Circuit, in their decision, at footnote — on page TO9
footnote 2 -- and I quote — the Fifth Circuit itself says
that Dukes appears no longer seriously to press her original
attack on discrimination between vendors of different types
of goods.
In any case, we have no difficulty in concluding

12
that such an Equal Protection claim on Dukes part could not
withstand analysis

and they cite McGowan and this is all wa

are saying in the instant matter, that Mrs. Dukes is not
within the same protected class, she is not similarly
circumstanced as the

one of the only two people who do

qualify under the ordinance8s grandfather clause.
Now, the economic legislation argument is
important„
The 14th Amendment, we feel, was designed to
protect those fundamental and personal rights and not
economic interests and privileges.
The reason behind this statute or any other
statute must

deal with policy

policy of the Government

and with this in mind in the weighing test, which I have
stated before, let us see what interest the City of New
Orleans has in this legislation and if that interest is
indeed compelling enough to overcome the incidental
discrimination which is imposed,
QUESTION:

Mr, Loeffelhols, why do we weigh any

interest in this Court in connection with legislation like
that?

Isn’t that the job for the legislature or the city

council, to pick out an interest and support it?
I mean, what if they wanted to give Lucky Dogs
a monopoly in the Viaux Carre?
t hat

Is there anything wrong with

under the Fourteenth Amendment?

13
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

No, sir, there is not, as long

as the interest of the council was rationally guided and
it does further a legitimate governmental interest.
QUESTION:

And how do we determine what a

legitimate governmental interest is?
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

Well, I would submit this,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, as you pointed cut, that it is not the
function of the judiciary to determine that.
QUESTION:

I listen —

Morey and Soud said that kind of a

monopoly couldn’t withstand a Fourteenth Amendment -MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

That is correct, but I believe

Morey versus Doud stated that that type of unregulated
monopoly could not —
QUESTION:
without license ■—

Well, the only one allowed to sell
whatever- they were involved with, I’ve

forgotten now — was American Express Company.
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

That is correct, but I think

that -QUESTION:

By name, American Express Company.

Mho LOEFFELHOLZ:

And Lucky Dogs is absolutely

not mentioned in that ordinance and there is a very good
reason for that because of the fact —
QUESTION:

Well, does the ordinance save anybody

except Lucky Dogs?
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

Yes, sir, there is one other

14
person.

His name is — the name escapes me but it is an

ice cream vendor in the Jackson Square area who has been
there some 20-sorae-odd years»

He was the only other person

which was saved by the ordinance and I ■—
QUESTION:

Any vendor, no matter what he sells, in

the French Quarter, I gather, whe has been selling over eight
years, can continue to sell»

It is only vendors of —

vendors, period»
MR» LOEFFELHOLZ:

That is correct and I think we

have to look at the overall scheme, Mr» Justice Brennan,
because —
QUESTION:

No, but the distinction here, I gather,

is vendors, street vendors in the ■— no matter what they sell
they
and / would if they were selling over eight years, I gather,
be allowed to continue selling.
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

Is that right?

That is correct except there is

a general preclusion of all vendors in the French Quarter
except certain classes of vendors, as the ordinance so states.
I will admit that the ordinance may be inartfully
drawn but not so inartfully drawn as to render it unconsti­
tutional.
Certainly there are certain vendors, I believe,
provided for in the ordinance other than hot dogs and hot
dogs, actually, is not provided in the ordinance and I think
you have to read both clauses of the same pciragraph of the

15
ordinance to show, just as you stated, that if you have been
there more than eight years, you can stay.

If you have not,

you will not be allowed in that area and now the central
business district, which encompasses the French Quarter, as
well.
QUESTION:

What’s her ;.iame, Mrs. Dukes?

She

doesn't sell ice cream.
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:
don’t know.

As far as I know she doesn’t.

Confections may be ice cream.

depends upon your interpretation.

I

I really — it

Factually, I don't know.

At any rate, the waiting process must be had here
and as I started to pcint out before, whexx the city council
passed its ordinance, we must, under Morey versus Doud, as it
teaches us, we must presume that their rationale was valid
and invoke that presumption at the time the ordinance was
passed.
The reason behind the ordinance is very clear.
is crystal clear, really.
French

It

The historic district of the

Quarter is the oldest historic district continually

in existence that I am able to discover in this country.
is 260 years old.

It

It has been the same since the beginning —

since its beginning.

It has not changed appreciably, other

than, I would imagine, paving of streets, at cetera, but it
has not changed appreciably and it is the quaint, unique,
very

delicate mixture of both residential and economic

16

interests in that area which make it the heart of the city.
QUESTION:
can't change it.

You can't change it.

The law says you

When you repair,, you have to put up the

same railing you put down.
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

That is correct, sir.

The

Constitution of the State of Louisiana provides for the
extablishrnent of the Vieux Carre Commission which governs the
exterior of all buildings, streets,

et cetera in that French

Quarter and you can't change it, by law.
It is that important.

It is the heart; the

economic heart throb of the City of New Orleans is the French
Quarter.

The whole city surrounds the French Quarter. Hotel

and motel construction in the French Quarter is a good
indication of real estate values and is a good indication
of the economic conditions and important contribution this
area makes'to the City

of Naw Orleans tax base.

The area is close to the city's employment and
entertainment centers as well and many small businesses are
established there to cater to the needs of local residents who
live there, as well as the tourists tvho flow there, and
citizen alike, by the thousands daily.
So we have a fairly unique situation.

It is much

akin, as I pointed out in my brief, to the Georgetown area
of Washington and what it does for the City of Washington, D.C.
and the single most important factor in the French Quarter's

17
economy is its retailing.
A large number of the many antique shops, gift
stores, theatres, restaurants, nationally famous bars,
restaurants, et cetera, are centered here and support from
these establishments comes mainly from tourists and citizens
who are charmed by this historic district sc we are talking
about not only favoring someone over1 someone else, we are
talking about national historic preservation and we have a
vested interest in this national historic preservation.
If that is not a valid and compelling interest,
we don't know what is and when the Fifth Circuit declined to
even balance the test and said it is enough that the
Constitutional infirmities that they saw overcame any
balancing necessary, 1 believe they erred gravely because
this area is the most important area of the City, of New
Orleans„
The City definitely, therefore, has a valid,
compelling interest in maintaining the French Quarter's
physical, social and economic potential.
Preservation and protection, to be of any
significance at all must encompass both the physical and
functional elements of the French Quarter that contribute
to its identity and environmental unity.

You can’t just say,

like, Mr. Justice Marshall, as you pointed out, we'll make
the buildings stay the same and leave everything else

18

unregulated because if you did that, then people would
probably come there, both citizen and tourist alike and say,
well, the buildings sure are pretty but I am being troubled
and hassled and jostled on the street by so many either
street peddlers or whatever that they wouldn't come back
and it would begin to deteriorate»
QUESTION:

Well, isn't everything you say —

wouldn't it be as applicable, if not more so, if these street
peddlers were all eliminated and had no grandfather clause?
Isn't this the crux of your problem?
MR. LOEFPELIIOLZ:

This is the crux of our problem,

Mr. Justice Blackmun and I would state that it may well be
in the regulatory scheme of things that after Lucky Dogs and
this other fella failed to qualify, go out of business or
whatever, there will be no peddlers in the French Quarter on
the street, which we maintain we can constitutionally
regulate.
QUESTION:

Is Lucky Dogs ■—• do they have more

than one of these carts?
MR, LOEFFELHOLZ:
18.

I believe they have about 1? or

They definitely have more than one.
QUESTION:

Is it a corporation?

MR. LOEFFELHOLZ;
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, it is a corporation.

It is likely to be there quite a long

time if it has virtually a monopoly, isn't it?

19

MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

Well, it has been there 22 years

and you are correct when you say it may be a legislative
monopoly insofar as hot dog peddler’s are concerned.
QUESTION:

And what about this other vendor, the

ice cream vendor?
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

He may be out of business.

is an individual in the Jackson Square area.
cream.

He

He sells ice

He is a very colorful individual, as an aside.

People seek him out to photograph, et cetera.
QUESTION:

Is there any limit on the* number of

carts that Lucky Dog can put in —■ 125 tomorrow, if they
wanted to?
QUESTION:
no limit.

No, sir, Mr. Justice Blackmun, there is

Again, this is what the Fifth Circuit seemed to

be saying when they talked about -- excuse me, in their
decision that the city may well regulate in another way than
that; which was accomplished such as limiting the number, the
sise, the way they looked, et cetera, but this is judicial
legislation and we feel strongly that the

presumption of the

city council must be — must override that judicial legisla­
tion and judicial restraint should be practiced in this
particular matter.
QUESTION:

The question I wanted to ask was, let’s

assume for the moment that Dukes had gone into business in
the Latin Quarter at precisely the same time that Lucky Dog

20

went into business and that both conducted business in
substantially the same manner.

Would the city council of

New Orleans have had authority to decide which one of those
two vendors should remain in business?
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

Well, Mr. Justice Powell, under

this ordinance obviously it would not make a difference but
under the hypothet and I think possibly under the Duke
decision, if it was — and the decisions that flow from the
Duke — if it was determined in the legislative body’s
wisdom that the maintenance cf one individual over

another

would further the industry and that the competition would
kill the industry, then 1 believe that that was a legitimate
and valid and rationally-guided decision.

Then it certainly

would be within their power under those cases to favor one
over the other.
We don't have that situation here but in answer to
your question I believe we could validly enact such type of
legislation.
QUESTION:

So that the grandfather clause aspect

of this case really is immaterial to your position in theory?
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

In theory it is, yes, sir, it is,

in theory.
QUESTION:

And what cases?

What cases?
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

Ladue

You said "those cases."

21
QUESTION:

Ladue?

MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

It is Ladue Local Lines versus

Bi-State and Nebbia versus New York.

They are cited in my

brief.
QUESTION:

All right.

MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

Thank you.

Simply stated, therefore, when a

weighing process is involved effecting the long-range
economic welfare of an entire city -- and in the shape that
the nation's cities are in today, we'll all recognize that we
must give some form of judicial — we must give some form of
judicial recognition to the legislature's wisdom in this area
because cities today are in bad financial shape and so we must
weigh the cities interests as opposed to the short-range
desires of one individual and therefore the judgment of the
city council, which is the representative of the people, must,
in this matter, be given a wide latitude and liberal con­
struction unless it is patently offensive to the notions of
equal protection and fair play which, we submit, it is not.
I wou.=,d reserve any further time I have for
rebuttal, if necessary.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Loeffelholz.
Mr. Marcal.

Very well,

22

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH N. MARCAL, III, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE
MR. MARCAL:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I would like to first begin by pointing out that
when you consider the legislative history of this permit law,
it takes on an entirely different aspect as presented by the
city.
This is not simply an identification of a public
interest, a sending out of bids,

obtaining people to bid on

a Lucky Dog push cart or whatever may be that particular
interest.

This legislative history, as I tried to point

out and outline in my brief, is nothing but an indication
to me of what I would, in best terms, describe as legislative
chicanery and I followed this permit ordinance through other
controversies and if I can back up and demonstrate first to
the Court, as I have tried to touch in my brief, where the
City of New Orleans is

doing something other than it would

pretend in this situation, that is, preserve the charm and
beauty of the Vieux Carre.
Firstly, the City of New Orleans, long ago in
1942, treated with its permit ordinance in a legitimate
effort to regulate peddlers on the street and people who
generally go about the streets of New Orleans hawking their
wares or attempting to sell their wares,,

23
It was not about until around 1970 — as I treat
in my brief —- that the city first began to regulate such
things as religious activity, benevolence in education among
the streets of the Vieux Carre =
It is no cooincidence that at the same time that
the

city took upon itself to

legislate and actually prohibit

religious activity on the streets of the Vie ux Care

which

#

precipitated a case before the eastern district of Louisiana
which I did handle and was successful in denouncing that
particular ordinance as it restricted the religious activity,
but they also took upon themselves to begin to create -first they created exemptions.
They raid, generally all permits- are banned from
the French Quarter, except the following exemptions, and
this is where they began in their scheme, their discriminatory
scheme.
Now, whether or not that
am not

was correct or not, I

going to deal with at this time,

That is not the

issue here but I am giving the Court, hopefully, an idea of
the background and reiterating the background.
They said all permits are banned with the
exception of the following, paragraph 5, which is the
important and crucial paragraph dealing with hot tamale and
push —- hot tamale push carts and hot tamale and hot dog push
carts and the like.

24
They were satisfied with this for a time.

Now,

at the time that they passed the ordinance, which is in the
latter part of 1971, Nancy Dukes was operating her
selling foodstuffs, hot dogs, cotton candy,
the like on the street.
QUESTION:

push cart

confections and

She was selling hot dogs.

Mr. Marcal, your brother on the other

side has pointed to an affidavit in this record indicating
that your client was not in direct competition with Lucky
Dogs, that her push cart, indeed, aid not sell hot dogs.
MR. MARCAL:

That is a term of a phrase, Justice

Stewart, which I feel is unfortunate.

I did not supervise

the confection of that document but —
QUESTION:
MR. MARCAL:
undoubtedly.

It does.

That is what the record shows.
That is what the record shows,
My understanding and appreciation

was that she was selling hot dogs, among other things.
QUESTION:

We have to decide this on the record,

now, don't we?
MR. MARCAL:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
And therefore, so far as Judge Goldberg8s

opinion for the Court of Appeals states -- and it does state
in the first sentence — that your client maintained a
push cart business in the Vieux

Carre of New Orleans selling

hot dogs, drinks, confections and novelties, that is simply
mistaken, so far as the record goes when it says "hot dogs, 88

25

Well, I have in mind, though, Counsel,

that the very first proposition stated in Nebbia against
New York, a leading case sited by your brother, states no

She does not

She never has and never suggested that she

sold merely hot dogs.

She sold other foodstuffs and thus

you have the two-prong attack.
Unfortunately, the first attack, that is, the
discriminatory treatment as to the other exemptions, was
the only attack contained in the original complaint.
Subsequent, in an amending complaint, with the
amendments brought on by the city council, there was indicated
that the grandfather clause was also objectionable and of
course there were also statements of material facts
contained in the record.

I certainly hope I can, sir»
Well, we'll give you a little leeway, or

frankfurters.
QUESTION:
mean?

Well, what does the word '"confection"

That is a pretty generally broad one.
MR. MARCAL:

I would think it would be sugar-based

foodstuffs that would be generally sold.

I have relied

heavily on foodstuffs in arguing this.
By the way, there was no indication, to my
knowledge, that — before the Fifth Circuit, of an objection
to the statement throughout my brief before the Fifth
Circuit, that we were dealing with hot dogs and it only
comes before your Honors now.

I think this issue could have

been pointed out before the Fifth Circuit at least by my
brother opponent.
If X may get back to what I consider as a treat­
ment of the facts in this case as relates to the law.
First, the city dealt

with its exemptions and

they said "All permits are banned with the following
exemptions, ’’ and paragraph b was x.ue exemption which dealt
with the hot tamale and hot dog push cart.
They said you could obtain a permit to do this in
the French Quarter area.
Well, lo and behold, ir.v client, acting under the
assumption that they have authority not, only to sell hot

30

doqs

they took it upon themselves, other foodstuffs ——
l

but they were selling hot dogs at the time of her arrest.
One of her employees, in January of 1972, was
arrested for selling hot dogs and foodstuffs in the Vieux
Carre, in the face of this very specific paragraph 5
exemption from the general ban in the French Quarter and, of
course, this made her very wary. As indicated in the record,
these charges were ultimately dismissed.
Subsequent to that, in April of 1972, t)here appears
the grandfather clause which says that all persons as of
January of 1972

it was retroactive, but passed in April

of 1972 —"All persons prior to Jemuary of '72 who have not
operated in the Vieux Carre area for more than eight years
cannot obtain any permits," aside from the fact they did
create some -- they still had the exemptions there.
Now, this lawsuit was filed in Amgust of 1972.
Subsequent to that time, the city again amended its statute
and deleted, paragraph five, the hot dog and hot tamale push
cart exemption.

And I submit that that is an indication

that they had a particular specific design as to hot dogs and
hot tamale pushcarts.

They wanted to favor them very

specifically.
Mow, why didn’t they do the same thing for the
flower vendors in the Quarter?

They are exempted.

I think

that is In paragraph four below but paragraph 45 or 35 or

31

something like that.
No, they concentrated on the hot dog and hot
tamale pushcart exemption because, obviously, they ssaw the
conilict there, that we could not on one hand grant them an
exemption but than on the other hand taka it away with the
eight-year grandfather clause.

As to the mention of hot dogs and foodstuffs, in
the lower court, the statement of material facts at page 78
of Appendix Volume I submitted by the City indicates in a
statement made by then attorney representing Ms. Dukes,

the name of Louisiana Concessions and is engaged in the sale
and distribution of foodstuffs, drinks, confections and
novelties and at page 84 of the same Volume I *—

84, Mr. Loeffelholz, then still representing the city,indicated the same thing in a separate statement of material
facts, that Plaintiff Nancy Dukes was engaged in the sale and
distribution of foodstuffs, drinks and confections and
novelties.
I submit that hot dogs are within foodstuffs.

33

Further, I also submit that whether or not -- oh,
excuse me.
QUESTION:

Why did Judge Goldberg, then, in his

opinion, so pointedly emphasize the revision of its
ordinances removing hot dog vendors from the list, if that is
not important.

If the

distinction between —It was —- oh, excuse me, Mr. Chief

I would suggest that it was a point of reference

by Judge Goldberg in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and
I submit that ultimately it is irrelevant to these issues
insofar

as we have an unconstitutional statute which I

submit not only is unconstitutional in its application but
also on its face.
Getting to the statute itself and aside from the
arguments on jurisdiction,

which I have submitted in brief

form and I would not dwell on that particular issue, the
unusual character of this discrimination

created, while it

does not make it subject to the language of the court cited
in ^^9 ve*-sus Button, NAACP versus Button or any such cases
where they are dealing with the elected franchises very, very
fundamental rights, nevertheless, I siibmit that the language
of Morey versus Poud and nothing is taken away from Morey by
McGowan, I submit, I argue to the Court, that there must be
some relationship between the objects sought in the statute
and the discrimination created by the statute.

It is —

34
QUESTION:

Mr „ Marcal,

how do you know what the

object sought is in a statute?
MR. MARCAL:

The object as stated by the city on

appeal, Justice Rehnquist.

That is, to preserve the charm

and beauty of the Vieux Carre.
stand.

It is beyond myself to under-

I do not understand how eight years — as I have

pointed out in the brief — of spreading the mustard on hot
dogs somehow or other is going to contribute more to the
charm cind beauty of the Vieux Carre than really, one year or
a year and a hail of doing the exact same thing on the part of
Ms. Dukes.
QUESTION:

What if they just wanted one hot dog

peddler in the Vieux Carre?
MR. MARCAL;

Very well, if that is what they

wanted, what they could have done -- which they did not do
and this statute does not do — they could have set standards
of behavior for hot dog salesmen which promote the charm and
beauty of the Vieux Carre.
QUESTION:

This ---

Well, what if the city council sits dGwn

and decides, we don't want five we11-behaved hot dog vendors.
We want one well-behaved hot dog vendor.

Is there anything

unconstitutional about that?
MR. MARCAL

I would suggest that that be a

regulation and that opportunity would be given to all
individuals who apply for that position to be the one

35

well-behaved hot dog vendor.
QUESTION:

Is that a constitutional requirement?

Who owns the Astrodome in New Orleans?
MR. MARCAL:
QUESTION:

It is the Superdome.
The Superdome?

MR. MARCAL:

It is owned by the State of

Louisiana.
QUESTION:

Well, does the State of Louisiana have

to have public bidding on its concessions there or can it
just pick somebody out and say the Superdome can only
accommodate one concessionaire, you are it, period.
MR. MARCAL:

There is a great deal of

question

as to whether or not they have complied with Louisiana

law

but my understanding is that there is a requirement for public
bidding in Louisiana.
: i *v'

QUESTION:

v

Well, supposing there weren't?

As a

matter of federal constitutional law would there be a
requirement for public bidding?
MR. MARCAL;

I think that the operation of Morey

versus Doud, McGowan e and the language of this Court
consistently reiterated would come into play that when you
/

seek to regulate someone’s right to earn a living which is
certainly one of the privileges and immunities granted to
each individual citizen of this country, you

must base your

discriminatory scheme upon some rational basis which promotes

36

what you are trying to protect, your public interest created
and I don't think that any ordinance or any city council or
any state legislature can simply decide that it is going to
favor one man over another person for no other reason other
than, it desires to favor him»
Now, X suspect that the city council —- X feel
that the city council only had one purpose and it was not to
promote the charm and beauty of the Vieux Carre, it was
simply to favor Lucky Dogs and I point to the legislative
history behind this particular ordinance»
It doesn't speak to the deliberation about what is
•K

4

the public interest in the Vieux Carre? What should we do
about this problem?

There is great --- it is taken for

granted by myself that it is one of the interests of the City
vof New Orleans to protect the Vieux Carre.
However, the manner in
is simply

which they proceed, that

saying, well, if you have been there £of,eight

years it is all right.

You can continue to be there.
i ■

Now, how that promotes, how that can be made to
promote in anyone's mind the charm and beauty of the Vieux
Carre is beyond me.
There are no standards
thesepush carts or the

hot dogs,

as to design and decor of
what type of hot dogs, what

grade of hot dogs.
There are no standards of behavior for the hot dog

37

salesmen»

There are not even minimal health standards

applicable to the sale of hot dogs which somehow or other
would promote the charm and beauty of the Viaux Carre»
There is none of this»

All we have is a rather

colored legislative history which I detailed in my brief
before this Court: and before the Firth Circuit, which, I
might add, your Honors, was not mentioned before the lower
court in any detail whatsoever»
The first time that a United States court of any
moment had before it the legislative history was before the
Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, before the lower court and I
did not represent this lady before the lower court.
There was not one mention of the legislative
history.

There was not one detail on how this particular

ordinance evolved into its present state.
QUESTION;
MR. MARCAL:
QUESTIONS

There was no —

Whose fault is that?
Excuse me'?
Whose fault is that?

Arid what does it have to do with our issues now?
MR. MARCAL:

The issues now I

would submit that

the legislative Mstory is very importasit to the Court's
consideration because I think it, in and of itself, belies
the statement that this particular ordinance promotes the
charm and beauty of the Vieux Carre.
ordinance

There is nothing in that

if anything, there is a canning trend apparent in

38

the ordinances to simply get rid of what the City of New
Orleans considers undesireables.

In one case they thought

it was the Hari Krishna people going about the Vieux Carre
and in another instance it happens to be the flower people.
All of these exemptions did not come about merely
because the City of New Orleans decided that these exemptions
promote the charm and beauty,

Each one of them practically

has a story behind it, the ice cream vendor, a story of
litigation, the flower salesman has a long history of
litigation behind it.

“

I mean, this is not such a thoughtful, objective
consideration of what is in the best interests of the charm
/

and beauty of the Vieux Carre, and I want to point that out
because much is vague of the charm and beauty of the Vieux
Carre.
I think the legislative history belies that, besides
the act itself.

There are no standards set.

There is no

reasonable relationship between the discrimination — that is,
if you have been there for eight years, you can sell hot
dogs, but you can't if you have been any less and the charm
and beauty of the Vieux Carre, how is it promoted?
Being a lifelong resident of the City of New
Orleans, I can say, as I have stated in the brief, that these
hot deg push carts in no way contribute to the charm and
beauty.

39

I think that much was made in the Appendices
provided by myself in the jurisdictional statement and the
City of New Orleans in its — attached to its brief —- of the
character of these push carts.

They don’t land to the charm

and beauty of the Vieux Carre which is that most of the
architecture goes back to the 1703's and the 1800’s, as
New Orleans was then, it has been preserved and then we have
what subsequently followed, which I mentioned in the brief,
that the city expanded the operation of this ordinance, this
grandfather clause, not only it went beyond the

Vieux Carre

area, it went to the central business district.
Now, as it stands, though it was not che case when
this case was decided in the lower court and X point this out
to demonstrate that this is a bogus suggestion made by the
city that this promotes the charm and beauty — now, the
grandfather clause operates not only in the Vieux Carre but
in the central business district, which has no relationship
to the -- there

is nothing charming or beautiful about

concrete and asphalt and this — the city continues to do
things and pass ordinances subsequent to this which really
contradict

their position here taken today and I think the

Court should be apprised of that and now she can't even sell
Ms. Dukes can't even sell in the central business district
and now there might be a different reason for that, I don’t
know.

Who knows why, but

40
QUESTION:
MR. MARCAL:

Is that in the record, Mr. Marcal?
That is in the record.

I cited those

particular ordinances and put them in my Appendices.
QUESTION:

So she is not, in fact, engaged in

business there?
MR. MARCAL:

I stated in the brief, Mr. Chief

Justice, that she is not in there , though it is not in the
record because at the time she could have possibly gone into
the central business district but I point this out simply to
reiterate the point that this is not a serious position
taken by the City of New Orleans that somehow or other
allowing hot dog salesmen to be in any place in the city
simply because he has been there eight years which just
happens to coincide with the fact that no one has been there
longer than eight years who was selling hot dogs or any
other thing — that doesn’t somehow add to the charm and beauty
of the VieuK Carre.
i mean, they first set the reason for this
legislation and I would submit that they are making a suit to
fit a man, they are taking a man that is Lucky Dogs and having
him fit the law

md it is an afterthought and that is all that

this is and it is: nothing more than a bare faced monopoly and
it is not like the situation of Ladue cited by my brother
opponent insofar as there, you had a situation of a creation
of a monopoly of a — of a statewide monopoly for the transit

41

system, granted there was a legitimate state interest to
maintain a transit system which was reliable which could be
controlled by a state agency and in that situation undoubtedly
there were bids put out.
position or whatever,

Somebody had to qualify

for that

There were qualifications and there

was a standard set.
Here we don't have any of that.

All of a sudden in

the middle of April in 1972, they pass a law retroactive to
January of '72 and said everybody who was here, was here
beyond eight years past and going back to January of 1972
can stay here and Ms. Dukes, you have only bean here for two
years and you can't stay here.
That is irrational.

To allow these people to do

this would allow them to run roughshod over other individuals
of the calibre of Ms. Duke who obviously, I think the Court
can take notice, is not financially well-heeled and is a
small person as opposed to Lucky Dogs.
And I would say, as to monopolies, they are
generally created only after an interest is established — an
interest which here is protection of the charm and beauty of
the Vieux Carre but still you cannot ■— though you can
establish a monopoly, you still cannot get away from the
language of Morey v» Bond and McGowan.

You have to establish

some rational relationship between the discrimination and the
particular purpose of the law.

There has to be some

42
supportive -— some facts that support this discrimination
and here we find none except that it is supposed to support
the charm and beauty of the Vieux Carre.
Using some of the language of Judge Goldberg, it
is

inconceivable

to me how favoring a venerable hot dog

vendor with the skins of eight seasons over one with merely
the

skins of two seasons somehow promotes the charm and

beauty of the Vieux Carre.

It does not and I would also

submit, as I have touched upon before, that the statute
itself, and I reiterate, establishes a monopoly for a lucky
business, that is, Lucky Dogs.

It gives no opportunity to

anyone else to provide a hot dog which is better able to
promote the charm and beauty of the Vieux Carre, if you would
assume that a hot dog can somehow or other promote the charm
and beauty of the Vieux Carre.
And also, it creates a closed class.
There is no possibility, as pointed out by Judge
Goldberg, though it usually, in the Morey v«Doud situation,
you had there someone who was identified in the act.

As

Judge Goldberg pointed out in his decision before the Fifth
Circuit, it is a matter of record that the only person who
could possibly qualify for this would be Lucky Dogs.

I mean,

there is just nobody else who could possibly ever qualify
for this and Judge Goldberg took notice of this in his
decision in the footnote and I submit — and as I have

43

pointed out before, there is nothing which one could assume
as far as I am concerned that a hot dog can do for the charm
and beauty of the Vieux Carre by virtue of the fact that the
person who is selling it has been there eight years selling it.
We are not talking about, as in the Eslin case out
of Florida, which I cited for your consideration, the
situation of favoring doctors, such as doctors who would seek
to be licensed and exempt these doctors from the operation of
the licensing law on the basis that they had been practicing
for four years.
I mean, we are not dealing with doctors, we are
dealing with what has generally been conceded that are
transient vendors who are selling hot dogs on the street
corners of New Orleans and there is nothing so qualifying
about continually putting transient vendors in the streets
for eight years which would justify this type of discrimina­
tion and go into and violate and deny Nancy Dukes her right
to earn a living which was one of the established consti­
tutional rights and privileges.
It has been established in Coryell versus CorfieId,
cited with approval in Shapiro v. Thompson and noted by this
Court.

I mean, a right to earn a living is something you

simply cannot take away from a person and this is what this
statute doss without any rational basis whatsoever and if
you really look at it — and I submit further and again in

44
repetition, there is nothing so unique about selling hot
dogs for eight years that could somehow or other contribute
more to the charm and beauty of the Vieux Carre than one
selling it for nearly two years.
Thank you, sirs.
QUESTION:

Mr. Marcal, what kind of a vendor's

wagon did she have?

I don't find any photographs of hers as

I do of the others.

Was it much like the others?

MR. MARCAL:

There is nothing in the record but

that: her pushcart was painted over.

It was — it had a

flower arrangement or something on the side of it and it has
now been, I think, dismantled and she is trying to go on to
another business though, certainly, she would like to get
back into Vieux Carre.

It is a very lucrative area and

certainly, she would be subject to any reasonable regulations

MR. MARCAL:

Well, I think they are subject to

interfere with the flow of traffic.

However, I don’t think

that you could simply eliminate them from the streets in
favor of one person that had been there merely for eight
years.
QUESTION s

Can you eliminate them entirely?

MR. MARCAL:

I would think so, if they desired,

but you cannot, you know, have this type of discriminatory
scheme.

MR. MARCAL:

Again, we go — I would begin with the

right which is regulated, the right to earn a living, whether
that is reasonable, whether that promotes the purposes.
QUESTION:

You are getting into a substantive

argument there, then, that —
MR. MARCAL:

Correct.

business.

regulations where people can’t comply which would give a

There are regulations which are

certainly — can be supported, can be substantiated insofar
as they have some rational connexity with the desired
purpose.

That is, it is not in the interest of the Vieux

Carre to have any push carts, ie „, we are going to phase
them out over a period of time.
I can speculate all sorts of regulations and it
is difficult for me to do that.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL P. LOEFFELHOL3, ESQ.
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

Yes, sir, Mr. Chief Justice.

And may it Please the Court:
Before the luncheon break, the question was put to
me or to Mr. Marcal — I can’tremember exactly which one of
us — as to why or was it pointed out to the Fifth Circuit
that Lucky Dogs and that Nancy Dukes was not a hot dog sales­
man.
I would draw your attention to Volume II of our
Appendix at page 16, which is a reproduction of my brief to
the Fifth Circuit and the bottom paragraph does so

point out

the fact that Nancy Dukes was not a hot dog peddler in the
French Quarter.
QUESTION:

Yes, but she was doing confections,

wasn’t she?
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

Confections.

And it was our

understanding at the time of the attack originally, when it
was brought in 1372, Mr. Justice Blackmun, was that this was
an attack by a vendor of different forms or different

types

of foodstuffs or different types of things.
She made the contention orally that she was going
to sell sandwiches, et cetera, nothing about hot dogs.
are talking about semantics.

We

hot dogs par se and I think we can see by the —

Is her case any better or worse whether

she did or didn't sell hot dogs?
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ: ‘ I
QUESTION:

believe —

As far as this ordinance is concerned.

MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

I believe, Mr.Justice Blackmun,

it may be in this respect because she is — we maintain that
she is not within that protected

class that she claims she

carries the banner for, a hot dog salesman.
QUESTION:

Well, it depends whether she has been

eight years a vendor, not whether or not she sells hot dogs,
doesn't it?
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:
today.

Well, it depends as it stands

Maybe it doesn’t in a certain respect but she claims

to be within a class of people who is favored because they
were there eight years and she has only been there two and
therefore she says she is discriminated against.
This is where the Fifth Circuit started in the
very first sentence of its opinion, as Mr. Justice Stewart
pointed out, under the faulty premise, that she was one, a
hot dog vendor, and then it goes on in the same paragraph
.i

or the next paragraph to state that Lucky Dogs — it implies
that Lucky Dogs had been there only eight years and these two
factors combined must be the reason the city council sought
to favor the one over the other when, in fact, the facts do
belie that.

49
The facts are

she sells confections, novelties andcold drinks and —

which I was compelled to answer, was that she wanted to go
there and sell.

She did not vend —- this was the reason that

her vendor was arrested, because the hot dog was accepted
and he was not selling hot dogs.
At that particular time, there was no eight-year —
hot dogs were accepted.

They could be in there and there was

no eight-year grandfather clause.
QUESTION;

Can I gat to another point?

MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

In this protection of the French

Quarter, et cetera, what are there, too many of these or you
want to get fewer numbers or what -~?
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

I believe the overall regulatory

scheme shall be, in the future years, to eliminate all
transient vendors, street peddlers and hawkers.

This is one

of the steps in that scheme.
QUESTION;

But there is no restriction on the

50

number that Lucky Dog

can have* is there?

MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

There is no restriction afc :fehe

present time.
QUESTION:

So Lucky Dog can put out twice as many

as were displaced.
MR. LOEFFELHOLZs

That is correct.

However* I

would respectfully point out —
QUESTION:

Could Lucky Dog also put out on® that

sold the same things that Ms. Duke sold?
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

I don’t believe they could under

the ordinance as it now stands.
QUESTION:

Why not?

MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

Because I think that the policy

behind the ordinance is clear.

I think it is seeking to

regulate vendors and eventually eliminate all of them.
QUESTION:

But it

MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:
correct.

said —
As it is written* you may be

As it is written.
QUESTION:

are driving at.

That is why I don’t understand what you

If you give one man unlimited — could he --

could Lucky Dog buy over Ms. Duke’s business and keep it
operating in his name* under this ordinance?
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ;
QUESTION s

As far as —

The answer is yes.

MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

Maybe under the ordinance as it

51
stands.
QUESTION:

Well, that is what we have before us.

MR. LOEFFELHOLZ;

Well, that is correct, but we

also have to look at the intention of the city council as
well.

Now, since this suit has been filed in 1972, Lucky

Dogs has not done any of the things that you have suggested
that it might, under the ordinance.
QUESTION:

Okay?

That is because the case has been in

court.
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:

Well, that may be — that may

be because the case is in court and it may not be, because
they were under no restraint.
At any rate, when his client was arrested, he was
selling hot dogs -- he was not selling hot dogs, which is the
only thing he could sell, and therefore he was arrested.
The Court of Appeals opinion, we would respectfully
submit, begins from the two faulty premises and flows there­
from.

The entire tenor of the opinion is set by those first

couple of paragraphs and the questioned grandfather clause is,
in this case, illustrative of the desire not to favor any
particular business but to maintain only those features which
over the years have become landmarks in the area of the City
of New Orleans, over 260 years, not to suggest that Lucky
Dogs has been there that long, but all of the features, the
sum total of the functional and physical part of the French

52

Quarter.
It is this entire area of the city which is
intentionally preserved and not individual establishments
and such intent must — must be viewed in its entirety and not.
as the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals did, dissected into
each of its incidental side efforts.
Therefore, we urge this honorable Court to
€9

consider such action on the part of the City that it. is
representing a legitimate and compelling government interest
and the presumption, therefore, should be applied as the case
law states, and judicial restraint, which is exactly the
point as well, should be invoked.
And the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals’ opinion
should be overturned and the District Court's opinion
reinstated.
Thank you.
QUESTION;

I take it, then, you stick on compelling

interest.
HR. L0EFFELH0L2;
interest.

I would stress

compelling

That is correct, Mr. Jiistice Blackmun.
QUESTION;

You go that far.

And you think you

have to go that far.
MR. LOEFFELHOLZ:
must go that far.
Thank you.

I believe that in this Court we
