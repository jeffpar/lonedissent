MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear

arguments first this morning in Number 74-5822, Hampton
against the United States,
Mr, Lang, you may proceed whenever you are ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. LANG, ESQ,
MR, LANG:

Thant you.

Mr, Chief Justice and may it Please the Court:
My name is David Lang and I am counsel for the
Petitioner in this case, Charles Hampton, Junior,
This case is before this Court o

writ of

certiorari to the United Scates Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit.

That court affirmed a jury verdict finding

the Defendant guilty of two counts of distributing heroin
in violation of federal law.
The facts of this case are as follows:
Petitioner Charles Hampton was initially charged
with a two-count indictment with violation of Section 84191
of Title 21 of the United States Code, to wit, knowingly
and intentionally distributing approximately three grams
of heroin.
At the trial, the Government introduced testimony
of five witnesses in the case in chief and three witnesses
in rebuttal,
Only three of the Government3,

\

itnesses'

4
testimony is presently before this Court»
Hampton likewise

also introduced the testimony

of five witnesses* including himself* and only his
testimony appears in the record.
Basically* without
fairly well set-out in the

I think the facts are

brief* but just to give some

background on them* basically* the Government's first
witness was a Jule Hutton* who was a special employee of
the Drug Enforcement Administration.
He testified that he had been involved, in soma
80 or 90 drug cases in Wichita* Kansas* Lawrence* Kansas
and the St. Louis area.

Ha had just come into St. Louis

and his job was to make contact with persons who were
involved in drug traffic aid set up sales with agents of
the Drug Enforcement Administration.
He testified that in this instance he was
approached by the Defendant* Hampton* who initiated the
scheme for selling drugs aid. basically there were two
sales that occurred.
One occurred on February the 25th* 1974.
The other occurred on February the 26th* the
following day.,
The first sale took place and at that sale a
second sale was set up.

On the date of the following sale*

February the 26th* the sale was consumated and two persons

5

who purchased the drugs then identified themselves as being
federal narcotics agents and placed both the Defendant and
Jule Hutton, the informant, under arrest at that particular
time.
That was basically the story that was given by
Hutton,
Now, the contradiction came in with respect to
Hampton’s testimony.

His testimony was basically that all

of the drug transactions were initiated, not by himself,
but by Hutton, the Government’s informant.

He further

i

testified that at no time did any of the substances which

■.i V

he sells were — or, rather, that all the substances which
• ■! j •

he sold had been supplied to him by Hutton, that he had no

• V !

•independent source of supply of these drugs.
■-t

-"■'■■■■■

.:"f .

'

!;■

The question basically was a question of
credibility between the two witnesses,.

' i; •.

At the trial we moved for a special jury
instruction on the defense of entrapment.

This Was based

upon the so-called "Government conduct" theory of
entrapment and the focus of that theory is that one does
/

not focus, of course, upon the predisposition of the
defendant but rather upon the extent of the Governmental
participation in crime.
The District Court refused to give the
requested instruction on the ground that this Court's

6

opinion in United States ^versus Russell precluded any
entrapment defense based upon any principal other than
predisposition»
The Court of Appeals affirmed that decision on
the grounds that it felt it was also precluded.

There was

one dissenting opinion.
Therefore, the basic issue in this case is
whether the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment
forbids the conviction of an accused for selling contraband
if the contraband was supplied to him by an agant acting
in behalf of the United States Government,
Previous opinions of this Court, starting with
Sorrells and culminating with the Russell decision in 1973,
we believe, do not reach this issue.
We believe this issue was not reached in
Russell,

that Russell was distinguishable and that this

is a totally different situation.
yoaoiiOH:

Mr» Lang, you are basing your entire

case on due process, I take it.
MR. LAMGs

That is correct, your Honor.

QUESTION:

Hot on any entrapment defense, as

MR. LANG:

That, is correct, your Honor.

such.

have been a number of cases in which this precise

There
issue

has been raised, both in state court cases and federal

7
cases,
Prior to this Court's decision in Russell, every
court that had passed on the issue of contraband being
supplied to the Defendant, and that was the subject of the
offense, had ruled that that constituted entrapment as a
matter of law.
Now, a careful analysis of those cases, I
believe, the courts used various languages.
used the term entrapment.

Some courts

Some casas, the courts didn't

specify what exactly, what doctrine they were purporting to
utilise in those cases,
I think these cases can best be analysed if they
are viewed as due process tsases and —
QUESTION:

I understand that no specific

entx'apmenfc instruction was requested of Judge Meredith.
MR. LPJSGs

This was Judge Nannie.

We did not

request the traditional predisposition entrapment
instruction.

That is correct, your Honor.

We only requested this so-called "Government
Conduct" theory of entrapment — or whatever one wants to
term it.

The reason for that in this particular instance

was that the offense was knowingly intentionally distri­
buting heroin and so the issue of scienter was already
before the jury.
If they believed that this Defendant never knew

MR. LANG:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Would that not be the next step,

providing the money in marked money to buy was just as much
of a taint in the transaction and the Government's role as
providing the contraband to sell?
MR. LANG:

No, your Honor and 1311 answer that

by approaching it this way.

I'd like to approach it by

stating it this way, all right?
When, the Government supplies contraband to a
defendant, it is necessarily assuming that this man has
some criminal propensity that he is going to commit an
offense involving the contraband in the future.
That is an implicit presumption.

That is the

only presumption that can justify supplying the contraband.
If the man is not going to sell contraband,
then the Government has no right to test him or to aid
him under the traditional doctrine so there is a finding,
there is a necessary relied-upon presumption when the
contraband is supplied that he was going to sell it, anyway, he was going to get his own source of the contraband
and sell it.
QUESTION:

Well, when they supplied the money,

is there net just as realistic a notion that he is familiar
with the ways of tha drug craffic and that he is going

to

use the money in tha way that he agreed to use it, that is,

9
that he agreed to buy some narcotics?
MR. LANG:

Well, no, your Honor, I am saying

that there is a distinct difference between contraband.First
of all, because an item has been labeled contraband by
Congress, there should be a presumption -- there should be
a presumption that that item is not generally available.
That is why i* i« contraband
Indeed, Congress is. trying to keep it off the
streets.
If we take a hypothetical, for example, let’s
say someone wants to make a time bomb and let’s assume
that a necessary element in the time bomb is a clock or
some type of time-keeping device.
If the Government provided
have no problems with that.

a clock, I would

It is necessary but we can

assume that the Defendant can go out and purchase a clock
anyway.

It cvusn'fc have to be supplied.
I am saying we can't necessarily as a matter of

logic make that inference when the contraband is supplied.
It doesn't necessarily follow that contraband is available
just because one has a predisposition to want to engage in
a contraband crime, that he will be able to get contraband.
There was no evidence in this case that the
defendant had any sort of heroin other than the Government's.
That was never brought at trial what his source

10

of supply was.
QUESTION:

What about his testimony that

shewed predisposition?
MR. LANG:

Well, 1 am saying*, your Honor,

certainly at some point whan the crime was committed,
there is always predisposition.

We are talking about a

consummated criminal act.
When the act was consummated, certainly his
predisposition was one element or one cause of that
criminal act and another element was inducement by the
Government.

Another element that caused the consummated

act was supplying the contraband.
All of these things caused, factually, the
consummated criminal act.
Now, 1 am saying that it would be begging the
question if we look at the fact of the sale of the
contraband as saying ha was predisposed.
Yes, assuming that he was predisposed, it does
not necessarily follow that he could have gotten the
contraband from any other source.

It does not follow as a

matter of logic.
If he could not obtain the contraband despite
predisposition, he may have been deterred from engaging in
that particular criminal activity.
possibility.

That is a distinct

Ii
The fact that it is contraband means that it
is difficult or ought to be difficult to obtain.

It is

not as available as many other substances.
In the Russell case, the substance involved was
propanone , which was an essential ingredient to making
Spaed, which was a drug that was involved there in that
particular case.
Wow, in that particular case there are some
factual distinctions

there.

First of all, it was clear in that case that
the Defendant had a source of propanone both

before and

after it was supplied by the Government.
Secondly, that was a crime involving manufacture

some type of affirmative

QUESTION

%

Well, the Russell case was akin to

to your hypothetical case of the time bomb and the
furnishing by the Government of the clock.
MR, LMFGs

That is correct, your Honor.

But in that instance, as I say, with the clock
there is no problem because everyone knows you can go out

12

and buy a clock.

In the Russell case there was no

problem because we know both before and after the sale the:

ment supplied it.

I have no problem that the Govern-

It was Inconsequential.

But that is not the case here.

We are talking

about the presumption that the Government is relying on
and that is the presumption that this man was going to
obtain contraband because ha was predisposed to engage in
this type of offense.
I am saying it doss not follow as a matter of
logic that just because one is predisposed, if the contraband is unav’*'51 able that, you would therefore engage in
that crime.
QUESTION s

Mr. hang?

MR. LANG;

Yes, your Hcnoi“.

QUESTION:

Assume a case in which the evidence

is undisputed, that the Defendant had been engaged in
selling heroin, say, for months or years but the particular
batch of heroin that ha was being prosecuted for having
sold had been supplied by Government agents,
Would your position be different?
MR. LANG:

My position in that case would not

be different, your Honor, because the Defendant is on

13

charge for the sale of -- we are not charging the man or
holding him responsible for his past criminal conduct.
The crime which would be before the Court in
that instance is the one that he engaged in and in that
case, whenever the supply — whenever the subject of the
offense was supplied by the Government, I would say that
regardless of what he had done in the past, regardless
of predisposition, that in that case we cannot allow his
prosecution to stand, or ho cannot ba prosecuted.
QUESTION:
regardless of all

Are you. advocating a per se rule

other facts and circumstances if and

only if the contraband that is involved in the particular
prosecution was supplied by the Government?
MR. LMG:
a very

That is right, your Honor.

That is

narrow standard.
Indeed, we have to

Government’s conduct.

«ome outer limits on the

I think it is necessary to an

extent to set some outer limits on what type of law
enforcement activities were permissible in this society.
Back in — to set out another hypothetical that
comes to mind, let’s assume we have a situation where a
defendant is engaged in making a bomb .

He is going to

blow up some federal buildings.
Mow, he is a member of some type of revolu­
tionary group and his group is infiltrated by an agent of

14
the Government and this mai is a — the Defendant is a
demolitions expert and he jets into the building and plants
the bomb and has a change of heart.

He decides that maybe

innocent people will be hurt and doesn't want to go ahead
and do it and the Government agent pulls out a pistol and
tells him, well, you know, for the cause, you must do
this and he goes ahead and fuses the bomb and he is
subsequently charged with some type of crime arising out
of that incident.
Now, if we just focus on the fact that he was
predisposed in the past, there would be room for a jury to
make that factual finding.
I am saying that as a matter of policy we might
want to have some situations where we don't want those
types of cases going to the jury and that is —

ii

the only thing that —- the thing that moat closely
approximates it is Government-supplied contraband and from
what X have seen, that is the greatest extent to which the
Government is involved in crimes, actually supplying the

15
contraband.

X don't think that

that is therefore a

difference.
We are going to talk about drawing some limits.
QUESTIONS

Well, in your hypothetical,-, though#

ths Defendant would surely have the defense of duress
available to him.
MR. LANG:

He would have duress but he should

also have — he would also have the defense of Government
conduct# the Government conduct.
I am saying it might be# in that particular
instance, that he would not have engaged — we still have
the fact that he was refused bond.

That is a given fact.

Just like we have in the case before us the
fact that the drags

were

sold.

They were sold.

But I am

saying that we have no problem with, hypothetical.
We are saying that we don’t know for a fact
that he did it because of coercion or because there was
predisposition,
I am saying it is too great a danger — we
can’t say it is too great a danger to allow that type of
case to go to the jury.
1 am saying the same thing is true when we are
talking about this contraband offense 'when the contraband
has been supplied by the Government.
QUESTION;

It is just too great,

Mr. Lang, assuming that the

16
Government gives a known pusher contraband, heroin and the
known pusher shoves it to your man, would you still have
the same defense?
MR, LANG:
same conclusion.

Yes, your Honor, I would have the

Any time that the person —

QUESTION:

Well, suppose the Government just

leaves the package of heroin on the doorsill and the
Pusher picks it up.
MR. LANG:

Would the Government then be guilty?
Yes, your Honor, they would be.

1 would say so because what the Government is
doing is manufacturing crime.
What interest does the Government have in — if
the Government’s interest is in keeping heroin off the
streets, what interest does it have —
QUESTION:

Well, in my first case, the Government

was not manufacturing crime because I said this was a
known pusher,
MR, LANGs

Well, I understand it was a known

pusher but then why — the question comes up as to why is
it necessary for the Government to supply him with the
heroin if he is a known pusher?
until he gets his own heroin?

Why don’t they just wait
That is where we have to

look at the problem*
If the man is a known pusher and he has his own
source, why can’t the Government just wait until he comes

17
up with his own source?

1 don't see the necessity for the

Government intervening in that case.
QUESTION:

Wall, I suppose one reason why the

Government might not want to wait is that if they don’t,
know his source and can’t apprehend, him in other ways, it
might be a year or two afterwards that they were ever able
to convict him.
MR. LANG:

Well, that is a possibility, your

Honor and 1 would not argue that.

However, when they do

convict him for that particular crime, we still get back to
th© question of whether or not he would have sold the
heroin without their intervention.
In other words, I am still saying I think that
our system of justice says that we have to give a man the
benefit of the doubt in this instance.
We are talking about, in effect, if we look at --remember that we are talking about causal relations.

If

we thought about it in tort terms or causal relation in
criminal terms, we have several acts which contribute to
the consummated criminal act, which is the subject of the
offense.
We have several things which can contribute to
it.

Ons thing is the criminal propensity of the Defendant.

Another thing is th® inducement for the Government agents.
Another thing is the supply of the contraband.

18

Under tort law and criminal law, there are
instances wherein we make acts superseding — in the
terminology that is used there — superceding independent
intervening causes and so forth and relieve liability
despite factual causation,.
QUESTION:

But under no conceivable tort theory

that I have ever heard of would your man in this case be
freed on the ground of superceding cause,
MR. LANG:

Well, I am saying that — I am only

making the analogy insofar as saying that what we are
talking about is the fkcfc what we have several causes
which contribute to the consummated act.
I am saying as i matter of logic, we don't know
that the Defendant would have been able to complete this
crime but for the supply of the contraband and we have to
use a more exacting standard because we are talking
a man's liberty in this casa»

about

We ara talking about the

criminal justice system and I think the standards that we
set out from the presumption cases that we cited —■> 1
think that standard is that there must be — th© presumed the ultimate fact must, follow logically from the proven
fact and must exist, beyond reasonable doubt.
I think if we apply that standard here, it
•can't certainly be said beyond a reasonable doubt that
assuming that Hampton was disposed to commit the offense,

19
that he would have committed it had the Government net
supplied the contraband.
QUESTION:

Incidently, Mr. Lang, was your

instruction — proposed instruction —- framed on the
actual instruction of Bueno in the Fifth Circuit?
MR. LANG:

Yes, it was, I believe, your Honor,

The second aspect of due process, your Honor,
that we urge this Court to adopt, deals with the question
'•

Vv.

of the fundamental fairness of the Government's conduct
by supplying the contraband in this case and in this
instance we believe that it is fundamentally unfair for
the Government to provide the contraband.
The Government has a legitimate interest in —■
the Government’s interest is only in apprehending those

■■ y

engaged in criminal activity by the mere offer of a
neutral opportunity.
That is the standard that this Court has
adopted in Sorrells and Sherman.,

There is no governmental

interest in intervening in the contraband trade based upon
anything other than opportunity and if the Government
supplies contraband, it is indeed not acting within the
bounds of its legitimate interest.
What we have her© in that situation is that
a

law enforcement that offends the general sense of justice,

This gives one the

It encourages law enforcement

officials to participate i:a crimes.

to selectively set up defendants for prosecution and indeed,
this is just what

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, 'Mr. Lang.

Mr. Jones.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH A. JONES, ESQ.
MR, JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it Please

the Court:
At

issue in this case, as Mr. Lang stated,

is whether there is a per 3e denial of due process to

21
convict a defendant for the sale of narcotics that he
procured from an informant or a Government agent»
There is conflict among the courts of appeals
on this issu©

The United States Court of Appeals for the

Fifth Circuit has held that where an informant or a
Government agent supplies a, defendant with narcotics for
the sale of which the defendant is subsequently arrested
and indicted, the defendant: is immune from prosecution for
that offense

without regard to any of the surrounding

circumstances including the fact that defendant may have
been predisposed to deal in the kinds of narcotics which
he was arrested for selling»
The Court of Appeals below, the Eighth Circuity
rejected the per se test and held that the Petitioner in
this case was

properly convicted notwithstanding the

fact that be might have procured his heroin here from a
Government informant»
Because of the importance of this issue to the
administration of our narcotics laws, the United States
acquiesced in the granting of the petition.
At the outset, 1 would like to briefly
recapitulate the relevant facts

in this case and I think

there are four of them»
First, the Petitioner did make two sales of
heroin to Government undercover agents.

22
Second, it has now been established that the
Petitioner knew at the time he was making the sales that
th© substance was heroin.
Third, it is unquestioned that the Petitioner
was introduced to the Government undercover agents by an
informant who described them as potential narcotics buyers
and,
Fourth, it was also established by Petitioner's
counsel and the Court of Appeals, that Petitioner was at
all relevant times predisposed to deal in heroin.
Some of the remaining facts are still
controverted.

In particular. Petitioner testified at

trial that it was the informant who originated the scheme
of selling heroin, whereas the informant testified to the
contrary, that the scheme originated with Petitioner,,
The Petitioner also testified that he obtained
his heroin from the informant.

The informant denied this

and testified that ha had no knowledge concerning the
Petitioner's source of heroin.
QUESTION:

Well, what do you think is really

important, material to the basic question in this case,
Mr, Jones?
instruction

Isn't the question only whether or not the
set out on page 9 of Petitioner’s brief was

required?
MR, JONES %

That is correct and I’d like to

23
read that instruction just for the benefit of the Court so
we will know exactly what we are talking about here.
The Petitioner requested instruction at trial
as follows, and X will quote;
"If you find that the Defendant's sales of
narcotics were sales of narcotics supplied to him by an
informer in the employ of or acting or* behalf of the
government, then you must acquit the defendant because the
law as a matter of policy forbids his conviction in such a
case.
"Fixrtharmore, under this particular defense,
you need not consider the predisposition of the defendant
to commit the offenses charged —■ ” and I'll end the quote
there.
Under this instruction, if tha jury had
concluded that Petitioner had, in fact, obtained the heroin
that he sold from the government informant, than, it would
have been required to acquit Petitioner and this would
have been true no mater what other kinds of findings the
l!, ■

jury might have made.
For example, if the jury had concluded that
Petitioner was an ,established heroin dealer with many
sources of supply of heroin who had originated the scheme
of selling heroin and had, in fact, demanded heroin from
the informant as a sign of good faith or as a means of

24
involving the informant in a criminal transaction, never­
theless the jury would have been required to acquit the
Petitioner if it found that, in fact, the informant did
comply with the demand, did furnish the contraband in
question.
QUESTION;

Indeed, there was no dispute about

the fact» was there?
MR. JONES;
QUESTION s

Pardon?
There was no dispute that the

informer did furnish it.
MR. JONES;

Oh, no, that was disputed.

The

informant denied that ha furnished the heroin, so that the
matter is in dispute and the jury made no finding on that
point.
QUESTION;

Well, that really is not important.

This — it was a fact in dispute.
MR. JONES;

I was only responding to Mr. Justice

Marshal1's question.
QUESTION:

Well, but you originally spent quite

a few minutes talking about the dispute and the facts.
That■has nothing to do with the basic issue in this case,
.does it?
MR. JONES;

Thai: is correct.

I only wanted to

point out to the Court that what is involved hers is a
disputed matter and if the Court decided that the

25
instruction should have been given, of course the proper
relief would be a new trial —
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

Well, certainly.
~ because that question is in

dispute.
Now, I would lilte first to describe the
relationship that the Petitioner5s proposed due process
defense bears to the standard defense of entrapment and
then I will elaborate at greater length upon the reasons
for rejecting that or aifiy similar defense.
The availability of the traditional defense of
entrapment turns upon the question of predisposition.
That is, it turns upon the question of whether
Defendant, at the time of the alleged entrapment, was
predisposed to commit the kind of offense which he did, in
fact, commit.
New, the Petitioner here has conceded that he
was predisposed to commit the heroin offense with which he
was charged and he has not attempted to assert the
traditional defense of entrapment in this case. .
But the defense that he does assert bears a
strong resemblance to an entrapment defense.
The proper scops; and correct formulation of the
defense of entrapment has been much mooted by the members
of this Court over the years and in United States against

26

Russell, three members of the present Court expressed the
view that the defense of entrapment should turn, not upon
the subjective factor of the defendant's predisposition
but rather upon the objective consideration of the
particular law enforcement

conduct.

The entrapment test propounded by the minority
in Russell vras whether the government's conduct —- and I
quote here — "Whether the government's conduct is of a
kind that could induce or .instigate the commission of a
crime by one not ready and willing to commit it."
Now, we think it is fairly clear that that test
would not avail Petitioner in this case, either.

What he

seeks is recognition of an absolute defense based up the
presence of a single alleged fact, the provision of heroin
by an informant,
QUESTION:

That has bean the rule in the

circuits, hasn't it?
MR. JONES s

Thai; has been the rule in the

Fifth Circuit.
QUESTION;

I was just reading Judge Roney’s

opinion for a unanimous court in the Bueno case in 1971.
MR, JONES;

That was the rule in the Fifth

MR, JONES;

MR. JOKES:

\
And in some of the state courts.

QUESTION;
Eighth.

Well, it is clearly not in the

That is this case,
MR. JOKES:

It is not in the Seventh, either.

The McGrath decision applied Russell in the context of -~
in a similar context to preclude an absolute defense.
We feel that informant's offer to supply heroin
to an individual is simply not the kind of offer, not the
kind of law enforcement activity that is likely to induce
an otherwise law-abiding individual to enter* the narcotics
trade„
I mean, it is simply not the kind of objective
law enforcement conduct that is likely to turn an innocent
individual into the path of crime.
This kind of offer# this kind of law
enforcement conduct# may prove useful in apprehending
criminals but it poses little or no risk by itself of
trapping unwary innocents.
V?c therefore think that under either view of
the proper scope of the entrapment tests, Petitioner was
not entrapped and indeed, the Petitioner seems to concade
as much in this case because he has repeatedly characterised

28
this as not an entrapment ease but this concession, this
acknowledgement that this is not a case of entrapment
creates for Petitioner what appears to be an insoluble
paradox„
The: due process test that he advocates is
analagous to the test advocated by the minority in
Russell in that each of those tests focuses on tha conduct
of the government agents„
But whereas the minority test in Russell
entailed an evaluation of the governmental conduct in its
entirety, the test proposed by Petitioner focuses
exclusively on a singla aspect of that conduct, the
furnishing of narcotics„
His contention is that an informant's supply
of narcotics to a suspect for controlled resale to
government agents is somehow shocking and offensive per
se

but as I.have just indicated, that kind of law

enforcement conduct, standing alone, carries so little
risk of inveigling an innocent and law-abiding

individual

into crime that it does not. even constitute entrapment.
Almost by definition, therefore, the
governmental furnishing of narcotics is not shocking and
offensive in any sense that pertains to the essential
concerns underlying the entrapment doctrine.
It is not shocking and offensive, that is, in

29
any sense that pertains to the values underlying the
traditional defense of entrapment.
The paradox is that those are exactly the
values and concerns educed by Petitioner here.

Those are

the only concerns he raises.
The only kind of complaint that he makes about
the governmental conduct here is that it is the kind of
conduct — and I quote here from this Court's Sherman
decision ~~ "That plays on the weaknesses of an innocent
party and

beguiles him into commiting crimes which he

otherwise would not have committed.
This ie not a kind of case like Roehin against
California where other kinds of due process values are
involved.

In that case, the value was the protection of

the citizenry against governmental brutality.
Nothing of that kind is involved here.
Petitioner's only claim is that he was unfairly
assisted in his own criminal activities and that is a
claim that smacks solely and simply of entrapment, dressed
in this case in due process clothingf simply to conceal
Petitioner's own criminal predisposition.
Now, these considerations suggest to us that
an allegation of governmental furnishing of narcotics is
merely one factor to be considered in connection with the
standard defense of entrapment.

30

Such an allegation should not be treated as
giving rise to a separate and preclusive due process
defense.
Now, we would, of course, concede that in some
hypothetical circumstances the governmental furnishing
of narcotics would be part of & course of law enforcement
conduct that, considered in its entirety, might entail
the entrapment of an innocent individual but our point
here is that an allegation of such governmental
furnishing by itself in essence raises only a partial
claim of entrapment and that such a claim must be
rejected if the other requisites of an entrapment defense
are lacking.
Those requisites are lacking here and we think
that, that disposes of Petitioner’s case.
With this much said, however, I would now turn
to a closer analysis of Petitioner * s specific contention
that somehow the governmental provision of narcotics to a
suspect for controlled resale is shacking to the universal
sense of justice, shocking to the conscience of the Court,
Of necessity, the application of a due process
test

such as this depends in large measure upon the

individual subjective judgments of the members of the
court but we believe that to the extent that analysis and
experience may be brought to bear in making these

31
judgments that the governmental conduct alleged here
cannot be viewed as so outrageous — and I quote here
from the majority opinion in Russell — "Cannot be
viewed as so outrageous that due process principles will
absolutely bar the government from invoking judicial
processes to obtain a conviction."
Our submission on this point is twofold.
First, as an analytical matter, we see no
constitutionally significant difference between the
providing of narcotics alleged by Petitioner here and the
furnishing of other indispensable means of committing
crime, such as the phenyl-two propanone that was supplied
to the defendants in United States against Russell.
Second, as a matter of law enforcement
experience,

are concerned that the adoption of a per

se due process rule of the kind advocated by Petitioner
could Seriously hamper enforcement of the narcotics laws.
I will discuss these two points in turn.
First, as an analytical matter, the only
distinction between the heroin allegedly supplied the
Petitioner here and the phenyl-two propanone supplied in
Russell is that heroin is contraband, whereas phenyl-two
propanone is not.
That is the only distinction we see and that is
the only distinction that the Petitioner has suggested.

32

QUESTION:

Well, that is the distinction that

the criminal law makes too, isn't it?
MR. JONES:

Thai is the distinction the federal

law makes,,
QUESTION s

Selling phenyl-two propanone

would

not have been a criminal offense»
MR» JONES:

Our submission here, however,

Mr» Justice Stewart, is that it is a distinction which
in this context has no constitutional force and I —
QUESTION:

Well, the whole point is that what

is criminal is the selling the contraband.

It is not

criminal to sell an alarm clock.
MR» JONES:

Well, once again, the distinction

between contraband and alarm clock or the distinction
between contraband and phenyl-two propanone is that one is
illegal and the other is legal but regrettably
regrettably, there is no distinction between the two as to
the relative obtainability of the two substances.
That, it seams to us, is the crux of Petitioner's
submission.

He claims that one substance is obtainable and

the other is not.

But that is simply not the case.

Phenyl-two propanone was difficult to obtain
but it was obtainable and the same may be said of heroin.
Indeed, it is very likely true that heroin is
more readily obtainable, more easily obtained by persons

33

familiar with our narcotics trade, such as Petitioner,
than is phenyl-two propanone.
Petitioner by his own admission in this case
has testified that he had had no difficulty in obtaining
heroin in the past.

He was an acknowledged heroin addict

and he had had contact with heroin in the four months
preceding his trial.
We quote on page four of our brief Petitioners
admission that, 'The heroin X have seen since I have been
back, since X have been out of the penitentiary, has been
brown.

Before that it was usually white, a white, powdery,

flour-like substance.'
So that heroin was obtainable by him.

He had

familiarity with it.
Since the distinction between the heroin here
■

*

and lawful substances that may also be indispensable
elements in crime does not bear upon obtainability, we
think it has no constitutional force here.
Heroin was otherwise obtainable by Petitioner
and he, by his own admission, was predisposed to commit
heroin offenses.

Ha was willing to commit such offenses

and he was able to do so.
The governmental conduct alledgcd here was
therefore, nothing more than the simple provision of the
opportunities and facilities for the commission of a

34

particular crime of a type of which the Petitioner was
willing, and able to commit, and that is the kind of
governmental law enforcement conduct that has long been
sanctioned by this Court.
As to the law enforcement experience and the
wisdom that it can provide in this case, we do feel, as I
have suggested earlier, that adoption of a per se rule
might seriously hamper enforcement of the narcotics laws
and this is so for two different kinds of reasons.
First, governmental furnishing of contraband
may in some circumstances be necessary for effective law
enforcement.
Now, this obviously is not a wholly happy state
of affairs, but neither is the fact of substantial narcotics
trade in the country and the fact that governmental
furnishing of narcotics sometimes is necessary to catch
narcotics criminals is a fact and it is one that we think
must be squarely faced.
This Court inasmuch recognised that fact in
Russell.

The Court observed that the infiltration of drug

rings and a limited participation in their unlawful
activities is one of the only practical means of detecting
narcotics criminals.

'

We think that that consideration does play some
part here.

As we indicate in our brief, this is not a

35
common law enforcement practice»
That is, it is not common for the government
qua-governroent to provide narcotics but we think that when
it does occur, it is not shocking and offensive per s®„
But secondly, we are, perhaps, more concerned
that a due process rule of the kind urged by Petitioner
would lead to acquittals in circumstances where the
government's conduct qua-government was completely innocent.
In some cases, for example, a. narcotics courier
may become an informant and may reveal to the government
the identity of the individuals to whom he makes
deliveries.
Under the rule adopted in the Fifth Circuit
and under the instruction offered by Petitioner here, the
government would be barred from prosecuting those
individuals.
improper.

That is a result which seems to us manifestly

The government has done absolutely nothing

at all offensive or in any way unfair in circumstances such
as that.
We see absolutely no reason to bar the
prosecution of such narcotics criminals.
QUESTIONS

Mr, Jones, you'd have no opposition

to an instruction that said, "Consider the whole matter,"
et cetera, ©t cetera, et cetera?
MR. JONES s

Well

36

QUESTION:
MR, JONES:

Which you mentioned some time ago0
Yes

,

Mr, Justice Marshall,

What I

suggested was that the governmental furnishing of narcotics
was a factor to be considered in connection with an
entrapment offense but. that a no due process rule focusing
exclusively upon that fact should 'be adopted,
QUESTION:

But if it was broad enough, you

would not have an objection?
MR, JONES;

Well, we might then get embroiled

in a discussion of the proper contours of the entrapment
defense, that is correct,
QUESTION:

I was thinking about one where, New

York, where they have the

Sullivan Law for possession of a

weapon and an undercover police officer sold the guy a
weapon

and then arrested him,
MR, JONES:
QUESTION:

There might be circumstances —
You know there are

certain kinds of

things that would be a little —
MR„ JONES:

Unsavory,

One kind of situation in ‘which governmental
furnishing of contraband might well be offensive is, for
example, where the Congress had outlawed the possession of
a particular kind of military

weapon and such weapons

were not in private possession and the government, through
undercover agents, offered to furnish a defendant such a

3?
weapon,

1 think that his possession in such a case might

well not be subject to prosecution.
But I would make one more point which bears upon
why we think that a rule like this is inadvisable.,
In many situations, the government simply has
no knowledge

whatsoever or where the defendant obtained

the narcotics or the other contraband that he was accused
of selling.

In such cases the government will have no

affirmative evidence with which to rebut a claim that the
supplier was an informant.
But, more than that, there may well be situations
in which the supplier was, in fact, an informant but was
acting without the knowledge or sanction of the government.
That is, it may well be the case sometimes that
an individual involved in the drug trade will also be
doubling as an informant arid sometimes tip off the govern­
ment as to the activities of some of his associates.
We feel that the fact that the defendant obtained
narcotics from an informant who was acting illegally with­
out the knowledge or approval of the government plainly
does not warrant a due process defense that would bar
prosecution and conviction.
In short, we think that the ordinary rules of
entrapment amply protect the unwary innocent in .
circumstances such as that and that no additional

38

protaction should be afforded the unwary criminal.
The due process rule advocated by Petitioner
here would do just that.

It would afford addition

protection to the unwary criminal and we think that this
Court should reject that per se due process rule 'and
affirm the judgment below.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Jones,, in the argot of the

trade, is there an established difference between an
undercover agent for the government and an informer?
MR. JONES;

I am not an expert in the argot of

the trade but as I have b>en using the terms here I have
been thinking of a government agent as an employee of the
government and an informant as a person who may from time
to time cooperate with the government, sometimes for pay,
sometimes not.
The distinction tends to break down in a middle
grey area because the .informant here, for example, did
receive a per diem.

He was not paid for specific

information but simply paid $25 a day, I think it was, for
his activities but he was not an agent of the government
because he was not subject to the control of the government.
He just provided information when and if he
had it.
QUESTION:

Well, he could be subject to the

control if he was being paid by the government.

He could

39

have been told it was part of his duty

to supply contra­

band to people and then turn them in for the sale of that
contraband.
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

Of course,, we have —
The government has control over this

situation and certainly instructions could be framed to
exonerate the government from any rule as proposed by the
Petitioner in the event that: it was not a deliberate,
conscious act on the part of the government or its agent.
Many, many undercover agents are full-time
police officers.
MR. JONES:

That is correct.

time police officers and some are not.

Some are full­
The fact is that the

government does not have complete control over the
activities of many of its informants, whereas the
government agents are people who are subject to the day to
day control and that is the distinction that I meant to be
implicit in my use of those terms.
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Jones.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Lang?
MR. LANG:

Yes, I do, your Honor.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. LANG, ESQ.
MR. LANG:

On this last issue that was brought

up, the distinction between informer and an agent, let's

40
make it clear that the person involved for the government
in this case was an agent.

He is an agent provocateur.

His job is to go out and find people who might be
interested in drug trafficking aiid
sales of heroin.

get them to makes

That is what his job is,

QUESTION:

Did he gettpaid on a piecework basis?

MR. LANG:

He got paid per diam.

QUESTION:

Per diem.

MR. LANG:

Right.

Now, an- informant is

particularly one who we think of as a stool pigeon.

This

is somebody who is already himself engaged in criminal
activity and for whatever reason, he decides that he is
going to inform the government about it.
It might be because he has another case which is
hanging over his head and he decides it might be his way
out if he informs on his friends.
That is what an informant does.
involved here is not an informant.

This man

He is an agent acting

on behalf of the government, actively going out ,and
seeking persons to engage in the drug traffic.

Ha is an

agent provocateur and as an agent provocateur, I see no
real distinction between him and the normal government
agent.

That is what their job is, too, and the government

certainly can exercise controls ever both of these types
of persons.

41
Secondly, Mr. Jones mentioned that

wa might

have a situation where one is acting -- one might be
engaged in criminal enterprises, let’s say involving
drugs and he decides that he does want to be an informant
in the sense of the word that 1 have used it, he wants to
i

turn state’s evidence for his benefit.
Well, 1 am saying, certainly, in that instance
there would be no bar of prosecution to the defendant who
is charged because of the government has not supplied any
contraband there.

We are not going to suddenly say this

was a supply of contraband because a person has changed
his status so those cases

just would not be effected at all

by the standard that we are urging.
All right, now, another thing that was mentioned
here has to do with the question of indispensable means
versus contraband and Mr. .Tones used the term indispensable
i

means and said that that was what was involved in the
Hampton case here, that the indispensable means were
provided to this crime.

,

Well, I don't think that indispensable means
is the correct terminology.

I think there is a distinction

between providing something such as a clock in the hypothe­
tical I gave or the propenone in the Russell case which were
necessary in contraband per se.
In the Russell case the offense was

42
manufacturing

Speed and i:i that particular instance, yes,

it was necessary to have pcopenone to do that but it also
requires some further affirmative action on the part of the
defendant.

He had to take that ingredient that was given

and mix it up.
There was the evidence of a real predisposition
such as I have no problem inferring that he would have
done it anyway and also we have,, as X indicated before,,
the fact that he did have his own propen ono both before
and after.
Here we donst have that.

If I can go back to

my original argument., my chief argument involving statutory
presumptions, the proven fact in this case is that Hampton
sold heroin and yes, it is true that from that one can
logically inrer that he was predisposed to sell heroin.
I have no problems with that.

Fine.

Assuming that he was predisposed, does it follow
as a matter of logic or rationality that; despite his
predisposition he would have sold heroin had the government
not supplied it?
I say we don't know that.

X say we certainly

don't know that beyond a reasonable doubt and I say that we
can6t say that beyond a reasonable doubt.
The due process clause forbids conviction of
any defendant in these circumstances.
