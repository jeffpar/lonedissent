MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

next in No. 75-44, Burrell v. McCray.
Mr. attorney General, you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS B„ BURCH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. BURCHs

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court s
The cases here today'are consolidated, three cases
dealing with three inmates of the Maryland state Penitentiary.
One is. McCray, one is Mr, Stokes, and the other is Mr.
Washingtona

We will give a few facts with respect tc Mr.

McCray, since that was the only case that was decided on its
merits by the Fourth Circuit.
The only common issue with respect to Messrs. Stokes
and Washington is the single issue as to whether or not the
exhaustion of state administrative remedies is required.
McCray is now confined in the Maryland Penitentiary,
serving 28 years for having been guilty of four counts of as­
sault with intent to murder.

During the first four years of

his confinement, ha filed 37 civil rights actions in the
Federal District Court in Baltimore.

Thereafter he filed ad­

ditional civil rights actions, so there are now 55 actions
that have been filed by Mr. McCray, eight of which deal with

habeas corpus relief and the balance of which deal with civil
rights relief.
Until the Circuit Court in this case# which we say
wrongly# gave some remedy to Hr. McCray, not any one of Ms
petitioners gave him any relief whatsoever.

Judge Field, of

the Fourth Circuit# in his dissent# described McCray from his
litigious history

as a chronic troublemaker and malcontent

who is engaged in a ceaseless array of frivolous civil suits
at public expense based upon allegations that have already
been repeatedly found meritless.

And I would say that as of

today these civil actions that have been filed by Mr. McCray
have cost the State of Maryland something in excess of $350#000.
McCray alleges deprivation of Eighth and Fourteenth
Amendment rights in 1971 in two separate occurrences, a month
apart, alleging improper punishment# illegal conditions of
confinement# and denial of medical care.
The Fourth Circuit declared that the condition of
McCray’s two days* solitary confinement resulting from his
disturbance and misconduct violated the Eighth and Fourteenth
Amendments, prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.
QUESTION:
MR. BURCH:
QUESTION:

Was he in the penitentiary in Baltimore?
Pardon me# air?
The penitentiary in Baltimore is where ha

was?
MR. BURCH?

The Maryland State Penitentiary in

5
Baltimore City, yea*
QUESTION:

Well, is that solitary still down under­

MR. BURCH:

Well» I really don81 know» Mr. Justice

ground?

Marshall» I haven't been down there so I am not sure exactly
where it is.
It is the South fling segregation division» which I
understand is not underground.

It is not underground.

The Fourth Circuit remanded the issue on monetary
damages and the qualified immunities of the prison guards to
the District Court for further determination.

But in our view

it is unnecessary for this Court to reach the merits of the
McCray case» and therefore we will not deal further with the
facts.
We submit that the District Court of Maryland was
correct in its threshold determination that the widely recog­
nised principle of exhaustion of state administrative remedies
required the respondents in these cases to present their com­
plaints concerning the conditions and circumstances of their
confinement first to the Maryland Grievance Commission before
approaching the federal courts.
The Maryland Inmate Grievance Commission procedure
is an adequate and an effective state administrative remedy»
and the decisions of this Court do not» in our view» hold that
where there is; aa adequate administrative remedy a litigant

6
may seek relief In the federal courts without first exhausting
that administrative remedy.
We believe that this view is implicit in Mr,
Justice Douglas* comment in McNeese.

In that particular case,

he stated, "Moreover, it is by no means clear that Illinois
law provides petitioners with an administrative remedy suf­
ficiently adequate to preclude prior resort to a federal
court for protection of their federal rights."

And I might

say that this particular quote admittedly followed the
citation of the opinion of this Court in Lane v. Wilson, 307
U.S., and we believe that Lane v. Wilson, the predecessor of
Monroe, specifically held by implication, if not by direct
holding, that where there was an effective state administrative
remedy, that this must be exhausted before a 1983 suit may be
entertained by the federal courts.
QUESTIONS

Mr, Attorney General, what would the

Maryland Commission have done in this case if the allegations
of the petition were true, what remedy would have been the
appropriate remedy that the Commission could have given?
MR. BURCHs

If the allegations were true, the Com­

mission could have changed the. system with respect to -- they
could take disciplinary actions against the guards who were
involved in question, they could have notified the superin­
tendent of the institution that the procedures would have to
be changed, and they would have notified «— in this, particular

7
case, there was a question of the two-day solitary confinement
without Mr. McCray being clothed»
protection.

This was done for his own

But if the administrative grievance commission

were to have made a determination that this was improper# they
could have issued directions which would be binding upon the
agency to correct that situation,
QUESTIONS

But if the allegations were true# they

were not following rules which were already in effect# isn't
that correct?

Doesn't he allege that there was a rule that

required Immediate —
MR. BURCH;

Well# it is very difficult to state ex­

actly what Mr. McCray alleged# because the allegations in the
complaint were prepared by him in his own hand and they are
not particularly articulate.
QUESTIONs

Well# at least the Court of Appeals

thought hs had alleged that there was a violation by the prison
officials of the prison's own rules.
MR. BURCHj

Well# it may well foe that he could have

claimed that they were a violation of the prison's own rules,
but at least the Grievance Commission, as approved by the
action of the Secretary, would have bean able then to take
remedial action within the institution itself —
QUESTION*

That would have been to discipline the

guards?
MR. BURCH:

— to see that this occurrence did not

8
occur again,, and that would be the nature of the relief that
was requested, which was both declaratory and injunctive.
There was a request for monetary damages,
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General Burch, I think there

is a statement in the majority opinion of the Court of Appeals
to the effect that a state is required to follow its own pro­
cedural rules, and of course that is certainly true in the
federal government.

Do you agree that that is a constitutional

requirement as to the states?
MR. BURCHs

Well, I would not say that it is neces­

sarily a constitutional requirement unless it involves a con­
stitutional right, but certainly it would be the most desir­
able thing, that a state be required to follow its own rules.
QUESTIONs

Well, if it is not a constitutional right,

then presumably a federal court heis no business imposing if on
a state.
MR. BURCH:

It certainly would not have the right to

impose that burden on the state miless it involved the infringe­
ment of a constitutional right, it would seem to me.
I might say also that Mr. Justice Harlan, in Damico,
read the majority opinion in McNeese to hold that the require­
ment of exhaustion — that the requirement of exhaustion of an
adequate state remedy was not condemned in Monroe.
In the ninety years prior to the passage of the Civil
Rights Act of 1871, the ninety years that passed between then

9
and the holding in Monroe, this Court and the lower federal
courts assumed with good reason that exhaustion principles ap­
plied in 1983 action where there was an adequate administra­
tive state remedyo
Furthermore, as early as 1886, this Court, in Ex
Parte Royal, decided that a state prisoner seeking federal
habeas corpus relief under what is now section 2254 could first
be required in the discretion of the court to apply to the
state court for such relief.

This specific mandatory require­

ment, by the way, was not written into section 2254 by the
Congress until 1943, some sixty-two years later, and certainly
what was true under Royal as to the predecessor of section 2254
should be equally as applicable in 1983 cases.
Next to life itself, the most cherished right guaran­
teed by the Constitution is that of a parson's right to his
freedom.

This Court has held in legions of cases that property

and other rights are insignificant in comparison to one's
right to his liberty.
If this be the case, then by what possible logica can
it be said that state administrative remedies need be exhausted
before one can invoke federal court jurisdiction to

seek relief

from alleged illegal incareerta-ticn while these 3ame remedies
need not be exhausted with respect to alleged conditions of
confinement such as food privileges, censorship, et cetera?
To us the question, we submit, is to answer it? or.

10

more simply stated, has this Court, said in the past that the
state can be trusted with the most precious of all person's
rights, his liberty, but yet cannot be trusted with his
property rights and other privileges?

We certainly think this

is not. the case»
Monroe'simply held that the right to litigate in the
state courts could not deprive a citizen of his right to im­
mediate recourse to the federal courts, but in so holding,
this Court specifically noted that one of the three main pur­
poses of 1983 was to provide a federal remedy where the state
remedy, though adequate in theory,, was not available in prac­
tice.
As this Court knows, the doctrine of Monroe was ex­
tended two years laters in McNeese, a school system case, to a
questionable

administrative remedy, as contrasted with the

judicial remedy in Monroe.
In McNeese* Justice Douglas addressed it for the
first time, that the court's supplementary language in Monroe
actually represented a fourth purpose.

But as Judge Noel, in

Sgner v. Texas City, said, “to read the court's supplementary
language as creating a fourth and virtually unlimited occasion
for the application of section 1981 would render superfluous
Monroe's extensive previous discussion of the second and the
third statutory purposes,"
Then eight years after McNesse, in the majority per

11
curiam opinion in Wilwording, -cite statement appears — and I
might say without war — that an inmage need not seek question­
ably available administrative remedies.

We submit,, however,

that as the dissenters did in the Fourth Circuit, this loose
statement from the per curiam Wilwording holding is based upon
a faulty reading of the predecessor cases and should not and
doss not represent the state of the existing law.
Moreover, the unanimous views of all seven of the
Circuit Court judges below reflected a deep disenchantment
with a non-exhaustion rule followed and applied only because
they said we have no alternative,

and the agitation that this

Court reexamine and modify its earlier decisions.
We would hope that a reexamination will result in a
clarification of the per curiam Wilwording holding in favor of
a narrower and mors accurate reading of the six-to-three
majority opinion in Monroe.

Such a clarification, we submit,

is similar fc the one undertaken by this Court in 1973 in
Miller v. California.

There it; was stated that the Ross test

of obscenity had been drastically altered in 19 SS by the
plurality opinion in Memoirs v. Massachusetts, so as to require
prosecutors to prove a negativo that the material is utterly
without redeeming social value.,
Following this Court’s opinion in Memoirs, a multitude
of per curiam opinions breathed life into the utterly without
redeeming social value test, and thereby seemed to establish

12
that as a -basic to,-re which was thereafter considered control­
ling in numerous lower court decisions under the doctrine
which we call creeping stare decimis.

The-Miller decision however finally returned the case
law in this area to its proper and established path.
Court was shorn

As this

of its questionable role as a super-censor,

and as the lower courts were shorn of their roles as censors
by the reexamination and clarification of Memoirs by Miller.
So also will this Court only be shorn of the role of super­
warden by a proper clarification of Monroe and its progeny in
this1, case.

The same, of course, would apply to the role of

the lower federal courts as being the wardens of the various
institutions throughout this country.
The nature of the administrative remedy provided by
the legislature of Maryland makes the time and the setting
particularly right for re-analysing and restating the law of
this vary thorny subject,
Maryland's Inmate Grievance Commission presents this
Court with a case of first impression.

Two if its members

must be lawyers and two of its members must be expert in the
field of correction.

The commission is headed by an executive

director who has significant professional experience and sig­
nificant professional assistance.

Only those grievances or

complaints which are wholly lacking in merit may b© dismissed
without a hearing.

All of the rest must be the subject of a

13
hearing on the merits, with the full panoply of due process
rightso

The commission must decide the matter promptly in a

written order,, containing findings of fact, delivered to the
Secretary, who must affirm, modify or reverse within fifteen
days..

If the action is favorable to the. inmate, the Secretary

is directed to implement the order and to take whatever action
he deems appropriate in light of the commission's findings.
If unfavorable, judicial review is immediately available to
the inmate in the state courts under the administrative
Procedure act.
Surely, it cannot be said that Maryland,3s remedy is
inadequate solely because it does not provide for money
damages, which are appropriate

which are really not appro­

priate or available in the vast majority of 1933 prisoner
suits.
Meaningful relief in practically all such cases is
achieved by declaratory or injunctive relief, ‘that is deter­
mination of an unconstitutional prison practice.

And the

narrow category of cases where monetary damages may be appro­
priate and available, the federal court could simply stay its
hand until the completion of the administrative proceeding,
!

thus gaining the benefit of the.record there made.
As the District Court below said in Washington, the
short answer to this is that since the commission has been
invested with powers comparable to the equity power of a

14
federal court, the prisoner will not he prejudiced by delaying
an award of damages until the previous procedures have been

exhausted.
Respondents have raised several objections to the
adequacy of Maryland's administrative remedy.

They say that

54 percent of the grievances filed are dismissed without a
hearing, as wholly lacking in merit, and that in only 11.4 per­
cent of the cases is the grievance found to be meritorious.
First of all, we would note that 938 or 55 percent
of the cases disposed of ware disposed of administratively to
the satisfaction of the inmate generally through the offices
of the commission.

And of the remaining 744 cases, 191 were

decided in favor of the inmate.

This represents a 65 percent

favorable disposition, instead of the 11.4 percent as alleged
by the respondents.
We would also note that the federal court, under
section 1915, possesses the identical authority to dismiss
wholly frivolous and forma paupa suits and respondents8 own
statistics establish that only 4.9 percent of federal civil
rights suits ever reach trial, and it is not unlikely that
an even lower percentage are ultimately disposed of favorably
to the inmate.
Finally, respondents complaint about the lapse of 24
weeks between the filing of the complaint 'and the final de­
cision thereon.

The actual time today, we would say, is 94.9

15
days.

The average time elapsing between the date of the filing

of all grievances and all dispositions is only 40.6 days.

By

contrast, the elapsed time in federal court between the filing
of a 1983 prisoner suit and its ultimate disposition at the
trial table is. we understand; some 24 to 36 months.
To comprehend the problem that Maryland has sought
to be and the context of that problem* it is helpful to remember the language of Mr. Justice Stewart in Preiser, oho,
after discussing the ’intime day-to-day relationship of the inwith the state, commented,, "’The strong considerations of
comity that require giving a states court system that has con­
victed a defendant the first opportunity to correct its own
errors

thus also require giving the states the first oppor­

tunity to correct the errors made in the internal administra­
tion of their prisons."
Mr, Justice Powell expressed similar concerns in
Proeunier, and Mr* Justice Marshall in McKart, and, if 1 may,
1 would like to quote from his language in that case.

At page

1663, Mr. Justice Marshall said, "Certainly very practical no­
tions of judicial efficiency come into play as well.

A com­

plaining party may be successful in vindicating his rights in
the administrative process.

If he is required to pursue his

administrative remedies„ the courts may never have to intervene,
and notions of administrative autonomy require that the agency
be given a change to discover and correct its own errors.

16
Finally, it is possible that frequent and deliberate flouting
of administrative processes could weaken the effectiveness of
an agency by encouraging' people to ignore its practices.n

We disagree with the findings of the Circuit Court,

the Fourth Circuit in this case.

Judge Northrop, the court

I?
below, made very extensive- findings of fact and found that the
practice which. he complained about was not improper, was not
illegal, did not violate any of his constitutional rights.

We

think that the Fourth Circuit made a serious mis-take in violat­
ing the long established principle that the findings of fact
fey the court below, who had the opportunity to see the wit­
nesses, to hear the witnesses, to test the credibility of the
witness, that all of the information before it, that the Fourth

MR. BURCH:

There is no question about that, Your

Honor, and I am just saying that we are not ~ the state has
not abolished the practice where it is necessary for the protection of the inmate, as it. was in this case, where it is
necessary for the protection of the other population of the
institution —
QUESTION:

Why is it necessary to take his clothes

Didn’t you say you stripped him?

MR. BURCH:

He was put in isolation for the purpose

of protecting him because he had acted in the very strange
manner, he had threatened to do harm to himself, he was —- his
clothes ware taken away from him so he couldn't strangle him­
self.

Had it not bean don© so and had the man taken his

clothes or his belt or his shirt or his underwear, whatever it
might be, and hung himself, then there would have been a 1983

19
action in the federal courts claiming that the state had failed
to do what was necessary to protect this man against himself.

• yes, those remedies have been established and those steps
have been taken, and to that extent I think that is all the
state could foe expected to do, but we say again, we do not
think that the decision of the Fourth Circuit, is correct when
it made the determination that the lower court was in error.
QUESTIONz

Mr. Attorney General, on that very ques­

tion, am I correct in understanding that the Court of Appeals
did not disagree with the findings of fact, but rather drew
different inferences from those findings?
MR. BURCH%

They did.

The Court of Appeals accepted

the facts as found, but in effect said, as a matter of law,
they amounted up to a denial of constitutional rights under the
Fourteenth Amendment•
QUESTION ?

But we respectfully disagree with that.

ing of fact as clearly erroneous?
MR. BURCH:

No, we think that it was clearly erroneous

on the part of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals to make such

the record.

MR. BURCH:
QUESTION:

The commission cannot award damages.
I understand that, but does it make any

finding with respect to the entitlement to damage or —

22
MR. BURCH%

I do not believe that it makes any find­

ing of fact with respect to damages, but I do believe that what
it does is it develops a record which the Federal District
Court, where a claim Cor damages has been made at the appropri­
ate time, may then have the benefit of that record, a determin­
ation on the face of the record as to whether there has been a
substantive denial which on the face of it would seem to en­
title him to damage, with the right in the federal court then
to take such additional action as it deems necessary, such
additional testimony as it deems necessary in order to give
full and final relief..
QUESTION:

Are there an;»* decisions of the Federal

District Court in Baltimore that indicate whether that record
is admissible in evidence?
MR. BURCH:

1 know of none.

As a matter of fact,

they have used it, Mr. Stubman tells me, in summary judgment
proceedings in Maryland, and we know as a matter of fact that
of the .2,504 cases tried before the Inmate Grievance Commission,
about, four or five or six of them have subsequently been filed
as civil rights actions in 1983 cases, and in those eases the
record has been made available to the court and the court has
made good us© of that record.
Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to re­
serve the last several minutes.
I would like to point out.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

ORAL ARGUMENT ©I? CHARLES F, MORGAN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MRo MORGANS

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Courts
The State of Maryland is asking the Court for a de­
cision on the broad question of whether a Maryland prisoner
may be required to exhaust state administrative remedies in an
action properly before it under 42 U.S.C. 1983, alleging viola­
tions of constitutional rights.
The fundamental defect in the state’s argument is
that the asserted remedy, -the Maryland Inmate Grievance Com­
mission, is not an adequate administrative remedy under the
circumstances of these cases.

In addition, the state miscon­

ceives the proper role of this Court in asking that an exhaus­
tion requirement be judicially grafted onto the Civil Rights
Act of 1871.
Whether the exhaustion of administrative remedies
doctrine is to be made applicable to 1983 cases is a matter
for Congress and .not the courts to decide.
The cases before the Court do not present a proper
vehicle for a ruling on the broad constitutional question urged

by the state.

The facts require only a holding that there is

no adequate administrative state remedy for these plaintiffs.

Even in the case where iht exhaustion doctrine is recognised to

24
apply, exhaustion is not required if the proposed remedy is
found to be inadequate or if the purposes of the doctrine will
not b® served»

These cases present exactly that situation.

First, with regard to Milton McCray's separate
actions against Mr. Burrell and Mr. Smith, the only relief
sought by McCray in these cases is damages for being subjected
t© violations of his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.
As the Attorney General pointed out, McCray does
request damages, however, he was incorrect in stating that
McCray requested declaratory and injunctive relief in those
cases.
If I may refer the Court now specifically to the
Appendix, pages 12 and 16 of McCray's pro se complaints, page
22 is his amended complaint in Burrell, page 43 and 137 are
the opening statements by counsel at the evidentiary hearings
in both of those casea, and all of that indicates clearly that
the only request being made by McCray in those cases was for
damages•
I believe when his original pro se complaint was
filed in ©no of the cases, he requested injunctive relief be­
cause at that time he was being subjected to the conditions he
was complaining about, but by the time the case came to trial
it was

quite evident that the only issues before the District

Court had to do with damages.

QUESTION:

How many actions has Mr. McCray brought?

25
MR. MORGAN;

The record reflects that. Your Honor.

I am not sure what the number was.

I think the Attorney

General said 37, and that may be accurate.
QUESTION:

All in the Federal District Court or were

some of them just internal grievances?
MR. MORGAN %

Well, I believe some of them were in the

state court system, as well.
QUESTION:

But you think some 37 court actions?

MR. MORGAN:

That is reflected somewhere in the

record in Chief Judge.Northrop!s opinion.

I don't have the

figure, but it is high.
QUESTION:

I thought he said 55.

It doesn't make

any difference, but ~
MR. MORGAN:
QUESTION:
MR. MORGAN:

I am not sure about that.
It is a difference of 16.
As the state concedes, the Maryland

Inmate Grievance Commission does not have the authority to
award either compensatory or punitive money damages, and when
an administrative agency is not empowered to grant relief,
affective relief or, in this case, any relief, it must be
deemed to be an inadequate remedy, and exhaustion should not
be required.
In addition, in both of McCray's cases, the District
Court held evidentiary hearings and ruled on the merits.

The

Court of Appeals reversed the District Court and also reached

26

the merits, remanding the cases to the District Court for determination of whether Burrell and Smith may have availed
themselves of qualified immunity and good-faith defense*
QUESTION?

Mr. Morgan, to back up a minute, what

authority does this Maryland Commission have to enforce its
rulings?
MR. MORGAN:

Well, Your Honor, the Commission under

the statute has no enforcement authority whatsoever.
QUESTION:

For example, they couldn't issue an in­

junction, could they?
MR. MORGAN:

No, Your Honor.

The only thing that

they can do is make a recommendation to the Secretary of the
Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, who
would then enforce the recommendation if he saw proper to do
so,
QUESTION:
MR. MORGAN:

If he Wanted to?
Well, he has the authority under the

statute to review all —

There is no compulsion.

No, Your Honor, not the Commission di­

It only makes a recommendation to the Secretary.
QUESTION:

What is the history of it?

Do they or do

27
they not make corrections pursuant to recommendations?
MR. MORGAN?
QUESTIONS
MR. MORGAN:

'The prison system?
Yes.
Well,- Your Honor, I don't think there is

anything in the record that reflects that one way or another.
There was some testimony taken in one particular case where in
fact McCray had gotten relief from the Grievance Commission
which had been affirmed by the Secretary on the question of
whether he should be present whan his cell was searched.

The

evidence indicated at the hearing that that directive of the
Commission had never been enforced ny the Maryland Penitenti­
ary and that the excuse that they used was that they had a
shortage of manpower.

That is the only example that I know of

in the record.
No purpose would be served inasmuch as McCray's case
has already been ruled on the merit3 in having him go back to
the state administrative remedy at this late stage in his
cases.
In John Washington’s case against officials of
Maryland9s Pautuxanfc Institution for denial of medical treat­
ment is also a claim for damages.

He requested declaratory

relief in his pro se complaint, but the declaratory relief was
only to the extent necessary to achieve an award of damages on
the declaration.
The Inmate Grievance Commission again cannot provide

28
the relief requested to Washington because it. has no power to
award damages and therefore it again is an inadequate adminis­
trative remedy in his case.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Morgan, didn8t we have that sort of

bifurcation in Preiser, it was clear that the damage claim of
a prisoner could be retained on the docket of the District
Court but that his claim for other relief might have to go
through state exhaustion?
MR. MORGAN?

Yes, sir, I think that was implicit in

Preiser and perhaps even discussed there, but the circumstances
are quite different here, where there is no request for equit­
able relief being made in any of these cases.

The only request

for relief is for damages.
In addition to 'the fact that the Grievance Commission
cannot award the relief to Washington that he wants, Washington
was released from confinement from Pautuxant Institution in —
QUEST 1'ONs

All of them involve, I take it, as a

predicate to damage award, a declaration of some breach of
federal lav??
MR, MORGAN?

It would require a finding of fact by

the District Court.
QUESTION:

A determination that there was a violation

of the Federal Constitution rights?
MR. MORGAN:
Court, yes, sir.

That would be required in the District

29
In addition to the fact that McCray cannot be
awarded the relief he seeks by the Grievance Commission, he
has been released from Pautuxant and by the terms of the
Grievance Commission statute he can no longer file a complaint
with the Grievance Commission, so w® would suggest that the
issue of exhaustion in McCray's case is moot

rather, in

Washington9s case, is moot at this time»
The fourth case before the Court, that of James E.
Stokes against officials of the Maryland Penitentiary,
alleging that the institution's procedures and standards for
censorship of literature* prisoners may read and receive are
unconstitutional, should also be decided by the Court on
narrow grounds»

In his pro se complaints, Stokes sought

damages and injunctive relief.
For purposes of his damage claim, again the Inmate
Grievance Commission is an inadequate state remedy.

And as

we indicated in the supplemental brief which respondents
filed, because of two recent judicial decisions which directly
affect Stokes, he no longer finds it necessary to pursue his
claim for equitable relief when his case returns to the
District Court.
v

Stokes has authorized us to state here today

that he will only request damages when his case again reaches
the District Court.
He has been transferred from the Maryland Penitenti­
ary to Pautuxant Institution, where he is. now committed as a

30
defective delinquent for an indeterminata sentence under an
order by a judge of the Baltimore City Circuit Court»

Although

that decision has been appealed by the state,. Stokes has no
present interest vv’hich is affected by Maryland Penitentiary
censorship regulations.
In addition, the identical constitutional claim made
by Stokes to the regulations at the penitentiary has been de­
cided by District Court Judge Kaufman in another case filed
by another penitentiary prisoner*

Whatever the outcome of the

state's appeal in that case, Stokes5 equitable claim will be
resolved there,
QUESTION %

Well, what if on the state's appeal that

is reversed?
MR. MORGAN:

Well, Your Honor, we are not saying that

the decision in the Hopkins case, which is the case I was re­
ferring to, will necessarily rule in Stokes' favor, but it will
resolve Stokes0 issue one way or another.
identical, Your Honor.

The issue is

Stokes is claiming that the standards

for censorship of literature at the penitentiary and also the
due process safeguards in connection with the censorship
decision-making were inadequate and denial of due process*
QUESTION:

So you say that however the Court of

Appeals rules on it, it will either

a decision in favor of

the appellant here will be unfavorable to your client, and a
decision in favor of the appellee will foe favorable to him and

31
he will be bound in either event?
MR. MORGANS

He will be bound by that, except with

regard to his damage claim, which applies only to his specific
instance of being denied specific literature several years ago.
For all of these reasons, under the facts of the
cases before the Court, Maryland doss not provide an adequate
administrative remedy for these plaintiffs.
There is another reason why the Court should not de­
cide the broad question of policy raised by the state.

If

section IS83 is to be amended by adding an exhaustion of state
administrative remedies requirement, that amendment should be
made by legislation and not by judicial decree.

The state, in

asking the Court to assume the -- the state is asking the
Court to assume the rule of Congress.
In fact, the state's own argument leads inescapably
to the conclusion that any fundamental change in the scope of
1983 should be made by CongressGOESTION:
MR. MORGANs
QUESTION :

Mr. Morgan —
Yes, Your Honor?
— why do you say that only Congress

could make some interpretation of section 1983?
MR. MORGANs

Well, Your Honor, that was exactly the

point I was about to develop, if I can carry -through with it.
QUESTIONi
MR. MORGAN;

Fine.
Why is Congress —

32
QUESTION s

Why do you say that we lack power to re­

interpret, if we decided to do it, 1983?

Prior to 1963, in

Monroe v. Pape, this was certainly an unsettled issue at best»
MR. MORGAN;

Yes, Your Honor,

Well, the position

that we taka with regard to that is that in Monroe ?, Pape,
this Court interpreted congressional intent behind section —
what was then 1979, which is now section 1983,

That congres­

sional intent was stated in Monroe v. Paper and has been
stated by the Court in decisions subsequent to that.

The

congressional intent was that the state remedy be — that the
federal remedy foe supplementary to the state remedy and that
the state remedy need not be first exhausted before the
federal remedy may foe invoked.
Now, what the state is suggesting in this case is
that this Court reinterpret the intent of section 1983«

There

is no further evidence before the Court that the interpreta­
tion of legislative intent in Monroe v. Pape was incorrect.
The state's position is that, because Maryland has an adequate
Inmate Grievance Commission, that now the Court is free to
disregard the intent that was expressed in Monroe v, Pape and
to create an exhaustion requirement.

Well, may 1 interrupt you —
Yes, sir.

33

QUESTION:

— because it might shorten your answer,

I can understand how you could argue with some force that
there are precedents of this Court that should not be re~
considered,, but you are suggesting, are you? that we have no
authority to reconsider them?
HP,» MORGAN:

I am not suggesting that the Court has

no authority, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

What are you arguing?

MR. MORGAN:

But we are arguing that this would be

an improper role for the Court to take.
QUESTION s

Improper?

MR. MORGAN:

Ail improper role for the Court to take,

particularly with regard to prisoner grievance mechanisms, for
seme of the reasons that I would like to express, if I may.
What the substance

and I think this goes more

directly to your question, Your Honor — what the substance of
the petitioners’ argument is is that because times are now
different than they were in 1871, an exhaustion of remedies
rule for 1383 is now appropriate.

This argument, however,

should be made to Congress and not to the Court, and the reason
is that if times have changed, as the state argues, it is
Congress which should reevaluate the policies underlying its
18/1 determination that there should he no exhaustion of state
remedies in 1983.
QUESTION:

For example ~~
What is your authority for saying that

34
Congress made a determination in 1871 that there should be no
exhaustion of administrative remedy?

I mean does that come

from legislative history?
Your Honor„ 1 think that comes from a

MR. MORGAN?

long line of decisions from this Court, beginning with Monroe
v„ Pape and extending through Damico and McNeese and District
of Columbia v. Carter, and all the cases that are cited in
the
QUESTION:

Okay,

You can argue it on two different

grounds here and it strikes me that perhaps — at least 1'
don't understand you as to be firmly committed to one or the
other or to perhaps both.

You can say that, regardless of

what the prior cases of the Court have said, even if we are
writing on a clean slate, you go back to the legislative his­
tory and it is clear that Congress did not intend that admin­
istrative remedies to be exhausted, or you can say that even
though there might be doubt as to the legislative history, the
precedents of the Court say that administrative remedy should
not be exhausted.

Now7, do you assert both of those grounds

or, if not, which one?
MR. MORGAN:

But we assart that the question of what

legislative intent was behind 1871 is no longer open, that
that question has been decided by this Court in Monroe v.
Paper and reaffirmed over and over in the other decisions.
QUESTION:

Even though in Monroe v. Paper the Court

35
was confronted only with judicial remedy?
MR. MORGAN:

Well? that’s true? only judicial

remedies in that case, Your Honor —
QUESTIONs
MR. MORGAN:

We are not bound by dicta, are we?
No, sir, but past Monroe v. Paper there

was a series of decisions that decided that the intent of the.
1871 Act applied not only to judicial but also to administrative remedies and also that it applied to remedies which were
available and adequate, that the fact of adequate available
remedies made no difference in what the congressional intent
was.

And having established that as the congressional intent,

it would be improper

in the absence of some evidence that

there was different congressional intent for anyone besides
Congress to reevaluate the policies that underly the 1871 Act.
We would suggest that tills is a particularly inap­
propriate time for the Court to act on this because at this
very moment there are two bills pending before Congress -~

I don’t know why you use the term "inap­

To Mr. Justice Powell, you suggested lack of

Now, which is your point?
MR. MORGAN:

Well, Your Honor, I think it is really

— the proper term is inappropriate.

I think what I am sug­

gesting is that under the circumstances of what the state is
arguing in this ceise, that this Court should give proper
deference to the role of Congress in amending section 1983.

36

As an example, I think the way in which the Court handled
Preiser v. Rodriguez, where the Court gave specific deference
to explicit congressional intent in the habeas corpus statute
and thereby carved out an exception to section 1983, there was
no exhaustion requirement attached to 1983 but because of
explicit congressional intent that there should be certain
cases which cannot be brought under 1983, then, under those
circumstances there should foe exhaustion and it seems to me
that that is what we are arguing, that there should foe that
proper deference given to what Congress intended, especially
in this case, where the Court has already found what Congress
intended in Monroe and all the cases that followed.
As 1 was mentioning, there are two bills presently
pending before Congress,

Congressman Railshack has introduced

H.R. 12008 and Congressman Rodino ha.3 introduced H,R, 12230,
and both of these bills are new pending before the House
Committee on the Judiciary,

If the bills are enacted, they

would amend section 1983 to impose an exhaustion of state
administrative remedies requirement for state prisoners.
In addition to the broader policy question —
QUESTION:
MR, MORGANS

One by Mr. Rodino and one by Mr.

Railsback.
QUESTION:
MR. MORGAN:

Have there been any hearings on them?
I don't know, sir.

I don't believe so.

And X believe there is also another bill that has been intro­
duced by Congressman Xastenmeier which does not specifically
speak to exhaustion of administrative remedies, but X believe
which has provisions in it which deal with the problem that
the District Courts have in handling prisoner complaints.
QUESTION:

Mr. Morgan, do those bills merely provide

for exhaustion in prisoner cases or in cases generally?
MR. MORGAN:
specifically,

I can speak to the Railsback bill

That specifically is directed to prisoners, and

I believe that Rodino’s bill is also specifically directed to
prisoners.

MR. MORGAN:

QUESTION:

What is the rationale, as you understand

it, that is being offered for a requirement of exhaustion?
MS. MORGAN:

I think %/hat the state is saying in this

developed what they say is an adequate state administrative
remedy^ that this-Court-should then require state prisoners
to exhaust that remedy»
QUESTIONS

Although eoneededly there is no damage

remedy and eoneededly 1 suppose administrative processes in
the Maryland prison isn't going to decide a constitutional
question?
MR, MORGAN %

X think that in the way in which the

Inmate Grievance Commission is set up, there is certainly far
from any guarantee that the Inmate Grievance Commission is
going to be adequately able t© solve constitutional questions»
QUESTIONs

Well, administrative procedures usually

don't declare some prison regulation unconstitutional, for
example?
MR. MORGAN?

Well, X think at most what the Grievance

Commission could do would be to declare that a prison regula­
tion

no longer meets sound correctional standards, but I

don't think if is qualified to declare something unconstitu­
tional.
QUESTION%

At the most that exhaustion — isn’t the

most that exhaustion would produce is a remedy that would
perhaps obviate a resort to the federal court?
MR. MORGAN:

I think that that is one of the primary

policies that underly an exhaustion requirement in any

39
circumstances.

In a sense —

QUESTIONs

I suppose, first of all,, that the hope of

a lot of these potential lawsuits 'would disappear through
accommodation in the administrative remedy stage and they
would therefore never get to court? and, secondly, that those
that did get to court would perhaps save the judge time because
some of the issues might have bean eliminated or at least ---and others refined, and the position of the state would be
better known and the administrative procedure would have served
to separate some ©f the wheat from the chaff.

I suppose those

are the two *— would be the two grounds for these proposed,
bills and for the position of the state in this case?
MR. MORGAN?

It would seem to me, Your Honor, that

the fundamental purposes of exhaustion should be to create a
record for the District Court and also to allow the agency an
opportunity to correct its own errors.

Yes, sir.

What I was leading to was in

the habeas corpus situation, for example, where Congress has
enacted specific statutes and says specifically how the District
Court may use the state court proceedings, now there is no such
statute in existence now as to how the District Court can use
state administrative remedies proceedings.

some trouble, if the judge nevertheless used it.
QUESTION;

QUESTION;

Some might be admissible and some might

not.
MR. MORGAN;

Well, we take the position that under

the grievance commission statute as it presently exists with­
out enabling legislation from Congress, that the District Court
simply cannot use the record of the administrative agency pro­
ceeding as any more than a, matter of interest to read the facts

41
of what perhaps happened.

But as far as using it in the

decision-making process;, we would say that that would be in­
appropriate in the absence of legislation,

hud more particu-

/

larly, we believe that legislation is particularly — that that
kind of a requirement should not be imposed without legisla­
tion because, really, it is only Congress who is able to
evaluate all the interests that are involved, the state's
interest, the court's interest, and the prisoner's interest,
in setting up what would be an effective remedy that would
serve the purposes of allowing the agency to correct its own
errors and also serve the purposes of the District Court, and
no

— that was a dissenting opinion.

Mr.

James Bennett is a member of the commission in Maryland, and I
think his dissenting opinion is particularly relevant to the

situation before the Court„ because in that opinion he
describes the really chaotic decision-making and fact-finding
process of the Inmate Grievance Commission, and certainly that
kind of a remedy is not the kind of a remedy that will serve
any valuable purpose in the District Court.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Morgan, when did the Commission com­

mence to function?
MR. MORGAN£

1 think it was 1971 legislation that set

up the Commission, and I think they began to function about a
year later.
QUESTION:

Does the record show how many cases the

Commission has processed to final decision?
MR. MORGAN:

In our supplemental brief I think that

we brought those statistics up to date.
QUESTION!

If they are in the brief, do you recall

generally what they are?
MR. MORGANj

I think that they are referred to

certainly the record of the case at the time that there was an
evidentiary hearing in the court contained that information,
and I think it has bean updated through our supplemental brief
and also through some of the materials filed by the state in
the case.
QUESTION:

Is there any indication as to what per­

centage of the final decisions of the Commission in fact are
taken into the federal court?

MR. MORGAN:

Mo, Your Honor, I haven’t heard that.

The Attorney General stated today a figure which I haven’t
heard before, and —
QUESTION;
MR. MORGAN;

1 heard him state that,
— I don't believe that figure is in

the record, and I haven’t heard it from any other source.

I

do know that as far as the roost recent performance of the
Grievance Commission, in the supplemental brief that we filed,
we indicated recent statistics that indicate in only one out
of a hundred cases of prisoner complaints does the Grievance
Commission grant relief, and that is relief granted after a
hearing and after final review by the Secretary, and that is
during the past four-month period,.
i..

Earlier — and this is reflected in the record of
the case, and is on page BO of our brief — the Attorney
General made reference to the allegation that the Grievance
Commission informally resolves many of the complaints that
come before it and therefore there is no need for a hearing.
However, in discovery in this case, we asked the Executive
Director about specific cases over, I believe, a 90-day period,
which ha described as a typical period of time for the com­
mission, and during that period of time there were 45 complaints
administratively dismissed, and only 4 of those were complaints
that were informally resolved to the satisfaction of the inmate.
So we would suggest that of that E5 or 65 percent of the cases

44
which are administratively dismissed, only a very small per­
centage of those, perhaps 10 percent or less, are actually re­
solved to the satisfaction of the prisoner — that, and when
added to the fact that only 1 percent of those which ultimateiy go to a hearing, indicates

t\

very, very low number of

cases»
QUESTION:

Does the record show many —

QUESTION:

Mr» Morgan, what do you mean by the term

"satisfaction of the inmate"?
MR. MORGANs

Your Honor, that terra was used by the

Executive Director in his deposition, and I think again that
indicates the difficulty in trying to impose an exhaustion re­
quirement to 1983, because it is difficult to say what it
means “to the satisfaction of the inmate."

Does it mean that

he will no longer pursue his claim into court?

Does it mean

to his satisfaction within the confines of Grievance Commission
jurisdiction, which means that he will go on for damages, or
what?

It is really extremely difficult to aay what the state

means by the Grievance Commission having responded satisfac­
torily to an inmage.
QUESTION’S

Mr. Morgan, do you know if those statis­

tics are very different from the percentage of cases that are
resolved satisfactorily to the innate that are filed in
federal court?

MR. MORGANS

No, sir, X don't know what the statistics

ara on that,
QUESTION:

It is a fairly low percentage there, too,

I believe.
MR. MORGAN:

I imagine it is low, Your Honor, and I

wasn't suggesting the figure to show that a lot of prisoner
complaints are meritorious and the Grievance Commission is
turning them down.

I brought that figure to the attention of

the Court to indicate that

giving the agency an opportunity to

correct its own action is not what the Grievance Commission is
doing.

If is only correcting its own action in one out of a

hundred cases.
QUESTION s

Well, it is finding that the original

action need not be corrected, isn5f that a fair statement,

from

its point of view?
MR. MORGAN:

Perhaps, yes, sir.

If I may, I would like to direct just the .last few
minutes that. I have in the case to the merits of Milton McCray’s
claims.

The facts of these cases are set forth in the brief

and basically the important facts are that McCray was placed
into isolated confinement on two separate occasions.

The con­

ditions of isolated confinement in one case, the Burrell case,
were particularly severe, more so than in the Smith case.

In

that situation, he was placed in a small cell, naked, without
any bedding, without any mattress, the cell was cold, there
was no toilet in the cell, he was denied all elements of

46
personal hygiene for a two-day period, was even denied toilet
paper during that period of time.

)

His toilet was a 6- to 8-

inch in diameter hole in one corner of the cell, with an iron
grating over it, which was encrusted with the excrement of
prisoners who had been in that cell before bins.

He remained

there for two days without ever receiving any kind of counsel­
ing, medical attention or professional help from a psychiatrist
or a psychologist»
And the basis of our argument is that, although there
was perhaps a reason to have placed McCray into an isolated
confinement situation, because he needed to be isolated from
,

the rest of the population to avoid creating a disturbance and
for his own protection, our* claim is that the conditions of
isolated confinement and the length of isolated confinement
for McCray were arbitrary under the circumstances and a viola­
tion of the Fourteenth Amendment»
The directive, the regulation of the-Maryland Prison
System provided a liberty interest that McCray had in not being
thrown into isolated confinement for arbitrary reasons»

In

addition to that, Wolff v. McDonnell seems to establish that
^

some minimal form of due process is available to a prisoner
before going into solitary confinement.

I

Under these circum-

stances, ra say that McCray was not entitled to a Wolff to
McDonnell hearing, but what we do say is that he was entitled
to a minimum of procedure in order to assure that the conditions

47
of confinement and the length of confinement were necessary.
And we say that the rule of reasonableness in this case is
Maryland Penitentiary's own administrative directive, that the
Court of Appeals gave proper deference to Maryland prison
officials by suggesting that that was the minimum constitutional standards.
In answer to the question posed earlier by Your Honor,
we are not suggesting that the mere violation of a state regula­
tion raises a constitutional claim in this case.

We are saying

that, first of all, the regulation serves two purposes in the
case;

first of all, it establishes a liberty interest on the

part of McCray, an interest that cannot be deprived without soma
kind of minimal procedure to assure that it is not arbitrarily
deprived? and, second, the regulation provides a standard for
what is minimally reasonable under the circumstances.
QUESTION5

It is —

I suppose you could argue, too, that since

the state has been willing to adopt it, it doesn’t unreasonably
frustrate the goals of the prison administration?
MR. MORGAN:

That certainly is our position, Your

Honor, and in the brief we cite

a number of other state and

federal prison regulations which are similar or even more
restrictive of prison officials.

So certainly what Maryland

has imposed or. its own prison officials is the bar-;-; minimum
under these circumstances, and McCray didn’t get them.
QUESTION:

Mr, Morgan, just to; make sure I understand

48
I take it you would be here even if you agreed that the prison
procedure, the grievance procedure was as adequate as a
grievance procedure could he, you would still say that there is
no need to exhaust it?
MR. MORGAN:

Yes, sir, we take a position that the

adequacy of the remedy i.s not the controlling factor.

The con­

trolling factor is the policy argument which underlies section
1983.
QUESTION?

And that aver* though a good and adequate

grievance procedure might scream out or obviate the necessity
of considering 75 percent of the cases, nevertheless the plain­
tiff should be able to directly file under 1983?
MR. MORGAN:

We believe that that kind of an exhaustion

requirement cannot at this point be grafted onto the Civil
Rights Act without congressional amendment.
QUESTION:

Mr. Morgan, you also rely on the Eighth

MR. MORGAN:

MR. MORGAN:

Yes, sir, we do.
You didn't mention that.
And the only reason I didn't direct my­

self to it is because the red light was on.

No, 1 just wanted to be sure.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS 33. BURCH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL
MR. BURCH2

May it please the Court, very quickly I

would like to point out, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that in our
view there was no administrative remedy available in 1871 when
the 1871 Act was passed, so obviously Congress could not have
been addressing itself to administrative remedies.
Secondly, as I said, the 753 of the habeas corpus act,
which was passed in 1857, as construed by the Supreme Court in
Ex Parte Royal, held that it was discretionary with the court
as to whether an exhaustion shall be required.

At least, that

is what should be held in this case, that it is discretionary
with the lower court as to whether there is such an adequate
administrative remedy that exhaustion should be required.
QUESTION:

What do you think the basis for requiring

exhaustion is,-Mr'.'Attorney General?
MR. BURCH:

The basis for requiring the exhaustion is

to give the opportunity to the court. — first of all, it is
federal comity, federalism and comity as between the national
system and the state system —
QUESTION:

Yes, but if he is claiming a denial of

constitutional rights, are you suggesting that your administra­
tive procedure would entertain a denial of constitutional rights
MR. BURCH:

I would say that the same situation would

prevail with respect to the 1933 cases as prevailed with respect

to the 'habeas corpus cases.

There certainly is far greater

reason to not have exhaustion of remedies —

I know,, but certainly your state

courts are bound by the Federal Constitution and -MR. BURCHs

That is exactly right, and so are our

administrative agencies.
QUESTION3

I know, but you don't usually see adminis­

trative agencies entertaining claims of constitutional law.
MR. BURCH;

vise them through the office of the Attorney General, that they

Well, an administrative agency, for example,

•couldn' t declare one of the regulations that had been issued
unconstitutional, could it?

They may hold that relief should be

constitutional .

But there is also a right of appeal to the

state courts, and in the last analysis after there has been the

courts under 1383.
QUESTION:
an adequate remedy?

Mr. Attorney General, do you consider this
Three members of the Commission, found the

grievance lacking in merit and ordered the case dismissed.
This member was erroneously listed as concurring in the result.
This was apparently due in part to the fact that there was, as
usual, no discussion of the ease among the members prior to the
drafting of the order, and also to the general confusion, din
and noise surrounding the proceedings, held in a basement, room
that had bean scooped out during the construction of 'the build­
ing of the penitentiary in 1804.

QUESTIONi

Robert Burrell, et al. v. McCray, et al.,

No. 75-44.
MR. BURCH t

Well, 1 can only say that it is certainly

his opinion and I airs not. in a position to comment upon that,
•Your Honor.

If that is Mr. Bennett’s opinion, that is his

opinion.
We say that at least the Court ought to give the
District Court the opportunity to make a determination as to
whether or not the remedy is adequate, whether it be in this
case or whether it be in any other case or whether it be in any
case throughout the United States e because .some relief must be
granted to the states and to the federal courts if we are going
to see that there is an expeditious handling of all the state
prisoner complaints throughout ‘the United States, and we say
that, unlike what Mr, McCray’s attorney has said, we say that
actually there are far more cases where there are favorable
decisions in favor of the inmate by virtue of the use of the
inmate grievance provisions than there are otherwise, because
of the following of the 19£3 case».
1' would ask the Court please to look at Lane v.
Wilson in 307 TJ.-S., which is not cited in our brief, and
Covington v. Edwards in. 260: Fed 2d, because I think they give
the background historically of what the 1383 cases permitted
with respect to administrative remedies.
