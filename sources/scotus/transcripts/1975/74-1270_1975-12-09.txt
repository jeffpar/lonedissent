L Zl 2. £ E H DINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

in No. 74-1270, Russell Train, Administrator of the Environ­
mental Protection Agency against Colorado Public Interest
Research Group.
Mr. Randolph, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. RAYMOND RANDOLPH, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. RANDOLPH:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on writ of certiorari to the
Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.

The issue is one of

statutory interpretation and, we believe, one of considerable
importance.
The question is whether nuclear materials, nuclear
waste materials, that are already comprehensively controlled
and regulated by the successor agencies to the Atomic Energy
Commission are pollutants within the meaning of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act as amended in 1972.
If they are pollutants, the result is that these
same nuclear materials will be under the regulatory control
of the Environmental Protection Agency and if one accepts the
argument of the 14 states who are here as Amicus Curias,
eventually under the control of the individual states.
The case arises as a result of a suit that was

4
brought in October of 1973 in the District Court of Colorado
by two organizations representing college students and lav;
students attending school in Colorado and also four indivi­
dual citizens of the state.
The Respondents, who were Plaintiffs below, sought
a declaratory judgment and an injunction against the EPA and
its administrator for failing to requirite the particular
material, nuclear material that was involved in this case.
They pointed to the fact that there were two
facilities, two nuclear facilities within the State of
Colorado*

One was the Fort St., Vrain generating pov;er

station which is a nuclear reactor qas-cooled that had at
that time not yet been in operation and the other was the
Rocky Flats Plant which is a plant that, fabricates plutonium
for use in weapons*

It is owned by the Federal Government,

specifically the Energy Research and Development Administra­
tion and run by a private company*
The record here is very, very sparse.
was decided on cross-motion for summary judgment*
it

This case
Actually,

could have been judgment on the pleadings.
There were only two things outside of the record

both of which are in the Appendix,

There are two exhibits in

regard to draft permits for the Fort St. Vrain Generating
Station.
The District Court granted the Environmental

5
Protection Agency’s notion for summary judgment and this was
at the pleading stage»
The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the EPA
had the responsibility and duty of regulating the material
in question here.
Before I proceed to the argument I think some
statutory background is necessary in light of this very sparse
record»
The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 conferred upon the
Atomic Energy Commission, which is now the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, and ERDA a complete, extensive, exclusive authority
and control over the use and disposal

of certain nuclear

materials.
These materials fall into three categories cf
substances which are set forth in the footnotes in our brief
at page 20„
First of all, source material.
Source material means materials such as
S.

uranium 238,

’

.

from which nuclear fuel is extracted.
The second kind of material that is involved here is
special nuclear material such as fissionable material.

That

is uranium 233, uranium 235 and plutonium.
The third

kind of material in addition to source

and special nuclear material is by-product material.

That

means the material that is produced from the fission process

6
itself and made radioactive as a result of that process»
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has established
maximum permissible limits on the releases of radioactivity
into the environment by its licensees.
Its licenses further limit to a minute percentage of
those maximum limits the amount that an individual licensee
like the Fort St. Vrain generating station can release into
the atmosphere, either through the air or through the water.
And, of course, the Court is familiar with the
licensing procedures that the NRC conducts.

They are detailed,

comprehensive and a great deal of time and manpower is spent
before a plant, a nuclear generating plant can even be
constructed, let alone operated.
After it does get constructed there is another
licensing procedure and so on and so forth.
That, essentially, in a nutshell, is what the
Atomic Energy Act doss.
The Water Act, which was amended in 1972 in several
important respects, has as its basic structure in regard to
discharges of pollutants into the water,

one section that

absolutely forbids any discharges of any pollutants into the
navigable waters of the United States without a permit.
The permit can be issued by EPA as would have been
the case in Colorado in 1972 when this case was started, or
v.

if a state has adopted, pursuant to EP/Vs approval, a plan

7
for implementing a permit program, then the authority to
issue permits is transferred from EPA to the state.
Colorado adopted an approved plan as of April of
1975.

It did not have one when this case was begun.
The first point under the Water Act is that, no

discharge of pollutant without a permit.
The term pollutant is defined in Section 5026 of
the Water Act to include"radioactive materials" and I put
quotations around that phrase, "radioactive materials."
This leads to Respondent’s argument which is
essentially set forth in their complaint and is the argument
that was adopted by the Tenth Circuit.
The argument is simply this:
Source, special nuclear, by-product materials under
the Atomic Energy Act are radioactive.
QUESTION:

Is that almost or most radioactive?

MR. RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

No question about it.

I'm not sure about that.

By the —

I read it, rather radioactive.

MR. RANDOLPH:

There are other ways of producing

radioactive material and I am not scientific expert enough
to know what is more or less radioactive.

There are accelera­

tor processes which are not regulated by the Atomic Energy Act.
But they are radioactive.

There is no question

about that.
Therefore, they are pollutants under the Water Act.

8

Therefore, they cannot be discharged without a permit,
at the time, from EPA — now, either from EPA or the State of
Colorado»
Therefore, EPA must regulate the discharge of the
source, special nuclear and by-product material.
EPA refused to do that and what probably precipitated
this suit is the regulation of EPA which is set forth at
page 18 of our brief.
:{|’

Which was adopted in the summer of 1973.

i

In implementing the Water Act, the EPA repeated the
statutory language.

The term pollutant means radioactive

materials discharged into the water.
However, in a comment, the Administrator of EPA
;

j;

stated that the legislative history of Water Act reflects that
the term radioactive materials as included in the definition
of pollutant covers only radioactive materials which are not
‘encompassed in the definition of source, by-product or special
nuclear materials and so forth as covered by the Atomic
•*.f i :

Energy Act.
This legislative history,which is set forth in
detail in our brief and also in the Amicus brief

of the

utilities here which the Administrator relied upon, which
Respondents urge this Court not to look at and which the court
below indicated could be disregarded,

v-e

think demonstrates

conclusively the correctness of EPA’s interpretation of this

9
particular provision in the Water Acte
Before discussing that history, however, I'd like
to discuss and stress a fex* points that we think are importantin approaching this problem.
First of all, there is, of course, on this record
no evidence whatsoever and, in fact, Respondents' complaint
does not even allege that the successor agencies to the
Atomic Energy Commission are .in any way improperly going to
perform their duty in regard to the discharge of nuclear
material in question.
They don't claim that the minute amount now
released could in any way be reduced and indeed, there is no
allegation that there is even the remotest danger to the
health or the environment under the current system of
regulation.
There is nothing, indeed, in the hearings — in the
extensive hearings that took place before the Water Act was
amended in 1972 that indicates anything in regard to any
problem whatsoever from the discharge into the water from
nuclear power plants.
As a matter of fact, the only statement that is
relevant to that question is quoted at the top of the page 43
of the brief Amicus Curiae by the utilities and that state­
ment is from the testimony of Russell Train who is now, of
course, the Administrator of EPA and then was Chairman of

10

the Council on Environmental Quality and he testified that
the existing Atomic Energy Commission regulation of discharges
such as we are talking about from nuclear plants was rigorous
and demanded adherence to "the highest possible standards."
What we are talking about here, in light of the
successors to the Atomic Energy Commission's regulations, are
discharges from nuclear power plants into the water and into
the air that, specifically in regard to the water, cannot
exceed five millirems

per person per year,

They have to be less than that.
A rem is a radioactive dose,

I think the average

person in the United States receives a dose of 500 rem.s,,
But to give the Court an idea of what five millirems
means, it means simply this, that if you stood outside of a
nuclear power plant that was licensed —* and as they have to
be, by the NRC — and took your drinking water from the water
that is discharged from that power plant, for an entire year,
you could not receive a do3e of more than five millirems,
which is equal to or less than the radioactivity that you
would receive from flying from Washington, D,C, to Denver,
Secondly, in establishing the liquid effluent
limitations for nuclear power plants, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission must consider the design and operation of the
plant.

What comes out is intimately related with how the

plant is operated and how it is designed.

11
Reducing the radioactivity discharged into the
water could, as we have stated in our brief, result in serious
problems in regard to increased gas emissions or solid waste
emissions and, indeed, even safety problems.
And let me give the Court an example of what we
mean by this.

The way that these minute actions of

radioactivity get released at all is through an osmosis
process.

There are rods that are submitted and stuck into

the core of a nuclear reactor.

They contain the radioactive

material.
They are made, generally, of stainless steel.

Water

within a loop — this is water that is self-contained —
circulates around those rods as a cooling process.

Other

water flows through to cool that water in the loop.

That

is the water that generally is pumped out at the end of the
process.
The reason any radioactivity gats out at all is

I'
because of a number of things.
Number one, there may be microscopic faults in
that stainless steel.

There is an osmosis process where there

is a transference and so on and so forth.
There is one v?ay, that you don9 fc have to be a
scientist to understand, of stopping that from happening and
that is to increase the thickness of the stainless steel rods.
Increase that, the osmosis stops.

The faults disappear

12

because of the thickness»
Unfortunately, what that would do is require one
thing.

It would require the nuclear generating plant to

operate at a higher temperature and second of all, it would
take more time for that plant to cool down if •— God forbid -there ever were an accident in which the coolant for some
reason or another was not working properly and as the
scientific material that is cited in all these briefs
indicates, the most dangerous problem in operating a nuclear
power plant is loss of coolant because that is when a problem
can occur.
Of course, the NRC follows a rule of three,
generally.

For every system that is needed, they have three

of them.
Everything is bolted on to a povyar plant now that
can prevent the discharge of radioactivity is now bolted on
but that gives, I think, the Court an idea that what «e are
talking about here is not simply putting something on the
end of a pipe to filter out radioactive waste material„
Congredi, itself recognized the interrelationship
that I am talking about,
In the Atomic Energy Act itself, Congress specifi­
cally stated that the NRC was forbidden in anj way to
relinquish its authority and regulatory control over the
material we are talking about.

13
Now, with all this in mind and with the fact that
we have had the Atomic Energy Act on the books now for nearly
20 years at the time the Water Act was passed, we think it
would be remarkable indeed if Congress directed the EPA to
regulate the same nuclear materials for the same purposes that
they are being regulated now by the NRC and it’s at precisely
the same time.
The House Committee Report , which is cited on page
38 of our brief, we thinks, demonstrates that Congress
intended no such thing.
The report says that the term pollutant as defined
in this bill includes radioactive materials but these
materials are not those encompassed in the definition of
source, by-product or special nuclear materials as defined
• V, .

by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 as amended and so on and
,sq forth.

:

;

iwith this legislation because this statement in the House
.Report was specifically cited, and relied upon in later floor
debates and specifically, in order to defeat an amendment
s.ubmdtted by Congressman Wolff that

would have had the effect

14
submitted on the House floor — that would have had the effect
of allowing the states to be able to regulate radioactive
discharges from nuclear power plants»
QUESTION:

Of course, those two are not completely

inconsistent, are they?

One could feel that both EPA and AEG

or whatever its successor is should both regulate and still
feel that the states ought not to regulate,
MR, RANDOLPH:

They are not absolutely inconsistent

but I think it is inconceivable that if Congress on the one
hand writes a statute and then directs in the reports that
they are only dealing with materials that are not regulated
by the AEC that they would want the EPA to regulate that
material, too and it is also inconceivable,, I think, that in
light of the lack of any consideration of xvhat a regulatory
scheme would result from dual regulation by an agency that,
on the one hand, could only regulate how much comes out and
an agency, on the other hand that regulates not only that but
the design, the operation, the licensing function with no
consideration whatsoever, I think that the potential for
inconsistent regulations would certainly be there and it is a
potential that we think would be dangerous for the reasons we
stated and we also think that Congress gave absolutely no
consideration to it whatsoever.
And, indeed, the Wolff Amendment that I was about to
discuss, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, one of the bases on which

15
that was opposed

is that in this act we are not dealing with

the material that is regulated by the Atomic Energy Commission
and therefore we are not going to give it to the states,
A number of Congressmen said, if we want to deal
with that question, let's amend the Atomic Energy Act directly,
not do it collaterally, in which case the legislation should
go through the relevant committee, the Joint Committee on
Atomic Energy, which handles these particular matters.
The Congressmen that spoke out against that amendment
were not only Congressmen who were members of the Joint
Committee on Atomic Energy, but also members of the Public
Works Committee that reported out this bill and the amendment
that I was speaking of, the Wolff Amendment was defeated by a
three-to-one margin.»
On the Senate side, Senator Pastore, who was then
” ^chairman of the

Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, «fought

assurances from Senator Muskie, who sponsored the bill on the
"Senate side, that this legislation that they were then
considering would in no way affect the regulatory responsi"
>-

bility and control under the Atomic Energy Act.
Tiers is no question whatsoever that if the
Environmental Protection Agency is given regulatory authority
over the same materials that that will have an effect on the
responsibility and authority of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.

One hopes it would not be inconsistent but it

16

nevertheless did have an effect,
I think Respondents have sought to —- and the states,
also, have sought to try to vrork out some system that would
operate when you have this redundant regulatory control for
the same purposes of the same material.
Someone has to give way some place and there is no
question, as I said, that that would really be inconsistent
with Senator Muskie8 s assurances to Senator Pastore that the
bill that they had in front of them would not have any effect.
When the Conference Committee reported out this
bill, two members of the

Conference Committee who were in the

House of Representatives again assured that the radioactive
materials did not include the Atomic Energy Act regulated
nuclear materials, confirming the understanding of the
representatives who asked the question.
We think it is important to remember here that we
are dealing with a statute that is directed not to regulating
the activities of the general public.
What we are dealing here with is a statute with
directions to one person, the Administrator of the Environ­
mental Protection Agency, telling him what to regulate and he
is a person that Congress, I think, can, in fact, trust to
know precisely what Congress had in mind.
The Administrator was testifying at the hearings.
He was in active participation with this legislation as it was

17
going through and I would like to read from what Senator
Muskie said on the Senate floor, and this is not quoted

in

any of the briefs so I'll give the Court, the citation.
It is on the second volume of the compiled legis­
lative history on pages 1347 to 1348.
I am taking this out of context.
to do with radioactive material.

It has got nothing

But what he is talking about

is, what the Administrator’s responsibility in defining and
in dealing with the very section we are discussing here, the
section defining a pollutant and Senator Muskie says, "I do
not want to get into the business of defining or applying
these

definitions to particular kinds of pollutants.

That

is an administrative decision to be made by the Administrator.
’'Sometimes a particular kind of matter is a
pollutant in one circvsmsfcance and not in another.
decision to be made.

That is a

I am very reluctant to try to make it

on the floor of the Senate."
He goes on, "This bill does not prohibit discharges.
It prohibits the discharge of pollutants."
So we get back to what a pollutant is under a
particular set of circumstances. "I cannot interpret all the
circumstances.

The Administrator can do so."

I would like to do that to be helpful to my
colleagues but we are going to have to leave it to the
judgment of the Administrator and that is precisely what

18
happened here.

It was left to the judgment of the Administra­

tor and he interpreted the legislative history which we think
is convincing.
Before I leave that, I'd like to mention one other
thing which we think is relevant

— hardly convincing, but

when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and ERDA were formed
by the Reorganization Act of 1974, an amendment was proposed
in the House that would have had the effect of redefining
radioactive materials as used in this act to mean materials
including those now regulated under the Atomic Energy Act.
The Amendment was rejected by voice vote.

The

citations are set out at page 49 of our brief.
In other words, in the House at least, Congress
voted on the question that is before the Court and rejected
amendment to accomplish the result that the Court of Appeals
accomplished here.
That was in December of 1973, a number of months
after the suit had been instituted, well before the Court of
Appeals decision.
QUESTION;

Was it the same Congress as passed the

Water Act or was it the following Congress?
MR. RANDOLPH;
Mr. Justice.

I think it was the following Congress,

I would have to cheek that.

QUESTION:

Mr. Randolph, before you go on —

MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes, Mr. Justice Powell.

19
QUESTION:

The Water Control Act doesn't create any

separate or new commission, as 1 understand it»

There is an

Administrator though, isn't there?
MR» RANDOLPH:

The duties of administering the Water

Act ware given to the Administrative Environmental Protection
Agency.
QUESTION:

So there is no separate staff created by

the Water Control Act?
MR» RANDOLPH:

So far as I knew, no.

There may be

separate commissions for advice on it, for example»
QUESTION:

All right,

MR» RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

Consumer problems and —

So only administrative interpretation of

the 1974 Act has bean by the AEC, as it is now called?
QUESTION:

EPA.

MR», RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

EPA.

EPA, right,

MR, RANDOLPH,

I might say, a/i we said in the foot-

note in our brief, that the views that I am expressing to this
Court, the views that are expressed in our brief, are
concurred in by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the
Energy and Research Development Administration,

I did not

file a separate Amicus brief because I think that as far as
this issue is concerned, that all three agencies are foursquare
set that this material that is sought to be regulated here is

20
not within the jurisdiction of the EPA.
QUESTION:

We have here a disavowal by the EPA, who

is the administrator which is a party hare„
MR* RANDOLPH:

Yes, the Administrator and the agency

itself are the only parties for the ■—
QUESTION:

Yea, they are the only parties, but you

say the successor to the AEC, the NRC takes a quits consistent
position and it does have jurisdiction.
MR. RANDOLPH:
choice.

Oh, that's right.

Well, they have no

Regardless of v/hich way this case goes ~~
QUESTION:

They have, in any event --

MR. RANDOLPH:

They have, I think, in Section 2092

of the Atomic Energy Act, Congress said, you are prohibited
from giving up any regulatory authority.
QUESTION:

But their jurisdiction is exclusive.

MR. RANDOLPH;

Their jurisdiction had been exclusive

until the Court of Appeals decided this case below.

In fact,

as the Court is probably aware, again, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,
there is a possibility of explaining this, but in the northern
states, the power case that was decided by the Eighth Circuit,
was cited and discussed in the brief, the Court of Appeals
there held that the federal law, the Atomic Energy Act,
preempted the state so that one of the reasons was that it was
necessary and, indeed, the legislative history of the Atomic
Energy Act indicated clearly that it was important for one

21
agency feo have exclusive control over this dangerous material.
The Supreme Court, this Court, affirmed that decision
in 405 U.S.
QUESTION %

Are the members of the Nuclear Regulatory

Commission appointed for a term of years or are they removed
at will by the President?

/I
MR. RANDOLPH :
QUESTION s

I don't know.

It seems it might be of some importance

because a response to the argument you just made is that
there is one President and presumably if he thinks the two are
getting out of coordination, he can coordinate them by
removing one or telling one what to do.

■i
On the other hand, .i£ there are fixed terms ~~
MR. RANDOLPH?
...

I know he can remove the EPA

|

Administrator.
QUESTION:

Yes.

But if the Nucleatory Regulatory

Commission has fixed terns, I suppose under Humphrey’s
executor he couldn’t remove them just because he didn’t like
what they were doing.

MR. RANDOLPH:

I suppose that is right.

I don’t

know the answers to that question but I’d be happy to send a
letter to the Court.
The role of the Court of Appeals below, of course,
was the same role that the EPA Administrator had in this case.
That was to effectuate Congress’ intention in this act.

22
I have a note that says they are appointed to a fiveyear term.
And that was to effectuate Congress’ will here.
The court below was looking at the same material, the
same information / the same statutes that the EPA administrator
was interpreting,
ft.

There is an argument here that is put forth that we
think is not really a very proper, persuasive argument. That
if
is that, we 11,/Congress really meant this,, they could have
said it.

Why didn’t they write it in?
Well, the fact of the matter is, the argument begs

/the question because Congress, if you look through the
"■"./legislative history — and most of the members, I would
suppose, read that report, at least, a great many of them

clearly.

Congress can always speak more

But that statement really imposes upon the Congress

some sort of obligation to write in detail every problem
and solve every problem that comes up by writing it into this
language of the act.

23

The Court of Appeals5 role in fchxs case was not to
'.impose that kind of a requirement on Congress, but to
effectuate what its will is»

/I

.
I think we have pointed out in footnote 26 on page
37 of our brief some of the areas that the EPA still has to
regulate.
One of the things we mentioned v?as that EPA was
preparing effluent limitations for radium, uranium and thorium

24
released in ore-mining operations which were not controlled
in any way by the Atomic Energy Act.
I might mention to the Court that these regulations,
proposed regulations by EPA have now been published on
November 6 th, 1S75.

The citation is 40 Federal Register 51722

and,, of course, the EPA still has regulatory authority to set
what is known as the ambient radiation limits and the^ have
done that, as we have mentioned, on page 52 of our brief.
QUESTION:

Does the Atomic Energy Commission have to

observe those?
H-i'

Vi,

MR, RANDOLPHS

Yes.

Yes, they do.

QUESTION:

And yet, all it has any authority over

MR. RANDOLPH;

It is sort of like the Clean Air Act

eysfcem where the EPA set the ambient quality and the air
quality.
QUESTION;

Well, yes, but the EPA there, if states

don't have the right specific source limitations, can set
their own.
MR. RANDOLPH:

No — well, the states do 'Srefulafce

QUESTION:

I know, but at least one authority can

decide what each specific source may contribute to the
pollution of the air.
if
Here, how is/the Atomic Energy Commission wants to

25
permit the release of a certain, amount of radioactive materials,
it may do so right up to the very limit of the EPA general
standard.
MR, RANDOLPHS
QUESTION:

That is right.

Which means no one else may release any.

MR. RANDOLPH:

Wall, no, the EPA general standards

applied to the release of radioactive material from the sources
that are governed by the EENRC so when they say — what they
have set as a 25 millirem standard —
QUESTION s

Can the EPA set specific standards for

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C„ MASTBAUM, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. MASTBAUM:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is a
systematic and comprehensive regulatory scheme designed to
restore and maintain a nation's vital water resources.
Every industrial category and, indeed, every
energy facility in this country is subject to the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act and at the present tine, every
nuclear facility, including those subject to regulation

28
under the atomic Energy Act must obtain a permit pursuant to
the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.
What Petitioners seek to do to exclude AEAregulated materials, that is, radioactive materials subject
to the Atomic Energy Act from the existing from the existing
permits that nuclear facilities must obtain pursuant to the
Water Act.
I would like to make three points this rooming.
The first is that the objectives and purposes of
the Water Act as well as the express statutory language
clearly mandate that all radioactive materials must be
regulated pursuant to that act.
Second, that when the legislative history of the
act is considered fully and in context it clearly indicates
that Congress intended that all radioactive materials be
regulated pursuant

to the Water Act and,

Third, that the preemption involved in the
Northern States power decision has no bearing on the issues
which are presented for review today.
The strategy of the Water Act was to create
spec.i t •! c limits on vhe amount of pollutants that could be
discharged into our nation's water.
To this end, the act gives the EPA sole
responsibility to set effluent limitations and specifically
states that other federal permiting and licensing agencies

29

must accept the EPA limitations and cannot set any of their
own.
The Water Act specifically defines several terms
which indicate that it was the intent of Congress to
regulate all radioactive materials.

Thus, the Act specifi­

cally defines pollutant to include radioactive materials
without limitation or exception.
Further, the Act defines pollution.

Pollution

includes — and this is very important — the man-made or
man-induced alteration of the radiological integrity of
water.
Third, the act prohibits the discharge of highlevel radioactive wastes and radiological warfare agents.
Both of these materials are exclusively regulated
by the Atomic Energy Act and,
Fourth, the Act. states that nuclear steam
electric generating plants are subject to its regulations.
Fifth, the Act regulates toxic pollutants and
hazardous materials and indeed, it is indisputed that as
these terms are used in the Water Act, radioactive materials
would be toxic pollutants and hazardous materials.
The definition of pollutant and pollution are
central to the Water Act for as these terms determine the
scope of the Act Congress recognized the importance of
these terms.

30
Representative Blatnik, member of the FWPCA's
conference committee, made the point succinctly:

"The total

\

utility of the bill is reflected in the definition of the
term pollutant, pollution, point source, discharge and
toxic pollutants."
To revise any of these definitions is to upset the
common thread of the bill.

If there is a part of this bill

that can be labeled most important, it is these definitions.
To revise them in a way to limit their coverage,is to
severely detract from the effectiveness of the bill.
Moreover, these critical definitions as well as
the rest of the Act received microscopic scrutiny from
Congress.
The final bill was subject to a three-month
conference in which the conference committee met 39 times
and according to Senator Muskie, the conference committee
tried to write into express language as clearly as possible
the intent of Congress and not leave final evaluation of
the bill to legislative history.
Thus, the definition of pollutant includes
)

radioactive materials without exception or limitation.
The natural meaning of this term in both its
popular usage and in a technical sense has always meant,
all radioactive materials.
Indeed, the NRC’s own regulations define;

31

radioactive materials as any such material, whether or not
subject to licensing control by the Commission.
This is found in 10 CFR section 20.313.
Furthermore, the definition of pollutant contains
specific exemptions from terms.

This Court has reaffirmed

on numerous occasions that when a statutory phrase contains
specific limitations or exception, no further exceptions are
to be applied.
Moreover, the exemption which the Government is
seeking in this Court would render the FWPCA’s reference to
radioactive materials virtually meaningless for the vast
majority of radioactive materials that are discharged into
water are subject to the Atomic Energy Act.

Nothing is left,

by comparison.
It should also be noted that whenever Congress
has utilized the term radioactive materials in other
legislation, when it has intended to include all radio­
active materials, it has just utilized the term.
When it has intended to exclude those subject to
the Atomic Energy Act, it has said so in express language.
The intent of Congress to include all radio­
active materials within the Water Act is further found in
the definition of pollutant.

The Act defines pollution as

a manmade or man-induced alteration of the radiological
integrity of water.

Radioactive materials

regulated under the Atomic

Energy Act are all manmade or man-induced.

Therefore,

this was the precise type of pollution which Congress had in
mind when it defined pollution to mean the manmade or maninduced alteration of the radiological integrity of water.
Since radioactive materials subject to the Atomic
Energy Act constitute the vast majority of radioactive
materials discharged into water, the exclusion would render
meaningless the Congressional intent to protect the
radiological integrity of water.
In summary, the language of the Act reflects a
consistent intent on the part of Congress to regulate all
radioactive materials.
Under the circumstances of this case, we submit
that resort to legislative history is unnecessary and
unwarranted.

However, since the Government places such

heavy reliance on it, we will present the legislative
history in context.
The Government utilizes the legislative history
in the case at bar to create, not to solve, ambiguity.
It is our position that both the Senate bill and
the Conference Committee plainly intended to include all
radioactive materials.
While the exemption which the Government seeks in
this Court had some support in the House, it never attained

the status of legislative language and was specifically
rejected by the Conference Committee.
QUESTION:

What do you mean when you say it was

specifically rejected by the Conference Committee?
MR. MASTBAUM:

Mr. Justice, the Petitioners have

cited a portion of the House Report.

The Conference

Committee specifically considered the definition of pollutant
and adopted a new definition that was different from both
the House and the Senate versions.
The House had included two addition exceptions to
that definition.

These exclusions were cut out of the

Conference Bill.
Furthermore, the precise language found in the
House report which excluded radioactive materials subject to
the Atomic Energy Act was not found anywhere in the
Conference Report,,
QUESTION:

Well, but it is a little strong to say

that they specifically rejected it, isn't it?

Isn't it more

accurate to say that they came up with different language
which did not include the House provisions?
I mean, you are not talking about, for instance,
a conference report that said the House bill provided such
and such but the Conference determined that we did not want
the law to say this.
MR. MASTBAUM:

In light of the microscopic

34
scrutiny that Senator Muskie emphasized the Conference Bill
received, it can only be assumed that the fact that the
Conference Bill and the Conference

Report

contains no

statement which would indicate an intent to exclude radio­
active materials regulated under the Atomic Energy Act as a
very express and very strong rejection.
QUESTION:

Well, when you say it can only be

assumed, I think you concade
QUESTION:

some of what I am asking you.

Well, the Conference Bill did not

change the words "radioactive materials," did it?
MR. MASTBAUM:
QUESTION:

No, it did not.

And that is what the argument is here,

what those words mean.
MR. MASTBAUM:
QUESTION:

That is precisely right.

And the exceptions that were in the

House Report were not exceptions to radioactive materials.
MR. MASTBAUM:
QUESTION:

That is right.

However

-

So that the Conference action did not

purport to widen or limit whatever the word radioactive
materials might have meant.
MR. MASTBAUM:

That is precisely right.

However,

in light of the fact that the Conference specifically
considered the scope of the term and in light of Senator
Muskie'3 statement that the Conference had tried to write in­
to

law

as clearly as possible the intent of Congress —

35

QUESTION:

Well, what about the statements on the

House floor after the Conference Report?
Didn't Mr, Anderson make a statement as to what
the Conference did?
MR. MASTBAUM:
QUESTION;

That is correct.

However —

Didn't he say that the original under­

standing as to the meaning,

or, he said, the scope of

radioactive materials had not been changed?
MR. MASTBAUM;

Let me address that specifically.

First, by moving over to the Senate subsequent to —
QUESTION:

Well, let's

talk about the House.

Let's talk about Mr. Anderson for a minute.
MR. MASTBAUM:
order to explain

I think it is necessary for me, in

that, to move over to the Senate.

QUESTION:

Well, all right, go ahead.

MR. MASTBAUM:

In the Senate there were a number of

debates which indicated that it was the intent of — or it
v/as the understanding of the Senate members of the Conference
that all radioactive materials be included.
In fact, let me quote you from Senator Buckley,
who was engaged in a colloquy with Senator Muskie.
Senator Buckley declared himself deeply concerned
about Section 511 (c)(2)(b).

This clause may, I understand,

bar any federal permitting or licensing agency such as AEC
from imposing as a condition precedent to the issuance of

36

any license or permit any effluent limitation other than
those limitations established pursuant to the FWPCA.
Now, this would seem to indicate that Senator
Buckley's understanding in his colloquy with Senator Muskie
that any effluent limitation established by EPA for any
material would have to be accepted by the AEC.
Now, I agree with you that there is a conflict in
the House and Mr. Robert Zener, who is the General Counsel
of the EPA and on the

brief of the Petitioners in the case

at bar, in a more scholarly moment, noted that the House and
Senate conferees on the Water Act often made contradictory
statements when they returned to their respective chambers.
QUESTION:

Now, how about — when are you going

to get to what Mr. Anderson said?
MR. MASTBAUM:
QUESTION:

If I could just —

Well —

MR. MASTBAUM:

In the treatise on the Federal

Environmental Law. Mr. Zener analyzed such discrepancies in
connection with Section 13 and 14 of the Water Act as follows
"This is one of the many situations in the
legislative history of the 1972 Amendment where the Senate
and House managers made statements in the floor debates which
they apparently could not agree on at the conference.
"In these situations, the statements are dubious
as indication of Congressional intent."

37

I guess that is the answer to your question,.
Mr. Justice White, that the statements of the House are
dubious and lack —
QUESTION:

Unlike the ones on the Senate.

MR. MASTBAUM:

Well, if the ones in the Senate are

dubious, then I would rely on the Conference Report which
clearly indicates that there is no —

Yes, but the Conference Report did not

purport to change the meaning of radioactive materials, as
it came to them.

They didn't change the —

Did they?
QUESTION:

The Conference Report doesn't help you,

I don't think, insofar as establishing your position.
QUESTION:
question?

Mr. Mastbaum, may I ask you. this

If you prevail in this case, do you agree with

the Solicitor General that there will be duplicative
regulation by the NRC and the EPA that could be conflicting?
MR. MASTBAUM:

No, I do not.

What will occur

will be that the EPA will have the sole authority to set
effluent limitations.
The NRC and ERDA will have the authority to
license nuclear facilities and be responsible for the

38

operation of those facilities.
Their licenses will merely have to reflect the
EPA's standards established pursuant to the Water Act.

There

is no duplication.
As a matter of fact it will result in the unifor­
mity in that all aspects of water pollution from nuclear
facilities will be subject
QUESTION:

to the Water Act.

And the NRC authority that it has

exercised for 20 years will be taken away from it?
MR. MASTBAUM:
Act is very practical.
QUESTION:

No, that .is not true.

The Water

It requires that the EPA —

But that authority that had existed

would be limited, by your view of the new act.
MR. MASTBAUM:
QUESTION:

The NRC’s authority?

Yes, the NRC’s authority.

MR. MASTBAUM:

It would be limited but it must

be remembered that the EPA has broad radiation authority
and experience.

When it was established pursuant to

Reorganisation Plan 3 of 1970, the Federal Radiation Council
was transferred to the EPA from the AEC as well as the
Bureau of Radiological Health from the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare.
QUESTION:

Right.

But do you think it is

reasonable to infer from what, in effect, is silence by
Congress in the legislative history that it was taking

39

away from an agency that operated for 20 years some of its
jurisdiction?
I

MR, MASTBAUM:

Well, I do not concede that there

was silence in Congress.
QUESTION:

I know you rely on language in the

statute itself, but —*
MR. MASTBAUM:

Well, I also rely on language that

one can find in the legislative history.

For example, in the

debate that the Government refers to between Senator Pastore
and Senator Muskie.

Subsequent to the discussion, the

consequences of EPA regulation

under the Water Act there

was a discussion on the setting of specific effluent
limitations from nuclear facilities and this discussion
arose in the context of Northern.States Power versus
Minnesota and that case, as you know, preempted the states
from regulating radioactive materials that were subject to
the Atomic Energy Act.
QUESTION:

But didn't the Atomic Energy Act

possess exclusive control in the Commission over atomic
energy?

I think that -MR. MASTBAUM:

At the time it was adopted, it

was adopted 20 years earlier than the Water Pollution
Control Act.
QUESTION:

Right and you are saying the 1974 Act

subtracted a certain portion of the exclusive control,

40

largely by silence so far as specific discussion of it was
concerned in the Congressional legislative history.
MR. MASTBAUM:
QUESTION:

Well, I don’t concede silence.

Right.

You haven't pointed to anything

very specific so far.
MR. MASTBAUM:
QUESTION:

Well —

Except the language in the Act which I

concede gives you quite an arguable position.
MR. MASTBAUM:
be

Well, .if the exception -- it must

remembered that what the Government is seeking to

exclude from the Water Act is a very significant form of
pollution.
If Congress had intended to exclude those
materials when they made specific reference to them, not
only in the definition of pollutants but in the definition
of pollution, they would have said so, undoubtedly.
There is some support for the Government's position,
but that is primarily in the House.
QUESTION:

Mr. Mastbaum, is your plain language —

MR. MASTBAUM:

a certain amount of substance — if there

had not been the Atomic Energy Act at all.

But don’t you

think that when you have two Congressional statutes that —
and one of them -— and they seem to be clashing or they

seem to be inconsistent, isn’t there some ground for making
room for both of them?
I

MR. MASTBAUM:

The Federal Water Pollution

Control Act, I think, would take precedence.
QUESTION:

My cocounsel —

Well, why do you say that?

It was

passed later but let's assume there was no legislative
history whatsoever with respect to what the words radio­
active materials meant, as used in the Water Act.
less, you have

Neverthe­

another statute which purports to give the

Atomic Energy Commission some of the same jurisdiction.
MR. MASTBAUM:

The Water 7\ct specifically states

that any Agency's authority which is inconsistent with the
Water Act must yield to the Water Act, 1371, 33 U.S. Code.
My cocounsel has just reminded me that in the
Senate Report there is a specific reference to radioactive
materials subjected to the Atomic Energy Act.
That is in the discussion section 1316 of the
final version of Bill Section 306 and the Senate Bill,

The

Senate Committee specifically stated that EPA's Office of
Radiological Health should prepare itself to regulate
|

nuclear fuel's processing plants.
Well, the functions of the Office of Radiological
Health deal purely with radioactive materials subject to the
. Atomic Energy Act and the only discharges from nuclear fuels
processing plants are those subject to the Atomic Energy Act.

42-3
QUESTION:

Well, now, was the section of the

Senate bill that the Senate report was addressing to there,
was that carried over verbatim into the final bill?
MR. MASTBAUM:
close.

If it wasn't verbatim, it was very

It dealt with new sources of pollution that the EPA

should regulate and from the list of sources included in
Section 306, the section indicated that EPA did not have the
authority at this time to regulate nuclear fuel processing
plants but that it should develop the authority and its

Bureau of Radiological Health / prepare to regulate the
discharges of radioactive materials from these plants.
QUESTION:

But you critici.zed the reliance on the

House Committee Report because you say, the Conference
Committee didn't go this same way.
Now, if you are going to rely on the Senate
Committee Report it seems to me you have got to show that
that is somehow more faithful to the Conference Report or
that the Conference Report, in effect, adopts it.,
MR. MASTBAUM:

Section 306, the one that I had

been referring to, is the same as the comparable provision
of the Senate Bill and the House Amendment so therefore they
apparently did accept the Senate version.
QUESTION:

Mr. Mastbaum, do you say that the

Energy Commission has no jurisdiction over how much
pollutions are put in the water?

44

MR. MASTBAUM:

Well, I would say that what

would happen if this Court affirms the Tenth Circuit would
be that the Environmental Protection Agency would set
effluent limitations for radioactive materials and then the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission or ERBA would ensure that the
subject of their licensing authority would meet those
limitations.
QUESTION:

So that they would have no independent

authority at all any more.
MR. MASTBAUM:

They would have the authority to

regulate those facilities but they would not have any
authority —QUESTION:

They would have no authority over

regulating the pollution.
MR. MASTBAUM:

Yes, they could regulate the

pollution but they could not

establish the limits, that

is all.
QUESTION:

So now you have got Congress deliber­

ately setting up two competing commissions.
MR. MASTBAUM:
QUESTION:

I don't think —

Bo you think that Congress meant to

do that?
MR. MASTBAUM:

I don't think that we have two

competing agencies here.
On the one hand, we have the Environmental

Protection Agency —
QUESTION:

You either have two or one is superior.

MR. MASTBAUM:

Well, I think the missions and

functions of these ~~
QUESTION:
your position.

That is why I wanted to know wrhat is

Is the EPA superior?

MR. MASTBAUM:
QUESTION:

You

With respect to matters related to

environmental pollution, the EPA
QUESTION:

Would have the last word.

MR. MASTBAUM:
QUESTION:

—- is superior.

And that right has been taken away

from the Commission.
MR. MASTBAUM:

That is correct, with respect to

water pollution.
QUESTION:

Is there any evidence in the record,

in the testimony in support of the view that the Atomic
Energy Commission had failed adequately to protect the
public interest in the discharge of radioactive meterials
into the waters of our country?
MR. MASTBAUM:

Wo do net claim that there is any

problem with respect to that but the Water Act establishes
a new regulatory scheme with specific effluent limitations.
These limitations enforced by permit program give

more control over pollution.
Furthermore, they are technology-forcing.
there is a phased approach to pollution control.

That is

There are

several dates which have been set far in advance for
achieving more stringent pollution control and therfore, by
subjecting the nuclear facilities to this law, we have,
hopefully, the advancement of technology which will result
in cleaner water.
QUESTION:

Mr. Mastbaum?

MR. MAS TBAUM:
QUESTION:

Yes?

What do you understand by this state­

ment in the Government’s brief as to what it concedes EPA
would still be able to do even if the Government wins?
"Thus the lines of authority were clear]y drawn.
EPA was to set generally applicable radiation stardards
limiting the total amount of permissible radiatior in the
environment from major categories of sources."
Now, I assume, from what I heard the Government
say, that the EPA, under the Government’s view, would be
entitled to set limits on radiation releases into the water
from major categories of sources, namejLy, power plants, for
example.

Is that right?
MR. MASTBAUM:

I think the point that you make is

very important because the Government concedes that EPA
has the responsibility to set general or .ambient

environmental standards for radiation.
QUESTION:

TIov/ever

Well, when they say "From major

categories of sources," wouldn't power plants, wouldn't the
facilities managed by the AEG be a major category of sorts?
MR. MASTBAUM:

While that is

true, they are

dealing with the total number of plants.
The only way to effectively reach that point is
to provide for specific limitations.

The EPA may establish

general limits.
QUESTION:

So you are just making an effectiveness

argument but assume that the AEG — the AEG, after the
general standards were set by the EPA, honestly carried out
its task and limited the radiation to — and kept the
radiation released within the limits set by EPA.
Mow, would you be satisfied or not?
MR. MASTBAUM:

Well, I am not persuaded that they

would do that.
QUESTION:

So your argument is that they won't do

it, rather than if they did it — if they did do it, it
'would not be enough.
MR. MASTBAUM:

My argument is that the Water Act

clearly and unequivocally includes all radioactive materials.
The precise regulatory scheme established under that Act
will result in the EPA being able to achieve a fulfillment
of the general environmental standards which they are

48

required to set.
QUESTION:

Will the states come in. by the back

door if not the front if EPA is given the authority that you
contend because of the provisions of the Water bill?
MR. MASTBAUM:

The question of whether or not the

states would be preempted from regulating the radioactive
materials pursuant to the Water Act has never arisen at this
time.

If —
QUESTION:

I didn't mean by preemption but I meant

by participation in the EPA process.
MR. MASTBAUM:
one.

The rule for the states would be

If it is found that the states are preempted from

setting effluent limits, the EPA would set effluent limits
and then, as the states take over individual permit programs,
they would include the EPA and federal limits within the
state .
QUESTION: Well, that would be a result somewhat
?
contrary to the Irke case, wouldn't it, the Northern States
Power Company.
MR. MASTBZilUM:

No, it wouldn't.

In Northern States

Power, the issue was whether or not the states were pre­
empted under the Atomic Energy Act.
It is our position that under* the Water Act,
radioactive materials discharged into water are now being
regulated.

Therefore, the Atomic Energy Act has no bearing

49
on preemption under the Water Act.
QUESTION:

Well, admittedly not direct, but the

states would have a role in regulating that they would not
have if

your contention were rejected.
MR. MASTBAUM:

They would have a very limited role

pursuant to a federal regulatory scheme.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Mastbaum.

Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:35 o!'clock a.m. , the case
was submitted.]
