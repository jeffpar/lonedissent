ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT R, GRANUCCI
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. GRANUCCI:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justicer and may it please

This case is hare on a writ of certiorari to

review a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit, which in effect orders the setting aside of
respondent's California conviction of second degree murder.
The murder took place in San Bernardino in the
evening of February 17, 1958.

Respondent Lloyd Charles Powell

with three companions entered a liquor store owned by Gerald
and Mary Parsons.

While one of the group was making a small

purchase, respondent was observed in the act of shoplifting
a half-gallon of wins.

He struck Mr. Parsons in the mouth

A fight ensued.

During the struggle respondent

struck Mrs. Parsons just below the nock, punctured her lung
and resulted in her death the following morning.
The town of HendersonNevada, is located approximate’
130 airline miles northeast of San Bernardino and 8 miles
southeast of Las Vegas.

Shortly after 10 a.m. on the morning

4
after the shooting, Henderson Police Officer Edward Lattin,
while on routine patrol, observed two men walking across the
parking lot of a shopping center.

One of the two was

respondent.
QUESTION:

What time of day or night?

MR. GRANUCCI:

Approximately 10 a.m. in the morning,

your Honor.
As soon as the two 3aw the police car, they turned
about and started rapidly'in the direction they had been
coming from.

When Officer Lattin made a U-turn and started

to approach them, the two split up.

Officer Lattin honked

Respondent kept walking rapidly toward the rear of

the department store.

Finally Officer Lattin got out and

ordered respondent to stop.
Officer Lattin asked respondent for some identifica­
tion.

He replied chat his identification papers had been

stolen.

He did give the officer his name and data of birth.

The officer them radioed for a warrants check which cams back
negative.

Respondent cold the officer he had been staying

with friends in Las Vegas for the past few days, but he didn't
give their names and he didn't know their address.
that he was on his way to Michigan.

He stated

The officer also tended

to disbelieve this because the most direct rout© from Las
Vegas to points east does not pass through Henderson.
A local ordinance makes it a misdemeanor for a parson

5
to loiter without apparent reason or business and to refuse
to identify himself and to account for his presence when asked
by a police officer to do so

when the surrounding circumstance

would indicate to a reasonable man that the public safety
demands such identification.
Officer Lattin arrested respondent for violating
that ordinance.

A search incident to the arrest turned up

the murder weapon.
QUESTION:

On his parson?

MR. GRANUCCIs

On his person, your Honor.

At respondent's trial in Jane ISSS in a San Bernardino
County Superior Court, the revolver was admitted into evidence
after the trial judge had heard and denied respondent's
motion to suppress it as the product of an illegal search.
The jury subsequently found respondent guilty of second degree
murder.
Respondent appealed his conviction.

One of his

contentions was that his arrest and the incidental search
ware illegal because the Henderson vagrancy ordinance was
unconstitutional.

In October 1969 the California Court of

Appeals affirmed the conviction holding it V7as not necessary
I
to reach the merits of the search point because admission of
the revolver into evidence even if it ware error would not
have affected the verdict.
Respondent did not. seek a hearing in the California

6

Supreme Court.

However, he did subsequently apply to that

court for a writ of habeas corpus and his petition was denied.
In August 1971 State remedies having been eschausted,
respondent filed an amended petition for a writ of habeas
corpus in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California.
cause.

That court issued an order to show

After receiving briefs and examining the record of the

Stats trial, the district court denied th<3 writ in. February
1972. .Significantly, in its order denying the writ, the
district court declared the purpose of the exclusionary rule
would not be advanced by ex post facto condemnation of an
arrest which was apparently valid when made and the facts
developed at petitioner's trial show

that the arresting

officer had probable cause to believe that he had observed
the petitioner violate the ordinance.
On December 4. 1974, the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals reversed, ostensibly directing further proceedings in
conformity with this opinion, but actually ordering the; writ
granted and petitioner released — excuse ms, your Honors,
respondent released.

Its opinion, a triumph of logic over

justice, reasoned as followss
Under Papachristou. v. City of Jacksonville, the
Henderson vagrancy ordinance is unconstitutional.
respondent's arrest was illegal.

Therefore,

Therefore, the revolver

found in the incidental search was illegally obtained evidence.

7
Second, that the arresting officer acted reasonably
and in good faith is of no moment.

Application of the

exclusionary rule in this case is appropriate to preserve
judicial integrity and to deter legislative bodies from
enacting unconstitutional statutes.

Admission of the revolver

was not harmless error, therefore, respondent's California
murder conviction must be set aside.
Thus the question before this Court in this case -QUESTIONS

During this arrest was he charged with

possession of the weapon?
MR. GRANUCCI:
til© record below.

Your Honor, that does not appear ir.

I think
it is safe to assume that when
)

the officer found the revolver in the incidental search, ha
forgot ail about the vagrancy ordinance and continued to
process and book respondent for the moro serious charge of
carrying a concealed weapon.

But that is simply an assumption

I males.
The question be forts -this Court —
QUESTION:

Before you get into your argument, could

I ask another fact question?
MR. GRANUCCI:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

Th© respondent is now on parole, as I

understand it.
MR. GRANUCCI:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Can you tell us at what point in the

8
State proceedings h© began to serve his sentence?

Is it after

the conviction in the trial court or is it normally true in
California they wait until the appeal process is exhausted?
MR. GFANUCCX:

No, your Honor.

Although a defendant

in California is entitled to move for bail pending appeal,
the. granting of that motion is discretionary, and ordinarily
a defendant sentence for murder begins to serve his sentence
as soon as tho judgment is pronounced in the trial court.
QUESTION:

That’s what happened here.

MR. GRANUCCX:

Yes, your Honor.

The question for decision is whether a California
murderer is to go frea on Federal habeas corpus

because ha

was arrested under a Nevada ordinance which may have violated
a decision of this Court handed down two years after-the
conviction became final, four years after the arrest, and
more significantly, more than four years after ths ordinance
was adopted.
The question specified by this Court in its order
granting review, namely, whether in light of ths fact that
Officer Lattin had probable causa to arrest respondent for
violation of an ordinance which at that time had not been
authoritatively declared unconstitutional, respondent's claim
based on the search incident to that arrest

is on-

inquiry that is ever more fundamental, that is, whether 4th

amendment claims of State prisoners should be cognizable at

all in such proceedings.
Ws raised this very question in Schneckloth v.
Bustamonfce, and Justice Powell treated it in his concurring
opinion.
analysis.

Today we ask th@ Court to adopt Justice Powell's
Rather than simply restating the basic argument

presented in that case that the cost to society involved in
relitigating 4th amendment claims on Federal habeas corpus
outweigh any benefits to be gained thereby, we present an
additional consideration.
QUESTION:

You said relitigating?

MR. GRANUCCIs
QUESTION:

Relitigate, your Honor.

What about if it has never been

litigated?
MR. GRAMUCCIs

Then, your Honor, ths petitioner would

be faced t?ith two inquiries that were even more fundamental
and would ba dispositive — whether he had failed to exhaust
State remedies or whether he had bypassed procedure in the
State court.
QUESTION:

I just want to ask you, do you want the

hobsag corpus statute now construed to exclude from the power
of the Federal court 4th amendment claims that had never been
litigated in the State court?
MR. GRANUCCI:

Yes, your Honor, where there has been

a fair procedure available to litigate.

10

QUESTION:

Where he had the opportunity —

MR. GRANUCCI:
QUESTION:

Where he had the opportunity.

Suppose there was some new information

that came — assume hs was denied counsel illegally.
MR. GRANUCCI:

And couldn't litigate the claim for

that reason?
QUESTION:

Let's assume he is excused in seme manner

for not having raised the claim in the State court.
MR. GRANUCCI:
be available s.t all.
QUESTION:

Our position is such claims should not

A denial of counsel would work —
Then let's just don't talk about ralitiga-

tion„, just say litigation.
MR. GRANUCCI:
QUESTION:

Litigated.

I will accept that.

Be open for consideration

MR. GRANUCCI:

...

That should not be cognizable;, open

for consideration.
QUESTION:

But claims of denial of counsel would be

independent of its own force.
MR. GRANUCCI:

That's a personal dua process right

available1, to a defendant by its own fores.
QUESTION:

It would have no connection whatever with

the 4th amendment claim.
MR. GRANUCCI:
QUESTION:

No, your Honor.

You don't tali© the position it should not

be opan in the Federal court if there is no Stata procedure

11
for even raising the question in the State court, do you?
Isn't your whole case premised on the availability of a
State procedure where it could be raised?
MR. GRANUCCI:

Where the State provides an adequate

procedure for the vindication of these claims, they should not
be available on Federal habeas corpus.
Habeas corpus is a remedy for the vindication of
personal rights.

This is clear from

today's habeas corpus

Fay v. Noia, which says

provides a meda for the redress of

denials of due process of lav;.
QUESTION:

Suppose the.State has a good procedure

but the State Suprema Court makes an error.

Let's assume it

denies him cross-exrmination in a suppression hearing in a
manner that is plainly erroneous.

Now, the hearing is flawed.

Let's assume that it's flawed and everybody would concede
was flawed.

it

Yon would still say that the Federal habeas court

is closed to him or open?
MR. GRANUCCI:

That vroulu b© a due process error

that occurred during a State proceeding.

That claim of denial

of cross-examination cn a material issue in the State court —
QUESTION:

Then what do you do about it?

You

entertain it in the Federal court but you won't reach the
4th amendment claim.
MR. GRANUCCI:

I think the proper remedy, your Honor,

would be to send it back for another suppression hearing in the

12
Stata court where he would have his right to cross-examination.
QUESTION:

But you claim in that case, I suppose,

that the Federal habeas corpus court would be a denial of the
right of confrontation.
MR. GRANUCCI:
QUESTION:

Du© process.

Precisely.

Would you place any limits on that in

terms of time frame?
MR. GRANUCCI:
promptly raised.

I think that such claims ought to bs

There shouldn’t be a bypass of State remedies.

There should be exhaustion.
QUESTION:

In other words, some tiling in the nature

of a doctrine of latches should b© applied in the criminal area.
MR. GRANUCCI:

I think so, Mr. Chief Justice.

In Fay v. Noiaf this Court said vindication of duo
process is precisely the historic office of tho writ of habeas
corpusf but tho historic office of the exclusionary rule on
the other hand is entirely different.

This Court has

thoroughly discredited the notion that a defendant has a
personal right to the exclusion of evidence.

In United States v.

Cal an. dr a and United States v- Pod.tie.-'- the Court has stated
that the exclusionary rule is a judicially created remedy
designed to safeguard 4th amendment rights generally through
its deterrent effect rather than a personal constitutional
right of the party aggrieved.

The exclusionary rule furthers

a general societal interest rath.tr than a personal right.

13

QUESTION:

Those terms sound more like supervisory

power rather than constitutional, do they not?

If there is

no personal constitutional right, then the only other reach
of this Court or of the Federal courts would be under
supervisory power.

Or is there a third alternative?

MR. GRANUCCI:

I think that decisions of this Court

up to this point have tended to blur the notions of
constitutional rights and personal rights.
QUESTION:
were reciting.

I am just taking the language that you

Doss that language not comport more with

supervisory power than it does with defining an individual
personal right?
MR. GRANUCCI:

I thin}; so.

I think so.

Although

ths theory of Mapp v. Ohio, as I understand it, is this:

The

Constitution requires an exclusionary rule that can be asserted
at trial in order to discourage the police from making unlawful
searches.
QUESTION:

Certainly this Court has no authority

other than the Constitution for imposing the exclusionary rule
on the States.
MR. GRANUCCI:
QUESTION:

That is correct, your Honor.

So .we

not necessarily had to hold that

the exclusionary rule was constitutionally required,
MR. GRANUCCI:

Yes, but it doesn't necessarily — the

fact that it is constitutionally required doesn’t mean that it

14
must be applied at all stages.

It doesn't mean that it is

required on collateral attack.
I think this is clear from United States v. Calandra.
John Calandra*s rights were arguably violated by an illegal
search, but the violation of that constitutional right didn't
necessarily mean that h© had a personal right to assert the
exclusionary rule at all stages of th© proceedings.

In

determining whether Mr. Calandra was cmtitled to make a
suppression motion to challenge evidence which was being
considered by the grand jury and which was being ussd to
formulate questions asked of him, this Court balanced the effect,
the negative impact of allowing suppression there in tha form
of an undo interference with the functioning of the grand jury
against any positive effects that application of tha rule would
have in further deterring unlawful searches, keeping in mind
that the evidence would b© inadmissible at trial.
QUESTION:

The language that you were quoting earlier

came from Calandra, not Mapp v. Ohio.
MR. GPJiNUCCI:

That is correct, your Honor.

It came

from Calandra and it was quoted in Peltier.
Of course, the disadvantages of allowing State
prisoners to raise 4th amendment claims on Federal habeas corpus
had bean recounted before.

I simply touch on them.

This

practice taxes scarce judicial and prosecutorial resources.
causes frictions between Federal and State courts

It

whose decisions

15
are secona-guessed.

It undermines public confidence in the

administration of justice by the litigation of matters years
after the fact that bo ax no relationship to the guilt or
innocence of the defendant.

And it is totally inconsistent with

any idea of rehabilitating criminal offenders.

In the words

of Professor Paul Bator, the idea of just condemnation lies
at the heart of the. criminal law, and we should not lightly
create processes which, implicitly belie its possibility.
At this point it may be suggested that we have proved
too much, that the disadvantages of collateral attack are so
great that no constitutional right should b© available once a
conviction has become final as a basis for habeas corpus.
However, vjhc re personal rights are involved, balancing is
inappropriate, but whc.ro a societal right is involved and where
a defendant has no personal right to the. exclusion of evidence,
then he should be permitted to invoke the rule only where it
will actually serve to deter unlawful searches and seizures.
QUESTION:

You aren't suggesting, are you, Mr. Granucci,

that the 4th amendment rights themselves are some sort of
second-class nonpersonal rights?
MR. GRANUCCI:

No, I think history would argue

exactly the contrary.
QUESTION:

By their very terms, it says the 4th

amendment confers a right upon each of us to be secure in his
person, his houses, and his effects from unreasonable searches

16
and seizures.
MR. GRANUCCI:
QUESTION:

That's right.

There is nothing more personal than that.

MR. GRANUCCI:

That's right.

But, your Honor, Mr.

Calandra's rights were violated by that search, but that
didn't necessarily mean he had the right to make a suppression
motion.

Tho exclusionary rule is simply a judicially created

doctrine, to further the protection against unreasonable searches
and seizures.
QUESTION:

Then you’d do the same tiling in tho 5th

amendment area, compel self-incrimination if the compulsion
has baen exerted by the trial.
MR. GRANUCCI:

If it has bean exerted prior to trial,

the right is not completely violated until either the confession
or its fruits ere admitted in the trial.

Remember;- the 5th

amendment is about testimony —
QUESTION:

Soma people think that they are further

damaged in their 4th amendment interests by the disclosure at
the trial of private matters seized from their house.

Similarly,

a lot of people think their 4th amendment rights ar© violated
if conversations which have been overheard are repeated at
trial.
' MR. GRANUCCIs

Yes.

But the defendant has no personal

right to the suppression of evidence.

It’s not what tho

defendant feels; it's the remedy that the court maizes available.

17
QUESTION:

So you would, then, apply tha same rule

to compel self-incrimination issues where the compulsion has
been exerted by the trial to secure a statement?
MR. GRANUCCI:

Yes, that right is not violated, though,

until the evidence is admitted at trial because tha 5th
amendment is uniquely a trial right.
QUESTION:

You are making a distinction now between

a systemic rule that is for the benefit of the system as
distinguished from a doctrine or rule that is for the benefit
of the particular individual.
MR. GRANUCCI:
QUESTION:

That is correct, your Honor.

That's what you meant by using the term

"societal."
MR. GRANUCCI:

Societal and systemic, I think, mean

the same thing.
QUESTION:

Counsel, I wonder if you're right.

You

are suggesting that if the police extort a confession from
an individual brutally and do not admit it in the trial as
evidence, that individual would have no 19S3 remedy against
the police.
MR. GRANUCCI:
QUESTION:

No.

Then his right has been violated before

the confession is introduced in trial.

I don't understand

your distinction.
QUESTION:

Does that not go to the reliability and

18

trustworthiness of the confession as distinguished from no
challenge to the reliability and trustworthiness of the pistol
found in the pocket of this man?
MR. GRANUCCI:

That's one distinction that has been

drawn between statements and physical evidence, but I think
the question of Mrv Justice Stevens was somewhat deeper.
There is no— ths question assumes, and I would agree
that the defendant who was injured by officers acting under
color of State law would have a right.

He would also have a

right if h® were simply the victim of a search for a damage
action, assuming the* the defenses of good faith and other
related defensas were not present.

But h© has no personal

right to the exclusion of that evidence.
QUESTION?

He would Lave a pretty tough job maintaining

a civil suit from a. jail cell, wouldn't he?
MR. GRANUCCI;
QUESTION;

I don't know, your Honor.

How can he carry his 1933 suit from the

jail cell?
MR. GRANUCCI:
QUESTION:

Probably by retaining counsel.

Well, he can maintain it when and if he

is free.
MR. GRANUCCI:
QUESTION:

Yes, of course.

That is assuming ths statute of limitations

has not run.
MR. GRANUCCI:

Yes.

19
Now, it well may be that the Court is unwilling
totally to eliminate the cognizance of 4th amendment claims
on Federal habeas corpus.

If so, the facts of this case

suggest a principle by which habeas corpus jurisdiction could
be limited to those instances where availability might actually
serve the purposes of the exclusionary rule.
the following limiting principle:

We suggest

A search made in reasonable

and good faith reliance upon a coordinate branch cf government
should not be cognisable on Federal habeas corpus.
Up to now we have argued that the exclusionary rule
should not b& applied on collateral attack because the costs
in applying it far outweigh any minimal effect it might have —
QUESTION*

i? it is in fact intentional

knowing violation, it would b® excluded?

and

Is that the line

you are drawing?
MR. GRANUCCI:

I am drawing the line on Federal

If the Court ---

QUESTION:

All right.

May there bo Federal habeas

review of a knowing violation of the 4th amendment to have

MR. GRANUCCI:
position, your Honor.

This is essentially a fallback
In other words, if the Court is not

prepared totally to overrule Kaufman and the related cases,
then it can limit review to those cases in which the deterrent
purpose of the rule is actually served.

20

QUESTION:

That is where there is an allegation, that

the illegal search was knowing and intentional.
MR. GRANUCCI:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Is this something along the lines of the

English rule that only flagrant violations would b® the subject
of an exclusion?
MR. GRANUCCI:

I think so, your Honor, although I am

not sufficiently prepared on that point to speak with any
great degree of confidence.
You see, when an officer has mad® an arrest or a
search in reasonable and good faith reliance on the action of
a coordinate branch of government, in this case the Town
Council which adopted the vagrancy ordinance, and, for example,
in the previous case the magistrate who issued the search
warrant, his action is commendable.
at all.

It shouldn't be deterred

In terms of influencing police conduct, application

of the exclusionary rule in the setting whore the officer has
reasonably relied cn a coordinate branch of government, is
actually contraproductive because tc the effect that it
influences police conduct at all, it invites officers tc
speculate about the constitutionality of the statutes and laws
they are sworn to enforce or search warrants they era directed
to execute.
The Ninth Circuit based its decision on judicial
integrity.

We note only that judicial integrity was a rational©

21
articulated by this court in tha exercise of its supervisory
authority over tha lower Federal courts, and it has been
assimilated info the deterrent rationale.
United States v. Peltier.

This is clear from

It's inappropriate to apply the

exclusionary rule for th© stated purpose of deterring legislature?
from enacting invalid statutes because the very word "deter"
assumes that legislatures act in bad faith.

This is contrary

to tha basic principles of democratic government.
QUESTION:

Your argument really, while it's directed

to tha point that was isolated in your colloquy with my brother
Brennan, really the argument you are mailing now is equally to
the effect there was no 4th amendment violation in this ce.se,
is it not?
MS. GRAUUCCt:
characterization.

Yes, that raises a question of

If you say the 4th amendment only is aimed

at prohibiting unreasonable searches, I think wa can leave room
for a reasonable mistake of law, reasonable good'faith mistakes
of law, just as

in Hill v. California --

QUESTION:

I think your point was that an. arrest ms.de

under a statute or in this case an ordinance that vras validly
passed by a City Council in a municipality in the State of
Nevada which had never been held to be invalid and that a search
incident to that arrest was a perfectly valid search and no
violation of the 4th or 14th amendment whatsoever.

And if

that’s true, -then none of these other questions arise.

22
MR. GRANUCCI:

That's right.

That's right.

We

think it's quite properly correct to characterize this as a
totally reasonable search.

On the other hand, if it is a

violation of the 4th amendment to make an arrest or a search
which is unauthorized by an ex post facto application of an
invalidating decision, then it is only a technical violation
and applying the exclusionary rule on habeas corpus is
meaningless.
You see, in this case, what the Ninth Circuit did
was free a California murderer simply to censure the Town
Council of Henderson, Nevada, for its alleged legislative
mis judgment.

This is a gross ambuss of federalism, an intolerable

miscarriage of justice, ana it can't be allowed to stand.

And

I would like fco reserve what remains of my time.
QUESTION:

Doss it also have any effect of deterring

police officers in this town in Nevada from enforcing a
dubious ordinance?
MR. GRANUCCI:

Well, we are advised that in the town

of Henderson, Nevada, they are no longer making arrests under
the vagrancy ordinance.

But, again, why punish California?

Why set aside this conviction?

It doesn't serve the purposes

of the exclusionary rule.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Peterson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT W. PETERSON
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. PETERSON:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

Mr. Powell was was walking in an open shopping

center in Henderson, Nevada on February 18, 1968, when he
was approached by a Henderson, Nevada, police officer, asked
a few questions, and then arrested under th® Henderson, Nevada
ordinance.

That arrest was unreasonable.

It was unreasonable

in the 4th amendment constitutional sense for a number of
reasons:

It was unreasonable because the police officer did

not have probable cause, to believe that he had violated the
ordinance, and. it was also unreasonable because the ordinance
QUESTION:

The ordinance is here somewhere, isn't

it?
MR. PETERSON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Where, in the petitioner's brief?

MR. PETERSON:

I think it's in all the briefs in

a number of different places.
QUESTION:

You say that tha police officer should

reasonably have known that this was an unconstitutional
ordinance?
MR. PETERSON;

I think so. 'I don't"conccsdo for a

moment —
QUESTION:

I thought

tho argument you were just

making assumed that the ordinance was constitutional, ■>
nevertheless there was no probable cause.

24

MR. PETERSON:
QUESTION:

I think that's exactly true.

But that isn't the ground on which the

judgment we are reviewing rests.
MR. PETERSON:

It's not on that ground simply

because the Ninth Circuit did not reach that ground.
QUESTION:

Would we independently reach a proximal

matter like that if it hasn't been passed on by the lower
courts ?
MR. PETERSON:

I suppose it might be appropriate

if you were to decide that it is constitutional to arrest
someone under an ordinance that authorizes unreasonable
searches and seizures that this case would have to be sent
back to
QUESTION:

That may be, but that doesn't get rid

of the: issue we have here.
MP. PETERSON:

No, it doesn't get rid of the issue

that we have here, and that's'why I am going to go on to the
ordinance.
QUESTION: This seems to be the only grounds that
the Ninth Circuit rested on?
MR. PETERSON:

I don't think so.

I think, for

example, -that you might well decide to dispose of this case
on the probable cause, grounds in order to avoid deciding
the constitutional issue, because the probable cans© ground
tends to narrow it down.

25
QUESTION:

Well, that's no constitutional issue.

MR. PETERSON:

I mean the constitutionality of the

State law.
QUESTION:

(Inaudible)

in this case and the

Terry case.
MR. PETERSON:
QUESTION:

This case is worse than the Terry case.

This case, I understand the facts as

given that when the police approached him he ran?
MR. PETERSON:
QUESTION:

In the Terry case.

No, in this case.

MR. PETERSON:

No, he did not run.

Whan the police

approached him, he was walking, walking according to the officer,
at a quick pace.
'QUESTION:

I thought Mr. Granucci said he was —

QUESTION:

Your colleague said he was hurrying on

or some tiling.
MR. PETERSON:

Walking quickly, that's the v/ay the

police officer characterized it.
QUESTION:

I stand corrected.

He was going this

way and then he turns around when he sees the police officer
and he walks quickly the other way.
MR. PETERSON:

Yes, quickly, in a shopping center

towards one cf the department stores.
QUESTION:

Towards one of the department stores.

MR. PETERSON:

That’s right.

26

QUESTION:
Terry?

And isn't that

what happened in

In Terry he was forced to stop three times, but this

was once.
MR. PETERSON:

I believe in either Terry or Sibron,

I have forgotten which one, where the person walked back and
forth in front of the store some 25 times.
QUESTION:

That was Terry.

MR. PETERSON:

Yes, some 25 times back and forth

looking like he was casing the store, a number of times.
QUESTION:
away.

Yes, but h@*s in a vacant lot and he walks

Didn't the police have a right to stop him?
MR. PETERSON:

I don't think the police officer in

this case did have the right, but for the purpose of argument,
I will concede that the way he was walking would authorize the
police officer to make a limited Terry stop.
QUESTION:

Arid would he have a right to frisk him?

MR. PETERSON:

No, he would not have a right to frisk

him, because Terry requires, before you can frisk him, that
you have some founded suspicion that he was armed, and this
police officer did not have any founded suspicion,
none whatsoever.

lie had

Indeed, the Attorney General has never argued

that there was ground for frisk.
QUESTION:

There was a gun on him.

MR. PETERSON:
reason

He did have a gun, but there was no

for the officer to believe that.

27
QUESTION:

What was the founded suspicion in Terry,

Mr. Peterson?
MR. PETERSON:

The appearance of casing a place

for a possible robbery.
QUESTION:

What does that have to do with the

likelihood or nonlikelihood of his having a pistol in his
pocket?
MR. PETERSON:

Well, that's the way robberies are

usually committed.
QUESTION:

Usually?

QUESTION:

But that’s not the ground in Terry.

The

ground in Terry permitting the frisk was the self-protaction
of the officer while he detained him for a question.
MR. PETERSON:
might have had a gun.

When he thought that the individual
I don't think that you can frisk every

person that you can stop under Terry.
has never held that.

I am sure this Court

I think that would be wrong.

But in this case —
QUESTION:

Terry didn't say that.

Terry said when

he stopped him, he had a right to frisk him, once he stopped
him.
MR. PETERSON:

Every ceise that has a right to a

stop nas a right to a frisk?
QUESTION:

Ho, he said in that case whan he stopped

him, he had a right to frisk him for his own protection, that'

28

what Terry said.
MR. PETERSON:

I think because in that case the

reasonable suspicion that the officer had was that this person
was about to commit a robbery or something which normally
includes a gun or some kind of weapon.
QUESTION:

Nov/ that's a pretty good generalization.

It's probably an squally good generalization that some of these
gentlemen engaged in that activity very carefully avoid carrying
a gun in order to avoid a higher degree of crime.

I suggest

that this second generalization, hypothetical, is just as
valid as yours, either one of them very valid.
MR. PETERSON:

Either one very valid.

Wall, I think

in this case the Ninth Circuit was correct when they pointed
out in the case that the Attorney General makes no suggestion
that there was a right to a Terry typo frisk because there was
no suspicion at all that this person was armed, from whatever
source that suspicion might come from.

It just wasn't there.

They just saw someone walking in a shopping center and thought
that that was a suspicious person.
In any event, the ordinance in this case under which
he was arrested itself authorizes unreasonable searches and
seizures, because the ordinance allows a full custodial arrest
for v/hat under Terry at the most would be a brief detention
and if there was reason to believe there was a gun, a frisk.
In this case not only can he be arrested, but he can also be

29

prosecuted, simply for being a suspicious person.
It also was an unreasonable arrest under the
ordinance because the ordinance was not clear enough to advise
either the police officer or someone who is trying to hue
his conduct to the standards of the ordinance of what

the

prescribed conduct is.
There are other violations of this ordinance.

The

ordinance is also unconstitutional because it violates the
5th amendment.

The ordinance makes the crime in this case for

someone to refuse, a suspect, a criminal suspect, to refuse
to give a narrative account to an investigating police officer
of his conduct.

I think that is a gross violation of the 5th

amendment.
The Attorney General in this case argues that the
police officer acted in good faith when ha arrested under this
ordinance, and I would suggest that if good faith were, the
standard at the time that this arrest were made, there could
not have bean made in good faith, because if either Officer
Lafctin or the Henderson, Nevada, City Council had bothered to
take a look at the law as it existed at that time, they would
have found, cases beginning with Boyd in 1306, and certainly
would have found the Miranda case, which requires a police
officer to advisa someone that he has a right to remain silent,
and they would have found Davis v. Mississippi, a case in
which this Court said that while a police officer may ask

30

questions about unsolved crimes, he has no right to compel
answers.

Those cases were both on the books at the time that

this arrest was made.

And I fail to see how a police officer

who on a daily basis advises people of their Miranda rights
could possibly believe in the constitutionality of an ordinance
that made it a crime to refuse to answer the police officer's
questions.
The vagueness doctrine was hardly a novel one in
1968.

Many of the cases of this Coiurt at that time were

venerable.* There is the Lanzetta case, the Cox case.
QUESTION:

What if you stop short of that, Mr-.

Peterson, and say that the refusal to answer the questions
may be considered by a court and

by

the policeman in the

first instance in whether or not ha should make a search?
MS. PETERSON:

In whether or not he should make a

search?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. PETERSON:

I think that that would be attaching

a penalty to the exercise of the 5th amendment right.
QUESTION:

Couldn't Terry attach some disabilities

to Mr. Terry?
MR. PETERSON:
answer questions.

I don't think for his refusal to

I think that Mr. Justice White's concurrence

in that case made it clear that the officer had no right to
compel answers and may not consider the refusal to answer as

31

part of the basis for the probable cause.

That attaches and

undue penalty on the exercise of your constitutional right not
to incriminate yourself.
QUESTION:

But walking up and down even 20 times is

prsumably prima facie as.much of a constitutional right as
refusing to answer tho question, as you pose it.
MR. PETERSON:

Perhaps walking up and dov/n within an

apparent attempt to — well, with an apparent plan to rob a
place is not a constitutional right.
QUESTION:

But Terrv didn't concede in any sense that

his conduct gave the appearance of possible commission of a
crime.
MR. PETERSON:
QUESTION:
Terry.

Oh, I think Terry did.

I am speaking of tha defendant himself, Mr.

The opinion, however, the court drew some inferences

and said that this was enough to warrant a cautious and prudent
policeman to take some steps, including a complete search of
the man.
MR. PETERSON:

Because his conduct was consistent,

I think this is the proper reading of Terry, consistent with
the possibility that he was armed.

I don't think that every

police officer who has a right to stop soxneone has a right to
frisk them.

I don't think every police officer who pulls someone

over for a traffic violation has the right to frisk them unless
there is soma founded belief that the person might also have a

32
weapon.
QUESTION:

I think some of our cases would have

something to say about that, long after Terry.
MR. PETERSON:

That the police officer has a right

to require the suspect to answer his questions?
QUESTION:

To search after a stop.

MR. PETERSON:

If there is going to be a full

custodial arrest, I think that's right.

If you are going to

take the person down to the jail, then you do have a right.
And I suppose that is the basis for the search in this case.
He was being arrested for vagrancy, and since he was now going
to be taken to jail, then he could be searched.

But that arrest

was unconstitutional for the reasons that I am outlining, and
so that search has to fall.
QUESTION:

You say the policeman has the right to

ask the question.
MR. PETERSON:

I think so.

I think the police officer

has the right to ask the question, but he has -QUESTION:

The man answered.

MR. PETERSON:

— I don't think he has the right to

demand answers at all.
QUESTION:

But here the man did answer.

MR. PETERSON:

He was arrested because in the officer's

view he had refused to answer.
QUESTION:

That

was the crime.

I thought he answered and said he was on

33

his way from Vagas to Michigan.
MR. PETERSON:
QUESTION:

Isn't that correct?

Yes, he was on his way to Michigan.

And did the officer say that he was staying

with some people in Vagas?
MR. PETERSON:
QUESTION:

And then ha wouldn't —

MR. PETERSON:
that's right.

That's right.

He couldn't remember their names,

As one of tine witnesses could not remember where

he was staying when he testified at his trial.
QUESTION:

So h© did answer the question.

MR. PETERSON:

Yes.

I think the Attorney General was

in a dilemma because the critical element of the offense is
"refuse to identify yourself and account for your presence.”
Nov;, either he was not asked to account —- I don't think he
was; he was never asked why he was walking the way he was in
the shopping center, in which caso there was no probable cause
for the arrest, or he refused to answer, in which case h© was
arrested for exercising a constitutional right that he has,
or he did not refuse, ha accounted, in which case there is no
probable cause to arrest.
QUESTION:

QUESTION:

But he didn't have anv written

He

34

identification.
MR. PETERSON:

No written identification, but the

Henderson, Nevada, ordinance does not require that.
QUESTION:

Mr. Peterson, what if a policeman makes

a Terry type stop and asks the man he stops, "Do you have any
weapons on you?"

And the man says, "I refuse to answer."

Is it your position that the officer cannot take that refusal
into account in determining whether or not (a) to frisk him
or (b) to arrest him?
MR. PETERSON:

I would take that position that he

has no right to require that answer.

That would attach a

penalty to it, and the penalty would be search.
QUESTION:

But it's not necessarily the same to say

that you can't require an answer in the sense of beating it out
of a person and to say that you can attach some significance
to silence if a normal person, would consider it relevant.
You can say they both should go both ways, but they are not
exactly the same inquiry.
MR. PETERSON:

Not exactly, but I think that this

Court has consistently held that you cannot attach a penalty
to silence.

In Griffin v. California you could not comment on

the fact that the defendant did not take the stand.
QUESTION:

That was testimonial silence.

MR. PETERSON:

That's right, but in Davis v. Mlssissipi

it was not, and in Mr. Justice White's concurrence in Terry v,

35
Ohio it was not.

I will say that that is an undue price to

exact for the exercise of the constitutional right.

In this case, in any event —
QUESTION:

MR. PETERSON:
silent.

A privilege, a privilege to remain

Yes.
If, again, the police officer had consulted the lav

in 1968 on the issue of good faith, or the Henderson, Nevada,
City Council had don© that, they also would have found that, the
Ninth Circuit in 1931 had held unconstitutional ci local
ordinance that made it unlawful to loaf, loiter, or idle, and
that ordinance was held unconstitutional on the grounds that
it would undoubtedly be enforced discriminatorily and it
penalized the constitutional right to wander around, something
you have a right to do in the United States.
If they had looked further, they would have found
Federal cases that had struck down good account and satisfactory
account statutes.

Eak-sr v. Birder ar.d United States v. Marge son

had struck those down in 1966 and 1967.

The Supremo Judicial

Court of Massachusetts had struck down a similar statute, and
ths Supreme Court of Washington in 1967 held unconstitutional
an ordinance that read as follows:

"It shall be unlawful for

36
any person wandering or loitering abroad or abroad under other
suspicious circumstances from one-half hour after sunset to
one-half hour before sunrise to fail to give a satisfactory
account of himself upon the demand of any police officer."
That was on the books at that time.

That, I suggest, is a

more narrowly drawn ordinance than the one that's involved
in this particular case.
QUESTION:

It's your basic position, I gather, on

this aspect of the case that it's not only the- right, I would
say privilege, of a police officer, but also his duty simply
to take it upon himself not to enforce ordinances duly enacted
by the governmental unit by which he is employed if he has a
bona fide belief that they are not constitutional laws.
MR. PETERSON:
General's position.

I think that's the Attorney

The. Attorney General's position, and

they ssfc it forth on page 4 of thoir brie.::, is that the officer *«
belief in the validity of thn ordinance must be in good faith.
QUESTION:

So that's not your position?

MR. PETERSON:

That's not ray position.

My position is

that if this ordinance authorises unreasonable search and
seizure, then the evidence must ba suppressed.
QUESTION:

No, no.

But the reason, on this aspect

of the case, you say it’s an unreasonable search and seizure
»
is that th© arrest was made under the authority of an. ordinance
that was unconstitutional.

37

MR. PETERSON:
QUESTION:

That's right.

And it would follow from that, I suppose,

that it's the duty of a police officer to take it upon himself
not to enforce ordinances that he in the exercise of reasonable
care should know are unconstitutional.
MR. PETERSON:

I don't think that that is his duty.

I think that he should enforce the ordinance if it's on the
books and then it will be declared unconstitutional in a
suppression haaring or in a prosecution.

And after that, ha

will no longer enforce the ordinance.
I don't take the position that the Attorney General
does that the police officer should exercise his own judgment
as to the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the laws.
I think that is an unworkable rule.
QUESTION:

Is this ordinance unconstitutional as of

right now?
MR. PETERSON:

As of right, now?

This ordinance has

not been declared unconstitutional except bv the Ninth Circuit.
QUESTION:

So what does the policeman dc now?

Does

h© enforce it or not?
MR. PETERSON:

Right now he would enforce it, unless

he was told, by his superiors not to.
QUESTION:

What's the difference between that and

tills particular case?
MR. PETERSON:

I ara net sure I follow that.

38

QUESTION;

Well, you say the ordinance is still on

the books, has still not been declared unconstitutional, it's
still valid.

Then it was valid when the policeman arrest€.d

this man.
MR. PETERSON;

No, I think the police didn't know

that it was invalid, and until this Court rules, they don't
know for sure in the sens© that we have a case right squarely
on til® point that it's invalid.
QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals in this case hold

that it was invalid.
MR. PETERSON:

That's right.

But this Court has

taken that case, and so it's in somewhat a state of limbo.
QUESTION:

So all the police officers are in limbo,

in that sensa over the ordinance.

We might have been taking it,

for all anyone knows, to simply determine strictly whether in
the eyes of the policeman, to take Chief Justice Warren's
language out of the Tarry case, he observed unusual conduct
which led him reasonably to conclude in the light of his
experience that something was afoot.
MR. PETERSON:

You might have taken it for that

reason, but one- cf the questions which you granted certiorari
on was the question of the constitutionality of the ordinance.

QUESTION:

That's the way I read Terry.

Isn't it clear under Terry that after

tip the scales on the part of the officer not to pursue the
matter any further,, or to continue the interrogation which
might as wall lead to his release or his moving as to his
being taken into custody?

QUESTION:

Well, I hear what you are saying.

QUESTION:

Mr. Paterson, do you think the respondent

in this case does have a cause of action under 1283 for
unlawful arrest?
MR. PETERSON:

I think h$ has a cause of action

41
against the officer for arresting him without probable cause.
He has no remedy against the: Henderson, Nevada, City Council
for adopting an ordinance which in effect commands the police
to make unreasonable arrests, and commands them to violate
the 5th amendment rights of people who are walking around in
Henderson.
QUESTION:

You do think a person who is the victim

of an unlawful arrest, the arrest being unlawful by virtue
of an ordinance subsequently being held unconstitutional, does
have a cause of action under 19S3?
MR. PETERSON:

No, not if tia© only reason that the

arrest is unconstitutional is the unconstitutionality of the
ordinance.

Then he does not have a cause of action under

1S33 against the officer.
QUESTION:

If the ordinance had not been held

unconstitutional at the time of the arrest, then there is no
cause of action under 1S83.
MR. PETERSON:

That's right.

There is no cause of

action either against the police officer under Pierson v. Ray,
I think that's ths case, or against the legislature because
the legislature enjoys legislative immunity.
But there1s a more fundamental problem in this
arid that is th® 4th amendment says that the people shall be
secure from unreasonable searches and seizures.

The Attorney

General would have the Court adopt the view that that focuses

42
solely on the police and that a legislative body may command
unreasonable searches and seizures, and so long as the
police officer is relying on that legislative command, there
is no violation of the 4th amendment.

But the 4th amendment

doesn't say that people shall be secure only from searches
and seizures conceived by the police.
QUESTION:

I think this —

It certainly doesn’t protect against

searches and seizures by private people, does it?

QUESTION:

But if

it?
MR. PETERSON:

Well, that’s the way it has to ha,

becau.ss the legislature doesn't gc out and make the searches

QUESTION:

Exactly.

MR. PETERSON:

If T command someone to commit a

complete good faith, and indead there is unanimity among the
lower courts as to tha constitutionality of what they were

Nevertheless, the evidence in those cases was suppressed,
and this Court —

On the issue of retroactivity.

MR. PETERSON:

To cases other than tha first case

that is brought to this Court.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. PETERSON:

This is the first case with respect

to this ordinance where there has boon an arrest under it
that has bear brought tc this Court.

Whether or not to apply

this case retroactively in other decisions, I think has to
wait until these casos come along.
QUESTION:

But in Peltier one of the grounds that

was relied on was the fact that tha border officers had relied
on an act of Congress, and hare you've got certainly soma
sort of an analogy that if the local policeman relies on an
ordinance of his locality, maybe it isn't entitled to the same

44
weight, but it is certainly a factor, isn't it?
MR. PETERSON:

It's a factor in the next case, the

next case that comes along where someone else is arrested under
the same ordinance or an ordinance which is drafted in
substantially the same terms, and this Court has said now you
cannot make arrests under this ordinance.
QUESTION:

The test is whether the seizure was

The Constitution says no

Are you saying that the fact that ho in

good faith relied on an ordinance he thought to be valid and
hadn't been held to be otherwise simply is entitled to no weight
in tha determination of reasonableness?
MR. PETERSON:

I think that since ths Constitution

says that you shall be secure from unreasonable securches and
seizures, that you cannot look just at the agent who has been
commanded to make the unreasonable search and seizure by the
legislature.
QUESTION:

My question isn't whether you lock just at

that, but I am asking whether you say is it to be entirely
out of consideration the feict that there was in effect an
ordinance that had not been hold invalid in determining something
like reasonableness.
Mil. PETERSON:

I think tha only consideration the

Court should give to the existence of that ordinance is the
normal kind of presumption that ths Court gives to the

45

constitutionality of a lav/ until it is declared unconstitutional.
If that is an unconstitutional ordinance, then I think in this
case the evidence is going to have to be suppressed.
QUESTION:

Mr. Peterson, assume these facts for a

moment, that a man is arrested like this man was, but at the
time of his arrest the Supreme Court of the State of Nevada
had ruled that that ordinance was constitutional.

Are you with

ms?
MR. PETERSON;
QUESTION:

I am with you.

So they arrest him, and they find this

incriminating evidence, and subsequently this Court, said that
the Nevada court was wrong.
MR. PETERSON:

Would that invalidate that arrest?

Did it say that the Nevada, court was

wrong in the same case that the Nevada court has said

that it

was right?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. PETERSON:

Than it would invalidate the arrest.

If it were a different case, it would not.
QUESTION:

So that the only way it could be reasonable

would be it would have to be a decision of this Court.

Right?

Or a higher court.
MR. PETERSON;

I think the only way in the first case

to get to this Court —
QUESTION:

That's the only way it could be reasonable,

would have to ba this Court or a higher one.

QUESTION:

In the interim, what happens —

QUESTION:

You can't get declaratory judgments, you

I don't know how you are going to do it.
MR. PETERSON:

He can't get a declaratory judgment

in a case like this because hs doesn't have standing under
Ellis v. Dyson.
QUESTION:

How else can you make it reasonable?

MR. PETERSON:

Well, I think you have to eventually,

a case is probably going to haves to end up in this Court if
there is serious doubt about the reasonableness of it, as this
case has.
QUESTION:

So you tell the prisoner -— you tell the

guy who is running down the parking lot, you say, "Now you wait
here until I get a definitive decision on this as to whether I

47
can lock you up or not.
MR. PETERSON:
QUESTION:

No, you can't do it that way.

How would you do it?

MR. PETERSON:

I think that this Court has struck

that balance in its retroactivity decisions. In the BrignoniPoncfe and Almeida-Sanchez cases, many people had been arrested
and searched pursuant to the Federal statutes in those cases,
and this Court in Peltier decided not to reverse those, but
this Court did in the case that came here reverse that decision.
And I think that is the* way the balance has bean struck.

It

won't be applied retroactively most likely, but it has to be
applied in this case since this is the first case, to get here.
QUESTION:

Eut to pursue Mr. Justice Marshall's

hypothetical inquiry, in the interim, after the ordinance is
on th.s books and before the highest court of the State has
passed on it, isn't there an old-fashioned idea of the presumptio
of the constitutionality and validity of that statute?
MR. PETERSON:
QUESTION:

That's right.

So that it is just as valid before the

Supreme Court cf Nevada, passea on it as it is afterward for
these purposes, is it not?
MR. PETERSON:
invalid.

Until it gets here and it’s declared

And ones it gets here, it is like Almeida-Sanchez

and Brignoni-Ponce.
QUESTION:

Obviousiy, this officer passed on it in that

43
interim period,didn't he?
MR. PETERSON:

Yes, he did.

I suggest that at that

time the ordinance was also invalid because — or ha had no
reasonable grounds to believe that it was valid because there
was a welter of cases on the books even then.
QUESTION:

Then your response I thought you gave to

Mr. Justice Stewart a little while ago that you were not taking
the position that this ordinance or this officer had any duty
or any power to pass on the constitutionality.
MR. PETERSON:

Well, to use a phrase that has bean

used before, that is a fallback position.
that his good faith should be the test.
that is the test.

that were oa the books at that time.
How can yea say there wouldn't have boon

I assume you must have been assuming

that there was good faith as the defense in a 1933 action.
MR. PETERSON:

Well, that, of course, has not been

completely resolved by this Court in Pierson v. Ray.

I would

think that for the purposes of damages against a polio© officer,
the court might well take the position that he could hid®
behind thr shield of the statute.
QUESTION:

I would like to ask one question on the

broader problem of collateral attack and this kind of issue

being raised in a Federal collateral attack.

Do you under­

stand that deterrence is the reason why there should be
collateral attack on State convictions raising this kind of
question?
Let me rephrase that.
you.

I am afraid I have confused

As I understand your brief, the underlying reason for

the exclusionary rule is to dater improper searches.
MR. PETERSON:
QUESTION:'

Well, what else?

MR. PETERSON:
is another reason.

That's one reason.

The imperative of judicial integrity

It's a vague concept, but I rather like

the suggestion that the Shelly v. Kramer eipproach when a court
accepts illegally seized evidence, it is effectuating an
unconstitutional act in the same way that in Shelly v. Kramer
the court was effectuating the racially discriminatory
covenants by er.fcr cing those cove nants.

l think that is one

way to lock at tha imperative cf judicial integrity.
QUESTION

And you say ■the same* basis ■— you assert

the same basis for supporting the need for collateral attack
in the Federal court on State convictions.

The two reasons --

deterrence and the imperative of judicial integrity.
MR. PETERSON:
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Yes, those are two reasons.

With respect to the deterrence —(Inaudible)

that has been voiced and

that is that the suppression is necessary to vindicate a

person's own rights.
MR. PETERSON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

That also.

You have also argued that the exclusionary
a legislature as well as to the police.

MR. PETERSON:

I think that has to be the rule

because the: 4th. amendment says that you shall be secure from
unreasonable searches and seizures, and tier© is no way that
you can. fos secure if tha legislature can 'tell the police,

"Do

ss you please."
QUESTION:

You reject the suggestion that th© real

doterranc-a to members of the legislature is the power of the
judiciary to hold unconstitutional any act that is indeed
invalid.
MR. PETERSON:

I certainly do in the context of this

case because it is not going to be held invalid unless you
have a suppression hearing and it’s held invalid at th©
suppressior, hearing.

If it can only bs hold invalid in a

prosecution, then the district attorney is going to refrain
from prosecuting because of the clear unconstituticnality of

group to anticipate by going into court and attacking the

Ellis v. Dvson, this Court's case front last term

51
is a very good example of that.
QUESTION:

Mr. Peterson, to the extent that you rely

on deterrence as the justification for collateral attack, you
are necessarily, I assume, also making the assumption that
there is a difference between these claims that will be
processed in the State court

and those

processed in the Federal courts.

that will be

Because if there is no

difference, you don't need the additional deterrence of
collateral attack.

Is that not correct?

MR. PETERSON:

There may be a difference.

There is

not going to be a difference in every case.
QUESTION:

There will be some cases where the Federal

court, would grant relief but not the State court.
MR. PETERSON:

That's right, and this is a good

example„
QUESTION:

Is it not always true that the Federal

court addresses the-, issue throe or four jears after the
criminal proceeding began and therefore three or four years
after the man started his sentence?
MR. PETERSON:
QUESTION:

Certainly true in this case.

To the extent that you are talking about

police deterrence, you are talking really about whether a man
may serve a three- or four-year sentence as opposed to a
five- or six-year sentence.

You ar© only talking about the

latter portion of his sentence, and in this case indeed we

52

are talking about a man who is already on parole.
MR. PETERSON:
QUESTION:

That’s right, he is on parole.

Isn’t it normally the case that by the

time you exhaust the lengthy proceedings, by the time you
reach the end of the Federal review process, the question of
deterrence has pretty well coma to an end?
MR. PETERSON:

No, not in the sense that we only

deterring officer Lafctin.

These laws are still on the books

today, and as a matter of fact

California has an identical

disorderly conduct statute which is being enforced today in
California.

And if I understand -the deterrence rationale

for

the suppression doctrines, it is to deter other law enforcement
people, including other —
QUESTION:

If you enforce an ordinance like this,

a man will only stay in jail for five years,

if you assume

the State will sustain the ordinance and sustain the conviction.
His only relief is in the Federal court.

The deterrence is

that you tall ths police that you can only put the man away
for five years.
MR. PETERSON:

The deterrence is that you tell the

legislature today, right now, that those laws are only good —
QUESTION:

That such an ordinance will only put a

mar. &v;ay for five years.
MR. PETERSON:

Well, once this Court has declared

the ordinance to be unconstitutional, then I would hops and

53
trust that the State courts would not continue to keep the
person incarcerated and a motion to suppress would be
sustained.
QUESTION:

By a State court.

MR. PETERSON:

By a State court, after this Court

has given its guidance as to the unconstitutionality of the
ordinance* and the appropriate application of the suppression
doctrine when arrest is mads in reliance on an unconstitutional
lew.
QUESTION:

The point you are making almost seems to

suggest that ail these ordinances are fungible, that they are
just exactly alike.

The Chief Justice Warren in the Terry

opinion took about a half a page to point out the myriad
variety, the infinite variety of ordinances.

Now, a great

many people are going to have different, views about whether
a particular holding of this Court fits one way or the other
on a. particular ordinance.
MR. PETERSON:

Isn't that so?

Well, I think that that's true, but

the Court does prcccon principle and it announces
principles which can ho applied with a fair degree of certainty
to fairly similar situations, although it’s easy to posit
redrafting those ordinances it:, any number of ways to mel v them
arguably constitutional in. spite of what this Court has said.
The next ordinance might say "tramp about" or it might say
"saunter," or it might use soma, other equally vagus word so

54
that they could argue that the Powell case doesn't quite fit
this case.

I can only hope that this Court's decisions

will

be applied in good faith by the State court.
QUESTION:

You think acting suspiciously would bo

equally infirro.
MR. PETERSON:

Certainly, as a grounds to make

someone a criminal.
QUESTION:

Yet that's almost precisely the language

this Court usad in the Terry
MR. PETERSON:

case.

But they didn't make someone criminal

for that, and they did not authorize a full custodial arrest
for simply being suspicious.
QUESTION:

They authorized a full search, which in

this case and in many other cases would produce a gun or
heroin or some ether evidence of criminality.
MR. PETERSON:

It authorised a pafcdown where there

is a founded, suspicion that the person might be armed, for
the protection of the police officer.
QUESTION;

Mr. Peterson, is it not correct that in

most of this Court’s decisions passing on the constitutionality
of these vagrancy ordinances, the issue has been presented on
direct appeal. Isn't this the only time 'this kind of issue
has been presented under collateral attack?
MR. PETERSOK:
QUESTION;

Yes.

To this Court?

55
MR. PETERSON:

No.

It was presented last year in

Lgfkowitz v. Newsome, but this Court didn't take it.
QUESTION:

I mean in the decisions by this Court

invalidating such ordinances.

It goes to the question

whether you need collateral review as a method of getting this
kind of issue to this Court.
MR. PETERSON;

Well, I think it's interesting that

this ordinance has been presented to this Court in a number
of other direct appeal cases, in People v. Solomon and I think
People V. Never coming from California, and this Court did
not take the case.

And yet here it is now in a suppression —

wouldn't hav© taken it.
QUESTION:

But the point is the issue gets here

by direct review, whe ther we 'talc© it or not.

cause.

First, there was probable

The district court after an independent examination of

the State trial record found probable cause.

56
Second, counsel’s argument appears to imput© bad
faith to the Town Council of Hendexson.

I would simply point

out that the Henderson vagrancy ordinance was based on a
Nevada statuta.

Tha Nevada statute was in turn based upon the

California disorderly conduct statute.

And the California

disorderly conduct statute was .enacted in 1961 based on a
model suggested by a respected scholar, Professor Arthur
Sherry, of the University of California Lav/ School, who had
served as the head of Governor Earl Warren’s Crime Commission.
Counsel also cited Almeida-Sanchez.

However, in

Almeida-Sarcbsz, as this Court noted in Peltier, there were no
independent considerations of exclusionary rule policy
considered by the Court apart from the validity of tha statute
which was challenged.
I respectfully urge tha Court again to reverse the
decision of the Ninth Circuit and to reinstate this conviction.
After all, this is not a vagrancy case; this is a murder case.
Thanh you, your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE:

Thank you, gentlemen.
