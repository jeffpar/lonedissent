MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 76-39, Memphis Light, Gas and Water against Craft.
Mr. Graves.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRIERSON M. GRAVES, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GRAVES?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My name is Frierson Graves and I represent the
Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division which is a part of the
City of Memphis, a municipal utility which has both electric,
gas and water operations.
This action arose when Mr. and Mrs. Graft and several
others sued the Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division, alleging,
that their utility services were being terminated without due
process of law and they asked for both injunctive and declara­
tory relief.
The District Court implied that there was property
in the utility services — it really didn9t ©ay one way or the
other but the implication is there —• but found that minimum
due process was present in the procedures used by the Light,
Gas and Water, but it suggested a change in the notice that we
were giving to our customers when the final notice was sent
out, which was an additional stuffer or flyer.

This change

was made in the notice and a final order entered.

It was an

4
appeal to the Sixth Circuit which found1 that utility service
was property,,

However, this finding as to due process had two

different holdings,

A3 to Mr, and Mrs, Park© who had an admit­

ted liability for an amount of a bill, the Sixth Circuit said
that our final notice, applying to credit counselors and a
hearing before credit counselors to arrange budget payments or
extended payments, was a sufficient constitutional due process,
notice and hearing.

But, on the other hand, the Crafts who

allegedly had a dispute that our notice and our hearing was
not sufficient, and we didn't have established procedures for
hearing nor did our notice use the word '"dispute" really in it
applying to the Crafts,
We petitioned this court and the two questions were
whether or not utility services are property, and secondly,
whether or not the procedures used by the Light, Gas and
Water meet the minimum requirements of due process., or what
procedures must be used,
I'd like to say, first, that a utility wants to keep
its customers on line.

It wants to generate the revenue,

whether it is a municipal utility or a private utility, be­
cause we in Memphis operate on a nonprofit basis, as a municlpal utility, just to pay expenses.

So the more revenue we are

able to generate from the customer, then the better to spread
that for your administrative expenses among your ratepayers-.
Secondly, we think — and we think our procedures

5
establish this «=>«■ that a utility ought to do all it can to
help its customers pay their bills»

And one of the things that

we did which is in the record of this Court is to establish a
budget procedure, or a policy of having extended payments „
QUESTION:

I suppose a fair corollary of what you

have just suggested is that the paying customers should not be
required to subsidize the nonpaying customers»
MR, GRAVES:

Your Honor, I think that goes back to

the, sort of the common law rules about a utility, that you
shouldn't give free service because, just as you must provide
service to a customer, reasonable service to him so that every
person cun have the service, likewise, you should not give the
service to a customer who is not paying for that because you
are discriminating against the ratepayer in-that way.

And,

of course, they say that reason is both a reasonable rule for
free service, plus the fact that you are avoiding numerous
small, petty suits because utility service is merely a credit
transaction»

Normally, you have an individual, either an oil

contract —» In Memphis, you can have your utilities connected
by calling up on the telephone and saying, "Will you connect
the utilities to my address."

The utilities are connected.

You are asked to pay a deposit of $25.00 in this that's sometimes placed upon your first bill.

You have a small credit
:

transaction there for which we extend the new customer
days of service, almost,

03:

65

that possibility, 60 or 65 days

6
before we can cut the person off*
QUESTION;

Mr* Graves, I want to be sure — The

damages feature of this case -« It's gone, is it not?
MRo GRAVES;

The court suggested that the Crafts

be allowed a $35 credit and they were allowed that credit*

So.,

I don61 consider that damages are still in this case, sir*
QUESTION:

If damages are out, is the case rendered

moot by your new procedures?
MR* GRAVEL;

No, sir, because we still don’t have

what the Petitioners wanted.

We established a notice and

procedure and uixth Circuit said that, they didn’t comment on
our new notice, but our old notice was still constitutionally
deficient*

And so that’s their declaratory judgment and relief

that our notice was not sufficient in this,

And, of course,

we are contending that utility service is really not property*
QUESTION:

The Sixth Circuit's analysis on this

point was based on its — at least in part — on its Palmer
case, wasn't it?
MR0 GRAVEL;
QUESTION:

Yes,
And that didn't address Tennessee law at

all, as } read it.
MR, GRAVES.;

No, sir, that was a private utility that

the court found was sort of callous and we don't think that
our policies do that*

They were

Also, it was conceded that

utllitifcy services were property, in that case for a private

utility
QUESTIONS

What do you understand to be the

reasoning of the Sixth Circuit here as to why a continued
utility service is a property under the Fourteenth Amendment?
MRo GRAVES;

Your Honor, they cited a number of

cases which rely on several reasons, one, that water or
electricity is indispensible to life and, therefore, you
should have it,

And they cite a number of cases, both

District and other circuits, that tend to say both necessity
of life or that there is some

by having this as a municipal

utility, we have that state action, and also that you have the
rule that you should give utilities to every customer»
QUESTION;

Of course, the state action inquiry is

quite different from the property intereat»
MR, GRAVES;
QUESTION:

Thatss right,
Mr, Graves, under Tennessee law, is there

a legal right to receive a utility service so long as one pays
for it?
MR, GRAVES:

Yes, sir.

We go back to a.1902

Tennessee case of Jones v, Nashville and that established,
more or less, a franchise ordinance.

That establishes what

I think was merely the common law and general rule of
utilities, that quasi-public type of corporation,-that when
you provide the service you must give it to all customers,
but you have »- and the right is upon the utility to furnish

8
those services to the customers, but the utility may make
reasonable rules0

And among those rules is that they can

deny the service to a person If he doesn't comply with It,
QUESTION;

This case involves a dispute as to

whether or not the bill submitted by the utility was correct»
MR0 GRAVES;

Yes* sir* and I think the rule, whether

it is an admitted liability or a dispute, that the utility can
determine the rules and regulations and that the right of
either suing for an injunction, paying under protest and
suing or suing for damages* that the rule was made in common
law for the utilifcytg benefit and not as an entitlement or an
independent source or a state statute to allow an entitlement
to the customer, because the utility could terminate but it
did so at its peril in this case In making it subject for
damages„
QUESTION:

Your position is that state law remedies

were adequate and no constitutional, there is no constitutional
entitlement to a prior hearing»
MR» GRAVES:

Yes, sir»

And that you cannot argue

that water is indispensable to life or electricity is indis­
pensable for life, because if that is so, then a person with
an admitted liability for it, that's merely using the services,
why should you ever be able to cut them off?

Congress this

past year appropriated $200 million for the Community
development Act to help pay on utility bills for this past

9
winter»

But that is if they want energy stamps or other

manners in which to pay for utility services it should be a
taxpayer program and not a ratepayer program that is upon the
utility to maintain this»
QUESTION:

I take it then you say if a utility sends

a person a notice and says, "You are cut off," and the person
wants to know why and the utility says, "It's none of your
business," and then the person sues the utility and wins, then
the utility freely admits that, "Weil, we just cut you off for
no reason at all," you would agree, under state law, the
uti3.1tey would be liable?
MR» GRAVES:

Yes, sir.

And under state law, the

utility would have to adopt reasonable rules, because —
QUESTION:

I understand that»

But you say despite

that there should be no constitutional requirement that the
utility even notify the person as to what the basis for the
\

cutoff is.
MR, GRAVES:

Your Honor, I think they've got to send

them the bill so they know what they have to pay»

And cnee

they know their just due —
QUESTION:

Well., I know, but I

In my example,

the utility simply notifies the person, "You are cut off,"
gives no reason whatsoever»
MR» GRAVES:

No, sir, he couldn't do that.

have to tell them what amount wa-s due»

They'd

10

QUESTION.8

There is some constitutional requirement,

then, for adequate prior notice, or not?
MR. GRAVES:

Ho, sir, the common law rule is that

you must send any creditor his bill in this.

When you have

sent the creditor his bill and j^ou have told him, ‘'You owe
$9«89 for utilitities," then you are telling him pay the
$9»89 or you will be terminated by a certain date.
QUESTION:

You do say, then, that there is a

requirement that the utility, beforehand, before cutting off,
go through some procedure to let the person know what his
obligation is.
MR. GRAVES:

What his obligation is, but not the

fact that he may dispute what that obligation is and have a
continued right to get the water out of the city pipes in the
street or the gas out of the pipes and continue this while he
is

during a dispute, because if they want to terminate it on

the basis of this, they don't have to do a continued credit
transaction, and they can't say well, that's because it is
a necessity of life or they say there is some independent
source, such as,a state statute to do this.'

Because there

was state statute enough in Jackson when they codified common
law rights to say **»
QUESTION:

What if the utility cuts the person off

without sending him the bill?
MR. GRAVES:

I think that that gives rise to damage

I don't know if it is constitutional or not,

but I think —■
QUESTION;

That's what I want to know.

That's

what the issue is in this case, at least part of it„
MR. GRAVES:

I don't think the issue is whether or

not you must send a bill.
QUESTION:

I admit that you must send a bill,

Well, why?

What's the source of the

obligation?
MR. GRAVES:

The source of the obligation is the
The question is, do you have to continue

selling on credit while you are litigating whether they owe
the past credit, or not?
QUESTION:

Well, if you agree with Mr» Justice

White's question of a moment ago, then you have to — you
are conceding there is some sort of a limited property interest,
are you r ot?
MR» GRAVES:

I am saying under the common law there

is a right to receive the service so long as you obey the
rules and regulations.
QUESTION:

And under the statute of the state.

the state law»
MR. GRAVES;

Well, under common law regarding

utilities»
QUESTION:
MR. GRAVES:

Is that in force in Tennessee?
Of course, sir.

It is in force

Under

12
everywhere, just like Jackson v, Metropolitan„

They had to

*

furnish services to anybody that would pay for them.

And if

they didn't pay for it, then the question was could they cut
it off?
QUESTION:

What I want to know is;

The utility

cuts a person off, doesn8t tell them why, doesn't send them
a bill, doesn't do anything, just cuts them off.

Would the

person then have a 1933 suit for failure to provide an
adequate notice beforehand?

That's part of the issue in

this case,
MR, GRAVES;

You are making the assumption that they

are not sending any bill at all, not making any claim
QUESTION:
MR, GRAVES :
QUESTION:

Yes, I am.
All right.

I just said they didn't send any bill,

didn't give them any notice.
MR. GRAVES:

If they send a bill, then

Now what?

Your Honor, then I think they merely

have a common law right to damages against the utility and
it is not a constitutional

no violation of constitutional

right,
QUESTION:

No violation of constitutional rights,

despite the fact that there is a property interest there*
MR» GRAVES :

Well, I don't consider it a property

Interest for continued payment, continued credit being given,
QUESTION:

May I ask you a hypothetical question

13

to see if it will shed some light on your position, for me,
A newspaper is not a public utility, is it?
MR„ GRAVE:':-;
QUESTION;

Thatss right, sir»
But they serve people at their homes,

with a carrier service and bring the newspaper there0

Would

you say there is any obligation on the part of the newspaper,
enforceable obligation to deliver newspaper just because people
want it, or can they refuse anyone they want?
MRo GRAVES;

1 think they can refuse it, like any

other credit transaction, sir,
QUESTION:

Now, a utility, on the other hand, is not

free to infuse service, is it, in Tennessee?
MR* GRAVES;

It is not free to refuse service except

under its rules and regulations, if it hasn't been paid for
past servicec,
QUESTION:

In the first instance, if a customer

calls up and says, "I want water, gas and electricity," they
must -MRo GRAVES:

They must serve them if it has the

reasonable means to do it at that time*

If they live five

QUESTION:

My question assumes they are on the main

linea
MR* GRAVES;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir,.
So, that distinction is of some importance

14

to this case, isn't it?
MR. GRAVES:

Yes, sir.

And we say that -- in answer,

again, to Justice White, if they didn't get a bill to begin
with, then they have received some damages and they have an
adequate remedy of law, but it is not a constitutional right
to continued paying it on the basis of not paying a bill and
not having a continued entitlement to credit while they are
litigating for past credit extended»
QUESTION;

Now, the newspaper could give you a

subscription free because they might think it was good for
them to have you on their subscriber list, but charge me,
your next-door neighbor, full price, could they not?
MR» GRAVES;
QUESTION:
MR. GRAVES:

Yes, sir»
But they can't do that in a utility»
No, sir.

They have to charge everyone

the same rates, without discrimination.
QUESTION:

None of this fyas to do with the

Constitution?
MR. GRAVES:
QUESTION:

No, sir, it does not.
If I walked into Macy's and asked them

to charge something for me, I take it even if Macy's is
partly owned by the City of New York, they are free to tell
me, "No, we are not going to charge."

The fact that I may be

a delinquent creditor and they haven't sent me a bill doesn't
mean that something in the Constitution gives me a property

15

right to get my next transaction charged*

But, am I not

right In thinking that Tennessee treats the utilities somewhat
differently than it would Maey's?
MR, GRAVES:

Our Patterson case says that you may

adopt a rule that you can terminate for nonpayment.

And our

other cases say that you can still terminate for nonpayment
even if there is a dispute because the termination is at your
peril and the utility could be sued for damages if they made
that; improper determination,
QUESTION:

Mr, Graves, I have a question that I

wanted tc ask earlier because it is really a threshold question,

We were being asked for declaratory

individual, other members of boards would make policy.

He may have mentioned that, but

he still entered his decree and said we should have a better
notice and we should give credit and our individual commis­
sioners were also sued in this case, as well.
QUESTION:

Would you agree that if the Court of

Appeals, through Judge Peck, is correct in saying that the
district Court held that you were not suable under 1983 that
that was a correct holding.
MR. GRAVES:

MR. GRAVES:

Because you are a municipality.
Yes, sir.

Yes, sir»

May it please the Court, I would like to talk a
little bit about the facts on our hearing and notice, because
we consider «—
QUESTION:

First of all, before you get to that,

do you concede, then, that there is property?
MR.GRAVES:

No, sir.

I am not conceding there is

property because I don't consider there is an independent
source, by state statute or otherwise, that you've said in
Board of Regents v. Roth and others that makes it — that
what we are talking about is the general law of utilities
which would apply to a private or a municipality, which says
that you can make reasonable rules which include, at your
peril, terminating someone for what you consider nonpayment.
QUESTION:

Right.

So, now when you are moving on to

talk aboiit the procedures that you do provide, you are saying,
assuming arguendo there was a deprivation of property, but
only arguendo, is that right?
MRo GRAVES:

That's right.

MR, GRAVES:

No, no, no,

No mistake at all.

They say, "We have decided to cut you off.

They
You

paid your bills, but we are going to violate state law.

We

have all sorts of reasons, you are a bad person^" whatever it
may be.

Does he have a federal property interest in having

continued service? foes he have a property interest in
continued service when he has paid his bills — and everybody
acknowledges he has paid his bills?

Is that a property right,

13
within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, and If not,
why not?
MR„ GRAVED:

Your Honor, I think, under the law

of utilities, he has the right to a service, whether that
makes it a constitutional right —
QUESTION:

I am not asking that*

MR* GRAVES:
QUESTION:

That's admitted*

That's admitted*
Why isn't that a property right, within

the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment?
MR* GRAVES:

Because I don't think it reaches that

independent source that the Court has said must make it
Fourteenth Amendment, that is by state law, rule or under­
standing that you've done it*
then you have made it*

Now if you say that is so,

But when you look at the education

case, Goss v* Lopez, and say because the state chose to
provide the service and passed the statute that may — and
also a statute you must attend school, that made it federally
protected*

But we don't have that statute or that independent

source*
QUESTION:

But you have a state law that says you

must provide the service when —
MR* GRAVES:

No, sir, it is not a state law, it is

just the regular law of utilities, just the common law*
QUESTION:

But it is the law followed in the State

of Pennes see, isn51 it?

MR, GRAVES:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, and every state,
Don't you have a decision of the Supreme

Court of Tennessee to that effect?
MR. GRAVES:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
You aren't drawing a distinction, are you,

between the law declared by your court and the law declared
by your legislature?
MR, GRAVES:

I am from the standpoint that they are

declaring it the common law for utilities throughout every
state, Your Honor, and they are following the general rule,
Nov; if that makes it a constitutionally protected property
right, then it may be in this.

But I didn't think it met the

test of Roth.
QUESTION:

In Roth that you cite, was there a state

statute?
MRo GRAVES:

Yes, sir.

You had a state statute that

provided for free education and a state statute for compulsory
attendance.

And when they suspended somebody then they should

be given a hearing.
QUESTION:

You are thinking of Goss v, Lopez.

MR, GRAVES:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

I thought you cited Roth, avowed tenure,

MR, GRAVES:
QUESTION:

Avowed tenure, yes, sir,
Was that a statutory right?

MR. GRAVES:

I think they sent it back to determine

whether or not it was a de facto type of righto

Suppose

the university board had prescribed tenure*
MR* GRAVES:

Well, our rules and regulations also

provide that if you pay your bilByou get your service, but
if you don’t pay your bills you don't get the service*

So

that's the distinction between them*
QUESTION:

I suppose in Tennessee there are some

privately-owned utilities, are there not?
MR* GRAVES:

Yes, sir, and they are under the

Now?, those privately owned utilities

they not?

MR* GRAVES;
QUESTION;

Yes*
Would you say with respect to a private

utility that is or is not a property right In Fourteenth
Amendment terms?
MR* GRAVES;

Your Honor, if they were under state

action, but some of the district Court cases say because of

22

those state statutes that makes it a property right»

On the

other hand, I say that's no different than just the codifica­
tion of the common law, and does that make it a property
right?
QUESTION:

In other words, you would draw no

distinction between a private utility in this respect and a
public utility?
MR. GRAVES:

No, sir, we are still subject to

damages and liability for failure to abide by our own rules
and regulations.
Mow, I would like to say something about our notice
in this case.

We sent out notices that not only had a final

notice but it also had a flyer in it that said if you had any
dispute, in some cases.

In some cases, it didn't say the

word "dispute" but it said,'if you are having difficulty paying
your bill, come to the credit counselors."
We think that the record clearly shows that we
were giving adequate notice and a hearing, for this reason.
When somebody gets a utility bill they say, "I didn't use
that much service, you made a mistake.

When you talk to the Light, Gas and Water, we re-read

cut off again, December 28th

they called up and got an

extension until January 8th; in this time, the meters were
finally combined because the electricians and plumber had
made a mistake in combining which ones that were there.

So

that you can't say that we were callous toward the Grafts, or

24

anybody»

And we consider that when we were giving that

information and handling the people and adopting the budget
procedure and that when you have a dispute, regardless of
whether it is an amount of a bill or whether you owe that
much or whether you owe it at all -- "If you go to Macy's
you go to the credit department

to any big place.-When

you go to the utility, those notices which are not in the
opinion but in the Appendix say MLGW credit department at
the bottom.

So that cs where you know to go.

MR. GRAVE»:
QUESTION:

Macy's is not government.
That's right, sir.
The Fourteenth Amendment applies only

to state government or »»
MR. GRAVES:

That's right, sir, but when we give you

notice of who to come to and we say, "MLGW credit department,"
orr"credit counselors, " or “if you are having difficulty paying

credit department — that's the people that sign the bill —
and that the record shows that we handled over 100,000 people
through either the credit department or calling up to get
extensions or re-reading their meters, and we did it.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

25

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M» DANIEL, ESQ0,
FOR THE RESPONDENTS
MR» DANIEL;

Mr, Chief Justice* and may it please

the Court;
This case arose as a result of a dispute that
developed in Memphis* Tennessee* between Mr* and Mrs» Willie
So Craft and the Memphis Light* Gas and Water Division.
Without going into the details of that dispute* I think it
is fair to say that the dispute existed over a period of
several months prior to the filing of this suit, during which
time the Craft's utility services were terminated on several
occasions* and also during which time the Grafts made good
faith efforts* as the District Court found* to resolve their
dispute with Memphis Light* Gas and Water Division.
The dispute that developed occurred because of
double computer billing that was being sent to the Craft-s
residence»

And during this period* Mrs» Craft made several

efforts* even to the point of going to the offices of
Memphis Light* Gas and Water Division and spending the entire
day in an effort to ascertain the reasons for the terminations
and to try to straighten out the problem»
There is one important fact that should be noted
in this that is important to a proper resolution of this
casa»

And that is that Memphis Light* Gas and Water Division

then, as now, has no orderly dispute resolution process.

And

26

that's why Mrs» Craft was unable to resolve her dispute with
the Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division.
Mr. Graves has indicated that Memphis Light, Gas
and Water Division did not harshly treat the Crafts.
record is quite the contrary in this case.

The

On one occasion

when Mrs. Craft called to explain that her bill had been paid,
she was met with the response, 1!Pay it again."

And on another

occasion when she was talking with someone at the Memphis Light,
Gas and Via ter Division concerning her bill, she was actually
cursed by one of the employees.

But the important point is

that no dispute resolution process exists within Memphis Light,
Gas and Water Division.
QUESTION:

Do you have a small claims court system

in Tennessee?
MR. DANIEL:

We have what’s called a General

Sessions Court, Your Honor, but it is not a small claims court
in the sense that no lawyers are allowed to appear such as we
have: in some states.
QUESTION:
paid your bill.

Suppose the notice said, "You haven't

If you have any complaints about it, come and

see Mr. io and so at Room so and so, between the hours of so
and so.

Bring any Information you have.

you want to.

Bring your lawyer if

And we will hear your side of the story to see

if we have made a mistake."
Would that be enough to satisfy you,before there is

27

a cutoff?
MR» DANIEL:

I think a notice of that sort is the

type that we are asking,,
QUESTION:
MR» DANIEL:

lo

your answer is yes?
It is hard to say yes to a specific

notice without seeing it in print and going over it»
QUESTION:

But you don’t,for example* claim that

before there is a cutoff there has to be some independent
hearing examiner or a full adversary trial?
MS» DANIEL:

Well* your question was directed to the

notice* but I think what we are asking for is the type of
notice that you just mentioned, to give the person an
opportunity for some type of hearing»

That would only have

to be, at the first stage, an informal conference with a
responsible official at Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division»
And then if it Is not resolved at that stage, I think there
should be an informal hearing before an impartial hearing
examiner»
QUESTION:
MR» DANIEL:
QUESTION:

You mean before a termination of service?
Yes, Your Honor»
What authority do you have for that in

our cases?
MR» DANIEL:

I think in numerous cases decided! by

this Court»
QUESTION:

Name one

28

MR0 DANIEL:

Such as Goldberg v» Kelly,

I think

before the termination of welfare service in that case -*»
QUESTION:

What kind of hearing was that?

MR0 DANIEL:

That was an informal hearing before an

independent hearing examiner prior to the terminatione
Let me make clear that when I say
QUESTION:

Well* when you say an independent hearing

examiner, did not Goldberg, v, Kelly simply say that it must
be within the organization, but a different person?
MRo LANILL:

That is corrects

And I wanted to point

out we are not necessarily asking for someone outside the
company, so long — even if it is an employee of the company
-- so long as that person haa the independence to look at the
case fairly and to make a decision in favor of the consumer,
we feel that that would be ac3equate0
QUESTION:

Lon6t you think that the natural urge of

a utility to sell as much of it's product as possible gives
them a certain amount of independence in that respect?
MR* DANIEL:

I suppose it does, but the record in

this case indicates that they also have some problems in
resolving disputes that develop between customers *

And one

of the problems that Mrs6 Graft had was that the persons that
she was communicating with were lower-level employees who
really did not have the authority to resolve any dispute that
might have developed0

We are saying the situation would

29

probably be Improved If a responsible company official, in
other words, a higher-level employee —
QUiLTION:

Mre Daniel, is the reason for that that

it is a public utility or that it is a state?
MRo DANIEL:

I think because it is a state in this

case.
QUESTION:

You wouldn't have any claim unless the

defendant is a state, a state within the meaning of the
Fourteenth Amendment,
MR, DANIEL:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor,
And what about the other officers?

MR, DANIEL;
QUESTION:

I am not sure —
The c omraiss ioners ,

MR, DANIEL:
QUESTION:

Well, the —
Are they state officers?

MR, DANIEL:

Well, they are employees of the city,

at least insofar as they are officials of the Memphis Light,
Gas and Water Division,
QUESTION:
MR, DANIEL:
QUESTION:

They are state officers, yes,

Well, their president and vice-president,
Yes,
So far, you have largely,")in response to

questions from the Court, addressed yourself to the due
process of the ease,Mr, Daniel0

Do you think the Sixth

Circuit's analysis of the property interest question, which
I suppose logically comes before the due process Inquiry, is

30

satisfactory in the light of Roth and GInderman.
MR. EANIjL:
full as it should be.

No* I don't think their analysis is as
I think at the time this case was

decided they were just relying primarily on other cases»

1

think* as this Court has pointed out* there must be reference
to whether this property interest exists under state lawc

But

I think it is clear that under the state law of Tennessee a
person has a right to receive utility service and the utility
supplier has a duty to supply.

So I think a proper analysis

under Roth and C ind erman and more recent decisions of this
Court* that there clearly is a property interest under state
law.
QUESTION:

And you did not appeal or seek cert

from that portion of the Sixth Circuit's opinion which held
that where the bill is undisputed judgment goes for the
defendant in a case like that.
MR. DAN ISC: . That is correct.

Vie do not assert that

the customers have the right to free utility service.

There

is no question but what utility service may be terminated for
nonpayment in Tennessee.

It is just that we question the

right of the utility service* under the Fourteenth Amendment,
to terminate utility service while a dispute is pending.
QUESTION:

I want to be clear that you are not asking

that the fact finder to resolve this dispute must be independent
and neutral* apart from the utility

MR» DANIEL:
QUESTION;

That is correct, we are not asking —
It can be an employee of the utility,

you said, I think, a responsible representative?
MRo DANIEL;

A responsible company official,,

I

think that would be adequate.
QUESTION;
MRo DANIEL;

I am not sure what official means0
Well, I think there was a distinction

made in the Palmer case of the Sixth Circuit, in that an
official or an officer of the company would have more freedom
to rule in favor of the customer than a lower«level employee»
In other words —
QUESTION;
department»

Mr» Graves suggests you go to the credit

Would that be okay?

MR» DANIEL;

No, I don5t think that would be okay

because the problem, as the record in this case indicates, is
that the employees in the credit department are concerned
primarily with getting people to pay their bills»
not concerned with resolving disputes»

They are

The record in this

case indicates that they don‘t even have the time to do that
because there are so many calls that they get each day there
is no way possible that they can deal with disputes concerning
bills»

The only thing they can deal with is people who are

having difficulty paying an admitted liability»
QUESTION; . Mr» Daniel, may I ask you a question,
please

32

I8d like to ask about your objection to the notice
and the Court of Appeals holding on the notice, and put to
one side the hearing problem»

And also, of course. I am just

asking you about the constitutional requirement as to an ade=
quate notice, as opposed to what a commission might say is
desirable, in the sense of telling the customer how to go in
and straighten out the dispute»
Your point, as I understand it, is that the notice,
although it told the customer of the ham that was about to
occur, namely, that he was about to be cut off, it did not
explain to the customer the procedure to be followed in
avoiding that ham»
MR0 DANIEL:
QUESTION;

That is correct»
Now, is there any precedent that you

know of, under the Fourteenth Amendment, for holding that a
notice must do more than tell the person to be harmed about
the prospective harm but must go further and. in effect, give
him legal advice as to what his possible remedies must be?
MR, I'AN IE In

Well, I think, the holdings of this

Court indicate that the question of notice and hearing is
always a variable according to the circumstances of a
particular case»

I can't cite any specific holding that

would require that, but I think that under recent decisions of
this Court the type of notice that has been required in
carta in cases, such as Morrissey y0 Brewer, was a very

33
specific notice and It Informed the person of more than just
the action that was about to be taken«

It also Informed the

person of the steps that they might take to prevent the
threatened ha rim
The problem in this case la that Mrs0 Craft
attempted to take some steps to prevent the threatened harm*
She acted as any reasonable person would and went to the
office of Memphis Light, C-as and Water Division, but was
unable to resolve the dispute because she was never informed
either there or in the notice of what she could do,
QUESTION:

Often, I suppose, in a serious matter

when a citizen gets notice of something about to happen, one
thing he can do is ask a lawyer for help*

Presumably, if

either of these people had asked a lawyer for help, it would
have been straightened out in a hurry»
MR0 DAN ILL:

Well,. I am not even sure that it would

have been straightened out in a hurry because -»
QUESTION: .You don*t think a letter to the president
of the company which said, "You terminate this service and
you are going to get sued for $3 million," or something like
that, might not have gotten action?
MR» DANIEL;

That*s possible, but my only point is

there is no dispute resolution process within Memphis Light,
Gas and Water*
QUESTION:

Does the record tell us how often there

34
are disputes about the amount of the bill as opposed to
questions of credit, and things like that?
>

MR, DANIAL:

The only indication in the record as

far as numbers is that during the year 1973* I believe* when
this case was being litigated, there were something like
33*000 high-bill complaints,

Now, as to whether that can be

classified as a dispute, I don't know, but I think that it
probably would be.

This is certainly different from some of

the cases in this area, such as the one that Your Honor
decided in the Seventh Circuit where the record Indicated that
there were only a small number of disputes that developed over

)

a certain time period.

And also,I believe, in the Lucas case

which Your Honor decided, there was a process within the
company for resolving disputes and most of them were, in
fact, resolved, prior to termination of service.
QUToTIQN;

That's right.

They were required by

state regulation.
MR. DANIEL:

That's correct.

Another important factor there is that the Public
Service Commission in that case, since it was a privately
owned utility, had the authority and did in fact intervene

I
on many occasions and halt the termination of service while
the dispute was being resolved.

In this case, the Public

Service Commission has no jurisdiction over Memphis Light,
Gas and Vater Division, and there is nobody that can intervene

33
like that and halt the termination while the dispute is
being resolved,,
QUESTION:

The Court would have to supervise this,

wouldn’t they?
MRo DANIEL:

No, I don’t think so, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

That's what v/orries me.

MR. DANIEL:

I think all we are asking the Court

to do is to set up or to order Memphis Light, Gas and Water
Division to set up a dispute resolution process.

It would not

mean that every time a person had a dispute concerning their
utility service that they could run into federal court for
a resolution.
QUESTION:

Why not?

MR. DANIEL:

Well, I think there would be no right

of action in federal court to resolve the dispute.

The claim

here ,1s that the Fourteenth Amendment is violated because due
process is not being provided.
QUESTION:

Well, I mean, due process is, you know,

is about like that, isn’t it?

Who would decide how much due

process was going on?
MR. DANIEL:
QUESTION:
the phone.

I think we are asking you =~
I mean, you said somebody cursed over

Well, if you put that person :Ln charge of the

division that wouldn't help, would It?
MR. DANIEL:

I suppose not, Your Honor

36
QUESTION:

Well* what would help?

MR» DANIEL:

Well* I think what would help is* as

we've discussed previously* to have a hearing examiner who
has the responsibility to hear disputes that develop between
consumers and Memphis Light* Gas and Water Division who has
the authority to render a decision —
QUESTION:

And to enforce it?

MR» DANIEL:
QUESTION:

And to enforce that decisione
How can you do that in a public utility?

MR» DANIEL:
QUESTION:

Well, I would —
You mean he could enforce it

Say*

become chairman of the board? Or council* or whatever this
thing is?
MR» DANIEL:
QUESTION:

The commissioners of the utilities»
So he would be over them?

MR» DANIEL:
over them»

I don't think he would necessarily be

I really don't see a problem developing that Your

Honor has anticipated»

I assume enough good faith on the

part of Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division that if they
have a hearing examiner and he hears the case and orders that
the utilities be turned back on *that he would be a high enough
company official that he could order lower- level employees to
turn the utility service back on»
QUESTION:

That's the first time you've used the

term "hearing examiner»"

Previously, you had said. I thought*

37
any responsible employee of the company»

There is quite a

difference between that and a hearing examiner»

That has some

connotation that responsible official does not have»
MR» DANIEL:

If there is any confusion there, I was

using the terns interchangeably, that the person who is hearing
the case could be a responsible company official.
QUESTION:
MR» DANIEL:
QUESTION:

Sort of an ombudsman type.
That is correct.» Your Honor.
You used the term "hearing the case"

which certainly, I would think, does nothing to dispel the
fea:'S that some of us may share with Justice Marshall.

If

this is a case that goes before a hearing examiner, you really
have a brand new division of the utility.

Are you suggesting

that formal a procedure is required simply by the language in
the Fourteenth Amendment that says no property shall be taken
without due process?
MR. DANIEL:

I think if we look at what the Sixth

Circuit did,for example, in the Falmer case, as an indication
of what I am talking about.

There they required that a respon­

sible company official within the utility supplier be able to
hear the dispute in an informal manner and make the decision
as to whether service should be terminated or not.

So that,

while the person hearing the dispute was an employee of the
official, they nevertheless conducted an informal type dispute
resolution process.

But they would not necessarily have to be

38
completely disassociated from the utility supplier.
QUESTION?

Suppose the notice said you owe some

money*you are going to be cut off in 20 days.
any objections* file your suit in court.
a preliminary injunction.

If you have

And you can ask for

If you can satisfy the ordinary

standards for a preliminary injunction, of course* the service
wouldn’t be cut off.

But if you can't satisfy them* the

service will be cut off.

Then you can go ahead and try your

lawsuit and get damages if you win.

This is a state court

suit.
That's the notice you get.

Would that satisfy the

Fourteenth Amendment, or do you think the Fourteenth Amendment
requires an administrative hearing?
MR. DANIEL:

I think the Fourteenth Amendment requires

some type of opportunity for hearing prior to the termination
of sjervice.

I do not think that the common law remedy of

suing for damages in state court would be adequate.
Now, this Court, recently, in Ingraham v. Wright,
held that a common law suit for damages was adequate in the
context of corporal punishment.
different from here.

I think that case is quite

First of all, the governmental interest

Involved there in school discipline =—
QUESTION:

You mean a full court hearing isn't good

enougn procedure to satisfy the Due Process Clause?
MR. DANIEL:

The problem with the full court hearing

39
in that situation is that the burden of proof is switched to
the customer to shoxv that he is right and the utility service
is wrong*,

That's a reverse of the normal common law procedure,

that one asserting something due has the burden of proving that
it's due.

It puts the burden on the customer to hire a lawyer,

pay the litigation expenses required to institute a stay in
state court.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose you had this administrative

setup the way you want it and you have a so-called responsible
company official, wouldn't it be enough under our cases, if
after hearing the customer's side of the story, he said, "I
think there is probable cause to believe that you haven't paid
your bill and that you owe us some money, and there is probable
cause to cut the service*1?

Isn't that sufficient?

He doesn't

have to make some final decision, just has to say some probables
cause for it.
MRo DANIEL:

I think that that might be sufficient

as an initial process , but, as the Sixth Circuit required in
the Palmar case,what we are asking is that if he makes that
decision there still should be some type of informal hearing
where a written decision is rendered.
QUESTION:
MR. DANIEL:
QUESTION!
right now.

This is before the cutoff?
Not necessarily before the cutoff.
Well, that's what we are talking about

40

MR, DANIEL:

Before the cutoff, that might be

sufficient under the decisions of this Court,
QUESTION:

Can you say whether it would or not be

sufficient?
MR, DANIEL:

I think it would be sufficient before

the cutoff, as long as at least after the cutoff there would
be a more formalized hearing or -QUESTION:

But It still has to be administrative,

MRa DANIEL:

That’s correctc

QUESTION;

Could the person have one a month, a

hearing once a month?
MR, DANIEL:

I suppose it's conceivable that a

person could abuse the process In that way, but I don't think
the fact that there might somewhere be a customer who would
abuise the process would mean that we should abandon the
requirements cf the Fourteenth Amendment,
QUESTION:

I mean, if the complaint is

which I

don’t know about you/ but I have the same complaint every
month — my bill is too much,

So I would go there each month

and have a hearing and I would say, "This is too much," and
the company would say, "Here is the meter.
what else would you do?
MR, DANIEL:

Read it,"

Nothing,
That’s correct,,

I suppose it’s

possible —
QUESTION:

Does that seem silly to you?

Then,

41

MR,, DANIEL:

It does, and I don't think most people

would abuse the process In that way, because what we are
talking about here is real disputes that people have concerning
their utility service,,
QUESTION:

The dispute Is that you were double

billed which, obviously, was a mistake*
MR* DANIEL:
QUESTION;

That's correct*
And you'll never have a hearing with

who made the mistake*

You'll never have a hearing with the

computer*
MR* DANIEL:
QUESTION:

That's correct, you would not*
do, I don't see what the hearing would

be about*
MR* DANIEL:

Well, the hearing, such as in the Craft

case, would be about why the Crafts were getting two bills
eve:ry month, rather than one that most customers get and
whether that bill was correct or not*
QUESTION:

That was partly related to the fact that

they had an off-agaln on-again program on their own part, two
meters and then one meters and then two meters* They brought
on some of these problems by their own indecision, did they
not, or changes of decision?
MR* LANIEL':

Even though they were aware that they

had two meters, they thought and were, in fact, told by a
Memphis Light, Gas and Water 11vision employee that one of the

42

meters was bolted off* and so they thought that service was
only coming through one meter.

I think* as the district court

found* Mr» and Mrs. Craft were making every effort to find out
what the problem was and were ready and willing to pay the
bill that was duel it was just that they could not understand
why they were getting those two bills and Memphis Light* Gas
and Water Division seemed unable to explain it to them.
QUESTION?

Now this has been litigated for nearly

five years* hasn't it?
MR. DANIEL;

Well* it started in 197^, so about

four years.
QUESTION:
MR. DANIEL:
that's correct.

1973, I thought.
Well, the dispute started in 1973,

The suit was not actually filed until '74.

If the Court please* what we are asking this Court
to do in terms of requiring due process here* as this
Court has done in numerous cases, is to balance the private
interest that is involved here and the government's interest.
The private interest that is involved here is an extremely
important interest.

It is the interest in the very means to

life in some situations.

We are talking about water service*

gas and electrical service which:, in the cold winter months*
provide*the means for heat In most municipalities In this
country.
important.

So the significance of this interest Is quite
Termination of this interest can cause serious

43
harm to a customer,and in some cases has even caused death*
And so we are not talking about a situation like this Court
^

dealt with in Ingraham v. Wright, where we are talking about
corporal punishment of students.

We are talking about the

potential for much more serious ham to the Plaintiff.
We also have to balance that against the government interest
Involved here.

The government's interest, of course, is

preserving scarce physical resources.

But there is no reason

that Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division cannot provide the
type of notice and hearing that we are requesting within the
tiiae^frame that they presently terminate service, and still be
.

}

able to preserve their scarce physical resources.

The fact

that a person gets a hearing does not mean that they are not
going to have to pay the bill.

If it is found that the

customer is incorrect, they will nevertheless have to pay the
bill -QUESTION;
MR. DANIEL;

And also the cost of the hearing.
And the cost of the hearing, we would

concede that.
QUESTION:

Would you tell me why this is a proper

1933 suit?

MR9 DANIEL:

Well, if the Court please, we are

dealing here with a property interest under the Fourteenth
Amendment and, of course, the source —

I am really going to Mr, Justice Stewart5a

do,

MRo DANIEL:
QUESTION:

Isn’t it always open?

Yes, Your Honor.
Well, what about it then?

MR. DANI-EL:

I think that we have sued individual

defendants here, commissioners of Memphis Light, Gas and
Water Division, who clearly are persons, under Lection 1983,
even though it is questionable whether Memphis Light, Gas and
Water Division, itself, is a person.
QUESTION:

You say it is questionable.

What do you

think the answer is?
MR. DANI-.L:

I think they are probably not, because

in Memphis the Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division Is not
a separate corporation.
QUESTION:

It is a part of the city.

So this party, to the extent that

Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division is a party here.
It couldn’t be?

MR. DANIEL:

That's correct, Your Honor.

I would

agree with that.
QUESTION:

And let's assume there were some damages.

Would it be paid out of city funds?
MRo DANIEL:

I don't know the answer to that, since

the damages would be —
QUESTION:
city funds?

What if they were to be paid out of

Then are the individuals persons?

MR. DANIEL:

I think that whether the damages were

paid out of city funds would not make any difference, as to
whether they are persons under Section 1983.
QUESTION:

Would it make any difference under the

21 evenbh Amendment?
MR. DANIEL:
QUESTION:
MR. DANIEL:

I don't believe it would.
Because it is a city.
Because it is a city, that's correct,

Your Honor.
I did want to raise one point in that regard.
Mr. Justice Blackmun raised the Issue of mootness in this case
and raised the question as to whether there is a damage issue
still open.

It is Respondent's position that there is a

damage issue still open in this case, if this Court affirms
the holding of the Sixth Circuit.

There were no damages

ordered at the District Court level because the district
Court held that we had no due process right, but if this case

46
is remanded on the holding that the Plaintiff did have a right
to due process prior to termination of service, I think the
issue of damages would still be an open question.

)

that reason the case is not moot.

And for

In addition to that, on

the claims for declaratory and injunctive relief, I think that
this case would come within that; class of cases which are
capable of repetition

yet evading review, as set out by

previous decisions of this Court, so that it would not be
moot for that reason.
QUESTION:

Mr. Daniel, in addition to the claim that

there was a deprivation of property here without due process
of law, there was also a claim on behalf of a party named
)

Holmes that there was a denial of equal protection of the
law by the Defendant.
MR. DANIEL:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Nobody has talked.

What happened to

that in the Court of Appeals, and what's your position?
MR. DANIEL:

That issue, we believe, has been finally

decided by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

. -

That issue was not raised by the Petitioners.
QUESTION:
MR.

ANIEL:

QUESTION:

So It is out of the case.
That's correct.
That was a refusal to install, I think,

wasn't It?
MR. - ANILL:

That is correct. Your Honor, and the

Sixth Circuit held that there was a denial of equal protection
and I believe the Petitioners have conceded that point»
QUESTION:
I see.

And there was no appeal from that.

Thank you.

MR0 CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Graves.
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRIERSON M. GRAVES, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE PETITIONERS
MR. GRAVES:

I have one sentence.

I agree with Justice Marshall that everyone complains
about the amount of the utility bill, so it is a question of
whether it is a dispute or not.

And we say by our notice to

come: to the credit department, that we established a hearing
procedure because the evidence was that our credit counselors
usually have 15 to 20 years of service and are competent
people, and so they would bo the ones, and you need 10 or
12 or 15 people because we have 235,000 electric customers
and we fee'1 that establishing that initial contact -- and the
Crafts waited until they had the notice and their utilities
had been terminated and then they came and they got help and
advice by telling them, "Combine your meters.
you on a budget payment."

Vie will put

And it wasn’t double billing, but

split billing because they got the service through each meter.
QUESTION:

That doesn’t solve the problem which

seems to be hanging in air, whether their due process rights,

such as the Sixth Circuit has outlined, are satisfied if they
don't get the answer they like?
tyKo GRAVES:

Your Honor, I don't think that

everybody gets the answer they like about utility bills
in this because I think a utility could not compromise and
give away the utilities just on the basis of settling it,
that they would have to attempt to charge what was reasonably
said- by the meter to the person.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.
