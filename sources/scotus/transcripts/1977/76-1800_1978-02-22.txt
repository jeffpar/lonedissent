MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next ir: 76-1800. United States v. Onofre J. and Naomi Sotelo.
Mr. Smith, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This federal income tax and bankruptcy case comes
here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.

It presents the question of

whether the statutory liability equal to unpaid taxes withheld
from employees’ wages,which is imposed by section 6672 of the
Internal Revenue Code, upon persons who are required to collect
and pay over such taxes but who willfully failed to dc so is
dischargeable under section 17 of the Bankruptcy Act.
We submit that this liability is not dischargeable
and that the Court of Appeals erred in so holding.
The facts are relatively simple and undisputed.

On

June 26, 1973, Onofre J. Sotelo and Son, Masonry, Inc., a
corporation, was adjudicated a bankrupt.

The president of this

corporation was respondent Onofre J. Sotelo, and the secretary
of the corporation was his wife Naomi.
About ten days later, on July 5th, Onofre J. Sotelo
and Naomi Sotelo were adjudicated bankrupts themselves and

4
their cases were thereafter consolidated in the Bankruptcy
Court.

Later that year, in November, the government filed a

claim in the individual bankruptcy cases for unpaid withhold­
ing taxes amounting to $40,000.
to $32,000.

This claim was later reduced

The claim was based upon section 6672 of the

Internal Revenue Code, and which I have referred to as impos­
ing a statutory liability on so-called responsible officers
of a corporatior, who are required to collect withholding taxes
and pay them over but who willfully failed to do so.
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, what section is it that re­

quires the responsible officers to collect?

I agree, that.

667 2 .imposes a penalty upon those who are required to collect,
but. I am curious to know what section it is that requires them
to collect.
MR. SMITH:

Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, section

667 1(b) defines a person as using the subchapter which includes
an officer or employee of a corporation, and section 3402 of
the: Coda, which we set forth at page 3a of the appendix of our
brief, says "as otherwise provided in this section, every
employer making payment of wages shall deduct and withhold
f

upon such wages a tax determined in accordance with tables
prescribed by the Secretary."

So the requirement .is that

these are statutory — Onofre J. Sotelo was a person under
the Code and the employer was the corporation and he acted on
behalf of the corporation, and he was required to collect and

5
pay over these taxes as prescribed —
QUESTION:

You say those two sections together not

only require the; employer to pay but makes one in Sotelo’s
position responsible for paying over them?
MR. SMITH:
6 6'72

Yes, and that if he fails to pay, section

—

QUESTION:

I agree with that.

Do you think your

first proposition is crystal clear?
MR. SMITH:

I think so, because he is acting- on be­

half of the employer.

It says every employer making payment

of wages, the corporations act through their officers and
under section 6671 (b) the term "person" includes an officer or
employee of a corporation or a member or employee of a partner­
ship, et cetera, et cetera.

I think that is clear, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist.

<
QUESTION:

Perhaps it has already been covered in

this colloquy, but is it not clear that the statute requires
the; employer to withhold the employee’s portion from payment
of social security taxes, for example, or withholding, and
thc.t if he fails to do it, the employer is responsible?
MR. SMITH:

That’s right.

That's right.

If he

fails —
QUESTION:

Congress has made the employer the tax

collector, has he not?
MR. SMITH:

Exactly.

And if the employer, as in this

6

case, the typical situation where section 6672 liability
arises, is where the employer is a corporation which goes
bankrupt and it no longer has assets to pay and then Congress
has determined that the collection agent, the responsible
collection agent who made the decision to willfully prefer
otter creditors over the United States, he becomes personally
liable for these taxes.

In fact, in the Bankruptcy Court in

this case, there was a trial as to whether Onofre J. Sotelo
and/or Naomi Sotelo were responsible officers under section
6672, and the trial judge found that Onofre was a responsible
officer but not Naomi Sotelo, and that is undisputed, that he
is a responsible officer and that he has this liability.
The assets of the bankruptcy estate ware insufficient
to satisfy the government* s tax claim.

The government there­

upon levied on a $10,000 fund that had been set aside outside
the bankruptcy estate as Onofre J. Sotelo* s homestead exemp­
tion. under Illinois law, and Onofre J. Sotelo objected to the
levy on the grounds that the homestead exemption belonged to
his wife Naomi and not himself.

He also argued — and that is

the question before the Court — that the section 6672
liability for unpaid withholding taxes was a dischargeable
compensatory penalty rather than a tax and that his half of
acquired property should be insulated from collection.
QUESTION;

Strictly speaking, is the 5672 liability

a trx liability or a liability for somethin equivalent to the

7
amount of the tax?

The reason I ask, following up on Justice

Rehnquist5s question, is that section 3403 describes the
person's liable for the tax and it only identifies the employer
The employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax re­
quired to be withheld, and so forth.
MR. SMITH:

I think what that is is that section 3403

provides that the employer shall be liable for the payment of
the tax in the first instance, but that section 667 2 pjrovides
for backup liability when the employer doesn't pay the tax.
We have argued at length in our brief that
QUESTION:

The question I suppose is whether the

backup liability is a strictly speaking tax liability.
MR. SMITH:

I think it is a tax liability, although

that is —

QUESTIgw;
MR. SMITH:

That is a penalty.
Congress used the tern "penalty" but the

authorities apart from the decision below in this case are
unanimous in not only two circuits but all the district courts
and they treat and describe this as a tax liability.
QUESTION:

Had this question arisen prior to 1966

when section 17 was amended?
MR. SMITH:

This question had arisen prior to 1966

in cases like the Sherwood case, which we c.ite in our brief,
the Eastern District of New York case, and the court had held
that this was a tax liability and not a penalty.

But that is

8

an alternative.

I want to emphasize that that is an alterna-'

tive argument that we made.

We think that our primary argument

in this case is that this liability is not dischargeable under
section 17 (a) (1) (e) of the Bankruptcy Act which was added to
section 17 in 1966.
But before I mention that, I just want to briefly
summarize what the courts below
QUESTION:

Does the Code also say that the penalty

shell be levied and assessed like taxes?
SMITH:

MR. SMITH;

MR. SMITH:

Like taxes, yes.
So they are to be treated as taxes?
They are treated like taxes,

6671(a).

In fact, the Second Circuit, in

Botta v. Scanlon, has held that they are subject to the AntiInjunction Act.

Which defines taxes in a different way,

doesn’t it, than the Code?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

The Anti-Injunction Act?
You can't carry over the Second Circuit

MR. SMITH;

Well, but I think it is persuasive* just

as Mr. Justice White has said.

These things are always

treated as taxes and the Internal Revenue Service endeavors to
make sure that these things are only collected once when the

9
i

corporation fails.
officer.

They are only collected once from the

I don't think that there is any doubt that the way

they are treated administratively and the wsiy the courts have
regarded them.

They are always treated as taxes, notwithstand

ing the penalty.
QUESTION:

Section 6671 says any reference in this

title to tax imposed with this title shall be deemed also to
refer to the penalties and liabilities.
MR. SMITH:

Penalties and liabilities imposed by the

sufcchapter, that’s right.

That's right.

But I would submit

-- and I don't want to belabor the point, because I think it
is covered in our brief — that despite the penalty denomina­
tion, these things are always treated as taxes and the courts
apart from this Court have so held.
QUESTION;

Mr. Smith, tell me the basis for your

statement that the Internal Revenue Service collects only once
as a matter of policy.
MR. SMITH;

Is there —
The basis of our statement for that is

an opinion, a policy statement which we cite at page 30 of our
brief, Policy Statement P-5-60.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Subject to change tomorrow.
What?
Subject to change tomorrow.
Well, quite frankly, I have been working

in this area for quite a while and I have never heard of any

10

instance where the Internal Revenue Service has attempted to
collect section 6672 liability more than once.
QUESTION:

No, but you have heard of many instances

where the Internal Revenue Service changes its mind.
MR, SMITH:

Oh, absolutely, but I cannot -- it is

hard for me to imagine changing its mind in this context when
given the authorities which have held it is a tax rendered at
the urging of the government.
In any event, the Bankruptcy Court held that the
section 6672 liability was non-dischargeable under section 17
of the Bankruptcy Act, and the District Court affirmed„
Court of Appeals reversed.

The

It held that section 17 a (1)(e),

which is our primary argument before the Court today, was not
applicable, and it also held that the liability was a penalty
and not a tax.
I want to begin by referring the Court to section
17a(1)(e) because I think that its terms are explicit and
cover this case.

The pertinent language is set forth at pages

5a and going over to 6a of the Appendix to our brief.

The be­

ginning of section 17, the basic discharge provision, says, "A
discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of
his provable debts whether allowable in full, in part, except
as such” —- and then there is an exception for taxes.

And

then it goes or. to say, "Provided, however; that a discharge
in bankruptcy shall not release a bankrupt from any taxes" —

and then if the Court will turn over to page 6a and pick up at
subsection (e)

"which the bankrupt has collected or withheld

from others as required by the laws of the United States or any
State or political subdivision thereof, but has not paid ever,"
QUESTION:

Tell me again your answer to the question

of where yon find the source of the requirement that the bank­
rupt who is an officer and not the taxpayer pay over?
MR. SMITH:

Well, the bankrupt in the first instance

QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, before you tell us about the

13
Treasury Department's objections to the 1966 legislation, why
don't you tell us what the purpose of the 1966 amendment was?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

The purpose of the 1966 amendment ■—
The entire amendment, I mean.
The entire amendment was as follows:

It

was to introduce a statute of limitations -- section 17a
before 1966 —
QUESTION:

Wasn't it to ameliorate the harsh rule

against the individual that had to pay and has had a nondischargeable tax obligation regardless of how old it was?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

That was part of it.

That was

It was in order to protect the individual

taxpayer.
MR. SMITH:

That xvas part of it.

Congress was inter­

ested in providing a statute of limitations for stale tax
claims in bankruptcy, because before 1966 tax claims were not
dischargeable and they were forever subject to collection.
QUESTION:

And that was inequitable to individuals

but not to corporations because corporations were —
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION s

Corporations —
— and it was to provide protection to

individuals, to bankrupt individuals.
MR. SMITH:

Exactly, and that, Mr. Justice Stevens,

that was introduced in section 17a(1) because it says 'except
suci' as taxes which became legally due and owing by the bankrupt

14
to the United States or any State or subdivision thereof within
three years preceding bankruptcy. tr
But there was another purpose in adding section 17a(1)(e).

The Treasury Department was terribly concerned about

mounting delinquencies in trust fund taxes, because it properly
pointed out to the pertinent committees that there was an
inequity in giving a bankrupt a discharge for failure to pay
— not to pay his own taxes but for failure to keep intact
money which he had obtain©! from others as a trustee for the
government.
In 1953, Congress felt that a criminal penalty would
suffice, and they enacted section 7202 of the Code to provide
for a criminal penalty for willfully failing to pay these
trust fund taxes over.
QUESTION:

The point is --

To expressly identify the problem, the

problem was they collected the money from third persons and
converted such monies to their own use, wasn't that —
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
ME. SMITH:

Exactly.
Well, that didn't happen here, did it?
Of course, it happened here because what

happened here was that the employees were paid net wages and
the corporation benefited from the fact that it did not pay
the withholding taxes over.
QUESTION:

It is not the corporation’s liability

that we are dealing with here.

15

MR. SMITH:

Exactly, but then by operation of the

statutory provisions in the Code, 6671(b) and 667 2, this
liability becomes Onofre J„ Sotelo's liability, and the point
is —
QUESTION:

But did Onofre J. Sotelo convert these

funds to his own personal use?
MR. SMITH:

In the sense that he contributed them —

I mean that the funds were contributed or remained in the
corporation which he ran
QUESTIONs

Is that the normal use -- is that the

normal way you think of a corporate officer converting corpor­
ate: assets to his own use?
MR. SMITH:

In the sense that his business was able

to continue to use these funds would seem to me to be a —
QUESTlON %
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

His own use?
The corporation's ow use.
Mr. Smith, you say that 6671(b) on page

4a of your brief, it is the provision you rely on that imposes
liability upon a corporate officer to pay taxes that are owed
by the corporation, and yet that, as I read it, simply says it
includes an officer or employee of a corporation or a member
or employee of a partnership who is under a duty to perform
the act.

In other words, it speaks the same way 6672 does.

Both of then speak of people who are already under a duty.

I

still want to know where is Sotelo's original duty to pay taxes

16
on behalf of a corporation arise frcm?
KIR. SMITH:

His original duty to pay taxes on behalf

of the corporation arises as the principal officer of the
employer.
QUESTION:

Well,, what provision of the statute tells

MR. SMITH:

Well, 3402, if you turn back a page, and

us that?

3403, say that every employer making payment of wages, and
then says the taxvoloyer shall be liable.
QUESTION:

Now --

Well, the employer here is the corporation

and it was not Sotelo.
MR. SMITH:

Exactly, the corporations are legal

entities, they have co operate through their principal —
through people.
QUESTION:

Well, then you are not relying on any

specific Code language?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION;
MR. SMITH:

No.

1 think ~

You are relying on common 1aw?
The case law is clear that .in fixing 667 2

liability they look to the person who was responsible, who —
QUESTION:

Who would be responsible in a common law

sense?
MR. SMITH:

In a common law situation to make the de­

cisions, and,here that was Onofre.

The Bankruptcy Court found

that that was Onofre J. Sotelo, and there is no dispute about

17
that.
We submit that there was no dispute that he was a
person required to collect, turthfully account for and pay
over the withholding taxes, and he collected those taxes by
paying net -wages to his corporation's employees.

And in our

view he is a bankrupt who has collected or withheld taxes from
others, as required by the laws of the United States, but who
has not paid them over within section 17a(1)(e).
Now, I think that it is not without significance that

her.

You are right.

If you

have all the money in the world and you just decide you are not
going to pay withholding taxes, of course, you are going to be
personally liable, assuming that the corporation then goes
bankrupt

20

I do want to point out to the Court that it is not
without significance that the current Congress — I understand
that the views of one Congress can't be attributed to another
strictly# but that the current Congress regards as settled
that section 17a(l)(e) renders the section 667 2 liability nondischargeable.

There is a massive codification of the bank­

ruptcy bill# which has just passed the House and which is being
considered by the Senate, and at page 22 refers to a 1977
committee report which I would like to quote.

It is very

short.
It says:

"The current Bankruptcy Act renders non-

discharge able all taxes which the bankrupt has collected or
withheld from others but has not paid over.

Thus, withholding

taxes are accorded an unlimited priority under present law.
The priority even includes the 100 percent ’penalty6 imposed
under the Internal Revenue Code.

The present unlimited pri­

ority is justified by the notion that withholding taxes are
held in trust."
In other words, the same rationale that the Treasury
pressed Congress in the mid-1960's, that a bankrupt should not
benefit from his failure to honor the statutory trust of these
trust fund taxes.
QUESTION:

But that wouldn't answer the question of

ir Onofre Sotelo himself is subject to 6672 liability,
would it?

21
MR. SMITH:

It wouldn't answer the question, but that

question was not in this case because 'it is assumed that
QUESTION:

"Assumed'1' is a good word for it.

MR. SMITH:

It is given,,

I mean the lower courts

have held, and Sotelo does not contend to the contrary,, that
he is subject to section 6672 liability.
whether it is dischargeable.

The questior

is

I think the current Congress re­

gards — it is settled that section 17a(1)(e) was designed to
not only reach as the corporate bankrupt, because, as we point
out, Congress recognized that in liquidating bankrupty, the
corporation disappears.

So it would have been rather futile

to enact section 17a(l)(e)

in order to preserve trust fund tax

liabilities post-bankruptcy.
QUESTION:

Why do you say a corporation "disappears"

in a liquidating bankruptcy?
MR, SMITH:

Well, my understanding is that a corpor­

ation that liquidates and goes out of existence in a liquidating
bankruptcy and distributes all its assets constitutes itself
unier different ownership is a different entity.
QUESTION:

Well, if it goes out of existence, it

goes out of existence.
MR. SMITH:

But what if it doesn't?
Well, if it doesn't go out of existence,

then

MR. SMITH:

MR. SMITH:

I think Congress recognizes that in
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

In many instances bankrupts die, too.
Oh, absolutely.

But what Congress was

interested in was making sure of enhancing the Treasury's op­
portunity to collect these trust fund taxes freon either the
corporation, if it didn't disappear, or from the responsible
officer because of his statutory liability which we submit
does not disappear upon bankruptcy and is nondischargeable.
QUESTION:

There is nothing in the bankruptcy law

that prevents the Alpha Delta Realty Company, a bankrupt, after
it has turned over all its assets, from getting a new board of
directors and keeping right on as the Alpha Delta Realty
Company, is there?
MR. SMITH:

Oh, no, I don't mean to suggest that

every corporation that undergoes bankruptcy disappears.

But as

we point out in our brief, Congress observed that although a
corporate bankrupt theoretically is not discharged, the corporation normally ceases to exist upon bankruptcy and unsatis­
fied tax claims as well as all other unsatisfied claims are
without further recourse even though the enterprise —

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

24
Court :
On behalf of the respondents, Onofre J. Sotelo and
Naomi Sotelo, we submit that the section 6572 penalty is an
obligation that is dischargeable in. the personal bankruptcy of
the individual against whom it is assessed.

In reaching a

conclusion on this issue —
QUESTION:

Could I just ask you, is there any ques­

tion about the validity of the claim in the bankruptcy?
MR. BALCH:

There is no question, Your Honor.

That

was determined at the bankruptcy level and neither side appeal­
ed from it, neither side was happy with it because the govern­
ment wanted more and Sotelo wanted less, but I believe we have
to take it as a fact at this point.
QUESTION:

But you don’t now contest that Sotelo owes

the money, owed the money to the -MR. BALCH:

I don’t contest that, Your Honor.

That

was the very next thing I was going to say, that in reaching a
decision on this case, it is important to distinguish between
the concept of liability and the concept of dischargeability.
QUESTION:

In any event, he owed the money and if

there had been money to distribute in the estate at 50 cents
on the dollar, 50 cents on the dollar would at least have gone
to the United States?
MR. 'BALCH:

Your Honor, I wish to make the point

that this, was an asset case, the government filed and proved a

25
claim in the personal bankruptcy, that claim was allowed for a
substantial sum, the government obtained a dividend from the
personal assets»
QUESTION:
MR. BALCH:

Thanks very much,
However , those assets were not sufficient

to pay the claim in full and that is what brings us here.
QUESTION:

All right.

QUESTION:

You began with some discussion about

section 6672 liability, but I am not sure you finished your
sentence.
MR. BALCH:
QUESTION:
MR.

BALCH:

Thank you, Your Honor.
Would you give me that again?
I wanted to make the distinction between

the liability under section 6672 and its dischargeability, and
I am careful arid I hope I don't slip, have a slip of the tongue
somewhere in this discussion and, heaven forbid, call that a
tax.
I call it an obligation.
penalty

It is an obligation for a

and we say that it is considerably different than the

obligation for a tax.

And the importance of that distinction

bee canes apparent when we go on to look at section 17a (1) of the
Bankruptcy Act.
Now, a right to a discharge in bankruptcy is a rather
sweeping privilege that Congress has extended to all bankrupts,
and you start our with a general rule that a discharge in

26
bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable
debts whether allowable in full or in part, except such as are
-- and then there are some exceptions.
Now, we point out that the facts relate in this case,
that at the government’s instance, a claim was proved in the
personal bankruptcy, it was allowed in part and therefore we
squarely come within the general rule that this claim is a
dischargeable claim and therefore releases the bankrupt from
all of his provable debts, and so forth.
Now, if we are to say that one of the exceptions ap­
plies here, we say that the general rule of statutory construc­
tion is that one who asserts an exception to a recognized gen­
eral rule has the burden of showing that you come within the
exception, and ws feel we have clearly shown we come within
the general rules, so let's examine the exceptions and see if
the government lias met this burden of coming within one of
them.
Now, the primary exception that the government relies
upon in this case is the exception in 17a{1} which excepts
taxes.

So we are then met with the question what is the nature

of the obligation under section G672.
Well,
section 6672.

the first place to look, I would suggest, is
What characterization did Congress itself put

upon this obligation when they wr'ote section 6672?

They say

that certain people who are defined in that section — and we

27
concede that Sotelo is one of than — shall in addition to
other penalties provided by law be liable to a penalty.

Now,

clearly they are talking penalty.

They do not say that the

individual is liable for the tax.

This is not a tax on Nr.

Sotelo.

He did not file any returns.

identification number in this capacity.

lie didn’t have a tax
The corporation was

liable for the tax, and if the corporation —
QUESTION:

There are provisions in the federal tax

laws making certain parties secondarily liable for a tax, are
there not?
MR. BALCII:

That is correct, Your Honor, and I would

say this is one of them.
QUESTION:

Like — you say this is not one of them —

like the donee for a gift tax is secondarily liable for the
gift, tax, at least that used to be the law.
MR. BALCII:
QUESTION:
MR. BALCII:
QUESTION:

Oh, transferee liability?
Transferee liability.
Yes, Your Honor.
That is secondary liability for the tax.

But here«your point is that this is not secondary liability for
a tax but rather a penalty.
MR. BALCII:

Thank you for correcting my slip of the

tongue there. Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, in other words, if Congress knows

how to say secondary liability for a tax, it does know how to

I

28
say so, because it has said so in certain instances.
MR. BALCH:

That is correct.

They have made it very

clear in other contexts that if they want the individual to be
directly liable as a taxpayer -—
QUESTION;
MR. BALCH;

Or secondarily liable for a tax.
Correct.

They can say that.

I don't

think they said it in section 6672.
QUESTION:

What do you think is the significance in

the; very context that you are just discussing of the language
"shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be
liable to a penalty equal to the total amount of the tax
evaded"?

Doesn’t this language equate the tax and the penalty?
MR. BALCH:

That languacje, Your Honor, shows to the

person enforcing this section how the amount of the penalty is
calculated.

But I don't think it changes •—

QUESTION:
MR. BALCH:
QUESTION:
MR. BALCH:

Doesn't it make it all one?
What?
Doesn’t it make it one and the same thing?
No, Your Honor.

They could have just as

well left out the words "a penalty equal to the" and that is
one of the points we wish to make, that in construing the
statute, if there are two possible ways to look at it, the
preferred way is the way that gives meaning to each of the
words that are in there.

And if you construe it as simply

saying a direct liability for the tax, you are rendering

29
meem trig less the words "a penalty equal to the»"
QUESTION:

Can it not be read as saying that Congress

intended that one way or another we are going to get this tax,
we are going to get this tax which was in trust and held in
trust and for these purposes we may call it a penalty?
MR. BALCH:

Your Honor, that brings me back to my

primary point at the very outset, and that was we must be
careful to distinguish between liability and dischargeability.
The point that Your Honor's question makes is that Congress
wanted this person liable for this amount of money.
QUESTION:
MR. BALCH:

And non-dischargeable?
No, dischargeability is the issue to be

decided today.
QUESTION:
MR. BALCH:
QUESTION:

Yes, I know.
We are past the point of liability.
Yes.

And doesn't this language — isn't

this .Language directed at dischargeability?
MR. BALCH:

I would say, Your Honor, chat if we can

ascribe any motive at all to why they worded it in this rather
peculiar fashion, I would say that it was put in there to show
that -chare was sane difference between the nature of this
liability and the nature of a direct liability for the tax.
QUESTION:

What about the provision of 5671(a) that

says that except as otherwise provided, any reference in this
title to a tax shall be deemed to include the penalties?

Nov;,

30

if you concede that a liability for a penalty, if you look at
the Code, it says you treat penalties like taxes.

Now, you

say that may be so for purposes of the Code but not for pur­
poses of bankruptcy?
MR. BJvLCH:

Your Honor has asked the question and

then has answered it, because the section just cited refers in
its operation to a particular title, and that is the whole
problem with the approach of the government to this case and
our approach.

They are looking at this as a tax case, and

it is a bankruptcy case.
QUESTION:

I suppose in knowing what the bankruptcy

law should consider a tax for purposes of dischargeability, it
makes soma sense to look to the Code to see what a tax is.
MR. 3ALCH:
QUESTION:

The Code in certain situations -And the Code says that this penalty is a

tax.
MR. QALCH:
QUESTION:
6671?

Well, we dispute that point, Your Honor.
Well, what else does that mean there in

It says — 6671(a) — "The reference in this title to a

tax shall be deemed also to refer to
MR. BALCII:

penalties.”

That section 6671 (a), Your Honor, is part

of a procedural group of clauses which deal with the adminis­
trative matters as to how penalties are collected.

What they

are saying is that such things as levy and seizure and the
forms and so forth, that you don’t have to — they don’t have

31
to enact a whole separate body of material for the purpose of
collecting a penalty.

Now, the name of that subsection is

"Penalty Assessed as Tax."

Now, assessment is a highly tech­

nical tax word that refers to the matter of how liability is
established for various things and how the government actually
can get the money, but it doesn't go to the question of how you
characterize things for the purpose of determining discharge
in bankruptcy, which is in another section, and that section
Your Honor just quoted refers to things like this subchapter
and this title.
QUESTION:

What if an individual is assessed, a de­

ficiency and then a civil penalty is also imposed under the
Coda, and there is no question about either the tax or the
penalty, that it is valid, and the bank goes into bankruptcy,
is the tax non-dischargeable but the penalty is?

Is that what

%

you are suggesting?
MR. BALCH:

Well, Your Honor, the question of whether

civil penalties are dischargeable, other types of civil penal­
ties is not something that either side covered in this material
art

it is another area which frankly I have not prepared for,

re sear ched tod ay.
QUESTION:
MR. BALCH:

All right.
That may go to the question of whether

the —
QUESTION:

It might help you.

It might help you.

MR. BALCH:

Well, I appreciate that,- Your Honor.

The question of other civil penalties would go then
to whether or not they are provable or allowable at all, and
then once you get over the hurdle of whether they areprovable
and allowable, then that gives rise to the matter of —
QUESTION:

This one happens to have been provable

and allowable and was allowed.
MR. B/iLCH:
to our point

Yes, and we feel that that gives strength

that under section 17a of the Bankruptcy Act,

once you have a claim that is proved and allowable, you pre­
sumptively have a right to discharge to it unless you can
clearly show that it comes within one of the statutory excep­
tions of the Bankruptcy Act.
QUESTION:

Well, do you suggest that, taken as a.

whole, this entire statutory scheme does not indicate intent by
Congress that when an employer collects money from the
employees by withholding it and then doesn't turn it over to
the government, in the meantime having held it as a trustee,
that Congress intended to make it as difficult as possible to
have that be a dischargeable obligation?
MR. BALCH:

I think Congress has made it a non-

dischargeable obligation as to the employer-bankrupt corpora­
tion, but I don’t think they have gone so far as to say that
after they have taken all the corporate assets, gone on and
taken all of the individual's personal assets, that they then

33

have hanging over his head for the rest of his life a nondischargeable obligation that can be used to confiscate every­
thing and anything that he ever will come to have in the
future.
QUESTION:

Well, realistically we know that this

kind of a problem doesn't arise with General Motors or the
du Pont Company, at any rate.

It is more likely to arise with

small businesses, is that not a realistic factor?
MR. BALCHs

Well, Your Honor, I would respectfully

suggest that wTe have had in this country some very substantial
corporations that have gone bankrupt, and when they do, and
if their payroll clerk or vice president for financial affairs
finds himself on. the wrong end of a personal liability for
millions of dollars, that means he has lost everything he has
ever worked for.

But I don't think it means that he is in a

condition of perpetual bondage to the government for the rest
of his life for all of his after acquired earnings above the
meager statutory exemption that the Code provides.
QUESTION:

You don't think Congress viewed this as

something in the nature of an embezzlement in the totality of
the statute itself and its legislative history?
MR. BALCH:

Well, Your Honor, there is a separate

exception in the Bankruptcy Act for embezzlement.

If the

person had taken the money for his own personal use, you would
have a different kind of a situation and a separate, independent

34
ground for objecting to discharge on it, and I believe Justice
Stevens pursued that point with the Solicitor General as to
whether he had taken it for his own use.

I don’t consider

this type of financial difficulty a taking for the person’s
own use.
QUESTION:

Well, what section of 17 did the govern­

ment rely on, or does it?
MR.

BALCH:

I think they are relying on 17a(1}

which

excepts taxes.
QUESTION:
MR. BALCH;

And specifically 17a(l)(e), right?
There are two — I don’t want to make

the government’s argument for them, but I think that they have
two theories.

One is that it is an exception because it is a

tax, and then there is a separate subparagraph within the tax
exception that deals with withheld taxes.
QUESTION:

Right.

QUESTION:

Isn't one of the difficulties that the

Seventh Circuit faced and we face here that you are basically
dealing with the Internal Revenue Code, which is one federal
set of statutes, and a Bankruptcy Code, which is another entire
set of statutes?
MR.

BALCH:

That is exactly what it is, Your Honor.

You have liability and dischargeability.
liability*

The Code imposes

The Bankruptcy Act creates a relief of discharge-

ability, and that is the whole difficulty with the position of

35

the Internal Revenue Service in this matter.

They are trying

to transplant concepts from the Internal Revenue Code, which
is a statute designed to impose liability and facilitate
collection, as it ought to do, and they are trying to transplant
those into the Bankruptcy Act.

But each of these statutes

v/as enacted for its own peculiar purposes and each has to be
interpreted in light of its own function.
Now, the Internal Revenue Code, as a liability and
collection matter, is interpreted in a certain way, but the
Bankruptcy Act is amelioratory relief provisions which deal
with the fair distribution of assets and the discharge of
bankrupt debtors.

And I don’t consider it a conflict between

th2 two, I think it is completely harmonious with our entire
philosophy, that on one hand we want these things to be paid,
but on the other hand, when you have taken all the corporate
assets and all the personal assets, there comes a point where
we say to the individual he. is free to start over again,- and
I think we have reached that point here.
QUESTION:

Is the claim that was filed and allowed

by the United States in the record?
MR. B \.LCH:

I believe it is, Your Honor, or at least

it is referred to in the docket entry that is reproduced in
the gov ernmen t ’ ;s br ie f.

MR. BALCH;

a finding that she was not liable.
QUESTION:
MR. BALCH:

Of course, as to the homestead exemption?
Well, that was an issue that was —* the

homestead exemption was an issue at the bankruptcy judge level
but rot at this time in this Court.
QUESTION:
MR. EALCH:

I see.
Now, many lower courts have passed

on

this issue and they have concluded that it is non-dischargeable.

But I would like to point out that when you

see cill

these lower court opinions that have been collected in these
briefs and where they come from, every one of them

can be

traced back to the case of

axe all

Botta v. Scanlon.

They

spawned by Botta v. Scanlon.
QUESTION:

And that was an Anti-Injunction 2\ct case,

wasn't it?
MR. BALCH:

That is correct. Your Honor.

Botta v.

Scanlon was an attempt by some individuals to get an injunction
against the government from collecting the 6672 penalty against
them, and that involved construing the Anti-Injunction Act
presently found in section 7421(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code.

Now, that statute prohibits injunctions against the

37
collection of tax, but there the Court referred to this section
6671(a)

that has already been questioned by a number of the

Justices, and that says that for the purpose of the Internal
Revenue Code, penalties are collected like taxes.

So the

Botta court correctly holds, I will concede, the Botta court
correctly held that for the purpose of the Anti-Injunction Act,
a penalty is equivalent to a tax and therefore an individual
cannot get an injunction against the collection of a 6672
penalty.
But the ex tent ion of the Botta doctrine eg cite
bankruptcy context is completely beyond anything that was said
in Botta; there is no equivalent to section 6671(a) in the
Bankruptcy Act.

That is purely an Internal Revenue Code

there is no equivalent in the Bankruptcy Act.

make some sense out of it, isn't that our problem?
MR. BALCH:
QUESTION:

I would say that is your duty, YoUr Honor.
You mean the same Congress that has been

sifting since 1789?
MR'. BALCH;

I don’t think that section 6672 has been

0

there for a long time.

It has been reenacted repeatedly, as

the Internal Revenue Code has been reenacted, and I think this
one probably goes back to the 1954 Code.
QUESTION:

But certainly the same Congress in a

33
literal sense, the 94th versus the 95th —MR. BALCH:

No,

in that sense, I think it is a dif­

ferent Congress.

MR. BALCH:

I think in the circumstances involved

that that wouldn't have mattered, because it v/ould have gotten
the personal assets either way.
QUESTION:

They would have priority either way, you

think?

QUESTION:

Well, what about the last sentence of

section 17, "And provided further that a discharge in bankruptcy
shall not release or affect any tax lien"?
MR. BALCH:
QUESTION:
MR. BALCHs
QUESTION:

Any tax lien.
Yes.
The purpose of that -All I am suggesting is that the people

drafting the taxing statutes were not unaware of the Bankruptcy
Act.
MR. BALCH:

The section that says it won't affect

the tax lien simply goes to the point that if the government
claim, has reached a lien step on a particular piece of
property, and if that tax for which they have a lien is one of
the class of taxes that can be discharged under section 17,
that oven though personal liability is discharged, that the
government still retains its lien on that piece of property.
That is all that that is there for, and I don't, think that
goes to the question of the discharge of personal liability,
which is the matter that is before the Court.
QUESTION:

The purpose of my question was to suggest

that there was an awareness by Congress of the interaction be­
tween the Bankruptcy Act and the Revenue Code.
MR. BALCH:

I would think that in their workings

they were each, each, of the committees that worked on this was
aware of the fact that there was another statute, that the

42
bankruptcy people know there is a Revenue Code, and the
Revenue Code people know there is a Bankruptcy Act.

But as to

how you harmonize them, I would say the words of the statute
lead to the result that we request, regardless of the timing
of the particular enactments.
Now, as a policy matter, I would like to conclude by
pointing out that you have got a potential horrendous result
here, that the liability that is non-dischargeable, a.* the
government asserts, is totally unrelated to any assets that
this individual has personally or ever could have.

It. is not

like the other non-dischargeahle taxes where there has been
some relationship between the tax base, as it were, whether it
is inccane, property, or otherwise, and the .amount of the tax.
If, let's say, a person who is an officer of a very
large corporation, his liability can be inflated by the fact
that the enterprise has capital contributed to it from many,
many shareholders and has no relationship to his own personal
net worth or anything that he ever could acquire in the future.
QUESTION:

In other words, the bookkeeper of

3.

big

contracting company which went bankrupt — and they go bankrupt
fairly frequently, and they are big companies — and the
bookkeeper would have this secondary liability, this penalty
liability, and if she or he went bankrupt, that might be a
4

million dollars and would be, if it is non-dischargeable,
she would be in bondage for the rest of her life.

43
MR. BALCHI am saying they take her house and her
car, but that is as far as they go; that if she then gets
another job as a bookkeeper with another company, she can make
$100 a week and keep it.
QUESTION:

In this case, what percentage of the

stock of the corporation did respondent own?
MR. BALCH:

Your Honor, I came into the case after,

long after the corporation was bankrupt and I don't have that.

QUESTION:

I don't believe so.

44
Mow, we concede that under the Constitution, Congress
has the power to compel the result that the government has
argued tor»

They can decide what is dischargeable and what is

not dischargeable, and if they want to explicitly say that
this kind of a claim is non-dischargeable , that is within their
power.

But we don't think that statutory construction should

be used to create a situation which amounts to peonage on this
kind of liability.
Ours is a country where the private risk of capital
is admired and encouraged.

But when that capital has been

risked and lost? we are also a country that says that you can
mate a fresh start, free and clear of these previous claims.
Mow, we ask that this Court affirm the Seventh Cir­
cuit based on the reasoning contained in their opinion, that
where, they have made a clear distinction between the corpora­
tion as an employer and Mr. Sotelo personally as an employeeofficer of that corporation, and we ask that this Court
specifically hold that the penalty assessed against an individual under section 667 2 .is the kind of obligation that is
discharged by the personal bankruptcy of that individual.
QUESTION:

Isn't the concept of accountability for

property held in trust approximately on the same parity with
the broad doctrine you have just suggested about a fresh
start?
MR. BALCH

I believe it applies only if the

45
individual, as an individual, is the trustee, and there is one
of the other exceptions in the list of exceptions in section
17a of the Bankruptcy Act, is a defalcation by a person in a
fiduciary capacity.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER-REBUTTAL
MR. SMITH:

A few points, Mr. Chief Justice.

I want to just focus briefly on some of the grounds
of the Court of Appeals decision, apart from this corporation
shareholder problem which we think the gap is filled by section
6671(b) and section 6572? in other 'words, Onofre J. Sotelo was
a person required to truthfully collect, account for and pay
over, and we think the statutory gap is filled and that his
liability — that he is a bankrupt within the meaning of
section 17a (I) (•.:).
But the Court of Appeals also held within the context
of our section 17a(1)(e) argument that it was not applicable
because it refers to taxes, and this is a penalty.

And I think we

have argued, ano I think it has been explored at great, length
that we think that this is a tax and not a penalty.

cf section 17a(1) , these funds were undisputably taxes at. the

time they were collected or withheld from others within the
