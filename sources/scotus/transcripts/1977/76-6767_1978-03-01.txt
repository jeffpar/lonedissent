JUSTICE BURGER:

Vie will hear arguments

next in 76-6767, ocott ana Thurmon against united states.
Mr. Shorter.
URAL, ARGUMENT UP JuHN A. SHORTER, JR., ESC.
UN BERA LF UP THE PETITIONER
MR. oHuRTBR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The minimization provision of Title 3 of the Omnibus
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 provides that every
order and extension thereof, authorizing electronic surveillance
shall contain a provision that the authorization to intercept
shall be conducted in such a way as to minimize the interception
of communications not otherwise subject to interception under
this chapter.
QUESTION:

I think the Court will question counsel

to address the problem of standing, is that correct?
MR. 0H0RTER:

Yes.

There are three questions, really

before the Court in this appeal.

The first one is the meaning

and interpretation and construction of the minimization provi­
sion of the Federal wiretap statutes.
Vie feel that, specifically, the question is whether
the court below determined the correct standard and properly
applied it to the conduct of the wiretap in this case.
questions are also implicated.

Related

One is as to the scope of the

4
remedy to be applied in the event of a violation of the minimiza­
tion requirement* and that is whether full or partial suppression
of the fruits of the wiretap are to be mandated.
And thirdly* whether Petitioner Scott has standing to
assert the vioiaiiono

The standing question relates only to
i

Petitioner ccott,within the framework of the facte of this case.
There is a related petition for writ of cert also
arising from the Circuit Court opinion in this case and that is
■she petition for Chloe ilavAage»

And* of - course*, her situation on

•she question of standing is the same as that of the Petitioner
Scott.

The question of standing was fully brief in Ms.Daviage's

petition* in her brief as amicus.

And we* of course, have fully

researched and briefed the point of standing in our brief.
1 would say that* insofar as standing, we think that
the question was adequately and correctly answered by the D.C.
Circuit Court of Appeals in the Bell os 1 case, which was also an
appeal from a wiretap ruling of the District Court.

And, simil­

arly* in the early opinion of the Court of Appeals in this case
referred to as :"t>qott I."

The direct appeal in this case is

from what is referred to throughout the briefs of the partias
as "Scott II. "
In Scott I, the Circuit Court fully addressed the
question of standing* and it determined that,under the court’s
interpretation of the related provisions of Title 3.- Petitioner
A- cotfc clearly had standing to assert the violation of the

5
min ira izat ion requirement.
VJe feel that that was a correct analysis, the court's
analysis of the question was a correct one, and certainly the
court's conclusion, we feel, is amply justified by the language
of the statute which identifies 'Aggrieved person'11 as one whose
conversations are intercepted over the wiretap, and secondly,
one against whom the interception is directed,. On both points,
Petitioner Scott qualifies.
Petitioner Bcott was identified in the application for
the wiretap, that is, the affidavit of the Bureau of Narcotics
and Dangerous Drugs agent who applied for the wiretap as being
one of the principal targets.

Though the order that was entered

by the court in response to this application did not identify
Scott particularly as one of the subjects, the order said that
the wiretap was authorized to intercept the conversations of
Bernis Thurmon, Alphonso Lee, and others.
And, of course, for one to determine who the others
might be, insofar as what the record would show at that point,
there were nine persons identified in the application as being
the principal offenders,

ocott was certainly a principal target

of the investigation.
QUESTION:
me put it to you now.

Perhaps you are coming to this, but let
Once it is determined from listening that

approximately one-third of the calls relate to narcotics traffic,
doesn't that give some impetus to continuing surveillance?

6
MR. cHORTER:
a very difficult one.

The entire question of minimization is
It cannot be resolved, we feel, by refer­

ence to percentages of narcotic-related calls.
QUESTION:

Why not? If one-third of the conversations

relate to illegal traffic in narcotics, how can it not bear on
the continued surveillance?
MR, SHORTER:

We feel that the question of minimiza­

tion is related to a number of factors, the least one of which,
we would urge would be the percentage of narcotic-related calls.
For instance, it would seriously relate to who might use the
phone, whether or not there has been developed over the course
of the wiretap a pattern of clearly innocent calls between
certain people who talk on the phone.
QUESTION:

You say percentages aren't important, but

vjJhat percentage of the total calls here do you regard as un­
related to narcotics?
MR. SHORTER:

We cannot undertake an identification

in the District Court or in the Court of appeals of a percentile
breakdown.
QUESTION:

Do you challenge the Government's analysis

cf it?
MR, SHORTER:

What we relied on was the testimony of

the agent who supervised the wiretaps, that the perception of
the agents who were listening to the wiretap and the reports
that were made to him and reports that he, in turn, forwarded to

7
the attorney in charge of the wiretaps., that roughly 40% of the
calls were narcotic-related.

This was his testimony in a motion

to suppress hearing that was held in the District Court in April
of 1971«

Judge Waddy, the judge who presided at that particular

hearing,, adopted that finding.

And, as a matter of fact, he

made it the basis of the ruling that he ultimately entered sup­
pressing the wiretaps
Though there was testimony that 40% of the calls were
narcotic-related, 60% of the calls were not.

There was no effort,

absolutely no effort made on the part of any of the agents con­
ducting the wiretaps to minimise the interception of any tele­
phone calls.
QUESTION:

How ivould you go about mininizing that,

Mr. .shorter? Once you found out that 40% were clearly narcoticsrelated, 39$. were so ambiguous they couldn't tell.

How do you

minimize from there on?
MR. AHORTDR:

Well, when we say that some of the calls

were so ambiguous that you couldn’t tell what they related to,
we think that's a determination that was made by Mr. Kellog,
our adversary in the case.
The agents who compiled daily records and reports of
the calls that were being made over the telephone, using their,
own judgment, using their own instinct, referring to the logs
of the calls that they created at the time that the calls were
made, passing the information along to Mr. Cooper, the supervising

8
agent.

Mr. Cooper was reviewing their logs.

their reports.

He was reviewing

And, as the reports were going in, some days it

would be three out of six calls were narcotic-related.
it would be three out of nineteen calls.

Some day

So that at the end,,

when we total up the number of calls that ware intercepted*and,
incidentally, all of the calls on this particular telephone
were Intercepted over a 30-day period, with no effort, no phone
call ever being not recorded and not heard by the agents.

Whan

it got to the end of the line, there was some compilation that
Officer -- that Mr. Cooper testified to, and that was, "Well,
our conclusion was that 40% of the calls were narcotics-related.
That was not the issue in the case,

It wasn't a

matter of percentages* although the percentages were important
because a majority of the calls were not related, according to
the judgment of the agent,, to the narcotic enterprise.

They

were not narcotic-re la ted conversations.
Now, there were instances of calls being made over
the phone which were challenged in the District Court as being
subject to some reasonable effort at minimization.
The statute, the statute that we are talking about,
we submit, creates an affirmative duty on the part of the agents
to conduct the wiretap -- and this is the language of the
statute:

''To conduct the wiretap in a way as to minimize the

interception of calls not related to the criminal enterprise. !l
That's what the statute says* so the statute creates a

9
responsibility on the United States Attorney or the assistant
who is supervising the tap., the supervising agent and the agents
who are actually doing the intercepting»

But, even above that,

it creates a responsibility -QUESTION:

Mr» shorter, the statute doesn't say they

have to eliminate calls not related to criminal enterprise.
MR. SHORTER:
QUESTION:

Mo, it says it shall minimize.

But it doesn't use the words "not related

to criminal enterprise," "not otherwise subject to interception.
And they are subject to interception because the court author­
ized it „
MR» SHORTER:

All calls are not subject to inter­

ception »
QUEbTIoN:

All of them during the 30-day period.

It

gets a little circular, doesn't it?
MR.

mHORTER:

it seems to be that way, but clearly

we are going to use as our starting point xvhat this Court
said in Berger and what this Court said in Katz, but also use
as our starting point the overriding and compelling interest of
privacy that must govern any approach to questions of wire­
tapping.

This is an intrusion.

And the whole purpose of the

statute is to limit the intrusion.
QUESTION:

Well, it is also to authorize intrusion.

MR. .jH^RTER:

It authorizes an intrusion on a very

particularized and a very limited basis, and for very limited

10

reasons.

And the reasons are to gather evidence of criminality.

That, it seems to me, is the purpose for which the wiretap is
authorized,

The wiretap is not authorized -QUESTION:

And they listen for a while and they find

that almost one out of every two calls has some evidence of
criminality in it.

When are they supposed to stop listening?

MR. uHuR'fuRi

Well, it's a judgment that has to be

formed by the officers who are conducting the wiretap.

First of

all, they must have a design and a desire to follow the law.
In this case, the court found that there was no purpose on the
part of the agents, that their intercepting every call was done
wilfully and was done in violation of the order, simply because
the supervising agent did not clearly instruct the agents as to
what their responsibilities were,
QUESTIoN:

Yes, he told them not to listen to lawyer-

client calls, doctor-patisnt calls and priest-penitent calls.
MR. £iHORTER:
QUESTION:

Yes, obviously privileged,

What else should he have told them?

MR. SHORTER:

He should have told them that in the

instance -- well, after looking at the telephone calls between
Geneva Thuraon

and her mother that proceeded for several days -

thing the Government can say about any of the conversations

She also said something about a person

In response to a question that Geneva's

mother asked about Bernis Thurmon, the man that she was living
with,

"Where is Bernis?" and she said that "Bernis is out

taking care of business."

That's the gist of what the Government

points to in saying -~
QUESTION:

Didn't she say that, "Vie don’t talk about

business on the phone," too?
MR. SHORTER:

Well* that's the mother in a later

conversation, when the mother said, "Geneva, I have something
very important to tell you."

This is another conversation.

It

doesn't have anything to do with this conversation about Bernis
out taking care of business, which is what Geneva said to her
mother when her mother said, "Where is Bernis?"

versations go on the personal nature of them becomes quite
obvious.

Geneva said, "Nell,

phone.

A

Agent Cooper, during the first hearing, admitted that
the agents had no reason to believe, no suspicion that the
mother was involved in any narcotics-related activity, that
this was clearly what it obviously was, a mother callingstalking
to her daughter, having bantering kinds of conversations about
family matters and other personal matters.
Later, in the hearing that took place, a couple of
years later, after the Court of Appeals had reversed Judge Waddy
for the first time, his testimony took a slightly different view.
And that was that after reading the transcript of the seven
Geneva-Mother telephone calls, he believed that there v/as a
basis for a suspicion that the mother knew something about the
narcotic enterprise, which I would submit is not a basis to
intercept conversations between even a person accused of crime

13

and their mother* which is what it amounted to.
‘there was a call that Geneva made to, X believe, an
abortion clinic.

The agents justified intercepting that call

because they didn‘t know who she was going to talk to when she
called there.

It didn't occur to them, perhaps, that this might

be strictly a confidential, personal, medical matter, but they
intercepted the call and justified it on the grounds that well,
she might have been calling over there making some inquiry about
narcotics.

The pattern of the calls in this transcript was

that Geneva Jenkins did not call people about narcotics, to
place orders for narcotics or solicit customers for narcotics.
■:he received calls that were made to the phone for her husband.
That was the pattern.

The clear pattern in this case, after

examining the transcript, was that there were certain periods
during the day, particularly at night, I believe, from midnight
until 6:00 in the morning, when!.I: think over the 30-day period
there might have been an average of maybe one call per day
from those particular hours.
officer:

And the question was put to the

"Well, didn't you consider cutting off the wiretap,

minimizing the intrusion at least during the nighttime period?"
\

And it never occurred to them.
Another thing that was pointed out, every call that
was made from that phone, whether it be for the time if
Mr. Thurmon wanted to know what time of ds-y it was, what the
weather was, these calls were without any qualification totally

14
Intercepted *
QUESTION:

Of course, it's almost impossible to mini­

mize a call for the weather because by the time you finish
getting the report, it would take you that long to pull the
plug out, wouldn't it?
MR. aHORTER:
QUESTION:

No, that's not correct.

Mr, Shorter, you must be aware that there

have been cases where conversations, Innocent on their surface,
were conversations in code related to illegal activity.

That's

a familiar phenomenon in this business, isn't it?
MR, SHORTER:

Right,

and there came a time, and

the officers testified to it, where after listening to the
calls between Bsrnis and some of the other alleged co-conspira­
tors, they got to know the code that these individuals were
using Va;.1 if 1 ywd 1 -Lo ' -i-ike, one

He wasn't arranging for any meeting at

Fifth Street, he was telling Bernis that he wanted five units
of narcotics.

This was commonly known to the agents.

QUESTIONS:

Yes, but new codes are constantly evolving

are they not, and it takes quite a bit of listening before they
can identify a pattern.
MRo SHORTER:

Right.

I would agree that that's so,

but these people using this telephone were wedded to their own

endemic kind of language.

Most of the agents in this case had

participated in an earlier wiretap that had occurred in th©
District of Columbia during the summer, the preceding summer.
So, they were familiar with the street language in the District
of Columbia,

They were also familiar, by reason of having

tapped a telephone involving some Spanish people, Spanish»
speaking people,within the year preceding their utilizing this
tap, with what the codes were.

There was no problem about

identifying the language in the code that was used by the people
in this case,
That, of course, is not what our argument about mini­
mization deals with.

That

every justification in intercepting calls between the people

who were identified as ordering narcotics over the telephone
and they were justified in intercepting the conversations of
new people., until such time as they would get some understanding
of what these people might be calling about.
What we complain about is clearly set forth, that in

ORA., ARGUM:.:NT OF RICHARl A . ALIEN, SbQ .
ON BEHALF OF THIS RESPONDENT
MR» ALLEN:

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Mr. Shorter, today, is engaged in a discussion of
the particular interceptions in this case that is not reflected
in either of the briefs of the case.

But, in any event,

Mr. Shorter has suggested, it seemed to me, in his argument,
a standard of what the Government should have dene that reflects
exactly what the Government did in this case.

As I understood

his argument, he said that when you are listening to a conversa­
tion which involves a known party to the conspiracy the Govern­
ment has reason to li-sten to it.

Then he went on to say -- and

by the way, 1 would emphasize this.

The record in this case

reflects that every conversation that was intercepted one of
the parties to the conversation was either Petitioner Thurmon
or his girl friend, Geneva Jenkins, who is a co-defendant in
this case, ana both known participants in the conspiracy.
Mr. Shorter went on to suggest that, indeed, when a
conversation takes place between a known participant and a
stranger to the agents it is reasonable for the agents bo
listen to that conversation.

It seems to me that "if you want

to get into an analysis of each particular call that concession
would cover about 95% of them, including the calls he mentioned
in his argument.

QUESTION:

Lo you agree that every call was inter­

cepted?
MR, ALLEN:

Yes, Your Honor,, except for a short

period of time when the agents apparently hooked up to the
wrong phone and we don’t know how many calls were made.
QUESTION:

Well, does that seem to support his

argument that there was no discretionary -MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN:

No, Your Honor, 1 believe it does not.
X mean with every single call.
That's right, but I think all it reflects

is that it was reasonable to intercept every single call.
QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN:

Why?
Well, for a number of reasons.

Among

other things, the agents at the time and after the fact it seems
to be true that 40% were clearly narcotic-related,
QUESTION:

Well, after the fact doesn't help me,

because if you take a baseball bat and crack a man's head and
look in it and find dope that justifies, cracking his skull,
MR. ALLEN:

Well, Your Honor, we are not engaged in

that kind of an analysis.
QUESTION:

We are trying to decide --

My point is the statute says use some

discretion, right?

clusion, which.,the district Court engaged in.

in other words,

call and it is a clearly narcotics-related call.

Now, would you

say in that case that that evidenced that the agent hadn't used
any discretion?
QUESTION:

That has nothing to do with my question.

It's not one call here,
MR. ALIEN:
QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

There are 384 calls.
That's a lot different from one.
All of which our analysis indicates -All of which had to do with dope like the

weather.
MR. ALLEN:

No, Your Honor, not all of-which had to

do with, but all of which were reasonably intercepted on the
anticipation that they might have something to do with dope.
QUESTION:

So the weather one might be a frameup or

something?
MR. AL...EN:

Well, the weather calls stand by them­

selves, and as I understand it there were very few of those,
perhaps five or six.

There were perhaps twenty calls to find

24
out what time it was, which is about a five-minute call and the
agent has barely time to turn off the machine.,

The weather

calls arc, again, very short calls, and it is our position that
the

were not unreasonable in concluding that listening to

a very short weather call where, by the time he takes off the
headphones and turns off the machine the call is going to be
over, the agents, it seems to us, are reasonable in concluding
that the --

MR. ALLEN:

My question involved hitting the switch.
All right, even turning off the recorder.

By the time they reach over and turn off the recorder the call
is over.
QUESTION:

Well, why in the world, did they put this

provision in the statute?
MR.

provision -- they put the provision in the statute to accommo­
date very important individual interest in privacy.

Listening

to a recorded weather call that anyone can listen to simply does
not infringe upon anyone’s privacy, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, why does the statute say that?

The statute doesn’t say that, does it?
MR. ALLEN:

The statute didn't purport to enumerate

all of the infinite circumstances in which -- infinite kinds
of calls which an agent might ~~

QUELTIEN:

Do you think we should?

MR. AL...EN:

No, Your Honor, I think we have to look

and see-whether the conduct of the agents was reasonable and
whether it violated the kinds of things the statute was designed
to -QUEBYloN:

And do you think that where you turn a

listening device on 24 hours a day for 30 days that that's okay?
MR ? 1 \

*

It is okay, Your Honor, if all of the

calls that came through and fchqy were listening to they had
reasonable grounds to listen to.
QUELTXeN:

Did you tell us that every call inter­

cepted involved on one end of the line one or the other of the
two defendants in the case?
MR. ALLEN:

That is correct.

Either Bsrnis Thurmon,

the . Pet it loner,or his girld friend who is a co-defendant.
QUELTX^N:

Isn't it usual when you tap somebody's

phone that most of the time you hear him?
MR. ALLEN:

That Is correct, Your Honor, and when you

hear him you have greater reason to listen to his conversation
or some greater portion of it than you do when you listen to
his ten-year“old daughter.
QUESTION:

Yet, in the case that we heard several

years ago the evidence showed that there were numerous calls
to the tapped number where the person answering the phone was
not the person residing in that place, but someone else there

26

taking orders for narcotics.
QUESTION:

X think that case was the man's wife.

In Chicago?
MRo ALIEN:
QUESTION:

1 don't recall the case right off hand.
When it is a business enterprise* as the

narcotics business is* it would not be unusual to have some
relief in answering the phone to take orders.
MR. ALLEN:

That's right.

It seems to us that that

is something that an agent can reasonably take into account.
But in any event* in this case* the agents in the beginning
knew that Petitioner Thurmon was the target of the tap.

And.

after a few days* they knew that his girl friend was taking
orders for him.
The principal issue in this case* as we have been
discussing, is whether the agent violated the minimization
requirements in Judge Smith's orders.
Now* as I understand Petitioner's argument* their
argument is essentially as follows.

That the minimization re­

quirement of the statute imposes a two-pronged test, both of
which must be met before any interception is lawful.

The first-

prong is* according to the Petitioners* that the agents engage
in what they call "good faith" efforts at minimization.

The

second prong is that the interceptions be objectively reasonable.
Although they also assert that the interceptions in this case
were not objectively reasonable* they have relied almost

27

exclusively on the argument that there were no good faith effort
in this case to minimize.
Our response to their argument about good faith
efforts is two-fold.

Vie have two independent responses.

Our

first position is a legal position that the alleged good faith
or lack of good faith, subjective good faith of the agents
conducting an interception, is not a determining factor in
deciding whether they have complied with the statute and the
minimization orders.
Our second position is a factual position, that is,
that the record in this case simply does not support the claim
that the agents in this case had bad faith or subjectively in­
tended to violate the provisions of Judge .smith's orders, in­
cluding the minimization provision.
Now, the first issue, which is a legal issue, has
importance beyond the facts of this case and should be discussed
first, if not principally.

The legal question, as I suggested

to Mr. Justice Marshall, it seems to us, can, perhaps, best be
put in focus by considering the simplest case.

You have agents

who obtain a court order to intercept conversations, based on
probable cause that John .Smith, the owner of the telephone,
the subscriber to the telephone, is engaging in his narcotics
business over that telephone,

snd they obtain a court order

and the court order provides, pursuant to the statute, that the
interception should be conducted in such a way as to minimize

28

the interception of conversations not otherwise subject to the
statute.
The order, say, is for five days and during that
period there is one call that comes over the phone, and that's
a call from John Smith and he starts right off talking about his
narcotics business and they listen to it and they intercept it.
Now, suppose later on, there is a suppression hearing
and the agent testifies that his supervisor instructed him to
listen to everything that came over the line.

Now, as I under­

stand Petitioner's position, they would contend that the inter­
ception of that call, which we would submit is clearly reasonable,
is nevertheless unlawful because the aganfc who intercepted it
would probably have intercepted some other call that was never
made,in different circumstances.
Novj, it is our central position that there is simply
no basis in the statute, or in general principles of search
and seizure law, for that position.

We can't see any basis

for arguing that that agent in my example failed, in the words
of the statute, quote, "To minimize the interception of communi­
cations not otherwise subject to interception."
QUi&sTloN:

But, Mr. Allen, supposing the judge's

order had left out any command to minimize and said go ahead
and intercept everything.
one and it had been proper.
MR. ALLBN;

And then they had only intercepted
Would that have been a proper --

No, Your Honor, I don't think it would

29

because the statute provides as one of the grounds for suppres­
sion the allegation that the order is defective on his face.
And in your hypothetical the. order would be defective on its
face.

In other words, the interception that resulted from

that order would have resulted from defective order.
QtLBTldN:

Can you give mo an example of a violation

of a minimization order written in the words of the statute,
that would result In suppression?
MR. ALLEN:

Yes,

Suppose, for instance* the agents

tEtve. an order to investigate my John Smith example? And he is
out one night and he has a twelve-year-old babysitter and she
makes a call to her boy friend and the agents have no reason
to believe that she has anything to do or any knowledge of the
operation* but nevertheless* out of curiosity* intercept the
call.

And* by happenstance* the babysitter says,

"wall* you

know* my boss* Mr, Smith* left some narcotics over hers."
VJe would admit that in that circumstance it was unreasonable
for the agent, to listen to the conversation and the evidence
that happened to develop from it ought to be suppressed.
QUESTION:

In other words* you are applying a sort

of probable cause test that when the babysitter- is,..calling her
boyfriend there is no probable cause* in quotation marks* to
believe that they are going to talk about narcotics.

Is that

it* something like that?
MR, ALLEN:

I wouldn’t use the words probable cause,

MR. ALLEN:

Well, I would prefer to use the words:

As 1 say, our position is, fundamentally, that good
faith and lack of good faith cannot be a relevant consideration.
It is true under the statute and it is true as a general matter
of Fourth Amendment law.

But they listened to everything.
That's correct, Your Honor, in circum­

stances that mads it reasonable.
QUESTION:

They were guilty people, is that tha

reason?
MR, ALLEN:

No, no, Your Honor, the reason was that

the conversations they were listening to

wereheither na.rcotics-

■y©lasted or by someone who was involved in the conspiracy, and
.

they were either narcotics-related or they were sufficiently
ambiguous to give the agent some reason.
Let me give you an example.

Agent Cooper, who was

the primary witness in the suppression hearing, testified that
he conducted this interception on the same basis that he con­
ducted another interception recently.

And he said that, for

instance, in that interception, we had a case where two people
— a woman talking over the phone would always call her friend
and when she called the particular friend she would always talk

32

about her illness.

Well, after a time o: • two of that, we stopped

intercepting that kind of conversation.

I mean we had developed

reasons to believe that the interception of that conversation
wouldn't help our investigation.

It seems to me that that is

the reasonable way to go about it,

MR. AEDEN:

They told the judge.

Implicitly, they

told the judge when they applied for the order that they wanted
an order to intercept conversations that contained information
about the narcotics conspiracy.

Implicitly, they told the judge

they would act reasonably, which, in our view, they did.
QUESTION:

Mr. Allen, let me go back to your twelve Would you say they should not listen to

the first conversation of the babysitter.

Your example of the

illness by the other person, they listened two or three times

33
and decided they had identified the pattern.
MR. ALhilN:

Weil, it would depend on the circumstances

As a general presumption, it seems to me, that a conversation
between a twelve-year-old babysitter and her thirteen-year-old
boyfriend, it seems to me, although there may be circumstances
bo the contrary that that kind of conversation is not going to
be relevant.
QUESTION:

Maybe they have the twelve-year-old

answer the phone and they develop a pattern, have the twelveyear-old answer the phone, talk for a couple of minutes and
then turn the phone over to the parents who are going to talk
about drugs.

How are you going to avoid that sort of thing

if you say as soon as you hear a minute of juvenile conversation
we turn it off?
MR. AL.uSN:

It would depend on the circumstances.

1 think in some circumstances, it would be reasonable to
listen to a juvenile's conversation.

MR. A.IL3N:
QU.ibTXON:

The minimization requirement?

But the trouble is Congress did

put it in.
MRo AMLMN:

Well, some of the judges on the court

of Appeals and Mr,, Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Marshall have
expressed concern that if our position that the proper standard
should be objective reasonableness were adopted there would be
a danger that interceptions would then be validated by what
they turn up.

We submit that that concern is certainly under­

standable, but that it doesn’t accurately reflect our position
or the analysis that the Court of Appeals engaged in in this
case.

It doesn't reflect our position because, as I was stating

to Mr. Justice Stevens, our position is simply that the reason­
ableness of interceptions has to be based on what is going on
at the time, and if it is unreasonable for an agent to listen
to conversations in view of all of the sensory inputs on him,
then if by change it turns up evidence,.: it is our position that
that evidence should be suppressedc

And that, essentially, is

the analysis that .the.Court of Appeals engaged in in this case.
And, essentially, it is no different from any analysis vvhere

the courts try to decide, for example., whether a policeman was
justified in arresting someone or stopping and frisking someone
on the basis of circumstances at the time* even though that
person may wind up to have contraband or i\ieapons on him.
Apart from our legal position,
QUESTION:

As to stand, are you going to rely on

your brief?
MR, AL.n;.«N:

Essentially, Your Honor, we will rsly on

our brief as it is standing, unless the Court has any questions
about it.
Apart from our legal position, our factual response
to the Petitioner's claim about lack of good faith efforts is
that the record simply doesn't support the claim that the agent
here acted in bad faith or intended to ignore their minimization
obligations,
We have cited in our brief the testimony of Agent
Cooper, to the effect that he was aware of the minimization
requirement, that he instructed his agents with respect to them,
that he never instructed his agents to listen to every call,
and that if they had heard calls that appeared to be unlikely
to relate to the investigation» they would have turned them off.
And I won't burden the Court with recitations of the transcript,
But I would only point, out that the Petitioner's claim to the
contrary and the district Court's finding to the contrary is

36
that doesn’t logically support the conclusion»
For example, again to take the simple example of the
case where over the period of the intercept only one conversa­
tion was intercepted and it happens to be reasonable to inter­
cept it because it is clearly crime-related, suppose the agent
in that case, in a suppression hearing, has been, asked repeatedly,
as Agent Cooper was asked in this case, "Well, did you ever
make any efforts to minimize the interception of conversations?
Did you ever consider your minimization obligation?

Can you

point to any instance in which you exercised discretion that
resulted in the non-recordation as a discretionary matter as to
wha t wa s ov e rh ea rd ? "
If the agent in my example had given negative answers
to that question* that wouldn’t reflect that he was operating
in bad faith.

It would only reflect that he intercepted the

only call that came over the line.

And that is, essentially,

the basis for the Petitioner’s claim on bad faith and the
basis for the District Court's analysis.
If the Court accepts our position that the proper
standard is objective

reasonableness,the - question remains

whether the interceptions in this case were objectively reason­
able,

In their brief, the Petitioners don’t seriously challenge

the Court of Appeals’ conclusion that it was objectively reason­
able to interctspt all of the calls in this case.

And they

don't point -- at least in their brief ~~ to any calls that

37
shouldn't have been Intercepted or any reasons as to why they
shouldn't have been intercepted.
But the Court may be interested in the question.,
more generally — of general considerations that apply to
determining whether interceptions are reasonable or not reasonable.
And, at the outset, I want to stress again that It
is not our intent to belittle the .importance of the statutory
minimization requirements, We recognize that they are designed
bo serve and accommodate important individual interests in
privacy.

But how those interests can best be implemented in

each particular case often poses some very difficult problems.
Wow, the Court of Appeals started with the proposition
that seems clearly correct to us, that the very nature of inter­
ceptions that are authorized and limited by the statute requires
monitoring agents to listen to at least some portion of every
call before they can make any judgment as to the likelihood that
the call is going to be relevant or irrelevant.

Now, how much

of the call may then be reasonably intercepted depends on a
wide variety of circumstances, including what the agents know
about the callers, the scope of the criminal enterprise, the
degree of coded language employed in the call, and so forth.
i.iOj.

ooiiSxoeiw*o j*e*,iS

Uv,n

ue ^pplxeb oulj* ui oex

die

agents have been able to develop some patterns among the calls,
Now, the Courts of Appeals have developed a number

38
of relevant factors, including those I've just mentioned, but
it would be impossible to enumerate an exhaustive list.

In

some kinds of cases, it may be possible for agents to develop
more or less formal procedures or guidelines with respect to how
they are going to go about an intercept.

For example, in a

gambling case, if they have reason to believe that John &mith
is conducting a gambling business from a certain telephone,
from his residential phone, but has three small children or
three tcsenage children, it may be possible for the agent to
develop guidelines that say don't listen to the calls of the
children, but listen to the calls of John Smith.

Because in a

gambling case, most of those kinds of calls are simply calls
where the caller calls in and places a bet, right off the bat.
They go right to the business.
In other kinds of cases, like narcotics, particularly
in narcotics conspiracies where there are many unknown partici­
pants and where- one caller is always a known participant, It
is much more difficult for the agent to establish guidelines,
and they may have to rely on an ad hoc judgment about the calls
they are listening to.
This case, I think, reflects that narcotics con­
spiracies present some unique difficulties to agents conducting
interceptions under the statute.

In narcotics conspiracies,

at least like this case, it is very typical that the beginning
portion of the conversation is largely ambiguous or irrelevant

39
and then the participants may refer to a suit of clothes which
means a delivery of narcotics.

And so it is much more difficult

in this kind of case for an agent to decide with any great degree
of certainty what kind of conversation they are listening to or
to apply any formal procedures with respect to when to turn them
off.
With respect to the additional issues in this case
concerning the scope of the suppression remedy

and the standing

of Petitioner Scott, we rely primarily on the arguments we have
addressed in the brief.
I would only emphasize here our response to the
Petitioner's argument that if, as we contend, the statute only
requires the suppression of conversations that should not have
been intercepted because they are irrelevant, then agents will; not
be deterred from listening to every conversation.

That argument

: seems to us. to misconceive the traditional purpose of the
exclusionary rule which is not to punish police but rather to
remove their incentive to commit unlawful acts.
Our position is fully consistent with that traditional
purpose. Any interception that should not have been intercepted
should be suppressed, thereby removing the agent's incentive to
intercept communications in violation of the minimization require*
ment.

But, beyond that, there is even less reason or need in

this context to expand the suppression remedy, because this
statute, unlike most Fourth Amendment contexts. Imposes

40

significant affirmative sanctions on officers who violate their
statutory obligations in bad faith, civil and criminal sanctions.
QUESTION:

There is a way to read this statute,

Mr„ Allen, as a question by my brother Stevens a while ago
indicated, that would make it both semantically meaningless,
as well as you -- as practically meaningless.

Because the

statute says "imposes an obligation to conduct the surveillance
in such a way as to minimize the interception of communications
not otherwise subject to interception under this chapter*,"
And all the communications are otherwise subject to interception
under this chapter, under tho court order,
MR, ALLJN:

Arguably, Your Honor, although the statute

specifically exempts, I believe, privileged conversations„
QUESTION:

Yes, -everything except evidentiary

privileged conversations,
MR, ALLiN: That is a possible way to read the
statute. Your Honor.
QUESTION: Grammatically, that is the way to read it.
isn't it?
MRU ALL2N:
that reading.

That is correct«

We wouldn't rely on

It seems to us that the purpose of the statute

read as a whole is to authorize only certain kinds of inter-»
ceptlons of certain kinds of conversations, and that was
probably what the minimization provision was referring fcoj
that is, if you receive an authorization to intercept, to obtain

41

narcotics conversat ions, it seems to us the statute probably
meant that you. weren’t supposed to receive — that you were
supposed to make reasonable efforts to minimize the interception
of non-relevant conversations.
QUESTION:

Mr, Allen, do you rely at all on an argu­

ment, X don't know if it has been made or not, that your inves­
tigating people are going to be potential defendants in a
criminal trial, presumably they may come up with some kind of
an alibi defense, or they may come up with stories that would
try to explain ambiguous transactions, and even though a
particular conversation is not crime-related it may give you
information in the nature of a diary,or something about the
trial that would help you at the trial?
MR, ALLEN:

We would contend, Your Honor, that the

authorization under a court order extends to the interception
of communications for the purpose of developing evidence rele­
vant to the investigation.
QUESTION:

Including impeaching evidence, potentially

.Impeaching evidence?
MR, ALLEN: I should think so. Your Honor, although
I w.ould want to think about that a little longer.
QUESTION:
such as an alibi.

Possible defense in a criminal trial,

If he says, "I was visiting my mother at

2:00 o'clock Tuesday afternoon,"

And you can say, "As a matter

of fact, you were on the telephone talking to your butcher."'

42

MR» ALLEN:

in certain circumstances, that might be

reasonable, although I wouldn’t want to taka it too far because
if you took it too far you could intercept everything,
QUESTION :

exactly.

You don’t know what a person is going to say by way
of an alibi until the trial begins,
.MR, ALLEN:

That's right.

But we wouldn't contend

that the statute should be construed to let us intercept every­
thing for any reason, only for reasonable reasons,
