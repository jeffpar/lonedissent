MR0 CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 76-719» NLRB against Local Union No» 103°
Mr* Come.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COME, ESQ. ,
CN BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR* COME:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case is here on certiorari to the District of
Columbia Circuit which denied enforcement of the Beard's order
directed to Respondent union, a local of the Ironworkers.

The

case Involved the relationship between two provisions that were
added to the National Labor Relations Act in 1959°

The first.

Section 8(f) which permits employers and unions in the building
and construction industry to enter into agreements before
employees have been hired, so-called "pre-hire agreements,"
and Section 8(b) (7) (c) which regulates recognitional and
organizational picketing by a labor organization.

And, in

ge. sral terms, the question presented is whether a pre-hire
agreement entered into pursuant to Section 8(f) privileges
recognitional picketing by a minority union which would other­
wise violate Section 8(b)(7)(c).
Now, the facts are briefly these:

In May of "73,

Higdon Construction Company executed a contract with G1eranore
Distilleries to erect a facility In Kentucky.

The contract

4
required Higdon to use union labor* and in order to obtain
ironworkers from Respondent union it was required to sign an
acceptance to the area-wide labor agreement which the union had
entered into with a multi-employer association.

The agreement

purported to cover all employees who performed ironwork for
signatory employers within the union's territorial jurisdiction.
It contained no provision requiring employees hired by the
employer to become union members* the union security clause*
and no provision requiring the employer to check off union dues.
Higdon Construction performed the Glenmore job with some of its
own employees who were non-union and with some employees who
were supplied by the union.
QUESTION:

VJhat did the agreement contain, Mr. Come?

MR. COMB:

The agreement contained provisions

establishing wage rates, welfare and pension benefits and
working rules for the employees.

It did not have a union

security clause in it or a check off provision.
QUESTION:

Were there pension requirements for —

Suppose there were no union members hired on a job* would they
still have to contribute to a pension plan?
MR, GOME:

An I read the acceptance here* you would,

QUESTION:

Thank you.

QUESTION:

Would the Board's position be any different

if there were a union security clause in the agreement?
MR, COME:

The Bear’d 5s position would be different*

as indicated by the -«= If the union security clause were
enforced.
QUESTION:

By the employer, you mean?

MR* COME:

By the employer*

In that situation, the

Board would treat it like an ordinary collective bargaining
agreement which carries with it a presumption that the union
ha s maj ority s ta tus *
The Bear'd found, and the Court of Appeals accepted
that finding, that neither at the time the labor agreement was
executed nor thereafter did the union claim to or in fact
represent a majority of Higdon Construction's employees at the
Glenmore project.

Meanwhile, Higdon Contracting was formed

to perform non-union iron jobs and it bid successfully on two
jobs, Grace and Barmet, and began work on them with non-union
labor.

When Higdon refused to apply the prior agreement to

these jobs, the union picketed the jobs with signs stating that
Higdon Construction was in violation of the previous pre-hire
agreement which was entered into at the Glenmore job.

Higdon

Contracting filed an 8(b)(7) charge and the Board found that
violation of that provision.

It preliminarily found the

agreement between the union and Higdon, although it was a pre­
hire agreement sanctioned by 8(f), did not privilege the
picketing at the Grace job site as a means of enforcing that
agreement because there was no showing that the union had ever
acquired a majority under the agreement to form a full

6
collective bargaining relationship,,

The Board, in so holding,

relied on its earlier decision in R. J„ Smith, holding that a
pre-hire agreement without proof that the union had acquired
majority support thereunder, did not carry with it a presumption
that the union had become the Section 9(a) or majority repre­
sentative of the employees.

The Court of Appeals which had

set aside the Board *s decision in R0 Jo Smith also set aside
its decision here.
Now, it9s established principle, under the National
.tabor Relations Act, that employees shall be free to select
their own bargaining representative, that an employer is
obligated to bargain under Section 8(a)(5) of the Act only
with the representative designated by a majority of the em“
ployees in an appropriate unit, and that it is an unfair labor
practice, both on the part of the employer and the union, to
enter into a collective bargaining agreement when the union
does not represent a majority of the employees, even though
the parties may in good faith believe that they do, and even
though subsequently the union may in fact acquire a majority.
Section 8(b)(7)(c) provides significant additional protection
for the employees? rights of free choice by prohibiting a
union which is not currently certified as the bargaining
representative of the employees from picketing’to force the
employer to recognize it as the employees" representative for
more than 30 days unless a representation- petition is filed c

7
If a timely petition is filed then a provision is
made for an expedited elect ion., and the whole theory of 8(b)(7)(c)
is to channel disputes concerning the representation status of
a union from the picket line into the Board's representation
procedures»

The union's picketing here came squarely within

8(b)(7)(c)»

It had never been certified by the Board as the

representative of Higdon's employees* nor had it otherwise
been selected by a majority of those employees«

Nevertheless*

the union picketed here for more than 30 days during which time
no representation petition was filed®
the picketing was to compel

The avowed purpose of

Higdon to adhere to the pr@~hire

agreement executed for the Glenmore job* the necessary effect
of which would have been to recognize the union as the repre»
sentative of the employees at the Grace job site* even though
they had never selected the union as their representative»
Now* the basic question that we come down to here is
whether the 8(f) agreement removes the picketing from the react
of 8(b)(7)(c) on the theory that such agreement-,,

by operation

of law, has established the union as the Section 9(a)^ or
majority, representative of Higdon's employees, and thus
the representation question has already been resolved»
. In the Board's view, an 8(f) agreement does not,
without more, establish the union is the majority representative0
It is merely a preliminary step that contemplates further
action to establish a full bargaining relationship.

Hence,

8
absent a showing that the union has required such majority
support, the agreement is enforceable neither through a
bargaining order issued under Section 8(a)(5) which obligates
the employer to bargain with the majority representative nor
d-fces it Insulate the picketing from 8(b)(7)(c) picketing»
Now, the Board’s position rests upon the following
considerations o

In the first place, we start with the language

of the statute which is set forth at page 3 of the Board 1 s
brief»

It provides that

practice

it shall not be an unfair labor

for employers or unions in the construction industry

to make an agreement covering employees engaged (or who, upon
their employment, will be engaged)

in that industry because

the majority status of such labor organization has not been
established under the provisions of Section 9 .prior fcro
the making of such agreement.
Now, nothing in that language suggests that it was
intended to confer upon a union that is & party to a pre-hire
agreement the status of a section 9(a), or majority, repre­
sentative,

Congress did not in Section 8(f) or elsewhere

modify Sections 8(a)(5) or 9(a),

The former, as I have

indicated, obligates the employer to bargain with the repre­
sentative of his employees subject to the provisions of 9(a),
and 9(a) defines the bargaining representative as the repre­
sentative selected by the majority of the employees in an
appropriate unit.

Moreover, while the Board’s well established

9
contract bar rules would preclude the Board from entertaining
a representation petition during the life of an ordinary
collective bargaining agreement, the last proviso of the
Section 8(f) which is on page 4 of the brief provides that any
agreement which would be invalid but for clause (l)» which
without the majority being established, shall not be a bar
to a petition filed pursuant to Section 9(c) which is the
provision for determining representation questions, or 9(e)
which is a provision that permits employees to de-authorize a
union security clause»
Now, the legislative history, we believe, confirms
that Congress, in authorizing pre-hire agreements, intended to
do nothing more,because of the peculiar characteristics of the
building and construction industry, to relieve them from what
would otherwise be a clear violation of fc,he National Labor
Relations Act»

I mentioned earlier, and this Court so held

in the pa men t Workers

case a number of years ago, that in the

ordinary case an employer and:a union have bo have a represen­
tative complement of employees on board and the union has to
represent a majority of them before you can enter into a
collective bargaining agreement.

This didn't work in the

building and construction industry because of the short-term
nature of most construction projects and the fact that the
employers- ordinarily lacked a steady complement of employees.
It is necessary for employers to enter into regular agreements

10

before the job is started or the workers are hired«,

So 8(f)

was enacted to relieve them of having to comply with what
would otherwise be an impossible rule for the building and
construction industry.

It caused a lot of trouble under the

Taft-Harfcley Act in administering because it just didn't fit*
But, we submit that that is as far as Congress intended to go.
It did not intend to relieve unions of the responsibility of
acquiring majority support under these contracts.

Congress

thought that in the typical case that would happen because the
employer would draw from a pool of skilled craftsmen in the
area who are usually or often union members; secondly, it
permitted the negotiation of union security provisions which
gave employees 7 days instead of the normal 30 to join the
union.
QUESTION:

May I interrupt you for just a minute.

If I understand you, you are saying that the 8(f)
removed the legal rule that it would be an unfair labor
practice for the union to enter into such an agreement, but it
did not have the effect of making the union the collective
bargaining agent of the employees.
MR, COME:

That is correct.

QUESTION;

Well, was the net result of this the

creation of a valid enforceable contract or not?
are saying it was not„
whole thought out.

If not, how would

I gather you

Let me get the '

How then would they determine whether the

11

employees could be#insist on being paid the wage rate
specified in the agreement# for example# or bonuses at the
end?

Were these enforceable obligations or not?
MR» COME:

Well# if the employer and the union abided

by the agreement# and if the union acquired majority support
under the agreement# they would be enforceable»
QUESTION:

Now# my assumption would be that the union

never gets a majority status but toward the end of the contract
terns# when they finished the building# the company just de­
cided# "Well# we've decided not to pay you that amount»
think we agreed to pay more than we should have»
enforceable contract»

It's not an

We will give you the reasonable value of

your services and that's it»"
MR» COME:

We

Would they be free to do that?

Under the Board's position# if the union

had not acquired majority support, if the employer failed to
abide by the contract# it would not be an enforceable obligation
under Section 8(a)(5) of the statute»

The Board would not

issue a bargaining order requiring the employer to abide by
the agreement»

Whether there would be a suit under 301 or some

other suit for the recovery of wages under that contract for
the period under which it was observed# is a question that the
Board has not passed on«

QUESTION:

But# insofar as the Board is concerned

Wouldn't the logical implication to your

position be that no such suit could be maintained on the

contract., even though there might be some kind of a quantum
meruit claim, or something like that»
MR» COME:

I think that that would be the logical

implicationo
QUESTION:

Well, that's not much of a contract in the

normal senae of that word, even in the sense of a collective
bargaining contract,

if it is not binding on anybody,.

not an agreement and

it's not a contract, is it?

MR. COME:

I think, Your Honor,

That's

that that is the

plight here, that in the Board's view this pre-hire agreement
is not a thorough contract»

It gives the union the right to

enter into the agreement but it takes subsequent action to
mature that into a full collective bargaining arrangement»
QUESTION:

Really, in your submission, all 8(f) does

is exempt the employer and the union from charges of an unfair
labor practice»
MR. CORE:

That is correct»

QUESTION:

That's the extent of what it does.

MR. GOME:

That is correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Well, if the contract is no good, why do

you need 8(f)?
MR, COME:

You need 8(f) because the mere entering

into the contract would have been illegal without 8(f) and —■
QUESTION:
either side?

So the contract cannot be enforced by

MR, COME:

It can be if the union has acquired the

majority support -QUESTION:

Tha t's aIways true.

QUESTION:

Why do you need 8(f) if it6© just; as I

understand, a piece of paper signed that has no binding effect
on anybody?
MRo COME:

You need 8(f) to give that —

QUESTION:

That’s an agreement?

MR. COME:

— initial period to acquire a majority»

Even under the Court of Appeals' position, the agreement
doesn't have much more effect because the Court of Appeals
agrees, and I do not understand my brother to disagree, that
the entry into the agreement does not relieve the union of the
necessity to acquire a majority support under it.

So that,

if the employer were to file a petition, or the employees or
a union, and the union that entered into that contract was
found to have a minority status that contract would be
unenforceable and come to an end.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gome, on the hypothetical my brother

Stevens posed to you, that is the breaches of the wage pro­
vision of the 8(f) contract, doesn't Lion Dry Goods suggest
that would be enforceable in the court under 301?
MR. COME:

Lion Dry Goods, Your Honor, — and we

have addressed ourselves to that more fully In our reply brief
~~ holds that the strike settlement agreement, that there is

14
jurisdiction under Section 301 to entertain a sui’o on a strike
settlement agreement, notwithstanding the fact that the union
does not purport to represent a majority of the employees,,
QUESTION:

Wasn't the holding — it is some while

since I read it — Wasn’t the holding in Lion Dry Goods that
the strike settlement agreement was enforceable under 301?
Wasn't that the holding?
MRo COME:

The holding was — As I read the holding -

And, of course, Your Honor wrote it so he probably is more —
QUESTION:

My recollection is — I don't know why

we would have written a decision if

didn't hold that the

strike settlement agreement was enforceable *
MR0 COME:

Well, the precise holding was that there

was jurisdiction, that jurisdiction was not defeated merely
because it was not a typical —
QUESTION:

Jurisdiction into what?

To decide that

it wasn't enforceable?
MR, COME:

Jurisdiction to entertain sult„

QUESTION:

Which does not mean that the plaintiff

would have won,
MR, COME:
have won,

It does not mean that the plaintiff would

Similarly, even though the Court in reaching that

conclusion pointed to 8(f) as another form of minority agree»
ment
QUESTION:

Incidentally, I am reading from your own

15

brief as to Lion Dry Goods:

"the Court indicated its view

that the strike settlement agreement in that case would be
enforceable."

You cite 369 U.S, at 27.

MR. COME:

But we go on to point out that it does

not indicate under what circumstances it would be, and we
submit that there are circumstances under which an 8(f)
agreement would be enforceable clearly had the union acquired
a majority support under ~~
QUESTION:

That's not because of the initial 8(f)

agreement, that's because of subsequent developments.
MR. COME:

Yes, but without 8(f), that agreement

would have been illegal to begin with.
QUESTION:
practice.

Yes.

It would have been an unfair labor

You've told us that.

That's correct,

obviously.
MR. COME:

Similarly, there are circumstances under

which, even under the Court of Appeals' position, the 8(f)
agreement would not be enforceable.
QUESTION:

That's explicitly covered by the second

proviso under 8(f), isn't it?
MR. COMB:

That gets to the question as to whether

that is the only way in which Congress visualized —
QUESTION:

And that's really the nub of the contro­

versy between you and your brother, isn't it?
MR. COME:

That is correct, Your Honor.

16
CUESTION:

As X understand your brief.

MR. COME:

Yes.

CUESTION:

Would an agreement which, on its face,

said that it is unenforceable by either side, be an unfair
labor practice?

now.

MR. GOME:

I really can’t imagine --

CUESTION:

I can imagine.

It’s what you've got here

That's what you've got here now.
MR. COME:

Well, we submit that without 8(f) ---

CUESTION:

You don’t need 8(f). do you?

MR. GOME:

Well, you do, but — I would like to

reserve the balance of my time, if I may,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURC-ER:

Very well.

Mr, Berger,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SYDNEY L. BERGER, ESC.,
FOR THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BERGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
First of all, I would respectfully call to your
attention there are important facts in the record omitted in
the opening statement.
One, there is a history of an 8-year collective
bargaining relationship between.Vthls employer and our client,
Local 103 of the Ironworkers.

Two, the record is undisputed

that this employer formed a new company solely, quote,

'to get

17
around the contract."

As a result of that, the Administrative

law Judge found, the NLRB found that the employer was guilty of
chicanery, of subterfuge, of sham, and the District Judge,
the United States District Judge in Ov^ensboro, to whom the
Board went for an injunction, where all they had to prove was
that the Regional Director had reasonable cause to believe we
committed an unfair —
QUESTION:

But your position would be the same if

there hadn’t been any chicanery or subterfuge.
MR. BERGER:
no.

Mr. Justice White, I would say yes and

I would say yes, our position would be the same as far as

statutory interpretation is concerned.
QUESTION:

And as far as your right to picket to

enforce this contract.
MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:
construction, period.

Yes.
And what’s involved here is statutory in
And we can just assume that this is the

same employer even though there was a change of corporate form.
And that’s conceded now, isn't it?

We assume that this was the

same employer on all three.
MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:
MR. BERGER:
Court:

Yes, sir.
That’s really all that’s involved.
May I respectfully suggest this to the

that this is not only a court of lav; but a court of

justice and it says on the proscenium as I came in the

18
steps with awe, and came into this chamber, "With equal justice
under the law.*'

And I suggest that if the Board's position is

upheld and if the Court finds that this employer who was guilty
of chicanery,and all of that,and subterfuge and sham was right
and that our client was wrong an injustice has been done.
I think that is a factor —
QUESTION:

The Labor Board which has the first

obligation in these matters didn’t decide the case on that
basis.

Is it in the case at all?
MR. BERGER:

You are correct, Mr. Justice White.

It

is not in the decision of the Labor Board.
QUESTION:

And we haven’t any basis for deciding the

case on another ground, have we?
MR. BERGER:

Except that the record is undisputed

and the Administrative Law Judge used that as a basis for his
disagreement.
GUEST ION:
MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:

I know, but the Board didn’t.
That is right, Mr. Justice.
All that language has to do with Is

whether or not this was a different employer, and you won on
that.

Okay, this is the same employer.
MR, BERGER:

You've won that point.

Okay, thank you, Mr. Justice Stewart.

I will now move from that premise.
QUESTION:
MR. BERGER:

Itcs a useful footnote In your brief.
Thank you, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

19
In any event, the record also,shows that the only
purpose of the picketing was to require the employer to honor
its contract with the local union, and the record finally is
undisputed that this contract covered all of the employer's
employees and all of the job sites»
QUESTION:

Now, this is important --

May 1 ask you if the contract, as you

understand it, calls for the company to bargain with the union*?
Was the picketing intended to put pressure on the employer to
bargain with the union as the bargaining agent for the employees
or just to enforce the wage provisions and other provisions?
MR» BERGER:

Just to enforce the wage provisions and

to honor the contract»
QUESTION:

And he wouldn't have needed to bargain with

the union at all to do that.
MR. BERGER:

That is right.

All be had to do was

live up to his contract.
QUESTION:

What about an arbitration provision?

In1 other words, were agreements and arbitration in this pre­
hire agreement, or not?
MR. BERGER:

I don't recall that, but it wouldn't

have mattered because the employer would not have honored any
grievance, Mr. Justice White.

He just said, "I'm not complying

with the contract because this other company that I've formed
is not ~~n
QUESTION:

X understand that, but If there were

20

grievance and arbitration provisions in the contract, I suppose
the union men would have been in the position of acting as the
collective bargaining agent in administering the contract?
MR„ BERGER:
QUESTION:

Correct, sir.
But that wasn't involved here you don't

think?
MRQ BERGER:

I don’t think so, sir.

Now, the Board *s interpretation of this agreement
is, in effect, an attempt to rewrite the statute*

Because

what the Board says Section 8(f) means is that a contract is
not a contract until the employer establishes — excuse me —
until the union establishes its majority at each job site*
Now, if Congress had wanted the union to do that, if Congress
had intended that an 8(f) contract is valid only when the
union establishes a majority, it would have said sc.
is silent on that.

The Act

Furthermore, the legislative history that

they speak about was mentioned by the Court of Appeals four
years ago in the Local 150 case, when they said, "We can find
no sanction in the language, history or policy" — history
meaning legislative history — "of Section 8(f) to permit an
employer to abrogate unilaterally a validly executed pre-hire
agreement or to permit an employer to commit what is otherwise
an unfair labor practice even though at that time the union
has not obtained majority status."
Now, the question is suggested in the Board's briefs

21
that,what about the employee's wishes, and that?

Well, the

proviso takes care of that because the proviso says that unlike
a normal contract where you can't have an election because of
the contract bar, any time, at any time after an 8(f) contract
is signed the employees, if they feel the union is not repre­
senting them and they don't want the union, the employer, if he
feels that this is not a union which represents a majority of
his employees or any other union, can come in and get an elec­
tion and there would be no -QUESTION:

Excuse me.

The practical consequence of

the decision one way or the other is just which side has to
petition for an election?
MR. BERGER:

But it is much more than that in its

implication, Mr, Justice Rehnquist because our interpretation,
the correct interpretation, is the contract is valid until an
election is held at which the union loses.

If the union loses

and is no longer a majority represented, then the contract is
then terminated and no longer effective.
a valid contract.

But until then, it is

The Board construed sophistry in trying to

say it is a contract and it is not a contract,and the union ha
to go in to petition for an election means you don't have a
contract.

Everybody signs a document in good faith.

The

employer agrees to pay certain wages and working conditions and
then it can just say, "I don't have to,

because you haven't

proved to the union that you have a contract,"

22
QUESTION:

Of course., when you say,

"Everybody signs

a contract in good faith," your typical construction industry
contractor signs one of those agreements at a time when he may
have no employees at all.
*

MR„ BERGER:

That-8s right, Mr, Justice Rehnquist,

and the legislative history which is relied on says that's the
purpose of It.

And, reading from the Senate Committee on Labor

and Welfare report, which both sides-concede is the authorita­
tive document, and it is set out at pages — many places ~~ but
in the Board "s brief at pages 20 and 21, says that "such: labor
agreements necessarily apply to jobs which have not been
started and may not even be contemplated 0

The practice of

signing such agreements for future employment is not entirely
consistent with Wagner Act rulings."
And then they said that exclusive contracte can
lawfully .foe concluded only if a lot of people sign.

They

said there is a reason why it has to be different in the eonstruct Ion industry.

One is that the employer has to knov/ his

labor costs; two, he has to have available a supply of skilled
craftsmen, and therefore the history shows that the purpose
of the labor contract is to legitimatize the practice of a
union and employer signing a contract for three years, as was
done In this case and is done throughout the country, two or
three years or one year, to assure a supply of skilled crafts­
men, to give stability in the industry —

23
QUESTION:

I doubt if there is much argument about

the purpose, Mr* Berger.

Tell me, it is a fact here the

employer did not seek an election, is that right?
MR* BERGER:
QUESTION:
MR* BERGER:

That is right, Mr. Justice Powell.

Do you know why?
The records are silent on that*

theorize but the record is silent.

J, can

The employees also did not

seek an election.
QUESTION:

And, of course, you know why they didn't,

I suppose*
MR* BERGER:

I don't know why.

I can guess, but I

am sure Your Honor is able to do that better than I.

But the

point is it is undisputed they had the right to do that at any
time.

Instead of tearing up the contract, in effect, they could

have used the remedy which Congress gave them to do so*
The Board points out that it is worried about topdown organizing.

Yet, the Board says that if in this contract

there was a union security provision which would have required
employees on the job to join the union after 8 days, which is
permitted under the Act, then the union would have a presumption
of majority status*
QUESTION:

That is if the employer enforced it*

The Board says that would be true if the employer enforced the
union security provision.
MR* BERGER:

Yes, sir*

But the point is, Mr* Justice

24

Stewart, that I want to make to the Court is that this would
encourage unions to force employees to join rather than give
them a chance to assert their wishes in an election which is
freely held as provided in the proviso to Section 8(f).
The Board 's interpretation, aside from its inconsis­
tency and illogicality, has several very bad effects»

They are

shown by the fact that they Cite in their reply brief, for'examp'le, - this -uee Cee case which the Board just handed down.

Now.,

in the.-nce Cee case, ■ you had a similar situation of an ..employer
who had formed another corporation and disregarded a union
collective bargaining agreement who insisted if you wanted to
keep working for him the employees would have to drop out of
the union.

This was a blatant unfair labor practice and the

Board so ruled.

But yet the Board said that despite that the

agreement which the employer had signed which he violated was
not binding on the union because the union didn't prove that it
represented a majority of the employees at each particular site»
But the employer's unfair labor practice prevented the union
from getting a majority of the employees

-.And.:, that's what the

Court of Appeals correctly pointed out in 1973 in the Local 150
Operating Engineers case.
QUESTION:

I take it it wouldn't satisfy you if

this Court were to hold that your pre-hire is enforceable in
the courts but not by picketing»
MR. BERGER:

Well, you say — It is not for my

satisfaction to be a factor# Mr. Justice White# but if you
mean —
QUESTION:

Legally# would you find that tenable at

all?
MR» BERGER:

Well# if the Court so rules# it is

not only tenable# it is the law»

But before the Court has

so ruled# it is ray position that the First Amendment is still
a very viable thing.

It is still very important in this

country and picketing is still the exercise of a First
Amendment right.
QUESTION:

So you think this isn't just a statutory

question?
MR. BERGER:

It is, but I was trying to answer#

Mr. Justice White, your question as to a possible ruling by
the Court.

I would prefer the Court say that the contract is

enforceable by picketing because the First Amendment says you
have a right to picket and tell people about facts.

And the

Taft-Hartley Act itself says so.
QUESTION:

Well# I'll put It this way:

Would your

aims — Could you achieve your aims through legal action
rather than by picketing?
MR. BERGER:

We could, but the problem# Your Honor#

is that this is a small union and If they have to go to court
and legally enforce every violation you are going to over­
burden the courts which# Mr. Chief Justice has already pointed

27

out are greatly over-burdened In their work.
encourage delay in litigious processes»

You are going to

And if it is legal to

have such a contract,and if an employer breaks such a contract,
and it is an enforceable contract,why can't the union just have:
a man, and only one man, peacefully picket with a sign saying
the company violates the agreement?
QUESTION:

May I ask you once more:

Do you think

you vjould have been entitled to picket if you had asked the
employer to recognize the union as the collective bargaining
agent and the employer had said, "No, I will not, but of course
I will pay the wages that the agreement calls for"?
MR, BERGER:
course not.

Absent the contract in this case, of

That would be reeognitional picketing and you

can’t
QUESTION:

With the contract, would you say he had

to recognize you as the collective bargaining agent?
MR, BERGER:

With all due respect, Mr, Justice

White, I say he had already recognized the union,
QUESTION;
MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:

So the answer is yes?
Yes, sir,
Well, the picketing would accomplish your

result in about a week, probably, but the litigation might
take a long time*
MR, BERGER:
QUESTION:

That's right, Your Honor,
Maybe not even a week of picketing would

28

the employer withstand0
MRo

BERGER:

You are taking an arbitrary time and

certainly economic pressure — and if I read your question*
Mr, Chief Justice Burger* correctly* about withstanding* a
union is entitled to bring a certain kind of economic pressure
where picketing is legal,
QUESTION:

I wasn't questioning thatc

I was just

trying to get at what your alternatives — which alternative
you would prefer.
MR, BERGER:

I would prefer the picketing for the

reasons Your Honor stated.
QUESTION:

Mr. Berger* let me follow up on Justice

White's question because I am not completely sure I understand
your answer.

He was asking,if I followed your dialogue

correctly, whether it was possible that the contract might
be a valid enforceable contract, but nevertheless you might
have violated Section 8(b)(7) by picketing to enforce it,
just reading 8(b)(7) in a very literal way.
around the literal language of 8(b)(7)?

How dc you get

Why doesn't the

language apply to your situation?
MR, BERGER:

Because, Your Honor, the Board has

consistently ruled in the Oil ffleld Research cases and in other
cases and the Court of Appeals ruled that where picketing has
been conducted by a union who already signed a contract it is
not reeognitional picketing because reoognitional picketing

29

only applies to the Initial attempt for the union to gain that
recognition.,

We cite, at page 11 of our brief, the Dallas

case and I quote from the Court of Appeals language there in
1968, that the Board itself there, "The Board correctly points
out that Section 8(b)(7)(A) is aimed only at a labor organi­
zation's picketing to gain recognition for the first time, not
picketing designed to retain its representative status,,"
So, under the Board's own prior decisions, and we
cite them in our brief, the Bay Counties case, the Sullivan
Electric Company case, the Board has previously and repeatedly
ruled and the Court of Appeals has ruled that picketing» such as
that in the case at bar, even arguendo, it was for collective
bargaining purposes, was not within the prohibition of 8(b)

(7>(A).
QUESTION:

Let me ask the opposite of the question»

If your argument is valid, wouldn't it equally be valid even
if the contract is invalid, if they are not seeking to get
their first recognition they are seeking merely to maintain
a recognition they had, even though the status before wasn't
as a party to a valid contract they still were doing something
lawful»

Is the validity of the contract of controlling

importance,is what I am trying to figure out»
MR» BERGER:

It is a very sharp question,

Mr» Justice Stevens, and I am not sure how to answer that
because it would appear to me, in the first place, that it

30

could be argued that once the employer breaches the contract
and it Is no longer controlling* there is a termination of the
recognition of the union»

And if the union then pickets* if

the contract is invalid* the union was then picketing to get
recognitions! status for the first time»

If the contract was

invalid* the union was not recognized* because the union
could not be recognized by a contract unless it is a valid
contract»

So, therefore* I would say that the validity of the

contract is controlling in that case* but I have not thought
that through»

That's my initial reaction.

So* therefore* my point there is that the Board's
interpretation encourages employers to discriminate against
union members to make people drop union membership as a
condition of employment in order to prevent the union from
*

getting a majority status and* thereby* saying we can avoid
binding effect of a contract.
QUESTION:

8(b)(7) and 8(f) were enacted as part of

the same bill in 1959* were they not?
MR» BERGER:

I believe so* Your Honor* Mr» Justice

Stewart* but I am not positive.
QUESTION:

They certainly look in quite different

directions* don't they?
MR» BERGER:
QUESTION:
at the same time

Right* sir»
They were enacted by the same Congress

31

MR. BERGER:

Right, sir.

And the only consistent

explanation of that, we submit to the Court, is the explanation
that we, in our brief — that 8(f) carves out an exception to
the usual rules, the 9(a) rule, the 8(b)(7) rule —
QUESTION:

It clearly carves out an exception, and

the question in this case, I suppose, is how big is the
exception or what is the scope of the exception?
MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:
MR, BERGER:

Right, sir,
It clearly carves out an exception,
Yes, sir.

As opposition, that is, the Court of Appeals said,
the two Courts of Appeals, Third Circuit and District of
Columbia, that it would be an exercise in futility and it can't
conceive that Congress would go,on to say that an 8(f) contract,
with a minority, so to speak, union, before the union has
achieved its majority, It's legal and yet it can't be enforced,
QUESTION:

Could I ask you:

Does the record show

what conduct of the employer the union claimed was in breach
of the contract and which provoked the picketing?
MR. BERGER:

The employer refused to pay the wages

and wage scale and make contributions to the welfare and
pension funds that the employer had agreed to pay in its
contract,
QUESTION:
MR. BERGER;

So, it wasn't the refusal to bargain?
No, there was nothing to bargain,

32
Mr. Justice White.

The bargaining was accomplished when the

contract was signed.

But, on the other hand, I suppose it can

be argued that when an employer breaches a contract it is
refusing to bargain.
QUESTION:

I have no strong opinion on it.
Who were the beneficiaries of the pension

plan?
MR. BERGER:

All of the employees, including the non­

union employees.
QUESTI®:

Will you comment on one other practical

aspect I don't really understand here.

It occurs to me that

these contracts are of short duration in time because the jobs
are completed relatively quickly.

Is it a practical solution

for any of the interested parties to go for an election?
Because even if it takes a couple of weeks- maybe the job will
be completed.

Is this why nobody ever seeks the election?

Contracts don't take long enough to perform.
perhaps the real question:
the job?

And, isn't then

Who may you hire when you start

Rather than what remedy may be available after a

couple of weeks have gone by.
MR. BERGER:
If I may answer them.
but if the question is:

There were several questions there.
Some of these jobs are of short duration,
Who may you hire when you start?

If

an employer doesn't want to hire union members, or doesn't want
to pay the wages and working conditions that have been developed
protecting employees over the years, he doesn’t have to sign the

33
collective bargaining agreement with the union.

Or, even if

yon have an employer there now — Some of the jobs last for
\

a long time.

There are several going on in our area new inhere

they are constructing power houses# and that# which lasted two
and three years.

The reason-nobody bothers with an election

is that the union represents a majority of the employees.
The employer and the union agreed on the wages# hours and
working conditions and everybody is happy about it.

It's arm's-

length bargaining.
The Senate report# the committee report, again points
out that these contracts# themselves, are for a long period
')

because that gives stability in the construction industry.

If

a new contract had to be signed for every particular job., it
would lead to endless negotiations# and so forth.
I don't know if that answers your question.
QUESTION:
helps me.

One other thing that occurs to me.

I find this a Very puzzling case.

It

One other

problem# I suppose, is that in order to get the first job
signed up, lie's got to sign an area-wide agreement, and then
the problem arises in the subsequent jobs when he — but he
can't do it on simply a job by job basis when the union
represents the whole territory like that.
MR. BERGER:

Mr. Justice 3tevens# the employer does

not have to sign an area-wide agreement.
project agreements that are signed.

There are many

In some of the cases which

34
are cited in the brief, there were project agreements signed,
rather than area-wide agreements.

So whether an employer signs

an area-wide agreement depends on whether he is going to be in
the business in that area over a long period of time.

It

depends on the facts.
Another problem with the Board’s position, as I say,
is not only that it could and does encourage unfair labor
practices, as shown by this case, by the Local 150 case and
by the Dee Cee, that’s D-e-e C-e-e, case cited by the Board,
is the fast, too, that it would create — it would open a
pandora’s bo*: as far as administration, under the Act*

And it

would require an employer who signs an agreement itfifch an
employee — The employer says you don't have a majority.
The union says, "We do have a majority,"

If the union files —*

Joes it have to file an unfair labor practice?
file for an election?

Does it have to

The Act is silent on all that, whereas

the Act gives the explicit remedy that any time the employer
or the employee feels that the union is not representing a
majority of the employees they can petition for the election.
QUESTION:

This isn’t something new on the part of

the Board, is it?
MR. BERGER:

Mr. Justice White, what do you mean by

"This is not something new"?

QUESTION:

Board is grievously wrong on that.
QUESTION:

Didn’t the Board distinguish the peculiar

struction?

There is no Board ease that has that language.

decision to the kind of 8(f) agreements involved in this case.
That's misleading.

The 8(f) agreement in this case is the

same as the 8(f) agreement in Oil Field Maintenance Company
case.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose this case is a prime

example of the Board's refusal to extend Oil Field, since the
Board came out the way it did.

argument would then be over-extended.

I would say it is an

instance of the Board refusing to follow Oil Field, not extend

38
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OP NORTON J5 COME, ESQ. s
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
k

MR, COME:

)

I just have one point, Your Honor.

I would like to close by calling the Court 5s
attention again to the Garment Workers case in 366 U,S, 731o
That was the case that held that it was an unfair labor
practice for an employer and a union to enter into a contract
where the union did not have a majority, even though the parties
in good faith believed that they did, and that shortly there­
after the union did acquire a majority,

And the Court, not

only so held, but it went on to find that since that contract
was an unfair labor practice to enter into it» it was not

\

even enforceable with respect to the members of the union
only,

' & \v .

.:■ . • ‘

*

'

VJe submit that you have to look at what Congress did
against the backdrop of the Garment VIorkers case.
QUESTION:

How would it derogate the interests that

you think support your side of the case to hold the sub­
stantive provisions of the contract rather than the recogni­
tion provisions or the bargaining provisions to be enforceable
in a 301 suit?
i

As long as the union didn't purport to be
~

representing all the employees or demand that it be recognized
as such, why not permit the wage provision, for example, to be
enforceable

in the 3Q1 suit?

MR, GOME:

Offhand, I don't see too much of a

39
problem with that, but you do get to the point where hew much
of the contract is being enforced»
)

And If you get to enforcing

beyond that, then you run into the problem of recognition.
QUESTION;

Well, the union, apparently, was

complaining here about his failure to live up to the wage
and the welfare and pension agreements,
MR, COME:

Well, Your Honor, as we read the record,

the union is complaining about more than that.
whole contract applied.

They wanted the:

And, as a matter of fact, filed a

refusal to bargain charge with the Board xWben the employer
took the position that this project was a different project
|

and he had no obligation to recognize the union on that
project.

So, this is a recognition dispute, whatever may be

the answer in one where recognition is not sought.
The other point that 1 wish to make is that the
second proviso to 9(f) provides a means by which the contract
can be brought to an end, namely, petitioning for an election.
And the question is whether that is the only means.

There

again, we submit that the answer is afforded by locking at the
scheme of the Act.

And the scheme of the Act is that tra­

ditionally there have been two ways by which an employer can
withdraw recognition from a union.

He can either do that by

filing a petition under Section 9 of the Act, which is
explicit, or he can take his chances in an unfair labor
practice proceeding.

That is not specifically set forth in

40

the Act*

We submit that Congress did not intend to take away

that avenue from the employer, which is what happened in this
case»
QUESTION:

Mr, Come, how often would a situation

like we have in this case arise, as a matter of fact?
rarely, wouldn't it?

Very

Wouldn't normally an 3(f) contract be

complied with by both sides and wouldn’t it normally be
assumed that the employees represented were a majority of the
union that had made an 8(f) bargain in advance?
MRo COME:

I think that that is the normal situation.,

That's what Congress contemplated would happen»

And the

question is: How do you take care of the sport case?
there you have to balance 8(f) against 8(b)(7)(c),
Honor pointed out, the same Congress enacted it*

And
As Your

They look

in different directions„
VJe submit that the Board made a reasonable
accommodation here in the balance that it struck for the
sport or atypical ease.
QUESTION:

You mean that in the building Industry

it is normal for building contractors to prefer not to use
non-union labor?
MR, GOME:

Your Honor, I think that what has

happened is that there are several different parts of the
building and construction industry.

There is residential

construction where, as I understand it, it is not uncommon to

41
use non-union labor because they can't compete by using union
labor*

In big construction* commercial construction* that's

more unionized,

As a result of that* you've had the practice

of these double-breasted corporations being set up in the
building and construction industry where they operate union
on the big jobs and non-union on the small jobs*
really the problem in this case,

And this is

And there is nothing unlawful

under the Act in setting up these different —
QUESTION:

So* if we rule with you on this then we

will see more of that?
MR, COM3:

know the answer to that, Your Honor, because,as I pointed out
to Mr, Justice Stewart* the typical case is not this one,
