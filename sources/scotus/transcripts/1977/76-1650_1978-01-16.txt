MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

VI® will hear arguments

first this morning in No* 1550, Ohralik against the Ohio State
Bar Asscelation.
Mr. Grossman, you may proceed whenever you are ready»
ORAL ARGUMENT 0\? EUGENE GRESEMAN, ESQ* ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR* GRESSHAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the Court:
This case is her® on appeal from the Supreme Court of
Ohio, which ordered that the; appellant, Albert Ohralik, be
suspended indefinitely from the practice of law in Ohio on the
ground tint: ha did solicit and obtain retainer agreements from
two acci lent victims in violation of two sections of. the
Disciplinary Cede of Professional Responsibility, numbers
'103(A) and 104(A) , under ca-.on 2 of the Code.
It is important to understand the sol® and the
3 Court,
"-rere m.

to understand that

a single unitary charge and finding with respect to

the activities of this appellant-

The charge was that he did

solicit and did obtain agreement from these two individuals*
The find, .ng w

at ha did solicit and did obtain agreement

from these two individuals.
within th® eiabent

This falsa squarely, without more,

of thasa two disciplinary rules which in

offset prohibit «. lawyer from recommending his own employment

4
or accepting employment, from a layman who has not sought his
advice regarding the employment of an attorney»

So that based

upon that simple determination, the federal constitutional issue
was premised and raised in the court below, and it has been
accepted for review by this Court,

Two wit,:

Doss the First

Amendment entitle a lawyer to recommend his own employment or
to accept employment in the context, the simple context., of
giving unsolicited advice respecting the need for counsol and
respecting the desirability of taking legal action, of which
the prospective client may be ignorant?
Q

Does the charge require proof of advice with

respect to -the used for counsel?
HR, GRiSSMAN:

That is the way the disciplinary rule

reads.

Q
busjness.

So that it just is not the business of soliciting
Ha also says, "You should have a lawyer."

That is

involved here.
MR. GRFSSMANs

That is true.

That is essentially--

.it is a scrobination, I would suspect, of giving legal advice
abowfc the need.

Q

The need, and then recommending himself.

And in the

text, ©£

In this limited context I think our first point has to

this kind of solicitation of legal business.
reading the text of those disciplinary rules»

As I view it?
The elements

ar©, first? a truthful conveying of information concerning
the person’s possible legal rights and the conveying of
truthful information concerning his need for counsel.

The

second element that the lawyer speaks with a commercial or
profit-seeking element in mind.

He is soliciting business for

the sake of his personal pecuniary gain? as most lawyers do
practice law for pecuniary gain.
Thirdly? like many commercial solicitations? this one
may ba and is designed to bo somewhat persuasive in nature.

And? fourth, the element that has already been mentioned? that
ordinarilyaccording t© the rule? this kind of convey inc
information and solicitation is in the context of proffering
unsolicited legal advice ant; convoying the need for counsel ?
vary.-©tent counsel? to represent the individual in pursuit of
what may be his legal rights,

MR, GH3SSMAN:
ing of a doctc

An examinatior* of his—you mean? Btwsw ­
am not sura that doctors

6
aggressively sought their msdical practice in that manner.
Basically that would be essentially the same situation, I
would agree.
Q

Mr. Gressman, I think there are those who do.

MR. GRESSMAM:

If they do, I would say that it is

essentially the same situation.

I suppose there are many

doctors who may, in th>? company of their friends, notice a
medical problem that might encourage him to do exactly what
the Chief Justice suggests, that he come in for an axaminafelon.

That may done informally or otherwise.
Q

That this is done to some*extent in various areas

would be at least indicated by the fact that hospitals have
committees of surgeons

to monitor surgery to see whether

unnecessary surgery is being performed, do they not?
MR. GRESSMAM:

That is 'true.

And &fc the same time

we have nany programs that solicit individuals to have mad leal
examinations to check, their heart, to check possible cancer

•symptoms eiud what b»ve you.
Q
by it.

But not the by the person who is going to profit

Are you referring to the life insurance companies who

have instiiaition.nl ads suggesting—
MR. GRESSMAMs

Yes., I suppose in the medical field

you get mere of that in the organisational areas and that
individuals, doctors, are not as many in number compared to fens
types of organisations that would, you might say, solicit

7
medical treatment by unsuspecting victims of some defect.
In a real sense, therefore, it seems to me that the
action, the context in which this commercialized solicitation
does occur—to wit, that

freely giving legal advice and

recommendations of attorneys is really in the highest, tradi­
tion of the profession.

This may not be an ideal way of

obtaining legal business, aid certainly is not the only

way;

but. the freedom, the circumstance of discussing, conveying
legal information and advioa to those most in need of it is a
situation that I think warrants commendation rather than
condemnation and leads to ray next point as to what it is about
this kind of solicitation that has encouraged the wrath and
the prohibition by the organized bar of this solicitation.

Q

Mr. Gres&man, let me interrupt.

Your reference

to the highest, tradition .of the profession makes me pans® just
i inutc-.

Would it be in the highest tradition of the profes­

sion for a prosecutor to give legal advice to a criminal

defsndanb freely?
MR. GRESSMAN :

I would say in given situations that

might b® true.
Q

Do you seem tom© problem about a prosecutor

acting as counsel
MR. GRESSMAN:

he is prosecuting?
If he is doing it in terras of

precis© case he is prosecuting, that is one thing.

the

I was

suggesting only that ha might give an Individual advice about a

8

col2.f}Js€xal e : \m:,zIn/bnc legal problem which he is not directly
involved in.
Q

The thing yo'i are trying to avoid is the conflict

of intereat.
MR. GRESSMAN;

That is right.

That is another

problem.
Q

Do you r.ot see a conf lict of interest between

an unemployed lawyer, volunteering free legal advice about the
merits ©f a case, purportedly in the interests of the client,
when he is also acting in his own self-interest to try to
persuade the client to employ him?
MR. gr:-3SS1-;an %

1 do not believe that is the ordinary

fi ’-sa. in i filch wo use iha torrn "conflict of interest" or in

which

? disciplinary cede uses that concept.
Q

..

la that not -ihe underlying reason why the lawyer

uld not mix up his own self-interest by giving advice when

ho Is supposed to be disinterested?
MR. GRESSMAN:

I -diink that if you accept that

.■ -:tc.inn , Mr, Justice Stevens, that would moan that no lawyer
should taka a case where ha has discussed with the client who
has ccnn to him the advisability of instituting legal suit of
some soiifc.

Because inevitably, if this solicitation or rather

this «dvi4>:3 i.y sought in thss first instance by th© client
himself, the lawyer may inevitably have his own self-interest
and may give advice that will promote his own interest in

9
obtaining that caso»

I thl ik that is an inevitable situation

whan you 'nave the lawyers talking t© clients.
f

Would not the consultation itself in Mr. Justice

Stevens* hypothetical be paid for so that the lawyer is not
having to seek gains only by further employment?
MR. GRSSSfcANs

He may be paying for that, initial

consultation or he may not.
Q

I3 that not 'A© custom of the profession?

You

do not just walk into &. lawyer's office and say* !EI have got a
problem.

And after you toll., mo what my problem is. and what I

should do about it, maybe I will decide to retain you."
Q

But it does not breach the canons of ethics if

ha dees not charge, does it?
MR. G.RES1KA?: t

;,o

I frankly have giver that type

r.f fz%'L ac! vie® nuny tdmas m3'self to .individuals who come to -m.
with a problem.

"Should I t.;ik© my case to the Supreme Court?"

Ask wJ th v.t charging thum
of that.

ything, X will gives

my estimation

So, it could be a consultation fee or it could not.
Q

Is not the fundamental difference in these

hypothot 1 cals th© snaanar in which the relationship began?

In

••lbs ore cs.se th® client has gone to the lawyer to solicit his
Mvice.

In tli® other, the lawyer has gone to the client and

volunteered for this-MR. GRESSMAN?
Your Honor, yes.

T3u,t is essentially th© difference,

And I think that what happens after that is-

10
' likely to be fairly identic: 31 in nature,

Q

Is there any prohibition against, the insurance

company lawyers talking to him?

I always thought the. answer

was they did not chase the ambulance.
MR. GRESSMAN:
Q

Plenty of them do.

[Laughter]

That is right.

MR. GRESSMAN:

That is one of the ironies of this .

situation., Ycur Honor,

Q

And there is nothing in the Ohio rules that

covers that at all?

MR. GRESSMAN:

la: us say that an insurance lawyer may

not go into the hospital ro-xn and seal?, to settle a case with a
victim, no.
It seem.? to ire that the evil—or what ie the cause
fur this.i.:-

rationale for this disciplinary prohibition of

.

solicit.fi::..on is not in

terms of its communicative aspects.

They arc not really objecting to this lawyer convoying to the
prospective client advice about his legal rights, nor are they
really objecting to his soliciting his own employment or
!

nation about his own availability as counsel in
the situation.

Certainly they are not objecting to a system,

imperfect though it may be, by which legal representation is
accorded an individual who might not otherwise either know of
his legal rights or have counsel available to him.

No, we must

turn rather to what this Court turned to in the-. Bates decision

11
last term about the historical basis of the rules against
advertising by attorneys which, not. strangely enough, have the
same historical source as the ban on solicitation.

And that is

•that the ban on solicitation, like the ban on advertising,
originated in the inns of court of England as a matter of
etiquettes, that the barristers, simply as gentlemen of the bar,
do not seek to compete with each other? they do not seek to
solicit, to advertise, to act as ordinary tradesmen act.
Q

Of course barristers in England—maybe it has not

always been so—but as 1 understand it, do not. communicate with
clients .at all,
MR. CHESSMAN:

That is true.

But they still have tha

rule against advertising and soliciting which has been the
source from which v/e have inherited the concepts egainat.
advertising.
3

Q

It is an entirely different setting.

MR. CHESSMAN:

That is true. They have, what you would

call—Q

Her® it is a relationship between «. lawyer and a

client, and a barrister in England- does not have any relation­
ship directly—
MR. CRESS MAN •
Q

Trv .0 .

—between himself and a client but only with a

solicitor.
MR. CRESSMAN:

But he has a very rigid rule of

12

etiquette that would prohibit him even from attempting to
contact a client.
Q

They just naver do.

MR. CHESSMAN;

That is right.

But what is significant

about this, as it was in the Bates case, is that this was
developed in England as a matter of etiquette and to this vary
day the ban on solicitation with respect to barristers in
England—and I have cited this pamphlet in my brief—is
contained in a pamphlet put out by the Inner Temple,, addressed
to the barristers, entitled 'Conduce and Etiquette at the'Bar."
In other words, this was a basic matter of good
manners end etiquette as to how a lawyer should conduct himself
vis-a-vis other attorneys.
Q

Do not. the sitsne rule*.? of solicitation apply to

solicitors, in England?
Miu GP.ESSMMfs

I assume they do, and they probably

inherited this notion too from- the original rules of etiquette.
Q

They inherit!*3 it, but they have no connection

with the inns of court, do they?
HE. GRESSMAM:

Ho, but I think the same etiquette,

the same manners, in this sense have been adopted by the
rolicitore as wall,

An3 Haary Drinker's great volume on legal

ethics, the prime authority in this field, has noted this in
no uncertain terms, that these rules that we now have in the
Cod© of Professional Responsibility are largely derived from,

13
inherited from,, what ctn only ba described--and was described
by this Court last tent; in dates—-as Matter of legal etiquette.

MR. GRES8MAN;
Q

Right.

I mean, but chey are real claims--

MR. GRESSMAN:
Q

Right.

Do you think a lawyer who is trained as an

advocato, or presumably trained as an advocate, dealing with a
lay person in the hospital or in sickbed or whatever, is
engaged in an arm's length transaction where the two parties,
the person being solicted a:id the person doing th© soliciting
are on the same parity?
MR. GRESSMAN:

No,

I do not think, in fcha first

place, any lawyer is on th® same parity with a layman.
Q

His much more skilled at persuading, is ha not?

MR. GRESSMAN:

Of course.

He is supposed to be.

And

that is why he is in the business of practicing law, among
•other reasons.

But that doe.3 not man that he should not

remote those qualities in .Appropriate situations where he does
uot ovezrmch himself, where* he does not incur any of tha
ut.i-T-ndav.t evils that mnv &r:-.3e out of taking advantage of an
individual who is not in, say, full control of all of his
faculties«.

That, is another problem.
Q

How do wa.know he is not overreaching himself?

solicit.-; fcion occurs and is permit-bad where there is no element
of over rtf idling.

That is not an inherent part of these

15
disciplinary prohibitions that w© are dealing with here.

By

thsir very terms, they carva out an exception for soliciting
your

close friends f your relatives, your former clients, and

those whom we reasonably may think is a client.
Q

No, this is—

Mr. Grossman, that is not quite right, is it?

The exception is from 104(h

There is no exception in 103.

MR. GRESSMAN:

So, we do not krow what they meant to apply to

which si-nation or not.

I v. auld say though that if you were to

agree that there was protected speech here, I think the same
result would have to follow under 104, that the. result of that
speech# the formation of a retainer agreement* was also a pro­
tected activity because I tat not sure that in any of the
decided cases in this court respecting solicitation that they

17
have mad© that kind of distinction*, that they have dealt with
the whole unitary action known as solicitation—that is* the
us© of speech and communication to advise and thereupon obtain
retainer agreement.

So* 1 think there can be no constitutional

distinction between those two elements.
That leads me. directly to the First Amendment implica­
tions of these acts of solicitation as I have described them.
There are two lines of casas that I think justify the conclusion
that this is protected activity.
course * sts

The first line of cases* of

• with NA£.€P v , Button.

And indead tails Court

held in Button that solicitation is not only outside the area
of freedom protected by the First Amendment and that First
Amendment cannot be ignored under the guise of prohibiting
professional misconduct.

That is almost the complete answer to

this con stltutfonal qr.est.ion posed to you in this case.

There

has to b»j under that formulation of constitutional doctrine
in the Button css®* there has to bo an area of freedom to solicit
that is protected by the First Amendment.
Q

Then your submission would necessarily apply to

every profession* would it not?

You could not grant this

freedom of speech to lawyers and deny it to doctors and
dentists «nd—
MR. GRESSMMJs

x think -those are the next cases

perhaps* but you have alreucy granted that kind of freedom say
to the phcrmacist-s in the Virglnla Pharmacy case.

1 recognize that

But I say there is no

within th© First Amendment that would

giv© an organisation greater First Amendment rights t© solicit

Q

The dissentars in those cases thought so too, 1

think.
MR. GRKSSM&Ns

In one of fcherie cases—I think it was

19
th© United Mine Workers case—and th© Court was dealing in all
these cases both with the organization and with the individual
attorneys, some of whom h«d bean charged, I assumef with
violations of the Professional Code of Ethics»

But, in the

Brotherhood of Railroad Trainman, at 337 US at page 8, th®

unanimous opinion, as I recall,

Mr» Justice Black, writing

that "Lawyars accepting employment"--these were retainer

Q

May I ask you a question right there?

MR. CRESSMAN;
Q

Yes.

I think this record indicates that tap®

recorders were used by your client without divulging to these
two young ladies that they were being used.

Does that suggest

to you the danger of overreaching in this sort of activity?
MR. GRESSMANs

That is of course not this subject of

any determination, finding, or charge.

That, is not the basis

on which this case arose.
Q

You would concede a state interest in protecting

unsophisticated people from overreaching by members of the bar,

MR. GRES SHAM:

I sst not for on© minute suggesting that

reasonably drawn rules might b© drafted controlling the time,
place, and manner in which solicitations may be made.
Q

Could that bn elude a requirement that the client

have con:»?el before any agr«ament of the employment was signed,

MR. GRESSMANs

Tlict could well be.

that you might require that the contract itself b

We have

We have had the ban on adver­

And w© never know about, we never enforce it, until a.

complaint, until some evil ensues that makes it evident and
makes it possible therefore to enforce.

And so in this case

the prim5 concept, and idea X want to leave with this Court is
that it -s constitutionally insufficient with respect to
restricting the First Amendment freedom, recognizing the
Button case, to say, "Well, this is so likely to produce
misrepresentation, contrary interest, deceit, fraud, or .what­
ever ©Iso may be conceived of."

I do not.believe that the First

hius:idmant can be swept «aside with articulated but unfounded

situation that we are speaking of.

Do you think a state can prevent a lawyer from •

financing litigation?
KR. CHESSMAN:

I think with properly drawn rules, yes.

I know, but that is purely prophylactic.

Why

j'lld it not have to prove actual fraud or misrepresentation
or something?
PR. CHESSMAN::

Q

That is not etiquette, is it?

MR. CHESSMANs

No, Your Honor j that may be the

22
differine®, on© of the major differences.

Every other aspect

of -the Professional Code relates to what you might call malum
in s®, something that is inherently wrong, something that
inherently justifies the imposition of the state s interest.

I suggest that state interest, however, cannot bo, grounded on
speculation and fear because we have adequate rules, and we
can add more rules, to take car® of each of these anticipated
fears that can arise from the solicitation concept.

,
I would like first to address the question of the

n.a.ttar ?>£ the proceedings in tho court below, in the C-uprone
Court of Ohio.

There are some misimpressions that may be

gained from what is said it the briefs.
First, the Supremi. Court of Ohio has sole and
exclusive jurisdiction as to what ®r© the facts in a
disciplinary matter and what th& discipline should be.

When

a complaint is filed against an attorney such as Mr. Ohralik,
it is heard by a board of commissioners, a panel of three of
tha board cf commissioners •

They make findings of fact and

What, they find as fact and what they

recommend has no bearing whatsoever from there or..

It is for

the guidance of the Supreme Court of Ohio of course, but the
Supreme Court of Ohio, I repeat, has sole and exclusive
jurisdiction as to what tie findings of fact are and as to
what the discipline should foe.

So, where it is referred to

in tha brief that the—appellant's brief—that the board of
commissioners made certain findings with respect to the
relinquishment of the conto‘acts, they found it was not
unethical for the appellant to cling to his contracts.

There

was no finding on that matter by tha Supreme Court of Ohio.
Q

How are the commissioners appointed?

MR, WELCH?

The;/ ar*» appointed by the court,- the

Supreme Court of Ohio, and there era 17 districts; and on®
member is appointed from eiich district, and they rotate, the
court as to who will appoint the next member—
Q

And tli® appellee, your client, in this case is

tha Ohio state Bar Association, which was the what—the
charging party?
MR. WELCH:
charging party.

The fhio State Bar Association was the

Fa brought, the charges against Mr. Qhralik,

and I think it is worthy ox repeating that vra charged him with

24
in-hospital solicitation—it
the on© young woman.

is set forth in the charge—of

And the other young woman was charged

with—ha was charged with soliciting the other young woman in
her hone.

And the Suprema Court of Ohio found an fact that

those solicitations did occur where it was alleged, and they
found ether facts in addition to those.
Q

But the commissioners are agents and officers

of th© Supreme Court of Ohio rather than of the Ohio State
Bar Association; is that correct?
MR. WELCH;

They are agents of the Supreme Court of

Ohio f y as, Your Honor, and have no connection with the Ohio
State Bar Association whatroever.
Q

War® both the conversations—that is, in the

hospital and in th© hora—lap© recorded or just the one in the
home?
MR. WELCH;

Just th© one in the home of Wanda Lou

Holbert was tape recorded.

She was the second young woman.

But th© other tap® recording was made with the parents of
Carol McClintock on the same day in which the appellant
solicited Carol McClintock in the hospital.
The Supreme Court of Ohio did not refer to that
tap© recording at all.

It was submitted as evidence, and the

decision.' of the Court makes no mention of the second or the
one with the parents of Carol McClintock.
whatsoever of that, tape recording.

It makes no r&rhion

25
Appelle©—we would like to make it clear to the
Court in speaking to the due process matter that is alleged
in the complaint, that w©

in no way intended to transform

th® charges against the appellant in this Court.
do not intend to allege a»' charges.

That is, we

No question but that he

was disciplined in the court below for violation of the two
disciplinary rules cited by the court, and it was for solicit­
ing and obtaining agreements to represent the two young women.
However, the court, as l have indicated,mad© findings of fact
that ar© incorporated in their decisions•
in a vacuum.

They do npt operate

The charges ware mad© that the solicitation :

made in the hospital, and the court has found—
Q

Mr. welch, ±3 there any punishment for solici­

tation clone?
MR. WELCH:

in

Ohio there is.

The General Assembly

of Ohio has spoken for many years that solicitation by an
attorney such as Mr. Ohralik is against public policy.
3

Has anyoas bean punished for it, for solicita­

tion alone?
MR. WELCH:
Q

Not within my knowledge as—

So, the two are really tied together, are they

not?
MR. WELCH;
Q

The two are really tied together?

Yss, sir.

MR. WELCH;

Yss,

The Ohio State Bax Association,

26
Your Henor,

to answer that question, never mad© a charge of

criminal solicitation.

They would rather take disciplinary

actions„
We do not, as I have said, intend to transform these
charges against the appellant.

We have no intention whatso­

ever .
Q

If the soliciting lawyer had used, as some

of them traditionally have, photostatic copies cf checks in
prior ssitfciements they mado for other clients and perhaps
testimonial letters from

clients, would that under Ohio

practice be the subject of a special finding, or would that
simply be regarded as evidence in support of the general
finding?
HR. WELCH:
M' ,

tbi

■Ilu-ll:

It would be my judgment on that,

il ;11 it would b£- incorporated in fchu general

alXegai Ira.> that it. would '>3 evidence of hot/ he solicited,
the mariner, and what he did, just the same as in tills case,
at indicated by the findings of tbs court; below, they mads a
number of findings that
:nuC3 indicates that these things
did occur, such as the.

suit after against Carol McClintock,

after the solicitation had occurred.

The court makes a

specific finding on that, -end they make specific findings
with respect to the feet that Wanda Lou Holbert discharged
the appellant after she had. had time to reflect upon the matter

27

overnight and had talked with her mother about it.
after the solicitation.

That is

So, of course it is our position

that that is incorporated in the general charge, although the
charge is specific as t© time and place.
In essence, appellant is arguing here, as I understand
it and as l understand his brief, that there is need for some
state regulation of a lawyer.

Nevertheless, he says that the

Ohio rules are overbroad and inhibit objectionable as well as
unobjectionable conduct,

’la also argues that appellant's

conduct was- unobjectieii&ble, irmoosnt, pure, benign, perhaps
other labels ha puts on thn conduct..

However, it is—and he

also arguas that there is no harm don© to the clients in this
ere© <zc d that there; is no stated cn.npell5.ng interest by the

court

balow.
It is our position -that the record plainly demon­

strates that the appellant's -conduct poses precisely the
dangers that support the Ohio rules,

it is clear, we beliavej

the purpose ef the disciplinary rules,
OF 2-103 (A) and DR 2-104 (/i , are to eliminate or at least to
reduce to the great®,ct extant possible the injury to potential
clients that is caused by solicitation.
Xr; other words, 'the rules have as their purpose the
•protection of th® public from the harm and the dangers of

r

hb :h flew from comraonjial solicitation.
Furthermore, it

, a - I have indicated, the public

28
policy of Ohio, as expressed through its General Assembly,
that commercial solicitation is prohibited.

Secondly, even

if there are some conceivable situations that the rules
challenged by appellant may be deemed to be overbroad, the
appellant should not ba permitted to avail himself of the
overbreadth doctrine as expressed in Bates to secure reversal
of the judgment of the court below.

In Bates this Court held

that tha justification for the overbreadth analysis applies
weakly, if at all, in. the ordinary commercialcontext, and
declined to apply it to professional advertising, a context
where thcs Court said it is not necessary to further its
intended objective.

The Court said since advertising is linked

'to coitEtii-rcial wall being, at seems unlikely that such speech
is pari-iralfftly auseoptlb: :•
regulations.

to cuing crushed by overbroad

And since solicitation is similarly linked to

tvivmarcinl well being and as a practice that is to more
deserving of First Amendment protection than commercial
advertising, we submit that the appellant should not bn able
to avail himself of the overbreadth doctrine.
Q

Mr. Welch, if 1 may interrupt you, you spoke a

few moments ago of the Ohio State Legislature and its policy.,

MR. WELCH:
Q

Yes.

.My understanding is "--and you toll ms if 1 am

mistaken—that the Coda of Professional R
was promulgated by the Supreme Court of Ohio.

>nsibility in Ohio

29
MR. WELCH:

Yess, that is correct,

Not by the legislature* that is correct?

q

MR, WELCH:

Not by the legislature but by the

Supreme; Court of Ohio—
Q

And is--

MR, WELCH:
me* Your Honor.

—and the constitution of Ohio.

Excuse

The constitution of Ohio mandates—-gives

that responsibility for admission and discipline to the
Supreme Court of Ohio,
Q

The, state constitution explicitly confers that

authority on the Ohio Supreme Court?
HE. WELCH;

Explicitly Confers that authority* yes,

Your Honor.
Q

An there ary state statutes bearing on it?

MR. WELCH:
Q

in tie

matter of solicitation?

Either on the matter of authorising the Court

to do it or substantively c*n the matter of solicitation.
MR, WELCH:

There are sens statutes that deal with

other matters involving the court and may—there is one
judges, Your Horor, yes, where the legislature

luvolviug

did pass lews asking the Supreme Court of Ohio to promulgate
rules for inquiries about the competency and sa forth of
judges.

And the Supreme Court of Ohio has promulgated

separat*, rules covering that subject.
Q

But there are no state laws—by that I mean

30

enacted by the stales legislature—bearing direct'.y or
affecting this case?
MR. WELCH:

Yes, Your Honor, there are laws still on

the books—I believe it is Chapter 47 of the Ohio Revised
Cede—that ar© still on the books that were on the books before
the Supreme Court of Chic was given const! tution?Ll authority
over admissions and discipline, and they have just remained
on the books.
Q

Is it generally understood in Ohio that the

Supremo Court's actions supersede those old statutes?
MR. WELCH:

Yes.

Yesr X think that they ar© merely

an aid of, I think the way the court expresses it now, if
the Court: wishes to consult: them.

3ut we never bring any

charges based upon statutes.
Q

Always the Cisde of Professional Responsibility.

MR, WELCH:

Always "under the Code of Professional

Respcnsibility»
Q

And when wai it—

MR. WELCH:

Promulgated October 5, 1970.

And the

rules that hares are under consideration ware then promulgated,
became effective October 5th.
Q

And they wore modeled on—with soma modifica­

tions—on the rules proposed by the American Bar Association
committee?
MR. WELCH:

They exe modeled on those.

And there are

31
other instances, not pertinent her©, where we have—the Ohio
Code, is not the same as the American Bar Association code.
Q

But these are identical?

MR. WELCH:

These are identical with the American

Bar Association rules» at least at the time when this occurred..
Q

When did thu State of Ohio give rvil@-me.king

power, the legislature or -die constitution, to the Supreme
Court, about '57 or ‘58?
MR. WELCH:

It. in more recent than that, Your Honor.

I would say the Ohio constitution was amended, giving this
power to the Supreme Court • in the late sixties, perhaps as

lata

968.
Q

That is, rules of civil and criminal procedure?

mr. welcht

xm.

Yes, Your Honor.

And the control

over admissions and disciplina of lawyers.
There is on® other matter that, is brought to the
Court*s attention for whicl we do not apologize, but we

recognise that it is not. a part of the record of this case.
And it has to do with the. finding of fact of the court below
as t;' the testimony of the appellant in the proceedings in the
court hi*3cw—tastimony of the appellant that he would abandon

his cl

l!:J*it rot bean 'twice stated in

jurist .cidonal statement and

in his main brief, that testimony of the appellant—-we would
act. have made any statement about it whatsoever»

But it is

important we think for ths Court to note in considering the
First Amendment argument auide here that the appellant did sue
Wanda Sue Bolbert four days after he' had testified that he
would sue her or that he would abandon his claim against her—
only two business days, as a matter of fact»

The hearing

concluded on a Thursday, ar.d there was a Friday, and the suit
was filed the next Monday.

We think that candor on this

matter should have impelled the appellant to disclose in his
brief that the cult was filed.
Q

That was filed after the hearing on the

di s cip Unary matter ?

MR. WELCH:

There is.

Dobs the public record show that.he appeared

33
pro 3®, or did someone else represent him?
MR. WELCH:
Q

He was represented.

I was just wondering if it is conceivable that

some lawyer went ahead and filed a -suit without being aware
of the testimony.

Do we know that, it had been prepared in

advance «ind there was some failure of communications?
MR. WELCH:

W® do not have that knowledge.

I would

say that it. is my recollection that he did have an .attorney*
Q

Does fchfi record tell us whether anything

happened other that; the filing of the complaint?
MR. WELCH:
Q

I am sorry, I did not understand.

. Do the public records tell us whether' anything

happened beyond the filing of, the complaint itself on the
following Monday?
MR. WELCH:

Mr, Ohralik, yes.

But £ thought tha claim was filed by Ohralik.

"O’Reilly."

Oh, Ohralik.

I am sorry.

34
MR, WELCH:
Q

The appellant.

Yes.

MR. WELCH:

This record-—the appellant has failed

to demonstrate that his conduct is entitled to First
Amendment protection.

His commercial solicitation of the two

young worsen served his interest, not their interest.

And his

conduct was such as to harm them rather than to help them.
We believe that the state has a legitimate interest in
preventing that type of cot duct and protecting the citizens
of Ohio from such solicitation.
That is all 1 have, Mr. Chief Justice.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Thank you, gentlemen.
