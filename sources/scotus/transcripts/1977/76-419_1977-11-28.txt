MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear arguments

v. Natural Resources Defense Council, and the consolidated

Mr. Dig nan, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP THOMAS G. DIGRAM, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER, VERMONT YANKEE NUCLEAR
POWER CORPORATION
MR, DIGRAMs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
\

the Courtz
I represent Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corporation,
the petitioner in No. 76-419, and my argument will be confined
to that case and the issues which are raised therein.
This matter comes before this Court on a writ of
certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit.

That court has before it two

actions of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
First, the action of that Commission in granting an
operating license to the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station,
a nuclear electric generating station located in Vernon,
Vermont, and owned by my client, Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power
Corporation, the petitioner.
In addition, it had before it the promulgation by
that agency of a regulation which for the first time permitted

in individual react o:

licensing cases limited consideration of

the enviromental effects of the separately licensed and lo­
cated facilities where the various matters such as reactor
fuel manufacturing and reprocessing and waste disposal activi­
ties taka place.

These activities are sometimes referred to

and I will refer to them as the fuel cycle activities.
By its judgment, the United States Court of Appeals
struck down the agency's regulation on the ground that insuf­
ficient procedures had been utilized in its promulgation.

The

court also remanded the agency decision authorizing the issu­
ance of an operating license to Vermont Yankee on the grounds
that issuance of any such license had to be preceded by what
the court called a thorough ''ventilation*' of the environmental
effects of the fuel cycle activities.
Now, though procedurally complex and as laid out in
detail in our brief at pages 11 through 25, this case I respect-*
fully submit is substantively quite simple.

The result below

was —•
QUESTION;
you a question.

Before you proceed, Mr, Dignan, may I ask

The respondents say in their supplemental

statement of facts that your client, Vermont Yankee, has now
been granted an operating license and that the time to seek
review of that license has expired without a petition for
review being filed.
MR. DIGNAN;

Is that correct?
Mr. Justice Stewart, we have an operating

6

license but that, operating license at this time is good for 18
months only# to wit, the duration of the so-called interim
rule which the Commission has adopted.

I do not foaliave this

case is moot, which is being suggested by this late filed
brief, because when Vermont Yankee went into the Court of
Appeals, Vermont Yankee had a full-term forty-year license.

We

have a license now under this interim rule but -—
QUESTION;

When, you came out of the Court of Appeals,

you had nothing?
MR. DIGNAMs

We came out of the Court of Appeals, we

had a remand of the decision authorizing the license.
QUESTION;
MR. DIGNAN:

And now you have a license?
Now we have a license, which license is

given to us under the interim rule which self-destructs in 3.8
months, therefore I do not —QUESTION;
MR. DXGNANs

And at the end of 18 months?
The question then will be whether or not

there is a new rule in place as to whether Vermont Yankee's
license would continue or whether the Commission takas seme
other actio: .

ut it is our position that Vermont Yankee had

a good forty-year license

and that this Court

shouId enforce that initial decision of the Commission, that
Vermont Yankee should not have to litigate further for its' full
term license.
1

I believe this case is quite

7
simple substantively.

To begin with, the Court of Appeals

struck down an agency regulation on the basis that the National
Environmental Policy Act is to be construed as in effect
amending the Administrative Procedure Act to require all
agencies to provide more than the notice and comment proceedings called foz' in 5 U.S. Code„ section 553, in any rulemaking
proceedings which affect the environmental responsibilities of
the agency.
Second, the Court of Appeals remanded the petitioner’
license as the result of a holding that the National Environ­
mental Policy Act should he read as amending the Atomic Energy
Act in substance by saying that the technical and economic
resolution of the so-called high-level nuclear waste question
should be undertaken and indeed essentially resolved as to
methodology prior tc the issuance of any more reactor licenses.
Now, third, the Court of Appeals accomplished all of
this through the device of utilizing extra record evidence
which was never presented to the agency in either the Vermont
Yankee case or the rulemaking proceeding? indeed, it consisted
of articles that were written afifcer the rule was promulgated
and in one case after the case was argued to the Court, of
*

Appeals which were utilised to set up a conflict with there­
tofore uncontested expert testimony of an agency staff member.
And having done that, the Court of Appeals then held that the
rule was not well supported as

cl

result of procedural

8
misfeasance.
Now, we believe the decision to be in error for a
number of reasons, as set forth in our brief.

In the first

place, I respectfully suggest that this decision is flatly
contrary to the Administrative Procedure Act and the National
Environmental Policy Act as interpreted by this Court.
In its decision, the Court of Appeals admits that the
requirements of section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act
t

were exceeded in this case, and indeed they, of course, were.
There was an opportunity for comment.

There was an oral hear­

ing, an opportunity for comments on the comments, and an oppor­
tunity after that for comments on the comments on the comments.
QUESTION:

By exceeded, you mean there, was more than

adequate compliance?
MR. DIC4NAN;
QUESTION:

That is our view, Mr. Justice Stewart.
And that you say was the Court of Appeals5

view?
MR. DIGNAN:

Well, the Court of Appeals said that we

V
exceeded the requirements of section 553 but that that was not
enough to comply with the Act.

And it is our belief that the

prior decisions of this Court have indicated, that section 553
means precisely what, it says.
Also this Court has indicated that the National
Environmental Policy Act cannot be read as amending other
statutes, and therefore to the extent that the court, below was

9
saying that the National Environmental Policy Act works was
essentially an amendment, of the Administrative Procedure Act, I
believe the decisions of this Court in the scrap cases pre­
cludes such a holding.
We also submit that this decision transgresses the
rulings of this Court in the recent Kieppe case.

The Kleppe

decision stands for the proposition that feasibility and prac­
ticality have to govern in some respect the working of the
National Environmental Policy Act and the scope of an agency's
responsibility thereunder.
As is clear from this record, two boards of this
agency, both of which had a majority, two members who were
technically trained people, found that it was essentially a
practical impossibility to consider in detail in an individual
reactor licensing proceeding the activities that would take
place at a fuel cycle proceeding yet to be applied for.
In addition, these two boards ruled as a matter of
law that the proposal before them, as that term is used in NEPA,
was the licensing of Vermont Yankee, not the licensing of these
other facilities? therefore, these boards ruled., we need not
get into this at all.
I respectfully suggest those rulings, though much
consistent with this Court's ruli
in the Kleppe case.
We also maintain

:hat thi

Lsi

10
contravenes a long history which shows an intent in Congress
that the solving of the so-called high-level waste problem is
not a matter that must precede the issuance of reactor licenses.
This is laid out in our brief in sane detail, but it is clem:
that what this Court wanted was the waste problem to foe solved.
And I would note that at page 78 of the appendix,
Judge Tamm says it flatly.

Ha says, "I agree with the

majority that NEPA requires the Commission fully to assure
itself that safe and adequate storage methods are technologic­
ally and economically feasible."
And I suggest to this Court that the history in
Congress is that Congress has been aware since 1954 that the.
final selection and the final decisions in this matter have
not been made and Congress has made no move to stop the
licensing of reactors.
Now, essentially what is argued in response to these
various arguments:

In response to Mr. Justice Stewart earlier,

I addressed this question of whether the cases become moot.
A second argument that is made to this Court is this
is just a record case, that the court below just found the
record inadequate and it is really not worthy of this Court's
attention.
I can only quote what the court itself said the issue
before it was.,

It said, "Thus we are called upon to decide

whether the ‘procedures provided by the agency were sufficient

11

to ventilate the issues."

That is what they thought they were

deciding in the rulemaking case, and I submit that that is
what they did decide and decided it erroneously.
QUESTION:

You would concede, would you not, Mr.

Dignan, that there is some ambiguity in the opinion of the
Court of Appeals, particularly whan viewed in the light of the
concurring opinion?
MR. DIGNAN;

I would be less than candid with this

Court if I did not admit that this opinion admits of different
readings by different people.

On the other hand, I would re­

mind this Court that to let this decision stand, I respectfully
suggest, means chaos in the administrative process of the
United States at this tine, not only in this agency but in
other agencies, because no agency can now be sure precisely
what it must go through in order to promulgate a valid rule.
QUESTION;

In order to have sufficient ventilation

and. sufficient dialogue?
MR. DIGNAN;

If ventilation even be a. requirement,

ventilation in this opinion to be is one of the most catchy
words that is about to find its way into American jurisprudence,
and I -think it should not be allowed to because I don’t know
how to construct this ventilator, and I am not sure that anyone.
at an agency will know precisely how to construct this
ventilator.
QUESTION

iertaihly think it is the

12

agency's job to construct it, 1 gather, rather than the court?
MR. DIGNANs

No, I think the ventilator has been

constructed by the Congress, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION?

Well, I know, but you wouldn’t think that

the agency broke the law by going through the procedures it
went through here for the rulemaking?
MR. DIGNAN:

Mo, I think the agency complied fully

with the law, Mr. Justice.
QUESTIONS

Yes.

Well, more than that, it went

farther, you say, than it was required»
MR. DIGNAN:

That is correct, and therefore this is

why we think this decision is in error.
QUESTION:

Mr. Dignan, supposing that the Court

should conclude that you are right on the procedural issue but
that the record was inadequate on the question of waste dis­
posal , what should the Court do?
MR. DIGNAN:

Insofar as my client is concerned, Mr.

Justice, I think a remand with a direction to affirm the
Vermont Yankee decision is in order certainly, because my
client's right to that license I suggest doss not depend on
valid rule.

I think our license was validly issued without the

rule.
If the Court concludes there is a problem with the
record, I think the most

that should be done is to ask the

agency for a farther statement of baser and purposes, because

13
I think that is the only record required.
In notice and comment, it may well be that no com­
ments are made., so what the Congress must have intended is that
the statement of basis and purpose be all right as far as a
reviewing court is concerned.

So I think the most that is

necessary here is a remasid for further explanation.
QUESTION;

An agency certainly doesn’t have to

marshal its own evidence under a notice and comment proceeding,
does it?

It is presumed to have the expertise.
MR. DIGNAN:

I believe that is correct, Mr. Justice,

it is not required to marshal it, and it is not required to
answer every single statement that is made to it either by
somebody outside the agency, and I think that that is another
danger in this decision.
What this decision means is that if any person comes
in with any difference of opinion, he can send a federal
agency into years of study to strike down what they in their
expert judgment have already decided is not necessary to
consent.
QtESTIGM;

Well, has the agency done anything since

the Court of Appeals opinion to effect the adequacy of its
record?
MR. DIGNAM

i

What the agency has done is hold an

interim rule proceeding which really consisted of a further
literature search.

They certainly have engaged in no additional

14
procedures, Mr. Justice, but they have had an additional liter­
ature search which backs up this new interim rule.

This inter­

im rule, as is clear from the briefs, is on appeal in the
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit.

It is also on appeal because of the Vermont Yankee

decision and the Seabrook decision, has brought to the First
Circuit.

I would imagine the First Circuit will hold in

abeyance until such time as either this Court speaks or the
D.C. Circuit speaks after this Court speaks.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose we agreed with you on the

procedures, but then there is the question of the adequacy of
the record, and there is a further proceeding going on now in
the Court of Appeals with respect to the validity of the
int er im ru le?
MR, DIGNAN:

A petition for review has been filed

and at the request of the petitioners in that case is being
held in abeyance until this Court acts.
QUESTION:

Why should we address ourselves to a situ­

ation that no longer exists?

I mean, the record that the Court

of Appeals in this case spoke about is not the record that now
exists.
MR. DIGNAN:

As far as Vermont Yankee is concerned,

of course, Mr. Justice White, it is precisely this record, and
so far —
QUESTION:

That is because you say the rule* has no

15
impact on your case.
MR. DIG MAN:

That is ray belief,

And as to the

agency, while it may be true that there has been a change hereI submit to this Court that it is unlikely that case will
reach this Court until after the 18-month rule has expired, and
I suggest we have got chaos in the agency until it does reach
this Court.
QUESTION;

Weil, let's suppose that tomorrow the

Court of Appeals upheld the interim rule?
MR, DIGMAN;

The Co’art of Appeals will not speak on

the interim rule until this Court speaks.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

I said suppose that

it did and upheld the interira rule?
MR, DIGNAM;

That would solve the problem, but I must

say I consider that highly unlikely because the interim rule is
on the same procedures as the rule that is —
QUESTION;
cedural matter rests.

I know, but let's assume that the pro­
Suppose the Court of Appeals were told

that their procedural approach to the case was wrong.
MR. DIGNAM':
QUESTION;

Than that would be this Court9s —
Do you suggest necessarily the Court of

Appeals would find the record in the case now before it inade­
quate?
\

MR. DIGNAM;

Mo.

I think if this Court instructed

the court of Appeals that its procedures were wrong, the result.

16
would be that they would uphold the interim rule.
QUESTION:

That is what I thought.

MR. DIGNAM:
Justice.

But maybe I misunderstood you, Mr.

I thought you were assuming this Court did not speak

on the subject.
I see that my time is up, and I thank the Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Wallace.
ORAL ARGUMENT 01? LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT, NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMM.
MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Court of Appeals decision here came in the course
of an. evolving process of how the Commission has been handling
the licensing of nuclear power plants.

There is some 65

presently in operation in the country, some of which received
their licenses, including their operating licenses, prior to
the passage of the Natio:,al Environmental Policy Act in 1959.
And the process has evolved considerably since the Court of
Appeals decision in this case, and I will explain that briefly.
At the time that Vermont Yankee's operating license
was issued, the Commission took the position that it. would give
no consideration to questions of reprocessing and waste manage™
meat and disposal during the licensing proceedings, although
shortly thereafter it adopted the 1974 Fuel Cycle-Rule, in which

in recognition of the fact that waste problems are irretriev­
ably set in motion by the granting of a license to a plant, it
decided that it should factor in to the extent that it is
possible to do so some environmenta1 values reflected in the
management and disposal of waste and reprocessing in the
licensing proceeding.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, do you know without reference

to the record when Vermont Yankee8s license was originally
issued?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

The operating license?

Yes.

MR. WALLACE:

I believe it is 1972.

And the rule

that the Court of Appeals set aside, the fuel cycle rule, was
ad op tel in 197 4, and —
QUESTION:

Well, how can that affect Vermont Yankee’s

license that was issued in 872?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, as a matter of fact, it did not.

At that time, the Commission decided that that rule would be
applied prospectively only and not to existing licenses such as
Vermont Yankee, because the values reflected in the table to be
applied under that rule were not significant enough to be
likely to affect the balance, the cost-benefit balance that had
been determined in measuring the environmental effects of these
Haneses.
■ would happen then if the Court or we

IS
had not granted certiorari aid the Court of Appeals decision
had been left standing, would that have had some effect on
Vermont Yankee's 1972 license?
MR. WALLACE:

Wall, the Court of Appeals set aside

the grant of the license.
QUESTION:

On what grounds?

MR. WALLACE;

On the ground that it had been done

without taking into account waste reprocessing and disposal,,
and —
QUESTION;

Is there a statutory limitation period on

the time to appeal from the grant of a license such as was
granted in 572?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, I am sure there is but no one to

my knowledge contended that the setting aside of the license
was untimely here.

It was part of the Court of Appeals8 order.

There is a portion of the opinion devoted to setting aside the
license as well as a portion devoted to setting aside the rule.
And what the Court of Appeals held was that it was proper to
proceed under a valid rule and to take account of this environ­
mental factor which, after all, is a generic factor.

We are

not talking about the particular reprocessing or disposal
facilities

men we are dealing with these individual licenses,

it was proper to do this by a valid rule, but that this
wasn't a valid rule and Chat in the absence of applying a valid
!

is invalid for not having taken

19

this factor into account, and both aspects of this case ware
remanded to the Commission.
Now, insofar as this remand was based on a finding
of inadequacy of record, which was the sole basis in Judge
Tamm's concurring opinion, and arguably a or the basis else­
where, the matter is from ths Commission's standpoint largely
academic now.
The 1974 rule has been replaced by the interim rule
to which we refer on pages 3 0 and 31 of our brief, and the
Commission has now undertaken to replace the interim rule with
a permanent rule.
Moreover, the. interim rule has been applied to the
Vermont Yankee case in the decision of July 18, 1977, by the
Commission's Appeal Board.

That is reprinted as a supplement

to a supplemental brief just submitted by the respondent in the
case.

And in that decision, the Appeal Board determined that

the values in the revised fable to be used in the interim rule
when applied to the Vermont. Yankee application do not tip the
balance of costs and benefits previously determined in the
environmental survey done there.

And the Commission's Appeal

Board reached the same conclusion with respect to eleven other
facilities in a decision in August of this year, 6 Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, 205.

The decision involving Vermont

Yankee appears at 6 Nuclear Regulatory Coamission, page 25.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, could I interrupt with a

20
question?

What is the position of the government as to whether

or not the record was adequate with respect to Vermont Yankee?
MR. WALLACE:

We have not taken a position on that

in this case,
QUESTION:

But don't, you have to take a position in

order to tell us whether to reverse or affirm?
MR. WALLACE s

'Well* we really think from our stand­

point it no longer matters* we don't see any reason why the
Court need make that determination.

We have lodged with the

Court the environmental survey on which the new interim rule
was based, devoted entirely to questions of reprocessing and
waste management.
QUESTION:

Don't we have to decide the ease though?

Don't ws either have to affirm or reverse, and if we agree
with you and with Vermont Yankee on the procedural questionf
don’ t wo neee ' iarily have either to. decide it car dismiss the
writ as improperly granted, one or the two?

I mean, we have to

act, we can’t just say it is an academic problem.
MR. WALLACE:

That is correct.

But for purposes of

Vermont Yankee's application, xse have already applied the
interim rule and are intending to complete cur rulemaking pro™
igs and to apply the permanent rule to Vermont Yankee, so
that that suroach of the case is no longer of concern to the
Commission's procedures.
.

And I think the Commission would have

. authority to proceed that way, regardless of whether this

Court were to disagree with the Court of Appeals about the
adequacy of the record.
QUESTION:

Except that if we reversed the Court of

Appealsf you don’t need any further proceedings in the Vermont
Yankee case because -the forty-year license will be in effect,
MR. WALLACE:

We won't need than but we are going to

proceed with them.
QUESTION:

Well, how could you proceed with them

with respect to Vermont Yankee?

They've got their license.

Won't they just stay home and not came to your hearings?
MR. WALLACE:

The Commission does have the; authority

to apply the interim rule to existing licenses when issues
have been raised about the fuel cycle effects on the environ­
ment with respect to them.
QUESTION:

Where does that authority come from?

MR. WALLACE:

Well., I would have to refer to the

statutory authority.
QUESTION:

Supposing you have a license, a forty-year

license issued in 1965 and no grant of authority to the Com­
mission in terms to reopen for this reason, do you think the
Commission can just reopen and reconsider the license without
any mandate from Congress?
MR, WALLACE:

not attempted to do
QUESTION:

It has not attempted, to do so.

It has

bo.

But you just said it could.

I said it could with respect to this

one because it is still being contested.
QUESTION:

But it is a '72 license and the time for

brought.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, should that issue be raised, the

Commission would have to address it.
have not.

We just have not.

We

We are planning to go ahead with the rulemaking

proceeding that is now under way and, as 1 say, the interim
rule is based on a much more substantial evidentiary survey
devoted entirely to waste management and disposal and repro­
cessing issues than was the basis of the rule that the Court of
Appeals set aside and which is no longer in effect so far as
the Commission is concerned.
QUESTION:

What is the date of that last document?

MR. WALLACE:

Of the Commission's interim rule?

That

was adopted — I don't recall, but it is very —
QUESTION:

What is its date in the sequence of —

MR. WALLACEs

March '77, I am fold.

It is relatively

recent and if is to be in effect for 18 months.
Now, what the Commission is concerned about, however,
is the procedural holding of the Court of Appeals because in
adopting the. interim rule it followed the statutorily pre­
scribed procedures of section 553 of the Administrative

23

Procedure Act, rather than afford additional procedures which
the Court of Appeals held in hindsight had been required in
the other rulemaking proceeding, although the Court of Appeals
never spelled out what those procedures should be.

And with

respect to the new rule to ba adopted, the Ccemaission is not
proposing to engage in an adjudicatory type of rulemaking with
rights of discovery and cross-examination.

It has invited the

participants to suggest questions and follow-up questions for
the Board to ask witnesses at the hearing to be held in con­
nection with the new rule, but there are practical reasons why
the Commission chooser, not to proceed in an adjudicatory
manner as no statute requires it to do.
With respect to the 1974 rule, there were sane forty,
individuals and organisations who participated, and the Com­
mission anticipates that at least as large a number will ba
concerned with the hearings with respect to the new rule.

It

lias already received comments and proposed questions and follow'
up questions which are. quite voluminous, and there are prac­
tical limits to the use of an adjudicatory process in a rulemaking proceeding of this kind if the distinction between
rulemaking and adjudication is to perform the function that
was w. r.eoiv f! for it under the Administrative Procedure Act.
For that reason. the Co-:.mission is concerned with
the holding of the Court: of Appeals her a and. what it portends
for the Commission* s ability to proceed through ruleraking with

24
what the Commission considers to be more appropriate responses
to these problems in the licensing of plants* and it

believes

that the procedural holding of the Court of Appeals based as
far as we are able to tell purely on the Court of Appeals’
dissatisfaction with the results that were reached in the 1974
rule, rather than with any infirmity that it could point to in
the proceedings adopted from the perspective of the time when
the Commission adopted then should be set aside»
Indeed, there was no showing to the Commission that
any particularised need for discovery or cross-examination
with respect to any of the issues with which the Court of
Appeals later decided the record was inadequate.
Now, I should say that the interim rule has not yet

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. HORSKY, ESO„,
OK BEHALF OF PETITIONER, CONSUMERS POWER CO,
MR. HORSKY:
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I represent the petitioner in No. 7 6-528, Consumers

Power Company.
This is a challenge to a construction license, rather
than an operating license.

In the Court of Appeals opinion in

this case, they incorporated by reference their decision in the
Vermont Yankee case and, for that reason, I join in what has
been said by Mr. Dignan and Mr. Wallace in urging a reversal
of that decision, but on that issue I would prefer to rest
with what has been said and go on to the other two issues
which were involved in the Midland case.
Those two issues involve two separate grounds which
have nothing to do with the fuel cycle issue.

The first is

whether the Commission, whether the licensing board in grant­
ing the construction license adequately dealt with what I
might shorthand call conservation of energy alternatives to
the grant of the construction license.

The other is whether

the report of the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Safeguards,
which is one of the statutory requirements for the hearing and
grant of a license, was adequate.

Let me take them up in turn.

First, with respect to the so-called energy conserva­
tion issue:

It is a NEPA issue, did the licensing board

properly consider the alternative to the plant of energy

conservation.

We submit that it did.

The procedures started with an environmental impact
statement which covered all of the various categories, all of
the various considerations, and attached to it for circulation
and ultimate hearing were some 119 energy or environmental
considerations propounded by an intervenor called Saginaw.
That draft environmental impact statement report was than the
subject of hearings, adjudicatory hearings, cross-examination
preceded by discovery and all the rest.

They lasted, for 14

days.
It is perhaps worth noting that the Saginaw inter­
vener who propounded the considerations failed to participate
in those hearings, but those hearings developed in detail the
need for the project, a conclusion which was supported by the
Michigan Public Service Commission, the Federal Power Coram ission, and the Environmental Protection Agency.
The controversy relates to some 17 of these 119 en­
vironmental contentions propounded by Saginaw 'which are said
to be, although the words were not used, energy conservation
contentions,

Some of them ware dealt with by the Licensing

Board specifically.

For example, it considered and found that

there was no basis for holding that the Consumers Power had
artificially enhanced the requirements for electricity and
therefore distorted its demand figures.
The Licensing Board did decline, however, to consider

27

a number of Saginaw somewhat rhetorial contentions dealing with
in general whether or not it would he proper to set limits on
the uses of electricity or, as the Licensing Board put it,
whether we should consider whether the present customary uses
of electricity in our society are proper or improper.
The Appeal Board affirmed that decision, but that
wasn’t the end of it.

While the petition for review was pend­

ing in the court below, the intervenors asked that the hearing
before the licensing hoard be reopened on the ground that the
Commission in the meantime, in a decision called the Niagara
Power decision, had said things which were inconsistent with
the decision of the Licensing I^ard.

That motion to reopen

the hearings was passed upon, ruled upon by the Commission it­
self in a long careful opinion.

In that opinion, it reviewed

each of these 17 contentions and set forth in careful studied
words why it believed the Licensing Board was correct in not
having to consider the contentions which ware urged with
respect to nergy conservation which the Licensing Board did
not consider.
QUESTION:

Mr. Horsley, somewhere along the line of

thesprocedures, wasn't the point made that one of the cus­
tomers, Dow Chemical, would no longer need the power to be
supplied by this —
MR. HORSEY2

Well, at one point during the course of

the proceedings, a motion was made to reopen the hearing on the

ground that the contract arrangements between Dow and Consumers
had been modified,
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. HORSKY:

The Commission heard that decision or

heard that contention and reviewed the contracts and said that
there was no basis upon which the decision should be changed
insofar as Dow was concerned.
QUESTION:

And chronologically,, v?hen was that done,

about the same time it considered, these 17 questions?
MR. HORSEKY:

All I can say is that since that time

there have been no substantial changes in the Dow-Consumers
relationship.

The Court of Appeals in its decision said you

might re-look at those questions, but, as we point out in our
reply brief, the situation with respect to Dow is essentially
the same- as it. has been since the time the Commission itself
re-examined the issue and decided that there was no basis for
modification of its decision.

I think the Dow question can be

put to cne side, Your Honor.
What is clear in this record, it seems to me, is that
there is a need, a clearly demonstrated need for the power
that this plant is to generate, and it also seems to rae that
the Commission was quite correct in saying the Licensing Board
did not need to consider the kind of contentions, for example,
and I quote, ''the: possibility of charging the present social
stimuli to society which could result in a decreased demand

for electricity*

or another one, that

Dow Chemical should be

denied electricity in order that it would be encouraged to
develop power sources "from other sources not now known to

man . "
1 think the Board was correct in saying' that those
kinds of contentions did not require the Licensing Board to go
into them in detail.

That is not. to say that the Board didn't

have a responsibility for determining that there was a need
for the power to be generated.

Of course it did, and it want

into that in great detail, examining the demand statistics
which were present®! in very great detail to it.
What it is to say is that under NEPA the Commission,
it seems tc me, was entirely warranted in saying that the
interveners who ware challenging the demand and suggesting an
alternative to the plan had the responsibility for developing
something more specific than the kinds of things that I have
just suggested, with reasonably specific conservation measures
which, as the Commission put if, would require reasonable mind
to inquire further.

That is the threshhold test which the

Court of Appeals found so arbitrary and capricious.

It seems

to me that it is anything irat that.
Wow, let me mention again what Mr. Wallace, adverted
to briefly in his argument.

This decision was made in 1972,

this decision to grant tie construction license.

At that time

both NEPA and indeed the nation's concern for proper-

30
conservation of energy were certainly in a developing state,
in a different state than they are today.

The guidelines set

out by the Council on Environmental Quality for the first time
in 1973, a year after the decision, suggested that the environmental impact statement should address energy conservation
/

alternatives.

The Federal Power Commission in 1973

for the

first time suggested that in consideration of a license for a
hydroelectric plant, the alternatives of conservation ought to
be considered.
I think under the circumstances in this cs.se, and
given ths time at which the decision was rendered, the Licens­
ing Board acted properly with respect to these energy conserva­
tion measures.
The other issue is, as I say in the brief, almost a
contrived one, but it was; the basis of .a further order by the
court below that we go hack to the Licensing Board again.

This

is the alleged inadequacy of the report of the Advisory Com­
mittee on Reactor Safeguards.

That committee is a 15-member

part-time group of distinguished scientists who are charged by
the statute to advise the Coromission and to examine and to
advise the Coromission on the preliminary safety analysis
report.

The advisory committee did in fact do that.

It filed

a letter with the Commission pointing out certain problems

V'hic.i it thought the staff slim 3d address, and then it said
ight-water nuclear reactors are set

forth which we think the staff should address

- are set forth

in cur earlier reports on light-water nuclear reactors»
The Court of 'Appeals said that cross-reference re­
quires that this case be remarried because the Licensing Board
should have sent it back and asked the advisory committee to
specify the other factors which the advisory committee said
the staff should consider , and do it in language intelligible
to a layman, whatever that, means in this context.
These other reports of the advisory committee were,
of course, known to the Commission and to its staff.

And in­

cidentally, if there is any question about whether the staff
was confused, the reply brief filed by the government 1 think
clears up the contention that the staff was confused.
The other reports ware on file in the public docu­
ment room of the Commission.

Anyone who wanted to go look for

them could, have gone to look for them.
It seesp.s to ma that to say that that kind of a mis­
take, if it was a mistake and it. doesn't seasn to me to be one,
it was the customary from of the letter of the Advisory
Committee, doesn't warrant sanding this case back to square
one which is where we will be, before the Licensing Board,
:L>

this decision stands.

ference run dry.

It is reviewed and

That is the first step.

The safety aspects are considered by the Advisory Committee.
Then there is a full adjudicatory type hearing on the safety
and all other aspects of the plant, preceded as it was in this
case by ©laboratory discovery.

On the basis of that record,

the Licensing Board makes its findings, that is, spells them
out in detail.

That record is also the subject of what amounts

to a de novo review to an appeal board.
CJESTIOH:

This is an adjudicatory hearing under

ADA, I take it?

M&. HOP.SKYs

Oh, yes, a full acjudicatory hearing,

full discovery, full cross-examination, and very lengthy, and
the decision by the Appeal Board is in turn subject to review
by the Commission itself, as was the case in the HEPA issues.
I think the intervenor s probably would like it
rwise, but the fact is tint Congress has, as Mr. Wallace
said, decided that nuclear power should be used for electric
power production.

It did so in the Atomic Energy Act, it re-

affirmed that in the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974.

It

realised that it has hasaxds as well as benefits, but it went
ahead.
The Commission has been equally responsive to the
hazards.

And I think what has developed from the statutory

33

requirements and from the Coaaaisoion* s regulations is probably
the most elaborate, the most detailed,- the most comprehens ive
administrative machinery that aas ever devised to determine
whether or not government approval or disapproval should come
from an application of a private project.
And what the court below has done in those two cases
is to interject itself into that procedure.

Yankee case, and Mr. Cherry will follow me and address the
issues in the other case,,
I think the respondents in this case would like to
make two points clear at the outset that do not seem to have
bean accorded much importance in the presentation that you
have heard.
The first is that this case arises or these two cases
arise under the National Environmental Policy Act.

The

National Environmental Policy Act, as this Court has said, has
two purposes.

One is that to require disclosure by government

agencies who axe considering going forward with a project to
other decision-makers and to the public in general, with the
theory being that, disclosure will tend to produce better de­
cisions, less-etwironmenf ally damaging decisions.

The other

is that by requiring the presentation of an environmental
impact statement, NSPA is designed to encourage agencies to
exercise foresight, to foresee the long-range consequences of
the things they undertake for short-range benefits.

Aijd ws

thi; k the i 3sue.3 that ware involved in the Vermont Yankee case
are classic instances of how important that requirement is.
QUESTIONS

Speaking of foreseeing long-run consequences,

Mr. Ayres, it is your brief, I believe, that bears the clerk's
stamp of November 2*5th, the supplemental statement of facts!
Ml, AYRES;
facts.

Yes, this is a supplemental statement of

QUESTION 2

Is there any reason why that carae in so

late?
MR. AYRES s

Well,, there was a great deal of thought

given to whether that issue should be raised, and I am afraid
I accept same blame for having not provided that material to
the Court earlier.

We do think it is relevant, however, to

the decision and would have wanted to submit it at whatever
time.
The issues, as I said, that are raised in the liti­
gation —
QUESTION?

Just before you leave that supplemental

statement ef facts, you state that the Vermont Yankee Nuclear
Power Station has now been granted a full-term operating li­
cense.

Your brother said that it was in effect an 18-month

license.
MR. AYRES:

Well, I think if you look at the opinion

by the Cranmission in this case, you will see that their posi­
tion is first that the Vermont Yankee should have a license
under the interim rule —
QUESTION:
MR. AYRES:

Right, which is the 18-month rule.
Yes.

And second, that had this case

come before them in 1971, they would have come to the same
conclusion because essentially c£ the fact that the plant was
built and operating, essentially because of the costs involved.
QUESTIONj

Neil, they lid come to the same conclusion

36
for a forty-year license back in 1973.
MR. AYRESi

But they did that in the absence of any

consideration of the waste issues at all.

What they aura say­

ing in this decision is, when we consider the waste issues as
we see them, then wa still conclude that the plant should be
licensed, and. I think that wa can also anticipate for certain
that when a final rule is promulgated, the same decision will
b© applied, given the reasoning in that opinion.

So we think

that as to Vermont Yankee, the issue of whether Vermont Yankee
can operate with its license is really a settled issue, and
that is the issue on which the court granted cart.

Arid there

was, as you recall —
QUESTION:

Well, that is all that Vermont Yankee

wanted, and they have got it —
MR. AYRES:
QUESTION:

That's right.
— if they do have a forty-year license.

But the fact is they have a license, under the interim rule,
which is an 10-month rule.
MR. AYF.ESs

Wall, there may be some room for inter­

pretation there and we, of course, do not make any statement of
position when wa brought this to the Court’s attention.

But

re think it is clear, if one looks at the reasoning there and
also at the rule that is being proposed as a final rule, which
is essentially the same as the interim rule, and which again
same as the rule that was under review in

37
this casa, that Vermont Yankee's license is free and clear.
And frankly, from the position of those parties who challenged
ifc in the beginning, ray clients, we have no quarrel with that.
The issue that we are concerned about is the way the Commis­
sion has dealt with the nuclear v/aste problem, its refusal to
make available to the public information about the situation,
and that issue now have moved into the arena of the S-3 table

What was the sense of getting a forty-year one in the first
place?
MR. AYP.ES;

Well, they brought — you hove to recall,

this proceeding has been going on now for six years.

It arose

when Vermont Yankee sought an operating license and the
parties who are now the respondents before you —
QUESTION:
MR. AYRES:

In 1969?
Well, *69 is perhaps when it started.

The parties went before the Commission to ask that the Cxsmnission address the environmental effects of the waste disposal
and reprocessing of the waste from this plant,
refused to consider that issue.

The Commission

The parties who are now before

you sought review in the Court of Appeals.

The Commission

then changed its position and said re take it back, these are
issues that should be before the Li .easing Board when it looks
ubaX impact of any given passer plant* however,
we are going to hole; a different kind of proceeding, we are
rule-making proceeding and look at this issue
generically.

39
When that generic proceeding was complete f the
respondents sought review of that issue also, and the court
brought the two casas together and decided them.

In other

words# the original license given to Vermont Yankee was given
with no consideration of the environmental impact of waste#
even -though later that was —
QUESTION:

And now you go back to the licensing#

that is the '72 point# right# or the '69 point?
MR. AYRES:

The Court of Appeals had before it

whether Vermont Yankee's license was properly granted.
QUESTION:

1 am asking the result of the Court of

Appeals decision in this case.

You go back to the licensing

point# am I correct?
MR. AYRES:

Well# let me clarify slightly.

The

Court of Appeals’ opinion .remanded the license for Vermont
Yankee pending the outcome of further proceedings by the Com­
mission to establish an adequate record on the issue of waste
disposal.
QUESTION:

Well# if it took nine years before# why

won't it take that long now?
MR. AYRES:
QUESTION:

Well# it didn't take nine years,
How long did it take# from '7 2 to *70-what?

MR. AYRES; The Commission undertook the rulemaking

But the casa was started in *69.

40
MS. AYRES;
QUESTION!

Ho, the. case that —
The application?

The case that involves Vermont Yankee

MR* AYRES:
v/as started in 1971.
QUESTION:

In 1971.

MR. AYRES %
QUESTION:

1971.

That case —

And now it is 1977.

MR. AYRES:

That case has taken this long only be­

cause the Commission has gone through a separate rule-making
proceeding, it has complicated the issues.
QUESTION:

Well, couldn’t they do it again?

MS. . AYRES:

But the Vermont Yankee license has bean,

remanded pending the Commission's taking a serious look at tie
waste disposal issues.
QUESTION:

Your position then is that your client

did appeal from the actual granting of the license in ’72
within the SO-day period?
MR. AYRES:

There is no question about that.

no issue about that at all.

There

But because of the Commission’s

reversal of position, its decision that waste disposal issues
were valid issues to be considered and its subsequent proceed­
ings, two separate cases cams before the Court of Appeals on
essentially the same general issues, and the one which you
have: accepted cert on is the one that involves Vermont Yankee's
license.

There was also a petition, as you probably recall,

for review of the court’s decision as to the Commission*s
rule-making.

That petition was not granted.

So the issue

before you here is whether Vermont Yankee was properly or im­
properly granted that licensef and it is related to the rule™
making only insofar as Vermont. Yankee’s license now depends
on the outcome of the rule-making.
QUESTIONt

And if we uphold the rule-making proceed­

ing, does it necessarily follow that Vermont Yankee's license
is also valid?
MR. AYRES %
QUESTION?

No, it dees not.
Why not?

MR. AYRESs

Well, Vermont Yankee’s license was held

invalid because the Commission gave no consideration whatever
to the environmental impact of the waste that would be produced
at that plant.

In the rule-making proceeding, the Commission

had agreed that that was in error, that it was supposed to
look at the waste that arose from that plant and try to look at
what the envir onmentai impact of those would be.

However, in

effect it simply said we won't relook, at any plants that va
have looked at before.

The case-, however, had already been

filed as to Varment Yankee.

Indeed, it was the filing of that

case which spurred the Commission to change its position.
that case came before the Court of Appeals on the issue of
whether cr not a license could be issued to a plant with no
consideration whatever given to the environmenta1 impact of

Bo

the waste that that plant would produce.
QUESTION:

And the Court of Appeals sent it. hack and

the Commission did consider inaptly or not properly in your
view though waste production in a rule“making proceeding?
MR. AYRES:

No, they ware separate and unrelated

until they came before the court.
at the same time.

They came before the court

The Vermont Yankee case poses the issue of

whether a plant can be licensed with no consideration whatever
of the environmental impact of the waste that that plant will
produce.

The rule-making proceeding is one in which the Com­

mission agreed that that position is in error, they agreed
that they had to look at the environmental effects of waste.
It then, however, conducted what we consider to be an extremely
cursory examination of the issue, and we then appealed that
rule-making to the Court of Appeals.

The Court of Appeals

decided both cases together.
It held in the first instance that licensing a plant
with no consideration of -waste was clearly a violation of NEPA,
the National Environmental Policy Act.

It also held that the

Commission's rule-making had not provided an adequate investi­
gation laying out on the public record of the environmental
hazards associated with reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel and
with the ultimate dispose! of the wastes that are produced at
the power plant.
Q; "1 f ft.

I:v. vTn.sn*t the Commission's determination

43

in the rule-making proceeding that Vermont Yankee's license
should be continued to be valid?
MR. AYRESs

No, the rule-making proceeding was con­

ducted completely separately from the Vermont Yankee proceed­
ing.
QUESTION:

Well, what is the Commission’s present

position, as you understand it, on the validity of Vermont
Yankee's license?
MR. AYRES:

X think the Commission's present posi­

tion is stated in the opinion which I provided to you

Last

week, which grants Vermont Yankee its license based, on this
interim rule, but clearly indicates also that the Commission's
view is that Vermont Yankee is grandfathered.

And as 1 said,

my client is not concerned that that should occur.
QUESTIONAnd you say if it hadn't been i'or this
subsequent proceeding, Vermont Yankee wouldn't have any license
at all, even though wo wore bo reverse the Court of Appeals?
MR. AYRES:
QUESTIONs

I'm sorry, I didn't understand.
You say that if it weren't for this sub­

sequent proceeding in July of this year, that Vermont Yankee
wouldn’t have any license?
MR. AYRES:

That's right, the Court of Appeals de­

cision is that Vermont Yankee’s license must be remanded pend­
ing an adequate investigation and laying out on the public
record of the waste issues.

We see the issue here :ls whether the Commission

has properly escansined the waste issues under the National
Environmental Policy Act, and we point out that the court saw
it that way also.

The court said we don’t presume to tell

you what procedures should fee used.

We are not presuming to

tell you whether the procedure should be rule-making or
adjudication, but we do presume to tell you that based on what
we see here, (a) a case in which a plant is licensed “with no
consideration, and (b) a rule-making in which the Commission
essentially gave no consideration to the basio questions that
have been raised by most of the major non-nuclear regulatory
commission people who have looked at this issue.

We cannot,

agree that chat is adequate consideration of these issues under
the National Environmental Policy Act.
QUESTIONi

These issues are, what, the environmental

effect of the so-called back-end part of the nuclear cycle?
MR, AYRES:

There are two basic issues.

One is that

it has been assumed that the fuel, the spent fuel from nuclear
reactors would be reprocessed and plutonium would be extracted
from that fuel to he uses! in turn as fuel for future reactors.
Recently, a major Ford Foundation study, as one ex­
ample, criticized that decision because of the fear that once
plutonium is purified, it is easy to steal, to divert either
by a technologically backward nation or by' a terrorist group,

46
and the technology to produce a crude bomb is widely known.
It can easily be dens.
The President of the United States last spring, based
on that reasoning, decided that reprocessing shouldn't go
forward.
selves.

The

second issue is the disposal of the waste them­

The waste themselves include elements which are radio­

active for periods ranging from hundreds of years to literally
hundreds of thousands of years.

So the issue is how to isolata

those wastes from all life, human and otherwise, for periods
that range anywhere from a thousand years to a quarter of a
million years.
There have been studies published in the last two or
three years by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Cal-Tech, the British Royal Commission, the General Accounting
Office) and a House committee, all of which conclude that the
/
Commission has failed to solve that problem, has failed to
demonstrate any means for isolating nucleate waste from the
environment.
QUESTION;

And. the Commission, what is happening so

far is that so-called temporary storage of a hundred years?
MR. AYRES

%

Well, no such temporary storage is

occurring either, Your Honor.

What is actually occurring is

that because there is no solution, temporary, hundred ■■•year , or
long-ter« which has been demonstrated at this point r the spent
reactor fuel is being stored in .‘"pent fuel pools on the si te of

the reactor which ware designed to hold the fuel for a natter
of two or three months before it was shipped off to be taken
care of.

This is a problem which has been considered by

everyone but the Nuclear Regulatory Comtiission as perhaps a
critical problem concerning whether nuclear power should be
pursued.
QUESTION:

Well,, that is all a matter under the law

of separate and subsequent licensing?
MR. AYRES %

Well, the Commission's view is that they

can look — it is because this issue occurs in every plant,
they will look at the issue once genetically
QUESTION:

And make a rule which incorporates, a

curve, right?
MR. AYRES:

Which incorporates a table of figures,

Yes,
The point is though that two things are

One, by convening a rule-making proceeding, the.

agency has -startailed the usual procedural rights that occur,
that are given to interveners on safety issues, on environmenta.l issues in the usual licensing of the plant.
QUESTION:

Well, do you say that the preparation of a

NEPA statement requires an adjudicatory hearing or that the
licensing issue requires an adjudicatory hearing?
MR. AYRES$

The Commission prepares an —

48
QUESTION:

I was carious to know what you said, what

your position is.
MR, AYRES:

Well, the Commission ordinarily prepares

an environmental impact statement tor each plant.

That en­

vironmental impact statement is then taken into account in the
licensing and during that proceeding any party to the proceed­
ing is afforded the usual full panoply of adjudicatory rights,
cross-examination, and so forth, as to the environmental im­
pact statement and the statements that are made there, as well
as to the safety issue.
QUESTION:
MR. AYRES:

Do yea think that is required by statute?
Ho.

What I am saying is th*

i

Com­

mission, in convening a generic rule-making proceeding, they
have restricted those rights.

I do think that the National

Environmental Policy Act requires that the Commission explore
the issues.

Whether it be by that kind of procedure or not,

I don’t think that the —

MR. AYRES:

Well, I think if one looks at. the pages

of the record -QUESTION:

I mean what is your authority, decisional

authority from this Court that the preparation of any MEPA
statement must conform at least with the rule-making standards
of the APA?
MR, AYRES:

Well, Your Honor- that is not the propo­

sition that I would support,

The proposition that I would sup­

port is that the National Environmental Policy Act requires the
agency to explore on the public record fully the environmental
impact of the proposed action.

This rule-making was taken in

effect to prepare part of the envir

real impact statement

for every power plant to be licensed from the on,

so it was

subject to the seme injunction which this Court has stated and
many lower courts have, too, that there must be a full analysis
of —
QUESTION;

Which case of this Court are you relying

on f or that ?
HR. AYRES:
Kleppe case,

Well, I think it has been stated in t lie

ari well as the other NEPA cases that have cane

before the Court.
QUESTION:
MR. AYRES:

Any particular ones by name?
I think the Xleppe case is sufficient,

I think the critical point about the lower court's decision is
that it is focusing on whether there was an adequate

50
exploratior, of the issues to meet the standards of KEPA, not to
meet the standards of the APA.

The APA is involved here and wa

think that those standards weren't met either» but the key
thing is that the duty of the Commission came as a result of
the National Environmental Policy Act which requires that there
t

be a full exploration of the issues»

That is one of the

reasons why we feel the court's decision was not a. procedural
decision.
QUESTIONS

But the APA says there are two different

ways you can go about conducting hearings.

One is if it is a

rule-making proceeding, that is'553, and one is if it is an
adjudication, and you don't certainly contend that anything
more than a rule-making proceeding is required for your ordin­
ary HEPA statement, do you?
MR. AYRES:

I think I have a different view of what

the NEPA statement's position is, than that suggests.

I think

the HEPA statement proceeding, partieulary one that involves
essentially H3PA statements for all future nuclear power
licensing requires vary thorough exploration of the issues.
QUESTION:
MR. AYRES:

MR. AYRES:
QUESTION:
MR. AYRES:

What is your authority for that?
I think that is in the case lew of NEPA»
Well, case law from this Court?
This Court 'and the lower courts.
What from this Court, Kleppe?
I think so, yes.

I think the lower court

51
position clearly was that it was not concerned about procedure*
but what it was concerned about was the fact that the pro™
eedures that had been used and the way they were used failed
to produce an exploration of the issues.
that the Commission basically did was to look at the
hypothetical normal operation without any accidents or any
other abnormal occurrendes of a hypothetical reprocessing
scheme and disposal scheme* and failed to consider altogether
the long-term futura of attempting to isolate the waste* and
it failed also to consider the possibility that something
might gc wrong, for example, in the case of reprocessing, that
a terrorist group or a foreign power might wish to diver a
small quantity of plutonium that was necessary to make a
weapon.
There is a basic conflict here between the

way the

Commission has -tried to deal with this issue, as if it ware a
kind of minor concern- and where the rest ox the world outside
the Commission views it as one of the most important issues of
concern about the whole commitment of the nation to nuclear
power.

And wa think the Cotart of Appeals below in effect was

saying that the Commission, you must honestly and above-board
and fully explore the issue with the public and let the public
knot:;

including its decision-makers, what, problems do exist
; lean waste so that a decision can be made about than.
QUESTIONt

You feel the Court of Appeals more

32
adequately divined the state of world opinion than the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission?
MR. AYRESi

No, I think the Court of Appeals did

divine that the Commission had failed to address the kind of
major concerns which the petitioners — I'm sorry, the
respondents and others raised to them in the rule-making, and
the Commission essentially failed to address them, and those
are in fact the same concerns that, as I have mentioned,
expert bodies outside the Commission have raised also repeated­
ly in the last few years as

serious problems.

We think the

Commission in effect just tried to sweep those concerns under
the rug and avoid the discussion which NEPA really is aimed at
producing so as to produce better federal policies.
QUESTIONS

I don't know whether it is in your brief,

Mr. Ayres, or in the Court of Appeals opinion, but there is
the suggestion that there had to be an exhaustive study of all
of the alternative methods.

Is that in the opinion or in part

of your argument?
Mil. AYK5Si

I don't know whether it is in the opinion

15m not sure whether —
QuESTIONt
MR. AYRES;

Well, are you making that argument?
Well, I think, yes, the notion certainly

is that the alternative means of dealing with the problem need
to be explored.

They are clearly, many of them are, as the

Commission admits, are not yet seen in full being they are

still hypothetical»

vie are not - .suggesting that the Commission

engage in seme sort of crystal ball examination, but wa are
suggesting that the outlines of the potential envir on®ant a1
risks involved in each of those alternatives is reasonably
clear and. can be laid out on the record.
beat the Commission did here was to consider only
one hypothetical short-term solution to this problem, no long­
term solutions at all.

There was no discussion essentially of

the dangers that might flow from ore alternative as opposed to
another.
QUESTION?

You say that the Act specificaly requires

that the Commission do what you are suggesting?
MR. AYRES;

We think, yes, the Act does ask specific­

ally that alternatives be explored and also that the —

MR. AYRES;

But to what extent?
To evaluate — well, there is case law on

the question of to what, extent.
QUESTION;

You are not suggesting that there was no

consideration given to altarnative mtheds at all, are you?
MR. AYRES:
0U EST ION 2

Yes, I am.
None wha tever ?

MR. AYRES:

I think if you look at the record, you
i
will see that is correct.
There is hot even one alternative
given as to long-term storage, hot one, let alone alternatives
to that one.

There is one hypothetical, which is '

54
the Commission's policy to pur sue, given for so-called short­
term storage, and that is the reason why I think the court
didn't need, the help of experts to divine that the record in
this case was insufficient to support the conclusion that the
effects of waste were insignificant.
I see my light is on, and I thank you very ranch.

QUESTION:
MR. CHERRYs

That is correct.

That involves two cases, Mr. Justice.

In one of the cases before involves some citizen group known
as the Saginaw Valley Nuclear Study Group, and includes the
International Environmental Law Committee of the United Auto
Workers, it includes the University of Michigan Environmental
Law Society, the West Michigan Environmental Action Council,
and that was consolidated with the so-called Ae sen liman .peti­
tions which were people who lived in the area near the plant
and the own or of a motel, the Saginaw and intervenors essen­
tially took the laboring both at the hearings and at the Court
of Appeals

rnd the Court of Appeals below consolidated both of

those cases for decision and for argument.

We 11, the citizen groups, Mr. J i stice,

involve not only people who live in the community and are very
concerned about the development of that particular community,
many of them work for Dew Chemical but they also comprise
local representatives of national organizations, along with
the Sierra Club.
QUESTION:
MR. CHERRY:

Right.
I think a point to be made is boat

whatever the court does with respect to the fuel cycle case,
it really has no impact upon the Aeschiiman case.

While the

fuel cycle issue was ona of the four issues remanded, by the
Court of Appeals, the ACRS issue, the energy conservation and
the

Dow

cost-benefit analysis, the fuel cycle issue is given

a sentence in the Court of Appeals opinion below by sucking in
by reference the fuel cycle.

And while we believe that the

fuel cycle has some importance to the overall administrat ion
and regulation of nuclear energy, it has no impact upon the
cass that was consolidated.
our minds,

Indeed, there was seme question in

fiven the fact that the government opposed the writ

of certicr.aci even if the court took the cert cases and still
treats in its brief the issue secondary, whether this Court,
not having advised us about what is before the Court, whether
those issues are even before the Court.
It is our position that the Court ought to take a
long, hard look before it gets involves in a record kind of

57
case like Aeschliman.

In connection with a couple or points

made by Consumers Power counsel, 7 think it is important to
bear our, first of all, it is not true that the Dow issue is
essentially quiescent.
One again, we have a moving target with respect to
these issues.

We've gona through a year of remanded hearings.

There are new facts before the Commission now, and assuming
hypothetically that this Court does choose to reverse the
Court of Appeals on Aesehliiaan, those facts are still before
the Commission.

The Commission, under 10 CFR 50.100, Its

general superintendent power, cannot ignore facts in its pro­
ceeding forward with that, case, and so once again there is a
fresh record 'that may wend its way through the appeal process
in the Court of Appeals because we are now dealing with those
issues.
But in connect'

with the Dow issue specifically,

there was a decision by the Licensing Board on reman! in just
September of this year where the Licensing Board of. the Com-mission sail, and I quote, "v-tLilo Dow reeds steam, Dow does
not necessarily need it from Midland, and whether Dow will
aver buy steam from that plant is on this record speculative.
Whether these circumstances will change by the time the remand­
ing hearing is concluded isn't possible to know.13

And then it

goes on to suggest that if Dow fails to buy steam, the circum­
stances will be one of a plant at a site through which only

58
very limited alternatives were explore:!.

V hat has occurred in the process is that consumers
ran out of money in the 8 7 4-75 period, the amount, of funds
they have spent now is barely I think 20-22 percent of the
amount, and the remanded hearings which this Court would inter­
rupt by reversal of the Court of Appeals are all but over.

I

would contemplate that those remanded hearings might not last
more than six months from when they begin, and they are
scheduled to begin as soon as the Appeal Board rules on the
interira relationships.
(/JEST I ON:

MR. CHERRY:

How much of that is before us?

Of what is going on right now.

How much of that is before us?

None, am

I right?
Ml. CHERRY:

Well, if is not before you, Mr. Justice

Marshall, in the sensa that you are being asked to look at that
record.

However, if is before you in the sense that wo believe

it incumbent upon us in our answering brief to update the
record and indicate that the Commission has moved forward to
comply with the Court of Appeals order, and that task is all
but over with.

And I am only suggesting, with all due respect,

that that process ought to go forward because it involves
important issues to the Nuclear Regulatory

issi

*s

59

functions which it now all hut acknowledges»
* n connection with the argument made about oar
neither raising energy conservation issues or the ACRS being
unimportant, I think it is also important to understand that
the position of the government and the utility in this case
has constantly been changing.

For example, on energy conser­

vation, in 1972, the Licensing Board said that the contentions
we wanted to raise were beyond our province, that ruling came,
that is why we didn't participate in the hearing, because we
were told we couldn't deal with those issues.
Ivi 1973, the Appeal Board said that our contentions
are well beyond the pale of ItHPA,

Wow, as of 1972, President

Nixon alrealy submitted to Congress a comprehensive energy
policy.

Commissioner Dohb, of the Nuclear Regulatory Commis­

sion, in specific actions to the joint committee had dealt
with the question of energy conservation.

Chairman Schlesinger

bad given a speech saying that if was a legitimate issue.
S ) the suggestion tM the Commission was not aware
of energy conservation as an alternative is really legal
trickery and its

barring of the issues below is no more

than trickery because the Commission was aware of it, the
regrl&tory

'faff moved very «quickly below in the record to

force it or':, and Consumer-;: obviously made the same issue.
la 1974

lit was tfo

first time that the Commission

lelcv iQ j.id vvl to change what their position was and why they

60

barred energy conservation.

They abandoned the beyond the

pale NEPA ergument because it was insupportable, and I think
the governa-ant's brief admits that, and says that for the
first time that we didn't raise our contentions specifically.
Now, stopping right there, you have an agency which
says that, your contentions weren't specific, that I didn't
understand vhat energy conservation was, that it was beyond the
pale, of NEPA, that it was an evolving concept.
Well, it can't be all of those things.

If we are

told that energy conservation needed to be more specific, that
undercuts the agency's argument that they didn't know what it
was in the cirsfc place.

I submit that what the Commission has

done in this case is really quite important from another cir­
cumstance.

It has carved out a special rule for the Midland

case.
Mow, whether the Midland case ought to be built,
whether it might to be built is not before this Court, we are
not here to suggest that it is a proper or improper plant
r.ec e ssar ily in M id land.
My clients have spent an awful let of time, and money
la principle of merely trying to be heard.

On the

case of the fuel cycle, v;a were arguing that the Commission
may or may lot have adequately had the record.

We ware told

we couldn't deal with these Issues.
I.i terms of the .AC?.3 issue, once again, my brothers

61
treat the issue as one of just blithely it is an advisory
committee.

We look at it this way,, and we hope that the Court

will if it decides the reach the question:

The Advisory Com­

mittee on Reactor Safeguards has a letter.

The letter is of

some importance.

It was before this Court in a similar way

in the power reactor case, where this Court recognised that
the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards was important,
and if the Court recalls in that situation, what the Commis­
sion was trying to do was to hide the fact that the advisory
committee was against it.
In our situation, we have; a letter which said there
are other problems unidentified which should apply to the
Midland case.

Now, I asked questions about what those other

questions v ere, how should they be applied, what duo; consider­
ation is.

vc were fold that the ACRS was collegial in nature

and that we couldn't ask any questions,
The letter was put in for the purpose of proving
that the AC IS made a review but then with the catch 22 notion
that it wasn’t in for the proof of the matter stated.

Now,

assuming foe a moment on. the basis of this record -C: JESTICH%

Well, you wanted to depose the individual

members cf the ACRS, aid you not?
Mu CHERRY:

Yes, I did; Jr. Justice Rehnquist.

In

the power reactor case, the Commission in argument before this
Court stated that the ACRS was an important body and that it

62
might very well be witness in various proceedings.

It was

with that authority that we moved to depose the ACRS and ask
them questions, but our request was borne out of frustration.
We couldn't touch the letter.

The letter could have been the

New York Times or the Washington Post, for all that it
mattered, as long as it had the logo ACRS with the proper
signature, it went into the record.
QUESTIONS

Well, do you think Congress intended any

QUESTION:

And ray —■

All the statute requires is that the

letter be spread on the record , isn’t it?
MR. CHERRY;

Yes, that is true.

What the Court of

Appeals focused on below is the content of the letter.
QJESTION;

Yes., but I wasn’t asking what the Court

of Appeals focused on, I was asking what Congress focused on.
MR. CHERRY;

But we believe that Congress focused on

the suggestion that the ZiCRS come to the public hearing and
explain what its position is.

As a. matter of fact, that was

the Commission’s position in the power reactor case.

It has

only bear, recently when the advisory committee was begun to
disagree with the regulatory staff, that the regulatory staff
has attempt2d through the aid of the Licensing Board to pre­
vent examination of these, records.

In that sense, the

Aeschliman case is quite unremarkable, and what I would like
to impress ipon this Court is that essentially our argument is
that a plane is in the process of being constructed now, where
no one ever agrees now that its analysis are ever analyzed.
Dow Chemical is no longer seriously interested in this plant,
it testified on the remanded hearings for the purposes of
advising febr; court that if if could walk away from the plant
today, it would.

It testified that it had no

onfidence in

either utility in terms of its timing, sf cetera.
Our position is only that wa are interests! in the

64
hearing.

*3. ais Court has been stalwart in its protection of

that one solid points

The people who cane prepared to par-

ticipate ir the judicial process are entitled to he heard in
the administrative process.

That seal of principle of law is

the fundamental position of our country and of the basis of
due process of the long line of this Court’s decisions.

That

is all we asked below and that is all we ask hare before this
Court.
And what is important in terms of the remand pro­
ceeding is for these alternatives to be explored.

Now, in the

brief of Consumers Power before the Court, there is a sugges­
tion made which I am sura is not pressed very strongly, but I
would like to make a point about it anyway.
The argument starts out that wo spend $325 million
on a plant with obviously the tag-end line that this involves
substantial amounts of money and the Court ought to be aware
of it.
I would like to deal with that issue quite of ex­
pressly.

First of all, there is a lot in the record as to

whether this money is recoverable, whether those were honest
amounts, bub — and 7. might also point out that the amount of
the plant was originally conceived at around $500 million, is
ip to almos 1 $2 billion- so the amounts while perhaps large
are not in terms of the total -amount of the plant.
/

Bit the point I would like to suggest in terms of

65
the Commission's foreclosure argument is really the same kind
of argument being implicitly made by the suggestion that a lot
of money was spent»

The idea that any amount of money can

substantially provide a

legal basis for a bankrupt decision

is certainly imper.smissible.

And when we finally reach the

Supreme Court or if those issues are not properly before this
Court, the lourt of Appeals, we did everything we could to
get before that court.

And if we are told that that point in

timei7 some three or four years later, that the issues tjere
important, they should have been ventilated, ard yet then we
are told that the amount, of money having been spent is im­
portant , regulation then amounts tc having someone purchase a
legal opinion from a reputable lawyer saying that he has in
good faith relied upon this and then proceeds to implement the
regulation.

And that is really what this case is all about,

because if this case is reversed in terms of the Aeschliman
issues, tal: about judicial intervention run rides, we are
going to have no federal agency who will be able to regulate
because SPA:s regulations, the FTC's regulations, the ICC * s
regulations, ever

tmihistrafcive agency which has to rely on

importance of finality will surely be turned around,
ili

bivjxiit

t’iat the issues of energy conservation are

not only important to tin • country today but they war;) import­
ant in 1970 and there'is no basis for the suggestion that the
Supreme Court can rely upon a record in this case that the

66

Nuclear Regulatory Commission did not become aware about.
