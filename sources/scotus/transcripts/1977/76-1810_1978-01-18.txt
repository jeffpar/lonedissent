JUSTICE BURGER?

W© will hear arguments

first this morning in City of Los Angalss against M&nh&rt
and others®
Mr.Oliphant, you may proceed whenever you’re ready®
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. QLIPHANT, ESQ®,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR® OLXPHANT?

Mr® Chief Justice# may it pleas® the

Courts
We're hero today because the Court of Appeals refused
to follow the Supreme Court in Ganssral Electric va®, Gilbert®
The Manh&rt decision was issued just tea days before

the Gilbert decision came down, and it was directly contrary
to th© Gilbert decision? nevertheless, two or the three judges

refused to change their opinion«
We'r® also here because ths Court of Appeals refused
to follow the plain language of the statutes and the will of
Congress®

This is just a question of statutory construction,

but. what tIm respondents seek is a policy statement from the
Court contrary to th® plain language of the statute, contrary
to th® will of Congress, ©ad contrary to the decisions of this
Court in Gilbert and in Nashville» Nashville Gas vs® Satty»
In September & case was filed in th® Northern
District of California entitled Retired Public Employees
flag cclar-ion

.of Cfcliforaia.»

The case is a suit uadar

4
Title VII by females to recover back retirement contribution *
and by males to increase retirement benefits,

The California

Public Employ©® Retirement System had both unequal contributions:
and unequal benefits# based on s©x differentiat@d actuarial

tables o
We cite tills case simply to emphasize to the Court
today that in this particular case only the female employees
are before fe© Court? but the impact of 'this decision will
affect male employees# their spouses# end a multitude of
retirement systems across the country# as witness til® many
amicus briefs feat have been filed,
QUESTION? Would it have any effect on the insurance
companies charging more for annuities for women than for men?
MR, OLXPHANTs

Ultimately it may# Your Honor# yes.

But
QUESTION: And higher rates# correspondingly# fox’ joint
and survivorship annuities for a husband and wife?
MR, OLXPHANT:

Yes# Your Honor,

We’d like to point out first the four points that w©
would like to make in argument* and then commence the argument*
if w@ may.
First* this case is just an application of the
principles in Genfirr.1 E3-sictric vs, Gilbert,
Second# Title VII and the Equal Pay Act do not
prohibit', the practice challenged; that is# to measure con tribu-

5
tions and benefits in nstiramant plans, using s©x-differentiated
mortality tables.
Third, the lower courts, in order to arrive at th©
contrary decision. as they did, had to abdicate thsir respon­
sibility and defer totally to decisions of administrative
agencies that were contrary to th® statute and contrary to
their own authority to issue such bulletins.
2nd finally# Congress did not intend adopting
different standards for discrimination under Titi® VII than'were previously known in IS64 under the equal protection clause
of th© Fourteenth Amendment.
I’d like to begin by saying that first there is no
discrimination in the retirement plan.

Th© facts are simple.

Males and females receive the asms gross salary. Th®
department simply withholds mors for retirement from the female
salary than from th© males # because all the mortality experience
and morti particularly th® department’s mortality experience
show that, women have a greater life expectancy.
This is true at all ag©s# and of course it’s true in
retirement.
It is impossible to test or d@termi.ne individual life
expectancy? there’s no way you can test for it# so you have to
fund based on group mortality experience.
Group mortality experience, showing ttet women will
receive far more payouts than men# you have only three ways of

6
doing it* given the greater life expectancy
males 0

of females over

You can either have tile females pay the additional cost

of their Ufa expectancy, or you can have the employer pay it,
or the female and the employer together, or you can have the
males subsidise the females,,
In the department's plan, the females paid a slightly
higher contribution than the males, and that was matched by the
department 1X0 percent, so ‘that the department also paid more
for the females than til© males»
QUESTIONS

Mr. Oliphaat, —

MR» OLIPHANT:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir?

— is it true that members of on© race, on

an actuarial principle, might have a. longer expectancy than
members of another race?
MR. OLIPHANT:

It’s possible, but our current

actuarial statistics seem to indicate that the difference

between whites and non»-whites, which is the only racial
characteristic that I’va seen studies on, indicate that they
are getting closer

t&d closer.

As

& matter of fact, in the

later years, over th© Seventies, it may be that the non-t^hites
are actually outliving the whites»
QUESTION: Well, have insurance rates in fact been
different for, say, for blanks than for whites?
MR. OLIPHANT:
nol.; now

2 think sometime back they were; they * re

7
QUESTIONS

If they v/ara today, would this casa be

her® on that possible basis?
MR. OLIPHANT:

I don't knew, Your Honor, because

this case came under Title VII, and it came under the sex
qualifications of Title VII.

And Congress intended to treat

sex in compensation entirely different than race in compensa­
tion,.
QUESTION:

You have just stated that race is no longer

a factor, then, in th© setting of insurance rates.

Hew did

that corns ©bout, by voluntary action on the part of the
insurance companies?
MR. OLIPHANT:
QUESTION?

I believe so.

Thera was a time, at least within our

lifetimes, when sonus insurance companies would not insure
either American Indians or Negroes; is that not so?
MR. OLIPHANT:
QUESTION %

That’s no longer so?

MR. OLIPHANTs
QUESTIONS

That’s true, Your Honor, but I —

That is true.

I didn’t quit® understand, did you say

that in Title VII Congress treats sex discrimination entirely
differently from the way th© statute treats racial discrimina»
ti on?
MR. OLIPHANTs

In the compensation area, yes, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

There’s a BFQQ, of course, for discrim-

8
ih&hing as b@l3tf<3@n men and women, malas and females, and that:
doesn't exist ao a justification for discriminating among
races? but, except for that, is there any difference in Title
VII?

HR. GLXPHANT:

Yes, Your Honor, there is the Bennett

amendment to Section 703(h) , which very specifically
incorporates the Equal Pay Act into Titi® VII.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. OLIPHANT:

And the Equal Pay Act intended

allowing pension differentials to continue.
There is quit© a difference, I think. Your Honor,
bstwsen rat a and sex in terms of longevity.

It’s very clear

that in the sex area this is mors than just something that
may be cultural.

As th® blacks, for example, become more and

more a part of the middle classes in our society, ao their
life expectancies are pulling together.

The reverse is fcru©

As more and more com® into th® work force,

their life expectancy is expanding.
Our own department experience, as the Appendix shows,
is that woman are actually living longer than the man as th®y
come into the work force.

would they have any basis for a different rate for annuities

10

QUESTIONS

Oh, 1 see.

MR» OLIPHANT s

Ths insurance industry and th© actu­

arias do distinguish, because you're talking about apples and
oranges, trying to fund that»
If you go into a single table, what you d© for
funding purposes of annuities, essentially f is you raaka the
males subsidise the females*
QUESTION*

You mean just for this decision it would?

MR» OLIPHANT:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor»

If it were affirmed*

Or ©v©n, say, that you make the people

who donrt live so long srJ3si.di.2a the people who live longer*
MR» OLIPHANT:
QUESTION5

That'© correct*

Like the, I suppose, males who don’t

live so -- the people who die younger subsidize the males who
livo longer»
MR* OLIPHANT:

That's correct, too, Your Honor,

The difference is this, that of the males who die

younger, that subsidise the males who die older, at the time
that they purchase their annuity 'they have an equal life
axpactancy.

That’s not true between th® male and the female

at th© time of purchase of annuity.
What th© plaintiffs in tills case seek is not ©quality

but more than, equality, greater benefits than the males*
QUESTION:

Of course, that's what th® plaintiffs not

only sought but in a way were accorded, in th© recant MaghviJ.la

11
case against Safety»

Men just don’t get pregnant, do they?

MR. OLIPHANT:
QUESTION:

That5 3 right.. Your Honor.

And so women were asking for a treatment

by an employer for a condition that men just don’t have, or
aver get.
MR. OLIPHANT:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

So that is, in a way, preferential treat-

merit that they were asking for and were accorded.
MR. OLIPHANT:

Well, this Court didn't award the

pregnancy benefit» in that, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

No, but it's still in seniority

MR. OLIPHANT:
QUESTION:

Th® Court awarded seniority.

That’s right.

MR. OLIPHANT:

But I think a distinction there is

that the Court was talking about Section 703(a)(2} of Title
VII, particularly equal employment opportunity status, as
opposed to Section 703(a)(1), where we’re talking about compen­
sation.
I think there’s a tremendous difference.

On® is

depriving th® individual of work? th© other is a difference in
compensation.

Of course we are not saying her® that there

was inequitable treatment. Th® treatment was actuarily equal.
There is no way to have identical treatment and com© out
equitably for males and females.

It’s just like the Gilbert

QUESTION: But you say this is facially neutral as
well as factually neutral?
MR. OLXPHANTt
QUESTION:

No, I said factually neutral.

But if it's not facially neutral, you say

it's not facially discriminatory?
MR. OLIPHANTs

No, it is not discriminatory•

It's

different, I'll grant you that? but it's not discriminatory,
because the treatment is equitable.
The package that's —
QUESTION;

Are you defining the t?srm "discriminate"

to mean something that's cost-justified is not discriminatory?
In other words, that as long as you can explain
there's a difference in cost to-justify the difference in
original payment, it's not discriminatory?
MR. OLIPHANT:

I think that’s partially correct.

I think beyond that, I think you have to look at the total

value package of what the employee is getting end —
QUESTION:

What I'm really asking, I suppose, in

14
General Electric, as I understand the case, they held there
was no prima facie case.

1 don't know whether you're arguing

there's no prima facie case, or that, if there’s a prima facie
case w® have an affirmative defease that overcomes this.
MR. OLIPHANT:
For two reasons!

No, I say thsrs's no prima faci® case.

one, because w@ were not discriminating,

because of the equal value, if you will, of the packages,
•the female actually gets more dollars*”and'*cents in value, but
it's equal in terras of actuarial basis.

But more than that

because the Bennett Amendment itself to Section 703(h) in
effect says it shall not be an unlawful employment practice
to differentiate, on the basis, it says, in determining the
amount paid ox* to be paid in compensation or wages, so long
as it's allowed by th© Equal Pay Act.
And X think a legislative history is vary clear this
was allowed by the Equal Pay Act.
QUESTION:

Of course I 'thought th® Bennett Amendment

provided affirmative defenses, that’s really why I asked that
question.
You say they qualify the prima facia case.
MR. OLIPHANT:

I think th®y do, Your Honor.

In

Bowman vs. Franks, this Court said the whole of Section 70 3(h)
was definitional of th© Act. And I think that's what Congress
intended.
Th© Equal Pay Act does not require equal amounts of

15
compensation.

It's not an economically — it' a not designed

to "take over an employer's business and say. This is the lev®!
of compensation you’ll provide? all it does is it prohibits
payments of different, ratas of wages between the sexes, for
equal work, where there is no other factor other than sex as a
basis for the differential»

'

In this particular csss the department pays the sarr®
gross salary schedule, and to that extent the wage rata is the
same»

Takehome is less, but, as we pointed out, the contribu­

tion is not lost, it's merely deferred to a later time.

And

at that same time larger matching amount, is paid on behalf of
the females for retirement.
✓

If we turn around and gave the gross salary to the
males and females and said:

Go and buy your own annuity.

Private industry would charge the females mom than the males.
Wa would not have violated Title VII.

We would be paying them

the same gross salary.
Tha only difference between that situation and our
situation is that tee department is providing the plan instead,
doing what is properly private industry, and, -in addition, is
contributing extra money for the females than for tee males.
QUESTION s

Mr. oliphant, under your new state law,

you are now making equal payments, aren't you?
MR. OLIPHANT:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Have you had any threats of suite by males

IS
MR® OLIPHANTs

. W© have complaints, I think we have

about til re© complaints to the EEOC by ra&la groups®

On

different — the one that's in the Appendix by the Architects
and Engineers Association, w© really don’t know what they're
complaining about at this point, because we haven't received &
complaint® But essentially what their cause is is that benefits
and contributions are unequal®
QUESTION: Well, 1 take it you feel that th© new
State law is completely constitutional?
MR® OLIPHANT:

Within — well, all that th© State law

has said is that we must equalize®

What we have don© in order

to comply with that is th® department's paid th© difference.
We have essentially footed th© bill®
I think an employer can do -that, pay additional, if
h© wants to foot that bill; but. that's not th© question before
•fell© Court, today®
QUESTIONs

We11, why doesn’t he violata Titi® VII?

Why couldn’t a man sue him for violating Title VII, if he does
that?
MR. QLIPHANT; Wall, Titia VII, 7. think, deals with
differences 3,a. compensation —- I take you to th© Equal Pay Act,
which talks about wages.

If wages does not include pensions,

then I don't think we have any problem®

I think the problem

that arises is probably the Equal Pay Act problem, that we are
paying mar© total compensation, to males — I'm sorry, to females

17
than to males because we're paying 1*® difference? and the
question is whether that violates the Equal Pay Act.
And that's another qu@st.ion down the road.
I think the question her® is whether w® were violating
Title VI!»

The fact that w© may have equalised because we're

required to by State law, I don’t think that indicates that w@
were violating the statute b@£or®.

I don’tthink w© were.

W©

wera treating both equitably.
It seems to me this is on® of those Gordian knots
■that the Court is going to b® faced with:

the males on on©

side and the females vn the other.
QUESTION: Well, of course, there's no doubt that a
federal law supersedes a State law on a subject, unless there's
a

if it’s addressed to the same subject, unless there's an

express or implied exception to allow the State to legislate*
And when you're legislating equality, it’s hard to say that the
federal statute requires ©quality but permits a Stata to requires
even more equality.
MR. OLIPHANT:

I think that would b© true, unless

you were getting into a Tenth Amendment area.

That would

depend on whether you're talking about civil rights or simply
regulating commerce.
QUESTION:

I want to b& sura of your position.

MR. OLIPHANT:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Justice Rehnqulst obviously is.

IS
I think, we are —

MR. OLIPHANT:
QUESTION:

I teak® ite your position is this:

that

it’s all right to ns® objectively verifiable differentiating
factors between the saxes in the determination of these ratas,
but that you're not required to.

And sine® the change in your

law, you've gon© along with it, and I teak® ite from what you juste
said, you think tills i.s all right.
MR. OLIPHANT:

I don’t think ite would h© appropriate

to us© unisex tables, Your Honor, because there the males would
be paying for the females.

I think the difference —» this is

ray own personal view — the difference is that, her© the
employer* is paying teh® extra himself.
But it doas impact on males, and we will be faced
with that potential lawsuit from males, as 'feli® State© of
California is.
QUESTION;

As: Mr. Justice Rehnquist suggested, the

females are getting higher pay for the sauna work, total pay,
if you take into account the annuity.
MR. OLIPHANT:
QUESTION:
Circuit, is it;

That’s correct.

That is correct.

Well, your complaint about the — Ninth

Ninth Circuit ©pinion is that it requires

that things which are different be treated as though they w©r©
th© same.
MR. OLIPHANT:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

It’s

just as much a denial of equal protection to treat things that

19
ara dissimilar as equals, as it is to treat things -that are
equal in & dissimilar fashion»
QUESTION:

Could the same argument b@ mad© about

smokers end non-smokers, on© subsidises the other?

MR. OLIPHANT:

The argument could be made, Your Honor,

but it doesn't malt© s«ans© in terms of annuitizes®

Because ~~

QUESTIONS Well, aren’t ther® studies that show that
the longevity of & non-smoker is greater than the longevity of
& smoker?
MR. OLIPHANT:

That's true, Your Honor.

But if I

were a non ~~ if I were a smoker — well, let me put it this
way:

if I’m going to buy an annuity and they will give me a

lower rate because I am a smoker, I will com© in as a smoker
and a drinker and overweight, whatever I can do to gat th©
lowest rate.
QUESTION:

Well, these are not identifiable

differences, though, so far as the actuaries are concerned.
Is there any way that you can measure how long a parson has
smoked and how many packages ho smokes & day, the way you can
measure the longevity of a man against a woman?
MR. OLIPHANT:

No, Your Honor, because these factors

are within the control of the individual.

I caa stop smoking

tomorrow, I can stop drinking tomorrow, th® day after I bought
my annuity.

That's b&®n our experience, Your

Honorj very definitely.
QUESTION!

But when you say this is your experience,

you're not suggesting that this is the experience that has yet
bean reflected by the pervasive actuarial studies of the
American Experience Table of Mortality?
MR. OLIPHANT:

Ail that I have seen of actuarial

studies has shown that the more females that coma in the work
force the longer the life expectancy they have.

And I sea

nothing to show that the stress jobs make any difference.
As a matter of fact*, in those areas where males and
females have similar jobs, such as in teaching, the difference
seems to carry on the same.

The statistics of Teachers

Insurance, cm) of the amici., indicate that female teachers live
just

.s much longer than male teachers as females in the

general population live longer than males.
I think.. Your Honor, I'd like to reserve time for
rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. DOHRMANN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR,, DOHRMANN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the Courts
This case is brought by woman employees of the Los
Angeles Department: of Water and Power and by the union that
represents many of them, the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers, Local 18.
We ar© challenging an explicit sex classification
which violates 703 of Title VII of 1*,® Civil Rights Act*
It is an explicit violation of that Act, it is express
discrimination in every case; money is taken from a woman’s
paychiack and not from a man’s for one reason and on® reason
alone.

MR. DOHRMANN;

Mr. Chief Justice, as the United Auto

Workers end &s the JLFL-CJQ point out, and indeed as the
Society of Actuaries point out in the brief that they have filad
with this Court, most plans in America are sex neutral.

This

is a rare plan that requires a mandatory contribution from th©
employee, and discriminates between employees on th© basis of

24

sex.

It is a vary rare ©ventu
And I know of no such litigation in which msn, in

MR* DOHRM&NN:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, in order to

reach feat conclusion, ©n© must conclude feat it is lawful
lander Titi® VII to treat workers, individual workers &€ this

petitioner or any employer subject to the Act., &b men and as
women as statistics rather fean as individual workers.

And

fee,t practice is irciparmissibl© under Title VII, and this

It is improper and it’s unlawful to treat women as

QUESTION:

Is it unlawful fox a life insurance company

25
to charge mere for women's annul'hies than, for men?
MR. DOHRM&NNj

In the insurance context, not at all,

because th© insurance industry is net regulated by Congress to
require that.
Let mo give an example of that, if I may.

If this

employer, instead of operating a pension fund, had a severance
pay trust, in which

several cents per hour are put into a

severance pay fund and at the @nd of the employment# whatever
it is, 'that money, lump sum, is given to the employes©.

That

employee may g© to an insurer, whether he be a male or a
female, and purchase an annuity.

And at that point in time,

having left', the employment context, maybe the woman would pay
more for the annuity than the man, maybe not? but, in any event-,,
there is no longer the employment context and the practice
need not b® judged and cannot ba judged under Title VII.
QUESTION: Well, you don't challenge the accuracy ©£

the fact that the insurance company

of a certain amount, and the man has a certain lesser life
expectancy, and therefore we have to charge you more, the woman.
You don't challenge the accuracy of those?
MR. DOHRMANNs

Ths accuracy of it?

Mo.

Once you

divide men and women, as the insurance industry has commonly

26
don®, you will find that: a woman, on the average, lives longer
than a man»
QUESTION %

And if you were sailing an annuity to a

woman as distinguished from a man, and you could — and you
thought that it might cost you more to provide th© annuity,
because: the woman has & greater life expectancy, you'd probably

Yes.

MR» DOKRMANN:

it is as simple to classify on the basis of other factors —

MR. DOIIRMANN:

Mr. Justice Relinquish, may I say

that at th® Department ©f Water and Power ©f fee City of Los

MR. DOHRMANN:

Yes, sex is Immutable»

Amsmdment in the Equal Pay Act?
MR» DOHRMANN;

This practice could only b© saved

if i3i© factor used to deduct the 15 percent from the paycheck
is, quota, "any other factor other than sex", end quote»
QUESTGNs Why do you suppose th®y use the word’"other"
twice in that statute?
MR» DOHRMANN:

Because I think the Congress wanted

to make clear, and I think the Committee Reports underscore
this,

that other factors, such as merit systems, seniority

systems, lifting weight requirements, those other factors,
aeutrzJ. as far as sax is concerned, would b© employable by an
employer i:a setting a wage rat©»
Another factor other than esx»

I adopt what the

court below said in tills case, it is playing with words to
say that this practice is based on any factor other than sex.
So the Bennett Amendment, 703(h), is simply not
available as a. defense in this case»

37
QUESTION: Well, do you think it is a defense, or
do you think it's one of the things that plaintiff needs to
prove, the absence of the factors of the Bennett Amendment?
MR. DOHRMANN:

No, I don't think it's on the burden

of the plaintiff to show that the Bennett Amendment is not
a defens©, I think it's an affirmative defense of th© employer,
and the employer has failed to ma®t it.
The employer bar© has said that it is seeking to

MR. DOHRMANN:
Jy -tuc© White.

You correctly stated it earlier, Mir.

In this case wa have two groups, we have rasa and
we have women.

They d±© at different times, but they are

charged differently for the privilege of having a retirement
income that is the same.

And the women are the ones that have

to pay more for it.
QUESTION:

I taka it from your statement that you

concede that they, on the average statistically, will receive
tfe© retirement for & longer period?
MR. DQHRMANMs

If there is such a thing as a

statistical Individual, that, statistical individual will get
more; but there is no such thing in the ©yes of the law, Mr.
Chief Justice, in my humble opinion.

In my opinion, the law

requires that, they b® treated as individuals, that these woman
at Water and Power be treated as individuals, and that they
receive the same treatment as men';' that they not be treated
as women and charged something more for the disputable benefit
or privilege of being a woman.

It just dees not follow.

to do the work assigned is the key that will be the decision ~~

MR* pOHRMMJN: There is an opinion letter of general

This

was —

hell, this was the general counsel of

th© EEOCa
MR, DOHHMANNi

That was from tha general counsel?

h© was not the Commission itself, he was the general counsel.

I understand that, but he's speaking on

HR, DOHRMANN;

That expression in that letter is

incised in conflict with the EEOC’s own guidelines*

Y®s*

MR* DOHRMANNs

However, the government, has pointed

out in its

But the guidelines weren’t in existence

at that time, were they?
MR* DOHRMANN:

No* The guidelines 'that I’m now

speaking of had not — did not come out until IS72«
QUESTION: Th©y camsa out eight years after ths
enactment of Title VII, didn’t; they?
MR. DOHRMANN:

That’s correct.

«ay I point out, however, — Mr. Justice White,
may I point out. two quick things?

Ons is that that latter

of the EEOC general counsel earns after the EEOC itself* in
[sic]
the Four-til Circuit cases of Rp;sen^ v.j Puh 1 ic Sarvice Corporation
— the EEOC issued a letter determining that the practice in
'Rzmmt

which involved similar practices her®, as well as

idatory

Lrement ages based on sex, but financial

differences as wall*
The EEOC determined in Roaen that that practice
violated the Act*

And that extermination, upon which the

l&wsuit had been commenced in Rosen, was prior to this one

47
isolated letter written, by the general counsel to a privata
company, which was published by a service, and if you will
look at the provision in the Federal Register that is cited
in the government's brief you will find that there is an EEOC
statement that letters issued by the general counsel are for
the purpose of private advice to particular inquirers, and
that they do not have the fore® of precedent, and they are
only to b© for th© personal us© of the individual or company
to whom tli® latter is written0
QUESTIONs

You mean it applies only to that

particular company and to nona other?
MR. DOHRMANN;

It is a private reply of the general

counsel to a letter — to a request for a private ruling.

MR. DOHRMANN:

Most definitely I challenge it, Mr.

Justice White, if for no other reason than th© Commission
itself lad issued cause det©r.ainatipns in cases as early as
Rosen, and a determination in th© Rosen case was issued very
early in 1365,

:n you will not® from both th© district court

and th® circuit ©pinions, discussing th© background of the
C£S®So

Mr® Chi®f Justice, in th© tin® that remains , I
would lik® to point out ‘that 1972, when this Act was amended,
the Congress noted that, to its dismay, in, the years sine©
1964 when Titi® VII was enacted, women's position in arnploymeat had not only not improved, it seemed to have slightly
deteriorated.

And Congress very clearly enunciated, when it

mad® this Act applicable to this employer, that discrimination
against women Is no less serious than any other form of
prohibited discrimination, and the same degree of social
concern applies to it.
presented to you a vary clear case in which this
employer has taken sex and ©ex alone and, on the basis of
that, made-a very suspect determination that all women are
going t,o live longer than.- all man.

A conclusive presumption

that, whether my cliente be tower line mechanics or secretari.es,
o'.L'y a.-s go mg to live longer than the males beside whom they
perform work for th© same pricey and that's not fair, and we
‘;:‘k fo.v .affirmance of th® Ninth Circuit’s decision.

longer.

Is it on® percentage for man and another

MR. DOIIRMANNs

That’s correct.

QUESTION; And is it. the — for all men, is it Idle

HR. DOIIRMANN:

No.

It depends also upon the age

In other words, if an employee enters the

MR» DOHRMANN:
Stewart.

No, thstr© has not, Mr* Justice

The reason that, as this Court recognised in Mann v*

MR. DOHRMANN:

That may be, but it’s not my case.

QUESTION: Someone else put a question to you, and
I want to see if I can clarify it.

That if a union negotiated

with the employer and says — and agreed that ’’we’re going to

Each individual will go out into tins insurance

price than each other.
QUESTION s

Is there anything that you can point, to

that supports the idea that women can buy annuiti.es cheaper
than men can buy them?
MR. DOHRMANN:

No, out all I know is that osic® the

severance pay has been made# She employee then leaves the
employment relationship, and what she does with the money is
no longer subject to the provisions of Titi® VII of the
Civil Rights Act.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. OLIPHANT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. OLIPHANT:

Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to address

very quickly the administrative agency point, first# that was
made.
On® of tli@ problems in tills case has been teh©
chopping and changing ©pinions of the EEOC, and it's not
true that the 1966 opinion letter of Charles Duncan was the
only time that the EEOC said that they would follow the
practice of unequal contributions to support equal benefits,
or equal contributions to support unequal benefits, Which is
what the Department'of Labor's bulletin, 800.151, recognises.
In our brief, in our reply brief, at the Court of
Appeals level, w© referred to a speech that was delivered to
the Industrial Relations Research Association on April 16th
of 1969, when Sonya Pressman, senior attorney of the Office
of the General Counsel of the EEOC, stated:

"The Commission

to date has also followed, .the equal contributions or equal
benefits standards of the Labor Department."

Labor Law

Exporter, Exployms&it Practices, new development, 1969.
CCH, paragraph 8004.
QUESTION: When did — how about the annual report
of the EEOC, did they rsflsct a change in view earlier than
that?

Or later than that?
MR. OLIPHANT:

I don't think they reflected a change

53
in view until about 1972»
The problem is that the Department of Labor
specifically, in its guidelines, and the EEOC at. least through
Its general corns©!, recognized you've got this problem in
front of you,
QUESTION;

This is a sp©©ch of the general counsel»

MR, OLIPHANT:
QUESTION;

That’s true.

And that, has what effect, if any?

MR* OLIPHANT;

I think it's indicative of the way

th© Commission feels*
QUESTION;

It could have been a purely political

speech.

MR. OLIPHANT;

That’s true.

But it’s indicative,

at least —
QUESTION;

Do you want m® to rely on that as —

well, do you want m© to rely on it?
MR. OLIPHANT:
QUESTION;

No.

I would like you to —

Then why bother us with it?

MR. OLIPHANT: To indicate that the EEOC had taken
differant positions, that its staff had taken different
positions *
QUESTION; That a scomber of the staff had taken &
differant position; thafc’s all you’re saying.
MR* OLIPHANT;

More than on® member* Your Honor.

MR. OLIPHANT:

Well, the first was the general

counsel in —»

QUESTION:

Are you going to give me another speech?

I shouldn't have asked the question.
MR. OLIPHANTs
QUESTIONs

I'm not, interested in spQ®ch@s.

MR. OLIPHANT:
QUESTION :

Charles Duncan.

Well, tli® guidelines —

I can only speak for myself.

MR, OLIPHANT:

Th® guidelines of the Department of

Labor specifically recognized this problem, and allowed the
"either/or", equal benefits or equal contributions, solution.
The oth©r guideline of the Department of Labore and
it is just that, a guideline, nothing more, an interpretative
bulletin, 800.151 s&ys that costs may not be taken into
account', in determining fringe benefits, -for males or females.
And that particular guideline is plainly contrary to th®
legislative history of the Act, where both Houses said that
costs e£ employment of feraal.es may b© taken into account.
And thnt legislative history is in th® back of our opening

brief, Your Honor.
QUESTION:
mar© on tha

Mr, Oliphant, could you help m@ a little

perhaps it's in th© papers and I missed it,

but on th© way is, which th© contribution Is mad®?

I under­

stand thorp's a larger contribution by th© female than by tha
male.

Is th© difference dsp-snding on th© age at which the

55

employee entered th© employment?
MR. GLJPHANT:
QUESTIONs

That's correct..

Mow, what *•“ which is higher?

Say? I

cam® in at 30 and someone else came in at 35; which would
make the higher contribution?
MR* OLIPHANTs

The older age would make the higher

contribution, because there's less period of tine to
accumulate sufficient funda to pay for your retirement.
QUESTION;

But also there's less longevity.

QUESTION;

No, no,

MR. OLIPHANTs

No, because you*r® retiring at 65,

QUESTION;

A parson 35 years old has a lesser, or a

greater longevity, 1 guess, doesn't he?
MR. OLIPHANTs

From 35, ha does, but not ~~ but

they're all retiring at. the same age, 60 or 65.
QUESTION;

The longevity h® talks about is when

they're apt to die.
MR. OLIPHANTs

Right.

QUESTION; And you say the one who comes into the
work force aa an older person pays a higher?
MR. OLXPHANT:

Because he pays for fewer years.

v
QUESTION?
He's going to make payments for fewer
years.
MR. OLIPHANT:
QUESTION:

Right.

Mr. Qliph&nt, to put it another ways

Are all of these other things decided before tha additional
amount is put on?

I mean, the ag© of tha employe©, at cetera,

at cetera, at cetera; are all of those put in before he -takes
the 15 off?
MR. OLIPHANT:
QUESTIONs

No, the — well —

You've taken account of a whole lot of

things.
MR. OLIPHANT:
QUESTION:

Right. And then —
Well, let me — do you do it — do you

talcs tha deduction in front ox at the and?
MR. OLIPHANT:

Ws fake the contribution and tha

14.84 percent was just an average which was figured for
purposes of this lawsuit.
QUESTION:

Oh, I secs.

MR. OLIPHANT:

But longevity is a function of age and

sex, and in order to da termines that w-a go to the actuarial
tables.

Arid from the actuarial tables, it’s factored into the

contribution rata.
QUESTION*

And -Mr. Oilplant, does the record explain how

57
the differing contributions for ©sch year were calculated?
MR , OLI PHANT:

I don't: think it does, Your Honor,

QUESTION: So w© can't tell th® extent to which the
longevity figured as of the age of entering the employment
of th© company, to what extent age affected the contribution
rate?
MR, OLIPHANT:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, because —

The record doesn't tell us that?

.MR* OLIPHANT;

Th© interrogatories may, but I

don't, think they do, Your Honor.
This came up on sunwary judgment, and ..

Who mad® th© — oh, thay mad® th® motion.

MR, OLIPHANT:

They mad© the motion, and conceded

fch® accuracy of th© actuarial fables and th© good faith of
tha department.
QUESTION; The benefits that, are calculated are
a function of what?

Is it of th© number of — it's — tell

ms again, how is tb© ban©fit calculated?
MR. OLIPHANT:
QUESTION:

Your salary level makes no difference?

MR, OLIPHANT:
QUESTION:

Years of service and retirement age.

' And salary level, yes,

Salary — average over "she period or at

tlis retirement age?

MR, OLIPHANT:

No, -iim last year of service, th©

final average salary for th© last year of service, multiplied

58
by two perdent ox

xt's & little

now — 2.1 psirceat

for each year of service»
QUESTIONS

For each year. And the contributions are

& percentage of salary always?
MR. OLIPHANTs
questions

Yes.

I sea.

And the percentage depends on

(a) your sex and (b) your age at which you joined the company?
MRc OLIPHANTs

That's correct»

I think the important thing to recognize, in closing,
is tiiat it's not just sex, it's sex plus age, longevity, and
that, as in Gilbert, is a factor other than sex»

Just as

pregnancy was,
