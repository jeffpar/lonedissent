ORAL ARGUMENT OF RlCHARh OSERAN, E3Q . ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, OSERIL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I am Richard Oseran, here on behalf of the Petitioner
Rufus iincey.
This case concerns the trial court's admission and
Arizen' oupreme Court's affirmation of what the Petitioner con­
tends to be unlawfully seized evidence and an inadmissible
statement.
The first question before this Court is whether there
is a compelling need to permit a warrantless general search at
the scene cf certain suspected crimes, specifically a possible
j' onic ode or a crime invclVin: a sericos bodily injury, where
tr ere is no exigency and there is ample time to obtain a warrant

C'.U.SSTICJi:

If we rule for you on your first point,

the Arizona, scene if murder exception, wouldn't that more or
less moot out the second point, or at least make whatever we
said on that an advisory opinion, since, as I understand It,
the hospital conversations were used only In the murder trial?
MR* QSERAN:

Mo, Your Honor.

One of the counts was

a sale, and if you rule for me on the first question, the un­
lawful search under the Fourth Amendment, that would suppress
narcotics that were seized, but there doesn't have to he nar­
ce tics for the crime of offer to sell or sale to have been
commitbed,

Therefore, the second question would still be at

issue in the second trial on that charge.
QUESTION:

Are.you positive about this?

I share

Just lea Eehnqv.ist *s feeling that the voluntariness issue bore
only on the assault and murder counts.
HR. OSERbN:

MR. GSER'N:

X would agree with that, but I think the

question of the voluntariness of the statements is

.part of the

d rug c onv ic t i on,
I will initially confine the facts and argument to
the first question.

On October 23, 197^» nine undercover

disguised police officers and the county attorney forced entry
into the Petitioner's residence by means of a ruse.

The armed

plainclothes officer, the first one in, ran straight back to
the bedroom where tie Petitioner was and where his girl friend
lay sleeping.

Gunfire erupted Immediately, leaving four people

seriously wounded, the Petitioner, the girl friend, the dis­
guised. officer anc one occupant of the apartment that was
struck 'by e bullet that came out from, the wall of the bedroom..

secured prior to the commencement

The residence had beer

of the exhaustive search and the purpose of the search would
not have been frustrated by the officers attempting to obtain
a warrant.
QUESTION:

You say, then, even though they stayed

only ten minutes and only tried to ascertain whether the
person was, in fact, dead, and looked immediately a round the
body,

it still would have required a warrant?
MR. OS ERIK*:

I don't think that what was seen in

but that’s not before this Court — If they are lawfully at
a certain place, what they can see in plain view, I think,

QU.36TIGN:

Let me see if I have this clear.

to the evidence that was ~~ to any evidence that was secured on
the day of this gun battle?
MR, CSERAN:

That there is no challenge, at this point

in time, before this Court, but there may well be a challenge
when we go back to trial on whether or not the entry was lawful.
But. assuming for purposes of argument here that the entry was
lawful, then what was seen in plain view .which would not be the
result of the search would be admissible.

It was the more in­

directing my argu enfc toward.

There

v:£a no reasonable or rational basis, although the Respondent
contends otherwise, that a search was needed for the detection
or the solution of the crime or the protection of the public.
The rationale of the suspected crime scene emergency,
if it is viable here, then it is viable at the scene of all
crimes and the principles of personal security, personal pri­
vacy and private property, as well as personal liberty, would
be sacrificed along with the P.ourth Amendment.

trustworthy and admissible for impeachment.

But a statement

made in violation of Miranda would only be admissible for a
limited purpose* if* in fact, it was elicited on direct examin­
ation* and if it was perjurious.

There was no perjury here

and the prosecutor should not be allowed to make that impli­
cation.

At most there was seme ambiguity.

Of the three

responses that the prosecutor sought to impeach* two were
elicited by him' on cross-examination.

In one* which can be

found in the Appendix at page 83* was a comment on his silence.
The questioning on cross-examination by the prosecutor was:
"You didn’t tell the Officer Hust at that time that the officer
shot you first., did you* Mr, Mincey?"
ask me. *'

His response:

The impeaching question* then:

"He didn’t

"He did ask you at

one point in there if you had anything else to acid* didn't he?’
This is the question* if we can believe the officer's con­
struction of what he had asked.

The answer:

"Yes* sir* I think

my answer at that time was I couldn't, say anything without seeing
a lawyer first."

In fact* what the question and answer had

been on page 4A of the Appendix to Petitioner's brief and pages
40 and 41 of the Respondent's brief:
you wart to tell us?"

Answer:

"Is there anything else

"If it is possible to get a

lawyer now. we can finish the talk."

He also v/as attempted to

be impeached by a statement as to whether or not he knew it
was a bust at the time of the incident.

In his statement* he

had referred to it as a "bust*11 but this is after he had been

15
told by the officer that it was a bust*

It was also after the

time when he said, "Which one was the police officer?
the one in cowboy boots?”

Who, in fact,, was the deceased

officer.
There was another statement elicited by me on direct
examination, regarding whether or not the man running towards

examination with, ”1 can't say for sure.

MR. OS ERA N:

What they used to impeach him with was

a statement that he "didn’t know whether the man that came intc
the bedroom had a gun,"

Well, obviously, he knew the deceased

officer had a gun because at that', time he knew he had been shot.
There was no reason for not. obtaining a warrant.

The

evidence admitted against the Petitioner was seized unlawfully,
and the judgment of the Arizer:' Supreme Court should be reversed.
The statements of the Petitioner made in the intensive care unit
were involuntary, untrustworthy.

It was obvious to the

Petitioner that his rights would not be complied with by
the officer and his statements were the result of his over­
borne will.

They were not inconsistent with his testimony at

trial and should not have been admitted for any purpose.

And

that decision of the Arizona Supreme Court in that regard
should be reversed as well,

ORAL ARGUMENT CP GALEN H, V/I IKES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF' THE RESPONDENT
MR. WILKES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

18
Court:
Today, I would like to divide my argument up into two
segments *
The first argument I would like to deal with is the
issue of the search-

And to begin with- I think it is extremely

important to look at some of the facts that were present there
at the apartment back on October 28, 197^.
The officers, to begin with, were lawfully inside the
Petitioner's apartment.

One of their number, Mr- Hedricks, had

just been into the apartment and had observed heroin in the
apartment.

The Petitioner had shown him heroin and offered to

sell it to him,

The officer. Officer Hedricks, said that he

wanted to purchase the heroin and that he was going to go out­
side to his money man to get the money and come back and pur­
chase the heroin.

Officer Hedricks left the apartment, walked

out to the parking lot, saw Detective Schwartz -- all this time.'
what had been transpiring in the apartment had been broadcast
to the other police officers — he was telling them, "I’ve seer'

I’ve run the test.'1

in.

Hodgman pushed the door shut and Hedricks burst or;

Schwartz had his shoulder in the door.

There was testimony

that he, at that time, said, "Police," "Police Officers," some­
thing of this nature, and then Schwartz and Lieutenant Puller
who was behind him got into the apartment.

By this time,

Officer Hedricks was into the bedroom where the shooting took
place.

At about the time that the shooting does take place,

Lieutenant Fuller looks up into the hallway of this small
apartment.

This is not a real large apartment here we are

talking about»

This is just a small, one-bedroom apartment.

He looks up in the hallway, to the left would be the bathroom
and to the right would be the bedroom, and he sees Ferguson
there in the hallway.

He goes up to Ferguson, puts him up

against the door, up against the wail.

About this time, the

bullets start to fly and from the bedroom the shots begin,
and within a matter of seconds the shooting is all* over with.
when the shooting is over with, .detective Hedricks comes out
of the bedroom and falls down, goes down in the hallway, says,
"I’m down," something of this nature.

The other policemen go

into the bedroom, "two of them go in and they see the Petitioner

ic>o without a search warrant and pursuant to the policy
that was followed by the Tucson Police department, Officer
Reyna, .eight minutes after the.shooting took place, began an
immediate investigation of the premises, a search of the
premises, to determine what had happened there.
The dtata recognizes that this Court has held on many
occasions that you ‘ve got to get a search warrant before you can
go in and have a search, that - it is unreasonable if you don't.
But this Court has also recognized that there are exceptions,such as border searches, stop and frisks, exigent circumstances
with fleeing autos, items that are in plain view.
that I an, asking you to do here today is to make the
Arizona murder scene exception another exception to the Fourth

21

Amendment which requires the obtaining of a search warrant prior
to conducting a search.
QUESTION:

Or at sometime.

Have you gotten a search

warrant for that place yet?
MR» WILKES:
QUESTION:
MR. WliJCSs:

No, Your Honor, we haven't.
And that's the exception you want.
Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION: That you don't need a search warrant at all,
MR, VilliCSo:
QUESTION:
MR. VJILKES:
mind hare.

That's correct. Your Honor.
That's what you want.
And I think several questions come to

The first question, I think, and probably the most

important is:

Why don't we need to get a search warrant?

is it necessary to have this search here?

Why

Why was it necessary

for Officer Reyna to begin an immediate search of this apart­
ment, without getting a search warrant?
I think the first answer to this is the fact that this
was a murder scene.

He came in there and some of the blood was

still vet when he got in there.
QUESTION:

It was important

What did they find in the search that

affected the murder scene?
MRo. WIIKEE:

That affected the murder scene?

Okay,

the found bullets ~~
QUESTION:

They found them the first night.

that did they find five nights later that applied to

22

the murder?
MR, WILKES:

Okay,

On the 23th, the second day, they

did dig a bullet out of the wall,
QUESTION:

What did they find the first day?

MR, WILKES :

That’s where you found the narcotics,

you found the bullets, you took the gun
QUESTION:

How long after the shooting was the nar­

cotics found?
MR, WILKIE:

1 can't give you an exact timing.

was in that first timeframe.

It

The first time that Officer Reyna

was there prior to going home on the evening of the 28th.
So it was real;ly necessary for them to get in there
to start this search,
QUESTION:

You make it sound like this was awfully

complicated and quite an affair.

But let’s make it simple.

A man calls up and says, "I have just shot my wife, come and
arrest me..'

And the police come and they come in and they

arrest him.

I take it you suggest that right then and there --

the wife is lying there dead just like he said — the police
may then undertake a complete search of the household.
MR. WILKES:
QUESTION:
MR. W.TIKES :
QUESTION:
•j

Yes, Your Honor, that's what I am saying.
Why doesn’t Chimel bar that?
Chimel — there is a problem there.
What do you mean there is a problem?

re you having a problem with Chimel?

23
MR. WIIKEi:

Well, It was a problem when .1 read this

and did this, Your Honor.
First of all, I think this can be approached two ways.
First of all, I think we can say this isn't a Chlmel case.

This

Isn't a case where you are coming in and going to arrest a man
for, you know, breaking into a coin shop here.
QUESTION:

You are arresting him for murder, and you

say you can make as broad a search as you want, not. four
days only.
MR. WILKES:

Yes.

For one thing here, you dont know

--- Lieutenant Reyna here didn't know what he was facing.

He

had this blood, you know, it was still important to determine
the time of death here.

When you have this blood here it is

important to get into this and do it right away.
Another ease we had a problem with in Arizona was
State

7.

Skinner.

In that particular case-

it ’was. .also a

murder case — it wasn't decided on the murder scene exception,
but when the police officers came to the liquor store, they
found a cigarette and the cigarette was partially burnt and
they used the cigarette at trial to help establish when the
shooting had, in fact, occurred here.

And you don't know when

you get on a scene, when you come in and you find a dead body
here, what else is there that might dissipate, what might dis ­
appear.

And this is one of the reasons why I think you need

to be able to have this thorough examination.

24
QUESTION:

'Well, the officer could stay there until

they got a search xvarrant.
MR, WILKEE:
Officer Reyna

At this point, Your Honori. I don’t think

enough information to get a search warrant.

QUESTION:

Oh, Mr. Wilkes, you described quite a

situation and say there wasn't probable cause?

Are you serious

about that?
MR. WILKES:

When he walked in the door,, yes,

I don*

think a police officer, at that point in time, would feel com­
fortable calling up and getting a search warrant.

He is going

to want to do more investigation to see what more is going on,
4

QUESTION:

You mean with the bodies and the blood

and the bullets there is not probable cause?
MR, WILKES:

Are you serious?

.1 took the time -- I called the various

police agencies around Arizona and this was the answer that
I got, that they would want to do more investigation before
they went and got a search warrant.
QUESTION:

Well, that's right, because they wouldn't

want ever to get a search warrant.

That's your submission, so

naturally they wouldn’t.
MR, WILKES:

At least as far as when you are dealing

here with this special, unique situation of a
QUESTION:

They want to completely investigate

everything without ever getting a search warrant.

That's your

submission and, naturally, that's what the police want.

25
MR, WILK,.i>:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Aren't you contradicting yourself to a

certain extent when you say, on the one hand, that it should be
judged as an exigent circumstance.

Things are happening so fast

that at least in order to find out who's dead and who's alive
and evidence in plain view, once you have reasonable cause to
think it was a homicide you've got a right to enter the premises,
but then you say you don't think the police would have probablecause to get a warrant.
MR. WILKES:

What 1 am saying here, Your Honor, is

that they would want to do more.

They would want to get a

better foundation, other than when Officer Renya came in and
he sees this on the floor, the bullets, bodies, this sort of
thing, that he is not going to want to get a -•-*
QUESTION:

What does that have to do with getting the

warrant, as the questions are suggested to you?

It is pretty

well known by now that there has beer, a lot of carnage here,
isn't it?
MR* WILKES:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
You wouldn’t have any difficulty sitting

down and in fifteen minutes writing out the description that you
have given us in fifteen minutes, would you?
. MR. WILKES :
QUESTION:

No,
And if you . did that, if you. put down in

writing what you have just' told us in fifteen minutes, would you

have any difficulty getting the warrant?

QUESTION:
MR, WIIK.de:

You might not, Your Honor,

You may be

But, v.hat I would also answer is this «•Well, hew many bodies would you need?
Probably one would be sufficient, Your

Honor,
QUESTION:
MR, WILKES:

That's what you had here.
You had one body and you had three other

people seriously injured.
Another reason here is the fact that -- Let me start
all over again here.

XI is cur position, too, that granted you

have got a problem here, but if you could go in and you could
make that initial waIk-through of the apartment, or you come
in there and you can see what{s on the floor.

If that initial

intrusion is okay, then it is our position that you shouldn't
have to be required to get ore later on. As long as the initial
intrusion is correct here, then it shouldn't be necessary to,
somewhere down the line,decide well, now that maybe I’ve got
two bodies here or maybe I’ve found this much more, maybe I
should get one.

It seems like if you car: go ahead and make the

27

Initial search here* the fact that you don't get one later on
shouldn't vitiate the whole search here.
QUESTION:

Are you familiar with the Chadwick case

which was decided in the last preceding term?
MR, WILKES:
QUESTION:

Yes. Your Honor,
Well, wasn't all of the evidence, once

the belies had been removed, wasn't all the evidence capable of
being made absolutely secure by the presence of a couple of
officers, just as we held in Chadwick that the exclusive pos­
session of the agents, Federal agents, was sufficient barrier
to a search without a warrant?
MR, WILKES:

I would answer you. this way, Your Honor,

If you agree that you can lock up, say, the apartment, keep
people from going in and out.
QUESTION:
MR. WILKES:
here..

Lock it up and put two policemen in there,
You are intruding upon Petitioner's rights

You are intruding by doing that.

from going in or out.

You are preventing him

It seems like you are just one degree

further in: intrusion ir you allow the officers to go around
and to make this search*
QUESTION:

I would submit

What I was addressing myself to was making

it secure just long enough tc get that warrant.
MR, WILKES:

Yes, you could do this, but we are

arguing that you need not to in this particular situation here,
QUESTION:

Because of the somewhat unique, or unique

28

Arizona lav;?
MR, Vfll&iS :

Right,

Another thing, Your Honor, is the fact that at this
point.in time the defendant's expectation of privacy has really
been diminished, just about to nil, because he really doesn't
have that much to lose.

Here you've got a man who has shot a

police officer five times, or shot somebody in his house five
i

times.

He's got to anticipate that somebody's going to come ir

there to investigate what all this shooting is about.
expect that people aren't going to do anything.

He can't

He has to

expect that someone is going to come in here and try to deter­
mine why and what has happened here.

So he really doesn't have;

that much expectation of privacy.
Second of all, when you've got a situation here whe*re
you have the initial intrusion, which I believe, is lawful, any
further intrusion, that is the walking through here, the picking
up of the bullets, whatever, this other intrusion is going to
be minor, that is, it is not going to be that increased by
allowing the officers to go through there and not get a warrant;.
QUESTION:

Was there probable cause to arrest any of

these people, in your opinion, at the time that Officer s?:eyna
arrived on the scene?
MR, WILKES:

Yes, there probable was.

Well, at least

— are you talking about the drugs?
QUESTION:

Yell, I am trying to reflect a little bit

29

on your response to the Chief Justice about securing the
premises»

I take it simply securing the premises and letting

all of the people who had been on the premises go would not
have sufficed for purposes of adequate law enforcement.
MR. WILKES:

No, it would not, because you had these

people there that had taken place in that drug sale here.

You

also had a situation where a police officer walked into a bed»
roora and he comes out shot,and you go in there and you find a
gun underneath the Petitioner and you find another lady in there
who is wounded.

So I think you would at least have probable

cause to arrest the Petitioner who you would find with an empty
gun under his body there.
QUESTION:

Well, the entry, the original entry was

for the purpose, I suppose, of making drug arrests, wasn't it?
MR. WILKES:
QUESTION:

Yes, it was.
And we don't have before us now whether

or not there was probable cause to make that entry for that
purpose, but certainly I assume the officers thought so.
MR. WILKES:

Right.

Well, I think that it is clear

that they did have probable cause to get in there to make that
arrest„
QUESTION:
B, WILKES:

Well, that's not an issue before us row,
Another theory that I would like to

present to the Court, and I think another important reason for
allowing the officers to make this search, to make this walk

30
around in the apartment was the fact of the humanitarian aspect
of it here.

And I think it is very applicable here., because

had they not walked through this apartment, they may not have
found this Deborah Johnson who was laying in the closet in the
bedroom with a couple of bullets in her.

She could have bled

She may not have been able to call out for

So I think it was extremely important that

they were able to go through there, to walk through this apart­
ment .
QUESTION;

Of course, that argument doesn't justify

four days and opening dresser drawers, and all that sort of thing,
does it?
MR, WILKES;

Well, my argument again

and I don't

mean to beat a dead horse here ~~ is the fact that if the
initial walk through was okay
QUESTION:

Then it follows that they can open drawers

and go through briefcases and all that.
MR, WILKES:

Why does that follow?

In this particular situation.

First of

all, after the defendant ~~ after you come in there, you've
found all these bullets on the floor, you found the dead police
officer, these other wounded people, the expectation of privacy
of the defendant is just about nil,

action, did it not?

Does the murder scene exception justify th

I think the narcotics were

related to the homicide because it went to the motive of the
shooting itself.

MR. WILKIE:
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor,
Murder scene, I believe, is what the

Arizona Supreme Court is saying.
MR. WILKIE:

I think one of the.advantages, or

aspects of this- rule which I think maybe is important because

38
I think it indicates that it doesn't violate the basic reason
for having the Fourth Amendment, is the fact th&t you. are not
going to have general searches here because you are going to
have this officer who is going to come on there and he is
going to have these four guidelines, which the Arizona Supreme
Court has set down here.

And if it doesn’t fall within one

of these guidelines here, he is not going to be able to get
his evidence in that he wants,

The same thing is, he's going

to have to make the search relative to the crime.
QUESTION:

One other question occurred to me.

Supposing that the defendant had been killed and the officer
had not, would the exception apply?
MR, tllLKfio :

1 would think it would, yes, Your

Honor „
I think that with these prerequisites here that you are not going to have this fishing expedition because your
search is going to be limited to the circumstances of the
death here.

And where you've got these four prerequisites

set darn by the court, I think this is something that the
police officer on the beat will be able to follow,

This is

something where he can tell whether he's got 1, 2, 3 and 4.
QUESTION:

You don't need to tell us what

they are,

but where are those four?
HR. WIHK1S :

They are set out in the Supreme Court's

decision by Justice Gordon, under this particular argument.

39
QUESTION:

Usually, it is not a police officer,

it is a trained detective, isn't it?
MR. WIIK3S:

Right*

It can be. pr it may not be.

It just depends 0n.-~

you know, if you are in a small town you may not have a real
sophisticated officer.
Again, I want to emphasize here the fact that where
you've got police officers that are lawfully on the scene
and something like this occurs, the expectation of privacy
that the defendant has here is extremely limited.

There is

very little there, because ycu have a dead body here, the
officers are there lawfully cn the scene, and the fact that
they walk through, or whatever they do, the Intrusion against
the Petitioner's rights are going to be extremely limited0
Finally, we submit that this is a reasonable test
and one just built on common sense.

Reyna just should have

been allowed when he came into that apartment to have gone
through with the.search the way he did, that he should have
been allowed to start marking the evidence where he found it
so when he was going to reconstruct the crime he would know
where the telephone was or where the chair was, or where the
bullets were, so he could plot the trajectory of the shells,
or so he could prepare what had happened when they went to
trial.

This Is really something that's built on common sense,

to allow a police officer to conduct, an immediate search here,

40

when he gets onto a murder scene.
