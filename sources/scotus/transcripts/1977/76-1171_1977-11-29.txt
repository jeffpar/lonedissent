PROCEED I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll hear arguments

next: in Carter against Miller, 1171.
Mr. Quinlan, I think you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM R. QUINLAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. QUINLANs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
This case is her® on a writ of certiorari from the
Seventh Circuit, and involves what we view as two primary
issues.
The first beings

Is an ordinance that conclusively

denies issuance of a public chauffeur’s license to an applicant
convicted of a crime involving the us© of a deadly weapon
violative of tJtio equal protection clausa, because revocation
of a present licensee's previously granted license,is
discretionary after a hearing rather than mandatory?
Secondly:

t

Whether the ordinance violates the due

process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because an
applicant is presumed unfit for licensure after he has been
convicted ©£ an offense involving the use of a deadly weapon?
Th© facts in this case arcs primarily that the
respondent, Miller, submitted an application to petitioner,
Carter, who is the Chicago Public Vehicle Commissioner, for a
taxicab driver’s licenses.

It's a public chauffeur's license,

but: primarily it*s used for taxi cab drivers.
In the application, Mr,, Millar acknowlodged, in
response to a question on til® application form, that he had
been convicted of armed robbery»
The Commissioner, citing the applicable municipal
ordinance which prohibits the issuance of a cab driver*a
license to an applicant. Convicted of a crime involving 'the
us© of a deadly weapon, refused Mr» Mi,Her a licans©»
Thereafter, respondent Miller filed the instant
Section 1983 action# alleging violations of the Fifth# Eighth
and Fourteenth amendments, in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Illinois# seeking declaratory
and injunctive relief»

His complaint in the district court

was dismissed»
The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and
this Court granted Commissioner Carter's petition for a writ
of certiorari»
The Court of Appeals held that the ordinance results
in a denial of equal protection because it discriminated
irrationally among cl-asses of ex-offenders»

The Court declared

that an applicant for a license# who has committed on© of the
described felonies # and a 'licensee who lias done the same
are similarly situated? and no justification exists for
automatically disqualifying on® and not the other.
This is basically the issue that we dispute, that

5
has been found contrary to our position in the Court of Appeals,
Initially, I think it is appropriate to observe that
what we are dealing with her© is primarily an equal protection
case; it involvas the traditional equal protection test which
should b© appliad to an ordinance or any kind of statutory
legislation of this naturec
Thar© is no strict scrutiny test: to be applied in
this instance!»

Ha do not hava a suspect classification»

This Court has naver ruled that ©x-offenders fall into fee
category of suspect classification»

Nor is there a fundamental

right, in our opinion, involved in this case; in that again
the Court, while it has; ruled that the right to work is an
important right, it las never ruled that the right to ..work
is a fundamental right.
Furthermore, we believe it*s important also to strass
that what, we are dealing with her© is something that I think
both tin© court below and the respondent has basically agreed,
that the consideration of a criminal conviction is rationally
related to the goal attempting to be achieved by the City
Council; that is, primarily the protection of the taxicab
passenger.

And that this is a legitimate consideration.
The dispute revolvas around the issue whether or not

this ex**offender, who is disqualified by reason of being an
applicant, automatically, violates -the equal protection claus
when that sane type of individual is not automatically dis-

6
qualified if, in fact, h© is already a licensee0
We think that there arw primarily two factors which
differentiate the circumstances of applicants and licensees,
which justify the disparity and treatment of applicants and
licensees.
First, a current licensee has a carear at stake, a
property interest in his employment, which may not be terminated
except after a due process hearing.
QUESTION;

Mr. Quinism, ~

MR. QUINLAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, six"’

. — does that factor have anything to do

with the justification for 'the ordinance, namely, tee protection
of the passenger?
MR. QUINLAN:

No, I would not say so, Your Honor.

What we * re really saying in this instance is that that is a
legitimate classification,.because there is a rational reason
for the classification.

I did attempt to point out, as I

said earlier, that I do think that the ordinance itself is
rationally related to the goal of protecting the taxicab
passenger and providing for public safety. That, I think, the
court below agreed was a rationally related purpose.
QUESTION;

But that’s not quite the same as saying

that the discrimination or the classification :Ls rationally
related to the justification for the ordinance?
MR. QUINLAN:

I am not sura I’m following you.

7
QUESTIONS
say is s

It-, otiler words, what I understand you to

there is a res&on for a rule which protects the

passenger from a driver who may have bean guilty of an armed
robbery®

But that is not a reason for differentiating between

two drivers, both of whom were convicted of armed robbery, on©
of whom had a prior license, on© who did note
MRo QUINLAN's

That's correct»

And I'm submitting

there's another justification for that, in that they are a
different category f in tins sens® that they possess different
rights'? namely, that the individual who is already licensed
now has something at stale®, namely, his career, his employment»
The right to have that license can deprive him of his oppor­
tunity for employment.
I think this Court, in Bell vs» Burson, suggested
the same thing when it indicated that 'the denial of the license
there, on the basis cf the allegation that he may or may not
have been liable, merely because h© was in an automobile
accident and did not put up the appropriate insurance, would
also indicate that one© you have the license, your status
changes„
We are submitting that that is the situation her®,
that the status of the two individuals have, in fact — or the
two categories ar© different, anti have changed one© the license
has been issued.
So, to tax©: tha license, we must, employ additional

8
procedural steps, rather than In denying the license.
QUESTION; Are there any cases holding that you can
have different standards of eligibility for a position, for a
lawyer or doctor, something like that, depending on whether
you’re already in the profession or merely seeking to get in?
MR. QUINLANs

Well, I think the Board, of. Regents vs.

Roth and Perry_vb. Sindermann indicates that what you’re
talking about is 'die problem of a property right or soma sort
of liberty.
QUESTION:

That goes to the question of whether

you’re entitled to a hearing; but the question I'm asking is
as to the substantive rules that define eligibility for the
license or the profession, whatever.

Are there any cases

holding that the distinction that’s present in this ordinance
is a proper distinction?
That you have different rules for people who are
in tils business than far those who seek to get in.
MR. QUINLAN:

At the moment I cannot honestly

think of a specific case which sc holds.

I think, though, from

a reading of the other cases in the generic area, this can be
implied in determining what is the stake at interest hare to be
preserved.

And I think that quits clearly if you are in the

profession there is a greater stake at issue than if you are
not in the profession.
QUESTION? Wall, what good would a hearing do this man?

9

MR. QUINLAN:
QUESTIONS

What good would a hearing do this man?

Yes.

MR. QUINLAN;

Well,, i;: indicated that the court

below did not feel that any hearing whatsoever would b© of any
benefit to the individual.

However, a hearing is provided

both for a denial of a license for applicants as well as £
denial of a license of an existing licensee.
What could be determined on a hearing would be
whether or not ha was in fact the individual, for on© purposes
or whether in fact he was convicted of that crime.
Whether in fact, perhaps -that crime — that conviction
was reversed on appeal»
QUESTIONs

I thought he filled out. a blank and said

all of that.
MR. QUINLAN5

No, all he said was he was convicted

or armed robbery.
QUESTION;

Well, that's enough.

What good would a

hearing do him?
MR. QUINLAN;

Wall, as. I'm saying, it wouldn't

under the circumstances in this case, I think you're quit©
correct.
QUESTION;

I understand that you draw a line for

somebody that already has a license and somebody that doesn't
have, with one you give a hearing and the other you don't.
I don't see any difference.

If you give him a hearing, it

10
wouldn't do him any good.
MRo QUINLAN;

Wall, in this case, this particular

individual, I think you're absolutely correct, because he has
admitted the fact that he was convicted of armed robbery —
QUESTION;

That's what I'm talking about.

MR. QUINLANs

— does not challenge that, doss not

suggest that he was not: the individual, that it was reversed,
or anything of that nature*
What I was suggesting was that in a hypothetical
instance there would possibly be some purpose for going through
with a hearing.
QUESTION;

Mre Quinlan, let me ask y ju one other

question in terms of the . justification for the ordinance;
namely, the safety of the passenger.
Could not one: reasonably conclude that the driver
who has committed, more recently committed an offense poses a
greater threat to the safety of a passenger than one who
committed, an offense many years ago?

And that the existing

driver ~~ a conviction of an existing driver therefore poses
& greater threat to safety than one of an offender eight or
ten years ago.
MR. QUINLAN:
two sub issues to it.

Well, I think teat question really has
Tha first that I would address is teat

what you* re basically saying is teat perhaps in a situation of
licensed drivers, consideration of a conviction that occurred

11
more recently as opposed to one that occurred 30m© time ago
would be a pertinent consideration.

I would considar that

one in a classification first, namely, he is a licensed driver.
Th© second suggestion you're making is whether or
not there is the difference between a conviction at the present
time for a licensed driver and on© — from one who is not
licensed at all.

And, as I would indicate, I -think th©

standard is different in judging licensed drivers, the test is
much more strict? and, second of all, I think that would have
to ba a judgment that would have to be determined by th©
hearing officer in terms of deal:» ng with licensed taxicab
drivers.

And he would have to make the individual judgment.
Th© other judgment has been mad© by ih@ legislative

body „
QUESTIONS*

It safsmad to me that what — th© thought

that was running through ray mind is that conceivably, to the
extent that the distinction between the old offender and the
recent offender is relevant, th® recent offender is the more
dangerous of the two and therefos.'© he’s the one who should be
automatically excluded to protect th© passenger, rather than
th© other on©.
So, I wonder if your classification isn’t perverse
in terms off the reason for it.
HR. QUINLAN? Well, I would address that, by saying
that that primarily is a determination for the legislative

12
body in enacting a provision which provides qualification to
obtain a license.

They have mad© the legislative determina-*

tion that one who has been convicted of an offense involving
us© ©f a deadly weapon should not receive a taxicab license.
We would then submit that the test that has to be
applied to that is the traditional equal protection tests
Is -Shat rationally related to the goal, namely protecting the
taxicab passenger?

If that’s true, than it mats that test.

And *w© would submit that it does meet that test*
Now, the next step is going back to the same argu­
ment, we have provided greater rights for the cases of
licensees •

And it really doesn* t directly relate as to whether

it was more recant or less recent, the conviction, I would not
think, under those terms.
However, this would be & consideration at the time
of 'Ihe hearing, I’m sure, that if — and the circumstances
surrounding it.

But I don’t think it’s mandated, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

I would assume that if & man had been

sentenced for armed robbery and sentenced for twenty years and
served five, and had a license, you wouldn’t take it away from
him.

But if another armed robber was arrested, tried and

„

convicted, and the judge suspended the sentence raid said what
a great man he was; no go.

And nobody could change -that, but

the Legislature of Illinois.
HR. QUINLANs

That is correct, Your Honor.

13
And unless we gats into til© next argument, as to
whether or not w@ should ba dealing with the issue of whether
this violates du© process, which is th® second question, end
whether we should bs applying substantive du© process doctrine
•bo legislative enactments.

I think that’s always a possibility,,

but 'then, as -this Court has recognized, it's extremely fraught
with dangers*
QUESTION; Well, I’m not there y®tc

C haven't gotten

over the equal protection yet*
MR. QUINLAN:
approach.

Wall, I'm not sure I understood your

Th<a equal protection :1s — would be basically —•

based primarily on whether or non this was a legitimate
governmental interest? namely, tie protection of the safety
of the traveling public.
QUESTION:

Wa woul d submit that it is.

Well, I would assume that it would protect

1:h@ public if ovary licensed driver who had boon convicted
had a big thing up on his windshield, "I'm a convicted felon,
murderer”.

But the public doesn’t, know that.

There's nothing

*— there’s no way that I can see that you can justify saying
that a man who has not applied for a license until after he was
convicted is automatically dangerous,
You s<3© ray problem?
MR. QUINLAN:
QUESTION;
dangerous

As opposed to one who has a license?

Yes.

I might think they’re both

14
MRo QUINLANs

I think we in the legislative body

would concur with thatt
QUESTION 3

All I’m

Than stop both of them from driving0

MR0 QUINLAN;

Wellf we’re net suggesting that we do

not? we’r© suggesting that a different procedure is applied
to the individual who has a license on the basis that he has
marts ©£ a stake in that license after having received it?
his career is at stake* He does have a license, is earning a
living by use of that license. That is not. true of the
applicant, in that his interests at stake are less? therefore,
his due process rights are loss,
QUESTION; Wall, how many drivers are involved in
this, do you know?
MR, QUINLAN;

In this type of situation?

I personally

know of one other case which was not appealed,
QUESTION;

But you wouldn’t — there are no figures

on it available?
MR, QUINLAN:
QUESTION:
MR, QUINLAN;

No, there: is not, Your Honor,
I shouldn’t imagine that there ware;,
I would not, assume so,

I would assume

those who did have this conviction or this problem would not
apply, being aware of what the ordinance provided, being an
afos o 1 uts p rohi.h i ti on,
As' I indicated primarily we felt that the Bell vs,
Buxson case, where tf.-s Court had said e-ace & license is issued

15
there was continuing p«ss assion which may become essential
in 'the pursuit, of a livelihood indicates a basis for this
distinction»

It seams clear that the principle must apply

with even greater force*, to the taxicab driver, which is
inevitably related to the driver’s livelihood»
As I indicated before, the interests and rights of
the applicant ara very different than those of the individual
who has received his license»
Also, another factor that is relevant in taxms of
considering the difference between the two individuals is that
the incumbent licensees have a work record, which is an
indication of their fitness»

Applicants have no such record,

and the Commissioner would be compelled, in their cases, to
predict reliability or rehabilitation based upon whatever they
might be inclined iso pres ant»
We urn not submitting that, this is administrative
convenience, it is, rather, based on the City Council's
conclusion that it is impossible to make the type of evaluations
which a hearing on the -question ©f rahabilitati.on, in terms of
one who had been convicted previously, would require.
It is simply felt that such judgment would necessarily
be speculative: for the reason that the techniques for such
©valuations are not available.
The Court has recognized that the Legislature may
make classifications, if, in doing so, they do not violate the

16
nsqual protection clauses.
In Marshall %'s« Onltcd States, this Court upheld a
statute which conclusively denied a convict, Narcotics Act,
access to rehabilitative commitment if he had two or more
felonies.

There the Court has said:

"The Court has frequently

noted that legislative classifications need not be perfect or
ideal.

The line drawn by Congress at two felonies# for example,

might, with as much soundness, have been drawn instead .at one",
but the Court has cut them off exclusively there at two.
And this is a similar type of situation, a legislative judgment,,
They are drawing the line and cutting them off conclusively.
It is not something that is unique, it occurs in
many other instances.
We believe the procedures applied under the Chicago
ordinance do not result in a denial of equal protection or
due process. Respondent;* s contention that all th© applicants
should be given a hearing would perhaps result in some axoffender applicants gaining a license. But. again it is not
©very situation that, the legislative body must address itself
to.
We feel that the Dandrldge case indicated quite
clearly that a legislative body could take one step at a time
to deal with those particular types of problems that it felt
was necessary 'to deal with# end it did not have to deal with
each situation.

17
Furthermore.!, that while the ordinance does not
apply to other types of occupational licensing, this w© do not
feel is — or requires this to be held as violative of tine
equal protection clause. And ‘the basis for that is primarily
that again the legislative body lias chosen to select out this
area, and felt that this particular type of problem was more
dangerous to the traveling public,,
In a taxicab type of situation, the traveling public
is particularly and uniquely uninformed in selecting a cab.
They are also in a mobile and fluid 'typo of situation. There
is no supervision in that, type of situation.
And, accordingly, to select this out and not to us©
it in other types of instances, ray, in food purveyor3s licenses!
and things of that nature, is not an unreasonable distinction
for the legislative body to draw.

It is reasonable that they

would select, that type of procedure and that they would employ
this typ© of doctrine in that instance.
The respondents have suggested that this constitutes
an irrebutable presumption, and# accordingly, it is violative
of th© due process clause.
We would submit, that in trying to apply this typ© of
principle, namely, th® irrebutahle presumption, that it is &
typ© of situation that occurs in any- instance where & legisla­
tive body
tion.

draws a line and makes some sort of a classifica­

It can always be argued that the other sit5© of the coin

18

is an irrebutabl© presumption and, accordingly, violative of
due procsss.
W® would submit that tills is not an appropriate cas®
in which to apply the doctrine of due process, nor irrebutabl©
presumption involving du® process.

The reasons for this, we

would submit that in the cases in which irrebutabl© presumption
has been employed in most instances the twofold occurrences
have taken placa.

One is either that the particular fact was

never established in any type of a du© process procedure.

It

is merely an alleged fact.
Two, that the fact itself was not necessarily
related to the goal that was trying to be protected.
In this instance, we would submit that when we're
talking about a conviction, the best us© of the due process
procedure has been employed, namely, the trial system, before
a court of law.
has taken place.

The determination has been made, the conviction
There we are not talking about a fact that

may or may not be true or an allegation.
In the Schwara case, there was a situation where
there was several alleged facts, namely arrests; there was
the us© of aliases; end the membership in the Communist Party.
All three of these were sat forth as a basis for denying the
fitness of the applicant to receive a license to practice law.
In none of those instances, namely, in the case of
arrests, was there any determination that this was in fact the

-

19
casa.

The arrests were never processed any further, no

conviction was obtained, it was merely an allegation.

A

membership in the Communist Party had nothing to do with
whether or not tills applicant was fit to practice law, was not
rationally related.

The aliases were used for the purpose

because he was a Jewish member of society, who was active, in
Italian labor unions, «aid there was no indication that any
of these were rati.onf .lly relatedc
Finally, we would submit again that you*d have to
look at the stake or the interest that the party has in
receiving protection. And an individual who has not. received
a license docs not have the sera© degree of stake or interest
in -that particular license at that time.

And, accordingly,

those factors would indicate that, this is not an appropriate
instance in which to apply the due process doctrine of
