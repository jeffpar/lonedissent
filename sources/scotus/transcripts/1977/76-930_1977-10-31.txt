MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear arguments

next: in 76~93G, Ray against Atlantic Richfield»
Mr. Attorney General, I think you may proceed when
you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SLADE GORTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. GORTONj

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
The question before you is whether Washington's nondiscriminatory exercise of its police power to protect a unique
environment is preempted by the Ports and Waterways Safety Act
of 1972, or soma other federal doctrine.
In 1972, lihe Congress passed the PWSA.

The object

of that Act is tile safety of vessels and the protection of our
environment.

Title I addresses operational safety in ports,

waterways, and other congested waters.

It authorizes, but it

does not require, the Coast Guard to establish vessel traffic
systems and to mandate safety devices and standards for use in
connecti.on with those systems.
As the Solicitor General says, it’s like providing
for safer highways and for traffic controls for automobiles.
Title II directs the Coast Guard -- and in this case
it directs it — to set minimum design and construction standard
for tankers, and it is thus, in the Solicitor General's words,

4
like providing for safer automobiles ,
In the five years since 1972, the. Coast Guard has set
up, pursuant t.o Titia I, a skeletal vessel traffic system on
Puget Sound.

In the Coast Guard's own words, its major

components are, and I quote, "a traffic separation scheme and
a vessel-moving reporting system"f which of course applies
only to larger vessels»
When vessels get here, they have this system in the
direction of Seattle and Tacoma, which is off of the chart.,
belowj if they are going to ARCO's Cherry Point refinery, they
pass through all of these islands on this system, and hare, to
that Gharry Point refinery»

[indicating on chart]

The system also includes a limited radar which doss
not cover

Rosario Strait through the islands.

That's about

all —
QUESTION:

Well, you're not talking about radar on

the vessel?
MR» GORTON:

I'm talking about the Coast Guard's

radar, to see where the vessels all are.

That's about all.

It's a wild exaggeration to call this a comprehensive and allencompassing pattern of regulation.
Because of the urgent need for more stringent local
controls, caused by the unique nature of Puget Sound, the
1975 Washington State Legislature adopted this Chapter 125,
the law here under challenge.

That statute, based on a well-

5
founded fear of disaster comparable to that', of the TGRPEY CANYON,
limited the maximum risk from the most disastrous possible
oil spill by prohibiting tankers of more than 125,000 tons from
Puget Sound entirely»
The line drawn by the Legislature being roughly like
that (indicating on chart) <,
The Legislature sought to minimize the risks of any
oil spill in Puget Sound by requiring the tug escort for
tankers between 40 and 125 thousand tons, unless they are
designed in such a manner .as to render a tug escort unnecessary.
These requirements are based on the confined nature
of Puget Sound, the lack of maneuverability c£ large tankers,
and idle near impossibility of the clear*-up of a major ell
spill

in an area including 196 islands in San Juan Comit/ alone0
QUESTIONs

Mr* Attorney Genera.’., how did they lappen

to land on that 125,000 deadweight ton figure?
Did they pick it out of the air, or was there some*
reason for it?
MR. GORTON; There was considerabis discussion in the
legislative debate over the appropriate largest tanker which
could appropriately

which should be permitted to go through

tlie Sound. A 225,000-ton tanker, for example, probably couldn't
get through Rosario Straits at all, loaded, because it would
draw too much water»
But I believe that they simply debated over the

6
proposition that at a given size, a major spill, a spill which
lost all of the oil on board, would just — it would totally
ruin the entire area.

That the State woulc lack any reasonable

clean-tap facilities to take cars of such a spill*

They hoped

that between 40 and 125 thousand tons, ever with a major one,
the disaster would not be an irretrievable one»
QUESTION?

You're not arguing,’

then, that the

State might be able to exclude, say, tankers of 50,000 tors?
They landed on that figure --

MR* GORTON;

I think the question before you would h&

much different and much more difficult for me under those
circumstances, Your Honor.

Very few 125,000-ton tankers *ver

entered Puget Sound before this.
We are concerned with the fact -that ’there are, six
refineries on Puget Sound. They must be supplied, they must
be supplied with more by tanker now, because of the fact that
the Canadians have cut off the pipeline to Cherry Point.

The

two years that we've enforced this law, all of those refineries
on Puget Sound have in fact bean supplied by tankers of Ie-ss
than 125,000 tons, -to the full extent of their needs.
QUESTION: Are all the refineries up there in tar­
cher ry Point area?
MR. GORTON: Two refineries are here (indicating on
chart) , two refineries are here, and two refineries are i:i
Tacoma, which, is off the chart to the south.

7
QUESTION;

How many of those refineries can hsx.c'il©

12 5 ,0 0 0-ton ships ?
MR, GORTON:

One,

ARCO's.

Now, there's another point.

Even the Solicitor

General fails clearly in his brief to distinguish betweer Pugst.
Sound and all of the other waters and coastlines of -the State
of Washington , to which this law does not. apply, because the
Legislature was making a careful value judgment, leaving open
to the larger tankers, should there be a major tanker port in
the future, the Strait of Juan De Puca and the Pacific Ocean
coastline of the State,
In the more than two years since the passage of 125,
as I said, tress six refineries have gotten all the petroleum
products the* needed, operating totally consistently with the
State law, which has been in force ell that; time,
QUESTION:

Is there a legislative definition oi an

accepted definition of the line between the: Strai-; of Juan Da
Fuca and Puget Sound?
MRo GORTON: The Legislature defines the line, which
I’ve drawn here, from a particular light he another particular
light.
Nov, in .13 72, right after the PWSA, the Congress also
passed the Crystal '2on;

Management Act, which authorizes

Coastal States to define, and I'm quoting from that Act,
"permissible land and water uses within the; Coastal Zona."

8

Transportation and navigation, arc among the
expressly recognized by the C?MA as proper sab jacts of the
State management program»
Upon approval by the Secretary of Commerce, the State
plan becomes national policy, and other federal agencies: are
required to conduct, their activities in a manner consistent
with idle State plan.

The Washington State plan explicitly

includes Chapter 125 as a ''means by which the State proposes
to exert control” over oil transportation»
In June of last year the plan was expressly approved
by the Secretary of Commerce»
Finally, earlier this month — this month, since all
briefs except our reply brief was filed *— Congress approved
S„ 1522, which bars any increase in crude oil handling capacity
at any faciliiy in the Stats east of Port Angeles»
That’s right hers (indicating on chart),,

Except

for local consumption»
ARCO’s proposal to utilize a pipeline to the Midwest
for Alaskan oil has thus been effectively prohibited»
S, 1522, like Chapter 125, treats Puget Sound as unique, and
recognizes the threat of pollution posed by tanker traffic
in the Sound»
Now, the State’s law will be avoided, of course, if
Congress has expressly preempted it, or if it conflicts with
some federal statute»

The beginning point of your inquiry into

9
that; question is explained in Jones v, Rath._ Packing» in the
following words?

We start with the assumption that the

historic police powers of the State are not. to be superseded
by the federal Act, unless that was 'the clear and manifest
purpose of Congress„

But when Congress has unmistakably

ordained that its enactments alone

are to regulate a pert of

commerce, State laws regulating that aspect of commerce must
fall.
We start with the obvious proposition that the
Congress did not expressly preempt all forms of State control
over tanker* operation by the passage of the Ports and Waterways
Safety Act.

The only reference in the PWSA arguably indicating

an intention by Congress to preempt State authority is found
is Section 102(b), which contains no express preemption at all,
but only a negative inference, and I quote that section?
"Nothing contained in Title I prevents & State from
prescribing for structures only higher safety equipment require­
ments or safety standards than those which may be prescribed
pursuant to this Act."
ARCO claims that the plain meaning of that language
preempts any Stulti rule affecting tanker operations, ipso facto.
Not so.
Let's examine the inevitable result of the ARCO ■--*
of ARCO* s argument e
First, it would destroy a State managed vessel traffic

10

system even though the Coast Guard never set up its own system
in replacement:»
But Section 102(e) of the Act requires the Coast
Guard to consider existing systems in determining the need for,
or the substance of, the Coast Guard's own regulation, from
which it’s obvious that local systems are valid, at least until
the Coast Guard supersedes them.
Next, ARCO's assertion flies in vhe face of the plain
language of Section 102(b) itself, which limits the State only
to the extent that standards or equipment have been prescribed,
in the words of Section 102(b), by the Coast Guard.
The Coast Guard has not adopted general access
limitations or tug escort provisions on Puget Sound.
QUESTION: Then why did Congress say "vessels only"
in that language — or "structures only."
MR. GORTONs Why did it say "structures only"?

From

the legislative history of that Act, it was speaking of equip­
ment; and standards which go on vessels, their radar system,
their crew-manning requirements, vessel equipment arid safety
standards; these are what go on the vessel.
The paragraphs in the congressional, in the Report
on it, indicate that that kind of limitation.
QUESTION: So it meant that the State could not. pre­
empt -- could not act in that area?
MR. GORTON:

In that area, yes.

We can't say what

11
brand of radar or radio -the vessels carry»
Moreover, as the Solicitor General says, the legis­
lative history of Secti.cn 102(b) shows that it deals only
with these safety equipment standards and not with external,
such as tug escorts, or access limitations»
Finally, ARCO's position, if we look at that section
very carefully, would not allow the State even to enforce its
shoreline zoning requirements as to loading docks, for example,
on

strictly environmental grounds, because such regulations

would not. be the safety requirements to which ARCO believes
the savings clause in Section 102(b)

is vary strictly limited»

The true meaning of Section 102(b) is clear. When
the Coast Guard establishes a vessel traffic system on a
waterway, a State may not establish a conflicting system or
require the use of different radio frequencies, for example»
When the Coast Guard prescribes a given type of radar, the
State may not prescribe a different type.

Thus we, on -this

subject, are in accord with both the district court and the
Solicitor General»

The PWSA does not expressly preempt

Chapter 125»
But in your preemption analysis in Jones vs» Rath
.lacking, you go into a further test, and I'll quote that,
"Our task i.s to determine whether, under the circumstances of
this particular case, the State's law stands as an obstacle
to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and

12
objectives of Congress0

This inquiry requires us to consider

the relationship between State and federal laws as they are
interpreted and applied, not merely as they are written»"
The purposes of the Ports and Waterways
as they are stated in Section 101 ares

Safety Act,

safety and the protec­

tion of -- the prevention of environmental harm resulting from
vessel damage or destruction»
The purposes of the State Act are identical»

Not

only does it not frustrate the purposes of Congress, it
facilitates and enhances them»

The means which the State Act,

uses to achieve those purposes are also consistent with the
PWSAo

There is no conflict or friction between the Coast

Guard vessel traffic system, as it operates in practice on
Puget Sound, and the State requirements as they are actually
carried out»
For more than two years those systems have worked in
total harmony„

In fact, the Commandant of the Coast Guard

recently testified to Congress, pointing out that State tug
escort requirements are but one example of appropriate
complementary State regulatione
I should like you to note that the State’s claim here
is an extremely modest one»

We recognize that Congress can

preempt Chapter 125 whenever :.t wishes to do so„

We assert

only that it has not done so /e:»
We acknowledge that tire Coast Guard, by adopting a

13

valid regulation conflicting with the State statute car*,
supersede either or both of the operative requirements of
Chapter 125 »
QUESTION:

Which are what?

Which are you talking

about?
MR® GORTON:

Which would be the access limit and the

tug escort requirement»
QUESTION: And you are suggesting that until it does3
your

banning the larger tankers is valid?
MR» GORTON:

Is perfectly -— well* when the Coast

Guard passes a regulation which conflicts with that ban* then
we're out» We understand that»

W© don't even —

QUESTION; What about a licensed United States-flag
tanker?
MR® GORTON:

Under the general enrollment Act®

We do not feel that a license

or a registration, either to a

U»S0-flag or a foreign-flag tanker* is in any way conflicting.
Going all the way back to Gibbons vs» Ogden and all the way
forward to your latest case in this connection —
QUESTION;

So you think the United States is just

wrong with respect to license of a United States-flag ship?
MR® GORTON;

Your cases have consistently held that

even a license to a U0S»-flag vessel does not prevent the State
from enforcing an even-handed conservation or environmental
regulation®

Even-handed®

That is to say, applicable to every

14
cue »
We're only claiming, even her©, that, the incomplete
snd fragmentary Coast Guard rules and traffic system on Puget
Sound has not yet superseded our State rules»
AROO goes on, of course, to argue preemption, beyond
Section 102 on more general and less precise grounds;

the

need for uniform national standards? the nature of the subject
matter? the dominance of the federal interest»
In this field, ARCO elevates its preemption argument
to the Constitution, independently of the PWSA, claiming that
the field of Chapter 125 is one which the State constitutionally
cannot regulate, even if Congress has not occupied it»
Note well how broad and expansive •this claim is»
If it's accepted, the State could not protect its environment,
as Washington has, even if Congress had not. acted at all, or
parhaps even if Congress had expressly attempted to delegate
that authority to the States»

The very pilotage laws of 1789,

which were approved in Cooley v, Board of Wardens, would be
unconstitutional under that argument»

As they dealt, with

vessel operations exactly as our tug escort requirements do,
which ARCO claims require uniform national standards«
In this argument, ARCO equates the design and
construction of oil tankers with their movement in local waters»
But whatever one may say about design and construction, local
movement is inherently and inevitably a local concern»

For

15
almost, two centurias,, this Court has allowed the enforcement of
local regulations on matters of local concern, as long as they
don't positively conflict with federal law0
As Gilmore and Black have put it, the States have
enacted, and I quota, "massive legislation dealing with
shipping matters"c

Such legislation which has been approved

by this Court includes quarantine regulations, docking, local
speed controls, vessel inspection, and conservation legislation
designed to protect the environment
Title I of the Ports and Waterways

Safety Act itself

recognizes the existence and validity of such legislation, and
is careful to speak of possible preemption only on -she basis
of idle actual effect of Coast Guard regulations„
Finally, the Coastal Zone Management Act invites
State: plens which deal with navigation matters and allows the
Secretary of Transportation to transmute them into federal
policyo

No resort to a demand for so-called uniformity,

standing in the air, can withstand this specific congressional
recognition of local concerno
The test o£ preemption as it applies to regulations
such, as Washington's is not a vague appeal to the need for
national uniformity, but actual conflicto
•Now, to the extent that this case is governed by the
Ports and Waterways Safety Act, tills entire controversy
revolves around Title I of -that Act and not Title II „

It is

16

in treating the access limitation as a design, control that
both ARCO and the Solicitor General err.
Conceptually,, design precedes even construction in
‘the life of a tanker® Washington State does not require any
design features®
Were the Coast Guard to establish an access limita­
tion based on size in Puget Sound, like or conflicting with our
own, for safety or environmental reasons, it would act under
Title I of tiie PWSA, not the design standards of Title II„
This misconception, together with on® other, leads the
Solicitor General to view the State's access limitation less
favorably than he does the tug escort requirement®
That second misconception is that, the proposition
that large tankers cause a greater risk of oil spills than
smaller ones is unreasonable, thus causing our access limita­
tion to fall®
Mow, the parties stipulated — ‘this case was tried
on a stipulation — to the existence of expert support for
the proposition that large tankers were lass safe, disputed
though it may ha, and its reasonableness was never in issue
between the parties®
But, as I*ve already said, it bears emphasis, the
Legislature had an additional rationale which is not fa van
subject to dispute;

supertankers clearly cause a risk of

greater spills, and the State wishes to place a reasonable

17
calling on. the most serious oil spill disaster to which Puget
Sound may be subjected*,

That is a rational concern, and

justifies the State's regulation, unless and until it conflicts
with another established or authorised by Congress „
Your line of cases, to which . Hr» Justice Bl&ckmun
adverted in his question, or. the enrollment and registration
statures clearly permit an even-handed State regulation for
environmental purposes, way back -to the cases first coming
after Gibbons vs. Ogden, Manchester* vs, Massachusetts is one
of thoseo
Interestingly enough, your most recant case in the
field of preemption deals with exactly that question*

And

Mr, Justice Marshall, speaking for the Court, wrote in Douglas
vs, Seacoast Producta, less than six months ago;

"States

may impose even upon federal licensees reasonable, nen­
dis criminatory conservation and environmental protection
measures otherwise within their police power,"
That is all we have dons in the State of Washington,
and we should not only be tolerated in that, attempt to protect
our environment, we should foe encouraged,
QUESTION;

You concade that the pilotage requirement

is invalid as to certain types of ships?
MR, GORTON s
federal lav;.

Yes 0

It is because it conflicts with

And -chat has not been an issue in this case.

I'll reserve, if I may, the balance —

18
QUESTION;

Has? the Coast Guard put',, some size

limitations for soma areas in Puget Sound?
MR*, GORTON;

No, Mr» Jus ties White, the Coast Guard

has not addressed ‘this subject,» The Coast Guard, first, has
delegated of course to each of its commanders the reasons they
— the ability to write rules»

Under those rules, of course,

the Puget Sound VTS is created»
There is one -**
QUESTION; Well, what about the -- is there some
local rule then about -MR» GORTON; ARCO claims that the Coast Guard has
entered this field because of a local rule ~—
QUESTION;
MR» GORTON;

Yes.
—• in this case a local rule which

says that the vessels, the VTC will coordinate vessel movements
to avoid hazardous meetings or crossing situations.

Masters

and pilots are encouraged — and this is all they say — to
adjust the speed of 'their vessels so as to limit movement, of
larga vessels through Rosario Strait to one direction at a
time o
QUESTION;
MR» GORTON;

Well, was there —
It is found in the pretrial order, it is

agreed that there is an informal, that isn't even written,
Coast Guard rule that two 70,000-ton tankers won't pass one
another going in either direction in Puget Sound •— in Rosario

S-trait
But, that, of course, is not remotely inconsistent
with our greater concern» And that* of course* applies not
only to tankers but to every other kind of shipping»
I will reserve the balance of my time* if I may*
Your Honor»
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well* Mr. Attorney

General»
Mr» She wood.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD E. SHERWOOD* ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. SHERWOOD:

Mr. Chief Justice* may it please the

Court:
I

In Florida Lime and Avocado Growers v. Paul * Mr.
Justice Brennan, stated for the Court that the maturity of
avocados seems to be an inherently unlikely candidate for
exclusive federal regulation.
By contrast* we would submit -that the subject matter
in this case* regulation of the construction* design and
navigation of seagoing oil tankers * the lifeline of this
country’s energy fuel economy, bringing oil dui they do from
abroad and now from Alaska* is an obvious candidate for
exclusive regulation by the federal government; and one which*
under the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972* as well as
other legislation* has been preempted to the exclusion of State

2a

regulations# such as the Washington tanker law.
In striking the delicate balance between energy needs
and environmental protection# a balance which involves the
foreign relations of the United States# 50 percent of our oil
comes from abroad# 95 percent of tankers are foreign registry#
a. balance also which involves the competing interest of the
coastal and the inland States# only 'the federal government
has the sensitivity and the tools»
If Mr„ Gorton is .right,, and the tanker law is just a
simpla exercise of the police power — and I would note in that
connection the view in Southern Pacific v0 Arizona that one
cannot always hide behind the convenient apologetics of the
police power — then other States can adopt different size
limits# different design requirements# different tugboat
penalties»
Alaska has already don© so# encouraging large tankers#
mandating different design characteristics# and 15 States#
amicus curiae# are waiting eagerly in the wings»
In this context# I hum to the specific features of
the Washington tanker law# each of which is preempted by
federal law and by Coast Guard action pursuant to federal law.
First# the size limitations»

We believe -that it is

clear from the Ports and Waterways Safety Act that a size limit
is bad# both as a traffic regulation under Title I of the
Ports and Waterways Safety Act and as a design requirement under

21

Title Ilo
101(3) of Title I gives -'she Coast Guard the power to
set size and speed limits0
In toe Senate Report leading up to the Act , at pages
32 and 33, there is a specific statement rejecting toe idea of
general six:© limitations on tankers, and a statement of
preference for specificity for flexible regulation by the
Coast Guard„
The Coast, Guard has established a vessel traffic
system for Puget Sound, and, despite Mr» Gorton’s view, I
would suggest that pages 141 through 198 of the Appendix,
which spall out that vessel traffic system, indicate its
comprehensiveness, including specific reporting requirements
in Rosario Strait
QUESTION:

Mr» Sherwood, would you still say that

there was prramption or that there was a conflict if the
Coast Guard had not announced this traffic control plan for
Puget Sound?
MR. SHERWOOD: As ti the size limit, I would certainly
think so, because the Coast Ruard, as well as the Maritime
Aclminis tratip ,, —
QUISTION:

You w:uld just say fch© existence of the

power to cow :rol the size wars enough?
Jflo SHERWOOD:
(UESTION:

Now,

Yes, I would, Your Honorc
i r what: case would that be enough?

22
MRo SHERWOODs Well, our view would be that under
both, oases such as Lockheed or Northern States —QUESTION:

You think just the — you just have to

spell out some intention from the comprehensiveness of the
federal law that they didn't intend State interference?
MR» SHERWOODs

Yes»

That where you have, a statute

which comprehensively regulates the field, and delegates the
power to balance factors, the assignment of the right to set
a size limit, we believe, must be related to an exclusion on
the part of any State of the power to set a size limito
Otherwise -—
QUESTION;

You'd have a tougher case without the

local traffic plan?
MR» SHERWOOD:

I think wss d have a different case.

I suspect it would be tougher.

But the local traffic plan

contemplates also that there be limits on the size of vessels
going in bo til directions in Rosario Strait, and the Coast Guard
retains both the power to ban vessels from Puget Sound or from
any other waterway of the United States when there is a
determination that such a ban is appropriate.
So, in our view, the size limit is precluded both by
Title I, giving tha Coast Guard the power to sat size limits,
and by Title II, giving the Coast Guard the power to set design
requirements.

Because the Coast Guard, in mandating design

requirements, has not drawn any limit on the size of the vessel.

23
The Maritime Administration, in administering the
subsidy program, has not drawn any size limitation on the size
of vessels which will be functioning in the commerce of the
United States, and there has been no effort to restrict either
the building of vessels in U0S0 shipyards or the building of
vessels in other countries, in terms of their ability to com®
into the United States»
QUESTION %

Yet there are soma ports in the United

States that a 150,000-ton tanker just can't get into, even
though a State were -bo prohibit them, aren't there?
MR» SHERWOOD;

Oh, indeed, Justice Relinquish»

There

are very few ports where a tanker larger than 125,000 deadweight,
tons can presently go.

The three logical port areas ar© all

in the western United States, and the State of Washington, by
its legislation, would cut off on© of those.
QUESTION; Well, when you talk about the failure of
the Maritime Administration -to limit the deadweight of ships,
that doesn't necessarily nean that they contemplated that the
largest ship that they would permit, would necessarily get in
to any port, in the United 0tatas?
MR. SHERWOOD;

Nc, I think they were thinking in

terms of two possibilities;

one, existing ports; and th© other,

the construction of new port,s, which may take place at some
time in the future, includir.g deepwater ports; none of which
has yet been built

24
But certainly the commitment of hundreds of millions
of dollars in money, without the establishment of a size
limitation, is evidence that if there is to be a size limita­
tion, it ought to ba federally imposed,,
QUESTION;

As I understand, your argument is that

you can. build a tanker any size you want and the State is
powerless to keep it out?
MR. SHERWOOD;

As of today0
Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall.

The State

is powerless to keep it: out, and th© Stata —
QUESTION;

Even though it will wreak havoc —

even though there’s no question that the bottom will be
ripped out.
MR. SHERWOOD;

Well, I think there is no evidence

that the bottoms of any of these vessels will or have been
ripped out.
QUESTION: This is my hypothetical.
MR. SHERWOOD: Well, in tliat circumstance, the Coast
Guard has an affirmative obligation to prevent -die vessel from
entering Puget Sound or any other port.
QUESTION;

And if the Coast Guard does not act, the

State is powerless?
MR. SHERWOOD;

It would be my position that it would

be the obligation than of the Stats —»
QUESTION: Could the State pass a law and say: We
will not allow any tankers in Puget Sound in which there is a

record of them having a bottom ripped out. some place else?
MRc SHERWOOD:

Mo, I would think again that would be

beyond 'the power of 'the State, because the scheme of regula-tion

QUESTION:

So the State just lets them come in and

rip the bottoms out»
MRo SHERWOOD:

No, I don’t think the State needs 1st

any vessel come in its waters, because the State has the right
both to go to the federal authorities as well as to seek the
kind of political redress which was sought in the case of 'the
Marine Mammal Protection Act at the federal level»
QUESTION:

And until that’s dona, the State cannot

act»
MR» SHERWOOD;

That would be our position, yes, sir,

VI® believe that the area of regulation is one which

requires that if there be size limits to be set, then the
Coast Guard in consultation, as it is mandated to consult
with -the States and with local authorities, is the only proper
organ to make those determinations; because otherwise you would
have each State setting foreign policy, each State making
determinations -- ai.d, parenthetically, there is nothing
whatever in the record which would support the conclusion of
Mr„ Gorton that there is a safety differential in a vessel
larger than 125,000 deadweight tons»
QUESTION:

And in this case they did» The Coast Guard

26

end tile State did get together on Rosario.
MRo SHERWOOD:
QUESTION:

No, 'the State had no role in Rosario»

None at all?

MR„ SHERWOOD:

No»

Indeed, to the best of ray

knowledge, there was no pre-existing vessel traffic system
imposed by the State of Washington,,

That the fix’st such system

came into effect when the Coast Guard, acting under the Ports
and Waterways Safety Act, adopted that system, and the Washington
State legislation was two or three years later.
QUESTION:

I see.

QUESTION: Do you say that under the federal Act the
Coast Guard could set deadweight limits on tankers?
MRo SHERWOOD:

Oh, it clearly could, Mr. Justice

Rahnquist.
QUESTION: And would it have tc set the same limits
for s/ery port in the United States, or could it vary from
Commandant from Commandant?
MR. SHERWOOD; Well, it's my understanding that rules
could be laid down which would be flexible depending on
particular ports, and Indeed, the section from the Senate
legislative report that I read to you contemplates that there
be no across-the-board size limitation, that it b© imposed
specific area by specific area, or depending upon other
conditions, weather, f:r example, such as the limitations now
in Rosario.

QUESTION :

So you would have a great, deal of

diversity of regulation under the federal system, as you
understand it?

MRo SHERWOOD:

Yes„

It's my understanding that the

federal system contemplates that there be diversity of regula­
tion, but that it be diversity of federal regulation*
QUESTIONS Well, at: the present time, I suppose the
regulations for vessels docking at Alexandria are quite differ­
ent from those in New York or New Orleans or Mobile,
MR, SHERWOOD:
QUESTION:

Under federal regulations.

MR, SHERWOOD:
QUESTION:

Oh, I‘m certain that they are,

Yes,

I understood Attorney General Gorton's

argument to be simply that, from the state's point of view,
a disaster or a spill from a. 150 ,000-ton tanker is a much
greater disaster than & 50,000; and you don’t need any
evidence for that, do you?
MR, SHERWOOD: Well, I would suggest that you would
need some evidence, because it’s a question of whether the
entire vessel was destroyed.

The bulk of spills that have

taken place have involved far less than tee entirety of the
vessel’s oil. And, indeed, one has a pattern of dockside
spills or very small spills, which is the norm, and tee bulk
of the) vessels, I would suggest, are of varying sizes but there
are relatively few catastrophes in which the entire vessel was

28

des troyed <,
QUESTION; But until the Coast Guard put in new
regulations and limitations about bulkheads, the contrary was
true, was it not, that the larger tankers spilled a great deal
more oil than the smaller ones?
MR® SHERWOOD; Wall,, I don't believe so, Chief
Justice Burger,

It is my impression that one must go well

outside the record on. this, .but the Office of Technology
Assessment of the federal government has issued a report on
the subject, and it’s my impression that there is no evidence
that large tankers create a danger of greater spills than does
a proliferation of smaller vessels, particularly in a confined
waterway »
QUESTION; Well, are you addressing that to the
present state of affairs, or the earliest spills, four or five
years ago?
MR, SHERWOOD;

I believe both,

I believe both.

The TORREY CANYON, for example, was a human error
in broad daylight, and it's not something, I think, that would
have been prevented by any form of design requirement which
could have beenbimposod upon the vessel,

No, I would not.

My view on that

would be that while it might, require a longer time to stop,
because of the siso of the vessel, ~~
QUESTION:

And to turn around.

MR. SHERWOOD:

— but it would depend on the

characteristics of the particular vessel as to whether you had
danger of lack of maneuverability, and, indeed, the Coast Guard,
in imposing vessel equipment requirements, has not attempted to
differentiate between vessels larger than 125,000 deadweight
tons.

The basic rules that have been adopted under Title II

of -die Ports and Waterways Safety Act have desalt with vessels
larger than 20,000 deadweight tons or larger than, in some
instances, 1500 deadweight tons.
Moreover, neither Rosario Strait nor Puget Sound is
a finding of a shallow place.

QUESTION:

I knew, but if there’s any argument about

it., the Coast, Guard could make it unmistakably clear, couldn't
it?

MR0 SHERWOODs

I just don’t think, Mr» Justice White,

that the Coast Guard is going to function in a fashion in which
it is making d@terminati.ons that it is barring a particular
law,

I think, rather, that the way in which it has acted under

the Porte and Waterways Safety Act has been to adopt affirma­
tive requirements»
For example, there are four design features in the
Washington tanker law, -which Mr, Gorton did not advert to,
requiring that there be double bottoms, twin screws, extra
propulsive mechanisms, and twin radars0

that if it were decided that; the law in its present form#
including the Coast Guard regulations# do not preempt or do
not foreclose or preclude this system of regulation by the
State of Washington# that the State — the Coast Guard# if it
wanted to# could do something about it.„

34
MRo SHERWOOD:

Yes., but: tlia question is; What must

the Coast Guard do?
Take# for example# tugboats,,

The Coast Guard has

issued a notice of intended rule-making for the general require­
ment of minimum standards for tugboats.

It has given the

captain of the port the. responsibility to require tugboats#
whenever it wishes# under both Title I and Title II# it has
actually imposed the requirement in the margins not left open
for it by the Washington authorities.

In Alaska it has

imposed a narrower requirement than the State requirement in
Alaska waters# and that is presently being contested on the
same basis; that if the federal authorities do not exercise
the full scope of their power under the Ports and Waterways
Safety Act# it creates an intolerable situation for both
vessel design and vessel movement if each State is in a
position to adopt its own regulations on the point,
QUESTION;

That’s almost a constitutional argument

there# though# isn't it?

Because you have a grant of authority

by Congress to federal administrative authorities# like the
Coast Guard,

They choose to not axercise it.

And then you say

it just creates an intolerable burden because they have used
their discretion given them by Congress not to do something,
MR, SHERWOOD;

Well# I would suggest# Justice

Rehnquist# that you would otherwise create a situation in which
each time the Coast Guard consider.*

and rejects something# twin

35

screws for example,, that: & State would then be in a position
where it could add on the requirement, so long as it was
something that the Coast Guard had not said was prohibited for
States to dOo
QUESTIONS

Well, then* you

that would be a

stronger case# though, if the Coast Guard had considered it and
rejected it, to have the Stats then go ahead and add it. on,
wouldn't it?
MR0 SHERWOOD: Well, the Coast Guard has hare
considered and rejected each of th© design features of the
Washington law„
QUESTION: But, as I understand the design features,
that requirement can be completely avoided by taking a tugboats
MRo SHERWOOD:

It can at this time in Washington,

with th© imposition of a penalty, in the magnitude of sera©
hundreds of thousmids of dollars per year,,
QUESTION;

But, you mean if the vessel employs a

tugboat it has to pay a penalty, too?
MRo SHERWOOD;

Well, there is good-faith dispute

as to the efficacy of tugboats in doing anything, because they
are not attached to the vessslo

They trail along behind it„

They axe different from the federal requirement, and thus,
our view is that that is e penalty, as the Solicitor General
very candidly stated in discussing th© subject,,
And if Washington can do it here, each other coastal

36

jurisdiction can impose its own variant.. It can impose its
own design requirements.

It can impose its own alternatives

as to how you get around the design requirements.

And you

have,, again, a situation in which the purpose of the federal
statute and the Tank Vessel Act before the Ports and Waterways
Safety Act# to promote uniform and comprehensive regulation,
is completely undermined.
QUESTIONS

But you did figure if ~

QUESTION %

Mr, — go ahead.

QUESTION?

if the Coast Guard is charged with

administering this Act# and it thought that purpose were
being undermined,as Justice White has suggested, it could
prohibit it tomorrow? and it hasn't,
MR. SHERWOOD:

Well, the Coast Guard, we submit, has

acted in the only legible way that it can in dealing with the
alternative regulations.

It has mad© known its position of

protest both in Washington and in Alaska,

It; has gone about

the regulation of tee size and the design and the movement of
vessels, and has done so in a fashion which is inconsistent
with competing State regulations, even if the States are
seeking to help out,
QUESTIONa Well, what if — if this Court suggested
that whatever it has done isn't enough, I suppose the Coast
Guard would then knew that it isn't enough..

And would you say

that the Coast Guard had the power under any of these statutes

MRo SHERWOODs Welly actually, there are a number of
inland States -that have taken a position in both directions
in this case, including those that are on the Great Lakes and
those that are on rivers, as to their right, to regulate —
and obviously it ’wouldn't be 50, Mr* Chief Justice„
QUESTION s

I take it your point that if ***» let us

assume there are 20 different ports that -take tankers of

MRc SHERWOODs

Precisely»

And our view also would be

that the Coast Guard can preempt under thy Ports and Waterways
Safety Act only if the Ports and Waterways Safety Act itself
is regarded as preemptive»

That is, it's very difficult, as a

logical proposition, to understand how, if 'the statute doesn't
do any preempting, it can be read as giving an abstract power
of pre@mptd.on»

Guard has dona, in vhat we would submit is the only logical way,

MR. SHERWOODs

Yes# and the only historic exception#

aside from the limited regulation of docksides# is that pilotage

QUESTION;

Well, I was speaking more generally*

States generally, with the federal government, rather than
just Washington*
MR* SHERWOODs

Oh, indeed, Mr. Chief Justice Burger*

The statute contemplates that there be consultation, and each
time th© Coast Guard adepts a regulation, either under Title
I or Title II, there is an opportunity, indeed mandated, for
comment by State and local authorities? and there's been a wide
pattern of comment by State end local authorities*
I would suggest, however, that the record is
absolutely blank as to the State of Washington ever asking
that the design requirements or the size limitations be

[Whereupon, at 12;00 noon, the Court recessed to 1:00 p.m.]

41

AFTERNOON SESSION
[1:02 p.ra.3
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Sherwood, Justice

Blackmun has a question for you before we proceed with the
Attorney Generale
QUESTION:

I wanted to ask, Mr. Sherwood, whether

am I correct, is it agreed that the district court is to be
reversed with respect to the presumption ruling concerning
registered vessels?

As distinguished from enrolled vessels„

MR. SHERWOODs Well, it's our understanding, Mr.
Justice Blackmun, 'that if the Court affirms line striking down
of the entire pilotage provision, that there was a pre-existing
provision of Washington law which did require pilots, State
pilots on all vessels which were registered, and thus, if the
Court struck down that provision in its entirety from the
tanker law, there would be, in place, a Washington requirement
of pilots on tee vessels teat come from abroad.
And therefore I think it becomes a matter essentially
irrelevant as to which way the Court goes on teat point.
Because if it struck down the entire pilotage pre­
vision, there's tea pre-existing Washington lav;; if it struck
down only that portion pertaining to enrolled vessels, that
also would be. an appropriate disposition.
QUESTION: And secondly, and this is perhaps of no
relevance, do any or all of .ARCO's " tankers carry foreign

42
flags?
HR» SHERWOOD:
QUESTION:

Yes„

Is that; in the record?

MR„ SHERWOOD:

Yes 0

QUESTION: All of them?
MRe SHERWOOD:

No0

No - the majority of the vessels

owned by the company, from the record,, are U„S.-flag, but the*
bulk of the vessels that have brought foreign crude into Puget
Sound for Atlantic Richfield were foreign™flag.

That is, the

15 vessels that were larger than 125,000 deadweight tons were
all vessels not owned by Atlantic Richfield, but rather were
chartered by it and were foreign™flag vessels.
And I think you can see from tha record, Hr. Justice
Blackmun, the list of all of the vessels -that have come in,
and they run a patchwork of foreign™flag and U.S.-flag, soma
of them owned by the company, soma not.
QUESTION:

May I vssume they possess federal

licenses from the U.S.?
MR. SHERWOOD:

Yes. All of the Atlantic Richfield

vessels have tha relevant fed-aval licenses and permits under
the Tank Vessel Act and Certification under the other federal
statutes, and, similarly, nil tie vessels that are foreign-flag
have the appropriate arrangements for reciprocal treatment
under our laws.
QUESTION: That's all I ha'?©.

Mr* Sherwood# may I ask you one question

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SLADE GORTON# ESQ*#
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR* GORTON?

In its Report which accompanied the

passage of the Port's and Waterways Safety Act# the Senate
stated# and I quotes

"In terms of maneuverability th© propulsion

44
units on 250,000-ton tankers are the equivalent to a one-third
horsepower motor on a 40~foc't boat,”
This is something of which the Legislature of the
State of Washington was conscious when it passed tills law.
The depth of Rosario Strait, or the controlling depth of
Rosario Strait is 60 feet, and a 120,000-ton tanker has a
craft of 52 feat loaded.

By the time we get to 190,000 dead­

weight tons, it becomes 61 feet.
The State Legislature wished at least that small
margin of safety,
And finally, the smaller —
QUESTION j

Is your emphasis there also on the

maneuverability of such a large craft?
MR, GORTON:

Of course it is.

And that is from the

Senate Report, They are obviously less maneuverable than the
smaller craft.
It takas, for example, even at the 120,000-ton size,
two and one-half miles to stop a tanker at 16 knots. By the
time the tanker is 190,000-ton, it takes three and a half
miles to stop,
QUESTION;

Do those tankers ever go 16 knots in

that area?
MR, GORTON;

I doubt it.

They can't, among other

things, Mr, Chief Justice, because they are required to have
tug escorts, and the tug escorts could not keep up with -them

45

at 16 knots o

That is, effectively we slow them down by the tug

escort requirement0
QUESTION: Well, of course, on those figuras as &
limit, in a strong wind on Rosario Strait a canoe is smaller
than, a 20,000 deadweight ton

essel and yet

it will be a lot

Yes, it would b©»
I've been in them.
That is correct, Your Honor. That

might be less than the one-third horsepower on a 40-foot boat.
But the canoe, while it might put you in danger,
would not put the environment in danger.
QUESTION;

It isn't a straight- line of comparison,

right down -MR. GORTON:

No, it is not an absolute straight line

comparison»
Mr» Sherwood referred to 16 States which are waiting
in the wings to pass highly inconsistent legislation from that
of the State of Washington.

The simple answer to that question,

under the PWSA, is that the minute one of those State's passes
a statute which creates a true rather than a fictional

conflict

with those of the Stats of Washington, in trade which involves
the two, teie Coast Guard will have the immediate power to step
in and resolve it, overriding either our regulation or that,
of the other Stata, or both.

But that situation simply hasn't

46

taken place yet, and may well never take place»
QUESTION;

Are W8 to taka that as meaning that the

Coast Guard can step in today and take care of all of Mr»
Sherwood3s problems?
MR» GORTON;

Precisely, Mr» Chief Justice.

If the Coast Guard wishes to do so»
But the Coast Guard

remember, neither 'idle district

court nor this Court has permitted an injunction during th©
course of this litigation to prohibit our State from enforcing
the law.
19 75«

It has bean in force since it went into effect in

The Coast Guard has been obviously totally aware of it»

The Coast Guard has obviously, by its lack of action, taken
it as being consistant with its own regulation»
The Commandant of the Coast Guard, in testifying
before the Congress quit® recently, spoke of the tug escort
requirement as being just one form of complementary State
regulation,, So w@ built up a totally fictional conflict here»
Finally, Mr. Justice Rahnquist asked Mr» Sherwood
whether or not there was sort® penalty in. connection with the
tug escort requirements for not meeting the design desires
of the Stata of Washington» And I don't believe he got an answer
to that.
There is, of course, Mr» Justice Rehnquist, no such
penalty»

It is simply a quaint characterization by ARCO of

the tug escort requirements, which are a valid and important
