ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARNER L. TAYLOR, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. TAYLOR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case presents fundamental issues for the Court's
consideration involving the Eighth and Eleventh Amendments to
the United States Constitution.

The case arose out of litigation

concerning the operation of tie Arkansas prison system.

A

number of petitions that had teen filed by Inmates in the
prison system were consolidated by the District Court, counsel
was appointed to represent them and an amended and substituted
complaint was filed seeking relief under Title 42 of the United
States Code, Section 1983.
There are three issues which we ask the /Court to
consider.

First of all, whether Congress in passing the

Civil Rights Attorney *s Fees Awards Act of 1976 abrogated the
Etc;tea Eleventh Amendment immunity and thereby authorized an
award of attorney's fees to be paid from the funds of a State
agency chat was not made a party to the litigation.

And as a

corollary to this first argument, we suggest that even if the
Court should find that Congress did abrogate the State's

4
Eleventh Amendment immunity, that that action not be given
retroactive application in this particular case because it
would work a manifest injustice.

Secondly* we ask the Court

to consider whether the Eleventh Amendment bars an award of
attorney's fees based upon a finding of bad faith against a
State or state agency.
And finally, we ask the Court to consider whether the
lower courts were correct in ruling that indefinite punitive
confinement of recalcitrant inmates is unconstitutional.
The opinion of the District Court was entered on
March 19* 19J6.

It is found at page 141 in the Appendix.

The

•Oistrice Court awarded an attorney's fee of $20,000 to the
court-appointed attorneys for the inmates and ordered that that
fee be paid from the funds of the Department of Correction.
Now, th2 Department of Correction had never been made
to the litigation.

parfcj

The action was filed -- of course, a 1983

action can't be filed directly against the State, under Court
decisions — the action was filed against the Corrections
Commissioner and the members of the Beard of Correction.
The court heId that such an award won3d have only on
ancillary effect on the-State Treasury, citing this Court's
opinion In the case of EdeImaniv» Jord a n.

Furthermore* the

court found that the award was justified under the "bad faith'1
exception to the American rule which was discussed by this
Court in its recent opinion in Alyeska Pipeline Service Company

5
v_*_WiIderness Society.
The eighth Circuit affirmed this award and noted in its
opinion that subsequent to the District Court's decision the
Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976 had been ap­
proved,

That Act was approved on October 19, 1976,

And the

Eighth Circuit held that the award of attorney's fees was proper
under that Act and was not barred by the Eleventh Amendment
immunity of the State of Arkansas.
It is our contention that the Civil Rights Attorney's
Fees Awards Act of 1976 did not operate to abrogate the immunity
of the State of Arkansas to a monetary judgment, because in
passing the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of '76
Congress did not amend Section 1983/ Title 42, to include a
State within the meaning of the term “person."

Therefore, the

threshold fact of Congressional authorization, which this Court
found present in Fitzpatrick v. 331 tzer, was rot present in this
particular case.

The State was not a party to the action.

The Department of Correction was not a party to the action,.
And, in effect, the court lacked jurisdiction over the
Department of Correction and had no jurisdiction to order an
award of attorney's fees.
In Fitzpatrick, Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act- of
1964 had been expressly amended to subject governments and
governmental agencies and political subdivisions to suit under
that section,

But in the present case, 1983 was not

6
specifically amended* and this case more closely resembles the
d ec is ion in Em p 1 oy e es v , Mi s s c ur-1 .Public Health Jleparfcment, a
case in which this Court held that Congress had not abrogated
the State's immunity because it had not specifically amended
Section 16(b) of the Pair Labor Standards Act to include a State
within the meaning of the term "the employer," when it enacted
amendments in 1966.
Even if Congress had tried to abrogate the State's
Eleventh Amendment immunity,, in passing the Act, it failed to
do so,

Because when Congress acts to abrogate a State’s immunity

in a unilateral fashion, that is without a waiver on the part
of the State, pursuant to Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment,
when Congress acts to abrogate a State's immunity pursuant to
Section

it should do so in explicit statutory language.
The legislative history of this Act does not need to

be consulted because there is no ambiguity on the fact of the
Act.
QUESTION:

Well, certainly, some of our cases have

gone sufficiently far so as to say that you look at everything
you. can in construing a statute, rather than the more traditional
rule, perhaps, of a while ago, that only where the legislative
language is unclear do you resort to the history, (tape fades
as if microphone -was turned off for about 10 seconds)
they were going to impose attorney's fees against governmental
bodies.

,0on ’t you think so?

7
MR, TAYLOR:

Yes, sir, but it is our position that

Congress simply misinterpreted the decision of this Court in
Fitzpatrick v, Bitzer,

And Congress did not do what they had

to do to abrogate the State's immunity»

They did not amend

Section 1933 to include a State, within the meaning of the
term "person,"
QUESTION:

Well, is your point that even if Congress

had enacted the language that you find in the Committee Report,
it would have been insufficient, or that the Committee Reports
are net sufficiently weighty, so as to affect the language that
Congress did choose to enact?
MR, TAYLOR:
Reports

It is cur position that the Committee

of course the Court can look at them and consider

them, but there is really no need to because there is no
ambiguity on the face of this particular statute.

If Congress

was so certain that they had effectively abrogated the State's
Eleventh Amendment immunity, it seems strange that there is now
a bill pending in the Senate, Senate Bill 35* which will speci­
fically amend Section 1933 to define the term ''person" as any
individual, State, municipality or any agency or unit of
government of the State,
QUESTION:

Was that type of bill introduced before?

When was that bill introduced?
MR, 'TAYLOR:

This is pending now, sir, introduced on

January 10th of this year.

QUESTION:

'Was it introduced before then, while this

legislation was pending?
MR. TAYLOR:
QUESTION:

Sir., I am not certain whether or not -Well, if it was not, could we assume that

Congress assumed that It was covered, otherwise they would have
introduced a bill like that?
MR. TAYLOR:

Your Honor, 1 believe a more correct

assumption might be that the fact that this bill is pending now
indicates that Congress is not certain that it followed the
guidelines set forth by this Court -~
QUESTION:
MR. TAYLOR;

What citation for that?
In Fitzpatrick v. Bltzer, Your Honor,

this Court held that Congress may act.

But Congress, in that

instance, acted by explicit statutory language, by explicit —
QUESTION:

But it

doesn't apply to this case, does

it?
MR, TAYLOR:

No, sir, I don't think .it should because

we are talking about a very fundamental concept.
QUESTION:
in Congress.

Your point isn't just ignore what happened

You said we can look at the reports, but don't we

have to look at them to interpret this statute?

Maybe you don't

but don t we have to look at them?
MR, TAYLOR:

Your Honor, as a general proposition,

courts hold that in statutory construction it is not necessary
to refer to the legislative history, unless there is some

9
ambiguity.
QUESTION;

We don't have to look at the legislative

history?
MR.-TAYLOR:

No, sir, although I expect that the

Court will look at the legislative history in this particular
instance.
QUESTION:

You may suspect that some will.

You can

put your money on that.
MR. TAYLOR:

The legislative history does indicate

the intent of Congress to abrogate, Your Honor, but it is our
position that Congress, even though it may have tried to
abrogate the State's immunity, simply botched the Job.

They

simply didn't do what they had to do to abrogate the State's
Eleventh Amendment immunity,

Because here we are dealing with

some very fundamental constitutional issues and a very delicate
balance in the relationship between the States and our national
Government and our system of government.

The Eleventh Amendment

is fundamental to that relationship.
And it is our position that when Congress acts to
abrogate that immunity it should do so in explicit statutory
language so there will be no confusion as there is now across
our country as to whether or not obates are liable for at­
torneys ' fees under the provisions of this Act.

If Congress

had acted by enacting a statute with explicit language, there
would not be the kind of confusion we see right now.

10

And In this case there is no waiver by the State of
Arkansas, no waiver expressed or implied.

In EdeIman v. -lordan,

this Court held that the Eleventh Amendment barred an award of
retroactive benefits under a Federal-State program for the
aged, blind and disabled, and the term "ancillary effect" was
discussed by the Court in that opinion.

Ancillary effect refers

to the fiscal consequences that a State may expect in complying
with injunctive relief granted by a court in the future.

It is

a prospective effect.
For example, in this particular case, an ancillary
effect t!f the District Court's decree might be the fact that the
State of Arkansas had to spend over

million to build a new

maximum security unit, but an ancillary effect would not be
the award of attorney's fees.

That would be a direct effect

upon the State treasury.
So the District Court's determination that the award
of $20,000 in attorneys' fees was an ancillary effect is mis­
placed, under the decisions of this Court.
QUESTION:
about the procedure.

General Taylor, let me ask you one question
It is your view that It was wrong to order

the fees paid by the Department of Correction funds.

Would you

concede that the Court had the power to order your client,
the individual defendant, to pay the fees?
MR, TAYLOR:

Your Honor, I don't think so, because

the Attorney's Fees Awards Act had not been passed at the time

11

this decision was made, the award was made.
QUESTION:

Well, if the Act applies, your argument

about the State —
MR» TAYLOR;

My argument would still be that It

should not, Your Honor, because we don't feel like the Act
should be applied retroactively, because to do that will result
in a manifest injustice to the parties.
QUESTION:

Your argument strikes me as -- The

Department of Correction is net a party to the case, is that
right?
MRo TAYLOR:
QUESTION:

That's right.
Go how are your clients hurt by the order

for the Department of Correction to pay the fees, the individual
litigants here?

Aren't they really helped by having the judge

order that the Department pay the fees instead of having them
ind iv id ua 1 ly pa y t hem ?
MR» TAYLOR:

To them, individually, I don't suppose

it makes a great deal of difference, other than the fact that —
QUESTION:

If you prevail and it is up to the trial

judge, ne may say, "Well, I think the Individuals better pay the
fee."

Isn’t that a possible consequence?
MR. TAYLOR:
QUESTION:
MR. TAYLOR:

If this is sent back to the trial judge?
Yes.
That is a possibility, but not under the

Court's determination that we have right now.

12

QUESTION:

That if you prevail and it is sent back to

the trial judge# so you can't order it to be paid by them#
under a different order isn't it entirely possible he'll say#
"The individual defendants have to pay this fee"?
MR. TAYLOR:

Your Honor, I don't know what the court

would say in that instance, because it ordered the fee to be
paid out of the Department of Correction funds and, in effect,
made a finding of bad faith on the part of the Department of
Correction»
QUESTION:

Did the Department of Correction intervene

to object to that order?
MR. TAYLOR:
QUESTXON:

It didn't, did it?

No, sir.
I am just wondering whether you are really

advancing the best interest of your clients in your argument
here, the litigants who are actually effected

I mean the

inc:ividuai defendants,
MR. TAYLOR:

Yes, sir, I think so, because they were

sued in their official capacity, as well as Individually,

And

in their official capacities, we have sued the Commissioner of
Corrections and the Board of Corrections,

And the court's order

orders that the fees be paid out of the funds of the Department
of Correction, which they control in their official capacities.
So we have to
QUESTION:

If the statute applies, would the judge

have power to order the fees paid by the individual defendants?

13

If the statute applies.

But v.e agree with you that it can’t be

applied against the State.
MR. TAYLOR:

Yes,» sir.

QUESTION:

Then could the Judge order individuals

to pay the fees?
MR» TAYLOR: The judge could order the individuals to
pay the fees, if the Act applies.
active application to it»

If the Court gives retro­

But to do that would definitely

result in a manifest injustice* as you have just pointed out -»
to give retroactive effect to this Act* under the holding of
this Court in Bradley v. Schc-cl Board of__the City of Richmond —
QUESTION:

The manifest necessity determination* I

suppose, would take into account the finding of bad faith*
wouldn’t it?
MR» TAYLOR;

Yes, sir.

And we contest that finding.

Bad faiuh does not just
QUESTION:

But two courts have agreed on it, the

District Court and the Court of Appeals»
MR» TAYLOR;

The Court of Appeals footnoted it*

The

District Court held on the basis of bad faith — the Eighth "
Cirauit — in the interim, the Civil Rights Attorney's Pees Act
of 51976 was passed.

The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed,

based upon that particular Act — although the Circuit Court
did note in a footnote that they thought the finding of bad .
faith was justified.

However, the District Court in its opinion.

page 174 o.f the Appendix, notes that there had been "an erratic
but a continuous course of improvement" and a cooperative
attitude of State authorities, generally speaking*
So, when you read the court's opinion, it's difficult
to read bad faith into it.
QUESTION:

Hasn't the correctional provision

in

Arkansas been under Investigation by the Federal Government
since around i960?
MR. TAYLOR:
date it started.

Yes, sir*

I am not sure exactly what

This litigation began In 1969.

QUESTION:
MR0 TAYLOR:
QUESTION:
MR.. TAYLOR:

Didn't they go back way before that?
There has been litigation —
Investigation by the F.B.I.
Your Honor, to be honest yfifch you, I am

not familiar with the course and scope of F.B.I. investigations,
or whether there have been any in our prison system.
QUESTION;

You referred to the bad faith conclusions

reached by the Court of Appeals and, I gues:3, by the District
C ourt.
MR. TAYLOR:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir,
You challenge those determinations, I

take it?
MR. TAYLOR:

Yes, sir, we challenge the determinations,

but more than that, Your Honor, we also challenge the proposi­
tion that a court can make an award of attorney's fees, payable

15

out of the funds of a State agency which is not even a party
to the litigation, based upon this bad faith doctrine which is
an exception to the traditional American rule.

But here, the

court didn't have jurisdiction over the Department of Correction.
The Department of Correction was not e. party in the State of
Arkansas,
QUESTION:

Is the Department of Correction here?

Mil„ TAYLOR:
QUESTION:

Is the Department a party here?
Did you try to Intervene?

No. sir.

Did the

Department of Correction try to Intervene to challenge the
court’s jurisdiction to enter a judgment against it when it
was not a party?
MR, TAYLOR:

No, sir, but under the decisions of this

Court, the Attorney General may protect the Interests of the
State, under the Eleventh Amendment immunity, regardless ox
whether it is a party».
QUESTION:
MR, TAYLOR:

Doesn't he have to file something?
No, sir, that's not my understanding of

1: .. s under Rord v. Department of Treasury, if I am not
mistaken»
QUESTION:
that?

Don’t you have to file something more than

Don't you have to file a paper that makes you a party?
MR* TAYLOR;

No. sir*

No, sir*

I believe the

decisions of this Court have held that the State Attorney
General may protect the interests of the State, pursuant to the

16

Eleventh Amendment, regardless of whether or not the .itate Is
a party to the action*

That argument may be made on behalf of

the State,
QUESTION:
MR. TAYLOR:

I am not saying you are wrong.
But It is our contention that the bad

faith doctrine should not justify an award of attorney's fees
against the Department of Correction in the State.

Furthermore,

this Ac; should not be applied retroactively because to apply
this retroactively, to apply the Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees
Awards Act of 1975 in a retroactive fashion, will work a mani­
fest injustice.
Under the decision of this Court in Bradley v.
School 3oaro of the City of Richmond, the Court noted that
generally a court will apply the laws in existence at the time
it makes its decision unless to do so will result in a manifest
injustice.

What could be more unjust than to require the State

to pay this award when funds have beer appropriated, budgets
have been made, the State had no notice or knowledge that this
award would be assessed against them?

It actually affects the

heart of the fiscal management of the State of Arkansas.
QUESTION:

Well, there is always another fiscal year-

coning along, isn't there?
MRs TAYLOR:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
If the defendants had been assessed these

attorney's fees, would they, as a matter of Arkansas Law, have

17

been reimbursed by the State?
MR. TAYLOR;
such law.

Your Honor, at the time, there was no

Now we have a law that provides for indemnification,

when officials are acting in good faith, for actual damages,
QUESTION:

But at the time, there was no law.

Have

you any reason to suppose that despite the absence of a law
they would or would not have been reimbursed by the State?
Was there any practice?
MR, TAYLOR:

No, sir, to my knowledge, there is

no practice that the State would actually pay the damages,
QUESTION:
MR. TAYLOR;
QUESTION:

Attorney's fees.
Attorney's fees, right.
Even under your present statute, would the

reimbursement not be barred bj the finding of bad faith?
MR. TAYLOR:

That's correct, sir.

Under the present

statute, the State Indemnifies the officials for actual
damages:

There is no mention of attorney's fees in that Act.
This Court, in Newman v„ Plggie Park Enterprises,

recognised that a major purpose of providing for an award of
attorney's fees was to encourage litigants to bring suits to
vindicate the public interest,

A very valid reason.

But, as

to pending eases, such an incentive, is unnecessary, because
the case is already in litigation.
So, it seems to us that prospective application of
this Act will accomplish this goal, while at the same time

18

enabling the States to better prepare for the Increased
financial burden that may be placed upon them in the future.
Our third point that we want; the Court to consider
is whether the lower courts were correct in ruling that in­
definite punitive confinement is unconstitutional.

Punitive

confinement is employed when an inmate simply will not abide by
the rules of the institution; it is a recalcitrant inmate.
They have stripped him of other privileges, denied other bene­
fits in minor-disciplinary proceedings and it's generally
employed: in instances where there is an escape or an assault
on someone or a. refusal to work.
This point does not concern the conditions of the
confinement, but only the duration of confinement.

The District

Court f :>und that the procedures emp 1 oyed in the disciplinary
proceedings were consistent with the decision of this Court in
Wolff- v. McDonald.

And the Court also made specific rulings

so that the inmates now have no more then two in a cell at a
time.

They have clothing and the same diet, regular diet, as

the other inmates, with the exception of dessert.
get any dessert.

They have a bunk and a mattress.

entitled to shower three times a week.

They don't
They are

But the District Court

ruled that they could not be held in punitive confinement for
more than thirty days.

And it is our contention that this was

fair on the part of the District Court and the Eighth Circuit
in placing a limit on the. amount of punitive confinement.

19

QUESTION:

The State wants the right to keep a man as

long as the State wants?
MR. TAYLOR:
QUESTION:

No, sir.
With no limits?

MR. TAYLOR:
his own release.

No, sir.

The inmate holds the key to

Any time he wants to conform to the rules and

regulations of the institution, -do what he is supposed to do —
this is assuming that the rules and regulations are constitu­
tional.

The L is trie t Court found that the rules and regulations

were constitutional.

But we have a situation where an inmate

simply refuses to abide by the rules and regulations.
QUESTION:

If the court had found that this violated

the Eighth Amendment, then do you say the court would have no
power to limit the solitary confinement?

Assuming a correct

finding of a violation of the Eighth Amendment.
The court did not find any constitutional violation
here, did they?
MR« TAYLOR:

The court did hold that it was un­

constitutional to hold men in punitive confinement indefinitely
and ruled that they could not be held there for longer than
thirty cays at a time.

At that time, they would have to be

transferee to the maximum security wing.
■QUESTION:

My question was directed at your previous

statement that the court had not found a constitutional violation,
which didn’t seem to be consistent with the record.

20

MR. TAYLOR:

The court did not find the constitutional

violation in the conditions of confinement, Your Honor, only in
the duration.

The conditions of confinement meet constitutional

muster in the court's decree, at this point.
The court ruled that indefinite punitive confinement
serves no real rehabilitative purpose and simply makes bad men
worse.

But that argument is a penalogical argument.

That

argument is directed toward the administration of the peniten­
tiary.
MR. CHI.JP JUSTICE BURGER:

If you wish to reserve any

time for rebuttal, your signal is on for that purpose.
MR. TAYLOR:

I will reserve the remainder.

MR o CHIEF JUSTICE'BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Kaplan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP PHILIP E. KAPLAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR, KAPLAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
From the beginning of' my participation in this case
in December of 1969 until today, there have been three published
district court opinions, five additional unpublished interim
memoranda and orders of the district court and three opinions

in the Court of Appeals regarding Arkansas Department of
Corrections and the administration of the Arkansas prison

system

21

All of the findings of unconstitutionality of the
Arkansas prison system as cruel and unusual punishment by the
district court have either been affirmed by the Court of
Appeals or never challenged.

Not one of the district court's

most recent findings, either cf fact or conclusions of law,
are challenged here.

What is challenged is one small aspect

of the remedial portion of the judge's order.
QUESTION:

Well, that makes it a relatively easy case

for beta of you to focus on then, doesn't it?
M R. KAPLAN;

Tha t !s c orrec t.

And I think that it is necessary for you. to have a
picture of what life was like in the punitive segregation
section of maximum security in 1975•
QUESTION:

Well, now, why, if the issue is as narrow

as you've just told us it is?
MR. KAPLAN:

So that focus can be directly related

to the judge's power to impose that particular remedy.

MR. KAPLAN:

None of which are challenged.

New, with regard to that thirty days, recall that
the record will demonstrate that persons were kept in a cell
9b feet by 7 feet, designed for one person, frequently, most
often, with three people in the cell.
QUESTION:

Limited to two, as of now?

MR, KAPLAN:
QU ESS TI ON:

Yes, now limited to two.
T ha ts s w ha fc we have n ow.

MR, KAPLAN:

Yes, but also the judge was deciding

this case in a context of his having written decisions since
1963, before Mr. Holt and I entered this case, limiting over­
crowding, prohibiting overcrowding, and never once had he found
those orders being complied with, never once.

And in the con­

text of that series of evasions of court orders since 1963,
he finally says, "No indeterminant sentencing," and only two
in a cell.
One pallet, one steel pallet --QUESTION:

That's not true now, is it?

MR, KAPLAN:
true.

Still true, one steel pallet.

3fill

One steel pallet with mattresses during the day, only.

No other furnishings except for a single unit lavatory and
commode.

That's the entire furnishings of the cell.

That was

true in 1975 snd remains true today.
QUESTION:

No mattress, no blanket, no nothing?

MR. KAPLAN:

Not during the daytime.

23

QUESTION:

Well, at night —

MR. KAPLAN:

At night, a person is furnished with a

mattress and a blanket.
An atmosphere, a pervasive atmosphere of brutality,
from 1968 on and he confirms it in 1975•

Between guards and

Inmates, between inmates and inmates, in this terribly over­
crowded situation, just a pervasive atmosphere of brutality.
No mail from anyone except the court.
No contact with anyone else.

No family contact.

No visits from anyone, except

the occasional visit, perhaps, from a minister.
no law nooks.

No books,

The only book permitted, the Bible.

That's it.

But no law books unless he has been there for in excess cf
20 days.

No exercise, with the exception of, every third day,

to the shower.
QUESTION:

I repeat what everyone else has said,

all this is admitted, is it net?
MR, KAPLAN:

All of this is clearly admitted and

unchallenged, but the basis for the judge's order or no indeterminant sentencing;.

And it is within that context that the

Also, you suggest that it is a part of an

form of punitive segregation violated the Qruel and Unusual

Punishments Clause, did he not?
MR. KAPLAN:

he found that the entire conditions,

including the indefinite sentencing, violated the Cruel and
Unusual section.
QUESTION:

And that is a substantive determination,

not just a formulation of an equitable remedy.
MR. KAPLAN:

That is a substantive determination, one

aspect of the remedy meets that directly.
It is within this context that the judge says no
indefinite sentencing and the State challenges nothing else.
He relates the remedy exactly to the violation.

I say no more brutality, again, for the fourth

or fifth time."

And one of the other things is no more inde­

terminant sentencing and that does help with the disease and
communicable health problem that he finds in other sections of
the prison.

It does help with the overcrowding.

QUESTION:
bad fax:h finding,

Are you arguing this now in support of the
or what is the purpose of this?

MR. KAPLAN:
QUESTION:

Only for the cruel and unusual aspects.
I thought v.e indicated that we didn't need

any more on that.
MR. KAPLAN:

Very well, Your Honor.

25
With regard to the attorney’s fees
QUESTION:

Before you leave that point, do you agree

that this so-called Indefinite, indeterminant sentencing tc
isolation is, in fact, sort of akim to

a civil commitment, i.e.

that the inmate has the keys in his own pocket if he agrees to
abide by the rules and he does abide by the rules.
MR, KAPLAN:
QUESTION:

No.
Well, that's a disagreement of fact.

It

is very unfortunate if we have that here in this Court because
generally vje are not triers of the facts, you know.
MR. KAPLAN:

I think the record is quite clear that

the only way one can be sentenced to punitive segregation is
for a violation of a prison rule after a due process hearing,
period.
QUNfcTION:

That doesn't settle the question.

So he

is there because of a violation of a prison rule, after due
process hearing.

Now, your brother, on the other side, says he

can get out of there any time he says, ,!I will hereafter abide
by the rule," and then proceed to do so.
Now, do you disagree with that as a matter of fact?
If sc, maybe we had better remand this case and have the facts
determined ..

We are not a fact-determining body.

MR. KAPLAN:

I disagree with the issue that a person

holds
QUESTION:

It is not a matter of agreement or

26
disagreement, really, because you agree or disagree about an
idea or an opinion.

This is a matter of fact.

MR. KAPLAN:

I disagree with the matter of fact.

QUESTION:

You say he is factually mistaken when he

tells us that?
MR. KAPLAN:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

Counsel, did the district judge make any

findings of fact on the question of how an inmate terminates
his indeterminant sentence?
MR. KAPLAN:
QUESTION:

He did not.
Lid either side ask him to make a finding

of fact on that issue?
MR. KAPLAN;
QUESTION:

They did not.
So, I suppose the question is:who had the

burden of establishing this fact?

If there is a factual

dispute.
MR. KAPLAN:

There is in the sense that Mr. Justice

Stewart phrased the question.

There is no real dispute of fact;

because the court below did make certain findings with regard
to act .al sentencing,

to punitive isolation.

The rules of the

administration themselves say "there shall be no indefinite
sentences.’1

They Say that and they are quite clear.

shall be none.

There

Sentences were always imposed and the record

shows shat from 1976 on, when there were written rules, sen­
tences were always from zero to thirty days or one to thirty days.

27

That’s all there ever was*

There has never been, "You are

sentenced until you decide to go to work.*' That has never been
the situation.

There was never a need for a finding because

the factual setting never arose.
QUESTION: ' Well, then there is no need for this
relief, if that’s correct.
MR. KAPLAN:

Well, there is because the judge also

found that inmates, such as Alfonzo Graham, were there for six
months on a limited diet, in exactly this situation that. I
attempted to describe.
QUESTION:
MR. KAPLAN:

Is it going to be a limited diet now?
No.

QUESTIONTherefore* we have to know — isn’t it
true that many of these horribles that you have paraded in fror.t
of us aave nov; been ordered to be corrected?
MR. KAPLAN:
QUESTION:

Many of the physical -So that punitive segregation does not.

involve the same conditions that you describe to us?
MR* KAPLAN:

It does not involve the same, but what

the judge described was a situation of evolving and changing
horrori.

This Is the same judge who found horrible situations

in Jackson v. Bishop, with a strap and with a Tucker telephone.
And here he finds himself eight years later with an evolving
kind of brutality, but just in the same direct tradition.
C'UEbTXQM:

Well, hasn't he ordered it to be corrected?

MR. KAPLAN:
QUESTION:
MR. KAPLAN:

He has always ordered it to be corrected
And that hasn’t been —
It has never been in compliance —

At least

for the purposes of the present case your brother is not
questioning those orders.
MR. KAPLAN:

Isn’t that correct?

He has not questioned any of those

orel ers.
QUESTION:
sliver

And there is only this slight, little

that you described to us at the opening of your argu­

ment .
MR. KAPLA N:
QUESTION:

Th© t *s correct.
Mr. Kaplan, do you take the position ~~

I mean I am not quite sure of your position -- that if the
prison officials comply with the judge’s order with respect to
conditions of confinement but they then seek to impose indefin­
ite sentences, would that be cruel and unusual punishment?
MR. KAPLAN:

It is not to be reached here, but it is

our position that that would be true.
QUESTION:

Why Is it not to be reached here, because

you say there was more of a violation in the past which has
now been corrected?
MR. KAPLAN;

I am saying that their- seeking to '

impose cruel and unusual punishment is not at issue ----- I am
sorry — Indefinite sentencing is not at issue.

Their rule

£9
suggested that they could not and they are not suggesting that
they are now attempting to change the rule.
QUESTION:

I rea 11y d on *t unders tand.

QUESTION:

You say the judge says you can‘t keep-him

over 30 days, then you say indeterminant sentence is not in­
volved.

There is a problem.
MR. KAPLAN:

Well, what was happening was that the

institution was keeping people -QUESTION:

Well, what do the orders now say?

You. can't

keep them over 30 days.
MR. KAPLAN:
OUESTION:
MR. KAPLAN:

You may not do it under any circumstances.
You said that has always been the law.
It has always been the rule that you

couldn't keep them ever 30 days.
QUESTION:

Well, why are we spending our time on it

now?
HR. KAPLAN:

QUESTION:

Mr. Kaplan, you mentioned Jackson v. Bishop.

I've had some exposure to that case.

Are you intimating that

the Tucker telephone and the strap are still being used?
MR, KAPLAN:

Oh, no.

Just that there has been an

evolving kind of evasion of the same kinds of brutality,
QUESTION:

Well, there is a difference in degree, at

least, between the Tucker telephone and what you are talking
about now, 1 would think, maybe.

Maybe it isn’t very good, but

at least the Tucker telephone is gone.
MR, KAPLAN:

It is gone, as is the strap,

Viifch regard to the award of counsel fees -QUESTION:

Just a minute, Mr, Kaplan.

Let me ask you

one more question.
If the State says that there have never been punitive
confinements in excess of 30 days, and you say you don't dis­
agree /jith that, why on earth did the judge make a ruling on
that point?
MR, KAPLAN:
never have been any.

Because the State doesn't say that there
That’s their rule.

They had actually

confined people and the record here does shot; that they have
confined people for five and six months.
QUESTION:

hell, then is is an issue?

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may respond to that

at 1:00 o’elock, counsel,
(thereupon, at 12:00 o'clock, noon, the Court recessed
to reconvene at 1:00 o'clock, p„m„, the same day.)

31
AFTERNOON SESSION
(1:01 p.m.)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Kaplan, you may resume

y ou r a rgument.
Is there a question pending from the bench?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP E. KAPLAN, ESQ., (Resumed)
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR, KAPLAN:

There was a question from Mr. Justice

Rehnq u is fc, I b e 1 i ev e.
MR,. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Perhaps, you had better

address that.
MR. JUSTICE REHNQU 1ST:

I'm not sure I remember it.»

and perhaps you don't either.
It was something in the nature of if, in fact, people
are not confined more than 30 days, why did the district Court
make a finding that it would be cruel and unusual punishment
for them to be confined more than 30 days?
MR. KAPLAN:

I think I can address that, and I have

three specific items that I want to refer to to address that
qu e s t i on pa r 11c u la r 1 y.
One, the judge did make a finding with regard to
*

punitive segregation.

It appears at 410 F. Supp. 275.

specific finding is brief.

The

It says, "While most inmates

sentenced to punitive isolation are.released to population
within less than 14 days, many remain in the status in question

32
for weeks or months, depending upon their attitude as appraised
by prison personnel,1'
So it isn't the key that's in their hands.

It's in

someone else’e hands, that the judge has said is already poorly
trained^ responds poorly, responds inadequately and excessively.
The record amply supports it.
QUESTION:

Who should decide the issue that you have

just raised?
MR. KAPLAN:

The judge has responded to that exactly.

He said, "No more than 30 days deals with that whole issue,"
and then he clarified it and said, "If there is another rule
violation, they may be tried again for a separate rule violation
and placed in punitive segregation again, under the rules, for
that s e pa ret e viola tion. "
QUESTION:
MR, KAPLAN:

In other words, a periodic re-examination'1
Well, there are two things he does.

He

aI30 asked for a periodic ;re-examination, but. than said if there
is another serious violation, they be tried again, under all of
the other procedures and safeguards and rules that the prison
has had.
Nov/, that ;s the way the judge has dealt with it,
QUESTION:

But they still can't impose a sentence of

more than 30 days,
MR, KAPLAN:
QUESTION:

That's correct,

Their rules says —

According to him, under the United States

l

33
Constitution, Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, they cannot
impose this kind of sentence for more than 30 days.
MR. KAPLAN:

In the totality of the circumstances

that he finds, he does say that under the Constitution he
finds that in the totality here, in this case in 1975? the
way "I find the conditions’5 -- not the way we find them two
years later and see that some of them have been ameliorated by
some of the conditions or some of his remedy.

But "As 1 find

them here, the totality of the circumstances, I find that more
than 30 days is cruel and unusual."
QUESTION:

Do you think he made his cruel and unusual

punishment ruling on the assumption that the other parts of his
order wouldn't be carried out?
MR, KAPLAN:

On the fear that some of them might not,

but also in recognition of seven or eight years of history of
dealing with these same people under circumstances v/here there
was no carrying out of a remedy.

And I think that you can't

take one little part and say ~~ If tie 30 days had been the
only t iing, the 30 days would have been appropriate.
have relieved over-crowding.

It would

It would have stopped inadquate

or unappealing diet for a whole long period of time.

It would

have reached a number of these items.
QUESTION:

If he wanted to limit the confinement,

the solitary confinement, to 30 days, was it necessary for him
to reach the constitutional issue?

Could he not have decided,

for. example, under the holding of this Court in the Serfass
case, the State was obliged to live up to its own rule?
MR., KAPLAN:

1 think, perhaps, he could have.

He had

before him, however, a mountain of evidence of persons who had
languished in punitive isolation —
QUESTION:

The enforcement of the rules would take

care of that, would it not?
MR. KAPLAN:

The enforcement of the rules would have

taken care of it, if they had enforced their own rule.

But the

rule was always observed in the breach as opposed to in the
observe.nee of the rule, itself, in particular to the rule.

It

was never adhered to, it was breached.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kaplan, where is the rule in the record

You started to tell us.
MR. KAPLAN:
QUESTION:
MR. KAPLAN:

Your Honor, it's at page 24.
Of what?
Of our brief.

The rule,which is taken

directly from their disciplinary procedures, is quoted.

And

It is in Footnote 11, and at the bottom of page 24 is the
state ent about 15 days and punitive segregation not being for
'indefinite or permanent,"

It continues in the footnote section

of page 25.
QUESTION:

But that assumes there is going to be a

restricted diet, and the diet is no longer restricted, except th
absence of dessert.

35
MR. KAPLAN:
stricted.

That's correct * it is no .longer re­

But again, this was only one means of dealing with

it.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kaplan, that says "ordinarily, he

shouldn't be retained for more than 15 days" and on page 25
it says "the regular punitive segregation.

.Do the rules

contemplate extraordinary punitive segregation?
MR. KAPLAN:

Well, what the evidence shoves is that

Mr. Lockhart and Mr. Hutto, both the Commissioner and the
Warden, said that 14 days was the ordinary situation, and almost,
all innates aere released in 14 days.

The testimony also showed

that there was an inmate there for over six months that the
Warden never knew about until he heard about it in testimony in
court.
QUESTION:

I am just asking a very narrow question.

I don’t reed the rule as confining the period of punitive
Segregation to 15 days.
MR» KAPLAN:

The only exception is the next paragraph

t ha t says "recalcitrant inmates are to be returned to ordinary
diet. "

Thatls the only exception that we know about and that

is th e attitudinal problem that the judge was dealing with.
QUESTION:

What do you do with Justice Stevens’

inquiry about the second sentence of the Rule 1 at the bottom
of page 24, where it says,. "Ordinarily no inmate should be
retained in punishment segregation on restrictive diet more than

36
/

15 days"?
MR. KAPLAN:

Well* the facts show -— and that's what

I stated before — the facts show that there never had been a
sentence for more than 30 days,that the only time that there
was the more than 30 days was this recalcitrant attitudinal
problem that the judge specifically addresses.
QUESTION:

But then you couldn't say it was a viola­

tion of this particular rule, if the prison board found extra­
ordinary circumstances to sentence him for more than 30 days,
could you?
MR* KAPLAN:

That's correct.

I'd like to pass on to the attorney's fees issue.
With regard to the award of counsel fees, we advance two
separate and independent arguments.

First, we maintain, as

Justice Stevens has already urged in Fitzpatrick -QUESTION:

I just want to go back just a moment.

Has the judge, has the District Court determined in
tie light of the present conditions in the prison whether the
30 day limit should be retained?
f

MR. KAPLAN:

There has never been a petition to

modify or to be relieved from the provisions of the award,
of that particular injunctive item.
of 1978,

We have had, in January

fifteen more days of ..hearings and still haven't rested

and there has not been yet a motion to be relieved from the
provisions of this award.

QUiCoTICN:

On the grounds that conditions have so

changed that the basis for the order has disappeared?
MR. KAPLAN:

That’s correct.

There has been no such motion.
The first, again, that counsel fees are not subject to
the limitations of the Eleventh Amendment.

If this contention

is accepted by the Court, it is dispositive of the award of
counsel fees.*.

Since the court's award of counsel fees on the

basis of bad faith is expressly authorized in Alyeska,and since
it is not an unusual item to assess fees under the Souffront
doctrine against ~~
QUESTION:

Isn’t it a little out of the ordinary to

assess fees against a non-party?
MR, KAPLAN:

No, I don't think so.

I think that is

clearly the situation contemplated in Souf,front, that one who
prosecutes or defends a suit in the name of another to establish
or protect his own right, or assists in the prosecution, is as
much bound by the judgment as if he had been party to the record.
Arkansas statute compels the Attorney General here to represent
the interests of the State, that is —
QUESTION:
MR. KAPLAN:
QUESTION:
MR. KAPLAN:

Was the State a party?
The State was not a named party.
Was the State a party?
The State was a party by virtue, in our

view, of having been there.

The Attorney General has represented

38
the State in connection with it.

Pursuant to state law, the

Attorney General shall maintain and defend the interests of
the State in matters before the Federal Courts and shall be the
representative of all State officers, boards and commissioners
in all litigation where the interests of the State are in­
volved .
And I don't think that anyone disputes that that is
exactly the situation that has occurred in this case since the
onset of the litigation in 1965, that is, that the Attorney
General has been present representing the interests of the
State.

And, indeed, pursuant to this same statute, the state

has paid the assessments of costs, both attorneys' fees as
costs, other expenses of the case, including the law students
that we hired over a period of years, including the transcripts
for the proceedings before the magistrate, sitting as a special,
master to hear the evidence.

All of those have been paid as

costs by warrant on the State Treasury, pursuant to this
statute.
QUESTION:
MR. KAPLAN:

Where do you find that in this record?
It is in the record of the court belowt

when they satisfied the judgments, they satisfied them based
on their drawing of a'warrant on the Treasury to us.

And we

received all of those checks in the course of the history of
this litigation, drawn on the; Auditor of the abate of Arkansas.
QUESTION:

You are speaking now of fees, other than

39
the ones that are before us here?
MR, KAPLAN:
}

That's correct.

The $8,000 awarded for

the district court proceedings in 1973j these fees to three
lawyers for two and one-half years' work on this case, that is,
everything from the appeal in the Court of Appeals in what is
Pee 1, that amounted to the $20,000.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kaplan, what paper do you have signed

on behalf of the State of Arkansas, in this case, any place?
MR. KAPLAN:

No place, except that all of the documents

have been signed by the Attorney General, representing everybody
pursuant to the statute.
I

MR. KAPLAN:

Nothing is in here that says the State

No one ever challenged the fact that they were

named In those two cases.

In 1975, Judge Henly consolidated

approximately seventy 1983 petitions for hearing on the merits

QUESTION:
MR, KAPLAN:

Which was the named party?
The named party was the Arkansas

.Department of Corrections,in the case I referred to Justice

)

Marshall,
The second grounds Is that the award of counsel fees
is EH'.thorized by the Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Act of 1970,
which was adopted in response to Alyeska, under Fitzpatrick

and under she- -- and was a proper Congressional exercise of
power, not with the magic word amending to say that we can say
a named -- that the State may be sued, but the legislative
history is quite clear, quite explicit, that the Congress
intended that States pay these fees.

The Senate Report is

cited at page 73 of our brief, as is the House Report, both of
which are quite clear that these fees assessed against officials
are tc be collected from the State,

And Representative Brinan's

report makes it clear, or his statements make it clear, quoted
at page 81 of the brief, that it is an enactment pursuant to
Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment,

There is no doubt what

the legislative history in this case provides, and that is that
the States are to pay these awards.
That $20,000 that the State says will be such a
catastrophic burden on it was assessed for three lawyers for
two and one-half to three years* work in a $1 billion budget,
and it is clearly ancillary, if anything is ancillary, the
State paid over $500,000 to build the East Building in response
to what the judge required.

And here we are not dealing with

a catastrophic award of fees which is so going to seriously
debilitate the State’s ability to function in that year or in
any other year.
