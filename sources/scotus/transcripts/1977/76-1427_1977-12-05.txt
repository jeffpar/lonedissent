MR a CHIRP JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 76-1427, Paul McDaniel against Selma Cash Paty, et al.
Mr. LeClercq.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERIC S0 LeCLERCQ, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LeCLERCQ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court.
The Petitioner in this case is Paul A. McDaniel,
a minister from Chattanooga, Tennessee.

He declared as a

candidate and properly filed as a candidate for Delegate to
the 1977 Tennessee Constitutional Convention, at which time he
was sued by one of his opponents to have his name stricken from
the ballot because he-was a minister of the Gospel, and a provi:ion of the present Tennessee Constitution, Article 9, pro­
vides that no priest or minister of the Gospel may serve in
legislative office in Tennessee.

And the call to the Tennessee

Constitutional Convention of 1977 picked up that qualification
for persons who were to serve as delegates to the Constitutional
c: on vent ion.
The matter was heard In Ghe Chancery Court in Hamiltor
■ ounty and the Chancellor enjoined the requirement as being in
violation of the free exercise of religion.

An appeal was

taken to the Tennessee Supreme Court which remanded for not
having given notice to the Attorney General.

The case was then

4
heard in the Chancery Court of Hamilton County, with the Attorney
General appearing, and the Chancellor again enjoined the pro­
vision on .establishment Clause grounds.
during the period when an appeal was taken to the
Tennessee supreme Court, by the State and Ms, Paty, the election
was held and Reverend McDaniel won handily.

He came.within a

Tew votes of having more than the other three candidates com­
bined ,

%
The Tennessee Supreme Court heard this case and

decided that Reverend McDaniel could not serve because of the
provision of the Tennessee Constitution and upheld the exclusion
:>n separation grounds.

Counsel then sought a stay from

Mr, Justice Stewart which was denied with suggestion that
application be made to the Tennessee Supreme Court,which was
then done, and the Tennessee Supreme Court granted a stay until
June 20, 1977, at which time the Tennessee Supreme Court denied
a second request for a stay and Mr, Justice wtewart than grantee

Appellant!s request for a stay.
The Constitutional Convention began August 1, 1977,
and Reverend McDaniel has been sitting os a delegate to that
Convention under the .stay granted by Mr, Justice Stewart.
QUESTION:

Is it still in session, the Constitutional

Convention?
MR, LeCLERCQ:
in session.

The Constitutional Convention is still

5
QUESTION:

Any anticipation or anything you can tell

from the record about when they expect it to end?
MR. LeCLSRCQ:

It is very difficult to predict when

Legislative groups in Tennessee will end.
QUESTION:

Or anywhere else.

QUESTION:

But what would happen, counsel, if upon

election, or upon filing as a candidate under the Tennessee
law, the ordained minister renounced his ordination and re­
signed.

’Would that clear him of the disability or don’t we

know?
MR. LeCLERCQ:
QUESTION:

Query, Mr, Chief Justice ~™

He might be tainted for: life.

MR» EaCLERCQ:

We face that issue in the brief on

the vagueness question* And this was very much a question in
England:

Can one renounce his ministry, Can'one'be defrceR’ed

and than run for office?

It Is by no means clear on the face

of the Tennessee disqualifying provision whether that could be
done,
Now, the issues in this case involve several provisions
of the Constitution.

This is a voting rights case.

It involves

the right to be a candidate for public office which this Court
has vindicated :ln the past.

It involves voting rights as -well,

since she right to vote for priests or ministers of the Gospel
is an important right.

VJe face the same question in this case

iht.t was faced by the Court some years back when it add re

6
the question of whether persons in the military could be fenced
out from candidacy or from exercise of their voting rights»»
QUESTION:

In what cases have we vindicated what you

describe,the right to be a candidate?
MR, LeCLERCQ:

It's my opinion, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

that this was done in Bullock and in Lubln v. Panish and in
American Party of Texas v, White,

It seems to me that one can

say that the rights of candidates qua candidates were vindi­
cated in these cases, although I don't think it makes a great
deal of difference even if the Court should choose to vindicate
these rights as voting rights.
We also have at stake here free exercise rights.
Because Reverend Melanie! has chosen to exercise his rights
as a minister of the Gospel, he has been penalized in his
voting rights.

So you have a situation where the Appellant is

put to the Hobson's choice of either choosing between his
voting rights, which this Court has declared are fundamental
or his free exercise rights, which this Court has declared are
fundamental,
QUESTION:

His voting rights being his right to vote

for himself?
MR» lieCLSECC- 5

Yes, or for any other minister since

this has been certified as a class action by the Chancellor of
the Hamilton County Court,
QUESTION:

Both may be fundamental, but only one is

7
a constitutionally protected right, isnJt that correct?
If you read the case of Miner v. Ha perstat you will find it
stated there by the Court, unanimously, as I remember, that
there is no constitutional right to vote.

That case made

necessary the amendment of our Constitution to allow women to
v ote.

That was an equal protection case.

The Court said the

Equal Protection Clause gave no such right, whereas the First
Amendment protects and creates freedoms and rights, doesn't it?
MR. LeCLERCQ:

Yes.

But we think the voting rights

cases of this Court are sufficient, as well, to seat Appellant.
QUESTION: Who is in this class?
MR. LeCLERCQ:

All ministers who shall be candidates

for office of delegate to this or future constitutional con­
ventions, and all candidates for legislative office.
QUESTION:

How can that oe a class?

I thought a

class was a large number of people.
MR. LeCLERCQ:

Well, we think there may be a number

of other ministers who —
QUESTION:

Name one.

MR, LeCLERCQ:

Mr, Justice Marshall, it Is my under­

standing that there are several other ministers who are serving
at this time as delegates to the Tennessee Constitutional
Convention.
QUESTION:

Is that in this case?

in this case I can put ray hand on?

Is that any place

8

MR, LeCLERCQ:

We did not know at the time that this

class was certified that ~QUJ33TXON:

I thought a class had to be a number that

was too many to name.

I am not using the exact language* but

I think that is what the language is.
MR, LeCLERCQ:

The state class action requirement is

patterned upon Rule 23.
QUESTION:

Why doesn't the class include every

ordained minister in the State of Tennessee* whether or not lie
has a present intention of running for anything?
MR., LeCLERCQ:

Well* that's a point well taken, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

It's an inhibition --

MR, LeCLERCQ:
QUESTION:

It is an inhibition,

— now resting on every ordained minister

in the State* is it not?
MR, LeCLERCQ:

I think that really wouldn't matter very

much* however, because if the class relief were afforded as
Appellant sought* any minister who ever wanted to seek legis­
lative office in Tennessee would be allowed to do so.
QUESTION:

Is It very important to us now for our

purposes, whether it is proper class action or it is only one
man?
MR. LeCLERCQ:
i ess on,

I think it is Important for this

I.- we strike down Chapter 848 of the Tennessess Public

9
Acts of 1976, dealing with the call to this convention, then
we only deal with this particular call and it means that next
year should some minister in Tennessee choose to be a candidate
for legislative office, that he could be excluded under this
provision, and it would entail the great expense that has been
entailed in this or any other case that comes to this Court to
afford relief and we may not have the fortuitous event then
which occurred here.
QUESTION:

Well, this Court always -- If we disagree

with the judgment of the Supreme Court of Tennessee, our mandate
Ls always vacated and reversed for further proceedings not in­
consistent with this opinion.

We would not tell,has I under­

stand our practice, the Supreme Court of Tennessee what form of
mandate to send down to the Chancery Court in Hamilton County,
so long as it was not inconsistent with our opinion.
MRo LeCLSRCQ:

Well, the only problem that I could

see coining from that is that the hupremq Court of Tennessee
limited the cross-appeal taken by Appellant from the Chancellor's
ruling to this particular case and this particular statute, and
they relied upon, I believe, the 0t ory case in Tennessee which,
:Ln our brief, counsel has alleged is inapposite;

It is simply

a question of whether this Court is willing to resolve this
question in Tennessee.
QUESTION:

You'd have a precedent, in any event. If

we simply decided it on the narrowest of grounds, would you not’";

10

MR. LeCLERCQ:

That's quite true, Sir, but It is

also true that Chancellors and circuit judges at the local level,
in Tennessee may view precedents in very different lights.

If

this Court granted relief only as to the call for the 1977
Convention, it‘s possible that some local judge may try to
distinguish that away and deny relief to some ministerial can­
didate for legislative office.

Then the election would be held

and ultimately, even though the State -Appellate Court may
choose to grant relief, it would be faced with a very dis­
ruptive possibility of having to invalidate an election, call an
election again.
QUESTION:

Well, you'd have all the same remedies

that were available to you in this case, wouldn't you?
MR. LeCLERCQ:

We are very lucky that we had a good

Chancellor at the local level who afforded relief and allowed
our candidate -~
QUESTION:

I am thinking of the stay processes.

QUESTION:

You had a very good circuit justice, too.

MR c LeC LERCQ:
QUESTION:

Very fine.

Is the Chancellor still there?

I assume

Che Justice is still here.
MR, LeCLERCQ:

Yes, but we don't have him in every

county in Tennessee, Mr. Justice Marshall.
QUESTION:

Well, if you want us to draw a decree that

•ill stop every judicial officer in the State of Tennessee from

11

doing wrong, forget about it,
MR. LeCL3RCQ:

We don't expect that, but we would like

-» Vie do think we are entitled to a decree that would prevent
the State of Tennessee from ever disqualifying for candidacy fox
public office any person because of his being a priest or a
minister of the Gospel,
QUESTION:

Mr, LeClercq, could I ask a question about

your theory on the merits,
said

Say

Supposing Tennessee had a law that

they decided they wanted to have a fresh look at

the whole governmental structure and they would like to exclude
from those participating in the Constitutional Convention any­
one presently serving in the State Legislature or in the State
Executive Department.
officials.

Say this included all senior government

Would that be permissible?
MR, LeCLERCQ:
QUESTION:

In my opinion, it certainly would,

Well, why wouldn't they be forced to make

the sane kind of Hobson's choice between serving in the Legis­
lature or serving in the Constitutional Convention,
MR, LeCLERCQ:

Because that's a matter of choosing

between two secular offices, and the State can decide that a
man ought to spend all of his time on one secular office and
not split his responsibilities.

But the State, under the

first Amendment, under the Establishment Clause and under the
free Exercise Clause, the State has no business interfering in
what a person does one wav or the other.

12

QUESTION:

What if their theory is that these people

now in public are unduly Influential on the deliberations of the
new body and they might think ministers are unduly persuasive.
They can use certain kinds of arguments that some of the rest
of us can’t use, and so we’d better keep them out of these
debates.
MR* LeCLERCQ:

Well, as to the influence of ministers,

.1 don’t think that it would be permissible to exclude presidents

of corporations and many of them exert substantial Influence or
presidents of universities.
influence.

Many of them exert substantial

And I would say that it would certainly deny

ministers,as a class, equal protection to treat them differently
from other persons who have equal or greater amounts of
influence.
QUESTION:

But to exclude all college presidents

would violate what section of the Constitution?
MR, LeCLERCQ:

I think it would violate the Equal

Protection Clause, because It would be treating people who are
similarly situated differently.
QUESTION:

Suppose it excluded all lawyers.

MR. LeCLERCQ:

Well, you know we have a reference to

that in —

could be made for excluding lawyers which could not be made for
excluding ministers.
QUESTION:

Why?

MR, LeCLERCO:

I'd hate to see that done.

Because

-it would be singling out an occupational class for invidious
treatment without any reference to the capacity of that group
to serve.

Many of the lawyers who serve in legislatures serve

very honorably and with distinction, and in forty-nine other
States in the Union ministeres are permitted to serve in the
legislature.

It is only because of an anachronism that goes

back to the Tennessee -QUESTION:

There is no problem with the validity of

are very substantial,
QUESTION:
Mr, LeClercq.

There is no vagueness as to your client,

X6
MR. LeCLJiRCO:
QUESTION:

Absolutely not.

With respect to the 1641 legislation in

England which your very interesting brief described, the
historical conditions then and how important the clergy was
in England at that time, if we thought that the clergy was
equally important in Tennessee when this statute was passed,
would you say the statute was unrational?
MR. EeCLbRCQ:

There is a vital distinction between

whe situation in England in 1641 and the situation in Tennessee
in 1976, in that the church was established in England.

And

the danger in England was that the Commons which controlled
the appropriation of funds, if dominated by Anglican priests,
would vote the state church great sums of money.

Since we

have no established church in Tennessee and never have had an
established church. I think the argument would be inapposite.
But that 1641 Act, with friends like that, the church needs
few enemies .
A couple of other points.

The Constitution, the body

of the Constitution itself right in the same section with the
Supremacy Clause, provides that there shall be no religious test
for office.

Now, there is some question as to whether that

applies to state offices or whether it applies only to federal
offices.

But it seems to me, coming .where it does in the

Constitution with the Supremacy Clause, that that clause of the
Constitution also affords a basis for overturning this ?

17

requirement.
Now, of course, the support in the decisions of this
Court is not as great for that argument as it is for the
arguments that I have been discussing.
that is a respectable argument.

But I do think that

It has been made, I believe, by

Mr* Justice Black,a number1 of years back, used this as either a
basis of a concurring or dissenting opinion, and I think a
respectable argument can be made, looking back to Far on’s
Records of the Federal Convention.

And even if the Court were

to decide that that clause did not apply in full force at the
time it was adopted, it would be permissible for that guarantee,
as being a fundamental guarantee, to be received through the
cue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Arnemdment.
QUESTION:

bet me ask
one other historical question,
I

14r. LeClercq.
Your brief pointed out that Thomas Jefferson once
uight have disagreed with your argument here and then he later
changed his mind.
■ MR. LeCLERCQ:
QUESTION:

Which is a credit and a strength.

But' do you suppose any provision that

could have commended itself to Thomas Jefferson, even for a
few years, even temporarily, could be so irrational that we
would have to strike it down?
MR. LeCliSRCQ:

Well, this view commended itself to

Thomas Jefferson only at a time prior to the enactment of the

18
of the First Amendment,
Mr. Jefferson’s position,

And I think that explains
I think, historically, one can

justify these clauses in the state constitutions of 1776,
because at that time the church in this country had not been
disestablished 0

And, as Your Honor knows, the church was not

disestablished, I think, in Massachusetts until 1830 or 1831.
o there was a very great fear of an established church, but
the First Amendment, with its Establishment Clause, put those
fears to rest.

And it is interesting that this Tennessee

Provision was 1796,

This is only four years after the First

Amendment, or five years,

So this Tennessee provision is

really contemporaneous with the First Amendment.

And, policy-

it looks back to a time before the First Amendment.

How, whether or not the framers

of this Amendment were anti­

clerical.-- there were some anticlerical forces in Tenn ess ©e
at that time -- or whether they were trying to give a preference
for religion, in either case the clause would fall, on Establishmen t Cla us e g rounds,

Mr. Herrell.

19
ORAL- ARGUMENT OF KENNETH R, HERRELL, ESQ.,
FOR THE RESPONDENTS
MR, HERRELL:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

;he Court:
Under the Constitution that we live under in this
country, we have certain fundamental rights which are guaran­
teed to us by the Constitution and the Amendments,

These are

so fundamental that they cannot be taken away from us.

However,

we also have other rights that we enjoy in this country that
can be, we submit, limited because they are not absolutely
guaranteed by the Constitution.
The case that we have for consideration here today
Involves these two questions, these two principles which 1
want to explore.

These cover all the issues, I believe, that

have been made in this case, the issue of. free exercise of
religion, the Establishment Clause, the Equal Protection Clause
and the Cue Process Clause.
QUESTION:

They are all expressed provisions of the

Constitution, are they not?
MR, HERRELL:

Right.

My purpose here, that X ,\<ant to attempt to distinguish
these cases that have been decided by this Court, citing certair
applications of a person’s rights.
In the first category, we have cases where they are
absolute, that is the right pertaining to a belief.

This cannot

20

be changed by our concept of the Constitution.
not do so.

This Court would

However, there are certain practices which can be

limited, I think, by the application of activities of a person
who wants to enjoy his rights under the Constitution.

For

instance, this Court has said in the Toreaso case -- a case
undertaken to interpret the question of a right of belief -~
this Court said properly that that could not be compelled,
likewise, the cases have said that where you have a question
involving sanctions, as was indicated in the .Schempp case, that
cannot be condoned,

Now, as the Court has said in Cantwell,

the free fact that we have to act is not absolute.

It comes

:.n this latter category and can be subject to certain limita­
tions where there are proper bases for it.
For instance, in the iSherbert case, this Court said
that where there is an indirect burden ;it may. .inhibit \ the
free exercise right where there is a compelling state interest,
In the Braunfeld case, the Court has said that the state may
limit a person’s practice, even though it may cause some in­
convenience to him.

In the kale case, a valid : secular objective

is an appropriate subject of legislation.
Let's look at that as what we have for consideration
before us at this time,

As to the Establishment Clause, I don't

think it need be said that there in any question but what the
purpose of this clause is to keep the state from establishing
any form of religion, any requirement for a particular religion,

21

There has been no establishment created by virtue of the Act
in question here.

And, again, under Schempp, a secular purpose

is a valid basis for a legislative purpose.
QUESTION:

What is the valid secular objective here?

MR. HERRELL:

That is the separation of church and

state which I want to get into.
QUESTION:

And that's the only one.

MR. HERRELL:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Then, this brings us to a tension or a

potential conflict between the Establishment Clause and the
Free Exercise Clause, doesn't it?
MR. HERRELL:

That is correct.

And that is the

thought that I want to explore now on tests that this Court
has used in interpreting cases of this kind.
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, when was this

provision first ena c ted?
MR. HERRELL:

It was enacted in the original

Constitution of Tennessee in 1796,which was carried over,
basically, from the Constitution of North Carolina.
QUESTION:

Has it been reconsidered?

MR. HERRELL;
QUESTION:

Has it ever been litigated?

MRo HERRELL:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

No, sir. ■

Don't you think it is time?

MR* HERRELL:

Well, it is before the Court now.

22

MR. HERRELL:

There are three tests that this Court

can consider that have been recognized previously as a basis
for a test to consider the application of this test, the
rational basis test, that is the minimum test.

And at the

other extreme, there is a compelling state interest test which
Ls a maximum.

But I want to get into now and submit to the

Court that the proper test for this Court, as is laid down in
3ullock, is the strict scrutiny test.

Is it sufficient?

a sufficient basis.

What basis does the

The state submits that it is

Under this principle and test, the system

must be closely scrutinized and found to be reasonably neces­
sary for the carrying out of a legitimate state purpose.

It

Is submitted that this is a legitimate'state purpose and that
Is the separation of church and state.
It is recognized, likewise, that the state cannot be
arbitrary in attempting to accomplish its goals, but it is
submitted there is no arbitrary action in this case, and a
criterion for different treatment must bear some relevance to
the object, the object being the separation of church and state
which is at issue here.
QUESTION:

ho you happen to know whether we have had

any presidents, except one, who was an ordained minister?
MR. HERRELL:
QUESTION:
minister, of course.

No, Your Honor, I do not.

President Wilson was a Presbyterian
No others?

I am not aware of any other

We will move on to other questions that have been
raised in this case, that is the question of equal protection.

treated in a like and similar manner.

All ministers are

What applies to one will

apply to all, as our court said In the case, "and it covers
nriests of all denominations and their counterparts in other
■religions. "
QUESTION:

I thought your opponent was complaining

not so much of our distinctions between priests and ministers as
a distinction between the clergy and the rest of the population.
MR. HERRELL:

If we consider the state's basis, we

think that there is a sufficient basis to put them in a cate­
gory to themselves, that is for the separation of church and
state.
I would like to suggest to the Court, too, what it
nas found, that there is. no fundamental right to hold office —
QUESTION:

Supposing the state said nobody who goes

to church every week shall serve in the state legislature,
regular churchgoers are too religious and may not have complete
separation.
i-i.iT,. HERRELL:

.1 cii.-.nk that would violate one of their

24

religious tenets, where they have a right to worship.

It is

Dart of their fundamental belief.
QUESTION:
no go to church.

Nothing would prevent them from continuing

They just couldn't be in the state legislature,

that's all*
MRC. HERRELL:

1 think that would be in a similar

category to that which we have before us here.
QUESTION:

You say that would be equally valid or

invalid, like this statute?
MR. HERRfiLL:

Yes, sir.

This Court has likewise said in Turner that there is
no fundamental rightQUESTION:

You wouldn't go so far as to approve a

statute that says everybody that believes in Goa should be
kept out, would you?
MR. HERRELL:
QUESTION:

That involves their fundamental belief.

Do I understand you to say that as long

as you serve in the legislature you may not go to church more
than once a month?

That sounded to me like what you said.

least you may not go to church every week.
MR* HERRELL:

)

Well, if you assume that premise, 1

think that would be true, yes.
QUESTION:

Is that what you answered Mr. Justice

Stevens?
MR, HERRELL:
I

Yes, sir, it is.

At

25

This Court, too,, has recently said, in the Williams
case, that there is no basis for claiming the fundamental.,
chat is, a political right, for association,, nor discrimination
against a group.

Now, in connection with that, I would like

to point cut for the benefit of the Court the fact that this
case is net brought as a class action to the attention of this
Court.

There is no assignment made on that.

The Tennessee

.supreme Court said that there was not a class action involved
in this.
Now, this Court has had before it considerations in
other cases, questions of whether religious organizations,
all members of the organization are entitled to the exception.
Again, I want to call attention to the fact that our court has
.said that the ministers cover all beliefs, that is those who
would lead their people, teach them, whether it be of the
Christian religion or of any other religion.

So, from this,

I don't; believe it can be said that you have a question of
vagueness as to who is a minister.
This Court, under the .Selective Service Act, has had
questions about ministers.

I do not need to call to your

attention such cases involving Dickinson.

And as a group,

ministers have been given special attention, special privileges
mainly under the Selective service Act, for instance.

They -are

exempt from service under the selective Service Act.
QUhoTION:

I assume they can give the opening prayer

26

at all of these meetings you are talking about from which they
are excluded»
MR* HERRELL:

Yes, sir*

Likewise, we have certain benefits for members of
the clergy, such as benefits from our Federal Income Tax
provisions, not including all of their income.
Now, the question has been raised here as to whether
chere are ministers in the Tennessee General Assembly,
•;he prisons

Excuse me.

In the;,prisons in the.State.

All of
All

orisons in the State of Tennessee have ministers serving to the
needs of the inmates.
QUESTION:

Are they paid by the state, provided by

she state, is that what you are telling us?
MR* HERRELL:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,

There are some states where they permit

ministers from the outside, but not necessarily making them
employees of the state»

I wanted to be sure which is the case

in Tennessee.
MRS HERRELL:

to by way of summary, there is no

attempt to regulate or control the belief of anyone in
Tennessee relative to what they can belief, so as to exclude
them from membership as a minister,
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, just before you

inish, your opponent places some emphasis on whether or not
there is an established church in jurisdictions which have this

27
sort of provision.

Did Tennessee have an established church

at the very beginning of its statehood?
MR. HERRELL:

No, Your Honor, there has never been

an established church in the State of Tennessee.
QUESTION:

How about this lost State of Franklin

which, I guess, is Intermediate between North Carolina and
Tennessee?

Was there any established church in that state,as

far as you know?
MR. HERRELL:

Not to my knowledge, no.

The lost

State of Franklin was an initial attempt to establish a state
in the State of Tennessee, the eastern part of it.

That

particular state, for one reason or another, gave up its
charter and reverted back as a part of North Carolina, and
nhen a 'later attempt was made to establish the State of
Tennessee which was successful.
QUESTION:

So Franklin went back into North Carolina

I thought it was part of Eastern Tennessee,
MR„ HERRELL:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

In your submission, I take it, those

denominations which make all of the members ministers of that
church would exclude all the members.
MR0 HERRELL:

Yes, sir, we have to stand and say

that ministers, if they are those as defined in the Tennessee
case which undertake to minister to the needs of their congregat ions, vo that extent they would be included

28
QUESTION:

Well, under the Tennessee definition, must

there be an identifiable congregation in order to make its
leader a minister?
MR, HERRELL:

I don't think so, as long as he would

be in that category where he would undertake to lead some of
the peopleo
QUESTION:

How could he get out from under being

termed a minister under Tennessee law?
MR» HERRELL:

That could be a very difficult decision

;o have to be made.
QUESTION:

Difficult or impossible?

MR. HERRELL:

Well, I think you might even say

Impossible to the extent that once a man is qualified as a
minister and holds those beliefs, that he could be said to
continue those in his thoughts subconsciously.
QUESTION:

And be excluded,

MR, HERRELL:
QUESTION:

And be excluded, yes, sir.
So, I assume that if he says, "I am no

longer a minister of the Gospel.

I am an atheist," that

wouldn't help him.
MR, HERRELL:

Well, if he professes to be an atheist

and does not adhere to his religion, that might be a little
different category.
QUESTION:
atheist.

So, he might make it if he becomes an

29

MR. HERRELL:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

You can't put the tread back on a tire by

running the car in reverse.
MR. HERRELL:

That's what I am trying to say, yes, Sir.

Again, I want to summarize this, very briefly, to say
that there is no attempt made to regulate the belief by this
Act.

There is no attempt made to regulate the practice of a

religion by the Act that is in question.

And there is no

denial of Appellant's rights under the Equal Protection Clause
or the Fourteenth Amendment, and all ministers and their
counterparts in all religions are excluded under the provisions
of Article 9 Section 1, of the Tennessee Constitution.
>

There

is no fundamental right to hold public office.
If the Court has no further questions, I'll submit it.
MR0 CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Jo you have anything further, Mr. LeClercq?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OP FREE ERIC S. LeCLERCQ, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LeCLERCQ:

Briefly.

The separation of church and state argument which has
been made by the Attorney General of Tennessee is a state
doctrine, and it's our position that this runs afoul of the
federal separation of church and state doctrine.
The question of whether this case is brought as a
class action to this Court, Appellant's position on that issue

30

is that it was properly certified as a class action by the
Chancellor and the authority on which the Tennessee court
relied to deny the cross-appeal of Appellant was inapposite,
QUESTION:

What federal statute is raised by that?

MR» LeCLSRCQ:

It's a question of whether or not

this issue must be addressed again in some other litigation
after this case has been decided,
QUESTION:

What federal right were you denied by

;he .Supreme Court of Tennessee's ruling on that aspect of the
ease?
MR, LeCLSRCQ:
N

situated to Reverend McDaniel to assert their federally pro­
jected rights to seek legislative office in the -QUESTION:

Where do we find that enunciated in the

Constitution or in the cases?
MR. LeCLSRCQ:

It would be in the voting rights.

It would be in the same free exercise and establishment rights
chat are being asserted here.

It's also a question of economics.

It is a question of whether or not counsel — whether there is
a likelihood of this Court's decision leaving open the way for
counsel tc have to come back up'.and do this sort of thing again

)

on candidacy for legislative office,
QUESTION:

Are you against that or for that?

MR. LeCLSRCQ:
saving the money.

1 would be very much in favor of

Indeed, speaking of money, this is a 1983

31

action for which, if Appellant prevails, there is a right to
attorney fees.

Also, under the voting rights section of

the Voting Rights Act of 1975* there is provision for an award
of attorney fees to prevailing counsel in voting rights liti­
gation.

So it would seem to rue that it would even be in the

interest of the otate of Tennessee to have the thing decided
once and for all, unless they want to pay counsel to do the
same thing that had already been done.
The matter of ministers having special privileges,
being excluded from the service, the ready answer to that which
we provided in our brief is that this is to encourage the free
exercise rights of those who have been removed from their
churches by being drafted, or otherwise going into the Army.
Similarly, the tax rights, this is to advance free exercise
rights, the tax advantages that are afforded ministers.

The

ifference between the tax advantages and the service provisions relating to ministers in law and this case is that here
there is a penalty against ministers, and those cases involve
preferences.
one other point.

Although it has not commanded a

majority view on this Court, it is the case that the Appellant
is a black minister, and in the amended complaint it was alleged
that the effect of this provision is to disproportionately
exclude black leadership from candidacy for public office.
