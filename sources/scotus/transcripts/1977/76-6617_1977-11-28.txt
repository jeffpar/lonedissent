MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Chandler.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN T, CHANDLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CHANDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may It please

the Court:
I am John Chandler, Attorney for the Petitioner,
Richard Greene, addmitted pro ad vitae in Case Noe 76-6617*
This case arises upon the petition for writ of certiorari to
review the decision of the II, S. Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit which affirmed the denial of habeas corpus
relief by the United States District Court for the Middle
District of Florida.
The issues presented in this case are two-fold, one
brought forth by the Petitioner and one brought forth by the
Respondent, Raymond Massey.

The first issue is whether the

Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment bars re-trial of
the defendant for the same offense when Appellate Court re­
verses a conviction because the evidence was insufficient to
prove the charged crime.

The secondary issue, and one which

Respondent would have as threshold, is whether Federal habeas
corpus review of the double jeopardy claim is precluded after
consideration of that claim by the state court.

h

The case briefly —■ and it's a case which arises
some 13 years ago, or almost 13 years ago.

In 1965, Richard

Greene and Jose Manuel Sosa were found guilty of first degree
murder.

They had a trial by jury.

They made both a motion for

a directed verdict of acquittal and a motion for a new trial.
It is noteworthy that the motion for a new trial was stricken
and never was offered.

On November 1968, the Florida Supreme

Court, on appeal of this death penalty case, reversed the con­
viction and remanded for a new trial, due to the insufficiency
of the evidence.

This was a per curiam decision and was
*

unequivocal after the reason for reversal.

Upon remand of

this reversal by the Supreme Court of Florida, there was a
change of venue.

The Defendant was tried then in Orange County,

Florida, instead of in Hillsborough County, Florida.

In the

trial court at that time, Defendant made a motion to dismiss
on double jeopardy grounds.

Alternatively, he asked that the

case be transferred to the Criminal Court of Record because in
Florida the Criminal Court of Record would then have juris­
diction, since we would no longer be operating in a first
degree murder situation.

That motion was denied.

At that time,

the .Defendant applied to the Second District Court of Appeals
with a suggestion for writ of prohibition to prevent, again on
double jeopardy grounds, his re-trial for that sane offense.
This was denied by the Second District Court of Appeals.

On

January 15, 1972, after Defendant was re-tried, again for first-

5
degree murder, he was convicted, and the prosecution at that
time presented new witnesses and the defendant, after the
trial, was sentenced to life imprisonment this time, rather
than the death penalty, upon a jury verdict recommending
mercy.
QUESTION:

Mr, Chandler, the first opinion of the

Supreme Court of Florida, is that in the record here?
MR, CHANDLER:

It is not contained in the Appendix

of this case,
QUESTION:

You quote from one paragraph of it on

Appendix. Page 3, I believe.
QUESTION:

But the whole thing is not here.

MR, CHAMiLBR:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

he can get it.

MR, CHANDLER:

That ■ s all right.

After the re-trial and after he was

again convicted, the .Defendant then appealed to the Fourth
District Court of Appeals of Florida which affirmed the con­
viction,

That court recognized that the issue was an

intriguing one, intellectually, but felt for some reason
not apparent in Florida law, that they could not define the
double jeopardy claim because of the Second District Court's
opinion which had said that the re-trial did not violate
double jeopardy,

They said that the issue was raised judicata,

and therefore they could not decide it,
QUESTION:

Nell, might they not have found — have

6
felt themselves bound by the earlier opinion of the Supreme
Court of Florida, too, which said the evidence did not meet
the reasonable doubt standard, and went on to say the Interests
of justice require a new trial?
MR.. CHANDLER:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, X don't

believe the Fourth District Court of Appeals was at all
motivated by that.

It was motivated only by the Second

District Court of Appeals' opinion which had denied the writ
of prohibition.

The c-econd District Court of Appeals had,

for some reason, recognized a standard of proof which they
said that the Supreme Court did not reverse because of the
insufficiency of the evidence, but that certainly isn't
apparent from the Supreme Court's opinion, and it also was
not required by the Second District Court cf Appeals to
recognize that type of legal proposition.
QUESTION:

It certainly is apparent from the Supreme

Court of Florida opinion,though, that the Supreme Court of
Florida intended that there be another trial.
MR, CHANDIER:

Absolutely,

That is correct.

In 1975> this Court denied a writ of certiorari on
this issue and in 1976 the U.s. District Court of the Middle
District of Florida denied a petition for writ of habeas corpus,
recognizing also the interesting nature of the issue,and saying
that it would have been inclined to grant the writ had the
matter been a matter of first impression in the United states

7
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, but that because there
was prior precedent and because the prior precedent of the
Fifth Circuit would allow re-trial* he had to.deny the writ.
The UcSe Court of Appeals in January 1977 affirmed
the Fifth Circuit Court opinion-, on the basis of the precedent
that the District Court had recognized, namely, United States
y, Bass and Musqulz v, United States,
It is the Petitioner's proposition and position that
the Florida Supreme Court held the evidence to be insufficient
as a matter of law,

Both the U,S, District Court and the

Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit recognized that this
was the case.

If the trial judge had directed acquittal when

the original motion for a directed verdict had been made*
obviously, there could be no re-trial under double jeopardy
principles because at that time the man had been conflicted „
The Florida Supreme Court's holding indicates that
the trial judge erred in not acquitting because this is as
much a function of the trial judge to direct e verdict of
acquittal on proper motion made as it is for the Appellate
Court-to reverse on insufficiency of the evidence.

Then why

should not the Appellate finding of insufficient evidence not
entitle a defendant to a directed verdict of acquittal?
The reason,which results In what I believe is an
anomaly, lies, I think, in the history of the double jeopardy
cases before this Court,

8
QUESTION:

The Supreme Court of Florida could have

said that in view of the fact that the judge should have granted
it, we hereby grant it.
MR, CHANDLER:

Acquit him and turn him. loose.
They could have done so, Mr. Justice

Marshall, but —
QUESTION:

But they didn't.

MR, CHANDLER:
QUESTION:

They did not.

And that's your problem.

MR. CHANDLER:

That would be my problem.

It is my

problem here but that is not — The law of Florida is that
when a court reverses on insufficiency of the evidence, they
may reverse and remand for a new trial.

And so the question

does not arise as to whether they could have said what the
trial judge's actual duty is.
QUiiJTION:

In fact, ~~

My brother, Rehnquist, raises the point

that he emphasised’/the fact that "What I'm actually doing, in

MR. CHANDLER:
QUESTION:

£

new trial,

That is correct.

That is the whole gravamen of what he

said.
MR, CHANDLER;

That is correct.

That is what the

court is saying, "You get a new trial.." rather than saying,
"In the interest of justice, a new trial is not the proper
vehicle, in fact, the directed verdict — "
QUESTION:

But suppose the court had said to counsel.

9
"I will give you a new trial or I will let you stay."
What would counsel say?
MR, CHANDLER:

With a choice like that, there really

is no choice.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. CHANDLER:

And, as I say, the reason for the

treatment of double jeopardy and re-trial in situations like
this comes from the line of cases from this Court, the earliest
being United States v. Ball.

In the Ball case, the reversal

was based upon an insufficient indictment.

In that situation,

we do not quibble and we do not argue that re-trial would not
be proper.
The first case and the real troubling case and the
case that troubles all of the Circuit Courts of the United
States and many of the State Courts is Biyan v« United States,
where this Court said that re-trial after a finding of insuf­
ficient evidence did not violate the double jeopardy principle,
apparently because of the notion that by appealing the defen­
dant waived the double jeopardy argument.

At that time, the

possibility that there may be a reason to delineate reversals
for insufficient evidence and reversals for other trial error
was not apparent to the Court,

But in Sapir v. United nit a tea ,

this Court reversed e Circuit Court, United States Circuit
Court opinion of the Tenth Circuit which had first reversed a
conviction and directed acquittal, and then on rehearing, under

10

its power under 28'U.S.C. Section 2106* decided that It would
remand for a new trial.

This Court reversed the Circuit

Court's opinion* per curiam., without opinion* and in a con­
curring opinion by Mr, Justice Douglas it was stated that the
reason for this was that a finding of insufficiency of the
evidence was entitled to the same treatment as If the trial
judge had directed a verdict of acquittal,

And for that reason,

Mr, Justice Douglas' said* they must reinstate the initial
reversal so that the man could not be re-tried,
QUESTION:

Was. that the case in which Mr, Justice

Douglas' separate opinion made a distinction between cases
where a. motion for acquittal had been made and cases where no
such motion had been made but only the motion for a new trial?
MR, CHANDLER:

That is correct.

And then this Court

seemed to accept his proposition on that.
QUESTION:

Well* this Court was simply silent,

It

was per curium,
MR. C HA IDLER:

It was in. that case, but in Forman v.
*

i Migffti wTrtiU»>1ftffi-HTHn^rn,-r

United States this matter was* in dictum, at least* seemed to
bo settled and as Justice Douglas said It should be treated.
However* the Forman case was not an insufficiency of evidence
case.

In fact* the problem there was bad jury instruction.

It was reversed for that reason and. again* we would not
quibble with re-trial in that situation.
Motion for a new trial, however* is really not a

n
valid criterion.

It doesn’t relate logically to the insuf­

ficiency of the evidence,
QUESTION:

Does Florida have a ground for re-trial

whereby the trial judge sits, in effect -- and I am thinking of
the practice in my own State of Arizona -« as a thirteenth
juror and says there may have been sufficient evidence to
warrant submitting the case to the jury, but I think justice
requires they get another shot at it, so I'm going to grant a
new trial?
MR, CHANDLER:

No, Your Honor, the trial judge does

not have that power.
QUESTION:

All he can do on the evidentiary grounds

on a —■ He just has no authority then to grant a new trial on
the basis of insufficiency of the evidence,
MR, CHANDLER;

Oh, yes.

Insufficiency of the

evidence, yes,
QUESTION:

Well, on the grounds that he shouldn’t have

submitted the case to the jury in the first place,
MR, CHANDLER:

Yes, you can make both a directed

verdict of acquittal and a motion for a new trial on the same
grounds in the State of Florida*
QUESTION:

But if you make a motion fc-r £ new trial

on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to have
submitted the case to the jury, I take it you get a new trial
and not a dismissal.

12

QUESTION:

Does that constitute a waiver?

MR* CHANDLER:

I don't believe so3 Your Honor*

because *—
QUESTION:

Well, what’s the law of Florida on that

score?
MR, CHANDLER:

The law of Florida Is that you may

appeal, both a directed verdict, you may appeal your denial of
a directed verdict of acquittal and the denial cf a motion for
a new trial*

It was formerly thought in Florida —

QUESTION:

But could the judge deny the motion for

acquittal and grant the motion for a new trial cn the ground
that — the state of the evidence?
MR, CHANDLER:

I think it's not settled in Florida

whether that could be done or not,
done.

I believe it could be

At that time., though, the defendant could appeal the

denial of the directed verdict of acquittal.

So that, what

I am really saying here is that it is not settled, it is
unclear, logically, I think, in the State of Florida, just, I
think, as it is unclear in the circuit courts of the United
States •*■**
QUESTION:

I don't see why it is so illogical to

connect notion for new trial with the state of the evidence
when in an awful lot of places around the crountry, as
Brother Rehnquisfc says, new trials are grantee cn the grounds
that the evidence isn't very convincing to the judge*

13

MRo CHANDLER:

That may be.

Only in Florida, if

it is unconvincing, there must not be sufficient evidence on an
element of the crime,
QUESTION:

He just has doubt enough that he grants

a new trial,
MR, CHANDLER:
QUESTION:
sufficient,

Yes, I think —•

But doesn't say the evidence is in­

He doesn't grant the motion to acquit,

MR. CHANDLER:
QUESTION:

I think it is done.

As you say it is in Florida, how does a

trial judge decide whether to grant a new trial or a judgment
N.OJ, on the basis of insufficiency of the evidence?
MR. CHANDLER:

How did the trial judge decide that?

I am not sure how he would ever decide that issue, but I think
logically If the evidence presented before the jury was not
sufficient to convict then the defendant is entitled in
Florida as he is in a lot of other states to a directed verdict
of acquittal.

So that a motion for a new trial can be made on

other grounds,
QUESTION:

But it cannot be made on the grounds of

insufficiency of the evidence?
MR* CHANDLER:
QUESTION:

It can —

What criteria does the trial judge apply

in deciding that motion?
MR, CHANDLER;

I don't believe there is any criteria.

I couldn't delineate what the criteria is.
QUESTION:

In this case, you made a motion for a new

trial and a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal.
MR» CHANDLER:
QUESTION:

That's correct,

And both were denied.

by
w the trial court.

Both were denied
*

MR. CHANDLER:

The motion for a new trial was denied.

Actually, it was never heard.

It was stricken because an

appeal had already been filed, and in Florida trial court it
was without jurisdiction to hear the motion for a new trial.
QUESTION:

X am just looking at your statement of the

case in your brief,
MR. CRANDLER:

That's correct.

Both were made and

both were denied.
QUESTION:

That's what you say.

And were both made

on the insufficiency of the evidence?
MR. CHANDLER:

The motion for a new trial, I believe,

was granted on several different errors, one of which may or
may not have been -QUESTION:

Including, probably, the insufficiency

of the evidence.
MR. CHANDLER:

Very well could have been.

The reason

for that is ~~
QUESTION:

It Is pretty hard to find a form book that

doesn't have it in there

MR, CHANDLER:

The reason for that, Mr* Justice

Stewart, Is that In Florida the law was very unclear as to
whether you 4ml to make a motion for a new trial In order to
appeal the sufficiency of the evidence.

It wasn't until after

this case was decided that in other than death penalty cases,
and this was one of those, whether you had to make such a
motion or not.

Later it was determined that no, indeed, you

could appeal the denial of the directed verdict of acquittal.
That law was very confusing and so the counsel really had no
choice if he wanted to cover the —
QUESTION:

If he wanted to protect his client fully,

MR, C HA IDLER:
QUESTION:

Yes,

The state of the law was, I suppose,

that If she motion for a new trial was made and a motion for
a directed verdict of acquittal was made along with it, each
grounded on the proposition that there was insufficient evidence
to convict, it was within the discretion of the trial court
whether to grant one motion, or either motion,or both, or
neither»

Is that about right?
MR, CHANDLER:

That's about right.

It would have to

And I say that!s because there Is no previous delineation

cf what is the correct procedure,
QUESTION:

And the judge could avoid any possible

double jeopardy question by granting the motion for a new
trial on the basis of some trial error, could he not?

16

MR. CBAM1LER;

That's true.

And still, the defendant

could appeal the denial of the directed verdict of acquittal
motion,

So that he still has a chance of raising that issue

and reversing the trial judge on the denial of that motion.
And in this case —
QUESTION:

The trial judge is concerned about double

jeopardy problem and the consequences of granting on the in­
sufficiency of the evidence.

He certainly would grant the

new trial then on trial error, wouldn't he? Presumably,
MR. CHANDLER:
QUESTION:

I am not sure I understand, but —

Well, there is no double jeopardy problem

arises if he grants the new trial for trial error, rather than
sufficiency of the evidence,
MR. CHANDLER:

That is true, if there is error, but

I would assume the judge would do his duty as he saw it and
would reverse for the proper reasons.

I am not sure I am

responding to the question,
QUESTION:

If he was in doubt.

Suppose the dual

motion was made, as here.
MR, CHANDLER:
QUESTION:

If he was in doubt, yes.

He had some doubt about the sufficiency

of the evidence and he had some doubt about the trial error.
I repeat my question.

If he were cautious and wanted to avoid

any problems of double jeopardy, he would then grant the new
trial for the specific trial error, would he not?

IT
MRo GHAMjLER:
QUESTION:

Yes, I am sure he would .

And avoid all these problems.

MR. CHANDLER:

Rather than face the issue,, if that

was his purpose, I guess that's what he would do.
QUESTION:

What would happen if the appeal asked

for a new trial?
MR. CHANSLER:

I suppose vie could say that he could

waive it if he asked for a new trial, but -QUESTION:

We really don't know what happened in

the court down there, do we?
MR. CHANDLER: Well, I believe we do. Your Honor,

cited in the opinion of the Fifth Circuit which is printed —

In the trial court.

MR. CKAIDLER;
QUESTION:

In the trial court, yes,

I am talking about in the Supreme Court.

MR, CHANDLER:

Yes, in reversal for certain errors

he would be asking for a new trial.

That would be re-trial

for errors other than the insufficiency of the evidence.
QUESTION:

What did he a sic for?

MR, CHANDLER:

He aslced —

QUESTION:

We don't know, do we?

MRo'CHANDLER:
QUESTION:

Mo, we don't»

We will have to get that, won't we?

The trouble is, how do you differentiate between
the right of the trial judge to make the distinction and deny
that right to the appellate court?
MR» CHANDLER:

We don't deny the right, Mr® Justice

Marshall, we say that if the court reverses on the insufficiency
of the evidence the man could not be re-tried*

If it reverses

on the other grounds, then he could be re-tried.

But if the

evidence is insufficient, there should be no difference between
the trial judge's finding and an appellate court finding and,
therefore, either case, he would have, having been entitled
to a directed verdict of acquittal, he would have been subjected
to multiple trials, which is the real test for double jeopardy,
I believe, in the cases before this Court.
QUESTION:

In the case you are talking about, he

used that magic word, “acquittal."
MR. CHANuLER:
QUBIT ION;

Yes.

Which you don't have the benefit of.

MR. CI-IANDLER:

No.

Vie do not have a final acquittal,

but we have ~ ~
QUESTION:

You don't have any acquittal,

MR, CHANDLER:

We do not.

We have the Supreme

Court saying that the trial judge erred in — they said the

19

evidence is insufficient to convict, meaning the jury did not
have sufficient evidence before them to convict this man, and
therefore he was entitled to an acquittal if that was the
state of the law.

I believe that after Forman and Saplr that

it probably is the state of the law and definitely should be
the state of the law*
QUESTION:

In all the other cases I know, the word

“acquittal" is in there.

He is acquitted of one offense and

held guilty on the other one.
MR, CHAIOLER:

Absolutely, no doubt. Your Honor.

And tills was a little different from that because we are
talking about —
QUESTION:

You just don't have the magic word.

an entitlement to it.
QUESTION;

That's right.

Vie are talking about

In Florida you will not get —
You say you have everything but the actual

word,
MR, CHANDLER:

That's right.

And you will never

get, I believe, in Florida, those magic words.

You will always

get a re-trial, even if the court says the trial judge erred in
not finding the evidence sufficient, or insufficient, and they
will remand for a new trial.,
QUESTION:

Well, what if in the trial court the

defendant's counsel moved only for a directed judgment of
acquittal and rested on that, and that was denied at the trial

20

court?

And then it was appealed and the only ground for appeal

was that the trial court erred in not directing an acquittal
because the evidence was insufficient.

And if the Supreme

Court of Florida held "Yes, Mr. defendant, Appellant* you are
correct*" now* surely* the court would then

Could the court

then grant a new trial?
MR. CHANDLER:

Under law established by this Court

QUESTION:

No* no.

MR. CHANDLER:
QUESTION:

I am talking about in Florida.

In Florida* yes* he could.

Even though the only error alleged and

sustained was that the trial court erred in not directing an
acquittal because of the insufficiency of the evidence,
Perhaps that case has never arisen.

I suppose the lawyer

always makes a double motion.
MR, CHANDLER;

That language has never arisen.

That situation* in effect* has arisen and arisen very recently
in Florida in a case that was cited in our reply brief,
McArthur v. State.

In fact* they said the evidence was in­

sufficient and in the interest of justice we remand for new
trial under Florida's Appellate Rule which the Fifth Circuit
says is coextensive with the 28 U.S.C» 2106 In the Federal
Court.
QUESTION:

And was that a case in which the only-

motion was a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal grounded

21

upon the insufficiency of the evidence?
MR, CHANGLER:

No, it was not.

What I am saying is

that that case is so strong that it would show that the result
would be the same in Florida, indeed, would be the same in
some other states.
QUESTION:

And what's that case?

Yes, it's in the reply brief,

AFTERNOON SESSION

MR... CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Chandler.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN T. CHANDLER, ESQ., (Resumed)
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CHANELER:

Our position, succinctly stated, is

that a finding of insufficiency of the evidence on appeal
should have the same remedy as the directed verdict of
acquittal if the trial judge had rendered it, had ordered it.
In either case, double jeopardy prevents re-trial.

This is

based upon the underlying principle of double jeopardy.

It

would be the prevention of the expense, ordeal and harassment
of defendants by subjecting to multiple trials defendants, so
that even one who is innocent stands a greater chance of
being found guilty.
The effect of deciding in Petitioner’s favor today
would be that the appellate courts may direct entry of a
judgment for a lesser included offense if the evidence is
adequate on the record.
QUESTION:

Mr. Chandler, do the Florida appellate

courts have that power?

I noticed, reading this per curiam,

that it can be read as saying that the evidence was insufficient
to establish,beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendants
committed murder in the first degree.

If you put the emphasis

on the last phrase, it might be implicit that there was plenty

23

of evidence to convict them of second degree murder, or perhaps
of manslaughter.
Some state appellate courts have the power to forth­
with enter a verdict of guilty of a lesser included offense,
and in some states, 1 think, the appellate courts do not have
that power.

Do the Florida appellate courts have that power?

MRo CHANDLER:

Yes, Respondent has cited that as one

of — in his brief -- as one of the alternatives the Court
has.

Arid we would also say the appellate court, of course,

could direct an acquittal of all the included offenses as well,
QUESTION:

Yes, they could do so.

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

Without it barring your client's right to

jury trial,
MR® CHANDLER:

That's true.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY M, HIPLER, ESQ.,
FOR THE RES POKE-ENT
MR, HIPLER:

Mr* Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I have raised two issues in my brief, the Stone
issue, Point A, and my Point B, the double jeopardy claim,
I want to argue the Stone issue In the latter part of my
argument, if Your Honors please*

ho I will reserve several

minutes *
We feel, Your Honors, there is no double jeopardy
violation when an appellate court reverses on ar insufficiency
of evidence grounds, as well as others*

We feel that the

Federal statutes, one is 2106, as well as Florida Appellate
Rule 6.16(b) in Florida, as well as some thirty state statutes,
allow an appellate court to reverse on sufficiency of evidence
grounds, as well as reversible error grounds.

We feel that in

our situation, the case at bar, where the appellate court felt
that it was appropriate and just, using the words, "in the
interest of justice,"the trial would be proper upon remandv
It was within their power and discretion, despite the suf­
ficiency of the evidence in the case at bar.
We feel also, if Your Honors please, basically, that
the case law enunciated by this Honorable Court through the
years has permitted what the Florida Supreme Court did in the
first reversal bacr: in 1968,

The Bryan case reversed where the

25

state; rather the Government, there failed to make it a prima
facie case, prima facie evidence case, according to the position
taken by the Petitioner there,

The Yates case, where this

Court reversed and ordered a new trial and discharged other
defendants and went ahead and said that there had been some
evidence as to a conspiracy in the 1957 case»

I think the

words used were "probably insufficient as to some," and there
was some evidence where the jury could have, indeed, convicted
as to others.

So it was a reversal for a new trial as a sum,

clearly within the Court's discretion, rather than review
the history, going back to U,S, v, Ball and more recent cases
of Sapir and Forman which do indicate that in appellate court,
if Your Honors please, do have that power to reverse for a new
trial,
We also feel, if Your Honors please, that there is
nothing inconsistent with the Double Jeopardy Clause that
would preclude an appellate court to reverse for a new trial,
that the public policy reasons clearly favor the Government or
the prosecution at the case at bar.

Vie don't say that in all

situations that an appellate court can go ahead and reverse for
a new trial or Government may take an appeal.

For example, if

a jury comes back not guilty or if a trial judge enters a
judgment of acquittal then it is clear that the Government can't
take an appeal.

Also if there is prosecutorial overreaching,

in a sense, as U.S, v, Jorn, where discharge of the jury

26

occurred without the defendant's behest, without his request,
and it did not fall Into what has been termed adamant necessity
or absolute necessity, going back to U.S. v. Perez.

VJe feel

in those situations the law is clear.
QUESTION:

Mr» Hipler, could 1 interrupt with a

question.
Do .1 correctly understand, as a matter of Florida
law, when the evidence is insufficient, the appellate court
may either direct that a new trial be had or that a judgment
of acquittal be entered?
MRo HIPLMR:

Your Honor, the Florida law does permit

that, but I think the words are used that the defendant would
be discharged, rather than going ahead and entering a judgment
of acquittal.
QUESTION:

Is there anything in Florida law that

tells us which of those two alternatives should be granted by
a judge in any one kind of case?

How does the appellate court

decide which alternative to impose?
MR, HIPLCR:

One alternative, or one possibility,

would clearly be if the prosecution could not further educe
any evidence at a subsequent trial.

Then, of course, it

would be senseless —*
QUESTION:

Anything other than what was already

in the record.
MR, HIPLER.

Right.

For example, a possession of

27

drugs case which are very common* where the Florida Supreme
Court has discharged a defendant because -«* and constructive
possession cases* of course* a proof did not show the answer
or knowledge of the defendant*

That would be one situation

where there would be no further proof*
QUESTION:

Coes that mean, Mr. Hipler, that we read

the interest of justice language to. mean that where the
prosecutor represents that if he is given a second try he can
come forward with more evidence than he had the first time?
MR, HXPLER:

No, Your Honor*

I think the cases

decided by this Court would not permit that.

The interest of

justice does indicate, as well as the concurring opinion as
attributed by the remainder of the justices, that under Florida
Appellate Rule 6.16(b), in light of the fact that it was a
murder conviction and a death penalty case, and in light of the
fact that the weight of the evidence was weak, then the
appellate court can go ahead and reverse for e new trial.
QUESTION;

I thought you told me that the only

reason for a new trial would be the supposition that the
prosecutor had new evidence.
MR* HIPLER:

No, Your Honor, that was one of the —»

No, No, I said that the prosecutor could not further educe
any evidence, then it would be senseless to go ahead and order
a new trial.

If all the evidence is in the court's records,

it would be senseless to reverse for a new' trial for failure to

■28

produce any further evidence.
QUESTION:

Then there would be no re-trial.

Are your answers to Justice Stevens'

questions based on statements made by the Supreme Court of
Florida or by your own observations as to what would be a good
legal system?
MR» HIPLDR:

I would, by my observations, as to

the way the Florida Supreme Court has been operating -- I have
a sufficiency of the evidence case.

I didn't think it would be

required to show this Honorable Court that where there is no
further proof that could be educed at a subsequent trial, as to
possession of drugs, then the defendant was, indeed, discharged.
That has occurred in Florida.
By the same token, I would ask this Court to take
notice of the 6.16(b) which goes ahead and reviews the suf­
ficiency of the evidence in favor of the defendant, regardless
of the fact of whether or not the defendant raised that on
appeal.

In other words, he may not even raise it, and the

•supreme Court goes ahead and does it, and 1 would think that
that would even be going beyond anything, of course, that
the — the Double Jeopardy Clause or anything the Constitution
would require; to go ahead and dc that, even despite *—
QUESTION:

Mr. Hipler, am I correct in assuming that

more evidence was produced at the second trial?
MR. HIPLER:

Your Honor, I don't know where

Mr* Chandler, Petitioner's attorney, got that,

I don't

29

The record Is, of course, devoid of what was produced in the
second
QUESTION:

Well, would you be arguing if the exact

same testimony was in both trials?

Would you be arguing no

double jeopardy?
MR* HIPLER:

Your Honor, I would be arguing that if

the exact same testimony would be produced that it would not
be double jeopardy,
QUESTION:
MR» HIPLER:

VJhy not?
Your Honor, the fact remains that in

a sufficiency of evidence
QUESTION:

That the state is entitled to two

different juries?
MR, HIPLER:

No, that the defendant is entitled to

two different juries, where the weight is weak.

That's the

point, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

If the Supreme Court said that this is

not enough evidence to convict a man of first degree murder,
and then he is tried with the exact same evidence, that
wouldn't be double jeopardy?
MR, HIPLER:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, I take issue —
Don't you have to get a little more

evidence?
MR. HIPLER;

Your Honor, there are cases which are

close, where the death penalty has been invoked, where it would

30

see;®, proper and just to remand for a new trial to give another
jury an opportunity to consider the same evidence, or whatever
evidence they could produce.
That's what I am saying.

That's what happened in this case.

There is nothing improper about that,

despite the insufficiency of the evidence.

I've relied, If

Your Honors please, on a concurring opinion by the Justices
which indicates that the reason for the reversal, whatever the
words that were used by the per curiam which indicates that the
real reason had to do with an Improper admission of hearsay
evidence.

Hearsay is not substantive evidence in Florida, .

unless it would fall into an exception, and it did not fall
into an exception here,

So there had been more of a procedural

error than a substantive, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

What you are arguing is that it wasn’t

just the insufficiency of evidence.

There was also an error

involved .
MR. HIPLiiR:
suggesting.

Yes, Your Honor, that’s what I am

In reading the opinion, it goes ahead and elaborates

on the point.
QUESTION:

Would your position remain the same if

the appellate court had said —> not only said what it said,
that the evidence was insufficient to prove guilty on a
reasonable doubt, but they went right ahead and said the
motion for acquittal should have been granted, but nevertheless
we will order a new trial?

31
As far as double jeopardy is concerned, you would
make the same argument?
MR, HIPLER:

I would argue that, but 1 think that

if they said that the judgment of acquittal should have been
granted, that would certainly weaken the prosecution's case.
QUESTION:

They said all but that,

MR, HIPLER;
said all but that.

Your Honor, X don't concede that they

They said that the interests of justice

require a new trial, despite the sufficiency of the evidence.
That's what they said, if Your Honor please.
Cases in Florida do discharge defendant.

I certainly

could have cited some, and I could if Your Honors would cesire
me to, But in murder convictions, as in this case, it seems
to me that a defendant, indeed, gets two cracks, as he did
here, if Your Honors please,
QUESTION:

That's what X am suggesting.

Is this what the Florida court said:

"We are of the view that the evidence was definitely lacking
in establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that; the defendants
committed murder in the first degree'1?
MR. HIPLER:

Yes, sir.

Technically, that's what

they said, yes.
QUESTION.:
way.

Technically and actually and every other

That's what they said,and does it follow from that that

the motion for acquittal should have been granted?
MR, HIPLER:

No. Your Honor

If it would have been

32

granted or should have been granted, I am confident if the
state had not made out a prima facie ease of guilt-, that it
probably would have been granted.

The words used, for example,

if 31 could just go off on aside, in a contract action, you
look to the intent of the parties, not necessarily what the
words are.

You look behind the scenes and that's what Irve

done in this situation, as well as the Fifth Circuit and U.S,
District Court,

For example, U. S, v, Wiley suggests that

no matter what the words used by an appellate court it would
not be improper to re-try the defendant and not be a violation
of double jeopardy if the weight of the evidence was weak.
I would suggest that that is what the Florida Supreme
Court said here,
QUESTION:

I thought they said it was insufficient

to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
MR. HIPIER:

Yes. sir, that’s what the words that

vrcre used by the Florida Supreme Court said,
QUESTION:

Could the court, on its own, enter a

judgment of guilt for second degree, as a lesser included
offense?
MR0 HXPLER:

Your Honor, there Is a statute that

provides for that in Florida, that does go ahead and do that.
QUESTION:

That would be fine if they were going to

re-try him for second degree murder.
for first degree.

They would be trying him

anything else»
MR, HIPLER:
murder,

Enter a Judgment for second degree

Yes, there is a Florida statute that allows that,

924.30.
QUESTION:

Failure to do so here should lead to what

analysis?
MR, HIPLER:

Your Honor, failure to do so here,

the conclusion is that they felt that the weight of the
evidence was weak and that the state
QUESTION:
MR, HIPLER:

Weak on first degree murder.
Enough to get by a jury, but because of

the death penalty being invoked and because of the conviction
for murder in the first degree, that the interests of justice
required a new trial,

I would suggest that Wiley v, UJ5.

would favor our position and the Government has relied upon
that in; its brief.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hipler, do you take the view that

Florida has a category of cases in which the evidence is in­
sufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, unless
24 jurors unanimously agree that it is not?
MR, HIPLER:

Is that the rule?

No, Your Honor, I do not.

I take the

view that where evidence is technically sufficient to get to

34
a jury
QUESTION:

And 12 jurors convict,

MR, HIPLER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,
That's not enough, but if 24 jurors

convict on the same evidence, then It is enough,
MR, HJPLiiR:

Your Honor, what I am suggesting is that

where the evidence, as in this situation, was enough to get by
a motion for judgment of acquittal and a motion for a new trial,
that the Florida Supreme Court, for the three, said, "We are
going to give this defendant another chance, and if the state
produced the same evidence and the jury comes back guilty, then.
Indeed, the defendants were guilty."

That's what I am sug­

gesting.
Now, I also submit and vigorously argue that there
is nothing inconsistent with the Double Jeopardy Clause to
preclude that, to give a defendant, so-called, two times,
QUESTION:

Just what the Double Jeopardy Clause

prohibits, doesn't it?
MR. HIPLER:
QUESTION:

That's correct, unless, of course —
It depends on one's point of view at what

stage one might want two cracks, but at a later stage he
might insist, as he does now, on only one.
MR. HIPLER:
QUESTION:

Well —
Well, it prohibits the state from having

two cracks, not the defendant from having two cracks.

MR, HIPLER:

Right.

QUESTION:

Okay, that's the point also.

If, indeed,

What's your hypothesis as to why the

court did not enter, on its own motion, a judgment of murder
in the second degree, given their statements that have been
read to you?

Because it felt that if it had entered

a judgment for murder In the second degree, I would think,
first of all, that would have been the end of the case and,
of course ~~

QUESTION:

Isn't it entirely possible that the

defense theory was that it was seme other person entirely.
There was an alibi, or something like that, so either he was
guilty of first degree murder or nothing.
MR» HXPLBR:

Well, Your Honor, that may be the case,

but there is nothing in this record to show that.
QUESTION:

There is nothing in the record to show

that it would have been appropriate to enter a second degree
murder conviction, is there?
MR. HIPLER:

Well, Your Honor, that may be true, but

it is not the duty of the Appellee to make all this record
part of the court.

We were never ordered —
j

QUESTION:

But we cannot decide the case on the

assumption that the record would support a second degree
murder conviction, can we?

Because the record simply does not

tell us.
MR0 HIPLER:

Yes, sir, the court went ahead and

reversed, basically, on a murder in the first degree conviction.
I -would submit that Your Honors, please, to go on,
t

that a case that is even more compelling where the state or
the prosecution did go ahead and have one opportunity to test
this case in front of a trial jury, U.,S, v. Sanford and Peres,
and in those situations, the jury, indeed, came back with
nothing.

If the logic the Petitioner wants applied by this

Court would apply, and this Court would adopt it, it would seem

37
to me in those situations where the prosecution had one
opportunity, that the jury came back not guilty.
jury went ahead and came back guilty.

Here the

So 1 would think it is

more compelling to go ahead and preclude the prosecution from
re-trying where a jury doesn't come back at ©11.
is one factor this Court should consider.

That, again,

And, indeed, when

the jury does come back guilty, there is nothing typical in
appellate court to go ahead and reverse.
I have argued that,from the totality of the evidence,
we feel that there is nothing improper ©bout going ahead and
reversing for a new trial.

Also, we feel that the policy

arguments, as in this situation, where there is intertwined a
legal and factual issue, use of the hearsay in Florida, the
Van Gal Ian case which is cited by the concurring; opinion, by
the Florida Supreme Court Justice Irvin, where the questions
of law., and fact are mixed.

And those situations, it would seem

to me that it would not be Improper in such situat5.ons to go
ahead and grant the re-trial.

For example, the hearsay, being

considered as substantive, rather than for impeachment purposes
only.

So, it is not really easy to come down with a hard and

fast rule.
I would also submit as a policy reason for this
Court to consider that if, indeed, this Court feels that there
is a hard and fast rule, an either-or proposition, while I have
no evidence to back me up, and I don't think anyone does, if

an appellate court, as in this situation, feels that the
evidence is technically sufficient to go ahead and affirm,
if this Court does, indeed, hold that insufficient evidence
means what it says without going behind the scenes, then I
wouid think that in close cases where the defendant would be
benefited by re-trial what would happen is that the appellate
court may, indeed, take the way out and say leave this to
the province of the jury,rather than going ahead and giving
the defendant a new trial.
QlMiTION:

Do you think we should look at this

decision of the state court as saying, "If we had to affirm
or reverse this conviction, we would affirm, but we prefer
to order a new trial"?
MR, HIPLhR:

Yes, Your Honor,

I would suggest that,

that the court could have affirmed and, indeed, three justices
would have gone ahead.

But, again, in capital cases or in

death penalty cases, Florida does go ahead and give the
defendant another opportunity to test the state's case.
QUfcibT.loN:

To adopt your theory, is it not almost

necessary to carve out a new category of case where the
evidence is too strong to let the man off, so an appellate
court thinks, but not' quite strong enough to affirm the
conviction, falling between the two alternatives Justice White
posed?
MS, HIPDiiR:

Your Honor, I would suggest that there

39
are times when there is more than enough evidence for a jury
to convict and the appellate court could go ahead and affirm,
but it feels that because the weight is weak that, indeed, the
defendant may very well be able to have the opportunity to test
the prosecution’s case again, that there are times where it has
been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

But, in such situations,

the Interests of justice do, indeed, require or permit the
appellate court to -QUESTION:
require that?

Why do you say the interests of justice

If there is enough evidence to support the

conviction, why is it not the duty of the appellate court to
affirm?

Why is it acting lawlessly when it says, well, it

a close case, I think maybe it's a nice defendant, or some­
thing, 1 think Ifll give him another trial?

Why should an

appellate court ever do that?
MR* HIPEER:

Because, Your Honor, there is a certain

amount of discretion invested in appellate courts that -QUESTION:

. discretion of that kind?.

Where do you

find any opinion saying there is discretion of that kind in
an appellate court?
MR* HIPLER: • The fact remains that many appellate
courts have used the Federal Statute 2106 to go ahead anti
remand for the trial court and, on the other hand, other
appellate courts have gone ahead and affirmed.
QUESTION:

That isn’t my question.

Bo you know of

40

any opinion of an appellate court saying that even though we
think the evidence was sufficient to go to the jury, neverthe­
less, in the interests of justice, we will order a new trial
because we think maybe the defendant will win the second trial?
That'© really what you are arguing and that, it seems to me,
you are arguing for lawless behavior by an appellate court.
MR* HXRLJR:

1 would submit, Your honor, it would

be, you know, lawless behavior if there is some type of hard
and fast rule.

Again, there is just not anything improper,

it seems to me, with allowing an appellate court to go.ahead
and reverse on such grounds.
QUi&iTXQN:

,0o you agree with your opposing counsel

that a trial judge in Florida is faced with very much that
inquiry every time he is confronted with a motion for a new
trial and a motion for judgment,

M.O*v*,

after the jury has

brought in a verdict of guilty?
MR, HIPLRR:

According to the Criminal Rule 3.600,

siderations by the trial judge.

proof, it would be encumbent, if a failure by the state or the
prosecution to make a prima facie case, then, indeed, in those
situations that it would be the duty of the appellate court to
go ahead and reverse.
QUiSSTION:

That's what he said, didn't he?
MR. HI PL. 3:

That's what the court said with the

concurring opinion joined in by the justices.

it meant?
MR. HIPLiSR:

No, Your Honor, . I am;saying it didn't.

That's what the Supreme Court said, but that's not necessarily

b2

all the considerations that went into play.

Again,, I

vigorously argue that, Your Honor, in this Honorable Court,
that you can go behind what a court uses, for example, like in
a contract claim or contract issue.

X vigorously argue that

to this Court, there is nothing improper or unconstitutional
in such a situation.

Even the most liberal court, or one of

I am saying let the word be used.

I'm stuck with.

I

That's what

I don't know whether you are, but that's what

I lm. stuck with,
MR. HIPLER:

Yes, sir, but I am saying that where

the weight of the evidence is weak, there is nothing to pre­
clude a re-trial.

That's basically what our position is,

and, of course, the legal and factual issues, there should be
no hard and fast rule,

Also, if Your Honors please, I would

say that where defendant goes ahead and moves for a new trial,
where he maintains control of the situation as the defense
counsel did in the trial court here, where he wont ahead and
moved for a new trial, in such a situation where I've analogized
that not exactly to motion for a mistrial, rather in a sense
where he requests a particular relief.

And I would submit that

in a sense U»S „ v. Dinitz and U.h,; v. Lee do, indeed, support

44
the contention that where defense requests a certain relief,
as defense counsel did in the trial court here, there is
nothing to preclude an appellate court or a trial court to
go ahead and grant the defendant exactly what he requested.
That's also what I am saying and there are, of course, good
policy reasons for that which is that fcftevburden is on defense
counsel to go ahead and request certain types of relief, as
again, a motion for mistrial and examples of that nature.
If Your Honors please, that's basically the state's
position as supplemented by the briefs.
If I have a few minutes, I'd like to basically just
argue our utone proposition.

There was no petition for

certiorari, or whatever, filed by the state but this Court,
I believe, does have power to go ahead and look at the issue.
After 4wain v. Pressley, the District of Columbia statute goes
ahead and holds that it's no suspension of so-called writ of
habeas corpus to go ahead and preclude a defendant from having
his sentence and judgment reviewed ultimately by an appellate
court and the Constitution, of course, does not mandate more
clan one appeal.

Indeed, it doesn't even mandate one appeal,

according to some of the recent Indications by this Honorable
Court.
I would also submit that 2254(d) requires Petitioner
to go ahead and allege that there is some kind of deficiency
in the state proceedings.

That was not done in the case at bar.

45
I would submit that there is, obviously, a presumption of
correctness.
Also, 2254(e) says that where the evidence is ample,
that the burden and the duty is on the applicant to go ahead
and submit the transcripts and the trial proceedings.
wasn't done here.

That

And, again, it is not the duty of the

Appellee* -if Your Honors please, to go ahead and submit this
material to the trial court, or whatever.

That's as to the

Stone issue.
If Your Honors have any questions, I'll be pleased
to answer them.

Otherwise, I would say that the Double

Jeopardy Clause has invaluably been read by this Court to be
a balancing of the equities in situations.
I would submit, if Your Honors please, that the
policy arguments that I've argued here and in my brief do
allow an appellate court in the interests of justice to go
ahead and reverse for a new trial,
QUESTION:

On page 29 of your brief, you cite a

good many statutes from various states as seeming to authorize
re-trial after a finding by an appellate court if the
evidence is insufficient,
MRa HIPLEH:

They use the exact same words, almost

MR, HIPLBR:

Because in a similar vein, the Federal

Statute allows- it and has repeatedly allowed it, so I would
think it would necessarily follow that the states would be
able to do t ha t a is o.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OP JOHN T. CHANDLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE PETITIONER
MR, CHANDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
On the last point, about the similar state rules and
statutes, it is very clear, you can look at some of those on
the list and you will find Arizona, New Mexico and North
Carolina listed among them.

Those states have case law to the

contrary that you cannot re-try a man if the appellate court
finds the evidence Insufficient,

Those cases, I believe, are

cited in my brief.
The state's conclusion that there is a possibility
that the evidence is technically sufficient but the weight of
the evidence requires a new trial, this proposition is not
allowed in Florida, the weight of the evidence is the province
of the jury.
QUESTION:

How about the trial court?

You can urge

I suspect, perhaps,, I'm not the only one -- 1 thought both you
and your opponent agreed that a Florida trial judge, after a
jury has brought in a verdict of guilty in a criminal case,
could have presented to him a motion for judgment, N.O.V.,
which would mean he enters a judgment of acquittal, or a motion
for mistrial,

Then there are two separate
One is against the weight of

the evidence and the other is total insufficiency of the
evidence,
MR, CHANDLER:

There may be inherent in this whole

idea two separate concepts of the evidence, but what we have .
here is the Florida Supreme Court saying that an appellate
court, for instance, which is ruling on what the trial court
did, in State v, Smith, 249 Southern Second 16, saying the
position that the state is arguing here doesn't exist in
Florida, that the jury, if the evidence is sufficient, that the
appellate court must affirm, and that the only time that the
appellate court does not affirm is when the evidence is not
sufficient as a matter of law to prove the crime charged,beyond
a reasonable doubt.

And they reversed.

QUESTION:

Is a trial court refusal to grant a motion

for a new trial appealable under Florida law?
MR, CHANDLER:

Your Honor, I can only say I believe

What grounds does the appellate court-

use for reviewing that?

Yes.

Thank you, gentlemen.
