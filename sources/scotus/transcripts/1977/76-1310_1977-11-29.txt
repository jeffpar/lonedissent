MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

we will hear arguments

next in Houchins against KQED, No. 76-1310.
Mr. Bootyr you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KELVIN H. BOOTY, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BOOTY:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief

Justice, may it. please the Court:
The question presented in this case is, Must the
sheriff give greater access to his county jail facility to
th® media than he gives to the public?

The purpose of the

access in this case is to gather information.
The District Court in this cases required that
certain access ba given to tha modi®.

There was no require­

ment that similar access be given to the public, and there
was no determination by the District Court that the public
access was iradequate in any way..
The required media access is, as I say, greater than
the sheriff gives to the public.

I would ilka to discuss

examination of the situation at the time the lawsuit was
brought?

Should you not tell us what kind of access there

was when the proceeding started?
MR. BOOTY:

Yes, Your Honor.

The require­

ment is that consent previously be obtained from the inmate
himself, from his counsel, from the District Attorney, and
from the court having jurisdiction over the trial.
What was not present at the time the proceedings
commenced were the tours.
Appendix, page 10.

However, as—I believe it is at

1 beg your pardon, page 19 of the Appendix.

I am reading from the affidavit of Mr. Turner, who was counsel
for the plaintiffs then and now, is on June 10, a week before
the proceedings wer® filed, he spoke again with
him about the tours.

ms, and I told

So, for the situation at the time the

proceedings commenced was that the tours were planned and
scheduled, and it was well known to everyone, including these
plaintiffs, they in fact would begin.
It is true that they have not begun.

It was
/

necessary for the sheriff to secure funding from the board of

6
supervisors.

He had to go—in a bureaucracy those things

take time, unfortunately.

We cannot just spring

to

action.

The tours cover, as the record shews, virtually the
entire facility.

There is no screening of any visitors.

The

record indicates that many of the. places are just taken by
ordinary citizens, people who out of curiosity want to know
what is going on in the jail.

The tour does not see any

inraai.es. No inmates are—I have got to ba specific on that.
You certainly might see them.

You do not. talk to them.

There

is no communication between inmates and the members of the
tour.

The tour is—-at that time were 25 persons.

There are

now approximately 30, and there is only four guards.

So,

plainly convexsation between inmates and visitors is
impossible.
No cameras are permitted on the tours, and no tape
recorders are permitted on the tours.
Q

What opportunity do members of the media have

to become one of the 25 admitted on these tours?
MR„ BOOTYs

They had at the commencement of the

tours, Your Honor, better access than anyone else because the
announcement of the tours was macie through the media.

There

was in fact a suggestion by some of the members of the board
of supervisors that the first tours should be set aside
entirely for the media.

And that suggestion was rejected on

the grounds that if they wanted to go, they knew about it before

7
.anyone else.
Q

So, all they had to do was file.
Basically the tours were organised on a first

corae, first served basis?
MR. BOOTY:
Q

Exactly.

They were and are.

And did on® of the briefs or the records state

tli© opinion that they were overbooked some weeks in advance?
MR. BOOTY:

The first six months of the tours

became booked very quickly,
July.

quite possibly before the end of

The first tour was on July 14, 1975.

before the—I do not remember.

And probably

My recollection, Your Honor,

is that before the end of July the tours had been booked.

Q

So, if there were some occurrence in the jail

that might have been of public interest, there would be no way
for a representative of the media to get into the jail unless
he had been signed up several weeks in advance?
MR. BOOTY:

That, is correct.

H© could not have gone

on on© of the tours.

That of course is not the onl’’ means of

access, Your Honor,

Had there been an. occurrence in the jail,

indeed before the tours ever started, the media can and does
have alternata means of finding out. what is going on, by means
of interviews•

2 have net completed that is now and was then

available to the media.
Q

You are still outlining access that was

available?
MR. BOOTY:

To the public.

This is what became

8

available to the public,,

The media has then and now greater

access than the public.
Q

It has in addition -to these rights of the public

additional rights?
HR. BOOTY:

Yes, Your Honor, that is what I am

saying.
Q

Additional rights may be the wrong word.

In

any event, under the existing regime the media has all the same
rights that the public has of access.
MR. BOOTY:
Q

Yes, exactly.

Plus some additional ones that have been

granted to it by the sheriff's office.
MR. BOOTY:
Q

That is right, Your Honor.

Mr. Booty, you have been outlining what I

gather are general policies of the sheriff’s office.
these designed to cover the situation.

Are

Supposing a riot had

broken out in the jail or some event of particular newsworthiness, would these regulations have necessarily governed
press or public access under those circumstances?
MR. BOOTY:

Yes, it would.

There is nothing in the

record in the case, Your Honor, to indicate any alternative
means—as I say I am not finished.

But this access package,

taken as a whole, is the entire package.

So, if there had

b-csan a riot or a fire or scmethirg like that, then t.ha means
of access for the media are through alternative means such as

9
interviews or something of that nature. not the capacity to go
in with their cameras, at least on demand.
\

I do want to gat into one specific media access that,
the media alone has, and that is special tours with the cameras
and with tapes on a scheduled basis.
demand but on a scheduled basis.

That is critical, not on

There is no fixed schedule

the District Court had in mind, and as it turned out there
was no schedule promulgated.
willing to do that.

But the sheriff was still

That is part of it.

And of course

finally the release bus to contact inmates.
All right, that completes, Your Honors, the access
that exists.

The complaint of KQED with respect to this is

that there is no random interviews on the tours, no inmates
are on view for their cameras in cells or barracks or eating
for televising, and that there is no access cm demand for their
equipment.»

As I have just indicated, there is access

with

their equipment on a scheduled basis but not on demand.
The District Court, did not make any finding of any
intention to conceal conditions in. the jail.

But nevertheless

the District Court made its injunction, which requires the
sheriff to allow what it called

full and accurate news

coverage and specifically required the sheriff to permit
random interviews on the tours and to permit the use of
cameras and tapes and plainly not on a scheduled tour but; on a
demand tour.

10

The only exception stated in the District Court’s
memorandum and injunction was that when tensions in fact
existed, the sheriff would put a stop to it, a stop to the
access.

In fact, the District Court virtually invited

litigation on the point because it says if anybody thinks
there really is not tension, they can come in and we will have
a hearing on that.
So, what the District Court did then is it balanced
the asserted media needs against the sheriff's public access
program.

There was no balancing by the District Court of the

public's rights in any way,

The District Court did not

address the public rights in any way.
Q

When you say the public right, are you talking

about some term that has meaning in constitutional law?
MR, BOOTYs

Yes, 1 think I am.

I think the. public

does have some rights of access.
Q

Is th«s sheriff of Alameda County an elected

official?
MR. BOOTY:
Q

Yes,- Your Honor, he is.

And I presume if the public in Alameda County

thought that they were not getting enough access, they could
vote against him in the next election.
MR. BOOTY:
Q
have?

Ho question about it.

And what other right of access does the public

11
MR. BOOTY:
Q

How does one-—

I mean, say under the decided cases of this

Court.
MR. BOOTY:

That is—-

Q

Under the Constitution of the United States.

Q

As interpreted by this Court, which may be a

different thing.
MR. BOOTY:

Well, it is not entirely clear.

case what the Court did, as I read it in any

In the

case, is

the Court found that there was no intention to conceal any
condition.

The Court found that there was public access. And

that was enough, those two factors.

There was plainly nothing

be swept under the rug, nothing being hidden.

The Court

determined that tba public access was there adequate.

That

was th© statement of the Court.
Now, I appreciate—and the reason I hesitate,
Mr. Justice Rehiiquist--! appreciate that the public access in
tiiat case- was not, strictly speaking, an issue, just as it
was not placed in issue hera.
Q

Was net Pell really a decision that said

whatever the public access is, the media access need be no
greater?
MR. BOOTY:
said.

Indeed, that is exactly what the Court

But X do not read the decision as saying that that

means necessarily that the public access is zero.

That is not

12

resolved in any decision of this Court that I am aware of.
It was not placed in issue in that case.
Q

That is my point.

More specifically, Mr. Booty, you do not

seriously contend that the whole problem could be solved by
having zero access to public and press both.
ME. BOOTY:
Q

Certainly not.

Why do you not?

That is a perfectly logical

position to take.
Q

This is whether it is a correct position.

It

is logical, all right.
MR. BOOTY:

It is a logical position, Your Honors,

but it is not our position,

I am not convinced, considering

the body that I am speaking to, I. am not convinced that that
is what the Court held in Pell.
Q

What the Court held in Pell was, as I under­

stood it in writing it, war- that the press had no right of
access superior to that of the general public,
MR. BOOTY:
Q

Absolutely.

Wo question about it.

It did not deal with whether the general public

had any right whatsoever.
Q

That is under the Constitution, the First and

Fourteenth Amendments or any other provision of that

?
document.
MR. BOOTY:

That, is exactly my position too, Your

Honor, it was not dealt with.

The Court did not hav2 to deal

13
with it, and I have been asked did it, and I do not. think that
it did.
Q

You would not urge the Court to taka that

extreme position, would you?
MR. BOOTY:
our position.

No, I am not urging that.

In the first place, Your Honor, with respect,

that is not before you.
Court.

That is not

It was not; tried in the District

We urged that that was the issue.

Quit position in

the District Court was the extent of the public access should
he measured, and that automatically, if you will, sets the
madia's access rights.

But that is not. what was tried, and

that is not what the District Court did.
KQED’s position in the District Court, which the
District Court adopted, was that we have to-have special
things for the media.

It was tried as a media access case,

not as a public access case.
I want to emphasise one other thing.

Access, if you

road the District Court’s opinion, is mainly something about
tours, and access la more than tours.
access is mail.

Access is visitation?

This Court h®3 said some strong' things about

mail rights in prisons.

For instance, in Proouniar v,

Martinos the Court said you cannot do censoring without a lot
of due process protection.

There may well be a right to have

visits, particularly if in—as we are.

We are a county jail.

Half of our inmates are pretrial detainees.

They -have special

14
rights which might not appertain to an entirely convict
population»
Q

Mr. Moody, can 1' ask one other question about

the access at the time the lawsuit started.
was visiting.

One of the points

People could visit prisoners or inmates that

they requested.
MR, BOOTY:
Q
they had.

Yes, Your

Honor.

Does the record tell us the scope of the visit
ir other words, could the visitor—what could the

visitor see?

Does the record tell?

MR. BOOTY:

No, the record does not tell you.

As I

recall it, tbs visiting is in—well» I do not want to go
outside the record.

It does not tell you.

It is not the smite

thing as a tour.
Q

Does the record—of course, I do not question

your statement, but doss the record tell us that there was
visiting before the—
MR. BOOTY:
Q

Oh, yes, it does

It does tell us that?

MR. BOOTY:

Yes, it, does tell you that, Your Honor.

For instance, in Appendix page 41—and I believe
tills is dealing with the minimum security inmates who had
visiting only on Sundays, there is greater visiting for the
pretrial detainees.

We wore under some orders from the

District Court—a different; judge, Judge Zirpoli—on visiting,

15
and so we have greater visiting for pretrial detainees»
Q

That page does tell us something about the

nature of the visiting rights.

It tells us they will be in

the barracks—in the auditorium rather t and they wait in the
barracks.

It implies that they will not have unrestricted

access to the entire facility.
MR. BOOTY:

Yes, that is correct.

I perhaps misunderstood the Court1s question.

Q

on

It

any more than this.

It doss indicate there is no physical contact

between the visitor and the inmate.

Does that mean they talk

through a glass window?
MR. BOOTY:

In. the maximum security facility that

is 'the case at present.

It is not indicated here? it is ray

understanding there is not glass and telephones.

This is

across the table.
Q

I see,

MR, BOOTYs

So, it seens to me we cornu now to what

X consider to be the legal issue, which is in a situation
where the adequacy of the public rights

to access are

unchallenged, and there is no determination of any intention
to conceal once ths sheriff gave access rights greater to the
madia than he gives to the public.

And we have, in our briefs,

cited the cases back approximately 20 years, all to the same
effect, which is that the press has no greater rights than dees

16

the public to gather information.
rights.

We are talking about access

The two latest cases from this Court which i» our view

are controlling are the Pell case and the Saxbe case, to which
we have referred, and the issue in each case there was, Did
interviews by the media with specifically named inmates have
to be granted when it was not available to the general public?
And the Court held in each case that they did not.

The

Court applied the general rule which we have stated, which is
that the press has no greater rights.

And since the public

did not have the right to interview specifically named
inmates, the press need not be given it either.
It is true that in both cases the media had greater
access than did the public,,

They had the right to interview

those encountered randomly or the course of the tours, for
instance.

And from this KQED argues that because this greater

media access in fact existed in that case, tha Court held that
it was constitutionally compelled.

But when that, greater

media access was not an issue—-and it was not, it was merely
an existing situation--there was not any controversy about it,
it was net placed in issue by any litigant.

There was nothing

to decide, nothing to resolve, and hence in our view there is
no such holding as contended by KQED,
Q

Did you say earlier in your argument that the

sheriff was now willing to or has been willing to give the
press greater access then the public?

17
MR. BOOTY;
Honor.

He doss and has in two respects, Your

He gives the press tours with their cameras and with

their tape recorders.
Q

You say that is critical to your case?

Is that

the word you said?
MR. BOOTY;
Q

No, Your Honor.

I might have.

You do not mean, it?

MR. BOOTY;

I do not mean that, if I said that.

It

is not critical.
C

It is wholly inconsistent with your present

argument, if it. were critical.
MR. BOOTY:

It is not critical.

It is a fact that

just as in Pell and Saxbe—■
Q

But according to your present argument, you

could eliminate that special privilege to the press.
MR. BOOTY:
Q

Yes, Your Honor, that is correct.

Could you te11 me where in your brief you

describe the special press privilege?

is it in your opening

brief?

MR. BOOTY;
Q

I believe so.

My other question is, If some member of the

public, non-press member, said, ’''We would like to go with the
press tour,1’ what would you say?
MR. BOOTY:

Q

That would have been denied.

Because the public does not have as much right

18
as the press?

MR. BOOTY;
whether that, is right.

Yes, that is right.

Well, 3' do not know

That was the sheriff's policy.

The

sheriff's policy is that, this is something especially fox fchs
madia.
Q

What if £ private parson wanted to go with the

press tcur with his cameras and he sued, what would you say?
Would you. say you are not required to give him equal access
with the press—in short, that the press has a greater
privilege; is that what you ere saying?

Well, anyway, where do you describe that, or do you?
MR. BOOTY:
Q

I will find it.

All right.

MR. BOOTY;

I will reserve the rest of my time for

rebuttal.

Q

Thank you.

MR. BOOTY;

Thank you.

First off, I would like to correct the

been in office, held a special tour for the press.
nothing in the record to support it.

There is

All he said when it

became clear at the evidentiary hearing in this case is that
he would be willing if the Court was going to grant preliminar
injunctive relief to live with a special tour for the press
in which they could bring their cameras and do their business
in that way.

ns has never implemented that offer.

And in

context that offer was only to bs carried out. if the Court was
going to order him to do anything more than he was otherwise
willing to do,
Q

Do you think as a matter of'prison or jail

administration tha director or sheriff could say it is more
convenient to hu&p these two categories separate.that is,
w-3 will have general public visitation on the first Monday in
every month and we will h&vc* madia representatives on the
second Monday of every monti?
MR. TURNER:
Q

I think it is permissible—

As an administrative matter.

MR. TURNER:

—for an. administrator of a jail or a

prison to—
Q

1 p.y constitutional question involved in that

20

kind of decision?

Or is that just routine administration of

the institution?
MR» TURNER:

A constitutional question arises when,

as in this case, the sheriff limits access by reporters
either to zero, as before this case was filed, or to these
antiseptic guided tours that he initiated right after we
filed suit»
Q

There is a constitutional issue,
If he gives the media precisely as.d exactly the

same access as th© public, -do you think there is any
constitutional problem involved?
MR, TURNER:

I do if that access is zero or if the

access is not reasonably sufficient to prevent concealment of
conditions in the jail.

Then we would have situation, as they

have in South Africa, where the press is effectively precluded
from reporting on jail and prison conditions.
Q

What part of the Constitution do you draw on

to say that there Is a right of access to take pictures and do
these things?
MR. TURNER:

This is a First Amendment case.

X

thick it would trivialize the First Amendment to say that it
requires specific things like a particular number of days a
week or photographs or random interviews as opposed to full
interviews with individuals and so on,
what th© First Amendment does.

I do not think that is

What the First. Amendment does

is prohibit a government official from unjustifiably

21

interfering with the acquisition of information for publica­
tion, and that is what this case is about»
Q

When you say unjustifiably interfering with

acquisition of information for publication, then it is a
justiciable question in every case whether, for instance, the
Supreme Court of the United States excludes the press from
its conferences or whether the Federal Aviation Administration
excludes the pr@3s from its executive sessions?
MR,

turner £

I do not know about justiciable.
/

Q

Under your test, at any rat©, it is something

that is subject to constitutional inquiry by a court that can
decide constitutional questions whether the decision of any
governmental official to exclude the press from any part of
the public domain under his
MR. TURNER;

xol is, quoto, "justifiable"?

Yea, that is our position.

Our

position of course, is not that the press is entitled to sit in
on conferences of this Court, any court, any administrative
agency and so on.
Q

but only because that is a justifiable decision

on the part—
MR. TURNER;

Yes, and ihe information has some claim

to confidentiality.
Q

But in each case you could go into tha United

States District Court of whatever district you want to and
under 1331 arguo a constitutional question as to whether or not

22

the decision of the particular agency was justifiable.
MR. TURNER;

Theoretically, yea.

But. in fact there

are not any other agencies that we are aware of that treat
information the way this sheriff doss.

The evidence in this

case shows that the jails and prisons in the area are
completely open to the press, and they may enter and go into
the maximum security sections, talk with prisoners, inter­
view prisoners, take pictures, whatever they want to do.
Those are the institutions where, one would assume,public
access is rather limited and justifiably so.
Q

Let; us suppose the President decides to have

cabinet meetings open to the media with television and all the
ether instance, does that mean the courts have to open their
conferences because someone else does it?
MR. TURNER:
Q

No, of course not.

Then what significance is it that soma other

prisons in this area have a different practice?
MR. TURNER;

Because it, shows how unjustifiable

this sheriff's practice is, that there is no valid interest—
Q

If the President epens the cabinet meetings to

TV, then how could the United States Court of Appeals or the
Court of Claims have a justifiable reason for excluding TV?
MR. TURNER:

I do not know what the President's

reasons might be for opening cabinet meetings, but surely in
the context of a court, where there is deliberation going on,

23
'where there, has to be a freedom to take opposite points of
view than will ultimately be handed down in decision, that
kind of discussion just has to, by its very nature, be
confidential,
Q

Then suppose the United States Courts of

Appeals all decide to open their conferences to television.
Does that mean, all other courts have got to do it?

They are

engaged in the same kind of decisional function.
MR. TURNER:

I do not think that they would have to,

no.
Q

Then what someone else does is really not very

relevant, is it?
MR. TURNER:

It is only relevant to show how

unjustifiable this sheriff's practice is.

It is not disposi­

tive in the case of this Court or any other court where there
might be radically different considerations.
I would like to answer Mr. Justice .Stevens * opening
question about the state of access whan this suit was filed.
Tners, was none.

Until the suit was filed, conditions in this

jail were concealed from the public because the sheriff
completely excluded both press and public from the facility.
Q

There was, I orssums, access under the Sixth

and Fourteenth Amendments.
MR, TURNER:

An attorney could go and interview his

client in a visiting room.

24
Q

Q

At the time the suit was start3d, could a

member of the press interview a prisoner during visiting
hours If the prisoner was willing to be interviewed?
MR. TURNERs

The practice, as I understand it, was

that anybody could visit any prisoner.
Q

Including the press, the answer is yes?

MR. TURNER:

If you happen to know of somebody, you

could go out and ask for them? and if they were willing to talk
with you, you could talk with them in the visiting area.
Q

Haw about recording an interview with a willing

prisoner?
MR. TURNER;
Q

Ho, that would not have been permitted.

Or a photograph, a willing photograph..

25

MR. TURNER:

That would not have been permitted

unless reporters obtained the four consents mentioned by
counsel. -The prisoner himself—that is certainly reasonable.
His lawyer—that is certainly reasonable.

And the sheriff

required the consent of the District Attorney, for reasons
unknown to us and unexplained, and the court having jurisdic­
tion of the case.

This is not a gag rule problem.

This was

MR. TURNER:
Q

On visitorson visiting.

MR. TURNER:
Q

Same rule.,

Same ruleThat has not changed.

And the Court did not order it changed?

MR. TURNER s

No.

The only feasible way that the public at large will
know what is gcing on in this jail is if reporters are allowed
in.

A handful of people can go on ’'She tours.

But reporters

ats for the public at large—the ©yes and ears
of the public at large—-can go in and without any disruption
to jail routine, because it is done routinely ir. all of the
other jails and prisons in the area, can meet this public need
without interfering with any valid purpose of the sheriff.
Q

Would you say if the old-fashione'd system

that cjxistad at least, a century ago of having boards of

26
visitation who reported semiannually or quarterly to the
local governing body created and you had six citizens
designated by the mayor or by the court or by someone, who
made these visits regularly and reported publicly, would you
say that would satisfy the public’s right to—
MR. TURNER:

No, it would not, Mr. Chief Justice.

It would be helpful, but such a visiting board could only—
and where they do exist, do only—go on a very occasional
basis to the facility and do an inspection.
Q
times, the

I did not put any limit on it.

And, indeed, at

beginning of the Colonial days, these boards of

visitors visited such institutions just the way bank
examiners do- today, unannounced.
MR. TURNER:

if they wore charged with gathering

information about an event of public concern and were in a
position to go out to the jail and investigate, find out what
happened, report it to the public promptly, that would serve
the same purpose'.
Now, the sheriff in answering why should not the
court be allowed to do the job, the same job done in other
jails and prisons in the area, points to the Court’s
decisions in Pell and Saxfoe.

Anc, his cor a position is that all

ha needs to do is provide equality of access—not access but
equality is the way he reads those decisions.

Q

How do you read them?

21
MR, TURNER:

We think that the whole assumption of

the Pell and Saxbo decisions is that there be reasonably
sufficient access to prevent concealment of conditions.
•there is that, then equality is fine.

If

We do not claim any

superior rights for the press.
Q

You do claim, I suppose—you certainly coul®

reasonably claim—that even though the right of access of the
communications media is no greater than that of the

general

public , that perhaps because of the technical needs of the
communications media the equality needs to b© provided in a
different kind, of way.

In other words, let us say there is a

right under existing rules and regulations the public can go
through certain rooms of the White House within certain hours
every day.

The press could not set up its television

cameras 'then and there and interfere.
interfering with each other,

Then they each would bo.

But certainly there is an

equivalent availability to the communications media of the
same sort of guest access to those rooms in the White House
that are open to the public.

But that might require special

arrangements for you to make to set up your television
cameras or some tiling else at an hour when the public in fact
is not there just in order to preserve and provide the very
equality to which the media is entitled.
MR. TURNER;

Exactlv.

We have no quarrel with the Court's holdings in Pell

28
and Saxbe.

There was rather full access there.

Reporters

could enter the institutions, go to the maximum security
sections, talk with prisoners they randomly encountered, take
photographs.

The only thing they could not do, the only-

purpose for which access was denied, was to single out
individual prisoners and make media heroes out of them, have
them interviewed, have them come to public attention.

The

evidence in that case was that that indeed created security
problems, and the Court upheld that narrow restriction on
access.

But there was certainly sufficient access to prevent

concealment of conditions in that prison.
And we do' not have any quarrel either with the
broad, no-greater access statement of the Court in those
cases, provided that it is understood that there is sufficient
access to prevent concealment.
f

the fact; that, the public is not admitted at all, that the
press then must be?
MR. TURNER:
Q

Then what is your argument?

MR.. TURNER:
Q

No.

Well—

Let us assume in this particular county jail

the public was not admitted at all except in terms of—that
is, the general public.

Members of the families were and

lawyers were and doctors were.

But

the general public, no.

By that very fact, does the press then gain access?

That

seems to be your argument.
MR. TURNER:
Q

Yes, it is.

I do not understand that.

MR. TURNER:

That was the situation before this

case was filed.
Q

Y ss , it was.

I air. talking not about policy or

prudential considerations or wisdom or lack of it.

We are

tdiking about what is required by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments.
MR. TURNER:
Q

Yes.

Or else this case should not be here.

Why

then does the mere fact that the public does not have access
thereby confer a right upon the press to access?

That is a

brand new doctrine that X have never heard of.
MR. TURNER:

If both the press and public ware wholly

excluded, as they were before this case was filed—
Q

And as they are from many areas of public life,

of governmental life.

They are excluded from the War Room

MR. TURNER:
Q

Indeed, and should be.

Various parts of the CIA.

As has been pointed

out, various private meetings of all sorts of commissions and
courts and everything else.
MR. TURNER:

The difference between those kinds of

closed- institutions and this one axe two.

First, the

information which is being discussed in the CIA, the various
government agencies which you have mentioned, is; information
that properly should not be mad© public, while here what is
going on in this jail is information that has no claim to
confidentiality.
Q

How do you know what should properly be made

public and what has no claim to confidentiality under the
First and Fourteenth Amendments?
MR. TURNER:

There is no claim at all by the sheriff

that anything that happens in this jail should be held secret
from the public.
Q

But you have to make our your claim under the

First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.

So, when

you say that, something has no claim to confidentiality, that
must be a part of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

3!
Otherwise you cannot prevail.
MR. TURNER:

What I art saying is that w® do not

seek access to information that has any claim to confiden­
tiality.
Q

There may be other reasons that the public is

not given, access ©side from confidentiality, reasons of
security, of discipline, of the very fact is a jail is a jail.
i

MR. TURNER:

Indeed, to the extent that there is a

governmental, interest.

A commander of a military station could certainly

activities, I assume.
MR. TURNER:

Yes, ©f course.

When there is a

Q

Quits apart from confidentialityf just for

discipline and training the troops.
MR. TURNER:

Indeed, of course.

We concede that.

We believe that the proper test is the one that this Court
used in Martinez, before that in o8 Brian ? where there is a.
governmental, interest, whether the interest is confidentiality
of information or security, problems or some other important
governmental interest, of course access can be denied

Mr. Turner, in answer to Mr. Justice Stewart's

question about the difference between what you claim your

33
rights are her© and the interest in finding out what happens
in governmental conferences where there is secrecy arid the
like, you said there are two differences,

on© is there is an

absence of interest in confidentiality here, and there is an
interest, in confidentiality in these other cases.

But you

never got to your second point.
MR,, TURNER;

The second on© is that this is an

institution whose focus is the involuntary confinement of
people, with an opportunity for overreaching of liberties of
the people who are involuntarily confined, and very little
opportunity for that to coma to public knowledge unless
reporters are permitted in.

Do not each of those people have a right of

That is what you are asking, that

Or is your claim one

that excessive relief was granted?
MR. BOOTY;

It is our claim that under the District

Court's approach, no injunction was proper.

If someone had

tried to establish”—and it should be noted that there ware
privat® persons as parties in this ease who did not testify,
ili® NAACP plaintiffs.

If those, as representatives of the

public, had challenged our public access program, thesi it is
possible that thes District Court could have detorradned—
properly or improperly, X do not know—but could have
detemiinsd that feha public access program was adequate or not.
That was naver done.
