QUESTION:
MR. PRELO I

Interchangeably?
Yes , sir.

The Governor is the chief executive officer ©f the
Tribe and is empowered to run the day-to-day functions of the
irxDe primaraly, and he serves on the Councilr and can only
votea on the Council at such time as the Council may have a
tied vote.

The Council, under the constitution, has the

authority to determine membership in the Tribe„ end has thus
dona under the 1933 Ordinance0
The defendants in this case, Santa Clara Pueblo,

1939 Ordinance, is c. written embodiment of pre-existing

b.x&% whs tiler or not there's an impii, sd waiver of sovereign

MR. PRELOs

Undc.r the haesas corpus, Your Honor,

wa submit that there would be jurisdiction over the individual
that might datain any given —

QUESTION s

Even against the Governor, for example.

HR. PRELO:

The Act. states that it applies to

Tribes.
QUESTION:
MR. PRELO:

Yea.
It does not. say anything about the

*

executives.

The argument has been made that it would apply

to the Governor, And based on what I indicated a while ago,
rur Governor just n&s the power to run the day**to-day' affairs,
and has no power beyond that into the Council area.

So I

don't know what effect that would have.
QUESTIONs
MR. PRELO:

Yes„
If, as Your Honor pointed out, there is

jurisdiction, then we gat to the question of what standard of
equ&l protection should apply under the Indian Civil Rights
Act.

we have submitted, have argued consistently, that it is

gening -fees r«.i;r. hi© Fourteenth Amandment standard-, and
I*ns -'Sua admitted by the plamti-ffs at. th© early stages

much less?
MR. PRELOj

Speaking of -fee waiver of sovereign

immunity,it has been over 145 years, that, this Court held that
Tribes are sovereign nations, notwithstanding that they are
quasi-sovereign at this particular time? they still retain the
independent political sovereign that was found by ta© Court
over a, hundred years-ago.
Eighty-two years ago, at least, it has been recognised
that as sovereigns they are immune from suit in federal courts
unless Congress

end Congress has plenary power tc do so —

unless Congress enacts legislation saying that they can be
sued,

if their immunity is waived.
Such waiver has never been implied, and w«- submit

that it should not be at tills time.

It must be an express

waiver, and Congress must spell this out.
This Court, in the recent case of the Puyallup Tribe
of ff^hiagtan, decided just in June, -again reaffirmed the
common law principle of sovereign immunity.
The reasons for this principle that have been
printed out am twofolds

one is buoantie of the limited

resources of- -Aa Tribes to be constantly in court defending
■ . their way of living? and the other is so that
they nay continuo to perpetuate their culture v?ith out
into r:: sren

might point- out: that Phare

Civil Rights Act in the Ten A Circuit:, as pointed out by
amicue, j us t re ceatly.
QUESTION; What are the other Qlemnts besides
preservation of a particular culture that turn on this?
MR. PRELO: The elements are the preservation of the
culture, the pres rsrv&tio». of the tribal cohes'ivahess, the unit
of the Tribe, their religious beliefs, and, to some extent,
their economic holdings which are, as I’ve indicated, small.
It’s the over**all keeping of a Tribe that’s existed for years
that

this approach, going to bs destroyed.
QUESTION;

Well, the Anglo-Saxon adversary legal

system is qrjiru inconsisfe» with the tradition of many Indian
Tribes, isn’t it?
MR. PRBLO;

It is totally inconsiefesat, I would say,

Your Honor.
QUESTION;

But in so far so sovereign immunity goes,

trr.t. has historic roots s.a much as anything when, in -the
earlier years , she curlings of our country with the Indian.
Tribas were very simi far to th© dealings of our country with
the Gtrmiaem; of England or France.

And sovereign, immunity has its historic

roots in that concept of what Indian Nations were, and Indian

MR© PRELO:

Based on the more equal footing.

At

that tiro® theTrifoes were stronger, compared to what they ar©
today, as compared to th® United States.

And it was beneficial

to this country to make such Treaties or Agreements, and we
should continue to honor those.

MR. PRELOs

Going on, Your Honor, if there is a

wavier, it muat. he expressed and should not bs implied.
We were talking about the reasons for it,.

Again,

the plaintiffs have not told us how they would propose to
limit judgments to equitable relief and not have money
judgments.
*

The waiver also, I might point out, would have an
excessive workload for the courts, that the courts may not be
geared to, and its would do -*» unduly interfere with Tribal
law and order systems.
This was considered -*QUESTIONS

Well, part: of the argument is that the

Civil nights Act clearly intended to protect individuals
from Tribal Governments in some

respects.

MR. PRELOs

Thai is correct* Your Honor.

The jurisdictional issue, reliance has bean pie.cad
or

28 U.S.C. 1343(4).

I submit that this reliance is misplaced.

That requiras that the district court shall have jurisdiction
of any civil action authorised by laws to b© commenced; and
we submit teat nothing has been authorized in tee Civil Rights
Act. except habeas corpus.

And* an & result, reliance on this

is improper, ejnd teis Court has ruled in similar cases, under
the Tucker Act. and tee Administrative Procedure Act, in.

MR. PRELOi

It is my position that it would not be

I ssseu

MR* PRELO%

why?

Because I think the Act speaks to the

Tribe itself and not to an individual, and the Governor does
not have the requisite authority, in any ©vent, in tell the

become also involved, because the Governor does-not have the

No, it*s not clear what they meant.

As to the standard of equal protaction, it is clear
that this Court has consistently taken the approach that
Indians are sui generis and differant from any other body in

They’ve been treated with deference.

MR* PRELOj

TheJ; is correct:, Your Honor*

QUESTION;

A thousand and eighty, I guess.

MR. PRELOs

The cases below have hold basically

that; equal, even-handed application of the law is what should
be applied if it is in the Indian context.

If it is in the

Anglo-American context, then, they have in fact applied the
Fourteenth Amendment standards; and nothing could be more
Indian context than membership.

The Tenth Circuit- recognised

this, but proceeded to apply the compelling

compelling

test. They didn’t talk about rational or substantially further
important governmental objective? they said, they have shown
no coiope 1 ling interest *
I submit that this Court, not even in Frontiers,_v*.
Richardson or any other case, has agreed totally that the)
compelling intereat should be shewn in a gender type case.
I further submit 'diat the Court has retreated too some
axts&fc from that holding and now holds that they must show a
substantially furfiier important governmental objective, that
the Ordinance would do so.

And I submit that nothing could be

iror-s important than fee cultura aad th© actual existence of
th-a Triba, and that it clearly cones within the standard in
Craig v. Boren.

MR. CHIIF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Collins.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD B. COLLINS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. COLLINS;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court.:
One of mo basic disagreements between the partias
in this case has
•bribtv

& defendants' characterization of what

intarere io represented by this Ordinance that's at

issue Hssr©.

They hi. w said, t •? counsel just said at th© closa

of his argument, Hi at without this Ordinance the culture and
religion of S a&t« Clara world be lost and destroyed.
Ws submit that this cannot possibly be the case.
T»' -i* c.x>-rjx. below end the district court, iv. their
opinions, a.nch stated tliai; the Martinez children ar. culturally
l&ra Indians.

They found that to ba a fact.

That

24
finding .Is undisputed so far b a;.fore ?r i> Court.
Furthermore , that: finding is based on & number of

significant: subsidiary facts that ar@ also undisputed, that,
the- Martinez children are full-blood Amoric&n Indians, that
their mother is a full-blood Santa Clara Indian, that they
speak and understand the Tewa language which is the official
and legal language of the Santa Clara Pueblo.

In fact, th©

expert witness for defendants, to which counsel just referred,
defined a Santa Claran Indian — a Tewa Indian as one who
speaks th® Tewa language.

She defined the Indians in question

according to the language.
QUESTIONi

Mr. Collins, is your point addressed to

thsg factual question ©f whether c;r not- these children will
kind of fit in in the Santa

Clara Pueblo, or whethor the

federal district court, as opposed to th© Indian Tribe, should
determine what the traditions of th© Tribe are?
MR. COLilNS:

Mr. Justice-:, my point is address..*d he

the Tribal interest asserted as a justi.fication for this
Ordinance. They h .vs constantly said that 'without the
\

Ordinance their culture: wouLd be lost, and w© submit that can’t
be tfca case, because tha persons who are so closely identified"
with the culture as these persons are excluded by the*
Ordinance,

MR. COLLINS:

Well, in this case, the Tribal Court

and the Tribe.! Legislature are one and the ssiss. Th© lower
courts have developed a rule, with which w© have no quarrel, a
salutary rule, saying that a plai.ntd.ff, to bring a case to the
federal courts, must first axhaust all his internal remedies
within the Tribe.
We have no quarrel with that rule.

Th© district

court found, without, contradiction, that we had done that, in
this case.

And, of course, that, I am sura, has resolved in

the context of some cthsr Tribes a number of disputes, the
existence of that rule.

only go to th& administration of the law.

la which regard I might add, a reply brief was just filed by
petitioners, in wnidh they quote some legislative history,
about equal protection, and thsy quote legislative history
about that rejected clause applying only to members of the

should not© that that legislative history does not apply to
the clause that was actually enacted by the Congress.

reasons are really not very gocd ones, ©v©n if cultural
reasons were relevant.
MR. COLLINS:

Well. 1 am saying that. —- I’m saying

that, -thoug.hr only with regard to a rather clear end dramatic
and undisputed fact in this case, which is the notion, of
insidsrs versus outsiders.

The notion that th«3© people are

raised in the society, admitted to the religion? and-in the
literature, if you were admitted to this Pueblo a hundred
years ago, that w s tanta.vae>mfc to membership.

Things have

changed.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs- cam© along and said to
this Tribe, you’vs got to have a written Tribal Roll,
something new. That cams along in the Thirties•

That’s

And than they

C.J3B5S along and they said, MWe’ve tslcen some land away from you
md w©'rs goi-ig tr- pay yen amas money.”

And that gnvm rise

to par capita payment.
As:.o if yeu IcM: r.t tha legislative history in his
Pueblo’s own record-- in th© testimony and the rcseorc” in this
cm -. ---, it’s; cl ;x '.hat vift tha Council had in mind when thoy
passed this rule war, heaping those, per capita payments up?
nothing mar©, nothing less .

To continui on. that; point, Mr» Jus tic-3, on the
point: of jurisdiction? K'Ser, there is a long tradition in
the federal courts of enforcing ta© Constitution against
futuro violations by <aquih&bl@ relief against governments,

QUESTION:

Well, that's — that doesn't go to

federal jurisdiction, that goes to immunity.
MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

The very first questi.on is whether or

not the federal courts have juriEdicti.oa.
courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.

Now, federal
Generally juris-

diefelon is expressly and explicitly conferred by Congress,
wii.iin the melos ir.d bounds of uha Cn rtitution.
There certainly was no 'explicit conferral of juris­
diction in this ense»

You would agree with that.

relied upon are 1331, on ihr ground that th^sa actions arise
under the laws of the Uni.ted Stress, and 1343, the Civil
Rights jurisdiction, by analogy to the decisions' of this Court
in such cases as Alien v. Board cf Elections — that's a
particularly relevant case, the Allen jr. Bo^rd of Elections case,
because the Court implied a private civil remedy in that case
in spite of the fact that the statute involved in that case
the Voting Rights Act of 1955 contained a narrower civil
rernady, not criminal, not habeas corpus or something else,
within the statute.
And in ither actions, under 42 U.S.C. 1981, 42 U.S.C.
1982 me other circumstances, the Court has implied a private
\

civil remedy to enforce the Constitv.tion or enforce civil
