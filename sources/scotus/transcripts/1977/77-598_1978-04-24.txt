MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Greyhound Corporation v. Mfc. Hood Stages»
Mr. Reese, I think you may proceed whenever" you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JO®? R. REESE, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. REESEs
Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas® the

I am John Reese, counsel for the petitioners, the

Greyhound Corporation and Greyhound Lines, Inc.
This is a private antitrust case, brought by the
respondent Mfc. Hood Stages against Greyhound.

The issue as to

which the Court granted .certiorari is whether the four-year
statute of limitations in antitrust cases was tolled by the Inter
state Commerce Commission proceeding brought by Mt. Hood and in
which the ...gover^nment -later 'intervened with the re;suit that the
damage period in this case was multiplied five-fold, to twenty
years instead of the .normal four years.
‘ .

.

;

"The Court of Appeals held that the -statute was tolled
and it upheld a $13 million -treble damage judgment; against
Greyhounds; without tolling",- the judgment would- still be approxi­
mately $8 million.
QUESTIONS

The jury —
Could you give aa that list: figure again?

MR. REESE* ’Approximately $3 million.
The jury found that. Mt. Hood knew of should have known

of its claims in this casa on a specific date» December 14, I960,,
therefore in order to recover damages for any period prior to
that date, Mt. Hood was required to file its complaint within
four years, by December 14, 1964.

Mt. Hood did not file its

complaint within that four-year period? instead, it waited an
additional three and one-half years.

The complaint in this

case was not filed until July 5, 1968.
On the face of it, then, the statute of limitations
barred recovery for all damages prior to July 5, 1964.

The

Court of Appeals, however, allowed recovery all the way hack to
1953..

It did that on the theory that the statute was tolled by

two different" methods which could then ba added 'together.

First,

is sustained the jury's finding that there was fraudulent con­
cealment until December 14, 1960.

Then it hold that the claims

were saved-: from being -barred on December 14, 1964 because on
that very date the government filed a petition asking leave to
intervene in an Interstate Commerce Commission proceeding that
Mt.. Hood had brought.-

Tha court held that the filing of that

petition pa that very last day before tii© claims were barred
j

satisfied the requirements for tolling under section 16(i) of
the Clayton Act.
Now, section 16(i) is obviously at tha heart of the
issue before tha Court.

That is a carefully drawn statute, and

it provides that whenever the United States institutes a pro­
ceeding to prevent, restrain or punish violations of the

5

antitrust laws and th© statute of limitations is tolled as to
any matter complained of in a prior government proceeding.

Now*

it is important to remember that while section 16 (i) is a toll­
ing provision* it is and is part of a statute of repose which
is dasigned to cut off stale claims.
The panel of the Ninth Circuit cited this case failed
to recognise that purpose and as a result its application of
the statute does violence to the language and frustrates its
purpose as a statute of repos®.
QUESTION?

What do you say was the purpose of th©

government® s intervention in this ease*. Mr. Reese?
MR. REESE:

The purpose of the government8a interven­

tion in this case* Mr. Chief Justice* was to assure that the
Interstate Commerce Commission took into account competitive
polici.es as it is required to do under section 5 of th® Inter­
state Commarce Act.
QUESTION?

What would be — just to pursue that* what

would he the consequences of its participation?

Would there b®

any consequences that would either punish violations or restrain
violations or prevent violations?
MR. REESE?

No* Your Honor* there would not be.

And

as ws understand the law as announced by this Court in McLean
Trucking and Minneapolis a St. Louis Railway* that could not
follow.

!

QUESTION?

Then what was the real impact of their

6
being there,- to sort of help the Commission understand the case
a little better?.
MR. REESE:
Chief Justice.

Well, that is pretty accurate J. think, Mr.

One of the duties of the Antitrust Division of

the Justice Department is to participate before administrative
agencies that are required to taka into consideration competi­
tive policies in their regulatory decision-making.
QUESTION:

Do you nay an intervention by the United

States could never toll the statute?
MR. REESE:

Mr. Chief Justice, we don8fc want to take

such an extreme position as to say it could neves? toll the
statute.

We do maintain that it could never toll the statute

in a section 5 proceeding under the Interstate Commerce Act.
That is a section under which the ICC not only does not enforce
the antitrust laws, but indeed it authorizes and immunizes con­
duct that would otherwise violate the antitrust laws.

I cannot

see how a proceeding under that section can fairly be read to
be one to prevent restraint or punish violations of the antitrust
laws within the meaning of section 16(i).
QUESTION:

Of course, the Department of Justice

Antitrust Division itself doesn't punish or restrain, does it?
It can only persuade a court to do so, isn't that the essence of
it, or another -tribunal?
MR. REESE:
Justice.

That is absolutely correct, Mr. Chief

What I am saying is that it cannot even persuade the

7
ICC to do

bo

under section 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act,

because that is not the function of the ICC under that section.
Indeed, as I understand McLean Trucking, the ICC is without
power to do that under section 5, and it is certainly not the
purpose of section 5 to prevent restraint or punish violations
of the antitrust laws.
The Court of Appeals decision finding that the statute
is tolled by reason of section 16 (:i) i.& both bad statutory in­
terpretation and bad policy.

It is bad statutory interpreta­

tion because the terms and requirements of section .16'(i) are
clear.

The government's petition for leave to intervene does

not satisfy, those terms, and requirements.
simply not an antitrust complaint.

That petition is

It is not thte' kind of docu­

ment that should be required to bring section 16 C;i) into play..

It does not begin

to satisfy the language or tha purpose of section 16Ci).

To put

its deficiencies in terms of the statutory language, the peti­
tion did not institute a civil or criminal proceeding as section
16(i> requires.

The Court of Appeals apparently admits that this

8
proceeding was not instituted by the government.
QUESTION?

Did the government through the Antifcrurst

Division' have a right, an absolute right of intervention in the
ICC proceedings?
MR. REESEs

No, it didn't, Mr. Justice Stewart.

It

petitioned for leave to intervene from the ICC under the ICCs
regulations, and it was granted leave seme several months after
the petition was filed,'
QUESTION %

Does the petition recita the purpose of its

intervention'; Its motion for leave to intervene?
•MR. REESE t

The petition recited only that the United

States was an interested party in the proceeding.

It declined

to say on whose side the United States sought leave to intervene
QUESTION s

Is there any need in light of the broader

enforcement procedures of the antitrust laws for the Antitrust
Division to intervene In this administrative proceeding as a
predicate to later bringing suit under the antitrust laws?

Is

there any concept 'of exhaustion of administrative remedies or
anything akin to that?
MR. 42ESE:

Non®, Mr. Justice Stewart.

A direct anti­

trust case could have been brought.
QUESTIONs

Any time, with or without any motion for

leave to intervene in these ICC proceedings?
MR. REESEs

That's correct.

Second, the second deficiency of the petition in terms

9
of the statute of limitations of the statutory language of
section 16 (i) is that the petitioner did. n rt complain of any­
thing f as the statute clearly require-.3,
does not discuss this point.

The Court of Appeals

And, third, the government's pe­

tition did not seek to prevent, restrain or punish violations
of any of the antitrust laws, as section 16(1) requires.
On this point, the best the Court of Appeals can say
for us is that the petition showed that the government5® in­
terest lay in the possibility of antitrust violations should
Mt. Hood's allegations prove correct.

It is purely hypoehtical.

It is plainly insufficient to satisfy the requirements of sec­
tion 16(1).
How, 'it is important to remember also what kind of
proceeding it was,

7. touched on this in answer to the Chief

Justice!1 0 question a moment ago. - It was an ICC proceeding
brought by Mt. Hood under section 5 to reopen some old acquisi­
tion cases for the purpose of obtaining a supplemental order in
those cases.

It was not an antitrust proceeding whan Mt. Hood
•!

.

brought it, and no one has suggested that it would have satis­
fied the requirements of section ISti) at that time*

The

government* s petition for leave to intervene only as an interest
iV ■. '■

*•

ed party without requesting relief, without making any charges,
could not have changed the fundamental regulatory nature of that
proceeding into an antitrust case that satisfies the statute.
Indeed, the Justice Department itself specifically distinguishes

10
that kind of activity from its normal antitrust enforcement
activity.
Now, I have been focusing on the petition for leave
tc intervene.

There are three basic reasons for that.

First,,

even Mt. Hood agrees that section 16(i) applies only to the ex­
tent that the private case is based upon a matter complained of
in the prior government proceeding.

And this Court, in Leh v.

General Petroleum, said that in general what the government
complained of must be determined from the face of its complaint.
Here, although 'the petition for leave to intervene did not com­
plain of anything, that is the only document that is even re­
motely analogous to a complaint.
Second, since that petition was filed on the very last
day before the statute ran on the claims, anything that the
government did after that date would be too late to save the
claims anyway.

If the test should be to look beyond the face

of the government®a first pleading, then tolling should commanse
only when the government first does something that can fairly
ba called a complaint that institutes a proceeding.
QUESTION %

Does the judgment which you are challenging

now depend in any part or in whole or in part, using the language»
of the statute now, on any matter complained of in said pro­
ceeding , that is in the ICG proceeding in which the government
intervened?
ME. REESE:

The judgment we are currently attacking

11
is not based upon any matter complained of by the government in
tha ICC proceeding.
QUESTION 3

Hot complainad of by the government„ com-

plainad of by Mt. Hood*- that is ray question.
HR. REESEs

The charges in the Interstate Commerce

Commission proceeding as to acts and practices are very similar
to the charges of acts and practices or at least some of them
in the antitrust case.
QUESTION ?

Then why is not — why does not this ease

fall within that language which 1 believe it is your brief; at
the top of page 7, italicised in section 16(1)# at the top of
paga 7e reading *the running of the statute of limitations in

In other words# it must be the United

QUESTIONS

Hot the injured party?

QUESTIONs

That certainly was Congress6 view* too*

don’t you think* in enacting 16(1)?
MR. REESEs

Well* I think certainly the statute con­

templates that the action upon which the private plaintiff
awaits to take advantage of is a government action in which the
government makes a complaint against an alleged antitrust viola­
tor.

You are absolutely right, Mr. Justice Relinquish.
QUESTIONs

And isn't the reason for that the superior

resources that are at fcho disposal of the government,- may unravel
a lot of things that private plaintiffs by themselves couldn't
unravel and therefore it is reasonable to let private plaintiffs
ride on the tail of an action that was brought by the govern­
ment?
MR. REESE:

That is the way we understand the purpose

to have bean conceived fey Congress in 1914, and is why Congress
has —•
QUESTION!

Why do you think it makes any difference

whether the private litigant rides on the government or whether
the government rides on the private litigant’s proceeding?
MR. REESE:

It seems to Rise, Mr. Chief Justice, that

that is what the statute says, and that is what the statute was
designed to accomplish.'

13
QUESTIONS

But you also said, I take it, in your brief

that even if the intervention could be sort of instituting the
case, that the government really didn’t complain of anything in
that suit.
MR. REESE*

That's right, Mr. Justice White, the pe­

tition specifically denied knowledge of the charges that Mt.
Heod itself had made.
QUESTION*

And so it didn't complain of anything in

that suit that the petitioner in that suit might have complained
of?
MR.- REESE*
QUESTION*
MR. REESE*

That's right.
Why did it intervene?
I believe in answer to the Chief Justice’s

question earlier I indicated that it does have a duty under its
mission to participate before administrativa agendas, which
agencies are required by law to take into account policies of
competition.

I believe that is why it intervened.

QUESTIONs

Was it just an interested spectator and,

if so, couldn't the government do this from the bleachers with­
out joining in the action? •
MS. REES®*

Your Honor, the record really doesn’t

show much about what the government did.

The only indications

that we have that I can find are that the government safe there
during the proceeding and cross-examined some witnesses but
didn't put on any evidence of its own during that proceeding.

14
QUESTIONs

Well? that could be because they thought

that the private party ms doing wall enough without them.
MR. REESEs

That may be, we just don’t know.

We do

know that whan it filed its petition? it refused or at least
declined to endorse the charges that the private party had made.
QUESTIONi

But your focus? I take it? is that the

government as such did not institute any proceeding either to
prevent or to restrain or to punish?
MR. REESEs
QUESTIONS

That’s right.
And is it on thatbasis that you distinguish

tfcs Minnesota Mining cases?
MR. REESEs

The Minnesota Mining case? I believe is

related to a point that is almost hot involved in this case.

I

understood the issue there was principally whether a Federal
Trade Commission proceeding could satisfy the terms of section
16(1).

It. was? however? a proceeding brought by the FTC to pre­

vent? restrain or punish violations of section 7 of the Clayton
Act? and that requirement

too

therefore clearly satisfied in

the Minnesota Mining case? as it is not in this on®.
QUESTIONs

That is a point of my inquiry, that it was

a government instituted —
MR. REESE 8

1 was a little slow on th® uptake there,

Mr. Justice Blackmun,
Mow, 1 have been focusing on the government’s petition,
as I said, and there is another reason still.

The only

IS
alternative to that is to review the entire administrative pro™
ae@di.ng to try to determine whether the government eventually
did complain of anything»

We submit that that iraposes a heavy

burden on the parties and the courts, and it is an inherently
uncertain process*

If the government's position is not clear

enough at the outset of the proceeding to enable 'it to stata it
in a proper complaints, the parties will have no notice that
their conduct is being complained of.

If the government is 'un­

able to state a complaint at the outset, how is a party to know
from the way it conducts itself later during the course of the
proceeding whether it is complaining of something?
Indeed, if the government is that uncertain at the
outsat., it is likely to change its position during the course
of the proceeding, and what does one do in that case?

Does

tolling depend on the position the government ends up taking or
'

*

•r\

doss the statute start and stop with each change in the govern­
ment's views?
The result of that approach in general would be that
ths parties would not know where they stood on the antitrust
statute of limitations.

But in any event, the result of that

approach in this case is that Mt. Hood's claims would still be
barred.
'&ow, the decision below is bad policy for another
reason as well*

It would take a vary specific -and limited toll

ing provision, an exception to the statute of limitations, and

16

broaden it to the point where there would, be practically no
statute of limitations in regulated industries.

One can hardly

pick up a trade regulation report without reading of soma
Justice Department intervention or participation before one or
another of the administrative agencies , and that participation
cannot fairly foe distinguished from the government0 a neutral
v

position to intervene in this case.

In other words,, if the de­

cision below is- upheld, the antitrust .statute of limitations my
well be found tolled by literally countless administrative pro­
ceedings that no one ever intended to prevent, restrain or
punish violations of the antitrust laws,
V,

r would say a word about Mt. Heed’s alternative theory,
Mr, Hoot argues in the alternative that the statute should be
tolled, to -prevent injustice because it itself brought the ICC
proceeding,

Simply? that iaakos even less sense' than the 16(1)

tolling theory? and all of the good reasons for not suspending
the statute under section 16(i) are even better reasons for not

:';'d ^

.

. j; Ui

suspending it by a thaejry -of equitable tolling'.?
First? it wpuld; be contrary to the policy proposed
that Congress has songhti to effect? second? it would create even
greater uncertainty and unpredictability ao to the circumstances
and tfeo period of tolling;, but? more fundamentally? equitable
tolling simply doesn*t fit the facts in this case.

In the

first placer equitable tolling ought to depend upon the plain­
tiffs having been diligent? but Mt, Hood wasn’t diligent in this

17

case.

It knew of its claims in I960.

It did nothing ate all

about them until 1964 when it brought its ICC proceeding, and
it waited almost eight years before it finally filed the com­
plaint in tills case.

I submit that that is not diligence.

Mt.

Hood’s equitable tolling, theory should fail for want of equity

a1one.
Contrary to the impression that Mi*,» Hood* s brief seeks
t© LmvQf there is no forfeiture or threat of forfeiture in this
case.

Even if Mt. Hood loses on the issues before the Court*

the judgment that would ba remaining in its favor would be nearly
double the total amount of its actual loss as determined by the
jury for the entire period from .1953 to 1973*

To recover double

damages is not to suffer a forfeiture.
Mt. Hood is not at all like the plaintiff in the
Burnett case on which it relies, who stood to lose all remedy
whatever' for his injury if the statute had not been tolled.

I

find no excuse for Mt. Hood's failure to wait eight years to
file tliis case.
The Court’s decision in Johnston v. Railway Express
Ag:.ai<3y ought to bs dispositive on this point.

In any event,

. of the excuses that Mil, Hood has offered has any merit.

It says that it" delayed filing this case because it wanted to
get mi injunction.
delay.

But it is hard to see how that excused the

If Mt. Hood had really believed that it couldn't file

this case sooner because it couldn’t ask the federal court for

18
injunctive relief, than it is even harder to understand why it
asked the federal court for injunctive relief when it finally
did file this complaint.
NOW, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is no

cam

either.

ex­

Although Mt, Hood would have us believe that its

failure to act was in 'reliance or out of respect for that doc­
trine, the theory is plainly an afterthought.

It was not even

raised in this case until after the trial, when the case had
been pending for more than five years.

I think the Court®s

decision in the Johnson' -case makes it clear that Mt. Hood’s
resort to an administrative .agency cannot excuse "its 51 failure to
take the minimal steps necessary to preserve each claim inde­
pendently.-"

ORAL ARGUMENT OP EUGENE C, CREW, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR, CREW:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
Greyhound claims that the question before this Court
is whether Mfc. -Hood should be allowed to expand the statutory
period five-fold, from four to twenty years.
not the question.

I submit that is

The question is whether the statute should

be tolled for; the brief three and a half-year period, December
860 to July 1964, by reason of the ICC proceedings e© as to
allow Mt. Hood to recover damages proven for those years that
Greyhound was found to have violated the antitrust laws and to
have fraudulently concealed those violations from Mt. Hood.
The lower courts .held that the statute was tolled
under section 16(1), and we ask this Court to affirm on that
ground, and on the additional ground that this Court's equitable
doctrine of tolling applies.
Both statutory and equitable tolling on the facts prerented here will promote various important federal policies
which may be collectively described as the orderly procedure
i

developed by Congress

'and this Court for the private enforce­

ment of the antitrust laws against defendants regulated by the
Interstate Commerce Commission.

did it do after the intervention to prevent,- restrain or

Division fit the Civil Rights Division — but it was the Antifcurst Division of the Justice Department that petitioned for

the intervention ©f the • government at that time which constitute'»
the institution of a civil action within the purview of 16(1)»

QUESTION*

Just to follow up on my Brother Marshall’s

question, first' of all, apparently you acknowledge that there
was no prayer for relief in the government's original petition
for relief?
MR. CREWs

Mr. Justice Stewart, I cannot say that.

I

believe that it does seek relief, and I would point out to Your
Honor that, for example -- and this would be in the joint
appendix, at page 39, the government -stated,

8I’f

anything, the

a©ad for sharp surveillance of any abuse of the power these
acquisitions have given Greyhound and for prompt action to
correct any such abuse has become more important as Greyhound*s
encirclement of Mt. Hood has become more complete with each
successive acquisition."

And on th® last page of the petition,

at page 41 of the appendix, again the Justice Department, points

23
out that the antitrust iav?s are very

much

involved, and that

while the approvals might be exempt, predicatory conduct made
possible by those acquisitions would not be — and they state
in the last paragraph — "For if it then appears that the Com­
mission lacks jurisdiction to dispose of Mt. Hood’s complaint,
in whole or in part, Mt. Hood, remitted to another forum, may
find relief elsewhere i Hu story if it comes too late to be
effective.15
Now, it may not be the orthodox prayer that you see
in the typical complaint, where it is at the bottom of the
page, but I submit that this document within the four corners
prays for relief.
QUESTION*

And what relief could the Interstate Com­

merce Commission have given in this proceeding , what antitrust
relief?
MR. CREWs

The antitrust relief, Mr. Stewart, the

Interstate' Commarce Commission .could give was t'to relief it
gave, and that was to enter a cease and desist .order which pre­
vented Greyhound — attempted to prevent Greyhound from continu­
ing its predatory behavior to destroy Mt. Hoo&ts’ business.

And-

I submit,), "four Honor, that that is exactly the relief that was
given and it was the relief that was sought and' it was granted
in substantial part because the Justice Department intervened
and sought it on behalf of Mt. Hood.
QUESTION:

And does the Interstate Commerce Commission

24
have that as such; the power or the function of enforcing the
antitrust laws and giving antitrust relief as such; or is it
confined to simply considering antitrust laws in administering
the Interstate Commerce Act?

the power and the duty to enforce the antitrust laws and to
prevent their -QUESTION*

be sustained in full and that respondent Greyhound also be
found to be in continuing violation of section 216, referring
to the Interstate Cosaaerea Act.

It stresses respondent Grey­

hound * s arrogant attitude, and doubts that a .one-year policing

I* ve got news for you,, I am going to do it.

MR. CREWi.

Well, I not submitting that', Mr. Justice.

What I am saying is that the decision of the ICC to go with
th® petition of the government indicate beyond per adventure
that th© Justice Department was intervened to prevent a viola­
tion of the antitrust laws and was seeking relief to prevent a
violation if the evidence at the hearing demonstrated such a
violation.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Crew, the part you read doesn't refer

to the antitrust laws at all*

QUESTIONS

A violation of section 21S, yes.

MR. CREWs/

Well, in addition they referred to 216.

Bat the Interstate Commerce Commission also referred expressly
to th© antitrust laws, as did th© Chicago Federal Court in
affirming in, and stated', that the ICC was in granting that r©li®£ applying the antitrust laws to Greyhound * s conduct.
QUESTIONi

tor. Crew, going baak for a moment to your

response to my Brother Marshall'a question as to the status of
•i

an intervenor once it gets in, turning•to the appendis, at
page 43, which is the ICC5s order to allow intervention, the
second paragraph of that order says that intervention is allowed
but r;the permission to intervene heroin granted shall not be

34
construed to allow interveners to introduce evidence which will
unduly broaden the issues raised in this proceeding*R

That is

a somewhat limited intervention status that the ICC granted to
the government, isn’t it?
MR. CREWs

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, you are correct

that it did not allow any broadening of the issues', but 2 think
that helps support the position that the issues concerning
antitrust laws were already present.

I believe that any time

an intervener intervenes that they usually do intervene on the
basis of the issues drawn at that time.

And I believe that the

antitrust issues war©' already a part of the proceedings.
QUESTIONS

MR. CREW:

Mr. Justice Stewart, I believe that it

would be even more compelling in that case because the Inter­

relief with respect to Mt. Hood’s petition.

At that point in

time, had the Justice Department filed a court action for
prospective relief with respect to the same conduct, I think

QUESTION;

Is it not correct that sometimes the Anti­

trust Division simply sits back and waits for the facts to de­

MR. CREW;

Welly that is sort of the reverse of what

I think the laws contemplate, but they sometimes do.

And I

think that in this case, had Mt. Hood filed as it did that the
Justice Department had two choices, either to sit back and wait
until Mt. Hood had resolved the issue in the agency or filed
an agency proceeding or intervene in tha agency proceeding, and
among its alternatives I submit under tha law of this country
was not to file a court action in the face of the ICC proceed­
ing, because 1 think it would have, created a direct and immedi­
ate conflict between the two forums.

MR. CHEW:

statutory authority.

But I would like to, if I may, address

equitable tolling in the time left.
Your Honors, we submit that without statutory tolling
and without section 16 CD, this Court has declared that a
federal statute should be tolled if it will promote important
federal policies without frustrating the statute of limitations
policy of repose.
We believe that in light of the tolling principle
that is enunciated in the Burnett case, in American Pipe, and
most recently in the Johnson case, that tolling,should at least
apply if the following factors are present, and we submit these
factors wore present heres
Firstly, that a plaintiff’s prior resort to an agency

prosecution of his antitrust claim,,

MR. GREW;

That is a possibility.

QUESTION;

Why do you tell us that there would, have

to be a dismissal of the damages action?
MR. CREW:

Welle Mir. Justice White, X believe in

answer to that question that we would have to assess what Mt.
Hood did in 1964, the' question is whether or not Mt. Flood
acted reasonably at that time, and I believe that he should
have done the same tiling today.

But what I am stressing here

is thafcin 1964, the law of this country under primary jurisdic­
tion indicated that has ease would have been dismissed, not
stayed.

And I would point out to Your Honors that the Carnation

decision, which was reversed by this Court in 1966 to substitute
a stay for dismissal, but the Ninth Circuit in 1964 had stated
that such a case on similar facts to this case must be dis­
missed because the District Court lacked jurisdiction.

So I

think that there was enough law to —

Now* in addition, to the requirement of primary juris­
diction as an element* 1 was stating that the second factor

which is present her© too is that the plaintiff is required to
obtain his injunctive remedy in one forum and his damage remedy
in another forum and is legally precluded from seeking both
remedies in the same forum.
here.

How* that was clearly the case

And thirdly., and this is one more factor which should be

present and was present here* that despite this legal bifurca­
tion ©f remedies between two forums, the plaintiff’s claim is
factually and legally identical so as to satisfy the require­
ment of notice stated in the Johnson case and thereby avoid the
"evils against which the statute of limitations is designed to
protect."
With respect to that factor* 1 would point out that
the claim here presented in both the ICC and the court 'was
factually the same* and 1 submit that it was legally the same*
that only the remedies were different* and that is due to the
bifurcation in the law confronting Mil Hood.

Mt. Hood invoked

the ICC®s jurisdiction to apply the antitrust laws 'to Greyhound’s
conduct for injunctive relief purposes and then bafora the court
apply the antitrust 'laws for purposes of damages.
Now* Your Honors* the Johnson decision which I think
is an important decision declared that the statute of limitakions may be tolled if there S.s "a federal body of procedural

f,

state Commerce Commission proceeding, the Justice Department has
never gotten out.
QUESTION £

But when did they get out of this case that

is here now?
MR, CREW s

Actually the Justice Department did inter-

ven© la this case at an early stag© of the proceedings for dis­
covery purposes and conducted discovery in this case to ba need
in the contempt proceedings that took place in Chicago.
Now, with respect to the federal policy or federal
body of procedural law which th® Johnson case requires, I would

44
point out that there are two.

First, I would like to consider

the federal policy expressed in 15 U.S.C. 26, the injunction
remedy under the antitrust laws.

Despite the importance of this

r@u.eciy and the obvious preference that a plaintiff try to save
his business first in mitigation of his damages, that remedy was
not available to Mt. Hood in the courts.

When Mt. Hood was about

to go under as a result of Greyhound8s conduct in 1964, it went
to the only forum that was available to it to save its business.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Your time is expired but we

will extend it two minutes and give your colleague the same.
MR, CREWs

Thank you, Your Honor.

Wow, that was not a preference, as mentioned by
Johnson, but it was a congressional mandate.

In that respect,

Your Honors, Mt. Hood differed from the plaintiffs in Johnson.
Johnson’s plaintiffs could have gotten full relief from the
federal court if he wished, but he exercised his valuable option
not to do so.

Mt. Hood had no such option here.

The doctrine

of primary jurisdiction also is a federal doctrine which directed
Mt. hood to go to the ICC and it is particularly applicable here
because of antitrust exemptions claimed.
Now, Your honors, I would say this, that the doctrine
of primary jurisdiction has always been

invoked by defendants,

never by plaintiffs, to protect defendants against premature
lawsuits♦

I believe that the primary jurisdiction doctrine

should now be completed and that the statute of limitations

45
should ba tolled for those plaintiffs who act in accordance with
it.

Judicial econoray will b© served, just as notions of lifci-

gatlve efficiency were served by tolling the statute in American
Pipe.
And on the point of equities, counsel for Greyhound
stated that we do not' have a shred of equity, that Mt. Hood was
not diligent, and that our damages should ba reduced frcra treble
to double damages to avoid a windfall.

First, Congress said

treble damages, it did not say double damages.

Greyhound cannot

use this as a rationalisation to deny tolling.

Secondly,

Greyhound's claim regarding the equities requires that the
equities bra balanced and. compared.
Greyhound was found by the jury to have fraudulently
concealed its conduct.for eleven years, from 1953 to 1964.

How#

with respect to Mt. Hood's behavior# Greyhound states that you
weren't diligent, you should have filed your action in 1961,
in 1962 or 1963.

I submit —“

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

Your time is esepired now#

Mr. Crew.
MR. CREW;

Your Honor, I would say that that is a

false issue in that instance because whether or not they ware
diligent then is irrelevant to the question of whether tolling
occurred later.

Thank you, Your Honors.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. REESE, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OP THE PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL

MR, REESEg
about two points.

four Honors, I only wanted to take up

Thar© was

sobs©

talk here during counsel * s

presentation about the United States being aligned with Mt. Hood
in the ICC proceeding.

Counsel mad© the statement that the

United States was driven to the ICC.

There is a bit of evidence

that hasn't appeared in the brief, and I would like to call it
to the Court* s attention at this time.
In 1964, prior to the tints that it filed its ICC pro­
ceeding, Mt. Hood's President, Mr-. Niskanen, went to the Departirent of Justice and asked it to take antitrust enforcement
action against Greyhound.

It is perfectly clear that the

Department of Justice determined not to do that.
QUESTION?
•WjR. REESE:
to 3774.

That is in th© record, X taka it?
-That'.'is in the record, at transcript 3772

There is another. bit of evidence in vt:he record, this'

is at dark' s transcript .record 1006, and that .is the reply
Greyhound filed to Mt»; Hphd'.s petition in the lib,C, and that
notes that Mt. Hood had gone to th© government"''adnsd mad© some of
its charges and the government had informed Grayhound that it
found at 1mst some of these charges to be without substantiation,
.In other words, even prior to th® time that Mt, Hood,
filed its ICC proceeding, it appeared that it -had sought anti­
trust enforcement relief from the government and that was not

47
forthcoming.

The government certainly did subsequently inter­

It is not at all clear that it was aligned with Mt. Hood ,

certainly not —
QUESTION i
MR, REESEs

Do you suggest that it was with

Greyhound?

ilo, Mr. Chief Justice, I can*t snake that

claim.
QUESTION:

Your colleague-, of course, makes the point

that there would have been little or no point for the government
to file an antitrust action in a Federal District Court during
the pendency of: this ICC proceeding, because that action would
simply have been delayed and the court would 'have deferred to
the administrative agency until the completion of those adminis­
trative proceedings.

that.

MR. REESE* Wei!.,'-I would like to say two things to

'
•*;
First, the point that I have been trying'to —
.QUESTION*

Perhaps I misunderstood 'your -colleague, but

did you understand him to say something along -those lines?
t-m. REESE * ' I - understaood him to say'that.

The point

I am making now is thht the government was asked prior to the
fcinu; there was any ICC proceeding to bring an -antitrust case ana
it didh'.t

do it, and that is at 3772 to 3774 of the. transcript*
QUESTION 2

Do you think that undermines the poasi-

bility of their intervention being construed as the institution
of a proceeding?
MR. REESE*

Yes, and I think it also highlights the
I

48

distinction between a normal antitrust enforcement case and this
neutral petition for leave to intervene before the ICC*
QUESTION s
time.

You say they could have done it at that

What do you say the government ecu Id have done at that

time to prevent or restrain an antitrust violation?
MR. HESS*

It could have filed a civil action for

injunctive relief.,
QUESTIONi

and what would the court have done with

that while the ICC proceeding was pending?
■I

MR. REESEs

I am not in a position to say, Your Honor.

I think nobody is.
.QUESTION i

236: j but from a practical' ssatt.iar, you know

they 'wouldn't have proceeded, don9t you?
■MR. REESE*;'.- Your Honor, I find the divisions on pri­
mary jurisdiction to 'fell©ss than clear.

For-©sample, one' would

have thought that in ..'theiQt.ter Tail case, Mr. Justice Stewart,
a reference to the agency might have occurred.-; . 1 don’t think

QUESTION s

At least in any ©vent if th@ government

had fiiai the suit, at least it would 2<av® h&saf 'then teen taking
,a position and making a claim.
MR. REESE *

Yes.

49
QUESTIONS

And I take it that you don’t say that the

united states didn't take the position before the ICG proceed­
ings were over?
MR, REESE*
QUESTION *

Beforep the United States —
And if they had done at the time of their

intervention complaint what they later did in'the proceeding,
what would you have said than?
MR, REESEi

It would still be .an action to enforce not

the anti-crust laws but rather section 5 of the Interstate Com­
merce Act,
QUESTIONs

And it wouldn’t have been a civil action

to enforce the antitrust laws?
MR. REESE*

No. I think I have had iay say and 1 thank

the Court for its attention.
