ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD A. BERKMAN
ON PEI ALF OF PETITIONER
MR. BERKMAN:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This is a Federal prosecution and conviction for

mailing obscene brochures, magazines and films.,

It comes to

this Court raising important questions as to substance and.
procedure in Federal obscenity trials, questions which require
this Court's constitutional interpretation and the exercise
of its Federal supervisory rower.
The first question which is presented has to do
with the jury charge in the court below — in the trial court,
I should say — which induced sensitive persons and children
in the community against whose average prurient appeal and
patent offensiveness the jury was to apply its measurements.
With respect to the charges, they made it clear
that although the jury was rot to judge by the effeci; on
particularly sensitive or insensitive persons in the community
it was clear that the community as a whole, which included
both sensitive and insensitive persons, and with respect to
children., with respect to young and old, with respect to

4
educated and uneducated, religious and irreligious, men, women,
and children from all walks of life, all of those persons at
the periphery of the community as a whole were to be included
in the jury's consideration.
It seems to me that the analysis of the prejudice
involved in a series of charges of this kind must be considered
against the context of the record, must be considered on the
basis of the fact that there was no contention by the
Government at the trial, in fact there was a stipulation in
open court at the time of th2 voir dire of the jury that there
were no mailings to children involved in this case, and as a
matter of fact, the jury was so instructed by the court on the
basis of an oral stipulation reached in front of the jury.
It should also be noted that there was

considerable

interest among the jury at the voir dire of this case with
respect to die question as to whether or not the materials
were available to children.

There was one question from a

juror during the time of the interrogation of the jury,in
determining whether or not he could properly sit, whether or not
the marerial was available to children.

As a matter of fact,

curing the course of the interrogation another juror agreed
that explicit sex portrayals ought to be kept from children,
ibid with respect to the summation by the Government in this
case, it was emphasised many times that children were part of
the total community, also that the total community included

sensitive and feeble-minded people and in advising the jury
how to behave in the jury room on the basis of the instruction
which had been given, the Government attorney indicated that
you cannot focus on the child alone or sensitive or insensi­
tive persons alone, but he said,

"What you have to do is add
✓

them all up and then corae up with a middle range."

That

appears in the reporter's transcript at page 726. And it seems
to me that on the basis of such an arrangement, if this
Court s admonition that the reading habits or materials which
are available to be examinee by adults is not to be reduced
to the level of children, it seems to me that particularly
in a case in which there is no contention that the materials
were in fact mailed or distributed or disseminated in any way
to children, that that kind of a charge has the most farreaching and prejudicial and detrimental effect.
It seems to me tl^at i.f you notice the other factors
in the: case which pointed the finger at children, even though
there was a stipulation that there were no children involved
in the distribution of this material,

the error is compounded.

It should be noted that during the course of both
cross-examination of the defense witnesses and examination of
•rile rebuttal witness, the trial court permitted, over objection
of the defense, Government testimony regarding the adverse
eohsequences of distribution of pornography to children.
It should be noteI further that during the time

that the Government * s rebutt al witness

Dr. Rue, testified

with respect to some of his experiences, when he testified,over
objection of the defense, that he knew of an episode in which
(sic)
(sic)
there had been an incestuous molestation of a father by his
daughter as a result of haviig examined material in an adult
book store, e.r.d after strenuous objection was interposed and
a demand for mistrial was made and overruled, it seems to me
that that factor,added to th2 rest, indicates the prejudicial
potential of the jury charge in this regard.
If you add to that the fact that not only was this
charge given but also correc five charges which were sought by
the defense that it is the adult community whose prurient
appeal and patent offensiveness ought to be measured, which
charges were denied by the trial court, and if you also note
that the defense asked for a charge that the defendant had not
violated any law with respect to minor children or that the
jury ought net. to assume from the fact that there might have
been testimony concerning minor children, that the defendant
is in any way associated with the issue concerning children,
and that charge was denied.
QUESTION;

The judge did give the instruction in

terras of whether it was utterly lacking in social value or
importance, did he not?
MR. BERIvMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, he did.

He went on to say if it has a minimum —

7
a minimum — of artistic or other social value, then it is
not obscene.

That was a very favorable —■ more favorable

than the most recent opinions authorize, was it not?
MR. BHERMAN:

I think one of the reasons that that

was argued — that’s quite right, Mr. Chief Justice.

But one

of the reasons that was so is that the case was originally
reversed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals after it had
been tried on the basis of Miller standards even though the
events which were involved in the indictment had occurred
prior to Millar.

And when the case was returned, it was with

full appellate instructions that the trial court try the case
under the Memairs standards.

And I think that the court did.

But in the particular instance which the Court has cited, it
had to c.o with the third prcng, that is, with respect to social
value,

end not with the places in which we contend the error

occurred, which is with prurient appeal and with patent
offensiveness, which involved the community as a whole, charge
vh.cn was offered here under circumstances in which we think
that the reference and the emphasis upon sensitive persons
and children ought not to have been dwelled upon to permit
the hinds of summation and the kinds of other events which
occurred during the course of the trial to have happened.
I would add one word to the argument, to this
particular argument, and that is that the Government apparently
has indicated in its brief, as the court below indicated, that

s
it was somewhat dissatisfied with the charges in this case
and contends that somehow ox other the balance of the charge,
the overall charge} somehow cures the deficiency of which the
defense complained.
We suggest to the Court that that is not the case,
that if you examine the overall charge, the only thing that it
does is to indicate again that it is the total community
which is involved and to suggest that the jury cannot focus
particularly on a section of the community.
Now, it seems to me that under circumstances in
which population statistics indicate some 30 percent of the
entire population involves persons under the acre of 18, that
co suggest that a particular area ought to be included without
being focused upon is at best confusing and at worst dangerous
:o the determination of sensitive tools which are necessary
•in this First Amendment area.

It is sort of like asking a

person to stand in the corner and not think of a white bear.
l

think the psychological response to that is obvious.
I turn now to the second question, which has to do

with the admission of comparable materials.

It will be

recalled by the Court that there were two films, "Deep Throat"
and "Devil in Miss Jones," which have been offered by the
defense as a part of its case with respect to demonstration of
reasonably similar explicit sexual candor, with respect to
films which had played regularly and for a considerable

9
period of time in the Los Angeles area which was part of the
central district community, films which on the basis of
evidence: which was permittee, in laying the foundation indicated
that the number one film during the period of 31 weeks in
Los Angeles was "Deep Throat," and that was compared to not
only films of sexual orientation but general run films such
as'Billy Jack"and "Last Evening in Paris," "Paper Moon" and
other motion pictures.
During that period of time, by dividing the number
of dollars that had been received in gross receipts by the
$5 charge per person, some 655,000 persons had actually viewed
that particular film.

And somewhere in the vicinity of about

half that number had viewed the other film which was offered
as comparable.
It should be noted that Lhasa were the only films
that were offered as comparable materials.

It seems to us

that -the foundation was appropriately laid to meet the two
criteria which have flowed since Womack and which have guided
the Ninth Circuit and other circuits in this country, which is
that there must be a reasonable resemblance between the
alleged comparable material and that material which is
charged and that there must be a reasonable degree of community
acceptance.
Now, it seems to us —
QUESTION:

Didn't the Court of Appettls find a lack

Io
o f comparability?
MR. BERKMAN:
Stewart, is yes and no.

Well, the answer to that, Mr. Justice
The Court of Appeals held that with

respect to count 9, which involved the ft In that ;ts char,..;d
in this case, that it was reasonably similar, but with respect
to the other items charged, which included brochures and
magazines which had still pictures as distinguished from
motion pictures, that the medium was sufficiently different
that so far as he was concerned there was not the degree of
comparability.
Cur position is ;hat when you are depicting sexual
candor in a motion picture or you clip a frame from that
motion picture and show a s ;ill picture, so far as we under­
stand the temper of this Court in

Kaplan, which has .indicated

that the medium does not make that much difference and that if
you are talking about the degree of sexual explicitness of
the material, than so far. as we were concerned, we think that
the Court of Appeals was wrong in making that arbitrary
determination and that so far as all eleven counts are concerned,
including the advertising, including the film, including the
picture book, that ail of them were reasonably similar so that
that first standard would be met.
And, of course, the Court of Appeals never reached
the question of whether or not there had been community
acceptance of the material, because —

11

QUESTION:

Mr. Berkman, isn’t it true that the

Court of Appeals didn't say one way or the other as to
whether the other nine counts had the same degree of explicit
ness?
MR. BERKMAN:
QUESTION:

Well —

You are telling us, but how dc we know

that other than that?
MR. BERKMAN:

So far as the Court of Appeals*

opinion is concerned, they nade much of the notion that the
medium was different.
QUESTION:

I understand.

And you say that's wrong

but then don't we still have to know whether or not there is
the same degree of explicit.less in the other counts?
MR. BERKMAN:

Well, the materials are before the

Court, and so far as we are concerned, your Honor, we think
that —
QUESTION:

That we should make that determination

de no vo ?
MR. BERKMAN:

That determination is before you?

it is a matter for independent determination by the Court,
and we think that all the materials are available to the
Court to make that judgment.
QUESTION:
cf.

You. think normally that is the kind

determination that this Court should make in the first

instance?

12

VIR. BERKMAN:

Well, ordinarily it doesn't happen

because ordinarily the Court of Appeals and other courts that
preceded this Court --QUESTION:

But they didn’t do it here.

MR. BERKMAN:

-- tfould have ‘made that determination,

because of the determination which the Court made on this
point and also on the concurrent sentence doctrine so that it
didn’t reach the question of community acceptance.
It is true that for the first time since the trial
court the matter is before this Court.
chat is somewhat unusual.

And I would agree that

But I would agree with the

suggestion made by the Government, which was that the issue is
fully developed here and it is possible, if the Court wishes
to make its independent judgment, to make it.
QUESTION:

Supposing we don’t wish to do so, what

would you think the proper course is?
MR, BERKMAN:

Under those circumstances, your Honor,

it would seam to be necessary to remand the case back to the
Ninth Circuit with instructions to consider that issue, or as
a matter of fact, those two issues, with respect to the
application of the material so far as similarity is concerned
as to the other ten counts, and furthermore, the question of
community acceptance.
We think that so far as the question, we know that
we have a burden with respect to the admissibility of evidence.

13

We understand as a result or the decision in Handing and other
cases that in the first instance the trial court can decide
how much material

is confusing or burdensome to the jury,

but we subnit that in this instance the situation is ciear,
that under the circumstances there were two expert witnesses
who testified for the defense and they testified only with
respect to the issues of prurient appeal and social value.
They did not testify -with respect to the issue which is central
tc the proofs that were sought to be introduced by the
defendant with respect to the comparable materials, which is
contemporary community standards with respect to patent
of fensivaness.
In addition, there were a couple of questions shat
were allowed,after a lot were thrown out by the trial court,
with respect to a couple of survey questions that were
permitted on the question of patent offensiveness.

But we

submit that the record was not burdened, that the jury would
not have beer confused.

Onl.y two films were offered and they

were films which had had widespread community acceptance and
we think that under the circumstances, because of the
constitutional dimension

which is involved in allowing a

defendant to make his proofs as to relevant matter, that we
were entitled to have these films introduced and that the
l

prejudice is obvious because it is quite clear that this was
central to the defense of the defendant in this particular

14
instance.
We turn now to tie third question, which has to do
with the charge which was o'fered by the Court to the jury
to consider the appeal of the charged material, not only to
the prurient interest of the average person, but also to
deviant groups.

:he

And we suggest to the Court that we understood

the rale to be as it was enunciated by this Court in
Michigan v. New York, in which the Court said that where the
material is designed for and primarily disseminated to a
clearly defined deviant sexual group rather than the public
at large, then and under those circumstances, the prurient
appeal charge may be enlarged so that the jury may consider
the dominant theme of the material as it appeals to the
prurient interest of members of that deviant group as well as
to the average person.
QUESTION;

in

the absence of expert testimony

that would require deviant members of the jury, wouldn't it?
MR. BERKMANs
QUESTION;

Well —

Unless some members of the jury belonged

to one or more of these dev:1.ant groups, unless they understand
the question.
MR. BERKMAN:

Unless there is some external

evidence — the suggestion that you make, Mr. Justice Stewart,
involves somebody determining somehow on the basis of something
other than mere guesswork and speculation

15
QUESTION:
a

Then under the Michigan test that would be

peculiar case where expert testimony would be desirable,

wouldr.31 it?
MR„ BERKMAN:

It would be desirable.

But in addition

to that, it would seem to me that you could even have non­
expert. testimony with respect to the manner in which the
manufacturer or distributor of the material designed his
material and how it was primarily disseminated and to what
groups other than the public at large.

It would seem to me

that that kind of evidence could come and even without
expert testimony,

bat to fill a. void, a vacuum, if you will,

so that the jury would have some evidence rather than their
own guesswork, their own tendency, their own emotional
feelings about this material, which is a constant problem
to deal with.

And it would seem to me that not only the

expert evidence, but in addition to that, all of the evidence
of the manner in which the materia.*, was distributed, which
.Ls clearly laid out in Michigan.
I would point out that so far as the facts as well
as the- rule of law, which we have just dealt with in Michigan,
i.t is buttressed by those facts in Michigan because there there
'-/as «an abundance of evidence in which the authors cf the
material that were charged were instructed as to the kinds of
•deviate materials which were to be drafted so that their
appeal would be clear and it was obvious that they were to be

16

disseminated to particularised groups and not to the public.
In this instcince we have none of that kind.

And

the Government dwells a great deal upon the fact that there
are little snippets of evidence in various places in the
record which indicate that on cross-examination of defense
witnesses and on the basis of testimony by Dr. Rue in
\

rebuttal for the Government that some suggestions as to appeal
to deviant interest appear in the record.
But that isn't the point.

Appeal to deviant

interest,is not designed for and primarily disseminated to a
group which is not the public at large, and there was no
evidence of anything of that: kind in this record, because
all that went in was the stipulation as to the fact that the
petitioner in this case did with knowledge distribute this
material, to whom it was distributed, the name of the person,
the occupation of such person, and the place where he lived.
Nothing more.
QUESTION:

If the; evidence were only that this

material appealed to people, even under the most stringent
tests that this Court has ever formulated, it's not a criminal
offense to write something that appeals to people, is it?
MR. BERKMAN:

Not that we are aware of, your Honor.

Nevertheless, we have a petitioner who stands before you
waiting four years in the penitentiary for that among other
things.

So it ought not to be, and that is one of the reasons

17

we ara here.
That "among other things "covers quite

QUESTION:

a bit of territory, doesn’t it?

The "among other things"

you referred to covers quite a. bit of territory.
MR. BERKMAN: Indeed.

Indeed.

But we thin?* th~t

if there was error which is of a substantial nature, then
this Court ought to reverse because the proceedings under
which this petitioner was convicted are so tainted that a
new trial is in order.
QUESTION^

Mr. Berkman, is there any difference,

and if so is it. significant, between the word "deviant" and
the word "deviate"?
MR. BERKMAN:

I have been trying to figure that

out ayself in preparation for this case, your Honor.
not sure there is.

I am

And I am certainly not an expert in that

arena sufficiently to know.
QUESTION:

I notice Mr. Justice Harlan used "deviate"

rather than "deviant" in. Manual Enterprises.

Is it commonly

understood in this area of litigation that homosexuals are
a deviate group?
MR„ BERKMAN:

There has been testimony — as a

matter of fact, there is testimony in this case that this is
not w; at would be called a c.eviant group because of the fact
that there are persons who occupy such a position of sexual
preference and who are of sufficient numbers and who are

of

18

sufficient — let me use the word "lack of correctibility
for want of a better phrase — so that they would not be a
deviate group because of their own sexual preference.

There

was testimony from —
QUESTION:

In the trial of this case, there was

some emphasis, I believe, that some of this material was —
at least, there was a box to check if you wanted homosexual
material, something like that.
MR. BERKMAN:
QUESTION:

Yet, your Honor.

Was it assumed before the jury that

homosexuals were a deviate croup?
MR. BERKMAN:

Well, it was argued by the Government

and it was argued —■ and I believe it was testified to quite
frequently and with some

verve by the rebuttal witness, Dr.

Rue, that that was a fact.

The defense testimony was to the

contrary.
Now, in the few moments that remciin, I would like
to —
QUESTION:

I should know from the instruction, but

what about the judge.'s instj action,

hid he identify whether

homosexuals were deviate or not?
MS. BERKMAN:

No, there was no such definition.

And I believe in candor there was no such definition asked
9

for nor received nor offered to the jury.
QUESTION:

By either party?

19

MR. BERKMAN:

I think that's right.

Now, with respect to the last argument which has
to do with the pandering argument, the pandering charge, which
was given to the jury, our argument takes two forms:

First

of all, it is our contentior that because of the amount of
evidence that was in the record, there was no reason to give
a pandering charge at all ir this case; and, secondly, that
after the pandering charge was given •—
QUESTION:

I'm net sure I follow you there.

You

mean the evidence was so overwhelming that you didn't have to
show that it pandered?
MR. BERKMAN:

No, that wasn't the position I

intended to take, your Honor.
QUESTION:

It was not?

MR. BERKMAN:

No.

No.

Our position basically is

that if this Court were to sustain a charge of pandering in
a case of this sort, then it would have gone far beyond the
fact situations in either Michigan or Ginzburg v. United States
in permitting yet another line of attack, so to speak, by the
Government in order to attempt to obtain a conviction.

There

.'nas been no case so far as we know in which this Court has
permitted on the basis of ore thing which we contend to be in
the record at all which even relates to the question of
pandering, and that is the fact that the materials, the
brochures, the advertisements did indicate the sexually

20

provocative nature of the materials which were being offered
for sale*

There is no indication of mass mailing in this

case; there is no indication the materials were mailed to
people who did not: wish to have it, that it was thrust upon
anybody• there is no indication of anything except the
brochures and the materials which were charged themselves and
'which were offered to the jury to show that indeed there was
an appeal to the sexually provocative nature of the material.
QUESTION:

At some point I take it you will deal

with the concurrent sentence aspect in relation to this
problem, not necessarily now.
MR. BERKMAN:

Do it at your own time.

Yes.

MR. -CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think we will recess

until 1 o'clock.
MR. BERKMAN:

All right.

Thank you.

argument was

recessed, to reconvene at 1 p.m. the same day.)

You may use it as you wish.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD A. BERF.MAN
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER (RESUMED)
MR. BERKMAN:

Thank you, your Honor.

I believe just before the lunch break your Honor
asked a. question with respect to the concurrent sentence
doctrine,and the .response that I would give to that is this:
The concurrent sentence doctrine was invoked in
the court below only with respect to the comparison evidence
issue.

If the Court is suggesting that that could conceivably

be invoked with respect to the pandering issue, I would only
suggest to the Court that the pandering charge was specifically
sought to be repeated by the jury in this case and that
shortly after the pandering charge was regiven or reread to
the jury, they returned with a conviction.

It would seem to

me that the possibilities of prejudice are clear from the
record such that in the event the Court should find there was
error, that that error would be of prejudicial proportions.
QUESTION:

In any event, that branch of the

argument is applicable to all the counts, isn’t it?
MR. BERKMAN:
QUESTION:

Of course.

Your client was fined oi. each count.

22
MR. BERKMAN:

Our client was fined on each count.

The Government has conceded the concurrent sentence doctrine
is no; applicable here.

In addition to that, all of the

reasons that were dealt with in Benton and in Sibron with
respect to the prejudice that flows from multiple convictions
would apply in this instance, and we think that really that
issue is foreclosed so far as this Court is concerned.
The Court of Appeals,, of course, did not review
the comparable materials issue;for that reason we think they
were wrong in that regard, and I think the Government so
concedes.
QUESTION:

They ;ust concede it doesn't apply to

one count, don't they?
MR. BERKMAN:

That's right.

That's right.

Their

concession is not the entire; case —•
QUESTION:

So whet if the Government said, "We will

give you back the fine on that count?
MR. BERKMAN:

It seems to me that there are a

number of reasons why —
QUESTION:

Then you are up against whether the

doctrine should just be rejected.
MR. BERKMAN:

We are up against the question of

whether it should be rejected or if the Court does not wish
to reach that broad issue, it is perfectly possible to
conclude; that the taint infected all of the counts, or to

23

conclude that because of the fact that the materials in all
of the counts, even though of a different medium, were
sufficiently similar so that the error, if any, was applicable
to all the counts and that therefore the concurrent sentence
doctrine would not be applicable at all.
So there are a number of ways in which the Court
might resolve the issue.
Returning to the pandering question, we have dealt
with some of the reasons why we think that the Court ought
not to have given the pandering charge at all.

And it seems

to me that there was proof anly of mailing to seven or eight
different people in this case.
that.

There was no proof beyond

Compare that with the millions of pieces of material

that were sent out in Ginzburg, and it would seem to me that
the differences are monumental, they are of kind rather than
degree, and it seems to me that there has been no proof that
the materials: were unsolicited.

And all you have in this

CctSCi

QUESTION:

Mr. Barkman, isn't it perfectly obvious

from the materials themselves that they were designed to
sol:cit buainess?
MR. BERKMAN:

Well, I presume that they were, and

I don’t think that the emphasis was on the sexually provocative
nature of the materials to solicit business.
I know of no case in which this Court has taken

24

the position that that amount of evidence is sufficient tc
allow a charge of pandering in a case of this kind.

It would

have to go beyond what is dene in Michigan and in Ginzburg
in order to accomplish that.
cases in order to do that,

j

It would have to broaden these
believe, your Honor.

Now, the other part of the pandering issue is a
question which we have not yet dealt with, and that is that
after giving the charge, the Court instructed the jury to
consider , that it might consider, as examples the manner of
distribution, circumstances of production, circumstances of
sale, advertising, and editorial intent.

And except for the

advertising itself, we contend that there was no proof of any
of these items in the record for the jury to consider.

They

were left to speculate; they were left to make up their own
minds; they were left to guess with respect to matters of
circumstances of production and distribution which were not
even before them.

And it seems to me that under the circum­

stances in which the emotional concern in this particular area
is of ivonumental variety anyway, that this kind of charge is
of a very dangerous nature end does away with not only
concerns ir. the First Amendment area, but with respect to
all

legitimate criminal c.ue process.

It seems to us as

a consequence that for either or both of these reasons the
pandering charge ought not. to have been given, was of a
prejudicial kind, and therefore should have been rejected.

2:5

This Court has clearly instructed us that,
community outrage cannot be substituted for the sensitive
tools of careful analysis and rigorous procedural safeguards
in the regulation of obscenity.

We think that in this case

tliis Court's admonition has not been followed for the reasons
wh,ich we have advanced here and in our briefs and consequently
we urge that this conviction should be reversed.
1 would like to reserve the remainder of ray time
for rebuttal.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Berknan,

Mr. Feit.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEROME M. FEIT ON
BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. FEIT:
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

Eefore turning :o the principal question in the

case as to the instructions of the trial judge, I would like
to state the Government's position with regard to the concurrent
sentence question.

I would like to give some background.

The district judge initially determined that the
two films were not relevant to the printed material on. the
theory that as courts of appeals have held, a change in milieu
et cetera, make the moving picture not the same as the still,
wo cue spelled out the reasons as to the film itself escept
to say ~~ he saw the 8 millimeter film —•except to say he

doesn't want the jury to see it, or the jury should not see it.
The case got to she court of appeals? the court
of appeals affirmed the determination, as I read the opinion
of the district judge that the films, the alleged comparable
films, were not comparable :o the printed material.

The

court of appeals did, however, determine that it was
comparable or similar to the other film "613.”

However, in

invoking the concurrent sentence doctrine — and we have been
under the mistaken impression that it was applicable and
that the fines were concurrent just as the prison term
the court of appeals said,

'We

don't have to reach the

question of community acceptance because it's not applicable
to the printed material; the concurrent sentence doctrine
applies."
Our position here is that we were in error in
asscrb:jig tc the court that the concurrent sentence doctrine
was applicable since there were cumulative fines.

We further

sugeest, however, that the court in the interest

of judicial

economy,can make the only determination that it has to make,
which was net made by the court of appeals, namely, whether
the film "Deep Throat" and ’Devil in Miss Jones" ware
comparable to "613" in terms of community acceptance rather
than community tolerance.
We would prefer this route because of the judicial
economy notion.

However, of course, that is ultimately up

27
to the Court.
Let me turn then QUESTION:

Mr. Felt, you are suggesting we should

disagree with the court of appeals on "613."
MR. FEIT:

I am. suggesting that the court of appeals

rested its determination on erroneous impression of the
record of the convictions, vhich may well have been our
fault,

I think that this Court can correct that determination

by holding that neither

printed materials nor

"613"

required comparison —
QUESTION:

And wh at if we were to agree Or hold

that the films were comparable?
MR. FEIT:

Our position would be that at most two

QUESTION:

That’s all.

MR. FEIT:

That1s all.

So that the concurrent sentence doctrine

would support the rest.
MR. FEIT:

Right.

There were separate fines on each count.

MR. FEIT:

With respect to this one count.

May I get to the issue which is —

I’m pussled. What else does the

MR. FEIT:

I made a mistake.

I’m not clear I

The only relevance-- let me return to Justice

White's question -- the only relevance of the films that
were sought to be introduced as comparative films go to two
counts.

They don’t in fact relate to anything else,in our

judgment.
QUESTION:

That's because the film is of a different

medium than brochures.
MR. FEIT:

QUESTION:

Now it comes to us.

MR. FEIT:

Our position as stated was that the

mistakenly.

concurrent sentence doctrine has no application to anything
else but the counts involving the "613", and to that extent
you lose two counts at best if it's sent back,

Beyond that,

the concurrent sentence doctrine does not apply.

-urn to what we deem to be the

most significant issue in the case, the alleged offending
portions of the instructions, which is sat out at the
Appendix 57 and 58.
of them,

And essentially there were two aspects

One is the dealing with the sensitive or the

insensitive.

And the court said, "You are to judge these

30

materials by the standard of the hypothetical average person
in the community/ but in determining this average person, you
must include the sensitive end the insensitive."
The second, which, is at the top of 58, the Court
again said, "In determining community standards, you are to
consider the community as a whole, the young and old, educated
and uneducated, the religious and the irreligious, men, women,
and children, from, all walks of life*"
I think, as our representation in our brief makes
clear, we recognize that this is a difficult, and. not 1:o be
praised instruction in our view.
this

As the coizrt below recognised V

creates a grave danger, or some dangerf potential

danger, that the jurors would determine the question of
obscenity in terms of the young.

And clearly they can’t do

that.
In Roth, this Court, its departure point was that
the very thing it wished was to avoid the basic error of
Iiicklin, namely, you lock at. part of the material and you
consider it in terras of the most Susceptible.
There is no question in our mind this is a red flag
word.

And we do not urge this Court to suggest to district

courts or courts of appeals that this instruction should be
followed.
Having said all that, the question
us narrows

it

seems to

to whether this case requires reversal because

31

of the instruction that was given.
The court of appeals felt that it couldn't act on
the matter, that it didn't constitute reversible error, but
it vas for this Court to determine, resting'on an earlier
statement in Ginzburg, which I will get to in a moment.

But

it felt differently, interestingly enough, with regard to the
sensitive.

It had no difficulty with the sensitive.

It had

greet difficulty with the young.
It seems to me,

that if you look at the totality

of the instructions regarding the average person in a
community at large, there were nine references by the
district judge to average person in the community at largo.
In addition, after the court had given these
challenged instructions, on page 60 through 61, he gave the
instruction recommended by Deviet and Blackiaar.
It seams to us that on this record, and wa recognize
that, there is danger.

The Government counsel during the

trial, we think impermissibly, but not reversibly, referred
to is the child rendered unhealthy by reading such material.
And the defense witness said, "Yes."
But we say if you look at the record as a whole,
it cannot be realistically said that the judge intended or
did impress upon the jury that it apply his instructions in
an impermissible way.
Or., the contrary, what the instructions did —

32

young, old, men, women, religious, irreligious, all walks of
life -- essentially was the way the judge defined the entire
community.

Perhaps he should have not defined it, as the

Devifct and Blackmar

instructions suggest.

The Department

recommends an instruction which essentially says, "This judgment
must be mace, of course, in light of the community standards
as applied by the average person with an average and normal
attitude toward an interest in sex.

If you conclude beyond

a reasonable doubt that the average person applying contem­
porary community standards vould find the material taken as
a whole has the tendency described above, you should find
that the film appeals to prurient interest."
Essentially, we think you should not define in
terms of persons.

You might say all persons from all walks

of life, all males and females.

Beyond that I think the

Department feels, lends itself — not in this case, we; think
out lends itself to the kinds of danger that you want to
avoid by rejecting Hicklin.
As an illustrative example, in Ginzburg,-Mr. Justice
Brennan referred to the district court's assessment of how
one determines obscenity as indicating that the court is not
accepting it.

in that case the district court spoke of the

feeble-minded, the psychotic, and the most susceptible.
That’s not this case.

Perhaps even the most

telling factor here is that this very instruction was the kind

33
given in Roth.

Now, it’s true that Roth carae up on specified

questions concerning the constitutionality of statutes, both
Federal and State, but the lourt in its opinion in referring
to this instruction said,

"{the district court)

followed the

proper standard and used the proper definition of obscenity."
The only other case I am aware of in the Federal
system is a case called Manarite out of the Second Circuit
which has also approved this type of charge.
In sum, while we recognize the danger, we urge
this Court to take this case as a whole in terms of the
instructions

in terms of Roth and consider not whether this

instruction is the one that should be given in the future,
but whether in this case the petitioner was prejudiced to such
an extent as to require reversal.
QUESTION:

Mr. Fait, as I understood you, and you

correct me if I an wrong, you are almost conceding that —
well, you are conceding that these were far from perfect
instructions.
MR. FEIT:

No question about it.

QUESTION:

And you are almost asking the Court not

to .approve them as such, bu; simply to affirm this conviction.
MR. FEIT: I think essentially, realistically our
position is that we had difficulty with such an instruction,
although we think here the judge in the way he handled the
instruction plus the Devitt and Blaekmar

charge, plus the

34

Roth consideration, plus the kind of evidence — I might point
out the Court will have the opportunity to view the material,
It's described in our brief.

Even defense counsel during the

time of instructions recognized this was hard core line
material.

As a matter of fact one of the reasons he didn’t

want a pandering instruction was because this was not border!im
material.
That's essentially what I am saying.

We are not

urging the Court to promote this instruction.

us is that this is the very thing that Hicklir;. said, the

does not in our mind warrant a reversal of the conviction

QUESTION:

Mr. Feifc, have you ever seen a perfect

instruction?
MR. FEIT:
Devi;.', and

Biaclaaar

On the: contrary, I must say that the
instruction is hardly perfect..

The

Department of Justice recommendation is hardly perfect.

The

35

trial judge, I am sure, quite understandably, had an awfully
difficult time to formulate an appropriate instruction.
I might add in connection with that, it's another
feature that seems to me this Court should sustain the
v
conviction. This is an area of great difficulty, admittedly.
How does one present that question to the jury?

I think

what the judge did here -- in retrospect maybe the Department
thinks he shouldn't have used the word "young"' — nevertheless
was an obvious attempt for the jury to look at the community
as a whole.
That is essentially our position.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Feit, can I ask you — again, you

will probably say in the context as a whole it's no;

But. on the pandering instruction, would tbs

Department not also agree that the reference to circumstances
of production, sale, and advertising contained ah instruction
that there was no evidence in the record —
MR. FEIT;

Advertising?

QUESTION;

At least the production, circumstances

cf production.

He makes a point that part of the pandering

instruction had no relevance whatsoever to anything in the
record.
MR. FEIT;

First of all, I would say that the

jury was instructed that they would only consider the
pandering

if they needed it to convict.

It's true they came

37

back for a reinstruction on pandering.

After that reinstruction

they were out for an hour and a half.
More specifically directed to your question,, at
best it doesn’t introduce evidence in the case.

The only

evidence of what they had was these circulars, brochures,
advertisements were mailed.

The stipulation pointed that

It didn't implicate —

Isn’t it one of the errors that trial

judges sometimes make, he is instructing on something that
there is no evidence in the record on.
MR. FEIT:

It may be, but I don’t think that

necessarily —- I am not clear if you are suggesting that that’s
reversible.
QUESTION:

No, I’m just saying, you say judge

everything i.r the instructions as a whole.

I say I think

there are probably some other errors in these instructions.
MR. FEIT:

After that instruction it’s quite clear

that there was advertising, as the Court will see when it
looks at the material.

I-;

was somebody advertising the

material we charged for.
QUESTION:
something else?

Wasn’t the advertising advertising

38

MR. FEIT:

No.

‘.'he counts charged, except in

three instances, that the advertising material itself was
obscene.

It wasn't as if the advertising material told you

where to get an obscene publication.
QUESTION:

If the advertising material, itself was

obscene, what, is the relevance of the pandering instruction
as to that material?
MR. FEIT;

Well, the relevance of the pandering

instruction , it seems to me, is that pandering is not, as
the court pointed out, pandering is not a crime.

Pandering

is evidence that -QUESTION:

Maybe I can put it a little differently.

As I understand it, that material could be said to be
pandaring something else,

but what evidence was there that

they were pandering that material?
MR. FEIT:

I guess the material itself was evidence

that :.t was being pandered.

It worked two sides of the line;

it worked both to pander and to be obscene.

I guess they

come together.
QUESTION:

Mr. Fe.it, my question may not be too

clear because some of these things I have had difficulty in
understanding for many years now.

But isn't it true that

whether or not there has been so-called pandering becomes
important only if the material itself is marginal and is
irrelevant if the material is, as you submit it is, hard core,

33
and therefore, that any paniering instruction, even if
erroneous, was inevitably harmless error since this was, if
you are right that this was, so-called hard core material.
Pandering as I —- and you tell me if I am wrong
in my understanding, and I may well be — becomes relevant
only to sustain a conviction of marginal material.
MR. FEIT:

whether the producer, the seller of this material knew what
it was he was selling, by looking at the alleged pandering
material.

Isn't that in the case also?
MR. FEIT:

That is in the case, toe.

Yes, your

Honor.
As I understand petitioner, that is not what he
is arguing.

It seems to me what he is saying is that the

more the material is clearly obscene on its face, pandering
evidence becomes somehow less relevant and then somehow more
prejudicial.

The closer it is to the line, for example

the

Gin burg material,the pandering becomes more significant.
And I find that, as the Chief Justice indicated, a
fail, ly strange analysis that somehow evidence becomes less

40

relevant because — unless :-.t’ s so damaging -— becomes less
relevant the harder core the material becomes„
QUESTION:

Under the cases it’s just the opposite,

MR. FEIT:

Right,

QUESTION:

And scienter is something else.

isn't it?

But

pandering as identified in the Ginzburg case was the element
that, as I understood it at the time, allowed a conviction
in that case of more or less marginal material, isn't that
correct?
MR. FSIT:

What the instructions say in Hamling

and Ginzburg runs that line, that is, if you feel as you look
at the material itself and .f you feel it's close to the
borderline, you may then —
QUESTION:

Then you may consider pandering.

MR. FEIT:

QUESTION:

But if it’s hard core material, as you

subir.it this is, then pandering vel non is irrelevant, isn't
that right under 1;he cases?
MR. FEIT:

I assume it’s irrelevant, but hardly

prejudicial.
QUESTION:

Mir. Felt, I wasn't here at the time of

Gin::burg, sc I can’t make the same statement that my brother
Stev.ari just made as to how he understood it, but I am
inclined to agree with your earlier statement that if

41

something is relevant in a marginal case, taking it over the
margin,it surely doesn’t lose its relevancy in a less marginal
case.
MR. FEIT;

See, it’s not —■ I think what Justice

Stewart was saying to me was by definition if it's obscene ,

the Government has every right to in any criminal case, except
that the Court thinks —
QUESTION;

It would be overtrying its case.

MR. FEIT;

It would be overtrying its case.

If

that is what the argument is. overtrying its case, that’s
something else, it seems to me.
I don’t understand the argument that somehow it’s
immaterial the more — not immaterial, but somehow something
else happens to it when the material itself is hard core.
QUESTION:

Right.

Right.

Now, in this case what

was clear was that this material was commercially advertised

Beyond

that was there any evidence whatever of the kind of pandering

QUESTION:

Doesn fc that automatically get over

into pandering?
MR. FEIT:

Does

Yes.

I would like to quickly address myself to the deviant
appeal argument.

As I understand petitioner’s brief, they

don't argue that the instruction on deviant appeal — by the
way, Mr, Justice, "deviate" is the noun and "deviant" is the
adjective.

They mean the same thing except as parts of

speech they are somewhat different.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

MR. FEIT:

OK.

The court instructed the jury, correctly we submit,
that •— I think this flows directly from if ami ing

that if it

44
finds petitioners guilty,, if the intended and probable
recipients, was an appeal to the prurient interests of the
average person of the community as a whole or the prurient
interest of the members of a deviant sexual group at the time
of the mailing.
This

clearly, if one looks at this material, the

deviant nature of the persons to whom some of this material
was advertised clearly fall with any accepted class of
deviates or deviant appeal out of decisions of this Court.
I think this is made clear 3y Hamling, and I rely on Hamling,
clear by Splawn, I rely on Splawn, and finally clear in Ward v.
T j 1. .i .no i? who re something called "Bizarre World" and "A
Study of Sado-Masochism" and testimony of a police officer
justified a deviant instruction,
I would like to say something, Mr, Justive Stevens,
if I may, I think it was your question as to whether that
audience of the average normal person,

it is not clear who

made the -- this Court can judge deviant material properly.
In Paris Adult Theater v. Slaton case, this Court had a
footnote to that effect.

They were concerned that in some way

out, very bizarre fetish — that's not this case.

This case

.fits the traditional deviant notion, if there is such a
thing as a traditional deviant notion.
QUESTION:

That's what I was going to ask.

How

is the- jury supposed, to determine whether or not the material

45
has a prurient appeal to the non-average person?
MR. FEIT:

I say, Mr. Justice

I guess this is a

cop-oat ■— that's the intractable problem of obscenity that
Mr. Justice Harlan

talked about.

I think it's a very difficult job.

I think they

qo to their communities and make a judgment of what the
overall feeling there is and come away as well as they can.
That they cannot draw precise lines, I fully agree.
QUESTION:

You say they can3t draw precise lines.

How do they even get their foot on first base?
MR. FEIT;

I think most people ~~

QUESTION:

By hypothesis your jury is disqualified,

it seems to me, from understanding what would appeal to
persons different from them,
MR. FEIT:

The Court in Hamling rejected that

proposition.
QUESTION:

So what you are saying in effect is

even if it's a totally irrational holding, we should just
follow it.
MR. FEIT:

No.

I'm saying that if it's a totally

way out deviant question, that is open, in Paris Theater.
But if it deals with the kind of — I hate to say traditional
the k..rcl of regularized material in the deviant category, as
dealt with in Michigan, sadomasochism, bondage, pedophilia,
it's all in this case.

They are all here.

And I don't think

46

it's that hard for a jury tc lock at that kind of material.
QUESTION:

Let me ask one other.

Is it well

settled that the homosexual group is a deviant group within
this category of cases?
MR. FEIT:

I guess — there was no instruction as

co the category of v/hat deviant -- I think the answer is the
Court did not instruct the jury that deviant appeal has to
he homosexual, group sex, or whatever.

It. said a deviant.

I think it depends upon what that community, here the central
district of California, determines to he deviant.

If the

central district of California, according to the jurors of
this case, determine that homosexuality is deviant, I assume
It’s deviant.
QUESTION:

So the community standards qualification

or test, or whatever it is, that also is controlling in
determining v/hat is deviant.
MR. FEIT:

Yes.

I think that's right.

QUESTION:

Has the Court ever said that?

MR. FEIT:

I think in effect it said so in Hamling,

yes, as I read it.
For the reasons stated, the Government respectfully
submits that the judgment of conviction should be affirmed.
Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD A. BERKMAN

MR. BERKMAN:

I ion3t know what I can do with that,

but 1st me just say this to the Court:

Apparently because

there are difficulties involved, the Government urges than
the Government's position ought to be understood and that
the Court tried as a matter of bona fides to do the right
thing.
There were a number of errors that were admitted
by the court of appeals, admitced by die Government, ana Mr.

It seems to me this Court has an obligation to right these
