MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 77-293 , Julko v. Superior Court of California.
Mr. Stotter, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE H. STOTTER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. STQTTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case arises in an action for child support in
the State of California as a consequence of the departure of
two children from the custody of their father and the home
that they had enjoyed all of their lives in the State of New
York.
The matter comes baforo you as. a final judgment of
the Supreme Court of California under California rules which
permit us to bifurcate issues of jurisdiction and challenge
those up through the courts which is done by a write of mandate
and was done in this case.
We submit that this Court has jurisdiction by virtue
of the nature of the California statuta which is involved in
this particular case.
states:

In particular, this particular statute

"A court of this state may exercise jurisdiction on

any basis not inconsistent with the Constitution of this state
or of the United States.”
In the legislative judicial counsel comments, the

4
legislature adopted the statement that the sufficiency of such
contact is a matter of constitutional law on which the Supreme
Court of the United States has the final voice.

So as a conse­

quence of this particular action before you? there is almost a
coexistence between the construcfcion of the statute and its
application.
I might submit to the Court that I think there is a
question with respect to the omnibus type of statute in terms
of it being an improper delegation of the legislative duty to
the courts or possibly even vagueness? but that has not been
the approach raised by the appellant in this case.

The ap­

proach in this particular case is how this statute is applied
as being unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment.
We also subnit that the issue of mootness raised by
the appellee is not appropriate in this case because in fact
in each case at each level? this was raised solely on special
appearance to challenge the jurisdiction of the court.

The

trial court so found at ^ach level that this was an issue of
special appearancei, even afte*. the proceedings the trial court
found that we had appeared only by special appearance.

And I

might add that in the Titus case cited by us? the specific act
of advising the court after it had already denied a motion to
quash that the matter was going up on appeal and did not have
jurisdiction? was found by the Appellate Court to not consti­
tute an appearance at that time.

5

Lastly, Your Honors, we submit that the issue of
mootness is inappropriate in a situation or in a society in
which there has generally been an attitude of expanding juris­
diction and which —
QUESTION:

Mr. Sfcotter, could I interrupt you here at

this point?
MR. STOTTER:
QUESTION:

Certainly, Justice Blackmun.

Anywhere or at any time was ever any

attack made on the decree, the Haitian decree of divorce in
this case?
MR. STOTTER:

No, sir, arid that was the decree in

which the appellee moved to be established in California in
the initial action filed in California.
QUESTION:

Do you think it is invulnerable to attack

at this late date?
MR. STOTTER:
QUESTION:

\

You do?

MR. STOTTER:
QUESTION:

I do, sir.

Yes, sir.

It recites on its face that both parties

are domiciled and residant other than in Haiti?
MR. STOTTER:

I think, Justice Blackmun, that there

is enough authority both in New York and in California that
these parties would be estopped to take a position inconsistent
with their joint acts in going to Haiti and therefore I cer­
tainly would not have advised that by my client and I would

6
imagino the other slue
QUESTION:

Have both paries remarried?

MR. STOTTER:
QUESTION:

take the same position.

Yes, sir,

The doctor, too?

MR. STOTTER:

Yes, sir.

Lastly, as I was saying, it would seem to me that
many of the commentators seem to suggest that to test issues of
jurisdiction, we should not be engaged in a type of wager at
law in which we act at our peril in trying to test out juris­
diction.
Certainly the- attempt her© in no case was there ever
an attempt by the appellant to deal with the merits.
QUESTION:

I thought your argument basically is that

California law allows special appearances without waiver —
■

MR. STOTTER:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

and that is what the procedure was that

you followed here.
MR. STOTTER:
QUESTION:

Precisely.

(

Well, isn't that the complete answer?

MR. STOTTER:

I think so..

Now, in this particular

case, the appellant, Ezra Kulko, differs materially from the
typo of parties which have generally been before this Court in
state court jurisdiction cases relating to non-residence.
We have here an average citizen, a family man-, engaged
in common family interactions.

He is not a corporation, he is

7
not involved in doing business or acts for economic benefits
such as generally all the cases that have been involved in
this matter in fchs past have been involved.
This is the type of individual that strikes all
across the breadth of this country’s activities,, from the
penthouse to the ghetto there are people engaging in the split
of their family and entering into marital settlement agree­
ments of the type engaged in this particular ease.

And 1 sub­

mit that the activities of this particular party or both of
these parties are acts that are going on by thousands of
citizens across the country monthly, if not weekly.
Second, Dr. Kulko in this case is both a resident
and a domiciliary of the State of New York.

He was born,

educated, married, established his home there.

For all intents

aid purposes, with a few exceptions, he has never left the
state.

He is not the typical father who has departed from the

domicile state in order to escape his obligations.

He has

remained in the state of the marital domicile.
In this particular case, on the contrary, it is the
appellee, the wife who has departed from the domicile state,
who has attained in essence, to use what some of the commen­
tators talk about as the migratory or suitcase divorce
the consent of the husband.

with

And in addition, it should be

borne in mind that each of the two children at two year
intervals also departed from the State of New York and from the

8
residence of the father by t sir apm choice»
Now, in addition, we have here, recognition that at
the time of the filing of Mrs. Horn’s complaint, the father was
the legal custodian of both of these two children by virtue of
a marital settlement agreement which, if Your Honors please,
was negotiated, prepared, executed and carried out in the
State of New York by Mrs, Horn’s attorney, Dr. Horn not being
represented by choice, and which Mrs. Horn flew from California
to New York in order to execute and complete the negotiations
of that particular agreement.

to the parties and their agreement as negotiated in New York,
there is a great deal of importance to the ties that New York
would give to its contracts and certainly to its negotiated
marital settlement agreements.
It is significant# I submit# that it was Mrs. Kulko
who departed from New York to obtain the decree and subsequent
ly was married in the State of California# under circumstances
which# based on her residence in California, she could have at
the time obtained the typical type of nonfault divorce for
dissolution allowed by California, but she chose instead to
come east and go through the arrangements at that particular
time.

So she had the option at that time of getting jurisdic­

tion in the State of California

QUESTION;

But the issue we have to decide is whether

Dr. Kulko did anything in California that subjected him to in
personam jurisdiction in the United States, isn’t that right?
MR. STOTTER;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

When are you going to get to that?

MR. STOTTER;

I will in a moment, sir.

I think that

the Court should recognize that one of the major issues in­
volved her© is whether the contacts required to establish

12
personal jurisdiction under Titernational Shoe should be of a
more substantial type or nature in domestic or family law pro­
ceedings than those existing in other cases.

And I submit

to

Your Honors that this is made particularly clear by the re­
statement of section 37.
In the restatement, Your Honors,

section 37, which

deals with the question of doing an act having effect else­
where, they talk about three times, intent, foreseeability and
no intent.

When one reads all of the statements made by the

Commissioners, in intent we are talking about the shooting of
a missile or a bullet?

in foreseeability, we are talking about

loaning your car to be driven by somebody else across state
lines, or putting explosives that might have an effect.

None

of these types of circumstances were clearly contemplated by
the Commissioners when they adopted this particular type of
criteria.
Significantly,in the caveat to this restatement, they
. .

i

talk about defamation possibly being an exception that should
be handled differently with more substantial types of matters,
raising in essence questions of free speech.

And I submit to

Your Honors that in this particular case, the question of in­
vasion of privacy, the decision of the rights of the family to
decide where their children should live is significantly appro­
priate.
QUESTION;

You are here attacking the judgments of

13
California, and I think it would, be very helpful to us, it
certainly would be to me if you would tell me what it is that
is wrong about California's assertion of jurisdiction based
upon their contact with tin children and the wife?
MR. STOTTER:

Well, if Your Honor please, California

had two lower court cases both of which rejected the concept
that these type of acts were essentially the type of acts that
were contemplated by this type of a criteria.

It is our con-

...

\

tention that Dr. Kulko really passively went along with the
daughter who decided that she wanted to come to California, and
we submit if Your Honors .look that in the pleadings here,
paragraph 10 of the original complaint filed in here makes a
Specific allegation that the father threatens to remove the

children from the State of California and asks for a restrain­
ing order.

At that particular time, when the original plead-

ing was filed, the trial. qo/arfc issued a restraining' order
against the removal of both of those children, so that we sub­
mit that the suggestions;<made by the California Supreme Court
that this was a voluntary act or a. consent by the father to
send hi;-, children into, tlis State of California is untrue.
What we are involved with' is a situation where *—
■i; '

QUESTION:

But didn't the father pay for the air fare?

MR. STOTTER:
QUESTION:

■ V

Yes, sir.

isn't that consent?

MR. STOTTER:

Hot in the traditional situation, Your

14
Honor»

Let me put it this way:

We have hare a considerate

concerned father who was attempting to work out in the family
interaction what would be the bast solution for the children.
Mow, on the other side, if we replace a father who is obstin­
ate, who would not pay anything, who would not cooperate, I
think this Court would therefore say that the non-cooperative
litigant type father would have done no acts and therefore not
be subject to jurisdiction.

But the father who is facing

reality and who says, when the daughter says I want to live
with my mother, okay, if that is your choice, I think you are
wrong but I will buy you a ticket and I wish you well, the
court in California was saying that is a type of act confer­
ring jurisdiction.
QUESTION;

The mother in this case sought first an

in personam money judgment against your client, did she not?
MR. STOTTER:

There is no proceedings relative to

any action filed by the mother at any time claiming in the
State of Mew York or anywhere else, claiming that the father
was indebted to her for some act or acts.
QUESTION:

Well, what did the mother seek in her

action in the Superior Court of California?
MR. STOTTERs

The mother sought only to establish the

Haitian decree and to establish child support prospectively.
This was not an action «•QUESTION:

Didn’t she have to increase her interests?

IS
MR. STOTTER:

QUESTION:

Yea.

Wall, that is a little different from what

you just said.
QUESTION?

Well, that is an in personam money jud gr­

in ent.
MR. STOKERs

That’s correct# she was asking for an in

personam money judgment in the future.
QUESTION %

Also custody of the children?

MR. STOTTER:

And also custody of the children,, which

we did not contest, so the issue comas before the Court solely
on her right to seek through California courts a larger sura of
money *
QUESTION:

Well, the real question is did the

California court have personal jurisdiction over your client,
that is the case?
MR. STOTTER:

That's right.

That's the very bottom issue.

But the answer to that question may turn

on whether simply an -adjustment of custody was 'sought and
whether an in personam money judgment was sought, may it not?
I mean they differ*
MR. STOTTERs

Tt does differ.

Traditionally the courts

have viewed questions of custody.as relating solely to issues
of status, and they have viewed questions of money judgment as..

QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

And the question is did the court have

That is the question we have,

MR. STOTTERs
QUESTION;

Yes.

I mean as a matter of constitutional law,

could the court assart jurisdiction over your client.
MR. STOTTER:

And the position of tha appellant is

no, because the appellant has absolutely no contact with the
State of California --QUESTION:

Exactly.

MR. STOTTERs

'-- in any respect, has never entered

California in any circumstance, was not doing business, did not
do an intentional act of the type which this Court has found
applies in tha economics sphere in other types of cases.

We

are involved in this particular case with the interaction be­
tween families and which we submit would have a very counter
affect when families are left with the decision that by being
cooperative, they would thereby be conferring jurisdiction.

We

17
jsut don't feel that that measures up tq the standards which
this court has submitted in the past.
I might add that another aspect of this relates to
the question of the foreseeability type circumstances which'
Justice Stevens mentioned in the Shaffer case, in which he
equates fair notice to include fair warning, and I submit
that as a general rule parents dec Ming that allowing their
children who have asked to go with another parent do not
'thereby have knowledge or are aware of the fact that they are
conferring jurisdiction in court 3,000 miles away to decide
how much money they may have to pay in the future.
I also submit to the Court the question that ordin­
arily one thinks in terms of the state's right to protect the
children that are within its domicile.

In this particular case,

there is no determination that th® amount of money awarded in
New York might not already have been sufficient, and that
really would be a question of just how wall the children should
live.
;

(

Under those particular circumstances, it is not a
decision that those children were somehow going to be throw*
into poverty.

We have the Uniform Reciprocal Support Act and

the right of a mother to, as she did at the time of the marital
settlement agreement, to come back to New York in the first
instance, have Maw York cattle her particular running problems.
In this particular case, she judiciously chose to

18

avoid New York, presumably because she felt that she would not
bo treated wall in New York because essentially she had
abandoned New York.
QUESTIONS

Except - Mr. S tot ter, I suggest that: what

she did or didn't do is not relevant to the question we have
to decide.

We have to decide whether he did# as the California

Supreme Court held, is suffice to subject him in personam
jurisdiction in California.

Do you quarrel with the tests

that the California Supreme Court laid: down?

Did he purposely

avail himself of the benefits and protections of California
laws or anticipate that he would derive an economic benefit or
a result of his act outside of California?

Do you quarrel

with that test?
MR. STOTTERs
QUESTIONS

Yes, sir.

Oh, I see.

MR. STOTTER:

I don't quarrel with the test.

I

quarrel with the fact .that. -QUESTIONS

With its application?

MR. ST OTTER;
QUESTION;

That's correct.

And as I understand it, the way they

applied it was, it said that probably no parental act more
fully invokes the benefits and protections of California law
than that by which a parent permits his minor child to live in
California.

We start with a premise of a non-resident parent

who allows his minor child or children to reside in California,

19
has by that act purposely availed himself of the benefits and
protections of the laws of California,

Do you quarrel with

that?
MR. STOTTBR:

Not as a fact.

If seams to me that

the Court does have a concern relative to the choice of law,
a question c-f protecting children that are -QUESTION?

As I understand it, what the court did was

then go on to say what he did in letting his daughter come and
buying her the airline ticket, and those other facts, they
established that he had committed an act in New York which had
the affect of allowing his children to reside in California
and that thus he had purposely availed himself of the benefits
and protections of the laws of California and therefore under
the test, which you say you don't quarrel with, that that
established a basis for in personam jurisdiction.
MR. STOTTER5

Well, Justice Brennan, the question of

the purposeful naturo X guess is the factual question which
under this particular statute is/submitted to this particular

f

Court and ■—
QUESTION:

You want us to decide the factual question?

MR. STOTTER:

No, sir.

It seems to me that it is

inappropriate to do so and as a consequence it seems that to
place the father in a position where he must act at his peril
in making the type of act which one would presume that any
concerned father would make, when confronted with a decision

20

by a young child that says I want to go with my mother.

Now,

having this being the state ox the marital domicile,tinder all
circumstances this particular father had two choices, either
was to litigato, denying the request of the child and enter
into litigation in New York, or force litigation in New York,
or cooperate in terms of allowing the child to go live with
the mother, and I submit that that is not the type of purpose­
ful activity for obtaining the privileges and benefits in the
State of California which this Court has generally treated in
the past.
QUESTION:

Of course, the Supreme Court distinguished

between the daughter and the son, saying that the father had
done nothing in New York which had the effect of committing
the son to California in the same way that he had done with
the daughter.
MR. STOTTER:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Therefore they refused to accept or say

there was no jurisdiction as to the increased support for the
son, but only as to the daughter, isn't that correct?
MR. STOTTER:

No, Mr. Justice Brennan, they made a
‘jl

decision to the effect that while they recognised there was no
contact, since they already had contact with the daughter, and
since they fait the .jurisdiction of the father was established
by virtue of his single act of buying that ticket, they there­
fore

said we therefore will also apply it to the son as well.

21
QUESTIONS

They finally wind up, "We deem it fair and

reasonable to subject him to the personal jurisdiction for
the support of both children, where ha has committed acts
with respect to one child, which confers personal jurisdic­
tion, and has consented to the permanant residence of the
other child.”
MR, STOTTER:
QUESTION;

Because, as they say —

You're right, tha judgment is finally

enter© for support for both.
MR. STOTTER z

And they basically say that he con­

sented bo tha son because he didn't commence an immediate
action, even though at the time he was under a restraining
order from the State of California against him removing those
children.
QUESTION;

Mr. Sfcofctor, the airline ticket, x*as it

round-trip?

,

MR, STOTTER;
QUESTION;

One way?

MR. STOTTER;
QUESTION;

No, sir, it, vras a one-way ticket.
'

That8 s corr eet.

Well, how did he expect the child to get

back?
MR. STOTTBE;

He had hoped that the child would

recognize that life with the mother would not be as idyllic
as she thought it would be and that by giving her an opporr

trinity for her day in California, so to speak, she would see

22

•that life in California
QUESTION?

a net. as good as life in New York.

The answer to my question is how would

the child get back, walk?
MR. STOTT®:

I think the child was simply to call

the father and say in much the same way, I would like to come
back to New York, and a ticket instantly would have been
available.
QUESTION:

Mr. Stotter, earlier you mentioned there

might be a difference between jurisdiction to award a money
judgment and jurisdiction to determine custody.

Paragraph 3

of the complaint asks just for modification of the decree to
award permanent custody to the wife.
that asks for money.

Paragraph 4 is th© one

'Do you concede that there is jurisdic­

tion to grant the relief provided in paragraph 3:?
MR. STOTT®!

Yes, w© have conceded that for purposes

of the proceedings that wa brought.

We at the trial court

level raised questione that the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdic­
tion Act certainly as to Darwin would not apply. ' 'On the other
hand, it was the advice of counsel, myself in this case,- that
a. decision of a child certainly of this age would be very
persuasive on a court and therefor© that th© Issue of juris­
diction should not he challenged on that issue.

So th©

question of custody was- .not rained and I think there is 'no
issue here relative to th© custody question.
QUESTION:

But that didn’t involve a matter of

23

personal jurisdiction?
MR. STOTTER;

That's correct.

I think custody is a

type of status which can be handle! —
QUESTION:

But the relief prayed for in that para­

graph would result in a modification of the decree , of the
settlement agreement between the parties, wouldn't it?
MR. STQTTERs

That's correct, and relief as to terms

of custody might well be granted without getting into money
judgments at all.
QUESTION;

It almost would follow inevitably under

this settlement, as I understand it, that there would be some
.increase in th© support money because the support under the
agreement was calculated .on the basis of temporary time with
th© wife.

Wasn’t that correct?
MR. STOTTERs

I think there was no question about

•the fact that both California and Now York as a choice of law
issue would have recognised that these ahiMr©h:Wsre entitled'
* T:

■bo support.

The issue is can California make a determination

as to what the father should pay as distinguished from her
going back to Maw York and the marital domicil.©, which has
generally bean very highly respected in family law proceedings
and which great importance has always been stressed in order
to determine what the amount of child support should be.
QUESTION%

Well, can a California court constitu­

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SUSIS S. THORN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MS. THORNs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
I would like to begin by making three corrections
which I believe are relevant to the facts.

Dr. Kulko was

served in parson and not by mail, as suggested in some of the
briefs —
QUESTION:

VJhafc difference doss it make, no one is

\
challenging the decree now, are they?
MS. THORN:

That's correct.

Secondly, a very relevant

fact is —
QUESTION:
MS. THORNi
QUESTION:
MS. THORNs

He was served in this litigation?
Yes, in New York.
In Ngw York?
In New York, y@ss.

25
QUESTION:
MS. THORN:

Okay.
Secondly, the daughter, Ilea, was eleven

and a half years old at the time that she asked to live with
her mother and her father participated with her in that change
of custody,

therefore, to suggest that it was a unilateral

act does not seem appropriate.
Further, Dr. Kulko was represented by an attorney at
the time of the New York settlement agreement.
I would like to address myself first to the question
of jurisdiction of this Court with regard to this matter.
Throughout the entire proceedings through the California
Supreme Court, there was no attack made on the California
statute either on its face or as applied.

We therefore sub­

mit that appeal is not applicable here.
QUESTION:

But we can still treat it as certiorari,

can't we?
MS. THORN:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

The defendant moves to quash the summons on the
ground that the court lacked personal jurisdiction because he
was a non-resident, without sufficient contacts in California
to satisfy due process requirements.
Furthermore, the circumstances of this case ai~e most
unusual, as are outlined in the brief for the appellee.

They

are unlikely to occur again and do not raise issues of national
impar tance.

26

I would like to address myself secondly to the issue
V

of mootness.
t

QUESTION:

You don’t suggest there isn't a federal

question then, it is just one on which it isn’t a proper
appeal and we should deny certiorari?
MS. THORN:
QUESTION:
MS. THORN:
QUESTION:

Yes , Your Honor,
Is that what you are suggesting?
I am suggesting —
But are you also saying it is not a sub­

stantial federal question?
MS. THORN:

I am suggesting that it is not a substan­

tial federal question, Your Honor, because of the unique
happenstance of the facts in the situation.
QUESTION:

Well, I would think Justice White’s ques­

tion and the Chief Justice's question pose two quite different
inquiries.

One is whether it is the kind of case that would

recur frequently that this Court would want to exercise dis­
cretionary .jurisdiction, and' the other is whether there is any
federal, substantial federal claim here at all» even though the
case is a .real sport.

Is your answer to "both of those ques­

tions no or both yes or
MS. THORN:

■

I think my answer to one would ba no.

Would you repeat the second; one, Justice Rehnquist?
QUESTION:

Well, I can conceive of a case where there

might ba a vary substantial constitutional claim in the sense

27

that a party litigant has had a constitutional right violated,
and yet nonetheless one would way this is a set of facts that
is never going to recur, and this Court only takes 150 cases
a year and we simply wouldn't grant certiorari in a case like
that.

But if it were an appeal as a right, we would probably

not feel free to say there is no substantial federal question.
MS. THORN:
QUESTION:

I would answer yes to the second question
You say that there really isn't any really

doubtful federal question in the case, even though it were to
recur time and again, it should be resolved in favor of state
j ur isd ic fcion ?
MS. THORN:

I am saying, Your Honor, that this is a

unique sat of facts that doesn't justify the Court in assuming
jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Now, let rae ask you about that.

Suppose

the settlement agreement here had given the custody to the
parents and at ‘the time the woman was residing in California,
which she was.
MS. THORN:
QUESTION:

Yes, she was.
So there was an agreement, essential agree

ment that would be embodied in the decree that the wife would
have custody.
MS. THORN:
QUESTION:

Correct.
So by consent under this agreement, the

little girl or the children would be residing with the ex-wife

2e

in California and there is an agreed upon amount for support,
and then tile wife sues in California to increase support and
serves the husband in New York.
MS. THORNs
QUESTION?

Jurisdiction?

I think that raises a different case.
Well, why is it different if the husband

has in advance agreed to take advantage of California law?
MS. THORN:
QUESTION:

I would say that —
All I am bringing it up for is I would

think it would occur time and time again, this question.
MS. THORN:

I would answer that by saying in this

case we have a substantial change in the status of the children
after the making of the agreement.
QUESTION:

Well, that may be so, but what has that

got to do with jurisdiction?
MS. THORN:

I think it has to do with the reasonable-

ness of the contacts which led the California Supreme Court to
feel that the exercise of jurisdiction was reasonable in this
case.
QUESTION s

Do you think the California Supireme Court

either in retired Justice Sullivan's opinion to the court or in
Justice Richardson's dissenting opinion, that the members of
the court felt that they ware dealing with a constitutional
issue, a federal constitutional issue?
MS. THORN:

I think they felt they were dealing with

idle application of the Code of Civil Procedure for —-

29

QUESTION:

Justice Richardson, in his dissenting

opinion, begins by saying, "In ray vlev;, it is unreasonable to
subject petitioner to the jurisdiction of the California
courts, under the circumstances in this case,” and then he goes
on with the facts and so on, and he never is explicit in saying
that in his view it is unconstitutional.
MS. THORN:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Nor indeed does Justice Sullivan's opinion

deal with the question as though it were a constitutional ques­
tion.
MS. THORN:

That is correct.
Was it presented to that court as a con­

stitutional question?

MS. THORN:
QUESTION:
MS. THORN:

Yes.
—■ not a matter of somebody's position?
That is a matter of fact, Justice Stewart

It was not presented that way to the California Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

Ms. Thorn, doesn’t the California Supreme

Court expressly say that the limits of the statute are defined
by the Constitution —
QUESTION:

Where is that?

QUESTION:

On page v of the jurisdictional statement,

it points out that the "court of this state may exercise juris­
diction on any basis not inconsistent with the Constitution of
this state or of the United States,” and later that the case
that the statute has construed '’manifests an intent that the
courts of California utilise all such bases, limited only by
constitutional considerations."
MS. THORN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Didn’t the court necessarily decide a con­

stitutional question when it decided over jurisdiction?
MS. THORN:

I think it was inferring that decision

was limited by constitutional perimeters, that .it was not
really construing the Constitution in this particular situation

MS. THORN:

So you

Didn't you recognise due process?

1 think it would be fair to say that,

Justice Marshall.
QUESTION:

In fact, analysis of the California court

is whether International Shoe or Hanson v. Denckla require a
different result, and those are federal cases.
MS. THORN;

That's correct, Justice Stevens.

I would like to move to the issue of raootness, if I
may.
QUESTION:

Before you go to that, since we have got

you interrupted anyway, let me sure I understand your position.
Suppose we have two different cases, one the case we actually
have and the second case in which the settlement agreement
itself said the children shall be given to the mother, be in
the custody of the mother, who shall reside in California, and
that is all it said, and then had agreed upon amounts.

And

then thereafter the mother” brought suit to increase the support
allowance.

Would that be a stronger or a weaker case for

jurisdiction in California under your view?
MS, THORN;

Well, it would be weaker in the sense

that there would have been less acts by the father causing in
effect •—
QUESTION;

But there would have been a clear consent

32

to the children being there, unambiguous and all of that, and
he paid the tickets?
MS. THORN:

It would be strong in the sense that the

contract was to be performed there in many instances.
QUESTION:

Well, actually the children's presence

xvould certainly be the effect of his having made and signed
that agreement in New York, wouldn't it?
MS. THORNs
QUESTION:

That's correct.
How wonId the issue be any different than

the ona wa have now?
MS„ THORNs

Well, only that the contract that we

have in the instant case was to be performed partly in
California, because he was to pay support there when the
children were in her custody.
QUESTION;

Well, partly or not, if you are for the

Superae Court's test of whether or not he committed the
children to the benefits of California laws, under the agree­
ment ha did, didn’t he?

That's correct.

lived in California —

California and the father was ordered to pay and mail to
California $3 00 a month for child support.

A contract.
Let me give you another one.

Justice White, to get weaker because there are not the contacts
with Oregon that we have with California.

that he in effect sent the children and submitted them to the
custody of the State of California and all its protections?

MS. THORN:
QUESTION:

For jurisdiction.
I sea.

MS. THORN:

But I think we have the intervening force

here of active acts on the part of the father which resulted in
these children being residents of the state and needing to be
supported in California.
QUESTION:
the active acts.

Ms. Thorn, let me ask you a question about

Let's assume, for example, that the husband

had not paid the air fare of the daughter to California, what
acts would you then rely upon?
MS. THORN:

Had not paid her air fare, had not sent

her with her clothing?
QUESTION:

Well, the facts are clear, I take it, that

the daughter asked to go back to her mother or to go to her
mother in California.
MS. THORN:

Yes.

The other acts would be with respect

to the boy, the father called the Social Service Agency in San
Francisco, and that is in the record, and requested that that

36
Social Service Agency investigate —
QUESTION:

Because

he had run away, hadn’t she?

Hadn't he run away from, the father?
MS. THORN:

No, he had left but he had told the father

that he was going.
QUESTION?

The Supreme Court said that as to the boy,

what the father did would not subject the father to in personam
jurisdiction.
MS. THORNS
QUESTION?

They said that —
They finally brought him in on the increase

support order, but had there only been the boy apparently there
would have been no in personam jurisdiction sustained.
MS. THORN:

That is correct under the opinion.

How-

ever, I was pointing out same acts that he did take with regard
to the boy.

He had the Social Service Agency investigate the

home and make a report to him.

He then wrote a letter to the

mother, which is part of the record, saying we must renegotiate
our bargain because it is no longer applicable to the circum­
stances as they have developed.
QUESTION?

Are you saying writing a letter was

activity in California?

He was in New York when he wrote the

letter?
MS. THORN?
QUESTION:

Yes.
And you say writing a letter to somebody

in California is activity in California of a kind that will

37
submit you to the jurisdiction of a California court to order
you to pay money?
MS. THORN:

Certainly not standing alone, but I be­

lieve it V7as a recognition by him that he had by his activity
done acts in California and that he realised he had to change
their agreement.

AFTERNOON SESSION - 1;Q0 0 s CLOCK
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

MS. THORN:

Ms. Thorn, you may proceed.

I would like to raise nesst the case of

McGee v. International Life and point out that in that case
the Court found that one contact with the State of California
was sufficient in the case of an insured under a life insurance
contract.
QUESTION:

Ms. Thorn, I think you were before lunch

going to start — you started to address when we interrupted
you your point as to the fact that the husband in this case
waived his claim by making a general appearance.

Were you

going to do that?
ME. THORN:
QUESTION:

Yes, I was going to address
Do it whenever you wish during the course

of your argument, but I would ba interested in what you have
to say.
MS. THORN:

With regard to the issue of mootness,

the California Supreme Court opinion was fild on Kay 26, 1977
and became final on June 25th.

Appellant did not move for

stay of the filing of the Supreme Court of California opinion
and thus allowed the Superior Court for the City and County of
«

San Francisco to reacquire jurisdiction.

We followed with a

motion for various matters, including support and for a deter­
mination of the very substantial arrearage that Dr, Kulko was
in in terms of support payments even under the agreement.

39
The appellant here filed a written response labeled
"A Special Appearance," and X believe all of the documents
relevant to this have been lodged with the Court, but in his
response he requested pending appeal that Mrs. Korn's motion
be “denied without prejudice contained or stayed.'3

Appellant's

attorney also spoke to the judge by telephone and wrote a
letter to the judge on September 8, 1977, which letter is
shown in our brief at page 10.
We contend that appellant’s activities before the
Superior Court for the City and County of San Francisco, State
of California, constituted more than a special appearance and
constituted a general appearance, waiving his rights to pursue
jurisdiction further.
QUESTION5

Ms. Thorn, X think it was some forty or

fifty years ago that this Court decided a case in which it
said that if one could pay a judgment rendered against him by
the highest court of a state arid not superseded and then was
pursuing appeal here, without the ease becoming moot

do you

see much difference between that situation and the situation
you have just referred to?
MS. THORNs

Well, here they are raising jurisdictional

issue and making a special appearance only — and there was a
request for a continuance, which has been held many times to
constitute a general appearance.

I don’t know that payment of

a judgment constitutes a general appearance in the same sense

40

as a request .for a continuance.
QUESTION:

Did you urge this in the.state court?

MS. THORN:

This happened after the state court,

opinion became final, Justice White.
QUESTION:

Did yen' raise it in the motion to dismiss

in this Court?
MS. THORN:

I do not believe it was urged, Justice

Marshall.
QUESTION:

The other thing is, what law determines,

California law or federal law?
MS. THORN:

QUESTION: 'Yes.

•

t

Well, you raised it.

"

it would be our opinion -If it is moot in California» it is moot

her®, isn't it?
MS. THORN:

I would think so, Mr. chief Justice.

Under California law, it .is clearly

moot under the eases which

say that or request for a continuance is a general appearance.
QUESTION:

But wouldn’t there be a federal element

in this Court’s decision as to whether the petitioner or'
appellant is free to pursue his remedy by way of appeal here
and nonetheless protect what he conceives to he his pending

interests in a state trial court while we have the appeal
before us?
MS. THORN:

I think that he had the right to protect,

as Your Honor suggests.

He could have done that f however, by

moving to stay the filing of the Supreme Court of California
opinion so that it did not become final, thereby putting juris­
diction back in the Superior Court.
QUESTION:

He did not do that.

You are really asking us to determine

what constitutes a general appearance or, more accurately,
whether the things that you are talking about constitute a
general appearance under California law.

How are we competent

to do that?
MS. THORNs

Well, X am asking that you recognise

that in asking for a form of affirmative relief from the
California Superior Court, that appellant made a general ap­
pearance causing the matter to become moot at this level.
I would like to make a few more points on the merits,
and in that connection I would like to return to the McGee
case where the Court found that one contact with the
California insured was sufficient because California had shown
a manifest interest in providing effective means of redress for
its residents when their insurers refuse to pay claims.
The case also mentioned that there would foe seme in­
convenience to the Texas insurer from having to defend in
California, but that this did not constitute a. denial of due

42
process.
I 'would suggest to tbs Court that the state has a
manifest interest in protecting the welfare of the children
who reside there.
QUESTION:
business.

May I get back to this general appearance

I gather you concede that everything happened that

happened before

the coining down of the California Supreme

Court opinion, save the failure to move to stay the caning
down of that opinion, everything that he did before that in no
wise prejudiced the special appearance he had been making
through the Superior Court?
MS. THORN:

Prior to the rendering of the California

Supreme Court opinion
QUESTION:

So your reliance in the argument that what

he did constituted a general appearance, everything occurred
after the caning down of that opinion, right?
MS. THORN;

And apparently in order to preserve his

opportunity to come to this Court, is that it?
MS. THORN:.. That is correct.

QUESTION:

And that is the opinion that is before us?
Excuse me, I didn't hear.
That is the opinion, that is before us, is

the Supreme Court's judgment and opinion?

Court subsequent to the rendering of the Supreme Court opinion
of the State of California have been lodged with the Court in

MS. THORN:

No, that happened after, Justice Marshall.

placa in August of 1977, some four months after the Supreme
Court of the state of California rendered its opinion

and it

had become final.
QUESTION:

Ms. Thorn, in your footnote on page 11 of

your brief, you end up by saying, "There is no personal appearance aa long as the court is not asked to exercise its discre­
tion on the merita.”

Did your opponent ask the court to exer­

cise jurisdiction on the merits?
MS. THORN:

He asked them not to do that.

In San Francisco Superior. Court he asked

them for a continuance.
QUESTION: ' Ho asked them not to decide the merits?

tion, the particular coda section in question, and I cite
Pennoyer v. Neff, International Shoe, Titus, et cetera, in
response to earlier questions.

And in conclusion, let me

submit that in the search for fair play and substantial
justice, in all the cases that cite — we go back to
McDonald v. Mabee, Justice Holmes indicated,

in states bound

together by a Constitution and subject to the 14th Amendment,
great caution should ha used not to let fiction deny the fair
play that can ye secured only by pretty close adhesion to
fact, under a ircum stances where this Court has already found
mechanical a ad quantitative 'evaluations, should; not ba a de­
termination to say that buying one airplane ticket' is
sufficient; to make this type of connection, It seems to me is
going the other way from what this Court has previously said.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, counsel.

The

case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 1:16 o'clock p.m., the case in the
abov' -entitled matter was submitted.3
