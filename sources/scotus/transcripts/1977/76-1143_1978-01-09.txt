MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 76-1143, Ray Marshall, Secretary of Labor, et al.,
a ga ins t Ba r 1 ow fs.
Mr. Solicitor General, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WADE H. Me C REE, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHAIS OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MeCREE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The question presented by this appeal is whether the
-inspect.i,on provisions of the Act and their implementing regu­
lations that authorize representatives of the Secretary of
Labor during regular working hours end at other reasonable
times and within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner
to conduct warrantless inspections of the portions of commer­
cial1 premises routinely cccuplied by ar. employer's work force
violate the Fourth Amendment guarantee against unreasonable
s earc hen a n d; s e iz ures.
r three-judge court held that provision unconstitu­
tional, and v.e submit that it is an erroneous holding and
respectfully request this Court to reverse it.
The chronology of events that brings this
before the Court is brief and as follows:
19754

matter-

On -September 11,

occupational safety and health inspector called for

a routine inspection of appellee s premises in Pocatello, Idaho.

4
These premises were devoted to the besting and cooling business
and he sought to make a so-called general schedule inspection,
a term now superseded and called a “regional programmed inspec­
tion."

That is to say the inspection was not in response tc

any complaint by an employee or with reference to anything
ofcheh than a determination by the area officer that this kind
of business enterprise would be inspected within this com­
munity.
QUESTION:

Would you indicate, briefly, Mr. Solicitor

General... the scope of that inspection, that is, does it go just
to machinery or books, records and files?
MR. MeCREM:
h. •: •..or',

It would be limited to the premises,

premises occupied tp. Ea .'low's employees.

It did not

include the right to inspect books and records and it would be
limited only to the areas routinely occupied and only during
working hours or other reasonable times.
CUE.JTION:

General McGree, did the supersession that

you just referred to have any substantive consequences, or was
it just a change in name?
MR. McCRMS:
a change of name.

To the best of my knowledge, it is just

I found “general schedule'” somewhat difficult

to comprehend, too, and "regional programmed inspection" indi­
cates that what has happened is certain geographical areas
are inspected on a determination that as the Labor Department
indicates the worst first a to go to the premises that contain
3

5
the greatest hazards to employee safety, initially.

And these

are determined by reporting schedules from programs like
Workmen's Compensation programs.that regularly advise about the
.incidence of industrial accidents and other disabling occurrences
QUESTION:

Are there any specific criteria that are

relied upon by the regional officers who make these decisions?
HR. McCREE:

Yes.

If the Court please; the regional

officers receive the reports to which I made reference and
determine then which industries produce the greatest number of
industrial injuries and occupational disablements and then
within the industries where geographically they may be located.
And the schedules are determined on priorities based upon con­
siderations such as that.
QUESTION:

Are those schedules public information?

What I am interested in, with 5 million businesses subject ;to
the Act and 80,000 inspections made last rear, what guidelines
or objlactive criteria, if any, exists that control the exer­
cise of discretion by the individuals who decide whether this
business or that business is to be inspected?
MR. MeCROE:

If the Court please, there is a publica­

tion to which I'd like to make reference if I may,
have it at fingertip.
lectern.

I do not

I'll have it when X return to the

A publication that I suppose is discoverable by any

interested person.

It is a Field Performance Evaluation

System that is adopted for the guidance, of regional programs by

6
the Office of Field Performance Evaluations.

It is capticr -d

the "Worst First Program Scheduling Guide," and it indicates the
industries which will first be inspected on the basis of data
that is later appearing in this publication indicating the
nature of the enterprise, its relative rank in producing
disabling accidents and other occurrences, the number of
employees, the number of establishments, and so forth.
And so it is not an arbitrary determination at all,
but it has a rational basis, and as far as I can determine it­
is available for inspection by persons who are interested ir
knowing when their turn is coming about.
The inspector first called at Barlow's on September
11. 1975* properly identified himself by producing his creden­

tials and made an offer of a toll-free call to the proprietor
who was present on the premises to permit him to ascertain the
authenticity of the inspector.

The proprietor denied the

Inspectore admission for the purpose of making the inspection
stating that he believed the Fourth Amendment immunized him
from such an inspection in the absence of a search warrant,
which the inspector admitted that he did not have.
I suppose you would concede, Mr. Solicitor

We suggest, however, that on the basis of inspections'

— administrative inspections being authorized where a reasonable
scheme exists for an appropriate governmental — to serve an
appropriate governmental interest, that a search would be per­
mitted and that under the standards of Camara and See an in­
spection warrant would have been issued had one been sought.
QUESTION:

To go on with your facts, I take it that

entry was refused?
MR, KcCR&E:
QUESTION:

Entry was refused, if the Court please —
And that is not a crime or illegal, 1 take

it?
MR# Me C REE:

There is no criminal sanction attached

to that:. nor does any civil penalty result therefrom.
QUESTION:

MR. MeCRES:

And what does the regulation say about it?
Well, the Secretary has adopted a

regulation that provides, in summary, that the Area and
Assistant Regional -director and the Regional Solicitor shall
promptly take appropriate action, including compulsory process,
if necessary.
Now, as a matter of practice, the regional Inspectors
have then gone to theecourt to obtain an order requiring the
proprietor to submit to the inspection,
done here,

And, indeed, that was

chi the 30th of ..December, the District Court to which

the application was made, after issuing an order to show cause
to which Barlow’s responded with counsel , issued an order

3
requiring entry for the purpose of inspection»
QUESTION:

That doss the United States

What does

the inspector submit to the court to get such an order?

Does

he just make the presentation such as you did, that there is
a reasonable inspection scheme and the statute permits it ar.d
we want to get in?
MR, McCRSS:

That is essentially the representation

he makes to the court.

And the court in this case issued an

order to show cause which permitted the employer to appear and
assert any objection he might have.
QUESTION:

So that it is more than the equivalent of

a search warrant if you could have gotten a search warrant for
this reason?
MR, McCREE:

Considerably more, because it is an

ad; ersary proceeding and the search warrant, of course, is
ex parte,
QUESTION:
General McCree?

Well, it is both more and less, isn't it,

In other words, as I understand it, ail you did

was present the district court with this statute and said under
this statute we are authorized and empowered to make a search*.
There was no finding of probable cause, was there?
MR, MeCREE:

If the Court please, it was suggested

that a reasonable inspection scheme is the prerequisite for the
issuance of an inspection warrant under Camara and See.

A par­

ticularized probable cause isn't required under the standards

9
of those two cases.
QUESTION:

And none was found.

MR, McCRhf:

But it wasn't necessary under Camsra and

See.
QUESTION;

That's the issue,really, in this case.

isn't it?
MR, MeCREE:

Had an application been made for a

search warrant, if the Court please, we suggest that that would
have been the representation that would have been made to the
magistrate, ex parte, and he would have issued —
QUESTION;

A Camara-Sec type,

MR, McC REE:

A Camara-See type.

And we suggest that

he would have issued a search warrant then for the premises.
And, therefore, this procedure of requiring an order

of

issuing an order to show cause and permitting the employer to
z goear in opposition gave the employer even more protection
than this Court said the Fourth Amendment mandates in the
Camara and See situation.
QUESTION;

What, under your submission, could the

employer say?
MR, MeCRES:

Well, as a matter of fact, the employer

did say that he was. entitled to the protection of the Fourth
Amendment and that his premises could not be entered for that
reason.

And I have the transcript, and the court inquired of

the employer whether he wanted to show any reason why he

10

shouldn't corne in in response to it.

end all he ever said was,

“No, I have the Fourth Amendment, J and he never contended that
there was no rational scheme of inspection,which is the cri­
terion set forth in Camara and See as a basis for the issuance
of a search viarrant„
QUESTION:

And, under your submission, that's about

all — Fell, he could say there is no such plan as this, or
something like that.

But, apart from that sort of thing, all

he rtould say was this isn't a reasonable inspection program,
under your submission.
MR* McCRSS:

Indeed, that's all he could say, and he

ducted during regular working hours or at other reasonable
times, within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner and

QUEST.I UN:

Is this process, this order?

Slow does this order give the.- inspector any greater
authority than the statute itself gives? That's one question.
The second question is:

Where did the United States District

Court get the authority to enter such an unusual order?
MR. KcCRSE:

That has disturbed me, too.

I suppose

the federal jurisdiction statute might confer on the court

QUESTION:

MR. MeCREE:

Well, I think the All Writs Act is

really in support of jurisdiction that the court otherwise
possesses, and I would be bootstrapping if I did that.
I think I'd have to rely on federal ques tion jurisdiction and the authority of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
to issue process.

But, in any event —

QUESTION:

It wasn't the Secretary of Labor who was

claiming a right under the Constitution, was it,

under 1331»

He was the one who went into court.
MR, MeCREE:

He wag claiming a right to inspect the

premises under an Act, under a statute, a federal statute.
In any event, on the 30th of December, the district
court entered this order and the inspector, thereupon, reappearz6
at the premises and requested admission pursuant to its auth­
ority.

He was denied permission on the 5th of January 1976 and

thereafter Appellee filed a complaint for injunctive relief in
the district court.

He challenged the constitutionality of the

statute and a three-judge court was duly designated.

And on

December 30, 1975, the three-judge court held that the inspec­
tion provision was unconstitutional and permanently enjoined
the Secretary from proceeding with this inspection.
brings us to the question here:

And that

whether the Fourth Amendment

13

forbids inspections as authorized by the statute.
And, of course, our Initial focus is upon the
Fourth Amendment.

As this Court has said many times, the

Courth Amendment protects a privacy interest and not places.
The issue might be stated whether an inspection without a
warrant is unreasonable, which is so restricted as it is in
this case.

And we suggest that this depends upon the determin­

ation whether the protected privacy interest at stake is of
such magnitude and the authorized entry so significant an
encroachment on that interest that the interposition of a
neutral and detached magistrate should be required in the
absence of exigent circumstances.
he suggest here that there is no significant privacy
interest that calls for the issuance of a warrant because the
area to be searched is routinely occupied by the employees,
it's during working hours and that these limitations of area
and time to a portion of the premises that the employer has
opened

p to his own employees indicates the absence of a

privacy interest such as would require a warrant as a pre­
condition for entry.
QUESTION:

But isn't there a certain degree of

privity between an employer and his employee that doesn’t exist
with the employer and the world at-large or government atlarge?
MR. McCRKw;

I would certainly not deny that there

14

would be a relationship between the employer and the employee,
but when the employer opens up to his employees certain por­
tions of his business pennises, he also surrenders his exclu­
sive control of it, at least insofar as it affects certain of
those employees* interests.
For example, under the National Labor Relations Let,
these employees may speak: to persons who seek to organize them
for the purposes of collective bargaining, and he may not ex­
clude them when they come into those portions of his premises,
at certain times, in any event.
QUESTION:

Under certain circumstances, isn't there

a legal right to shut the plant down and close it and exclude
ev erybody, Including employees ?
hi. MeCRLE:

And, indeed, if he should do that, the

inspector could not enter then because he must enter during
regular working hours in just those areas routinely occupied.
And he has not the authority, under the statute, without a
particularized showing to do that.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there at

1:00 o ‘clock, Mr „ Solicitor Genera 1.
MR, McCRLE:

Thank you,

MRp CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Solicitor General,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WADE H. MeCREE, JR., ESQ. {Resumed)
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MeCREE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The sum of the Government's argument in this case can
be found in an expression of this Court in 19^5 in a case
captioned Marsh v, Alabama involving a company town, an
institution that this Court has on a later date characterized
fortunately as an "economic anachronism. I:

In that case, this

Court stated "the more an owner for his advantage opens up his
property for use by the public in general, the more do his
rights become circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional
rights of those who use it."
And we submit that occupational safety and health
inspections intrude upon an employer's premises only to the
degree that he has opened those premises to employees for his
own advantage, and the purposes of the inspections are
directio related to the safety of those employees.

And there

are safeguards in the statute and in the regulations to insure
that the inspections are performed only for their intended
purpose„

16

QUESTION:

You don't suggest that a member of the

public or the public at-large has any access to these premises,
do you, Mr. Solicitor General?
MR. MeCREE:
QUESTION:

I do not.
-- just walked in off the street and

said, "I’d like to look at your plant.'1
MR. MeCREE:

Certainly not over the employer's

refusal to accord it to him.
employers do.

As a practical matter, many

Vendors come on at lunch hours and sell

sandwiches, beverages and so forth.

Many employers do this

with their regular working premises, but I am not s pea kin,,; of
that situation.
QUESTION;

In our company town situation, there was

really much more access by the public, generally, wouldn’t you
buthen

there is in an ordinary industrial plant?
MR. MeCREE:

X would think so.

Of course, Marsh,

as I recall it, was a case where religious literature was being
distributed on the premises,, and we are not even seeking an
intrusion of that extent because we suggest that this is even
more restricted.

Thirty years ago the Court rec ogn iz eel t ha t

when a person allows someone else to use his property he gives
up an expectation or privacy, at least congruent with that
person's rights, or some of his rights
And we suggest here that where the safety of the
employees mo are gathered on the premises for his advantage

17

Is a legitimate concern of the Congress, as expressed in this
legislation, that these inspections do not therefore intrude
upon any privacy interests of the business and that no warrant
should be required to permit an inspection to see that this
public interest is carried out.
QUESTION:

Mr* Solicitor General, do you have any

other case, other than Marsh, because you know Marsh has been
deluded recently?

Shopping center cases, do you remember?

MR* MeCREM.:

I am quite aware of that, if the Court

please.
GUEST ION:
MR* McCREIS:

But that doesn't affect your one point.
The shopping centers are not — to refer

again to the phrase I used before -- the economic anachronism
that the company town is.

They-are the current wave,

I can

refer, however, to the cases that have recognized in the labor
field, that X made reference to before the recess, where for
organizational purposes, under limated circumstances, access can
be had on premises that are less public than shopping centers
and shopping malls which have eroded some of the pronouncement
of Marsh.
QUESTION:

Marsh was a constitutional case and the

question was whether or not the company, town there was the
equivalent of government.

MR» Me C REE:
QUi&TION:

Inde ed.
That hasn Bt been questioned since.

The

18

only question is whether a shopping center is the equivalent of
a government and that's irrelevant to your argument under this
case.

This is a statutory case.
MR„ MeCREE:

Thank you. Mr. Justice»

We believe that reasonableness in the light of the
limited nature of the employer's interest in the portion of his
premises that he opens up routinely to his employees is mani­
fest under these circumstances, and that this legislation is
constitutional and that the judgment of the three-judge court
should be reversed.
QUESTION:

Mr4 Solicitor General, may I ask you a

question about what you understand the statute means.

If an

employe:- denies access, the statute says that the agent has the
right to enter without delay.

Do you interpret that as meaning

he can insist on going in without delay, or does he have to go
«
toe ou r t f i rs t ?
MR. MeCREE:
in.

he believe that he may insist upon going

We commend the Labor Secretary for - providing in his regu­

lations that he see.: a court order in order to avoid a breach
of the peace.
QUESTION:

You commend him, but he really didn't have

to do that, did he?
MR. McCRSl:
that
QUESTION:

We contend that he did not have to do
efus
Does that mean that if there is a r

19

to enter, under the statute, the agent could force his.way in
if he had to, if he thought there was something dangerous that
might be hidden if he didn't look at it right away.

You make

the argument that there is need for unannounced inspection to
find out what’s really happening.
MR, Me C RES:

Vie believe that the Congress has

authorized him to do that, but we would hope that he would not
do it as a matter of policy except in the extreme circumstance
that the Court posited.
QUESTION:

If the agent thought it was really a very

dangerous situation that might not be found out, he should go
right ahead --

MR. ucCR

Vie believe the Congress has given him

that authority.
QUESTION:

For your constitutional argument, you

don’t rely at all on the regulation?
MR. McCR.CC:

Vie do not rely on the regulation for our

eonstitutIona 1 argument.
QUESTION:
MR. Me CRMS:

Nor on the court order?
Nor on the court order,

ith the leave of the Court, I would like to reserve
the balance of my time for rebuttal.
Thank you.

Very well, Mr. Solicitor

Mr. Runffc.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP JOHN L. RUNFT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF Of' THE RESPONDENT
MR. RUNFT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I would like to open by going directly to a question
asked my friend, the Solicitor, by Chief Justice Burger, with
regard to the degree of privity found here in the relationship
between the employer and the employee.

It seems to me, in

essence here, that the Secretary of Labor is attempting to
state that the Department has the right to come into the
premises involved here, so to speak, on the back of .the
employees.
Now, the Commerce Clause in the Constitution does
give Congress the power to regulate commerce.

And, perhaps to

the extent the re are employees in a work premises there is then
a com ensurate right, as Congress so found, to inspect.
that is not the same thing as saying,
inspect without a warrant."

3ut

"VJe have the right to

There is a distinction here.

And

X submit —
QUESTION:
MR. RUNFT:

Or even enter.
Or even enter.

The question Of entry, of course, is a, I submit,
separate question, one dealing with probable cause.

But X

believe the point here to be made initially, for opening, is

21
this:

That throughout the presentation and throughout the

brief of the United States there is a constant shifting back ana
forth between the question, between the issue, I should say, of
the power to inspect, through the Commerce Clause, and the right.
to enfcer withoufc a warrant„
I would like to go directly from that, with regard to
this question of a warrant, to what the Court has stated in its
cases is necessary to determine the question of whether or not
a warrant is necessary.

Of course, the leading case here is the

Camara case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Runft, before you get to that case —

Just, so I follow your argument correctly — what is your
position as to the show in;; that would tie required in order
to get a warrant?
MR. RUNET:

I believe, Mr. Justice Stevens, that

there would have to be a showing of probable cause as set forth
as detailed in the Camara case,
QUESTION:

Probable cause as to the particular

business establishment, cr the probable cause to believe that
some businesses like this may be dangerous?
MR. RUNFT:

I believe there 'would have to be in any

case some showing as to the particular business*

even, for

example, in the case posited in Camara where you have an area
inspection.

Now, where you have an area inspection, questions

could be asked as to the particular building as to when it war

22
built.

If it were found out that it was not built at the same:

time, or say more recently than all the other buildings in this
blighted area —
QUESTION:

Your submission is that there is no right

on the part of the government inspector to enter without
probable cause to believe there was some violation of the
statute within the premises?
MR, RUNFT:

That’s your submission?

It is my submission, Mr. Justice Stevens,

but I do hold that there is a middle ground.

I am trying to

bring out —
QUESTION:

It is your submission, but it's not quite

that extreme you want to make it.
MR. RUNFT:
case,

perhaps.

Yes, not os extreme as in the. criminal

But there must be — It is our position, our

submission to the Court that in every case in order for the
Secretary of Labor to enter there must be some connection, some
rational connection between the statute and that particular
place of business, that particular working environment.
QUESTION:

Do you think he has to have some suspicion

that there is a violation?

Or, X gather you say he doesn't even

have to have that, does he?
MR. RUNFT:

bell, I believe the suepic ion might

arise from the factors, such as the nature of the industry,
such as the industry-wide accident rate, for . example, such as,
perhaps, complaints of workman, and so on.

The suspicion, as

one would call it, does not have to be specific as to that
industry, directly, as to any particular time, is what 1 am
saying.

In other words, there are cases, quite a number of

cases, Mr. Justice White, recently.

I have quite a list of

them here that I could submit to the Court that have taken the
position that government findings industry-wide, such as in
NEP, National Emphasis Program in OSHA, will suffice to form
probable cause for entry, say, into a steel manufacturing plant
or into a casting plant.
OUEbTION:

I take it, then, there will be some

industr ies at the low end of the scale that they can’t enter
without traditional probable cause.
MR. RUNET:

I would say that would be a question.

that would be the very question that should be determined by
a magistrate, as to what is the reasonable nature; VJhat is the
reasonab1eness here of this probable cause to be shown?
r.n other words, is there probable cause based on a national
emphasis Urogram cr a worst-first program* and if there are
facts available in a particular case, how do they relate to the
general facts presented by the Secretary of Labor?
Specifically, the issue is, I believe, here, in
fact, the fundamental issue in this case is whether or not we
need to have a magistrate, an independent magistrate, here
to make this decision.
issue in this case.

I think that really is the fundamental

24
QUESTION:

Suppose the statute had expressly given

a court jurisdiction to issue some sort of a piece of paper,
a search warrant, or something, or an inspection warrant, and
that before you even go to the premises, suppose that the
statute had provided that and the piece of paper issued in this
case, just on the same information that the court order issued
in this case, would you think that was enough?
MR. RUNFT:
QUESTION:

I would not.
What was the shortcoming of the submission

to the court in this case?
MR, RUNFT:

The shortcoming of the submission to the

court in this case. Justice White, was simply that the United
States Attorney presented the fact that the Barlow establishment
was an employer, that workers are employed there and that it
feel into the jurisdiction of OSHA.
QUESTION:
MR. RUNFT:

That was the —

Purely on the statute, that's all.

claim that is insufficient.

We

Of course, the burden is extremely

great — I mean the difference is extremely great between such
a showing and a showing of probable cause.

Where in this case

perhaps an accident rate industry-wide might have been shown,
•if. there are,

indeed, figures, for this type of small business,,

any other showing to lay the ground work for this inspection,
to show that there is some rational connection between the

purposes of the statute and the need of the government uc

that we call for the interposition of a magistrate —
QUESTION:
is not.

Mr. Runft, one Is ex. parte and the other

What you are asking for is an ex parte hearing before

a magistrate,
MR. RUNFT:

That is correct, Your Honor.

The reason

there, Justice Marshall, if I may say, is that in the ex parte
hearing there Is still tie requirement that they must make a
probable cause shoring,

They still must conform to these

standards.
QUESTION:

And you could then suppress, move to

suppress.
MR, RUNFT:

One could move to quash the warrant

later.
That does bring up another interesting question, or
another issue which is apparent throughout the brief here of
the Government, and that is they say that the Government would
be terribly disadvantaged if it was faced with a warrant
requirement.
Now would it, really?

They claim that it would give

notice to the employers that there would be a search; but,
indeed, doesn’t the present compulsory process give notice'
just as much as a warrant would.

In fact, a warrant would g

to go in without going to court.

If you had let him in,

aren't the regulations there to say what he can do and what

Are not those regulations quite specific?

MR,' RUNFT:
QUESTION:
MR, RUNFT:

That is correct, Mr, Justice Marshall,
That's what I thought.
Those regulations, however, I may add -

27

are procedural regulations as to hot; the inspection should te
conducted.

And I wish to point out they are not safeguards of

the type that would —■ or a criteria that would lend itself to
explaining why a search should he conducted in that particular
premises.

There is no way in those regulations, or in the

statute itself, to determine any standards that would justify
any particular search.
VIhat we really have here, if I could submit to the
Court

What we really have here in this Act and the way it

is being enforced without warrant is a form of legislative
probable cause.

The issue is really one of separation of

powers, I submit.

The brief, as you know, actually comes to

the conclusion that the presence of a magistrate is unneeded
in these circumstances.

And in the reply brief, in fact, the

phraseology is used, I believe, "the intervention of a magis­
trate or of a judge is not required in the administrative
search. '!

And that particular reference is to be found on page

2 of the reply brief.
QUESTION:

Mr. Runft, you make the point that to

require the Government to secure a warrant would be no real
burden on them.

I think you said that, didn't you?

MR0 RUNFT:

It may.

It depends.

A.s far as procedur-

ally that is correct.
QUESTION:

Well, to the extent that you a re right

about that, then what you contend for is no real protection for

28

you, is it?
MR. RUNFT:

Fell, I believe it would be on this,

Justice .Rtewart, because the Secretary would have to carry the
burden of making a probable cause showing.
QUESTION:

In answer to questions of my brother,

V.'hite, I thought I understood you to say that all the
Government would have to show would be something along the
lines of what was required in Camara and See, i.e** that this
is a statute duly enacted by Congress and signed by the
President, a valid federal lav/ that authorizes inspections
of any place of business.

And he shows that and then he shows

that this industry has an' accident

•’ate, and every industry has

an accident rate; whatever it may be, it has one.

And that

that's enough.
MR. RUNFT:

If I may, in answer to that, it may not

not in other circumstances.

That's a case that the Alabama
It’s Marshall v. Shell least Corp.

It’s Civil Number 77~P-0995-Ej and was decided on July 26th of
this year.

In that case, the .Secretary came into a foundry to

sake an inspection, according to an NSP, National Emphasis

29

Program, under the foundry industry.

The statistics of the

NhP program were developed in the year 1973; and this, of
course, took place in 1976, this inspection, or attempted
inspection»

The court asked the question of whether there was

any specific information available, or easily attainable.
apparently

And,

although it!s not clear in the record exactly

what sort of information It was

there were specific

And, under those circumstances, where

there were subsequent statistics showing that the accident
rate in this particular establishment were considerably less -~
UxiiTlu'N:

This establishment or this industry?

MS, RUNFT:

This industry ~~ Well, no, in this

particular establishment.

These were available as regards

this particular establishment6

And, for that reason, the

court refused to grant the search warrant, or the inspection
warrant.
QUi&TIGN

Take the corollary of that.

Suppose the

application for the warrant recited that the accident rate
were three times the rate of all other comparable people using
the same kind of machinery to produce the.same kind of goods
in that area.

Would you think that would meet whatever

probable cause standards you suggest are necessary?
MR# RUNFT:

VJhat I understand, Mr. Chief Justice,

that that warrant regarding this aggravated accident rate
referred specifically to the entity that was to be searched
\

30

I would say that would be a much stronger, that
would be the opposite situation, much stronger, to support
probable cause, yes.

But I believe these cases, and these

cases are varied and really very fascinating as to what the
courts, in the district courts throughout the land, really are
doing with the Camara test.

They are adhering, on one hand,

to the idea brought out in Camara of the area search or the
NNP type thing, or perhaps the first-worst type of approach,
but still saying, "Via can still look to and if they are
available demand that individual circumstances be brought to
the court.'1

For example, OS HA has several forms ~~

QUESTION:

Camera didn't require that, did it?

tt required no more than a showing of a rational area inspec­
tion program. Isn't that correct?
MR* TUNFT:

If X might

That is correct, Your

Honor, except that the probable cause to issue a warrant
must exist if reasonable legislative or administrative
standards for conducting an area inspection are satisfied.
And it is- that word "reasonable" in several cases that has
been zeroed in on in these district court cases.

And that is

to be found in the Camara case, that• particular reference tHer­
at 387 'J.S. 538, Section Number 14 in the opinion.

And they

are saying that we do need the presence of an effective
magistrate here to determine this reasonableness, in these
questions of probable cause.

QUESTION:

Here you. have a statute that purports t o

be concerned with the health and safety of conditions in all
plants all over the United States, with certain deminimis
exceptions, not confined to a certain industry.

If you had

a statute that were concerned with the steel industry, say,
and then if somebody, a government inspector, said, _t!I want
to inspect this sausage plant," that would be unreasonable.
But under this statute, why isn't any inspection that’s a
rational program reasonable in light of the Camara case?
Vlhy, therefore, couldn't the warrant be secured in any case
in the light of the Camara standard?
MRo RUNFT:

I believe the answer to that lies, if

I may, in the facts which have been brought out in a number of
opinions.

For instance, the Brennan v. Gibson’s Products

opinion, Judge G., of the 5th Circuit, pointed out that the
factual findings underlying CSHA are, indeed, very thin, and
certainly do not themselves constitute standards, that is
criterion, sufficient to explain or to give a guide as to how
to translate these needs into inspections, as to say how you
can express this need against — need to inspect

against

the int .-usion into privacy that might occur.
Mow, there are detailed guidelines as to procedure.
how the./ identify themselves and how the i n s p e c t o r s d o t i' e c t

things, but there are very few standards \ i e r e a s to hoi: t h e t a
how the need of the Government to inspect is to be comparco

32

or translated into the intrusion that is to occur, or against
the intrusion that is to occur.
I believe, in answer to your question, also, it
should be pointed out that this statute does not constitute
pervasive regulation in the sense of the G,M. Leasing; case.
There Justice Blackmun pointed out that pervasive regulatlor -1 believe that’s the nearest thing vie have to a definition of
pervasive regulation -» that pervasive regulation meant regu­
lation where the nature of the industry or endeavor, the
organization of it, every aspect of it is controlled.
Here, in OS HA, 06 HA is 'like the IRS situation.

Yen

have a thin slice,that runs through all of industry, but is
not pervasive.

And when ;-ou don’t have pervasive regulation,

of course, according to the Golonade and BiswelI decisions,
if it is not truly pervasive, controlling every aspect of this
industry, then you don't fit into that narrow category, that
narrow category of cases where warrants are not required.
CUEHTJON:

In trying to test out this showing on

getting a warrant, suppose Government had information as to
the total production of a particular paint factory, from
whatever source, and then it could observe from the outside
'chat it had only X number of ventilating vents with fans to
take off the noxious and dangerous fumes, then went in
reciting these objective facts and reciting the standard that
this v.-a.s only 2% of the necessary means of protecting the

33
health of the people inside that plant from the noxious fumes,
lead poisoning.

Do you think they could issue a warrant on

that?
MRo RUNFT:

I believe that it would form objective

evidence, perhaps, sufficient to do it. Your Honor, yes,
QUESTION: -And you say that's the kind of evidence
objective evidence that the Government must furnish in order
to make the inspection,
MR, RUNFT:

I would like to answer the question yes

or no, Mr. Chief Justice, but I hesitate to do so for this
reason.

There are occasions when, I am sure, that a national

emphasis program type of situation would be sufficient to stand
as probable cause for an inspection, to say that in one par­
ticular industry you have a very high incident of accidents
end we, therefore, use that as a grounds to inspect.

But

there should be a magistrate present to ask these questions:
V.’Len was the NEP made?

When was this study made?

Is this

industry that you propose to inspect directly involved in
exactly that type of endeavor?

A number of questions line'

that.
Also, according to the Shellcast case, and I thin
this is very significant, the magistrate could ask the GtHA
inspector, or the Secretary of Labor's representative: Did you
attempt/ to make any further inquiry?

Did you use the OS HA

forms 102, 103 and 104, which are a form of interrogatory

3-4
asking a particular business about its own particular situa­
tion.
QUESTION:

Mr. Runft* couldn’t the judge have asked

all of those questions in this case'; and insisted on answers?
MR. RUNFT:
didn't.

He could have. Your Honor* but he

I asked him to.
QUj&STXON:

And couldn’t you have asked him to ask

MR. RUNFT:

The question was asked by me* and he

probable cause hearing."

This is not a

He said* "My position is merely to

ascertain jurisdiction here and to ascertain if we have the
proper application of the statute."
.N:

I am not questioning* but you didn't make

an offer of proof?
MR. RUNFT:

Yes* I pointed out very distinctly*

in fact* that we had quite a hearing later on of whether I had
reserved the constitutional issues so as not to face res
,-judicada on my collateral cause of action.

And we had to

make a transcript of that and take it up on that issue.
I would like to point out one other thing, if X may*
that I feel is extremely important and. perhaps* fundamental
here in the Secretary's position which X believe is an error
throughout his brief.

And that is this:

Throughout his brief,

the Secretary is attempting tt apply a balancing test to the

question of whether or not a warrant will be

■.

nd

I believe Justice White's, opinion in Camara made it very,
very plain that the balancing test is not the test — that ia
the balancing test between the interests is not the test that
is applied on the question of whether or not a warrant is
granted.

The question of whether or not a warrant is granted

is a categorical definitional test.
dustry that falls into that category?

Is this the type of in­
Are these the facts

that we exempt from a warrant requirement?
of industry we exempt?
of regulation.

Is this the kind

The liquor industry has a long history

Anns, again, some history and a particular

nature of that industry.

Those have been specifically

excepted from the warrant requirement by a decision of this
Court.

And at the end of the *ee case, bee v. the City of

Seattle, this Court made the further observation that as to
those categorical exceptions, the Court would take It on a
caae by case.basis.
But, I submit, that's not the balancing test.

As

Justice White's opinion in Camara points out, the balancing
test comes later.
VOICh:

The balancing test between interests —
We call it the opinion of the court.

MR, RUNET:

As the opinion of the court states,

the balancing test comes later and with regard to the
reasonableness of the search.
Now, I am not denying that a warrantless- search must

36
also be reasonable.

Any search, under the Constitution,

pursuant and in order to comply with the Fourth Amendment,
must be reasonable, whether it is a search with or without a
warrant.

But the question of reasonableness comes after the

determination, the categorical factual determination is made
whether or not a warrant will be required,
QUESTION:

It doesn't in the Fourth Amendment.

The Fourth Amendment puts the requirement of reasonableness
first and then talks about warrants.
MR. RUNFT:

I will stand corrected.

Perhaps, I

should say they are two separate questions, that one does not
involve the other.
that is correct.

I-stend corrected, Your Honor,

I think

But, what I am attempting to say here is

that throughout the Government!s brief they use the method of
determining whether or not a warrant should be issued,a coording
to the Government's brief, is based on a balancing test.

They

want to balance the need to Inspect against what they call the
magnitude of the privacy interest.

And even that balancing

test, I submit, is incorrect, because the balancing test that
is done, say, in the probable cause showing is between the
need of. the Government to inspect and the degree of intrusion
on the privacy interest, not — you don't consider the magni­
tude of the privacy interest.

The magnitude of the privacy

interest is always there: it’s privacy — or privacy interest,
excuse me.

The magnitude of the intrusion is what is balanced

37
-with thy need of the Government to inspect.
The last thing I want to comment on, very briefly,
is the Government's position here with regard to privacy.
Once again, the court is presented with the Government's
position in this case of a limited type of privacy, a peripheral
privacy interest according to-this Court and the'Court's
opinion in the Chadwick case decided last June very specifically
rejected this type of concept of a privacy interest under the
Fourth amendment.

In fact, Justice Brennan, in his concurring

opinion, went so far as to make a remonstrance that the United
States would come back to this Court with this type of presen­
tation of privacy interest under the Fourth Amendment.
Now, once again, here they are claiming that privacy
interests under the Fourth Amendment are restricted to the
home and tie office, and that’s it.

And that Mr. Barlow or

people ride situated in employment have a diminished privacy
interest, and that their privacy interest isn't as strong as
elsewhere.
And the Court summarily and very definitely rejected
that In the Chadwick case, cited last January.
Thank you.
QUESTION:

You don’t attack the basic constitution.-,

ality of this legislation, do you?
MR e RUNFT:
the decision below.

Vie do.

We do ask the Court to affirm

The reason is that the argument in that

38
which is the last section of our brief deals with the fact
that it is very clear from the legislative history that it
was the expressed intent of Congress that the searches con­
ducted pursuant to this legislation be warrantless searches.
It is very definitely laid out.

Secondly, the minotiry report,

by Representative fchirley, specifically warned of the consti­
tutional infirmities involved in this legislation, and
specifically pointed out the Cainara and dee cases and one
could say Congress thereby was on notice.
secondly, in answer to that, the Act itself simply
does not provide sufficient standards by which one can derive
criteria by which to make these inspections.
QUESTION:

You don't think the regulations help?

MR. RUNFT:
Justice Marshall.

Not from the standpoint of standards,

Procedure, yes.

Standards, no.

Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Solicitor General.

Let me ask you a question before you begin.

Suppose

the Immigration Service asked the QiHA people to let one of
the Immigration officials go along with him in let's say the
Southwestern states where illegal aliens, or whatever states
illegal aliens are thought to be most frequently working, and
then acting on his observations checked on the blue card or
green card, or whatever it is the legal alien must have for
employment.

Would you think that would be permitted under

39
this procedure?
MR. Mc.Canas:

I would think net, if the Court please.

And I would amplify ray answer by pointing out that the
Secretary, by regulation, forbids the inspectors to search
j. or matters other than those set forth In the regulation.
I think I can furnish the Court that regulation.
%

MR * CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

What if, without searching.,

che inspector, OS HA inspector, observed that predominantly they
v.ere Mexlean-Amerleans, let us say, or any other alien group
v./ho could not speak English as he would observe objectively
i irs c-hano?

Could he report that to the Immigration or the

FBI?
M'1* hicwRjilv;

i would think not .

I would think the

fact that they were predominantly Mexican wouldn't necessarily
suggest that their alienage v;as other than American citizen,
tha.G their citizenship was other than American citizenship,

it certainly wouldn't betray it to me.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

My point is not whether

in is true, but whether they may report that objective fact
which they observed, that 90% of the employees appeared to be
Mexican-nmericans or Cubans and 90% of them could not respond
to questions out to them in English.
MR* McC'REE:

If the Court please, there is a regu­

lation that forbids the inspector from doing just that, and I
v;Ou.!.d expect them uo abide by the regulation.

Their inquiry

40

inquiry is limited to conditions affecting the safety and
health of the work force.
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF WADE H„ MeCREE, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, MeCREE:

Vie would conclude, if the Court please,

by suggesting that there are two steps to our argument, first,
whether the inspection is reasonable.

And we think in Camara

this Court has indicated that area searches and things like
area searches under proper legislative pronouncements are
reasonable.

And then, of course, the question becomes whether

a warrant, an inspection warrant is required.

And in Bisuell

this Court told us something about the purpose of that.

It

suggested that a measure of protection with little, if any,
threat to the effectiveness of the inspection system there at
issue could be afforded by an inspection warrant.
Nov-, whether this measure of protection overbalances
the effectiveness of the inspection system seems to be the
issue.

And here the unannounced inspection is a critical part

of the statutory scheme.

As this Court pointed out in Biswell,

■ e.ry little would be gained by not requiring, for the effective­
ness of the system

let me rephrase that.

That the inspec­

tion system in Biswell would not — or in Bee would not be
impaired by requiring an Inspection warrant, because structural
defects in the building would be of relatively long standing
and relatively difficult to change easily.

And it intimated

41
in Bis wall that if notice went to the gun dealer that the
person contemplated in the inspection, he would — he might
remove the contraband from his presence.
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General., it seems to me

that the Secretary here by his regulations has indicated that
"We will just give him notice," and he has instructed his
inspectors, "If refused entry, don't break in and take advantage
of an unannounced entry.
MR. MeCREE:

Go to court."

If the Court please, he first instructs

his inspector to seek entry, without notice --QUESTION:

I know, but then he permits him to be

turned away and tells him. if he is turned away to go to court.
MR. MeCRSE:

If the Court please, there are regula -

tions which forbid giving advance notice of the intent to
inspect, and there are even penalties on the employees for
disclosing the intention of inspecting.

So it's really not

The regulation, as the Court appropriately points

out, dors afford notice once the court is asked to issue such
an order.

That is the rare case,

That is the case where he

has been turned down and we nope this Court's ruling today will
make it unnecessary to dc it.
QUESTION:

It is the rare case that he is turned

down at all.
MR, McCREE:

It Is the rare case that ho is denied

the right, and we hope if this Court upholds the statutory

42

scheme, it will be even rarer.
QUESTION:

What if the Court upholds it and the

person, owner of the business establishment, still says don‘t
come in.

He is still not subject to any sanction.
MR. MeCREE:

The statute has. not provided a sanction

and then we suspect the Secretary, again, would direct his
inspector, or he would, through his inspector, go to court to
get an order so that he might use the power of the court to
uphold the law.

And then, of course, a contempt citation would

be sought if he refused to obey it.

But that happens in other

If we agree with you, the Secretary is

Well, I think he is in the case of
I have the belief that we are a nation

of law-abiding people and that if this Court issues its pro­
nouncement that employers across the country will abide by it.
QUESTION:

In your view -- or in the Government's

view, I suppose, the unannounced investigation is parallel to
the unannounced investigation that the bank examiners, for
example, make.
MR. McCREE:

There are certainly parallels.

I

suppose a person could perhaps adjust a questionable entry in
a ledger just as easily as he could turn on a switch in a
ventilating booth in a — ventilating fan in a painting booth.

QUESTION:

But the banking laws do prevent some

sanctions for banks who If they dared turn away a bank examine
do they not?
MR. MeGRISE:

If the Court please. I think the

Congress has had more experience with regulating banking
enterprises than it has safety and health, which is an
important matter in the nation’s agenda- of affairs that it
has just adverted to recently.
QUESTION:

Well, there are differences in degree of

pervasiveness of state regulation of banks and congressional
regulation of ail employer establishments by OSHA, are there
not?
MR. MeCREE:
CliiHSTIQN:

Of course there are, Your Honor.
And you justify your position, primarily,

because of the existence of this basic Federal statute, is
that correct?
MR, McCRSE:
C.URbTIQN:

That's correct, Your Honor,
What if Congress should pass a housing

safety and health act?

There is certainly an accident rate l.n

all houses, furnaces explode and there are fires and people
trip and fall in their bathtubs, and so on, and then should

say that any federal inspector could enter any hone, on
request, the argument would be the same, wouldn‘t it?

Because

of this basic statute, then, it follows that it is reasonable
for an inspector to enter a house without a warrant.

44
MR, Me C REE:

Well, that presents a much mors dif­

ficult question.
QUESTION:

Your argument would be the same, wouldn{t

it?
MR. McCREB:

My argument might not be the same,,

because this Court has for a long time recognized that the
very core of the interest of privacy is the residence of a
person.

This is not the residence of a person.

This is a

business enterprise entered into for profit that affects
commerce and that benefits only because persons not members,
necessarily members of' his household, despite the fact that
they have a special relationship with him, are brought into
his premises for his benefit.

And we believe that the

Congress of the United States in its interest for the 'wellbeing o? the people can look to their safety and welfare by
'n&vin;

vest rioted searches, inspections, if you will, iimiteu

to see that every American employee will have a safe place to
work, free from hazards that might be prevented.
QUESTION:

But, in the absence of this general

legislation, you wouldn't claim for a moment that a federal
agent could just enter any employer's premises, upon request,
would you?

And in my hypothetical case, wouldn't it

Well, the Congress can legitimize

But we haven't that case here.

QUESTION:

Most of those common areas of an apartment

building are new open to inspection by fire inspectors, are
they no;?

Generally, everywhere.
hi, McCREE:

I would think so.

But they are open

generally to the public, I suspect, too, delivery persons,

exclusive control of an area, the less becomes his privacy
