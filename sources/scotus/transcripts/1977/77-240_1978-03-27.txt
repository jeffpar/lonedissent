MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Barry.
Mr, Kosdeltcher,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIDNEY S, RQSDEITCHER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, RQ&DEITCHER:

Mr. Chief Justice,, and may it please

the Court:
This case raises for the first time a question of inter­
pretation of a central portion of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.
Specifically., under Section 2(b) of that Act* Congress withdrew
the Sherman Act and other Federal antitrust laws from the business
of Insurance if the States enacted regulatory legislation

to

specifically provide thet the Sherman Act and other antitrust
'.Laws shall apply to the business of insurance to the extent not
regulated by the States,
Under Section 3(b) of the Act, Congress provided an
exception to this policy of deference to State regulation.

It

provided that Federal regulation, under the Sherman Act, world ’• e
reserved and would continue to apply in cases of boycott, coer­
cion or Intimidation.
In this case, we contend that the First Circuit Court
of Appeals interpreted that exception so expansively that it
nullified the policy of Section 2(b), to withdraw the Sherman Act

4
and the antitrust laws in most cases from the business of insur­
ance where the states enacted regulations.
This afternoon, I hope to demonstrate that the result
reached by the First Circuit was unnecessary, that it was not
required by what the First Circuit believed was the plain meaning1
of the phrase "boycott, coercion, intimidation," that the history
of the Act and use of those terms in this Court marked out a more
reasonable boundary line which would have preserved and given
meaning to both Section 3(b) and Section 2{b),
Before I turn to the specific facts of this case, I
would like, If you will, to give a very brief history which I
think will put those facts and the Issues in this case in per­
spective.
For more than a century, the regulation of the business
of insurance and particularly the relationship between the
policyholder and the insurance company was assumed to be and was
•ft

totally in the hands of the State.

In 1944, this Court in the

Southeastern Underwriters case, held that at least one set of
Federal regulations would apply to the business of insurance,
namely,'the Sherman Act and the Federal antitrust laws.
The following year, in 1945, Congress reacted to that
decision and it enacted the McCarran-Ferguson Act.

This Court

has already said that the purpose of that statute was to place
the force of Federal law behind State regulations.

It specifi“

cally recognizes that it Is in the public interest that State

5
regulation of insurance be the policy in this country.

And*

finally, as this Court has said, the purpose of the statute was
to turn back the clock in most part to where it stood prior to
Southeasfcern Underwrlfcsrs and place the regulation of insurance,
and leave the regulation of the policyholder-insurance company
relationship, particularly, in the hands of the State.
This case raises an issue about one portion of that
Congressional endeavor.

As I said, it relates to the decision

of Congress to withdraw the dhennan Act from the business of in­
surance, with an exception for boycotts, coercion and intimida­
tion .
The tension between those two previsions is presented
starkly in this case.
case.

And let me briefly recite the facts of this

The Plaintiffs are two groups.

They purport to bring a

class action on behalf of doctors in Rhode Island and patients of
those doctors or future patients.

The doctors claim that they

were insured by the St. Paul Fire & Marine and that for sometime
they were getting an insurance policy whose terms they were satis­
fied with, a policy known as an occurrence basis policy, which
provides, briefly, that the claim will be paid by the insurance
company for any events which occur during the term of the policy,
whether or not the claim is made at a later time.
Sometime in April 1975# St. Paul announced to its
insured that it would not renew their policies on that basiss
it would renew only on a so-called "claims made" basis which

6
limited the liability of the company by providing that it would
only pay for claims submitted during the term — or claims which
arose during the term of the policy.
QUESTION:

That was a substantial change.

MR. R06DEITCHER:
QUESTION:

It was a very substantial change.

In fact * had it been used by the Insurance

industry before this time?
MR, RQSDEITCHER:

I am not sure whether it had been

used by the insurance industry before this time elsewhere.

It

had not been used by these companies.
The doctors said they were dissatisfied with this
policy and that they went to three other companies* my client
Aetna* Hartford and Travelers* and that those companies would not
sell them any insurance.
QUESTION:

They then filed this action.

At all?

MR. ROaDEITCHHR:

They said they' would not sell them

any insurance at all.
Then they filed this action under the Federal anti­
trust laws.
Now* if I stop there before getting to the question of
boycotts* I will go bach to what I said as to why this case
starkly raises the tension between Section 2(b) and 3(b).

To

start with* this case plainly involved the business of Insurance.
It is the very essence

of the business' of insurance.

The

question is what kind of insurance policies are the companies

7
willing to sell, at what terns?

What policies will be issued?

Rhode Island regulated the business of insurance
extensively.

Everybody accepted it.

how they did regulate it,

It is worth considering

They not only.had a statute aimed at

anticompetitive practice passed in direct response to the
McCarran Act, but at the very time we had what looked like a
race to see who could get there first.

Consider the events.

April 18, 1975,* St. Paul makes its announcement.

Somewhere in

between, unspecified in the complaint, these Plaintiffs decide
that there is some kind of conspiracy.
complaint in this action was filed.

June 1, 1975, the first

June 16, 1975, Rhode Island

commences to join Underwriting Association designed to take over
the business ox insurance and deal with some of the very problems
which are dealt with here, namely, the so-called "medical malprac t ic e insura no e c ris is. "
So we have the spectacle of a Federal court action on
the one hand, the gun directed at what they claim is a con­
spiracy as the cause of this crisis and —
QUESTION:
crisis.

I am wondering why you use the term

Is it because the cost of it has become sc prohibi­

tive, or because of other consequences?
MR. RQSDEITCHER:

I think I call it a crisis, first',,

because the Rhode Island Administrator who issued the regulation
shortly after the action began called it a crisis.

I think it

was a crisis because there was difficulty and I think it is fairly

8
well known,although it is not in the record * that there has been
difficulty In obtaining medical malpractice insurance*, the rates
have gone very high.

What the causes for that are is not the

subject of this action.

And* in our view* what the causes were

Eire matters to be determined by the State of Rhode Island.
QUESTION:

You were using the term "crisis" just with

respect to Rhode Island* not as a national crisis?
MR. RQSDEITCHER:

I think* if I may* I think there

probably was* at the time* a national crisis.

There is a list

of statutes in one of the amicim briefs that something like 37
states* I believe* have enacted similar type of joint under­
writing associations to deal with the problems of tie availa­
bility and the costs of malpractice insurance.
that It is widespread* it is a national crisis.

So fct the extent
Whether every­

body views It as such* I am not; sure.
QUESTION:

Was the policy change approved by the

Insurance Commissioner of Rhode Island?
MR. RC&DEITGHER:

All policy forms have to be approved.

Whether this specific policy change was approved* I don't know.
QUESTION:

Are they approved with or without a hearing

or a general notice to the public?
MR. RQSDEITCHER:

My recollection is that they are

filed, for approval* and that the hearings relate to rates* but;
chat the policy terms* themselves* are filed for approval with
■•he Commissioner

9
QUESTION:

Following up on just this file questions

supposing Rhode Island Insurance Commissioner* or whatever the
body Is, had previously approved of two forms of policy-, one a
claims basis end the other an insurance basia policy.

Would

there be any requirement of Rhode Island law that the insurance
companies* such as St. Paul* must seek the approval of the
Commission if it discontinues the use of one of the two?
MR. RCSDEITCHER:
QUESTION:

I don't know.

That could be done Independently by the

company's own decision* as far as the record tells us* at least?
MR. HQSDEXTCHER:
we know.

As far as the record goes* that's all

This was on a motion to dismiss the complaint.
:

QUESTION:

?

Does the record tell us anything about the

practices of the Rhode Island Insurance Commission with respect
to approval or disapproval of policy conditions that may be filed
with it?
MR. RGSDEXTCHER:

No* it doesn' t,except to the extent

that it has the statutes and the regulations in it.

But I might

say* Mr. Justice Rehnquist* that in our view the practice

in

Rhode Island* the way that thej enforce it* the effectiveness of
the enforcement* are not pertinent to the question which is
raised by the McCarran-Ferguson Act.

Whether there is an effec­

tive method* whether the enforcement is vigorous or whether it
is passive is really an issue which this Court has earlier de­
cided in the

National Casualty case is not a question appropriate

10

for a Federal court to review in a McCarran Act case.
QUESTION:

You say, then, that the State of Rhode

Island, under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, could simply say,
"We are going to have total free enterprise in insurance in
Rhode Island, so there will be no need for State regulation,"
and that would be sufficient to exempt it from the Antitrust Act?
MR. RQSDEITCHER:

I am not sure whether if they simply

said, "We are not going to pass any law/'
this.

Let me review what they did do.

they could have done

They passed a statute

which was directed at unfair methods and anticompetitive methods
of competition.

They defined certain of those methods, including

boycott, coercion and intimidation, which they outlawed.

Then

they left to the Commissioner the same kind of power that the
Federal Trade Commission has to define anticompetitive practices
as they go.

What I am saying ns that that statute, that statute

was enough, as many cases have held and as I believe this Court
effectively held in the FTC~i>Ia 1:iona^^Cagjjalty case.

And I am

saying that that statute reflects Rhode Island policy and re­
flects a kind of regulation which meets the requirements of
.lection 2(b) to trigger the exemption.
I had come to the point where we — or I pointed out
•shat, first, the business of insurance was plainly involved, the
heart of it, that Rhode Island extensively regulates in a variety
of ways.

And I must say that the unfair practices statute,

itself, would have been enough regulation without more.

I added

11

that this case is a starker situation because Rhode Island had
actually taken steps to focus on the problems of cost and avail­
ability of malpractice Insurance.
The First Circuit* however* held that these Plaintiffs
could maintain the suit because they had alleged a concerted
refusal by the three companies to sell malpractice insurance to
the dissatisfied policyholders of St, Paul who* when they
couldn't get the occurrence basis policy from St. Paul* sought
eoverage from the other three,

In so doing* the First Circuit

rejected not only the District Court and the views of the dis­
senting judge there* but a number of other decisions in ether
circuits which expressed this fear about that kind of inter­
pretation* that "if you focus on just a concerted refusal to
deal" without more* then virtually any corroborative conduct
among insurance companies could be filed and pleaded «as a boycott.,
f

Lf the boycott meant a concerted refusal to deal and is equiv­
alent with it.
Now* some other courts have looked at Southeastern
Underwriters in the legislative history and have concluded that
Lt was limited -- that phrase "boycott* coercion and intimidation '
was limited to type of conduct involved in Southeastern Under­
writers* directed at insurance companies*at ’excluding insurance
companies in the business*afc forcing them to behave in the way
the conspiracy dictated.
They limited the provision to insurance agents* aimed

12

at suppressing or dictating the policies of insurance companies
and insurance agents.
is necessary.

Vie do not say that that particular gloss

What we do say is that the result which the First

Circuit achieved here* which was to define a boycott In the way
which would virtually swallow up the rest of the 2(b) exemption,
need not have occurred and that the First Circuit v.ns wrong when
it concluded that it was compelled to reach this!result by the
plain meaning of the phrase "boycott, coercion and intimidation."
Now, I start my statutory analysis where I think the
Government does and probably ny opponent end most of the com­
mentators and Judge McGowan
Proctor case.

And that is with Southeastern Underwriters,

because, lo and behold, tie phrase "boycott, coercion and in­
timidation" appears in fcl.w Southeastern Underwriters case.
there, what happened was /his,

Nov;

And It is crucial to focus in

the two types of conduct which Southeastern Underwriters dealt
with.
To start i ith, there was a price-fixing conspiracy on
fire insurance throughout the Southeastern part .of the United
States.

'V-' ’-be court called that price-fixing.

In addition

to the ' - ice-fixing conspiracy, there was a conspiracy among the
■Qfjr’C-'S of the Southeastern Underv/rifcers Association to tell
eryone to do business on their terms.
forms,

And that took two

First, there was conduct which was specifically directed

at other insurance companies and agents,

In the case of

13

Insurance companies# one of the principal ways was to refuse to re­
insure their risks.

And this was vital and they withdrew rein­

surance from any company which was unwilling to follow the pricefixing conspira c y.
In the case of the agents# they had something called
the "separation."

And they said to the agent# "If you handle

the product of a price-cutter# we are going to put you out of
business because we are not going to sell you any insurance."
Another way they dealt with this was they sold fire insurance
in allied lines.

And they said to the consumer# "If you deal

with one of these price-cutters on fire insurance# we are not
going to sell you other products.
with you at all,"

Vis are just not going to deal

in order to induce those policyholders not

to deal v.'ith the price-cutters.
Now# we think that S nuthsas tern Underwrlters# itself#
demonstrates what the Ccurfc -- not only what the Court -- but
what Congress must have meant by boycott# coercion and .intimi­
dation.
I'd like to draw a line# if I could.

On the one hand#

you have the question of the policy of competition.

That's what

the Sherman Act and the antitrust laws are all about# to foster
competition between companies.

Under the Sherman Act# if there

were no McCarran Act# companies getting together and deciding
they wouldn't compete# wouldn't sell insurance to their competi­
tor's policyholders would be a violation of the Sherman Act.

14

Section 2(b) of the IlcCa r ran-Fergus on Act, however,
says, '’the general question of whether a State should have a
policy of competition or non-competition insurance should be
for the State.;l

If the State enacts legislation dealing with

that area, then the State occupies the field and the Sherman Act
is withdrawn.
Now, what did Congress reserve?
it said one thing was different.

In the boycott section,

That is, it is me thing f<m

people not to compete with one another and for the State, either
by an authorizing law or by a little Sherman Act or a little
:?TC Act to pursue a policy of competition-noncompetition, or a
policy somewhere in between.
It is another thing for the private companies to take
it into their own hands to say that those who do want to compete
and are permitted to compete should be excluded from the business,
land that pressure should be applied to those who want to compete
not to deal with those people in order to exclude those who wish
to compete.
In short, a boycott, coercion, and intimidation,
however you use those phrases, whether separately or singly,
is a kind of penal enforcement conduct aimed at regulating compe­
tition by excluding those who vjill want to compete.

And as I

see the line, on one side you. have agreements between companies
which the State either can prohibit or can apply rule of reason­
ableness tests of outlaw, per se, just as under the Sherman Act

15

a re authorized* or on the other hand conduct which says* "We.
the private industry* will decide who does business and we will
decide who can compete."
And that* in our view* that pressure to prevent people
who do want to compete from competing* ie boycott* eoei-eion and
intimidation.

that is, pressure applied to the customer not to deal with the

of business, to put the fellow who doesn't want to obey the
price-fixing conspiracy out of business.

And unless you draw

some such line, you nullify* you erase any distinction between
what was left out in Section 2(b) and withdrawn from the Sherman
Act and what is covered by the Boycott Section.
And what you describe, Mr. Justice Whites* did not

reaching the boycott

How do we know, without even

question, how do we know that 2(b)

17

withdraws an agreement among three competitors not to sell to
a particular customer from the coverage of the Sherman Act?
MR e RQSDEITCHEH.

Let me take that in two stages.

The first problem is that 2(b) is divided into two
parts.

Notice that the first part is very different, or some­

what different, from the second part.

The first part talks

generally and says "Cor/reus U~ali not invalidate, impair or
t

supersede any State 7/w."
QUESTION'

Correct*

MR * ROOT1 EITCHER:
QUESTION:

Then you have the proviso

So you rely u that first part?

MF» RGSDeITCKER:

No, we vely on the second part.

It simply said the Sheman Act, Clayton Act, and so

forth, will not apply ?fe all.

That meant that if you just read

18

It that way that at the end of the moratorium, period you would
have to have a statute which was invalidated, impaired or super­
seded, in order to be affected by the 2(b) provision*

But they

stuck another provision In there, the one I just read about the
antitrust laws, which says that if the States regulate — well,
it says it backwards ~~ but it does say what happens at the end
of the moratorium,
QUESTION:

Does it not say:

"At the end of the

moratorium, the Sherman Act shall apply to the extent that the
business is not regulated by State law"?
MR, ROSEEITCHER;
QUESTION:

Right,

Now, is this boycott, this alleged boycott

•»« I know you don't like the word "boycott" for this — but I
mean it is the refusal to deal — is that regulated by State
law?
MR, RGSDE1TCHER:
accepted by this Court.
I've talked about.

Yes.

In this way and in a way

I will leave out all the other statues

The record is very clear that Rhode Island

has an unfair practices statute which says, specifically, "Vie
are passing this in response to the McCarran Act.

Vie intend to

regulate all competitive practices in the business of insurance.
And we provide, among other things, incidentally, that boycotts
are unlawful, coercion, intimidation are unlawful.

And we give

to the Insurance Commissioner the power, like the Federal Trade
C coals s ion , tc decide on a case by case basis what other practices

19

(.should be struck down as unfair methods of competition."
Now* we know that price-fixing under the Federal Trade
Commission Act has long ago been considered as unlawful* per se*
under the FTC Act.

We don’t know what the policy is going to be

;l.n this particular case* if any* in the case of the conduct
alleged here.

But that is precisely what the McCarran-Ferguson

Act leaves to that State Insurance Commission,
a number of things.

He could decide

lie could say this conduct is unlawful* per

se* just like the Federal one.

Well* if he does* then he’s clone

one of the things that he could have done In light of the fact
that Congress left him with the power to regulate.

He could

also have said* "I don’t accept Federal law in this area.

I'm

closer to the ground*" one of the courts has said about the
reason for the McCarran Act. "I know things better,

I understand

this problem at lot better than the Federal Government does.
There may be some reasonable justification here* so I an going
to consider that."
QUESTION}

That’s his prerogative.
What if he 3ays it is not an unfair practice

within the meaning of the Rhode Island statute?

Then whet

happens?
MR, RQSDEITCHER:
QUESTION:

Then he has accepted the justification.

Is be regulating or not regulating when he

cays it?
MR, R0SDEJTCH3R:
the precise issue*

He’s regulating* because that was

Your Honor* in FTC v. Casualty,

Let me go

20

back to that case because it has great application here.

In

FTC v. National Casualty, the question was whether certain
advertising practices in insurance companies were regulated by
the Federal'Trade Commission Act.

This Court said that because

the States had a law which prohibits unfair and deceptive prac­
tices, that that law ousts the Federal jurisdiction altogether.
This Court didn't say that the local administrator had to con­
clude, like the FTC that it was deceptive.

In fact, one of the

premises of the briefs before the court was that that was pre­
cisely where the conflict could arise? because't*1® State
Administrator jould decide.

I don't think this is deceptive;, in

my knov?ledge of the insurance business, this isn't deceptive.
And I say here the State should be free.

And I think

that was precisely the intent of Section 2(b), to leave under
this regulatory law the power to the States to decide should
this agreement alleging this complaint, should that conduct
be deemed anticompetitive.
In fact, Rhode Island took a different course here.
Rhode Island didn't look: to hobgoblins of conspiracies.
it said, "There is a real problem

Instead

We are going to deal

with it with a joint underwriters association,

the methods used

by other States in other areas. "
VJe think there is regulation.

It is in the record.

I am sorry if I misspoke myself about the question of policy

21

approvals earlier.
I think the line that we are trying to draw here
between boycott, on the one hand, enforcement activity designed
to pressure other people to stop competing, and competition and
policies of competition, on the other side, is not only concerned
by Southeastern Underwriters, it is equally concerned by other
cases in this Court.

Judge Kaufman was persuaded that his re­

sult was compelled by the plain meaning of the statute.

The

plain meaning, first of all, of boycott, coercion, intimidation
isn't all that plain, in our view, but we went back and looked
at the boycott cases, not only of Southeastern Underwriters
where the conduct was entirely different from last year, but
at Fashion Originators* Guild,, ate Eastern Retail Lumber, and so
forth.
thread.

And in each of those cases, you find the same common
You find conspirators getting together to try to

dictate the terms on which someone will compete and to force
out of business these who will not listen to the conspiracy
terms dictated by the conspirators.
QUESTION:

Does Broadway-Hale v, Klors fit into

that category?
MR. RQBDEITCHER:

Broadway-Hale fits into the

second part of the definition, to exclude them altogether.
That is, where competitors get together to either refuse to
deal entirely or refuse to deal in part, in order to exclude
one of the competitors of one of the conspirators from business

22
entirelyi regardless of what he does.
exactly that case.

And Broadway Hale was

And, again, that case is not involved here.

I could suppose — and there are cases, and this is
what helped us change and modify our view a little bit
in considering the Proctor case or in considering the Ballard
case, where if it were alleged that the doctors got together
and said,"let's finish off this class of doctors over here, let's
induce the insurance companies not to give them any insurance,"
that that would be a boycott, in ray view, under the standard
court case.
QUESTION: The doctors got together, you said?
MR. RGSDEITCHER:

Let's suppose -- I am Just making

a hypothetical — that a bunch of doctors in Providence who
didn't like this group of doctors said,

Finally, I would like to make one last point,
would like to return to the point I started.
dr

I

I know I am eating

Into my rebuttal time, but I think I'll do that, if the Court
pleases*
And that is back where I started from to the policy
of the Act*
purpose.

I think this Act does have a relatively clear

In other words, to defer — to have the Federal power

to defer in the area of regulation of insurance business, and
where the States have regulated it, .to put policies of com­
petition in the hands of the States.

24
In this case* I think the decision of the First
Circuit nullifies that purpose, because, as I said earlier,
the key area of regulation left to the States was the relation­
ship between insurance companies and policyholders and matters
affecting the terms, rates and availability of coverage for the
policyholder.
That’s exactly what’s involved here.

I think that

Judge Kaufman's decision, although we don't have to: show

an

actual conflict in the State regulatory policy anu the Sherman
Act, in order to trigger the 2(b) exemption, I think there is
a conflict and there Is an area of conflict involved here.
And that area is this.

First, questions of con­

spiracy are always questions of fact.

And different fact­

finders can view those facts differently, depending on what
they understand to be the -underlying conditions, and they
could very well come to a very different factual conclusion
from viewing all the facts.

In any case, either under its

unfair methods of competition law or In deciding whether to
use that law or employ a joint underwriters’ association.
So there can be inconsistent conclusions of fact as to what
the causes of the medical malpractice problems here Mere.

There could be different conclusions ae to what
standard of law should apply, whether Me should apply the per
se rule which applies to the agreements not to compete under
the Federal antitrust laws, or whether you should apply some

25

rule of reason test*

Perhaps there was some justification.

Perhaps things were so bad that the Insurance Commissioner
said, ‘‘Well, it isn’t so bad if these guys said.* ’Look let's
stop selling these policies and drive us all insolvent and
no one will have any malpractice insurance, 1::
I think there are other areas where the decision of
the First Circuit threatened accepted insurance practices.
That Is not crucial to my positioni but I think it is true.
Respondent has said if you have a joint insurance group* like
the Jt7A,( and if you take cancer to the one side and the First
Circuit‘s decision to the other* that you have to conclude
that in every case of refusal of coverage under the JUA, it is
possible to commence a Federal antitrust suit and claim that
that Is a concerted refusal by the members of the JUA to deal
with that policyholder,
It may be wrong.
and that will save It.

They say apply a rule of reason

That won't save it at all* because the

question of reasonableness is precisely the question which was
left to the States8insurance departments.

For all those

reasons* reasons of policy* for reasons of making this statute
meaningful and work*, we suggest that the line we propose should
be drawn, and that the boycott, coercion end intimidation should
be limited to what was involved in Southeast -Underwriters and,
other boycott cases, namely pressure by competitors to prevent
other people from engaging in a policy of competition,
Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Decof,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD DEC01% ESQ. *
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR0 DEC OF:

Mr., Chief Justice* and may it please the

Court j
At the outset* this case seemed to revolve about a
very finite and very limited issue* that is* the construction
of Section 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act,

But as it

evolved* the position of the Petitioners shifted from one
point to another.

And I say this not in a pejorative i -y*

but I think to give the context and the histtry of the case
to the Court and to illustrate the weakness of the various
positions that the Petit

rs have retreat’d to* it would

cast some light on the weakness of their present position.
First, the case was brought in the District Court
of Rhode Island, and the case was dismissed upon Petitioner's
motion* based on the sc-called "blacklisting limitation" which
Petitioners ascribed to 3(b) of McCarran-Ferguson,
And in the Circuit Court of Appeals the vary same
limitation was urged.
Now., Petitioners pointed to one thing ;l.u the
Congressional Record, in the legislative.history* to support
their argument for blacklisting.

And that was a statement of

Congressman Culler which merely cited blacklisting as an
example, when he said* "Tor example* where 3(b) prevents

27
blacklisting.11

But * at least* at that point * Petitioners were

pointing to something in the legislative history which could
support their position.
At the present stage* since Proctor -- and* by the
way* there have been a number of cases which have taken the
same position as Proctor.

I think there are cases now in the

First* Second* Third* Fourth Circuits* part of the Fifth
Circuit* in the Battle case and the D.C. Circuit which Is
Proctor.

They all take the position that "Well* we don’t ask

that the limitation of 3(b) be narrowed to blacklisting* but
we say it should be narrowed to include all traders."

And

implicit In their argument* may it please the Court* is that
it must exclude consumers.
Now* Petitioners* in the reply brief on page 3* state
in the second paragraph*

"The only issue here now is to cl raw

the line between boycotts and other combinations and conspira­
cies in restraint of trade co/ered by the Sherman Act* so as
to give meaning to the expressed exemption of 2(b) of the
McCar ran -Ferguson Act.:i
Petitioners are now asking this Court to go outside
3(b)* outside McCarran-Ferguson and give a definition of a boy­
cott under the Sherman Act* the Sherman Act itself* which will
fit into their description and thereby exclude Petitioners,
And they set forth their proposed definition in the
alternative,

The first prong of their definition* I think —>

28

QUESTION:

Do you challenge the legitimacy of their

suggestion that the word "boycott” be given interpretation*
in view of the MsCarran-Ferguson language?
MR* DEOOF;
the very outsat.

Yes* Your Honor* we challenge this from

When the action was brought in the District

Court* the Petitioners* then defendants* moved to dismiss on
the grounds of McCarran-Ferguson«

We replied — Plaintiffs

replied — but there was boycott* coercion and intimidation
alleged and therefore vie came within the 3(b) exclusion.
Petitioners* then defendants* rejoined by stating*

but

that was limited to blacklisting under McCarran-Ferguson."
QUESTION:

Doesn’t the issue join then on the

meaning of the word "boycott" in 3(b)?
24R. DEC OF:

The issue* at that time* was joined on

the meaning of the word boycott in 3(b)* and that issue was
argued before the First Circuit.
QUESTION:
MR, DECOF:

Are we arguing it here now?
Well* if the Court please* our position

is that the Petitioners have shifted from this because

—

originally* their argument was bottomed or» the mrertion that
boycott* under 3(b) had a different meaning than boycott under
the Sherman Act.
Now* they state in their reply brief that the problem
here is to define the limit of boycott under the Sherman Act.
That leads us to the conclusion they now agree that boycott under

29

the Sherman Act is the same as boycott under 3(b),

If they

have come to that position* then they must take the position
that Congress in enacting 3(b) meant to do something which was
not just an illusion* and did not mean to give by one hand and
take away by the other»
%

QUESTION:

So you both get down to the question of

the meaning of the word — at least in part — of the word
"boycott" in 3(b)»
MR» DEC OF:

Your Homo y we do get down to the question

of the meaning of the word "boycott" in 3(b)* but which is now*
I believe* by Petitioners' position# correlated to the meaning
of boycott under Sherman,
And I think th?ir position before this Court is
>

that the meaning of boy* otfc is limited# but it is limited not
because of 3(b)# but because ;_ts meaning under Sherman should
foe limited.
QUESl * DM:
MR. .D3CGF:

What ‘ u your pos it ion?
Our : >sition# if the Court please* is

that if you rfply — first of all# our first position is that#
even under tie definition that Petitioners proposed*the
Respondents her® have standing and fall within that definition#
within the second fom o

that definition.

Our second position is that the definition is unduly
restrictive and unduly limiting* because by its very nature it
excludes all consumers as 'letIds of boycott»

It injects into

the definition of boycott intent* which this Court has said on
many* many occasions is not a consideration: in the definition
of boycott.

The Court has said that the effect is a considera­

tion, but that the intent is immaterial.
Silver.

They have said t’-is in

They have said it in Frankfurt Dlst111erics and many

other cases, if the Court please.
Vie take the position that the simple answer to their
proposed definition is we do not fall outside the limitation.
The first prong of their definition is that there must be a
competitor of the victim as one of the conspirators.

As I

say, the second prong, they say that the boycott must be an
act which is directed to control the competitive activity of
the victim.
Nov;, the act ~~ we fit within the second definition,
if the Court please* -because the act of boycott in this case
controls the commercial activity of the victims.,that is the
doctors,
Since the Petitioners have raised, the question of
an underwriting problem, I must put that into context as back­
ground to get into this.
please.

Thin was not a race* if the Court

There was a medical malpractice crisis in the State

of Rhode Island, but the crisis was ignited by this situation
where almost half the doctors — more than half the doctors
in the State of Rhode Island, were insured by St, Paul.
of their policies were going to expire on June 30, 1975-

Most

31

In April# St* Paul announced that their policies would not be
renewed except on a claims made basis * and I must touch on the
nature of the claims made policy to illustrate what this meant,
The claims made policy would insure the doctor only in
the year in which the policy was in effect# even if the doctor
>

had been insured by the same company in the year in which the
occurrence took place*

The doctors' position was that this

locked them in for life with the company# because once the
first claims made policy was issued# the doctors must stay with
that company.

If they decided# for example# to change Juris­

dictions and move to a State in which# for example# St. Paul
did not sell medical malpractice insurance# they would have to
have double coverage for this reason.

Since the claims made

policy insured them only for one year at a time, if they siiouxu
retire of if they should die# or if they should leave the
company they would have to buy coverage for any action which
might be brought against them in later years# whether because
the statute had not expired# whether because: it was a discoverability type action# for whatever reason.

And this coverage

could be afforded to them by means of a so-called "three
reporting involvement,"
stallments,

They had to be bought in three in­

And so if a doctor wanted to leave the juris­

diction# once he had signed up with St, Paul on a claims made
basis# he would have to'buy three reporting endorsements which
would cover him for any actions that were.'brought after the

32

year in which he left,, because he had been insured in the
year — Now* if he went to another State* he would have to
have double coverage and the cost of these reported endorsements
would coiae to about 150$.
this plan

And so the pernicious feature of

and it was an ingenious plan

was that the doctor

was locked in.

He couldn’t leave the State.

He couldn’t retire

from practice.

If he died* his wife or his heirs would have 30

days to decide whether or not they would buy the reported
endorsements which would cover actions which were brought after.
QUESTION:

What if «'ill the malpractice insurers in

the country had jointly «announced the same policies that
St. Paul announced?

Wouldn’t that have had precisely the

same effect on the doctors?
MR, DECOP:

If the Court please* I think* in that

situation*this Court or the Federal court would have the right
to look at the factual situation to see if it did* in fact*
constitute a boycott* in the first instance.

The defendant's

position is that this Court should be frozen to the definition
of boycott which has been established in previous cases because
of the fact situation in those cases.

In many instances* the

Court has locked to the fact --- In the first instance* this
Court applied the rule of reason and decided originally in
the Northern Pacific Railway case that If the activity was
pernicious and had no redeeming

features* it was a boycott.

Now* we can’t say now — I don't think the Court

33
would be willing fco say now -- but everything outside those
circumscribed fact situations is not a boycott.
In the situation in our proposal, it would be a
fact situation on which the Court could decide whether or not
this was a boycott, and if it was a boycott then.lt came
within the protection of 3(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act,
We are not at that question at the moment.
My definition of a boycott

if the Court cares

to hear it — I don’t think the Court has to go this far.

We

are saying that what happens here was a classic boycott,

It

was a denial of 75% of the insurance market fco the doctors.
And the thing:

that we kept within the second category of the

Petitioners 8 definition ■»- because in our society doctors cannot
practice their profession without medical malpractice insurance.
It is the same fco them as buying a scalpel or stethoscope,
And this is what propelled Rhode Island into a medical mal­
practice crisis.
of facts.

The JUA was formed as a result of this set

It was not something that was boiling in the pot

while this action was taking place.
this set of facts.

The JUA resulted from

The JUA is a creature of emergency.

It

was promulgated by the Director of Business Regulations of the
State of Rhode Island, because the situation was that the
doctors had asked the State to put a frees© on legislation
so that the matter could be looked into and the insurance
companies had threatened to pull out of the State of Rhode

34
Island if the freezing legislation was pub in.
So the JUA is really inimical to the idea of

-

free enterprise, because the way the JUA was set up all companies
in the State of Rhode Island had to belong to a risk pool.
And this was e condition of their doing business In the State.
The fact of the matter is that the companies vociferously
complained about the JUA, rebelled against it.

And it is an

emergency type.- of legislation, a police state type of thing.
The State of Rhode Island certainly doesn't want to be in the

insurance business,
happen.

And this isn't the kind of thing that should

Our argument is if the balance were restored there

wouldn't be any JUA,

But, again, the simple answer to the

question of tie JUA Is that it is immaterial here because when
this action wag brought there wasn't a JUA,
QUESTION:

One point you emphasise, or seem to

emphasise, leads me to ask you vihat States in the country sre
there in which the St. Paul Company does not do business?
MH, DECOF:

There are a number of States in the

country, if the Court please, to my knowledge, in which the
St/ Paul does not do business.

There are only four companies

in the State of Rhode Island which sell medical malpractice
Insurance.( Throughout the United States -- and here, again,
this is something that has never been gotten into.

And I think

because of McCarran-Ferguson there seems to be a territorial
allocation In which certain companies deal in certain States.

35
In my opinion -- and I am very familiar with the mal­
practice scene in the State of Rhode Island.

I was on the

Governor's Commission which ended up enacting the new legis­
lation

the claims experience in the State of Rhode Island*

to my knowledge* has been an excellent one.

And I wonder why

haven’t there been other companies, besides these four Respon­
dents, these four Petitioners.
But my answer to Your Honor’s question, sir. Is that
there are a number of Jurisdictions in the United States where
St. Paul does not sell medical malpractice insurance.

By the

(?)

same token, companies like;Argenot which deal heavily in mal­
practice insurance are not in the State of Rhode Island.
Now, we say, if the Court please, that the definition
of boycott, even if you limit it,is a concerted refusal fco deal,
which has as its effect a restraint on commerce, a restraint on
trade.

Purpose has been counted immaterial, as I said before,

in many cases by this Court.

And the effect of this boycott

the only boycott that is before this Court is where the com­
panies refuse, absolutely, to sell insurance of any kind to
the doctors who were insured by St. Paul, a classic boycott.
And the only way that this could be removed from that defini­
tion is to say a consumer cannot be the victim of a boycott.
This leads us to the anomalous conclusion that a
consumer who is protected under the Sherman Act — this is
square one law and the Petitioners perceived this — may be

36
protected against an act which harms him by virtue of an in­
direct boycott, but cannot be protected from the identical
ham when it's aimed directly at him.
Now., Chief Justice Hughes in the Appalachia case stated
that "the''Sherman Act deals in substance.”
dealing with substance.

And we are here

And this is why I am urging to this

Court that we have a very grave issue here.

Petitioners are

asking that the Court examine boycott, the definition of boycott,
and arrive at — pronounce a definition which will exclude con­
sumers from protection, either because they are not competitive
of the boycotter or because they are not engaged in some com­
peting business with the boycotter.
QUESTION:

The answer to that question turns on the

meaning of boycott, as used in the Me Car ran -F e r gus on Acfcj does
it not?
MR. DEC OF:

Yes, Your Honor.

But the legislators, in

adopting the McCarran-Ferguson Act, we submit, intended boycott
to have the same meaning that it has in the Sherman Act.
answer the emasculation idea this way.

We

First of all, to answer

Petitioners' contention that almost anything could be defined
in terms of a boycott, the Court many times has distinguished
between the act or the grievance,

for example, price-fixing

and the concerted activity to carry it out.

There are many

proscribed actions under Sherman which are not boycott, for
example, a conspiracy to crush a competitor.

This could be

37
carried out without a boycott* in any number of ways* by stealing
trade secrets* by stealing employees* by false advertising and
so forth,

Tie-in agreements need not be enforced by the boycott.

The entire Section 2 on monopolies* that's not boycott.

So*

even if you gave the fullest range to the meaning of boycott in
the McCa man-Fergus on * and therefore insured the protection
that Sherman guaranteed to the public* there is still a vast
area of Insulation for the insurance companies reserved by the
Me Ca rran-Fergus on.

Besides this* McCa man-Fergus on insulated

the insurance companies against any action brought under the
other antitrust acta* the Clayton Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act* the Robinaon-Pafcfcon Act.

This* again* is a

vast area of protection.
Finally, the insurance companies were insulated by
McCarrari-Ferguson against any action brought under any other
federal legislation that didn't relate directly to insurance,
So* with reference to the emasculation argument* I believe it
is an artificial argument.

There is a great area of protection

still reserved to the insurance companies.
Again* with reference to the definition of boycott*
if we put that aside* there have been allegations of intimida­
tion and coercion.

And the legislators made it plain that boy­

cott* coercion and intimidation were not the same thing.

As a

matter of fact* Senator O'Mahoney said* "We are talking about
six things here that the'state doesn't have power to regulate*

38
boycott, coercion, intimidation or the agreement to do any of
these things
So that again, is an Issue that transcends the issue
of boycott.
Now, Petitioners have relied greatly and spent a great
deal of their time in their briefs and in their arguments on
the question of whether or not this is State regulation, and
whether or not we are in an area of State regulation.
We don't deny this and never have.

Respondent's

position is not that the State of Rhode Island is not engaged
in the regulation of insurance.

However, the fact that they

are engaged in the regulation of insurance does not permit them
to authorize acts of boycott, coercion and intimidation.

This

has been specifically carved out of that protection.
And this Court has not been reluctant to look at
McCarran-Ferguson cases.

For example in SEC y. Variable

Annuities, the Court determined what the scope of insurance was.
There was no question there was regulation of insurance, but,in
that case.the Court determined the Variable Annuity policy vias
•

.

v.

not within the scope of the business of insurance.
In SEC v. Travelers, the Court determined the scope
of State regulation.

And, again, in that situation, the

'question was whether or not the Travelers and seme of these
policies, outside of State by mail — although it had an Act which
purported to regulate these things, what was the extent and what

39
was the limit of that regulation?
And in a most important ease* the Frankfort Distillery
caser»it was not a McCarran case, but it was a Millard Tydings
Act case — in the Frankfort Distillery case, the State of
Colorado had a Fair Trade Practices Act which allowed the fixing
of prices, and the Millard Tyings Act gave them the right to do
this, so they were regulating in this area.
involved in forcing the fixing of prices.

There was a boycott
And the State said

that even though they are permitted by the provisions of Millard
Tydings to fix prices — and even though they are permitted by
the Twenty«>first Amendment to do this, that, still and all,that
didn’t permit them to engage in activities of boycott, coercion
or intimidation which would be beyond the scrutiny of the Federal
court.
Again, the third casa I wanted to cite with reference
to McCarran-Ferguson was SEC v. National Securities, in which
the Court determined what was an insurance policy.

And this was

a case in which there was a prosecution by the SEC against the
defendant company for misstatements and misrepresentations made
to stockholders of the company which it was going to merge with.
And there was a law that the director of insurance in the State
had to approve any mergers.,

Wow, the SEC first brought an action

for injunction and this was denied because it was held to be
insurance and regulated by the State.

And when the merger went

through,the SEC then brought an action to unwind the merger.

40

And this Court said, "Even though it was the .insurance director's
obligation to approve the merger, and even though he did approve
I

the merger"

he didn't say to these people, "You must merge,"

all he said was, "You can," and I find it to be adequate.
But the Court held also that this could be reviewed and that
McCarran-Perguson did not insulate the State from the action.
Mow, this case is not even as strong on its facts as
the Barr;/ case, because in the EEC v. National Securities, case,
the State had passed legislation authorizing and directing the
-Director of Insurance to approve such a merger and he had acted
and had done it.

In the Barry case, there has never been any

action by the State of Rhode Island to authorize the acu here.
And, as a matter of fact, I believe that Petitioners will con­
cede this.

There couldn't be.

If the State of Rhode Island did

say, "We authorize boycott, coercion and intimidation to enforce
this price-fixing," this would be a nullity.
QUESTION:
is a boycott?

Mr. Decof» of course, the problem is:

What

In your view, under the statute, if four compan­

ies got together and agreed on a territorial allocation, each
took a quarter of the State and each agreed not to sell in the
other three quarters; would that be a boycott?
MR. DEC OF:

If the Court pi.ease, my position would ue

and I hope that it is not a quibbling one, that this would

It would be a per sg

How do you decide whether

it's a boycott, or not?
MR, DiSCOF:

In my opinion, if the Court please -- I

say in this case, you don't h; v e to -- but if the Court wants
to circumscribe or define the limits of boycott, I would say a
boycott would be a concerted refuse! to deal which deprives the
victim of the freedom of choice in a market.
QUESTION:
MR, DEC OP:

Well, my example vould be a boycott?
Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

But that's about the' same.-as .an. agree

not to sell to people outside their geographical territory,
the same kind of agreement, isn't it?
MR, DECOF:

Yes.

I have in mind, if the Court please, the Schwin
case and its subsequent overruling by GTE Sylvania, where we had

42

horizontal territorial
tions,,

we had vertical territorial alloca­

And the Court in GTE Sylvania said we will apply the

rule of reason.

The Court said* at the same time* "We are not

saying that a vertical restriction cannot be a per se violation.
We will apply rule of reason."
applying the rule of reason,
reason could be applied.

And I would not take issue with
1 would say., in this case^a rule of

There have been some lower court cases,

like Macke v, NFL, in which the Court held that the Hoselle rale
was a boycott, but applied a rule of reason.

I would only say

that this Court has not taken that step.

And 1 can understand

the Court's reasons for the per se rule,

I think there are

excellent reasons for it, to have a bright line so that business
and the courts can conduct themselves by some standard in an area
that is, at best, very murky.

But I don't take the position

that we have to rigidly freeze a definition into which all sorts
of facts that come hereafter must fit or must be rejected as
not a boycott.
And it may.be that the rule of reason would be the
answer in a cs.se such as Your Honor's.

I know the Court, after

Schwln, was very much bothered because in the White .Motors case
the Court had said, "lie are unfamiliar with this area.

We have

to know a lot more about it before we can decide it."
QUESTION:

You are really discussing the question of

whether a per se or a rule of reason approach applies.
not the problem.

But that's

The problem is whether it is a boycott or not,

43
which is, I suppose, a species of a per se violation.
MR, DEGOF:

If the Court please, the per se violation

and the rule of reason get us into a circular argument in
semantics which I noticed earlier in the research in this case.
At sane time the Court applied a rule of reason to describe ^hafc
a boycott is.

That was at Level One,

Maybe

now* certain

things are a boycott and we get into an exercise as to whether
something is a boycott and you may undo the pernicious nature
of it by applying a rule of reason at the second step.

Or*

whether or not* you say something when you determine that some­
thing is a boycott.

The Court* in the first instance* applied

a rule of reason and said* "Because of these facts* we have &
boycott,"

To me* it is immaterial at which step you apply the

rule of reason. Or* what I am saying is that we may be* because
of changing times* launched into a situation where a set of
facts occurs' -- and this is as good an example as I can think ~~
this new creature* this claims made policy* this ingenious
device

a sat of facts occurs which was not anticipated

originally.

And then I say maybe the Court is in the position*

without abandoning the per se rule* of saying* "We are back
where we were when we decided fact situation

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Friedman,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.
FOR THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the Court.
The Governmentrs position in this case is that a
boycott under Section 3(b) of McCarran“Ferguson means a con­
certed refusal to deal* when people get together and refuse to
deal with someone* a situation which means that the victim of
the boycott finds himself excluded from the section of the mar­
ket which Is represented by the people who are combining in this
endeavor to exclude him.
And that's* we think* precisely what is alleged in
this case.

The charge in thi£ case is that the three insurance

companies* other than St, Pau3, even refused to entertain appli­
cations for insurance from any of the doctors* hospitals and
other medical personnel whom St. Paul represented.
This is not a charge that the insurance companies
refused to deal with these customers except on particular terms
and conditions.
QUESTION:

Would that be a boycott?

MR, FRIEDMAN:
I think it would have

1 would think probably not* Mr, Justice
to vary from case to case.

It would

45
depend on what it was,

It's possible, of course, that the

particular terms and conditions were so unreasonable that, as ,
a practical matter, it constituted a refusal to deal.
. QUESTION:

Wall, from the Plaintiff's point of view,

if it weren't unreasonable in h:ls view, he wouldn't have sued.
So, from your point of view, it would be a boycott, wouldn't it?
They refuse to deal with me except on these conditions.

They

are boycotting me from dealing with them cm a reasonable basis.
MR, FRIEDMAN:

I don't think that is how this Court

has treated boycott in its decisions under the antitrust laws.
And this, of course, is one of the main points that Petitioners
make here.

They say the problem with defining boycott as

Respondents and the Government define it is that everything,
virtually, that involves Joint action can be framed as a boy­
cott.

And* as we say, that is not hew we think boycott has been

defined«
They give their precise example.

They say, "Well, an

agreement to fix prices could be framed as an agreement not to
sell except upon those prices," and therefore you could describe
this as a boycott.

And if that's what boycott means -- it has

this open-ended meaning — it would corae close to swallowing up
the entire McCarran-Ferguson Act provision giving the States
broad discretion to regulate insurance.
That's not what we think boycott means and that's not
how we think this Court has defined it.

46
QUESTION:

Mr, Friedman, If I could just- Interrupt for

a second, under your definition, as I understand it, three out
the four are refusing to deal on any terms at all and, therefore,
they are participants In the boycott.

But, if we assume that

the claims only offer by St. Paul was a reasonable way of doing
business, St* Paul should be entitled to the exemption; should
it not?
MR* FRIEDMAN:

Except that St, Paul wasn't a party

to the illegal understanding that the other three wouldn't,
but 1 would think St* Paul's — I would put it this way.

I

would think that St, Paul, standing alone, its refusal to sell
except on a claims made basis, I would not think that standing
alone is a boycott.
QUESTION:

(inaudible) -- group action,

I mean an

individual can't engage in a boycott, no matter what he does.
He might engage in very illegal action, but it is not a boycott
unless there are two or more.
MR, FRIEDMAN:

Isn't that right?

That's right. That's what I tried to

suggest,that St, Paul may be participating in the illegal
boycott ■-=
QUESTION:

Does that even hold water?

Because the

four of them have agreed that only St, Paul will sell to them
on this set of terms.

So the four of them have not agreed to

a total refusal to sell to this Plaintiff,
MR. FRIEDMAN:

But the four of them have agreed that

4?
the three will refuse to sell at all.
QUESTION:

But if your definition requires the total

refusal, the group has not made such a total refusal.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I suggested that it requires a refusal

on the part of the people to allow the customers into that
segment of the market»

In other words, the illegal restraint

is that they have refused to permit the doctors access to the
portion of the medical malpractice insurance market represented
by the other three, which is something like 40 or 50$ of the
Rhode Island market.
QUESTION:

That's the essence of it.
Why is that any different than saying we

will refuse to let them deal with any portion of the market
that's willing to sell at less than $1 a thousand, or whatever
the premium rate.
MR® FRIEDMAN:

Because 1 think,traditionally, the

concept of boycott has been used by this Court in the anti­
trust field to deal with the situation where a group of com­
petitors get together -QUESTION:

And all of them refuse to sell.

MR® FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

All of tho.ee who get together.

Presume yoir've got one willing to sell.

MR, FRIEDMAN:

The me who is willing to sell is not

boycotting but the one, nevertheless, may participate in the
understanding by the others.
As far as this case is concerned, the charge in this

43
case, and the only question at this point, I stress, is whether
or not the Respondents should be permitted to go to trial on
their claim.

The charge in this case is that the three compan­

ies, other than St, Paul, refused to deal on any terns, on any
terms, with the large number of doctors to whom St. Paul was
selling insurance.
QUESTION:

Was it ever alleged what the purpose was

of the agrsemen?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

There is an allegation -» there is no

charge with respect to the specific boycott by the three of
them,

There is a charge that the four of them conspired to try

to sell insurance on a claims only basis and to eliminate ~~
QUESTION:

Well, is it alleged that the purpose of

the agreement among the three, the refusal of the three was to
force the doctors to do business on St. Raul's terms?
MR* FRIEDMAN:

I'd have to check that and see,

I

don't think that was specifically alleged, but that, of course,
is the practical consequence of it because the allegation -QUESTION:

Well, whether it was a boycott or not,
\

then would it have been coercion?
MR. FRIEDMAN:' I'm not sure that that kind of economic
coercion is what Congress had in mind in the coercion language
of McCarran-Ferguson,
QUESTION:
under 3(b)

It is either a boycott or it is nothing

49
MRa FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

I think it is clearly a boycott,

Mr, Friedman, what if the big four auto

makers all get together and agree that* “We will not sell a car
to any buyer for less than $10*000"?
MR* FRIEDMAN:
cott,

Is that a boycott?

I wouldn't think that would be a boy­

If it reached the point —
QUESTION:

It's keeping buyers out of the automobile

ma rket.
MR, FRIEDMAN:

It’s keeping some buyers out, but it

seems to me the point could be reached at which it might be a
boycott.

For example* the big four automobile makers got to­

gether and agreed they wouldn't sell automobiles to anyone in a
particular city for less than $100*000.

It seems to me* at some

point* you could say that what seemed to be just a price-fixing
agreement transcended the line because it is something different
now than just fixing the price.

It is obviously something de­

signed and with the effect of excluding.
Let me come to the other point the Petitioners make
and the amicae as well.

They say ii you construe McCarran-

Ferguson to treat this kind of thing — this absolute refusal
to deal -- as a boycott* this* as a practical matter is going
to wipe out the careful system of regulation the States have
built up over the years.

And* again* it's In terms of everything

can be framed as a boycott.

And* therefore* all you have to do

is allege that an.agreement among insurance companies to include

50
particular terms in their policies or particular types of in­
surance is a boycott and* therefore, it is no longer within the
State's exclusive jurisdiction but is subject to MeGarranFerguson.
Now, we come back and say as we interpret boycott,
boycott is not this open-ended *

You can't just take any con­

ceivable thing that results from joint action avid say that it
is a boycott.

We think, under the decisions of this Court, it

is considerably narrower than that, and is best construed -this definition, this provision — to give the States the
authority to continue* basically, what they have been doing,
what they were doing at the time of Southeastern Underwriters»
They can continue to insure the financial solvency of the In­
surance companies, which is an important thing.

They can con­

tinue to control the rates of the insurance.
QUESTION:

Can they ever, though, unless specifically

authorized by Stats law, can they ever jointly refuse to deal
with a group of possible customers?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Well; if it's a boycott, State law

makes no difference.
QUESTION;

Even if State law purported to expressly

authorize that, approve it, it would still be subject to the
antitrust laws.
QUESTION;

Well, it wouldn’t If it was — I take it

you still think the Parker v. Brown approach would be «»

51
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

If it were State action -~

That's what I5m saying.

If It is a

State action — If a State law specifically ordered the com«
panics to act in a certain way.

You would say if they got

together and refused to leal with a group of customers at all*
they are subject to the Sherman Act boycott provisions?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
do that.

Yes.

Unless the State ordered them to

If the State ordered them to -QUESTION:

And it wouldn't be an illegal boycott if

they refused to deal except on certain terms?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That's right.

Unless the terms were

so oppressive that; as a practical matter# the refusal to deal
except on certain terms amounted to a refusal to deal at all.
QUESTION:

Who is going to decide that?

An anti­

trust court# right?
MR, FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

An antitrust court.

So there is not an exemption?

MR. FRIEDMAN:r

It would depend whether the particular

course of conduct -~
QUESTION:

Somebody has to decide that.

So anybody

is free to bring an antitrust action# under your theory.
And# thus

concerted..refusal to deal is tantamount to a boycott

All you have to do is allege that in your complaint and you are
in the antitrust court and the- McCarran«Ferguson Acs is out the
window

Well* that would depend --

No,

You can get into court and the question

Is how fast he gets out now,.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

It can always be phrased that way* but

it seems to me if that's all that it is* if it in fact turns
out to be a prlce~flxing agreement* X would think such a com­
plaint could be rather easily dismissed* either on a motion to
dismiss or a summary judgment,
QUESTION:

But you wouldn't say just a widespread

agreement among insurance companies in Rhode Island* as to the
*

rate at which they would sell medical malpractice insurance*
would be a boycott?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No* we think not.

QUESTION: Even though all of them agree not to do
business with anybody except on those terms?
MR, FRIEDMAN:
be a boycott.

That's right.

We think that would not

That would be a traditional price-fixing agree»

And the one thing that’s clear from McCar ran-Fergus on*

it seems to us* is that Congress intended to take that kind of
an agreement* that kind of a prle3°filing agreement out from
under the Sherman Act and leave it to the discretion of the

53
States directly, because that* of course* was the essence.

That

was one of the most important things in state regulation —
at the time that Southeasterr UnderwrItere — was the rate

QUESTION:

But if St. Paul is.willing to sell at

certain rates or In a certain way and three' other companies lust
get together and say* "We refuse to deal with those putative
customers of St. Paul*" that's a boycott?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That's a boycott.

If they say* "We

refuse to deal with those customers of St. Paul/' that* we
think* Is a boycott.
QUESTION:

Do you think the Federal Court of the

District of Columbia in the Proctor case* that Its criteria
that it worked out were right or wrong?

You don't have to.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

holders.

there,

In answering'a similar argument fco that made,

the contention was that if you applied the Sherman Act,

itself, fco the business of insurance, this would uproot and
destroy State regulation. • . Speaking for the Court, Justice
Black stated, "No States authorize combinations of insurance
companies to coerce, intimidate and boycott, competitors and
consumers in the manner here alleged."
Thank you,
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE &.

very well, Mr. Friedman,

Mr. Rosdeitcher, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIDNEY S. ROSDEITCHER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
!

MR. ROSDEITCHER:

Your Honor, we' ve come a long way

from what Judge Kaufman oaid was the plain meaning of boycott,
because one of the questions Justice Stevens asked was whether
a market allocation is a boycott.

Under the Solicitor General’s

definition, a market allocation which this Court in Topco and

56
Sealy and other cases treated as a market allocation and per se
violation of the antitrust law, becomes a boycott.

So much for

the plain meaning.
I also would like to add that we now have a situation
where conduct which is economically indistinguishable Is
treated as a boycott.

And while it is suggested that we have

come to an artificial meaning, in fact, I believe, the Government's position and Respondents' position a re most artificial,
because the examples we've had of where you have four people
«- four companies -- I think my co-respondents here xvould like
to get out because, apparently, they are not part of the boycott ,
You have four companies.

One of them is willing to sell claims

made and three don't want to sell occurrence since they don't
want to sell anything. So they have to buy claims made,
All four had agreed to sell only claims made.
According to the Solicitor General, that is not a boycott.
The other is.

So, I say there is no logical distinction,

I'd like to Just go back to our position as to why
there is a sound and logical dividing line between what we say
is a boycott and what we say is covered by the 2(b) exemption.
Under our definition, a boycott is exactly what this Court has
used it .in the past for ,

situations where, although the com­

petitors., a group of conspirators, agree among themselves that
they won't sell except at a fixed price, or fixed terms, they
do more.

They prevent the fellow who does want to sell at a

57
different price from coming in*

They decide* in Senator

"to engage in private regulation."

are going to punish that fellow in a variety of ways.

They
In the

Southeastern Underwriters case* as Mr. Friedman correctly points
out* they punish that fellow by cutting off the consumer.

But

it wasn't just i concerted refusal to deal with the consumer.
It was a concert ad refusal to deal with the consumer who had
the temerity to deal with the price-cutter.

eyes to something that I hadn't seen before.

And that was this;

My definition of a boycott* in most cases* would be very much
like the Fifth and Ninth Circuit definitions which went into
insurance agents and insurance* oomnptvl.es,. because *n most cases
other than Southeastern Underwriters* my description and this
Court's definition in use of boycott in past cases -- in the
insurance business* typically* the fellow who is going to be

a competing insurance company.
