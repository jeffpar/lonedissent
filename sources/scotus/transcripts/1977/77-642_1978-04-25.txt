MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 77-642, Parker against Flock.
Mr.. Wallace, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. WALLACE:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

In this case, the the Court of Customs and

Patent Appeals reversed a decision by the Board of Appeals of
the Patents and Trademarks Office, which had sustained the
Patent Examiner's rejection of respondent’s patent claims as
not constituting statutory subject matter within the meaning
of Section 101 of the Patent Code.

That was the sole ground

for rejection of the claim, the sole statutory .issue before
the Court; of Customs and Patent Appeals, and the; only statutory
section that is before the Court now.
At bottom, the Board of Appeals and the Court
differed in their view of the scope and meaning of this
Court's decision in Gottschalk v„ Benson, 409 U.S. 63, which
also involved a reversal of a decision of the court below.
The legal principles at issue in the case are fairly
straightforward and can be addressed, I believe, without
detailed discussion of the technology to which the patent
claims relate in this case. We have set forth some description
of that, in the appendix to our brief.

4
Now, I should remind you that the Season case,
before I get to the facts of this case, involved a process
patent claim, just as this case involved a process patent claim,
and that in Benson the claim was on the method of programming
a general purpose digital computer to convert signals from
binary coded decimal form into pure binary form, another form
of mathematical representation.
The Court there pointed mat a definition of the word
"algorithm," which crops up in these cases and which I seldom
use in between these cases and have a tendency to forget what
it means in between these cases.

The Court there defined an

algorithm as a procedure for solving a given type of mathematical
problem.

There are other possible definitions of algorithm,

but we are talking about mathematical algorithms.

They are

rather similar to formulas, but they are not necessarily
formulas.

They can be expressed in other forms.

But they

are procedures for solving a mathematical problem for calculating
a number, in effect.

And the Court held that the procedures

set forth in the claims in Benson are Cf thur kind, a^generalized
formulation for programs

to solve mathematical problems of

converting one form of numerical representation Into another
in that particular case.
Now, the present case similarly involved a claim of
novelty in a mathematical procedure.

Here it was a procedure

to be applied to familiar technology in adjusting what are

called the alarm limits that are imposed so that corrective
action can be taken, alarm limits on process variables which
are changeable conditions in the process of catalytic conver­
sion of hydrocarbons, a commercial process involved in hydro­
cracking and the like.
The claims are set forth, and I think we can turn
to the claims, on page 63A of the appendix.

There are ten

claims altogether, all of which were rejected as not being
statutory subject matter.

I should add that in one of the

amicus presentations some question is raised about whether the
formula set forth in claim 1, the series of mathematical
solutions, is itself novel.
below.

Ho such question was decided

Wa don’t believe it's before this Court.

In its

present posture in this Court, we have to assume that the
mathematical representations in claim 1 are novel.

That

question would be open to the Examiner on remand should the
decision below be sustained, but nobody has decided it yet.
QUESTION;

Mr. Wallace, you told me to turn to

63A, and I find that B1 s B0, etc.

You don't want me to get

involved in that, do you?
MR. WALLACE;

Well, it isn't necessary to get-

involved in the details of the equations.

I am just trying to

point out what it is that the claims involve.
Claim 1 is the only independent claim.

Claims 2

through 10 are all dependent upon claim 1 and state claim 1

6
with certain end use limitation»

However, none of those

limitations involve any novelty»

That was the holding of the

Patent Examiner and of both courts below and, as a matter of
fact., this is admitted in the abstract that the respondent
submitted along with his claim»

And perhaps the most tailing

point about this is that, four of the additional claims

2

through 1C had originally been rejected not only on Section 101
grounds by the Examiner, but also on Section 112 grounds,
that is, insufficient specifications to disclose to people
familiar with the art how to practice the invention»

And in

a petition for rehearing, the respondent said, "Oh, no, these
are sufficiently disclosed because they are all conventional
technology that are wall known to practitioners of the art,
there is no reason to have to spell them out»"

And, he cited

previous patents and other technical material to indicate
this»
On page

44A of the appendix at the bottom, he sums

it. all up in saying that the means are conventional and wall •
known in the art, and therefore the specifications are
adequate to meet the requirements of Section 112.

And the

Examiner in response to this withdrew his objections under
Section 112»
So we have also collected on page 7 of our brief
various citations to the record which, show that these claims
do not add anything inventive or ,n©w in stating 'their end. use

some applicant for a patent came in and showed a combination

he could patent that combination, even though all the other
elements were old.
MR. WALLACE?

It could be a combination patent on

a series of steps, processes, putting together processes that
formerly had not been put together if you had the proper kind
of an inventive contribution —

MRo WALLACE:

It’s a process claim.

And the claim is on the process set

Claims 2 through 10 are all dependant on that.

They are not sat up as if the overall claim is on a combination
or processes.

They are just variations of various applications.

MR. WALLACE:

Any process is a combination of steps.

QUESTION %

—

Which is a combination of elements.

MR. WALLACE:

That’s correct.

All I was trying to set the stage for here is that
respondent has never claimed that claims 2 through 10 introduce
anything novel, any more than it would be novel to say

9
application of the Pythagorean Theorem to surveying or to
architecture would somehow limit the claim.

Or if you wanted

to say application of it to surveying east of the Mississippi
River.

They are limitations in that sense, but they are not

limitations that go to the essence of the claim,,
The essence of the claim, what all the litigation
has been about, is contained in claim 1 and the four steps
that are set forth in claim 1.

That is what 1 want to turn

the Court’s attention to.
QUESTION?

What do you think about my hypothetical

case about an applicant for a patent, process patent., using
the force of gravity where always before manpower or electric
power had been used to produce what he says is a superior
effect to the prior art because this gravity, in combination
with the known and old elements, has synergistic affect.
Would that be a valid application for a process patent?
MR. WALLACE:

There is an old case in this Court

that is very similar to that hypothetical, Eibel Process -Co. ,
which is cited in footnote ? on page 5 of our reply brief.
And the Court there upheld the claim because they found -that
the application was an inventive on©, even though it: was using
the force of gravity in a paper manufacturing process.
I don't think the present case really presents the
question whether that case was correctly decided.
QUESTIONS

Obviously —

Obviously gravity itself is not

V

,

IQ

patentable.
MR. WALLACES

That is correct.

And every process

claim is a claim about a series of steps to achieve a result.
They are.all a combination in a sense.
QUESTION; Mr. Wallace, you say you can't patent the
Pythagorean Theorem, but you say a transit used in surveying
is not patentable just because it employs the Pythagorean
Theorem to accomplish this result?
MR. WALLACE;

Not at all.

There may be product

claims that are quite valid that utilise the theorem.

But if

■the claim is to the timorem itself, to the process of using
the theorem or using any mathematical formula or method of
calculating a number, if that is the claim, then the fact that
you want to claim it only in claim 2, using it for surveying,
and claim 3, using it for architecture, and in claim 4, using
it for some other conventional method of use,
material limitations on the claim,

don't present

they don't show any

inventive usa of the claim, it's just a matter of drc.ftsmarj.ship,
of spelling out various end uses,and you can spell out as many
as you can think of in order to claim the mathematical process
related to various end uses so as to get a process patent on
the mathematical process.
QUESTION;

You say this claim here didn't address

itself to any of the equipment involved?
MR. WALLACES

It did not.

It was not tied in with

11
any specifically desicrnsd apparatus»

The whole thrust of the

application was that you use the conventional methods that are
now used of setting the alarm limits, but by putting this
mathematical formula into the computer, ycv can calculate the
numbers more easily and then apply -them in the ordinary way
that the numbers are applied in the existing technology.
That's the essence of what 'the claim was.
And if we look at the? setting forth of the claim
on page 63A, there are four steps in claim 1, which is the only
claim that is material to the argument, as 1 see it.

The

first is determining the present value, and the description
says you do that the way you do it now.

The claim doesn't try

to fill in what the values would be of the process variables.
It depends on the process that you are operating.

You just go

about it in your regular way.
Two and three, which have the formulas are the
mathematical algorithm as it is defined in Benson, and then
Mo. 4 is adjusting the alarm limit to the number that you
calculated by means of steps 2 and 3.

So 4 was added on and

it is described as just doing what you would ordinarily do
once you have the number.
To us® a very homely analogy, it's as if 2 and 3
were a claim for a process of a new way to put together cake
ingredients and then another step was added after you have put
the ingredients together that way to put the cake in the oven

12
and bake it.

That would be Mo. 4.

It's what you would

ordinarily do with the number, the process of calculation, and
what is being done now with the numbers as they are calculated
in the way that they have bean calculated right along.
There is no element of novelty in Mo. 4.
The question, to use the cake analogy, is whether if
the new method of putting together -the ingredients was not a
patentable process, the fact that yon added a fourth step
saying that after you have put them together, you put the
cake in the oven and bake it would transform that into something
that, woulcin5 fc be covered by the limitations of the Ben son
decision.
That is really the way the question was put in the
Board of Appeals and before the Court of Customs and Patent
Appeals in adjudicating the case, and the decision in the Board
of Appeals and by the Examiner noted — I am lumping these
two together for brevity — that one® the number was calculated,
no one expected results were achieved by simply using the
number in the way you ordinarily use the number.

And for that

reason, granting the patent would in practical effect b© a
patent on the formula or the mathematics itself.

That was the

holding, because, as the Board of Appeals said, the respondent
proposes to use just the conventional, automatic alarm-adjusting
equipment to implement the invention in the ordinary way.

So

that the only element of novelty is the way of calculating the

13
numbers according to these formulas.
QUESTION:

What if he had sought a patent with the

algorithm and. the conventional alarm adjusting equipment.
H® couldn't have been turned down solely on the basis that
the whole thing was nonpatentafole subject matter, could he?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Excuse me.

If he sought a patent on —

Supposing that the claim included not

only the algorithm, but the machinery for putting the algorithm
to use.
ME. WALLACE:

Well, if it's tied into an apparatus

which i.s itself an inventive contribution, an element of
novelty, then the process can be claimed.

That's the teaching

of ihe Telephone & Telegraph cases.
QUESTION:

Supposing I went tomorrow to the Patent

Office and applied for a patent on the telephone.

I assume

I would be turned down, but not on the grounds it was nonpatentable subject matter, but on the grounds it was not novel.
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Of course, if that was --

That would not foe under 101, would it?

MR. WALLACE:

That would not be under 101.

But

there your claim would be not on a method of calculating a
number, not on a mathematical formula, but it would be a
-

claim on a process for achieving a result in apparatus.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, do you think this patent

would foreclose use of this algorithm for any other possible

14
imaginable purpose?

The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals

concluded that the present claims do not pre-empt the formula
or algorithm contained therein.
MR. WALLACE:

I think that's exactly right.

I

think that is the basis of their distinction of Benson.

They

say because this fourth step was added adjusting the alarm
limit to update the alarm limit value, it ties the pre-emption
of the formula into a particular use in the hydrocracking
processes,» a particular manufacturing process.

And therefore,

because solution of the algorithm itself would not infringe
the patent, the Court distinguished this Court's decision in
Benson.
That's the essence of what's involved here.
the way the question was put in both courts below.

It's

As a matter

of fact, it was all put in the context of a —

Then is -the argument, just how to construe

Is that all it is?
MR. WALLACE?

1 don't think it's an argument about

how to construe the claims.
QUESTION:

You mean the Court is legally wrong even,

if it is true what they said here., what I just read to you?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Let's assume that’s correct.

MR. WALLACE:

We say that it's legal error, that

the Board of Appeals resolved the question, correctly.

QUESTIONs

Mr» Wallace, let's assume that it is

correct what the Court of Appeals said.

or algorithm, contained therein,

because the solution of the algorithm par se would not infringe

MR. WALLACES
QUESTION:

They added to that.

Let's assume —

MR. WALLACE:

There may not be any other use for it

at the present time that we know of, but somebody could solve
the algorithm without infringing this —
QUESTION«

Let's say they found another use for it,

would it infringe these claims?
it would not.

The Court of Appeals says

And if you agree with that that it would not —

MR. WALLACE:

That is correcta

That is exactly

the issue, whether if in Benson, Benson had added to his claim
s

that it would then be.used in conventional telephone switchboard
devices, that that would make Benson a valid patent claim.
In other words, if the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals is
correct here, then this Court's decision in Benson is really

fedseed to just a drafting obstacle in the drafting of patent
claims.

And if the claims are drafted so that one or more

and uses are tacked on and you can tack on a list of them in
separate claims as long as you can anticipate, think up, than
you cbuld get the executive patent that this Court denied in
Benson.

16
QUESTION:

But the Court, of Appeals construed this

patent as though it ware just an application for a patent for
a piece of machinery.
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

No, no.

It was a process application.

All right, then just an ordinary process

application.
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

But using this algorithm.

Using the algorithm.

MR. WALLACE:

That’s right.

If I can focus exactly the way the

controversy was put below, on page 12a of the appendix to our
petition, the controvery concerned this quotation in the middle
of page 12a, which was from a prior opinion of the Court of
Customs and Patent Appeals applying this Court’s decision in
Benson.

That was the Christensen case in which the Zourt

struck down a patent claim on a method of determining mathe­
matically the porosity of subsurface formations under the ground
without having to dig into them.

As we happen to be in the

opinion of the Board of Appeals now in looking at this quotation
from the Christensen case, and they focused on the formulation,
the words, 58the point of novelty," as the Court of Customs and
Patents Appeal s has said, ".is a method claim in which the
point of novelty is a mathematical equation to be solved as the
final step of the method, a statutory method?"

And the holding

was no, under Benson it cannot be.
But the contention was then made that point, of novelty

17
is not the controlling language there? the- controlling language
is the final step, and it's only if the mathematics is the
final step as well as the point of novelty that Benson would
be controlling.

And the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals

agreed with that.

So that by adding the final step to any of

these claims, Benson in effect, becomes a dead letter.
In a concurring opinion, which 1 had hoped to foe
able to read excerpts from, but I don't have time, a concurring
opinion in Christensen, Judge Rich very

candidly said that he

really, as he said, he didn’t understand the basis of the
holding in Benson. It seemed to him -that all of ’these processes
were equally useful and that they really should confine Benson ,
just to the situation where the mathematical stop would itself
be an infringement.
QUESTION2

He is not the only one that feels that

way about Benson, is he?
MR. WALLACE:
same way.

Apparently his colleagues feel the

And they have construed Benson as I say.

They are

reducing Benson to foe nothing but a drafting obstacle, whereas
QUESTION%

Benson — in which I did not participate,

but I have read — stands for the proposition,for the old
well-settled proposition, that a force of nature or the
Einstein theory is not subject to being patented.

That8s what

it stands for, isn't it?
MR. WALLACE:

It does stand for that preposition.

The

18
significance of it, as we ses it, is that it applies Funk
Brothers test which had been applied theretofore only to
product claims about the test of invention under Section 101„
And that was? the basis of the holding in Funk Brothers, I mean,
the mixture of bacteria was a composition of matter in a
colloquial sense, but it was not an invention of a composition
of matter within the meaning of Section 101 because the only
element of novelty was the law of nature that was —

And Benson said' that this same

And if -that is the only novelty, the mathematical

formula, we can't pre-empt this basic currency of exchange of
scientific and technical knowledge.
QUESTIONs

Anybody else who used the formula would

infringe the patent,
MR, WALLACE;

Well, that's the way the Court of

Customs and Patents construes it.
QUESTION;

Isn't that What Gottschalk said?

MR, WALLACE;

It's not what Gottschalk'said,

I mean,

it happened that there there was no end use at all specified
for it.

But you can achieve the same result by specifying

every end use that you can now think of as a conceivable end
use.

And if that's all Benson means, it means nothing.

But

«

my second roles, and I think of equal if not surpassing importance,
is to attempt to clarify the true significance of what appears
to be, according to petitioner, a dispute on whether a given
patent is patentable.

1 think it goes far beyond that.

The applicant Flook finds himself in the awkward
circumstance of being in the middle of a cross-fire between
the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the United States
Patent Office.

If the applicant adheres to and abides by the

clear decisions which have evolved over a period of successive
cases since Benson, he finds himself rejected by the Patent
Offi.ee.

If he seeks redress from the Court of Customs and

Patent Appeals, he finds that the Patent Office still
disagrees.
What we have her® is a dispute as to the proper test
to be applied to Section 101.

Patent Appeals hairs evolved through a series of well-reasoned

And that

Examining the invention as

claimed and examining the claim in its entirety, do we have
simply an exercise in manipulating the English language by
ingenious patent draftsmen?

Is the effect of the claim truly

to attempt to appropriate a category of subject matter that is
not qualified by Congress under Section 101?
If that is the case, if in practical effect, ail -that
is being claimed is a nonstatutory category of subject matter,
it must be rejected.

ascertain whether as a matter of practical effect there was
a claiming, an attempt to appropriate and pre-empt that category
of subject matter, a mathematical algorithm as such, which
cannot be patented.

There is no dispute as to the basic concept

In Section 101 they said whoever invents or

discovers may qualify for patenting if the nature, of his

And

the Congress said a process# a machine# a manufacture, composition,

Now, the discoverer of a previously unrevealed
natural principle simply does not qualify under those categories,

patentable under the patant statute.
Now, let us suppose you attempt, to patent E equals
MC

by converting it into the sequence of steps of a process.

But if the sum and substance of the process you have defined
has no practical application except the solving of that
equation to determine how much energy there is in a given
quantity of mass, it is not patentable.
Now, what this Court said in Benson was to
re-establish clearly, unmistakably, that vital principle.

He
/

who discovers a hitherto unknown phenomenon of nature has no

24
claim to a monopoly of it which the law recognises „

If there

is to be an invention from such a discovery, it must come from
the application of the law of nature to a new and useful
result.
Now, if the Commissioner suggests that there must
be an inventiveness of implementation test, he applies a
terribly discriminatory standard to am inventor who has
discovered a new phenomenon
it for the first time*

an old phenomenon, but discovered

His task is far more difficult than

the putterer in the laboratory who may just chance upon something
and not have -the faintest idea why it works.

And if 1 could

illustrate thats
The inventor who understands and is the first to
discover a phenomenon of nature, who ascertains and can set
forth for the public knowledge an
principle

underlying scientific

would he barred by his own implementation of that,

however new his implementation might be, because -the Patent
Office would say he is simply doing what would naturally evolve
from the suggestion of the principle, and in effect, -this is
tantamount to claiming the principle,

Pereas one who did not

know the principle, did not discover it, and attempted to define
a use of it would not be so barred..
The inventiveness of implementation test also
disregards how to compara the inventor’s contribution with
the prior art.

The Congress said in the 1.952 Act it must not

25
only be new and useful end an invention , but it must be an
invention in a patentable sense, which we say to mean, according
to the prior cases, unobvious to on© of ordinary skill in the
art*

It must also in its usefulness not have been disqualified

from patentability,.

So we have two additional sections? we

have Section 102 that lists the disqualifications»

If the

subject matter had become known to the public in some way, if
it is in a printed article, public use, on sale, no matter how
inventive it may have been, it may be too late to get a patent»
Hence, it is disqualified»
Under 103 we must now compare the invention, assuming
it is not disqualified, with the prior art»

And focusing upon

the difference with regard to the invention as a whole, we must
ascertain whether it would have been not obvious to one of
ordinary skill»
Now, hero, if the inventiveness of implementation

I have found it.

I have been getting

15Patentability shall not be negatived by -the manner
in which the invention was made.”
This is an extremely important aspect of the statute,
an=express provision of 103.

If the inventor is to be measured

by the inventiveness of. the implementation of that which he has
discovered, he is not being accorded the benefits of the
condition of 103.
QUESTION:

Of course, in this case, the consideration

never got beyond 101.
MR. ALLEGRETTI:

That is correct, your Honor.

I drew the inference, perhaps erroneously, that the

in a fallback rejection under 101.

MRo ALLEGRETTI,:

Precisely, your Honor.

Now, ome of the strongest criticisms raised by the
Court of Customs and Patent Appeals with regard to the
Commissioner1test is that the Commissioner dissects the
claim.

He says there is an algorithm in this claim, there is

an equation in this claim, and that, as such, is unpatentable.
We acknowledge that*

Then ha said, but the balance of the

claim and all of its other steps are straightforward, routine,
and -therefore, because the point of novelty is non,”statutory,
we will reject the claim as a whole.
Not so, says -the CCPA, and not so, we say on behalf
of the applicant Flook.

We must examine the claim in its

entirety.

We must look at all of the steps.

at it in' its total environment.
Now, if 1 may, I would like to re-answer some of the
questions that were put to the petitioner.

Yes, Mr.. Justice Stevens.

Supposing that instead of this complicated

formula you just, had a formula four divided by two equals two

that even though 1, 2, 3, and 4 were all old, that the combina­

Yes, indeed.

the novelty of the entire process?

29
MR» ALLEGRETTIs

I must speculate, your Honor»

any claim which utilizes an algorithm is in the nature of a

1 believe the case is quit© clear that -the Court did not so

Indeed, even some of the judges of the Court of Customs

what Benson stands for.

But 1 do not believe that is correct.

I do not believe this Court, in Benson said that all program­

deceived.

*

Benson says, "Let's not be

Let's look deep into the claim.

Let's see if it's

really condemned a la Funk. or whether In fact some new
process is being claimed,"

If it’s no more than a fundamental

principle of nature in the clothes of a process* it still is
not statutory subject matter.

And in Benson clearly the

relationship between the two numbering systems was old and
existent,

it is a fundamental known concept — unknown concept

discovered by a particular applicant.

When he then attempts

to translate one to the other* he is just utilising that
concept for that sol® purpose* and in effect would be pre­
empting the relationship between the new numbering systems*
which is not capable of being pre-empted.
;

Now, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in its
decision* which is cited in the briefs,, of daCaatelst* which
is reported at

562 F. 2d 1236* Chief Judge Markey rendering

the opinion of the court* pointed out that since Benson
they have attempted to evolve a standard.

They stated that it

was clear from their point of view that the nutshell language
of Benson simply expressed the ancient rule* but practical
application remains the key.

What have you done with this

discovery of an old concept?
They concluded that in the Benson case the court
had simply said that the sura and substance of the claim*
however characterised* was in effect claiming the basic
principle.

The court then, said* if I may read* "The distinction

32
may thus be fine indeed between statutory and nonstatutory
subject.matter considering the glorious flexibility and
frustrating limitations of the English language on the one
hand and the ingenuity of patent draftsmen on the other»
Nonetheless, the line required by precedent and 'which must
here be drawn is clear,

The mathematical expression of

scientific truth or principle is not itself patentable.ts
They concluded by pointing out that the case before
them, deCastelet, fell on that side of the statutory "“non statutory
line occupied — and then they recited their string of cases.
On the one side,unpatentable because not qualified under the
statutory requirement of 101,were th© Morsa case, Benson,
their case in Christensen, and the Waldbaum and Rlchmaa
decisions„
On the other side of this fine line, however,
where the effect of the claim is not to appropriate a
scientific principle under the guise of a statutory process,
were the decisions by the CCPA in Chatfield, Dentsch, and Flook.

of the cases?

Do you agree with that categorisation

I wouldn81 think you would.

Would you agree

with that placement of Christensen?
MR. ALLEGRETTX:

I examined the facts in each of

■diom, your Honor, and I struggled a bit with Christensen.

1

believe the common denominator in the unpatentable cases is
thfet however it's being characterised, it8s something that was

Whereas, in the cases which

Mr. Justice Stewart’s question with respect to the

Does it qualify for patentability under the other

provisions of the statute?
I would simply sum up, if I may, with the view that
the Flook claims are directed to a series of combination steps
and the statute itself, section 112 of the statute, clearly
contemplates combination step inventions, including process
inventions.

It’s appropriate to claim such an invention in

a combine!tion format.
The practice of the algorithm that's included in
that combination of steps in and of itself would not infringe
the claim, that's not being pre-empted and appropriated.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Wallace, do you

have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. WALLACE:

In the limited time I have remaining,

I have to take issue with respondent's characterisation of
the Fun?-: case and with his analogy to the putterer in the
laboratory.

The putterer in the laboratory who comas up with

a new apparatus, although he didn't know the phenomenon of
nature he was applying, gets a patent only on that apparatus.
Someone applying for a process patent on the phenomenon of
nature as applied to this end use pre-empts all use of that
phenomenon of nature regardless of what other apparatus someone
might design for this end use.

It's a much broader pre-emption

of the phenomenon of nature that we are talking about here,
limited only by an end use, and end uses can be listed along.
QUESTION;

Mr. Wallace, in this particular patent,

•this relates to conversion of hydrocarbons.

You wouldn't say

the patent would preclude the use of this algorithm to make
bathtubs or,something like that?
MR. WALLACE?

No, because he didn't — if he had

listed it to make bathtubs, then it would have precluded it
to make bathtubs also.

It's just a matter of drafting the

claim.

MR, WALLACEs

He didn't make it, but we are talking

about whether he can get it for whatever end uses ha specifies
if the only thing new is the algorithm, which is comparable to
a phenomenon of nature.
Now, the Funk case, I have to emphasize, was a
case in which this Court held that the standard of invention
under Section 101 must ba applied to the application of the
phenomenon of nature.
this Court,

This is not a novel question before

This is the significance of the holding in Funk.

The claim in Funk, was not on the discovery that these bacteria
do not inhibit one another; the claim in Funk was on the
product of a mixed inoculant that was commercially valuable,
/

that was being marketed to farmers for use on their leguminous
plants in which these bacteria were intermixed, and that, the
Court said, was the application of the phenomenon of nature.
It

used the very word '’application,”

And then it said,

"However ingenious the discovery of the underlying natural
principle may have been in this case, the application of it
is hardly more than an advance in the packaging of the inoculante."
The application didn’t meet the standard of invention.

And

the vary last paragraph of the opinion says, "We conclude that

That was merely

What was in the patent statute

useful product,, and it wasn’t because there was no novelty in
the application of the phenomenon.
QUESTIONS

Let me ask one other question about the

Government's position I am not entirely clear on.

If not only

the algorithm were novel and new, but also the concept of
using any algorithm to compute adjustable alarm limits was also
new, would the Government say that the fact that an algorithm,

a naw algorithm, was used disqualify the entire process from
being patentable subject matter?
MR. WALLACE;
in the end use.

We would say there has to be novelty

It either has to be tied in —

If there is novelty in the end

use and also novelty in an algorithm that is part of the
process, is the subject matter patentable in the Government’s

MR. WALLACE:
