MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 1346, Lori Hard Division of Lowe’s Theatres against
Pens „
Mr. Brooks, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THORNTON H. BROOKS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
HR. BROOKS:

Mr. Chief Justice, members of the

Court:
This case is here on certiorari to the Fourth
Circuit to review the question of. whether a discharged
employee who brings an action against her former employer
under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and seeks as
recovery reinstatement to her position and monetary damages
in the form of back pay is entitled to a jury trial under that
act or under the Seventh Amendment.
The facts are briefly stated in the complaint, and
that is what we are proceeding on in this case, is that
plaintiff was a 48-year-old employee of the defendant company
c

and was terminated from her employment.

It is alleged that

this was because of her ag© and was a part of the company’s
policy to terminate where possible older employees and retain
where possible younger employees.
Plaintiff made a timely demand for a jury trial, and
defendant moved to strike the jury demand.

The. District Court

4
granted the motion to strike the demand, principally basing
his ruling on the rationale that the Ag® Discrimination Act was
akin to or parallel with Title VIX discrimination on account
of race, sex, national origin, and religion.

An interlocutory

appeal was granted by the Fourth Circuit, and that Court
reversed the opinion of the District Court.

There were four

bases for the opinion of the Circuit Court.

Number one, it

found in the language of the ADEA those words “legal relief or
equitable relief" as making a. distinction in the Title VII
cages.

The Court further found or held or was of the opinion

that Curtis v. Leather mandated that kind of ruling, that
being a Titi® VIII case.

Third, the Court, felt that as a

matter of constitutional right they were entitled to recover
on that basis.

The Sixth Circuit in Morelock v. NCR Corpora­

tion held to the contrary, and petition was granted.
I might state that ponding the case before the Court
of Appeals, plaintiff filed a motion in that Court to have the
case remanded after disposition before the Fourth Circuit to
permit plaintiff to amend her complaint, to allege that her
termination caused her embarrassment, anxiety, and constituted
grounds for, in the common lav;, punitive damages.
The Court of Appeals said that since that matter
had been raised for the first time: before that Court, it should
properly, b® raised only upon ramair.d.

It did not find it

necessary to pass on the question of whether asking for

5
punitive damages in an ADEA complaint made any difference.
Q

On this remand, Mr. Brooks, is there anything

to prevent: the District Judge, within the framework of the
Fourth Circuit opinion, anything to prevent the District
Judge from reserving to himself all of the purely equitable
decisions—injunctive relief, for example—and allowing the
jury to deal with the damage issue?
MR. BROOKS:

No, sir, I would think he could do that.

He could have a bifurcated trial because—
Q

What does he have to have first?

MR. BROOKS:

I would think on the substantive Issue

of whether the act had been violated.
Q

And that would require a jury trial, if the

Court of Appeals is correct, and that would have to come first
undor Beacon Theatres, would it not?
MR. BROOKS:

Right.

And so it is our position that

first we have to look at the legislative act, the ADEA, to sets
if it provides for a jury trial.
reach the constitutional issue.

If so, we do not. have to
The act itself has no

express language that even tangentially deals with the matter
of a jury trial.

It is utterly silent on the question of jury

trial.
In so far as the legislative history is concerned,
it does not even rise to the exterit ©f being ambiguous.

There

is no legislative history with respect to the jury trial aspect

6
of the case.

There is legislative history about the purpose

of the act, and we consider the legislative purpose in
enacting the act was to fill in the gap of employment
discrimination areas that ware not: covered.

It already

covered sex, race, religion, national origin; and age was deeraed
to b@ a proper subject to prohibit discrimination in that
field.

As a matter of fact, Title VII has a provision

authorizing the Secretary of Labor to make an investigation
and report bade to Congress on the need for that legislation,
and that was don©.
Q

Mr. Brooks, if the statute had said nothing

whatever about jury trial, as it apparently does not, and if
there war© absolutely nothing in the legislative history
indicating that Congress intended a jury trial, if nonetheless
it had provided for the mandatory award of damages where found,
under Curtis v. Los the::, these people would be entitled to a.
jury trial, would they not?
MR. BROOKS:

Certainly in so far—if it provided for

punitivo.damages, as it doss in Title VIII.
Q

How about compensatory damages?

MR. BROOKS:

We say no because we say under the

teachings of Title VII cases that is an incident to the
equitable relief.

The main relief in ADSA cases in Title VII

is reinstatement.

That is what Miss Pens wants.

get back to her job.

She wants to

And the matter of compensating her for

7
her lost wages and earnings, she la of course interested in
that-

But her main request and her main interest in this

litigation is to be restored to her position.
Q

But she is asserting a claim for damages, is

she not?
MR. BROOKS:

Y@s, in the form of back pay, which is

what the typical Title VII case is, sir.
Q

Mr. Brooks, does the legislative history show

why the Congress elected to enact separate statutes rather
than amend Title VII?
MR. BROOKS:

Not directly.

There was some suggestion

that it ba amendment to Title VII and just include age along
with feli® other categories.

But there was also a suggestion

before the committee that the EEOC, which was charged with the
administration of the Title VII was so behind in his caseload
that it would b© better to entrust:, this to the Secretary of
Labor, which presumably had more time and could handle this
aspect of it.

But that would be the only indication in there

as to why it was in the separata act.
tators have suggested that there

Some of the commen­

is maybe not a legal

distinction but a psychological distinction between discrimina­
tion on account of age than on account of these other factors.
Q

The other factors ere immutable and constant,

and age changes by the minute.
MR. BROOKS:

Right, sir.

And it is subject to

8
©varyon®'3-Q

It gets worse.

MR. BROOKS:

[Laughter]

It does indeed, sir.

And Congress now

is contamp 1 ating moving it up because they figure, it is
holding the clock back , I suppose.
£0, we contend that there is nothing in the act,
©van indirectly, that speaks to whether there should be a jury
trial.

Arguably we say that Congress did not intend to

contemplate one; otherwise it could have said so.

In Title

VII where they speak for a jury trial in contero.pt casos, they
expressly provide that the parties are entitled to a jury
trial in that instance.

And so wo say they could have said so

in this case if that had been the;.r intent.
Q

Would you say that whenever Congress does not

expressly provide for a jury trial, then that means it is a
non- j ury ca.se ?
MR. BROOKS:

No, sir, Curtis v. Leather, a Title

VII case, did not provida.

We consider that that case was

correctly decided because of the wording of that statute.
Then wa would move to the constitutional issues, and
we would stand on the very concise, proposition as sat forth
in the latest case of this Court, Pern©11 v, Southall Realty,
where Justice Marshall said that trial by jury in actions
unheard of .at common law are permitted but are required by the
Seventh Amendment, provided that the action involves rights

9
and remedies of the sort traditionally enforced in enaction at
law rather than in an action at equity or admiralty.

And our

difference between the parties in this case is whether this is
an action that traditionally would be

brought in equity

or

in law.
Q

Suppose, Mr. Brooks, that the plaintiff here

had been suing your client not under the Ag© Discrimination Act
but for breach of contract and there was a diversity cas© in
the federal courts end her claim for damages was back pay.
She had been fired when she should not, have been.

She would

be entitled to a jury trial then?
MR. BROOKS:
Q

Right, sir.

What, is the difference between her claim for

back pay in a contract case and her claim for back pay in this
case?
MR. BROOKS:

Because to come within the Seventh

Amendment, you must not only have £ right but you must have
remedies in the conjunction, not the disjunctive.

The remedies

in these cases are injunctive, declaring back pay is merely an
incident to the main thrust of the action, which is restoring
the parson to their previous condition.

Whereas, in the

breach of contract, that is an action for a judgment that would
b@ enforced by a writ of attachment ©r by—Q

What if she coupled in bar breach of contract

action with a. prayer for injunction for restoration for her job

10

assuming -that Lur.iley v. Wagner was not: the law in that
jurisdiction and the contracts for personal performance were
specifically enforceable.
MR. BROOKSt

If she had, for example, a specific

contract that was a breach—I man, they wore told that you
t

would to© employed for a certain length of time

and they

terminated before that, as distinguished from termination at
will, which is the type of situation we ar© dealing with her©—
I would say sh© would be entitled to the jury trial on the
contract part and her measure of damages would be different.
Her remedy would be different.
Q

But would not coupling a claim for equitable

relief in the contract case along with the damages claim make
that cas© look a great deal like the case that is being asserted
against your client?
MR, BROOKS:

No, sir, because Miss Pons's action is

based entirely on the ADEAf not at: all on any common law, not
on Iny contract.
Q

What if your client, had been out of work for a

while and then taken another job.
satisfactory.

It is a job she found very

She did not want reinstatement.

She had bean

illegally, she claimed, deprived of her pay for six months, and
she sued for hsr pay.
MR. BROOKS;
Q

That causes trouble to the courts.

This causas you a little trouble, does it not?

11
MR. BROOKSi
Q

It certainly doss# sir.

And what would sh© do then?

Would she be

entitled to a jury trial?
MR. BROOKS:
Q
statement.

I really do not think so.

It really would not be asking for any rein­
So, there would not bo any equitable order that

this back pay would be incident to, as you say.
MR. BROOKS:

But that would be the only type of

situation under this, if sh® is asking for promotion which is
a frequent thing, or she is asking to be housed, which is a
frequent cause of action, or if she is asking for a difference
in pay because she was discriminated there on account of her
age—all of those things take injunctive relief or declarative
relief to obtain.
Q

Of course, if we were to decide against you,

w© could decide against you on the statute and never reach
the constitutional issue, I suppose.
MR. BROOKS:
Q

You could, yes, sir.

I would—

You would suggest that we did not.

MR. BROOKS;

You could not find justification in the

Curtis v. Leather on the basis of the statute, I hardly see how
you could find it her© because there is no basis, there is no-—
there is that language of legal remedies present in this case
that is not in the other.

They might say that this matter

dees trouble the trial courts

since the handing down of the

12
d&cision Aii this case and the More lock case.

There have been

a number of District Court decisions, some following the
teaching in the Lori Hard case anci some following the teaching
More lock.

So,, it

is not an easy proposition.

And only

last week this Court denied certiorari in the case of Masonic
Home Vo Delawaref which was a Title VII case where the.
request for jury trial was turned down, not that not granting
certiorari means anything, but the courts are looking to this
Court for guidance on whether in discrimination litigation
partias are entitled to a trial.

And it is our basic position

that when you finally analyze the cases, there is no real
difference from the standpoint of remedies and. rights in an
action brought under Title VII and ADEA.
Q

It may be, but Congress would have the power,

x suppose, expressly to grant a jury trial under the one
statute and not under the other.
MR. BROOKS;
Q

Yes, sir, they would.

And we say—*

And on© of the arguments here is that that is

exactly what they did.
ME. BROOKS;

Yes, sir, and on® of the arguments is

that that is exactly what they did not do.
Q

Exactly, I understand that.

MR. BROOKS;
Q

And if they can correct our error—-

And wo granted your petition for certiorari.

MR. BROOKS;

One further point that I think needs to

13
bca stressed is that as we read the cases and as many of the
lower court3 read the cases, where the relief is merely
incident to the—-the remedy is merely incident to the equit­
able relief, that you do not have to have a trial by jury»
And the language in Moody y. Albemarle and the language in
Bowman Transportation we think clearly say that back wages,
lost wages, do not have to automatically be granted.
are within the discretion of the Court.

They

And, therefore, they

are merely an incident to the main relief asked for.

And it

is not cited in our brief, but I would call the Court’s
attention to the latest announcement from this Court on the
matter of juries, in Atlas Roofing Company which was in March
of this year? and as I read footnote No. 10, it says that,
going back to Jongs and Laughlin, that this is an alternate
ground, it is a separate ground, as to whether or not-“that
that case was based on, that recovery of money damages is an
incident to the amount of legal r«)lief, even though damages
might have been recovered in an action at law.
1 would like fc© reserve a few minutes for reply.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very wall, Mr. Brooks.

Mr. Smith.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN B. SMITH, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Cc-urt:
I have read the briefs of petitioner and its amicus

14

with car© and listened to oral argument to try to see if there
was some way that the meaning of the statute, when it says
legal or equitable relief, could be rendered nugatory? and I
have failed to find that.

I think that the Third, Fourt, and

Fifth Circuits are correct and the Sixth Circuit is wrong in
the way in which the lower courts have dealt with this jury
trial question.

The statute clearly says legal or equitable

relief can be avrarded.
The

statute goes on to give certain examples of

both types of relief? examples set forth in the statute of
equitable relief
arid promotion.

include compelling employment, reinstatement,
And to me the example of legal relief that the

statute on its face contains is enforcing liability for
amounts deemed unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime
compensation.

And in doing this, the Congress; has incorporated

by reference Section 216, the private remedy provision of the
Fair Labor Standards Act.

The lower court cases over the last
••

30 years intapreting the Section 216 are unanimous in holding
that a jury trial right does obtain under the statute.

We

feel that this judicial construction history must havo been in
tbs mind ©f Congress when it passed the law that w© have here
when it was incorporated by refersnee.
Wei feel that not only do we have the items of relief
deemed unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation—
net only do w@ have these forms ©f relief as legal relief, but

15
we feel that other forms of relief provided by the statute or
the statute as interpreted by the courts would also be legal
for relief.

Among these would be included, in my view, the

statutory liquidated damages, which is posited on a finding
of wilfulness.

I further feel that actual damages for pain

and suffering and injury to reputation may be recoverable
under the statute and, furthermore, that common law punitive
damages may be recoverable under the law.

The Court of course

does not need to reach the question as to precisely what kinds
of damages are recoverable because that does not arise in the
scop© of this case.
Q

Mr. Smith, do you agree that the cases hold

that a jury trial is not required by Title VII?
MR. SMITH:

If Your Honor pleas©, I do not.

I think

that those cases are wrongly decided, but that: is a personal
view, and I think that on© could rule in my favor under the
APEA and still rule with the lower courts under the Title
VII.
Q

In expressing that opinion, I take it you rely

primarily on the language of the statute?
MR. SMITH:
Q

Yes, Your Honor, I do.

Are there any policy considerations that would

prompt on© to suggest a distinction between the two acts in
that respect?
MR. SMITH:

To me there is one that is most

16
significent, and that is related to the question which was
asked to Mr. Brooks a few moments ago about the process of
aging being something that we all have to encounter.

I think

we find in our society that we do not have a pervasive
prejudice against elderly people, a mindless sort of prejudice
that wc found against persons of alien extraction or persons
of minority races that we dealt with in Title
Q

vil.

Does that exist with respect to sax?

MR. SMITH:

That is a somewhat different type of

prejudice because our society is one that is dominated by
males.

I am inclined to think that this is a type of prejudice

which is very pervasive and very malevolent and very often
hard to detect,

ted I suppose the framers of Title VII felt

that because such prejudices are so widely share! there might
be jury nullification of the law.

This is suggested in some

of the legislative history as well as in soma of the Law Review
articles that have bean published on the subject.
X era of the view that-—the same view that was
expressed by this Court in Curtis v. hoc the r- - ■ tit ■ at. such
ccnsiderations cannot override the. seventh Amendment.

But I

again emphasize that that is not the case that the Court has
before it, and happily we do not seem to bs concerned with
jury nullification because all the plaintiffs in age cases
and all the defendants do not want juries.
Q

In ag® cases?

17
MR. SMITH:
Q

Under this statute.

MR. SMITH:
Honor.

In age cases.
How about Title VII cases?

I think opinions differ there, Your

Of course 15 years ago or 12 years ago, when the

statute was first enacted, I think most of us felt the juries
would tend to nullify, particularly in the South.

My own

views on how the—as primarily a plaintiffs’ attorney, I would
just as soon have a jury trial in a Title VII case as any other
kind of case.
Q

In fact, I would prefer to have one.
Mr. Smith, suppose Congress changed its mind

as to how to administer these two statutes, Title VII and this
act, and concluded in view of the mass of litigation that has
resulted—120,000 claims new pending in EEOC--that administra­
tive remedies would be more appropriate throughout, perhaps
w..th an appeal ultimately to a court of appeals—do you think
that would violate the Constitution of the United States, the
Seventh Amendment?
MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, reading Atlas Roofing and

Jones and Laughlin, I think I would b© compelled to say no.
I think that we could take very large spheres of newly created
rights and put them before administrative tribunals, I think
special courts of equity,

I think maybe Mr. Justice White

characterized them as in one of his opinions.
I am. troubled by that.

If I saw too much of it going

on, if l saw too much in the way of classical legal rights and

18

remedies becoming institutionalized in the administrative
process, I would b© disturbed that a very great and run around
the Seventh Amendment were being made.
Q

So, you ar© talking about the creation of new

rights.
MlC SMITH:
Q

Yes, sir, but of course this right-™

New substantive rights.

MR. SMITH:

--has been in existence for ten years.

And if we were to suddenly take this right and make it one
that is determined soley in an administrative context, it
would be to some degree troublesome to me*
Q

Of course in the Workmen's Compensation

statutes the legislatures took rights that had been available
net for ten years but for centuries and abolished them,
abolished the common-law rights of action and created instead
a system ©f workmen's compensation having nothing to do with
negligence

or all the other common-law rules—

MR. SMITH:

But was it not true, Your Honor, that

the defensas ware so nearly absolute to those claims that the
claims before the common law courts were, for the most part,
not worth pursuing?
Q

They wholly abolished them.

MB.. SMITH:

I know that.

But my point is that the

assumption of risk in the fellow-servant rule end all those
things were so pervasive that it was essentially impossible

19
for the workmen to hav*

an affective common law claim.

But I

certainly agree with Your Honos.' that there are instances where
that has been dons and it has been upheld by the courts.
Happily wa do not have such a difficult question.
Q

What if you had a statute that Congress enacted

where it said up to now there has been no federal remedy for
age discrimination, we intend to confer one and do so by this
statute, and we want the plaintiffs to be able to recover
actual damages, punitive damages, but w® do not want them to
have a jury trial because it is going to cause to© much
congestion in the federal judicial system? is it not conceiveable that your client under the Seventh Amendment might be
required to taka the bitter with the sweet and take the remedy
that Congress

has given., whereas the defendant might have a

Seventh As .m dsfient claim?
MF.. SMITH:

I had not thought about that, Your Honor.

My initial reaction would be that what is good for the goose
ought to be good for the gander in such instances.

But that

is a difficult question, and I am really not equipped to
respond to it.
Q

Generally speaking—whatever the answer to that

interesting question might bo.--there is a rule of law that
prevents a legislature from imposing unconstitutional condi­
tions upon the grant of a right.
MR. SMITH:

Surely

20

Q

But that is question begging perhaps to that

question.
MR. SMITH:

I am vary strongly of the opinion that

there cure limitations on the povrar of Congress to deny liti­
gants their Seventh Amendment rights.
under Title VII.

They may have done so

Happily that case is not here.

We respectfully contend that because legal relief is
set forth on the face of the statute.

And leas illustrative

types of legal relief are also set forth.

W© do not think

that there is any reason for the Court to engage in statutory
construction by using extrinsic aids to construction, and
hence w@ see no reason for the Court even to look at Title
•

VII in this case.

between these statutes are very dramatic.
Under Title VIl, Congress went to considerable
length to

.j;

But were the Court to do so, the differences'

deliberately exclude jury trials.

allows only for equitable relief on its face.

Th® statute
The statutory

history, including the floor debates and committees reports,
axe replete with statements that there will be no trial by
jury except in the narrow area of criminal contempts that came
in pursuant to the Dirkssn-Mansfield series of amendments.
Also it is instructive that back pay, under the
Title VII. is said may be awarded by the court, not that it
must be but that it may be; it is & discretionary matter.
Whereas the amounts deemed unpaid minimum wages and unpaid

21

overtime compensation apparently must be awarded by the way
the Age Discrimination Act is phrased.
Q

And then is there a statutory addition, a

hundred parcent addition?
MR. SMITH;

That, is not automatic, Your Honor.

It

requires—
Q

It is permissible.

MR. SMITH:

—a finding of wilfulnass.

Liquidated

damages can ba granted if the trior of fact determines that
the defendant is wilful.
Q

The liquidation is to double the actual

damages, right?
MR. SMITH;

Yes» sir.

And it is very important to

note that th® Portal to Portal Act provision which allows
similar liquidated damages under th© FLSA was not carried
forward into the Ag© Act.

Under th© Portal to Portal Act

there is a discretionary provision.

The court has discretion

to grant or deny liquidated damages, depending on whether or
not the court finds the defendant acted in good faith.

Here I

think Congress is telling us lot us let th© jury decide
whether or rot th© defendant was wilful because the word
"discretion" nowhere appears on th© face of the Ag© Act, and
the Portal to Portal Act was not incorporated by reference»
as many of the other provisions of the FLSA were.
9

Turning—

Did you tell us» Mr. Smith, whether or not th®

22
Fourth Circuit has decided that there is a right to a jury
trial in Title VII cases?
MR. SMITH;

And if you did not tell us, has it?

The Fourth Circuit appears to join

with virtually all other courts holding 'that there is no jury
trial right.

Indeed, they have even done s© in some

employment discrimination cases arising under 1983.

I do not

think those cases any longer can he sustained in light of feh©
Fourth Circuit’s decision in Pons.
employment casas.

I am saying those public

I am not saying of course the Titi® VII

cases, which is a different animal.
Turning briefly-to the constitutional issue, which
I do not think the Court really needs to reach—I think it is
a statutory construction

problem but nonetheless in case 'the

Court should consider the constitutionality of a jury trial
in this case—we would say this appears to be certainly on©
of those cases in which th© Seventh Amendment requires a jury
trial to be given.
I think what the petitioner is attempting to do here
is to reinstate the now defunct equitable cleanup doctrine and
to ask that the damages consisting of lost wages be tried as
an adjunct to the claim for equitable relief.

This Court

clearly said in Beacon Theatres and in Rosa v. Bernhard that
the right to jury trial will

not

b© lost by a trial of the

equitable issues to th© Court, and treating the legal issues
merely as an incidental to them.

23

In Wallace there were the three tests identified
for the purpose of assisting the court in establishing
whether jury trials must b© granted or not in a given context.
On© was whether the claim was legal or equitabis.

I take it

the petitioner really does not raise much of an issue her®.
I think the petitioner essentially concedes that respondent’3
claim is a legal claim because it so neatly fits into the
common-law analogue of the breach of contract of employment
in the action for damages as a result thereof.
And further, taking a suggestion from this Court’s
decision in Curtis v. Leatherr I suppose one could also say
that a new statutory tort was also created, consisting of
discrimination in employment, and that

this is somewhat

akin to the common law cause of action for intentional
infliction

of emotional distress, which is to be tried on the

law side and not on the; equity side.
I find no pre-merger equitable antecedent to the
cause of action here.
The second inquiry required by Rons is whether fch©
remedy is legal or equitable, and we respectfully submit that
the remedy hare sought is a legal one, at least the remedy
for lost wages.
Petitioner argued that reinstatement was the primary
relief sought by th© respondent.

That is not necessarily so.

Two years have gone by now, and it. is not ns cess sir ily true that

24
by the time this case ultimately comes to trial, the
respondent will either wish to or be in a position to try to
have her job back.

And it is certainly conceptually possible

that that claim would be withdrawn before the action comes to
trial,
What respondent has particularly asked for here is

tionary, as petitioner argues.

They ax© mandated by the act,

Tli© act use,3 the word '’shall" and not "may,” and it incorpor­
atas all this history of construction under the FLSA, all of

which holds that such damages are automatic and calculable
with precision.
Furthermore, the claims for punitive or liquidated
damages are historically unavailable in equity and available
only on the law side.

And these remedies as well would

indicate that our claim here is one to be tried by a jury.
The third and final element expressed in Ross is
whether the action could ba managed as a jury case, given
their practical limitations.

We would respectfully submit

that this type case is ideal for resolution by a jury.

As

Justice Stevens noted in the Curtis case at the Circuit Court
level, such cases as these deal primarily with motive and
credibility, which are classic issues for jury resolution.
Computation of damages is relatively simple, straightforward#

25
And even in our own district we have the history that two
cases hav© bean tried by a jury.

And this case came along,

and the jury demand was stricken.

So,

wq

know that you can

try these cases by a jury because in our district we tried
two of them.

In fact, I was counsel for plaintiff in one of

them.
Q

You did not pray for punitive or liquidated or

double damages, did you?
MR. SMITH:

If Your

Honor please, we prayed in the

initial complaint for statutory liquidated damages.

Before

the Circuit Court we sought to add other fairest relief for
common-lav; punitive damages, and for actual damages other than
back pay, i.e., damages for injury to reputation, mental
suffering, and that sort of thing.
Q

Is that a customary thing to do in the Court of

Appeals?
MR. SMITH:

No, Your Honor, but I saw the lower

courts going off in all kinds of different directions in these
cases, deciding in different ways, depending on.the prayers
i(

for relief, and I wanted to have the whole thing in front of
a court and to get it resolved.
)

And the Circuit Court decided

to let it go back to the District Court for a ruling ©a that
motion.

And of course we have not been back there because we

came up here.
Q

What, I am trying to gat at is, do you concede

26
that if you had simply prayed for reinstatement, you would not
be entitled to a jury trial?
MR. SMITH:

If we simply prayed for reinstatement

and no monetary relief?
Q

Yes.

MR. SMITH:

I am inclined to think that that would

be tried on the equity side.
Q

Then it dess vary almost by virtue of your

prayer whether or not you are entitled to a jury ferial, does
it: not?
MR. SMITH:

But I think under Ross v> Bernhard and

the Dairy Quean and those cases that if you ask for any legal
relief, that determines how the case is going to b® handled„
Q

That may b© where the line is drawn, but it

dees depend on the kind of relief that a particular plaintiff
seeks.
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir, but what I was seeing, I was

seeing—I think there was a decision by the Eastern District
in Michigan wherein they said while the prayer for lost wages
dees not appear to be very serious or very prominent—and 1
was seeing these kinds of distinctions which I thought were
not. proper • ones.
Q

You wanted to make your prayer very prominent.

MR. SMITH:

As broad as I could and hopefully broad

enough to ensure a trial by jury.

27
Q

Your original complaint—or at least the

complaint maybs as amended but still in the District. Court—
in paragraph three ©f the prayer it certainly asks for what is
called monetary damages and an equal amount of liquidated
damages, on page 4 of the Appendix.
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir.

If Your Honor pleas®, the

word "attorney” is inserted after the word "plaintiff" and
before the word "monetary."

That is a typographical error,

and it is corrected in footnote on® on page 6 of my briar.
.Paid the record itself will show that that is a typographical
error originating in Ms'. Brooks’s office.
Q

I already had it crossed out.

MR. SMITH:

Thank you.

Unless there are further questions, that does
conclude my presentation.

Thank you very much.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Do you have anything further, Hr. Brooks?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THORNTON H. BROOKS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BROOKS:

On® or two words on the matter of

liquidated damages, to which we wore just devoting our attar?-,,, .
tion, Mr. Smith before the District Court—and it was so
interpreted before the Court of Appeals—that he made no claim
that that issue was triable by jury.

That is found in the

petitioner for certiorari in the decisions of the courts—before

28

tha District Court in footnote two on page 8-A, and In the
Court of Appeals on page 2-A in footnote three# where it
states# "This appeal involves only the right to a jury trial
on tho claim of lost wages»"
Mr. Smith has stated that in our argument ws have
made no mention about the wording in th© act of legal relief.
I might say that, without exaggeration, that the ADEA is not
a whole mouth of clarity.

They have th© language in there

that says you can enforce the liability fox* amounts deemed to
be unpaid minimum wages oar unpaid overtime compensation under
this section.
7(b).

They make that statement two places in Section

Thera is no way possible that you can have unpaid

wages or overtime compensation under an ADEA case.

This was

barred from the language of the FLSA case-—the Fair Labor
Standards case—where the only issue is, Was the employee paid
the minimum wages?

If not, tlfey were entitled to a definite

amount, bringing their wages up to the minimum wage.
The other part of the overtime compensation undor the
Fair Labor Standards Act, if you worked over 40 hears and did
.not. pay time; and half, the regular rate for those hours, you
automatically are entitled to a judgment for that amount.
That was a fixed amount not capable of ascertainment within
the discretion of any court.
Furthermore, my Brother Smith says that we do not
discuss what legal relief means.

I would call his attention

29
and the. Court's attention to his opposition for the petition
of certiorari.

On pag© 7 in the third paragraph, when he

states that, quote, "The term 5 legal relief’ sat out in the
Ag© Discrimination in Employment Act clearly relates to the
enumerated remedy of ’enforcing the liability for amounts
deemed to be unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime
coHip@nsat.ion under this section.5

It also may relate to

other types of legal claims such as common-law damage claims
which are not specifically enumerated in the statute."

But,

we are not dealing with unpaid minimum wages or overtime.

We

are dealing with a claim for back wages, lost wages.
And in conclusion, 1 would gay if a jury trial is
permissible in an ADEA case arid is; not permissible in the
Title VII case, w© end up in the anomalous situation that
Mrs. Pons, being a female and over ag© 40, could have coupled
both actions, both claims, in her complaint,
been entitled to a jury trial.

She would have

But if she had brought only a

Title vii case. she would not have been.

We feel that this

is all a part of Congress’s intent, to put die crimination cases
in the same basket or category, and the same kind of result
should obtain with respect to whether a party is entitled to a
jury trial.
MR. chief JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
